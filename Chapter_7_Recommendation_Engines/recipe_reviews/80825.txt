I made minor adjustments to this and it was fantastic!  It was a wonderful earthy yet spicy comfort food on a cold Sunday night.  I used brown rice instead of white, chicken stock instead of water, and omitted carrot although it seems appropriate for this recipe.  I sauteed some red bell pepper and celery instead.  I chose to make this in a slow cooker.  Saute the veggies and kielbasa first, add to slow cooker with dry lentils, spinach and about 4 c chicken stock/broth.  Add brown rice for last hour of cooking.  Next time I will try adding some cumin and topping with grated parmesan at the end. (tip from Giada).

My family really enjoyed this one. I did make one alteration though. I switched the amounts of chicken broth and water (6 cups chicken broth - 2 cups water). And for next time I think I will be adding a bit of garlic (as that should go in EVERYTHING)...and will cut the pepper flakes in half. It wasn't that spicy if you only had one bowl - the second one had our noses running away. It was wonderful with some buttered peasant bread.

Very tasty. I didn't understand the rationale behind cooking the rice separately, so I just added it with the lentils. Also, I reversed the amount of broth and water. Hearty and healthy.

Excellent -- I made several changes and additions.  I used olive oil--always--rather than vegetable.  I switched the amounts of broth and water as reviewers had suggested, added lots of extra red pepper (I like it spicy), and added the rice (Basmati) with the lentils (green) rather than cooking separately.  I added to the onions, 4 cloves of garlic (minced); to the spices, caraway seed, 1 bay leaf, summer savory, & garam masala; to the broth, a splash of red wine; and to the spinach, a handful of sliced mushrooms.

With a few additions and substitutions this soup came out great. I added zucchini, yellow squash, and a 14 oz can of diced tomato. Additionally, I used kale instead of spinach as it holds up better in my opinion.

I too flipped the water / broth using 6 cups of chicken stock (not broth) and 2 cups of water. I also added a generous helping of garlic, a dash of cumin, and two fresh bay leaves. 

One reviewer stated that the soup is bland, perhaps he or she did not allow the soup to really cook down thus developing flavor. Honestly, 25 minutes was not nearly enough time for the ingredients to mesh and for the flavor to develop. It took me nearly 50 minutes, and having said this next time I will wait to add the zucchini, squash, and kale until the last 15 minutes as it got a bit softer than I prefer.

Moreover, do add salt and pepper to taste, not sure why it was left out on the recipe but it is surely necessary.

I added uncooked rice and F renchlentils and the 50 minute cook time was perfect. 
This is a healthy and low calorie soup that fit my nutrition plan perfectly.

My family loved this!!  I took tips from other reviewers and used 6 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water, used 8 oz of kielbasa instead of 4 oz, added 3 cloves minced garlic to onion/carrot, and threw brown rice in along with the lentils (it cooked just fine...no need to cook seperate).  Will make again, and again and again!  Thank you!

I made this for dinner tonight, substituting Italian veggie sausage for the kielbasa and veggie broth instead of chicken (we're vegetarians) and this turned out fantastic. It's so rare that I can find a meaty recipe and can convert it but keep it relatively the same. My husband LOVED it! Thanks!

I enjoyed this recipe. I love fresh garlic so I added that… I also used brown rice (added @ the same time as lentils) and frozen spinach. I only had one problem, but it was totally my fault. I thought I could save time and just throw everything into the crock pot… the first couple bowls were awesome, but by time I got to the end, all of the flavor from the kielbasa had leached into the broth, leaving the meat flavorless and chewy. (I just picked the pieces out). So if you use the crock pot I wouldn’t leave the soup in it for reheats.

This was very good. I did use all chicken broth instead of the water. And I used baby spinach so I was lazy and didn't tear it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so good!!!  I added fresh garlic just as the veggies were nearly ready, and I did not precook the rice.  I added it with the broth and water. I use whole grain brown rice and regular kielbasa sausage. I have made this several times and it is definitely a keeper!!

Well, made the way the recipe calls for is good.  BUT, the second time I made it I made a few changes which made it better: 1.  DO NOT ADD SALT BEFORE THE LENTILS ARE COOKED - it toughens them, and do not overcook them. 25 min. is the max. 2.  Be sure and chop the spinach so you can get it on your spoon without it dangling off. 3.  Double the amount of broth to make it "soup" and maybe use just chix. broth as no water is needed. 4.  Lots more Kielbasa in bigish chunks, not chopped. They are the best part. 5.  Saute onions and some garlic on low heat for a while, then add sausage and veggies (in chunks again) and saute, then add everything else (including raw rice) and simmer 25 min. 6.  I did use other's suggestions re adding a good amount of cumin, leeks and celery.  Quartered mushrooms added at the end with the spinach.  Oh, and it needs salt! 7.  Finally, I took half of the soup, minus the sausage, and pureed it well in the blender and added it back to the pot to make it kinda thicker, like regular lentil or split pea soup, but because I only pureed half the soup in the blender then added it back to the "thinner" soup, it still stayed "soupy" unstead of "stewy". Yum.  French bread and a fresh salad. . .

So good!! After reading the reviews, I made a few changes. First, I add the 2/3 cup of water and uncooked rice to the pot along with the lentils and the rest of the liquids. Second, I switch the quantities of broth and water, using 2 cups of water and 6 cups of broth. Third, I throw in 2-3 chopped cloves of garlic and a couple extra ounces of kielbasa. I know the thought of lentils and spinach would make a lot of people gag, but this is not an earthy, healthy tasting soup. It's packed with flavor and absolutely delicious!

Very good and satisfying soup.  A 5 star with the  following adjustments.  If you don't want to cook rice separately, throw in with lentils; brown rice is healthier choice, but needs longer cooking time, and soup taste better when simmered longer anyway.  (Remember to use enough liquid for the rice to absorb.) Double the sausage, add 1 can diced tomatoes, switch amounts of water and chicken stock, correct with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.  Don't forget the hot crusty bread!

GREAT soup!  I used chicken broth instead of water and didn't really measure it.  I just add what I need as I go.  I also used 1/2 tsp chipotle pepper instead of the red pepper flakes.  I would have used more if our kids weren't eating it.  Everyone LOVED it!  (even 6, 4 and 2 year old!)

Fantastic! Like many other reviewers before me I tweaked the recipe a bit, after all soup recipes are the funnest to tweak right?! I used 4 cups of chicken stock and 4 cups of water to give it more flavor, 4 oz of all natural italian chicken sausage instead of turkey kielbasa, 1/2 the bag of spinach only because my husband is not a spinach fan, and the lentils I happened to find when shopping were in an all natural lentil soup mix that included spices (Bean Cuisine Lots of Lentil Soup) which contained 2 cups of lentils so I halved it and stored the other cup for another batch of soup. Because the chicken sausage and lentil soup mix were both seasoned I omitted the crushed red pepper flakes. Also like other reviewers before me I cooked the rice in the soup instead of by itself. Right out of the pan this had so much flavor, which of course means that tomorrow it will be even better. Thank you for a great lentil soup recipe!

I just loved this recipe. I made some tweaks and made it will all organic vegetables and NO MEAT. I used more like 2/3 cup of whole grain brown rice (which is much better for you than white rice) and added 1 cup of finely chopped celery, 1 cup finely chopped carrots and used leeks instead of an onion. Also added fresh minced garlic, a sprinkle of cumin, and a few sprinkles of basil and celery seed. I added 4 cups reduced sodium organic vegetable broth and 4 cups of filtered water. I cooked the rice with the lentils (like so many people before me recommended) It took a little longer for this kind of rice but it came out fantastic and EVERYONE (even the meat eaters) LOVED IT!!! It was a HUGE hit and I get requests to make this for friends all of the time.

After following the directions to the t (well, almost: I did use pasta stars instead of rice), I was not impressed.  It was incredibly dense and the flavor was pretty bland, despite the little spiciness it did offer.  It seems this recipe has great potential, but as written, it could use some work.

There is no reason to pre-ccok the rice, and use brown rice instead. Much healthier. Just make sure if they aren't the pre-cooked kind that you allow enough time for it to cook completely. Needs salt and some other seasonings to bring the flavor level up. Use all chicken broth or vegetable broth instead of water. The flavor will be enriched. I like thick soups instead of watery, so adjust broth to how you prefer your soups.

Husband and I really liked this soup.  Only four stars though because I was looking for something thicker, will probably use less water next time.  I didn't have any stock on hand, just used water and it was flavorful enough from the garlic I added and the sausage seasonings.  I used a lamb sausage that I had around, it was quite good.  Finally, I used cabbage instead of spinach since we have an overabundance at the moment and it is REALLY good with cabbage.  I just shredded it and added in the last few minutes, let it cook down a bit.  So good.

Good, but I like it better with some changes I made:  I used 6 c. low-sodium broth + 1.75 c. water + 1/4 c. sherry.  Added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and used brown rice instead of white.  Added the raw brown rice with the lentils and pureed about 1 c. of soup to thicken before adding spinach. Also used kale in place of the spinach, because I had it on hand to use up. Awesome with crusty french bread and a salad...

This recipe sounded so good, but was very bland.  I am sure additional salt would have livened it up, but I didn't want to turn it into a high-sodium dish.  I didn't even keep the leftovers.  :-(

Very hearty and healthy! I was concerned about the seasoning flavor but the kielbasa and broth had just the right amount of salt to flavor the whole dish. I used a whole package of kielbasa, 4 oz. was not enough. Also used brown rice and just threw that in with everything else instead of cooking it separately. Turned out fine that way. Tastes even better the next day!

I just dumped all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook all day and it was delicious.  I used opposite stock/water measurements (made broth from chicken base mix) and I added a spoonful of garlic from the jar.  Watch the red pepper flakes, it was spicy!

I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  This was too spicy for us, & I only used 1/4 tsp. crushed red peper flakes.  Even after adding extra chicken broth to dilute it, it still was pretty spicy.  If you like your food spicy, you'll probably like this.  If not & you want to give it a try, I'd suggest 1st reducing the amount of crushed red pepper & kielbasi & then adding more, if needed, according to your taste.

This is a delicious soup, and I left out the meat! I can only imagine how good it would be with the kielbasa. I wanted a lighter lunch, packed full of veggies, so I added more carrot, onion, and diced red pepper, as well as red pepper flakes. (You can add to your own liking - mushrooms, celery, etc.)  I saw no reason to cook the rice first, so I just added it in with the lentils to cook, replacing all the water with chicken broth. I halved the recipe and am so glad I have leftovers for more lunches this week.

Read the reviews on this soup and made a few changes.  Used brown rice instead of white.  Also used the package of turkey kielbasa.  I added 3 cloves garlic and a whloe onion and 2 stalks celery to the saute.  When I added the lentils and water I also added about 1/2 a bag of frozen okra, aabout a tablespoon of cumin, maybe 1/2 teaspoon fennel, and 2 bay leaves.  The soup is absolutely delicious.  Not at all bland with the extra spices.

Use 4 c water, 4 c broth, Italian chix sausage (8-10 oz), "Bean Cuisine Lots of Lentil mix", Cook the rice in w/the soup rather than seperarely, add chopped carrots, celery, garlic, and leeks adn sub kale for spinach. Use brown rice and add cumin

Very good.  Made a few tweaks... Used brown rice, 16 oz. of regular kielbasa, a clove of chopped garlic, 4 c. regular chicken stock, 4 c. water, 1/2 red lentils and 1/2 brown lentils, and used frozen chopped spinach.  I also added about a tsp. of cumin as suggested by another rater.  I topped the bowls with crumbled bacon. The boyfriend, who is pickier than a toddler with vegetables, and detests spinach, also loved this... asked me to pack him some leftovers for lunch!  Will make again.

I can't see this recipe being 5 stars 'as is' but with a few alterations my family loved it.  1. Reverse the water and broth ratio or simply use nothing but lower sodium broth. 2.  Add more kielbasa.  I used almost a whole 16oz sausage that may be a bit much but I can see around 8oz being perfect.  3. I used about half the spinach in the recipe, any more and to me the spinach will overwhelm the soup. 4.  Skip cooking the rice separate just add it with the lentils.  It is not my intention to butcher the original recipe.  Just that soup recipes are always flexible and I believe a few simple changes improves and simplify the fine recipe.  Also, do not let the unappealing photo discourage you, it tastes much better that that photo looks.

Made this last weekend and it was a great success.  Glad to have found such a great recipe using lentils and spinach.  This will definately be a keeper and will become a regular at our house.  I did substitute quick brown rice and added it at the end with great success.

Really enjoyable, healthy and easy. I make my own turkey sausage with ground turkey and spices using the "Homemade Italian Turkey Sausage" recipe from this site. Also like many other reviewers, I used 6 cups broth, 2 cups water, brown rice and added the rice uncooked to the soup with the lentils. Also I used kale instead of spinach, because that's all I had on hand.

Hubby says "It's a keeper!"  This soup was delish!  I did not have the problem of it being too thick as others stated.  I used all chicken broth, sauteed some celery and garlic with the onions and carrots, added a bay leaf.  YUM!!

Very yummy! I soaked the lentils in water for a few hours.  It cut the cooking time in half! Used all broth as suggested by others.  Also used basmati rice and baby spinach.  This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent! Great base flavour and great nutrition, but it did need some serious seasoning. I used about 1.5-2tsp of salt, a bay leaf, and 1/8 tsps each of cumin and turmeric.   Like the other reviews recommended, I switched the stock-water quantities. I also used an entire half link of the kielbasa to treat myself after a good workout :-)

I loved this soup. I used cooked lentils and left out a cup of water. I also added a little Parmesan cheese when I served it. I will definitely make this again.

This was extremely good.  I used beef kielbasa and brown rice.  For the liquids added 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water.  Any more would have been too watery.  As I made it, this soup is a keeper at our house.

I didn't really like this.  I used 8 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water because I used a little extra rice, lentils and spinach.  It was more like a stew than a soup, but that wasn't my problem.  Just tasted too much like spinach and that's after adding a ton of different spices and salt and pepper. Won't make again.

I did half chicken stock, half water, and instead of spinach I added Kale (chopped to small pieces).

So nice in the winter!

We really liked the soup but I did need to add a chicken bouillon for more flavor.  Next time I will probably use all chicken stock and no water.  Overall a keeper with the fam.

Made this twice now and tweak it to fit in an oval crock pot by doubling the ingredients.  Use brown rice as others have suggested, less water and more broth.  (even have used boullion cubes in a pinch with water)  I saute the veggies, kielbasa and add it into the crock with the rest of the ingredients, let it roll on high 2 hours or so, and then low for another 5 hours or so.  I also add to the spices a whole lot--it needs salt!  I used dried basil, garlic powder, rosemary/garlic/pepper blend, a greek seasoning--you name it.  Have added mushrooms also, it's open to a lot of combos of veggies.  The kale idea is great, will be trying that next time.  Love being able to come home to dinner and this is a great healthy recipe and will use it often.  Thank you for highlighting one of my favorite legumes!  =)

Wow.  If I was stuck on an island, and I could only have one meal, this would be it!  Everyone in our family stuffed themselves, having 2 and 3 bowls because they could not stop eating this!!   I used all chicken broth, no water, and high test chicken broth, not the low sodium kind (we like salt!). I took the advice of others and added uncooked rice directly to the pot.  I doubled the rice to 2/3 cup (we like rice!) and added an extra cup of chicken broth to make up for the liquid absorbed by the rice. With the exception of those changes, I kept to the recipe.  This was amazing!  Thank you for this recipe!

The soup was easy to make but ended up looking more like a 'hot dish' and not soup.  I added more stock, topped each bowl with a few drops of olive oil and parm.  Even with that extra punch it was a tad bland....like hot dish!

Fantastic recipe. I did like the others suggested and switched the water and broth amounts. I also added garlic. I didn't have kielbasa so I added diced hot Italian sausage and didn't add the red pepper. This is a keeper! Thanks!

This soup was very good, it makes a lot!  I'd guess it was around 12 cups.  The only change I made was to use 14oz kielbasa (so the whole package) instead of just 4.  I cut it into half moons.  I don't think it was too much kielbasa, just not as healthy as it would have been with less.

This really is SPINACH lentil soup. I love spinach and I love lentils but I found the spinach to be so overpowering that it ruined the dish. IF I decided to make this again I would use half the amount of spinach!

At 150 calories and 2.6g fat per serving, this is a 5-star recipe. I liked that the lentils took on the flavor of the small quantity of sausage in this soup (only 4 oz.) making the broth and lentils both taste like a good savory kielbasa. I added celery and cooked my rice in the soup, and added another cup of water at the end becausse I wanted mine more soupy than stew-y. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good. I used the extra broth suggested by other reveiwers. Think it could have used more kielbasa and be eaten as a stew, and I would like it better.

I've never liked lentils but this recipe has changed my mind. The flavor is wonderful.  I've already made it twice in 10 days.  My husband loved it too.  I did follow other reviews suggestions and decreased the crushed red pepper flakes since I don't like food to spicy.  I also reversed the chicken broth and water amounts.  This is a great addition to my list of low-fat, low-sodium recipes.

With the changes I made after reading other reviews this was a 5 star recipe.  Instead of Turkey Kielbasa I used Italian Turkey Sausage.  I added minced garlic when sautéing the carrots and onion, added salt and used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups water.  I used brown rice which I added with the lentils and cooked, covered, on low for 45 minutes.    My husband and I enjoyed it for dinner with homemade French bread and ate the leftovers for lunch today.  Really delicious!

Absolutely delicious and quite healthy!  Followed previous reviews and used 6 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water, added some minced garlic, and cooked the brown rice with the lentils.  Took about 45 minutes to simmer for rice to be fully cooked.  Added spinach in at the end.  Careful not to add too much salt, as the kielbasa and broth is quite salty.

This was great!!  My husband had three bowls!  I did not have Kielbasa so I used smoked sausage.  This is a very hearty, tasty soup that goes great with warm crusty bread.  I did reverse the water/stock amount and added fresh garlic.  I will be making this again!

Fabulous.  Used skinless turkey keilbasa, made it easier to eat, harder for teenager to turn nose up!  Switched stock/water values.  Will use more keilbasa next time (and double/triple!).

I made the soup exactly like the recipe suggested.  I love it, i am a big spinach fan and this soup has plenty!  It is the first time I cooked lentils, it was very easy and I like them.  The only thing I might add next time is fresh garlic..saute with the carrot and onion..and maybe more turkey sausage..it tastes great with the lentils.  Thanks!

Very good! Didn't have any sausage on hand so it was a vegetarian recipe.  I followed suggestions of switching broth (vegetable) and water.  Also added 1/2 cu of pearl barley with lentils and skipped the rice altogether. Right before serving I run the immersion blender through it for some creamy texture.

We really enjoyed this soup. I did make a few adjustments. I switched the broth and water amounts. Added some celery, a diced tomato and several cloves of crushed garlic.Seasoned it with some parsley and paprika. I didn't have any spinach on hand and took the advice of someone else and used cabbage. It was really delicious.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I substituted kale for the spinach, used brown rice and eliminated the sausage this time as we're trying to eat more meatless dinners.  It was a big hit!  Thanks.

Yum!!
I love this recipe.  The turkey kielbasa is perfect and shouldn't be substituted with anything else.  I did add a little celery and garlic but that was it.  I added a little more chicken broth so that it was more like a soup than stew.

Oh my goodness, this is going on my regular rotation of soups. It is so delicious for being so healthful! For some reason I wrote down veggie broth when I made my grocery list for this recipe, but honest to goodness, I might make it that way in the future. It tasted great! My husband isn't a big fan of lentils so I may try to substitute something next time around, but he said that when it came to taste and "heartiness", he really enjoyed it. Great recipe!

Great and very easy.
I used brown basmati rice and red lentils. I didn't see the need to cook the rice separately so I added it when the soup started to boil. Let that simmer for about 20 minutes and then added the lentil, as they don't take as long to cook and didn't want them too mushy. I didn't have any turkey kielbasa, so I used sundried tomato & herb chicken sausage, I also added 1 c of celery, garlic, a few extra chicken bouillon cubes, and I left out the red pepper, as my 2 yr old doesn't care for it.

loved it! I followed the recipe but chopped up too much sausage so I went ahead and used it.  It was fabulous! 
I didn't have low sodium broth, so normal broth had to do....i used two cups as the recipe states and it was a tiny bit too salty -- and we LOVE our salt.  Probably because I had the extra sausage. 
We loved getting the nutrients of the lentils without having to sacrifice flavor.  
It was a very quick recipe for a soup.  

Even my 2 year old loved it! 
We will DEFINITELY make it again!

Made almost exactly as written. I used 3 cups of chicken broth because that’s what I had and then reduced water to 5 cups; 12oz of spinach since I had 2 6oz bags, all else the same as recipe. This is delicious and definitely a keeper. My sick husband said it made him feel much better, too!

Delicious with just a little kick! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and kale in place of the kielbasa and spinach. I also used brown rice. I cooked for 10 minutes, then added lentils  the last 20. Very comforting!

I would definitely make this again.  I wanted to use this as a main dish, so I used a whole Jennie-O turkey kielbasa, which I think was closer to 14 ounces.  Yummy!

Nice for winter.  I used turkey bacon in place of the kielbasa, and 3 cups of broth/3 cups of water.  I also substituted orzo for the rice.  Big hit with the kids-even with the spinach in it!

I didn't have any "turkey kielbasa" kicking around so, I just tossed in some chicken breast cut into smaller chunks. I mostly used chicken broth vs all the water this calls for. I use fresh spinach, never bought frozen or canned before. Good with extra red peppers, too.

It was quite good - although I did follow the suggestions re switching the water and broth around.  Also I used turkey broth (it was what I had on hand)instead of chicken but the broth itself was full and very flavorsome.  I also added some garlic (my middle name) as well.  Next time I make this however, I think I may add some jalapenos if I want hot peppers instead of the flakes and use all of one kind of lentil instead of the mixture I had on hand (green and red lentils).  Otherwise I really liked it!

This soup is soooo good!
I followed some suggestions, using garlic, brown rice, added uncooked at the last 30 minutes, and a whole package of keilbasa and spinach. Also, I didn't have chicken broth on hand so I used beef and it worked just fine. I didn't have crushed red pepper either so I used some cyanne. I loved this soup and will make it often!

We added cumin and garlic per other reviewers suggestions. Also added whatever leftover fresh veggies we had in the fridge: celery, zucchini, bell peppers.  Turned out great.

I took the concept but added a few things and changed a few things.  Cooked 1 cup of rice separately and after cooking sauted rice in garlic and olive oil.  I fried Keilbasa with onion and garlic added cumin, chili powder salt and pepper then combined carrots and rice then added 1 cup of lentils and 5 cups of chicken broth (no water).  Last three minutes of cooking I added the spinach.  Healthy, attractive looking hearty and tasty soup, thanks for the contribution.

It was good. Instead of turkey kielbasa I used boneless chicken breast. I just chopped the chicken in squares then cooked it till brown on all sides and til I saw no pink. Next time I will cut down on the water and will keep the 2 cups of broth the same because it was way too watery for lentil soup. I also added a little bit a sea salt and pepper.. The pepper flakes made it way too spicy.

Very nice. Took reviewers suggestions and added some cumin along with chili powder, garlic salt, and pepper. I also took out roughly two cups of the water and added 1 cup butter milk and 1.5 cups heavy cream. the creamy consistency pushed this into the "comfort food". My husband said, "You need to keep this recipe."

Didn't not stray too much from original recipe.  Had more flavor than anticipated.  Added garlic powder, frozen spinach and used brown rice.  Next time I will at least double the carrots.  May also add celery.  Good!

I thought this was just okay; a little too bland for me. I even added fresh garlic, salt, black pepper and saffron. I think it could have used more carrots and rice, too. If I make it again I will definitely add more flavor and use all vegetable or chicken stock instead of water.

After following the recipe, I found it a little tasteless.  I decided to omit the rice.  I added fresh garlic, chopped red pepper, lemon thyme, bay leaves, cumin and mushrooms.  It just needs to be tweaked to your individual taste.

This is really good soup. Used the other reviewers suggestions and added garlic, and did not cook the rice seperatly. Added brown rice when I added the lentils. Also used all of the sausage. It's a keeper. Thanks!

Very good!  Made this almost exactly to the recipe, just used half chicken stock, half water, and just threw in the rice to cook with the lentils.  My only issue was with the turkey kielbasa - the kind I bought tasted like hot dogs.  I'll use the real thing next time.

This soup was very good, although I did make some changes.  I used ground sweet italian sausage, more chicken broth than water and a little italian seasoning.  The bag of spinach cooks down a lot so you do need the whole bag.  We like our soup a little salty so we did need to add parmesan cheese to the soup.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  this soup!  I used some leftover turkey breast & some turkey stock (along w/ low sodium chicken broth), and added some chopped celery leaves.   You just can't go wrong, adding whatever you like!

Very Good flavor and quick to make. I used sweet Italian sausage (removed from the casings and cooked) and I only used half of a bag of spinach...the full 10 oz. bag would have been WAY too much spinach.

First time to do rice/lentil combo and it was great! Kids had a hard time getting past the appearance, but taste was awesome. Used 16oz. turkey sausage and added one celery stalk, bay leaves, 1/2 onion and garlic. Very wholesome and quick. Also cooked rice w/ lentils, very easy.

Like other reviewers, I used 6 cups of low sodium chicken broth and 2 cups water.  I couldn't find turkey kielbasa in my grocery store, so I used an all-natural roasted garlic chicken sausage.  It was SO GOOD!  I ate the entire recipe in two days, alone.  The only change I will make next time is to double the amount of red pepper flakes.  I found the soup quite mild.

Very delicious. I've never had lentils before and this was a great way to try them for the first time. The soup keeps well as well, as it kept for me in the fridge for a week. The only problem I had with it was that the flavors weren't as strong as I would have liked them to be so I had to experiment with it until it was perfect. Other than that, great soup!

As is this recipe is a 3 star recipe.  Definitely use more chicken broth than the recipe calls and add garlic.  I used brown rice instead of white.  I also think it could also use more lentils for a little more substance.

Tasty...used Italian sausage because you can't find turkey anything in N. Ireland, and left out the carrots because I didn't have any but it is so good and healthy and still comfort food-y.  Topped with a bit of romano cheese because I put it on everything and it will soon be a staple soup for my winter menu.

This soup was soo yummy!  I subsituted the rice for Barley and added milled flax and turkey kielbasa to make a little healthier. Overall a great first time experience with Lentils, I will definitely serve again.

Just what we needed on a chilly fall day. Added a little bit of muenster cheese at the very end - helped to add another dimension of flavor and tied the soup together nicely.

Very good soup, although I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I used chicken sausage instead if kilbasa.  Instead of using broth and water separately I boiled the sausage to cook it and used the broth from that as the base.  Everything else was kept the same and the coup was fantastic.

What got my attention about this recipe was the ability to tweak it just a little and make it a powerhouse recipe for preggos (like me). I took other reviewers' advice and swapped the water/broth amounts, added a dash of cumin and also some celery seed, and used brown rice (much healthier) instead of white. I didn't have turkey kielbasa hanging around, so I substituted some leftover peppercorn-crusted pork tenderloin and omitted the red pepper flakes, threw in some sliced mushrooms with the spinach, and topped with shredded Italian cheese blend.  Came out awesome! The one thing I did wrong was try to rush the rice.  I didn't give it the full 20 minutes to simmer and ended up with very firm rice and kinda mushy everything else. Any mommies-to-be or anyone who knows one, definitely keep this recipe.

I haven't had lentil soup in years & after reading several receipes,this was the one I decided to try.  It is great! I used red pepper powder instead of flakes as I wanted to keep it mild.  I put less rice to keep soup from getting too thick, and I had an extra mushroom that I sliced up & threw in there.  However, I needed to add salt or otherwise, it was like beans in water to me.  I also had chopped frozen spinach, which seemed to work fine.  Great health conscious soup, definitely keeping this receipe!!!

Very good!  Hearty!  I added some cumin, celery, and more broth to water as some other reviewers suggested.  My wife is a vegetarian, so I used "better than chicken" brand broth, and didn't cook the kielbasa in the stew, but added it to mine after.  Really tasty!

Great recipe! I served this to a friend who is the BEST cook I know and she asked for the recipe.  You can vary the ingredient proportions to your personal taste.  chicken bouillon cubes worked great and I used more of them- about one for every 1.5 cups of wather. Used brown rice- really tasty and easy AND healthy!

I was afraid of making bland lentil soup - this recipe is anything but that! If you want a real soup though, add more water; this came out like more of a stew/porridge for me. Also, I added celery and used healthier brown rice instead of white rice. Serve in a bowl with an over-easy egg on top for a great, protein-packed breakfast!

I have to give this one 3 stars.  I did alter the recipe but only after I felt it was lacking taste.  I added some crushed tomatoes and some salt.  It just seemed to need more salt.  It does taste better on day two but I probably won't make this one again.  I still think that the Lentil Chili is the best.  I guess I will just stick to that one!

Eagerly added to the "Souper Sunday!" list,  where I make a large pot and put in portion bags for lunches. I've had this batch in bags for eight days, still flavorful and hearty. 
Changes
I used turkey ring bologna because I couldn't find kielbasa. I had a tough time getting it to brown/crisp, but even without that, it seems immune to the "rubbery" meat texture others had. 
I also added the lentils and rice at the same time, to excellent results.

Good for being lentil soup (trying to be healthy is always tough). Added a little garlic powder. Used instant brown rice added when beans were added. I like to serve with salt, pepper, vinegar and a little parm. cheese. Will probably make again.

This was just a little bland for me, although it's most likely because I omitted the sausage as I didn't have any. I had planned on using a ham bone instead, but the one I had in the fridge went bad. I used 4 cups of broth and 4 of water to try to up the flavor, and added a little bit of liquid smoke to the final product. I think I'll try a few other lentil recipes before I settle on this one, although I do like this one because of it's use of spinach.

We loved this soup! I replaced the chicken broth and water with chicken boullion cubes, used brown rice and red lentils cause it was all I had on hand, but turned out great!  The red pepper flakes spices it up just right!

This recipe is very good. I will make it again BUT with my few additions and following some suggestions regarding the veggies to add some flavor. I can not eat anything spicy hot so I omitted the pepper flakes. I added chopped celery, a minced garlic clove, and a dash of dried thyme. I substituted the liquids for warm chicken broth exclusively. My only qualm and reason for the 4 star rating is the cooking time, which is way off depending on the type of lentils used. I cooked mine for over 50 minutes as my lentils really were not cooperating. I also cooked the lentils and rice together. I rectified the salt and pepper at the end. It is very good with the adjustments especially the cooking time. If you see that the liquids evaporate and the lentils are not yet tender, add a bit more warm water or warm broth. Will make it again with a bit of tomatoes!

Very good. changes: added oregano and celery; used bacon drippings and chicken broth rather than just water. Left out the kielbasa - but that would probably be really good. Will definitely make lentil soup this way again. Loved the spinach and rice in it.

I love this soup!  It is so flexible - you can use any sausage, white or brown rice, and whatever kind of stock you have.  You can toss in other veggies or tomatoes hanging around your kitchen.  And you can substitute frozen spinach, kale or green beans for the fresh spinach.  The only real changes I consistently make are adding uncooked rice when I add the lentils, increasing the stock to accommodate the rice, and using the whole 10 oz package of sausage.

It turned out grainy and somewhat bland for my taste. I did stray from the recipe slightly by adding some other seasoning and doing half rice, half quinoa. Maybe I just don't like lentils as much as I thought I did.

Salt and pepper to taste. I don't know why one wouldn't cook the rice in the soup. It worked for me.  It needs to mellow to get the best flavours out, as is often with vegetable soups.

I will make again. I used the 6 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water instead. It had plenty of flavor this way. Other than that I didn't change it . My 4 year old liked it without the spinach which was not a surprise.  But I loved the spinach.

Fantastic flavor and hearty! I used instant rice and canned lentils to cut the cooking time in half. Will try wild rice and add baby Bella mushrooms next time- the heat isn’t too much and switching to 4c chicken broth and 2c water is more flavorful. Will definitely become a family favorite!

From my dear, sweet husband who will eat anything I make.   

My wife told me that we were having spinach and kielbasa soup.  I said, "soup?"  She said, "yes."  As a meat and potato guy, I was less than enthused.  I love my wife, and decided to give it a try.  

She was nervous as she took the first bite.  I took one shortly thereafter.  I cannot say that we disliked it, as it had no flavor whatsoever (even after salt and pepper).  The only flavor came from the kielbasa.  We have had a cold weather streak, and my wife was looking for warm comfort food.  This is not it.....

I loved this soup. The only thing I did was add a can of rotel tomatoes and the chicken broth paste.  Much more keibasa sausage than it called for just because we like meat.  Delicious !!

Because I can’t do anything strictly by the book, I used this more as an inspiration but what an inspiration it was. Turkey kielbasa, lentils, chicken broth, carrots, onions as in the original recipe, kale as suggested by a reviewer (well done!) and brown rice as also suggested by a reviewer. I sliced and browned the kielbasa, added some butter and then the carrots, onions and some chopped garlic, when it was sufficiently sautéed, I sprinkled it with flour and stirred it in b/c I wanted to make sure there was body to my soup. I moved all that to a soup pot, added the broth, lentils, kale, a can of navy beans (drained and rinsed), the cooked brown rice, salt, pepper and some water, covered and let simmer for about 20 min and then added a can of diced seasoned tomatoes. I neglected to add the red pepper flakes which was a mistake; it could have used some more kick - my bad. But a great soup, loaded with lots of great ingredients, for a chilly winter evening.

This is a good soup and smells wonderful while it’s cooking!   The recipe was followed using all chicken broth and the addition of some fresh garlic.  Definitely tear up the spinach (even baby spinach), it makes it much easier to eat.  I agree that the rice could be added at the same time as the lentils and also think the lentils should be simmered a little while longer.  They were still a little under cooked after 30 min.  This was a nice “something different” for dinner & there’s enough left over for a couple of lunches.  The recipe was easy to follow.  Thank you for sharing!

I left the rice out. 4 cups broth 2 cups water. It’s good, but I have a German lentil soup that I prefer. There is also a kielbasa stew recipe on this site that I prefer. But this recipe has merit, as well.

I made a few changes: I used homemade turkey broth in place of chicken broth; I used Aidelle (fully cooked) chicken  sausages rather than Kielbasa; I  added 2 carrots....one just didn’t seen worth it!!; I used a 5oz  bag of spinach rather than 10 oz....personal taste.  It turned out awesome!!

Used all broth,  half amount of spinach (husband not a spinach lover) added some thick cut mushrooms  toward end and simmered it a lot longer.   Excellent !  Husband even liked the spinach.  I will make this again. Good and hearty soup !

This was easy but several steps with cooking rice separately, but really hearty and wonderful on these chilly winter days.  I added extra salt & pepper and skipped the red pepper flakes.

I'm not a big lentil fan, but this was delicious! I did add more (13oz) turkey kielbasa than called for (4oz), used all low sodium chicken broth instead of water and added a pint of home canned tomatoes. Definitely will make again!

It was definitely a good soup. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 5 hours. I’d recommend adding fresh garlic and a dash of salt. Will make again.

Super easy to make and goes great with a sandwich for lunch. Next time I'll add more rice and maybe less lentils,just because my lentils are a little firm for my taste.

It was a delicious and hearty soup for a cold winters day. Healthy ingredients and a satisfying flavor, served with Artesian bread on the side. I did add a little garlic and greek seasoning, although really not necessary. My husband and I really enjoyed it.

Loved it.  I did make adjustments, after reading other reviews (added vegetables, more kielbasa, chicken stock rather than water), and I did not cook the rice separately.  Easy and so good!

My wife loved it, but I thought it was a little bland and too watery. I’ll make it again, but will explore adding some spices and thickening the broth.

A delicious, healthy and flavorful soup.  I have used smoked ham hocks in the past but the kielbasa imparts about the same flavor and is less rich than the hocks.   Definitely will make again.  And like everyone else I just added the rice to the soup base without cooking separately and it was fantastic.

I love reading all of the recipes along with the reviews! The reviews, when written in the right spirit, are very helpful.  I'm still enjoying this soup! Following the suggestions in the reviews, I added zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, cumin, fresh parsley and garam marsala. Also added extra turkey sausage. Additionally,  per the reviews, I let this simmer for at least 1 hour.  This is a delicious, filling and healthy meal! Thanks for posting this recipe and thanks to all of the helpful reviewers!

Very comforting and fun soup to have when it's cold outside.  I read the reviews and used 4 cups Chicken  broth and 4 cups water (didn't have enough of the Chicken broth to do 6 cups).  My husband stated he doesn't like Lentils but after he had this soup he changed his mind.  Added Garlic and Cumin along with more pepper flakes and I thought it came out great.  Good, fun different soup to have.

This was delicious. I added an additional 4 oz of sausage.  I used frozen seasoning mix (10 oz) rather than 1 onion.  I sprinkled some Indian curry seasoning to the bowls when served.

Added ham and farmers sausage instead of the kielbasa only because I had it. Removed the onion and substituted onion powder because I hate onions. The soup is amazing!

I used triple the amount of kielbasa and used six cups of broth, two of water as suggested by other reviewers.  I saw no reason to precook the rice, so just threw it in with the lentils. Good recipe.  Maybe it will be better after sitting for a day; something seemed to be lacking but I can't really say what.

Whole family loved this - all 4  are adults. As many suggested sauteed onions in olive oil, added some sliced celery,carrots, next rough chop 8 oz turkey smoked sausage with 2 lg. garlic - next used all reg. chicken broth - 8 cups + (as needed) added uncooked  brown rice with lentils - added bay leaf, cumin, and few shakes of dried oregano, Lawreys, adjust salt - be careful with red pepper flakes a little bit goes a long way.  Added 10 pkg fresh baby spinach  last few mins.  It was delicious - very satisfying - new favorite!

Like everyone else, I also switched the water and the broth, and even switched white rice for brown rice. Brown rice takes longer to cook, so make sure to adjust accordingly. Instead of 1 cup of lentils, I used 2 cups, because I freakin' love them. This turned out really good, and will be made again. Thanks for the recipe. Sorry for the non-dinner-table photo ;)

This is very hearty soup and delicious!  I made some changes due to what I had on-hand and experience.  They are as follows:  I did not pre-cook the rice.  No need.  I also used Linguica because that is what I had.  Good choice!  I did not add any water.  I used all chicken stock.  This made it a bit rich, so I will be diluting it slightly.  I didn't need the red pepper flakes, since the linguica was hot enough!  
I will be making this again!

I made this soup on a cold rainy day and invited the neighbors over.  It was great and everyone enjoyed it.  I used more chicken stock than water, as many other reviewers did, and it was so tasty and good.  Will definitely make this soup again.

I added a little more kielbasa. The crushed red pepper was a bit much but I might have been more generous then the recipe called for.

Love it.. Added celery and can of diced tomatoes.   Skipped the rice.   Used Italian sausage because it was on hand,  two links which I boiled first to reduce fat,  then cut lengthwise and chopped.  Will definitely make again.

Soup was hearty and delicious! But think I’ll make some changes next time....spicy Italian sausage
instead of kielbasa (it had no flavor!). Also more lentils instead of rice...then would serve with chewy toasted bread. Otherwise, think it’s a keeper!

I’ve made this recipe for years...my children love it!  The only changes I made is I add 3 cloves minced garlic  when sauté ing the onion.  I change the sausage to the whole package of sausage(my kids’ preference).  I also change the rice to a cup cooked.  It’s more hearty this way.

This is in our regular monthly rotation of delicious healthy dinners. We are vegetarian so use veggie sausage. We use 4 c broth and 1-3 c water and do 1 full cup of rice to make it barely brothy. So good!

My first recipe using lentils. I halved the chili pepper flakes and used equal amounts broth and water but left everything else the same. There was enough heat for my taste but I was seriously missing flavour. I did cook the rice separately and liked the way it looked and tasted. As I read in another comment, the flavour from the meat transferred to the broth and the meat itself became quite unappetizing.

This was very easy to make and it was very good.  As JennyB suggested in her review,  I used all chicken broth instead of water.  Next time I make  this soup (which will be very soon), I'm going to double the recipe and I plan to add a few more modifications that the Mrs suggested; such as, adding a few different veggies to add a little more volume to it.

Overall, the soup is a delicious, hearty meal fit for these cold winter days.  5 stars for sure!

Easy to make Gluten Free if you read the labels. I used spicy sausage so I didn't add red pepper flakes.   I used three carrots not one and changed the ratio of broth to water. The cooking times were perfect. I followed the recipe and cooked the rice first in a separte pot.  A definite keeper!

Made as is, the recipe gets 3 stars; with adjustments, it'd get 5. This is because the ingredient mix is a good one, but the problem is the ratios. I predicted the water and broth ratio would make this very bland, so I switched them, and...it was still bland...and I used homemade bone broth from a highly spiced chicken carcass. I'd hoped the flavor from the kielbasa would meld into the broth, but to no avail. I ended up adding 10 ounces kielbasa, just so everyone would get more than a mere morsel of animal in their bowls.  Soup needed way more cooking time in order to get the lentils to be completely cooked through (I used green by the way; I intend to try red next time), and I had to add a bit more water to the pot since some had evaporated by the time the lentils were finished. Overall, as I said, the ingredient mix makes a fine soup, but this needed a lot of added salt and seasonings. I will make it again, albeit with some garlic, and perhaps some sort of herb medley to add some flavor. Might opt for some strong cheese sprinkled on top too.

Good soup for a cold winter day.  Tasty.  I followed other suggestions and placed rice in with the lentils.  I left out the crushed red pepper flakes, my family doesn't like things too spicy. I also simmered the soup longer than the 25-30 minutes.

Wonderful, filling soup. Used a crockpot that could double on the stovetop to saute meat with onion, carrots, celery, & spices, then put it onto it's hotplate. Doing this made for wonderful flavor of the cooked meat and veggies staying in the pot, so no loss of flavor. Added 12 cups homemade chicken broth , no water, for a richer taste. Glad I used this much broth since the lentils and brown rice absorbed a lot of liquid. Added 1/2 a butternut squash for maximum vitamins during the last hour of cooking in the crockpot. Didn't have fresh spinach so used frozen. The leftovers are terrific and but needed some more liquid so in went a can of broth. Served with homemade onion bread. Will definitely make this  again. Very easy and all ingredients were on hand. This is always a plus for working women. A crockpot and pressure cooker are life savers for nutritious   meals.

I was going to make as stated but had to make changes so suit our family's preferences.  Omitted red pepper flakes, used half chicken broth and half water, used a cup of white rice as well and 1/2 cup red lentils and a 1/2 cup regular (green) lentils, and used 1 chicken breast cooked and shredded instead of kielbasa, and at the last minute due to a starving toddler I had to omit the spinach.  That being said, it turned out great even with no added salt or pepper.  Toddler son ate every bite and husband went back for seconds.  I used 1 cup rice after reading another reviewer did so since it was too soupy.  It was perfect for a 3 year old to eat without making a mess this way.  Will make again.

Well, as written this recipe was a tad bland, as others said.  So I added mushrooms, extra carrots, shallots, fresh pressed garlic, Sriarcha, etc.  I ended up making it too spicy, but it just kept lacking flavor.  The good news, is this is healthy!  If I make it again, I will keep tweaking until it is perfect, though.  There is definitely something lacking.  Fun to experiment, nonetheless.

This soup is SO good. I used tips from other reviewers and cooked the rice with the lentils and used equal parts of water and chicken broth. I added a little garlic and omitted the carrot as I didn't have any. Also added asparagus in the last 5 minutes. My boyfriend loved it as well. I will double the recipe next time.

WOW!!!! I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  I cooked it last night for my family and although my kids wouldn't touch it because it 'looked gross' my fiancee and i had to go back for seconds.  I did make a few adjustments.  I added 1 cup of rice instead of 1/3 cup, switched the amount of water and broth using 6 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of water and added 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of curry and ommitted the onions and peppers (but ONLY because i didn't have any).  This is now one of my new favorite dishes and i can't wait for lunch to eat it again!  YUM!!!  This is a great recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

I would say this was very bland and lacked flavor. The lentils needed longer to cook than the recommended time. After adding some garlic powder and a heavy sprinkle of parmesan cheese, it was much more flavorful.

This was soooo good and so easy to make. The only thing is that I needed more than 25 minutes for the lentils to be soft and I added barley that I had on hand as well. The recipe is easy to make and very cheap, will make it again for sure!

YUMMY!!!  I read the reviews before making this dish and switched the broth/water ratio and added garlic and cumin as was suggested by others.  I used fresh ground chorizo instead of kielbasa, which added a bit of 'ooomph', basmati rice added with the lentils, and simmered it for much longer than 25 minutes.  A huge hit for the whole family!

Awesome soup! I followed the advise of other cooks and added a higher proportion of chicken stock, used brown rice, cooked for 50 minutes, and left the veges out until the last 10 minutes. Also, I added sriracha sauce for a kick. I will be making this one again very soon.

I made it exactly as written and it was very bland.  Salt helped and I also tried a squeeze of lemon, but still thought it needed another dimension.  As written, it was not "hearty" but more of a light spinach soup.

I loved this! But my husband didn't quite love it, but he's not a fan of lentils - I've been searching for a recipe he'd be ok with so we can have them more often - and he did like this the best so far for a lentil recipe.  I used 1/2 the lentils and used more rice (brown basmati) but other than that I followed the recipe and it really is delicious.

If you substitute some thinly sliced pan-seared pork loin for the kielbasa then this recipe is a great "gluten-free" one for those that have Celiac Disease. Very flavorful! Before cooking the pork I seasoned it with salt and pepper and just a bit of oregano.

I think if you like lentils it might be good. I personally didn't like it. Easy enough recipe. My husband liked it. I like things with a little more flavor but I also cut out some of the red pepper flakes because I have small kids and didn't want it to be spicy. Good luck.

This was a good soup.  I doubled the recipe and used the whole pound of kielbasa.  Next time I think I'll try regular Italian sausage.  I also used mostly broth instead of all the water the recipe called for, and also used brown rice which I cooked right in the pot.  (Added a little extra water to compensate.)  Seems like the addition of a can of tomatoes would be nice.  I will try that next time.

This soup is awesome.  I will never tire of this one.  Easy to make, very healthy, filling and incredibly delicious.  No salt goes in the recipe and surprisingly doesn't need it. a keeper for a lifetime.  THANK YOU! for this recipe.

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  I didn't have spinach on hand but had some kale.  Worked really good.  Be sure to add the kale with the other vegetables as it needs to cook.

As a college student I don't have much time to cook for myself. This is a really good soup to last for the week and warm up after a night of studying. Great alternative to kielbasa is a can of mixed beans and celery to keep it cheap and make you full!

Very good soup! I used chicken bouillon (about 5 cubes), chopped celery and olive oil. I also also added some kosher salt and black pepper to the pot. The soup is great with french bread and butter. :)

Terrific.  Low calorie, high fiber, high protein.  Watch the sodium but still pretty good.  Feeds a family well with apple slices and some low fat cheese.

This soup is delicious!  My 9 year old son can't get enough of it.  I made the change of 6 cups of broth (low sodium) and 2 cups of water.  I didn't recook the rice but just put it right into the broth with the rest of the ingredients and brought it to boil.  Excellent, thank you.

Excellent soup!!  Threw the rice in with the lentils and only used half the spinach because that is all I had left.  Added a pinch of cumin as that is a preference for us.  Husband ate two big bowls and said he had a new favorite soup!  Will make again. Love recipes with lentils.  THANKS for submitting!

The soup is terrific.  The only regret is that the recipe should have warned to half or eliminate the red pepper if spicey deters anyone.  I made this with the red pepper flakes thinking it would only enhance a flavor not enhance spicyness to this degree.  I read some of the ratings and nobody else mentioned or complained it was too spicy.  I doubled the recipe for the whole family.  Now it will have to be eaten by just the two of us instead 7 of us.  But, I have made it without the red pepper flakes and very much enjoyed the flavor and ease.  Thanks!

Great stuff!  Hearty, filling, and just right for a fall evening.  Crusty garlic rolls and a crisp salad are perfect accompaniments.  The whole family liked this.  Do be careful not to overcook the lentils or they will turn to mush.

This is comfort food!  Used brown rice and more than doubled the amount of kielbasa.  Halved the red pepper and it still had a nice kick to it.  Used four cans of chicken broth and one can of beef broth instead of water.  Included some chopped garlic, chopped celery, escarole instead of spinach, a sprinkle of paprika and two bay leaves.  Came out more like a stew than a soup.  Easy, quick and really good!

Absolutely delicious! I took a heavy hand with the cayenne, but the heat was wonderful on a cool day.  Will use this one again, perhaps trying chard instead of spinach.

Close to my recipe, but try orzo pasta instead of the rice . . . I also add some curry, apples and coconut flakes.  Loads of fiber and delish!

My husband made this tonight per my instructions, doing the water/broth change as suggested by many others.  I also had him put in a half of a kielbasa which amounted to 7 oz, not 4. There was DEFINITELY not enuf liquid in this "soup" (which was more like a lentil stew) so for sure nexst time I'll add more broth (10-20 oz more) and theres no reason why to not add the rest of the kielbasa.  I also will cut the kielbasa in bigger pieces ... the recipe said "chopped" and my husband took it pretty literally and did chop it into pretty little pieces.  I loved the spinach flavor (used 2 bunches of fresh).  Lastly, even with just the little bit of red pepper flakes it was pretty spicy, so if you have little kids you might want to leave it out altogether.  All in all this was pretty good and with some tweaking the recipe could be great.

I definitely enjoyed this soup more today as lunchtime leftovers than I did as dinner when I made it last night. Even with the 6-to-2 ratio of broth to water that people suggested, I still feel like this recipe was lacking something flavor-wise...I'm just not quite sure what that "something" is. This is a good base recipe, but be prepared to season it up really well if you're anything like myself and prefer flavorful foods. I think with the appropriate seasonings (perhaps some garlic, for starters), this would be a 4-star recipe.

WOW. This soup is utterly fantastic and I can't believe how low the calories are. I had two bowls for dinner with zero guilt. The only change I made was substituting a little Mexican seasoning for the red pepper flakes which I was out of, and added an extra two carrots. Thank you thank you thank you!

Very good!  Left out the kielbasa and added the rice with the lentils.  I used 6 cups of stock and 2 of water and it was a bit too salty for me.  But definitely a keeper!  My very picky 6 year old even liked it.

I made this soup a few weeks ago with my 12 yr. old niece.  We took the advice of a lot of the reviewers and switched the broth and water measurements.  As we ate it, my niece said, "this is the best soup I've ever had" ! Out of the mouths of babes !  It was delicious !!  My boyfriend who made a face when I told him about it, thought it was GREAT !! I gave the recipe to my sister, and she loved it as well.  Next time I make it I'm going to add more kielbasy, some mushrooms and possibly some celery. I'd also like to try it in the crock pot.

My husband and I loved this soup.  The reviews are so helpful because you can pick and choose to adapt to your tastes.  I put the uncooked rice in the pot when I added the liquid.  I used 6 cups of water and three dry packages of sodium free bouillon, doubled the kielbasa, and added minced garlic.  Wonderful! A keeper!

Made this for a vegetarian group using vegetable broth and added brown rice (already cooked) until the soup reached the consistency and visual appeal I desired.  It looked good (a whole lot better than the photo), tasted good, amd received rave reviews from everyone.  I've already added this to my personal recipe box.

Good hearty soup.  Great for people on low sodium diets.  I made as is but next time I will use all regular chicken broth with no water added.  Hubby loved it.

Growing up in Minnesota and now living in Alaska, I've considered myself something of a soup aficionado for about as long as I can remember.  With respect to this recipe, I wish my grandmother were still here to enjoy THIS one!  Reminded me of her navy bean and ham soup, with a contemporary (trans. healthier) spin.  SO TASTY, and SO EASY!  My boyfriend and I LOVED this soup, and fought over leftovers for lunches!  ;-)  Thanks for a delicious addition to my soup repertoire.

Love this recipe - with a few changes.  Took the advice of many and reversed the broth and water amounts.  Did not like the descriptions that said if you get past the looks....so I omitted the rice and being a hugh fan of spinach, added 16 ounces, served with grated romano cheese.  Will make this recipe often.

i thought this was ok...it lacked flavor. i used all chicken broth because i was afraid it might be too bland with water, but it didn't help much. i probably wouldn't bother again.

This was sooo good! A bit spicier than expected, but great taste. It didn't look all that appetizing, but the flavor was very nice. I made it as written, except for using a whole turkey kielbasa, not sure exactly how much but probably 10-12 oz.

This was a very good base recipe. I followed it exactly and found it to be a little bland, so I added 1 tsp. of salt, which did improve the flavor. Next time, I'll reverse the amounts of broth and water as others suggested.

This is a winner in my home.  I used brown rice instead of white, halved the red peppers for the kids taste and reversed the broth and water amounts as suggested.

This was pretty tasty.  As suggested I inversed the portions of water and chicken broth.  I did about 5 cups broth  and 2 cups water.  I didn't add the turkey sausage.  It was very good.

Yum!!!  I followed other reviewers and used more chicken broth than water and just added the uncooked rice with the lentils.  And, I had already cooked up Italian Sausages in the freezer, so used that instead of Kielbasa, DH really doesn't like either, but I tried! Added a few more carrots and a clove of garlic. DH complained about the sausage, but DS & I loved every bite!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I like this soup but think it needs a little something more.  I did not have sausage so made it with beef broth and that might be why it was a little bland.  I added extra vegetables such as broccoli which I think I would do again.  I will also add extra spices like some others suggested.
