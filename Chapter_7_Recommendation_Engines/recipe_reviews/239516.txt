This is now my go-to dressing as i adore cilantro and appreciate all it's health benefits. (great for detoxing). The one tweak i have made is that i have substantially reduced the olive oil to about 1 Tablespoon. I will sometimes use only cilantro and omit the basil and at other times omit the liquid aminos (i think this gives it a fresher taste)
