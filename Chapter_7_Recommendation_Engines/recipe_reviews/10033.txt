I make these every year around the holidays - people love them.  Do not store them in an airtight container though - they have a lot of moisture from the pumpkin and get moist and mushy.  They stay great out on the counter for days.  Delicious w/ coffee!

These cookies are superb. Soft and cakelike, not at all dense or sticky. The take on a beautiful shape while baking. I replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with light brown sugar and used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed (what I happened to have on hand). Try adding a little cinnamon to the icing--it looks beautiful. So good! Thanks for the recipe!

Years ago I gave this wonderful recipe to a former friend of mine who owns a chain of 17 deli-restaurants in our area. Customers LOVE this cake-like cookie.  It is so popular it is sold year-round. Skip the glaze and use a cream cheese icing instead.  Delicious! *****UPDATE 2011***** Apparently these are THE most popular cookies sold in this business and they sell out daily.  If anyone is wondering, the initials of this business are "C.B" and it is located in the mid-south.

This recipe is very good.  However, I needed to make a few adjudments.  I followed the recipe exactly and the end product was this: a cookie that was bready and not sweet like a cookie should be.  So for my second batch I added more pumpkin and more sugar and decreased the baking time to 12 minutes. Also, since I'm not a big fan of icing on cookies, I ommitted the icing.  Viola!  A perfect pumpkin spice cookie =)

The cookie by itself is just good. By adding cinnamon to the frosting and sprinkling chopped pecans on top it rates  outstanding.

These cookies are very good,...soft, fluffy, moist, subtle spices, and just enough pumpkin flavor. Texture was similar to a muffin top.  I was attempting to get a denser consistency, so I baked the cookies for only about 12 min and substituted 1/2 of the white sugar with brown. Also, I used almost the whole 15oz can of pumpkin puree, which made the dough stickier to work with, but the end product still tasted great (although not dense like I was hoping).  I uploaded 2 photos of the finished cookie, iced and not iced. For the iced ones, I dropped 1 tablespoon of the mixture and lightly flattened them. No spreading whatsoever...even the little "peaks" from dropping onto the sheet remained intact. So for subsequent batches, I smoothed the drops of dough with my fingers. The icing was way too sweet for me. For the un-iced ones, I flattened them with a sugared bottom cup. I liked the un-iced ones better...simple and basic in flavor.

For someone who has never liked pumpkin much these cookies are just pure DANGER!
Not only was the wonderful 'Fall' aroma wonderful through the house ... but the cookies are extremely tasty.
I can just tell I'll be making these quite a bit this season ... maybe even still this week again ... I'd love to share it with everyone!
Not too bad in the fat/calorie content area either ... especially since I used margarine instead of butter and they still turned out awesome!
Thankyou so much Gina for changing my idea of pumpkin!

Very good!  I made this recipe as listed except for using 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar as opposed to all white.  I also added mini chocolate chips.  They are great without frosting but also delightful with a little cream cheese icing drizzled on top.  I think my batch made 40 cookies.  I will be keeping this recipe, sharing it with friends and making them throughout the year.  Many, many thanks!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I already posted 2 reviews and I'm still getting requests all the time!! I use 3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and they turn out great.  I always double the recipe too because there never seems to be enough!

I made these cookies and they are AWESOME! The first batch, I made according to the recipe and they were good. The second batch I changed up and they were the BEST pumpkin cookies EVER! They tasted like pumpkin pie but better, very moist, super delicious. The changes are as listed: 15 ounce can of pumpkin, 2 1/2 tsp - 3 tsp cinnamon, Added 1/2 tsp all spice, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/8 cup corn syrup, Used cream cheese frosting instead of icing listed: 1/2 cup butter, 8 ounce cream cheese, 4 cups powder sugar, 1 tsp vanilla. The rest of recipe stayed the same. I made two batches and the frosting was enough for both so you could cut the icing recipe in half for just one batch. Another helpful hint do not over bake, bake time I used was 12-15 minutes. I started checking them at 12 mins and took out when they started to turn slightly golden brown. These are a Fall must have! Make them and see just how fast they disappear, Enjoy!

FANTASTIC cookies. I went ahead and added the whole 15oz can of pumpkin (instead of just a cup), and added some cinnamon to the glaze and drizzled it over the cookies. They came out perfect. Will be a staple! EDITED: Made these again and froze about half of the already-iced cookies in saran wrap for about 2 weeks. They thaw out very quickly (fridge or countertop), and are just as good as freshly made.

If you want to surpass all holiday cookies that are served during the season and be the talk of evening at all the gatherings THIS is the cookie recipe to bring.  From Halloween to Christmas your family and friends will be begging for you to bring these.  I've made just the slightest alterations to make these stand out as a signature cookie above all others.  For the recipe itself trust me and go with half white and half brown sugar.  Now split your dough in half.  In one batch add chocolate chips.  In the other batch add chopped nuts.  Walnuts or pecans are the best.  The best way to make these beauties shape perfectly is to use a scoop and then take the back of a wet spoon and smooth the top surface out using a circular motion.  The end result is a beautifully Large shaped incredible cookie.  Now for the best frosting: The ones with the chocolate chips I go with a cream cheese icing.  The compliment of flavors is incredible.  Ad some sprinkles if you'd like.  With the batch that have the nuts go with a maple icing.  Your cookie eaters will go nuts over them.  It's like eating a maple glazed doughnut but this has the complimenting falvor's of pumpkin and maple.   These cookies far surpass those traditional holiday sugar cookies.

I made these cookies exactly as written except I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I disliked them plain without icing. They tasted bland to me or like they were short on sugar. But with icing they are delicious.

These were really yummy, but I do not generally like white frosting... I made caramel glaze instead! Made these into a fall favorite... Just heat 1/2 stick butter (real butter) in small sauce pan until melted and bubbly, add 1.5 cups brown sugar and wisk until bubbling and smells like browned butter, then add 1 Tbs of milk and whisk smooth, let cool a little bit before dunking the tops of your cookies into it. OH SO YUMMY!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful!  I decided to try these for Thanksgiving this year, since the kids don’t like pumpkin pie.  They have a nice spice flavor, and the pumpkin is very subtle.  Unfortunately, they are so addictive that I’ll need to bake another batch before Thursday.  I took the advice of several other reviewers and made some modifications to the recipe.  I used ½ cup packed brown sugar with 1 cup white sugar, and baked the cookies for only 12 minutes.  They came out moist and soft, exactly as I wanted.  If you don’t want cookies with bumps and peaks on top, be sure to smooth over the tops with the back of a spoon before baking.  I added cinnamon to the glaze recipe, and spread the glaze onto the cookie rather than just drizzling.  The cookie itself is not very sweet, but tastes fine without the glaze for those who don’t like frosted cookies.  I left the cookies out on the counter until the glaze hardened a little, then stored them on a plate with a piece of plastic wrap placed loosely on top.  Do not store these in an airtight container.

These combine some of my favorite flavours, pumpkin and spice. They are good as is, but I have since made a more nutritious version, where I substituted applesauce for the butter and added 1 1/2 tbsp of oil as well, used whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of brown sugar, packed, in place of 1 1/2 cups of white, and added 1/2 tsp of ginger. They are still delicious and are healthy enough for my kids lunches.I did not bother icing them, they did not need it.

i followed the recipe exactly, and they are perfect. just a tip, dont make the icing too runny! its prettier when its thicker and it wont get everywhere. also, they dont spread when they bake so go ahead and load up your cookie sheet, i made a double batch.

Simply superb! I always add 1 cup halved, fresh cranberries, 1/2 tsp ground ginger to the dough and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the glaze. Lovely, moist texture. One of my most requested recipes. Good keepers (if you hide some!)

These are absolutely wonderful! Everyone asks for the recipie. The only change I made was substituting the vanillla in the frosting with maple extract. Do not store them in an air tight container or they'll get a little mushy.

Unlike some of the others who thought these cookies were too cake-like, I really like the texture of these cookies.  Mine had a crunch to the outside, but the inside was soft and chewy.  Nice flavor on its own, but much better with the icing.  One note...15 min was almost too long to bake.  Definitely not 20 min!  I will definitely make again.

EVERYONE LOVES THESE! I started making them last year to bring to a party and now people are still talking about them. I just made them last week for my husband and I have to limit how many he eats at a time. :) They are great sitting by a fire with friends sipping on Harpoon Winter Warmer (has that cinnamon nutmeg taste as the cookies do) and passing around the pumpkin cookie plate.   The only difficult part, is if your first making them for the first time, the dough is VERY sticky. I have to have a plate of flour next to me and I pat my hands in the flour before I pick up the dough and roll it into a ball. TOALLY worth the mess! Whoever created this recipe is a genius!

This recipe is wonderful as is.  They are very moist and chewy.  But, if you want to achieve a heavier cookie, substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for a cup of the white flour.

I'd give this six stars if I could. These were absolutely fantastic. They didn't look like they were done cooking at 15 minutes but I took them out anyway and turns out they were done. I only made half the glaze because it looked like it would make a ton but again I was wrong. I should have made the full amount of icing and made sure that each cookie had an ample amount of icing on them. Next time I may try and dip each cookie in the glaze.

Delicious cookies!  I did make some healthier substitutes: I used Splenda instead of sugar, used 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg, added 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 2 cups canned pumpkin puree and eliminated the flour and used 4 cups oats.  I used a soup spoon to keep size consistent and baked for 12 minutes.  They will be softer because of the applesauce, but hold together nicely when cooled.  For my icing, I used confectioners sugar plus Coffee Mate's coconut cream flavor liquid creamer to add a little flavor to the cookies.  Got rave reviews, especially from my diabetic friends!

I have made these numerous times since I came across the recipe a couple of years ago.  They are a huge hit with family and friends.  I add orange extract to the glaze for a little extra sweetness.  Delicious!

like yummy pumpkin bread in a cookie! i sprinkled them with powdered sugar mixed with cinnamon, so they would be easier to stack.  two days later, they are still soft and yummy!  i think they taste better the next day, when they are cool and seem spicier.

Due to the reviews i was really excited to try this being we love pumpkin. First I'd like to say it has wonderful flavor and taste spicey and like pumpkin pie. The reason I'm leaving three stars is it really is not a "cookie" it taste like a pumpkin bread with a glaze over it. I really wanted a cookie not bread. Very soft, very moist and it sticks horribly to your fingers due to the softness. Not what we really wanted and much more simple to just make a pumpkin bread and add the glaze.

These were absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers suggested, I used an entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin rather than only 1 cup. I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar. I added pumpkin pie spice to the glaze to finish them off. They were the perfect texture...very moist.

I really don't understand all these rave reviews.  I am so sorry to say that this is the worst recipe out of all the ones I've ever tried on this site.  The ingredients seem ok and I am an experienced baker/cook, but the cookie was tasteless and gummy.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of icing them w/cream cheese frosting after I found they were not good plain.  Even the frosting couldn't make these cookies taste good however.  I tried underbaking them and baking them longer as well.  My husband didn't like them either so it's not just me.

Great recipe! Very simple to make and an outstanding result. sort of a cross between a cookie and a cake. I made two minor changes for the second batch by adding a 1/2 teaspoon cardamom to the flour mix and then about a 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the frosting. This will be a recipe I will make often.

Made these last night and they were wonderful. They are almost like mini-pumpkin cakes. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I used a teaspoon extra of cinnamon. Love love love this recipe. Even the kids were raving about them.

My husband, who only raves about desserts that include chocolate and/or peanut butter, really liked these.  They are cakey, not cruchy.  Although I did eat some without the icing, it is the icing that makes these so fantastic.  The two flavors together are a perfect complement, and they come out pretty, too.  I didn't see any need to flatten the dough before baking, but I don't suppose it would hurt them, either.  This one is already on a card in my recipe box so we'll do it again.  Great for bake sales and gifts.

Great recipe!  These cookies turned out very soft and tastey.  I added 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the cookie dough, and used a maple cream cheese icing instead.  Wonderful!

These are like tiny pumpkin cakes - light, fluffy and not too sweet - which is kind of bad because we ate so many!! I baked these on parchment paper lined cookie sheets at 350F for 15 mins. I halved the glaze and added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. To avoid a mess, I placed the cooled cookies on the parchment paper I used, poured the glaze in a ziplock bag, cut off a little corner and drizzled the icing. The presentation was beautiful and I'm curious to see what maple extract in the glaze (instead of vanilla) would taste like!

We love these cookies! They are so easy to personalize too- we love to add mini chocolate chips and substitute orange juice for the milk in the frosting. Any way you mix them, these are 5 star cookies!

Soft and yummy. Used whole wheat white flour and added an extra 1/2 tsp of bkg powder.
Added cinnamon chips to half the batch and they were also delicious, but the plain were my favorite. Also added cinnamon to the glaze.

These cookies are amazing! The only change I made was that I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Absolutely scrumptious! It doesn't note on  the recipe whether to grease the cookie sheet or not, so I lightly sprayed it w/ Pam for baking and they came off easily. These cookies don't spread much when they bake so you can place them pretty close together.  Happy Baking!

Hit the spot! Made these yesterday with my daughter. Very good. These are "cake like" cookies, so if you are wanting something thinner, this cookie is not for you. We made the recipe exactly as stated minus the frosting and they were yummy! BUT, we did drop the temp to 375 and baked for exactly 8 min. on a parchment lined cookie sheet as other reviewers suggested. Perfect!!! no underdoneness, no burnt bottoms.

Excellent cookies!  I didn't have confectioners sugar, so I used vanilla frosting on the top instead.  I also added chocolate chips to half of the batch and my kids LOVED these! I'm going to make them again for Thanksgiving. I do suggest however, that you spread them in a pan instead of making them into cookies, because they are more like muffins than cookies.

Yum! These are great! I made these and brought them to work and everyone inhaled them. Now everyone wants the recipe. I did omit the melted butter in the icing...and it was still very good. Very moist and cake like cookie. I agree with another reviewer...the smell in my house was fabulous! Thanks for a great recipe...a cookie keeper!!

YUM YUM YUM!  I just made these cookies yesterday and they are almost gone already!  I was to make a recipe with pumpkin as an ingredient for work and I found this recipe online.  I made a double batch, because I know if they turned out well, my family would want some.  And they did!  These are so moist and delicious.  I know I will be making them more often in the future.  I also added some "pumpkin pie spice" to add more flavor, and this last time I made them, I used can fosting instead of the glaze.  Half of the batch was vanilla frosting, the other half was cream cheese.

These were very good and I will definitely make them again.  After reading the reviews, I modified the recipe just slightly.  I added 3 tsp. cinnamon, used only 1 cup white sugar and added 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used about 2 cups pumpkin puree.  Instead of icing, I used a cream cheese frosting.  Delicious and very easy to make.  My family devoured them!

I did the recipe as written and they are delicious.  They came out crunchy outside and cake and chewy inside.  Just how I imagined they would be.  I have to say I baked these at night and they scented the whole house with a wonderful pumpkin spicey smell.  It's a prelude to the coming Fall and the warmth of the Holidays.  YAY!

These are absolutely amazing! The first time I made them everyone loved them so much I ended up making them again and again! They're addicting. Only note would be to wait a while before putting on the glaze. The glaze needs to be really thick. I used cream cheese icing from the store instead and I think it made the cookies even better.

Excellent recipe!! They always turn out delicious, and they have become famous around my friends and co-workers! Constantly demanded around the holidays. I use a basic cream cheese frosting recipe (1 stick of butter, 1 8oz package of cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla, 4 cups powdered sugar) and sprinkle with nutmeg for color. Fabulous!

These were SO good!  I made the recipe almost as written (subbed 1/2 c brown sugar for white and added cinnamon to the glaze).  Next time I'll sub applesauce for some of the butter and use some whole wheat pastry flour for some of the white... and double the batch, since these will disappear immediately!

Huge hit at work!!  I took them to work and they were gone within an hour!  The dough did seem a little sticky to me, so I added a couple tablespoons of flour - they baked up just fine. I made a cream cheese frosting for them.  I will be making these again.  Delicious! Goes great with coffee

A nice, light cookie, wonderful for fall.   Because it had been described by some as too sweet, I used 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar.   When I first tried it without the icing, it wasn't quite as sweet as I'd hoped, but with the icing, it was perfect.   (BTW -- I halved the icing recipe, omitting the butter, but keeping the full teaspoon of vanilla.  Worked out beautifully.)  FYI -- With small ping-pong sized ice cream scooper (size 40), the stickiness of the dough is not a problem.  Just scoop and place directly on to a parchment lined cookie sheet.

Yum! Perfect for fall with a cold glass of apple cider. I used freshly ground nutmeg which really enhanced the flavor of these cookies. I did have a slight problem with my icing. It separated when made according to the directions. I added more powdered sugar and spread the icing onto the cookies. I think the melted butter may have been the culprit.

I tweaked this recipe based on other reviews, and it turned out AMAZING.  I used a cup of white sugar & 1 cup (not packed) of light brown sugar (I'm glad I did--they still didn't turn out "TOO" sweet this way). I also used the whole can of pumpkin. I substituted mostly whole wheat flour (its all I had in the house), which made them heartier & a little denser (I like the wheatyness).  I also "spilled" in a bit more vanilla, as well as maybe 1/4 tsp orange extract. Mmm!  They turned out very moist & pretty cake-y, and are perfect with milk!  They'd also be nice with chopped pecans in the batter.  I didn't do the icing & they are just fine without it.  Next time I'll try dusting them with powdered sugar before baking.  Also, they spread minimally in the oven, and you may want to smooth over the peaks in the dough with a clean finger prior to baking for a less "rustic" looking cookie.

Very tasty and very easy to make. Instead of measuring out one cup of pumpkin puree, I went ahead and just used the entire 15oz can (about 1.5 cups). I do like the cake like consistency, but I do want to try a recipe where the cookie is a bit more like a "cookie." This also makes your kitchen (and adjacent rooms) smell wonderful!

I like a cookie that is soft and moist inside - not outside, too!  They stick together even without the icing, so you cannot stack them.  And I reduced the amount of spices - they were still too spicy!  I will not make this recipe again.

I followed the cookie recipe exactly, and the cookies are pretty good.  They're not as spicy as I'd like, but the texture is great, so the lack of spice is easily remedied.  I haven't iced them yet, but I'll be adding some cinnamon to the icing for extra flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and moist cookie with the perfect icing.  These are dense cookies - almost cakelike, but very good.  Definitely remember to flatten them slightly as they retain their shape during baking - this way the icing doesn't fall off once they have cooled.  Very good and perfect for Thanksgiving!

Sumed up into one word...Yuuuuuummy!  My kids eat them fresh out of the oven and I have never iced them!  I never get time to although I keep promising myself that next time I will!  I don't use as much nutmeg though.  I just have never cared for the taste to be too strong, just a hint.

I read a lot of the reviews before trying it, so I tried it with some revisions:
1) swap 1/2 of the white sugar for brown sugar. 
2) add an extra egg. 
3) use a full 15 oz can of pumpkin puree instead of just 1 cup. 
4) add a couple dashes of ginger and a couple extra dashes of cinnamon. 
5) leave off the icing.
6) Make sure cookie sheets are greased - the recipe does not state this.
7) Bake for between 11-13 minutes only.
BEST PUMPKIN COOKIES EVER.

I keep coming back to this recipe every year! It has become a staple for the Fall season. I make them exactly as the recipe states, but sometimes Im a little generous with the cinnamon & other spices. Sometimes I make the icing as listed, other times I make cream cheese frosting. I love them either way! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious cookies! They taste like pumpkin bread and they are the softest cookies I've ever made. Pour some chai concentrate in the icing mixture for a delicious twist!

Cookies turned out good, not great but good. They are cake like as others have said. I substituted an equal amount of pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed and as others have suggested, added a small amount of brown sugar. I would say to cut the icing amount in half since the recipe makes way more than needed.

These cookies are addicting!  So soft and tender yet wonderful spices!  Used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Absolutely delicious!

These are absolutely incredible! A couple very minor tweaks--as some others have suggested, I use 1 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar, and I always substitute allspice for the cloves. I also HIGHLY recommend adding cinnamon to the icing--takes the cookies from very good to excellent.

Great recipe and easy recipe! I followed the directions (baked them for 15 mins) and came out with cake-like cookies that my friends and I enjoyed. 

Helpful tips: If you're out of eggs or want to skip some cholesterol, you can use half a banana and reduce the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cup. It worked well when I made it this way, and the cookies smelled of pumpkin-banana goodness! For a crunchier taste, don't round off the cookies after dropping them on the baking sheet, as the little "spikes" will harden up and make for greater texture. If you like your cookies round and smooth, roll the tbsp-size dough pieces into a ball before placing them on the baking sheet.

so i got in a cookie mood tonight, and since i made some pumpkin soup yesterday i thought i may try pumpkin cookies for the first time !

i halved the recipe b/c i didnt need 3 dozen cookies for just me.  like one of the others, i did sift 1 cup of the flour and w/ it halved i just put 1/4 cup of regular.   for the sugar(s)  i had to use 3/4 of a cup, so i put 1/4 cup light brown and the rest white, and i used the crisco butter sticks instead of regular butter.   i split up the batches and made about 12 regular cookie style and then decided to try about 12 in my mini muffin tins, and they turned out great, i posted a pic of those, and think i like them better than the regular cookie style.  made a little bit of the frosting, for the mini style, instead of drizzling i let them cool a little bit and just dipped the tops into the frosting.   very good, recipe !!

Amazing! I couldn't stop eating them. I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white, and left out the other 1/2cup of sugar, I also used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. Also heavy handed with spices and added ginger in. I can't wait to make them again already c:

So yummy!  I did have to flatten the cookies out on the sheet, as essentially they are cake.  Makes it easier to evenly glaze later.  Apriva (no calorie sweetener) substituted great for white sugar, so I don't feel so guilty about loving these!

I'm a real cookie snob and (second to sugar cookies) pumpkin is my fav flavor.  These were good.  Better than "okay," but nothing that makes them great.  They were soft, cake-like cookies with a very light pumpkin flavor.  So texture-wise and appearance-wise they were nice.  Flavor, however, was lacking.  Next time I think I will try altering the spices and see what happens.

These are yummy! Very cake-like cookies. I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of white, but otherwise I didn't change a thing. 15 minutes was the perfect cook time for me. I did make the glaze, but the vanilla was a tad overpowering in my opinion. I'll take other reviewers' advice and try a cream cheese frosting next time.

Wow, these are fantastic. I followed others' suggestions and used an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin, and used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the batter. They came out with the consistency of pumpkin bread, and with the icing they are amazing!

These were very tasty cookies, although to me, they do not have a "cookie" texture; they feel more like a muffin. So, as long as that's what you're expecting, they're wonderful!
After tasting one, I decided to add golden raisins and a little bit of pumpkin pie spice to the dough to add a little more spice...I like a little more flavor.
For the frosting, I really wanted some cream cheese, so I did a cream cheese glaze instead, with 4 oz cream cheese, 1/2 C powdered sugar, 2 Tb soft butter, dash of salt, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 3 Tbsp milk, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon and dash of pumpkin pie spice. I drizzled this over the cookies and they look and taste great! Only problem with it was that the glaze stayed sticky, so I think I'll try to original glaze next time.
Will definitely make again -- a great fall cookie!

This is a good base recipe but it lacks flavor. It needs spices added and the ones called for doubled. The dough is beautiful -- it bakes up like tiny cakes and that alone is worth four stars. I'd follow advice of one reviewer who said to use cream cheese frosting; that would have made these much better. I had to add cinnamon and cloves to the glaze to try and make up for the lacking spice and underwhelming pumpkin flavor of the cookies. With some tweaking, this could be a really great cookie. I dusted mine with orange sugar when done to make it clear it's a pumpkin cookie (as I'm not sure that's evident by taste).

Great recipe, the only thing i changed was the sugar, i used brown sugar to substitute for the white sugar and it gave the cookies more flavor...I also made the rest of the batter to pour into a loaf pan to make some bread for breakfast and coffee...It turned out wonderful! I will be making this recipe again, also I think I may try it to make pumpkin rolls! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Hands down the BEST pumpkin cookie of all time! WARNING: If whatever icing you use is too thin, it will be absorbed by the cookie and appear to have no icing at all. I think it's because these are such a dense "cake like" cookie.I gave these out as gifts last xmas and they were a hit! My BF asked me to make these cookies for his birthday this spring instead of a cake. Pumpkin is so comforting all year round!

These are SO good.  I also made them with the caramel frosting from Pumpkin Cookies V, so easy to dip in the pan & dry on wax paper. (First time on both), wonderful. Can't wait to make them again possibly adding nuts.  Possibilities are endless!  Thank you Gina.

Excellent.  This makes a soft, spicy cookie.  They are so good that my husband has been unable to resist, and he isn't a cookie fan by any stretch of the imagination.  Don't skip the icing as it really makes these special.  And don't store them in an airtight container as they will get gooey if you do.

Mmmmmmm. These are so good! Easy enough to make. I found they only needed to bake for 12 minutes, though. 15 minutes and the bottoms were too browned. This recipe yielded 50 cookies. I used a Tbsp measure to drop them. The icing was good also and covered all 50 cookies. I did add some cinnamon to the frosting half way through. It was very good.

UPDATE:  Changed my rating from 4* to 5*.  I made these again with canned pumpkin.  These cookies turn out terrific.  A little sticky to work with, but very easy and quite YUMMY.  I baked for 18 minutes - perfect.  Yielded 4 dozen cookies.  I will definitely be making them again.  ORIGINAL:  Not sure if my four star rating is fair - you decide.  The flavor and end results were great, but I had a little bit of trouble.  I substituted fresh pumpkin (pureed) for the canned and cooked for 14 minutes.  I cooled completely and stored to frost the next day.  When I took them back out in the morning, the bottom of each layer of cookies had stuck to the top of the layer beneath it.  I cleaned them up the best I could, frosted them, tben put them back in the oven at 300 for 10 minutes.  After cooling (again), they were much sturdier, although still cake-like and moist.  When I stored them the second time, I separated each layer with wax paper (duh).  It appears that using fresh pumpkin puree made the dough a little softer.  It is not as dense as the canned.  Nevertheless, they are VERY good now.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! I really could take or leave pumpkin. It's not one of my favorite things, but I made these cookies for a school function and I had to try one because of the amazing smell. I'm glad I did. They are yummy, yummy, yummy! I followed directions as written and baked them for 17 minutes. They were perfect. Thanks!

Awesome recipe! These cookies were cake-like. I would love some advice on how to make them more cookie-like. Also, I felt the recipe makes 24, not 36 cookies. But these are perfect-tasting cookies, even when baked by a complete novice like me.

These cookies last less than 24 hours in my house.  I have friends that drive over to my house to grab a few when they learn that I've baked them.  I made no changes to the recipe.  Very, very yummy!  Great fall recipe.

Everyone loved these cookies. They taste like an amazing pumpkin bread. They're chewy and the icing on top give it the perfect amount of sweetness. My husband and I didn't think they would be that good, but were amazed once we tried them. I will definitely make these every Christmas from now on, and probably a few times a year. One bit of advice - don't bake them too long. They're more chewy if baked with the minimum amount of time.

Great recipe! My dad and used to always makes these kind of cakey pumpkin cookies with orange glaze as a kid and I have been searching for a similar recipe. This one is even better! As I said, I add an ORANGE GLAZE on top that complements the pumpkin perfectly! They are great without but with the glaze they are amazing! Everyone who has ever tasted them has fell in love!

These cookies are so good!
The whole batch in gone in less than 2 days at my house. When I make them, I make half with chocolate chips and the other half without to satisfy both of my kids. I don't put any icing on them as they are perfect without it. This is a keeper.
Update: made yet another batch and followed a review by substituting 1 cup whole wheat flour for the all purpose and I can't believe how good they still are. Only now, they are a little more healthy. They are still amazingly soft and yummy. I may try using more whole wheat the next time and increase the pumpkin.

These tasted great.  My husband said he loved them and could eat them all -- and told me to give them 5 stars... but they really aren't my favorite.  I can see myself trying other recipes first.  update: I came back and changed this to 5 stars because these cookies are so soft and wonderful the next day (when stored in an airtight container).  OH MY!  I could have eaten 50.

Turned out great yet again! Excellent cookie for the fall. Instead of the glaze, I prefer making frosting, specifically the recipe Cream Cheese Frosting II. It's not too sweet and pairs well with the cookie.

Also, I think it really makes a difference to use freshly grated nutmeg. I baked them for 17 minutes and they turned out perfect.

Although I'm not a huge "spice" cookie lover, I thought these were very good.  Everyone who tried them loved them.   I found it helpful to chill the dough before scooping it out, as it was pretty sticky.  I used a small ice cream scoop (the kind with the scrapey-pusher thing) sprayed with Pam to scoop up even-sized balls.  Made exactly 36.  Worked out great.  Great for Halloween parties as an alternative to the sweeter stuff.

I was looking for a pumpkin cookie that compared to my grandmother's. These cookies were absolutely delicious! I loved the taste and the smell in the house while baking was wonderful. The texture and spice of the cookies is exactly what I was looking for. I iced half and left half plain. I also used apple juice instead of milk in the glaze since my daughter can't eat milk products.

This recipe was good. I made it the way it is but I ALWAYS replace my butter by half corn/grapeseed oil and half apple sauce. 

The recipe held together great. I added white chocolate chips and some nuts and it is GREAT. If you like the spicy flave of those type of recipes- add a bit more cinnamon. YUM!

I've made these twice in the past week and everyone who has eaten them has loved them!!!!  3 people have already asked me for the recipe.  The first time I drizzled the frosting over half of them but the second time I left them all plain.  They are so good plain, I didn't want to ruin them with the frosting!!!  I baked them on my stone as I do all my cookies and they cam out so soft.  DELICIOUS!!!

Easy. Good. Better the second and third day. Happily I made them the night before my event. After they were cool I tasted one. OK. But the next night when I served them they were much more flavorful. I had some left over from the event which my family ate the next night. Even better! This recipe is a keeper.

Absolute 5 stars. I ended up using a pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree. This makes for a sweeter, more flavorful cookie. I like a soft cake-like texture myself, so I baked for only 14 mins. You don't even have to love pumpkin to love this, delicious! Not a lover of confectioner glaze myself (too sweet), so I enjoyed the cookies without the frosting. Would be very good with a cream cheese frosting though.

These cookies are INCREDIBLE. I had no idea they'd turn out this good. I did as many others suggested and used a little extra pumpkin, used brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar, and added some cinnamon to the icing. I baked them right at 12 minutes and they came out perfect. Seriously, they're super moist with an interesting texture, and the icing really makes them endlessly better. I think my dad ate 7 of them within an hour. I absolutely recommend these for a unique pumpkin treat!!!

I had an hour before guests were going to arrive and I didn't have a dessert.  In my pantry were all the items to make these cookies and I am SO GLAD I did!!  These cookies turned out delicious.  Light and not too sweet but filled with flavor.  They are more cake-like then cookie and wonderfully moist.  I too substituted 1/2 c of brown sugar for the white.  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled some candied pecans on top and it's to die for.  I have another party coming up and these will be on my menu.

I just made these and they turned out great, not particularly strong in pumpkin flavour. They are more similar to a muffin top with its kind of cakey texture versus a traditional chewy cookie. I did up the amount of spices that I added to the recipe and replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. You can easily fit 15 cookies on a sheet because the cookies don't spread that much, they just puff up a little bit which is why you definitely need to press the cookies a little bit before baking. I preferred these with a cream cheese frosting versus the simple glaze from the recipe.

These were a hit at my office this week. My coworker just ate 6 of them and she normally would never do that. Just know that when you mix all the ingredients, the dough is sticky.. but that's normal. If you spoon the dough on the sheet, just use some flour on your hands to flatten the spoonfuls and they will turn out flatter after baking. Also, use cream cheese frosting! It's easier and tastes amazing!

I just made these and took a risk by substituting 1 cup of coconut flour for 1 cup of the AP flour, and luckily it paid off and they taste yummy. Please note you have to add 1 egg for each ounce of coconut flour, so I added 4 eggs to this recipe. I didn't make the frosting because I didn't want the extra calories, but I think that might be the lil' somthin' somethin' that my batch of these cookies are missing.

I love the taste and also my whole family. Unfortunately they came out flat and not like a usual cookie, but they were gone in a minute. I also took half amount of the white sugar and half of the brown sugar and didn't do the icing. Thank you for this delicious recipe !

Yum! This was a delicious cookie with just the right flavors. They're easy to make and well received. Adding a little cinnamon to the glaze puts them right over the top!

these are perfect! i dont like hard cookies and these are the opposite, they are soft like cake.  i only used 1 cup confectioners sugar to make the icing, it does not need 2.  i added cinnamon, and a bit of maple syrup to it and it turned out great.

Loved this recipe, did a couple things different: I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. Added cinnamon and coffee ground to the frosting. I added oats the the actual scones themselves. I can not wait to try this recipe again!!!

This is our new family favorite!  I usually make a double batch.  I frost half and freeze the other half to frost later.  They taste just as good after being frozen.  Nobody can even tell!

WOW! This recipe received rave reviews from everyone! I made a double batch, half iced, and half with chocolate chips. Both were yummy, but my families favorite is w/chocolate chips! This is a 'go-to' fall treat from now on. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I really don't know why some gave this recipe such a low rating.  These are awesome cookies....they don't know how to bake I guess.  Moist, soft and delicious.  Not dry, not wet, not sticky....amazing cookies.  I don't post comments unless I think they deserve it and this recipe deserves more than 5 stars.  Thanks for a new fall favourite and one for the lunch boxes.  I didn't change a thing....don't mess with perfection.

This has been my "Fall" cookie for many years and everyone always loves them ... many requests for the recipe. They are soft and cake-like and great frosted or not ... though, using two and frosting between with your favorite frosting like whoopie pies won't find anyone complaining.  And, if you call them spice cookies instead of pumpkin, even pumpkin dislikers will have a change of heart. A little suggestion for those of you who are having trouble pressing the cookies down ... until this round of cookies, I have never pressed them down and they turn out with a nice appearance just the same ... especially, if you kind of swirl the dough drop a bit when you place on cookie sheet. The dough bakes down nicely and little, peak-like swirls mark the cookie. But, if you prefer to press without sticking, rub a bit of butter on the bottom of a small glass, dip into a bowl of cinnamon sugar and tap the cookie gently and no-stick. A bonus when making these is a deliciously scented home!!

What a great recipe! My husband and I both made these together, and decided we didn't want the icing component, so we made the cookies without the icing (per original recipe).

Instead of adding the icing, we lightly pressed a fork into each flattened cookie to form 'grooves'. Then we put a drop of pure maple syrup on each cookie, spread it so it would seep into the grooves. Then we sprinkled each cookie with brown sugar, and baked the cookies for about 18-20 minutes a sheet on parchment paper.

Also, as we did not have nutmeg, we used allspice instead (with cinnamon and cloves), and used baked butternut squash puree instead of pumpkin puree.

Will make these again. Delicious!!!

I don't really care that much for pumpkin, but these are outstanding. Apparently others agree, because we made them for a New Years party last night and everyone raved and wanted the recipe.

These cookies are out of this world. I added a bit of orange zest to the icing to balance out the sweetness and it turned out just perfect. I also used Silk's pumpkin spice soy milk in the icing as well. YUM! :)

Really tasty!!! My only complaint was the dough was a little sticky and hard to work with but the result was great! I topped mine with a simple cream cheese icing and some toasted walnuts. Pretty and delicious. P.S. I did not smash mine down and I liked it better this way. I like a more rounded cookie as opposed to flat. Tasty! Thanks

This recipe is super easy to make!  The only differences I made were adding a little bit of cinnamon to the icing and I used fresh pumpkin puree.  This cookies are super addictive to eat as they aren't super sweet and are soft like cake.

Love, love, love this recipe as is, although instead of dropping by the tablespoonful I use a teaspoon and cook for 12 minutes. A new Christmas tradition in our house!

These could be good cookies but there is a lot of tweeking to be done. I found these to be pretty bland so I would definetly increase the spices. Also it barely tasted like pumpkin, so I would increase the pumpkin as well. These were pretty dense as well so mixing was pretty stiff. I cooked them for 12 minutes instead and they came out pretty moist though. The only thing that saved these cookies for me was I put cream cheese icing on top instead of this icing.

What a cookie! This is a great recipe for those that are just beginning to bake too, I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 a cup of the white sugar and it came out great! I used all-spice since I didn't have all of the other spices and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also added a little bit more salt (I found the batter was a little bit too sweet) so I added a full teaspoon of salt.  I haven't made the glaze yet but am taking the suggestion to add the cinnamon, these would benefit from a tang, and I think a cream cheese frosting would set them off right! They are so delicious and moist! Thanks for sharing.

No complaints about this one! Just want to note that I didn't even ice these (I'm not a big fan of icing in general), they were delicious without it! I also realized in the middle of making them that I didn't have ground cloves, so I substituted allspice. I will definitely make these again!

These cookies taste good- I made them exactly as the recipe called for. I haven't made any icing for them, though I may eventually. Just be warned, these are a little more like cake than cookies. Not that it's a bad thing. When they bake, they bake in the shape they are. So if you're looking for a nice uniform shape, do it before you bake them (they don't spread like choco chip cookies or such). I did only bake them 12 minutes, as well. Delicious all around!

Really, really liked these!  I baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect.  Soft and delicious.  The only thing that I changed was that I used fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg, fresh pumpkin and used maple extract in the glaze instead of vanilla.  I will totally be making this recipe again!

Fantastic.  I followed the advice of others and replace 1/2 c. white sugar for 1/2 c. brown.  I also sprinkled chopped pecans on after the icing, that was the best touch.  I made a dozen with raisins and those were great too.  Definitely a keeper!

These cookies are the perfect fix when you are craving a pumpkin dessert.  Perfect mix of sweet and spicy and the icing makes an impressive presentation.  Delicious!

Incredible, and they always earn me rave reviews. I use some brown sugar instead of all white, and add a full can of pumpkin puree instead of just a cup.

OMG - can we say heavenly?  These are now my favorite cookie. I added 3/4 C chopped walnuts because I remembered eating them that way as a small child. The walnuts really add a lot. Thanks forever for posting this recipe!

WONDERFUL!!!  I get requests to make these over and over again.  My husband (who's not fond of pumpkin) even loved these.  I did make some without the frosting and while delish as well, not as tasty as the ones with.  Great treat to have with tea or coffee.  Very easy to make and always a big hit.

Yummy soft cookie, easy recipe to follow and everyone loved them.  The cookies keep, and freeze well.  The only change I made was to use pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves did not have any.  Thanks for the recipe will be making again.

So spicy and delicious, just the way we like them!! I followed the icing directions exactly, and the icing was super runny would not stay on the cookie.  So instead, I dipped the cookies in the icing and let the excess drip off, let the cookie sit and the icing harden, and then I dipped it again. Mine were not bright orange as shown in the picture, but they sure were delicious!

These cookies are simply fabulous! the taste of all the spices in the cookie is great reminds you of fall. The icing on the cookies is great but i find it makes to much so the second time i made the cookies i halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount:)

Overall, a good recipe.  I needed to extend the cook time and the cookies came out a bit doughy for my liking.  Probably due to my inexperience more than anything.

Fanfreakintastic! Baked dozens of these over the holidays. Huge hit. They stay soft and delicious for days. I used these to send to the troops as part of a local drive - they'll stay tasty that long.

This is a solid recipe I make over and over.  It is a cakey cookie but I love them for that reason.  I don't store them in an airtight container or else they get a bit too soft.

These are fantastic but they are even better when the glaze is made with medium dark Quebec maple syrup! :)  I have used 1/2 cup of maple syrup and 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar and the frosting still turns out nice. If you want to experiment with the opacity or you want more of a glaze than a frosting, just use more maple syrup.

I made these as a christmas treat this year, and took them to a friends christmas eve dinner party. Every on thought they were amazing! They are like little bites of cake! The only change I made was adding a little maple extract to the glaze, but I think I will do as another reviewer suggested and whip up some maple cream cheese frosting the next time I make them!

This cookie is an exact replica of pumpkin pie. They were even better the second day. It was the best cookie I have had in a long time and I decided it will be a tradition to make these every year for Thanksgiving.

I followed the recipe exactly only adding a little cinnamon to the glaze icing. These cookies were SO DELICIOUS! Even my husband who is not a pumpkin fan gobbled them up. Will be adding these to my Thanksgiving menu :)

Super cake-like and dense! I subsituted one cup of brown sugar for white and added more cinnamon.  Frosting: I added a half cup of cream cheese to some milk, powdered sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon. It was AMAZING! It made a thicker, spreadable glaze/frosting that went perfect with the warm taste of the cinnamon pumpkin cookie!

I made these today to take to a friend.  They were very easy.  I added 1 C. chopped dried cranberries and 1/2 C. chopped nuts.  They were terrific.  A nice spicey, soft drop cookie that call out "Bake me" for the holiday season.  YUMMO.......

This is identical to the Old Fashioned Soft Pumpkin Cookies recipe that can be found on the label of Libby's canned pumpkin, with the addition of cloves. I have been making this same recipe (with cloves) for years and it gets rave reviews no matter who tries them. I can't count how many times people have requested the recipe. I strongly recommend using the glaze and baking for only 12-15 minutes. Otherwise, they will be a dry cookie. And for those who rated this recipe really low, make sure you are using canned pumpkin and not pie filling. Maybe that's why you are getting "wet, underbaked middles." This is my kids' favorite cookie year-round. YUMMY!!

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  I used the glaze recipe (cut the glaze recipe in half) and put it in a sandwich bag.  I clipped the end and made the cutest designs on the cookies with the glaze.  Will make again...probably in a week b/c they'll be gone soon and they are soooo good, esp. right now for the Fall.

These cookies are so easy but look and taste professional.  One of the best cookie recipes I've found!    Based on another cook's advice, I shaped mine with a spoon.  If you spray the back of the spoon with cooking spray it won't stick and will really smooth out the surface of the cookie.

These are GOOD. I didn't even make the icing. On the last batch of cookies i put some white chocolate chips in. I also took some sugar and sprinkled it on the cookie sheet before dropping the dough on. I used a tablespoon sized cookie scoop. The dough got caught in it, so i dipped the scoop in sugar about every other scoop. This worked out perfect.

These were yummy--I brought them to work and they were gone in minutes.  One this to note-be sure to spread out the dough with your fingers (moisten fingers with a drop of water to spread more easily), or you get big cake-like type balls instead of nice flat cookies.  A good recipe, but I think the Pumpkin Cookies with Penuche Frosting recipe from this site is definitely better.

This is one of the best that I've cooked. It cooks fast, and tastes awesome! It's the perfect holiday treat. It's great that the cookies turn out doughy. I am not crazy about crunchy. The pumpkin flavor keeps it moist. And the combination of cinnamon/clove is perfect. Didn't have nutmeg, but I will be sure to add it next time. I plan on making this for Thanksgiving.

Finally a cookie that doesn't fall flat on me!! These are fabulous! The only addition I made was I added some cinnamon to the icing as another review recommended. I can't wait to make these again.

These cookies are the best!  I make a full batch and they are gone within days.  They are good with a more simple icing of powdered sugar and milk (no need to add butter) as well. A staple in our family recipe box.

Made the recipe exactly as written. A huge hit at our house! Little pumpkin cakes is a good way to describe these cookies. I had extra cream cheese frosting from another recipe on this site and frosted some of the cookies with that as another option. That version was the favorite!

Great recipe!  Not really a cookie but what I like to call little pumpkin-spice mini cakes.  They go great with coffee!  I used a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin with excellent results.  I may try adding some cranberries and walnuts to my next batch.  Great fall treat for friends and family!  Will definitely make several times this season!

Very good cake like cookie.  I made very few changes for my tastes.  I used 3 t of pumpkin pie spice because I did not have all spice on hand, and did 1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar for the cookie since I think brown gives the cookie more depth of flavor.  For the icing, I added a pinch of cinnamon for taste too.  This recipe make a lot of cookies, I counted 56 cookies from 1 batch.  Love this and will be making again real soon.

Finally! A pumpkin cookie that is soft and cakelike! Very mild flavor and not overly sweet.  I have been trying different recipes, all with disappointment, until this one!  I did not ice it because I wanted something that wasn't too sweet for my kids.  I did add about 1/4 cup of additional pumpkin puree and reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup brown sugar. Perfect!

Yum! I oopsied and added a whole 15oz can of pumpkin... i added a touch more sugar and pumpkin pie spice just in case... but I don't think it was necessary after I tasted them with frosted. The frosting is delish with these! I used a flavored coffee creamer instead of milk/vanilla. YUM!! Certainly more cakey than cookie. Give it a try!

These are fantastic!  The trick is:  do NOT put them in an air tight container or they will get soggy.  Simply cover loosely with wax paper.  Also, don't make if it's humid and don't refrigerate.

I made these twice and took them to the office I worked at.. both times everyone enjoyed them.  They remind me of Panera Bread's muffie tops, but better.  I agree that it's not a cookie consistensy, but it's still moist inside.  I also made some alterations to the recipe:

Cookie:
I used 1 whole can of pumpkin (small can)
3 tsp of vanilla (1 tbsp)
2 tsp of pumpkin spice (in addition to the other spices)

Icing:
3 tsp of vanilla
Less milk so it was thicker
Sprinkled some cinnamon

I placed the icing in a ziplock baggie like another reviewer suggested and drizzled it on (the second time I made the icing thicker and it spread better and wasn't so watery).  I only cooked them 11-13 minutes.  If you cook them too long they get dry.  I kept them in the frig so the icing would stay solid, but if you plan on serving them the day you make them then I would think it would be fine to leave them out, just don't stack them on top of each other!

I tried semi-sweet chocolate chips in some, gross.  My boyfriend suggested to use milk chocolate next time but I think just adding the chocolate was too much.. they're delicious the way they are!  Also I tried powdered sugar on top instead of icing (to make it more like a PB muffie!) but it didn't take too well.  So original recipe is for me :)

These cookies are incredible!  Tasty, moist, almost melt in your mouth! For the reviewers that think these are too 'cakey', you are probably over baking them.  These cookies it is better to not be sure and underbake them, than to overbake them.  I did not have to mash mine down, they turned out looking like a normal cookie, or a muffin top, if you know what those are.  They are wonderful without any icing drizzled on top, and I debated whether I should even make it, but that is how the recipe is written so I did it. They are still good with the icing, but I don't know if I would bother next time, the cookie can stand on its own.  I'm sure I will make these again!

These are DELICIOUS! They are fluffy and flavorful - they're very much like muffin-tops. Light and fluffy but not cakey. I reccomend using a little extra pumpkin, and maybe brown sugar in lieu of half the white. I also reccomend using CREAM CHEESE frosting instead of the glaze, and you can put toasted pecans on top of the frosting if you like. I even replaced 1/2 cup white flour with white whole wheat and they were delish!  These are a wonderful autumn - or anytime - treat!

These cookies are very moist and cakelike, perfectly spiced.  I would definitely make them again, although I would make half the amount of icing since the recipe makes a lot.  When I made the icing I used orange juice instead of milk and I would do that again next time, possibly using orange extract instead of vanilla.

Sooooo delicious!  I made the cookies smaller and got 4 dozen; remember to bake for less time if you do the same.  When they first come out of the oven, they feel like they will be crunchy and the spiciness is hard to taste, but give it time....after being in an air tight container overnight they soften right up and the flavour pops. I will make these again and again and again...

These were good...raisins would be a nice addition. I really liked the spices and the icing complemented well. I did half vanilla icing and half carob icing (same as vanilla  recipe but add 2-3 tbsp carob powder). The carob icing was a big hit.

These cookies are amazing! They're light & fluffy (more like cake), not at all sticky or heavy. I used the whole can of pumpkin for more flavor & it didn't seem to adversely affect the texture at all - it just made them extremely moist & yummy. I didn't bother with the icing (the family discovered them on the cooling racks while I was out buying the confectioners sugar... I figured why bother then??) Overall, superb... will definitely do them again... and often!

These didn't taste like I hoped, but they were still good.  They are very soft and more like muffin tops than cookies.  Recipe only makes 27 cookies, not 3 dozen as listed.

Awesome cookies! This is my first review.  Though I'm not a novice cook, I'm a bit out of practice. These were SO easy and wonderful. They turned out perfectly--sort of like muffin tops but with a more tender texture.  The only alteration I made was to  use no butter in the glaze and add cinnamon.  It worked perfectly.  I did only end up with 2 dozen, so I would recommend refrigerating the dough for a few minutes to make small cookies easier.  I was heavyhanded on the  dolloping!

YUMMY!! This recipe can stand on it's own and it's wonderful.  I like to take recipes and make them my own by changing things up and the changes were fantastic also.  A great base cookie that can be built upon.  I add 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I also swapped out 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar and added 1/4 tsp maple extract to the batter. The dough is kind of sticky but not hard to work with.  I just used my finger to push it off the spoon.  With the glaze I left out the butter and added maple extract and cinnamon.  I drizzled just a very little bit of it over the cookies because my kids found it to sweet if I used a lot.  My 10 year old made me promise not to lose this recipe :)

These cookies are autumn perfection, in looks and taste. I used allspice, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon because that's what I had at the time ... but in other batches, I've mixed it up a bit. I find the pumpkin pie spice with the allspice adds a nice depth. I also used turbinado sugar instead of white, which mellowed out the sweetness. I piped the icing on with a plastic bag for an extra festive look!

We had great expextations but we're sadly disappointed to say that these cookies/muffins/cake are bland and tasteless. We baked them for our kids at daycare and even they didn't like them! and they are not hard to please.

Yummy! These do not last long! I've made two batches. The first time I followed the recipe exactly; the second, I substituted 1/2 c. brown sugar for 1/2 c of the white sugar. My husband and I liked the second batch better.

Very tasty, cake like cookies.  I made a few changes:  I added walnuts, raisins, white chocolate chips and 1/4 teaspoon ginger.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup pumpkin and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. The addition of the chips made them sweet enough to leave out the frosting.  I will make this again and pass the recipe on!

I give this 5 stars based on the changes I made with the recipe.  Instead of sugar I used Splenda sugar blend.  I then made a buttercream frosting (stiff so it would harden on top) instead of the glaze.  Even without the glaze, these cookies are AWESOME!  I will definitely make these again.

I have to agree with other reviewers. My husband ate 1/2 dozen before I could get back to the kitchen to start the next batch! These are a definite crowd pleaser. The light and fluffy texture make people want to keep eating them. I took the rest to my bible study, and they were gone in a flash. I think I will try nuts and/or raisins in them the next time I make them. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was originally excited to make these cookies, but afterwards thought there was too much cinnamon and the pumpkin would probably be better served with a creamier icing.  They almost reminded me of gingerbread cookies more than pumpkin, but if you're into cinnamon, these are perfect.

Excellent results for the time and ingredients required. So easy and delicious. I used part cake flour, part wheat flour, pumpkin pie spice, a bit more pumpkin and chai tea instead of milk in the icing. They taste so spicy and flavorful.

Wonderful cake like cookie! Smells great while baking. Followed the recipe exactly (don't think you should rate it unless you do)and wasn't disappointed. The icing makes the cookie. Will make quite often and will probably tweak it by adding raisins and/or nuts in the future. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is excellent!  Would give it more than 5 stars if I could. My husband loved them (and he doesn't like pumpkin), his coworkers loved them (they were gone by 12N), my friend made them for her grandma's birthday and her husband's work...again, tons of compliments.  These are a winner...if you make them, you will be a hit of the holiday parties.  Thanks Gina for the recipe!

Excellent recipe- I added brown sugar instead of white and also add the cinnamon to the glaze. My daughter sold it at a side stand with hot cider and they sold out quickly. These were so good I had to make an extra batch for our family.

I had left over canned pumpkin and was looking for something to do with it.  These were great cookies! Everyone really loved them.  I did add the icing, and I think they tasted much better WITH it.  Also, i added a little cream cheese to the icing.  They were great, gone in just 3 days!

With just the right amount of sweetness from the icing and the right degree of spicy-ness in the cookie, these are a tender and easy to munch dessert.  My only problem was that the icing got ruined when I attempted to stack these.  Next time I'll try less milk.

Very tasty cookies.  Since I like things pretty spicy, I added an extra tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp of ginger.  Another hint, don't overcook!  I'll use this one again and again, I know.

Let me just add my kudos to all the others.  I made these because my husband swears he does not like pumpkin.  I can understand this seeing that I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie.  However, these cookies are wonderful!  Perfect texture - between cookie and cake.  And the recipe itself was foolproof.  A very impressive result without a lot of work!  My dough was sticky, so I flattened the cookies with a glass bottom dipped in sugar.  My husband was such a convert that he refused to take any to work. I did take some in to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  I can't wait to make these again as my contribution to Thanksgiving.

These are superb!  I did tweak the recipe a little bit. I added 1/2 cup more sugar then the recipe calls for, and I added 1/2 teaspoon ginger to it as well.  I also added 1 cup chopped walnuts and one cup raisins.  I didn't use the icing.  They turned out well.  They are very moist, very soft, but not too cakey. The best pumpkin cookies I've ever had.

Absolutely amazing! They were gone from the baking tray even before I had a chance to set them out on the table. The only thing I did different is reduce the sugar to 3/4cup. They were great.

More "cake", muffin top actually, than "cookie" but we enjoyed them all the same. Family and friends that prefer chocolate quite like these to their surprise. My adjustments: ginger instead of cloves and 1/2cup of brown sugar substituted for the same amount of white sugar.
They look pretty much the same before and after baking; so, remove any bumps if you'd like a smooth looking cookie. Yes, the sticky batter makes this harder to do - I use an icecream scoop and my fingers

I adjusted the recipe slightly. I did one cup of white sugar half a cup of brown sugar. I put cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg in the icing. They are delicious! 
Cooking time is 17 minutes to keep them from getting too dry.

These were more of a muffin top texture than a cookie. Would probably not make again. IMO cookies should be chewy or crunchy and these weren't either. Tasted fine however.

These are the lightest, fluffiest cookie I've ever made. I just tried replacing the pumpkin with 6oz of blueberry puree. I kept the nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon in, as they go well with blueberry. My only regret is that I didn't video tape my sons reaction when he tried one. They are fantastic!

These were a really good, cake-like cookie with a delicate spice and pumpkin taste. I drizzled the icing on (I cut the amount of icing in half and omitted the butter). I took them to a potluck but after an hour not one of them were gone. I think it was because they look like a plain oatmeal cookie when done, so I recommend icing them completely and sprinkling on some sprinkles to make them prettier.

I followed the cookie recipe exact - X's 2 and it yielded about 96-2" cookies. For the glaze I used just the amount in the recipe (for 36) and it was enough to give each cookie a good amount of glaze drizzle .  The cookie themselves are delightful...they keep their form well and are very soft. I made these to donate to the homeless, but will definitely be making them again!

This was a very bland cookie.  It reminded me of "health food".  My grandson (age 5) loved them but he eats everything.

The process of "gently smashing the cookie down" was difficult as the cookie dough is pretty sticky

This was AMAZING. Loved it SOOO much. I loved it because you could taste the pumpkin, but you could taste the sugar just a little bit more. My family and my friends love these cookies. But, there is no such thing as a perfect cookie. I hate the pictures because they make these cookies look so good, but then when I made them, they were good, but they looked a little weird and 2 of my cookies just fell apart. Mybe I left them in the oven to long? Who knows? I hope that this was helpful!

My kids gobbled these up in no time. I made the cookies exactly as written but varied the icing by cutting the confectioners sugar to 1/2 cup and adding in some maple syrup and a little cornstarch. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty! Definitely a favorite in my household. They're super soft and moist-make sure they cool down completely before applying frosting and keep out of an air tight container otherwise they'll end up more like a donut hole and less like a cookie. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing :)

SOOO yummy.  I just had three for breakfast because I could not keep my hands off.  I topped them with my own almond / vanilla icing and a large pecan.   I'm including these in some cookie tins I'm gifting.  These are by far my favorite cookie of the 4 types I made. They are soft, moist and fluffy.  They would taste great with a cream cheese frosting too.  The pecan on top was very tasty, I may add pieces all over the top next time.    The cookie had the  PERFECT pumpkin taste.  I chilled the batter about 30 min to make it easier to use.  I practically followed the cookie recipe to the T.  I wouldn't change a thing. 
I'm a cook, not a baker.  I did use 100% pure cane sugar.  Not sure if that makes a difference.  I used All Spice vs nutmeg cloves.  Until now when I googled what it was, I thought it was an ALL inclusive. haha.  The icing I used was a thinner icing. I didn't really want a thick layer.  I used 4TBS butter, 1/4 cup Evaporated milk (heated on stove top together), then added 2c conf. sugar and about 1/2 tsp of Almond and Vanilla extract (to taste really).  ***I'm making these a year later, 4th time in the last month.  Everyone loves them.  I frost them with cream cheese icing and top with pecan pieces.  My next attempt will be to add a little Mexican chocolate to the mix.

Brought these to work on a day when someone brought in a caterer's cookies and gourmet donuts.  My pumpkin cookies were gone first!  Everyone loved them.  Followed recipe as is - perfect.  OK without the icing, but better with it (of course).

I've done pumpkin cookies before, but not sure what I did different this time. I used a full can of pumpkin as others did, but needed to cook them for about 20 minutes on 350 and they were still almost too moist. (uncooked like) and they spread more than the reviews lead me to believe. Still fabulous cookies!! I added white chocolate chips and made the icing with maple flavor! YUMMY!!

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe indicated and they turned out amazingly! Everyone was so sick of pumpkin by the time we burned through them all. They tasted excellent even without the frosting, and they stayed soft when stored. Loved it!

Really loved this cookie and its icing. My boyfriend and I baked them together and we really enjoyed doing something like this together, and the end product just happened to be delicious as well. The only thing I could really complain about was the fact that the batter was very sticky and hard to put on the pan in a nice ball shape. It would probably be better if you used one of those watermelon ball scoops to put them onto the pan.

The texture of these cookies is excellent, and they have just the right amount of sweetness, but I do think I'll up the spices a bit the next time I bake them (I substituted ground ginger for the allspice---not a big fan).  I'm keeping them in a container on the counter loosely covered with foil and they don't seem to be getting soggy.  I also added a splash of maple syrup to the icing.

Very nice, cakey cookie - not overly sweet (which suits me just fine!). I also like the way they hold their shape & don't spread out all over the cookie sheet!  I did make a couple of minor changes: used 1 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup white, used 3tsp pumpkin pie spice plus some extra cinnamon & nutmeg (sorry, I can't say how much - just eyeballed it :-),  added 1cup Craisins, and halved the icing recipe (as recommended by another reviewer). My husband loves them without the icing; I like them both ways. Will definitely make them again!

The cookie by itself IS good! But the icing makes it. I figured out a little too late, to let the icing sit for a minute before pouring it because it drizzles a little better that way. But not TOO long because then it will harden up. I tried to space the cookies about an inch apart and they still baked together so I would probably allow about 2 inches between each. I think my batter made a little more than than 36.

I have made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe pretty closely except for adding a half teaspoon of ginger and cutting the cloves back to 1/4 teaspoon.  They were good, but icing them was a hassle, and they didn't store well, the icing would stick to the other cookies if you stacked them at all.  So, in order to see if I could make them easier to store and send, instead of icing, I added a package of white chocolate chips to the dough.  Wow, they are really good that way and much less work.  Husband and son liked them better with the white choc chips, and they loved them with the icing.  Best pumpkin cookies I have found, soft and cakey, while retaining their cookie shape.

These are pure perfect pumpkin cookies. They are so fluffy and tasty. I've not had pumpkin cookies this good. I added raisins and it's like pumpkin bread in bite size form. My husband suggested adding "drunk raisins" next time instead of plain ones by soaking them in rum. Sounds delicious to me!

What a fantastic fall recipe!  

I made this yesterday and everyone *loved* it.  I adjusted the spices, amped up the cinnamon, added clove, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, and cardamom to round out the flavor.  Added 1/3 brown sugar, 2/3 white sugar.  For the icing, I went light on the vanilla and instead added a hint of orange extract.  I heated the glaze up in the microwave to drizzle it better, which let it harden up into the perfect consistency.

My house still smells like pumpkin spicey goodness!

Tried this this weekend and my whole family loved it. I made it as is the first time but the second time I substituted half of the flour out for wheat flour, used 1/2 cup stevia, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar for the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, and I cut the glaze/frosting in half. I think they tasted just as good and it cuts some of the calories out of it. If you aren't worried about calories make this as is and if you want to cut some out do it. This is a great, great recipe!

These are really good cookies!  I did increase the cinnamon, added 1/2 teaspoon allspice and did 3/4 white 3/4 brown sugar.  I added a touch of cinnamon and pure maple syrup to the frosting...EXCELLENT.  I also tried adding chocolate chips, omitting the frosting, again very good.

These are HEAVEN in your mouth! They are SO GOOD! They taste like pumpkin bread and are so light and fluffy! With the icing on top they are to die for! Very quick & easy to make! YUMMY!!

I made the following changes to get more of that pumpkin bread taste:
-Substituted 1/2 c. sugar with 1/2 c. brown sugar
-Doubled the cinnamon 
-Doubled the nutmeg
-Added cinnamon to the icing mixture (Tasted like cinnamon roll icing!)

Here's a tip for smoother tops and a more even bake. Dip your fingers in water so they're just barely wet (you don't want puddles on your cookies) and slightly flatten the blobs of cookie dough before you put them in the oven. I tried using the back of a spoon, a glass sprayed with cooking spray, etc. but water worked the best. This gives them a nice, smooth appearance and they aren't as "domed" looking.

I added an extra half teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice because I like a lot of spice in my pumpkin. I think I could have added even more! I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting and these were delicious.

These are pretty good... I've tried them both with just 1 cup of pumpkin, and with the whole 15 oz can (~1.5 cups), and I definitely preferred it with the 1 cup. With the whole can, you need more spices to flavor the pumpkin, and the cookies come out almost too moist to hold the glaze. These cookies don't spread at all - the way they look when you put them on the pan is the way they'll come out of the oven! The dough is sticky right after mixing, so if you want nice flat cookies, give the dough time to rest before making the cookies. This amount of glaze worked well for me with some left over; I dunked the tops of the cookies in it instead of drizzling with a fork. And these definitely need frosting, they're not quite sweet enough to enjoy by themselves! Overall, a tasty cake-like cookie.

These cookies are great if you love pumpkin!! Be careful if you have a gas oven, because the bottom of the cookie will cook fast. I turned down the oven about 50 degrees and they came out great!

My son & I made these cookies and followed the recipe exactly minus the ground cloves (I didn't have any).  We had so much fun making these and my son loved icing the cookies.  You do need to flatten them out a little, they keep the shape of however they land on the cookie sheet prior to baking.  I just put a little water on my finger tips & smothed them out a little.  The dough is very sticky!  We will be making these again.

The texture of these are light and pillowy!  They are like a pumpkin cake donut!  So yum.  I made these vegan by subbing in earth balance spread for butter, flaxmeal and water for an egg, and soy milk for milk.

These cookies are FABULOUS! Everyone always raves about them. Seriously - the best. Lately, I've been making a double batch, forming all the cookie dough balls, and then freezing half of them in freezer ziplock baggies. Whenever my husband and I are craving some dessert, or we have a small dinner party, I just throw the frozen dough balls in the oven and we have fresh-out-the-oven awesomeness in 20 minutes!

These cookies are awesome!  Moist and chewy.  Put the glaze in a ziploc bag cut the tip off and squeeze out over the cookies.  Much easier to drizzle this way and you can make fun designs on top.  :)

Meh, the flavor was great but the texture was lacking. Maybe I used too much flour or overbaked?  I usually follow the directions pretty well and the recipes here have turned out for me.  These were a little tougher than other cakey pumpkin cookies I've made or eaten. Gonna try a diff recipe next time.

Delicious! I used pureed pumpkin that I made myself, so it was a little thinner than the canned stuff. I added an extra half cup of flour to make the dough a little thicker, and it turned out great!

Moist, delicious and just the right amount of spice.  The icing is also a perfect touch to these cookies. It has become a holiday must have at my house.

I was trying to re-create a cakey iced pumpkin cookie I had at the Public Market in Seattle on vacation several years ago.  These cookies were just as good as I remember.

I made the cookies as stated but used cream cheese frosting instead of the one given here. So delicious and decadent- I absolutely love these!  Because it makes so many I put them in the freezer and thaw them for a few minutes whenever I want them; they also kept well in the fridge for me.  Thanks for this recipe- it's a new favorite cookie for me!

Very good!  Soft and cakey.  I reduced the sugar a tad because I knew the icing would be really sweet... other than that I made them as-is.

Great and easy to make. While a wonderful recipe, I gave it a four because I have tried so many amazing cookie recipes on this site. If you can only take one kind of cookies to an event, I'd pick something else.

Great cookies! Crunchy on the edges, soft on the inside. Although you have to be careful not to make them to big, or they come out more like muffins.

I made these twice already and they are great. I followed the recipe for the cookies. For the icing I didn't have milk so I used half and half and it worked. My icing was pretty thick. I prefer to brush on the icing instead of drizzle it. I recommend these cookies!

These cookies are AMAZING! They don't have as much pumpkin flavor as I had hoped because the nutmeg and cloves definitely dominate but they are still delicious. The second time I made them I used half the amount of cloves and added in pumpkin pie spice. I also bake them in an upside down mini-cake pan. (I will post a picture.) I made these for my coworkers and for a family get together and they were all eaten. They are very addictive. This is a recipe I will continue using.

I needed something to use a can of pumpkin I'd dropped, and I wanted to use some shaped holiday silicone pans, so I was looking for something between a cookie and a muffin and this fit the bill nicely.

I skipped the icing; they were plenty flavourful on their own.

However I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because they're really more muffiny than cookie-ish.  Don't make this recipe and expect a cookie.

My kids demanded I make more, instead of bringing them to an event I was going to. :)
-instead of the canned puree, I used fresh puree I had frozen after halloween. 
-I tried the icing recipe, but found it too runny to drizzle nicely, it made blobs that took forever to dry. I substituted for premade icing, and it looked just as nice. 
-the cooking time I cut down to 12 minutes, as I found even 15 mins too long, and they turned out just as good. With 15 mins, they almost burned. But with 12 they were evenly cooked to a nice golden brown. 
-All in all, a very nice cookie, that remind me of muffin tops. Good as a muffin recipe as well.

These were such a hit!  I made them for a halloween pumpkin painting party and everyone complimented them, please note that I'm not known for my baking skills so this meant a lot.  My husband even asked me to make a second batch to take to work for his buddies.  

The only negative thing, actually has nothing to do with the taste of the cookie, it's just that you can't really package these or put them in containers to give to people, they're very moist and get super mushy if you put them in a baggie or rubbermaid container.  I put them in a large aluminum pan and lightly put a hard plastic top on it so some moisture could get out but not have the cookies get too hard.

Yummy!!  My daughter and I made these for a cookie swap.  They were a hit!  We also substituted 1/2 c. white sugar with 1/2 c. light brown sugar and we added mini chocolate chips.  They're really good even without the icing.  Definitely recommend doubling the recipe.  Thank you Gina!!

Made These gluten and egg free for my son with allergies.  Used EnerG egg replacer for the one egg and 2.5 cups Bob's all-purpose gluten free flour and 1/4 tsp guar (or xanthem)gum.  Ended up using most of the can of organic pumpkin, and also added white chocolate chips. Omitted the glaze.  Baked for 12 min. in a convection oven.  Good, cake-like pumpkin cookie.  The white chocolate chips was a nice addition. And bonus- finally a nice gluten/egg free recipe for my son!

everyone loved these. to do the icing i added a sprinkle of cinnamon and then put it in a ziplock back with the tip cut off to do a pretty drizzle. also added chocolate chips (semi sweet AND milk chocolate) to half the batch and they all turned out wonderful! also did as another reviewer suggested and did 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 c white sugar, 1 1/2 t cinnamon and 1 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice.

Made them with Gluten Free Pantry Flour, Soy Butter and Almond milk in the icing - Also used the whole can of pumpkin and they were GREAT!  Have to make more for christmas, as the first batch is already gone.

I love the lightness and teture of these cookies. I don't like things super sweet so I tried these cookies without the icing and I think they are quite good. I didn't even bother making the icing which I am sure is great too. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

What I changed:  I used fresh pumpkin, pureed, I used 3/4 c white sugar, 3/4 c brown sugar, only 1/8 teas of nutmeg (not a huge fan), 1/2 teas of cloves, and 2 1/4 teas of cinnamon. Everything else is as stated. I used a "scooper" to drop onto cookie sheet. It was sticky, but the end result is a perfect cookie. I don't have enough confectioners sugar, so I was going to have to try the cream cheese as others suggested, but these are SOOOOO good by themselves, I'm going to save the trouble and the calories! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Really good cookie. The icing was a must for me. Only thing to note is that these cookies are more cake-like than cookie but still really good.

These were a hit! I love that they are not dense, but very light and fluffy. The only change I made was to use butter-flavored shortening instead of butter. Everything I left exactly as the recipe called for. I will be making these again!

I made this on a whim today when I realized I already had all the needed ingredients. I didn't change at thing and absolutely loved them. They have a more cake like quality which I really love since they are filled with moisture that keeps them soft and springy. I will definitely be making these again!

Love this recipe. The cookies are light and fluffy. Just perfect. I did increase the sugar slightly and reduced a little of the flour. So yummy, good thing I am taking these to a party because I would eat all of them. yikes!

I always seem to manage messing up cookies but there came out delicious despite me! Extra star for being a unique cookie too.

I made it with honey instead of sugar and used my own pumpkin from the garden.

These cookies are amazing! The best way I can describe them is that they taste like an amazing pumpkin cinnamon roll! I just made them two weeks ago and I'm already getting requests for more. I followed the recipe but followed a couple peoples suggestion of replacing a half cup of the white sugar for brown sugar and they are delicious!

I liked the flavor of the cookie, but hated the glaze on it. The first batch absorbed the glaze completely making the cookie too soggy. The second batch fared slightly better, but I like them far better without any glaze. At my house, we call these "cake-ies" because they are like little servings of pumpkin cake! Not bad, but not my favorite.

These cookies are SO addictive! I've had them before and needed to try making them myself for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the cloves because they were SO expensive at the grocery store. It didn't matter because they turned out incredible. The icing was very strong so I might cut back on the vanilla next time but I can't wait to make them again!

WOW!!! I love a soft iced cookie and this has it all....  Took this to work and everyone raved.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Perfect as it is!  Although if I did add something is it might be interesting to use a little cream cheese in the glaze.  ENJOY! I will make these again and again.

Dee-licious!  I doubled the cookie recipe but not the icing.  Drizzled icing when cookies cooled and Wow-they are good!  I do reccomend really following the 1 tablespoon scoop recipe.  These cookies really do rise like a cake!

Absolutely delightful. I followed this recipe almost exactly. I added cinnamon to the icing and put in a piping bag and piped jack o lantern faces on the cookies. Such a Halloween hit! I also used left over fresh pumpkin which I think made it that much better. My mother in law who is the cookie queen even asked for the recipe so thanks so much!

Though I am a skilled baker, I've never made pumpkin cookies. These did not disappoint!  They are soft, delicious and perfectly spiced.  I doubled the recipe but not the glaze and, since I don't want to feed my kids an overly sugar-laden cookie, this was a good call.  Instead of covering the whole cookie in icing, which they don't need at all, we just striped and swirled some on the top of each (a perfect job for little ones).  We still had half of the glaze leftover, which just means I have to make another batch of cookies, I guess!  This is a perfect cookie, I wouldn't change a thing!

Have made and shared these cookies several times and always leave friends begging for more!  This time, we did 1/3 whole wheat and 2/3 all purpose flower.  We also used maple flavoring instead of vanilla for the frosting.  We made 100 and gave away most! Now, time for another 100 just for us!

Amazing.  Just amazing.  I'm always experimenting with different types of cookies, but this is the cookie everyone begs for the most.  I did change the recipe slightly as recommended by other reviews.  I substituted 1/2c brown sugar for 1/2c of the white sugar, I baked the cookies for 12-13 minutes instead of 15, I was far more liberal with my spices (and that includes adding it to the icing), and I drizzled the icing rather than drowning the cookie.  I've already made 3 batches since "pumpkin season" began, and I anticipate baking at least another 3-5 batches before Christmas.  It will be a hit at your Office Christmas party!

This is a great cake cookie.  I used/subsituted pumpkin pie spice for spices listed and flavored my icing with real maple syrup.  I sprinkled chopped pecans on top of icing while it was still wet.  Yummmmm!!
These are very sweet when frosted so take it easy on the icing!!!! 
My next batch will have the thinest transparant icing.

These are a great fall cookie. They are soft and cake-like and easy to make. Perfect blend of pumpkin and spice. I used a cream cheese glaze instead of the one given and it went perfectly with these cookies. And they definitely need the frosting. Too plain by themselves. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were tasty pumpkin cookies, and a nice change from chocolate chip (our family  usual favorite).  It's a softer cookie but not cakey or chewy.  Tastes a bit like gingerbread. I've made the recipe twice and everyone loves it.   On one batch I tried substituting 1/4 C flour with a mix of wheat germ and bran and they were equally well received.  My son is even going to make a batch for his class party for Halloween!  One piece of advice:  the batter remains soft and sticky even after refrigerating, so after putting a spoonful of dough onto parchment lined pan, use slightly damp fingers to round it and flatten slightly before baking.

I've been wanting to make something pumpkin-y but not the traditional pie, and these were perfect! They were a lot more cake-y than cookie, not what I expected at first, but once I had one I couldn't stop! I liked them with the icing, I also added some chocolate shavings and sliced almonds on top, so delicious. Thanks for the recipe! Great to have for those chill fall nights!

Followed the recipe as written.  The cookies were like little cakes; very soft and moist.  You can taste the delicate pumpkin flavor and the spices are not over powering.  My toughest critic, the finicky 4 year-old, had 8 cookies in one sitting!  These were great and I will be making them again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

When I was eating the dough, I thought that these would be the best cookies ever.  I didn't think so though - good texture, nice and soft, but too little pumpkin flavor.  I was disappointed. Without the glaze they would have been a total waste.  Next time I will look for ones with more pumpkin. The raw dough, however, remains a favorite!!!!
The strange thing though is my kids Love them and the kids at school beg my kids to bring them in.  Maybe because they aren't too pumpkin?? No clue.

These are yummy! More like tiny cakes, like everyone says (soft and fluffy!). I followed the recipe almost exactly (added 1/4 tsp Allspice to batter and a dash or two of cinnamon to the icing). The icing tasted better the next day. These sat out over night and they were still moist. Don't know how long they stay moist as they pretty much disappeared in less than 24 hours!

They're OK, just not my cup of tea. Definitely more like little pumpkin cakes than cookies. I don't think I'll make them again. I think they are better iced.

I only made a half batch because most of the pumpkin cookies I've made I haven't liked..  That isn't the case anymore!  These are fabulous!  I used White Whole Wheat flour and replaced the butter with applesauce and it worked so well!  I put the glaze on then sprinkled with some cinnamon for some added flavor and "good looks".  Making again!  Next time I will share!

I'm giving these a 4 star because they do taste good, but I'm not sure I would call them a cookie. They taste sort of like Tim bits (doughnut holes) or muffin tops. I'm pretty sure they would make fantastic muffins actually. 
I added a few more spices to the recipe (ginger and all spice) and used a mix of brown sugar and white, but other than that I followed the recipe. 
People at work say they're great and they're eating them up, but I'm not sure I can truly call them a cookie!

With most of these recipes I find I can cut the sugar in half and they still taste great.  I did just that for the cookie batter, and then cut the glaze in half and did only a drizzle.  I also used half whole wheat flour.  Still delicious, and less guilt-inducing!  =)

I followed the recipe but used heaping measuring spoons of the spices.  My family just found these to be really bland and walked away.  I took the many left over cookies to work and was asked for the recipe but that person said she was going to "spice them up".  Sorry, I was really wanting to be impressed.

Just made these as previous reviewers had suggested, almost an entire can of pumpkin, and cream cheese frosting (I make my cream cheese frosting WICKED with a 1:1 ratio of butter sticks to cream cheese packages). Husband loved them....sending them to work with him tomorrow so we will see what the gang says. Thanks for a delicious recipe, and they are quite cake like. Someone before said a muffin top, and that was a perfect description. Slightly dense, cake-like and flavorful but surprisingly light.

Although I wish I would of read the reviews before making so I could of known they were more like cake/muffins - I gotta say these are pretty good. I scaled down the recipe to make 24 and added butterscotch chips instead of using icing. I used brown sugar instead of white and a whole can of pumpkin, also pumpkin pie spice instead of what's listed (easier). I didn't feel like making a mess doing drop cookies so I filled greased muffin tins with a bit of the mixture and baked that way. They remind me of muffin tops rather than cookies but can't really complain!

My friends BEG me to make these cookies all year round! They are cake like and they are perfect to just open a tub and pass it around! I've been making this recipe for well over 10 years now and it just never gets old!

Delicious cookies and perfect for the holidays! Just be aware that these cookies are cake/muffin like and taste best with the glaze.

No tinned pumpkin here in Australia, so microwaved 300gms pumpkin then allowed to cool. Delicious, soft, cakey cookies. Bit hard to handle raw mix as it is so sticky. My 8 yr old says these will be a new favourite!

I’ve made these several times now.  Only change I made was that I wasn’t paying attention and used the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin rather than 1 cup called for, but the cookies still turned out great!  They make wonderfully soft delicious cookies that aren’t overly sweet. The batter is fairly thick and sticky, and the cookies don’t really spread out when baking, so I’ve made these as drop cookies, that I slightly flattened with a cup that I had coated the bottom with sugar, I’ve also just dropped spoonfuls of the batter and then sprinkled a cinnamon sugar blend over the top, and I’ve put the batter into a zip top bag, snipped a wide opening in the corner and piped these out into donut shapes (making sure to pipe thickly). They all still baked in about the same amount of time 12-15 minutes.  I’ve also added chocolate chips to the batter, and those cookies were an even bigger hit! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

i substituted ginger for the nutmeg because I didn't have any and they came out tasting very much life pumpkin pie. Last time I took them to work and they were gone in ten minutes. Great recipe!!

5 stars for a really easy recipe that yields absolutely delicious cookies. The only thing I changed was the spices: I had to almost double the amount of nutmeg and clove, I tasted the batter (I know, not recommended) and it was too sweet and not spicy enough for my taste.

Perfect pumpkin cookie recipe!  My 8-year-old asks for them all the time, even without the glaze. These only took 12 minutes to bake, and I got almost 4 dozen from this recipe.

Good recipe but if I made it again I would use LESS sugar by 1/4 to a 1/2 a cup.  Maybe it's because I substituded 1/2 cup brown sugar or maybe it's because the pumpkin already adds some sweetness, but I would highly recommend using at least 1/4 LESS SUGAR.  Otherwise they are very good, like pumpkin bread in a cookie.

Oh my word these cookies are AMAZING!!! The only things I did differently were to use 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white. I also used about 3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, plus about 1 tsp. cinnamon instead of all the separate spices. I also only baked them for 14 minutes. I made cream cheese frosting to top them with but they totally don't need it! Maybe I'll just eat the frosting by itself. . . :)

Very much like pumpkin bread, I added nutmeg because I love it.  The icing is fantastic but I had to add more powdered sugar so it wasn't too runny.  The batter does not spread so you can pack more on one cookie sheet.  These were a hit at my office cookie exchange.

Excellent cookies!  My fiance loved them!  My only issues were that I wished the pumpkin taste was stringer (I'll probably add more pumpkin next time), and that the cookies hardened/became stale very quickly.  When I baked them on Friday they were moist and cakelike, but by Saturday night they were kind of dry.

"Cookie" is a bit deceiving for the title of this recipe. They turn out more fluffy, cake-like or similar to a muffin top. Flavor is delicious. I paired them with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting that was drizzled over top. They were eaten up at a bake sale we had a work! They also stay incredibly fresh/moist when put into a sealed container.

These are perfect...as is. I was looking for a recipe that resembled the ones at a local bakery. These are so close to them that the recipe could be the same.  I didn't bother measuring the pumpkin; just used a 15oz can, which may be more than called for. Turned out great. I used a muffin scoop to drop the batter into neat little mounds, then gently pressed down to flatten. Perfect.

Fantastic cookies - I followed the recipe exactly, I just used my own vanilla bean cream cheese frosting because I had some left over from a cake.  My kids loved them, perfect consistency and taste!  Will make them again!

I simply adore this recipe...this is my second year making it as a "autumn standard" and its just too good.  I bring my extras from baking to work and my co workers can't get enough of them...I receive endless compliments and everyone always think they are from a bakery!  Almost forgot to mention...the only alteration I make is halving the white sugar and using half brown.  This year I tried a variation and replaced all the pumpkin with chunky no sugar added applesauce and used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and half of nutmeg for an "apple cinnamon" cookies...they spread a little more because the apple is wetter than pupkin but they are still delicious!

Loved these!! I made them because I had pumpkin left over from another recipe and didnt want it to go bad... and boy am I glad I did!! They are very moist and have great pumpkin flavor. The mixture of spices is perfect! They have the consistency of the "italian cookies" but the frosting and pumpkin give a nice twist to it. Will definitely be making these again!

I made some slight adjustments:  Used Cinnamon and Cloves.  Used 1 cup pumpkin as stated in recipe.  Added additional 1/3-1/2 c. flower, decreased baking  soda and powder to 3/4 teaspoon to make cookies more dense.  Used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar.  IMPORTANT:  To achieve good looking cookies, take the time to hand shape, or used the back of metal spoon to make them look good BEFORE baking.  They will look exactly as you put them in.  Though others complained about appearance, if you do that they will be great TASTING AND LOOKING.  Also, frosted with Cream Cheesey Frosting:  1 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 buttter (both room temp), 1 tsp vanilla (real).  Cream together fully.  Add 2 1/2 cups SIFTED powdered sugar ~ slowly.  Stop when it is thick, but can still be mixed with mixer.  Let cookies cool thoroughly before frosting.  Store in fridge.  They are divine, a hit with all ages and moist without being too moist.

These are amazing!  Soooo delicious!  I followed the recipes exactly and made a double batch.  I'm so glad I did because they disappeared.  They're good without the glaze - not too sweet, but they're wonderful with the glaze as well.

PERFECT for that fall craving!  These are SO good!  I followed the exact recipe.  The only addition I made was a little bit of pumpkin spice to the glaze to add a little flavor and some specs of color.  It makes A LOT of cookies which was great too.  They will be a Fall staple around here!  Thanks for the great recipe!
Sept 27,2011 revised: This morning I made these for the first time of the season and I added about 1/3-1/2 cup raisins. SO good!  I will put this on my recipe card and do it everytime now.

I think these cookies are both great tasting and super easy! Like others I added pumpkin pie spice to the glaze. Both my little guys ( age 5 and 2) loved these, we made them to enjoy on our yearly "Great Pumpkin" movie night.

These cookies are delicious as is, but if you like more flavor add more spice (a little of allspice/ginger does the trick).  I usually add cinnamon and a dash of vanilla to the glaze as well.  Will store for a few days out on the counter quite nicely.

I really enjoyed this cookie. I also substitued 1/2 c. brown sugar in place of all white sugar. Very moist. Enjoyed without the icing.

These are absolutely delicious!!!!  Made them exactly as written and probably ate a dozen's worth of just the dough!! Made them on Sunday and have been asked to bring them to a party on Saturday.  Not keeping them in an airtight container is a good tip, as they get really mushy if you do.  These will be a regular holiday cookie!!!!!

followed the suggestion of 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. also added maybe a tsp of cinnamon to the glaze and swapped the vanilla extract for maple. my mom said it reminded her of the pumpkin scone from starbucks!

Really, one of the tastiest cookies I have ever baked. I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving this year (it made A LOT) and I forgot to double the icing, but it didn't matter: there was plenty of icing for both batches - I will remember this next time so I don't waste sugar and butter! Everyone wanted the recipe. :) With the few leftovers, they made perfect breakfast cookies. Almost like a scone. I left about four un-iced for fun, and they were just as yummy!

These cookies are truly delicious.  Very cake-like and light.  My boyfriend requested that I make them again.. and again.  3 times in 2 weeks!  The only suggestion I would make pertains to the icing recipe.  If you intend to only drizzle the icing (rather than fully ice them), halve the icing recipe.  It's far too much.  The first time I made them, I ended up throwing quite a bit of it away.

Absolutely wonderful! Kind of a cross between a cookie and a cake. Nicely spiced and I did have to thin the icing a bit. I can't wait to make again, even though they are a little time consuming to make. This is a KEEPER!!!

These cookies got mixed reviews. I thought they were a little bland but they grew on me nontheless (liked the texture), a few people didnt care for them, and others thought they were one of the best cookies they had tasted...Good: they stayed mosit, and had a great texture. What I would change: I might had more spices in the future to give them a strongr flavor.

So disappointed in what I thought would be a delicious cookie. Followed the recipe *exactly* as written. Texture is as anticipated - very cakey - but the only thing that gives this cookie flavour is the overly sweet icing. Other than that, just a very bland & boring cookie. Only gets one star because 0 stars isn't an option.

These were absolutely wonderful and I wouldn't change a thing. I was a little concerned that they would be tough when I first removed them from the oven but one bite convinced me - they are deliciously tender and I will absolutely be making them again! Perfect when you want something not-so-cloyingly-sweet.

STOP! You don't need to look any further, these are by far the BEST pumpkin cookies EVER! Thanks Gina for sharing.  I used one of the pie pumpkin I grew, boiled and pureed, great fresh flavor.  As other reviewer suggested, I used 3/4 c. each brown and white sugar, pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, also added a heaping TBLS. cream cheese to the icing. I will be making this again and again.

WOW!!!  These cookies are absolutely DELICIOUS and very easy to make!  They're soft, moist, and full of wonderful spices!  Your whole kitchen will have a pleasant aroma to make it really feel like the fall season.  One of my dearest friends (Gail) is coming to visit tomorrow so I wanted to have a special treat for her, and this recipe did the job!  I just recently started baking as a hobby (so I'm no expert) and if I can make these cookies, then anybody can!  Here's what I did to alter the original recipe:  (1) I added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and I combined 3/4 cup brown sugar with 3/4 cup white sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar); (2) I also added some pumpkin pie spice to the glaze; (3) I didn't flatten my cookies because I like the more rounded shape at the top of the cookie; (4) I baked them for 14 minutes (instead of 15-20 minutes) which made them taste more moist.  I was so excited about these cookies that I took pictures of them with some pumpkins in the background!  I will definitely make these cookies again very soon because the batch I baked today will be gone by this weekend!  Thank you to Gina (also my sister's name), who submitted this popular recipe!  My mom (Lety), who doesn't even like pumpkin, enjoyed these cookies.  My husband (Trevor) can't wait to come home from work to try them!  Oh, one more thing...they're AWESOME right out of the oven!  Eat them while they're warm with a cold glass of milk!  This is definitely a comfort food!!!

I made these as listed, with the exception of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon instead of the ones given. They were awesome! My icing wouldn't set enough to stack them though - but it was probably just a result of it being so humid here. They weren't around long enough to need storing anyway ^.^

The cookies are good but nothing exceptional.   High in calories.  Dropping by Tbls full was a bit deceiving as the cookies are much larger than the 36 servings indicated.   I used Splenda to cut calories.

Love them! I don't usually like pumpkin but I loved these. I did change a few things based on other reviews: 1. 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar 2. Add 2 tbsp of cinnamon to glaze 3. Decrease cook time to 14 mins 3. Top with crushed pecans  Yummy!

I'm glad I went to buy the ground cloves for this recipe.  It gives the cookies and little kick.  The icing is great too and looks wonderful.

Delightful flavor, baked up beautifully, total muffin-top texture!  -In order not to add to my own "muffin-top", I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter and did 1 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup turbinado sugar.  Absolutely recommended, I think these will be a big hit with the hubby and the girls at work.  Thanks!

Absolutely oustanding, texture and flavor - a good way to get your veggies too.  I modified the recipe slightly by halving the butter from 1/2 cup down to 1/4 and substituted 1/4 of unsweetened applesauce.  This brings down the portion fat to 1.75 grams per serving. I would add a pinch of orange essence to the icing to give it a little zip...therefore less sweet.  I also added one or two chocolate chips for decoration. This would be fun for kids -- domino cookies! This cookie recipe is great for Halloween or Christmas! Well done. A hit with me and great for sharing - I gave a tin of cookies away today along with the recipe!  Nessie

These are delicious.  I made with freshly roasted pie pumpkin and the flavor is nice and subtle (would probably just go for the can next time!).  Also used the glaze recipe from another pumpkin cookie - caramel glaze just sounded so good.  Have a feeling these will be gone soon and I'll have to make more.

Yum Yum Yummy!  These are so easy and delicious.  I went by the recipe except I substituted in one cup of whole wheat flour.  Probably added too much milk into the frosting but I definitely will have another shot as I plan on making these again.  Thanks Gina for a great recipe!  Thanks to Chobunny for some beautiful photos and suggestions.

I accidently used the pumpkin pie mix instead of just canned pumpkin - but they still turned out great!

These are wonderful!! I didn't use cloves and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. I put the icing in a ziploc bag and cut the tip to decorate them easier. Also, I used a small scooper to place them on the cookie sheet, which allowed me to make about 60 perfect sized cookies instead of just 36. Everyone loved them!

I can't tell you how good these are!  I made this recipe as written except I only put in 1/2 tsp ground cloves and that was perfect.  Any more than that and it would have been overpowering.  Everyone that tried these loved them including my picky kids.  I made the glaze that is on the "Pumpkin Cookies V" recipe that has brown sugar in it and OMG it is the best!  I turned the cookies upside down and dipped the tops in the glaze.  These cookies are so soft and moist and they didn't dry out even after being in a sealed container for 3 days.  I now have 3 people asking for the recipe just from the first batch.  These are now one of my favorite cookies.

Fabulous. Per other reviewers, 1 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown. Also used applesauce instead of butter (diary allergy in the family). They tasted like pumpkin spice muffin tops! My bible study gobbled them right up.

OMG...these are amazing! Who the heck needs chocolate when you have these delectable morsels! I've been making these for about a year and I have to say they truly are our favorite cookie. I use fresh sugar pumpkin, grown in our garden, and bake it in the oven then puree it. I also use all dark brown sugar instead of the white and they only need to cook for 13 minutes. Sometimes I ice them, but they really don't need it...they're that good! Gina, you are the cookie goddess in our household! Thanks for our most loved cookies!

Absolutely delicious :)  Very moist and flavorful, and tasted great without the glaze, so I made half unglazed and half glazed.  Both excellent!  Didn't change the recipe at all.  Five stars :)

These cookies are absolutely delicious!!!  If you enjoy them, raisins make a wonderful addition to the recipe.  I stir in 1/2 to 1c after the rest of the ingredients are mixed.  Another change up for this recipe is using brown butter icing:  Brown 6T. butter and let cool till warm.  Add 1 tsp. water and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Add powdered sugar until desired consistency.

Nothing says Fall like pumpkins. These cookies were a hit with my daughter and myself. My husband and son did not care for them, but they also don't like pumpkin pie. I wanted to make these spicer so instead of the spices the recipe calls for, I used 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice (Pumpkin Pie Spice II from this site) and 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice in the icing, minus the butter. I baked a few cookies with chocolate chips in them but we didn't like them that way. These are awesome cookies...for a pumpkin lover.

Just made these and LOVE them!  I am positive they would be perfect as is but I did make the following changes.  I used half a cup brown sugar and the rest white rather than all white.  Also used equivalent (3 tsp) of pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices cause honestly, I'm lazy!  I added approx. 1/2 c. chopped pecans which added a nice flavor and crunch to balance the cakiness of the cookie.  Finally for the top, rather than the icing I used a whipped cream cheese frosting from the store.  It was lighter than traditional frosting and added the right amount of sweet.  Personally I love the fact that they are more of a "muffin top" because I frequently have breakfast staff meetings that we bring things to share and these will be perfect with a cup of coffee.  One final thought, to help with the sticky dough, I refrigerated it and used a cookie scoop (looks like mini ice cream scoop) to make them more uniform in size and easier to handle.

Not exactly sure where I went wrong with this.  The batter was moist but when I baked them, they turned out super dense.  Like others suggested, this would taste better with a cream cheese frosting.  The flavor of the cookie was good but I didn't care for the texture.

I swapped the 1/2c. butter for 1/2c. no sugar added applesauce. I had to add another 3/4c of flour as the dough was pretty much batter. The end result was a cake like, thick cookie. Do not forgo the glaze - it makes the cookie! I also used equal amounts of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the seasonings listed. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe at Thanksgiving and it received rave reviews.  I've since had people ask me to make these cookies over and over again.  Definitely a keeper.  I added just a little bit more pumpkin and baked the cookie for 15 minutes.  It was the perfect baking time.  The cookie does have a more cake like texture to it.  The glaze is what really works for this cookie.

I was excited to make these from all the good reviews it received.  I made them over Thanksgiving break and we didn't care for them.  Even my husband who loves pumpkin didn't care for these.  I followed the recipe exactly too.  They were too "cakey" were my husbands words.  Maybe they would have been better with the icing but alone, they were not very good.  Sorry, but I will continue to look for a recipe for a pumpkin cookie that we like.

I love this recipe so I didn't make any major changes just small tweaks. I sub a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg, use 1c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar instead of 1 & 1/2 c white, and use 2 tsp vanilla. Instead of icing them I added 1 c of dark chocolate chips into the dough then drizzle with chocolate after completely cooled. My husband and I LOVE the combo of pumpkin and chocolate and these make the most amazing pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. Thank you for this recipe its just great!:)

These are absolutely amazing.  Everyone loves them!  I make them differently every time and they always turn out.  I add more spices and a little more pumpkin.  Also, instead of milk, I use coffee mate 'Cinnamon Bun' to make the frosting.  It's absolutely delicious that way.  Even folks that don't like pumpkin tend to enjoy these!

I was looking for a cookie that tasted like one from a bakery that I love but this wasn't it.  It was however very good but I think it may be better with a cream cheese icing.

fantastic cookies and SO easy--I did use 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar instead of using all white sugar and I was a little generous with my vanilla--I didn't get a chance to ice them they went so fast! Maybe next time ;)

I did make a number of small changes, but have no doubt that the original recipe was just as yummy!  We really enjoyed these, and they kept well for a couple of days before losing their freshness a bit.  As far as changes, I halved the nutmeg and cloves (really don't care for too much spice), and I really felt like it was still plenty fall-spicy.  I cut the white sugar to one cup, and added 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I also added a little cinnamon to the icing as other reviewers suggested, which looked nice.  I drizzled the icing over the cookies, then dipped a few so that the entire top was covered.  In my opinion, you really only need to drizzle it - the cookies are great alone, and the drizzling adds a nice sweet touch.  The ones that were covered were almost too sweet.  Also, you really only need a half batch of icing.  I had tons left!  Lastly, I used a cookie scoop to drop balls of dough onto the sheets, and didn't flatten them at all.  They definitely flattened a bit from their ball shape in the oven, and turned out beautifully.  I guess everyone's experiences are different!  Great recipe, can't wait to make them again!

My whole family loved this recipe, even the in laws!  Most reviewers opted for the cream cheese frosting, but I used the recipe for the recommended frosting and it turned out great.  I just dipped the top of the warm cookie in the frosting instead of spreading it on, much easier and it gives it a cool cinnamon roll look.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! ~ Even my very picky husband gave his thumbs up!  I did some changes:  like the other reviewer, I substituted 1/2 C of sugar for brown sugar,but cut the regular sugar by 2-3 Tbs (1 cup minus 2-3 Tbs sugar, cos' we don't like our sweets to be TOO sweets), I used a full 15oz can of pumpkin.  For the glaze I added a 3 oz soften cream cheese, cut the confectioner's sugar to just 1 C (so that you can taste the cream cheese and not just sugar).  I also dipped my fingers in water (to prevent sticking) to smooth top of the cookie out before putting it into the oven.  Taste fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! Definitely hits the spot if you are looking for a "Fall" themed treat. I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 2 tsps. of pumpkin pie spice...

I gave the cookie recipe 5 stars, however I frost the cookies with a brown sugar cooked frosting.  I can't keep them in the kitchen and I get at least 1 call a week from friends or family requesting a couple dozen.  I made 72 of these just last night!!

Fantastic!! I have never had a pumpkin desert that I liked until I made these! My husband wanted me to make him a pumpkin pie and I made these instead. They are addictive! Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow what a way to kick of the beginning of Fall!  These are amazing.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate ones.  I added a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tbsp of pumpkin puree to the glaze and sprinkled finely chopped pecans on top of the cookies right after I applied glaze.  Couldn't taste the pumpkin in the glaze that much, but it did turn it a lovely color.

I made this recipe for a family get together and they were a TREMENDOUS hit!! My family is very picky about what they eat, so it has to be yummy. Everyone asked for the recipe and they were gone within 30 minutes. Instead of the glaze the recipe calls for, I made a cream cheese icing and sprinkled cinnamon on top. They were wonderful-great texture, flavor, and consistency. Just "heavenly." They are also great with a hot cup of coffee for breakfast. You must try this recipe!!

A great autumn treat. Lovely and soft are these cookies. The spices are not too strong so kids will like them. They go great with a cup of tea or glass of milk.

These cookies are a.maz.ing. Only thing different I did was sub mashed cooked sweet potatoes for the mashed pumpkin.  They cooked up perfectly, nice and moist. And I drizzled the frosting over the cookies which made them SO beautiful. Really not a hard cookie to make but it looks like you spent a lot of time on it. This is going in my "keeper" file. Thank you to the person who shared this. I'm terribly grateful.

These cakelike cookies are awesome.  Everyone in the family,with the exception of a picky 4 year old, loved these.  I did ice some rather heavily and some with a drizzle.  The most popular were the drizzled ones (the icing is very sweet).  This recipe is defintely a keeper and I will be making these again!

These cookies are awesome the first day and only improve in the next couple of days!  One caveat though - if you are baking at a high altitude (as I am, almost a kilometre up), reduce the amount of leavening.  Seriously.  The first time I made these, they tasted fine but looked like ugly little mountains.

yummy yummy yummy!!!!

These were perfect! Even better the next day! I followed the recipe exactly, and took them out after 15 minutes.  Next time I would add more cinnamon.

Definitely would make these over and over and over again!

These were pretty good cookies, nice and cake like. They were much better tasting fresh. The only bad thing about them was that they were quite hard the day after making them, and then you can't reheat them since the icing melts.

These were more on the spiced side than the sweet side. I was looking for sweet so maybe that's why I didn't think they were that great.

I just made my THIRD batch of these fabulous cookies! I have given them away to friends and brought them to a school event where they were gobbled. One man, an army drill sergeant tough guy, took one bite and said "Who made these!?"
I have been asked for the recipe by everyone. 
I added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice to mine and used only brown sugar and they turned out fabulous.
Thanks to the other reviewers, I was given the heads up to watch out for the stickyness of the dough, so using wet hands, I rolled the dough into balls, flattened with my palms and placed the discs carefully on the cookies sheet. They look MUCH nicer this way. All rouned out and nicely shaped.  A little extra trouble, but worth the pretty results!!
GREAT RECIPE!!  Thanks Gina!

I am only 14 and have recently gotten into baking. I would have to say that these were the BEST thing that I have made so far. The cookies were soft and cakelike. In the icing, I used soymilk instead of regular milk and it turned out great. The spices in these cookies make them taste fantastic! I think small children would enjoy these as much as I did, and I know my mom and grandparents loved them as well. They are very difficult to stop eating, and even good the next day. I would say that everyone has to try this recipe.

Awesome, Awesome Cookie!  I first tasted them at a pumpkin farm.  I tried to find a recipe like them and this is it! I used half brown and half white sugar.  Also I added a half teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I iced them with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious!

I liked the recipe and the cookies tasted really good- not fantastic, but good. A change I made was to substitute pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and cloves, only because thats what I had. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. The cookies don't spread while baking at all so the size you plop them on the sheet as is the size they come out. I personally thought that the recommended tablespoon size was too small and made mine bigger.

I asked my husband how many stars I should give, and he said "as many as there are!". I used half brown half white sugar instead of all white. I made 12 cookies out of the whole batter, and they took 18 minutes to cook perfectly. Thank you!

I made some changes to this recipe and they still turned out great! I added 1/2 tsp of allspice to the dough, old fashioned oatmeal for added texture, and butterscottch chips. I rolled the dough in sugar before baking because I had no confectioners sugar for the icing and they looked and tasted great! Thanks so much and good luck!

OMG! These are the best! I added extra spices as other reviewers suggested and also added 1 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of the 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I added cinnamon in the glaze also as recommended. I used a cookie scoop and moistened my fingers, dipping them in sugar before lightly pressing them down on the pan.  This kept the dough from sticking to  my fingers as it is very sticky. The little bit of sugar didn't hurt the cookies with the glaze on top.  My husband will definately want these again.

What a great little cookie for making in the Fall. The dough is sticky so I just had to smooth out the best I could with my fingers but they turned out pretty anyway. I like them best with the glaze (looks like frost on the pumpkin)I got a little over 4 dozen cookies and cooked mine for about 16 minutes. Good with a cup of coffee. I used a pastry brush to paint on the glaze. This is a soft cake like cookie.

I make these for my college kids and their friends - it is the #1 favorite hands down.  I put maple syrup and maple extract in the frosting to add a different flavor.

the perfect cookie - not too sweet. I used cream cheese icing instead and they were AWESOME! We had a small group of high school guys over and they were gone within minutes!

These cookies are fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and they are sheer perfection. The texture is cake-like and moist, with an exterior crust that holds up to the icing. I normally make modifications to recipes I find online, but this one doesn't need a thing changed. This is definitely going into my collection of favorites!

I added a maple flair to this recipe. Instead of the vanilla extract, I added 1tsp of real maple syrup and then  substituted the white icing glaze for a maple glaze made from brown sugar, butter and maple syrup. Also the recipe made more than expected - about 48 cookies. Perfect for gift giving. Delicious!

I have made these the past two years for fall desserts. My husband requested them so he could share them at work! This time, I made a batch with chocolate chips and they turned out well. Based on other reviewers success, I added about a teaspoon of pure maple syrup to the icing and it was delicious!

I've made this recipe two Halloween's in a row now and it is just delicious.  Soft mounds of spicy pumpkin beneath sweet icing.  I didn't change anything with the cookie recipe, but I added a little maple syrup to the icing for added flavor.  This one is a definite keeper!!

I should have listened to reviews about the cake-like consistency.  Although these were good, they are NOT cookies.  Instead it should be called Pumpkin Bread and cooked in a bread loaf accordingly.  I was disappointed and will have to keep searching for that perfect cookie recipe!

I hate giving ratings of less than 5, but this cookie recipe did not impress me all that much. Like some other reviewers, I found this to be too cake-like. The taste was okay. The only change I made was reducing the cloves from 1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp since I don't like cloves. The cake-y/muffin-y texture made it seem undercooked. Also, the icing was too sugary, and I couldn't get it to drizzle even after adding more milk. I'm almost never impressed w/ high-rated recipes, maybe b/c I have such high expectations for the recipe after reading the reviews. I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again.

Wow. That's the only word to describe these autumn morsels. The flavor is GREAT! I only gave it 4 stars because I'm going to experiment with the recipe to make the cookie more solid...I'm not a huge fan of cake-y cookies. But otherwise it's superb!

Excellent! These are definitely worth the 5 stars.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe and these turned out delicious.  My only warning is don't store them in a closed container (e.g. tupperware) because they will get very soggy.

Wonderful recipe! My co-workers keep asking me to make them again.  I added a 1/4 teaspoon of ginger to the recipe.  10x confectioners sugar is better than 4x.  Once you mix the frosting, just turn the cookies upside down and skim them across the frosting.  Fast and easy!  I got this hint from another reviewer for this recipe.  Yum!

I thought these were okay, as they got stale very fast.  I might change the icing recipe also, as it didn't look very pretty once it dried.

What an awesome recipe, I've made this recipe every Fall for the past couple of years.  These cookies are kinda puffy, but don't let that persuade you.

Hints:  I took someone else's advice (JZPHSMOM) and they came out perfect.  

The addition of the O.J. and zest as well as the allspice and orange crasins was well worth it, WOW, what a difference! Happy Holidays to everyone! 

A big thanks to JZPHSMOM and Gina for a wonderful recipe!

I wish I would have frosted them fully rather that drizzle frosting. Other than that, great cookies. Lots of compliments!

These were simply amazing!  I really enjoy pumpkin pie, so I was excited to make these cookies.  I'm really happy how they turned out.  All three batches that I have made have all came out wonderful.  I cut back on some butter and sugar.  I also added some extra spice (especially cinnamon) as advised through other reviews.  I also made the glaze, which was plentiful and a sweet touch to the cookies.  Thank you for sharing!

I'm not usually fond of soft cookies but these are great. They are more like a spicy tea cake than a cookie. I had to make two batches yesterday and they are almost all gone! Everyone from my neighbor's 2 year old to a 70 year old friend loved them. Thanks so much!

Good cookies, even better the day after baking once the flavors have blended. I found they only needed 12 minutes to bake and I only needed half the amount of icing for drizzling on top.  Next time I will add ground ginger.

Excellent cookies!  Were even better with the icing, but still very good without.  Will probably make icing a little thicker next time, so that more will stick to cookie.  Will be making for Thanksgiving this year.

YUM!!  I accidentally threw 1 cup of the sugar in with the dry ingredients, so just creamed the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with the butter and proceeded.  They turned out exactly like the photo, so soft and wonderful.  They were gone in less than 24 hours!  I will definitely double it next time (that will use the whole can anyway as each can has 2 cups pumpkin).

These were awesome, although I didn't make cookies I just put it in a 9x13 pan. I used 1cup of sugar instead of 11/2 C & had about 1/3 cup of applesauce leftover(threw it in). Next time I might add nuts, raisins and or coconut.....

These were great!  Also I ran out of time and my husband suggested making bar cookies.  Well, it turned into one of the best cakes I have ever tasted.  And my husbad put butter on it and ate it as bread.  So I'm going to make mini-loaves of it for Christmas gifts.  Thanks for the recipe

These are wonderful cookies -- only changes are:  add 1/4 tsp ginger to recipe.  Add 1/4 tsp cinnamon to glaze for nice color.  Cook 13-15 minutes.  When slightly flattened, these come out shaped like little pumpkins.  Great for fall.

I, like others, found a can of pumpkin in the pantry and looked for a pumpkin cookie recipe.  I chose this because of the "iced" part. (My kids favorite!)  My Husband Loved these! He gave a few to his workers and they also loved them.  My 10 year old came home from school and said what did I make and I said pumpkin cookies.  He said - gross. I said try one. He said they look disgusting.  I said don't be deceived by looks.  He continued to eat about 5 of them. And I also loved them.  Thank you for a great spicy soft cookie recipe that's a little sinful at the same time!

Sorry all, I am a HUGE pumpkin fan, and I was disappointed in this cookie. I liked the "cake-like" texture, but it's missing something.  Add the raisins and the nuts. I'd try it with a cream cheese icing,,,,,this icing has too much vanilla in it.

This recipe was sooooo good.  My husband said they taste just like you are 
eating pumpkin pie.  The best part is that I took it to a pumpkin bake off at our
church's Pumpkin Festival and I won first place.

Gina--Thank you soooo much.  My mom lost the recipe for the pumpkin cookies she used to make, and I missed eating them for 10 years.  This recipe is it...I no longer have to miss the wonderful taste and memories that these cookies bring back..

These cookies are good.  I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  They were a little sticky spooning them on the cookies sheet, but well worth the effort.

Great tasting recipe! Instead of using the icing recipe, I used a store bought (Betty Crocker's) Vanilla icing. It turned out to be a great balance of sweetness! I got many requests for the recipe!

OH MY GOODNESS. I AM NOT A BIG PUMPKIN EATER. I DIDN'T THINK I LIKED PUMPKIN UNTIL I BAKED THESE COOKIES FOR MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL AND I HAD TO TRY ONE, THEN I TRIED ANOTHER, AND ANOTHER AND SO ON. THEY DON'T HAVE A REAL BIG PUMPKIN TASTE, MORE OF A SPICE FLAVORING. THEY WERE TERRIFIC. I HAD SEVERAL OF THE PARENTS ASKING FOR THE RECIPE.

Regarding the quantity of pumpkin.  The first time I made these I accidentally used the whole can of pumpkin....not just one cup as called for in the recipe.  The second time I made them I (correctly) used one cup of pumpkin.  They were very good, just different than the first batch...not quite as moist, not quite as flavorful.  So the bottom line....the recipe is great as written.....but with a whole can of pumpkin they are amazing.  (FYI, the dough is sticky to work with..but it’s worth it.  Also, I put cinnamon in my icing/glaze)

I thought these were pretty awesome!  I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the nutmeg and cloves (plus the cinnamon).  I sprinkled with sugar befor baking because I find glaze too sweet.   They were a huge hit with my husband!

They were a big hit at my work party. I found them only mildly spiced and may add a bit more nutmeg and cloves next time. Still delicious!

Be careful...there is pumpkin puree and next to it on the store shelf is pumpkin pie filling.  The first time I made this I used pumpkin puree as the recipe lists, and the second time I accidentally bought and used a can of pumpkin pie filling, which has sugar added to it already and is more runny.  The pumpkin puree version of this recipe is not as sweet, of course, and makes a more plump cookie, and tastes more like a pumpkin bread.  The second batch with the pumpkin pie filling was sweet like a cookie, since I still added the sugars, and it was more runny, so I added a little more flour and baking soda and powder.  They spread out more on the pan. I greased the cookie sheet well each time, but they still kind of stuck to it, and stuck together when cooled, so I had to put waxed paper in between them..  My husband liked both versions - the first as a more thick, plump pumpkin bread type cookie with icing, and the second as a sweeter cookie that did not need icing.  I did change the recipe to use 1 cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar.

I have made these twice already, love them!  My daughter says they taste like a pumpkin muffin, only smaller.  So moist and easy to make.  I live in a high elevation and usually have to adjust cookie recipes but I didn't have to on these, love that!  I made them the first time with the cream cheese frosting and once with a glaze, both were great, although the kids prefer the cream cheese. I added chocolate chips to some and left the others plain and chose to use brown sugar instead- thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out great. I made a quick batch for a Friendsgiving event.  I used a medium cookie scoop and the first batch in the oven came out very round and puffy (still delicious) but if you smoosh it like the instructions they will look a little larger and more spread out.  I think it makes a great base for a cream cheese icing or any kind of icing you prefer too!

Made it as-is with the frosting. Apparently I haven’t mastered the art of drizzling so I dipped the tops in the frosting instead. We tried baking at 17, 16, and 15 mins. We liked the 15 minute cookies the best.

I will most definitely make it again. All I changed was the sugar (replaced the 1-1/2 cup white for 1 cup brown) And used pumpkin pie spice because I did not have all the other ingredients on hand. Delicious, didn't even needed the icing, but I made it anyway. Next time I won't make the icing, it made them too sweet for my taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe, my family loved it!

I really like this recipe. I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers in which I used about 14oz of pumpkin, added a bit more cinnamon, and substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added a dash of ginger. Then I added semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of doing the glaze. They turned out great! I usually find the recipes for pumpkin choc chip cookies bland so I chose to use a pumpkin spice recipe and it did not disappoint. I suggest using this recipe with the changes.

Delicious! Made them gluten free with a flour blend we use for baking. Other than that I followed the cookie recipe. I used the frosting recipe from Pumpkin Cookies V (butter, brown sugar, milk, vanilla, confectioners sugar) and added 1 tsp cinnamon. On my fall favorites!

I made the recipe as is and with a couple of the suggestions from previous reviews, and they were delicious either way. I personally liked them better using 1 cup dark brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, and keeping them in the oven for 12 min (rather than 15-20), letting them cool for 2 min in the baking sheet.

I would give this ten stars!! I read other reviews and added brown sugar. So I did 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Also I added cinnamon to the icing. I brought these as a dessert for Thanksgiving dinner. But they somehow became an appetizer. They were almost gone before the turkey was done!

Wonderful cookie, cakey with a little bit of a chew to it! I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices (as mentioned by another reviewer), and it worked great. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. For the glaze, I cut the confect sugar back by about 1/2 cup and the other ingredients accordingly. I added a little cinnamon to the glaze which was a nice touch. UPDATE: Note to self....remove from oven at 12-13 min.

These cookies are magnificent, and both kids and adults ask me to bake them again and again.  I use an entire can of the pumpkin (which is pretty close to what the recipe calls for, I think),  but my big trick is tripling the spices.  The cookies need more cinnamon, nutmeg, and especially clove *Boom*  to be autumn fabulous,  and tripling the spices works well; sometimes I shake in even more spice beyond tripling. 
Try making them in greased mini cupcake tins too.  They come out cute and very easy to serve – – just cool and then  drop them into mini cupcake papers. 
ALSO--I renamed them--haha! Because they rise and have a wonderful (and somewhat cake-like) consistency--which people love(!), they don't really seem like cookies, so I call them "Iced Pumpkin Tea Cakes" which seems to make people even more excited to try them.

I just joined this website specifically to leave a review on these cookies.   I really love these.  I use homemade pumpkin puree and make 2 double batches during the holidays every year and they are gobbled up.  I made these once last year with canned puree and that was the first and last time I will ever do that.  It's just not the same.  They are soft, tender, moist and very cake-like.  The first time I made them I thought I had messed them up because the dough is much softer than the typical cookie dough (at least for the limited cookie recipes I made), but that is how it's meant to be.   Spices can be kicked up or dialed down to your preference.  I don't care for cloves so I put 1/2 as much in as the recipe calls for, but if you like a lot of spice you can add more of everything or even add in ginger to really pump up the spice aspect of the cookies.   These also absolutely need the icing.  It's a recipe for an iced cookie so if you leave off one of the components, it's not how the cookie was meant to taste.  It really needs the extra sweetness of the icing and the glazed texture on top is really nice.

I followed the recipe and these turned out great! Cake-like but not heavy or slimy (you know what I mean) later. I frosted them and they were great, but I ate plenty without icing. This is a great fall-winter cookie. Just perfect.

These were a BIG hit. Very soft and even decent without the icing. A no miss for pumpkin lovers.

Adjustments:

Rather than using the spices listed in the recipe I used 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice

These come out more like little cakes than cookies, but they are little puffs of heaven.  Very light and so delicious.

I made these for Thanksgiving everyone love them. The recipe called for pumpkin but I substitute it with sweet potato and it was the bomb. My family said it was soft like tea cakes. I'm making these for Christmas since they were such big hit. Thanks for the recipe allrecipe.com

I make these every December and they last for weeks. I usually make a full batch of dough and then keep half in the fridge to bake up when the first ones are gone. Very forgiving recipe and everyone really loves them. They're like little cakes.

I just made these tonight and WOW.  This is almost cake like it is so soft and moist, to me not the everyday traditional "cookie".  This was very easy and delicious.  Making this glaze I had cream cheese but I did not leave it out to soften, so I put 4oz.(half a brick) of it in a bowl and microwaved it for about 30 seconds to soften.  I then added the melted butter which added heat and stirred them together until mixed.  I then added the rest of the glaze ingredients.  I am not huge pumpkin lover, but these were REALLY good.  I am not a fan of hard cookies and these did not disappoint.  Before I knew it I had eaten 3 of them.  Like the other reviewer said these are DANGER DANGER!  I will be putting this one in the keeper folder of my recipe book.  Thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly, and not only do these cookies taste great and are light and fluffy, but they made my house smell amazing! Make them on Christmas Eve day, and your kiddos will have sugar plums dancing in their heads all night long :)

Loved these cookies! I stayed pretty true to the recipe, and the only thing I did differently was using some brown sugar in place of white. A word of warning: the dough is EXTREMELY sticky and loose, almost like a muffin dough. This was one of those times when I was really happy to have bought a spring-loaded cookie scoop! It made measuring this beast of a dough a breeze, and the cookies ended up looking beautiful (yes, I'm slightly neurotic, too)! The glaze was delicious too, but I put on half the cookies only, for the sake of variety. Thank you Gina!

Just finished icing these... turned out delicious, like a cakey cookie version of pumpkin pie.  Followed the cookie dough recipe exactly.  Glaze - added a dash of cinnamon and ended up using about half the milk.
I'm neurotic, so here are some aesthetic suggestions:
These are not a drop cookie.  The dough is wet/sticky but it sets exactly as you put it on the cookie sheet.  So my first batch turned out 'rustic' looking (like mini-scones) because I thought they'd smooth out in baking.  My work around was to let the dough sit on the cookie sheet and the edge dry a bit, then you can form it/smooth it... turned out much nicer looking.  Also these stay very moist so be careful if you stack them.. they tend to stick together.

This is my go-to pumpkin cookie recipe.  I have made this many times before and it is always a hit.  I never know what to call them though because people expect cookies to be crunchy or chewy and these are neither.  I've settled on "pumpkin muffin top cookies."

I made these today for an extra treat on Thanksgiving & it turns out they may be the star of the show.  I made them exactly according to the recipe and they came out perfect.  They don't have a too strong pumpkin or spice flavor.  They're not too heavy or overly sweet, just perfect

I used fresh pumpkin puree from my garden and worried that it would be too wet (since I was impatient and didn't strain it as long as I probably should have...) but they turned out perfect.

Greatest cookie recipe ever! Soft, chewy & not to sweetI made it as written the first time; they were fantastic. The second time I tried it, I made a few modifications, as per another reviewer - I added the full (15oz) can of pumpkin, half white/half brown sugar, and 1tbsp of pumpkin pie spice. Oh my, even better! I've even made them gluten-free, subbing 2cups of GF flour mix for the AP flour. The GF ones took longer to cook (about 20 min), but turned out just as tasty. You couldn't even tell they were GF! I will be making these year round!  (Oh, I didn't ice them.)

These are too much extra work if you want to use real pumpkin puree. I had to add around 1/4 c flour, soak my hands in cold water and grease them 2-3 times per sheet, and cook them for an extra 5-8 minutes to get anything resembling what's pictured and described by other reviewers. If you use real puree and don't add flour, you'll get incredibly sticky, flat, somewhat dense discs. I couldn't even scrape them off the parchment paper I used when baking. Although the taste was alright (everyone who tried them said they were tasty), the next time I want to make pumpkin cookies, I'll look elsewhere.

The cookies were incredible, period. The only reason that I gave it four stars was the icing. The icing was too thin to put on the cookies without it dripping everywhere. My advice would be to find your own icing (or frosting), such as a cream cheese frosting or something with maple in it to compliment the pumpkin.

These cookies were excellent and disappeared at a party I took them to.  I had to laugh because my husband claims to not like pumpkin in any form except pie but when he tried these he claimed they were exactly like the spice cookies his grandmother made.  We won't tell him they are pumpkin!

These are FANTASTIC cookies!!  The cookie on it's own without the frosting is yummy, but then add the frosting and it's over the top good :)  Will make these again on Thanksgiving and they will go into the usual cookie routine.  Thanks!!

These cookies are super easy to make and very tasty. I went without the icing and thought they were definitely sweet enough. They were also much lighter and softer than I had expected, however when you place them in a storage container they lose their crusty goodness and become slightly damp and stickier.  Still yummy, but stickier on your fingers. Enjoy!

This recipe is outstanding! I was looking for a great pumpkin cookie recipe and I found it! Great pumpkin/spice flavor very moist and great with or without icing. I also substituted 1/4 cup white sugar for brown sugar. My husband loved them and recommended warning them for a few seconds in the microwave before eating! Thanks for the great recipe!

A delicious cookie and air freshener.  The house smelled like Autumn, Thanksgiving and Christmas all at once.  I had to make mine gluten free.  I couldn't go cup-for-cup here.  I needed 50 grams more of all purpose gluten free flour than listed.  I also subbed pumpkin puree for the butter in the icing and added some cinnamon.  They turned out soft and delicious.  Thank you Gina for sharing this recipe with us.

Delish. I would add "Do not over bake" in the instructions. The tops should be just turning golden, and if you touch one with your finger it will be firm.

These are amazing. Not overly pumpkin-y in flavour. Just a hint. My husband loved them and he doesn't like anything pumpkin. I used a cream cheese icing on top instead of the one listed. I just drizzled it on top instead of fully coating. The perfect amount of sweetness. Other reviewers said that 10 minutes was all the bake needed and I agree. I made 3 batches at 10 minutes each and they came out perfect. Light and fluffy. I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned. I donated them to our local police station. Big hit!

Almost perfect! I used a whole can of pumpkin puree (15oz), omit the egg (DH is allergic to eggs), used cinnamon chips and chocolate chips on top instead of icing. These were very puffy like cake, retained  their puffiness even after cooling. I would cut down the amount of sugar next time - it was too sweet for me. Love the cinnamon scent that filled the house as they bake.

It was good considering I didnt have any eggs. I used plain greek yogurt instead, splenda, and decrease the flour by 1/2 cup. I am not a big cookie fan and this was perfect mini cake/bread... not so much a cookie.

Loved these cookies. My 7 year old daughter ate 4 in a raw :) 
One thing I will skip next time it's butter and vanilla in the glaze.
Overall yummy, soft and easy to make. Nice for any autumn event.

These cookies are delightful.  Very moist and the pumpkin flavor is very nice.  I used the Libby's prepared pumpkin and eliminated the spices - they turned out great!  They're wonderful for a fall holiday party!

I've been making these for years now. This recipe needs no adjustment because for us it is perfect as is. These are our family and friend's favorite. I've even sent these overseas to a friend who was deployed and he enjoyed them greatly. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I loved this recipe. It had a light cake-y texture. The only thing that I did differently was that instead of teaspoons of spices I added heaping teaspoons (just because I'm spice crazy). This will be my go-to pumpkin cookie recipe

These cookies are excellent. Actually taste like pumpkin and the glaze added just a tad of extra sweetness. I did reduce the white sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. This recipe is a keeper.

These cookies were a HUGE hit.  Even the seven year old loved them!  They were very moist and flavorful.  This cookie took on a cake consistency, which was a pleasant surprise.  I don't even like pumpkin, and I was the one having one at each meal.  I  will be making them again.  Though you might want to refrigerate them to keep the frosting hard.  Here in GA the humidity prevents it from solidifying if you leave them contained on the counter. I love this website; I can't say I've ever made a bad recipe from it.

Ended up turning out just like the recipe said. Moist, cake like and a great amount of pumpkin taist to it. I wasn't able to handle them with my hand so they didn't turn out all perfect and pretty but it's all ok because the taist is the important part.

these are absolutely delicious, very cake-like and the few changes I made were two cups white sugar 1 half cup of light brown sugar and 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. This will be my go-to pumpkin cookie recipe from now on! My kids loved these too, so not jus something adults will enjoy!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! My sister and mom loved them so much that in two days they were all gone! The first time I made them there was way to much icing! Three days later I made some more and halved the icing recipe. It was perfect! Although the time on the recipe says to cook them for 15-20mins I ended up getting perfect cookies at 10mins. Even then the bottom was staring to crisp a bit. Overall great recipe especially for beginners like me:)

After making adjustments for 6200 altitude - namely 2 TBSP more flour, 1/4 less sugar, reducing the soda and baking soda both to 3/4 tsp and raising the baking temp to 365 degrees - I found the dough very stiff and the first batch did not spread so we're 50 cent size.  I mixed another egg in the remaing dough and the cookies spread better and tasted fine!

This is the BEST pumpkin cookie recipe.  It is actually more like a pumpkin cake.  Only change I made was I used pumpkin pie spice in place of cloves as I didn't have any.  My husband and kids devour these cookies in less than 2 days!

What a welcome change from the usual "really sweet" cookie.  I had enough leftover pumpkin (from the Pumpkin Cake III on this site) to make this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I made a few minor changes ... I know, I know,  why rate it then ... well, if you're interested, read on.  I didn't have enough softened butter so I added about 1/8 cup of applesauce to make up the cup required.  I used 3/4 c white and 3/4 c brown sugar and added 1 c of dried cranberries.  A small cookie scoop equaled 70 cookies, baked on parchment paper for 12 minutes.  I flattened some with the back of a wet spoon and left some of them "round".  The round ones could have used another minute in the oven, I think.  I had leftover cream cheese glaze which I drizzled on some of the cookies. Personally, I loved the subtle taste of the cookie better without the cream cheese.  Maybe the glaze in this recipe would complement the cookie better.  Thanks, Gina, for a lovely basic recipe.

These were really delicious and easy to make! I put the icing in a plastic bag and snipped off a corner to ice them and it worked great. The icing is a bit too sugary for my liking, but to compensate, I just don't fully ice the cookie. Delicious and a perfect fall treat!

Fantastic made just as written. I did reduce the cooking time and it improved the overall texture of the cookie a lot! The icing was a perfect compliment and really made the cookie AMAZING!!

This is a fantastic recipe! My family loves pumpkin recipes and this is a keeper. I ended up changing a few small things to our liking. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and only one cup white sugar. Also used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp cinnamon for ease. Added 1/2 cup more pumpkin too, as we think it improved the texture a bit. We even love them without the icing! Thanks for a great suggestion :-)

Wonderful cake-like cookies! I usually taste-test the dough to gauge how good the cookies might turn out. Safe to say that both cookies and dough are fantastic. My only complaint would be to increase the measurements on the icing, because you'll definitely want more than the recipe states!

I cooked mine for 11 min at 350. They came out  with kind of a muffin texture. But very tasty.  I didn't ice them.

So simple, soft, and sweet! Took a few to work and gave a few to family members and they were a hit - even with those who don't "care" for pumpkin flavoured things (which I will never understand). Would make again in a heartbeat!

I didn't feel like making icing, so I added 1 and 1/4 cups of white chocolate chips. YUMMY! Also, I made them with the adjustments others had recommended: 3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon all-spice and cook time of 12 minutes. Enjoy!!

As a concha, this recipes rocks. The texture, sweetness, everything about it reminds me of Mexican sweet bread. I've read some people complaining about the spiciness of the cookie, but I didn't taste any spice at all. I did follow the recipe exactly but there just wasn't any noticeable spice to it. Next time I make this, it'll be in a bread pan or muffin tray. The icing (or glaze) made it a bit too sweet for me.

These cookies are "Oh my god" good. I made them for a book club meeting and just got rave reviews. Everything is perfect from the cookie to the glaze. I will be making these for Thanksgiving for my family as well. LOVE THEM! Perfect.

My dad, loves bulk buying. One thing he always gets is a #10 sized can of Yams. Oy! So when that can makes it to the kitchen I make 3 sweet potato pies, 1 sweet potato pound cake, and a double batch of these cookies. These are delish and I usually forgo the icing. For a single batch: I also include 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of Allspice and 1/2 tsp of Almond extract. I get a bit of a stickier dough when I add about 1/2 cup extra yams, but the amount is fine as is and it really doesn't effect the end product. (I just need to polish off that ginormous can!)The scent is intoxicating! Like others, I only bake on parchment paper and flatten these with the bottom of a glass dipped in granulated sugar. Enjoy, baker buddies!

OMG! These are soooo good. They stay nice and soft. My oldest daughter loves them. My and her can eat a batch by ourselves. The icing needs to be played with a little to get the consistancy right but it is terrific. One of my favorite cookies now.

Super delicious and soft. Very cakey in texture but I love that about them. I halved the recipie to only make 18 but I didn't measure out the half can and just kind of eyeballed it; the batter turned out to be wetter than intended but delicious when baked. I also added a teaspoon of cocoa powder instead of cinnamon and used 3/4 tsp. Of premade pumpkin spice. Definitely perfect for a quick cookie.

There are few cookies that last in my house and these are no exception.  The only modification I made was using a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves and nutmeg. These cookies are puffy and delicious and my kids love them!

This is a very good recipe. The dough is super sticky, more like cake batter than cookie dough, so be prepared to use flour if you want to make actual shapes with these cookies.

Loved it. Made some suggested changes like cinnamon in the frosting and I used all spice instead of cloves and nutmeg. Baked up beautifully and tasted even better. This one is a keeper.

Always a hit - my toddler loves them. Just make sure you store in an unsealed container as they will get mushy from being in a closed container.

These were soft, moist and delicious.  In addition to the listed spices, I also added some pumpkin pie spice - only because I really like a more intense spice flavor.  I didn't end up with three dozen as the recipe states, but I'm sure it's because I made much larger cookies.  Had plenty for my family and to share as Christmas gifts.

I've cheated a bit. Baking in a snow storm with ingredients already on hand, butter is limited so substiuted with margerine for the cookie.  Also added a tsp of ground ginger because I can't imagine anything pumpkin without it!  Actually loved it with my modification and cheat. :-)

Incredible pumpkin cookie! I add 1/2 tsp more cloves because we like them with a bit more spice. For the glaze, I have found to put it in a ziplock bag and snip the corner off to get a nice even drizzle effect. Great recipe! Thank you!

Simply delicious. This is the first time something I've baked has turned out exactly right!!
Like most others, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar. They came out fluffy and moist and round :) much like a muffin-top. 
If you follow the recipe exactly, you won't go wrong. Subtle spices & pumpkin flavour came out perfectly. I'm making this a monthly tradition!!!

It's not amazing, but it's good.  If you have a sweet tooth and want to throw something together real quick this is satisfying.  Though I think it would be alot tastier with raisins and some chopped walnuts or pecans in the mix.  And yes it is a CAKE COOKIE so it will never be crunchy, to those who were upset about the texrure.

This is my first time baking cookies from scratch. I rigorously followed the recipe until the moist ingredients didn't seem to become creamy in the mixer as they should. To my horror, I discovered that I should have put in only a CUP of pumpkin, not a CAN! What to do? I figured it was past the point of no return so I went ahead. Well, these are AWESOME! Moist, light and flavorful, and the icing is sweet but delicious. Obviously a pretty idiot proof recipe. Five stars!

Try using this cookie recipe with another frosting recipe on this site called "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting." Sprinkle a little nutmeg on top and HOLY COW. So good.

Possibly my favorite cookies ever.  Made exactly as written using my own roasted pumpkin puree and they are perfection.  My husband was really bummed one day to come home and realize that I had finished them off.

This recipe creates a great cookie!  Soft, fluffy, subtle flavoring..  I'm not sure I added all the flour, because I lost count (doubled the recipe), but the cookies baked up nice and fluffy, and the icing really made them pop.

I made these for a company Thanksgiving luncheon, and people having been raving, going so far as to call them "pumpkin clouds".  I will repeat a warning not to put them in an airtight container though, they did get a little soggy, but that didn't stop the raves.

I'll definitely be making these again.

I make this recipe every year around the holidays and my children and relatives can't get enough.
I adjusted the spices tho, added twice the amount of cinnamon, alspice, cloves and nutmeg.  Makes the cookies pop and yummy!  Best soft cookie anywhere!

We loved these cakey cookies.  I deviated just a little from the recipe by adding less than a cup of chopped pecans to the dough and I added cinnamon to the icing.  Tastes like autumn.

Just made these tonight. They are yummy! Kids and husband did not even wait till I iced them! I made one modification based on other reviews: I used 1 cup of white sugar plus 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. As another reviewer mentioned these cookies do not spread while baking. They come out of the oven exactly as they went in. My first batch was kind of "spiky" since I used an ice cream scoop to drop them on the pan. The next batch I smoothed the tops with a wet finger and they came out beautifully. I used the icing in the recipe (adding a little cinnamon). Some I fully iced the tops and some my daughter drizzled icing on. My family preferred the ones with just a little icing (or none at all!) I will be making another batch to take to our family Thanksgiving dinner!

I made them as the recipe said, except I was afraid they'd taste a little bland, so I added white chocolate chips and they were great. They're very soft and thick.

These are truly amazing.  Delicious, addicting, compliment-inducing!  The recipe is forgiving if your measurements are not exact.  Because they contain pumpkin puree, they stay super soft but not too delicate to crumble from removal from baking sheet.  I will make these over chocolate chip cookies for any holiday affair!

These came out pretty good. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and used 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, one 15 oz. can of pumpkin, and put cinnamon in the glaze. I found that these did not spread very much in the oven while they baked. Pay attention when these are in the oven; my first tray was done in 11 minutes, but the second one needed another 4 minutes, and then when the heat was raised the rest were done in a little under 12 minutes. 


The cookie itself tastes (to me) a lot like pumpkin pie, because of the pumpkin and spices used. It definitely needed the glaze; the pumpkin and spices overpowered the sugar. 



Everything has room for improvement, so I'm giving it four stars, but these are definitely satisfactory. 


Something worth mentioning, however, is that when the cookies are fresh out of the oven, they have a tendency to stick together. Let them completely cool before glazing or storing them.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I only needed to bake my cookies 12 minutes, rather than the 15 to 20 minutes.  Frosted mine with cream cheese frosting.  Yum!

The cookie by itself is a bit bland.  Haven't tries the icing yet, and I hope it gives the cookie more punch.  Next time, I might increase the nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon.

Amazing!!! Seriously the best pumpkin cookie ever. I used 1cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added cinnamon to the icing.. Made a double batch and brought them to a family party and they were gone within the first hour! Definitely don't cover them when storing them though they do get mushy, but still fabulous!

These were FANTASTIC! Reminded me of Dunkin Donuts pumpkin muffins. They stayed soft for a few days and we couldn't stop grabbing one as we walked past the counter. I made the recipe exactly as written but I did add some cinnamon (probably less then a 1/4 teas) to the icing as others suggested and that icing was incredible, totally made the whole cookie! Thanks.. this is my new fall favorite!

These were excellent!  The only modification was that I added additional pumpkin pie spice to the already listed spices, (which could actually be achieved by using slightly more of the spices called  for here). Also, I ALWAYS double the vanilla in every recipe I bake.  The results were a moist, and perfectly spiced cake-like cookie. If you like your desserts a little less sweet, than omit the icing, but with the addition of the icing it was the perfect finish to my thanksgiving lunch with the girls!  Everyone was wowed by them, even those who said they typically don't eat anything "pumpkin". The kids were also big fans too! With the icing of course!

Really good! The only minor change that I made was to the glaze: I omitted the melted butter and added a tablespoon of maple syrup instead. I bet the cream cheese frosting is also pretty good, too, though I haven't tried that.

I make these cookies every year in the fall...super easy and super good. I don't change anything except sometimes I'll add white chocolate chips to the batter. Makes them even better...if that's even possible!

I baked these for a bake sale at work, and they were a hit!! They were very easy to make and turned out perfect! The only thing I did differently from the instructions was that I did not drizzle the glaze. I dipped the tops of the cookies into the glaze, then placed them on a wire rack. I think it was faster and easier than drizzling, but that's just me. :-)

These cookies are delicious! I worked at Hallmark and made them for one of our customers appreciation things and they all kept asking if you could buy them in the store or if there was a mix for them. Huge hit! My youngest brother still continuously asked for these. Even in the middle of summer. Very easy to make, really soft flavorful cookies! And the dough is supposed to be very sticky.

I made these on a whim two falls ago and brought them to (my now previous) job - my coworkers LOVED THEM. We had a beer fest every year (I used to work at a pub) and we made a special menu for it... Everyone agreed that I should make the cookies for that year! People loved them. These cookies are so soft, almost cake-like. The icing is amazing. I added cinnamon to the frosting too. They look pretty and come out really nice. I recommend making these to anyone!

This recipe is made all through fall and winter in my house and family and friends constantly ask for the recipe.  I don't use the clove, personally don't like the flavor it adds, but that is our own taste and we add more cinnamon. It is also fantastic without the icing and adding in chocolate chips.  Very versatile recipe and can be a base for many interesting combinations.

Great cookies! I don't know how anyone could dislike these...I guess unless you prefer a more dense cookie texture, as these have an airy, cake-like texture...They really are fantasti though! And I didn't even make the frosting for the first batch (decided I would "try" one before frosting and ended up eating the entire first batch! Yes, they're that good!)! Only thing I did differently was using half white and half light brown sugar. Highly recommend these!

Love this! Delicious cakey cookie. Doesn't need the icing, it makes it a bit too sweet. I would go for a light cream cheese frosting next time, if anything. Yummy right out of the oven, best to eat on the day you make them. Leave them out overnight, don't seal them in a container as they get too moist.

Turned out more cakey than I expected. I omitted the cloves since I forgot to buy those, but the pumpkin flavor was still nice. Added a bit more cinnamon because I love cinnamon, and if you feel like it you can sprinkle some on top of the icing if you love it as much as I do. I had a lot of frosted icing left over though, so I might decrease the measurements, but at least I had something to snack on while the icing hardened! Best eaten when warm though since the texture is odd when cold and not very appetizing.

These were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did find it easier to just dip the cookie tops into the frosting instead of drizzling them with the frosting. And the more frosting the better, right? Also wanted to mention that I used my medium Pampered Chef scoop and the recipe yielded 3 1/2 dozen.

Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, but after tasting the batter, I thought it wasn't sweet enough, so I added roughly quarter cup more of brown sugar, along with a dash more of cinnamon and nutmeg. Did not have ground cloves, so I blended 4 whole cloves and that worked pretty well. I prefer it without the glaze. This is so addictive! Baked them for almost twenty minutes to get the crispy on the outside and soft on the inside texture. So good.

Thanks for the great recipe!  Just for fun, I replaced all the butter with applesauce, used a full can of pumpkin, and used a mix of whole wheat flour, milled flaxseed, wheat germ, and all purpose flour.  Per other reviews, I used half brown and half white sugar and topped with cream cheese icing. I just ate four and they are amazing!

I make these cookies every Thanksgiving and Christmas,and i must say they have become a favorite. Everyone one of my co-workers and family members love these cookies. Though i have modified it slightly. I do not use the cloves, and i buy a pre-made cream cheese frosting.

Followed the recipe exactly. i baked for about 15-16 minutes on parchment lined cookie sheets. cookies were very soft, more like cake than cookies. it was a little too much clove flavor for my taste. next time would cut back on the cloves to 1/4 tsp, otherwise a very good recipe! icing was also delicious, but i needed to add more milk to get it thin enough to drizzle over cookies.

They  DO spread. I put 15 cookies on one sheet, but they puffed and spread quite a bit so that they were all squished together. I did better with 8 cookies on a sheet. 

Because it's more of a batter than a dough, I had trouble flattening them without making a mess. What I finally did was refrigerate the batter then scoop each cookie directly into a custard cup filled with turbinado sugar. Then I flattened with the bottom of an orange juice glass. Since I don't like bothering with icing (even if it is good), I prefer adding turbinado sugar to give added sweetness and a nice crunch.

Cookies are good, but I had to take away stars just because of the difficulty of having to come up with a system for flattening without a sticky mess.

Oh yes: and 12 minutes was sufficient with a little time to cool on the cookie sheets first. Subbed 1/2 cup of the sugar for brown.

Very easy to make and I followed the directions as written.  Cookies smell incredible, taste good and are soft and cake-like (mine are usually hard).  I had some leftover vanilla buttercream frosting that worked well on them once completely cooled, and I also tried the recommended glaze -- both were very good.

A friend recommended this recipe to me, but he presented me with a slight variation which I used when I made it. I made two batches, but rather than using the icing I added chocolate and white chocolate chips. They tasted so fantastic and the cookies are just insanely fluffy. I already have the ingredients and will be making them again soon.

We LOVE and I mean LOVE this cookie in our house!  I just found this recipe but I think it's going to be one that I will make year round.  I like that it doesn't use as much butter as other cookie reipces and has the added pumpkin for nutrition.  Having said that I did omit the cloves because I can't stand them and increased the cinnamon to three teaspoons.  Cinnamon is also really healthy for you.   We also like them plain rather than frosted but I think a cream cheese type frosting would be much better than the one used that is posted to this recipe.  Others said storage is an issue for these.  If put into a zip bag they get moist and stick to each other and the frosting gets soft and icky.  I also put colored sugar/sprinkles on the colored frosting and had an ugly mess.  The last time I made them I just wrapped them in a dish towel that I use only for covering bread or cinnamon rolls while raising and they were just perfect!  So in the future when they are done cooling I'll just put them into a bowl and wrap them with the dish towel .   They are a more of a cake like cookie but really YUMMY!  Love this one!

These were fantastic!  They were perfectly fluffy and I added 1 extra tablespoon millk to the frosting and it was delicious.  I could have added another tablespoon of milk to make drizzling the frosting easier, but when it "hardened" on the cookie, it was really perfect!  I will make these again for an upcoming party.

These were great! And a lot easier than I thought it would be! I usually burn my cookies, but these were so moist that I would've had to really overcook them in order to burn them! Made about 3 dozen. i didn't have enough vanilla for the glaze, but it still tasted fine.

One of our favorites!  I sent a care package to my daughter at college with a variety of cookies.  These she ate in one night.  I added a little pumpkin pie spice to the glaze that in my daughter's words turned them into "crack" in a good way.

These taste ok but they definitely aren't cookies.  They are like a cross between a scone and a muffin.  Personally, I'd rather make one of those in the future than mess around with this recipe again.

This is the second time I have made these cookies and both times they have been very popular! This time I made a double batch for my husband's staff and they absolutely loved them. Just one note - I found that the 2 cup recipe of icing is too much if you are just going to drizzle it but may be enough if you are coating the cookies. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's definitely going to be used over and over again!

Turned out perfectly! Very soft but not cake-like. The icing hardens up well too so that they can be stacked. Great holiday cookie.

I"m making these as I type, and honestly they're heavenly from the moment you take them out of the oven. Their aroma filled with the kitchen with a simple kind of bliss, and that was only the beginning of the magic of these cookies. Don't be dismayed by their cake like texture when putting them on the cookie sheet. You have to use a spoon, and just make sure every cookie has a generous portion to avoid burning. They were fairly simple to make, and I used pumpkin pie spice rather than doing the cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. separately. After being baked, they were very light. My family loves the texture, and you don't have to worry about these being too rich. The pumpkin taste wasn't super strong, but it was certainly noticeable and apparent. If this is negative, I'm sure a bit more pumpkin puree could easily fix this. Now on to the glaze. It was extremely simple to create, and just add the milk in slowly. You won't need as much as you think, and it's very light as well. The taste can be compared to that of gingerbread house frosting. You don't need much on the cookie, they're good enough by themselves. They don't spread much, in that way they're more similar to cake. Overall, this is one of my favorite recipes and I will certainly be using is again as well as recommending it to others. A great fall recipe, and I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as me!

These cookies are great as is, but... I tweak them a bit for my tastes. I use  brown sugar instead of white (I actually just used organic coconut palm sugar) and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices. For the frosting I throw in about 1/8 c of white chocolate chips in with the melting butter then add 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. Whisk quickly until smooth then off the heat add vanilla, then add to powdered sugar. I sometimes will add a pinch of pumpkin pie spice to the frosting as well. Love these cookies!

I added cinnamon to the icing then dusted them with chopped toasted pecans. Be sure not to over bake these.

These were very delicious when I allowed to cook for only 12 minutes, added more vanilla, a dash of ginger, 1 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar, and loads more cinnamon(we love cinnamon)oh and I added cinnamon to the icing.  I made drops of teaspoon size and tried to flatten. They came out perfectly like a muffin top! I drizzled the icing up and down and then side to side instead of just pouring it on. It was a great recipe and I will make it again, only I will add chopped pecans next time. Thanks

These were tasty. I opted not to ice them because I wasn't really looking for a super sweet cookie, I just really wanted something pumpkin! The cookies were really moist and soft, and they stayed that way for a few days. I added chopped pecans to a few of the cookies. Very festive.

This recipe is truly delicious! 

A few pointers: 

I  added a tsp of all-spice to my batter. 

for the Glaze: be careful not to add to much confectioners sugar to the glaze. I found its best to have a consistency somewhere between syrup and molasses; syrup-texture is a bit to thin and will run off the cookie, while molasses-texture will not spread and will rip up the cookie if you try. 

Also, I heated the canned pumpkin in a pan with the spices and vanilla extract before adding it to the mixing bowl. This made the pumpkin taste fresher, not like it came from a can, and ensured the spices where infused into the pumpkin. Trust me this makes a HUGE difference.

Everyone that has tried these cookies has a mouth-gasm. Enjoy!

These cookies were sooooo delicious.  I will definitely make them again.  Both of my kids and my husband devoured them.  I didn't use much cloves because it was really hard to grind them.

So, I tried this recipe again, with a little experiment: After making the dough (Using half brown sugar, half white, and using the -whole- can of pumpkin) I split the dough evenly between two bowls and added 3/4 cup chopped pecans top one bowl, and 3/4 cup chocolate chips to the other bowl. Baked both for about 14 minutes and they turned out great! This is such a versatile recipe :)

One of my favorite recipes I've ever made from this website! I've taken these to Thanksgiving functions, pot-lucks, and to work and they never stick around too long. The last time I made these cookies I used a cream cheese buttercream frosting), sooo yummy!! If you're going to cheat on your diet, this is the way to go :)

Followed the recipe exactly.  They are more 'cake' than cookie, but absolutely delicious! Easy-peasy to make, aroma is to die for, made the glaze first. Recipe gave me 5 doz. (made with medium ice cream scoop). I've applied the glaze three times--letting dry between coats. Leaving some unglazed for husband...good either way. Cream cheese frosting might be nice too.

edit: OOPS!! I DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RECIPE!!! I just realized as I was recording my notes that the recipe calls for 1 CUP canned pumpkin . . . I used 1 can (15 oz = ~1.75 cup) of pumpkin.  It turned out perfect.  Maybe one day I will try with just 1 cup . .   ORIGINAL REVIEW: Delicious, cakey.  I added a tbs of applesauce after I tasted the batter.  I doubt it made any difference, but I had felt the batter was a slightly too floury and I didn't want to add more butter.  Cooked for 15 min for my gigantic (2" dia) cookies and 12 min for the small (1.5") ones.  It was hard to tell if the cookies were done by looking at it, but it was the perfect time.

These are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted allspice for cloves since I was out.  My hubby loved these and he doesn't usually like "pumpkin-y" recipes.  The icing is delicious and could be used on lots of other goodies.  Thanks, Gina!

I thought the taste was very predictable... BUT my husband and daughter really loved them.

Make sure to let cookies cool before putting icing or icing wouldn't stay on the cookies.

Great recipe, kids love them.The glaze is a bit sweet for me (& I can't believe I am saying that as someone with an incredible sweet tooth) so I like them with just a slight drizzle...may look into a glaze with a less sugary taste...overall though, great recipe!

These very very good and really easy to make.  They reminded me of the ones they sell in the bakery of a local grocery store- that are always really expensive.  Much better to make our own, with our own homegrown pumpkin.

These cookies are so easy, and so yummy. I made them for a holiday cookie swap and everyone loved them. I added a pinch of cinnamon to the top, to make them look more festive! Awesome would defiantly make them again!

Very YUM. They are tasty and have a nice, moist, cake-like texture. Quick and easy. No special ingredients needed - everything is in my pantry. We will be making these again.

I made these cookies for my class and they were a race review.  Everyone loved them and ate all of them in a matter of minutes.  
I made them again for Thanksgiving as a dessert for the kids and everyone ate them up again.  Overall these cookies are moist and delicious and I followed the recipe exactly.  YUM YUM!!

Not too fond of nutmeg so i didn't put it in. Had to put in more powdered sugar in but then it seemed to soak into the cookie. I found them better topped with powdered sugar

This recipe was very easy to make.  Cookies are cake-like & super flavorful.  The glazed icing adds a sweet decadence to this new, holiday favorite.  Thanks for sharing, Gina.

These cookies are abslolutely delicious! My entire family loves them, including my son who doesn't like pumpking.  They were a big hit in my office.  They go great with coffee.  You can also add chopped walnuts or chocalate chips.  You can substitute the confectioners sugar for just powder sugar and you get a thicker frosting. 
If you over cook, don't worry... cover over night and they become softer and moist.
Enjoy!

great cookies, made with leftover pumpkin from double layer pumpkin cheesecake.  Used home made cream cheese icing instead of regular glaze for drizzle topping which was amazing!

Great cookies!  Although they do taste like you're eating the tops of pumpkin muffins rather than cookies but there is nothing wrong with that. My husband and daughter loved these.  Can't wait to make again!

Great fluffy texture, and the glaze makes them even more delicious. I added a little cinnamon to the glaze for fun. My cookies didn't round quite as beautifully, but still a delicious recipe!

I have never been a big pumpkin pie eater, so this Thanksgiving I decided to try something else with a pumpkin flavor. These cookies are perfect! I made no changes, and they were sooo delicious...just the right amount of sweetness and pumpkin flavor, moist, and the frosting is a necessity to bring all of the goodness together. Everyone in my family loved these cookies, which is rare!

Fantastic! I use freshly ground spices and a heaping 1.5 cups of sugar.  First I made them with the icing, delicious, and the second time without and they were just as good.  A must try for the holiday season.

I'm gluten-free so I substituted King Arthur Gluten Free Multi-purpose flour and added 3/4 tsp xantham gum. Added 1 1/3 cup of pumpkin puree since I had extra from a pumpkin pie I was making. Baked on parchment paper for 12 minutes as others suggested. When I tried my first one I just about melted - I was like whoaaa these are SO GOOD! Great texture and taste. I didn't do the icing because it was pretty sweet and I thought it might overpower the blend of spices (which were flavorful and perfect). Thanks for a wonderful recipe! This one's going to be a regular on my list. I got 54 cookies using a tablespoon of batter for each one.

Like the other reviews, these cookies are cake-like, so if you like crunchy cookies, these are not for you.  We definintely liked them better with the icing.  I followed a tip from a reviewer and added a dash of cinnamon to the frosting.  I will make them again, this time trying pecans in half the batch and mini chocolate chips in the other half.

LOVE this recipe! I have never rated a recipe before, but I must say this is spot on. I didn't have any cloves on hand so I just left them out, and I didn't quite have a full cup of regular butter so I threw in a tbsp on margarine and they still came out great! I like my cookies a little bigger and was able to make 20 good sized cookies from this recipe. Don't let the dough scare you, it may seem a bit runny because of the pumpkin, but I popped mine in the fridge for 1/2 and hour and they turn out beautifully! Also, if you don't have confectioner sugar on hand you can make a fabulous glaze with 1/2 cup regular sugar and 1/3 water brought to a boil until thickened :)  Thanks Gina!!

These cookies are the most requested of the season.  I have people asking me for them in September.  If you own a pastry bag this recipe works great to squeeze out star shaped cookies.  Makes it  go really fast.

Unbelievable!  Cookies are soft and full of flavor.  They are addictive!  I've made them a few times.  For the icing, I just dip the cookie tops in and let them dry for a few minutes.  Everyone loves them.

Best cookie recipe ever!
I make this at least 5 times a year, and everyone always asks for two things: more cookies and the recipe.
I find that I have a lot of frosting left over, so I just double the cookie batter and keep the frosting amount the same. The frosting does harden a bit between batches in the oven, but as soon as the frosting touches the warm cookies, it spreads just fine.

These are so soft, fluffy and absolutely delicious! The only thing I did different was use pumpkin spice instead of nutmeg and cloves. I still used the 2 tsp of cinnamon w/the spice. I also added some pumpkin spice to the glaze. YuMmY!! Thanks!

Love these!  I made these with fresh pumpkin and took them to the office and they were gone in minutes.  I don't even like pumpkin and these were delicious.

I agree with another reviewer that these don't have to be flattened. I used the glaze in the recipe and thought it was very good as written. I also added a half of pecan to the top of the cookie before baking and felt it needed that for some substance. Another reviewer had added a walnut; however, I had the pecans and like pecan with pumpkin. That same reviewer suggested adding some chopped nuts to the batter and I also think I will do that next time to add substance to the cookie. It is kind of bland without any nuts in it. Otherwise this is a very nice "Thanksgiving holiday" addition to my desserts for a cookie. I only baked it the 15 minutes and that was plenty. They will harden a bit as they cool. The house smells wonderful while they are cooking!

I made this for a friends birthday party. After making a couple of test cookies (delicious!) I decided that the texture was spongy and soft enough to pour the batter into a cake tin to make a cookie cake, which I then drizzled the glaze over. I used about 1 1/2 cups pumpkin purée, about 1/3 cup extra white sugar and didn't go easy on the cinnamon and it was one of the best things I (and the party goers) had ever tasted. Hold onto this one, guys! It's a gem!

I made the cookies EXACTLY as the recipe.  The cookies were good, but not great.  I like a lot of pumpkin flavor to my cookies and felt they were lacking that.  Next time I will add more pumpkin to bring out the flavors better.  Overall a good cookie.  Moist, cake-like cookie.

These are pretty good, I wish they had a bit more pumpkin flavor, however, I used some leftover canned creamy vanilla frosting and maybe it overshadows the pumpkin flavor in a way that the glaze in the recipe wouldn't. I'll make them again just drizzling the glaze over them instead.

I made these cookies the other day with a couple of additions: I threw in some chopped walnuts (which I think added depth to the cookies. And for the frosting, I whisked 4 oz of cream cheese with some softened butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, a lil hazelnut coffee creamer, and 1 lb of powdered sugar. I couldn't frost the cookies fast enough! Everyone loved em!

These are my absolute favorite pumpkin recipe ever! (And I love anything pumpkin!) No changes... one suggestion for a varied final product: instead of drizzling the glaze, you can dip the top in it (and they will come out like the main photo). Either way, they are delicious!

Not too heavy, nice cake-like texture, and not overly pumpkin-y. I added some chocolate chips for extra awesome. I accidentally put in the entire can of pumpkin, which resulted in a too-moist dough, but just threw in an extra 1/2 cup of flour to balance it out and they turned out perfectly. I used half whole-wheat and half white flour.

Better then you can image. Moist, no need for icing, but delicious with or without. At fist I thought they were going to flatten, I used my own pumpkin puree that I thawed but, they raised up and were wonderful. My husband, who isn't crazy about pumpkin said they were really good.

This was excellent! And so easy. I also used more than a cup of pumpkin, probably about 3/4 of the can which seemed to add great flavor. I will definitely share these at work tomorrow and keep it in my fall collection for future years to come!

This recipe is missing ground ginger and allspice. My cookies must've been small, because they only baked for 13 minutes. I'd suggest using some brown sugar instead of all white in the cookie. Also, cream cheese frosting is really good on these cookies - they taste like a spice cake or a cinnamon roll, after they're done.

Great, moist CAKE-LIKE cookie! I followed the recipe almost exactly...I couldn't find ground cloves so I just used some extra pumpkin pie spice. Great hit at the first fall tailgate! As another reviewer said: great with coffee!

So amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly and loved it! My 7 year old said they are her new favorite. The cookie alone is not too sweet, just a great blend of pumpkin and spice. The icing makes it a real treat- I didn't add any extra milk beyond the 3T and it was thick but smooth. Fantastic recipe- thank you!

This recipe is very good.  I substituted one of the cups of flour for whole wheat flour, and cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup.  The cookies are very tasty!

These cookies were super good! Very soft, cake like, and sweet but not TOO sweet. The only thing for me was the dough was very dry. I had to add some milk to moisten it enough to mix. But I think that was due to me using fresh pumpkin (baked then mashed) rather then canned. The milk worked just fine! Will make these again..maybe tonight!

Great recipe!  I substituted 1/4 cup extra pumpkin and 1/4 cup sunflower oil for the butter and added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger.  I added more ginger to the glaze and topped it with orange zest.  Delicious!!!

These cookies are delicious!  I followed the directions exactly with one exception.  As my oven is hotter than normal, I turned the temp down some.  Try some of the cookies without icing too.  It can take away from the taste of the cookie if you put too much icing on.
I have this favorited and will be making again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect just the way they are, but I usually add cream cheese to the glaze instead of butter. Also, they usually don't take 15-20 minutes to cook - I take them out around 10-12 minutes.

Love these.

Delicious! Soft and moist with great flavor! I followed the directions almost exactly. I didn't measure my pumpkin puree - I used a little more than 3/4 of the can. I also added some cinnamon to the glaze. Don't over cook! I cooked exactly 15 min on a stone. Also, another reviewer suggested not to seal in an airtight container. I plan to just cover with a towel.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to try something different with pumpkin. I definitely wasted a can of pumpkin puree. These cookies were to thick and became hard very quickly upon cooling. My kids are cookie monsters but not with these, they are still in the cookie jar and I have to throw them out.

If you're looking for a soft, cake-like cookie these are for you! These cookies are wonderful!  I wanted to rate it a 5 star recipe, but there are just a couple little things that I would change.  I took the advice and substituted 1/2 c. brown sugar for white.  Also, the spices are a little lacking.  Next time I plan to add a 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon and add the recommended 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  I did not add the cinnamon or spice to the glaze.  I will DEFINITELY be making these every year around Fall and the Holidays.  They are just delicious and very comforting.  Also, I took some other advice and baked for 12 minutes.  PERFECT! :)

I made this per the recipe, with only one change. I didn't have cloves on hand, so I substituted ground ginger (a personal favorite). I served these at a dinner party to guests who traditionally do not enjoy pumpkin, and they were gone within the hour. I will definitely be making these again.

A very good pumpkin cookie recipe! The only alterations I made were the suggestions to use 1cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar and cook for 12mins on convection... they came out great! Soooo addicting.. I've already eaten 5 in the past 10mins!

Look no further for the best Pumpkin cookie recipe around. These are FANTASTIC cookies!!! I added a little cinnamon to the glaze as did others, and I sent them with my hubby to his work. They ate them so fast, he sent me a message later saying they wanted more! They've even been requested for their company bake sale. I will never look for another pumpkin cookie recipe ever again.

I bought some of these at a bake sale during an intermission at my daughters play. All I could think about for the second half of the play was "I NEED that recipe" I was like a crazed person. After the performance I waited by the table asking all the other parents -if any of them knew who brought those cookies?! Like little pumpkin scone bites of Fall perfection. Finally a mom told me where she'd found the recipe. And thus began my relationship with Allrecipes and my pumpkin cookie habit. Nothing better on a fall day than a cup of coffee, some scented candles, rain if I'm lucky, and iced pumpkin cookies *sigh*

So easy and very yummy! I used no egg and increased the pumpkin to make up for it. Also used reduced fat margarine.

I doubled the recipe and ended up making 5 dozen of these cookies. The kitchen smelled like heaven, and I am definitely ready for fall now! I replaced 1/3 of the white sugar with brown and added vanilla bean paste and cinnamon to the icing. I drizzled the icing over the cookies and really only needed half a recipe of icing. The cookies were a hit, and I know I am going to get asked to make these over and over through the holidays!

These cookies were absolutely delicious and so easy to make! My 11yo son and I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly! We used my favorite cream cheese frosting on top-
1 stick butter softened
1 8oz package cream cheese softened
1 tsp vanilla
3 cups powdered sugar
Cream butter and cream cheese then add vanilla. Add powdered sugar by the cup. This makes enough for a 9 X 13" sheet cake.

This recipe is really, really amazing but I altered it a bit to suit my family's tastes.  Knowing we are a spicy family, I doubled the cinnamon, cloves, and used fresh nutmeg (but didn't measure it).  I also added a little bit of allspice... maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  I was planning to put a cream cheese frosting on the cookies but my kids ate them warm right out of the oven and I never had time to even make the icing. :)  Lovely recipe!  Thank you so much!!

THIS IS AMAZING!!!! I took the advice of previous viewers and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Also, since we didn't have canned pumpkin, I used pureed pumpkin that my mom had frozen. I cooked it down first, and added 1/4 tsp. of salt. These cookies are so good! I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the glaze. I will definitely make these over and over again! THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING RECIPE!!!!

I love pumpkin flavors for fall. These are some of my favorite cookies of all time. I'm always worried that I'm not cooking them long enough, but these cookies seem to withstand however long I decide to bake them. I make them following the directions. I make a fraction of the icing, though, because it doesn't need much (or any, really) icing. YUM.

Everyone LOVES these!!! So tasty. I follow the recipe except I use Pampered Chef Cinnamon Spice Plus (like pumpkin pie spice) instead of the other seasonings. Craveable!

Too much clove and too fluffy like a cake or a muffin.  If I do try this one again, I will use half the clove and double the butter and pumpkin in it.

Absolutely amazing! They are like mini pumpkin muffins with a little glaze. I will definitely make these again! 
Just be sure to stock up on canned pumpkin while it's available at the store.

So good! The aroma it left in the house alone is enough to make me want to make these again. They had a great flavor that wasn't overly sweet. What a fun recipe to let my 5 year old make with me. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! Didn't have nutmeg so I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I also added half a bag of milk chocolate chips and an extra dollup of canned pumpkin (dough was a little dry).  Can't wait to try them with icing.  Nice, easy, and makes the house smell wonderful.

For taste, I give this cookie 5 stars-so yummy! However, I was looking for a pumpkin cookie with not-so-sticky batter. These were sticky-too sticky to form truly round cookie balls. I'll save this recipe for my family, but won't gift them.

I made these for a staff party. This recipe calls for way too much clove spice!    The cookies have an off texture, they tasted off, and turned out either doughy or dry.     I make cookies all the time, and I've NEVER had cookies turn out this poorly.

Absolutely delicious!! A friend made these and brought them for Thanksgiving and I had to have the recipe. I made them last night. :) Don't make them if you are trying to diet b/c they are addicting. I will be using them for my cookie exchanges this month!!   The only change I made was adding cinnamon to the glaze:)

This recipe was very good, and had alot of pumpkin flavor. I did a few things different and it still came out great. I used pumpkin pie filling and left out all the spices except for the cinnamon, I also used glueton free flour. The only thing I would change is the next time I think I would add either dried cranberries or crystalized ginger bits...just to add a little bit more sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to use up my pumpkin that I had.  These cookies were great!  Everyone loved them and my husband said I definately need to make them again.  I didn't put any glaze on them so I'm not sure how they would be with glaze, but they will be made again if my husband has anything to say about it.

Just for fun I added chocolate chips and instead of using this icing I used a brown sugar icing from the brown sugar cookie recipe on this site. They were amazing as I am sure the original is as well, I am just more of a brown sugar fan!

These are yummy cake like cookies. Although I mistakenly added a whole can of pumpkin instead of a cup they were still just as good. Definitely worth making a few batches :)

This was a hit with my daughter who doesn't even like pumpkin.  Co-workers also loved them.  Family wants me to make a small batch just for them.  Great Recipe.  I didn't change a thing.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and LOVE IT! My husband is not a huge cookie or sweet fan, but he loves the texture and taste of these wonderful cookies. He never wanted me to share the recipe with anyone because he wanted to make it a "family recipe". No matter where I take them, they are always gone before anything else. I'm going to try making them with Splenda and hoping they taste wonderful.   Also, I tried it with some Cool Whip, and it was truly amazing! I thought I was eating a Pumpkin Pie Cookie. It's making me so hungry right now just thinking about it, I want to make some more!

Very very good as is.  I did on a second batch use pumpkin pie spice in place of all the other spices, and usd half brown and half white sugar.  Frosed with cream cheese frosting from this site.  Really good!  DO NOT overbake.  Watch them carefully

Absolutly wonderful!  I followed the recipe almost exactly... I added a pinch more cinnamon to the cookie mixture and then I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing.  I also only baked them for 13 minutes and they were perfect!

I took this, well...a version... of this cookie to a cookie bake.  I increased the pumpkin by 1/4 cup.  I substituted ground ginger for cloves and put in 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of allspice.  I also drizzled them with melted cream cheese icing I had left over from some cupcakes.  There were delicious!!!

This was delicious.  I didn't use the glaze.  Instead I bought a can of cream cheese frosting and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften it and put it on top of the cookies.  It will harden to the touch.  I left the cookies rounded (didn't flatten at all) and baked 2 cookie sheets at a time for 20 minutes.

Fabulous, soft, cake-like pumpkin cookies.  At my kids' request, I added some chocolate chips into 1/2 the batter, and then iced those cookies as well.  What a nice, spicy fall treat!

Yum yum yum and yum.  These were a huge hit.  I used pumpkin spice and a can of pumpkin pie filling instead and 1 cp white and 1/2 brown sugar.

these cookies were okay. they were not what i was expecting. i baked my first batch and when i tasted them i realized that they were very cake like. almost like whoppie  pies. so i took the rest of the cookie dough and put it in a pastry bad and piped it into this mounds about 3 inches across and baked them. i added 4 ounces of cream cheese to the filling recipe and made whoppie pies. i would probably double the cinnamon and nutmeg next time.

Awesome!  Added chocolate chips but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Took them to a potluck and didn't bring a single one home, was also asked for the recipe twice.

The cookies themselves are delicious, but I agree with some of the other members that the frosting is a bit too sweet. I am thinking of trying what another member suggested and using cream cheese next time. Word to the wise...cooking time varies. The recipe says 20 minutes but they cooked in 12 in my oven. Great cookie, I just have to figure out the frosting to use for next time!

I added chocolate chips to this recipe and they were out of this world. However, they are a bit more cake like than cookie like. The second time I made this recipe, I reduced the amount of pumpkin to 2/3 cup. You could still taste the pumpkin, but the texture was much more like a cookie. Try adding cinnamon to the glaze to give the cookie an extra kick. I also went ahead and added rainbow sprinkles (tacky but so delicious!). When I brought these to my class, all my friends were asking for the recipe. These cookies are my new "thing."

i was a little sketchy about the glaze because it just souded impossible that so few ingredients could make something so good, but it turned out incrEDIBLE. i would recommend using more pumpkin then it says too if using all natural instead of canned.

Very good cookie.  Both my husband and inlaws really liked the flavor and texture.  I made a few modifications: 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 1/4 c ground oats, and remaining amount of flour was all purpose.  1 mashed sweet potato for pumpkin and equal amounts of brown sugar and white sugar.  These are quick, easy, and delicious.  These are so easy to make that a child could make them with some supervision.  Baking is a great confidence booster to children!

These were not what I was looking for at all.  Their cake-like texture is surprisingly similar to pumpkin bread, which left me wondering why I didn't just bake pumpkin bread. I don't mind a soft cookie, but these were more like mini-cakes than cookies.  Will continue searching for a pumpkin cookie recipe with a little more density and cookie like texture.

This is an excellent cookie. I omitted cloves and added an 1/8 tsp of ginger. Cookies came out moist like bite size pumpkin breads. We made the icing and dipped the tops. Great for breakfast!

I made these for my parents for Halloween and they were a big hit.  The only problem is it is difficult to quit eating them.  My dad doesn't like pumpkin but he loved these.  The icing is very good and really makes these wonderful.  I did add a little cinnamon to the icing but just because I like cinnamon.  The aroma while they were baking was wonderful.  These are definitely something I will make again.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I found this recipe several years ago and made them on a whim.  My friends and family LOVE these cookies!! They do come out very moist and cake like.  I doubled the spices and use fresh nutmeg (a microplane works great).  I also tried putting some cinnamon in the glaze and that's pretty tasty too!

WOW! I used 1 1/4 c. real pumpkin and 1 c. raw sugar + 1/2 c. brown sugar to get a richer flavor. Did not need the icing, though I am sure that's delicious. Would love to try these with pecans or walnuts! I will DEFINITELY make again!!!

yum I only used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Brown Sugar.  I iced them with a light cream cheese icing and then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  My kids loved these!

I made these today for my hubby's work and they are the most deliciously moist and pumpkin-y cookies I've ever had. I was going to do 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. However, when I got home I didn't have any brown so went with the recipe as listed and they are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh I cooked my cookies for only 10 minutes...we have an old oven and it seems to cook things faster.

Awesome. Made w/ my 6 and 4 year old boys.  Pretty much followed recipe.  I did use appplesauce instead of egg (b//c I was out of eggs) and reduced cooking time to 12 minutes.  Also used 2/3 c of brown sugar and 2/3 c of white sugar instead of 11/2 c white.  I did make the icing and thought it complemented the cookie perfectly.  Wonderful fall dessert!  Thanks.

I made these cookies tonight and they're fabulous! I used about half as much sugar as it called for, though.

These are really good. I was worried these would stick to the pan becuase they were really sticky when dropping them. I used parchment paper, and didn't have any problem getting them off the cookie sheet. Frosted with my own cream cheese icing.

I made these just as written and they were wonderful! I was a little worried at first because the dough was so sticky but they turned out perfect. I will definitely make these again. I sent some home with my son and got a text saying "OMG those cookies were awesome" :)

This cookie is so wonderful that you will want to share!  (That is, if there are any left!)  They are a soft cookie that can be enjoyed anytime of year, but are perfect during the autumn season.  The glaze adds a pretty touch that sets it off. Be sure to watch your baking time as to not over bake.  Only you can know your oven on how hot  it  bakes, so adjust baking time accordingly.  I like to add 1/4 tsp of ginger to the recipe to enhance the flavor.  Although I lprefer this glaze, you can use your desired amount of white canned frosting with 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon added to it.  Put the white frosting in microwave for a few seconds to make it a drizzling consistency and then drizzle with fork over cookies.  These cookies even tasted better the next day, that is if they last that long!

I found them a bit bland w/o the icing, and I didn't care much for the texture.  Adding cream cheese frosting helped and adding mini-chocolate chips helped too.

This was absolutely fantastic!  Everybody raved about these cookies, which were basically tasted like little pumpkin scones.  I did use 3 cups instead of 2 1/2 cups of flour.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the glazed topping.  It's probably fine just as is, but that's what I tried, and it was great.  Thanks so much.  I will make these again and again!

These were a hit with my friends, who said "they taste like fall."  Next time, I will put walnuts and raisins in half the batch for increased texture, which is my personal preference. For the glaze, I used maple flavoring, 2 TBSP Apple Cider, 1 TBSP milk, 2 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1 TBSP melted butter. The glaze turned out very well and complimented the cookie flavors.

This recipe is So good! I added some stuff to it.  For the sugar, I used 1C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar. I added a little more pumpkin (about 1/2C more). I had a bag of Hershey's cinnamon baking chips sitting in the cupboard, so I added about half of the bag to the mixture before baking.   Turned out fantastic. Thanks for sharing the recipe Gina! I will definitely make these again.

These cookies are AMAZING!  I didn't feel as guilty eating "just one more" because of the pumpkin in them. ;)  I made the following changes to the recipe:    3/4 cp brown sugar + 3/4 cp white sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cp white sugar)  3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (instead of the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves)    I also added some chocolate chips but these cookies are yummy enough that they are not needed.  I did not make icing for these cookies (they were gone before I could!) so I cannot comment on the icing.

I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The glaze was OK (a bit lumpy no matter how much I mixed it), but next time I think I will try a cream cheese frosting.  These would probably be good with raisins too!

I made these cookies last night, and I thought they were OK. But, today...they were outstanding! Definitely a "next day" cookie. They kept nice and soft right out on the counter. I only make changes to recipes depending on what I have on hand. Since I only had a can of pumpkin pie mix in my cupboard, I omitted the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. They were a HUGE hit. I'm making them again tonight because they're all gone, lol! I did add cinnamon to the icing recipe...very yummy. Thanks for this recipe!

So I actually found this recipe on another website, and they were called Pumpkin Blossoms. You know, like the Peanut Butter Blossoms!! Buy the Pumpkin spice hershey kisses and put them on after about 5 minutes of cooling. I also unwrapped all my kisses and put them in the freezer while the cookies were baking, so they wouldn't melt right away after being placed on the cookie. These were amazing, I also did the icing.. DELICIOUS! :) Happy Fall.

Excellent!  Made as directed, cooked 15 mins.... only used 2 tbsp of milk on glaze to make it more frosting like, than glaze.  Piped onto cookies using a ziplock bag with the corner cut out.

these were good cookies, a little too sweet, next time I will only use 1 cup sugar. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of flour because the batter was a little thin.

These are fantastic! Made two batches in one week!!  My boyfriend loves them!  The first time through I made it exactly as directed although I put the flour mixture into the wet mixture in two stages.  The second time I made it I added more cinnamon to my tastes and a little more of each spice.  Also on the second round I used cream cheese icing instead, just swapped the butter for the cheese.  They were fantastic.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!  It's a keeper!  If you thin the icing enough you can dunk the tops of the cookies in the icing and pull them out so you don't have to drizzle, or if you just like more sweetness go for it!!

We loved these cookies. Although I happened to be out of eggs and used a small amount of whipped cream they turned out amazing! I upped the amount of cloves as I have an unusual fondess for that spice.

wonderful! If you love pumpkin then you'll love these. I basically doubled all the spices and it was great, for my taste anyway. Good recipe, I'll be making these more often

We love these cookies!!! If you like pumpkin they are an absolute must!!!  I have made them over a dozen times and they turn out great everytime. I have tried some additions to the recipe just for fun (they don't NEED anything extra)!  I put cream cheese in the frosting, it was very tasty but the frosting stayed gooey(bad for stacking,but oh my goodness!!!!)... I crushed pecans and put them on top of the cookies when the frosting still wet.... I put a 1/2 cup of pecans in the cookies... All of these modifications were successful and very yummy!!

This cookie turned out fantastic. It has a cake-like texture and is moist and delicious. It is not too spicy or sweet and I guess you can glaze to your taste.  When I baked it, I greased and floured the cookie sheet and I think this helped it come off the pan easier. There were no instructions on how to prepare the cookie sheet, so I just played it by ear. Anyhow, it turned out GREAT!  I highly recommend it.

Fantastic cookies, I put a few raisins in the batter, not a lot but enough to add some texture and I used rum extract in the frosting instead of vanilla, then sprinkled it with walnuts.  This recipe is so great because the cookies always come out moist and you can modify it quite a bit to your taste without destroying the overall flavor

I found these great cookies - definitely cake like, and moist.  I frosted them with a burnt butter frosting since I was making that for something else, and it was delish!  I will definitely make these every autumn - they're a perfect seasonal cookie.  Highly recommended!

WOW!  These cookies are FANTASTIC!  I cannot stop eating since they came out of the oven.  There is NOTHING to change in this recipe, in fact I added a handful of raisins to the second batch.  The spices compliment the pumpkin perfectly.  They are so light and cakey, not a heavy cookie at all.  I've been eating them without the icing and they are perfect.  I think having the icing may make them too sweet...but it's definitely a personal preference.  Thank you so much for this delightful, tasty cookies recipe.  I will be making them often!  Cheers...

These were not my favorite.  They are more like a muffin top than a cookie.  These tasted bland to me.  Though they might have tasted better with fresher spices.

I thought they were just OK, not anything great. They were not moist enough, and the flavor didn't have the zip I was hoping for. Maybe like someone said to cut back on the flour and up the spices would help, but I don't think I will ever get around to try that.

When my wife makes these, I could sit down and eat the entire batch before too long.  I personally would go with the glaze. Cream cheese is too concentrated of a flavor and texture.  These cookies have to be balanced by the right topping.  Eating them plain reveals them to be a pretty straight forward flavor.  The glaze is indeed delicate and it's firmness, once set, balances the texture of the "cake" cookie.  I'd eat it with cream cheese if I had to, but that glaze is mind tingling.  I'm also not in favor of "icing" the cookie with the glaze, make it uneven.  The mouth wants to search for the glaze.  Lord, there's such a ying and yang to these.  And for heaven's sake don't spoil it with chocolate chips.  You're liable to throw the whole thing out of balance.  Amazing... these cookies are amazing.

Good, not great. I thought the spices really overwhelmed the pumpkin flavor, which was disappointing. Also wasn't overly fond of the icing, would have liked a cream cheese-based one better on these cookies. I did like the cakelike texture, so I may play around with this recipe again and decrease the spices. Thanks for sharing :)

Excellent cookie!  I am trying to eat healthier so I used whole wheat flour and skipped the icing.  They turned out great and didn't have a whole wheat flour taste, will make these all of the time!

These were very good. Instead of 1 cup of pumpkin I just used a 12 oz can and kept everything else the same. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the icing and covered the tops with it. I believe that the icing is a MUST. great recipe!

These cookies are so delicious!  I also made a few modifications: 1 cup w. sugar, 1/2 cup b. sugar, 1/4 tsp cloves and the big add in was a bag of milk chocolate chips.  This made them even more appearling to my boys.  Otherwise, the have a delicious cake like texture and are so moist and chewy.  Just absolutely devine!!

This cookies are so fantastic! My cookies turned out soft in the center and a little crunchy on the outside. I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves as I am not a big fan of either of those spices. The cookies tasted wonderfully! Now only if my drizzling skills would have made them look fantastic. I will continue working on my technique, but in the meantime you should really give this recipe a try.

Right out of the oven this might be the best cookie I ever had.  It has a cake-like consistency.  I will add more spices to the batter next time, as they got a bit blander as they cooled.  I added a little extra milk to the icing to make it thinner, but I didn't need to.  It ended up being to thin and I had to wait longer for the icing to set.

These are so tasty! I used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  I also used cream cheese icing and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar.  Although, they are just as good without icing!

I had extra pumpkin left over and thought I'd try this.  Man, am I glad I did. These are great and they'll be a huge hit at my office pot luck tomorrow.

These were outstanding...the second time I made them and adjusted them for ALTITUDE  To adjust for altitude and maintain the cakey (not cookie) like consistency of the cookie, I added an extra yolk, reduced the baking soda and flour each by 1/8 tsp, increased all the spices by ~1/2 tsp, doubled the vanilla, and reduced the sugar by 2 tbs (I used 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown, of which i took out the 2 tbs).   Make sure cookies cool completely before icing. I prefer dipping the tops as opposed to dropping on the icing with a fork, it looks much better

They were okay.  I think I needed to bake them for longer.  The middle was cooked through, but the next day they were soggy and mushy. (and I didn't cover them with a lid). The flavor was pretty good, but I was not a fan of the glaze.  If I make them again I'll do a cream cheese frosting.

I tried this recipe twice; it is a good recipe, but the cookies are soft and have a cake like texture. If you want a harder texture, then you wont like this recipe. I tried it with fresh pumpkin, because I had a little left over from something else I made (I wouldn't have made them otherwise) but I don't think that would have made a difference. I put half with chocolate chips so my friend who is not a pumpkin person would eat it, but it tasted better without. My father who is very traditional, did like them, but preferred the pie and cakes I made with pumpkin. I did not use the frosting because I think they are sweet enough without them, especially if you put chips. You must remember to grease the pan. I know that sounds obvious, but the first time I made it, I tried the first batch without greasing the pan, not noticing the recipe said to grease it. I had to throw the whole first batch out. I am used to making toll house cookie recipes which contain a little more fat, so you don't need to grease the pan. This recipe only calls for a half a stick of butter and really does not have a lot of fat, content, so the cookies really stick if you don't grease it. All in all, it is a great recipe, as long as you follow the instructions carefully.

These should be made the day before eating. Very dry right after baking and the spices hadn't given up their full flavor.

I LOVE THIS COOKIE, I accidentally added a 1teaspoon of all the spices and they still tasted wonderful, they pop that's for sure! I added chocolate chips to half the batch, great idea! Next time I want to make them with out messing up the measurements! The cake like cookie is amazing!

These are probably the best cookies I have ever made.  I followed the directions exactly, and they turned out amazing!  My house smells wonderful and I doubt that the cookies will make it through the night with 7 of us in the house.

I made these last night and they were delicious! For the spices, I took the advice of another reviewer and subbed 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice for the other spices. I only baked them at 12 minutes and then, as the oven got hotter, reduced them to 10. Also, the glaze didn't need any additional milk...you could probably get by with a little less than 3 tbsp.

I love this recipe - yummy cakey pumpkin cookies!  5 stars with one caveat - per other reviews - you need to add more spices than what is called for in the recipe. I think that one user substituted pumpkin spice - i added more spices and added some spice to the glaze as well. The first time I made this i used the butter called for in the glaze and it never set well enough for me. The second time I omitted the butter and it came out perfectly.  This recipe has earned its place in my holiday cookie (or anytime cookie) collection

HOLY COW these are AMAZING. Probably the best and most moist cookie Ive ever made. Next time I'll prob add more of the spices for a bit more punch, or try some chocolate chips, but leaving it just as it is with the icing is superb.

I made these to enjoy with our family on Halloween night, and they were a big hit.  My mother-in-law loved them so much she said that I could give them to her as a gift! They are definitely more cake-like than cookie-like.

This recipe was a big hit with family and friends. proclaimed this is the best pumpkin cookie recipe yet! MY grandkids loved it. Made a double batch and then had to do a single batch for our house. And we found our 14 month old granddaughter with the container stuffing her mouth full. :)

Good, but extremely sweet. They are a great cookie to be served with dark roast coffee. I only got 24 cookies out of the recipe, but I think I might have been making them large. Also, I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.

These cookies are a little soft inside (cake-like) and full of flavor.  The icing is a simple; I just added a pinch of cinnamon and immediately sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the cookies.   When I bake or if I the time I try to measure everything out the night before, so I can be sure I have everything I need.  This extra step saves time and ensures unnecessary mistakes.    Because I use a small ice cream scooper, the recipe made enough for me to give a dozen to my sister, my mom and a few to my neighbor.  The next day they called and said “the Pumpkin pie cookies” were delicious.  Now, they want to order some for their family and friends for the Holidays.  I’m adding this to my Holiday cookie file.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I will try this one again, using it step by step. I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 brown & white sugars, and added about 1/4 cup more pumpkin, because that was the rest of it. (Silly to see it go to waste).  I DIDN'T have problems with the cookies flattening out, because of the add'l pumpkin.  ALSO, Pampered Chef Stoneware and a #50 Cookie Scoop gave me just the right mount of cookies. I baked them for the full 20 minutes. I also added mini chocolate chips to half the dough.  As I stated earlier, I'll try these again and see if I get a fluffier texture, like I was expecting. I had these types of cookies before, but maybe it was my modifications that made them different from what I was looking for.

A great pumpkin cookie. I used one can (15 oz) of pure pumpkin, and doubled all of the spices. This was great! Slather it with some cream cheese frosting, and this turns into my favorite cookie.

One word: AMAZING!  I iced half the batch, and left the rest plain with no icing. Honestly,I could have it either way! I've never made pumpkin cookies before and when I saw the "batter", I was a little skeptical. It didn't look like it would be cookie-shaped at all! But, needless to say, after 14 mins in the oven, they came out perfectly moist and chewy. YUM! perfect for fall.

Wonderful cookies! Made recipe as given; 1/3 plain, added dried cranberries to 1/3 of the batter and raisins to the other 1/3. I know these will not last long.

Absolutely delicious! These cookies are easy to make and really capture the best flavors of fall. I followed the recipe exactly but in my oven they baked perfectly in only 13 minutes.  I chose to add cinnamon to the icing which enhanced both the look and taste of this treat. Enjoy. I did. :)

NOTE: i recommend spraying your cookie sheet.  i also used half butter flavored shortening and they were still great.  I make these exactly according to recipe, only adding cinnamon to the glaze, which makes it much prettier.  they are my husband's favorite and one of my favorite parts of fall!  everyone i give these to LOVES them!

These cookies were great!  I took them to a party and they were loved by all.  I only used one cup of sugar (1/2 white and 1/2 brown).  I also used all spice in replace of the cloves and I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the icing.  Perfect.

This type of cookie (more cake-like) is not usually my 5-star favorite; however, this recipe is so versatile that I did give it 5-stars.  I did substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for white and did the same for flour substituting 1 cup of wheat flour in.    I made 3 different icings: the recipes (powdered sugar icing), cream cheese icing, and Pumpkin Cookie V brown sugar/powdered sugar icing which I liked best. My DH liked the cream cheese the best. I split the brown sugar icing in half and mixed toasted pecans in. On the cream cheese and regular icing, I alternated sprinkling iced cookies with cinnamon or toasted pecan pieces. It looked like I had a whole tray of different kinds of cookies out of the same batch. Guaranteed to please everyone! I did add pecans to my batter to the last half of my batter as well and then finally made some with mini chocolate chips (which surprisingly, I didn't really care for even though).   Thanks for the good fall pumpkin recipe. Now I have 3 pumpkin favorites: pumpkin pie, pumpkin dessert, and these cookies.

Very good, I cut the white sugar by half a cup and added half a cup brown sugar.  Also, this recipe made double the frosting needed.

Delicious!! One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made. The only thing is, I see no reason to flatten at all before cooking. I dropped them into tablespoon sides balls for cooking. Also, use a homemade cream cheese frosting. The cookies themselves, though, are wonderful!

These turned out perfectly.  Everyone asked me how I got them to be so soft and moist (hint: it's the pumpkin).   I made the following changes: used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added cinnamon to the icing.  Half of the batch had chocolate chips added in.  I personally thought the cookies could have gone without the icing at all, but I've only gotten positive reviews!

Great recipe! Substituted 1/2 of the white sugar with brown, used allspice instead of cloves and added extra pumpkin- so good! I also added cinnamon to half of the glaze (per other reviewers suggestion) and instant espresso to the other half- both were really good!

These cookies are delicious!  Much more of a "cakie" than a "cookie" but very autumnal and good!  I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown and used a cream cheese frosting instead of the icing and found them to be quite good!

I made these cookies for my nieces 9th Birthday party. This is a very picky group. If it doesn't consist of chocolate nobody will even touch it. Not only did the kids love them, so did all of the adults! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The leftovers were still very moist 3 days later.

These cookies turned out WONDERFUL!  I just drizzled the icing over the top of the cookies instead of spreading it.  These are fantastic because they're not too sweet.  My 16 year-old daughter cllaed them "rich and delicious"!!

These are decently tasty.  They're more muffin tops than cookies, though.  They also have a slight baking soda flavor, so I recommend cutting the baking soda a little bit.

This recipe made me fall in love with baking! Every fall I make these and they are a hit! This season already I've made 10 dozen of them to pass out to friends and family. Fall just isn't the same without these cookies.  One hint: when placing the dough on cookie sheets use two spoons and then after all the dough is placed go back and shape the cookies with your hands.  I found this way keeps my hands clean and gives the cookies a more rounded shape.

These are very tasty! The flavor and spice are great. I substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown, just because I enjoy the taste of the brown with the spices. I'm not a huge fan of the cake like texture, I would prefer a more dense cookie. I think this recipe would make excellent muffins.

I don't really know if they are the best as it was my first attempt of Pumpkin Cookies... but they are so tasty and moist that I wouldn't change the recipe for an other one. Even my husband who really don't like pumpkin ate all his part and try to eat mine... I usually froze my pumpkin raw. I peel it and cut the flesh in cube. As we don't have canned pumpkin puree in France, I used my frozen cubes. I let them in the fridge all the night and then I microwaved them 9 min. I separated the flesh from the water (press the pumpkin well to extract all the water) and pureed the flesh in my blender. And it worked perfectly.

Wow, these are good. I think I'll be making these every fall! (at least) As others have said, they're a soft, almost cake-like cookie, perfectly spiced. I made them exactly as the recipe said, save the icing which I didn't (after tasting them) feel they needed. Took about 14 minuted to bake. Make sure you smooth out the tops before baking (with damp hands makes it easier) as they don't "smooth out" too much in the oven.  YUMM!!

These cookies turned out GREAT.  I already have requests to make them again; my dad actually said these are probably his favorite cookie now!  I made one small adjustment and used only 1/4 teaspoon of cloves but I am not sure if this make a difference or not!  I would recommend to anyone looking for a yummy pumpkin cookie recipe!!

Pretty good cake like cookie. The dough is a little sticky to work with but I like the texture of the baked cookie, the taste is ok but feels like it's missing something.. I might try brown AND white sugar next time I make these to see if I get a better flavor. Will make again, it is not a bad tasting cookie.

I absolutely LOVED these! The pumpkin/spice flavor is perfect but not too sweet, the texture is soft like a cake, not a cookie really, but it works well for this recipe. I didn’t have cloves, but used allspice instead, and I slightly mounded the measurements of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to add more spice flavor =) I also did 1 ¼ cups white, and ¼ cup brown sugar to keep the cookie tender (not sure if this is needed since the cookie came out so tender anyway). I did a little more than a full cup of pumpkin puree by adding in a few more spoonfuls of it, to keep it moist and to add more pumpkin flavor. Also, since I heard these should be a little sweeter, I mixed in some splenda as well. The batter was a very sticky, dropped by bigger spoonfuls and smoothed with my finger.  Baked for 12 minutes, these came out looking beautiful, round, and puffy, with some cracks on the top. Very moist and delicious. I added cinnamon to the icing and drizzled a good amount on with a fork. PERFECT. Will make again and again!

These cookies were great.  The only change I made was substituting 1/2 cup white sugar for the brown sugar.  I used a different icing, but the cookies are so good, they don't really need icing.  Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper!

I have been making these cookies for about five years and I love them along with everyone I know.  Family and friends want to know "when are you baking those cookies!"  I have to say I don't understand when SO many people say they changed this or altered that.  The recipe is fabulous the way it was shared with us!

This recipe was really easy and tasted just like pumpkin pie.  A keeper.  I substituted the butter with applesauce.

*Exactly* what I was looking for.  Perfect cookie, no need to change a thing (although I will not even add the icing..no need).  I LOVE them. Thank you SOOOO much for the recipe!!!

I am editing this from a 4 to 5 stars. I followed this recipe exactly as written and they were yummy cookies, although I wished they had more of a cookie texture and less of a cakey muffin-top texture. However, upon eating more and making a 2nd batch, they really are delicious, just a cakier texture.  I added chocolate chips to some of my most recent batch and LOVED it - more muffin like, although my boyfriend said he could take or leave the choc chips.

My boyfriend and I just made these (they came out of the oven about 10 minutes ago).  I made them HUGE and I've had about two of them already!!  (Like the whole batch will make around 16 cookies, huge).  These are sooo delicious, I could not have imagined how great these would be.  The recipe came out perfect (although I substituted the cloves for pumpkin pie spice), like a mixture of pumpkiny-goodness and spice cake!!  Fantastic! :D ^_^

This is a very good cookie recipe, cakey and lots of spicey flavor.  I cut the nutmeg in half, the flavor is too strong for me, and I used a cream cheese glaze.

These weren't spectacular, but were good enough for a 4 star.  Only thing I did different was used only 1/4 tsp cloves, because I thought with 1/2 tsp the clove flavor would be too overpowering.

I made these for a party and ended up leaving them at home. The icing was delicious, but the cookie was just so floury that I couldn't justify taking them anywhere for people outside my family to eat.

I love these cookies. I love pumpkin so it's great when I find a good recipe for it.  I didn't use cloves because I didn't have any on hand so I used cinn, ginger, and nutmeg.  They are really moist, so I think I'll just be leaving them out instead of in a container.  Thanks for the recipe!

Other people have called these cookies "muffin tops". I have to agree. I thought the flavor was good but very muffin/cake like. The batter was very sticky and hard to shape the cookie, so I put the batter in a zip-loc bag and piped them on to the cookie sheet. They came out nice and round. I also dipped each cookie twice in the frosting before I let my daughter decorate them. oh, by the way, my 1 year old loved them, too

I love pumpkin, so these cookies were a great way to use it.  I did make the icing and it was good.  The cookies did go pretty hard pretty quickly, though.

I've made this many times and always have to bring the recipe for others. I follow these modifications:I add a little more pumpkin; 1/2 c brown sugar instead of white; 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of all spices. I also make the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and they are perfect!

Very, very good. Yummy flavor and fantastic texture. The only thing I did different was add cinnamon to the icing as suggested by other reviewers. That put these cookies over the top.

These are delicious!  I have to 'vegan-ize' these cookies since I have a daughter allergic to eggs and dairy.  For each egg, I use 1T flax meal mixed with 3T water, and I use canola oil instead of butter.  They come out sooooo good!  I'm sure they would be just as yummy as is, with the eggs and butter.  These are so soft and the spices make them taste great!  You have to try them!

I just made these for the first time since coming home from school (my whole sorority loves them!) and my family all wants more! They are a wonderfully moist, cakey cookie and the icing really gives it that extra kick of sweetness. Very well spiced!

Oh these are SO GOOD!! I made them on Tuesday, and they held up beautifully until Thursday afternoon (Thanksgiving). Just whatever you do, don't cover them up. It will cause the icing to get melty and gooey. My icing had a nice hard texture and everyone loved it!

These were pretty good. I was going to rate it four stars, but first I would have to see how it is with these adjustments, which I would follow next time: as one other reviewer said, add more pumpkin and possibly more sugar--but, then, probably reduce butter so they're not overly moist. All in all, a good way to use my leftover pumpkin.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. So moist and soft! It filled the house with an amazing aroma while they baked. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. They didn't last very long at work and everyone asked for the recipe! Will definitely make again.

A great fall treat! I used a bit (1/4 c.) more pumpkin and swapped 1/2 c. of the white sugar with brown sugar, as someone recommended. The icing measurements made way too much icing - if you are only going to drizzle it, you could make half the amount and it would be fine. It's also definitely worth adding some cinnamon to the icing! yum!

I made these cookies without the frosting.  I found it to be a really good pumpkin cookie recipe.  I added a bit more pumpkin than called for and I got cookies that were super moist - almost like pumpkin bread cookies.  Note: The more spice you add to these, the better they taste.  I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp cinnamon.
I used brown sugar instead of white and  I only used 1 cup.

Made these with the thought that my kids would turn their nose up and not even try them. It probably was the icing that tempted them, and much to my surprise the loved them! Even had to send a few home with a little friend that was over. The kids begged for another after dinner. I will have to make another batch later this week - and some for Thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe! Didn't change a thing accept baked them for 12-13 minutes.

Divine! The spices reminds me of the holidays and my whole house smelled good when I made them. Very cake like and the other reviewers were right about how moist the cookie is. I left the out all day and they stayed perfectly fresh. The only modification to the recipe that I made was the icing application. I poured the icing in to a zip-lock bag and cut a tiny corner off the bottom then squeezed the icing on to the cookie.

So good!  Took other reviewers' advice and frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  I think next time I'll add chocolate chips as well.

Great recipe! These are sort of spongie, which isn't what I'd expected. At first I was concerned about the texture, but once I ate a few I realized how great they are!

I made these over the weekend when I couldn't find my recipe..these didn't seem to have a lot of taste to me.  I even added more pumpkin pie spice to the recipe.  Not really sure what I did wrong.  I won't be making them again.  They did make a pretty looking cookie though, nice and fluffy!

These were a hit! I love that they are 'cakey' and soft! Like a friend said...it's like a muffin top! I iced them with a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze. Very delicious! They freeze well too!

So yummy! My boys are huge pumpkin pie fans this is so much easier. We have a wheat allergy so I made it with 1 cup potato starch, 1 /14 cup rice flour and increase to butter to 3/4 cup. I also had to grease the cookie sheets

Delicious!!! I followed to a T except for the icing.  I didn't really think they needed it after tasting them, so I made half the amount called for and subbed maple syrup for the vanilla.  It was nice, I lightly drizzled over the cookies and had just enough of it.  They are wonderful - the only thing I'll do different next time is make more! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious, soft and spicy!
I doubled the recipe to use the entire can of pumpkin- turned out great. I also tweaked the icing a little by adding a dash of cinnamon and using orange extract instead of vanilla.

AMAZING COOKIES! My coworkers scarfed them down today.  Here is the recipe I used for frosting (from another recipe on the site):
CINNAMON FROSTING: 
1/2 cup butter, softened 
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 
2 tablespoons milk 
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Amazing! So moist and cakey. I made these a day ahead for a Halloween party and had to hide some from my boyfriend. 
I did follow the advice of other reviewers and increased the pumpkin to 15oz of homemade puree and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup Splenda for Baking.
Because the dough was so sticky, I floured my hands and a board with confectioner's sugar and patted them down to about 3" rounds and skipped the icing.
I also used all freshly ground spices which gave them an awesome punch that I'm not sure they would have had otherwise.
Will certainly make again... soon!

This is a great cookie recipe. Everyone in my family loved them.  They were gone in one evening.  The one thing I changed was adding an entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of one cup.  Also, used the cream cheese icing recipe instead of the one provided.  Great cookie, will make again.

I think these cookies are absolutely terrific!  I made them as directed with the addition of a touch of lemon extract to the frosting.  Just because I love the lemon/pumpkin combo.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

These are fabulous pumpkin cookies - a little like scones, but less dry. I did make the frosting a bit thicker the second time I made them by using 3/4 T butter and a tad less milk.

Fabulous recipe!  The icing came out too thick for me to drizzle, so I added in a bit more vanilla & milk.  This made it more of a drizzle consistency & not as overpoweringly sweet.  I've never been good at drizzling with a fork, so after mixing the icing, I poured it into a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup so I could use the spout to drizzle.  I can't wait to take these to work!

These cookies are so moist and delicious.
Just the right amount of spice and in the icing I did add just a little pumpkin spice. Also, like many others have stated, don't store them in an airtight container or they will turn to mush in a couple days.

TIP: To easily flatten out cookies, dab your finger in some water and smooth around the dough.  This will prevent the "peaks" some are experiencing.  Replaced half of the white sugar with light brown sugar; used "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter."  The spice flavors are wonderful!  Also, to evenly coat with the icing, just turn the cookie upside down once cooled, and dip it in.  Much easier than frosting with a knife!  I baked for 13-14 min. at the suggested temp.  Enjoyed..and will make again!

Very disappointing.  They came out looking like scones, all lumpy and prickly.  They tasted ok, but really flour-y, so not even that redeemed them.  Admittedly I'm a bit of a beginner, but I followed the directions exactly and they just did not work out.  I skipped the icing.  They were too ugly/tasteless to save!

This was the best cookie I had!
I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of all white.
I also used ginger in place of nutmeg. I also added cinnamon to the icing.
They were unbelievable!!

Wonderful tasting cookies.  Especially good warm out of oven.  Used double amount of pumpkin pie spice and cloves.  Another reviewer was correct in that due to moisture content, cookies would get soggy and damp if kept in closed container.

On the first day I baked these they were maybe 2 1/2 stars but after sitting overnight I think they tasted much better. I used powdered sugar, orange juice and pumpkin pie spice for the glaze and it really added a lot to the cookie. These are very "cakey" for a cookie. Good, but I will keep searching for my perfect pumpkin cookies.

These cookies are delicious!! I tweaked the recipe a bit though. I didn't have any ground cloves, so I used about 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger instead (that is what I had on hand). Also, instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1 cup of white, and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar.

Once the cookies cooled completely, I placed the glaze in a ziplock bag and cut a small hole in the corner to drizzle. I stuck them in the fridge for a bit so the glaze would harden. They look as good as they taste! I will definitely make these again!!!

I thought these cookies we're very good..and so did my friends I shared them with.The only thing I would change is maybe put a little more spice in them next time.

These are AWESOME! I did tweak it a little because I can never leave a recipe as is :P The first changes were actually an accident! Instead of putting only 1/2 tsp of the cloves & nutmeg I put in a full tsp. I guess to kinda "even it out" and/or just add more yumminess to it I added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice as well. With the pumpkin puree I did about 1 1/4 cup as well. For the icing I added 1T of cinnamon & instead of using a fork to drizzle it on the cookies I put the icing in a plastic ziplock baggie and cut off one corner just to make a small hole for drizzling... worked like a charm! Using the medium cookie dough scoop I got 34 delicious cookies! I split the batch with hubby to take to work and were all gone within an hour! This recipe is definatly a keeper!

These were sooo good! I made directly as instruced with just a couple of minor alterations. The icing calls for 3T of milk which made a really thick consistency. I used 5T and it was still thick and did not "drizzle" well. I ended up adding a dash of cinnamon to the icing and iced the cookies instead of drizzling. They were soft and very good! They were gone in a day. This recipe is a keeper!

Technically this is 4 1/2 stars.  These are delicious little pillows of pumpkin!  Very good.  I had a party and everyone raved at how delicious they were.  They were cakey, but light.  My only issue was that the icing on them got mushy and runny after a day.  They really had to be kept in the fridge.  By 2 days, they were starting to look unattractive because of the icing and just getting smooshed in general.  Very delicious and lovely the day of though.

Oh my, these cookies, are simple, and delicious! You are so right, they just get better with time. My boyfriend and I tried them with some coffee that we doctored with O'mara's irish cream liquor. It was a comforting treat on a cold fall night. Thank you for sharing it!

I followed the recipe except used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also add some cinnamon to the glaze which made it a beautiful color and taste. This is just what I want in a cookie. I loved it I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. My husband and daughter also loved them. A++

Really nice cookie. It is bready, but in a good way. I thought the glaze was okay, but very sugary (obviously). I think this would be much better with cream cheese icing. I topped each cookie with a walnut. I might even add walnuts to the dough next time. Overall, pretty good.

These cake like cookies are wonderfully moist and tasty.  I iced half of them with the glaze and left half plain.  I preferred plain the best, whereas my kids liked them better with the glaze.  I am definitely making these again, although I will use cream cheese frosting as someone else suggested.

These cookies were really great!  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar and added ground ginger. I made half the batch plain and half with butterscotch chips. Both ways were delicious! I did not make icing though, as that would have made them too sweet.

Very good cookies when you don't put on the icing. With the icing, I felt like it would be like eating pumpkin pie with icing on top so you couldn't really taste the pie. The cookies are very good without any icing on top. If you do use the icing they recommend, I would use very thin stripes across the top of the cookies.

These are soft but I didn't have a problem with the texture.  I made a few changes; bumped up the nutmeg and cloves to 1 tsp., used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. light brown sugar, and used slightly over a teaspoon of vanilla.  These are definitely better the next day, so if you have the time, figure that into the recipe.

i have made these cookies too many times to count, it's now a regular request from my family and friends. the recipe is great but i make a few adjustments. i use all whole wheat flour, substitute the butter for applesauce, use 4 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tsp of nutmeg, 2 tsp of cloves, and add 1 or 2 tsp of ginger. i also add 1 c of chocolate chips, and do not glaze the cookies. my cookies come out with a pumpkin-pie like taste, and a dense yet fluffy, cake-like consistency.

I have made this recipe several times now and it continually turns out amazing!  I have even used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour with the same delicious result.  The cake-like texture really melts in your mouth. I love to make them in the spring and summer as a preview for the fall months ahead! They freeze well too - as this recipe makes a lot of cookies!

These are delicious, but they don't keep very well as they start to get rather soggy.  REALLY good the first day.

I actually made these this past fall, more than once and they disappeared everytime!  Made with the icing the first time, and without the other times.  The icing is great, but the cookies can stand alone and are a reasonable snack after school without the icing.  I am craving these even though it is still summer - I may just have to make a batch this week!

Pretty good. These cookies are have a softer, more cake-like texture which is surprising. They are also very mild in flavor, so don't expect a big pumpkin taste. Apart from that though, they are very good cookies.

this cookie was PERFECT! it was soft and big and cake-like. the only down side was that i made them on a humid day and the dough was a little sticky. i will absoultely make them again, regardless of the humidity issue. the icing was great too. i halved the icing recipe and covered half of the cookies with the icing and i covered the other half of the batch with a cream cheese frosting. the cream cheese ones had a better apperance but both the icing and the frosting were great!

a definite KEEPER! :)

This cookies were so good!  I did add more spices and pumpkin as mentioned by many others.  I baked a full cookie sheet and iced them with the original icing and found out that they needed something, so... I put raisins & cranraisins and that did it!  PERFECT!  I kept them in air tight container and after 2 weeks they still taste wonderful and they didn't dry out at all.  I gave them to my card group as a cookie exchange and they went over BIG!  I WILL be making these again!

I loved the cake like texture of these - so light and fluffy. I added 2 cups of milk chocolate chips and added more pumpkin spice. The icing on top along with the chips added enough sweetness and spice for me but I was going more for the spicy pumpkin flavor. I have already made this recipe three times because I am getting so many requests from family for these cookies.

Incredibly Delicious!!! SO Light & Fluffy... I had enough pumpkin to double the recipe. The fist I made just as written. The second batch I made, the only change I made was, I added a cup of walnuts & iced ½ of them with cream cheese icing & ½ without any icing. To tell you the truth they are so Yummy they don't even need the icing.

These were delicious.  I didn't love that the texture was cake-like but I went in expecting that and it would be wrong to complain about the taste.  You definitely need the icing for sweetness and presentation.  I'm sure I will make these again!

I made these the day after Thanksgiving instead of braving the stores. They turned out well, using 1 cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar as others have suggested. I don't know if I would call them cookies, they're more like mini pumpkin bread bites. Not quite as dense as a pumpkin bread, they have a light texture, but if you're like me and eat half of a loaf these things are great for portion control.

I've gone over my ingredients and the method and instructions, and think I did everything correctly, but I didn't care for these. Maybe a little more spice needed? The pumpkin stood out, but it seemed a little overwhelming. The icing added a nice finish to it, but I don't think this one will stay in my recipe box. Sorry...

These cookies are exceptional!!!
My kids were eating them before I could get the icing on them.  I would not change a single thing.  These will be a tradition at all holidays in our house.
Thanks for yet another great recipe!!

These were good the first day, but after that they were soggy and kinda gross.  I don't think I'll make them again.  I think they could've been a little more pumpkin-y tasting as well!

I thought these turned out wonderful. A nice, not so sweet cookie perfect for fall and holidays. The cookie is sort of cake like and I followed other reviewers suggestion for not storing these in an air tight package so they wouldn't get mushy. I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing when I make these again.

These are phenomenal!  I am chocoholic - but I LOVED these cookies. I thought they tasted best w/o the icing.  Next time I will make them w/o icing, or lightly drizzle the icing on top (I dipped the top of each cookie in the icing instead of drizzling and it was too much).

This is a REALLY good pumpkin cookies recipe. I made 3 dozens for my class and everyone loved them. I did use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of just 1 1/2 cup of white sugar. Oh yeah, they taste better with icing!!

Very soft and very good. Everyone at my mom's office and my school loved eating them. Some people even had two or three! The cookies didn't burn on the bottom at all. The Dough was a bit hard to work with, but the finished product was delicious.

These where so moist and soft.  Next time I'm going to add maple syrup to the icing as suggested by some other reviewers.  Even though the icing was fine, since the cookie itself is so flavorfull--I think the icing should be too.

One day my daughter decided that she wanted to butcher our pumpkin that we wanted to use to make a jack-o-lantern. So we cooked and pured the pumpkin and put it in the freezer.We were trying to find some great pumpkin recipes, that werent pumplin pie (I hate pumpkin pie), we came across this one. We have it a try and BOY, WAS IT GOOD! THe whole kitchen smelled like christmas and when they came out, the unique cake-like texure was awesome. It was like mini pumpkin spice cakes. We acually made our own cream cheese icing and it was a hit at our family scrabble night (Yes! Scrabble night...). My daughter even took them to school for snack and she is A a VERY picky eater. You should be very proud of this recipe. it is the most requested dessert at our family gatherings. And its actually a little healthy!

These cookies are really tasty.  I used a cookie scoop to drop the cookies directly onto the cookie sheet.  No need to flatten the cookies.  They will come out perfectly.  For the icing, I used a wire whisk.  I kept the cookies on a baking rack (with a cookie sheet underneath).  I just dipped the whisk into the icing and then drizzled over the cookies.  These cookies are soft and delicious.

Yumm! After a taste test I decided not to add the icing.  Maybe next time.  I did add mini chocolate chips to the batter.

For High Altitude I adjusted the baking powder to be 3/4 tsp, add 1/4 of flour, and scaled back on the sugar (if you typically bake in high altitudes this shouldn't be a surprise). I did use splenda for baking too.  This cookie batter is a tad sticky.  

If you place the dough covered in the fridge for say 7-10 minutes it'll form nicely as you place your mounds on the cookie sheet.

Perhaps sans the choc chips and without icing these may be a little one dimesional for the palate.  Play around with this one!  My house smells like the hoidays :)

I made these today but instead of icing, I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter.  The family gives them a thumbs up!

This cookie is awesome!!!! I followed the recipe exactly. I was nervous to make this cookie because some of the reviews that the batter is very sticky but I had no trouble at all since I used a cookie scooper, thank goodness. It looked exactly like the picture. Also, the frosting is very very sweet so I suggest using as much or as little as your tastebuds desire. The fork technique mentioned in the recipe to cover the cookie with frosting doesn't work very well. I placed the frosting inside a zip lock bag and cut a small hold, then drizzled it over the cookies. Worked like a breeze.

I make cookies every week for my school's band, and this is the only recipe that's lasted for less than an hour! I added 3 tablespoons of cold coffee to the icing, and it worked very well.

I used freshly ground nutmeg and cloves and the cookies still didn't have enough spice to them. I'd double the cinnamon/cloves/nutmeg next time and keep the icing plain, as I added a bunch of cloves and cinnamon to the icing to give the cookies more flavor.

I made these cookies for the first time last night, and they were just what I was looking for!  The recipe made about 21 large (3-inch) cookies, and they took no longer than 15 minutes in my oven.  The cookies are thick, but rather lightweight and cakey (though not at all dry or airy).  The level of spices is perfect, and so is the icing; however, I needed only half of the amount of icing the recipe calls for.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Really delicious cookie, but more like the top of a muffin than your traditional cookie.  I took a previous reviewer's advice and added cinnamon to the icing.  A new Fall favorite!

Soooo delicious!  I am not even a big fan of pumpkin.  I was worried I didn't bake them long enough because at the end of 20 minutes in the oven, they were very mushy on the top still, but after they cooled they were totally fine, very cake like!  So good.

These are so good! I added extra of all of the spices, and also added pumpkin pie spice to the icing. After they were iced I sprinkled them with Crate and Barrel's finishing sugar. These will be made again and again!

Almost like muffins, very tasty. I could imagine using this recipe as a base and adding raisins, chocolate chips, nuts etc if you wanted. If you are in a hurry you can sprinkle with powdered sugar (if you don't have time for frosting).

This is a light fluffy cookie that totally satisfied my pumpkin fix!  I mixed in a bag of white chocolate chips instead of icing the cookies and used 1 c. white and .5 c. brown sugars.  For spices I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1.5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 a teaspoon of chai spice.  Yum!

These were easy to make!  I usually mess up cookies but these came out tasty.  I replaced butter with applesauce and oil.  I added more pumpkin and 3 tablespoons of coconut. I used half white and half wheat flour. Oh and for the icing I melted some cream cheese frosting in the microwave.

I had some leftover pumpkin to use, so I gave this recipe a try and let me say I was not disappointed with the results.  They are very moist.  I think the icing adds a nice touch, although they are fine without too.

These are the BEST pumpkin cookies I've tried. I make them for potlucks and fundraisers all the time and they're the first to go! I follow the recipe exactly usually, but sometimes do half brown/half white sugar (depending on what I have on hand). YUMMY cookies that are perfect for fall.

I had extra cans of pumpkin sitting in the pantry, and thought I would try something new.  These were awesome!! I took them to work and everyone raved over them.  Now I will start taking them every fall for special treats.

These cookies are going to become a fall tradition for me.  My family is big on anything and everything pumpkin flavored when autumn comes around and they loved these cookies.  I added raisins and chopped nuts, which go perfectly with these since they have a cake-like texture. I also love adding a glaze when I make cookies, and it goes wonderfully with these.

I had a hard time deciding what to rate this cookie. They are very good & I love all things pumkin, but the texture could improve. The recipe written for the glaze needs to be altered also. Cut the milk to 2T. and increase the butter to 4T. otherwise it tasted wrong - also add cinnamon to the frosting. I guess I'm comparing these to my all time favorite pumpkin cookie from D'Amico & Sons in Minnesota - their cookies are the perfect "cakey" texture. I think I will try these again with oil instead of butter - that may make the difference!

The cookies lacked depth - so I replaced half the white sugar with  brown sugar, replaced the cloves with ginger and didn't bake for the whole time stated...but I live at high altitude so that that into consideration.  I also added a little more pumpkin and 1 cup of chocolate chips.

This is an incredible cookie when made with FRESH pumpkin. (Clean, gut and cut to fit into large pasta pot with 2 inches of water, boiling for about 45 minutes until tender. Scoop out meat (careful - HOT!) With fresh pumpkin, the flavor is so good, it's better without the icing, which ends up overpowering the cookie. I tried it the second time with canned pumpkin and it was nothing to write home about.

These are fabulous.  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly.  Now when I make them, I usually add chopped dried cranberries and pecans.  Either way, this is a great recipe!

These Are Disgusting, Only Thing I Substituted Was Shortning For Butter Because I'm Lactose Intolerant.. I Highly Doubt Butter Would Of Made The Difference.. They Don't Taste Like Pumpkin At All, They Are Very Hard Betime They're Done Cooking,

Very, very good!  Nice, cakey texture.  My son's kindergarten class gobbled these up (as well as the parents!)  I tinted the icing half orange and left the other half white and it looked very pretty. These will be added into the holiday cookie collection, and probably will be made throughout the year as well.

so good, fantastic texture...i added some pumpkin pie spice to the icing, added a nice extra bit of flavor.

also, I didn't read the recipe very carefully, and used an entire small can of libby's pumpkin (I think about 15 oz) instead of just a cup.  turned out more like pumpkin muffin tops, which my family LOVED

This is a great recipe. I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for a cup of the all-purpose flour and substituted 1/2 c brown sugar for the white sugar. I used store-bought cream cheese frosting instead of making it. My neighbor said these were the best cookies she's ever had!

Yum. These cookies are so good. I make them every year for our Christmas bake sale.  They are more like mini-cakes rather than a chewy cookie though. But that's half the reason why I like them! So if you are expecting chewy, stick with a chocolate chip cookie recipe. The only changes I made are to use half brown, half white sugar and only a total of 1 cup. I also add 1/4 cup of wheat germ. I only put a sprinkle of the nutmeg and use a whole small can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup. I also throw in a cup of milk chocolate chips. Then for the icing I use only 1 cup of icing sugar, the 1 tbsp butter and 1 tsp vanilla and then add milk until it thins. I recommend refrigerating these in an airtight container as they get really moist as they sit and sometimes the icing stays drippy instead of hardening slightly.
Great recipe for fall and smells SO good while baking!

WONDERFUL!!!  I have made these quite a few times and everyone loves them!  I make them almost every week during the fall because everyone requests them!  I usually throw in about 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin.  I also put in mini chocolate chips. Very good, but tones down the pumkpin flavor tho.  GREAT COOKIES!!!

I am always a little scared to try pumpkin cookies because they turn out and taste very good but seem to stick together when I store them.  I just baked this recipe, it is excellent.  The bottom of the cookies are nice and golden brown and not damp at all. (If you know what I mean.) Excellent recipe, this will be my pumpkin cookie recipe from now on!!!

These cookies are great! I love pumpkin, and this hit the spot. I used 1 1/2 cups of regular flour, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour to make it a little heartier. Turned out great! :)

Loved these! I used only 2 T. of butter and then 3 T. of a product called Sunsweet "Lighter Bake", a butter and oil replacement which contains applesauce, prunes, etc.  Baby food prunes would probably work too.

The cookies had an excellent flavor.  I used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.  I also added cinnamon to the icing (as was recommended by other members), which was a great addition.  However, keep them in an airtight container if you live in a humid area, because they got too soft very quickly.

Delicious cake-like cookies (cakies?) with the flavor of pumpkin pie. Perfect! Somewhat sticky the next day, though, and next time I'll make them bite-size. Thanks for this great alternative to pumpkin pie!

Amazing! I decided to try this recipe to give out to my family and friends for christmas, and I'm so glad I did! I followed the recipe exactly except for the cloves, which I just didnt have. After the first batch came out a little spikey, I sprayed some pam on my hands and rolled them into balls, then flattened with a glass and they came out picture perfect.  They are delicious plain, or if you want it a bit sweeter the icing is good as well. Even a cream cheese frosting would compliment thses nicely.  Regardless, you have to try these!

Wow! My 3-year old love these, but no one else did. They came out perfectly as described "cakey", but not a lot of taste considering all the spices. Was truly disappointed since picked as an Allrecipe staff favorite and all the rave reviews.

Awesome cookies!  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a BIG hit!  They are so yummy - very cakey and moist - the icing really is the "icing on the cake" - highly recommended!

Very cakey cookie, yummy flavor.  The icing needed quite a bit more milk than the recipe called for to make it drizzle, but not a problem.  I sent a batch to my husband's workplace and they got rave reviews.  Engineers like...

These turned out to be a cross between a muffin and a cookie which wasn't really what I was looking for. That didn't stop any of my grad student friends from eating them though!

Well the taste is good, but I don't care for the texture at all. They are too soft and squishy and rubbery without any crunch or texture.  I made these last night and like them even less this morning. I cannot serve these to anyone, so I am going to dump the batch.

These are light, fluffy cookies that are more like little spiced cakes. The texture, flavor, and moistness of the finished product were perfect! 

I didn't have ground cloves, so I threw in some allspice and ground cardamom instead. I also added more of the spices in general because you can never have too much cinnamon. And I always double the amount of vanilla in any recipe. 

As for the glaze, it also worked out perfectly! I was apprehensive because my glazes usually don't dry, leaving sticky, unstackable cookies. I was also making it with water because I didn't have milk. To my delight, this glaze dried almost immediately to the ideal hardness. I think I will be using it with other recipes whenever a basic sugar glaze is needed.

I give this recipe 3.5 stars if you make it as is. did one batch as is, then tried something new. I added allspice(1T), 2T of orange juice(freshly squeezed from an orange) and 2t grated orange zest(from inside of peel, and some crushed pecans to the icing. I added allspice(1/2t)and 1C orange flavored craisins to the batter. I simmered the icing over low heat stirring constantly to make the icing more like a glaze. OH MY STARS!!!! TRY THIS!  The glaze seeps in a tiny bit to the cookie and it makes it like a mini cake. the craisins add a ton of moisture and added flavor and it is a party in the mouth. TRUST ME on this. Happy baking! Store in airtight container. they can dry out in a hurry.

Great recipe!  Made these for my roommates and they loved them.  Even my roommate who doesn't like pumpkin liked them!  I would recommend this recipe because of the cakey and moistness of the cookies.  They puff up nicely in the oven and look great with drizzled icing on the top!  I added more spices than called for to give the cookies more flavor, so good!

I have never even heard of a pumpkin cookie before but I was in the holiday spirit and wanted something different so I enlisted the help of my 2 year old to make these. They turned out awesome, with and without the icing. We put Halloween themed sprinkles on some. They all turned turned out beautiful and delicious, thank you so much for the best cookie recipe ever! Will definately make these again and again.

These cookies were delicious.  I dipped the cookie into the frosting instead of drizzling.  I found this to be much easier.  I made these and brought them to work.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  They were all gone by the end of the day.  Great recipe.  I'll add it to my collection.

Very good cookies.  I didn't have any white sugar on hand, so used 2 cups brown sugar and they turned out delicious.  I only made a little icing and added a smidge of cream cheese for better flavor, but they are just as good without any icing.

Delish! I wish I had an ice cream scoop because the dough was a bit sticky to handle. I used two teaspoons instead and got 4 dozen smaller cookies. I found the cookies to be a bit on the sweet side-yes, I know, they're cookies!-so I did not use icing. Very easy to make and they're a huge hit with my friends. Thanks all who wrote about the soft cakey texture--that was very useful (and true) information. I will definitely make these again and will try adding chopped cranberries for a tart bite.

Thanks Gina!

not a bad cookie but my family isn't big on thick cookies and these came out thick and soft, almost cake like. I did add pumpkin spice to the icing and that seemed to give it a little more flavor.

cookies are very soft but I found should only be iced right before eating.  I froze some for the holidays and am going to try cream cheese icing on those, otherwise tastes like mini pumpkin pies.

Fantastic!  These had an excellent pumpkin-spice taste, and they turned out soft and cake-y, not at all dense or wet or gummy like some other pumpkin cookies I've tried.  This is the recipe I've been looking for.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I even got people who dont like pumpkin, or never had pumpkin, to eat them.  Now they all want the recipe too. The only thing I will change next time is to make only half of the glaze. You definitely dont need a lot on these yummy cookie cakes.

These were good, but didn't really knock my socks off.  I think Pumpkin Cookies 1 were a bit better, and they didn't have icing on them (and didn't need it.)  
They were very easy to make tho - thanks for sharing, Gina.

These delicious cookies have spicy pumpkin flavor and a nice texture that is chewy and cake-y at the same time.  I just dipped the tops of the cooled cookies into the frosting.  I wish I had doubled the recipe.  I will next time!  Thanks, Gina

Great recipe! I also added chocolate chips, since I can't imagine Pumpkin cookies without them! Another really good icing idea-melt some almond bark and drizzle that on the top instead of the icing. It is soo good, and I always get tons of requests for them!

I LOVEEEEEEEEEE these cookies!!! They are soooo easy to make, and you just pop em in the oven and they're delicious! They're nice and soft (which is a must for me) and are very addictive. I also added a little more pumpkin then the recipe called for, and I substituted apple juice for the milk in the icing which gave it a nice flavor. Def. would reccomend these:)

These cookies turned out well. They are very soft and moist. I added pecans to one batch and chocolate chips to another, both ways were good.

Fantastic cookies!  I wasn't sure I was going to like these, as I'm not generally a fan of cakey cookies.  However, they taste delicious, like little muffins. The house smells wonderful while baking these.  Instead of using 1/2 cup butter, I used 1/4 cup margarine + 1/4 cup applesauce.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon additional cinnamon.  I eyeballed the nutmeg, as I had to grate mine.  Instead of using 1 1/2 cups white sugar, I used 1 cup regular sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also subbed egg replacer for the 1 egg.  Even with my adjustments, this turned out super.  P.S.--My boyfriend loves these, and he's pretty picky!

My husband and my three year old both love pumpkin pie - I hate it, but love pumpkin flavored other things - so I tried these cookies.  They are wonderful - spiced just right and very cakey.  I used apple cider instead of milk in the glaze to add just a little more taste of "fall" - we love these!

I just made these, and all I can say is YUMMY!!!  I've been looking for healthier cookies for school lunches.  I used all whole wheat flour, and substituted the butter with extra pumpkin to make them healthier.  They came out moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I really LOVED these cookies - soft and spicy!  I used a different icing - from the "Pumpkin Cookies V" recipe made with some brown sugar.  These turned out wonderful and my little girls loved them too!

This cookie was very cakey, and the taste reminded me of pumpkin pie. I covered the cookies in pecans and chopped cranberries before baking them, which made them even better! These were a bit too sweet for me (even without the icing), so I think I'll cut back on the sugar next time. I've been thinking about adding 1 cup applesauce instead of pumpkin puree and some ginger to make apple ginger cakes. I'll definately make this recipe, or some variation thereof, a lot in the future!

Soooooo good!!! They are beautiful cookies. I can be pressed for time so I use canned vanilla or crean cheese flavored frosting on these. If you are a fan of pumpkin than you really need to try this recipe. They reming me more of a little pumpkin cake than a cookie. I also make these all year round.

When I ate the first cookie fresh out of the oven, I was disappointed.  It seemed bland.  However, once I glazed them and let them sit overnight, the flavors really developed.  This cookie isn't too sweet and is quite tasty.  I will definitely use this again!

These cookies were really great.  I decreased the icing by half (enough sugar as is).  I dropped the cookies on a pan read directions to flatten cookies.  Sprayed hand with Pam flatten cookies.  Making them again today.  Thank you.

What yummy little cookies! These are not chewy-type cookies - they're cakey. I like them that way! I made them exactly as the recipe says and used the icing as well. They were sweeter with the icing but just as good without - you just taste the pumpkin more without. Great recipe - even my pumpkin-hating husband gobbled these up!

Very very good pumpkin spice cookies!  I don't use icing. I think they are delicious without it, but they are not very sweet, so if you love a sweet cookie I would suggest definitely using the icing.  Also, this is more of a cake-like cookie.  It is sort of bready.  I love them, but if you are a true 'chewy cookie fan' then these are not for you.  Me and my husband love them!!

Went over great with my 2 year old son's class. Even the teachers were asking for the recipe. Ended up quite moist. I wouldn't recommend stacking them if at all possible. Made it without any frosting or glaze and they were still great. Didn't plump up quite as much as I wished, but I really didn't mind once I had a mouthful.

These cookies have a nice texture, but not much flavor, even with the icing. I tried adding fresh chopped cranberries to the dough and that helped, but still pretty bland. I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar, and added cinnamon and ginger to the icing-- still blah. They're okay, but need something more.

i thought these were going to turn out harder but nope, they're really bready and actually they're great! mm i didn't try the icing but maybe i'll do that later on. I think they probably would taste better with the icing although they're very sweet already

They were a hit with family, co-workers and friends. You could even substitute the eggs for egg replacer and use rice milk without altering the taste. Could work as a vegetarian recipe.

** 12/12/09** I made these again this year to give away, this time I did something a little different, I had a Clementine sitting on the counter and started zesting it right into the batter, not knowing what it would taste like, OMG it added a spice to it that made it even better!! Im sure an orange would be fine I just happen to have the clementine on hand! This is an awesome cookie to begin with but the orange zest just added the kick I was looking for!!**

This is the best and easiest cookie to make, everyone likes them, HOWEVER they are VERY BAD for my hips, the only thing I changed on this recipe is the glaze, instead of making the glaze I just sprinkeled powder sugar on top once they were compelely cool.
thank you for sharing this recipe.

Not bad!  I omitted the icing for the sake of time, and for stacking purposes, since I always make double batches and send them to our jobs.  The flavor was slightly gingerbread-ish.  I did sprinkle light cinnamon-sugar over the tops before baking, and added my kitchen sink... the bottom of a box of raisins, the same with a bag of pulverized walnuts, and 1 cup (dbl batch) of mini-chocolate chips.  My friend appropriately re-named them "Pumpkin Muffies" and you get more of what you expect when you bite in with this name.  Won't be a regular for me, but probably will make once each season!  Thanks for the submission!

This recipe received unanimous "yum" votes in our house. (When I try a new recipe, we all vote "yum" or "yuck".  Recipes which receive unanimous "yuck" votes get ceremonially burned.) I wasn't sure how the kids would like the pumpkin, so for the first batch I substituted half mashed bananas for half the pumpkin and cut down on the sugar a little.  They were even a hit second time around when I just used pumpkin!  Nice consistency and flavor, and good even without the icing. Thanks, Gina.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Other reviewers mentioned that it is a cake-like cookie... I found them to be just like pumpkin bread but in cookie form. It would be much easier to bake a pumpkin loaf and drizzle it with icing than to go to all the trouble of making these cookies for the same results. The flavor isn't bad, but the texture is just not what I'm looking for in a cookie.

These were ok if you like cookies that taste like muffin tops. I left off the icing as a special request to make them lower in calories but I think they definitely needed it. Otherwise there's nothing very special about them. If I make them again I will use the icing and add chocolate chips and nuts.

This was such a wonderful, spiced cookie.  I added raisins to half the batch and everyone ate those up QUICK.  In my opinion, there's no need for the icing.  A keeper for sure.

Just found this new web site a couple weeks ago and love it!  Made these for my son's birthday party this past weekend and had to print off some copies of the recipe for some guests to take home, needless to say there weren't any left after the party.  Used the extra pumpkin to make pumkin pancakes the next morning, also on this web site, with maple sauce and they were also excellent!  Thank you!

I tried a diabetic version for friends, and it was too doughy, but then I made the other recipe, modified of course (with fresh pumpkin pureed together with orange juice and no cloves) and they were awesome!  THey just spread out a bit, looked great- crispy with chewy centers etc.  Bery good, brought them to work and they disappeared quickly.

I tried this recipe and shared the cookies with family & co-workers.  Even a week later I was asked for the recipe and one person who does not like 'pumpkin' said that these were delicious and perhaps has changed her mind about pumpkin.

I needed a cookie. Had pumpkin, found this recipe. I added about .5 to .75 cup of extra pumpkin to it and used 1 c sugar and .5 cup brown sugar. Put a bit more nutmeg in it. They are good, but not very sweet. I didn't ice them, I guess I will now. It's a good cookie when you 'need a cookie'.

This was fast, easy and they turned out delicious.  The only thing I did change after removing the first batch, was give the baking sheet a very light coat of non stick spray.  Maybe it was that particular cookie sheet, but they stuck a little.  

I will be making these often.  Everyone loves them, even the grandchildren.

Thanks Gina!

These cookies are terrific!  I'm a novice baker, but I found the recipe pretty easy and the cookies came out great.  Here's the one difficulty I had: the batter was sort of sticky, which made it difficult to put flat pieces on the cookie sheets, but I managed.  The cookies got rave reviews from everyone at my work place (and my boyfriend's, too!).  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks, Gina! :)

I just wanted to add - I tried these again, using lemon extract instead of vanilla extract in the glaze, and they were sooo good!  :)

Made this last night and it turned out better than I hoped! Very light and fluffy, the glaze was a great added touch. I added cinnamon to my glaze (as suggested in another review) they were GOBBLED UP! I just may make another batch before Halloween (use up the rest of the canned pumpkin). I used a tad more than tablespoon fulls and baked 17-18 minutes.

After reading all the reviews, I was a little surprised at how they turned out.  They were just OK in my book, although some of the people I served them to loved them.  I guess I just like a crispier cookie and I felt that these were too soft, but they do have a nice pumpkin flavor.  I also recommend glazing them for added sweetness.  I didn't think they were sweet enough without the glaze.

Very delicious pumpkin cookies!  Don't let the seemingly long list of ingredients scare you because these cookies are very easy to make.  You can also have lots of fun with the glaze by doing different designs.  I've frozen this dough in plastic freezer containers, and the cookies still turn out beautifully.

FABULOUS!! I was looking for a cake-like pumpkin cookie recipe like the one my mom used to make and this one turned out even better (I think!). My mom's used a cinnamon frosting, which I think is much tastier than the white icing included with this recipe, though (just make a white butter frosting with powdered sugar and vanilla and add some ground cinnamom -- yum!). You must try this recipe -- it's terrific. The cookies also freeze very well.

Wow! That's just what i'm thinking of right now. I'm eating one of these cookies right now and just savoring the flavor! I love the slight pumpkin "essence" and the warm spicy goodness. I used the icing in the recipe and it's wonderful. I bet that these cookies are going to be gone very quickly!

Wonderful cookie. My recipe turned out a bit soft, although I doubled the recipe. Once baked
I iced them with a King Arthur "Glazing Sugar" instead of the ingredients listed for the glaze.
The Glazing Sugar made it a hard glaze. The cookies themselves were an easy recipe to make with
ingredients usually found in a bakers kitchen. The cookies were a big hit with my family and my daughters
class as well as we made them for her Thanksgiving feast. The end result cookie is a soft cookie. If you are
going to contain them, they will remain soft.

I used the seasoned canned pumpkin then added 1/2 of the additional spices recommended in the recipe. I followed the rest of the directions and they are delicious! My husband and next door neighbor LOVED THEM and so do I.  They are crisp on the edges and soft inside, melt in your mouth Yum. For some of the batter I added white chocolate chips which gave additional sweetness and texture. Delicious with or without. 
As for the glaze, WOW!  The flavor as well as the fact it hardens just enough to not be messy on our fingers  was perfection. Thank you for sharing. (I'm getting ready to make another  batch right now)

I also substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown, and they were delicious . I got lazy and just sprinkled confectionary sugar over them and they were still the best cookie I’ve ever baked.

Great idea. Needs some adjustments. Expected it to come out tasting like pumpkin pie but instead it tasted like a gingerbread man and there's no ginger. I followed the recipe to the letter.  

My wife suggested I run the last batch with some added clover, nutmeg and pumpkin puree. That last batch tasted like Pumpkin Pie. I plan on making again and this time with extra puree and a touch more nutmeg and clover. Mostly extra puree.  Overall a solid cookie recipe with a novel flavor palette.

Delicious but very soft, more like a muffin top rather than cookie. In place of 1 1/2 cups white sugar,  I did 3/4 cup brown sugar and a little less than 3/4 cup monk fruit sweetner.  I used a whole can of pumpkin puree instead of just 1 cup.  In place of all the spices, I used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice. It was a hit.

I loved this recipe but found it to have too much pumpkin. I put I pinch more of sugar and a couple shakes of cinnamon. I also added some mini chocolate chips and walnuts. They really look and taste delicious all in all. 10/10 would bake again

I made two little changes. 1. I combined everything in a food processor instead of mixing in a bowl and the cookies come out more like 'Cake Cookies'. A little fluffier and bigger.
2. I also tried adding chocolate chips at at the end of mixing, and it just added a little sweetness to them. But that is personal preference, not really an enhancement of any kind. 
Great recipe as is and great cookies!

I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies are delicious! They are very easy to make and definitely holiday party worthy. To drizzle the icing I put it in a zip lock baggie and snipped the edge. I will definitely make these again but I'm going to try adding a touch of ginger :) Thanks for submitting this recipe!

UPDATE: These are actually better without the ginger. And I use almost an entire can of pumpkin which is about twice what the recipe calls for :)

Absolutely delicious!  Added 3 tsp of  Pumpkin Pie Spice along with listed spices.  Substituted 1/2 C  Dark Brown Sugar, along with 1 C White Sugar.  I made a Cream Cheese w/Pumpkin Spice frosting.  Perfect for Fall.  They turned out divinely delicious!

I used fresh pumpkin, and I put more in than the recipe called for, about 1 1/4 cups. They did spread a little bit. I wonder how putting the dough in the fridge for a bit would help them maintain their shape. Right out of the oven, deliciously airy, but I was hoping for a little denser of a cookie. Truthfully, I'm looking for a recipe like my grandma used to bake, smaller, denser but still light, and with a cream cheese frosting. These are good, though.

I made this for a fall party and followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t have clove so I put in a little extra of the other spices. It was a huge hit! I got rave reviews. I started by drizzling the frosting but the switched to putting a spoonful on the cookies when warm. It melted over the top and down the sides beautifully. I cooled them on parchment paper and when they cooled I threw away the mess.

I just made a double batch of these. I docked one star for the ridiculous "number of servings listed." You'd have frustrating, nickel-sized cookielets if you tried to get 36 out of these. A DOUBLE batch made 24. So, that's 1 dozen *respectable* cookies per batch.

The only ingredient change I made was to use just 1 can of pumpkin for the 2 batches, since I wasn't about to open a whole other can to get the last 1/4 cup it called for. Each can has ~1 3/4 cups. I don't notice any troubles from that.

I also didn't bother with the glaze. I prefer all of my cookies unglazed. They're sweet enough as it is.

Loved it! Added cranberries and walnuts to half of the batch. I always 50/50 sugar with brown sugar as well. I'm sure it would have been fine with just white sugar...it's just a personal preference. Turned out fantastic.

The cookies were just right consistency, taste great, the only change I made was to cut cloves to 1/2 recommended measurement, due to I do not like the strong flavor.  I will be making again

I made these as written for a coworker's birthday. My friend who loves all things pumpkin absolutely loved them, but even my friend who doesn't usually care for pumpkin couldn't stop eating them! And they were pretty fast and easy too! Win, win!

Very good. I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used 1 TBL pumpkin pie spice instead of the 3 separate spices. I iced with penuche frosting. Yum

This are the best pumpkin cookies. I’ve made them a few times and they are always delicious. Tip: don’t over cook them. I substituted the butter for coconut oil this time and they are even better imo. I like them plain or iced. Everyone who tastes these asks for the recipe. Enjoy!

I read a comment that had said they used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar; this is the only change I followed. I left all other spices and measurements alone. These cookies have probably gotten the best response out of anything I have made on this site (and I made a lot). I made a login just to say if done right this recipe is a crowd pleaser. You definitely want a big cooling rack and a couple of baking pans for this one because this recipe yields a lot of cookies.

Everyone loves these cookies.  The texture is almost like a muffin top.  Since the small can of pumpkin is 15 oz, I always double the recipe.  I add a couple of tablespoons of Apple sauce to make 2cups.

i swapped in vegan butter and almond milk since i'm allergic to milk, as well as added melted chocolate chips to the icing. i love it, they came out soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.

Pretty delicious cookies, I can't complain. I decided to use pie pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin, but I didn't really taste the pumpkin unfortunately. Still, I really love the cake-like texture and all of the fall spices used. I would definitely bake these again.

I made this recipe gluten free, and they were perfect!!! I substituted the flour with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour, as well as the baking powder with Bob' s Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Powder. I also dusted the cookies with brown sugar and cinnamon immediately after removing them from the oven. The texture of the cookies were light and cakey!! My guests could not tell they were gluten free!

This cookie was fabulous . Melted in mouth,  bursts with flavor . I did take one persons advise and used 1/3 of sugar as brown sugar . Also I did add nuts in one sheet of cookies . Put 1/2 block of cream cheese in to make more of an icing verses glaze . But am gonna make again. . Gave to friends and everyone loved ! Definitely worth making !

Have made this recipe several times and they always comes out great. It is one of the best pumpkin cookie recipes that I have made. The additional spice amounts do make a difference. I have never actually used any frosting to top these cookies, but always add chopped walnuts and the white vanilla chips to this recipe and they are always well loved.

Awesome! I’m not a huge “pumpkin everything” fan, but these had me coming back for more...and more, and more, and more! I love that they stay soft. The recipe yields a large amount, which is good because they’ll go very fast. I stuck to the recipe exactly minus one aesthetic tweek: I added 2 drops yellow and one drop red food coloring to the glaze, which came out a nice pale orange that screams “autumn”. Totally worth it!

I made these for a friend's party and they were a huge hit! None came home with me that night. I added some chocolate chips to the dough as well as 1/2 teaspoon of allspice and that just made the even better! I would 100% recommend these for any occasion.

Put less white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Used 1 tsp pumpkin spice instead of nutmeg and cloves. Bakes 12 mins. No icing

Perfect pumpkin cookie recipe! But be sure to do cream cheese frosting. I used the spices called for plus 1/2 tsp ginger and extra cinnamon. The dough was even delicious!

Best cookies I've ever made! I did sub in half brown sugar like many people recommended, and I thought it was just right. 
 
These taste amazing with cream cheese icing, but that makes it hard to stack without ruining the presentation.  I'll probably try the icing in the recipe next time.  Oh yes, there will be a next time.

I wasn’t happy with these cookies. They were not nearly sweet enough for my family, the sugar hounds would not eat them.  I will seek another recipe.

I've made these several times. I tend to spoon things out too large so I have to watch that. They don't keep well because the icing makes them soggy in airtight containers. I make these for family gatherings the morning of. They are delicious though. More like a homemade Debbie Cake.

Nice moist cookie.  I didn’t use the icing.  Great without it.  I substituted a brown sugar/stevia blend instead of white sugar; that was the only change.  Everyone loved them.  I live at a high altitude and didn’t make any change except as noted above,  thanks for the recipe.

The only thing I do different is to chill the dough for at least 30 min. for easier forming and no cracks. Also I coat my hands with flour when shaping the dough and add more nutmeg and cloves.

I made this recipe but made it my own. I didn’t add any spices other than the cinnamon. I kept everything else the same, but also added 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder  (unsweetened) and 1/2 cup of pecans. My cookies came out cake-like. These were alright, but I think they could stand to be less cake-like and a little sweeter. I think next time instead of cocoa powder I’ll just do 1/2 cup of chocolate chips as well. :)

I was a little skeptical, but the cookies turned out great! They are super yummy and easy recipe to follow.  The frosting drizzle made them even better, although, they are delicious either way. You can eat them with or without the icing, but if you have a sweet tooth like me, you gotta try them with the icing.

These cookies are delicious and so easy to make! I would recommend watching the video tutorial on this recipe cause it adds some extra hints that are not in the written out instructions. These cookies are so fluffy and moist. I made a batch without frosting, a batch with cream cheese frosting,  and a batch with chocolate chips...all so yummy! I look forward to serving them at Thanksgiving.

These cookies are very good! Next time I would add a little more pumpkin and some more sugar. They had almost a cheerio taste to them but other than that they are great and have a wonderful cake texture to them not super hard or doughy!

Never did a cooking review before, but I had to do it for these cookies.  My husband loves pumpkin cookies, but I'm not a big fan.  That being said, these are the best pumpkin cookies I've ever had.  I made them exactly as stated except I doubled the recipe and added a little extra vanilla, just because I love vanilla.  I made these really late at night, so I didn't even make the drizzle, but I bet they'd be incredible either way.

These are very tasty! I had 2 cups of pumpkin I need to use up, and it was almost midnight when I decided to make these cookies, so I had to make do with the ingredients I had. I used whole wheat flour, and since I was out of butter AND applesauce, (which I would usually use as a substitute), I used fat free vanilla greek yogurt. They came out more cake-like or pumpkin bread-like than typical cookies, due to the lack of fat in the ingredients, but they were really good. I put a healthy shake of cinnamon in the  glaze, too. I only needed to cook these for about 12 minutes, probably because I altered the recipe.

Moist and chewy, turned out great!  I would make again.  Modified to gluten free with 1 cup almond flour and 1 1/2 cups gluten free oatmeal.  Also use 1/4 cup less sugar and 1/4 cup more pumpkin.

These are a family favorite at my house I make them year round. I always double the batch (which makes A LOT of cookies) and I use the large can of pumpkin and use the whole thing. This makes them extra moist so be careful when storing if you do this. My family also likes them with chocolate chips so I add a bag of mini chocolate chips. YUMMMMMM!

Love these moist cake like cookies! I modified and used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and used the whole 15oz can of pumpkin to not waste anything. 

For the icing I found this ratio to work perfectly and if you wait until the icing sets you can stack the cookies on top.
3 Tbsp melted unsalted butter
3 Tbsp milk
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups powdered sugar

This was quick and easy to make.  I used a cookie scoop for smooth, evenly sized cookies and lined my cookie sheet with a Silpat.  Based on other reviews, I added a bit more spices by not leveling off the spices in the measuring spoon.  The baked cookies were light in texture, with a wonderful lightly crisper bottom.  I frosted them with a brown sugar penuche frosting that was part of another pumpkin cookie recipe on this site.  The combo was so good!  My guests devoured them, and couldn't stop racing about how wonderful they were.  Not a crumb was left.  ??

Wonderful cake-like cookies. I’ve made this three times for different events. I followed the recipe almost exactly the first two times (except once I had to substitute 1/2 tsp lemon juice + 1/4 tsp baking soda as I had no baking powder). The third time, I added a cup of chocolate chips. I also added a tsp of orange zest to the icing. I use an old-fashioned trigger ice cream scoop for uniform size and shape and did not flatten before baking. Everyone loved these with and without the variations.

The cookie itself was very good but the icing  wasn't so great. I made two batches and ended up not icing the second half. The icing at my local grocery store bakery is much better. I'm gonna half to search for a better icing recipe.

These were good when I made them last night but today they are fantastic! I did some swapping but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I used 3 t. pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices, out of personal preference. I also substituted half of the AP flour with whole wheat—yes, there’s a slight difference in texture but it’s not overt in this cake-like cookie.  Like other reviewers (& because I often do this swap in my baking), I substituted some of the white sugar, so I ended up using 3/4 c. white, 1/4 c. raw/turbinado sugar (just for the heck of it), and 1/2 c. light brown sugar. I saw a lot of comments about the cookie not being very sweet and I agree it’s much more subtle in sweetness, allowing the spices to be front and center. But the icing is very, very sweet so, if you plan to use this icing rather than a cream cheese icing as others have mentioned, you could probably reduce some of the sugar in the cookie. Believe me, with the icing it’s plenty sweet and, given my love of sweets and baked goods, that’s a rare thing for me to say. Also, don’t plan on packaging these up right away—even left on the counter barely covered since last night, the icing is still too soft to stack these cookies. They’re in a single layer in the freezer now to prep for storage & transport.

These cookies are absolutely amazing!! I recommend refrigerating the dough for 1-2 hours before baking it. It'll take another 2 minutes for the cookies to completely cook, but it is definitely worth it! The perfect recipe for the holidays!!

Made with ingredients as stated.  Excellent!  Baked 8 min on lower rack, then 5 on top rack.  Did have to add extra tablespoon on milk, not sure if that is related to using organic 2%.   And our home smells like Fall.

A bit dry,  I added a little applesauce for some more moisture and the cook time was 15 minutes on the dot!

To make it vegan,  I replaced the egg with 1/4 cup of  cinnamon applesauce and the butter with slightly less vegetable oil. Didn't turn out quite as fluffy, but still quite good.

I also cut the sugar to 2/3  cup and it still tasted delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic with or without icing.  Soft, fluffy cookie with mild flavor that made the whole house smell amazing while baking.  I am going to try some of the suggestions for the next batch; using 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar and adding the cinnamon to the icing.  I also have added maple syrup to my icing in the past and think that would be a welcome addition for this recipe.  Thank you for the deliciously perfect fall cookies!

I haven't made it yet but I will as soon as I can find an answer to a question I noticed in the ingredient list for the icing, the picture is so pretty the icing drizzles are orange which is so pretty but in the directions it does not say how to make the icing with color, I do not think butter would do that alone but what else is in the icing to make the orange color? I feel it should include all details.

I loved the way these turned out! At first when the batter was done I was a bit nervous as it was a bit liquid-y and nothing like I've ever made before. I really didn't want to waste it so I tried it out by taking a spoon of the batter and putting on the plate and putting in the microwave for a minute. I was super excited and it turned out great. So I then put them in the oven for about 16ish minutes. Took them out and made the glaze. I cut the glaze recipe in half as it seemed like a lot of glaze for about 25 cookies. I didn't use butter in the glaze and it turned about delish. I had everyone try them and they all loved them, even if its the middle of summer ! Thanks for the recipe- BlinkReagan

I didn't have the ingredients for the frosting, but they didn't need it! These were delicious and so easy!

Also omitted the nutmeg and clove because I didn't have those, and added extra cinnamon instead.

I made this recipe gluten free by using flax, almond, and brown rice flour instead of all-purpose (but otherwise followed the recipe).  I cut the sugar by half (because I planned to ice them), and I also thickened the icing so I could spread it on the top for a fancier cookie.  I brought them to work and served them at a happy hour (without telling people they were healthier/gf), and they got rave reviews.  One of my favorite gf conversions yet!

These pumpkin cookies came out amazing. Very cake-like consistency. I did add pumpkin pie spice & all spice to the mix. As for the icing, I added cinnamon & it's amazing with these cookies. Next time I make these, I'll do a cream cheese frosting.

Delicious cookies! They are soft and not too sweet. I rolled some in sugar as apposed to glazing them; which gave them a sweet crisp coating for a slightly different tasting cookie. But really both ways are delicious.

These cookies are terrific.  Easy to make and very soft and chewy.  The drizzle is a nice touch.  I did add 1/4 tsp Cinnamon to the drizzle otherwise everything was followed exactly.  Will definitely make these again.  Thank You

Everybody loved these! I made only a couple changes. I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the cookie batter, and baked at 350 for only 12-13 mins as I scooped them slightly smaller than a tablespoon full onto the sheets. I didn’t flatten them either. I added pumpkin pie spice to the icing and found they were best to leave out overnight to dry before packing up into Xmas cardboard cookie boxes for gifts. I also suggest parchment paper between each layer when packaging. They were a huge hit at the office and with my family!

This is a new favorite recipe! I did make the following changes though: 2 cups of whole wheat flour + 1/2 c  all purpose, 1c brown sugar + 1/2 c white sugar, whole can of pumpkin instead of 1 c, 3 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, no cloves (didn't have any), 1 tsp ginger. They came out great! I like the whole wheat flour because it gives them a nice texture and is a little healthier. And using more brown sugar, they are not super sweet which is nice because the icing is. Next time I will try adding a bit more ginger and adding cinnamon to the glaze like someone else had suggested.

REALLY nice and pillowly soft cookies.  I did half white sugar and half brown sugar and creamed the daylights out of the butter and sugar so they would turn out fluffy.  Next time I will add more spices as the flavor was pretty mild.  I had to cook these for 15 minutes.  My icing was took thick to drizzle so I nuked it for about 15 seconds and that did the trick.  Perfect icing too!

I did make a couple of changes, I accidentally put in a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger before I realized it wasn't my nutmeg.  Turned out fine though!  Also put 3/4 white sugar & 3/4 dark brown sugar.  I think I would have used a 1/4 cup less if I realized how sweet these turned out.  After making a batch, the next round I added about an 1/8 of crushed walnuts.  Thanks!

These are slightly fluffy and oh so delicious! I drizzled cream cheese frosting over top instead of the glaze. Really good!

I have made this a couple of times, love these cookies.  I add more spice than called for and use  less frosting but the cookies are moist and tasty.   Always a hit at Thanksgiving.

First time making this for Thanksgiving and it is a keeper. I made half of the batch according to directions and the other half I added a pecan to the top. Not much in the way of modifying but oh so good! The cookies came out like mini cakes. Light and springy texture. The icing pulled it all together. Will make again soon!

I have made these cookies half a dozen times over the last two months. Everyone loves them. They've been requested for Thanksgiving even. I follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of glaze application - instead of drizzling with a fork, I dip the top of the cookie into the glaze and use the back of a butter knife to remove the excess.  They take exactly 15 minutes in my oven and I always have 3 dozen cookies. 
One of these times, I want to try using orange extract and orange juice in the glaze instead of milk and vanilla extract. 
Excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I love these cookies. I make them every year and they go over really  well. They are soft more cake like than cookie. I don’t recommend storing them in an airtight container as they have a lot of moisture. They are just the right amount of sweetness in my opinion. They are not too sweet and the spices give them a great flavor. I sprinkle powdered sugar on mine instead of  using the icing. I’ve made them for work dinners and family gatherings and there are never any leftovers.

this turned out with a great flavor but I do think you need the icing to complete the overall cookie.  and other reviewers are correct, don't store these in an airtight container but rather loosely with foil.  they need some air to breath and are incredibly moist.  I did add the brown sugar that others suggested and it makes a real difference.  I would make this again for sure.

These are officially a family tradition now. I kicked up the spices a little and added cardamom. Most of the time I substitute baking Splenda for sugar, in the cookies, even though I still make the glaze with confectionar's sugar. Totally delicious. My friends always ask me to bring them to parties. They go great with coffee in the morning too.

I was looking for something to give out for Halloween (along with popcorn balls) and found this recipe. The only departure I made from the recipe was to dunk the cookies into orange and black sprinkles after I had iced them. I was immensely pleased with the look of the finished product and loved the taste and texture of the cookies. I will most definitely be making them again, perhaps for Christmas with red and green sprinkles. My only problem was that the drizzle/frosting/icing was a little too sweet for my taste (although family members disagree), I will use less on each individual cookie next time.

I always subtract at least a 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe calls for and use brown sugar instead to give it a more nutty flavor :)

They were good. The icing didn't stick for some reason. I was not sure what to do, so I served them without the icing and they were still good.

Cookies are cakey fabulous and will not disappoint. In addition, I made these with a gluten free all purpose flour and they turned out wonderful. Father in law had no clue they were GF and could not stay away. Only substitute I made was replacing sum of spices with equal amount of pumpkin spice. Just a preference of mine. Add this to your must make list!

I've made the multiple times following the recipe exactly they're absolutely great the icing to makes them more flavorful. I've also double the amount of spices that I put into the cookie and then the cookies are absolutely wonderful by themselves and even better with icing.

VERY GOOD! I took the reviewers advice used 1 cup of white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Used 1 1/2 teas. of Allspice, and 1 and 1/2  teas. of cinnamon. Also added cinnamon to the glaze. Cooked for 15 minutes. Will make again!

My favorite cookies! They're so easy to make and so moist. It literally tastes like and has the consistency of pumpkin bread and a cookie combined. They're a must for fall! The only thing I don't like is the icing. To me it tastes a lot better without it.

I am not a pumpkin lover but these cookies may have changed that! They were easy to make and storage wasn’t an issue because they didn’t last long enough. I tried them with the basic glaze which was great, but then I started to experiment. I had some Honey Pecan cream cheese spread and made icing out of that—wow! Then I tried the glaze with the maple flavor like another review suggested and that was also a winner. Finally, I added some fresh orange zest and juice to the glaze recipe—definitely my favorite!  These cookies will be in the rotation for a long time.

These were alright. Very cake like, which isn't a bad thing, but there weren't very sweet either. Would be good with tea or coffee.

My three year old son loved them.

The best thing was the way the house smelled while cooking these. I added chocolate chips to some of the batter and I preferred them with the chocolate. They stay very fresh on the counter for a couple of days. There won't be any left beyond that - trust me.

I iced only half the batch of cookies, planning to freeze that amount and later ice/serve them.  The un-iced ones disappeared quickly and never saw the freezer! Their subtle, not-too-sweet flavor is perfect with a cup of coffee or tea. The iced ones were also delicious. I'll bake them again (and ice only half again).

This is an excellent cake-like cookie. Stayed fresh sitting out on the countertop in a plastic storage container. Only change I made was to add a little cream cheese to the icing.  They were a super big hit with everyone who tried them. A definite keeper!

These cookies were a big hit in my house - w/o the icing.  My husband, in-laws, and son really liked them.  Only my daughter, who says she doesn't like pumpkin, didn't eat them.  I thought they were great, very cake like.

Delicious fall treat! Made a batch to bring to  a garage sale fundraiser but my family ate them all. Had to make another batch and hide them. Moist, flavorful cookies that are a perfect dessert for autumn.  I tried making them with the  posted sugar frosting recipe and  that was just OK. Second time I made them I used cream cheese frosting, which was avfabulous taste and looked like professional cookies.. Yummy.

I used half the amount of sugar (white/brown and powdered sugar).  Served them with the icing in a separate bowl with pecans/chocolate chips as optional "hats".  Everyone liked the customized option, especially the parents who watchdog the amount of sugar that goes into the kiddos!

I liked this recipe better than the other recipe on this website (Pumpkin Cookies with Cream Cheese Frosting).  The cookie itself had a better flavor.  I did glaze with a cream cheese glaze using the recipe ingredients listed and a bit of leftover cream cheese frosting I had on hand.  Very good cookies!

I made these for a work pot luck and they were a hit! I didn't get to bring any home. The only thing I changed was to add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to the icing. That really made it pop and brought everything together. This recipe is going on my holiday cookie list for sure!

I make these every year with roasted sugar pumpkin and toasted walnuts with golden raisins.  Then....I add 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the glaze.  This recipe is so good that you don't even need to do all that for them to come out delicious..  It really is perfect!  Cakey texture, glaze hardens perfectly.  Leave them out overnight then package them up to mail, freeze or eat if they can make it that far.  Makes 3 dozen yummy cookies.

These were easy to make, and were a moist, heavier  cookie...maybe should be called "CAKE-ies" instead of cookies! Would recommend, esp. if you needed something to take to a dinner or kid's classroom.

Instead of making the glaze as listed on the recipe, I made a slightly different one using brown sugar...it creates a caramel taste to it that blends well with the pumpkin...Penuche Frosting calls for 1/2 c. butter...1 c. dark brown sugar, 1/2 c. half and half or you can use milk as I did, a pinch of salt, 1 tsp. vanilla. You just heat the butter and add your brown sugar until its a rolling boil. Lower the heat and add the salt and powered sugar. You just have to be careful not to thicken it, but if you do, add a little hot water to thin the glaze out. It was positively "da bomb".

I made this recipe but exchanged a 15 oz can of pumpkin for 15 oz of Pureed Sweet Potatoes.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly as stated.

Absolutely awesome cookies;  loved by everyone!!!!
This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

I also made another batch and froze it in a log about a month ahead of time;  when ready to cook, I took it out and quickly sliced the cookies;  they came out perfect!

Everyone loved these cookies. Not too sweet and not overly pumpkin flavored. I used advice from a couple other reviewers. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also rolled the balls in sugar before baking.  For the frosting I added 1 tablespoon cream cheese and  some cinnamon. I frosted the cookies rather than drizzling them with glaze. I would say they turned out perfect.

I did not really care for these.  They are like mini little cakes or muffin tops.  Even everyone who tried them said the same, not really a cookie, in my eyes anyways.  It definately did not have enough spice flavour for me.   So for me they were just ok.

These were super yummy! I let them sit in the fridge overnight and they tasted even better the next day when they were cold and firmer on the outside but still soft and chewy in the middle.

This was a really easy recipe to follow. I did make some adjustments to suit my family's likes: soymilk for regular, applesauce for butter, flax "egg" for real egg. The cookies cameout moist and were really delicious. Thank you!

So darn good! Made it as listed for the cookie. The cookies are good by themselves without the icing.  I did add the icing, and it was nice too. But I cut the powdered  sugar in half, and there was still a ton of icing left over.

So I am a huge fan of pumpkin desserts and have been trying different things. My rating is based only on the cookie and having replaced the seasoning with pumpkin spice. I opted for a cream cheese icing. The cookies were like little pillows of cake.  They have a hint of pumpkin flavor and are absolutely wonderful to eat. It’s easy to get carried away eating them because of how light and fluffy they are. Amazing cookie recipe!!!!

Delicious and moist just the way they are.
I made  few changes the second time around just to try it out.
I substituted the white sugar for a half  cup of brown sugar and half a cup of maple syrup.
I used about 1 cup and a half of pumpkin instead and used more cinnamon and nutmeg.

Thanks for this recipe!!!

I have been using this site for years and FINALLY tried this recipe tonight (which happens to be the first day of Fall). I think my expectations were too high, as this recipe has been made by so many users and rated so highly. It's very good - just not as great as I was expecting. I see some other users have made "variations" by adding nuts or white chocolate chips, and switching to a cream cheese icing or maple glaze. I think those variations would be delish!! This is a "basic cookie" that could be very versatile. Without any icing the cookie itself would be too boring to eat. I made a double batch and followed the recipe (almost) exactly. Only change was to use 1/2-cup of brown sugar in place of some of the white. I also only added a dash of salt, but may add more next time for flavour. I also probably added about an extra 1/4-cup of pumpkin. The dough is very sticky and hard to "shape". I found using my fingers worked the best to slightly flatten/shape/smooth. The cookies do not flatten as they bake, they puff up. I baked in convection at 325 on light metal sheets for 13-minutes (perfect). For the icing: I added 1/2-tsp of cinnamon and ended up using 5-tbsp of milk to get the right consistency. I only made a single batch of the icing and it was plenty for the double batch with some to spare. Next time I will definitley try a cream cheese frosting. **Update** these were very tasty (as is) the next morning after cooling! I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't store

Bomb.com  I was asked when I was gonna make more.  I did find it a little hard to shape the cookies, it's a pretty stiff dough.  Maybe I over mixed the dough.. I'll try to mix by hand next batch I make. Highly recommend these. I used extra chucky on.

I really enjoyed this recipe! The perfect cookie to welcome fall. I added a bit more sugar and cinnamon to sweeten them a little bit and I increased the cook time a little bit because I increased the cookie size a little bit but overall I loved these cookies! Very soft and cakey and delicious!

These cookies are time consuming, but absolutely with it! They are hands down the best I have ever baked. Go with 18 minutes if you have an electric oven.

Yummy and cake like cookies!  I did 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, added 1 cup chocolate chips and both me and my toddler are loving this fall flavored treat!

Honestly dont get the hype with pumpkin flavored stuff, but it's fall so...ok, I'll do it. Even I couldn't find anything wrong with this recipe. I live close to 6000 ft, so my modifications were normal: about 1/8 of a tsp less of baking powder and soda, a  couple T more flour, bake at 375 (rotating) for 14/15 min.

Very good even without the glaze!  Could use nuts, maybe walnuts or pecans.  Mine aren't quite as pretty admittedly, but they taste good and hey, that's what counts right?

Love these cookies! They are a big hit every time.  I don't make the icing since its messy and unnecessary.  I make exactly as the recipe says and they are cake like and delicious.  Not too sweet.  Sometimes i add mini chocolate chips as well.

These are perfectly delicious. Despite reading several reviews saying they weren't sweet enough I still decided to cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. That was only because I was hoping to avoid the sticky cake-like consistency.  That was the only change and these are perfect!   They are soft but have a slight crunch to the outside. The glaze adds just a nice additional sweetness to the cookie.  I could also imagine mixing in a handful of small chocolate chips instead of the glaze.  Nothing Else to add except these are a keeper.

My variation was using a homemade Gluten-Free flour.  Replaced butter with unrefined Organic Coconut Oil instead of butter and used Organic Coconut Sugar instead of refined white sugar. They taste Wonderful too!

I've made these 3 times now, each time without the icing and they are great plain.  This last time I added Nestle  Pumpkin Spice Chips to the batter and they were even better!  They are a nice soft moist cookie.  Everyone really enjoys them, even those "I don't eat sweets/dessert" people.

I have made this quite a few times now.  They are so well liked that my neighbours request them for gatherings.  That being said, I'm not the kind of person who likes pumpkin anything, but even I really enjoy these.  Not being a fan of cloves, I leave out that one ingredient and they still turn out amazing.  I've not made the icing, so I cannot comment on that, but we like them even without icing.

I liked the cookies but found them to have a slightly dry cake like texture.  I didn't have nutmeg or cloves so I used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice along with the ground cinnamon.  Next time I might use two eggs.

Not bad. I decided to make these without the glaze, instead I chose to fold in some chopped dates (this made up for what would have been the sweetness of the glaze). I love how moist and golden they are, they bake quite well. My only complaint is that the spices are a little underwhelming in this recipe, in the future I might double them up (not necessarily the cinnamon but other spices and maybe add some ginger too).

I tried this and I just made a few tweaks. so first of all the icing that you recommended would probably be a little too sweet. 
 so I really think you should try this: I used cream cheese frosting, the ingredients are: powdered sugar, a 5 ounce package of cream cheese, and water. mix that altogether for about two min. and tada! you have your cream cheese frosting. instead of drizzling the frosting on I used a spoon to dolip the frosting on it. and it was really good that way too. so anyway, I loved these cookies and I'm definitely going to make them again!

My family liked these. I used my smallest cookie scoop and baked them for closer to ten minutes. I used less than half of the nutmeg and cloves because I wasn't sure how my son would like them and they were plenty spicy.

I make these every year for the holidays, and people love them.  I usually cut down some sugar, but overall these are a big hit.  I sometimes get lazy and make bars instead of cookies, which are delicious too.  People say they almost taste like gingerbread.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! They were more of a cake consistency, but I prefer my cookies soft, so they were very yummy! They are slightly bland, so maybe add more pumpkin and glaze. The glaze was a little sweet and I would suggest putting in more milk than the recipe calls for, but otherwise these cookies are awesome! If you like soft cookies and pumpkin, these are for you!  If you make them smaller, you can eat two without feeling guilty. Eat them warm with a glass of milk!

Made these today to take to a 12 person potluck. Only a few left over that the grandsons devoured and asked me to make more soon. Nice soft, moist cookie that is not overly sweet.  Did switch out part of the white sugar with brown since I ran out of white.

I used real pumpkin (I had roasted one for another recipe and had left overs) and they turned out wonderfully. I halved the icing since I just drizzled it over the cookies and I had plenty left over. These remind me of little pumpkin scones

Edited review.........  the ONLY change I made was to use 3/4 C of White sugar & 3/4 C of br sugar.  I don't care much for glaze, so I added a bit of molasses to it & what a fabulous addition it made. Everyone goes crazy for them and they have been added to my cookie collection for the last several yrs.  great recipe!!

Only mistake I made was putting the icing on when they cooled and using too much of it, a little tiny bit to melt over the top is perfect if any is used at all

Wonderful recipe for a cakey cookie. It is not very sweet, so the frosting is a must. Alternatively, you could up the sugar. But this is just nitpicking. Family and friends all raved about these

I love these cookies and I HATE pumpkin. My sister makes them for her husband as well, and she has to hide them from me when I visit because I eat them all. One thing; I can't stand when people say "I made this recipe as written, but I added or omitted" and then they complain when it doesn't come out as expected. Submit your own recipe!!!

Made this today. Substituted half stevia for half the sugar. Can't tell the difference. I liked them just as well without the icing, so if you want to save a few calories and some sugar, eat them without icing. Very good! We really like them

I thought these turned out great! I did do part brown sugar for the white to make it a little denser. When I halved the recipe I still used a whole egg and just 3 tablespoons of butter. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the glaze. Be sure you shape your cookies before popping them into the oven because they don't smooth or spread out much on their own. I also recommend baking for the entire 20 minutes since these are already pretty moist cookies

I used this recipe but instead of making cookies I used it to make muffins. If you add about another 1/4th cup of milk you can use the recipe to make pumpkin muffins. I made no changes to the filling besides not using egg whites.

IF you make muffins cook them for 30 minutes at 330 degrees. the filling can be put on after they are cooled. Like frosting!

I also used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I found them very tasty, but agree with the other reviewer that they need the icing! I will definitely make them again! It's a great way to use up your Halloween pumpkin!

Next time, I'll add more cloves and nutmeg to get more of the spices to come through. Baking for 15 minutes leaves the cookies quite soft, so depending on your preference, you could bake for a bit longer.

Simple and delicious! Soft and tasty - even the fussy ones enjoyed them!  Looking for something other than typical pumpkin pie to serve - these cookies were perfect.  I will be making again and trying them as a cookie log shape.

I made these with gluten free flour, cup for cup, and they were fantastic! They remind me of cookies my grandmother used to make. The only thing I will change next time is to add pecans and raisins.

This is one of my most requested recipes.  The flavor isn't overpowering.  

I do not add cloves or the icing.  I sprinkle confectionary  sugar
on them just prior to serving.  Always a hit!  For Thanksgiving  this year, I made two batches so they could go home with our guests as part of the leftovers.

A couple of things to note. The cookie is very cake like. Some people like, it others don't, so just note it. 

The cookie is very good but the simple glaze for this cookie just doesn't do enough. Instead of just doing a sugar glaze, I substituted out the milk and butter for orange juice and grand marnier. The orange flavor of the glaze gives its a nice, sharp contrast to the sweet, spicy cookie.

I would recommend having cookie cutters or something to keep the dough/pumpkin goo in some sort of shape for baking. I didn't really mind, so i just scooped the dough onto the pan which baked into strange shaped cookie puffs. still tasted pretty good!

This is my all time favorite cookie with pumpkin in it!  My family requests it every year.  I always use fresh pumpkin and it works great.  Also, last night we were able to make these vegan by using applesauce instead of the egg and margarine instead of the butter.  They turned out wonderfully!  I was so happy.  I even like the applesauce better because they are fluffier, so we make switch out our egg next time too (but we love our butter).

Yum! These are really good. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of a half tsp of cinnamon in the glaze/icing.  They reminded me of the pumpkin scones from you-know-where. They are pretty cakey though, not super cookie-like.

I enjoyed this recipe. The cookie was alright, but a little bland and in need of a little more spice and sweetness. I added a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice to the glaze, and it was delicious! Will make again with more spice.

YUM. 1 cup sugar.  1/2 brown 1/2 white.  Whole can of pumpkin.
Delicious without glaze also!  Save on calories by not having glaze.  Recipe made a lot.

These were amazing!  I followed the recipe as shown.  My only concern was how to store them without them getting too "wet". Any suggestions would be great.  These were full of flavor and fabulous!! But if I made the amount of cookies, I couldn't find a way to keep or preserve them for a few days without them getting mushy.  But I will definitely make them again! Yum!

I just made them and they turned out  really good. I like that they are not too sweet and with icing on top, they are just perfect. 
They are more like cake cookies. 

I baked them for 15 min and it was the right amount of time.  I will definitely make them again.

This is a very moist cookie that needs to be baked the full amount of time. When I make soft cake like cookies, I always wet my fingers and gently flatten the dough a little so the cookies do not look like "haystacks " when they are done. I used a brown sugar glaze on the cookies. Will try these again using Gina's frosting.

These turned out pretty tasty! The only thing I did differently was use pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices listed (just because I am a tight wad, it was cheaper this way). The cookies are pretty cakey I just wish I could get them to be a little more moist. I'll most likely make these again, they are easy and yummy!

These cookies are so good! I ran out of white sugar after 1 cup so I substituted 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. They still turned out great. Not too sweet and has the right amount of spice. I will definitely make these again.

Wonderfully moist! I do think they need at least a drizzle of frosting. I frost them and then sprinkle them with a sugar and cinnamon mix to make them pretty.

I advise you to not substitute the eggs and butter with pumpkin, unless you're vegan and you really want to try this recipe. The first time I made this, I cut down on the sugar but everything else remained unchanged. I didn't want to make icing for it to lessen the calories. They were really nice and cake-like, but the spice taste was really strong.  I made the second batch with the recommended measurements of sugar, however the spice was still way too strong and I messed up by substituting the eggs and butter with 3/4 cups additional pumpkin puree. They ended up really bread-like, but that's my own fault. I'm going to cut down on the cloves and cinnamon next time since I really like nutmeg,  plus I'll actually put icing, so hopefully they taste perfect!

The can of pumpkin was 15 oz. and I doubled the recipe, going a little light on all the ingredients except the spices.  They came out great, and made about 5 dozen cookies.  I wasn't sure since the recipe gave no info about yield.  It also pisses me off that the can was 15- instead of 16-oz.  Just another way to shortchange the consumer.

I added a cup of white chocolate chips and a cup of crushed walnuts.  These would be tasty on their own, but it gave the cookies some texture.  Very Carley and moist!  Will make these again!

Soooo good. Added maple extract instead of vanilla for the frosting. Added extra pumpkin too, as per feedback from others.

These were delicious! Very soft, almost like muffin tops. I would definitely wait until they are completely cooled before adding the frosting. I jumped the gun on that one. Even slightly mushy, all my friends and family thought they were awesome. If a recipe can handle an amateur, then it's definitely five stars!!

These cookies are amazing. The only change I made was replacing the spices with 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and adding a ½teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the glaze.

These are my favorite cookies! I've made them several times and have not had any issues with the recipe. I even threw in some mini chocolate chips one time. They are very moist and I usually store them in a large plastic container, sometimes with the lid off. I wouldn't recommend storing in plastic storage bags. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These came out perfect.  I was a little skeptical of the dough at first because it was more moist and sticky than "normal" cookie dough.  I substituted 1 1/2 cups white sugar for 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar (for no particular reason other than the desire for a more molasses taste).   I also added cinnamon to the frosting.   The cookies definitely need a sweet frosting. This recipe made 3 dozen cookies for me.

i was looking for a recipe to use pumpkin and this looked so yummy so couldn't resist trying.  After reading all the reviews and getting everyone's ideas, i made these "cake" cookies exactly as the recipe called for but just increased the amount of pumpkin puree.  The batter was very sticky.  Baked for 12 mins and found that they were too soft so left them in for another couple of mins.  Turned out really yummy and everybody loved them especially my daughter who runs at the sight of anything veggie related. definitely will be making again but will make sure i bake them for the 20 mins next time.

I'm making these right now and my house smells soooo good! I added white and cinnamon chips and walnuts. Made a lovely pumpkin cookie. I don't see the need for the glaze. Will be making many times.

Made these for my church group and they were a hit. They taste a little bland without the icing so I made sure to load up on the drizzle! I would suggest adding more sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg to spice it up a bit more. Overall a good cookie.  Not sure if I will make again because there are lots of other yummy pumpkin treats out there but this was a fun and easy recipe that made over 30 cookies!

Excellent! I used half coconut sugar and half white sugar. Added a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, and subbed whole white wheat flour. Also added some cinnamon to the glaze. The kids had to be dragged away from them!

I made these cookies tonight for the first time and they were delicious.  I took some tips from the previous reviews (1 cup of white sugar and half a cup of light brown sugar and also added more than a cup of the canned pumpkin) .  The cookies are cake like and the spices really come out and taste great.  I took the cookies to work and everyone raved about them.  Would definitely make again!!!

These cookies were very moist and delicious. The only change I made (personal preference) is I cut down the sugar. I prefer to eat them in the morning with a cup of coffee. Great recipe!

These things are delicious! The batter would be an amazing mouse (if it didn't have the raw egg!). I followed the recipe with the exception that I used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1 white sugar. Can't go wrong with brown sugar! Next time though,  I will hold back on the nutmeg & cloves- it left a strong taste in our mouth.  I didn't use the glaze.

I make these cookies all the time, they are a favorite. Although they are thought of as fall cookies I make them year  round. The only thing that I would change is that I never put icing on them, I think that they are too sweet if you do.

One of the best things I've ever baked and I bake all the time. Followed the recipe exactly except I ran out of white sugar so I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. They were delicious and cake like, not too sweet or spicy. Husband and 4 yr old loved them. These remind me very much of Starbucks pumpkin scones, truly great recipe. Made about 36 nice size cookies.

Loved the cookies and texture.  I did add a sprinkle of allspice to the batter, and dressed the icing up by adding some orange zest and a drop of orange extract .  I may leave the extract out next time, while the icing was delicious, it slightly covered the flavor of the pumpkin.

Wonderful fall cookie - tastes like a mini bite of pumpkin pie! I am in Colorado so made a few adjustments for high altitude.  I added 1/4c. flour and 2T. water (added to the flour) I also decreased the sugar by just a bit - scant. The cookies turned out nice and fluffy! I also used cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze.

This recipe is great! If you just like a drizzle of icing on your cookies, you can cut the icing recipe in half and have plenty. These are also good with chocolate chips instead of icing. Don't be scared if the dough seems really sticky; it turns into nice, cake-like cookies!

I just baked these cookies for the first time and followed the recipe as written.  I let my six year old daughter try one and told her I had never baked these types of cookies before.  Her response sums it up, "Make more!"  These cookies were an instant hit with everyone in my family.  Delicious!

Love how this cookie is cake like. The only thing I changed is the frosting. I made hard set vanilla frosting with 1 cup of confectioners' sugar, 2 teaspoon of milk, 2 teaspoon of light corn syrup, and 1/4 vanilla extract. The outcome was tasty!!! I will definitely make more as fall rolls around.

Everyone in my family loved them and here we are picky eaters. Even my sister who hates pumpkin now loves it thanks to these cookies! I now plan to makes them every year around the holidays seeing how much they're loved. I followed the recipe but found that they didn't need a lot of time in the over, 13 minutes maximum. They really need to be flattened down too because they can get really fluffy. Overall they were amazing!

I love this recipe! The icing was a little too sweet for me so I used more butter less sugar. The cookies really don't even need it they are to die for and fluffy.

Not sure I understand the hype around these cookies.  They were just alright. I found them overly sweet, yet bland at the same time.

These turned out beautifully! Very cake like cookies, they are moist and as another reviewer said, are similar to muffin tops in consistency. But, especially with that icing, they are delicious! I subbed half a cup of white sugar out for half a cup of brown, and added some cinnamon to the icing. It's gotten stellar reviews from family and friends, and may be my favourite new fall cookie!

Love this recipe! It reminds me more of pumpkin scones than a traditional cookie, which is awesome because that's what I was hoping for.  They're light and fluffy, just enough spice, and not a heavy dessert, even with the icing.  I think the light sweet of the "cookie" balances well with the sugary icing. I added some cinnamon to the icing because I love cinnamon, and it's just lovely! Will definitely  make again!

My kids love these cookies with cream cheese icing.  I do substitute Truvia Baking Blend and Brown Sugar Blend for the white sugar. No one can tell the difference!  I also add 1/4 tsp of allspice for a bit extra flavor. Yummy!

I made this exactly as it's written with the exception of the ground cloves, only because I didn't have any. These cookies are the best and I don't usually like anything that's not chocolate. Kids love them, too!

These cookies are delicious. I don't usually alter the recipe, but sometimes I drizzle the cookies with the icing and sometimes I dip the top of the cookie in the icing. Great both ways.

Yummy with the glaze especially! Made about 3 dozen. The glaze was enough for 2 batches - I saved the remaining in the fridge and used it a couple days later. As another reviewer suggested, I substituted 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, since I don't keep cloves on hand. I also used margarine instead of butter and it tasted fine.

These are sooooo good! When they first come out of the oven they seem a bit bland, but don't worry. They're more flavorful the next day. I make these yearly around Thanksgiving now.

These are FANTASTIC cookies.  They are very cakey and go fast.  I don't put a lot of frosting on and it keeps them from being too sweet.

These are my "go to" cookies anytime of the year. We are huge pumpkin fans around my house and if I'm going to make a cookie then this is the one to splurge on. I have made this recipe exactly "as is" about 2 dozen times and it never fails to impress.

Easy, moist, and tasty. These cookies bake up fast. They are chewy and hold together well. Delicious iced or not iced. Make a great lunch box treat! And, yes, we used Organic ingredients!

A sweet bread cookie lacking flavor without the glaze. I suggest pumpkin to 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 C, 1 C brown sugar, 3/4 C white sugar, measure your tsp of vanilla over the bowl without sweating overflow, 2 Tbspn and 2 dashes of cinnamon for me, but my cinnamon is old. 12 minutes of baking, or the cookie is ultra sticky, and let them sit for a while before closing them inside a container! It will let them dry a smidge so they don't become a tacky mess. I like topping them with a 60% cocoa drizzle, but they're tasty without, too.

So the first 8 cookies I made I followed the recipe to the T (minus the frosting), but I didn't like them all that much. They just weren't 'cookie' enough for me. So I added another 1/2 cup of pumpkin purée, 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice, and about 1/3 cup of sugar. Perfect! I baked them for about 13 minutes and they turned out big and soft. I also used my own frosting recipe (1/2 stick melted butter, half box of confectioners sugar and a few splashes of milk as I mixed.) my 2 year old daughter loves them!

( now they almost expect   us to make them LOL) really are good

This is one of my all time favorite cookie recipes. Super easy to make and such a great result! The only modification I make is to do 1 cup sugar and sub the other 1/2 cup for light brown sugar. I usually skip the icing and add mini chocolate chips. If you want them a little more gooey, just cook them a little less time. Not my preference, but that's how my husband likes them! They generally don't last more than a few days, but seriously are so good!

Very nice and easy to make. I made them exactly per the recipe. They turn out more like little miniature cakes or more line pumpkin bread in cookie-like format. I'll be making them again!

Love, love, love these cookies.  I can't understand the complaints about the texture - there's a wide spectrum of  textures  among different cookies, and this one just leans a little "cakey," but definitely doesn't detract from being a satisfying cookie.  I agree with other reviewers that 12 minutes is about perfect for baking these.  I followed the recipe other than swapping out 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown, but used a different frosting (a caramel frosting recipe I found elsewhere).   My husband doesn't think they'll make it to Christmas, which is only 3 days away!  I'll be making these again and again.

Will make again for sure. I had more pumpkin purée so I used more and reduced the amount of sugar by a third. (100g brown and 100g white). Frosting still not needed but not too sweet with it.

Nothing necessarily wrong with these cookies, just kinda boring. I zested an orange into the icing, which did jazz it up a bit

This is the first thing that I have baked from scratch by myself and it went pretty well. The cookies are really soft, like tiny cakes, and they taste really good. I used some brown sugar instead of all white and added some cinnamon to the icing so they would have a little more spice. My mother, who is an experienced baker, thought that they were really good.

I doubled this recipe and used some brown sugar in place of white sugar, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The batter is SO sticky to work with! I found it hard to put them on the cookie sheets and flatten because it just stuck to the spoon or my fingers. So mine turned out lumpy, prickly and not very pretty. I baked them for 15 minutes. I think they tasted good, but there's not a ton of flavour.. I feel like next time I want to add more pumpkin, as I also found mine a bit dry. Maybe I won't bake them as long either. Overall, good, but I will make some changes next time.

Great recipe and easy to follow! Definitely a family favorite. I followed the directions except I changed the sugar. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Thank you so much for sharing the treat. I'll be making these every year.

these are great, better to leave sit on the counter and not in a container.  they stay moist just sitting out.  i would prefer a whipped topping.

These were really good. I used 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour. I also didn't have cloves so I didn't put those in and I didn't put the glaze on. They were still a hit!

These are so moist and they taste great. Everyone loved them and they disappeared. They tasted like pumpkin bread but in a cookie and I loved the icing. If you love anything pumpkin you will love these.

I substituted a little less than 3/4 cup of Truvia for the sugar that was called for in this recipe, and I didn't have any ginger on hand.  
They turned out great!   My husband loved them.  Cutting the sugar made them not as sweet.. I like that. Will make again for sure.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I made these first just as written it was delish, but the second time I made these, I added one thing. I used 1/2 tsp of maple extract to the icing to give the overall flavor as little boost. Brought it to work, disappeared quickly. Yum!

also added a little more pumpkin to the cookies and even added some pumpkin and nutmeg to the icing.

AMAZING cookies. People scarfed them down like I put illicit substances in them.

(Just to add another layer of flavor, I put a little coriander in the icing. If you have it on hand, it's worth a try.)

I have made this recipe exactly as it is for the past 4 years during the Holidays. There is nothing like it! I omit the sugar drizzle on top and put a very small portion of powdered sugar instead to reduce the amount of sugar it has on it. Tastes amazing

I made these and followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do.  They were a big hit at Thanksgiving and everyone loved them!  Moist and not too sweet, they are great with a cup of coffee.  I wouldn't want to eat them without the glaze on top.  I added some sprinkles of nutmeg on top for looks while the glaze was still wet which kind of dressed them up a bit.  You could do that with any of the spices really.  Pretty to look at and tasty to eat.

Made these cookies for an office potluck.  Used 1/2 granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.   Doubled the spices to give them more flavor.  Next time I think I may try a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze.

So good. I took the tips from others and I made these with the 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the other seasonings with a dash of clove.  Dropped onto parchment paper and baked on half  cookie sheet.  Baked at a perfect 17 minutes.   These were soft and flavorful.  I skipped the frosting and went straight for the cream cheese.   Delicious

This is the second year I've baked these in the fall season and they always bring such a wonderful taste of autumn! Only change I made this year is to use a caramel icing found on another pumpkin cookie recipe on the site. It hardens well (great for stacking).

I took these to a birthday party and they were a huge hit. It was for an elderly gentleman and to say there were more than a few good cooks in the mix I was very proud of myself. 
Needless to say they will be a regular every Fall and Winter.

I have made these cookies several times starting at Thanksgiving through New Year's. My family and friends love them. I have made them for my Christmas cookie exchange parties. I include the recipe so my friend's can make them.  I sometimes have added a touch of Orange juice to the icing. It gives the cookies a really nice distinct flavor.

Have made these a few times now. For a much bolder spice flavor I add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, as well as doubling the clove and nutmeg (so 3tsp cinnamon, 1tsp each clove and nutmeg). I also add cinnamon to the icing (start with 1/2tsp and add more to taste). The result is a powerfully flavored spiced pumpkin cookie that tastes like pumpkin pie in a cake-cookie form! I don't mess with anything else in the recipe. Cookies come out cake-like in consistency.

My family always asks me to bring these cookies to our holiday get-togethers. I never bring any home!  The only change I made was substitute half of the white sugar for dark brown sugar and add about 1/2c more pumpkin.  It makes them a little more moist and pumkin-y!

Very good and moist - great spiced pumpkin flavor.  After reading the reviews, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar.  I used a cream cheese frosting rather than the one with the recipe.  I then placed a half a pecan on top so they looked awesome too.

These were wonderful!  They were very spongy, almost like a pumpkin sponge cake.  Everyone loved them!

I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers, plus some of my own:   

1)  Used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar,  
2) I used 3 tsps of pumpkin pie spice,
3) I added cinnamon to the icing.  

I found that one batch of icing was not enough.  Not sure if I overiced  :) , but either way, I made 1.5 total icing batches.

I've been making a similar version of these recipe for years and it's always a hit. Here are my modifications:
-1c sugar (instead of 1.5c)
-Half the icing ingredients, with 1tbp brown sugar OR mix in mini chocolate chips
-Optional: 1can of pumpkin puree instead of 1cup. I did this once by accident and they turned out great.

YUM! These are better than anything you can get in a corner bakery.  I added 1/2 tsp of ginger to the batter, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the glaze.  I added a little extra milk to the glaze to make it runny and dipped the tops of the cookies into it instead of drizzeling.  I think it's prettier that way and you get a nice thin layer of glaze in every bite.

I made these for my birthday at school and everybody ate them except for one girl who hated pumpkin, and two boys that had allergies. I love baking all things pumpkin, and I especially like pumpkin scones. I didn't want to make a giant platter of full-sized scones, so I thought these would be good enough. Tasted exactly like pumpkin scones, so good!

I made this with home-preserved (frozen) pumpkin, which is generally more liquid than canned. That said, I added 3/4 c. flour. I also used Mexican vanilla in the frosting. They are great. Even my husband, a dyed-in-the-wool chocoholic, loved them.

I love these cookies. They're like little bite sized pumpkin breads. I cut back on the cloves cause I'm not a huge fan of the flavor and use half white sugar, half brown as someone else suggested. I always use orange juice in the glaze. It just adds an extra flavor. If someone doesn't like sweet, you can leave out the icing and I still think they're yummy. Awesome recipe.

Yummy! I made it for a Halloween party and they went quickly. Reminds me more of a muffin top than a traditional cookie, but don't let that stop you. I got lots of complements and will definitely be making again. The only change I made was adding more vanilla to the batter. I may also try adding raisons next time.

Made theses cookies for Halloween bake sale for the partner's work today. They sold really fast. We both taste tested and the cookies plain were good-nice flavored cookie. Frosted didn't glaze and added either candy corn or pumpkin  or glazed pecan (which was the best!) for decoration. Also added cinnamon chips to batter. Amazing. Partner said I wished you would make another batch tonight! It is a keeper.

My five year old daughter and I made these together.  It was very easy to make and oh so delicious.  I am one of those people who have a little slice of pumpkin pie with my whip cream during the holidays and I can't get enough of these cookies.

.This recipe makes for a very gummy cakey texture that is not appetizing. I did follow the instructions and video.

It has been almost a year since the last time I made these, but when I asked my 8-year-old twins this week what they want me to make to bring to their classroom for their birthday treat this year, they requested these cookies over cupcakes, donuts or anything else! "Those were so yummy!" they said.  And since I already have the ingredients (read: no shopping necessary), I call that a WIN-WIN!

I did a double batch and it turned out delicious, every one loved them when I brought them to a party and some people even wanted the recipe. I would definitely recommend. If making a double batch you don't have to double the amount of frosting, I doubled it and I have about half left over.

These are delicious! I found that the cookie itself is not overly sweet, so I put quite a bit of icing on top. It made for the perfect combination! I believe that when making pumpkin flavored treats, the pumpkin should be the focal point! Also, I added cinnamon to the icing which gave it a cream colored, speckled icing- just lovely!

I think this recipe, as is, is absolutely delicious. I've made these many times now for my husband and he loves them. The only thing I do differently is add chocolate chips. Thank you for this recipe!

These were indeed wonderful and spicy!  I spread the icing on generously and I added chocolate chips (1 cup, but next time I'll add 1.5 cup) and chopped walnuts (approx 1/2 c).  I highly recommend adding the chocolate chips and walnuts.  I could not stop eating these cookies!  The spices come through strong for a very unique cookie experience.  I have some overripe bananas, I think I'm going to try this with banana now, but maybe with just the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Enjoy!!
UPDATE:  I made it with the bananas today (a scant 1 cup of mashed) + 1.5 cup choc. chips and 1/2 c walnuts, omitted the clove and 1/2 tsp of the cinnamon.  DELISH!!  Didn't need the icing as the banana and choc. chips made it plenty sweet.  SO MOIST AND SOFT, like little muffins.

So yummy! Perfect - if you are a pumpkin lover. The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar) I also added Pumpkin Pie Seasoning to the icing. Happy October!

I made these exactly as written, and while the pumpkin flavor was there which is essential to any  pumpkin treat, it was somewhat dry, and the glaze did not coat the cookies like the picture shows. Overall, it was good and I would happily eat more, but they weren't great.

I really loved these cookies. Although I hate changing the recipe and find it really hard to make a recipe when all the reviews basically change everything, I still tweaked a bit.

I doubled the recipe so that I could use the whole can of pumpkin. I hate waste.  I added 1/3 cup more sugar and about 1 cup more flour. That is it.  Loved them.

This recipe is a keeper for me.  When I made the icing,  I added some maple flavoring.  The only other change I would make is to add some chopped nuts to the batter.

I followed this recipe and just made one change. Instead of 1.5 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup of white and .5 cups of brown. The cookies turned out well and there was no need to flatten them using my cookie scoop. I found a bag of pumpkin flavored chips in Aldi and melted them in the microwave to use as a topping, and then added a spider web on top with melted chocolate. They look really nice and store bought. This was my first time doing the spider web and I used a tooth pick to achieve the look.

I don't know about this cookie. Based on the reviews, I was expecting something awesome but that's not a what I got. I think that the recipe needs to specify the size (oz.) of pumpkin puree because all my grocery stores only carry the large can that makes 2 pies. Since the recipe calls for 1 can, I used 1 can but this made a cake batter consistency "dough". I tightened it up with flour but I'm not happy with the results.
  The flavor and texture was like a pumpkin pie-made into a cake-made into a cookie. I love pumpkin pie so I loved the flavor of the cookies.

Love this recipe! I find the icing part of the recipe not as great as the actual cookie. I either use a regular cream cheese frosting or even just add chocolate chips to sweeten it up without the icing. I haven't ever had these cookies sitting on my counter for longer than one night!!!

I have been making these cookies for work for the past three years and they are a FAVORITE. I actually divide the vanilla extract measurement in half between vanilla and cinnamon extract. The longer cooking, cooling and frosting set time are well worth it

I made this without the icing and i thought it was delicious!  I am 8 months pregnant right now and love to nibble on snacks and I thought it would be best to skip the icing (so i can eat more).  I ate almost all the cookies!  ha ha.  But my husband also loved them.

This was exactly what I was looking for. A cake-like cookie with a light pumpkin flavor. Drizzle the icing or the pumpkin flavor gets lost. Perfect for a fall evening with a cup of tea or coffee.

I thought these were very good! The flavor is like a subtle version of pumpkin pie and the cookie itself bakes up beautifully. I ended up using a 1 1/2 tbsp cookie scoop and then flattening them slightly with a spoon dipped in powdered sugar. I loved that they didn't spread very much at all so I was able to really load up my cookie sheet. They cooked perfectly for me in 14 minutes.

For years I have had my third graders make these cookies in class to practice their math and problem solving skills. Children who swore they didn't like pumpkin absolutely loved these cookies. I always received parent emails asking for the recipe. Some children have told me that it is now a family tradition to make these each October.                                                        Now that we can't cook at school I still make them every year for the staff. The fly off the platter in no time and I am always asked for the recipe.

Subbed 1 cup of splenda for some of the sugar and 1 cup of whole wheat flour for some of the all purpose.  I also gently rolled the heaping tbsp of dough in my hands to make a ball before placing and gently flattening on the cookie sheet, just to make them More uniform in shape.  
These are delicious!  Soft, cake like, and the icing really tops them off deliciously.  I think my family will gobble these up!  Thank you for the recipe

I make these every year around fall time, and forget how good they are. The only ingredient I omit is the cloves, just because I'm not fond of them. I cannot say enough great things about these cookies, they are DELICIOUS!

These were very good. I added 1/4 c brown sugar to the cookie mixture and 1/2t cinnamon to the glaze because I was afraid they were going to be bland. The cookies turn out to be very cake-like. 
I'll make these again, but will probably try adding nuts to the cookies, and a glaze made with orange juice next time to punch it up a little bit.

Delicious! Like many others, I used 1cu white sugar and 1/2cu light brown sugar. I added 1/4tsp ginger and a little extra pumpkin. Baked for 12 minutes. Used cookie scoop and then flattened. I plan on icing them with cream cheese icing, but they just came out the oven and are great plain!

i made these cookies, and they are wonderful! I changed the recipe a bit, and instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar i added only 1 cup white sugar, and a half a cup of brown sugar! The icing makes these cookies perfect! These cookies will defiantly be a family fall recipe tradition for my kids and husband! They all loved it! The spices are perfect, and you can really taste the pumpkin!

I made this as written, and these were good. The texture is on the soft, cakey  side, and the cookies are not sugary, so you have to be generous with the frosting if you are craving something on the sweet side. My family wasn't as enthusiastic about them as I was, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

I followed the recipe but used one of the previous raters tip about using 3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice  in place of the other spices listed and they were fantastic with and without the icing...I might try a touch of cinnamon in the frosting next time :)

These are without a doubt some of the best cookies I've ever had! I made them today and followed the recipe to a tee and OH MY GOSH! Amazing! The icing goes so well on them and they look so pretty. The cookies bake a beautiful shape and are so moist it's almost like a piece of cake :)

Substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup coconut sugar and they were awesome. The icing is super yummy...added a bit of cinnamon to icing as others suggested. Highly recommend.

As other reviewers suggested I added a whole can of pumpkin puree and doubled up on the cinnamon. The cookies were ridiculously good. They tasted like muffin tops, and everybody knows that is the best part of the muffin! If you store these in an air tight container they seem to get moisturer so keep that in mind if that isn't something you want. Make these, love them, and praise the creator of the wonderful recipe!

Have been making these since I was a kid.  Only difference is that I add lots of walnuts and use a glaze made of powdered sugar & lemon juice.  I love the zing of the lemon glaze on these.

Delicious cookies! I  followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  Next time I will add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the glaze since I love the spices.  I'll be adding these to my regular holiday baking.

Delicious! Since I was running low on baking supplies I had to make two changes, I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half white flour and used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup canola oil.  They were fluffy and had a hint of spice.  I would probably make them the same way again as they were slightly healthier and so tasty.

After reading all of the reviews, I knew these had to be amazing! I was a bit surprised by how sticky the dough was, only because I've never baked anything pumpkin-related but my gosh, it was SO hard not to eat all of them. (Which I would have gotten sick but ya'know). They're THAT good. I only added a bit more sugar and pumpkin puree to give it a more deep flavor. And let me tell you they're SO moist! If you're looking for the perfect soft cookie, this recipe's a winner. I made 2 batches of these cookies and gave them to all my family. My Mom ate it with whip cream and said it tasted like pumpkin pie. I think it tastes like pumpkin bread to be honest. :)  And for first timers, make sure you put plenty of flour on them when rolling the dough into a ball. The end result will have a bit of flour on them but you can't even taste the flour so its all good. : ) My Dad bought 4 cans of pumpkin puree today, so I think I'm going to make 4 more batches lol. I have no idea who's going to eat them but I'm sure any cookie lover would love to eat these! I would put 10 stars if I could.

I've made these cookies twice this past month.  My husband and I love them.  They are simple to make and taste so good. I have a batch in the oven as I am writing this and they smell so good.  I can't wait to see what our family thinks when the visit next weekend. I plan on making them for the holidays too.  Already bought three cans of pumpkin!!! Thanks so much for this delicious cookie recipe.

Tasty with frosting, but very bland without.  I think they would be better with cranberries or raisins added.

These cookies were great and were gone very quickly. I docked a star due to the "15-20 minute" baking time. That's a five minute window. Too long. Also, there was no mention of whether or not the cookie sheet needed to be greased.

i followed reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar and used a bit more pumpkin. I also bumped up the spices. Made the glaze as directed. They were good and people liked them but they were way too soft and cake like, not like a cookie. Glad I followed the reviewers suggestions and didn't store in an air tight container. I took 2 dozen to a meeting and every liked them enough to eat them all.  Another dozen are in the freezer and I may use cream cheese icing on those. Probably won't make again.

It was awesome I put a chocolate drizzle on instead of icing it and it was amazing 
For the chocolate drizzle you need 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips and a teaspoon and a half of shorting microwave 30 seconds at a time stirring between until smooth

Everyone loves these cookies. The texture is similar to a scone. I added ginger and allspice to give them a little extra spice. I also steeped a chai tea bag in the milk and butter for about 5 minutes before adding the vanilla and icing sugar to make the icing.

I think that the cookie without the icing would be quite bland. I added 1/2  t cinnamon to the icing, which was a good addition.

My family devoured these!  They disappeared in less than a day. I did not have cloves so I left that out. My husband suggested I cut down the cinnamon, but that did not seem to matter as they were gone so quickly. I used maple flavoring in the icing instead of vanilla and I thought it paired really well with the flavors. I may add nuts to the icing next time--another reviewer suggested that.  I know I made substitutions but still had to give it five stars. I will make these again this week.

excellent pumpkin cookie, soft with great taste not too sweet. Do not cover tightly when storing, too soft.  I used cream cheese in place of butter for icing and added lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. very good.

These aren't all that great.

These are so spongey and cakey when you bite into them not like a cookie at all plus they taste really bland w/o the icing on them. 
These would probably be really good if the recipe was 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar.

I probably won't make these again unless I feel in the holiday spirit.

I made these for my family and they  were pretty good. the texture was more muffin-like than I've ever had in a cookie, and the icing didn't go over well (may have been my ingredients, I don't know), but they were great for breakfast. Next time, I might make them as muffins.

These were great cookies! Going by some of the reviews, I did change the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar to 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown. Also, I added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed. I also used all 15 ounces of the pumpkin purée and did not add extra flour to make up for the extra pumpkin. The cookies came out cakey for me, I love the texture. I baked them for 12 minuets! Aaaaand I used cream cheese icing instead of the icing recipe, my family loved them with the icing, I prefer them without it! Will make again!

I love this recipe.  I once bribed my son in law by offering him a dozen if he'd hang a light for me.  He loves these cookies.  My daughter is waiting for a dishful.  They are soft and deliciously spicy.  A perfect cookie.  You'll want to double the recipe.  Oh, and I added a little fresh ginger...because I love ginger.

I made this cookie exactly as the recipe stated. The cookie was dry and not very flavorful. The glaze wasn't good either. The cookie texture was cakey/spongey which did not appeal to me.  Neither element (cookie or glaze) were very good so the end product was not very good. If I make this again I would add more pumpkin and sugar, throw in chocolate chips and reduce the baking time to 12 minutes. Don't even bother with the glaze...

I made these cookies for a bake sale and altered it slightly by doubling the pumpkin and adding ginger to the spices.  At high altitude baking generally takes a little more of a skilled touch to adjust for the rise and to keep the moisture consistent.  I made no specific adjustments for altitude and these were the first cookies that I have made that came out perfect and were the first items sold out at the sale.  This recipe made me shine and as an amateur baker I will keep this as my go-to recipe for all desserts go forward.

Delicious.  I didn't have any nutmeg or cloves,  so I used apple pie spice. It still turned out fantastic!

They are still warm in my kitchen, and they are really good!  I followed the recipe to the letter and although most of the time I find things I would change; that was not the case with this.  I used a small 12oz can of pumpkin since the recipe did not state what size to use.  

I did make some of them into cookies on a sheet, and some in small cupcake pans to see how they would turn out of it.  With a little baking spray, they came right out and they are a perfect size.  The icing is sweet so you might want to adjust how much you put on it.  

These are moist without being sticky and if you like pumpkin, you will enjoy these.

I made these cookies LACTOSE FREE and healthier for my family by substituting Earth Balance Sticks for the butter and almond milk for the dairy milk.  They were fabulous!  I also adjusted it slightly for my personal taste by using the whole can of pumpkin, adding 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 c. chopped dried cherries, and 1/2 c. chopped pecans to the mix and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the icing.  They were done at 14 minutes.  Great recipe that can be modified easily!

Yum. Soft and so delicious. I usually don't like pumpkin, but these are great! I add cinnamon to the glaze, but other than that, I bake as written.

Ha! As I sat down to write this review my mom texted asking for a the recipe. I've made these for work and family and they are enjoyed by all. They taste like the pumpkin scones you used to be able to get at Starbucks! I make vanilla and maple glaze to drizzle with flair. Easy and delicious.

These are a great Fall cookie.  I went with the suggestion of 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown.  I was tempted to use the whole can of pumpkin (because what do you do with the rest?) especially since other reviewers had success doing that.  Instead I just threw in a few extra slugs and threw out the rest of the can.  The cookies were just fine, so next time I'll be braver and put the whole can in there!  Instead of glaze, I used cream cheese frosting (4 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla and enough powdered sugar to stiffen it up, about 2 cups).

I did not have good luck with this recipe.  I started off following it exactly (except adding extra spice), but I ended up with batter, not dough.  I looked up a couple other pumpkin cookie recipes and ended up adding another cup of flour and another egg.  The final result ended up tasting fine, and the  texture is similar to pumpkin bread.

Very truly, this recipe was amazing! The texture and the flavor were two strong highlights with myself and others! I also really enjoyed the glaze! I did scale back a touch on the nutmeg to 1/4 t and cloves to an 1/8 t because I know the right amount of spice that works for me. I would like to see if I could cut back a little on the butter; I'm not sure if a whole stick is absolutely necessary; nonetheless; amazing; you must try this recipe!

As a huge pumpkin fan I loved the flavour of these cookies, although next time I would cut down slightly on the cloves. Texture wise they were way better straight out of the oven. Even without sealing them they became moist and chewy within 24 hours. I went without the icing and they were sweet enough for me as dessert and great with coffee.

Just WOW! These are completely delicious. The only thing I did differently was use 3/4c white & 3/4c brown sugar (instead of all white) and 1.5tsp cinnamon with 1.5tsp pumpkin pie spice (instead of 2tsp cinnamon with nutmeg & cloves). The glaze is wonderful & perfect on the cookies. Definitely a keeper!

I rated 3 stars on 1/5/14.

Made it again on 11/19/16 and bumped it up to 4 stars. I especially liked it when I crushed up some thin candied ginger and sprinkled it on top of the glaze before it hardened. I also added a few shakes of cinnamon to the glaze, per another reviewer's recommendation.

I LOVE this recipe.  They are so moreish, one is never enough.  I tried piping the batter to get a more uniform shape... a bit of hassle.  Was so much effort I'm not sure it justifies the result.  People love these cookies!

DANGEROUS! These cookies are incredible! Made this a few days ago and were a huge hit! You can't eat just one, however. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a tad more spice. I baked mine for 13 minutes and they came out so lovely! I like how soft and moist they were, as well. The drizzle of icing on top adds just the right amount of extra sweetness. A keeper, for sure! Wonder if this recipe can be used for muffins???

Fantastic! The only change I made was the 2nd time I made them, I made a half batch but accidentally added the full amount of cinnamon and it was even better. I'll be doubling the cinnamon from now on when I make them. I also found that applying the glaze with a pastry brush was much easier and left more of it on the cookie than drizzling. I don't drink coffee, but those in my house who do confirmed that these are amazingly good with coffee.

I baked them for Christmas and it was everyone's favorite cookie! I baked them for a 2-4 extra minutes because I knew that the humidity here in Hawai`i would make them even more moist and sticky. I used a sandwich ziploc bag with the edge cut to ice the cookies.

These were wonderful. I needed to use up half a large can of pumpkin and these were perfect! I made them exactly like the recipe directs, and my husband and I both liked them a lot. I found it worked a lot better to top the cookies with icing to dip each cookie in the bowl of icing and then let it drip back into the bowl - made less of a mess than drizzling it on all the cookies. I will definitely be making these again in the future.

Light, fluffy, perfectly balanced sweet & spice.  My kids LOVED them and so did I.  Thank you!
I made them for Christmas in 2013, Thanksgiving in 2015 and will make them again this Christmas (2015).

This recipe is tasty and easy to make. I did follow some suggestions. 2 eggs, mostly brown sugar, increased amount pumpkin, a touch of maple syrup, and increased amount of spices. I also put in some raisins, which were great. These were like pumpkin bread in cookie form in my opinion. I think they look cute. I brought them to a Christmas cookie party.  People didn't gravitate towards them like they did to showier cookies like pretty frosted sugar cookies. Oh well, more for me and my family! Had some for breakfast with coffee. Yum. I used Pam spray on the cookie sheets and they came off easily. This is an easy way to make a heck of a lot of tasty cookies.

Personally, I love these cookies. My other half wasn't thrilled - said the icing was too sweet. I don't think so. I used a whole can of pumpkin puree, and on the icing, I used rum extract. Cookies are moist, and great with coffee. The work family LOVED them.

A cake-like texture to these cookies.  They do have alot of flavor, but they aren't the best cookies I've ever had.  Will try a different recipe next time.

These are pretty delicious! A little cakey for my liking, but that's what they're supposed to be like right? I didn't have cloves, so just used cinnamon and nutmeg - turned out delicious.  Good balance of spice and pumpkin and sweetness. Definitely add cinnamon to the icing. These are pretty little cookies :)

Every year we have a full Thanksgiving Dinner on my job (the week before).  I made the dessert, deciding on cookies.  Needing one more, I took a chance on this recipe.  Absolutely perfect.  I had an extra bag of craisins so I added them, and they really complimented an already perfect cookie.  They were soooo moist!  The spices make them taste more like gingerbread than a pumpkin cookie.  Everyone loved them! They will now be a must on our holiday menu!

Made this recipe exactly as written, and they came out PERFECT! I would not change a thing. They are moist and chewy, and those that mentioned leaving off the icing- I'm sure they are delicious without it- but you are missing out because they are AMAZING with it. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are moist, flavorful and a new favorite of mine!  I am making an extra batch to take to the deactivation event Dec 22 for the 235th MP Co arriving home from Afghanistan just in time for Christmas!

This recipe is easy to assemble and delicious!  My husband had one lone surviving pumpkin from his garden.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try last night.

At first, I thought I was going to have a mess on my hands when I used semi-soft-melted butter...but I added a bit more flour - 1-2 Tbsp for the consistency I thought would be right. (Our homegrown pumpkin may have had more moisture in it than canned.)  It wasn't necessary to press the dough and I had exactly 3 dozen cookies.  I iced them this morning, but tried them without the icing last night and they were every bit as good!  Oh, I did add cinnamon chips to half the batch and they were just as good!

I made the recipe just the way it read.  They came out great.  I put them on the porch since I am baking a lot of cookies to keep fresh. Went back 2 weeks later and they were as soft as the day I made them.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is perfect as written. I bake the cookies for 15 minutes and they are soft, moist, and yummy.  The glaze is a must.  I substitute my gluten free flour blend for the all purpose flour, add a teaspoon of xanthan gum, and they are great for my daughter and I.  I made these (GF) for a church function and they were gone in minutes!

These cookies were not what I had expected... they were much more =) They are far from your average cookie; fluffy and moist like personal little pumpkin breads, and the drizzle of glaze over the top adds the perfect sweetness. I love the subtle spices and hint of pumpkin you catch at the end of every bite. These will definitely be a holiday favorite every year and I am excited to bring these to Thanksgiving dinner this year.

Great recipe! Made as written for a work event. I make lots of pumpkin treats because I love them and these have the spiced goods that make me love all the others. Expecting them to be a hit. Will be making them again...probably sooner than later.

First time making this pumpkin cookie. The result was more of a muffin top than a cookie. It's definitely more cake-like than it is cookie-like. It's moist and soft, however, it lacks taste. Does not make a great cookie without the glaze.

These got great reviews from the party I took them too and they're pretty easy to make.  I used half wheat flour, half all-purpose.  The icing isn't neccessary, but I love that if you do use it, it doesn't over power the pumpkin flavor.

This was delicious!!!!!!!! They only lasted about 2 hours after making them! I do have to say though that everybody liked the iced ones, right after taking out of oven, and they tasted better dipped in the frosting, than drizzled :)

We made these tonight and LOVED them! Super tasty alone but we had to try them with butterscotch chips and that was amazing! We also dipped some in a cream cheese glaze after baking and others we topped with walnuts before baking. This one is going in the book! Thank you Gina!

I'm not a fan of pumpkin, but I had a lot of pumpkin puree.  These are great, easy to make and they taste good.  I love soft cookies, not the hard ones and these were perfect.

I made these cookies to try then out before Thanksgiving and everyone, including my mother who is not a pumpkin person, loved them! They're a soft, cakey cookie that actually tastes like fall. I did however make a few changes- I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and only 1 cup of white sugar and since i didn't have cloves, I replaced all the spices with Penzey's pumpkin pie spice. They came out great, but do really taste better with the icing than without.

Cookies were an amazing texture and the icing was beautiful. Only advice I can give is use a little extra spices/pumpkin, I didnt experience a rich, similar to pumpkin pie type cookie which was what I was hoping for.

This was a great recipe for using my leftover canned pumpkin after making pumpkin pie, as I had everything I needed in the pantry already. I substituted brown sugar instead of white, as it makes the cookies softer which I love. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. For the icing I added a couple of drops of orange essence. These tasted amazing! More like mini cakes though. Were a big hit with my partner who doesn't normally like 'sweet' things. Had to take them to work to get them out of the house and they were a big hit!

These cookies are fantastic. I used the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin (1 3/4 cups), substituted half the white sugar for brown sugar, and added 1/2 cup of raisins.

I left the icing off some -- they taste more like muffin tops without the icing, which in my opinion is totally fine. The icing adds sweetness and transforms them into more of a dessert item.

As another user mentioned, don't store these cookies as a sealed container. I left them in an open bag in the fridge to keep the icing from getting gummy, and that helped the cookies from going to much as well.

Amazing! We couldn't stop eating them. With the icing they tasted like pumpkin doughnuts. After reading the comments, I used 1c. white sugar and 1/2c. brown sugar. These are going to be Christmas presents.

These cookies are delicious. They are like a cross between cake and biscuit. My husband and I both loved them, as did our 5 year old grand-daughter. The only change I made was to double the spices. The house smells wonderful after baking. I'll be making these again and again.

These are really good cookies. I added the whole can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup, used whole wheat flour, replaced 1/2 cup flour with wheat germ, and I didn't make the glaze. They turned out bready (which I like) and aren't as sweet as typical cookies, which again I like. We aren't big sweets fans in this house so they were sweet enough to quench my sweet tooth.

I don't like cloves so I substituted with ginger, and I baked mine for less time as the first dozen burned. I live at a high altitude and I think that may have been my issue. Also, it doesn't say whether to grease the cookie sheets prior to baking. DON'T grease them, you can use parchment if you wish, or a well seasoned sheet works just fine. I also found if you make the icing a bit thicker you can use a spoon right after they come out of the oven and it melts beautifully over the whole cookie without leaving too much icing behind.

Surprisingly delightful! I'm not a fan of pumpkin unless it's around the holidays (which is when I tried this recipe), so it really had that perfect blend of holiday spice and flavor. Baking it for 15 minutes gave it a fluffy, almost cake-like texture since it was so soft, so perhaps baking it for 18-20 minutes would make them a bit crisper, depending on your taste.

I make this recipe every year for Halloween.  The only thing I change is that I add food coloring to the icing.  I make it green and I call the cookies, "Pumpkin Snotties."  Adds an "ewww" factor and is a hit at kid's Halloween parties! I usually present them with a picture of the "Slimer" from Ghostbusters.

These cookies came out good! I used 1/4 cup of apple sauce in place of half the butter. I also used 3tsp of pumpkin spice in place of the nutmeg and cloves. And finally i used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar. I did not make the icing and there was no need to.

Such soft, yummie, cake-like cookies.  I added a touch of lemon juice to the icing to add citric flavour.

I used 1/2c brwn sugar and 3/4c white sugar and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice mix from this site plus 1 more tsp of cinnamon. These were great! Double the vanilla. We haven't even iced them yet and my kids are gobbling them up!

These are great cookies. I made a few changes after reading some of the other reviews. For the spices, I replaced the cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice. I also added an additional 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. For the flour, I replaced 1/2 the white flour with wheat to make a denser texture. And for the frosting I added cinnamon. I suggest you cut the frosting portions in half if you like your cookies lightly Frosted.  These cookies taste even better the second day! The spices really come to full flavor. I had these with my morning coffee. Delicious!

I followed the recipe to the tee and it lacked flavor. It needed more pumpkin puree and an ingredient that popped. However it was very moist and the texture was nice. The icing sugar definitely helped!

This recipe is so delicious!  I don't think it makes quite 3 dozen.  I've been lucky to get two dozen, but maybe it's because I make the cookies large.  I make this from all the sugar pumpkins that kids collect during the month of October.

These pumpkin cookies are by far the best I have ever had! The flavor is absolutely delicious and the texture/moistness is just perfect. My kids and I made them to give to teachers at their school and everyone raved about them. I made them exactly as written and will do so again with the exception of making less of the icing because it made way more than needed for the cookies. We left the icing off of some as well and they are delicious even without the icing. I highly recommend this recipe!

These are so delicious they can be very addicting!!!(I ate so many) I added some pumpkin puree to the glaze to make it a little more pumpkin-y!! I also ended up baking it for only 13:30 for the last batches because I feel like 15-20 minutes is just too much. Overall I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!

Yum! I thought 1 can of pumpkin was suppose to be used so I put about that in! I used pumpkin pie mix and coconut sugar and I still added all the spices. These are so good! Very soft and cake-like. I frosted them with a cream cheese frosting I got from Food Network. Love them!
UPDATE: Made them again and was short 2 tbsp of butter and this time I added chocolate chips instead of icing. Still turned out amazingly yummy!

These were sooo good! And really easy. The only things I did differently was 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup white sugar, 2.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, and used 18% table cream in the icing instead of milk. I was contemplating making cream cheese icing but the icing in the recipe was perfect, so glad I didn't! 

You have to smooth out the batter because all the peaks will stay. I found wetting my fingers with cold water and smoothing them out worked better than a spoon. 

I brought them to a potluck and people who don't usually like pumpkin-flavoured things liked these.

Three kids loved these.  I thought they were just ok.  I think they had too much clove and not enough pumpkin.  I will probably make changes to correct if I make this recipe again.

I made these for my husband to take to work for a potluck. They were a HUGE hit! Of course I knew they would be based on all the previous reviews :) I made them exactly as written and they are perfect as is. However I did make a small change foe the icing - I used 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of maple flavoring. Go ahead . . . Make these!!

These were really yummy, soft and comforting.  Just what you want in the Fall as the weather starts to cool down.  I think that next time I may add some orange zest to the icing, but other than that the recipe was a huge hit at my house.

very good, on the second batch I added a tsp. more cinnamon, but that's a personal taste. I also added cinnamon to my frosting for a little extra spice. Very good as is though so its still 5 star without my personal touches added to it.

WOW! I wish I could give these 5 stars, but I can't because I did make an adjustment and baked them 12 minutes instead of the 15-20 that is recommended.  They were DELICIOUS!  I admit, a bit fluffier than the usual cookie but they were amazing!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! Received amazing reviews - even from those who don't like pumpkin. I did use 3 tsp. pumpkin spice instead of the cinnamon, nutmeg & clove. I got about 3 dozen and they were all gone in 1 day - I've been asked to make more. Perfect Thanksgiving treat! Thank you for submitting!!!!
UPDATE: I've had to make this recipe for every one of our family and friends at least TWICE each!! UPDATE: I'm going to try freezing these. Will post and update when we try them. *fingers crossed*

Moist, chewy and delicious!  I would avoid storing in an airtight container, however.  Mine got a bit mushy by the next day.  Without the icing they may have stored better.

I absolutely love pumpkin and these are amazing! They did not last 2 days at my house. As suggested by another poster I subbed pumpkin pie spice for the other spices and was heavy handed on the cinnamon. I also had to use oil, but they turned out fabulous!

They smelled good, and looked good. But, they were bland and tasted a bit floury. I added a touch more salt and cinammon to my last batch. It helped a little. I won't be making these again.

Every time I make these cookies, they are a HUGE hit. I always skip the icing but they are still so delicious. I usually add double the amount for cinnamon and nutmeg to give them some added flavor.

I don't know how it happened but this recipe didn't save in my recipe box. I made these cookies a few years ago. They were AMAZING! I can't believe I forgot about them. Shame on me! I just stumbled across this recipe once again. Amd believe me, I'm mot forgetting about it this time. Even if you're not a huge pumpkin fan, these cookies are Devine. Thank you!!!

DELICIOUS, I followed the recipe to the T and it was great! Next time I will make a smaller batch of icing, I drizzled it all over the cookies and I had a lot left over.

This is my first review.... Great recipe!! I only changed one thing - 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of white. Shaped them a bit with my fingers before going into the oven and 15 minutes later they were perfect. I also liked the glaze but I'm not sure it needed the butter. I added a dash of cinnamon as others suggested and that was a nice touch.
I think next time I will add a tad more 'spice' to the cookie but everyone loved them! Thanks!

Found some pumpkin puree in the pantry and decided to whip up these goodies. Very easy and turned out delicious. I think they can stand on their own without the glaze. Great for a fall treat or if you are craving something pumpkin spice.

These cookies are amazing! The first time I made them I brought them to Sunday Dinner and there was none leftover. My husband insists they are the best cookies he's ever eaten. I will likely make these year round. The texture is incredible - so moist and soft. I stick to the recipe almost exactly, I simply add 1/2 tsp of ground ginger as well. If you are debating making these cookies stop and just do it! You won't have any regrets.

These are PERFECT pumpkin cookies...  They were soft and had the perfect flavor! I even made a batch with my mothers gluten free flower mix and they were still perfect! (Some people make the mistake of letting cookies sit on the hot sheet once they're out of the oven, but with almost all cookies you need to remove them immediately, and that will keep them soft.)

Fantastic!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg and cloves. Add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to frosting.  Karen H. asked for recipe so must be good! :)

Super good cookies. Made a double batch with a 15oz can of pumpkin. I used a medium cookie scoop and got 42 cookies that were the size of an average cookie. I then made some smaller ones and got 58 out of that batch. I baked the smaller cookies for 12 min. and the larger ones for 15 min. I didn't double the batch of frosting, but I did add a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and about 3tbsp. of whipped cream cheese. I also added some chopped pecans to the tops. These cookies are great. I think next time I will add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the frosting to give it a little more flavor. I may also try subbing orange juice for the milk, and maybe another batch with maple flavor. yummm, what a great fall recipe.

I really liked this recipe and so did my boyfriend! I did not put the glaze on mine simply because I didn't have the ingredients for it, but the cookies are good without them! Also, they stay super moist for quite some time just sitting on the counter. They seemed to me to be more like small pumpkin cakes than cookies but still very yummy!

These cookies are absolutely delicious!!! I added maple syrup and cinnamon to the icing to add color and flavor. I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated sugar instead of just white sugar like many other comments suggested. My only concern was that the cookies lacked pumpkin flavor even though I used an extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin puree.

This is my first time baking pumpkin cookies and the recipe was very easy to follow. The cookies turned out great! However, as I didn't make the icing, the cookies were not sweet enough. Also the cinnamon taste was a little too strong. Maybe the next time round I will add more sugar and pumpkin and a little less spices.

This is actually a review for a friend, but she really liked the cookies and said they were delish.  I don't have any pumpkin so I can't make this cookie, but if I did, I think it would be a good and easy recipe.  I am also confident that they would fit in the REI no sit zip pants, which are awesome btw's, because the pockets are so huge.  You can literally fit everything you need in them and when you need to change into shorts, you just unzip the pants, you don't even have to sit.

Theses are the most yummy "cookie/cake" ever.  I have made them several times now and my kids even make them for me when we all want a homemade treat.  To make the frosting even better, we added some maple flavoring.  These could be in a 5 star bakery.

These cookies are really moist.  I made then gluten free using 2.5 cups of "Carole's sorghum blend".    I added 2 tsp xanthan gum and doubled the vanilla.  Delicious

Excellent!  Reminds me of the pumpkin "muffies" from Panera Bread!  I don't frost-I dust them with powdered sugar!  My 3 and 10 year olds love these!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I actually made them for a party that ended up getting cancelled, but my family had no problem with that and ate all four dozen over the course of the next three days! I used fresh pumpkin puree and had no problems with the conversion. I also used a pre-made icing (trying to use up ingredients). These will be a fall favorite in our house!

Boy was I impressed with these pumpkin cookies. I don't even eat sweet food and I went for seconds.  The texture is perfect.  As someone aptly described, they are like muffin tops.  Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar as reviewer recommendation and added cinnamon to icing.  I know I'll need a second batch of these for feeding a bunch of hungry cyclists this weekend.

Lightly grease pan.  Recipe makes 36 decent sized cookies.  Icing is twice what's needed if drizzling.

THANK YOU FOR THIS AWESOMELY DELICIOUS RECIPE! have made this a few times and now and they're so yummy. The only thing I now do differently is make half of the glaze called for since the first time I had so much left over and our cookies were sufficiently drizzled covered and I don't want them too sweet as I want to taste the "cookie-cakes" as we call'm.

Try it you won't be disappointed!

Delicious! Huge crowd pleaser - everyone i know always talks about them. I adjusted the recipe by using 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, add 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. BOX OF OREOS! If you have ever heard of Monster Mash ice cream, you are going to be in heaven. Pumpkin Oreo in a cookie! If you haven't had the mix before, trust me try it out! Last, for the glaze i added some cinnamon and food coloring.

Great cookie. Followed directions except for the icing. Took someone else advice and used cream cheese icing. Yummmm    Update:   You really do not need icing. It tastes good all by itself.

Batter tastes exactly like Betty Crocker Pumpkin Spice Cookie Mix...but the final product isn't the same.  Finished cookies are cake-like, and tasty..but I might bump up the sugar & spice.  Very good though.  (I did not ice them)

My new favorite holiday cookie. I actually used only half the butter by mistake the first time I made else cookies, but they turned out perfectly so I'm sticking to that. They also taste great without the icing.

awesome! I altered by only using 1/4 C butter and then 1/2 coconut oil and lard for the remainder 1/2 C needed. I will definitely use this recipe again!!

These are my favorite cookies ever!! So moist and delicious. I wasn't much of a pumpkin fan before these, but now I totally am! I converted many people at work too... 3 dozen were gone in less than 5 minutes! I usually just add the entire can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup, and use about 3 generous teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices. Other than that, I pretty much follow the recipe as is. And to make them more 'visually appealing' I put the batter into a piping bag and pipe them onto the baking sheet since they don't really change shape much during the baking process... and I also put the frosting into a ziplock bag, cut off the tip then spiral the icing onto the cookies once they've cooled down. Makes them very pretty!!

Very good.  Easy to whip up, turned out beautifully.  I wasn't really able to flatten them slightly before putting them into the oven because the dough was sticky.  My yield was 29 cookies, so I guess I made them a bit big, but still only baked them for 16 minutes.  Yum!

The recipe called for all purpose flour but i adjusted for whole wheat flour (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp of wheat flour = 1 cup all purpose) just to make it a bit more healthy.  THEY ARE FABULOUS!!! So much flavor, YUMMM!! Thank you for sharing this :)

These cookies are great! You don't even need the frosting! I needed a dessert, had nothing in the house but a can of pumpkin and everyone loved these. Since I didn't have enough ingredients for the frosting, I sprinkled the cookies with sugar and they turned out amazing! Thank you : )

I just finished making these... I never wrote a review before. I don't even care that much for pumpkin. These are absolutely divine!. I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of using a bit less flour maybe 2.25 cups instead of 2.5 cups. I only used 1/4 tsp of cloves and increased the cinnamon just a bit to 2.25 tsp. I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also used a whole can of pumpkin. I baked for 12 minutes. Within the 3 minutes of writing this review my girls have pretty much devoured the first batch. Oh for the glaze, I ended up using 5 tablespoons of milk and everything else was the same. Delicious!!

Made these several times over the holiday season and they never last long.  Sometimes I use maple syrup in place of milk in the icing.  They are very soft and cake-like.  Love 'em.

Not bad.  Did not make icing and the cookie was addicting.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Nice pumpkin taste....almost like a pumpkin pie.  Texture was not like a cookie...more like a cake.

These cookies were very good. I love everything pumpkin so this was right up my alley. I guess the only thing I was not thrilled about was the cakey texture; I wish they were just a little more cookie-like. Out of the oven they were quite good but around a day or two later they just weren't as good as leftover cookies. Maybe next time I will add a little less flour.

These are a new family favorite at my house.  They're so moist and delicious.  I over-baked one pan, but because they seem to draw moisture from the frosting, they softened up nicely.  So easy to make, so easy to eat.  Delicious with a cup of hot coffee!

Very good.  I made these for Christmas guests and they were eaten up.  All the kids commented on how good they were.  I prepared the recipe as written and didn't have any trouble with it.  I did follow another reviewers suggestion and didn't store in an airtight container.  They will sweat if you do.  Great recipe thanks!

Turned out perfectly: the cookies are light, sort of cake-like.  I frosted about 2/3 of them and left the remaining third for people who don't like frosting.  The frosting had a few lumps in it: I will try whisking the milk into the sugar next time.

Don't change a thing when you make this- it turns out fantastic. Just be advised that when you go to form the cookies on the baking sheet it'll be the consistency of chewing gum. Not the easiest to shape, but as good as these taste who cares how they look :)

These are amazing & delicious like everyone says. I had friends & family agree & ask/beg/demand for more to be made! On my 2nd time, I decided to make the glaze maple by adding maple extract rather than vanilla to the glaze ingredients. This was a wise & delicious choice--it tasted just like maple candy (New England-er here)! Then I dusted the glaze, whilst sticky, with cinnamon which, for me, helped balance the sweetness wonderfully as I do find most confectioner sugar glazes too sweet for my teeth. But these cookies are a definite winner & permanent member of my recipe box!

These were very good cookies.  I had never made pumpkin cookies before so I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies were very thick and "bready".  They are excellent with coffee and my kids actually ate them for breakfast (and I figure they aren't any worse then donuts/cinnamon rolls/etc).

Oh my, these are some yummy cookies! I used whole wheat flour and didn't have a can of pumpkin so I used a box of pumpkin pie filling. I thought that perhaps the added spices from the pumpkin pie filling might overpower, but they taste so good. I made the icing, but added a little light corn syrup to make the icing shiny. I think this is a new staple during the holidays!

I am NOT a fan of pumpkin pie so whatever possessed me to make this is beyond me.  Made it just as written (except for adding cinnamon to the icing, as previously suggested).  I was all prepared to think these were "okay", but, holy cow, were these good!  They were moist, not overly sweet, not overly pumpkin-y (yea, for me!!).  Very good cookie and a nice change from our good ol' chocolate chip.

Yummy and simple to make. Soft cookies are the best and these are nice and soft. I read other reviews and did 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar, I also used one can of pumpkin. I only baked for 8-9 minutes and they came out perfect.

These turned out very good! I put a little more vanilla than the recipe called for and instead of all white sugar, I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar like some of the reviews said, very yummy! These cookies are soft and cake-like not so much like a crunchy cookie, but that didn't bother me at all. We loved them! :)

I made Gluten Free by substituting wheat fl for gluten free flower & adding just over 1/2 tsp of xathan gum. I also used 1 cp of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Think i'll add walnuts next time.

This was a good cookie. May add a touch more spices next time since the flavor was a little light. Icing is a must! They were easy enough to whip together, super moist, however I would prefer a crunchier cookie.

Just made these. Delicious! I replaced the egg with banana when I found my last egg to be cracked! But the recipe still turned out beautifully. I topped some with a couple butterscotch chips, also turned out well. Had to leave them in the oven a few more minutes though. I have a new favourite winter dessert :)

I tried this recipe last night and it was really good! the cookies turned out perfectly cooked. the only thing that i didnt like was the glaze. I made the glaze and tried it and didnt think it was great so instead i made a cream cheese frosting. so other than the glaze it was awesome and i brung some in for people in school and everyone loved the cookies and they want me to bring in more goodies more often. this will be where i get all the recipes 2!

Good. I made the recipe as written. 

Unfortunately for me, the pumpkin taste wasn't as pronounced as I'd hoped. They tasted like more of a spice cookie. My husband detests pumpkin, so he really liked the cookies. The texture and the icing were both very satisfying. I just wish they had a stronger pumpkin taste.

I made this as a dessert for a Thanksgiving Party and I was meeting everyone for the first time. Lets just say I made new friends.(;
I also made some for my co-workers. I ended up having none to take home, and I also doubled the batch! Great recipe!

This was very tasty and not too sweet.  My guests loved it.  After it's baked it's best if you leave it uncovered otherwise it gets too moist.

This is the 2nd recipe I have tried for pumpkin cookies and this one is even better than the 1st one! They are firmer but moist and really good with the icing drizzle! I doubled the spices, did half brown sugar and half white sugar, used half whole wheat flour and half white flour...and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon/sugar mix before baking....WONDERFUL!....thanks for sharing :)

Amazing! Great recipe!  Really moist and yummy. They are eaten up as soon as they are done!!
  I changed a couple of things for our family. 

1 1/2 C Flour
1 C Almond Flour
1 1/2 t Cinnamon
1/2 t Ginger - This really makes taste more flavorful.

These were fantastic.  I left out the cloves (didn't have them on hand) and included cinnamon in the icing.  I could eat that icing straight from the bowl.

Light, moist, and not over powering. Good as a morning afternoon and nighttime treat. Just enough spice to know its there, not as bland as some people are saying, they must not have very good pallets.

Very yummy! I made them for Thanksgiving and the family devoured them!  The only adjustment I did was use 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

I used the whole can of pumpkin puree, 1 cup white and 1/2 brown sugar, substituted applesauce for butter and added cinnamon and 1/2 of a cream cheese to the icing also used a white wheat flour.

These cookies are great!! I was nervous to try to bake a 'pumpkin cookie' because I didn't want them to turn out too dense, hard, or cakey. I added a lot more spices than the recipe called for though and I think they came out just right. I think that if I had followed the recipe exactly, the cookies would have been bland  (hence 4 stars and not 5). Overall a great recipe and easy to adjust to fit your personal taste!

Pretty good if you want a soft, cake-y cookie. I would make them in advance of use, though, because I found that the spices settled in better after leaving them overnight.

Delicious cake-like cookies. I found that if you refridgerate the dough in between batches it is a little less sticky and easier to work with. I also dipped the back of a spoon in flour to flatten the cookies.

I have made this cookie recipe four time in the last month. It makes a TON of cookies, does not call for a crazy amount of ingredients and turns out delicious!! I like to make these and share them with any one I can. I love the cake like quality to them. I choose to leave the icing off because it always just tastes weird . . . ?

LOVE THESE, GREAT WITH COFFEE

I made this recipe as is and they were a HIT.. I think i might have added a touch more cinnamon, cuz well.. ITS CINNAMON why not! They were a hit!  

I did flavor up the icing a bit with more spice to give it that little extra something...
Thanks very much for this share.

These were an awesome holiday treat. Everyone loved them and they kept their shape once baked so they were like muffin tops. I'm definitely saving this recipe! My only criticism was that they needed more spices. I about doubled all the spices, added more pumpkin, and doubled the vanilla extract as well. It was delicious once I did that!

My family loved these cookies. We spread pumpkin spice cream cheese on them, instead of icing. I also liked them plain. I will be making another batch (or two) for Thanksgiving!

I made these and love them. I did take the advise of another reviewer and used just 1 cup of the white sugar and used 1/2 c of brown sugar. Also, I added 1/2 tsp. of ginger. I also used fresh pureed pumpkin instead of canned. I baked the first batch for 15 minutes and the second for 10 minutes. the ones that baked for the shorter time were more dense. I personally, liked the ones that baked longer, although my 4 yr. old liked them both ways.. a keeper that I will definatly be making plenty more times.

These are a family favorite (and I didn't have the ground cloves) and I have a picky family!   Though we do't have trouble in my family eating them right away I wonder if I can freeze them to enjoy for a longer period of time? ;)

These are yummy.  I cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 cup of instant oatmeal. I also added ginger to the recipe.  I love spices.  This added a little extra spice and made them really flavorful.

These were really great! They were subtly spiced and and perfectly sweet with cream cheese icing. We shared them with the neighbors and the only few that were left out long enough did get a bit dry. Thanks for the great fall recipe!

I really like these cake-like pumpkin cookies.  And I had a day off work so went a little crazy (!) and tried several versions by adding different things to each batch: fresh cranberries, dried cranberries, chocolate chips, and walnuts.  I also tried regular and cream cheese frostings before passing around the family to test - the winners were the plain cookies (as per the original recipe) with cream cheese icing! (Although my personal favourite was plain icing with chopped walnuts, I was outvoted... guess it depends somewhat on personal preference!)

I just made these cookies which are awesome. I really didn't care for the icing though.  Of course, I thought it was too runny, so I added more sugar.  My goof, it was just too bland.  I loved the review where the lady took them to her friend's resturant and they used cream cheese.  I will have to try that.

Was looking for a nice pumpkin flavor cookie for fall. These cookies, while nice and flavorful, we're very cake like. Another reviewer said like a muffin top, which I tend to agree with. I have been baking for years so I don't believe I made any mistakes with the recipe its just not a cookie. More bread like in consistency.  I did however make a cream cheese icing and put it between two of the "cookies" and they make great whoopie pies!  Still looking for a great fall cookie though.

These cookies are awesome!  Soft and chewy, with a good amount of spices.  My family loves them!
Didn't change a thing - but was thinking it'd be interesting to make a whoopee pie-type of creation sans icing, and with cream cheese frosting in the middle.

These are delicious! They are great both with and without the glaze! Like other reviewers suggested, I may add a bit of cinnamon to the glaze next time and see how that turns out. But these are great exactly as written.

These cookies were awesome. I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar like others had mentioned and I did add 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. The cookies were moist and with the added frosting they were perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us.

I just made this recipe today for a Halloween party tomorrow.  I couldn't wait to try them after reading all of the good reviews, but I was very disappointed.  Like many of the other readers, I found these to be very bland, there was very little flavor. Also, I wouldn't really call these cookiers, they are more like a muffin top.  I used cream cheese icing sprinkled with cinnamon which improved the taste a little.  Probably will not make these again.

I doubled the recipe so I could use an entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin.  I used white whole wheat flour, 2 cups brown sugar and one cup white sugar, and Earth Balance instead of butter.  Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I baked the first batch for 12 minutes...but they were just a tad underdone, so I baked the rest for 13 minutes.  These are fabulous!  I don't think I'll even make the icing because they are so good by themselves, so why add unnecessary calories?

Great recipe - although, I did alter it a bit. I used real pumpkin instead of canned and a touch of brown sugar with the white sugar. For the icing I used low fat half 'n' half and added a dash of cinnamon like so many others have suggested. Then, for the last tray of cookies I mixed walnuts into the batter and those are my favorite cookies so far - the nuts add that little extra something to the taste and texture. I will for sure make these again. Super easy and the house smells like Fall!

These pumpkin cookies were amazing!  Make sure cookies are completely cooled before storing. If stacking cookies in container, I recommend adding a piece of parchment (wax) paper between each layer. 
I made a few substitutions:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour => 1 cup whole wheat flour & 1-1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1-1/2 cup white sugar => 3/4 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon baking soda => 1-1/4 tsp baking soda, 1 can pumpkin puree => 1 cup fresh pumpkin-baked at 350 degrees for 75 min & then cooled. Optional additions: 
1/2 cup raisins or 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips or 1/2 cup dried cranberries with orange peel. Hard to resist. You won't be disappointed!  :)

Amazing!  I make these at least twice every fall.  I've never had a cookie have such a fluffy cake-like texture.  They're just sweet enough with the glaze so as not to be overpowering.  Whenever I bring these cookies to a gathering, there are never any leftovers!  Another user said don't store them in an air-tight container and I agree!  There is so much moisture in these cookies that they will turn to mush. A foil-covered plate will store them just fine.

MAKE SURE You cook these all the way through... Unlike most cookies this is more of a cake consistancy ... but i seemed to be able to put them back in the oven even after they cooled a bit. I just wasn't as big of a fan as I thought I would be. I also used a different recipe for frosting because it sounded better. It was the carmel flavored frosting from the other highly rated pumpkin cookie. I believe that helped this cookie.

When I made the first batch I didn't love it.  I used pumpkin pie mix just to skip ingredients which was fine, but it said to bake for 15-20 mins which I thought was too long but I did anyway and it was hard and chewy.  I put the rest in the fridge then baked it the next day and I was surprised by how much better it tasted!  I'm not a fan of the glaze so I made cinnamon cream cheese which made it even more amazing!

Really good!  I used one cup white whole wheat flour.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because of the cooking time.

made this for the first time last year around the holidays.   It is amazing and I don't like pumpkin that much but can't put these down.  Have added chips as well for an extra sweet treat.  We do don't use the icing though for a slightly lesser sweet cookie.  This has been added to a family fav.

Healthied it up a bit: used 1/4 c  unsweetened applesauce w just 1T of butter. Used 3/4 c sugar, 1/4 c honey, 1 t molasses. Instead of drizzling, I dipped tops face down into glaze...less messy IMO. Thanks for the recipe, it was a crowd pleaser!

This was a really great recipe. I took other reviewers advice and added light brown sugar to the cookie mixture and cinnamon to the icing.

These cookies were such a success! I had tons of people asking me the recipe and when i could make more. I tweaked it myself - 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and i also added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. To the glaze i made it thick and added food coloring to make it orange and added a dash of cinnamon for flavor. Delicious!

These cookies are DELICIOUS! I am known for my cookies, and when I served these up at a dinner party recently, EVERYBODY raved about how they were the best cookies ever! A couple of people even said 'These are like pumpkin pie donuts!'. I will suggest two things: Allow the batter to chill overnight. The batter is a little sticky and soft, and the cookies will come out too flat. When completely chilled, it is more easily scooped and rolled into balls which can then be flattened out slightly. And as for the icing, I suggest that, rather than drizzling it, place the entire cookie upside down into the bowl of drizzle. Then lift it back out and allow any excess drizzle to fall off (or help it off with a butter knife, or by scraping the cookie on the side of the icing bowl). The cookies are more visually appealing with the white frosting, and they just taste better.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for to sell at our town's Pumpkinfest. I topped it off with an orange powdered sugar glaze and pumpkin shaped candy corns. I used a large scoop for my cookies and got 17. I baked them for 15 minutes in a 375 oven. They spread just fine without any pressing down. They don't stack well since they're so soft, but they do freeze well once they're baked, then you can stack them.

This is the softest cookie I have ever eaten/made! Soo delicious and simple. I drizzled cream cheese on top instead and added coconut flakes and it still tasted great! I brought them to a party and they were devoured!

They were ok. Could use a bit more flavour, and was more like a cake than a cookie.

These are amazing! I read the recipe wrong and added the milk to the cookie dough, and they STILL turned out great! I did use 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar and baked for only 12 minutes. They are a keeper for sure! Kids and husband raved!

These are soooooo good! I've made them 3 or 4 times and everyone loves them, even those who think they dislike pumpkin. The only change I make is using a cream cheese icing instead of the glaze. It's easy to make, just look up any highly rated recipe and smooth it on the cookies once they are cooled.

Baked these the other night, very nice cookie! Really enjoyable, I dont know if mine were baked a tad too long, not burnt by any means just lightly brown, but I would prefer them a tad bit moister. I will definately make again and watch my baking time. Excellent! Great with maple frosting or glaze.

I made these for Thanksgiving, a huge hit with my family!!! I did leave the cloves out ( I didn't have any) and they were still fabulous.  I did have to cut the cook time in half after only 10min of baking I could smell the bottoms starting to burn.  It may have been the fact that I was using brand new baking sheets.  These cookies are going to be a fall must have for my family for sure!

We loved these!  I made them for a road trip...the kids had half of them eaten right after they came out of the oven.  I froze the rest so we could take them on our trip later in the week.  My husband, who hates pumpkin, devoured them the first day.  :) They did freeze well, although I did not try the icing; I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar right out of the oven instead (we're not big icing fans).  I will be making these again and again.  My kids now ask for them first.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Super yum!

Easy and they do taste good, though not as fantastic as I hoped when I saw 2100 reviews! I used 1.5c whole wheat flour and 1c white flour, but otherwise followed the recipe. Ultimately, I like pumpkin chip muffins better, but as drop cookies, these seem easier.

These are the BEST pumpking cookies as is.  No tweeking necessary!  They're even great without the frosting.  Sometimes, If I'm feeling crazy, I'll put rasins in them.  Yummy!!!

I made these tonight and they were good. I liked them better a couple of hours after they cooled and with the frosting spread on them. They don't have as much pumpkin flavor as I expected so I'll try a couple other recipes.

Awesome!  I used closer to 1 t of the cloves & allspice & added in ~1 t of ginger for a stronger pumpkin spice taste.  I also used 1/2 c of white whole wheat flour which you couldn't even taste - could easily bump it up and use more whole wheat flour in this recipe!  I put a cream cheese frosting on top which was way better than a simple glaze would have been.  (Combine 1 8 oz brick reduced fat cream cheese w/ 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar).

I loved the easiness of this cookie. I added dried cranberries as well to half of the dough, for variety, and a tsp of pumpkin allspice instead of the cloves and nutmeg. I took some to both my neighbors and they loved them as well. thanks

I made these cookies without the glaze because I needed them to be easy to store on a family trip.  They are VERY good and I can't wait to try another batch with the glaze.  Be sure to follow a previous reviewer's advice and store them on the counter and not in a sealed container.  They stay very moist.

Used 1.5 cups fresh pumpkin and skipped the cloves since I didn't have them. Very good flavor, consistency and softness. Keeping this recipe!

Light, spicy and not too sweet. Very tasty and easy to make. I did as some others suggested, using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar. Also added some cinnamon and just a touch of nutmeg to the icing. I used a cookie scoop to put the the cookies on the baking sheet (which I covered with parchment) because the dough is a little sticky and not so firm. The cooking time was right on for me. I will make these yummy fall cookies all year round. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe with no changes, other than to dip the bottom of a glass in granulated sugar(since the dough is sticky) and then use it to flatten each cookie before baking.  They are FABULOUS!  I did end up with leftover glaze (a tablespoon or two).  I will definitely be making these again!  Thank you, Gina, for a terrific recipe.

For me, it wasn't spicy enough nor did it have enough pumpkin flavor.  A better recipe is Pumpkin Cookies V.  Only reason I didn't use that one is that I didn't have any shortening.

I LOVE these cookies!  One of my co-workers brought them to work about three years ago and I have been making them ever since.  I just made a batch of these, substituting things to make them dairy free, egg free and gluten free (Earth Balance butter, Hemp milk, Ener-G egg replacer and gluten free flour).  Surprisingly, they still turned out perfect!  I do add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing ingredients, though, it compliments the cookies!  Enjoy!

Amazing. Just amazing. Make them every year int he fall and they are everyone's favorite. I follow the recipe exactly, and only do a drizzle of icing because I think the icing makes them too sweet and takes away from the fall-y taste. Love them...thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I increased the sugar, pumpkin and spices, and omitted the frosting. So good!! I highly recommend making these easy to make but very scrumptious cookies.

Great recipe, especially with the minimal amount of fat consumed! The only thing is I would recommend that people put more rather than less frosting to really balance out the different tastes :)

I reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 1/2 bag of mini chocolate chips and omitted the icing. Baked for 15 minutes and these are beyond delicious. I can't imagine a better recipe!

These cookies are delicious! I made mine bigger, and they came out like a mix between soft cookie and muffin top. I made the icing like it suggested, but it was too sweet for me. Next time I'll skip it and just enjoy my plain little muffin top cookies warm out of the oven with a glass of milk!

Very delicious and easy. My 3 year old daughter and I made these and we both love them. I ate a couple without the icing, and I'm wondering if the cookies even need it; they are kind of perfect the way they are.

These were perfect to take to a party. My family tried them fresh out of the oven and recommended that I not ice them since they were already so sweet. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I left them out cooling overnight on the counter. They were moist and had a mild gingerbread flavor that both the kids and adults loved. I didn't shape the dough in any way, just plopped it in Tbs. on the cookie sheet. They spread out beautifully. I've never made such perfectly shaped cookies before!

Very good pumpkin cakes. For me they are not cookies , a bit to sweet, but very good. It is my first time making them and first batch came our too runny, then a TBS of flour made it perfect. Baked them for 10-12 min. Also made them as pumpkin cupcakes and it was a hit! Great recipe! Will keep.

Very simple to make and most of the ingredients are things I have right on hand. However, the cookies were good but tasted more like bread than a cookie. Just not sweet enough to call a cookie to me.

Love this recipe! I added raisins to the dough. (I always add a small amount of boiling water to the raisins and let them soak for 5 minutes before I use them, to soften them.) It added a nice sweet taste to the cookie. I will definitely be making these again!

Very tasty. More cake-like than cookies, but the flavor was there. My icing was pretty runny, so not as pretty as in the main picture. Prettier would make this 5-stars. It was so easy to make with the 1/2 can I had left after making a pumpkin pasta and sausage dish.

These were OK in my opinion.  Moist, soft, fluffy but a little bland.  Took them to work.  Everyone LOVED them.  I was so surprised. I will definitely make them again if I need a dish to pass.

perfect...it's one of those recipes you can add more and not compromise the cookie...I added a huge dollup more pumpkin, did the 1/2c brown/1c white sugar as others suggested, and added about 1c oatmeal for substance (and sneak those nutritional benefits into the cookie)- and I didn't use the frosting, they didnt need it...they turned out awesome - next time I'll add chocolate chips, more spices, etc as someone else suggested! thank you for submitting!

So awesome! I used margarine instead of butter which cuts the calories to 101 and the fat to 2 grams per serving. The flavor/texture is still out of this world delicious!

These are so yummy! I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar per previous reviews. I also substituted 1 1/4 cup pureed squash for the canned pumpkin and you can't tell the difference. These are great with either the iced frosting or cream cheese frosting.

I made these for the first time two years ago because I was making pumpkin cupcakes and had extra pumpkin puree left over and my word are they perfect.  I call them pumpkin scones instead of pumpkin cookies because they remind me far more of scones than cookies but everyone loves them.  My 5 year old daughter looks forward to them every fall now and whenever I bake them, since it's such a huge batch, I have lots of people asking for the extras.  Thank you for a perfect recipe.

I made these cookies last night for my teen daughters to take to a special lunch with their friends.  I can't comment on how well they store because all the cookies are gone!  Everyone loved them.  They have a soft, cake-like texture, aren't too sweet, and have just the right amount of spiciness.  Be prepared for a very soft dough - almost like a thick muffin batter.  Be sure to cool them thoroughly before frosting or else the heat from the cookies will turn the opaque white icing into a translucent glaze.  After frosting them, I let them sit overnight before stacking and covering them.  The icing was not sticky at all this morning and they packed and transported nicely.  The icing recipe made about twice as much as I needed - and I frosted the tops completely instead of drizzling the icing on.  I guess I'll have to make another batch of these delicious cookies to use up the extra icing!

Good recipe.  I am not a icing fan and these cookies taste great without it.  I also am a fan of using pumpkin pie spice which I always use more than recommended.  I will be making these again!

OK, these are awesome! The only changes I made were I used 2 cups light brown instead of 1 1/2 cups white sugar. Lso, I added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice and about 1/2 cup extra confectioners sugar to the glaze. Previous posters are correct about covering these...they are so moist that they turn to mush if you seal them. They need air. I made them about 9 hours prior to serving them and they are perfect.

The cookie itself was bland, even considering I was a bit heavy handed with the spices.  I will tweak the recipe and try again.

These are amazing! They sort of remind me of Starbucks' Pumpkin Scone, but much moister. I only used 1 cup of sugar (I ran out) and they are still wonderful. Thanks!

Delicious cookies! They are almost like baked doughnuts once they have been glazed. The only thing that I found was that 15 mins was the longest I would want to cook them - any longer and they would be hard.

This cookie is very good.  As is, its not too sweet so it could be eaten at breakfast time with a hot beverage. I did exchange 1/2 cup of white sugar for 1/2 cup of brown sugar, which made the creaming process a little long. I used a whole teaspoon of cinnamon and pumpkin spice rather than the other stuff.  If you do want it sweeter add more sugar.  
  I did not care for the icing at all.  I think the cookie is perfect without the icing. If you have a favorite icing recipe then use that instead of the one provide.  In addition, If you do use an icing keep the sugar the same amount or you will have a really really sweet cookie!

These cookies are baking right now and most of the first two trays are gone! I used 3/4 cups brown sugar and 3/4 cups white sugar instead of all white and added 1/2 tspn ginger. My husband is not much for icing so I skipped that but will try this recipe again with walnuts or pecans for a little texture. All in all a great recipe!

Instead of canned pumpkin I used 1 cup of fresh sugar pumpkin puree, I did not have enough cinnamon so I used allspice in its place.  I also added nutmeg and a little cinnamon to the icing.  AMAZING!!!  I can't stop eating these cookies.

Just made these and they are wonderful. I substituted half of the white sugar for light brown sugar. I also jazzed half of the batch up by adding butterscotch chips and pecans. Wow! The jazzed-up half is better. Keep in mind when making these that they're more on the hermit side (dome-shaped) rather than flat and cookie-like. I'm going to ice them right now.

These are absolutely WONDERFUL weather they are iced or not and they are so light and flavorful.  I iced half with the suggested icing and the other half I added molasses to the icing instead of vanilla.  
The dough is sticky to work with but if you use a cookie scoop your fine and to get the smooth tops I dampened my hand and lightly flattened and baked as usual.  YUMMY!

These cookies were a huge hit at the end-of-summer cookout I just got home from!  I subbed pumpkin spice in for the other spices and cooked for twelve minutes, which gave them extra moistness.  I also omitted the glaze, which I found to be way too sweet.  Overall, I expect to make this recipe several more times this fall, and many more in the years to come!

I think the reason some people were saying they are bland is because the amount of salt needs to be upped to a full teaspoon. And I am not a salt lover like most. 

I also used half brown sugar and half white AND added a heaping tablespoon of molasses. I decided to go with bread flour to make them more puffy too.

These cookies are so good!  I didn't make the glaze because I'm lactose intolerant but they didn't even need it!  The only change I made was instead of the cloves and nutmeg, I used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  And as a final note, I threw a few cinnamon chips on top.  SO good!

These were OK. They were very moist but they had more of a cake/muffin like texture rather than a cookie texture. I used reviewer suggestions and added half white sugar and half light brown sugar. They are great for fall and a wonderful aroma will fill your kitchen. However, I like my cookies to be cookies, crunchy on the outside soft on the inside!

These are really good! Like the other reviewers I doubled the sugar and cinnamon to dip the cookies in. For me it was easier and less messy to mix the sugar/cinnamon mixture in a ziplock bag and coat the cookie inside the bag.

I have made these with the icing and also have made them without the icing but added chocolate chips. Both recipes are fun for the holidays but I find I make this throughout the winter for my little boys who love pumpkin. Easy and delicious.

Truly an awesome cookie!!  I used 1 1/3 c. sugar instead of the 1 1/2 c. it called for in the recipe; and added orange zest and the juice of one orange.  Perfecto!

These cookies are perfect! They are soft, moist, and just sweet enough. It's nice that they're spicy and flavorful and not just really sugary. The glaze softens them nicely and makes them taste even better! Thanks for a satisfying, light cookie that is the perfect foil for the overly sugary and rich foods of this season!

I can't explain how incredibly amazing these cookies are.  I do not like pumpkin pie at all but these cookies are just amazing.  The combination of spices and consistency are wonderful.  We eat them for breakfast, like a muffin too because of the consistency.  I highly recommend this recipe, just as it is.  Oh, except I love putting dark chocolate (or white) in them!

I made these cookies a few days ago and everyone absolutely adored them. I made some for my roommates and ever since they have been begging me to make more. Also, I work at a shop with all older men and I like to bring them down cookies and stuff every once in a while and all of these cookies were gone in less than an hour. I did add a little bit of cinnamon to the icing as suggested and I am completely happy with the outcome. I would recommend these to anyone. Great Holiday Cookie!

I didn't have ground cloves on hand so I added 1 whole tsp of nutmeg instead. Wow, these are so Soft and delish! The glaze added a nice touch. I did have to add approx 1 extra Tbsp of milk to loosen it up a bit. Two thumbs up!

Hate to be a downer but we were not crazy about these. They tasted very much like a loaf of pumpkin bread but in little plops. Tasty but not a cookie.

Super good, I followed the recipe (maybe added a bit more vanilla and cinnamon and pecans :) and they came out superb! I was too lazy to make the icing and without it they were still the perfect cake/cookie!!!

these are the most amazing cookies I have every made.  The only change was I substituted the cloves with ginger (same amount) and for the glaze I used only the sugar and milk.  I made them for Thanksgiving and they were all gone in 10 minutes, then I made them the next day for my friends and they were all gone in even less time.  Even people who usually aren't cookie lovers love these cookies.

My mom used to make pumpkin cookies when I was little, but I couldnt find her recipe. This one was so much better. They are so soft and delicioius. I always use fresh pumpkin though. It makes a difference, trust me. :) The icing i found was a little too sweet, so i added a little bit of orange juice, and it tasted great. This is a very great recipe.

It's not even noon on Thanksgiving Day and I have eaten about 5 of these already...  I followed the recipe 100% and they're amazing.  I am not a frequent baker but I do love to when I can - I have no baking creativity or orginality - and these came out great with no alterations.  I only used the glaze on about half of the cookies - it's very sweet - and the cookies are yummy even without it.

These are great!  My only wish is that I doubled the recipe so that I had more.  I followed the recipe and it yielded 3 1/2 dozen cookies.  Oh except I didn't have ground clove but used 1/4 tsp of all spice in place of it.

Really wonderful! My teens and husband ate an entire batch in an evening. Vote was that they are best with icing, even if the kids didn't want to wait until the cookies were cool enough to frost.

These cookies are definitely addicting! I would have given it 5 stars, however, I found the dough consistency was too hard to work with if you wanted a visually appealing cookie as the end result. The only alterations I made were to add 1/4 more cup of pumpkin. Next time I might reduce the the flour by 1/2 cup and increase the eggs to 2. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing like other reviewers suggested and it was perfect! A suggestion to those of you who like the drizzled icing look- pour the icing in a ziploc baggie, and snip a tiny corner off. Drizzle away! (P.S.-if you don't want the drizzles to run together, definitely wait until the cookies have cooled completely!)

Exactly what I was going for!  They spread just enough and were done in 15 minutes.    I used to make these by adding pumpkin to a box of spice cake mix, but this way is better (butter!)  I altered the spices a little because I'm a little spice-crazy; I used 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp allspice, and reduced the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.

These were some of the best cookies I've ever had! I made half of them with chocolate chips and none of us could decide which we liked better. I ate a bunch before I made the icing and couldn't see how they could get any better but with it they were even better.

I loved this cookie. It was like having a mini muffin in a bite sized cookie. I did a few variations...added splenda instead of sugar and instead of the icing I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top and added raisins. Delectable!

Excellent version of classic pumpkin drop cookies!  I use maple extract in place of the vanilla (if you use Mapleine-brand extract cut the amount to 1/2 tsp as it is more concentrated than standard maple flavoring) and it gives it a creamy maple color and of course the flavor goes perfectly with pumpkin.

Cakelike texture was exactly what I was hoping it would be, but these really lacked in flavour! After taking out my first batch and tasting I added more cinnamon and some allspice and pumpkin seeds and was much more pleased with the results. The others are edible when smeared in cream cheese icing.

Love this recipe! Only thing I did differently was grate fresh nutmeg instead of ground nutmeg from the jar. This is now in my top ten for cookies! I'm bringing them to my sister's house for Thanksgiving!

They taste like wonderful little bites of pumpkin bread, they're so sweet and warm I simply love it. I do feel that the overly sweet / buttery taste of the glaze steals from the warm pumpkin taste. So next time I'll cut the glaze in half, so a third will have none, a third a ton, and a third just the slightest line.  I tried to use a stand mixer to cream the butter and sugar, but it didn't work too well, so next time I'll just skip the mixer and do it all by hand. Oh, and the glaze needed half the vanilla but more milk, you just had to sprinkle and check the consistency. And following a review I gave 5 shakes of cinnamon to the glaze and it was a fantastic idea.  15 minutes worked wonderfully, and using a cookie scooper was the best option to get exactly 36 that had a round top when cooked. And the scooper was a clean option since the dough is exceptionally sticky to the point that I considered refrigerating it for an hour (but the recipe didn't say to). I still haven't found a good way to flatten the dough once on the sheet. Anything used to flatten it sticks to the dough...  5 STARS!!!

Try sticking the dough in the freezer for fifteen or the fridge for an hour to make it less sticky perhaps.

These cookies are delicious! My dough was more the consistency of batter, so I didn't need to flatten them after I dropped the cookies. I made a double batch, and am so glad I dd!    If you are looking for a great pumpkin cookie recipe, this is the one to try!!

Cookies were moist and delicious. The cookie itself is not too sweet, but with the glaze I think it's the perfect amount of sweetness. Also the recipe for the glaze was enough to drizzle on top of a double batch of cookies. My husband, kids and co-workers all enjoyed these!

I've been making these cookies for years and they've become a signature cookie of mine. The original recipe is great but I've sometimes substituted cardomom for nutmeg and used vanilla icing and they are still fabulous.  Also, there are some people who like them without frosting so i do 50/50.

These are the most amazing cookies I've ever had, next to my mom's famous oatmeal butterscotch cookies. They are fluffy, perfectly balanced in flavor, and the icing just adds that touch of sweetness. Pair with a cold glass of milk and you're set.

Hmm, my husband & I didn't care for these. The texture was sort of odd? more cake like then cookie. The taste was pretty good but the icing was way too sweet. It made my teeth hurt. Maybe I will try them again but make a cream cheese icing instead.

Like reviewers stated this is a cake texture. If you are looking for a cookie texture this is not it.  But if you are OK with cake like "muffin" top texture this is it.  Tastes really good and will make again, but not if I want cookie texture.  Instead of the various seasoning I used pumpkin pie spice blend.  Be sure to wet fingers to help with flattening cookie.  For glaze I only needed half recipe.  Omitted butter and added pumpkin spice to it as well.  Really good...Enjoy Update: Next day actually like them less.  Don't think I'll make again.

These cookies are DELICIOUS - the only reason I gave it four stars is because I think they're much better with the addition of nuts and/or chocolate chips. I have also done a version with cranberries and those are fantastic as well. Be careful sealing them in a container - they are very moist cookies. I make these every fall for parties and they go very quickly. I prefer them without the glaze. This recipe also makes a TON of cookies, especially if you use a spoon to distribute the batter.

These are so delicious!!! I made them without the icing (I'm not really a fan of iced cookies). I also substitued unsweetened applesauce for the egg. The recipe made 4 dozen. Will make these again & again!!!

These cookies are delicious! They are soft and chewy, I would almost not call them a cookie, they are kind of more like a cross between the top of a cupcake and a cookie, haha! They will definitely be one of my fall cookie staples!  Great w/ coffee for breakfast, the only thing I might change next time is a little more of the spices, I like a little more of a pumpkin spice flavor- nothing against the original recipe, just personal preference.

I wish there were more stars to rate this, because 5 just doesn't do it!  These are a fantastic hit every time I make them!  The only change that I have made to the recipe is substituting an additional 1/2 tsp nutmeg (total of 1 tsp) and omitting the cloves altogether.  Fabulous!!

These tasted so good.  I made the cookie as written.  I did try to spread the dough a bit on the cookie sheet to get them to not be such big rounds.  I made the frosting only used almond flavoring.  YUM, YUM.

Yum.  These are awesome.  So moist and cakey.  The recipe makes about double as much frosting as I needed, so now I'm forced to make another batch of cookies. :)

Wicked Good!  Reminded me of the top of a muffin - you know "the good part".  Yes it is more cake like, but delish.  The second batch I made - used no drizzle icing.  Not as sweet, but perfect with a bit of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream between 2 cookies.  I'm drooling as I type - it was that good!  You won't be disappointed in these if you make them knowing they are more cakelike.

Love this! Tried it and they turned out wonderful. I did do the adjustment that was suggested for 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I also didn't have nutmeg so I just used Cinnamon. Turned out great!! Thank you!!

Absolutely amazing!  They were even better the next day.  I love the cake like texture, and the amount of spices was perfect - followed the recipe to a  t.  My husband, who is picky, said this is his favorite out of all the desserts I've ever made, and that is a lot!!  Will definitely make again, probably around Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Absolutely heavenly! Imagine biting into an autumn cloud... may sound weird, but these cookies are SOFT and pillowy and contain every wonderful fall flavor. The texture is like muffin tops more than cookies. AMAZING!!!!!  Today is the 2nd time I've made these cookies. The first time, I made the icing and it's super-sugary. I'm not making it this time. The cookies are fantastic w/o the icing (and that's the way I prefer them).  For extra zing, sprinkle in a little ground ginger. Sprinkle the tops with extra cinnamon :)  MUST MAKE!!!

I liked the overall taste, but these cookies came out bready and felt more like mini pumpkin breads. Also as a health and fitness freak, I felt there was way too much sugar. I used only 1/2 cup and this preserved the taste of pumpkin and spices rather than just pure sugar.

I took this to a fall themed baby shower and a church event. I've never had so many people tell me how good something was. I think it would be great as written but I used 1/2 cp of brown sugar for 1/2 cp of the white and slightly changed the spices - 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg (no change there) and just 1/4 tsp of cloves because they can be overwhelming. The glaze was wonderful and gave a perfect finish. For those who had issues with this recipe - I fluff then measure flour, leveling the cup with a knife, beat the butter and sugar for a couple of minutes, then also beat the mixture for a couple of minutes after adding the egg, pumpkin and vanilla. This gave it a perfect texture. I flattened and smoothed the cookies before baking for a nicer looking final result.

I haven't tried them with the icing, but without they are to die for! =) Just make sure not to put them away warm or they get soggy.  I found that out while in a hurry to get to work, oops!

I decided to make these cookies to use fresh left over pumpkin puree.  I followed the recipe to the letter and like a fellow reviewer above added 1 teaspoon of all spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. When I dropped them by the tablespoon unto the cookie sheet and baked them, they came out bumpy and unattractive--like rock cakes! But the taste was incredible! Moist, delicious and supurb! I also placed the dough in the fridge for 2 hours to firm the dough up. I give it four stars only because I was disappointed in the appearence of my cookies, but this was probably down to my dropping the cookies by tablespoons and not flattening them out! But it was impossible to flatten as drop cookie dough is sticky!

Just OK.  Made exactly to recipe and they don't do much for our pumpkin loving family.  Just Ok even with the cream cheese frosting.

Decent cookie.  Not the best I've ever made, but my daughter likes them and that is what really matters.  I probably will try a different recipe next time, as these just don't kick it up for me.

Perfect pumpkin cookie.  I frosted some and left some plain and both ways are delicious.  I used a small melon scoop for the dough and baked exactly 16 minutes.  The cookies came out perfect and were very moist!!

These are one of my favorite cookies.  The dough is sticky, so I use a cookie scoop to get them on the cookie tray. I also make my own icing with a mixture of powdered sugar(2cups), water (2tbsp+), cinnamon (2tsp) and vanilla (1tsp).

My first time trying pumpkin cookies.. they are delicious, and easy to make, they stay moist and they rise up nice and high.  They were a hit at Thanksgiving dinner, and even those who said they don't like pumpkin ate them, and even took some home!

SO GOOD! very cakey, which i like, and SO delicious. i probably threw a few extra pinch of each of the spices in, but other than that didn't change a thing. and the gloss is absolutely perfect - took 15 seconds to make and really made the cookes something special.

OMG I am in love with these cookies. I made as directed and they were perfect!  Well, I lie.  In the middle of icing the cookies I added a dash of cinnamon to the icing just as an experiment and they were YUMMY!

I usually love cakey cookies, but this was even too much for me.  It was fluffy and soft, but dry, it wasn't moist at all. I had to bake it around 16 minutes in my oven, or else the inside of the cookie was too dough-y.

Great flavor.  I love a good spiced cookie, so I added almost double the spice (I also did with normal the amount and "pumpkin pie filling" which is already pre spiced) Cream cheese icing.  Awesome.

I really liked this recipe.  I found that it did need the icing and I did add some cinnamon to the icing since a reviewer had suggested that.  I didn't have cloves so I used 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and I found the spice just perfect.  One word of advice, if you want to double this recipe do not make it all at once.  It's way too hard to mix after.  Just make one batch and then make another batch.  Other than that, these cookies are very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! 15 mins was too long in my oven and the first batch were burnt on the bottom, but you couldn't tell; they were still so good! I dipped mine upside down in the glaze. The batter is sticky to work with, but they are delish!!

These cookies are very good.  Didn't care for the glaze as it was much too sweet.  Instead, try adding some Redi-whip or cool whip to the top just before eating one as it tastes just like pumpkin pie.

These cookies are a great pumpkin treat!  They are light and cake-like.  The only thing I did different was I added 1/2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice to it, just to give it more of a pumpkin pie taste.  When they first came out of the oven, they didn't taste very sweet so I didn't think this recipe was a good one, but if you just let them sit for a while, even over night, the flavor is SO MUCH better.  I gave some to my neighbor and she said the same thing: they are even better the next day.  I will definitely be making these again!  Oh, and I dropped my cookies on the cookie sheet by the ice cream scoop-full and it made about 15 cookies.  They were way bigger than a normal cookie, but it's the perfect size for your pumpkin craving!

Just finished making these cookies and they taste fabulous! Easy to make too! They will be a hit with anyone! Instead of drizzling the icing I turned the cookie upside down and dripped it in the icing.

There are a great autumn cookies. I followed the recipe for the cookie exactly. The baking time was too long for my oven (burnt the bottoms @ 15 minuets) so I cut it to 13 minuets and they were perfectly perfect. I did use a cream cheese frosting. ^_^

These were sooooo good! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added chocolate chips... cause everything is better which chocolate chips, right?! They are very "cakey" cookies which I love. If you like pumpkin bread, you'll love these!

At first I added too much pumpkin and had to balance that out, but this recipe looks, smells, and tastes like autumn. They are definitely now at the top of my cookie list for fall.

Great flavor. More of a muffin texture than a cookie. Perfect for fall!

These are SO good!  I've made at least 10 batches of these in the past 2 months.  Everyone loves them.  I haven't tried them iced yet but I have tried substituting apple butter for the pumpkin to see how they would taste.  YUM!  Both versions are keepers!

These cookies are fabulous!  My 4 year old had so much fun baking them with me.  I used some Kuri squash that I raised this year along with some sweet potatoes that I pureed.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp. of cardamom spice.  I think they will be gone before I can even make the icing! Use parchment paper for easy removal and clean-up!

I have made these about 3 times and they turn out wonderful each and every time. My only recommendation is to half the icing part because I always end up with wayy too much icing for my cookies and don't know what else to do with it. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe with us.

This recipe was AWESOME. My family is already requesting it for the holidays. I would make several batches of it and they would be gone in a couple of days. Even the family members who dont really like sweets want some. I used a  real pie pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin. I would strongly recommend this recipe to anyone

Love this recipe but like other's I changed a few things myself....I used fresh pumpkin, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, pumpkin pie spice, cin. and cloves....I also used a caramel drizzle rather then the glaze....1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/8cup con. sugar, 4 caramel squares, 1/4 cup butter, bring to a boil and drizzle away...It makes for a very rich, gooey, cake like cookie....Lots of fun!

I absolutely LOVE these cookies!  I made them for the first time last year for a group of friends and they have not stopped talking about them since!  They are so light and fluffy they remind me of pumpkin cupcakes but in cookie form!  I can't wait to make them again this year!

These little cakes are awesome and everyone at the Bake Sale went nuts! And yes, its more like cake than cookie. I used pumpkin spice instead of the cin, nutmeg, cloves and they came out great. The icing didn't work for me so I just dusted them with powered sugar and it worked great! Just dont leave them in an airtight container, they get sticky. Love love love them!

Fantastic recipe.  I halved the recipe (still used 1 egg), did not double the spices, added pecans and thought it was divine with or without icing.  I added an orange icing (3/4 c. confectioners sugar and 1 tablespoon orange juice) and it put the cookie into "heaven".  Thanks for sharing!

I NEVER bake, but I'm growing sugar pumpkins and needed some ideas on what to make out of them. The cookies were good and I doubled the amount of cinnamon, but they could have still used a little more "kick". I also added cinnamon to the frosting. Next time I'm going to double all the spices. My co-workers LOVEd them though! Great moist cookie!

These are so YUMMY! I just picked my first pumpkin of the year from my garden and I made these from fresh pumpkin puree. Turned out great, my husband loves them. I didn't use the glaze because I had icing already in the fridge. Next time I will try with cream cheese icing.

I have been looking for a recipe similar to the cookies i use to eat at a local cafe that closed down a few years ago. These cookies were good, but they were to heavy on the spices for me. I'd rather something more pumpkin flavored than spiced.

As a college student who enjoys baking, I have a very willing test crowd for new recipes.  This one was a favorite--despite scaling up the recipe for 1 3/4 c. pumpkin (1 can), the cookies were gone within the first few hours.  Delicious!

This cookie is amazing! It's more of a scone texture, which my family loves. We make it all the time mostly around 
Thanksgiving and Christmas! :)

These were very good!  Not quite enough pumpkin flavor for me, but I like my pumpkin cookies really pumpkiny.  I would definitely make these again, maybe adding just a tad more pumpkin.

This recipe is definitely a "keeper".  I don't care for cloves so I substituted with pumpkin pie spice.  Also frosted them with canned cream cheese frosting to save time, which was excellent.  If you like pumpkin you will not be able to settle for just one cookie.

These cookies are fantastic!  I have made them several times and found that it works best to cut back on the flour by 1/4 to 1/2 cup and add more spices.  I'm not an icing person so I usually omit that part.

These were really great.  Cook time was closer to 12 minutes for my oven which I think is right on for temperature.  First time, I'd time for 10 minutes and gauge from.  I'm going to try a little maple syrup in the glaze next time to see if that adds anything.

OOOOHHHH SO GOOD!  I had a small amount of leftover pumpkin to use so I whipped these up (1/2 recipe) and LOVE THEM!  I used self rising flour and omitted the baking powder, soda and salt, and used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (would be 4 for whole recipe) instead of the other spices. YUMMY!  I will make again and again!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these cookies!  I've been making them for about 3 years now.  Very moist, fragrant, and irresistible. They make the house smell delicious.  I always make double batches so I have enough to give to the girls at work - they always ask for (actually, they demand) them!  My 1-year-old son loves these, but he eats everything.  My almost-4-year-old niece, who is the pickiest eater on the planet, loves these too!  It makes me feel like a super-aunt for sneaking something healthy into her diet.  She especially loves them with the icing, which she likes to tint with food coloring.  **Note, a couple of times when I made these I didn't have ground cloves so I left it out,  and they were still yummy!

I really loved these cookies. I used maple flavoring for the frosting and it is also yummy. The frosting gets firm on the outside but stays kinda creamy on the inside. Next time I might make the cookines with choc. chips too.

Fabulous.  Soft and delicious and EASY.  Added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the frosting, which I think really added something.  Will definitely make again.

We make these every year for 'Santa' cookies.  My kids would not allow a Christmas to go by without them, they are the number one family favorite for the holidays, and they do not last long, so doubling the batch is definitely recommended :-).

Oh my goodness were these DELICIOUS!!!  I used homemade pumpkin puree and, because of previous experience, I knew it would be a little more watery than canned pumpkin, so I used about 1/3 cup more flour to compensate.  The cookies came out beautifully after 16 minutes.  I immediately took the cookies off the baking tray (but still on the tinfoil I baked them on) to let them cool and finish setting.  I only made about 1/2 the glaze and drizzled it on half the cookies because the flavor of the cookies was so wonderful that the added sweetness just wasn't necessary for my taste.  This is definitely a moist, cake-like cookie with a wonderful, subtle pumpkin-pie flavor!!!  Great with coffee!

These are pretty good.  They have a nice pumpking flavor, but they're pretty mild in the spice department.  Although they are cakey (almost like pumpkin bread in cookie form,) I thought they were just a tad bit dry in spite of trying out different baking times.

These truly are delicious.  I made them a couple of years ago and again this year (three times so far this season), but I'm having a problem... the last batch that I put on the cookie sheet stays too mushy- no matter how long I cook them.  This has happened each time this year.  This last time, both the second and the last sheet didn't really cook right.  What could be wrong?

Amazing! I subbed pumpkin butter from the local Farmer's market in place of the pumpkin puree and these cookies rule! Not to mention the icing is perfect! I used soy milk in place of the milk and it still worked wonderfully. Love these cookies, and everyone I fed them too did too. Did not last more than 2 days in my house!!!

Good flavor.  I took the advice of others and used a combination of brown and white sugar.  The texture was a little too soft for my liking but my BF thought they were great.  I did not use the glaze but added white chocolate chips instead.

Excellent recipe! They turned out so chewy and good. The cookie itself is not too sweet, so I dunked the whole tops of the cookies in the icing, and then took the leftover icing and mixed it with some brown sugar and cinnamon and drizzled that over the top to give them a nice festive look. Will definitely make these again!

EXCELLENT!  I've made these three weeks in a row, and the people at work LOVE them.  My two suggestions:  Instead of making cookies, make one huge bar cookie and cut up.  And, and add soaked raisins.  I did this the last time I made these, and they got even better reviews then the cookies themselves.  I made a double batch (with 1 cup soaked raisins) and baked all the dough in a 11x17 jelly roll pan.  I waited for it to cool, cut them with a pizza cutter, and frosted them individually, like I did the cookies.  They were a HUGE hit at work!

These are AMAZING! I didn't have ground cloves, but followed the rest of the recipe and they are perfect. I used a half batch of "Cream Cheese Frosting II" instead of the glaze. Both of these recipes are great and the flavors together are delish!

I followed the recipe almost exactly... I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  And the icing is a MUST for these cookies!  The cookies aren't super sweet, so they pair perfectly with the icing to give it great balance.  Will make over and over again!

I had a recipe like this in the past, and lost it, and I am SO grateful to have found one very similar to the one I had!!! Thanks so much for sharing!! I did a couple things a little differently...I added about a 1/2 a teaspoon more cinnamon, and about a 1/4 cup extra pumpkin and it turned out WONDERFULLY! Also, I added some chocolate chips too. Yum.

These cookies are FANTASTIC! I may have put in a tad bit more pumkin and spices, just taste the batter and you decide. I made these twice. Once with frosting and once without. Both times they were devoured and I've had people beg for more!

Every time I make these, they are a huge hit.  I usually add chopped walnuts to at least half the batch.  The walnuts really kick it up a notch!  I made some for Thanksgiving this year and they were gobbled up while the pumpkin pie was left sitting!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  My kids and I loved these cookies.  My husband thought they were only pretty good, but he is not much of a cloves and nutmeg fan.  My 8-year-old daughter said these cookies were some of her favorite cookies ever tried.

These are awesome! Used brown and white sugar rather then all white and used 3 tsp home made pumpkin spice rather then the spices called for. I also added 1 tsp pumpkin spice to the icing to add a little something. Sooooo yummy!

I liked these cookies right out of the oven and LOVED them the next morning when they were more moist. My husband ate half of them before I had a chance to frost them. He as already asked me to bake more. I may try some almond extract in the icing next time instead of vanilla.

These were delicious. The reviewer was right about not putting them in an air tight container. I left them out on the counter. They don't have a long shelf life, so eat them quickily, which isn't a problem because they were delicious!

I'm a pumpkin lover from long ago! My favorite growing-up recipe from childhood was my Mom's FABULOUS Pumpkin Chiffon Pie, like no other in the world, the BEST! I'll post it when I have time! But these good cookies will be part of my Christmas gifts, along w/many baked quickbreads of different flavors, pumpkin/choc.chip among others etc., muffins, mixes-in-a-jar, hot cocoa mixes etc.   Happy Holidays to all!!

These were really good! For some reason I was craving pumpkin the day after Thanksgiving and wanted to try something different. I only had 1/2 cup of white sugar so used 1 cup of light brown. I also used 2t of pumpkin pie spice in place of the 1/2t nutmeg and 1/2 cloves. I didn't ice these and my kids (and myself) gobbled these up.

super yummy...great with coffee.  I didn't have the patience for the frosting, but I bet it'd be great for a more sweet cookie taste....these were more like muffin tops.

The cookie dough was a good indication that the finished product was going to be yummy !I luv pumpkin. I used my pumpkin pie filling that I canned earlier .The spices that were already in the puree was a bonus ,didn't have to add any spices .I'll have to can more pumpkin next year just for these cookies..Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good cookie, it had a moist cake-like texture to it.  Next time I'm going to follow the suggestions from the reviewers because I found the icing too sweet.

Very good!  To make it healthier I used half whole wheat and half white flour as well as a stick of light butter instead of regular.  I subbed brown sugar for half the white.  For the glaze I added cinnamon and some maple extract.  Well enjoyed!

These were so good. They were soft and moist on the inside. The only complaint was that the icing did not stay on the cookies, it dribbled off. I would make a divot hole in the cookies next time so that the icing stays on the top.

Oh my!  This is a great recipe.  I followed it to a "T". First of all, I baked them for a church lunch.  After I tasted them, I wasn't sure they were going to make it to the church! At the church, it was the most requested dessert.  Making this one again for sure!!

these cookies were great.  they were a hit too.  everyone wants more.  i dont get everyone saying they had no flavor.  u MUST taste as u make the batter.  i added a 1/4 more pumpkin and i put cinnamon in the icing.  the were delicious.  i think if they came out flavorless for some that it is easy to rectify if u adjust the flavorings.  also they were just fine 2 days later.  i left some uncovered and some in ziploc and they were both fine.  the ones left uncovered were just a little harder on the outside, but still very cakey inside.  try this recipe if u love pumpkin!

These are great cookies!  The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 Cup butter flavored shortning plus 3 TBSP. of water instead of the 1/2 Cup butter for less saturated fat.  The cookies came out light and fluffy.  I thinned the glaze out so not to have too much on the cookies.  Perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these to use up the remaining fresh pumpkin that I had on hand. I have made so many pumpkin(ish) things this fall so far. These were good, even though I didn't use the the "drizzle". I did add some white chocolate chips and Reeses baking pieces. I added them (just pressed them in) before baking. Yum! Next time, I want to try the drizzle, as it also sounds yummy. My way was great too!

Delicious and not all that sweet which is a plus.  Found inverting the slightly cooled cookies and swirling the tops in warm icing worked better than drizzling but just a personal preference to reduce the mess.

DE-LI-CIOUS! I made this recipe exactly the way it was written (except without the cloves because I didn't have any on hand) and it came out amazing! I would say it tastes similar to mini glazed pumpkin doughnuts! I will definitely make this again and again!

I love this recipe and so does my family!  I used 1 c whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup of oat flakes.  This makes them heartier and chewy.  Yum!  The love them right out of the oven with out the icing.  Enjoy!

These are awesome!  I added a little more of the spices than used in the recipe and I added cinnamon to the glaze. Will make again and again!

A-MAZING!!!  I just made them an hour ago and I've already eaten 7... no wait, 8!  Oh, and one little tip... don't try the dough after you mix it b/c you wont have any left to cook!  I skipped the suggested icing and instead spread the top with a mix of melted Hershey's dark chocolate chips and Hershey's new pumpkin spice Kisses.  I thought the melted chocolate/pumpkin spice mixture was truly delicous with the cookies.

I thought these came out very good. I followed the recipe to the letter. I saw several complaints that the batter was too sticky and hard to manage. I used a 1 tablespoon cookie drop which I sprayed with nonstick cooking spray to drop the cookies. If you don't have a cookie drop, now is the time to buy one. I also used parchment paper. I didn't flatten the dropped cookies as they spread just enough while baking. You can experiment with the icing. Good recipe.

I wasn't sure how I would like these, but they were very good!! The batter have a very doughy consistency and wasn't the easiest to get into "pretty" looking cookies, but they tasted amazing! I used 1/4 tsp Allspice instead of the cloves, since I can't even stand the smell of cloves for some reason... no one seemed to notice! The icing/glaze was a really nice touch!

Two changes- I used slightly more spice than what was called for and added in chocolate chips which turned it into exactly the taste of a recipe I was trying to replace.  Sealed in a tin, these stayed completely fresh and moist for the week it took from them to be gone.

Great, spicy, different, soft and good looking cookies. My brother loved them, kept eating them non-stop. However my friend didnt like them... I guess its not for everyone. But I will defiantly bake those again.

I thought these were pretty good. I did however think they had a cake like consistancy rather a cookie one. If you want to make them a bit more spicier, try adding 1 tea cinnamon, 1/8 tea nutmeg, 1/2 tea ginger, and 1/2 tea ground cloves to 1/2 the icing. paint on the recipes icing, then drizzle the spicire icing-its really great!

These cookies were a huge hit at my party. I liked the cookies better with out icing but everyone else liked them with the icing. Just the right amount of softness but still firm enough to pick up. I will make these again for sure!

I am an early childhood teacher.  We made these in class today.  The children loved them.  We made them into a bar instead of cookies- just used a jelly roll pan.  We also frosted them with a little cream cheese frosting.  The children wanted seconds!  Now all the staff want the recipe too.  Great recipe.

Excellent cookies!  My 2 best critics (my kids) rated them for me and I agree.  I used cream cheese frosting, as it is my fav.  I'll try the icing next time.  I did use the 1/2 cup brown sugar as recommended because it made sense for flavors' sake.

I just made these cookies over the weekend and I needed to bring them to work, it was very hard to get them out of the house and not leave any behind. I think I made them a little bit smaller than what the recipe called for but I made 48 cookies total.  I used Pumpkin pie spice as the only spice and it came out wonderful.  I can't wait o make them again, what a great treat in  the fall.

These were very good and easy to make. My husband and 15-month-old daughter loved them. I added Walnuts which really made the cookies excellent! Instead of the glaze recommended, I made a caramel glaze, which was very good with the spicy cookies. Next time, I think I will try the suggestion of substituting brown sugar for some of the white sugar and also may add some ginger to make it more like the spices I use for pumpkin pie. May try cream cheese Icing, too. This recipe is a keeper!!

These were very good if you like a cakey cookie. They taste almost identical to pumpkin bars, just in cookie shape and minus the cream cheese frosting. Personally I was hoping for a normal cookie consistancy with a pumpkin bar flavor.

I love pumpkin so I was excited to try this recipe. The cookies turned out great, very soft and just the right amount of spice. The frosting is very easy to make but the cookies are great with or without it!

FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using pumpkin pie spice in place of the nutmeg & cloves. The icing was perfect for the flavor of the cookie. This recipe is a keeper!

Stick to the recipe! Maybe a little more spice is needed, but the flour and pumpkin amounts are perfect. For the first batch, i followed the recipe exactly and the texture was great. For the second batch, I tried to get a little more flavor by adding more pumpkin (1/4C) and just enough flour to hold it together. They turned out awful! Too dense and not cakelike at all.  I was amazed at the difference between the two batches.

This recipe is very easy to make.  My husband loved them!  The icing was way to sweet for me.  the next time I'll use a cream cheese icing.  I think that will send this recipe over the top.

Very tasty cookies. You definitely need the glaze to make the pumpkin cookies sweet enough. For my second batch I added craisins, and liked them even better.

These cookies came out perfect.  I made both the cream cheese frosting and the icing included with this recipe and they were both good.  These are like mini pumpkin cakes.  I think next time I'll try the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and use part white and part brown sugar.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made these for a Halloween treat for the family. I followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing. These cookies are moist and delicious. They didn't last long ... even the grandchildren loved them ... spices and all. Will probably make another batch for Thanksgiving and maybe another for Christmas. YUMMY !!!

Wow!  These are fantastic!  Thanks for sharing these delicious seasonal cookies.  I added some chocolate and cinnamon chips and used mostly whole wheat flour.  I also substituted 1/2 light brown sugar for 1/2 cup white sugar.  So tasty I didn't bother with the frosting.

I made these with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and about 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree, and they turned out amazing!  They are very cake-like and moist, my favorite kind of cookie.  I also added 1 oz of cream cheese to the frosting.

These were so good.  I made them because I needed something that made if feel like fall.  I don't care for pumpkin things very much but these were fantastic.  I took them to work and everyone raved about them.

These cookies are amazing!!  I had another pumpkin cookie recipe (a family recipe) that  I had always made.  But, now I'm starting a new family recipe and it's this one!!!  The cookies bake up so fluffy, soft and moist.  And the icing complements them wonderfully!  I did use the   1 1/2 tsps. of cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsps. of pumpkin pie spice because that's what I had and it worked out great!  Other than that, I used the original recipe.

I make this recipe in the fall for my son, he loves them with chocolate chips. I love them with the icing. Everyone who tries them loves them, even people who say they don't like pumpkin! I follow the recipe as is and it's great, sometimes I add increase the spices which is good too.

If I could give these 10 stars I would, they are fabulous, I made a second batch so other people could try them, yes my kids and I ate them all, lol! They're not like a "cookie" they're like a muffin but better, and if you iced them they're like a donut hole. So Yummie! You can use margarine instead of butter if ya want and you don't need to grease the pan.

I made these today and they were great!  I followed a few of the other reviewers' suggestion and substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also did not make the icing because it sounded very sweet, and that's not what I wanted. I flattened the cookies with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.  The cookies are very cakey, moist, and delicious.  I'm sure they will be a hit for Halloween.

I'm giving this 4 stars for one reason: this is a very finicky cookie. I made exactly as stated the first time, and found them dry and not all that flavorful. Since I love pumpkin, I decided to try again. I shortened the baking time, used part brown sugar as someone suggested and added some cloves to the icing, and just those 3 changes helped immensely. I found that these are very touchy cookies. 1 minute is the difference between mushy and overdone, so trying to find that magic window in those 60 seconds can be a real pain.

THESE ARE GREAT COOKIES!! Because I am a big fan of spices I added AllSpice to the mix also.  I also add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the glaze for an extra zip.  Has anyone tried to use this dough to make a loaf of pumpkin bread instead of the cookies?  I have also been thinking of trying to bake in a bundt pan and add some chinesse 5 spice to the glaze.  Bet that would turn out great also.

More closely related to cake this moist 'cookie' was too sweet for me and when topped with the icing I almost went into a Diabetic coma. Anyway I will try next time with 1/4 cup less sugar in the cookie and use cream cheese frosting instead.

These cookies are absolutely wonderful!  Very yummy indeed.  The only thing I changed was using 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar and then also making the icing out of confectioners sugar and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I think it's better with the cream cheese icing.  I brought these into work and they were a huge hit.  I got all rave reviews.  Thank you for this recipe!

Wow!  These are so good!  Very soft and moist. THe glaze is perfect although I did add a bit of pumpkin pie spice to it for more flavor.  Perfect!  I cant stop eating them.

this was much different than any other cookies i have ever made, and in a good way. the texture was a cross between a cookie and cake but super moist. the pumpkin flavor is extremely subtle too. i accidentally put double the amount nutmeg in and i did not put it cloves because i didn't have it, but it still turned out great. the icing good in theory for the cookie, but i didn't care particularly for this icing recipe. the vanilla flavor was too strong.

Delicious! I only used 1 cup of sugar and the cookies were sweet enough. I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds. Yummy!

These cookies are amazing! My new favorites! I can't believe how moist and flavorful they are. I haven't tried them with the glaze yet, but just iced them so I will shortly. These will definitely be a holiday regular. Thank you!

The ingredients sounded GREAT...but they were bland....maybe need either raisins or nuts....rhe icing helped...but needed quite a bit to give the cookies taste...good with tea for a loight tasting treat....next time I will add an additional half+ cup of sugar and golden raisins and/or pecans!

Awesome and easy!! I didn't even put the icing on these cookies (so even easier) and they were so good. Next time I will double the recipe and maybe they will last longer.

I made these for poker night and they were a huge hit!  I iced half the batch so we had a choice.  We couldn't choose a favorite.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't change anything with these cake-like cookies. Next time I make them I will add chopped pecans to the batter and maybe add some flavoring to the iceing or try another iceing, as it was too sweet for my taste. The kitchen smelled delicious when the cookies were cooking.  I'm freezing some so they don't get eaten up in one night. Hope they freeze well.

These taste great!  I substituted half a cup of white sugar with brown sugar and used 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the listed spices.  I'm bringing them to a party tonight!

Fantastic cookies! I have made these many times now, and people always love them. The only thing I change is I use 3/4 cups white sugar and 3/4 cup light brown sugar (instead of 1-1/2 cups white only), and I use 1 tbsp cinnamon (instead of 2 tsps). Delicious cookies!

This was very good - I think it will definitely go into my "arsenal". I had a little problems with the glaze, but that was more because I was rushing through it. Clumps of confectioner's sugar on cookies isn't too asthetically pleasing. I like the suggestion of icing with cream cheese, so I might try that next. Thanks!

These were great! Very easy, tasty and held up well for days on the counter as said by another reviewed. I could not ice pumpkin cookies without cream cheese frosting as I love pumpkin and cream cheese, so I used my great grandmas cream cheese frosting recipe instead. They were a hit and one batch lasted thru not one but two family parties on Saturday and Sunday.

Great cake-like cookie, did the usual substitution 1/2 applesauce; 1/2 margarine or butter, and added 2 cups grated zucchini. Turned out great, really nice change from all the zucchini bread! I stuck some cranberries in the tops of the last batch, wish I would have done that from the start! Great recipe; Thanks!

These are kind of cakey cookies.  This recipe yields a large amount of cookies and it is a nice recipe to make in the fall.  I brough them to a church function and everyone seemed to like them a lot and most people ate more than one.

Soooo Good - soft & tasty, easy to make.  I reduced sugar as I do in most cookie recipes, used 1/2 c white, 1/2 c light brown & added raisins.  After starting recipe I realized  I had only  whipped butter (not to be used in baking), so I used  1/4 c whipped butter, 1/4 c applesauce, less than 1/4 oil, baked 15 min.  they turned out fine.

SO GOOD! I used fresh pumpkin that I baked and pureed. Only tip I have is that the glaze is super sugary and overpowers the flavor of the pumpkin and spices in the cookie. So I just drizzled very little on.

I made these today, and immediately was asked by several people for the recipe!! I, too, added cinnamon to the glaze.  I think it looks pretty and adds great taste.  I used a whole can of pumpkin, also. Terrific cookie for fall!

These cookies are amazing! I made them as stated in the recipe and they turned out perfectly. I love the soft, fluffy texture, and spicy flavor. They also keep very well just sitting out for a long time! I will definetly make them again, and highly recommend them!

Great cookies! So moist, sweet and delicious.  They are muffin-top like, but I've never had a pumpkin cookie that wasn't.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin, and also substituted 1 1/2 cups almond flour & 1 cup whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour.  Also added raisins and walnuts to half the batch.  They are delish!  I love them, my kids love them too.  I may decrease the sugar next time around, because with the frosting on top they are a bit sweet for my taste.  But overall YUM!  Saving in my faves.

This is the first time I've made pumpkin cookies, actually, it's the first time I've ever eaten a pumpkin cookie and these are wonderful.  Soft and chewy with a great pumpkin taste (and very sweet).  I did as other reviewers and used 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown.  Next time I will try a cream cheese icing, but the one in this recipe is good too!

Just perfect! I subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for the white and added cinnamon to the glaze. The husband and all his coworkers are in love with this cookie! Next time, I may try it with chocolate chips and omit the glaze, just to mix things up :)

I am always giving this recipe out around October/November when I bake these cookies. They are to die for. Cakey and moist. They stay for days in tupperware (if you can resist eating them all). These are a fall staple in my house. I do personally enjoy a cream cheese frosting on these but have never received any complaints about the icing recipe here. Also like to sprinkle a smidgen of cinnamon in the icing/on top of the cookies.

The kids and I liked the flavor of these cookies.  They were easy to prepare.  My husband didn't like that they were cake-like.  He actually took 2 and put one back...something he NEVER does with cookies!

I made this last year and my husband took it to work. He got rave reviews from it then. Recently, he got asked if I'm planning on making it again this year. I guess when people remember an item from over a year ago it has to be good. =)

Couldn't agree with the other positive reviews more.  Fantastic cookie.  I have been making it for 4 years, ever since I first found it here on allrecipes, and I've never found anything better, with or without icing.  Like little cakes almost, and PERFECT with coffee.  Can't keep them around my house.  I ran out of granulated sugar this time so used 1 c granulated 1/3 c confectioners and the batch turned out fantastic!  I'll be making these a few more times this season, for sure.

These cookies were superb! Perfect for autumn. I halved the recipe and substituted 1/3 of the white sugar with brown sugar. I made the icing ahead of time, but I would suggest waiting till the end. I had to keep microwaving the icing to keep it running enough to coat the cookies. I thought the baking soda taste was a bit too strong. I will cut down the amount next time. I took some to my boyfriend at work, and everyone loved it! Thanks!

I've made these cookies tons of times, and every time, everyone loves them and tells me they're super awesome and wants to know when I'm making more.    Funny enough, I just think they're alright.  Maybe I'll try swapping 1/2 cup brown sugar the next time I make them.

This was a very tasty recipe! The super picky vegetarian staying with us gobbled them up! I did add half a cup of brown sugar to the mix subtracting a 1/2 cup from the white sugar which seemed to give them extra flavor. Thanks for sharing!

These are super fast to whip together and I love that they are not too sweet, but you can adjust how sweet you make them with the glaze...none=simple, light= my personal fav! and totally covered a cure for a sweet tooth!  A must to try!

These are good cookies, although I must say I wanted more from this recipe. I agree with other rewiewers who said these cookies had "cake like cookie" texture (a little moist). The glaze was very good.

Awesome cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly, and converted my non pumpkin liking husband. The only thing I didn't do was frost these cookies. They were so good they didn't need it.  They even sat out on the counter and were moist and delicious for days.

So yummy! The kitchen smells great when you cook these. I made a few changes: I used 2.5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the suggested spices, used a whole can of pumpkin, and used half brown sugar half white sugar. They are absolutely delicious - good luck keeping them for more than a day.

They didn't last long enough for me to put the icing on! I think after tasting them I might add slightly more pumpkin puree and slightly less ground clove (more than a 1/4 tsp and less than the 1/2 tsp called for).

Moist cookies that were a hit with everyone.  Without the icing, the cookies are a little bland though so I highly recommend not skipping that step.  If I make these again, I would add more cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

i loved that these cookies weren't sweet in and of themselves...you tasted the pumpkin and the spices, and the sugar didn't overpower it! i made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting coat it with...definitely delicious :)

Good as is, but I needed another dimension of flavor/texture. When you add walnuts to the batter...WOW! A bite that is softly dense, chewy, and nutty!

I decided to try and find some pumpkin recipes to put my husband's pumpkin for roasted pumpkin seeds to use.  I am not a big fan of anything pumpkin flavored, but these cookies are really pretty good.  I used a cup of real pumpkin puree, but made the rest of it according to the recipe.  I agree that the icing is a must.

Good- not great. The icing is a must. They are nice and moist but the flavor is rather mild. Thanks.

My first batch didn't trun out well. I decreased the cooking time to 10 minutes and they turned out much better! Instead of making the icing I just sprinkled powdered sugar on them. Yummo!

These cookies are so good!  When I baked them I couldn't decide how I wanted them topped.  I topped some with the glaze stated in the recipe, some with cream cheese frosting, and left some plain.  Personally I liked the plain ones best.  I added an extra dash of cinnamon to the dough due to personal preference but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  The flavor is distinctly pumpkin but they are so sweet and the spices are great.

These are really good, they do come out a bit moist, so I don't recommend sending them through the mail (believe me, I tried). But they're still great!

These cookies were simple to make and very tasty. The batter looked kind of wet, like I couldnt press down on them slightly, so i did a test cookie and it turned out perfect. Also, they turned out pretty light and fluffy, poss because I made my own pumpkin puree and used pastry flour. These were so good as cookies I even put some batter in muffin cups and made a few muffins too! Great cookie and a delicous scent of instant holiday aroma therapy any time.

Soooo delicious.  I wanted to make a copycat of my great aunt's pumpkin cookies and this is the recipe!  I'm so glad to find this!  I used a cream cheese frosting, but unfrosted tasted great too!

My kids and I have been making these cookings religiously for the last three years.  They are not the prettiest cookies in the world, but they are the tastiest!  A completely delightful surprise when you first taste them.  If you're a pumpkin fan, I bet you'll be hooked.

Very nice!  Definitely needed the icing (I used a cream cheese icing that I enjoy).  Making the cookies was a little challenging for me.  The first sheet was one tablespoon, slightly flattened.  I thought they were too small.  The next sheet was 3x the amount, flattened kindasorta (smeared around) to about a 1/2 inch think round mass, and baked 12 minutes.  Much better, and much prettier - especially topped with the icing.  Tasty, but not so sure I'll make again.  I needed to use a can of puree I opened to make the chocolate chip muffins from this site.

These taste delicious, they're very soft and cake like. I made a royal icing and colored it orange for some and left some white, very popular at the Halloween and Thanksgiving get togethers.

I made these five times over the holiday season because everyone I fed them to seemed to love pumpkin and therefore absolutely LOVE these cookies. Made them today again just because Mom was craving them.

Excellent cookie!!! I did not use all the spices, only had cinnamon, still perfect and since I had a can of pumpkin, used a bit more the a just a cup. The batter is a bit moist and can be hard to handle, simple use a ziplock and pipe it or freeze for 20 - 30 min. Lovely easy recipe, it's a keeper

I was going to give this 4 stars but my taste buds must have been a little off. I took this to work and our clients ate them up FAST and asked for more! I was asked for the recipe more than once. I am going to make them again.

Co-workers and family cannot get enough of these cookies.  After a batch, someone always seems to ask for a copie of the recipe.  LOVE THEM!  I cheat, and use store-bought cream cheese icing instead of making the glaze.  But when I have time, the glaze is great too!

A home run every year!! Even better if made w/ real pumpkin (fresh, baked, scraped and puréed!), but also good with canned pumpkin. Excellent, regardless! I dollop frosting on top while cookies are warm to get that nice, gooey, melty frosting on top. It eventually hardens and looks pretty with some crushed walnuts on top.

My daughter made a double batch of these today. The whole house smelled wonderful and inviting. We drizzled with the icing and they weren't too sweet.  They have a firm outside and soft inside. YUMMY! We have so many cookies we're sharing with everyone.

These were wonderful. They're very soft and puffy and they sort of reminded me of muffin tops. I made the cookies exactly as written but the icing recipe I halved. I glazed them while still warm so there was just a thin layer on top and I thought they were perfect that way.

This cookie recipe is the best! I added an extra teaspoon of Cinnamon and a full teaspoon of Cloves to increase both the spicy taste and the antioxidant effect, the result was awesome! We had friends over for lunch the day after I made these, and both of my Husbands' friends asked for the recipe! Freezes well due to the moisture of the pumpkin, so make a double batch and freeze the second batch....if you have any left over!

These were delicious! My husband thought they could use more pumpkin but I thought they were great. I drizzled them with melted white chocolate. Yum!

These cookies were phenomenal! Before I took suggestions about varying the recipe, I tried the original first and LOVED it. I do agree there needs to be a little more spice or something but they were delicious. My cookies baked for 17 minutes to get them a little more "done". I recommend icing the whole cookie rather than the drizzle on top for a more tasty treat. I will definitely make these again and again!

Not enough pumpkin flavor...maybe next time  I will follow suggestions and add 1/2 cup of pumpkin more.  If you want a flatter cookie, I suggest pushing down on the sticky cookie with a paper towel dipped with oil.

Too cakey!!! My family turned their noses up at this one. May be better as muffins and would suggest substituting some of the white sugar with brown sugar. Will probably not try this recipe again.

Good cookie, lighter in texture than I had thought it would be...assumed it would be more cakey/dense. Baked well, and came out fairly pretty. Doesn't make a ton, roughly 28 cookies. Overall a good tasting, non-wowing cookie. =)

A lot like Starbuck's pumpkin scones, almost a biscuit like texture.  But these are actually better and waaaaay cheaper too!  Soooooo good!

I really enjoyed these cookies.  I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 of the white sugar as another reviewer suggested.  I mixed the glaze in a very small bowl, so I could simply dip the top of the cookies in.  I found that 15 minutes was a perfect time to bake the cookies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! These are so good and unique too! My mother in law and grandmother in law said these were some of the best cookies they've ever had...and coming from them..that is a HUGE HUGE compliment as they are amazing bakers.  I gave as gifts this Christmas and were a huge hit, even my super picky  3  yr old couldn't get enough!! BRAVO!!

This recipe is everything it promises to be and more!  The consistency really is just like a muffin top, but somehow even more delicious than that sounds. 

I made the recipe exactly as written except I added almost a whole can of pumpkin (about 1 and 1/3 cups) and I used 1.5 tsp Cinnamon and 1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the spices.

I also experimented with adding milk chocolate chips in one batch, the result: Yummy!!!

I will definitely use this recipe again, I love the texture of these cookies.

these cookies are great for anyone who likes pumpkin.  i was out of nutmeg so i substituted it with a double dose of pumpkin pie spice instead. the outside of the cookie forms a nice crisp, thin shell, while the inside of the cookie is moist and cake-like. i loved that the pumpkin flavor is not overwhelming, just right.

I made these cookies for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them!  I now have to make them for Christmas as well and I'm sure for every other holiday.  So many people have asked me for the recipe and if I would make them their own personal batch of cookies.  These cookies were a hit!

These cookies were fabulous. I only put the icing on half of them because I like my cookies plain! But with my family it's more sugar the better. So I definitely will make these again and again!! Thanks!!

I love this recipe.  I did change a couple of things.  1C white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  a couple tablespoons of molasses.  and i added a little extra flour.  I also added pumpkin spice to the icing.  This a fantastic soft tasty cookie.   I've made it twice this year and love it.

I would give more than 5 stars if I could.  These cake-like ccokies are an amazing little treat, especially warm!!
I added a little more cinnamon (as usual), but other than that, followed recipe to a 'T'.  To ice the cookies, I used a gallon size ziplock bag, and put it in a cup folding the bag down the outside of the cup.  I then filled the cup/bag with the icing.  I cut a small slit in the corner of the bag, and viola, a homemade icing bag!!  You will love these if you like anything pumpkin!!
Kudos to the creator!!

Really good cookies. I couldn't get my cookies to be more cookie like and less bread like. Either way they were delicious. I probably added more spices and brown sugar.

These are really delicious, and incredibly easy!  I'm kind of a klutz when it comes to new recipes, and I hardly ever bake, so the fact that I had no problem making these and they turned out perfectly is a real testament to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Sooo good!  Very popular.  They are a little hard to form, very sticky.  I added the same spices, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, to the frosting.  Then I dyed the frosting orange for an extra touch.

These are really great Gina! I've made them three times now. The first was as written (except I used whole wheat pastry flour -- I always do), the second time I doubled all the spices for a more intense flavor, and the third time I simply used pumpkin pie spice mix in lieu of the single spices. All three ways are delicous, not too sweet and wonderfully flavored. I didn't need to flatten the cookies, they did it all their own in the oven. I found I like them the best ever-so-slightly underdone...they cool to a lovely soft texture. The icing is an excellent addition...the cookies are great on their own but the icing really makes them special. Nice work, Gina!

Generally it takes very little for me to love a desert so long as it has pumpkin! Pumpkin bread, pumpkin pancakes, pumpkin cake, but these were not fantastic.  USE A CREAM CHEESE BASED ICING! They taste much better. I use a recipe similar to this, but use pumpkin pie spice (about 2 tsp), about 1 1/4 cup pumpkin and 1 3/4 cup sugar. I even add a small amount of strained pumpkin to the icing(a few tb)

I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were a hit with kids and adults alike. I made with whole wheat flour and replaced half the butter with applesauce. They were amazing this way, and healthier too! Also, I added 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom and 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger along with the other spices. Lends the cookies a bit more depth.

These are fantastic! I add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup raisins. I also add cinnamon to the glaze. A local bakery has a similar cookie that sells for over a buck each...so glad to make my own instead!

After searching for the right recipe for pumpkin cookies, this is the one I chose. Was not disappointed. Easy to make and had just the right amount of spices. The glaze is a must.Gives just the right amount of extra flavor.

These are fabulous!  I don't even like pumpkin, and I thought they were great.  My boyfriend, a pumpkin fanatic, now has a new favorite cookie.  Love the cakey texture.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site for the icing--it just sounded yummier to me at the time!

Is a family favorite.  We don't use any icing and they stay moist for days.  More like a cake bite than a cookie.

These cookies are absolutely delicious exactly according to the recipe.  I brought them to a party and people just raved about them.  I have a major sweet tooth, and these cookies do justice (I'm not sure why some people say these are not sweet).  And I agree to not store these in a sealed container, they will get mushy.  Great Recipe!

This is the best iced pumpkin cookie recipe ever!!  

I wouldn't call them cookies though.  They're more like tea-cakes.

I made mine with fresh pumpkin instead of that canned .  They're delicious.

These cookies are wonderful! I added cinnamon and cream cheese to the confectioner icing for a nice additional flavor.
Some guy at work thought they were mini chicken fried steaks. I laughed so hard, and don't let him live it down to this day... hahaha

Yummy and I'm not even a big pumpkin fan. The glaze came out great as well. For the initial amount of liquid one cup of confectioner's sugar would have been enough. I ended up with a lot of glaze which I froze for later use. If the cookies come out too dry just put them in an airtight container for a day and they soften nicely.

Yummy and easy. If you make your own pumpkin you use 1 3/4 cups. I added golden raisins to the cookies and for the frosting I made a half batch with a dash of cinnamon and substituted almond extract for the vanilla. YUMMY!

I just finished making these, excited by all the great reviews, but am really disappointed! The cookie is bland and the icing overpowers it. I even added a tad more sugar and pumpkin like some of the other reviewers suggest. These were edible but I definitely won't make them again. (Unless I forgo the baking ... the dough was fifteen times yummier than the baked cookie.)

I would give this recipe a gazillion stars!  I made them on a whim yesterday after work to take to a church event.  I love the not terribly sweet, cakey cookie with the supersweet spicy glaze drizzled on top.  Absolutely one of my favorite ever cookies that I'll make over and over!

I was looking for a pumpkin cookie my sister used to make years ago, and this was the closest I found. I tried them iced, and I didn't care for it (even though I have a huge sweet tooth). These are very sticky and difficult to make look pretty. Also found that when undercooking them, they stay moist longer.

I decided to try this recipe because of its high ratings.  Although these tasted good, these are definitely NOT cookies.  They are the EXACT consistency of muffin tops, which I also love.  Unfortunately I was craving cookies =(  Do give these a try though, if you're looking for the most delicious part of a muffin!  For something SLIGHTLY more cookie-like, and with more texture (oats and raisins--or as I like, dried cranberries ^_^), I recommend Pumpkin Cookies I, also from this website.

GREAT recipe! My family and I loved these cookies. My daughter had a friend over so I decided to try this recipe, the friend loved them too and just had to take some home for her family to try. I didn't make the glaze to go with the cookies but we didn't miss it. Actually I will use a little less sugar the next time I make this. I used half white sugar and half brown. I did the same with the flour, half white and half whole wheat. This is a definite A and I will be making thses for Thanksgiving.

Very good, but only 4 stars since I had to modify to our tastes...  Thanks to the review who said these would come out with the look and texture of a muffin top, because that gave me the idea to top these with sugar in the raw by pressing the dough with a buttered/sugared glass.  Cookies are very cake-like and soft.  I did use a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin and just added a little flour because we like more pumpkin flavor in our pumpkin cookies... go figure!  Added craisins and white chocolate chips to some and it was very tasty.  My 4 year old has been munching on them this afternoon, and he loved helping to make them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These cookies were great!  I used fresh pumpkin and it makes a huge difference in taste!!  Also used 1/4 tsp. of maple flavoring in the icing and it was delicious!  Will make these again and again.  All my kids loved them.

Minor changes:  added more cinnamon/spices.  Also used 1 cup brown sugar/.5 cup white sugar.  Also frosted with a cream cheese frosting with cinnamon mixed in.  I've made them twice and people loved them both times.  They were gone in no time... will make again!

I made these without the glaze and they are wonderfully tasty that way as well. Everyone who has tried them has been asking me for the recipe! I also tend to add a couple of dashes more of each of the spices to give it a little more 'kick'.

If you want to skip the frosting, just add chocolate chips....amazing. I also substituted 1/2 cu. sugar for brown sugar...just my preference.

What else do you do on a fall day when its cold and raining?  You bake cookies of course, I made a double batch of these cookies thinking with all the great reviews that it would be awesome, boy was I upset that I didn't make a quadruple batch.  What a great recipe, 10 thumbs up.  Thanks for making this a cookie recipe that I will bake for years to come!

So, so, so good!  Definitely adding this to my fall baking list.  The texture of the cookie was great, I thought it was rather light.  The icing was also a nice addition, though I only used half of it.

These are excellent pumpkin cookies. They are not outrageously cakey, like some people said, but they're the right amount of cakey to be good pumpkin cookies.

This is the second time I make these cookies. Absolutely delicious!!! Gave some to my daughter and family and they also loved them. "Best cookie she ever ate"!
 I love that they are not too sweet. A+++ in my recipe book.

These are sooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly and at first thought that the batter may be too wet but it baked perfectly.  I baked mine about 17 minutes each batch.  The icing compliments the cookies nicely but they are also good without.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

These are excellent.  Took them to a party and had lots of recipe requests.  I do recommend following the instructions to flatten them.  They do puff up quite a bit.  Thanks!

Fabulous cookie! I added 1/2 tsp. of ginger and 1 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar then iced with a caramel icing and the result was a sweet, soft, spicy, delicious cookie.

Awesome recipe!  This recipe was recommended to me on the recipe exchange.  I had 1/2 can of pumpkin left after making pumpkin pancakes.  These cookies were moist and flavorful.  I would cut the icing recipe in half since I drizzled it on top and had so much left over.  Also, I made one batch that I took out after 19 minutes and I left the other batch in there for two more minutes and the first batch tasted much better.  A very light golden top is perfect.  I can't wait to eat another one!

I skipped the icing and added chocolate chips. Fantastic! I also added 1/2 tsp. ginger, just because I love all those spices in my pumpkin pie.

These were just awesome!  They got rave reviews either plain or iced.  My children absolutely loved them.  I did find the baking time to be a little too long as other reviews had mentioned, but the flavor of them still deserves 5 stars!!!

Awesome cookie recipe!!!  Very soft and cakelike texture.  These were gone in a few hours.  Instead of the glaze recipe, I frosted them with Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting and they were to die for!  Will be making again for Thanksgiving.

They didn't need to be baked nearly as long as the recipe called for. I put them in the oven for 12 mins, and that seemed about right. Also, the icing had WAY to much vanilla. I would half that, and it needed an extra tbsp of icing.

Great recipe!  My daughter has a dairy allergy and I was able to modify this to suit her needs.  I used Earth Balance Natural Buttery Spread in the cookies and SoyMilk in the icing.  She loved them!!  Thanks for a keeper.

If there was a four and a half star option, that'd be my final rating. These were very, very good, yet not what I was expecting. Just a warning so you won't be surprised while making; the dough when ready is like bread dough, almost yeast like. Once the cookie is baked, the texture is still more of a pumpkin bread than a cookie. As a result of this, you will have to more than slightly flatten the rounded tablespoonfuls before putting into the oven. They will rise, but NOT spread. So much to the point that next time I'll consider baking them while in perfect balls, and dipping them into the icing to make pumpkin donut holes!
I used Splenda to make the dough sugar free, and mine required no more than 10 minutes in the oven on light-colored cookie sheets. 
Add food coloring to your glaze for the fall and Christmas seasons.
Overall, great recipe and worth your time this season. Though I would consider re-naming these to Iced Pumpkin Bread Cookies.

These cookies are awesome.  Even people that don't like pumpkin were eating these things one after another.  Some day I'm gonna try to make them with sweet potato instead of pumpkin just to try it.

These were pretty boring. I used my own pumpkin so that could have had something to do with it. It didnt taste much like pumpkin, just spice. i would suggest adding more fresh pumpkin to anyone who is using their own or just more in general. Also the amount of icing wasnt enough as you can see from the picture i posted. it made a nice pattern but it was because the icing ran out. I will continue to adjust this recipe as i see other people have gotten great success out of it. maybe it was just a bad batch

These are wonderful! My son needed to take something pumpkin flavored to school and I found this recipe. He made a face when he saw the cookie dough, but loved the cookies when they came out of the oven. He took them to school and all the kids loved them. I had about 10 requests for the recipe from various teachers.

These are great.  I would add a little more pumpkin next time and maybe make sure that to use all of the icing.  They were a big hit for a birthday and Stephanie said that she would take them home and eat them for breakfast.

These were very good. I used white/whole wheat flour and you couldn't tell the difference. I also found that dunking the cookies in the glaze was better than the drizzle.

I'm only giving these 3 stars because these are really too soft to do much of anything with, and only got softer the next day.  I made these for my son's 4th birthday party and am disappointed.  They stick to each other and everything they are on.  The inside is fully cooked, but the outside is more like the top of a muffin (without yummy crunchy stuff).  The flavor is good, but just too soft.

While I loved the cookie the first time, I changed just a couple of things the second time:  
I love pumpkin taste so I added a whole can of pumpkin and doubled the "pumpkin type spices."
I added chocolate chips to the last half of the batter. YUM!
I added cinnamon to the icing.

I was so excited to try this recipe, and tasty it was, but the presentation was not 5 stars. Did anyone feel like the cookies were way too thick? Should I cut back on the flour or the pumpkin puree? I know this is supposed to be cakeLIKE but my product did not resemble a cookie and I was very careful to follow the recipe.

The best pumpkin cookies ever.  I got lots of raves over this one.  Very moist and cakey.  Followed the recipe to a tee and will be making this one again and again.

Excellent cookie recipe! Tastes great, easy to prepare and the icing makes the cookie even better. I froze these cookies and after thawing them, they were still fantastic and soft.  I got rave reviews from everyone who ate these cookies.

This cookie was very good.  Make sure you bake it long enough.  My husband took a double batch of these to work and they were gone in an instant!   A good, cake like cookie.

Simply scrumptious! I've made this cookie two years in a row now and have already had requests to make them again this year. If you don't mind cakey-cookies, give this recipe a try. The icing looks/tastes great as well.

These cake-like cookies are THE BEST.  Make sure you add a little extra milk to the glaze, I found mine to be too thick with the amount of milk the recipe calls for.  

Also, I just used pumpkin pie spice and they turned out lovely. Be sure to add some to the glaze, it's so tasty and beautiful.  I'll be making two batches of these next week for Halloween :)

These cookies were good.  Moist and cake-like.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II as the icing and used a tad of orange extract (because I didn't have orange zest).  The hint of orange went well with the spicy pumpkin cookies. I will definitely make this recipe again, but next time I will use the icing with the recipe and jazz it up a little because I think it'll be easier to stack cookies.  Cream cheese frosting stayed soft.

These are really good. I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception: I didn't realize that I was out of eggs, so I substituted 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch (added in with the wet ingredients). I don't know how much this affected the taste of the original recipe, but we thought they were great!

My mother-in-law made this and I got hooked on it last year and somewhat forgot about it (usually happen if it's not made by me).  Then my husband brought home a pumpkin cake that reminds me of this.  Then few days later, I made this for my office potluck.  Everyone loves it and keeps coming back for seconds!  I only added 2 more teaspoons of the milk to get the glaze the way I liked it.

Wow.  These are REALLY good.  I think I like them even better the next day.  The only problem is that they are really addictive.  B/c they aren't really rich, it is easy to just keep eating and eating them.  Consider yourself warned :)

I thought these were pretty good. Very cakey consistency, so you've gotta like that. I'm just not a big fan of that type of glaze on top. If I make again, I'll do a cream cheese type of glaze.

A very nice cakey cookie. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out great.  To flatten I suggest just dropping your cookie sheet on the counter top a couple of times. The batter is very soft and sticky so flattening them with a spoon or your finger is messy. These a wonderful when you add Cream Chesse Frosting II on top!!!

I really liked the texture of these cookies. They were light yet very satisfying. I added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg for more flavor. I would prefer a cream cheese frosting, but overall they went over very well. I doubled the batch and half of them were gone in one day.

I made these wonderful cookies exactly as the recipe states, and they are sooooo wonderful.  I've made them 3 times in the last 2 weeks and they get gobbled up everywhere I take them!  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this recipe tonight.  =)  Made a few of the suggested changes (used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, used more pumpkin and more sugar than called for) and I also added chocolate chips to about half of the batter.  Wasn't quite as spicy as I was expecting, but delicious.

I've been searching for the perfect pumpkin cookie and this is it! I made this for a family get together and they didn't make it though the night. These are absolutely delicious, even the pumpkin haters in my family were converted by these cookies. They have a wonderful soft, cake-like texture and just melt in your mouth. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe: I used the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin and used half brown sugan and half white. These are a must for holiday baking.

These cookies are so good!  My husband said they were probably the best I have ever made.  I used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice rather than clove and nutmeg and they turned out great.

These cookies are fantastic!  I love anything pumpkin, and these are the best pumpkin cookies I've had.  The spicy aroma fills and warms the house on a cool autumn day.  I made them pretty much as the recipe states, except that I added about 1/2 cup more pumpkin (I just wanted to use up what I had left), and I added chopped pecans and dried cranberries.  After reading the reviews first, I also added a little cinnamon to the glaze and that was very good.  I flattened the first batch with a sugar coated glass bottom.  The second batch, I didn't flatten.  We decided we liked them much better flattened, and we liked that little extra sugar on the tops.  They baked perfectly for me in 15 minutes.  I like them with and without icing.  Either way is delicious.

Great recipe. Next time I will try cream cheese frosting. It helps to let the cookies cool before putting on the glaze.

My best friend and I just made these....and they are AMAZING!!!!  My new favorite fall cookie.  We didn't have enough vanilla extract so we used vanilla carmel creamer instead for the icing.  It was a nice touch!

What a terrific fall cookie!  The icing is just sweet enough, and doesn't take away from the spices in the cookie.  A friend of my husbands came over while I was baking and asked WHAT I had in the oven!!! The house smelled good even the next day!

This is a tasty little cookie (although my husband insists I stop calling it a cookie-it really is more of a mini-cake) I would probably put a little more seasoning in it next time though. My only beef with this is when I stored them afterwards, they got very mushy and much less attractive looking. They still tasted the same, just much less pretty than the night I made them. :-(

These were great. I used 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and 1 1/2 tsp. cinn. instead of the other spices. This was recommended by another poster.  I baked  them in an electric stove for about 18 minutes. The results were a cake like cookie. You can't go wrong with these and they look exactly like the pictures on this site. I'm off to buy more pumpkin.

These are the BEST pumpkin cookies!  I have been making them for 5 years now and they are always a hit!  They are the perfect fall cookie.  I can't believe they don't have a perfect 5 star rating anymore!!  I make them just as the instructions say EXCEPT I only bake them for about 12 minutes and then top them with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious!!

Great recipe.  I liked the "cakey" texture to the cookies, but used the batter to make variations of the cookies.  I put little drops of the batter on a cookie sheet (like doghnut holes) and once they were baked put them into a bag with some powdered sugar. Mmmm. . . Next I mixed in some vanilla chips into the left over batter and made minature bundt cakes.  They all turned out pretty well.

These are delicious. Totally different from what I was expecting, as they are more cake-like than cookie-like. Regardless, the office went nuts for these when I brought them in. And my fiance ate about 10 in one day. That's saying something, since he isn't that into sweets.

As other suggested, I added cinnamon to the icing. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I live in Mass. & this time of year I am always looking for something new w/ fall flavor to compliment the season.  These cookies are it! I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all seperate spices, because that is what i had on hand & it worked great. I will warn you though, they are highly addictive so double the batch!

OMG!  Delish. Dangerous recipe because the cookie dough is so tasty that you have to force yourself to walk away from the kitchen in between trays.  I know I just gained 5 lbs . I substituted lite cream for the milk while making the icing. Excellent choice.  My 17 yr. old, who normally doesn't want to be around me, has suddenly become my bosom buddy.  This cookie has restored my relationship with my teen!

The best cookies I've ever had! I used a real pumpkin for the pumpkin puree (cut it in half, baked face-down at 375 for 1.5 hours), and it worked beautifully w/ a little over a cup of the flesh.
Like other reviewers, I added 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. of brown sugar instead of all white sugar, and only made half of the frosting--which was more than enough, as the cookies are so delicious that they only need a little bit of the frosting. Thank you so much for posting this delicious recipe! I know that I will make these cookies often!

My kids loved these cookies!  I made them without changing a thing, except to add some pumpkin pie spice to the icing.  The cookies were perfect.  I was a little worried before baking them because the cookie dough was very soft.  They baked up just right, and were done in 9 minutes exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are SO good and a nice change from traditional cookies. The cake-like texture is moist and soft. I baked them at the lowest time (15 min) and they were perfect.

Oh, I used cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze and put a candy corn in the middle of the frosting. They looked very festive and were a big hit!

These were ok.  Not as amazing as I was expecting.  Definitely better with frosting, although next time I'm going to make the frosting thicker so I can spread it on with a knife instead of drizzling with a fork.

Very nice! I followed the recipe exactly, but only had to bake for about 13-15 minutes. This makes a very dense, cake-like cookie and is not very sweet. Subtle flavor, very nice--my husband and I decided this is more of a coffee or tea cookie, not a dessert cookie. Very good!

YUMMY!!!!! These ROCK to the bottom of my tummy. The only thing I did different is add a little maple flavoring to the frosting. Big hit at work. So make these awesome cookies!!!!!!

Great recipe once I made a few changes.  My family doesn't like pumpkin, so I use a cup of homemade sweet potato pie filling instead, and used a half cup of dark brown sugar, after cutting back the white sugar to a cup.  I also wanted a cookie that would be easy to pack for lunches, so I decided instead of the icing, to roll the cookies in a mixture of raw sugar and cinnamon.  The raw sugar gives the cookies a nice crunch, and the brown sugar makes them less like cake.  Excellent!

LOVE THESE! If you're looking for a sweet cookie, this is NOT it.  These are a huge hit with my 5 year old and one year old.  The icing makes them just sweet enough. Thanks for the great recipe!

I stumbled on this recipe when I was looking for a nice fall cookie that looked nice, to bake for gifts for my in-laws, they come out sort of cake like, but in a nice way, and the frosting makes them look so fancy, someone thought I bought them! I think I will make these every fall!

These were pretty good, but nothing fantastic.  I love pumpkin and spice, so I thought I'd REALLY like these.  Don't get me wrong.  They WERE good, just not great.  My co-workers liked them (I made these a while ago and am just now reviewing - :o) ).  Actually, I made them for my bf and I, and didn't care for them enough (to have several dozen laying around my house), so I took them to the office to share.  I did really like the soft cake-like texture (yummy!).  I prepared the recipe for penuche frosting (pumpkin cookies with penuche frosting from Suzanne Stull on this site) instead of the basic icing recipe and liked it very much.  These remind me of a similar cookie sold at a local bakery here in the Chicago burbs.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are amazing! They will now become part of our Christmas cookie line up. For the sugar, I used half brown and half granulated white, and in the glaze I left out half a cup of powder sugar and added cinnamon. These are simply delicious cookies, and not dry at all.

I LOVED these, even after all the healthy changes I made! I replaced the 1/2 cup butter with 2/3 cup applesauce, used 1 cup splenda and 1/2 cup white sugar, and completely ommitted the icing. Someday I will make the full-fat version of these, but the healthy version tasted just fine!

These were amazing!  The smell in my house while they were cooking was fantastic.  I made a cream cheese frosting/glaze to put over the cookies and added a little cinnamon to it.  These are a definite favorite and will become a regular for my Christmas cookie exchange.  Thanks for sharing!!

Very good, these always disappear soo fast! Didn’t use the glaze though because we had some cake frosting that needed to be used up. Great with the frosting or even by themselves.

I forgot to review these when i made them in November or so. These cookies were memorable though, very delicious smelling while cooking, and even more delicious tasting fresh out of the oven. I didn't think they held terribly great, but they were will good for a few days after.

Great and easy. I was looking for a quick cookie for my son who loves gingerbread cutouts. Didn't want to do cutouts so tried these. Did need to punch up the spices-added pumpkin pie spices and it needed that. Will make again.

The only thing I would do differently is add more pumpkin-the recipe could have used more pumpkin flavor.  Otherwise great recipe.

Very yummy and I don't even like pumpkin!!  Cook time is way too much.  Baked for 13 minutes and they came out perfect.  Mine were even big, only made about 24 cookies.

These are great - if you like pumpkin - they are moist and tasty.  I didn't flatten them out though - I use a scoop similar to an ice cream scoop but smaller to scoop out cookie batter, so it is consistent and all the cookies are the same size for even cooking results.  These were nice and fluffy, so I am glad I didn't flatten them at all.

I think these are great, especially considering that they are perfect around the holidays and look very nice too. They have a unique muffin-like texture, rather than the rich, crisp, buttery texture that most cookies have.  You can easily make more than 36 cookies out of one batch, and I only used about 2/3 of the icing.

These were very bland to me.  I love pumpkin but didn't taste much of it in these cookies.  The icing hardened at first and then turned the cookies into soggy messes after about 1 hour.

These cookies are delicious!  I skipped the icing and added chocolate chips.  So good!  I have tried another pumpkin cookie recipe from this site, and this recipe is THE best!  These cookies won't last long once they are out of the oven!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for!  Tons of flavor & the right texture.  I followed the recipe except I made cream cheese frosting.  They turned out absolutely perfect and I received many compliments. These cookies did not get soft as others have said.

Very satisfying, though not very pumpkin-y. The second time around I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other ingredients and it seemed to work well. Great with cream cheese icing too (instead of glaze).

Yumm! I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and did not ice them. Very good and quick to make! To make them look better, dampen your fingers slightly and use to shape/flatten the cookies. Much prettier this way.

These are great!!!!!  They are very moist and cake like -they are pretty sweet - too much so for my husband, but perfect for me :)

Not hard to make either - wait till they cool COMPLETELY before frosting.

Good flavor, but dried out quickly.  I made these for Thanksgiving with the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this site.  The children licked off the frosting and threw the cookies away.  The adults liked them.  I'm not sure if I would make this recipe again though, they were just very dry the next day.

These are amazing! I have made pumpkin cookies before which turned out sticky and didn't hold together well, but these cookies are perfect! They bake beautifully and have a cake like center.  They are spicy and sweet, everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved them!

I was disappointed in these, especially after reading the great reviews.  The cookies didn't have enough flavor, except for the icing- which had too much!  I probably won't make these again, but if I do, I'll use much more spice in the cookie, and either use 1/4tsp of vanilla in the icing, or I'll use a cream cheese frosting instead.

I baked these for my boyfriend's Thanksgiving potluck.  Even though  I forgot the vanilla in the first batch, they were fantastic anyway!  They were soft and moist but unlike most cookies, didn't hurt my sensitive teeth and were AMAZING straight out of the oven.  His coworkers kept asking where he bought them...I wouldn't change the recipe at all.  Thank you!

I'm not a baker by any means and tend to mess things up.  My friend has made these cookies for me before and I love them.  So I decided to make them this evening for the Thanksgiving holiday... and they turned out AMAZING.

I didn't have ground cloves and used pumpkin spice instead. Instead of 1 cup of pumpkin puree I used 1 1/4 cups.

This was a great recipe!!  I used 3 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 1, added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and I used a whole small can of pumpkin.  I frosted some with the icing and with cream cheese and some without any.  It was great either way!!  Thanks for a keeper!!

Excellent cookies!  I made them for a church bake sale and was "hunted down" for the recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I made no changes to the cookie, but I frosted them with the Cream Cheese Frosting I recipe from this site.  They tasted like that pumpkin roll that everyone always likes without all the work.  Thanks for sharing.  Will be making these again today.

I followed this recipe exactly and found the cookies came out too soft and tend to break in half easily.  The cookies are way too sugary and the icing only adds to the sugariness.  One suggestion might be to cook the cookies a little longer, but then they tend to burn on the bottom and instead of the icing put only powdered sugar sprinkled on top of them.

My family loves these cookies! They want these for Thanksgiving instead of pie. I used a whole can of pumpkin (I think it works out to a cup and a half of stuff) and half brown sugar, half white sugar. Awesome!!!

This recipe is so good I registered just to comment!  My second batch I added 1/2 cup Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) and didn't ice them; my family actually liked that better.  Next time I'm substituting Splenda for half the sugar.

I used 1/2 c. more pumpkin, pumpkin spice in place of spices, and added caramel bits (come in a bag, and are little caramel balls)and shredded chocolate in cookie.  Amazing.  I didn't end up putting the icing on top.

Awesome cookies, I love the texture, soft and just delicious. If you want puffed cookies mix the butter while cold. Excellent recipe!

This is my favorite pumpkin cookie recipe yet. I used cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze, but I am sure they are great both ways.

These cookies were very moist and tasted amazing.  I love a good strong pumpkin taste so I added more pumpkin and spices to taste.  These are going into my holiday recipe book.

Simply the best and easiest pumpkin cooking I have ever tasted!  Our church has a FREE monthly Soup for Supper night at our building for the community and I decided to serve pumpkin pie and these pumpkin cookies to go along with 10 crocks of soups and chili that were made by women that cook for Jesus.  Well, the cookies were devoured long before anything else.

Very good. I didn't make the frosting, but I wish I had. They aren't that sweet without frosting. I also wish it had a little more of a pumpkin punch, but overall good. I would make them again. The less baking time, the better, they are more cake like.

Absolutely DEE-LISH!  My 3yr old son and I had a blast making these and even more fun EATING THEM!  I just hope they make it until Daddy gets home from work!  I will certainly make these for the Holidays..  I did not use the cloves but added a pinch more cinnamon.  Thanks for posting this!

These "mookies" (since they are so muffin-like) were a big hit at Sunday school breakfast.  I did use half brown sugar and half white. I had two people ask for the recipe--which is always a good sign. My young son liked them for breakfast too.

Modified it a bit. Bake at least 15 to 18 min. I felt like they were lacking something like maybe chopped walnuts. A great holiday cookie!

Great fall flavors! As others mentioned these are cake-like, but very moist. I added some maple syrup to the glaze, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This one is a keeper!

Just finished baking a batch of these cookies and they are fantastic.  I used baked butternut squash instead of the pumpkin.  They are tasty with or without the icing...although I am sure my children will prefer with the icing!

These were delicious!  The only change I made to the cookies was to use 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  For the icing,  I added 1T molasses and a little bit of ginger.  I don't even like pumpkin that much, and I can't stop eating them.  They're so good!

These cookies are very good.  I love spiced cookies and these were very tastey, I liked how cakelike they were.  I don't feel the recipe needs any changes.  I liked the touch of sweetness the icing added.  Going to make these again.

Boy, are these good!  I used one cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar--which probably made it a little sweeter than the original recipe but my kids didn't mind!  I also melted cream cheese and powdered sugar to make the drizzle.

I am looking for my grandmothers pumpkin cookie recipe that noone in my family can find.  So, I tired this one hoping that it was close.  It was wonderful, very tasty, and easy to make.  Similar but not my grandmothers. My daughter and I had fun making and eating them, though!  Thanks

these cookies were great, and they went like hotcakes...the only problem was that the icing was gross. It just didn't go with the cookies at all and made them soggy, no problem, we just dumped the cookies and ate them by themself. I also made a few changes... I just used the egg white instead of the whole egg, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter, and 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup white. Delicious!

Wow1 These were easy to make and they melt in your mouth. My husband is not a cookie or pumpkin lover but he has eaten more than his share of these. Sine I was making these for a Halloween gathering I sprinkled Halloween decorative dots on them. I plan to use them again at Thanksgiving.

My second batch is still cooling!  Let me start by saying I'm not a cook, I don't enjoy being in the kitchen at all so my baking skills are virtually nonexistant, but these cookies were really easy!  Next, I don't like pumpkin OR cinammon, but needed something for a Halloween party tonight and was feeling a little adventerous.  All I can say is WOW!  These cookies are excellent!  I added pecans because I like a little crunch, next time I'll add mini chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just popped them out of the oven...I had to sit down and share how amazing they are!  I added some maple syrup to the icing and it puts them on my "top 10 favorite cookie" list!

Everyone really seemed to like these.  I thought they were ok but a bit too cakey.

Excellent! The only changes I made were (because I didn't have any eggs) adding 1/2 banana + 1/3 c more of pumpkin puree instead of the egg, and omitting the butter in the icing.  Made 28 large cookies that we sold at our cafe for $1.00.  Everyone loved them!

I made these today, and realized once I started making them I did not have butter...I used veg oil and a whole can of pumpkin.  I also used part brown/part white sugar...extra cinnamon and did not have cloves so added allspice instead.  I added cinnamon to the glaze which made for a nice flavor...I think would be even better with butter.

We loved these cookies & they got rave reviews from the friends we shared them with as well.  I substituted pumpkin spice for the cloves because I didn't have anything.  DELICIOUS!

These are positively DELICIOUS! I'm not big on cakey cookies but these were SO soft and full of flavor! I took some to a pumpkin carving part and got lots of compliments -- people asked for some to take home!!

I, like many other reviewers, doubled the spices and added a teaspoon of ground ginger. I used cream cheese frosting on top because I had some I needed to get rid of. It was tasty, but I'll try the glaze next time, because the frosting made them pretty messy.

These cookies reminded me of my Grandma's cookies - unfortunatley she never wrote anything down!! They were so good - very "cakey" my husband and son ate about a dozen before i was even finished baking - the glaze is a little on the sweet side and by the last batch i was glazing very lightly.  these are keepers!

Excellent, moist and chewy cookies.  I did use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar.  Next time I might add 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice in addition to the listed spices for a little more of the "pumpkin spice" taste.  Glorious though!  The batter is a bit sticky so it was hard to get it to the shape of the picture, but a few bumps won't bother my party. ;o)

THESE ARE DELICIOUS! I ONLY BAKED THEM FOR ABOUT 13 MINUTES AND THEY WERE PERFECT. I COULD HAVE USED HALF OF THE GLAZE, AND I WOULD ALSO OMIT THE BUTTER, IT GAVE IT A WEIRD TEXTURE.

We didn't have any ground cloves, so we put in 1 tsp of nutmeg. My husband's not a big pumpkin fan, and he loved these! I can't imagine how they could taste better!

my family all loved these cookies! but i honestly thought they were a little boring. i was expecting more flavor. it tasted almost like i was eating something healthy! if i was to make them again i would probably add a little bit more spices, and then definently make cream cheese frosting, i didnt care for the frosting recipe.

I made these last night and they turned out pretty well. I found that the dough is stickier than regular cookie dough and made a sticky mess on my hands. I think adding chopped walnuts to this recipe would be good. The cookie appearance does look kind of blob like, but they seem pretty healthy and taste really good.

Definitely add mini chocolate chips!  Too plain for my taste without the chips.  Good soft cookie, icing came out well.  Followed recipe exactly, wouldn't make any changes.  Coworkers love them.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  This yielded a light, almost muffin-like cookie which is mildly spiced.  They baked up very moist and really didn't need any icing at all.  'Course I iced 'em anyway.  They are a hit with the whole family.  I'll be making these all autumn as my sugar pumpkins ripen!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe has become a sentimental favorite of mine.  I bake them for the first day of school every year.  They hold up well in a lunch box.  They also taste a bit like New England to my fellow Southern transplants who miss the seasons but not the frost.

These were quick & easy to make. I didn't have enough time to make the icing so I served them plain & they were still a hit!!! I'll definately make them again....

These cookies are fantastic, and I don't even really care for pumpkin.  I made these for a family get together, and they all disappeared!  I had to make them a second batch for the next day, and they all asked for the recipe.

Loved these!  Only added 1/2 of the cloves called for and didn't use the frosting listed, but rather drizzled them with "butterscotch sauce II" also from this site.  Definitely cakey in texture, but still very yummy.

I made these as gifts and all my friends LOVED them. The dough is super sticky, so putting them on the cookie sht was the most time-consuming part, but they are DELICIOUS! (I used 1/2 tsp. of cloves, cinn, ginger, all-spice, etc.) You can add too much spice flavor.

I LOVE these cookies!!!!! They're perfect for those who love cakey cookies that aren't too sweet. If you don't have time or don't want to make the icing, you can buy the whipped cream cheese frosting made by Duncan Heines. These cookies don't spread too much in the oven so give them a quick press to flatten them a little bit. Otherwise they are super delish!!!

This is my favorite cookie recipe.  I actually made these cookies and passed them out to all of my neighbors this year - they raved about them! These are best served warm with a cup of coffee.  Since the recipe is a bit cake-like, you may consider making it into a bundt cake or a bread loaf.  Enjoy!

Good but not great.  The icing really balanced them out, but I wish that there was a way to make them less cakey.  The dough on the other hand was amazing as I licked it off of the mixing blades.

Very good recipe - I loved the soft, cakey texture as well. I left out the cloves because I didn't have any and they turned out fine. I also used "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this website instead of the frosting listed and it was very good. Overall the recipe is very tasty, but didn't blow any socks off.

My husband is deployed in Iraq and I made these cookies for him for his thanksgiving care package.  I let the icing dry, and vaccum packed them and they made it to Iraq perfectly.  All the troops loved them and it was a little taste of home.  I love this recipe!

These are delicious! Yes, they are cake-like texture but it still taste great! I didn't have any ground cloves, so I substituted ground allspice and it turned out fine. They were right that you shouldn't put it in an alltight container because the glaze didn't harden and started to melt off the cookies. Just keep the covers off until glaze are harden.

Good but not fantastic enough to give it 5 stars (like most of my other reviews!). I liked the fact that this is very low in fat. They were more like cake than a cookie ... so for this texture I think I'd rather use one of the amazing pumpkin bread recipes on this site and makes "cookies" out of the batter. I did like these enough to bring to a house warming party :). UPDATE: I changed my mind. I and everyone I know are now addicted to these. I dream about them. They are so good frozen!

Outstanding!  I put white chocolate chips in just before baking, and omitted the nuts.  It was the perfect addition of sweetness, with or without the icing.  I would highly recommend it.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved them!  I like the texture of them and I am going to try it with bananas instead of pumpkin (changing the spices) and see how that turns out.  Great recipe! Thanks!

I really liked these cookies. Easy and good.  More cake-like then cookie.  I didnt have all the spices it called for - only cinnamon. I did have pumpkin pie spice, so I did add that.  Also, next time I make these I am either going to buy or make cream cheese frosting for the glaze.

This cookies are soft and yummy!  I used fresh pumpkin puree.  I had to put the glaze pastry bag to do the drizzle effect on the cookies b/c my fork drizzles always end up looking more like blobs.  Worked great! Will definitely make this again...soon!

I agree that these are more cake-like, but delicious.  I made them for a friend's birthday and her family loved them.  They look very pretty on a plate and the icing allows you to drizzle it and make them look more elegant than a regular cookie.

I was disappointed with this recipe... and I so wanted to love it. I think the flavor was quite good, however the texture was not as moist and chewy as I expected.

These are quite good! I was out of baking powder and butter so I used 1 1/4 tsp of baking soda, 1/3 cup molasses, and 1/3 cup grapeseed oil. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla, and made chocolate frosting (because everything is even better with chocolate, right?). Wonderful!

I followed the recipe to the letter, and found that I'm just not a fan of these cookies. They puff up a LOT in the oven and are more like a very dry cake than a cookie. The inside, though soft, is very dry and when you start to chew it, becomes a gluey blob in your mouth....it's sort of like eating raw cookie dough. My family loved them anyway, though I can't see why!

This recipe definately dosn't need any tweaking, but becuase I like to experiment I have made these several ways. My favorite variation is as follows: I substituted 1/2 C white flour for 1/2 C. wheat flour, a little extra cinnamon and vanilla, I didn't have ground cloves on hand so I thought it would be fun to use Pumpkin Pie Spice in place (approx. 1 1/2 tsp), as always I used low fat margarine which didn't compromise the texture or taste at all, and in place of the pumpkin puree I used canned easy pumpkin pie mix. (Because the pie mix is slightly thinner than canned pumpkin I added flour to a desirable consistency). Finally I mixed in almost an entire bag of milk chocolate chips.  The cookie consistency was perfect (slightly cakey/slightly dense) and the taste was amazing! I got rave reviews all around and the empty plate in minutes was proof that they were delicious (some guest took a couple cookies for the drive home)! Trust me, these variations do not make the cookie too sweet or spicy, it's full of flavor and just right.

A wonderfully unique cookie! The consistency reminds me of Snackwell's Devilsfood cookies.  I bought them to work today and they were gone fast!  I didn't change a thing with the recipe - great as is.  I did somehow end up with 52 cookies out of the batch (used a cookie dough scooper (looks like an ice cream scooper)) - but more of a good thing is, well, a good thing! :-)

Yummy cakey cookies!I didn't have any cloves so i used a tsp. of ginger and all spice instead but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect and tasty! Anyone that didn't give this recipe five stars probably didn't do something right or just doesnt like the cakey texture of the cookie. i thought they were perfect! thanks for sharing your great recipe!

Good, soft cookies.  I like crunchy cookies, but realize there is no way to make a crunchy pumpkin cookie.  They needed some added spices, so I added extra.

These were good but not great. It was either missing something or had too much of something else.  The texture was great- soft and nicely formed.  I am actually surprised at such a high rating.

Very eay to make and so good too!  I made the recipe exactly as said this time and thought they were a wonderful, light cookie.  I think next time I might try and add raisins into the batter as it would make a nice addition.

For several years I have made varieties of cookies to give at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I have never received such oohs and ahs about a cookie like I have for these! I did bump up the cinnamon and nutmeg to about a tablespoon.  I omitted the cloves - only because I didn't have any in the pantry. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Perfect cookies, exactly what I was looking for. I preferred them unfrosted, but I was the only one. Delicious, moist, cake like spicy cookies. Mother in Law even asked for the recipe!

Wow! If everything was this easy and good, I'd cook more often! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, and a whole (15 oz) can of Libby's 100% pure pumpkin, just because I didn't want the leftover pumpkin. The cookies are moist and cake-like this way, more like a muffin, but absolutely delicious. With a whole can of pumpkin, I got 44 cookies out of the recipe. I also used finely chopped walnuts in the icing. They bake quick; cool quick; disappear quick, and are soft enough for my 18 month old granddaughter to eat, as she only has a few teeth.  Good source of vitamins in the pumpkin. We love them!!
Soooo easy!!!!!!!

This was our second year making these yummy cookies!  We first tried these last Christmas.   This year my 8 year old son picked these to make as his contribution to Thanksgiving dinner.  He added a little extra pumpkin. He also put semi-sweet chocolate chips to half the mix.  Once baked and cooled he iced some, and left some plain.  He dipped the whole top of the cookie in per one reveiwers suggestion.  Great tip!  He added chopped walnuts on some of the iced cookies.  The cookies were devoured at our Thanksgiving potluck and everyone raved about them!   They couldn't believe an 8 yr old made them!
We will be making these many more times this Holiday season!

Delicious!  Try adding a tsp or so of lemon juice to the icing, yum!  Only baked about 13 minutes, turned out perfect (but I think my oven is really hot).

Delicious!  These were so easy to make I had my two preschoolers do most of the work!  I made this with half whole wheat flour, half regular unbleached flour. Also  some brown sugar for the white sugar.  They are very soft and cake-like. They did not last long at our house!

These cookies were so good on their own that I decided not to ice them.  However, many of them stuck badly to the cookie sheet, a problem I haven't seen anyone else mention.  Strange.

These cookies came out pretty good (not a huge fan of the icing.)  I only iced half the cookies as I thought they tasted fine without it.  I froze most of these cookies.  They thawed wonderfully !  However, the iced ones were the most moist after freezing.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I would give this recipe six stars if I could! EVERYONE loved these cookies and I had to give them all away because I couldn't stop eating them. I made a double batch and added chocolate chips to half of it. I liked it better with the melty chocolate chips, but they were good w/o too, even without the icing! YUUUMMMM!!!

I have made this recipe four times now and even though I intend to serve them with dessert each time the entire batch has disappeared before dinner.  I follow the recipe exactly as is and the cookies are moist, cakey, full of flavor and now a family favorite.  I prefer them cold, but they're great any way.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I did take someone else's advice and added more pumpkin puree than it called for and the cookies turned out very moist. I didn't have cloves, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. I dont know some other people have had trouble with these coming out right because mine turned out great. They are super easy to make and everyone at my work loves them. I might try to put some cream cheese in with the icing ingredients next time. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Such yummy cookies!  Would perhaps next time add some chocolate chips!  Also, found that it's easier to ice the cookies if you dip them in (tops first!) to the icing, and it's mess free!

These are so good!  Very cake-like and I wish they were more dense, but I my kids and I ate a whole batch last night.  I think these would be good with white chocolate chips or raisins and chopped apples.  I was looking for a recipe to duplicate the Starbuck's Pumpkin Scones, but this was not it.  I will have to keep looking, but these are fantastic for what they are.

The cookies tasted pretty good but I didn't care for the texture.. really fluffy. Also, use plenty of the icing on each cookie unless you don't like sweet cookies.  However, they do fill your home with a wonderful aroma!!!!

This is the best cookie ever!  My kids ate them by the handfulls!
I used fresh cooked pumpkin. 
I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of brown suger for the white.  I also added 1 tsp of ginger but I'm not sure that was necessary.  
They are amazing!

I used fresh pumpkin for these cookies.  I made a double batch for Halloween, brought them to work, not only did all of them get eaten but I had at least 6 requests for me to make more.  The use of pulp from a sugar pumpkin made them even more exquisite-kids loved them too.

This cookie tastes great, even unfrosted. I replaced 1 cup APF with whole wheat flour with no deterimental effect. Adding chocolate chips, dried cranberries or chopped nuts would be another good variation.

These are very good pumpkin cookies.  I agree with others that they need to be fully frosted.  My favorite is Butter Cream Frosting Two, submitted by Kris, right here at allrecipes.

Good, but I was surprised that it's a dry cookie.  The dough was very sticky; refrigerating before baking didn't help much.  Excellent flavor, though.  I wonder if those who feel it's too spicy used pumpkin pie filling rather than puree.  The pie filling is pre-spiced with cinnamon and cloves.

This had a very good taste to it, but I would not consider this a cookie.  Like other reviewers have said, this is more like a tea cake than a cookie.

Really good! I was very impressed. Turned out better than I had hoped. Cookies were soft and moist on the inside and nicely baked on the outside. I added 4oz extra pumpkin.

My hard-to-please-I-only-like-chocolate-chip-cookies husband thought these were delicious.  We love the cakey texture!  We aren't huge icing fans, so next time I'll only make half of that, but it was wonderful!

Update: I have to admit to being a little disconcerted by a review that says they took this recipe and gave it to a restaurant to sell....and that they sell out. I don't mind posting recipes for home use but I would hope if a recipe got posted and used for sale that credit would be given!

Awesome every time I try it. My husband took them to work once and the employees are always asking when he will bring them next. When I have not had something on hand I have modified a little, but mostly use the recipe as is. Example was I was out of cloves but had apple pie spice exchanged. Also have used pumpkin pie filling (in a can, more sugar) instead of just pumpkin but didn't change anything else. Excellent.

These cookies turned out more "cakey" than I thought they would, and my family isn't very fond of "cakey" cookies, but the smell and taste were WONDERFUL!!! Everyone complemented these. Oh, and they went so quickly as I pulled them out of the oven, that I completely forgot about the icing until they were gone! Excellent dipped in milk, also! (at least I thought so)

Turned out very well, my boyfriend loved it.. although I found that halfing the icing recipe was just enough for what we needed. Will make again.

Wonderful cookies!  Great for Christmas.  My family loved them and they are a nice alternative to pumpkin pie.  Cookies turned out with almost a cakey texture- soft and delicous!  Thanks for sharing!!  Will be a holiday regular from now on!

These were perfect, soft pumpkin cookies.  I used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin and added chopped nuts and raisins, and they turned out delicious!!  This is a great recipe!!

They were ok....rather cakey, almost biscuity texture--I think they would be good as tea cakes or for an occasion like that. Not too sweet, and definitely best with the icing.

These were great!  I added raisins to the last portion of batter and those went first.  I will definitely make these again, but with raisins and maybe pecans also.

I really wasn't impressed with these cookies but my husband like them.  I thought they were quite bland.  If I made them again I might try Pumpkin Pie Puree instead of 100% pumpkin.

These cookies were a great way to use all the pureed pumpkin I had leftover from halloween. :) They were very yummy and went in no time. The second time, I added a little maple syrup to the icing and it was great also. Thanks for the recipe Gina.

This is an atractive fall cookie! Its not real sweet, but true pumpkin lovers really like it. I added cinn like others suggested. I also added cinn to the icing which gives it a nice color.

These cookies turned out really bland.  After making the first batch and tasting them, I added more cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and hazlenut syrup to the second batch to add more spice.  This helped, but still too bland for my taste buds.  Next time, I'm going to really watch how much pumpkin puree I add.  I think if I had added the exact 1 cup of pumpkin puree, the cookies would of turned out a lot better!!

In a word: delicious. The cookies spread out more than I expected them to while baking, and also make sure that you grease the cookie sheet(s). I added 1/4 t ginger and 1 c chocolate chips, and will be adding this to my permanant file.

Great cookies!  Very  moist and they looked good.  I added a cup of dark chocolate chips which I think complimented the pumpkin very nicely.  Half of the cookies were gone before I had a chance to ice them.

Soft, muffin-y cookie. Would like a bit more spice next time so I will increase the cinnamin and maybe put in some ginger. Also, raisins and/or walnuts would be great. The glaze was a hit with the kids (although I halved that part of the recipe and it was plenty).

Followed recipe exactly except added 1 15 oz. can of pumpkin and added 1 1/2 cups mini choc. chips, did not glaze, too hard to freeze like that glaze sticks to freezer bag.  Great way to sneak a veggie into your kids. Freeze them pop one out of freezer at room temp for 30 min.  still soft and tastes fresh baked.

This is a terrific recipe!  It is easy to make, and its true - kids and adults love it.  I am considered a mediocre cook (a transplanted yankee in the south) and these cookies changed that at Thanksgiving!  Now the best cook in the family is begging for these cookies at every dinner!  Thanks Gina.  PS:  trying a variation right now using part Splenda - will update on the turnout later.

I add a bag of Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Chips to this recipe, I do not put a glaze/icing on cookies.
Combine dry ingredients well, or you will taste the baking soda (I learned that the hard way).
Be prepared to take the recipe with you when introducing these cookies at parties.  I have made this recipe at least 15 times, everytime someone asks for the recipe.

These were an ABSOLUTE HIT! Made these instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. Soft-breadlike cookies! YUM~! I mixed in chocolate chips and pressed down the cookies w/ 1-2 dried cranberries in the center. (Did NOT do the icing, good enough w/o it) Baked beautifully, cranberries added a pretty touch. Didn't have *cloves*, so I added "All-Spice."  My cousin-in-law ate 8 cookies in a row!! AND that was BEFORE Thanksgiving Dinner~! ^.^

These were some of the best pumpkin cookies I have EVER had (except for my Mom's of course). Let's just say that everyone that tried them had more than one. The only thing I changed is that I added 1/2 c. chopped nuts and not having any cloves I used 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice (next time I think I will decrease the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp).  These were great though. I love you Gina!!!

These cookies are AWESOME!! My husband is very picky and he said this is his new favorite cookie. I've made them three times since I discovered the recipe two weeks ago. I would suggest adding raisins and chopped walnuts and doubling the recipe. They freeze very well. Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good. I was looking to duplicate a recipe that a bakery in Alaska makes, so like they do, I used a maple icing instead of vanilla. I inadvertently left out the salt, next time I make them I will be sure to remember the salt because they were a bit bland.  I also added some pumpkin pie spice (1/2 tsp) for just a hint of ginger.

I was not fond of these cookies, I gave them 5 stars because EVERYONE else who tried them loved them.(about 12 people) Maybe I am just a little to critical of my own baking!  They baked up more like a bread than a cookie.  I thought they where a little tasteless and tiny bit dry but everyone else said they where very good. I used fresh pumkin and  did not ice or frost them, I just dusted them with mixture of powered sugar and cinnamon

I didn't have nutmeg or ground cloves, so i added a pinch of ground ginger.  I also flattened the cookies after I took them out of the oven because the unbaked dough was too sticky.  These are great!  I have to admit they didn't look very appetizing, but the icing makes them look nice, and they are like mini moist pumpkin breads!

We used the equivalent of fresh pumpkin puree, it was very yummy! The whole family enjoyed them, and the kids liked making them. I recommend this recipe to everyone!

We just made these for Thanksgiving because my young daughters for some strange reason don't care for pie.  They're easy and delicious.  So delicious I'm afraid they might not make it to Thanksgiving!  I did make a few changes.  I used half white flour and half whole wheat pastry flour.  I used sucanat (organic sugar) in place of white in the cookies, and I used only 1 cup of it and they were plenty sweet enough especially with the icing.

These are delicious cookies. I ended up making another batch as I knew the first batch wouldn't last long. My house had a wonderfully spicy aroma while cooking them and afterwards. A great recipe!

Wonderful cookies!  I added ground ginger, chocolate chips, and left off the icing.  I baked them for 11 minutes - and they've been the hit of our autumny birthday party!  They stay nice and soft if moved into tupperwear after completely cooling.

My whole family did not like these wet cookies. NO matter how long I baked them for they were still wet inside.  No one wanted to eat them because it was like eating raw cookies.  I also put the icing on them in the last efforts to save them. The icing does not have a sweet taste at all. We are sorry to say but we will not be trying these again.

This recipe is good if you truly like cake-ish cookies. Very good pumpkin flavor but definitely make sure to use the glaze. Don't overcook or the cookies will be rubbery on the outside.

Very good, moist cake-like cookie!  Made the icing but only put on about 8 cookies, didn't particularly like the taste of the icing.  The cookie was fantastic, almost like a sweet pumpkin bread.  Only baked for 12 minutes, but have a hot oven.

Fortunately, I only brought two to work today... If I was home, they would be devoured! I also added chocolate chips to the last batch.. 
Excellent!

Wow, this recipe is wonderful. I made them last year for my family and everyone loved them. And I made them again for an office birthday just yesterday and got the most rave reviews. I have to agree, they are some of the best cookies ever. And not hard at all! I made them exhausted and they came out great...

These cookies are really good! Very soft and cakey. Be sure not to over cook them, though, they'll be hard. Fifteen to twenty minutes was a little long for my oven. I also wonder about using already prepared pumpkin spice instead of the combination that was listed. I might give it a try next time. Happy baking!

These tasted great and smelled absolutely wondeful baking! It might have just been me, but it seemed that the dough was kind of hard to work with. But it was worth it! I didn't even frost these they tasted so good already!

One word, FANTASTIC!!!  My mother who is the worst critic loved them.  I bake different types of cookies all the time and this is the only cookie that she has ever eaten and actually made a good comment.  This is definatelly a keeper.
