I love spinach, so therefore, this was a good recipe for me.  My children like raw spinach, not cooked, so I did the OBVIOUS adding it to a 1/4 of the caserole dish (using 1/4 spinach called for as well).  I used my own meat sauce, which also included sausage and that was a great addition.  This was an easy alternative to lasagna and I didn't have to hear 1 single complaint.  I think that the 8 oz. box of pasta is a mistake, I normally use 16 oz. and it feeds the 4 of us + the baby (I have what my husband would have eaten left over, as he is out of town on business[again]).  I will use this again, thanks Jo!!

Love anything with spinach, but this was a new and easier way to use it with Italian. I usually make a spinach lasagna, but this was way better and easier for my kids to eat.

This is a very good dish for entertaining.  I used fresh spinach and ricotta cheese.  I didn't really like the ricotta cheese added.  I think next time I will add italian sausage or ground beef.  The dish was really awesome.

I substituted farfalle for the mostacciolli and made the spaghetti sauce from scratch using fresh tomatoes--which are in season. I also substituted fresh spinach rather than frozen.  I served this to half a dozen non-vegetarians and they thought it was quite good and didn't realize this was a meatless dish. I will definitely make this again in the future.

This is yummy and very easy. Next time, I think I'll throw a little crushed red pepper in the sauce, just to give it a little kick. Maybe play around with different cheeses as suggested, or maybe even add mushrooms. I like a recipe with many possibilities. Thanks for this one!

One question for one of the reviewers below. Why on earth, if you don't like cooked spinach, would you choose a recipe with cooked spinach as the *main ingredient*, then give it one star for having cooked spinach?? Think about it.

This is a very quick and easy-to-prepare meal that just about everyone will enjoy-the spinach gives it a 'florentine' Italian flair. The only thing that I would modify in the recipe is to add less spinach..not everyone in my family liked all the spinach (I did though), but it is easy enough to pick out if need be. This recipe would also be really good with vegetarian sausage added...also makes great leftovers!

Simple and very good.  Subbed fresh spinach for the frozen- made ahead and assembled,  froze it and then baked for 1 hour 15 minutes on 375- covered.
thanks Jo!

This was ok...I think if I would have used a different sauce I would have given it a "5".  I also think that this can be mixed all together instead of layered...maybe just a cheese layer to make it cheesy like it was this time. I didn't really care for the "layer" of spinach either. We do like spinach in dishes like this, so next time I will use a better sauce and mix the spinach in...I'm sure it will get a "5" then! Thanks so much for the idea! I am always looking for new meat free pasta dishes other than spaghetti! :-)

I added about a 1/2 cup of ricotta, some oregano & garlic salt and mixed it in with the mozzarella and the spinach all together.  I also used whole wheat fusilli and it definitely could use more pasta with this amount of sauce.  But overall it was a great recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was a little bland for my taste. I probably need to make the sauce from scratch, or use a different jarred sauce with a little more flavor.

We were not pleased with the spinach flavor in this. There was too much spinach for us maybe? It overpowered the Italian sausage we used. If I had it to do over I'd maybe use a blender to blend the spinach into the sauce, but I won't try it again to find out if I like that better, because this wound up being a waste of money for us because we could not finish it :(

Decent recipe. I added a half pound browned ground turkey that I had on hand. It was nice for a change.

I made some pretty major revisions so that it would be good for my family. I added ground turkey to the sauce and used fresh spinach (about 1/2 of what was called for.) and layered it as per the recipe. The major thing was that my husband couldnt find Mostaccioli so I used whole wheat penne pasta instead. Because of the layering it had the allusion of a lasagana or a traditional pasta bake but because I used healthier subsitutions I think it was a good healthy alternate.

Serving this recipe will make people think you actually know what you are doing in the kitchen. I am the least domestic person I know.  This was quick and easy and my family loved it.  I also threw in some hamburger.

This was a great Mostaccioli recipe.  The spaghetti sauce I had didn't have any meat, but we didn't even miss it.  Even my son liked it.  Definately a keeper!

This came out pretty good. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  It seemed a bit dry after baking for 30 min, so I added a little more sauce on top before putting the cheese and spinach on top.  I also sprinkled the top with oregano before putting it back into the oven.  Thanks for the recipe:)

This recipe definitely lends itself to modifications.  Used mushrooms instead of onions, added some moringa leaves to spinach, also added cooked spinach and asiago chicken sausage.  Easily made gluten free and my hubby loved it.

This recipe is very easy to make and is very good.  I made it when we had a ton of guests overâ€¦ made it the day before they came so I just needed put it in the oven.  I added chicken which complimented the recipe just fine.  It was a hit!

It was just okay. The leftovers didn't reheat very well. 
Also, the measurements for mazzerella cheese are off. I doubled it and it still seemed off. Also the spinach mix didn't spread well over the noodles.

Easy and delicious!  I used Trader Joe's Three Cheese sauce which added great flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

This was so yummy and very kid (and husband) friendly!  My five picky eaters all enjoyed it and asked for more.  Very easy and fast to make.  I finished cooking it in the microwave for about 10 minutes instead of the oven, just to speed it up.  Turned out great.

Next time I will experiment by adding cottage cheese and maybe ground turkey to make it a lasagna-like dish.

I made this for my family and they all loved it! I doubled it so there would be leftovers, but beware it requires quite a bit of sauce.

Very good.  The only thing I did differently was used fresh spinach because I didn't have canned on hand.  Delicious and satisfying.

Yummy! I wanted something spaghetti-like, but different.. And this was perfect! It's great to be able to sneak the spinach into the kid's meal. I seasoned the spinach before layering in the dish. Other than that, I followed the recipe almost exactly (omitted Parmesan as we're out). The recipe is perfect as written! Thanks for a great recipe!

I also doubled the amount of pasta and used a lot more mozzarella.  I think some ricotta would have been good in it, like a baked ziti with spinach.  Overall it was very good and I will make it again!

My family and I LOVED this dish! I added garlic and crushed red peppers, as suggested by others.  I also used 16 ounces of pasta, 32 ounces spaghetti sauce, and 2 packages of spinach. This is definitely a keeper!

Pretty good.  Needs more spinach!  Next time I'll definitely add more spinach but aside from that it's your basic ziti.

Pretty good - doubled the recipe, but I may not have had enough sauce. Next time I will try spicing up the spinach, and making sure my suace is highly spiced too as the flavors seemed to melt away.
