10.18.17  Like the combination of ingredients in this smoothie, that little bit of grated ginger adds another very interesting layer of flavor, and the lemon juice brightens it up.  Found this very thick, so I did add more vanilla almond milk, but everybody has a different preference for smoothie texture.  Very nice smoothie.

Really good smoothie. I liked the lemon and ginger, very refreshing. I also added more almond milk to the recipe.
