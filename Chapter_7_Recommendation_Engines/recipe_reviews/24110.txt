I lost my original French Silk recipe and needed one in a hurry.  I printed off
this version without really looking at it.  It called for 2 cups of butter and I am
wondering if it was meant to read 2 STICKS of butter.  Also, the eggs called for
are not listed in the ingredients, but at least I remembered it took 2.  The 
consistency turned out very thickand solid, not light and fluffy, that's why I think the 
amount of butter called for is wrong.  I knew there was something not quite right,
but I had waited until the last minute, and thought maybe it was just me.
The people at my Easter dinner tried one bite, and went straight for the 
cake I baked instead.

This is twice the ingredients to a recipe our family has made for years, with exception of 2 c. buter. I believe, too, that it's meant to be 2 STICKS & not CUPS. Our recipe calls for 1 stick, 3/4c sugar & 2 eggs. We make it for EVERY special occasion!

I have beeen making this pie for a very long time and my family loves it!  But the amount of butter you called for is way to much and should be called down to two sticks of real butter.

Excellent if you like rich chocolate desserts. Easy to make, and I always beat each egg for 5 minutes as recommended. Recipe overfills a 10 inch graham cracker crust.

Too much butter and eggs. Cutting it down to two sticks is a good idea and 2 maybe 3 eggs instead of 4

Turned out perfect. My family loved it! I did beat each egg for 5 minutes. This recipe made a lot! Will make it again. Used 2 sticks of butter not 2 cups!

This pie is awesome and very, very rich. It has gotten rave reviews where ever I take it. It is so easy to make and inexpensive as well. I added a layer of whipped topping over the pie.

This is certainly a very very very rich dessert; I didn't want to tell my guests how much butter I put in it because I was afraid that would scare them from trying it. It was good, but I don't think it needed as much butter as the recipe called for.

I too was worried about the amount of butter. I read some of the reviews and some cut the butter down to 1 cup so I did that. But after whipping it I found I needed the full 2 cups of butter in order to fill my Pyrex fluted glass pan. Tasted great! Not too buttery at all. I also used 4 eggs which again worked perfect for me. If I were you I would try it the orginial way the first time and then makes any changes you feel are neccessary. I don't think this pie needs whipped cream either but that's just my taste. :-)

I love this recipie!  It has turned out perfect everytime and everyone raves about it!  I used 2 sticks of butter but followed the rest of the recipe.  I think the trick is beating for the full 5 minutes after each egg.  I've never had a grainy taste to it, its always been smooth as silk.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was very rich.  It was not like a French Silk pie that I've had before.  The texture seemed a little firm for French Silk.  It looked like an Ice cream filling.  Also the chocolate flavor was not enogh so I added some chocolate hersheys syrup.  Which made it very taste good.  But again the texture was what was weird to me.

Wonderful recipe.  Super easy to make, just takes time.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave on 50% power, I find this to be easier.  I also used Splenda sugar blend in place of the sugar, and it turned out perfect.

This pie looked beautiful and tasted great too at Thanksgiving.  Some of my family thought it was too sweet, but I love sweet flavors so I was very pleased with it. No one turned it down and some had seconds!

Used only two STICKS of butter. Made sure to mix for 5 minutes after each egg. Topped with real whipped cream. I've made this numerous times - so rich and so good!

Good flavor but I'm not certain I'd bother making it again. I followed the recipe except for reducing the butter to 2 sticks  instead of 2 lbs. I also used baker's sugar and pasteurized eggs, for added food safety. Unfortunately, despite using an extra fine sugar, it had a gritty consistency and it also came out overwhelmingly sweet. The relatively light brown color was disappointing for what should have been a rich chocolate pie.

This is definately a TOP 5 decadent dessert.  This is one of my husbands favorites.  Anyone I have ever served this to raves about it. Take the time to make sure you beat the eggs in well; it should have no sugar grit, and should feel and look like silk.

This pie was great.  Fluffy and rich. Beat butter (two cups) and sugar together for at least five min., until light and fluffy.  I melted chocolate in microwave and then let it cool until it was thick but pourable, so as not to melt the butter.  I used Egg Beaters (two small cups, the equivilent of four eggs) and beat them in in four additions.  Used a whisk attachment on my Kitchenaid.  The pie is fluffy and rich, tastes great.  More than enough for a pie shell.  Will make a mousse with excess, beating it into whipped cream.

i thougth i lost my g-ma's recipe but here it is and yes 2 sticks not 2 cups. really good pie makes your head blow up with chocolatyness. to combat the grainyness leave the chocolate on the warmer side of luke warm it will help disolve the sugar.

The problem with this recipe is obvious. It's not that there is too much butter and eggs. It's that you need another pie crust!  It makes 2 pies. Half the recipe if you only want one pie. Love it!

This is outstanding.  I used half baking choc. & 1/2 cocoa powder, it get's a 4 star because it has to be doubled.  I used a pastry crust, next time I'd use a cookie crust.

This is my (and my family and friends) very favorite recipe. I DO NOT bake, and we are all chocoholics. So good and easy!!!  One trick I got from another review- the ultra fine sugar makes a big difference. And I use graham cracker crusts, because we aren’t that fond of pie crust. I then thaw whipped cream and use that with shaved chocolate on top to decorate. Can not endorse enough!!!

Like other reviewers, I also only used 2 STICKS (1 cup) butter and 3 eggs.  It was very rich and a little grainy even though after each egg I beat it 5 minutes each then an extra 5 after the third, so next time I will definitely cut the sugar to 1 cup.
