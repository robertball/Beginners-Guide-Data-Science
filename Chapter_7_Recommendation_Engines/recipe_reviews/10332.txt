These cookies turned out really well, and the almonds helped to balance out the sweetness. I think I'll reduce the sugar a bit next time so they aren't too rich for my taste.

I decided to roll these out instead of slicing them. Based on the previous review suggesting that they were a bit sweet, I figured that I would be safe in kneading in a bit more flour and rolling the dough out on a floured surface - it was a good call. I then took an almond slice and pressed it into the center of each cookie. They baked up in 8 minutes, spreading slightly. They are chewy with crisp bottoms, a good spiced cookie! Thank you Iris!

This recipe is from the Betty Crocker Cookbook from 1949. It is a Christmas tradition. I usually leave out the nuts.

the original recipe called for 1/2 C butter and 2 C flour. I've been making these for over 60 years!  They are one of our favorite cookies. I always make a quadruple batch as everyone wants to take some home.
 Wonderful cookie.

These cookies were delicious and easy to make! I thought they wouldn't hold together without eggs, but it worked out well.

I have this recipe in my Betty Crocker book also! I love them and they can be made as drop cookies as well if you like a soft chewy cookie. I like them sliced the old fashioned way and nice and thin so they are crispy. But I like crispy cookies myself! They are great with all different kinds of nuts like walnuts or pecans. I usually leave out the nuts also though because they are always too expensive for me to keep on hand. I wonder how they would be with candied fruits and less sugar?

Amazing cookies! Every one in my house loved them. I barley got 1! I will be making these again for sure.
