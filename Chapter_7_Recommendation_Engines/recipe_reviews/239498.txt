I used Cod and this method worked well - I do this often but the 'sauce' wasn't quite right or maybe it is just because we like traditional tartar sauce.   Whatever seasonings you use, this method will work well.  Makes for a really fast and tasty dinner.

Easy to make and it turned out perfectly.  Crispy outside, tender and moist inside.  I used shredded Parmesan cheese instead of the grated. I think it made for a prettier presentation.  My husband loved it.

Good stuff!  I added a little smoky chili spice, not much but tunes it up. Point is, it can take a little of anything you have in your spice rack to bring it up in flavour a bit.

I used Salmon cubed and it was wonderful. I think even kids would eat this but not yet kid tested.

I only had salmon fillets on hand so I used that. I was out of eggs so I rolled them in olive oil. It turned out great !

I didn't make the sauce, just the fish. But it turned out pretty good.  Dipped in yum yum which is close to this sauce anyway.  I found no need for the egg and flour, can just coat in panko/cheese/herbs.
