I made this for my Aunt who is a diabetic.  She loved it, so did her husband.  This pie taste better than any other sweet potato pie that I have made with regular sugar.  This will be the only one I make from now on.

I absolutley loved this filling. I made the cream cheese pie crust and filled it with this mixture. Thanks for a great sugar free pie! I will be making this over and over again!
