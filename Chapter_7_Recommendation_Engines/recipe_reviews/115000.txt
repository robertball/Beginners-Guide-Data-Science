I put in some whole wheat flour in place of some of the bread flour, and used 1/2 cup honey in place of the sugar.  Realistically, this makes 3 or 4 loaves, not just 2!  Great taste!  I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the salt in the topping!  I braided both loaves differently, for variety's sake!  I'll be making this again!

Delish!  First time ever making a braided bread and I'm so happy with the results.  It was light and fluffy and sweet.

I used my bread machine to mix the dough and it was pretty tricky since it was overflowing, but I'm glad I did it! I let it cycle through the dough setting while following the directions until Step 2 when I took it out and let it rise in a huge bowl. My loaves looked like they came from a fancy bakery! I love the way the inside is twisted and has an airy texture. I'm going to make it again and serve it with veggie cream cheese!

I was very happy to find a recipe that was exactly what I was looking for..."everything" bread, and I've made challah for years.  It was very good, but my garlic and dried onions came out kind of burned.  I'll just need to tweak my cooking temp/time a little, or maybe spray the loaves with cooking spray after putting on the topping.  I will definitely be making this again.  My family loved it.

This was so easy to make and looked so beautiful that I felt bad cutting into it!  Everyone in the family loved this bread and so did the neighbours.  Since there was 2 large loaves we had one to share.

this is the only water challah recipe i could find on this site, & we've tried it with & without the seasonings. it's ok with, but i think it's better without. either way, it's a tasty water-challah recipe!

Excellent tasting bread.  My braid pulled apart some, but it tasted fine.  Very flavorful!

Good Bread But it sure does not taste like Challah, there is no richness to it. It taste like a lite bagel

I just took the challah out of the oven. The WHOLE house full of the spices' smells and it reminds me of old times, Shabbat dinner with my family. 
It's just perfect :-)
