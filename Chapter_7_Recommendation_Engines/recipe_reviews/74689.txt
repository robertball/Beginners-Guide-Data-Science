I have been drinking these for a couple of years now -- it MUST be Crown Royal though -- anything else wrecks the flavor.  Add a couple "DROPS" of Goldschlager and it becomes a Washington Apple Pie -- with the cinnamon flavor.  Just a couple of these and you won't need anything else for the night...  Another idea, add Pineapple Juice instead of Cranberry Juice for a "Golden Delicious Apple".  YUMMMMM...

This is my favorite Martini but I use Sour Apple Vodka, Crown Royal,and Cranberry juice. The Crown Royal is what makes the drink.

Out of all 3 jugs of martini's I set out at my party this one was the most popular.  We call it a Washington Apple. The whiskey that you use makes a difference. You MUST use Crown Royal for the whiskey. Delicious!

This is pretty good. The 1st time I had a Washington Apple was last night @ Bistro Bistro in Arlington,Va. I tried to re-create it based on their ingrediants which is very close to your recipe:
  1 oz Crown Royal
  1 oz Sour Apple Pucker
  1/2 oz DiSaronno Amaretto
  2 oz Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktl
  1 Maraschino cherry and splash of juice

shake with ice in martini shaker ;)
serve in martini glass with cherry.
They are very smooth. Yum.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!! I'm enjoying one right now (great with amaretto!!)

My new daughter-in-law introduced the family to these as shots at Christmas.  Although I normally don't like anything apple flavored except pie, I loved these!  She insisted on using Crown Royal whiskey, although when we ran out, we had one round with Jack Daniels - a little strong, but good!  Even helped my bronchitis!! Heh!

We make these for tailgating shots. For a more apple flavor. Use apple juice instead of cranberry.

I prefer using Canadian Club as it is smoother than Crown Royal due to the aging process and ofcourse you must use the Sour Apple Pucker. So yummy!!!!!

Delicious!  And I don't even like whiskey much!  I used Canadian Club Whiskey (what I could afford).  The whiskey definitely helps the martini taste like natural apple, instead of candy apple, like most other apple martinis.  I think I will make my apple martinis like this from now on.  Much more sophisticated!

I liked it although it is strong.  I could definitely taste the Crowne but not in an unpleasant way.  Served this at a party along with other martinis and the guys tended to be drawn to this instead of the fruitier "girly" drinks.

I have seen this made two ways One with Crown, Apple Pucker and Cranberry, the other is with Gray Goose, Apple Pucker and Cranberry. It depends on if you like whiskey or vodka.

AMAZING...this really DOES taste like a red delicious apple!!  I usually prefer green apple martinis but I had some Canadian whiskey so I figured I'd give it a try.  Very, very good!

This was quite tasty! I have never had one, but lately have been looking for new drinks because of a cocktail party I will be hosting. This will definitely be one of the drinks offered! I even tried it with Goldschlager like one person mentioned and that was wonderful as well! I definitely used Crown Royal though, I don't think any other whiskey would have been as good.

It was ok. I followed the recipe exactly and found the sour apple schnapps to be very overpowering. Possibly the combination of the cranberry and sour apple flavors was just not appealing to me. My husband had the same flavor issues with the drink that I had.

I've been a bartender for 14 years and this sounded interesting. I used sour apple sour puss since I didn't have apple schnapps and it did not turn out right.  I put it in tall glass and added apple juice to try to save it. I will not be remaking this

It was like tasting fall in a glass.  It was perfect for me, but for others I had to cut down the whiskey to half.    Also I used a really good bourban that I liked instead.   Woodridge Reserve.

This was great! I used green apple pucker...not sure if that's the same but it was still great. Used Black Velvet for the whiskey. Good flavor, a bit strong for a lightweight like me but we still enjoyed them.

This recipe was just okay. I used Royal Crown Whiskey, Sour Apple Pucker, and Welch's Cranberry Juice. I was expecting a martini that had a real red apple taste, and this did not. The taste of the sour apple schnapps was very dominant, so whether or not you like that flavor will probably determine how you feel about this drink.

Sounds good but would it be better if you used a Apple Schnapps instead of the Sour Apple Scnapps? I know of a really great one by Berentzen.

This recipe is great - it tastes just like an apple.  I was introduced to this drink a few weeks ago by a friend, and will be bringing it all my holiday parties.  I specifically use Crown Royal, but I'm sure any whiskey will do!

This tastes EXACTLY like a juicy red delicious apple.  Perfect!  I've had it with vodka, apple juice and grenadine, but this was much more delicious!  I used Canadian Club.
Thank you!

The whiskey was very overpowering.  I had to add extra cranberry and apple schnapps to tone down the taste.  Then it was very good although I still prefer the standard vodka green apple martinis.
