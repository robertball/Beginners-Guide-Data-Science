Haven't made it yet, but it seems interesting. The amount of seasoning is certainly not to my liking, but a few simple adjustments to this recipe can fix that. Overall, a very interesting use of tahini, one of the few recipes with it I could find involving beef, and definitely something I plan to both make and expand on. Thanks! I'll change this review a bit and add a picture once I make it myself, and include any alterations I saw fit to make. I pretty much just intend to add a lot more seasoning to it and include some instructions on how to make a better rice dish to serve this with in lieu of plain rice. Needs some vegetables in my opinion. Definitely a solid method for preparing beef with tahini though and it's inspired me to create a more complex version of my own.
