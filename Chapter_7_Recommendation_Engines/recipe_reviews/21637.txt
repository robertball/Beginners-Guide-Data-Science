This recipe is a must keep for coconut lovers and best of all is easy to make. It is creamy and sweet with the right hint of rum.

The only comment I have is that the recipe calls for 'can shredded coconut'. I could not find that in any store around my house, so I used the shredded coconut that comes in a bag and that worked perfect.

This was a very interesting recipe. It seems to be a combination coconut cream pie/custard/flan. Because I prefer a creamy custard I substituted evaporated milk with 1/2 whipping cream, 1/2 vanilla soy milk. I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut and bagged coconut flakes because they don't sell canned coconut flakes in syrup here. I put the glass pan on a towl in a deep cookie sheet which I placed in the oven and filled with water for even heating. After an hour, the custard was pale and beautifully cooked, so I sprinkled some white sugar (1/4 cup) on the top and broiled it on high until the top was golden and crunchy. Then I cooled it and refrigerated it for 2 hours. Lovely creamy custard with a sweet crunchy top.

Everyone who liked coconut, liked this recipe.  Those who did not like coconut hated this recipe.  The only thing I will change next time, is I will add less flaked coconut.  I thought it took away from the texture.  
**For all those having a difficult time finding Cream of Coconut, look in the liquor isle with the Pina Colada mixes.  That is where I found it

I really enjoy coconut so I gave this a try.  I had to use coconut milk in place of the cream of coconut and added a 7 oz package of flaked coconut since I've never seen coconut in syrup.  This would have been good with or without the flaked coconut.  Similar to flan, but not as firm.  Still, this was not too heavy and made a nice after dinner dessert.  Thanks for sharing Tanya.

I love coconut but hated this.  I could barely taste coconut over the rum.  I gave it 2 stars because my husband liked it.

Wow.  What a great dessert.  This is fantastic for serving to dinner guests.  It is a nice quality dish without being expensive or difficult to make.  Especially wonderful because it can be made a day or two in advance.

Rum minimizes all other flavors too much. This recipe is much much better without the additon of the rum. I remember my mother making his for us as children, give it a try  but w/o rum your results will be sweeter and the coconut flavor will be present.

This is definitely a dessert for the coconut lover.  Too much for others.  So, if you like coconut style bars... go for it!  If you want more of a pie, pass this receipe for another.

Outstanding!  Donâ€™t underestimate the plain look of this most delicious dessert with a crisp top layer and a flan-like inside. It was very easy and quick to make.

Not good at all, I have good luck with all the recipes I have tried,  so I know it was not something I did wrong, plus Im Puerto Rican so I know alot about flan.  This was not even close.  It tasted too much like rum, too much coconut and the texture was not creamy or custardy.

I have to give this 5 stars because I made it for my husband who is a coconut lover and he was in heaven!  I like cocount, not as much as him, so I did enjoy this dessert, but it is definitely enjoyed best by coconut lovers.  I think it would also be really good baked with a pie crust.

This was so easy to make and is great for coconut lovers.  I did use the flaked coconut also because I couldn't find any in a can, and it turned out great.  Seems like it would be really good in some kind of a pastry shell.  I may try that next time.

WOW is right! This may well be my first review and I've used a lot of recipes from allrecipes.  This is fantastic!  And forgiving. I adjusted....  did not add rum; used dried unsweetened and sweetened coconut instead of the canned coconut;  used skim evaporated milk. Was doing some cupboard cleaning. Didn't even use an electric mixer, just a whisk.  So easy.  Fantastic recipe!  Top with whipped cream and I think fresh berries would be nice.

I made this recipe for my sister and her husband who are coconut fanatics. They loved it--personally, i would have liked it better with less coconut flakes in it.

This is a wonderful dessert. I actually made it twice and I must say that the ingredients you go with make all the difference. The first time I made this recipe it was not too good, but I think that is because I went with a coconut butter instead of the grated coconut in syrup (I couldn't find that anywhere). The result: the dessert was too rich and tasted too oily.

The second time I really searched for ingredients that more closely matched what the recipe actually calls for. In the end, I found some really good cream of coconut and unsweetened shredded coconut at Whole Foods. Like others, I omitted the rum. The end result of my 2nd attempt was a delicious, sublime flan-like dessert. What I liked was that the dessert wasn't too sweet and the coconut in the dessert body was shredded and not flaked. That gave it very nice consistency. I topped it off with strawberries and whipped cream.
