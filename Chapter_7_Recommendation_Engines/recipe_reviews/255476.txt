The galette turned out well, the apples were crunchier than in a normal pie, and they held up really well. The pie crust tastes really good. The outer crust may just be the best part! However I cannot emphasize enough, use this crust! It is delicious! You may think that sour cream in the crust is strange, however the taste makes it our new go to!

Truly the star here is the crust recipe. The recipe in general is tasty and worth baking but keep it in your favorites as a go-to for a truly spectacular crust!

I made it, it tasted great BUT, dealing with a dough made with sour cream made for a very tasty crust, but one that,  for me, was IMPOSSIBLE to roll out.  I ended kneading it for almost an hour on a floured surface until I got it to 14" in diameter.  From there, getting it onto the parchment paper- lined baking sheet was "a piece of cake".  And NO,  as tasty as it was, life is way too short to try this one twice.

Great rustic recipe. I baked mine on a pizza stone and it turned out fabulous! The crust is very flaky and good.
