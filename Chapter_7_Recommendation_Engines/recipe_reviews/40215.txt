I made some changes to this, since we are not huge fans of whole chickens.  I covered and roasted just the potatoes for 40 minutes.  I then used the rub on four chicken breasts which I browned for two minutes per side, then I added them to the pan with the potatoes for another 25 minutes.  It was delicious and very spicy!

I found this recipe really tasty.  The only thing I changed was to use a whole bird, and add the juice of half a lime UNDER the skin before cooking.  This seems to keep the bird really moist and compliments the Mexican spices.  Super taste!

Didn't care for the potatoes (baked them in a separate dish) but the chicken was outstanding. Great blend of flavors. Used canned chipotle peppers (two and some of the extra sauce from the can), added extra olive oil and water along with the other seasonings and put all in a blender. I just poured everything on top of the chicken. Husband liked the combination of spicy yet sweet. I love hot and spicy foods and this is a hot one. Don't think kids would like this at all.

This is a simple dish with excellent results. I made it twice in one week. I suggest you parboil the potatoes first. You may also adjust the chipotle seasoning as desired. The second time I made it with chicken strips dredged in the seasonings with 2 tbsp. of olive oil and no potatoes. Wonderful, quick and fast. I just might make it again tonight!!!

I used canned chipotle in adobo sauce; mixed the sauce with the dry spices and rubbed it on the chicken then stuffed the whole peppers under the skin before roasting to get more flavor.  I also found it helpful to keep the the chicken and potatoes covered with foil about 3/4 of the way through the cooking time to prevent burning. My husband and I like our chicken with a little zing to it and this is an easy way to spice it up.

I absolutely loved this recipe, but it was a little too hot for my husband and son. This recipe is going to seem too hot to all but the most devoted fans of spicy food.  I'll probably cut the chipotle in half next time.

As suggested by a previous reviewer, I parboiled my potatoes before starting this recipe, and I'm very glad I did.  The potatoes would not have been done at the same time as the chicken otherwise.

I'm still giving this recipe five stars, because it is absolutely perfect for those who like it hot.

Pretty quick and decent....I cut the potatoes up about 1 inch cubed and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Only took 35 baking time.  I left it covered w/ the foil the whole time. I also used garlic powder insted of garlic salt....was great!

My husband is not a fan of chicken but this he rated highly.  I used 3 boneless/skinless chicken breasts and separated the chicken and potatoes for roasting by foil.  I did not add the fresh cilantro at the end.  It was delicious and is a definite keeper recipe.  Thank you!

This was good; husband thought it was great. A little too spicy for my taste, though. I will cut back on the chili pepper powder next time.

I found whole, dried chipotle chiles which I ground myself; it is essential chipotles are used in this recipe.  This makes a delicious, moist chicken that is so super easy.  It's the perfect amount of spice balanced with a little sweet.

We really liked this dish, including my 13 month old daughter.  I did cut back on the chile pepper (to 1 t.) and I used boneless/skinless breasts (all I had in the freezer).  A keeper!

Awesome recipe.  Make sure you rub the seasoning under the skin too.  I did these on the grill and they turned out even better! YUM!

Excellent! I didn't have chipotle chile pepper on hand, so I used 1tsp of chili powder and 1/2tsp red pepper in its place. I also skipped the garnish. Turned out fantastic! My family loved it.

This was very yummy! I cooked the potatoes for about 40 minutes before adding the chicken. Next I added the seasoned skinless boneless breasts and cooked for an additional 30 minutes. Very easy.

Overall, a good recipe but if you don't like it spicy, cut back on the chipotle pepper. We grilled the chicken and roasted the potatoes and it turned out great. Also, red potatoes work better than white.

Absolutely delicious! I cooked the potatoes in a separate pan with onion, which gave it good flavor. I covered the chicken with the fresh cilantro immediately after pulling it from the oven to infuse some of its flavor. This chicken would also taste great with red beans and rice.

I liked the flavor of all the spices. However, the recommended amounts make it very spicy in my opinion. Will probably adjust the amount of Chipotle next time.

I just made this recipe and everyone loved it.  I didn't find the Chipotle Chili Peppers and use a bit of Chipotle Peppers in adobo sauce that I had. It was really flavorful, so tasty.  The potatoes tasted awesome too.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make and flavorful.  I was a little afraid of the amount of chipotle used so cut back a bit.  Next time I will use all of it.  The potatoes had a wonderful flavor.

I just made the chicken (used bone-in thighs). I cut back a bit on the Chipotle powder but followed the recipe otherwise. It was still way too spicy for me, but Husband loved it. Served it with plain white rice, and a pinto bean dish. Good stuff. Thanks!

The potatoes turned out good, but the chicken ended up being way too spicy. I like spicy foods, but this was too much. Next time I will cut down on the chiptole seasoning maybe by about half.

Much better when prepared using 5 chicken thighs trimmed of most of the skin. Don't forget to season under the skin! I make 8 small white potatoes cubed and microwaved for 15 minutes before adding the spices. I use about 2/3 of the seasoning on the potatoes and the rest(after adding the brown sugar) on the chicken. Then bake altogether (it usually takes about 55 minutes) and it comes out delicious.

Really good, but extremely hot skinned bird. I had to substitute cumin seed for ground cumin, and it had a weird, but good smokey cumin flavor to it.

Works better with canned chipotle peppers in abode sauce.  You only end up using a fraction of a whole can, but if you like it really spicy, you can use the remaining whole peppers to pack around the chicken while baking.

I also recommend marinating the chicken for about an hour.  To help get the full flavor be sure to make small slits in the meat with the tip of a sharp knife before rubbing in the pepper mixture.
