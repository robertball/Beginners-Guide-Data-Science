I just made these firtters because I had a leftover lobster tail, 4 claws and body"meat".  I must say, they are quite tasty and finding this lovely gluten-free recipe was a bonus for me!  I did use the extra lobster meat mentioned above because I didn't want the fritters to be too "bready".  I followed the recipe ingredients very closely other than not adding salt; next time I'm going to add finely chopped sweet red pepper.  I crushed the GF crackers in my small food processor so that they were very fine.  I used my deep iron frying pan and didn't need a quart of oil - just poured in about 1 inch.  Just tasted one so I could write this review - delish!  Even without sauce, although I'll whip up something to serve it with later.  I plan on freezing some as this recipe made about 34 nice sized fritters.  Thanks for a great GF gourmet fritter!

These were sooo good! I used imitation crab instead of the lobster. I can only imagine what they would taste like with lobster. Wonderful. Thank you so much for the gluten free recipe.

Instead of going thru trouble of cooking & chopping up a lobster tail, I substituted a can of pink crabmeat.  Every guest raved about this hors d'oeuvre.  The receipe is a definite keeper!!!
