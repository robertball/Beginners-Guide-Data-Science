You have to keep in mind this is suppose to be a healthier alternative to regular pasta, so if you don't like wheat pasta, don't use it.  I was searching for a recipe I could use up the rest of my organic wheat pasta on.  I truly liked this.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I'll make it again.

Excellent recipe and easy weeknight dinner. I tossed chicken pieces with flour, garlic powder, and pepper before cooking in oil. Otherwise, won't change a thing!
