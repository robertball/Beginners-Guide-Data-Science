This isn't a bad recipe, I've used it twice. A tad messy the first time, just be careful and make sure the oil doesn't get to hot quick, otherwise the rings fry really quick, and they're not done completely.

Followed the recipe with no changes and the onion rings were great.  However, I scaled the ingredients for the batter down to 3 servings and did pickle spears instead of onions.  We now have a new family favorite!

Loved the cornmeal coating!!! Turned out fantastic! Will make these again. I did leave out the thyme as I am currently in Turkey and the thyme I find here is a bit different. Otherwise a fantastic onion ring and rather easy! I thinking I may modify the coating to fit it for chicken poppers!

I thought these were going to be a disaster when I first started making them. The coating doesn't stay on that well if the rings are very thick, so I'd cut them between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. Once they were cooked though, they were quite good. Even my 8 year old said.... I don't like onion rings, but these are great.

Husband said best he ever had!  The cornmeal makes it so crunchy yet they are still light.  The Vidalias we had were so sweet and mild tasting compared to the typical onion taste.  WOW!

This recipes is really good. When I dipped them twice in the cornmeal batter, they turned out even better. The crust was much thicker and cruncher. My husband ate most of them and there were no left overs. I reduced the recipe to 3 servings and used 1 medium to large onion and it was the perfect amount for two people.

A real treat and they cook up perfectly. The only issue is that they never make it to the table because everyone runs out to the fryer and eats them as I cook them. This is a great recipe!

After I made this and made a huge mess, I realized I will add the flour for the first coat TO the milk, then dredge in the cornmeal mix. More like batter...just a thought

I made these for a July 4th cookout.  They were a hit!  Not hard to make but they are time consuming. I wouldn't make them too often because of this, but the recipe is definitely a keeper. Next time, I would spice them up a bit more.

These were delicious and really crunchy!  I subbed soy milk for dairy milk, and only added salt and paprika to the cornmeal mixture (ommitting the other spices).  Everyone loved them.

Nice crunchy onion rings and the batter doesn't fall off. Left out the thyme since I didn't have it, but the paprika, sugar, and pepper give it a nice flavor. Yum!

Simple and tasty.  I added a little beer to thin out the breading a bit.

I tried this recipe and it was the best onion rings I've ever made! They came out perfect. I adjusted the seasonings to what I had on hand and they were still great. I'm keeping this one for a long time!

Instead of milk, I used buttermilk AND most importantly, I let the rings soak in cold water in the fridge for a couple of hours. Ideally I would have left them soaking in the water over night. 
Nonetheless, they turned out perfectly and so crunchy and as good as any diner.
Very helpful to coat them ALL and have them sitting on a tray. 
Total time, including prepping the onions, coating, cook time, all told, about an hour.
I will definitely make these again!
