ok, so I found this place that has huge and cheap zucchini's and I decided to make a few different bread recipes. Delicious, especially with the dates...I am all about dates! The only thing I did different was to up the cinnamon and nutmeg...other than that, this is a gem :)

I added dried cranberries instead of dates, brown sugar instead of white, and 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of the oil, and whole wheat flour. Turned out fantastic and a healthy version of Grandma's! Loved the pepper!!

I was given a recipe by one of my co-workers who makes lovely zucchini bread. I took the recipe with me to the farmers market to get all of the ingredients and I lost the recipe in the store. I came on here to find a recipe that was similar to the one she gave me and this one most resembled the one I lost. This recipe was excellent. I added some coconut flakes and used real ginger because I had no ground ginger and it was great. This is a great recipe it wont let you down.  P.S. If you have zucchini that has a lot of water be sure to squeeze the water out of it before adding it.

This is an acceptable, not remarkable, zucchini bread. It is not moist enough, and a little more spice wouldn’t hurt either, although I did like the addition of the dates. Most important, I’m disappointed with the loaf itself.  While I should have known better than to continue on when the batter filled only about one-third of the pan, I should also have been able to rely on the pan size called for in the recipe.  I want a loaf, not thick bars baked in a loaf pan.  This was barely two inches tall!  A word to the wise – either make a full recipe and make one, 9x5” loaf, or use smaller pans.  Or make muffins.  Or, since this bread was rather non-descript, choose one of the many, better zucchini bread recipes on this site. (And don’t make the same mistake I did – whatever size pan you choose to use, the pan should be 2/3 full with batter!) Note: If you still decide to try this recipe, add a teaspoon of salt.

Didn't add dates and such, just a basic zucchini bread and it turned out great, I make it weekly using our garden's bounty.  Tried another recipe on food network didn't come out nearly as good as this.  I occasionally 1 cup of chocolate chips or butterscotch chips for a sweeter treat. Great recipe

Robert likes this. I like it either warm, fresh from the oven or cold from the fridge with margerine on it.  I have made several versions of this eg plain substituted sugared cherries chopped and walnuts I also added the dates to one and ground up flax seed in the coffee grinder and added about 1/3 cup. nice flavor

This was really good and not too dry as other reviewers have suggested.  I did not, however, drain my zucchini as others may have.  I figured all that juicy goodness was just going to make the bread all that much better.  The addition of the dates also adds moistness (and body) to the bread.  The black pepper is BRILLIANT!  Can't really tell it is there but there is a "little something" that makes it different.  I made a second batch and used freshly grated ginger (quite a lot actually) and that really pushed the flavors over the edge.  You can make this batter into large loafs, mini loafs or muffins.  You could probably even do it as a cake (ala Carrot Cake) just fill whatever pans you are using 2/3 full and adjust the baking time accordingly.  A keeper recipe for sure.

Dry but tasty-could have benefited from some applesauce or something to moisten it up.

This is my go-to zucchini bread recipe, always gets rave reviews from those who snag a slice. Recently I started cutting the oil in half with apple sauce and I can't taste a difference. Much less fat with all the taste? That's a win-win!

This was really good with the dates. I replaced all the oil with applesauce and it was really moist and a little more healthy that way. Next time, I will reduce some of the sugar as the applesauce and dates make it sweeter.

It was okay, but desperately needs salt!! I added extra spices and vanilla but it was still a little lacking in flavor. I think next time I’ll add even more spices and a half teaspoon of salt and it will be perfect. I also threw in some toasted walnuts.

This is the recipe my family has used for 80+ years.  It is great!  We use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple-sauce now which varies from this original recipe.  It has always been a family favorite  in our house.  Thanks for submitting it.

By far, the most moist and delicious zucchini bread recipe I've found yet.  Right amount and mix of spices.  I used homemade  applesauce instead of oil and raisins .

I made the zucchini bread according to the recipe. I had more than 2 cups of zucchini grated and I added it to the batter. It came out very moist and delicious! My family loves this zucchini bread; I love the dates in the recipe!!!!!

This is the best! And with my zucchini plants going crazy this year, I will be using it over and over.  I added dried cranberries to some and fresh pineapple to others and my next batch will be fresh apricots!

I made this without eggs ( an accident ). It still turned out great! I just keep making it without eggs and use cranberries instead of dates. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe :)
