This is a great recipe especially for the kids. I added garlic and an italian blend of basil oregano and rosemary. This is wonderful especially on a cold night! Also great with grilled cheese or a nice loaf of french bread! Thanks!

SO i recomend that u add salt pepper basil parsley and oregano to the sauted tomatoes and onion. and i used canned tomatoes so i didnt need to add water becasue the canned tomatoes had so much tomatoe juice. good luck!!

You'd never believe this was vegetarian if you didn't see it being made. So tasty! Personally I like to add some diced garlic (about 1 or 2 cloves) to the sauteing onions and tomato and chopped basil to the soup when I pour in the tofu mixture (rather than just as a garnish). I'm also slightly lazy so I substitute an equivalent amount of no-salt-added canned diced tomatoes and use the reserved juice from the cans in place of the water. Keep in mind - this will thicken upon standing so if you're making extra to put in the fridge you may need to add a bit of tomato juice or water when you reheat it.

I doubled the tomatoes and onion cooked in garlic olive oil. I added 16 oz of soft tofu and a can of Progresso cream of tomato soup and mixed it all with an emulsion blender. The texture was weird so I put it in batches through a sieve. Then it was good! Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! The only thing I did differently was add some minced garlic with the tomatoes and onion.

SO GOOD! and so easy. I used the Low sodium condensed soup and added garlic and spinach to the sautee and replaced scallions for onions out of convenience. Next time I'll loose the spinach but this stuff went quick!

The only change was I added some basil which helped but we thought it was just okay. I guess it's pretty good for being low calorie.
