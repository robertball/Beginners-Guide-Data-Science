Substituting 1 cup mild molasses and 1 cup granulated sugar for 1 cup brown sugar will make this  have a yummy caramel flavor too.

LOVED this easy recipe!  After reading the other reviews, I decided to bring the mixture to a slow boil to see if I could get more of a caramel flavor.  The flavor was great, but maybe a little too sweet to put on a sweet cookie, so next time I'll add some salt as well.

I substituted light molasses plus 1 teaspoon Watkins Carmel extract.  It was delicious but I had a problem with it setting up too quickly. I couldn't get it spread out over the whole cake, any suggestions?

Nice & simple as I like it...used molasses instead of corn syrup (didn't have), still good, richer flavor

The brown sugar frosting was very sweet, but it made a nice topping for the Cinnamon Butter Cookies (http://cookie.allrecipes.com/AZ/CinnmnBttrCkies.asp).  I just dipped them into the frosting, let it set, and it turned out very, very good!

Tastes like powdered sugar.  I was looking for a more caramel taste.  Even the addition of vanilla didn't help.  Possibly a good glaze if you are looking to purely add sweetness.

I kept this warm on the stove instead of letting it cool and drizzled over slices of warm chocolate mayonaise cake. (Mayonnaise Cake II that I got from this site). I used light brown sugar instead of dark because it's all I had, and I thought it needed a little something else so I added a little honey, a pinch of ginger, and a little vanilla. It didn't harden keeping it on warm for those who wanted more and the whole family loved it.

I found this really rich and had too much of a fake maple syrup flavor for me. I used it on cookies that needed flavor. Might be better as a drizzle.

Easy but it was so thick it was hard to spread on the sugar cookies I made. I added a bit more water. Tasty though! I will try it again. Thanks Ingrid

This was great! Loved how easy it was. Used a corn syrup substitute of 1/4 cup water to 1 cup sugar. Perfect!
