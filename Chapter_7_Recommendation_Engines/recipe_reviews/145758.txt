Just a simple request for when people make suggestions for substitutions--please include amounts! I made these burgers tonight, and like one of the other reviewers, I had no chipotle peppers, but I did have the spice available.  Unfortunately, I had no idea how much to substitute for the chipotle pepper, and ended up adding waaaaayyy too much  spice to my burgers. They were blazing hot! I used 1 teaspoon of spice to 1 1/4 pound of ground sirloin (for four servings).  So if anyone suggests a substitution, please also suggest a quantity to use. I know I would really appreciate the help, and maybe others would, too.  I enjoyed the burgers, and I will give them another shot with either real chipotles or lower the amount of spice I use.

We LOVE this recipe and have even used it with ground turkey.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I didn't have chipotle sauce or peppers.  And, after the first time, I also decreased the liquid smoke to 1 tsp because it seemed to be a little strong.  Amazing!

Yummy!  Very good grilled burger.  I used garlic powder instead of the minced garlic and did half and half gound beef and ground turkey.  I also used pepper jack cheese. I will use this recipe again.

Tried these tonight- was going to make a meatloaf from the recipe as I didn't have any buns. The more I read the reviews, I realized that these would be at their peak from grilling. So, we had the burgers minus the buns and cheese. We got to taste the true flavor. Very, very tasty. I might use a teeny bit less chipotles in adobo next time. My word on that ingredient is this-buy a small can, put the remainder in an airtight container and keep it in the frig. I have been using the same container for about 6 months. Believe me, it keeps its flavor and kick! And, there's not really any great substitute when a recipe calls for it. One question for the others- what did they use as "grill seasoning?" I don't have any on hand, as we do most of our own combinations to make rubs, etc. I just used some paprika, chili powder and smoked salt. We really loved these. This recipe elevates burgers to "company" status. Yum.

I used all the seasoning as noted except for the chilies as we are wimps in that department. I topped the burgers with Gouda cheese the last few minutes on the grill. I really liked the flavors of this burger and will make it again.

These are wonderful tasting burgers!  This is the 3rd time that I've used this recipe.  The 2nd time I used ground turkey breast instead of beef.  It was drier but still very good flavor.  I've also combined all of the ingredients (except the beef) in a bowl and made a paste like out of it and rubbed it on some fish that I was going to saute.  It too was pretty darned good!  The smokiness and heat of the chipotles combined with the liquid smoke is quite a tasty combo.  I really like your recipe.  Thanks! I would have never thought of this on my own!

Incredible seasoning combination! I don't care for the heat of the chipotle peppers or adobo sauce, so I subbed about a teaspoon of smoked paprika. I think I used a little less worcestershire sauce as well. These might be the best burgers I have made. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We really enjoyed these burgers. I used onion powder since I don't care for onion and McCormick hamburger seasoning for the grill seasoning, but it was too salty so next time I will make my own or use something else.  I cut this in half for just the 3 of us. The canned chipotle peppers though barely had any adobo sauce so I scraped up what I could and used it. I used La Costena brand.  I cooked this in a skillet/stovetop instead of grilling this time. Thanks Janine, these were good and we will be having these again.

The most juicy and tender homemade burger, ever!  Very simple to make!  Instead of fresh garlic, I used about 1 tsp. of garlic powder, because I wasn't keen on a strong garlic flavor inside the burger.  I formed these into 1/3 to 1/2 lb. patties that were thick, and put them in the fridge for the next night.  Grilled them up and they were delicious, but they may need more salt (according to my father and a couple of other guests) :) but I thought they were fine with whatever amount was in the grill seasoning and the rest of the ingredients.. but you can play with that according to your own tastes.  The juiciness of these burgers is what won me over. I will look no further for a burger recipe.  This is it.  Thank you so much for sharing.

You really have no right reviewing this recipe if you didn't add the chipotle chile or adobo sauce. The amount of liquid smoke is perfect when you have the right ingredients to go with it. I make this recipe exactly how it's written and it's incredible. We've had these several times when having other couples over for a cookout and they are always a hit! I try to make them up ahead of time and let them sit for a while before grilling. Great recipe!!

Excellent flavor, the best plain burger I have ever had. I like fully dressed burgers with mustard, onions, chili, cheese, jalape√±os, but this burger was great with only some cheese on top. The ingredients caramelized especially tasty on my charcoal grill. I grilled for about 18 minutes total instead of the normal 8-10 minutes for normal burgers due to the high moisture content.

I also made this recipe as a meatloaf by adding one egg and 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs. I baked at 350F for an hour. The meatloaf version is less spicy tasting, but also very good. I am going to try the meatloaf version again but with a tomato based sauce on top to add that extra meatloaf flavor.

Just made these today.  Scaled the recipe  for 2 burgers.  They were tasty and had a nice after bite from the chipotle.  My husband said he liked it, but thought the  texture was more like a meatloaf.  Probably because of the liquids added that made the burger a bit loose.  Probably would not make again.

I did not care for this recipe.  I like the taste of hamburger and I just like to enhance the burger taste.  This recipe totally overcame all the taste of beef. I was very disappointed and will not use this recipe again.

These burgers have great flavor and spice! I doubled the chopped chili and loved it, H thought it was a little too spicy, so next time I'll only add extra to mine. The liquid smoke is just the right amount and not over powering. Thanks Janine :)

These were excellent! I made it per the recipe with the exception of only using half a chipotle pepper. I am used to very hot foods and this to me was only slightly warm. My wife felt that it was very hot and suggested only a 1/4th of the chipotle pepper for next time. So anyone making this, make it to your heat level. The flavor of the chipotle is outstanding in it and I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe for myself.

Fantabulous burger!   I scaled it to one serving, and kept to the recipe other than leaving out the chipotle in adobo (I didn't want to open a whole can just for my one burger).  The burger was then cooked on my cast iron grill pan, love that thing.  Usually I like a lot of condiments but in this case it didn't need it and in fact I thought would counterbalance the highly flavored meat (except maybe fresh lettuce/tomato would work well).  I did dress with some chili sauce to make up some of the spice I lost with skipping the chipotle, and also some grainy mustard.  Next time I won't bother grating the onion and just top with slices as I usually do, and I'll add more grill seasoning (love the stuff, and I use Mrs Dash salt-free so you can add more without it becoming too salty).  Those very minor quibbles aside I adored this!

Sooo delicious! Cut the recipe down to make 4 servings. I made my own grill seasoning since I didn't want to spend the 5 bucks for it. I couldn't find the canned chipotle peppers at the local grocer, so I used 1/4 cup apricot+mango chipotle sauce (it was all that I could find that would even come close?). I was afraid of using the real garlic, but went ahead anyways - couldn't taste it AND gets rid of that gross meat smell, I'm glad I did it. Topped them with mild cheddar or provolone slices, and ate them with wheat buns. We might try them "california western" style next time, you know, with onion rings and some sort of bbq sauce. Looove it! Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe and think next time I'll put the whole 1 chipotle pepper in for the 1lb of meat for more flavor. The smokiness in the burger is great! I'll try this again for sure. **Update: I made the halved recipe again and using 1 full chipotle pepper is the way to go. I use course salt and cracked pepper on the outside of my burgers. I've also made this recipe with ground turkey breast and let the burgers sit overnight prior to cooking in a pan and they were delicious! Yum!

Excellent recipe.  Made really tasty and juicy burgers.  I too didn't have the chipotle in adobo at home so subbed ground chipotle (1 teaspoon).  This gave it a subtle kick without being too hot.

These Burgers were just okay. I followed the recipe exactly and it had this sweet flavor that I didnt really like for a burger. It tasted more like meatloaf then a burger. Sorry, but I probably wont be making this again. Thanks for posting though.

These were really good.  The only issue I had was there was really no adobo sauce in the can with the pepper.  They were so tightly packed in there.  I just added a bit more of the peppers to compensate.  It worked out fine.

These burgers were excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and we loved them.  They are a perfect combination of smokey and spicy.  I can't say enough good things about them.  We will be making them again very soon.  Thanks, Janine!!!

This was the first time I used chipotle chiles in adobo sauce and man, those chiles were spicy.  Next time, I would probably leave them out of this recipe as our mouths were on fire.  I used organic ground beef so the burgers were moist and tender.  Loved the smokiness of this burger!

these came out delicious! I'm not good in the hamburger department but do not like the ones on the market. I have a daughter that has Celiac's so since she has been diagnosed I have been making more on the gluten free menu. I did not use the whole Pablono pepper, I just used some of the sauce since I knew it would be too hot for some family members.Very tasty, next time I will use half ground beef and half ground turkey

AWESOME burger!!! It was smoky with light heat from the adobe chiles. I also added a slice of smoked gouda cheese to the center of the burgers before grilling and this enhanced the flavor. Served with baked beans and grilled veggies . Yum a definite keeper.

Delicious with NO smoke flavoring.  Need to try with the adobo chipotles.

Very good recipe for when you're sick of regular burgers!  I halved the liquid smoke and worcestershire sauce.  Everyone enjoyed them, even my beef purist husband.

Fabulous!  Love the smokey, spicy flavour.  I prefer this to chris's bay area burger.  The flavour is great, and the recipe is straightforward.  I did not quite know what "grill seasoning" was so I used Montreal Steak spice.  I also used a whole small onion but sauteed it first to cut down on the sharpness of the onion.  I used the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (can be bought at wal-mart, cheap) and took the whole can and threw it in the food processor.  I used the mixture in the recipe (this mixture keeps for months in the fridge, and tastes awesome) Otherwise followed the recipe exactly, this will be my new go-to burger for this grilling season!  Got raving reviews and many requests for the recipe!

I also lessened the amount of liquid smoke.  I let the mixture sit overnight to meld the flavors before forming them into patties.  Then I layered them with wax paper and stuck them in the freezer.  I made 8 smaller patties out of 2 lbs of meat.  They were a HIT!!!!  My husband oohed and aahed!  I also made Belle's Hamburger Buns to go with them.  VERY, very good!  Next time I will carmelize some onions and maybe saute some mushrooms to go on top!

These were absolutely GREAT!! First recipe I'm reviewing for a reason.  Guys at the fire station LOVED it, they didn't even use mustard/ketchup. I only shared it with friends on a different department and it went over great for both of them as well.  Only change was some pepper-jack cheese instead of cheddar.

These were OK. Pretty good, but not my standard "go to" burger (which I was hoping to find...). I scaled the recipe to yield 4 burgers (2 each for my bf and I). The burgers had some flavor, but nothing "over the top". Served on onion rolls with hicory smoked bacon, cheddar cheese and Bar-b-q sauce. Had I not served wtih the extras, I wouldn't have liked these very much. I might make  these again, but not any time soon and probably not on a regular basis. Thanks anyways!

These burgers were delicious!  It really jazzed up the normal boring burger recipe.  I added a little bit more of the peppers because we like it spicy.  I didn't use onions since my family won't eat them, and I tried substituting onion powder instead.  Since I love onions, I felt that the onion flavor still wasn't enough.  If I were making it for company, I'd definitely use the grated onion next time as this would make them perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These burgers are flavorful and juicy.  I make a large recipe to freeze several patties and they are spectacular when reheated--be sure to pour a little of the cooked burger juice in each freezer baggie.

I get a lot of compliments from friends and family for the food I grill and smoke, so I never thought I would rate a BURGER on this website.  My picky wife who doesn't like anything chipotle said this was the best burger I've ever fixed. What????  I followed this recipe exactly and 4 out of 4 thought it was fantastic. My fam did NOT think it was too spicy. In fact, we thought it could use just a little more heat.  I made these burgers 4 hours before grilling to let all of the flavors get happy. To the reviewer that said this was more like meatloaf, hogwash!  When mixing the ingredients you don't want to overwork the meat.  Be gentle and use 80/20 ground beef. Gr8 recipe and my new go to burger.

First off, I love spicy food. I followed the recipe without any changes but it wasn't spicy for me at all and the chipotle flavor barely cut through. So I made it a second time and tripled the adobo sauce and chipotle peppers and was then able to taste the uniqueness of this burger. I also prefer to sprinkle the grill seasoning on the outside of the patty on both sides prior to grilling. Mixing the seasoning into the patty made it less flavorful in my opinion. After the changes, I feel it's a keeper.

09.18.16 ~ We really enjoyed this burger, along with 'Summer Potato Salad' from AR. I only used one pound of burger, so I cut the ingredients in half. The smokey flavor was nice, but I should have added the full amount of adobo sauce and an entire chipotle pepper. The burger had a great flavor, but not as much heat as I was hoping for. The next time, I'll just add additional sauce and pepper. We grilled this on a charcoal grill and the burger was the star of the meal. Thanks Janine, for sharing your creation.

This recipe was a HIT with the family.  It's too bad my husband was saving room for dessert because he 'just' ate two burgers.  Even my teenage daughter liked them!  We'll definitely be making these again.

Spicy, smoky, JOY!  Many recipes claim to be the "best", but these burgers are better than that.  Perfect flavor balance and excellent texture as written.  I will be making these again and again.

Very good change of pace from regular hamburgers. I used about 1/3 of the  7 oz can of chipolte peppers so mine were extra spicey. My two 20 year old son loved them.

This was most enjoyable! I followed the recipe to a T and found the meat mixture a bit on the wet side. Next time I'll use less liquids but the same ingredients. Not sure if it was mentioned in other ratings but people who are not familiar with chipotle peppers in sauce in the can need to be warned that these guys are quite spicy. Thank you for sharing!

'Got a reluctant "thumbs up" from the 15yr old boy child & an unprovoked "You should make again/" WOW! :D  Wow.  :) My ground beef package was two & a third pounds.  I added 1/4t onion powder (since when adding raw onion before, it doesn't oook; just heats), 1t liquid smoke, 2T worcestershire, 1T  minced garlic (just didn't feel like cutting more), 2T chipolte puree, 1/2t salt, 1/4t pepper. 'Surprisingly not so spicy - like at all.  Really couldn't tell I'd added the peppers.  With turkey, I'd use only 1T chipolte puree per pound.  I'm not even sure any amount would be good with turkey.  I do know that 2T was too much though!  :D  Chipolte puree: Just put the contents of the can in the blender & puree.  Use 1T for one pepper.  Easy, huh?  ;) And freeze by the tablespoonfuls separately. Then once frozen, bag 'em.  For me a "3," but since ... I'll rate a "4."

Isn't it funny how people can have such a wide range of taste buds? I'm vegetarian so didn't eat these, but I made them for my meat eaters and followed the recipe exactly. Two teenagers didn't finish theirs and the others said they didn't taste like hamburgers and didn't really care for them. Hubby said they were ok. No one though they were too spicy, however.

These were good burgers but were too wet.  I had to add bread crumbs to them.  I think I will try these again and tweak them slightly.

Absolutely wonderful!  Not having used liquid smoke often, I was unsure if that was too much, and my husband doesn't like SUPER spicy stuff - so I was worried about the amounts of adobo and chipotle, but these were spot on!  My husband loved them as did I!  Will not change a thing (unless I'd make for JUST ME - in which case I'd be ok with more garlic and chipotle...)

My burgers were so wet they fell apart. I should have added oatmeal or breadcrumbs (plain) as soon as I realized there was too much liquid. I think my meat might've been runnier than it should've been, it's not necessarily a problem with the recipe, but all the same I was flipping ruined burgers through no fault of my own so I'm going to have to dock this one for that so that I remember not to make this one again without revision. Sorry - the flavors were nice though. I used Penzey's "Mural of Flavor" for the grill seasoning since I didn't know what that was anyway and I like Mural. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  This is very similar to what I normally would make but this had the liquid smoke and chilis  I did use 1/4 tsp of chipotle powder for 1 lb of meat.  Mixed everything together and let it sit in the fridge for about a half hour to hour before forming patties.  Thanks for not putting an egg into the recipe, it doesn't need it.

Well Janine, I don't know what the original burgers tasted like, but you sure must have done a great job because even with using ground turkey, these were delicious! I only used a pound but kept all the ingredients the same. Thank you so much!!

My whole family liked this recipe. We did not put cheese on ours because we did not want to take away from the taste of the burger. My wife made a sauce with a half cup of mayo, one chipotle (finely chopped), and a teaspoon of the adobe sauce. This adds great flavor without using boring old ketchup and mustard.

My husband and guests raved about these.  I thought they were decent.  I like it better when I make up my own concoction.  But guess I have to give it a 5 because everyone else loved them.

While I agree this is a good recipe, I do not think it a "great" recipe and the reason is mainly because I am not fond of Adobo flavoring. I have made several marinades using Adobo sauce and chipotle peppers and they have yet to turn out pleasing. I will say that I love spicy things and I love smokey, grilled food so this recipe is right up my alley.
The bottom line, try it once and see how you like it, as they say: your mileage may vary.

Perfect recipe for hamburgers.  My mouth waters just thinking about them.  I haven't tried the liquid smoke, we always grill & there's plenty of smokey flavor that comes from that.  I keep chipotle hot sauce in a bottle on hand for recipes, because so many of the peppers in the can go to waste if you need just one.  I think the chipotle hot sauce in a bottle is fine to give the burgers that flavor, but if you do want more heat, use the pepper.

Very tasty!  I was a little nervous that the burgers would be too spicy with the the chipotle pepper and the sauce, but it was actually the perfect kick.  We only grilled two then froze the rest of them.

Easy and delicious!  A great basic recipe.  We didn't use any chipotle spice since our 6 yr old is super sensitive and we live in New Zealand so it's not a pantry staple.  Added 1 tsp smoked paprika instead, and halved the liquid smoke.  Also I only had 1.5 pounds of beef so I added a can of lentils (which I pureed with the onion and spices to make a paste) and no one knows the difference!  The picky 6 yr old went back for another, 2 yr old loved them, and my husband was oohing an ahhhing, so this is a keeper!  One day can't wait to try a spicier version when family tastes change.  Thank you!

The first time I followed the recipe exactly but found it just a bit too much heat. This time I cut back on the adobe sauce & chipotle by about one-half. There was still enough heat to be noticeable - perfect. Delicious burgers.

Amazing burgers! I only used half of the chipotle pepper, otherwise it would be too spicy for us. I kept the rest of the recipe the same, and it was the best burger.

OMG best burgers I ever made!!! Thanks to OP for posting this recipe. 

I had to make extra so I added another pound of burger meat but kept all other measurements the same. 

I skipped the chipotle and peppers since I don't like spice and these babies turned out so awesome! Just the juiciest and tastiest burgers I ever made.

I did add a bit of breadcrumbs (didn't measure just added about a handful) the meat felt very loose and I was worried it would fall apart on the grill...it didn't.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  Brought it to a picnic and was happy to share the recipe with many. This will be our new go-to burger recipe.  
 Forced to make adjustments based on what I had: subbed canned mild chillis and chipotle seasoning.  Just note for those that are sensitive that this does result in a mild heat.  Added an egg as another reviewer suggested to help hold it together. Yum!

Great burger; had a smokey, barbecue flavor without being overpowering. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I cut the liquid smoke by half. I aIso substituted chipotle pepper spice for the peppers in adobo, since I didn't have any. All in all, an awesome burger!

Incredible!  Even the most die-hard "picky" burger fans ate these and went back for more... these have so much flavor and remain moist on the grill.  The cheese is an excellent touch with the recipe and I encouraged people who didn't care for cheeseburgers to try it; without exception, they loved it.  They were eaten within minutes and I had so many requests for extras that my double recipe could have been quadrupled!  The only thing I eliminated was the liquid smoke, since it tends to make most people I know, including my family, somewhat sick when they eat it.  Otherwise, it is perfection exactly as is- thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

These were great!  Didn't have the chipotle peppers so just doubled up on the adobe sauce.  Wasn't sure about the grill seasoning but Grill Mates mesquite worked just fine.  Didn't serve them on buns but alongside some pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese.  Yummy dinner!

Followed recipe, made no changes. I was concerned with all the liquid ingredients along with grating the onion.(more moisture). It was a wet mixture, but held together grilling. I thought it had a texture like a meatloaf, the "hamburger" taste was lost. I did enjoy the Adobe sauce & chipotle in it. Just enough to zing. Other than that- I won't be making these again. There were no "wows" or "yums" at the table.

I prefer to add twice as much liquid smoke as  Worcestershire sauce to keep the burgers from being too salty. Otherwise, this recipe rocks!

These burgers were fabulous. Not sure where the sweetness came from but  I approve!  Can't wait to try one of the left overs. Next time I'll add a little heat but strongly recommend this recipe

Excellent flavor. Will definitely make again. Easy to prepare as most of the ingredients are pantry staples. I substituted 1 tablespoon of salsa for the adobo sauce and left out the chopped chipotle pepper.

As I live alone, I made the burgers with 1 kilogram of pork mince, pureed fresh garlic, no salt as on a salt free diet, wasn't sure what grill seasoning or liquid smoke meant is as very rare in Australia. So added tabasco sauce and sweet chilli sauce. Froze the other burgers and buns for later use, and microwaved one today. Very nice with beetroot, cos lettuce and mayo.

This recipe is seriously amazing! My family loved it and they're usually rather picky. The chipotle may seem overly spicy on its own, but the liquid smoke tends to compensate and if you'd like to ensure the spice is calmed, just add another teaspoon!

Made it near exactly as the recipe called for. I used McCormick "Hamburger" spice for the grill spice, opted to NOT add any salt and pepper "to taste," then grilled them on aluminum foil at ~400F. 

They have a little kick to them, but if you enjoy spicy food do not shy away from adding a second chipotle pepper. On the whole I really enjoyed the flavor, and did not add any condiments. The only thing I added that was not in the recipe was green leaf lettuce, primarily for looks. 

I don't think I'd change a thing about this recipe, and I'll definitely make it again. Thank you for uploading! c:

Oh. My. GOSH. Literally just got done eating these and they are THE best burgers I've ever had. Spicy with a hint of smokey flavor, it's just the most delicious combination. We aren't fans of onion in my home and I didn't have any garlic so I did substitute with 1 tbsp of onion powder and 1 tbsp of garlic powder. Other than that I didn't change a thing. Definitely a 5 star recipe!

I made these last night and the family loved them.  I did make a few small changes as I used only 1 TBS of Worcestershire Sauce, used 4 fresh garlic cloves, and 1 TBS of Montreal Steak seasoning.   I made the patties up 4 hours ahead of time to let the flavors meld.  They were amazing!  I used a Kaiser Roll and although the buns where a bit larger then the patties it was still the best choice of bread to use.  At the base of the burger I put pickles and Romaine lettuce, the burger with melted cheddar, a tomato, and two slices of crispy bacon.  This burger oozes with flavor, will definitely make it again!

Very good burger recipe!  Made "just as" first time around (yes, with one whole TBLS liquid smoke) and was surprisingly impressed as I was sure it may be too much but family of carnivores wolfed 'em down.  Second time around I did lessen the liquid smoke to 1/2 TBLS and added one egg yolk for every pound of burger to assist in binding all together better for grilling.  While I prefer this recipe with my modifications, still deserving of all five  stars as I never would have thought to add liquid smoke to our home grilled burgers.  Thank you, Janine, for a wonderful burger recipe!

WOW!! This recipe is to die for! I used onion powder in place of onions due to my brother in law visiting, and I wanted to try only a half of a pepper first to see how spicy it would be. I REALLY love how it came out. Its got a yummy smokey flavor, also I cooked them on the stove seeing as it is winter time, but they really are the best burgers I've ever had! I LOVE the spiciness, and the smokey flavor, and the cheese really makes it all pop. Paired with ketchup and mustard, I definitely am switching my burger recipe! :) I am not a big spicy fan either, but I think I could have added the whole pepper. Either way, it is definitely recommended!

Yummy!!! I skipped the chipotle pepper, wanted to make sure the kids would eat them. Everyone really liked them. 1st time I've ever grated onion, loved having the flavor, but not chunks of it. Will definitely make these again.

this was tasty.. i scaled it down to one since i was only cooking for myself.. subbed ground turkey for the beef sirloin.. i left out the onion and reduced the liquid smoke (used a quarter of what is listed).. i was worried it would add too much salt.. i think i could go up by a half next time.. i only had the chipotle sauce so i left out the chile itself.. ty for the recipe.. UPDATE: this time i made these with the onion and the full amount of liquid smoke.. it didn't taste too salty after all.. i was pleasantly surprised.. ty again for the recipe

I used dried onion instead of fresh and garlic powder instead of fresh.  With these changes, I did not have an issue with the burger being too wet.  Delicious flavor!  Used my favorite steak seasoning for the "grill" seasoning.  Will be making again.  Loved the smokiness!

My hubby and I loved these. I loved the smokey flavor from the liquid smoke. I did make a few changes, I used garlic powder and onion powder instead and in place of the adobo pepper items I used some chili powder and half a can of mild green chilis. I topped mine with the cheddar cheese, bacon and tomato slices. This is keeper for me.

one of the most flavorful burger i've ever had. I didn't have the chipotle/adobo sauce  or liquid smoke but I love them so I'd use it next time for sure. But in the mean time you can substitute smoked paprika about 1 tsp, chili powder about 1/2 tsp, and a touch of cayenne pepper and you get a similar flavor. I felt like the burger needed something a little sweet, so you could either add a bit of brown sugar or top with BBQ like we did. So yummy!

I made these as written and they had a lot of flavor.  We tried to grill them and ran out of propane so I finished them on the stove.  I think they dried out in that process but the flavor was wonderful.

Made these burgers today and they were quite tasty.  Did not use any grill seasoning, only smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  The liquid smoke flavoring really made a difference in this recipe.  Will probably make again, but with ground turkey.

Got some organic, grass-fed, fresh ground sirloin at the local "farmer's market" store (great sale) and decided to make these for the kids. I left out the chipotle peppers and wrapped them in a slice of bacon for extra juice/flavor, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. They were excellent burgers, and the liquid smoke gave them a nice smoky flavor, especially helpful with a gas grill. I like that they didn't use eggs or bread crumbs like a lot of the other burger recipes, so they were true burgers, not meatloaf. Toasted some chewy rolls, grated the Cheddar over the burgers, added a little spicy mustard, served them with grilled corn on the cob, and we were happy eaters.

So juicy and tasty!  I tried a beef and a turkey version, and definitely prefer beef - the flavors were maybe a little overpowering for the turkey - but it was still good.

Tasty, but honestly not as flavorful as I expected from the ingredients.

I made this again last night with ground ostrich. I used only about 1/2 tsp smoke, but I'm really sensitive to it. Also used about 2 tbsp chipotle paste and added black peppar. These are so good! My husband said they were one of the best burgers he's ever had! Thank you!!!

We've made this recipe with beef, elk, and venison burger, and it's always delicious--even reheated the next day. It's become our favorite burger recipe.

What outstanding burgers! This is going to become a regular in our house. I thought the liquid smoke was perfect. My husband's comment was that he found the grocery store sold chopped chipotles in adobo, so next time I'll buy that and skip having to chop the peppers.

These were superb. As other suggested, I used a little less of the liquid smoke. I also couldn't find the chipotle in adobo, so I used 3 tablespoons of a chipotle salsa and it turned out great.

Wow - great flavor. I was a little worried about the adobe & chipolte chile but it really added a nice flavor - not super spicey. I wrapped the burger in bacon - an idea from another recipe. This is a keeper!

This was definately one of the best hamburgers I've ever had! I didn't have the Worcesterchire sauce so just omitted it. Next time I'll use it to see the difference but tasted amazing without it. I also used monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar and added avocado and bacon. Very filling and delicious!

I used Montreal Steak Seasoning as the grill seasoning. I didn't use the adobo because I didn't have any. The burgers came out absolutely delicious!

Soooo yummy! Wish I had used the liquid smoke but I didn't have any on hand and I can't imagine these tasting any better.  I did use more chipotle pepper and adobe sauce then called for 'cause we like the Heat!

This recipe's title should be changed to "World's Best Burgers."  Made it for the first time with company, and they loved it!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Amazing! Really juicy and flavorful..  Didn't have chipotle peppers so I put about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  However!  I DID have sliced cheddar with chipotle peppers by sargento.  Slapped those suckers on the patty n served on toasted onion buns with grilled onions and "not so secret sauce."  YUMMMmmmmm!!!!  Thank you ^_^ update:  Oh! forgot to mention that I added an egg to the mix.  superb!

Okay - I was skeptical about all of the smoke season - because its strong, but it definately needs it... they were tasty, but I would use amounts as listed - maybe even up them a bit.  I'm trying again with more spice!!
