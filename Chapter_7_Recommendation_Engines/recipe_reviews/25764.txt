Heaven help me, these are too good to stop eating!!  I just made them for the first time to sell at a local flea market, and they were so good that I had to force myself to let people buy them!!  I actually dipped the bottoms rather than the tops for a more traditional look, and they looked mouth-watering and professional.  These will definitely be a new addition to the cookie trays I sell for the holidays, and they couldn't be easier to make.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Good recipe, but you do have to be careful not to cook too long or they become very dry.  I melted the chocolate first then stirred in half and half to thin it out a little and I didn't have any problems with the chocolate clumping up as some others said they did. I also drizzled some melted white chocolate over the top. YUM!

Awesome!! Moist and chewy!!  Easy to make.  I made half with chocolate and half without..both were yummy!! I used Baker's Chocolate, which is easy to melt.  Make sure you watch these in the oven, they can go to perfect to overdone quickly.  I will be making these as gifts for Christmas!!

Excellent and easy recipe.  The only thing that I would not do is add milk to the chocolate - the chocolate doesn't melt - it's gets chunky.  You need to just melt the chocolate quick and dip the cookies. Great tasting and moist!

This recipe was sooo easy and the results were perfect.  They were gone the first 30 min's of my party.  I did them with and without the chocolate and both were loved by all.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family is obsessed with this recipe!  Everytime I make them I have to triple the recipe they go so quickly!  Very easy to make and good whether you dip them in dark or milk chocolate, or just leave them alone.  I don't recommend dipping them in white chocolate-too sweet.

These cookies seemed a bit dry to be macroons.  Maybe there needs to be some kind of adjustment for high altitude baking.  I took these too a party and the guest had no problem eating them!

Eh...These were OK.  I think that perhaps they have too much flour in them.  They even had sort of a "flourish" flavor.  I looked up other macaroon recipes and will try those similar to this with a little less flour to see how they work out.  Otherwise, they were easy to make and the chocolate makes a beautiful and impressive presentation.  I did use the butter as a substitute for the milk, but found that the chocolate quickly melted in my hands.  If I were to make them again, I would simply melt the chocolate chips without adding any additional ingredients.

what a wonderful cookie. cookie stays very moist, and is not granie since you don't add sugar. I got rave reviews from everyone who had tried the cookie, telling me they were better than the ones made at the stores. thanks for sharing!

I had never tasted a coconut macaroon before so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoyed these.  They were so simple to make and even though I'm not a huge fan of coconut I found it hard to stop eating these.

They're OK. I have had better. This recipe relies heavily on the quality of the chocolate and the sweetened condensed milk. They are also a little 'heavy'.

Oh my goodness these are fantastic!! I added a tablespoon of cold brewed coffee to the chocolate as I did not want to add milk. I used semi sweet chocolate chips and the taste was phenomenal. As other reviewers have said, you need to watch these as they will over cook and turn too crunchy quickly. I took them out as soon as I saw the coconut getting a bit toasty and they came out sooooooo good and chewy and delish!!! They keep well in a plastic tub only they never last long enough to find out just how long they will keep :)

This recipe was delicious! However, I struggled with melting the chocolate in the double boiler. :) After creating curdled chocolate from having the heat too high, I tried again. The second time, I did not add any milk and I warmed the chocolate chips slowly. Once the chocolate curdles it is no longer usable. I hope this helps.

These were great. I didn't even use the milk, and the chocolate was perfect. I baked them at 250 for 20 minutes. I did this because i was reading two recipes at once by accident, but the texture was so perfect, i will always use this recipe/temp mixture from now on.

Perfection! Moist, but with a little bit of crisp. I left off the chocolate because I tried dark chocolate on one and found it overpowering. Next time I will try a less intense dark and the semi-sweet chips on some, but my husband will probably still prefer them plain.

it was simple & quick thoug I would allow a little more time to cool before serving so the chocolate doesn't get all over your hands. Also added some crushed pecans to half & they were also great

The macaroons turned out to be very tasty.  It was the chocolate on the top that really made these excellent.  The only things I didn't like about them was the uber-stickiness of the "batter" because of the condensed milk (total pain to put on the cookie sheet to bake) and they were a little too chewy when they were done.  Then again, that may have been my fault.  I really don't know.  But it's a good recipe to try out.

one word: DELICIOUS!!! extremely easy (although very sticky!) Watch your baking times..i only had to bake the cookies for 10 minutes and they were perfect. Not thrilled with the melted chocolate chips...next time I would use the chocolate wafers from AC Moore.

The chocolate was too grainy and not smooth.  I would try using the chocolate blocks and no milk.  Great tasting cookies.

These are SO GOOD! If you have 10 cups of coconut on hand, make the whole recipe because they will go fast! I only had 5 cups of coconut, so I halved the recipe and they were gone by the end of the day. No changes are needed in this recipe!

Really tasty, easy cookie. I made these because I was crunched for time and didn't have a lot of ingredients.  I agree with the members that you have to be careful not to overcook or they become dry.  No problem with the chocolate part, you just have to stir very well to get rid of chunks.  I will definitely make these again!

These were to die for!!!! They were absolutely fantastic. I halved the recipe and wish I hadn't. They were all eaten so quickly! :) Will definitely be making these again and again.

Great recipe. The only change that I would make (as some others suggested) would be to substitute a little butter for milk so that the chocolate doesn't get clumpy. Otherwise, fast, easy, and very tasty!

These macaroons are absolutely delicious. The chocolate was a little grainy, but no one seemed to care-- they ate them all and were very pleased.

Yummy coconut macaroons, scaled down to 20 to use up 1/2 can of Sweetened Condensed Milk I had leftover, made just enough to add to other desserts I had prepared.
