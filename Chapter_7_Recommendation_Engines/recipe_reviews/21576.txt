3 Stars for potential.  I concur with other reviewers who state that this is a DRY cake.  If you are expecting a true pound cake this is NOT the recipe for you.  Some enhancements I made that you might consider: using all butter instead of part shortening, part butter; using a good commercial egg nog to replace the milk (I used Old New England brand egg nog that has booze added; find at wine shops and liquor stores).  Also NOTE--the recipe time is definitely wrong for a loaf pan of this size.  At most you're looking at 50 min. baking time.  All in all a recipe that could be spectacular with some tinkering........

After reading other reviewers' comments, I followed some advice and made the following alterations: I substituted eggnog (and I used 1 cup versus 3/4 cup), and vanilla extract.  I added a cup of rum-soaked dried berries (blueberry, cherry, cranberry). I baked in a bundt pan rather than a loaf pan, and watched cooking times very carefully.  The results were delicious -- this was a hit at the day-after-christmas-breakfast with my family.  Thanks!

Like other reviewers suggested I used egg nog instead of milk and vanilla extract instead of rum. I also carefully watching the baking time and at around 50 minutes the tooth pick came out clean all over the cake so  I took it out of the oven. However after the cake cooled it practically crumbled when I cut it, and yet there were still mini lumps of flour mixture inside the cake despite mixing thoroughly. I also didn't think it tasted much like egg nog even though I used it! Sorry, too bland and time consuming for a not-so-great result.

Just tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it is super. I made it in mini-loaf pans and baked for 40 minutes to give to neighbors. Fantastic butter-rum flavor.

Good flavor, but not a true pound cake texture. My family thought it was to dry.

The flavor was excellent, but I was expecting true "pound cake".  I should have known from the amount of butter that this has the texture of regular cake, not pound cake. It's good sliced and then pan fried in butter til golden brown - if you like a richer cake.

Definitely tastes like eggnog... a little dry, but very good! I made a glaze to go on top (2 cups confectioners suger + a few tbs of milk and 1/4 tsp rum extract) until reached the consistancy to drip over the cake. I think the glaze really made it... otherwise would have been really plain...

I substituted eggnog for milk and vanilla for rum flavoring. I also watched times carefully and took it out early. It was still dry and bland and did not taste like eggnog. It was okay dipped in my eggnog chai latte, but not on its own.

A decent cake, but slightly dry and not very much like a true pound cake.  I substituted vanilla extract for the rum extract.  Watch your baking time - I checked my cake at 55 minutes and it was already burnt on the sides.  Probably could have baked it only 45 minutes.

Love this recipe...the only thing I change is I use a bit more spice (I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, double the nutmeg and a bit more ginger), and substitute the milk for eggnog, so mine is less subtle.  The texture is great, the flavour amazing. Excellent as a gift - I bake mine in mini silicone stars for Christmas! :)
