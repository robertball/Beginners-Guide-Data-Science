I'm making this meatloaf for dinner tonight.  I just wanted to give a tip on meatloaf.  My grandma took metal loaf pans, and drilled a few wholes in the sides of them along the bottom of the pan.  When she cooks meatloaf, she puts the loaf pan inside a cake pan, and a lot of the grease drains out of the pan.  This keeps it from crumbling, and also makes it a lot healthier!  It still tastes just as good!

I chose this recipe because the ingredients were simple. After reading the reviews below I made a few adjustments. I omitted the tomato soup and only added 1/4 cup of ketchup. It was not runny at all! In fact, it came out PERFECT! The family raved about the great classic taste.

Made about half the recipe - cut out the ketchup, used Worcestershire sauce rather than steak sauce. Added the concentrated tomato soup until it looked about the right consistency (about half the tin). Cooked in about 45 minutes (I used a meat thermometer to tell if it was cooked). Result .... excellent, moist and sliceable (didn't slice it thinly though!). Served on a bed of couscous (with green pepper & celery) with the leftover tomato soup thinned down with a lttle water and heated up as a sauce accompanied by fresh brussel sprouts straight from the garden. This one is going in the recipe book.

This was my first time making meatloaf and it turned out great. Only because I am not a huge meatloaf fan do I rate it four, but it could definitely be a five if you are a meatloaf lover... My husband said it was the best meatloaf he had eaten... Thanks for the great recipe!

I had never used mustard in my meatloaf but I think it is the key ingredient in this recipe -- it was SO good!  Thanks, Pam!

The best meatloaf I've ever had (and I'm not usually a big fan). I added an extra 1b. of extra-lean gr. beef and some bread crumbs (3/4 cup) as per other's comments about it being to 'liquidy'. Turned out delicious.

I altered this recipe based on other comments. I deleted the ketchup, mustard and 1 egg.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and seasoned salt. I used worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce. My family loved the taste and texture with these changes.

The flavour was good, however, it fell apart and we could not slice it.  Did not look particularly appetizing.  I would not make this recipe again.  I did substitute breadcrumbs for the oatmeal so possibly that was part of the problem.

Excellent recipe! I read everyone's tips and also sauted the onions and minced garlic first then I added fresh choppe up parsley, 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 TBS brown sugar, 1 TBS Worcestershire Sauce, 2TBS mustard and sprinkled some burger spice seasoning to give it an extra yummy flavor! It was mouth watering and very moist and flavorful! Thank you for this recipe :)

flavor was excellent, but it didn't stay together and needed much more filler.  also had to cook it for about 30 mins longer than called for in this recipe.

I use a recipe that is almost identical to this, I use bread instead of oatmeal and I never have the problem with it falling apart. I think mine stays together because I use the 20-30% fat hamburger (the cheap kind!). This is maybe why others are experiencing mushiness. I don't even do mine in a loaf pan. I shape it into a loafish kind of shape on a cookie sheet :-) Slices fine hot and cold for sandwiches too!

I have to say that everyone in my family (including my 2 boys) loved it.  My middle son actually said "this is the best meatloaf you've ever made".  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to add a lot more oats than the recipe called for because it was way too moist.  And also because it looks really ugly when it is done.  LOL  But it's a great recipe that just needs some adjusting.  Next time I may leave out the ketchup, which is really bad for you anyway.

My family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this dish!  My son said this was the best thing I ever cooked, but he is six years old, so what does he know? :-)  Seriously, it was fantastic and very easy!  This will be in regular rotation now.

Why change anything? It's great! But I did have to add more oats. I agree that the mustard is the key ingredient. Love it.

The taste was there, but mine did not set up.  When I cut into it, the "meatloaf" globbed on the plate.  Next time I would bake it in a casserole dish, as the picture shows, and hopefully that will help

I followed this recipe using 1lb ground chuck and 1lb  ground pork, omitted the tomato soup and used 1/4 cup ketchup as others recommended. This is a super easy recipe and very good! This is the first time I have used a loaf pan with my meatloaf, normally I shape it and put it on a wire rack above a roaster pan to allow the fat to drain off as it is cooking. The loaf pan made it simple (though not as healthy even after draining off the fat at the end.) I asked my 11 year old if she liked it, she replied, "This tastes really good, what did you do different?" I guess my old recipe needed an overhaul! I served this with macaroni and cheese and a vegetable on the side and Wholah, Dinner.

Good Meatloaf.  It was basic but better then some of the others I have tried.  I thought it was too runny when I was making it, but it turned out great!!

I have my own meatloaf recipe, but decided to try something new. This recipe looked good.  I used some other reviewer suggestions, reducing the amount of soup and ketchup and only one egg.  It tasted good, but the texture was mushy.  It crumbled rather than sliced (perhaps if I had used two eggs this wouldn't have happened).   In my opinion there were too many other ingredients that took away from the MEAT in meatloaf.  Though it was good, both of the men in the house said they prefer my meatloaf - that i've been making for years.

My husband is from the UK and once told me that all American girls should know how to make meatloaf. After a few disasters, I found this recipe. I did it exactly as written with the exception of the steak sauce. I used worcester instead. It stayed firm, not exactly sliceable, but moist and solid. We both loved the flavor. The only thing I would do differently is add salt to the mix.

I made this according to the recipe and despite the runniness, it was still delicious. I tried pouring some of the grease and liquid out, while holding the loaf in with a spatula, then put it back in the oven for 15 minutes and that seemed to help. Great meatloaf!

This was a good recipes. I like the mixture of ingredients. Somebody asked what happen because they meatloaf wouldn't stay together. I always look at pictures and it comes out like the picture if you following Ptrull directions.  It's more loose than a loaf. I notice after I had that tomato soup so I added enough bread crumbs and crushed saltine crackers to keep it together because I wanted more of a loaf.  So to keep it more of a loaf next time I will use less tomato soup. Thanks for the recipes.

I love this recipe!  The only thing i add is some club crackers (about half a sleeve).  It is mushy and moist but i don't like the dry meatloaf that some poeple do but the next day this is usually a little dryer and i have to add more ketchup on top.  I shape this in my covered baker (PC) and its perfect in an hour

I use 3/4 can of tomato soup.  1/4 cup rolled oats plus 1 cup of dry Italian bread crumbs and only 1/4 cup ketchup. Good.  Easy. Repeatable

I made this recipe following the instructions.  It was very moist (wet, actually) when it went into the pan and when it came out an hour later, it wasn't cooked through.  I am baking it as I type and I am on my second hour and 25 minutes and I STILL can't slice it.  It's quite possible 350 degrees is not enough, but at this point, I don't want to burn the top to a crisp.

Flavor was great, but would not use the oatmeal.  It was way too much and overpowering.  Would use much less of it, or use breadcrumbs.

I added 1/3 of a green onion finely chopped and doubled the steak sauce.  This meatloaf was a big hit.  I slow cooked in a crockpot for 5 hours and it was so juicey and tender!  Definitely will use this one again.

Mine had so much liquid in it that it was more like a casserole. I'm going to try again with a friend's help because I think it's mostly the high altitude that caused it to come out that way.

This is what my mom always made, with a few little changes.  Because we kids didn't like onion, she subbed a packet of onion soup mix.  Instead of the steak sauce, she used Worcestershire sauce and added some liquid smoke.  Also, she made a sauce of ketchup, brown sugar and yellow mustard for on top.  She always fried this up in her electric skillet with carrots, potatoes and stewed tomatoes surrounding the meatloaf.  Mmmm!

Great meatloaf....I did a couple of things because of not checking before starting the recipe...I replaced the rolled oats with bread crumbs because I did not have the oats in the house and didn't want to go out, only used 1/2 can of the tomato soup..but it came out great and it is now stored in my favorite recipes..

After reading some other reviews, I decided to omit the tomato soup. Also, the last meatloaf recipe I tried called for tomato soup, and it ended up mushy. Otherwise, this turned out fantastic. After baking, I drained grease, glazed with homemade ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Baked for about another 10-15 minutes. Mmmm! The wole family loved this!

The flavor is delicious, but the meatloaf is very mushy, this is my official filling for stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage rolls. ---cook the meatloaf,cool, divide it up in 1/4 c mounds on a cookie sheet,(it's easier to figure out portions for future use),  freeze them for an hour, divide into what ever portions you would need for one meal of stuffed peppers or cabbage,store in a zip lock in the freezer. To use as filling, defrost,  add cooked rice to defrosted meatloaf to make stuffing.It is perfect everytime!

I admit I am not the worlds number one fan of meatloaf, but my husband wanted this, so it was made. I agree it turned out more like a casserole than a meatloaf. My kids were not fond of this one either.

Very very tasty  - thank you!
Only wish I saw reviews as it was a trifle mushy - think just to add more rolled oats next time to combat this.

I loved the ingredients in this meatloaf. I made some changes based on what my family likes. I used half the can of soup, one egg, half the onion, no rolled oats at all, 2 Tbs worchestershire sauce, one Tbs prepared mustard, and 1/2 tbs of course black pepper. I used the other half the can of tomato soup along with 1 15oz can of tomato sauce, 1 Tbs brown sugar, 1 Tbs worchestershire, 1 tsp prepared mustard, and a sprinkle of black pepper to make a glaze. I baked the loaf at 350 for about 40 min. I drained off the grease then poured the glaze on top. Continued baking until the sauce was simmering, approx. 15-20 mins. Excellent!

I'm usually not into meatloaf but this was great. I followed some advice of others and omitted the soup and substituted worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce. I had 2 servings which was highly unsual for me and meatloaf!! It was great!

Ok so I use recipes as guides anyway.  I followed the advice of the reviews already listed and also cut the recipe in half (only had to feed 2 people). I cut the onion and soup.  I added steak seasoning and used Worcestershire instead of steak sauce. I also topped the meatloaf with BBQ sauce when we had about 10 min left to cook.  My husband told me to put the recipe in my box and use it a lot!

We liked this recipe! I did omit the tomato sauce and only put in 2 Tbsp of mustard (that's all I had left). it wasn't mushy. I think the reason other's have found it to be mushy is due to the amount of fat in the meat they use. Mine was 93% fat free, therefore less liquid due to fat!
Definatly a keeper! Thank you!

The flavor in this meatloaf was very good, however it turned out as "meat-mush" instead of loaf.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I would add more oatmeal or breadcrumbs next time.

i followed the suggestions of some of the reviews,ie bread crumbs,tomato paste duluted,ect but i also added fresh string beans (drained,rinse if using can) and that helped to hold it together,and the loaf pan with the holes punched out on the sides is a great idea,drains the fat..had my husband drill holes ..it held together and was moist but not crumbly..i also like the topping of the BBQ sauce spread on top near end of baking..to me this added a different and interesting taste..

Turned out great. I used the measurements for 2lbs of meat but used 2 1/2 pounds and it was great. Added a bit more mustard. Will do  it again.

tasted good but was too runny. Next time I'll use less tomato soup. I wish I'd read reviews first!

couldn't give this much more than a 2 star. Very mushy and fell apart. It did firm up somewhat after it cooled.Thought after I added the soup that it was gonna be runny and it was!

My husband LOVED this meatloaf, more than my usual, more complicated recipe. I heard him tell a friend that it was the best he'd ever tasted! However, it was a little loose in texture and did not slice well.  Also it did take more like 1 1/2 hrs to cook thoroughly.  Since my husband liked it so much, I'll definitely be making it again, but will work on getting a more loaf-like texture, maybe reducing the ketchup and putting it on top instead of in the meat, using very lean meat, etc.

Very good flavor.  I substituted bread crumbs for oats and I let cool a bit before slicing, that seems to help the problem with crumbling that very moist meatloaf (like this one) has.  I also drained some of the moisture about half way through cooking and again when it was finished.

This was delicious!  I was curious to try this as my mom used to make meatloaf with oats all the time.  I was out of steak sauce, so I subbed in Worcestershirer instead.  Moist and full of flavor - I will be making this again.  Thanks!

I didn't have tomato soup, so I used half a can of tomatoe sauce w/garlic.  I don't like oats in my meatloaf, so I substituted 1 cup crushed dried herb stuffing mix.  Cooked 1 hr then topped with BBQ sauce and heated another 10 min.  It was moist and flavorful!!

As always, I used ground turkey with this. We all thought this was very good but we didn't feel it tasted much different than most of the meatloaf recipes I've tried. I like putting a glaze on top of my meatloaf, so  I used some of the tomato soup and mixed in seasonings and a bit of barbeque sauce. For the reviewers who said that theirs fell apart, if you let the loaf rest awhile, that will certainly help. Again Pam, we really enjoyed this and I'm looking forward to having leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thank you!

Not bad, I cut it in half to feed 2 and I didn't add the catsup and mustard. I added 1/2 tsp of Schilling Grill Mates, Montreal Steak seasoning. It was really good but I think I'll add more Grill Mate next time. 
I used the leftover soup and 1 Tbls of Worchestershire to make a glaze for the meatloaf while it baked and a sauce for it once it was done. That worked out very well.

We thought this meatloaf was pretty good. I didn't have any tomato soup so I didn't add that. I did add some lawry's and pepper and spread some ketchup on top before baking like I do all meatloafs. I will make again and next time with the tomato soup. Thanks for the recipe!!

Good meatloaf! I did an even substitution of ground turkey for the beef and added about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs. I had no problems with it falling apart or being mushy. My husband and picky kids ate it all in one night.

A great recipe.  Made it for a small
get together and everyone loved it!  My 
fiance even complimented me on how close
it came to his mother's meatloaf (who is
the best cook in the world according to him).
My friends even called me the next day
to mention how good it was.  Thanks!

This recipe was easy and especially satisfying for my graving for meatloaf.  My whole family ate it and the leftovers proved perfect for sandwiches.  I make two loaves, one to eat and one to freeze.

So yummy! I omitted the tomato soup and used only 1/3 cup ketchup and added a little salt and pepper. I served it with rice and even my picky 2 year old liked it! I was a bit skeptical about the oats but I couldn't even tell they were in there. Will definitely be making this again.

I used this recipe to make a surprise candlelight dinner for my Fiance last night. I altered the recipe a little. I added Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce beings that was all we had. I had no onions so instead I put half a packet of liptons dry onion soup mix and a tsp of onion powder. I also added a 1/2 tbs of minced garlic. It came out amazing. The only problem I had with it is that it did fall apart and was slightly mushy. Flavor was amazing though. I would suggest adding some Garlic salt and finding a way to make it a stronger consistency. My fiance had no complaints and was very happy though. Thank you OP for the recipe!

I omitted the tomato soup and doubled this recipe. It was fabulous! My parents were in town so I wanted something good and simple. This met all the criteria and I got raves on how good it was, I think there was one slice left.

Seemed like it was missing some flavor, I also had trouble with the consistancy. Other than that this recipe was very easy and used common ingredients.

I give this one 4 stars!  5 for flavor, minus 1 for not holding together as well.  Didn't bother me or my family enough not to say "It's a keeper!".  I made it exactly as directed... except I didn't have any steak sauce so I used BBQ sauce.  Perfect flavor.  I love the fact that you use oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs!

This is more like a 4.5 rating.  Not quite a 5 because I had to make modifications.  I cut this recipe in half, omitted the tomato soup and added salt and pepper. Even so it was a bit runny but cooked great. It was crumbly coming out of the pan, however.   I liked the chewiness of the oatmeal but will either reduce the amount by about a third or substitute bread crumbs next time to see how that works. This is a really "classic" meatloaf taste and might be even better with a bit of chopped green pepper.

It was ok but I didnt use the whole can of soup because of others review's and I found that I should have because it was not as juicy as I would have liked it. Im sure it was partially my error here but it has good potential

This was ok. I think it would've been better, had it not been for "user error"! I added some crushed Wheatabix for a filler and i omitted the tomato soup. The flavor was still good, but my boyfriend and I were never huge fans of meatloaf to begin with. I just had some ground beef that I needed to use up. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans AND I made some gravy to go over it. It wasn't too bad but I migt have to work on this one... :)

I followed the recipes step by step except for I used ground turkey instead of beef.  It was a total flop.  We couldnt even eat it.  It went out to the dog.  Im not a big meatloaf fan to begin with, now Im really not one!

After reading all the other reviews, I started out with trying to take out some of the mush.

I used the recipe and added 3/4 pound of ground beef and 1 cup of bread crumbs...

Turned out great..Still had a little moisture, but had good texture for forming loaf, and standing up when slicing..

Will definitely be making again.

Boy, what a mistake!  I was missing one key ingredient for my usual meatloaf, so I thought I'd try this one.  I read about others having mushy meatloaf results, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal, but it was still mushy.  It fell appart when we tried to cut it and the soft consistency was not appealing.  Maybe the fact that I used ground chuck contributed to the problem?  Anyways, I'm going back to my tried and true "Ann's Sister's Meatloaf" also on this website.  It's wonderful.

I am giving it a definate four stars for flavoring.   In addition to the other ingrediants, I also added some cheese to the mix.  I didn't have onions so I added a Lipton's beef onion soup pouch.  Then I also put cheese on top of the loaf toward the last ten minutes of the bake time.  The result was delicious!   However, I'd give it a three for setting.  Like so many of the other reviewers, my loaf fell apart.  It was complete and utter mush. Despite the mushy factor though, it didn't inhibit the flavor in any way shape or form.  Next time, I'll be sure to add some more oats to it and perhaps just a little less tomato soup.

This recipe was good though im not a huge fan of meatloaf; I did modify the recipe slightly by adding a squirt of ketchup and approx 1/2 cup buttery crackers,I also topped it with a glaze found on this site, which made it better. I also had some leftover mixture and made burgers on onion rolls with the glaze in lieu of condiments-everyone loved the burgers too.

Wonderful.  I halved the recipe and put the ketchup on top instead of mixing it in and I added a small clove of minced garlic.  Fantastic!  Only 4 stars because my family still likes my usual recipe better.  I was out of bread crumbs and so found this.  I will definitely use it again.

I followed directions measuring carefully. It smelled wonderful cooking and I was very much looking forward to eating this meat loaf. I let it sit for a few minutes, and then when trying to remove it from the loaf pan, it completely fell apart into a mushy mess. I scooped it up, put it in a casserole dish and covered it with the mashed potatoes and baked it-we are about to eat now-I'm now calling it Shepherd's Pie! Let's hope it tastes better than it looks!

I read other reviews about how the meatloaf was mushy so I thought I could improve it. This is how I put it together. I had about one and 3/4 pounds of ground beef so I cut the ingredients down a little. I used 3/4 of a medium onion, 3/4 cup of oatmeal, 2/3rds of the can of tomato soup, one egg, 1/2 tablespoon of steak sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup and one and a half tablespoons of mustard. I did add salt and black pepper, also. I topped the loaf with the remaining 1/4 cup of ketchup. This meatloaf tasted very good, but it did still have the mushy texture and it fell apart. I will try it again and decrease the oatmeal as I think this might be the problem.

This meatloaf was to mushy, my family hated it.
It needs something to keep the meat more together, such as bread crumps or something.

Amazing! But I do think my few changes made a difference.  Recipe as is except swap the oats for minute rice and add finely chopped carrots and celery that are cooked with a little olive oil, minced onion and garlic pepper and salt until soft. Add that to the mix with that minute rice and it makes a great binder. No bread crumbs needed! Made herb butter rice and green beans for my sides... Perfect!

Fixed this tonight for the second time this week.  All I can think about is meat loaf now!  I also did a tad of substituting but only because I didn't have some of the ingredients, tomato soup and steak sauce became catsup and Worcestershire sauce.  I'm positive it would be delicious in the original version but LOOOOOOVED mine!

I just don't get it, this was a mushy blob.  A big waste of good ingredients.  And it didn't taste like meat loaf at all -- I would call it a meat spread.  That's what I ended up doing by making sandwiches, putting it on buns like a hearty spread with lettuce, cheese and tomatoes.  I read all the remarks and tried to make the proper adjustments, (like adding bread crumbs, less mustard, more time cooking, etc.) but still it was not right.  It smelled nice, but tasted nothing like good old-fashioned meat loaf.

Good recipe, I should have extracted the water from my onions before mixing everything together.  Baked for one hour twenty minutes in gas oven with internal temperature 155 degrees.  Wife went back for seconds!

Good "basic" recipe but I add lots of stuff that I like and give it some color too like colored sweet peppers & fried vadalia onions.                 Also bake to 175 degrees with an instant thermometer no matter what the recipe calls for even if using 1-lb of beef it still takes longer to reach correct doneness in my oven anyway.

I put the mixture in the fridge for an hour or longer before cooking it and I use a cookie cooling rack covered in foil on a cookie sheet and cooked it that way works great

I followed the recipe exactly. It is quick and easy, which i love! And everyone loved the taste. It came out very runny. When it was almost cooked i drained it  and it fell apart... so i spooned it into a cake pan at this point it was about an inch thick cooked it for another 15 min @ 325 degrees. Although it didn't look great it came out of the pan much drier not runny at all..and it was delicious! I will cook it again.

My meatloaf had great flavor. Honestly you Do Not need that whole can of tomato sauce. I used the meatloaf sauce in the can.It already has alot of flavor and I followed the recipe for everything else. Mine was to soft and on the verge of falling completely apart. Family loved the taste but didn't care for the softness. It was liked minced meat

I wanted an easy to make meat loaf, so tried this recipe.  The only two ingredients  I didn't 
 have was the canned tomato soup and the oats.  So I  did not use any soup and substituted  about one cup of dried bread crumbs for oats.  My loaf held together very well.  Easy to prepare and was  a pretty darn good meat loaf.

Love changing this one up with whatever's on hand.  Split the measurement of the steel cut oats with garlic and herb bread crumbs.   Only had Costco's creamy basil soup on hand; used 3/4 cup.  Worcestershire instead of steak sauce.  Added salt, pepper and lots of  fresh minced parsley.   It was a winner tonight as the snow was piling up!

It was too sloppy. I should have cut down on the soup. I didn't like the appearance of large flakes of oatmeal so I put most of it in a food processor. The flavor was great. I also zapped the onions in the microwave which precooked them.  Overall a good taste but not an attractive presentation.

Follow recipe. It will be great. I mixed soup, sauce, ketchup, and mustard in a separate bowl and saved 1/4 a cup of the mixture and topped meatloaf with it the last 5 minutes of cooking time. Really good meatloaf. We don’t usually like the more traditional meatloaf so we were pleasantly surprised!!

For some reason the texture turned out a bit off. Took a whole two hours to cook for me to feel comfortable eating the meat. I will try it again and hope something is different but not a recipe I would jump to making.

Used this recipe for my 1st time making meatloaf. Turned out good, my husband loves the flavor. Used Worcestershire in place of steak sauce. My husband said it needed an extra egg (3 eggs total) to hold it together. Will try again soon.

I omitted the soup entirely and used 1/2 an onion which I sauteed before adding to the mixture. I loved this recipe using the rolled oats! Next time I make it, I need to find out how to omit more moisture, I would have like it to be a bit more firm.

I used deer meat and tomato sauce because I didn't have tomato soup. I also mixed a little ketchup, mustard and A1 and poured it on top the last few minutes. Mine was crumbly because deer is full fat which doesn't drain in a loaf. It would have been more compact if I had drained it half way through. Great taste though!!

Very tasty. I'll use it again, although my favourite meatloaf recipe is Beef Peach Pie from this site. The oatmeal did make it a bit mushier than usual, but my husband liked that it was oatmeal instead of bread. Made him feel it was a bit healthier. I didn't have tomato soup on hand so just used tomato passata in about the same quantity (didn't measure anything). Oh, and I just used one egg. Two seemed unnecessary.

Rolled oats instead of bread crumbs? Who knew. Simple and very good. Alison

Finger Lickin!  My meatloaf ALWAYS crumbles.  I'm trying to figure it out.  But this one did it the least.  The rolled oats are a little healthier than the breadcrumbs, and I think this is going to be my base recipe for meatloaf from now on.  I did omit the ketchup, since there was tomato soup.  And we served it with a creamy mushroom sauce.

I made this meatloaf a few weeks ago and it was one of my favorites, even the family loved it (and they get upset when I change meatloaf recipes).  I followed the receipe exact, except I was out of steak sauce so I used Worcestershire sauce, it was great...and mine didn't fall apart, just used some extra breadcrumbs if needed. And of course the leftovers were even better.  We will be enjoying it again tonight.   Thanks !
