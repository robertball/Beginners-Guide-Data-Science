Although I don't care for these (I can only  handle as much as a sip b/c I don't like drinks with milk or cream in them) but are very popular among my friends. I use cream instead of milk (as from my old bartending days) and kalunha for the "coffee" flavored portion. They do taste like rootbeer floats! Amts right on Helena!

This was my drink of choice tonight.

I changed out the coffee liqueur for vanilla vodka (for more of a kick) and used half-n-half and rootbeer.

Quite the kick. I'd drink this again. This is like the Root Beer Float's drunk uncle.

Although this drink was not very strong,  it tasted exactly like a root beer float!
It was really yummy!

Had some Root Beer Schnapps I bought on a whim but had no idea what to do with. This was so easy to make and YUMMY.
