The key to avoiding a soggy mess (from water collecting under lid) is b4 you put the lid on to cook first lay a kitchen towel across top of pan then put lid on and fold edges of towel up over lid, can secure with clips to avoid towel catching fire. I used part whole wheat flour and yogurt instead of cream.

It's not a bad recipe, but I say drop the cream and use low fat vanilla yogurt. On our rating system, we gave it a 7/10. I'd say less sugar in the blueberry mix and more sugar in the dumplings.

We enjoyed eating this, we took the other reviewers idea and took a bit of sugar out of the berries and added it to the dumplings.  YUM!

Used fresh blueberries with 1/3 c. water, so the sugar was just right, except I used Morena cane sugar rather than the white sugar. It was great! Oh, and I removed the lid a few times to remove the water that collected under it so the dumplings wouldn't get soggy.

There should be some guidelines as to the cooking time for the dumplings.
Also, my whole family's teeth are stained blue. I know this can happen with any bluberry recipe, but I'm wondering if the cast iron pan boosted the effect.

Too sweet, needed to cut the sugar a bit, and it worked better With the exces sugar added to he dough.
