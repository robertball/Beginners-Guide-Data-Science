Mmm, mmm good.  We could have used more than the one smallish squash I used, as our pork chops were pretty big.  I blanched the squash to make it easier to peel and really could have made the slices at least 1/4" thick to keep them from overcooking.  Used seasoned salt, doubled the other spices, added some marojam and poultry seasoning.  Then used the chop drippings for half the butter and browned the onion before adding the flour, spices, and broth.  This was a major hit.  Next time I will double the squash and cut thicker, but it was still *so* good.

I put the chops, squash and sauce into a casserole dish, covered at baked as directed.  The pork was tender, the squash was mushy and the overall dish lacked flavor.  If I make this again I will cut the squash much thicker and add more seasoning. This was very easy to prepare.

This was DELICIOUS!  I used a huge butternut squash - it was rather difficult to cut so next time I think I will poke holes in it and microwave it a little to soften it up.  I also cut the squash circles in half.  I used boneless pork chops and it finished a little quicker.  I doubled spices and it was perfect!

This was a good dish.  I took the advice of others and cut my squash a bit thicker which worked out well.  I trimmed this down to a dish for two and used a small acorn squash.  We will do this again :~)

Reduced serving to two but used whole squash. Halved squash and cooked 2min. in microwave to make peeling the squash easier. Added ginger & thyme to flour mixture, to dust pork, before brownig. Layerd 2cups cooked wild rice, cooked in sodium free beef broth for flavor. Doubled butter/spice mixture to pour over top to add some extra flavor to the rice. Will make again with my minor adjustments.

Very tasty and easy. I had a delicata squash, worked fine. Did cut squash thicker and doubled spices as recommended. I also added sliced apples and craisins to the squash layer. Yum!

I love to search by ingredient on Allrecipe.  That's how I get to find recipes like this that haven't been given too much attention.  Earlier reviewers tipped me to cutting the squash thicker, which I did and it was cooked through completely.  I also added a beet, since I had it on hand and that made that half pink, but it was good.  Solid comfort food.  Could be spiced up a LOT for more interest, but if you're looking for something warm and filling and non-challenging, this will do the trick.

To be as Low Cal as it is, it's very good! I used Zucchini and Yellow Squash, added some Crushed Red Pepper and then sprinkled Mozzarella on as a finisher. Included a side of steamed baby carrots with rosemary. Will have again!

I genuinely enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  However, the top layer of squash just did not cook thru even after adding 10 minutes to the cooking time.  In order to ensure that we didn't dry out the pork we ended up cooking the top squash in the microwave after removing it from the oven.  Our slices were about 1/4inch thick following the suggestions of not over cooking and the layer UNDER the pork was done perfectly.  I will plan to make this again, probably with more broth mixture to give moisture/steam for cooking the squash or maybe putting all the squash under the pork.

I loved this recipe...first time cooking with squash.  I cut my squash into round pieces and I added a little milk to my gravy.  The ginger and thyme seasonings were excellent!  Thanks

Except for doubling the spices, made per recipe.  Very nice flavor as is but I think I will add some poultry seasoning and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper next time.   Very good for watching calories and still getting your "comfort food".   But if you aren't watching calories that closely I  think this sauce would go well with potatoes subbing for the squash.  Either way it got rave reviews from hubby.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a delicious recipe, but the preparation is a big pain!!  I haven't figured out an easy way to peel and slice the squash.  Also, there are so many different pots and pans and bowls needed for the prep, that cleaning up is as much work as making the dish.  Overall, it is one of the yummiest recipes that we make!!!

Absolutely delicious! We used an extra squash and it is so worth it to make your own sauce with this dish. The flavors are delicious!

Cut the squash 1/2 inch and used my turkey broth from Thanksgiving that had mustard and lemon in it. That mustard flavor gave it a special kick to it. Love it!

I also LOVE this recipe!  I used a pork loin instead of chops and used a large butternut squash that I sliced into thick slices.  After browning the loin, I used the drippings in my gravy.  I also loved the ginger and thyme flavoring.  This was easy and fast to prepare.
