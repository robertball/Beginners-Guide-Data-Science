This tasted pretty good.  Kind of like chocolate pudding.  The sauce broke apart when put on c some ice cream but the taste was there.  Not sure if I would set out to make this intentionally but in a pinch I would likely use the recipe. I made a half recipe just in case it was not to our liking and I'm glad I did.
