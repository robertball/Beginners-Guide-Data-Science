Changes: had to add another 1/4 (maybe 1/2 I should've measured) cup of milk to get the batter to the right consistency for pancakes; used regular chocolate chips as I didn't have minis on hand; made four BIG pancakes rather than little ones (and a note if anyone's making this with regular choc milk mix: the Carnation pouches are 40g). Unfortunately they turned out rather dense and tough from all the extra mixing required to get the extra milk worked in. Flavour was okay not overly impressed. Difficult to tell when they needed to be flipped as the batter didn't bubble the way regular pancakes do (not sure if it's because of the whole wheat? Or just because they were overmixed?). Probably won't make them again I'm sure there are better recipes out there for chocolate pancakes.
