I think if you would add an additional 1/2 cup to cup of oatmeal, it would be better, more like a chewy oatmeal cookie with lots 'o' oats! Great recipe, great flavor, I just thought it needed more oatmeal and it would be fabulous!!!

Good cookie, but too cake-like for my liking...great flavor though and buttermilk is a nice touch!

great way to use up buttermilk.  I did add 1/2 tsp. salt, as I used unsalted butter and without it, I think they would have tasted a bit bland.  The spice proportions were good and did come through without overpowering the cookie.  Added some walnuts from more texture.  These are a cake-like cookie, which is not a bad thing and a nice change of pace.  thanks for the recipe.

A very good oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. The cookies are moist -- you can leave them in the oven a little longer if you prefer them crisp. While the finished product very much resembles the classic oatmeal raisin cookie, the addition of the buttermilk and spices makes the raw dough much yummier!

Tastes like spiced cake.  Cookies are also quite cakey.  Being that I prefer crunchier cookies, I will not likely make these again.

I thought they were very good.  I did not have all spice so I substituted a little bit of cloves and instead of nuts, I used butterscotch bits.  It was a great way of using up some of the baking supplies from the holidays.

GREAT idea for a cookie - I was truthfully looking how to use up buttermilk from another cookie I make at Christmastime . . . and these are delightful! You may want to add your own twists (as I did): 1) any nut works well - I used either walnut or almonds (whatever I had on hand and wanted to use up - made multiple batches of these at different times); 2) any dried fruit works well too - I used dried cherries in one batch, and dried plums in another - fantastic result; 3) I kept it a little healthier by substituting olive oil for the butter (at a ratio of .75 oil to 1 butter), and used cooked oat groats instead of the rolled oats (as we had oat groats on hand) - even with these subs the flavor is still very good and just a hint of richness (not overdoing it). Kept the sugar amount the same but might cut back just the tiniest amount on that in the future. ONE KEY NOTE: I did find it was important to up the baking time to about 15 minutes.

I  didn't have all of the spices except for cinnamon,  I added a extra 1/2 cup of  oats,  chocolate chips, and vanilla.  These cookies reminded me of the cookies my mom made. I really likedon't these cookies.

I am not a very good cook but I made these.   I put 2 cups of oats in instead of one I also put cranberries and chopped walnuts in. I think they were the best cookies  I've ever made  I will definitely make these again just not today because I drop the box of oats  on my kitchen counter so now I have a nice big cleanup to do

My family loved these cookies! But I found out that if you put 2 cups of oats instead of 1 1/2 cups they cook better and they don't fall apart as easily.
