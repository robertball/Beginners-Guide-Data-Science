Absolutely delicious cake! I'm so impressed with everything about this: how easily it comes together, the amazing flavor, and how it's moist without being super soggy! I did add a bit more spices than called for (1 1/2 tsps cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each of ginger, cloves, nutmeg, allspice) because we enjoy a strong spiced flavor. My cake also only needed to bake for 50 minutes, and it rose a lot in the middle! This is a very tall cake for a tres leches--but that doesn't affect how good it is! I also used a full can of each of the evaporated and sweetened condensed milk, then added a cup of half and half. Since the cake was so tall, it absorbed the extra liquid no problem. Topped it with homemade unsweetened whipped cream instead of whipped topping too. Will make this again and again! Thank you for the recipe!
