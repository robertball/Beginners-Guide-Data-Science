The more I make this recipe the better it comes out.  You can use 2 8" cake pans instead of the bags.  You will be adding more than 4 cups of flour.  6 is more like it.  I have made this in all seasons and more flour is needed.  The proofing is a bit odd but it does work just fine.  Sprinkle, do not mix.  Leave alone for 5-10 mins until dissolved. then proceed with the 1/2 cup of flour, cover with plastic and let sit 30 mins.  The milk portion only needs to be dissolved. Now beat your sugar, eggs, and vanilla.  Add the milk portion then the 'starter' you proofed for 30 mins.  Use a second bowl to cut the butter into the flour.  Do this by cutting the 12 tbls of butter into 1/2 inch cubes and toss them into the 3.5 cups of flour.  Now use the paddle and mix on slowest speed and mix until it looks like crumbs. Now you can add the egg mixture then up the speed for about 3 mins.  Your mixer will freak out a bit but add the fruits and now add more flour until it leaves the side of the bowl.  Sticky is ok but it needs to look like bread dough and not cookie dough.  Proof, punch, divide, shape, place into pans and proof again.

My grandma was Italian and we made Panettones every year as a family tradition. This recipe is very close to the one I use. Yes, It need salt 1 1/4 tsp for 4 cups flour. Also the instruction are bit complicated. When I do mine put the flour in the center of the table open the center and add the liquids, yeast and eggs mix a bit with some flour to make a soft dough almost creamy.. Sponge for 30 min. Add the sugar, egg yolks, soften butter, and flavoring like vanilla, zest. Make a soft dough and let double in size. Add the fruits. Put in the mold and do a X cut on top. I use this technique and always turn out great!

Isn't there supposed to be a little salt?  It tasted like something was missing, and then it dawned on me that there's no salt in the recipe.

Absolutely to die for. I put in orange extract instead of vanilla. Like other reviewers, i added in more flour, 1/2 bread flour & 1/2 AP flour. The texture is so light & fluffy. So, so good. I made Panettone 1 the other day & found it a little dryish for my taste. Will make this over & over again,that's for sure. A 10 stars recipe!

I only adjusted this recipe by using 1 cup candied fruit (because that is all I had on hand at the time) and 1 cup sultanas soaked in a little warm brandy.  And, I found I had to add maybe a cup or more flour than called for in the recipe after the first rise because the dough was too soft to knead.  But the finished product was excellent.  The taste was delicate, not too sweet and the texture was light.  It yielded 2 large loaves using the round brown panettone paper baking forms.  This was at least as good if not better than any bought panettone I have tasted.

I had trouble adding the yest to the milk it seamed to clump on me. I then added the yeast to 1/4 cup water with a little sugar. once it was dissolved I added it to the milk and carried on from there. The bread was to die for.

This was my first time making panettone after many many times eating store-bought. And I was very impressed! Tastes just as good as store-bought, plus you can customize the add-ins (I used all raisins, cuz I've never liked candied fruit). I used 2 round cake pans, and it turned out great, albeit a bit the wrong shape!

The recipe is great and it was delicious! I added a little bit more flour because the dough was not right. I used King Arthur Bread Flour. My variation: I used 1 cup of candied fruit including raisings, 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.

Wow! Amazing cake. The moment the dough was mixed together...the aroma of the entire kitchen was absolutely divine. 

I did, however, made some modifications to kick it up a notch

*Instead of candied fruits, I used 2 cups total of golden raisins, currants, and cranberries. And I also soaked them in hot marsala wine for 30 min. AMAZING.

*Used fresh yeast instead of dried yeast

*added 1 1/2 tsp of sea salt

*Let dough proof for 5 hours (instead of 2) at the final stage.

* Cooked it in a bundt pan so that inside is more evenly cooked

Superb Panettone!  It's light, flakey, buttery and it melts in your mouth.  I soaked the rasins/cranberries in warm Amaretto/peach schnapp for few hours.  Working with the wet dough, creates a lovely crumb and only used extra flour when handling the (thick batter)dough. I've made Panettone I, which is great and lower in fat; however, this recipe produces another dimension of flavors and texture due to the addition of butter.  I used evaporated milk, 1 tsp of salt; produced 2 large Panettone loaves in bundt pans.  Thanks for sharing Stephanie!

the end result was a delicious bread with a beautiful crumb. However I am ambivalent to rate 5 stars due to the lack of salt. Immediately saw it not on the list and salt is necessary to enhance the flavor of any food or baked good.  I added 1 tsp. sea salt and it was plenty. I did have to proof it much longer (more like 5 hrs) but was not surprised due to the fruit add-ins. yeast doughs always take longer to rise when they are there. Also had to add about 2 cups more flour to be able to work with it. I don't have a stand mixer so even doing it by hand, it turned out beautiful and just like store bought. I did also add a bit of lemon zest.

This was a great recipe! The texture was beautiful. It does need salt though. The sweetness was balanced, but I like my panettone a little sweeter; so I increased to 3/4 cup. Also be careful not to overbake. Next time I may bring it down to 350 degrees.

I just love this recipe, and will make I again.  I did use about a cup more flour and next time I'll be adding a little salt and maybe a third cup more sugar, but it's light and airy and scrumptious.  My house smells Indescribably delicious.

Dough was more of a batter and difficult to work with and put in panettone forms. Dough collapsed before placing in the oven even working in sloooow moooootion. Cooking temperatures were too high and tops burned.

This was my first time making Panettone. It turned out great & it will certainly not to be my last time making it, next time I will half the recipe. Used orange instead of vanilla and followed THOMJANICE review.  I made it into two 8 in. round tins. Just wish it would stay fresh for more than two days as I am the only one at home now who eats it.

But where do you get the oven-safe baking bags? [Sur le Table, for one. Do(ug)h!] I'm ambitious to try making this for Christmas--my best friend raves about panettone French toast. 

This sounds like panettone from a completely different universe to what I've been buying for years. You know--the ones that are in stores 6 weeks before Christmas? God knows what they must do to them to keep them "fresh" that long.
