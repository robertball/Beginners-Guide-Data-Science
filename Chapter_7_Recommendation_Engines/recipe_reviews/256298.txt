We thought this was very tasty.  Making the individual parts of the dish separately and then adding them together would make it very easy, too.  Mine did take a while longer to bake because the dish I used was a thick one that I'm sure took longer to cook through.  I did have to use ancho chili powder rather than the adobo seasoning, and I used a cob of fresh corn rather than the canned.  Otherwise I followed the ingredient list.  I will make it using adobo seasoning next time.  Thank you so much, Bibi!

This was very good! Made it to the recipe but I made this in a skillet. The tomatoes  really added a lot of flavor to this dish. Next time I'm keeping the juices as well so the rice can  soak it up. Great, easy to make weeknight dinner!

Delicious! For taste preference, I added some seasoning salt to the rice mixture before it went into the oven.

I made this today. I absolutely loved the chicken part and the seasonings on it and toppings. I followed the ingredients, but just cooked the chicken in a pan and then broiled it for a couple of minutes once adding the topping and cheese. It still stayed pretty moist. I used thin cut chicken breasts too. I plan to write that part of the recipe down to save and definitely make it again soon. The rice is good, I just made it on the stove top, but it made a lot. It reminded me of Mexican restaurant style rice. I may make a second dish out of it this week adding meat etc. The chicken really would go well with a lot of different side dishes regardless. Thank you, so much!
