Very easy and fun to make.  Cook time took longer than we thought, maybe due to all the extras inside!  We cooked it on the grill outside, on top of tin foil so it didn't flame up underneath.  Wonderful combo of flavors.  Next time we'll try some other stuffing ingredients for fun.

This was very good. This was a rare occasion that I followed a recipe exactly as written. The only thing I would do differently is to omit the salt (keeping the herbs) from the fruit & nut mixture. The salt was a little overpowering, but otherwise it came out as I would have expected. I will be making this again.
