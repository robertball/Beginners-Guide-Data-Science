I was so happy with this recipe. I tried it with 2 eggs instead of egg substitute and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cup of white flour, and 1/2 cup of soy flour, instead of 3 cups of white flour, for added protein and fiber.

Well, its funny with this one.  I made this bread when I had a baby sized zucchini on my hands (and still had half leftover after the recipe!) and wasn't sure it had turned out as moist as I had hoped on the first night as I tried it still-hot from the pan.  Ironically by the next day it was fabulous.  It didn't have that stretchy texture that sometimes comes with applesauce-substituting recipes.  And so here I am, 3 days later and still absolutely loving this still moist bread.  I did change a couple of things.  I added a small handful of chopped walnuts and a couple handfuls of raisins.  I also ended up using two egg whites instead of the substitute.  Oh, and I actually did about half whole wheat and half white flour.  Overall, the recipe was excellent and none the worse for my "creative" cooking :-)  A keeper for sure!!!

When looking for a recipe I found this one with less sugar.  This is much better for a dibetic.  All enjoyed this recipe.

Using applesauce as a fat substitute sometimes makes my bread products rubbery, but not with this recipe. The bread was delightfully moist, dense and flavorful. I even used half white, unbleached flour and half whole wheat pastry flour. I also added a 1/4 TSP ground nutmeg and 1/4 TSP ground ginger along with the 1 TSP cinnamon and left out the vanilla extract all together. This recipe yielded 5 baby loaves, baked at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes only. The bread was even tastier and spicier the next day. I never need to bake a full-fat version again. :):)

This is a great recipe.  I actually made mini-muffins using this recipe.  I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of oatmeal in place of the flour.  I used applesauce in place of the oil and only used 3/4 cup sugar.  I also did not have enough zucchini so I shredded some carrots.  It turned out great.  Because, I used no oil in the recipe, I did lightly spray the muffin cup liners with a little oil.

Really tasty.  I didn't use egg substitute I used two eggs, so not as lowfat as originally listed but much healthier than some of the other recipes.  Thought it was a little sweet and would use less sugar.  The extra loaf freezes well.

I expected this to be dry but it wasn't although it certainly isn't as moist as most quick breads. I cut the sugar by 1/4 of a cup, used whole wheat flour, and used baby food applesauce. I also added 1/4 tsp. each ginger and nutmeg. It turned out to be very tasty - despite the whole wheat flour it was very light.

Very tasty! Great flavor, not heavy. Doesn't taste like a "light" recipe at all! Thank you for sharing this.

Note: in place of egg substitute, you can use 2 large egg whites mixed with 1 Tbsp. dry milk to equal 1/4 cup of substitute. I did this since I didn't have any egg beaters on hand.

I made this bread yesterday for my fam and it was great! added chocolate chips to some. and i substituted more than half the sugar for splenda, and 2/3 of the flour for whole wheat white flour. next time i'll do all whole wheat white! it was moist and tasted fab. My dad usually doesn't like healthier versions but he loves his mini-loaf with nuts in it.

This zucchini bread is so good - and you wouldn't know that it's light!  I used 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour to make it a little more nutritious.  It was just so perfect!

For a light bread, this turned out really delicious!  I added a grated carrot to the batter for some extra nutrition.  It actually tasted better/more moist the day after I made it...I will make this one again!

AMAZING!! TRY THIS RECIPE!!  I cannot believe it is light!  It is now a staple recipe of mine.  I did have some trouble.. followed the recipe exactly and it was WAY to dry, so i added more applesauce and oil.  I may have dried the zucchini too much.

Great recipe!  Followed directions exactly with the exception of 2 regular eggs instead of substitute and did 1.5 c white flour and 1.5 c wheat flour.  Came out great, even for this beginner.

This has become one of my staple go-to recipes, and the reason I keep applesauce in my fridge.  I usually don't have zucchini, but substitute peeled apple and it turns out wonderfully moist.  I've used different apples and Fuji actually works really well (although it's not your typical baking apple).

Very good!  I have made this many times, as directed. also, have tried using splenda for baking instead of sugar and was still great.  My young children and their friends LOVE this, and is a good way to get my picky eaters to eat vegetables! I just tell them it is 'cake'!  haha.

I made this recipe as a healthy snack for my three kids.  I made some modifications, I used half whole wheat flour and half white, two eggs instead of substitute, and only 3/4 cup of sugar.  I made them into muffins and my 7 year old son said they were the best muffins in the whole world! I make a batch of these a week, and they go quickly!

This is a great recipe. Add some nuts and its perfect! Is one of the better low fat. If you add applesauce it makes it dense and sticky.

I combined this recipe with the Chocolate Chip Orange Zuchini Bread recipe for a real treat.  I only used 1 cup of white sugar, but added 3 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped walnuts.  Used a full cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  Also added 2 Tbsp orange zest and 1 tsp nutmeg.  Sounds like a whole new recipe, and I guess it is, but these are nice little additions that allow some variation.

Just got finished making this bread, and although it tastes wonderful, the cook time was WAY off. Even though it says to bake for 1 hour 15 minutes, mine was looking done after 45! I left it in the oven for a few minutes after that because it seemed too soon, but once I took it out of the oven, it was slightly overdone. Not as soft or moist as I would expect it to be. So I recommend keeping a watchful eye on this bread!

Moist, healthy, and a definite keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly although I only baked it for about 25 minutes--perhaps my oven is too hot.

I used 2 mashed bananas, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 of the flour as whole wheat flour, 1 cup nuts, 1 cup chocolate chips. The batter was a bit dry so I added some vanilla yogurt. Cooked in a single large loaf pan about 10 minutes longer. Everyone loved it.

To die for zucchini bread! This is what I give to new neighbors as a housewarming gift and what I'll give to the trainers at my gym for Christmas. I typically make one loaf with nuts, one without. Scrumptious!

I know I did something wrong.  I doubled the recipe is where it went wrong.  The batter was so dry I added some more egg, some oil, so water, trying to get the right texture to it.  I baked them and of course the flavor is "watered" down.  I read through the recipe over and over again trying to figure out what it was......never did figure it out.  Oh well, maybe I'll try and and figure out what I did wrong the first time.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is great, very flavorful.  Since it makes two loaves, with the second loaf I add mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts so there are two choices, not just one.  I'll continue making this one in the future!

I made a change in the recipe by substituting Splenda for the sugar.  I knew the bread might taste a little different, but it was not very moist.  It was okay, but the flavor was not as good as other zucchini bread I have tasted.  I guess I will need to make it again using the sugar to be able to give it an honest review.

Yum!  This zucchini bread was awesome...my husband loved it and he usally does not eat many breads!  I used half wheat flour and half white and it was still good. It cooked in my oven in about 50 minutes...so watch it when your cooking to not over cook. Planning on making this again...it was delicious!

This bread is delicious!  Even my husband, who is very leary of eating anything with zucchini, liked it!  Instead of the 2 loaf pans suggested, I used 3 small loaf pans and used the remaining batter to make muffins.  I adjusted the baking time to 30 minutes for the muffins, and about 45 minutes for the small loaf pans.  I also used cinnamon applesauce, for extra "cinnamony" taste.

This is a delicious bread.  The applesauce makes it very moist.  To give it more protein and crunch, I added 1/2 to 2/3 cup of chopped pecans - you can also use walnuts if you prefer.

I would suggest only 1 cup of sugar and more zucchini. This is an adequate recipe but not enough flavor for me. Maybe if I added some walnuts. More spice might help, too.

great recipe- added less sugar- about 1.25 cups only... and a touch of nutmeg and ginger powder.  dont overdry the zucchini.  used homemade applesauce from this website-made it all the more fresh and delicious.  Made 3 mini-loaves, cooked for only 50 min.

There is a reason why it's light, half the flavor is gone as well.  Ok, but I've made better.
