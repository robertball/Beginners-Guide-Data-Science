I tried this on a whim when the hubster wasn't home. It was great! Very satisfying; very easy. I added some feta cheese just because I had some, and it blended in well.

I was looking for a salad to serve at a Christmas party for guests who needed gluten-free food, and decided to give this recipe a try. This salad was a huge hit! It was the perfect blend of red and green to appear festive, and I added feta cheese as someone else suggested, and it was the perfect touch! Even my daughter, who had never heard of lentils before, raved about it. I did have to exclude the garlic, because that is a migraine trigger for me, but it had plenty of flavor regardless. I will definitely be making this again, and not just during the holidays!!

Followed directions exactly and loved the combination of flavors.  Excellent as a side or a vegan main dish.

I make a variety of lentil salad.The roasted garlic was what made this one stand out !
Followed as is except that my lentils took 20 minutes to cook.

it was pretty good,  I used a white balsamic vinegar, it made the dish "prettier"  I also added some chopped fresh thyme, and oregano.

I like a sharper garlic bite, so in addition to the roasted garlic I added three minced cloves to the salad and it came out fantastic! Definitely will make this again!

I had never made lentils before, and I think the recipe is great, but I realized I just don't like lentils.  My husband who hates them actually liked them this way, so it's definitely a great recipe.

This recipe is going into my monthly rotation. It's delicious! I made no changes to the recipe. I was afraid it would be too garlicky, but it's not.

This was my first time making lentils. Never a big fan as a kid but this was light and very satisfying. I doubled the green onions - we like tangy onion  here!  Also added feta cheese crumbles to the mix as some others have. The amount of tomato was spot on. Iâ€™ll totally do this again. It makes a huge amount - perfectly easy lunch for us during the work week!

I added mint and basil too - personal
preference.

Excellent flavor.  Tastes better after it sat the next day.  I love the roasted garlic flavor.  I will make it & serve it again.
