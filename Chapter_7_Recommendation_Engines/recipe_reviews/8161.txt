You have to understand that true Philadelphia buttercake, bought on the boulevard in the northeast section of Philly, is gooey and very sweet-you should try it with a can or pie filling cherries on it-almost as good as the bakery version!

While this is very good, I cannot give it 5 stars because it is quite different than authentic butter cake from Philadelphia.  The true thing has a much thinner crust and a much gooey-er top layer.  You should have to eat it with a spoon.

This recipe was good.  I increased the butter in the crust to 1 stick and added a cup of chopped walnuts.  The crust was more moist and the nuts added a great flavor!

I have made this twice for my family and they couldn't stop raving about it!  It's so easy to make too.  I found it easiest to mix the cake mix, butter and egg by hand (sort of messy) or with a spoon because the mixture gets stuck in the beaters of the electric mixer.  Other than that this is a quick and easy recipe even for the novice baker!

I am a Chef of 18+ years in Philadelphia and this recipe is simple and darn close to the original.  If you think it is going to be like a cheese cake, you're wrong.  This is more of a pastry.  It is very sweet, so if you're diabetic, be very careful.  This a a true Philly dessert.  The cake mix does not "pour" like others may think.  It is a crust base and must be formed into the pan.  If you have any experience making cakes or pies, you should be OK with this.  It is very easy to make if you know what you're doing.

I searched for and made this recipe at a co-worker's request. I didn't even know what butter cake was. My entire company loved it and now I make it at least 6 times a year for them!

This is another version of what's called a "gooey butter cake" in St. Louis.  It's delicious.  The bottom should be a dough - like cookie dough - and have to be pressed into the pan.  The topping should pour easily onto the bottom and it is DELICIOUS.  You can use different kinds of cake mix, though I reccomend not using the ones with pudding in the mix - just a cheap plain one works best.

While not the fanciest looking dessert, this is a Southern staple and you can usually find them at family gatherings and potlucks if you're lucky.  The first layer is supposed to be pressed into the pan, with a raised edge.  Siblings have been known to fight over the corners.  The gooey topping is supposed to be creamy, rich and very sweet.  Not recommended to those without a sweet tooth.

I had a certain dessert in mind when I found this recipe, but had no idea what it was called.  This turned out to be exactly what I was looking for!  I wound up making several at Christmas last year, including one that I marbled red and green food coloring through.  Very yummy!

I have had this same recipe for years and it an absolute favorite  among family and friends .   It's origin is in Philadelphia, hence the title .  I get requests for it at family parties for the family who lives in Northern NJ and do not have access to butter cake near their home .  It is so sweet and delicious .

This is an amazing "cake", I've made it many times and always comes out great. Be careful not to overbake it as it will get hard on you quick, and this stuff is heaven when its soft and gooey. I have one question though, does anyone have any tips on how I might make one of these cakes in such a way that it doesnt sink in the middle and rise up along the edges of the pan? I want a more uniform cake. Thanks!

I don't know if it turned out like it was supposed to or looks like it was supposed to, but it tasted great! the cream cheese mixture marbled through and was this dense richness through out...we didn't frost it or anything - it is perfect as is!

Good after it was chilled.  I was a little confused that I was unable to pour the crust as the instructions stated.  This is a very rich dessert!

This is not what I expected, and it certainly didnt taste like cheescake.  The cake mix is very crumby and rather than pour it in the bottom, it has to be pressed. It is quite tasty and very, very sweet.  If you fool around with the recipe a bit, i'm sure it could be a very good dessert.

Granted, you do need to spread the cake layer on the bottom. However, I think that this cake was wonderful.
I have tried many butter cakes out there, and this one was the best. Out of the many things that I make, this
is, by far, my husband's favorite of them all. It always gets rave reviews.

I've never heard of Philadelphia Butter Cake until I moved to Delaware and went to a little bakery in Milford, DE called Dolce's. I fell in love with it. I figured I'd give it a try and search for recipes and this was the only one that sounded worth trying and ooooh boy am I happy I did! I takes exactly like the one I feel in love with! Super gooey, buttery, and overall AMAZING! The first batter with the cake mix, egg, and butter was VERY thick and I thought I did something wrong, but went for it anyway. I spread it over a cookie sheet as thin as I could. It was pretty thick, so a little hard to spread.

 

When I poured the second batter over the first, I tried to push it into the bottom batter but not completely mix the two, just enough to cover it. Both mixes did not spread all the way across the cookie sheet, but pretty close to it. I put it in 350 for 30 minutes and it was perfectly brown and the cake spread out. Let it cool down a bit before you dive in as it is very gooey and will burn the dickens out of you.


Other than that.... seriously.... It couldn't have been better!!!

i was a bit confused making the first step because the cake mix w/ egg is not pourable. it makes a solid dough that i pushed in the bottom of the pan.

delish !  great flavor, creamy but holds its shape. i cooked on convection @ 325 degrees, took out of oven 5 minutes early, & rotated it in oven after 20 minutes. i also left it in the oven with the oven door fully  open for 5 minutes to cool a bit -this prevented the center from sinking. worked perfect.

I have made this quite a few times.  My daughter does the mixing for me (my hands don't work well) and we love it both warm and cold.  Tiny pieces are the best though as it is very sweet!

They weren't kidding when they said it is sweet and rich!! The recipe says pour cake mix into pan. It is too solid, so you need to press it into pan. Tastes like a vanilla version of lemon bars.

AMAZING!!!! Delicious and perfect! I added 2-3 cups (which was a little less than half the bag of confectioners sugar, and I was actually able to POUR the top layer on. I cooked for 40 minutes and they turned out perfect! Had this only once before but this one I made was ever better! ;) Here's how mine looked...

Best cake ever!! Nothing but rave reviews by all who were lucky enough to get a slice.Even though it says to pour cake batter,you need to press it into pan,if you can pour it,then it is too thin.the top should be brown and a bit crispy,and of course,gooey! Delish!!

This recipe is so good but directions are lacking. The first part cannot be poured in pan, as it's too stiff. Just drop batter in pan and spread out to cover cake pan. The remainder works correctly and bakes up Perfect!

The cake turned out very good. Next time I am going to cut back the powder sugar from 1 bag to a half of a bag.

I didn't know if I followed the recipe correctly because it said to pour the cake mixture into a pan and it was not liquid. I had to press it into the pan.  It was VERY sweet and just ok.  I don't plan to make it again.
