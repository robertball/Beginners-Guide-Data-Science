This is not what you're looking for if you want sweet, cake-like cornbread.  However, it's got a delicious butter-milky flavor and tastes amazing with jam.  I like it because I sometimes find sweet cornbreads a little overwhelming, especially with honey and like toppings, and this is a more neutral side.  If you're tired sweet cornbread or just want something different for a change, try this one.

I really liked the texture. Not crumbly, not cakey, not really bready either. Easy for someone with bad teeth to chew.

Next time I will add a little more salt (I'm usually a low-salt person, but...), and may try it with some frozen corn kernels. It could use a little more corn flavor, but I like it.

Made this three times. This is the best recipe for a cornbread without the sugar and honey. Semolina is essential especially if using a coarser corn meal or polenta that I put briefly through food processor. Full fat buttermilk is great as well as plain full fat yogurt. I used a 12" cast iron skillet and doubled the recipe-came out great as did the standard recipe . This cornbread is as good as it gets.

This is great cornbread, but please keep in mind....very different from the cake-like, sweet American cornbread.  Also, in the Balkans, cornbread is eaten with feta cheese usually; it's even included in the batter sometimes, but that is a bit of a different recipe.  Also, sour cream and feta is very nice with this as would be any strong flavored cheese.  Try it that way and you will enjoy it more if you feel it is bland.

Smack your granny good! The only change I made was in the cooking technique. Skip the 8X8 pan with cornmeal. Instead, put a thin layer of oil in a cast iron skillet and place it in the oven as you preheat. After the oven is hot, carefully pour the batter into the heated oily pan. It will sizzle and put a nice crispy crust on the bread. This was gobbled up by this southern family.

This is a very different corn bread as other reviewers mentioned. It has a tender and slightly spongy/eggy texture and a distinct buttermilk flavor. There was really nothing wrong with this. I just think it is a regional or acquired taste. Thanks for sharing.

This was not to my taste. It was very bland and didn't really taste like corn at all. My very un-picky husband didn't like it either.I read the first review and was really looking forward to eating this with dinner tonight.

We really liked this cornbread!  It’s not your typical taste or texture of traditional cornbread.   It’s a finer texture and lighter taste.   I had Semolina flour and really wanted to use it and this was an excellent recipe.
