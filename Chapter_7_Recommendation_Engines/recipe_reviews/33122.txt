Orange flavor is lost. used 1/2 c juice, and increased flour to maintain consistency. Could deal without pineapple chunks, so would recommend crushed if you must have pineapple flavor. Made a pineapple juice "syrup" as others suggested so as not to waste (though drinking is tasty too). This helped, but again, would rather not have a chunk//chopped fruit pancake. otherwise, it's a fluffy buttermilk pancake.

These pancakes are tasty. I used crushed pineapple and I did add vanilla. Next time I would also add ginger. Most flavored pancake recipes do call for vanilla and cinnamon--an extract and a spice (of some sort) are pretty standard in flavored pancakes, and I don't know why they were omitted here, so I'd add them back in. The orange juice was lost in this recipe, and I did want to taste it, so next time I'd probably add orange zest or extract. Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed these!

My kids liked these.  I used crushed pinapple, which worked really well, and made the pancakes easier for the kids to cut and eat.

these were very good...light and fluffy just how pancakes should be.  I used pineapple chunks rather than slices....be sure to drain them well!  Next time I will experiment by adding a touch of ginger to the batter to give it more of a "tropical" taste.  Overall, very very good!!!

This was good, though you could stand to ditch the sugar (pineapple and OJ provides enough on their own), and to really compliment the pineapple, it would be better with a healthy dose of grated orange rind added to the batter.  I make stramberry-lemon pancakes regularly and use essentially the same recipe, but the rind is very important.

Good, but make sure to drain pineapple.  The first time I did, the second time I didn't (thinking "Ooh, mixing orange juice and pineapple juice will be good) and it threw off the consistency, making them burn and stick to the pan.

These weren't bad.  I didn't have buttermilk but had 1/2 c half and half to use up, so I used that with some regular skim milk and added just under 1 tbsp of vinegar to accommodate.  I used crushed pineapple and think next time I would not drain so carefully as the batter was a little thick.

My kids and I really enjoyed these pancakes! I think they are my new favorites, they have such a nice soft texture and the flavor is perfect.  My only change was to use a can of drained crushed pineapple instead of chunks. I will make these often :)

I was really expecting to taste some orange flavor, but there was nothing.  Next time I will add some orange zest or extract.  I also added some cinnamon, ginger and a pinch of nutmeg for some added flavor.  This recipe is a good start.

I gave this five stars because although I didn't make just like the recipe it helped me make what I was looking for. I wanted a pinacolada like pancake. So I used crushed pineapple and left the juice in. I also added 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut to the mix. I left out the oj and added only enough buttermilk to make it the right consistency. I cooked them at 250 degrees on the griddle. They took 7 minutes on the first side and 5 minutes on the second side. Only I'm not sure my griddle heats to the right temp. Any way my children loved them. Thank you for the help

My boyfriend thinks they're alright. I love them. I threw pecans in the batter and topped the finished product with more pineapple.

The orange flavor is lost - these are strictly pineapple pancakes.  After the first batch, I added a tsp of orange yest, 1/4 tsp of orange extract, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, but that didn't help much.  NOTE: I used (drained) crushed pineapple per other reviews, and I think that worked well.  Also, make sure you cook these on MEDIUM HEAT.  Don't crank up the griddle like with normal pancakes or you'll blacken them, like I did with my first batch.  The rest I cooked just under medium heat and got the lovely caramel-color they should be, with just a tinge of orange.  Very pretty.  Bottom line, these were just okay for us.  An interesting change, but I won't be making them again.

These were pretty good. The batter came out too thick as written, so I needed to add more liquid. I wish I had had orange juice in the house so I could have tried the original version, but I only had pineapple juice. I think the orange would have added some more tanginess to them.

Outstanding pancakes!  I used drained crushed pineapple and added a handful of shredded coconut.  Adding zested orange peel enhances the orange flavor.  These were a perfect tropical treat for our brunch.

These were alright, even after adding a touch of ginger and vanilla. My husband and I weren't huge fans, the pineapple chunks were too big which probably didn't help.

These pancakes were a different texture and taste at our table, I will make them again...I used crushed pineapple, drained...instead chopped. I rated it a 4, this time...because of my error...make sure that they are brown enough, because of the crushed pineapple, when I went to serve them, they were not quite done in the center.

My daughter made these and loved them! She cut back on the buttermilk to half a cup, skipped the OJ and used a quarter cup of the pineapple juice. Next time she plans on using crushed pineapple instead of the slices. Miss Tyler thanks you Chann!!

These were pretty yummy! I made a pineapple syrup with the rest of the drained juice and added close to double the sugar of the juice, boiled it for about 5 mins. It was pretty sweet after awhile but the pancakes were pretty good. I also added coconut to some of them. MMMM.

A nice change from regular pancakes. Next time I will double the amount of orange juice though. If using crushed pineapple, I would double that as well.

I used thawed, frozen pineapple chunks (ran them through the food processor to crush them) & I used pineapple juice instead of orange. I also made a syrup out of pineapple juice but I sweetened it w/ honey & reduced it until it was really thick & syrupy (took about 20 minutes so allow time). Garnished the pancakes w/ flaked coconut, the pineapple syrup, whipped cream & a cherry. My grandson loved these...thanks!

07.12.17 ~ A yummy pancake to add to our breakfast rotation.  My one change was to use crushed and drained pineapple rather than chopped slices.  I was surprised how light and fluffy this pancake turned out.  The orange flavor doesn't shine through but the pineapple does.  I made two types of pancakes to freeze for a quick breakfast.  We just reheat in the microwave or toast them to have a hot breakfast on mornings I don't feel like cooking.

I'm a huge fan of pineapple, and although I had high hopes for this recipe, the pineapple wasn't detectable.  The pancake part was fine.  I think I would remake this recipe without mixing in the pineapple and instead top a stack of the pancakes with a fresh pineapple-tangerine compote.

I thought the batter needed something more like vanilla. halfway through cooking i added some to batter. the kids eating them said this improved the taste..they were good pancakes. I liked the idea of pancakes with fruit other than  blueberries
