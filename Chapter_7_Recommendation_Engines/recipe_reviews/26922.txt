I made these Friday night to bring to my neighbor/friends candle party.  I sorta snuck in with them & set them on the table & all night I kept hearing "who made these mushrooms, they're really good" and were asking for the recipe.  I tasted a few before leaving (for dinner) and thought that they were pretty good, I didn't read the reviews before making them, but I agree with DREGINEK to skip the oil & mix the garlic in with the cream cheese mixture.  While they were baking, they did get kinda "runny", but they were okay as they cooled.  I got lucky & found 2.5 lbs. mushrooms with huge caps at Costco so I didn't have left over filling.  Thanks Chris!

I should have submitted a picture.  This is a great recipe and easy to make.  I change it around a bit.  Instead of sauteeing the mushroom cap, I sauteed the stem pieces, along with green onions and added fresh chopped basil and parsley.  Let it cool and added it to the cheese mixture.  I added several pads of herb butter to the baking dish right before putting it in the oven.  I made it the night before my dinner party, stored in the fridge.

Good mushrooms but as others have mentioned, either double the mushrooms or reduce the filling by half so that you don't have extra leftover.  Also, instead of sauting the mushrooms in oil, garlic and green onions, I added the garlic and green onion (omitted the oil) into the cream cheese mix. These are nothing like I have ever had before and I would make again.

I've made these mushrooms several times and they are always well-received.  Personally, I like the more traditional "bready" filling so I usually add some fresh bread crumbs (1/2 C. - 1C.) from the food processor.  Other than that I don't change a thing.  There is not too much filling if you use stuffing mushrooms.  This has become the appetizer that people request from me.

This was a very good recipe once a couple of adjustments were made. Instead of 12 mushrooms I used 15, only 6 oz of cream cheese instead of 8 oz(otherwise you would have a lot of extra stuffing),and added 1/4 to 1/2 cup of seasoned bread crumbs.

This recipe was interesting to say the least. Not the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had, but certainly quite good. This recipe probably does need breadcrumbs - something to give it a little more texture. As well, it could probably use more spiciness. Also, the recipe should really specify that you need very large mushrooms, or double the number of caps. I'm still searching for the best stuffed mushrooms, but this is certainly no slouch.

These were really good.  I didn't read the reviews before making and ended up with a ton of leftover stuffing.  But that was ok....I have never made stuffed mushrooms before, and will make again.  Thanks

These mushrooms were sooo good, they went very fast.  I could have filled antoher 6 mushrooms with the extra filling.  Instead of wasting the extra filling I served it as dip with pretzles yum, yum..  I also added 2 more dashes of hot sauce for a little extra kick.

This was one of the easiest and quick stuffed mushroom recipes that I have used.  I served it at a party
and everyone complimented the recipe!  You know its good, when you run out early!!  The only problem that
I encountered was the measurements on the ingredients when I increased the number of mushrooms to be 
stuffed.  I ended up with too much "stuffing" and not enough mushroom caps.

Overall, this is a keeper and I will use it as one of the mainstays when entertaining.

Excellent!  I even messed up part of the recipe and they were still great.  (I cooked the chopped stems in the garlic and oil, rather than the caps.)  All of my guests raved about them.  I will definitely serve these again.

Can't tell you how many times I've made stuffed mushrooms, but this was truly the best tasting recipe I've ever come across. My cooking method was a little different in that I never saute my caps but I do and always saute the filling. Once the stems were cooked thru, I then added the rest of the ingredients. I used a whipped cream cheese which melted down nicely and instead of the port, I added Marsala wine. Garlic and onion powders were also added in. I made thirty of these and my company devoured them in no time. Thanks Chris; it's a keeper!!

These were pretty good, but I feel like they needed something.  I added
a little worcestershire sauce.  I sauteed the the mushroom stems with the onion
and garlic, and brushed the caps with some melted butter.  I think a good 
addition to these would be to add some chopped, toasted walnuts to the filling,
for some texture.  I will probably make these again, adding a little more flavor
to them.

These were really easy and tasted delicious, but one thing I would suggest is buying the biggest mushrooms you can find because they do shrink when you cook them and there is a lot of extra filling.

Nice touch to our valentines meal. Excellent. We cut the wine in half and used Merlot, used Mozzarella cheese and added 1 tbls of Italian bread crumbs. I PILED the filling on and thought it might melt out but it didn't. Paired this up with "Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze" from this site, and served it with the steak rather than as an appetizer. Totally awesome.

Nice flavours! I used mozerella cheese instead of cheddar (healthier and adds to that "Italian" feel), and stuff large mushrooms (4 or 5 inches diameter cap) which worked well. The filling was slightly runny, so would use bread crumbs like others have suggested. Also, I didn't pre-cook the mushroom caps - I simply let them bake in the oven and they cooked nicely.

Quick, simple and a big hit.  Almost all of my guests asked for a copy of the receipe to take home.  As other reviewers stated buy big mushrooms or roughly double the number of caps or you will have left over stuffing.

I just love this recipe! 

You can play with the spices and use different kinds of cheeses. I liked the variation with crushed garlic instead of minced. If you end up with too much liquid from the mushroom, add a bit of seasoned bread crumbs.

A friend of mine made these for our girls' night- DELICIOUS!!  Her only substitution was to use red wine vinegar in place of the port.  She stuffed the caps pretty full so extra stuffing wasn't a big issue(although this dish was a little messy!) I will definitely be making this myself!!

This was a big hit on Christmas Eve! I added in chicken sausage (2 links) and used cabernet instead of port and it was fantastic! Also, I used 19 mushrooms and cooked it in a muffin pan to separate them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a party and doubled the recipe.  24 stuffed mushrooms went so fast, I had to make sure and grab the last one so I could even try one!  There was a lot of stuffing left over, but I used that in a soup the next day.  I'm sure all you cooks that know how to improvise can figure out something to do with the leftover mushroom mixture.  I wish I had taken a photo of my tray but they went too fast - definite crowd pleaser!

This recipe was super easy to make & everyone just loved the mushrooms! I too, had leftover filling, which was not a big deal. I just put the leftover filling in the fridge and the next day I restuffed some more mushrooms for my husband & me. We also tried dipping some tortilla chips in the leftover filling & it was DELICIOUS!  I sauteed the stems with the oil mixture & then added it to the cream cheese mix & then stuffed the mushrooms. I also put bread crumbs & grated cheddar cheese on top of the mushrooms half way through cooking them so they had a delicious crusty top!! I'm definitely making this again!

I made these for the first night my parents were over for dinner after I moved in with the boyfriend.  Glad it made a good impression!  They've been begging for more ever since!  Much better if cream cheese is at room temp and I found that it makes a lot more mix than what you need...  Easy correction?  Make more mushrooms! Yum!

Great!  Added some bread crumbs to enhance the texture of the filling and prevent 'runover' by just sprinkling them over the top.  Also used a porcini mushroom balsamic viniagrette to coat the bottom of my baking dish and drizzled over the top.  Did 1 and 1/2 large containers of white button mushrooms from WalMart and could've sone 2 but ran out of room in the pan.  They were the first thing gone on Christmas Eve with requests for more!!!  Also, omitted the garlic (hubby hates it) and didn't saute the tops, just the stems with onion, then baked in a glass 9 x 13-turned out great!

Good appetizer, everyone enjoyed. I used mozzarella cheese & substituted finely diced roasted red peppers for the green onions. It made a nice sweet contrast with the garlic.

Most people said they got excess filling which is true, I couldn't fit all of it in 12 mushrooms... I'd say I made about 24 mushrooms.  The recipe was good, I followed it exactly except i didnt put the hot sauce in it.  The only thing I would change the next time I make it (and I will make it again) is I wont add so much of the wine, there was too much of the alcohol flavor when I ate them... Otherwise it filled my house with the best aroma. Lovely!

I took this recipe and made it my own and I'm really happy wiht it. I added bacon to it and some shallot b/c I had some hanging around. I also used portabello mushrooms and put spinach on a couple of them under the filling.  I would cut back the amount of port slightly next time. I also used marscapone cheese b/c I had some. REally good stuff.

I get where she was going with the filling but like other users--I realized there were tweaks necessary to the recipe.  First off when doing a totally binder free mushroom you need THE BIG CAPS. The ones usually found in Restaurant supply or Club stores. Skip the cheddar and go with another Italian cheese (mozz. or better Fontina).

These mushrooms went so fast! They were a little time consuming to make and I ended up having more mixture than mushrooms (though I used small button ones instead of big ones) but that's not a problem b/c I can just use more 'shrooms this time.

I did, however, use italian-style bread crumbs in addition to the other stuff to make the mixture more substantial. So. very. tasty!

I thought they were rather bland myself yet others thought they were the best thing since sliced bread. It could be my taste is off from the new meds so I am still giving it 5 stars as the ease of making these and the fact I did like them just thought there would be a stronger flavor. (Like I said, may just be my meds.)

Just made these as a main dish for dinner tonight--Yummm!  Followed a couple of suggestions--added breadcrumbs (which added a texture I liked), and didn't saute the mushrooms before putting them in the oven. I also dipped the mushroom tops in olive oil on the outside to keep them from drying out in the oven. The garlic flavor ended up being a bit strong, so I think next time I'll follow another suggestion and saute the stems with the garlic and green onions.

Better the second day! These mushrooms were easy to make, but not a big hit at the party, so there were quite a few left over. They were very bland with not much flovor. We heated them up the next day and they were much better!! Next time I will make them the day before and just heat them before serving.

Loved it.  I used this as one of my vegetarian appetizers as my baby shower last week.  It went over well and I will be making more for the upcoming Holidays. Thanks.  (there was stuffing left over so buy extra mushrooms)

This was a fantastic stuffed mushroom recipe! I used sriacha as the hot sauce, and baby bellas for the shrooms. I think that I have a permanent mushroom recipe! I will say that there was way more stuffing than mushrooms, so next time I will double the mushrooms for the same amount of filling.

These were really, really good.  I was baking chicken at 425 degrees in the oven so I stuck these in there for just about 10 minutes instead of 20-25.  When I took them out the mushrooms were kind of shriveled and dark, but still looked appealing.  I wasn't sure if I'd totally messed them up, but they still tasted awesome!  My boyfriend, who was not expecting to like them, totally loved them.  I will definitely be making this again.

Made this for fathers day.  Even though I didn't use the full recipe (5-6ox of the cream cheese) it still made a huge portion, and it filled 22 largeish mushrooms.  I added chopped almonds and Trader Joes chili lime cashews (small handful) for the crunch and additional kick.  Went over well. Would make again.

I'm not a fan of bread crumb filling so this was right up my alley.  Used the suggestion of adding walnuts and what a great addition it was.  Didn't add the wine and glad I didn't because I think it would be a very dominating flavor whereas I prefer the taste of cheesy garlic.  Not a lot of effort had to go into this which was great too, thanks for the keeper Chris!

These were GREAT! I made them at Christmas, and they were a huge hit.  I did add some garlic and bread crumbs for body-- delish!  Next time I would not bother to buy the large "stuffing mushrooms"-- the smaller ones were better.  The filling does make about 2x what is needed, so double your mushrooms.  Everyone loved these!

I didn't read the reviews before trying the recipe, but used giant portabella mushroom caps (didn't have any leftover and actually added a bit more cheese to make it spread).  If you broil them for the last minute (and sprinkle with fresh parmesan), it gives them a really nice color and look for parties.

A-m-a-z-i-n-g!  Make sure to add a more tart white wine to the filling.  I use River Gold by Wollersheim Winery, it's soooo good instead of port wine in there.  A great dish to eat as a meal!

Great recipe. I made these according to the original recipe and then tried them 95% vegan with Dayia cheddar cheese and Tofutti "Better Than Cream Cheese" cream cheese (still used the parm), to cut down on the saturated fat and calories. I wasn't sure what that was going to do to the taste, but the mostly vegan version turned out even better in my opinion, and my family agreed. A couple comments and tips - use a food processer to chop the stems, otherwise it takes forever! Make sure you pick mushrooms with very large heads or you will have a lot of stuffing left over (or use the extra with a baked potato). Baked mushrooms were quite runny as others said. Also, I didn't add the hot sauce, and they still turned out great. If these are for a party, serve with fancy toothpicks, makes for an impressive presentation.

I've made these lots of times now and they are always well-received!  I skip precooking the mushroom caps and they turn out just fine.  I've found that a suitable substitute if you don't like port is 1 tbsp of good balsamic or red wine vinegar to give it a similar tang (I prefer the port though!).  These are great for year round entertaining--thanks!

We loved these!  I served them a few nights ago as an appetizer to two other couples, "foodie" friends of ours that with whom we often travel to Europe.
I utilized all the same ingredients. The only difference was in my prep, I sautéed the mushrooms because it reduces the liquid in them and the don't run all over the pan when their in the oven, removed the mushrooms and quickly sautéed the minced garlic then added the garlic and the raw green onions to my stuffing mix and proceeded from there as in the original recipe.
They were a hit.  I used stuffing caps so there really was no left over stuffing.   Next time I'm going to omit the port wine, add a TBS "Wooster" (for seafood) Sauce and a 1/2 cup of lobster meat.

Best stuffed mushrooms I've made, but with a few tweaks. I skipped the garlic and just used a tablespoon of garlic powder in the mixture. Instead of green onions I used regular onions. I replaced the port wine with white zin. Lastly, I used about a tablespoon of Italian seasoned dried bread crumbs instead of just plain Italian seasoning.

I have make this recipe several times and they are always a hit. I find them farely easy to make. They are a nice addition to the meal as an appetizer or along with the entree.

Another excellent stuffed mushroom recipe! I made a few changes because I didn't have all the necessary ingredients around...I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, skipped the port wine and hot sauce, and cut back on the Parmesan cheese (I only had about 2 tbs.) I also found that this recipe stuffed more like 20 mushrooms; I guess mine were a bit small or something. The taste was excellent, though. They were really rich and decadent tasting...but they really weren't all that bad for you, with the Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese...my family (or at least those in my family who like stuffed mushrooms) really enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll be making these again!

These were delicious! Every month, we have a vegetarian potluck and I decided to make these. Words can't even describe how good these were! We ate so much that we didnt save room for anything else and got a stomach ache. haha

After reading others' reviews, I used half the recommended cream cheese and left out the oil. I then added half a cup of bread crumbs and followed all other directions. These were good; I wouldn't hesitate to make them again, but they didn't 'excite' me. My husband said they were a little bland.

Not incredible but not bad either. I made some changes. Added chives, chopped walnuts, halved the cream cheese, did a few extra mushrooms. I can't imagine these without the walnuts. That part was good. They were rather rich. And even though I reduced the cheese and added extra mushroom, we still had extra filling.

Tasted great, but I've had better.  Possibly because I cooked them on the grill but I doubt it.  They cooked pretty evenly on the top rack around 350 to 400 degrees

My Sister-in-law and I were looking for a creamcheese stuffed mushroom and found this one. We loved it!! it does make a little more filling than 12 mushrooms can hold. I did not do the pre-bake saute, and it still turned out wonderful. the leftover filling is great on bread or bagel!!

These are delicious!  I agree do NOT cook in the olive oil first.  I simply put all the ingrdients in a hot skillet and the mushrooms create their own juice.  I use sharp cheddar cheese because it is one of my favorites and it adds to the "bite" of the filling.

Some I made with the sauteed caps, some I skipped that step - the ones I skipped wee definitely squishier. I baked the for the amount of time specified and it might just be my oven, but the stuffing was just barely done. They were very good, will make again, I'll just probably bake them a little longer.

This was very good--a nice change from the usual sausage stuffed mushrooms. Next time I will increase the onions to 1/4 cp and sprinkle the tops with paprika. Might even try adding 2 cps spinach. Definitely a keeper.

This dish was very well received by my MEAT ONLY eating father and family.  I am a vegetarian and was looking to make something for everyone to enjoy.  I used 8 Stuffer mushrooms and halved the ingredients of the stuffing, which turned out the perfect amount.  I topped each mushroom with a light sprinke of bread crumbs and parmasean (with a sprig of green onion) for a crusty and colourful topping.  This really finished it off. 

Excellent recipie, thanks!

Added a cup of seasoned bread crumbs and chopped green onions to the stuffing.  Removed a little of the cream cheese as well.  These came out very well.

This was very flavorful and I'm so glad I read the reviews first!!  Thanks to all who told me there would be a lot of stuffing leftover.  I used the extra to go inside my salmon puff pastry entree.  It was incredibly good and the flavor was completely different than with the mushrooms.  No stuffing was wasted.

Very good. Didn't have port wine on hand (and don't like it anyway) so I substituted a little Worchestershire sauce instead. Turned out well.

I LOVE this recipe.  Every time I make it for guests, they rave about it.  I don't use the port wine (never have it in the house) and I use small mushrooms to stuff.

This is a great recipe and was well-recieved for our bar-b-que lastnight. I prepared as directed save for adding more parmasean so we wouldn't have it hanging around in the refrigerator. As a result, the finished appetizer was slightly salty, but still excellent. I also used pepper jack cheese rather than cheddar due to a glut of pepper jack.

Made this last nite and was delicious.  As others mentioned a lot extra filling but my wife asked me to make them again tonite.  Saute was done in butter, garlic and vidalia onions.  Had I mixed this into the cheese filling, I think would have been too much.  You do get some of the garlic/onion/butter flavor from the saute.  

My wife is not a fan of hot sauce and the consistency can use some help.  Instead of the port wine, I used about the same amount of soy sauce.  Next time I may add a little breadcrumbs to help 'hold together' and a maybe little pineapple for extra sweetness.   

So many more possibilities I am looking forward to trying with this easy recipe.

It was super easy to make except as other mentioned about the oil, I had trouble with that step also. The oil dried out very quickly, it was also the last of my olive oil so I subbed a tbsp of butter, it worked wonderfully. Also I had to double my mushrooms since I had so much extra filling. Other than that great!

I made these for a party and everyone loved them.  The wine gives them a good flavor.  Sometimes I'll add some breadcrumbs to give the filling a little more bulk.

These were delicious, but they were very high-calorie for just an appetizer.  To make them lower-cal, I used light whipped cream cheese (and less than what the recipe called for) and skipped on the cheddar cheese. Very good!

It was good. Needed a bit more flavor. Parmesan cheese isn't vegetarian, so omitted completely. Would make again with more mushrooms.

Delicous! It was my first time making stuffed mushrooms. I took others advice and used 15 mushrooms, 6oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. I didn't saute anything which made it very simple. Will definitely make again!

Maybe I did something wrong but I found the texture too pasty. I guess I didn't go for the cream cheese against the mushrooms. It needed more contrast.

I found this recipe to be rather bland...if might be better if you omitted some of the cream cheese.  It was definitely lacking in flavor.  Possibly adding some more texture or ingredients might help such as bread crumbs.

Like others said, didn't brown the garlic and onion, just mixed them into the cream cheese. We ate this for dinner tonight, and probably will repeat next week. :)

Wondeful appetizer!  I have made these for a few events and everyone loves them.  Great to take when you don't know everyone in the group and if they eat meat!

The stuffed mushrooms were really good... my sister LOVED them.  Even though I did like them, i felt that there was somethign missing.  Something crunchy def would have added something. I'm still trying to figure out what would do it though..

These mushrooms were okay. I will definately not use as much wine next time. I tasted wine more than any other ingredient. There was a lot of stuffing left over as well. Next time I make them I will either half the recipe or use larger portabello caps.

Incredibly good! We made this into a meal by using 4 larger portobellos. And if you're not a vegetarian, try adding bacon bits, it's even better! Port wine gives the dish a really nice flavour so I wouldn't omit it. If you don't have any, you can use any cooked wine instead (Muscat or even red vermouth).

These are delicious!  I was glad I read prior reviews and saw that I would need more than 12 mushrooms, I had about 25 and except for using balsamic vinegar instead of port (I forgot to buy it) I followed the recipe exactly and my guests gobbled them up in munites.  Thank you!

This recipe was a notch up from my standard stuffed mushrooms.  Excellent flavor.  I too would recommend adding 1/4 c of Italian seasoned bread crumbs for substance.  Also, if you have extra stuffing, put it in a small casserole dish and bake for 20 mins. for a preview of your appetizer.  Yum!

!! Ok, iF you like them that way... try THIS! Slice the shrimp straight down the middle. Put a small slice of MOZZARELLA CHEESE IN THE MIDDLE and then wrap the bacon around the shrimp tightly. Stick a toothpick in and grill up! Some of the cheese may melt out but be sure to wrap it tightly with the bacon.  Cheese makes everything taste better!!

This was an interesting recipe. The port gives it a unique flavor and it goes well with the mushroom flavor. I expected the mushrooms to lose a lot of water while baking and, happily, they did not. I will make these again.

I couldn't give this recipe the full five stars because I changed a few things, I sautéed my chopped stems in evoo with some salt and two garlic cloves just for a min or two and mixed them in with my cheeses and another two garlic cloves. I also didn't have enough cheddar so I used a 1/3 of a cup of shredded mozzarella. I'm not completely clear on what port wine is I think it's just a Portuguese wine but I didn't have any so I just used whatever red wine i had on hand. Stuffed the mixture into my raw stuffing caps and cooked them as directed. These were awesome!!! Will def make them again!

I disagree with those who suggest skip sautéing as this is what brings out the flavour... Also I followed the recipe (rather than cutting back by the filling by half as some suggest) and had just the right amount for the 12 large mushrooms I used.  I did add buttered breadcrumbs to the tops.

I did a Mexican-style play on this, adding a diced poblano to the stem/onion/garlic mixture, adding an avocado with the cream cheese, and omitted the wine and Italian seasoning. Turned out amazing, everyone loved them!

I made this recipe today for a Super Bowl snack.  I took the advice of some of the other cooks and made less filling and also about bread crumbs.  I sprinkled bread crumbs on right before I put them in the oven.  Will absolutely make again!!!

I've made this a few times because my guests all seem to like it, but I find it bland and probably won't make it again.  I added some Tabasco and used canned real crab (and did pre-cook the mushrooms a bit to reduce some of the liquid), but it mainly tasted bready to me and didn't have enough other flavors to be interesting.

These have good flavor but a little too much cream cheese for me.  Next time I might start with 4 oz of cream cheese and add more to the mix if it needs it.

This was really great - first time I've tried making stuffed mushrooms, and we'll definitely be having them again!  I used Stones Ginger Wine instead of port, and filled 5 portabello caps to make a meal out of it.  Found it just a little rich and a little salty (although I didn't add any salt) so will try a couple of tweaks next time.  Needs something crunchy too - perhaps serve it with thick slices of toasted homemade bread, or add croutons, or nuts.
