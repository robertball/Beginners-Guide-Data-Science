Caution:  do NOT make this unless you are ready to indulge in yumminess!  Fortunately for me I only made half a batch because otherwise, well, you know how that goes!  The author says to double the batch, and I would definitely agree with that only if you have other eaters!  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times in the past couple of months  and it's excellent every time.  I can't see where you could go wrong! I add salted peanuts but otherwise stick to recipe. I find it similar to "Crunch & Munch". Very addictive!!!!!

I should have cooked more popcorn to pour it over. I used our air popper. But it was delicious, it just disappeared too fast.
