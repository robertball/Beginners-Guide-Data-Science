This is a great recipe. I doctored it up a little bit, not much, but it was truly amazing. I used green chile olive oil, which gave it a bit of a kick, and used 12 oz carrots and 12 oz Brussels sprouts. I also spread whole rosemary stalks around the pan instead of chopping it. And instead of parsley I sprinkled chopped fresh chives and drizzled half of a lemon over everything. 450 degrees was a little high and a couple of the onions burned, but overall it was delish! I'll use 425 next time, I think. The sweetness of the apple really complemented the sausage and the veggies. My man loved it! It's definitely a keeper. I think the green chile oil made a big difference, and all the flavors really blended well. It's a nice recipe to experiment with as well, maybe adding potatoes and other root vegetables, and different oils and seasonings.

Made it tonight and both my boyfriend and I loved it. I added fingerling potato’s  and parsnips and cooked those at 425 for about 15 mins ahead of everything else to make sure they were done. I also doubled the rosemary, added 2 tsp of garlic salt, 2 tsp of herbs de providence and omitted the regular salt. Definitely a recipe to keep.

Excellent recipe, the only changes I made was to add sweet potato and instead of lemon juice, I drizzled honey over the top of the caramelized veggies.   I will absolutely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really hate it when people make many changes to a recipe then rate it.  Let me just say that  this recipe is a blueprint for any combination of vegetables and sausage.  :-)

Made it for the second time. With or without sausage worked fine. If you need to switch out one of the vegetables go ahead, it works out well. This recipe is a keeper.

This was great - and had the added benefit of having three of my six children claiming they loved Brussels sprouts. I made it as is and it does have a tendency to stick, so watch that. Otherwise, I give it my wholehearted endorsement.

This was very good. I used Chicken apple sausage, potatoes and yellow and red peppers in addition to the carrots, onions, and apples.
I loved the caramelization after the broiling.

It got too done under the broiler.  Next time I make it, I'll try putting everything in at the same time and don't broil.  I substituted potatoes for brussels sprouts since I didn't have any, and put the potatoes in the oven at 425 before adding everything else and bumping the temp up to 450.  Really tasty and easy.

Loved this. Based on blandness others commented on made a few adjustments. To oil rub mixture added 1 t. dried parsley and 1 t. garlic powder and after coating veggies in bowl sealed them in a quart baggie and put in fridge for a few hours turning a couple times. Did everything else exactly as recipe called for and even my picky husband loved it. Great recipe and very simple!

Basic sheet pan supper.  Great fall/ winter dish.  I tossed the vegetables in olive oil, some hot sauce and a tbsp of Maple Syrup to kick up the flavours a bit.

Just made this and it was a hit! Sooo easy! Added fresh green beans to the carrots and Brussel Sprouts. And doubled the sausage. Excellent! Others said the Broil at the end with the apple slices caused some burning, but we did not have that problem; however our oven has a LOW or HIGH Broil option and we used the LOW broil setting.

This was delicious and well worth making.  I added 1 sweet potatoe, a small bulb of fennel, zucchini and tossed at the end with a balsamic reduction.  Next time I will add parsnips as well.  I made a side of rice for the kids too.

I liked the ingredients in this recipe. It just looked so inviting, so I thought I'd give it a try. I used everything the recipe called for, except parsley, which I didn't have.  I used frozen brussells sprouts, baby carrots, red oninon &  apple.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe called for, and it tast.ed delicious!  The only thing I would cut back on is the olive oil. I think I would use just 2 tbls instead of 3.  So good and so healthy!

My husband is raving over it. I substituted asparagus for the Brussels sprouts. I’m thinking maybe next time will add some potato chunks to it as well. I used turkey smoked sausage .

Some might disagree, maybe because they don’t like sausage or because they hate Brussels sprouts, but this was a great, easy dinner. I didn’t have Brussels sprouts, so used Delicata squash instead. Paired with the apple, the squash and the hickory smoked chicken sausage were outstanding.

This is one of our go to favorites now. Easy to prepare, smells great, taste flavorful, & looks pretty on the table. I service it with flavored rice & crusty rolls. Quick & easy.

I've made this with Apples and without, both versions are still delicious, and I like how easy it is.

It was fantastic! I added a sweet potato because I love them. I ate the veggies off the cookie sheet as I was putting it into the sink!

Super good and easy.  I substituted potatoes and peppers for Brussel sprouts, and had so many veggies I didn't need the apple.  Added garlic along with it, and oh, so good and easy.

This was absolutely every bit as good as I had hoped it would be! The only thing I changed was the brand of sausage. I don't care for the manufactured taste of Hillshire Farms so I used a local artisan chicken sausage. I added a little time to the cooking by broiling it for 10 minutes, stirring it and broiling another 5 minutes. Fantastic recipe. Thank you

I have done this 2x . The changes to make this great were 425 for 45 minutes adding the sausage on the last 20  I also  removed rosemary and added 1 tablespoon maple syrup to all the veggie and the apple at the beginning no need to broil .

Adding the lemon at the end really makes the Brussels sprouts pop in this dish. I did take another reviewer's suggestion to reduce the cooking temperature to 425 in order to keep the veggies from burning and that worked well. Would definitely make again. Easy clean up on a weeknight.

This is delicious. My only advice would be to double it! Made it tonight exactly as written, actually now I realize I omitted the parsley... Regardless, it was delicious. Have got kids at home ranging from 10 months - 4 years, plus a neighbor over who was 10. All devoured it and asked for more. Quick, simple and good enough for company!

The recipe was easy to make and tasty. We used turkey sausage and it turned out with a nice crisp. The apples were a good addition; I might add more next time.

Incredible dish.  Love the combination of salt, sweet, hearty, healthy, veggie, fruit, and just all around goodness.  We doubled the amount of sausage and that made it perfect for us.  Will make over and over again.  I also think this would be good for a potluck if made the night before and reheated in a crockpot.

Surprised my wife with this dish for dinner tonight.  Added a few of those tiny potatoes halved (microwaved them for a few minutes first) and used chicken habanero sausage since she is not fond of smoked sausage or Italian sausage.  Other than that, followed recipe as written.  We really loved it!  i'll be making this again for sure.  So easy, but great flavor.  Enough left over to take to lunch tomorrow. Try it!

Made it exactly as written except there was no Hilshire Farms here so I used the locally available sausage. It as fabulous and my husband who doesn't eat vegetables said he could gorge on it. We had it two nights in a row since I had enough veggies.  Will be in our consistent rotation.

Used mild homemade chicken sausages. Quite a bit of flavour but not spicey. Maybe try hot spicey sausage next time.

Yummy healthy. Let’s face it you can add any root veggie to this. I added sweet potato and parsnips. Made 2 tray fulls on parchment (no clean up) and my daughter can add her vegetarian sausage to a pan for meals all next week!

This is a great recipe that you can easily customize to your preferences.  I have made it several times, once exactly as written, and I have also substituted the vegetables, including parsnips, yellow onions, baby carrots, and small red bliss potatoes in different batches because it was what I had on hand.  I find that  the broiler added too much color for my liking (my broiler runs hot), so I usually add the apple and cook for another ten minutes at 450.  Definitely keep an eye on it once you put it under the broiler.  
I like to substitute turkey rope kielbasa (I get mine at Aldi) for a lower calorie alternative.  This is an excellent recipe for meal prep as well.

What's not to love about a one sheet pan dinner! I forgot to buy a apple,so I added orange red and yellow mini peppers,and added 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic,and I used dried rosemary instead of fresh. I can see this dish is very versatile,you can add a variety of root vegetables or any kind for that matter. Next time,I'll add the apple as it is imperative to making this dish from good to incredible based on most of the reviews.

The perfect blend of fat, salt, heat, and acid for an autumn dinner. The drizzle of freshly squeezed lemon juice at the end makes all the difference. Delicious!

I've made this a couple of times, with only a couple of changes. First, I don't preheat the pan because I bake it about 10 minutes longer - I add in a bit of chopped potato. Also don't use the lemon because I never seem to have on on hand.

It was a great recipe.  I used my flavored olive oil. I’d use a lower heat next time as they cooked too fast and dark.  Flavor was still awesome!

Who knew apples and sausage taste so well together! Broccoli is a great addition as well.

My wife is in love with this dish.  We decreased the onions and increased the carrots and was perfect for our tastes.
