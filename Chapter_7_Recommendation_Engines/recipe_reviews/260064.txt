Recipe has good flavor and chicken came out perfect.   Rice could be cooked on stovetop while making chicken in the Instant Pot to possibly cut down time. Also a little more water may be needed since rice came out little dryer and harder than desired.  Sauce needs to be in sauté mode for longer than 10 mins and reduced down considerably to thicken.  Aside from some minor tweaks it is an excellent recipe.  I definitely will be making this again since it is my daughter and my favorite dish.

I really enjoyed this and tried to follow the recipe as close as possible. I accidentally bought coconut yogurt, I added cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick, and I didn't have turmeric. I also used faux-chicken instead of real chicken. It still turned out very well.

In future, I'll add a bit of extra water and time for cooking the rice as I found it was chewier than desired (and that's from me liking chewy rice). I will probably try paneer next instead of faux-chicken or just make without either. And perhaps make a double batch of the sauce to freeze some for later.

And I'll either wear gloves when chopping the peppers or ask my husband to chop them. :D

Although this recipe is a lot of work (compared to other dishes where one can put everything in the pot, close the lid, and forget about it), It was very flavourful and worth the effort. I look forward to making this again.

Flavor was very good, but sauce was way too watery and there was about a pint of it left over.

Absolutely delicious. I didn’t seed the peppers as that’s where the heat is, but it still didn’t come out spicy. The flavor was great. I didn’t have a cinnamon stick so I just tossed a dash of cinnamon in the pot.  Next time I will double the rice and use skinless chicken. I don’t like soggy skin and the marinade didn’t penetrate as well as it could have.

Very good, will make it again. Would make twice as many chicken pieces though. Lots of leftover gravy.

This is one our new favorites, worth the long prep. We cooked 2 cups of rice, so we can use ALL the sauce!
