Very nice bread.  I used oat groats instead of rolled oats.  I also didn't add the quarter cup of oats later.  This loaf rose sky-high in my machine.  It was light and fluffy, I wished I could eat more. Next time, I will add brown sugar to try to make a sweet breakfast loaf.

If I could give it double stars I would....this is the best bread machine recipe I have ever tasted....It's like a slightly sweet, really good wheat bread...Make it even if you don't like molasses because you cannot tell it's molasses.....Great!

This bread it fantastic and it rose beautifully!  I altered it a bit by adding only 2 TBLS of molasses (it was all I had left) and I used 1 TBLS brown sugar to help add more flavor due to my lack of molasses. Finally, I left out the last addition of oats. Despite all of my alterations, this made a beautiful loaf.  Also, I only made the dough in my machine and baked it in a regular loaf pan in the oven so its perfect for sandwiches.  Yum! Thanks McReynolds!

I wish that there were options for four and a half stars. I made this by hand with my Kitchen Aid mixer instead of a bread machine. which I don't have. The measurements were spot-on, this didn't need any extra flour to get it to jump on the hook. I kneaded it with the hook for five minutes, then set it to rise in a greased bowl on my warm oven. The took forever to rise and when I went to form the bread, it formed really easy it was just pissy dough to work with. It fell easily. 30 minutes in a 350* oven and it was good to go. Great flavor, quite chewy. I plan on serving it with Hearty Bacon and Ranch Potato Soup. I'd make this again.

Excellent!  I made this in the bread machine, dough cycle.  I then made 2 small loafs, let rise 1 hr., sliced the top and baked at 350 for 30 min or so (I live at high altitude, so don't trust my baking times)This is the best machine &/or traditional method bread I have made to date.

This bread came out better and more evenly shaped and cooked than most recipes for my bread machine. I was super happy with the moistness, the softness, and the color. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it has a slightly weird aftertaste. I did use half wheat flour though, so next time I will use only white and potentially give 5 stars. Thanks!

Really enjoyed this bread.  Made just as stated and the end result was a soft, slightly sweet delicious breakfast bread.  Worth a try in your bread machine!  :)  Tks for the recipe!

Somewhat dry and not especially unique. Baked and made in my bread machine.  I substituted milk for the powdered milk.  Be sure to use dark molasses for flavor and darker color - light molasses doesn't cut it.

Very Good Bread.  The only change I made was to use 3 cups whole wheat flour and 0.5 cups bread flour.

Very tasty!  I used whole wheat flour in place of the bread flour, and a squirt of honey instead of sugar.  I also made the dough into rolls and baked in the oven to serve with a soup I was making.  Awesome warm with butter.  Thank you for sharing!

So soft and moist!  I used brown sugar instead of white and added an extra teaspoon.  Fabulous taste and perfect texture.  Love it toasted with a small amount of butter.  Yum!

Just like my Mom's homemade porridge 
bread from "down east".  So good. Worked perfectly in my Sunbeam bread machine.

Very flavorful, though not dense at all.  My 7 year old professes to dislike molasses, but could not get enough of it!

I made a few minor changes: I left out the powdered milk and additional oats, replaced the water with warm milk (to give the bread a richer flavor, and keep the bread moist), and used 1.5 cups each of wheat and white flours. I also let the butter sit in the warm milk a bit to soften it up. This bread came out VERY moist, and a beautiful deep caramel color, but the flavor wasn't as unique as I expected it to be. Still yummy though!

Slightly reminiscent of the bread they serve at the Cheesecake Factory. I don't have a bread machine, so I just used my mixer and dough hook attachment. Shaped the dough into two round loaves and baked at 350* for 35 minutes on a baking sheet. It was a bit heavy, but it still vanished in no time!

Good bread, not sweet like shoe-fly pie which is what I was hoping for.  Works great in a bread machine.

I love the richness the molasses imparts.  I love brown breads, but don't often keep specialty flours around to make them.  That is why I liked this recipe so much.

I was out of bread flour so I used AP flour + 1 Tbsp. vital wheat glucose.  I also proofed the yeast before adding it in.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The result was tender and moist, but the flavor seemed a little off.  If I make this again I will substitute some whole wheat or rye flour.
