Wonderful snack that's so easy to make! I added a little bit of salt to the seasoning mix and brushed the pita wedges lightly with EVOO. Very crispy and delicous, especially served with "Extra Easy Hummus" from this site.

I took other reviewers suggestions and brushed the pitas with EVOO, then sprinkled it with the spices. I didn't have any issues with my pitas. I served these with Good For You Greek Salad. We liked them well enough. Next time, I might try this with greek seasoning and see if that might match up a little better. Great idea for those random packs of pitas that you find on the clearance bread racks and can be quite cheap.

I use a misto oil sprayer but a can of olive oil spray is a great substitute.  The seasoning choice I use is McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning.  It comes in spicy or regular and a mix of the two can lets you choose the level of heat.  A 400 degree oven is just right but watch them carefully after five minutes so they don`t burn.

Delicious!!!  I dipped mine in olive oil and then dipped again into the dry herb mixture.  Hubby & I both raved!  Next time I'll add some parm cheese into the mixture.

Terrific! I made a huge batch from 6 pita breads for so cheap! I did split the wedges after I cut them as I like them very crisp.  Sprinkled garlic powder and cajun spice after spraying just one side with the cooking spray.  These came out perfect and saved me a ton!!

These are absolutely perfect.  I brushed the breads with just a bit of evoo and then a good salting and some garlic powder and then sprinkled with just a pit of paprika.  Baked at 400 for about 9 1/2 minutes.  I hate buying those expensive pita chips and these were even better.  Buy the pitas at the day-old bread store and it's really a savings over the bagged store bought pita chips!

These were the perfect quick snack...we used whole wheat pita bread and olive oil spray.  Served with hummus.

Definitely an interesting way to spice up pita bread - we brushed a few teaspoons olive oil onto these before dusting them with spices so the seasoning would stick better.

Why didn't I think of this? I love Staceys pita chips, but they are a bit pricey. These are so easy and can be made with whatever seasonings/herbs you like. I've tried creole, parsley, black pepper, parmesan cheese, just pick your favorites and experiment. Thanks for a great recipe!

The whole family loved these -- from the 2 yr old to the 60 yr old.  SO simple yet so flavorful.  I was surprised the 2 yr old went for the spices but she dug in.  Crisp and spicy, a perfect dipper for hummus!  I also used whole wheat pitas and they were perfect.  Thank you for this healthy snack!

These were delicious. I did melt about 2 tablespoons of butter and mixed all the spices in that before coating the pita. My kids really liked this recipe. I will be using this as a snack for my kids since it went over so well.

These chips were great I took them to a party with dip and my firends just love them! Everytime I go out with them they always tell me to "make those awesome pita chips." They are very fast and easy to make.

I wasn't impressed.  They didn't bake evenly.  Parts of the chips were crisp and then parts were chewy.  I also didn't think the spices blended well with the pita bread.  The spices would be better for hash browns or something potato based.

These Pita chips were a snap to make and much better than the store bought ones. I made the 1st time exactly as the recipe stated, but the 2nd time, I made the directions even simpler. I sprayed the whole Pita bread with Pam on both sides then I sprinkled the herbs/spices without measuring or mixing them. Using kitchen scissors, I cut the Pita breads into 12 wedges and baked . I served with guacamole. But don't count on this amount to give you 16 servings !! It was just enough for 6 serving for us.

I really like these, but I had to bake 2x as long bc I had thicker pitas, and they kind of had a burnt taste.  Still, I think thats not the original recipe's fault, and I really liked them.  Thanks!

We used 100% whole wheat pita bread- very tasty. My toddlers didn't like it with the spices- but it left more for my husband and I. :) We dipped them in pasta sauce. A good healthy treat. Yum!

Wow, these were a great tasty and healthy snack! I had some pita that needed used up, so I thought I'd give these a try and I'm glad I did. I also sprinkled mine with fresh cracked ground pepper and sea salt. Very good...I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely delicious! To make things easier, I threw the pita chips in a large bowl in batches and drizzled olive oil over them a couple of times, then sprinkled the spice mixture over them. After all the chips were good and coated, I turned them out onto the pan and sprinkled just a smidge more of the spice mixture and baked. Easy and delicious.
