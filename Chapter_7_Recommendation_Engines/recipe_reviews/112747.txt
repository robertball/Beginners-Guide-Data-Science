One hour seemed too long to cook.  The sour cream did not "melt" as the directions implied it would.  Taste was okay.  Will not make again.

I found this recipe to be just "okay."  It was easy to follow and tasted alright, but my husband said it was awesome. :-)

I was happy to find a simple recipe to get the quail to the oven fast after my husband cleaned them. I added ground mustard and parsley just because I had them.  Turned out good and smelled so good my son didn't wait for them to find a plate before he pulled a leg off.  Sour cream didn't melt but no one seemed to care.  Will be making again for a church function soon.

I used poultry seasoning and fresh garlic.  The box the quails came in said to cook only 20 minutes at 400 degrees so I did that and it came out perfect.  Instead of water I poured some pinot grigio in the caserole dish before cooking.  The sour cream needs to be heated before putting on, maybe cooked on the defrost setting in the microwave, because it made the quail cold.  But otherwise the sour cream is the perfect compliment to the flavor of the quail meat!

Yeah it should go for 30-40 mins not an hour an hour made it dry. It's like chicken it dries out quickly
