The dough was difficult to work with.  The cookies did  taste good but they looked dreadful as they crumbled to bits trying to slice the logs.  This is probably due to chef error but I can't seem to find where I went off track.

I grew up enjoying these cookies with my great-grandmother. They're not your typical cookie, more spice than sugar, but still delicious.

Very close to my grandmothers recipe.  She used pecans instead of walnuts.
