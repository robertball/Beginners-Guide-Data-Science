Oh my, this was good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I used fresh garlic rather than the powder, and I left out the salt and other seasoning.  It seemed to have plenty of flavor.  Oh ya!  I also partially mashed the potatoes to make the soup a little thicker.  It's a winner!

Fast and easy. I added some garlic. I will adjust the salt next time a little too salty for me.

I found it very good.  Although, I did partially mash the potatoes when they were tender and this added to the thickness.  I also added a small amount of flour slurry to cream it up a bit.  All in all though....I found it very tasty.  Thanks for submitting it.

We love this soup. I make this at least once a month, more in the winter. If I'm in a hurry on weeknights, I use frozen southern style hasbrowns and they work great. I serve with cornbread and salad for a great meal.

We liked this very much.  I added a little cheddar cheese 'cuz for me potato soup just isn't the same without it.  Don't leave out the mustard, it really adds a nice flavor.

Great recipe!  The dijon mustard adds that hint of 'what is that secret ingredient?' to the dish.  No extra seasoning needed.

This is a good recipe. One thing it was missing is carrots. I will add them in next time. Also, I didn't care too much for the ham, I think next time I will saute smoked sausage in place of the ham. Hubby said it needs bacon too!

Very good!  One of the more filling, flavorful potatoe soups I've had.  I added some carrots and about a cup of finely shredded cheddar cheese for color and flavor.  Will defineltly make again.

I thought it needed a few more spices - maybe a little more salt - maybe I didn't add enough to begin with.

I did not include the cooked ham - that could have been part of the spice/flavor problem.

I did add a can of Great Northern Beans.  They added protein and fiber to the meal.  Yum!

Just okay for me.  Made as written.  It wasn't bad, by any means, but just seemed to be missing something.  I have a few other potato soup recipes I enjoy much more.

The flavor with the seasonings was a nice difference, but I was hoping the soup would be a little more creamy.  Also, I thought the recipe called for too many potatoes.

Very good!! I had a huge crowd here tonight and doubled the recipe. I did feel it needed to be thickened up just a tad and added a small amount of cornstarch/water slurry. Offered Crumbled Bacon and Shredded Cheddar and everyone was very happy! Compliments all around. Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic! The household doesn't really care for celery anyhing, but where there is a cream soup, there is a replacement cream soup ready to fullfill it's role. In this case, I used mushroom soup with a cup of mushrooms, sauteed with the ham and onions. This was a wonderful soup that pleased us all. I would suggest a little bit of flour mixture and cheese, as someone else posted, just to give it that extra thickness. A keeper!

This soup is seriously amazing. I will definitely be making it again. However, 2 1/2 lbs of potatoes was way too much. I used just under 2 lbs and it was perfect. l

OMG!  This was incredibly easy and everyone loved it!  You can even substitue "Simply Potatoes" diced potatoes (in the refrigerator section) if you're in a hurry!  Great comfort soup!

I am rating this recipe on the listed ingredients.  This is a very good soup.  My husband and 10 year old really liked it.  I enjoyed it as well.  My husband asked me to keep this in the recipe box and close at hand.  I think it would taste wonderful with a little shredded cheddar.  I think just a very little bacon on top would work wonderful too.  If you like potato soup, you should at least give this a try.

WONDEFUL!  Made vegetarian/vegan by substituting with 2 cubed vegetarian hot dogs for the ham and coconut milk for cow's milk. I followed all the advise about the salt and did not use any.  MY FAMILY LOVED IT!! I will be making this again!! Thank you!!

Very good overall.  The broth was a bit thin, so I will take the recommendations that might make it a creamier base.  I need up taking this for lunch several days in a row and didn't get sick of it.  I think that's a good sign :-)

Made this earlier today for a hearty snow day soup to warm everyone up. The boyfriend took his first bite and exclaimed, "This is kick butt!" Well, he used a different word. But, you get the point.  I didn't add the garlic powder (forgot) and did not have any salt-free seasoning on hand. I semi-mashed some of the potato chunks when they became tender, just because I like that texture. The rest of it was made per the recipe. Served it with a big loaf of sourdough bread for dunking. They complimented each other well.  This one is a new winter favorite. Thank you!

This soup is very good.  I followed the recipe to the letter the first time I made it. The  second time I added mild cheddar cheese, and frozen whole kernel corn to the soup.  I served it with corn bread, and the meal was just fantastic.

Even though I had changed a few things, I give this one a 5 star plus.I made 16 servings and needed more! I'm lactose so I changed the 4cups of milk to 2cups(1can) coconut milk and 2cups of soy milk. I added  2 cans green beans,shredded carrots and followed others on the spices. Pepper instead of salt, chopped garlic and used all-seasonings. Wow, this soup is so quick and easy, will keep this to use many times. Thank you for the recipe.

I could not have picked a better day to make this recipe as the weather outside was just begging for homemade soup.  It was delicious and I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of that I added about eight "baby carrots", finely chopped, to give it a little color.

This was great. It was NOT bland as others are saying. Maybe my taste-buds are over zealous though! Only change I made was that I used Dijonnaise because thats all I had available. Good job Allana!

This soup was so good and very easy.  I substituted 8 oz. of the chicken broth with juice from the ham, sauted minced garlic with the onion and ham and used a half cup of heavy whipping cream in place of the milk.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery because that's what was in the cupboard.  And, I mashed up some of the potatoes.  I'd definitely make this again!

SO DELICIOUS!  And incredibly easy too.  When I make it the next time, I'll cut the potatoes a lot smaller and add more ham.  It definitely does not need a lot of salt - I lightly sprinkled seasoning salt, and it was still fairly salty (not too much, tho).  But very delicious and very easy!  Hubby thought I spent beaucoup time in the kitchen when really I had not!  (it mostly cooks itself)

I made this using leftover smoked shoulder, figuring that the texture/taste of it would compliment the potatoes. I was a bit dissapointed, though, because the first step (cooking the ham with the onions) eliminated the texture/flavor of the smoked shoulder. Also, I made this dish ahead of time, let it cool in the refrigerator, and the heated it for dinner. The time it spent in the fridge thickened it, for initially it was too thin. Still, it was warming and filling, especially served with cornbread.

Made this for dinner last night and the family really liked it. I did mash up some of the potatoes and add a handfull of chedder cheese to the soup and garnished with a bit more cheese. Next time I will add more ham too, but the flavor was good and it was easy to make! Thanks!!

I followed this recipe closely, in order to evaluate it properly.  I did use more ham, so had to use more broth.  I had a nearly empty jar of mustard and used it up, so there was more than 1 tbsp---perhaps 2.  That left a bit more mustardy flavor than I would have preferred, yet it was delicious, rich, creamy and good. There are many fine recipes for potato soup, but in my experience this is one of the more flavorful and unique.  Just stay close to the recommended ratios--or else, write your own.  Bring 'em on!

I thought this soup was ok.  It's not the best potato soup I've ever had.  I mashed the potatos down to make it creamier.  I also followed others suggestions and left out the salt.  But I ended up adding some salt on my own because I felt it was necessary.  I don't know if THAT much salt is needed, but some makes a big difference.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really easy and tasty; it is the dijon mustard that make it!  My only complaint is that I used a pound of potatoes, since that's all I had, and they barely fit under the chicken broth.  I would never have been able to fit 2 1/2 pounds under that amount of liquid.  I sprinkled grated cheddar on top, and served with garlic toast.  Next time, I think I'll add even more dijon mustard.  Yummy!

Sorry, but I can only give this three stars since A LOT of modifications were necessary to turn it into what was ultimately a FIVE start soup. Prepared as written, it is only threee stars.    To amp it up in star quality, the potatoes needed to be pureed (as others recommended)to thicken the soup before it could considered anything but a "broth."    I had to use more onion (1/2 C), much more ham (1 C), I added diced celery (1/2 C), and more seasonings (1 t pepper and 1 T Adobo)to help the recipe find its pulse.     And since it was still significantly UNDERwhelming, I had to reach for a "hail Mary" in my pantry and refrigerator and decided on a tablespoon of pimento and about a tablespoon of the juice from the jar.     Suddenly, and almost miraculously, the soup turned into FIVE star flavor and appearance.     I would definitely serve the recipe (as modified) to guests.

This was really great - followed recipe exactly except excluded the ham and added turkey bacon instead, took some of the potatoes when it was done and mashed them, then added them back in -a nice mix of chunk and smooth...super yummy will definitely make this again!

This recipe is a good base. Mine came out watery, next time I'll add 2 T of flour to the sauted ham and onions and brown. I added parsley, dill, and some cheddar cheese. Before it was too bland.

Excellent soup!  We put roasted garlic in with the onion and ham, and used Lactaid milk instead of regular milk, but other than that, we didn't change a thing.  It was amazing and a great winter meal.

I am making this right now.  The only difference is I am putting in a little bacon and no ham and some fresh garlic and herbs.  And I will NOT add the canned soup.  Gag!  and the canned poato soup is nasty!

I loved this recipe. When I made it the second time, I substituted 1 1/2 C. half and half and 1/2 C. milk for the 1 1/2 cups milk it called for.  I also used cream of mushroom soup, instead of the celery.  I also found I preferred real diced garlic versus the garlic powder, so that's what I used.  I might also use sea salt versus the seasoned, as I wasn't crazy about that flavor, combined with the ham.  This is a tasty recipe and super easy, and it heats up really well.  I would also recommend doubling for a crowd, or taking it to a soup supper potluck!

The key to this recipe is to use the juice from the ham.  I saved it after I baked the ham and used it in place of some of the chicken broth.  It gave it a good rich flavor.

This turned out to be the best potato soup I have ever made.  I had to add more stock to cover and cook the potatoes but it just has a wonderful flavor to it.  I also added some carrots to it.

I love this soup! It's now the only Potato soup I make. Even my husband likes it and he is a picky eater. I substitute sausage for the ham and use pepper instead of seasoning salt. Great comfort food for those cold and rainy afternoons.

This turned out awesome! So tasty! I made a couple minor changes just based on my tastes. I ended up using 3 cans of chicken broth because the taters weren't submerged in liquid. I boiled everything until the taters melted in my mouth. Didn't include the ham, instead topped each bowl with shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon and green onions. This one is a keeper!!

This was a great recipe! Instead of butter I cooked up 4 slices of  diced bacon and added the onions and potatoes to that! It gave the soup a really good flavor! I will so make this again!

I've made many recipes from this site.  Most of them just once.  This potato soup is aptly named.  We *loved* it!  It truly was easy, quick and versatile as other reviewers had said.

This was tasty. I meant to add carrots and forgot. I did add a bay leaf and some Emirl's essence. Just a pinch or two. Also added 2 heaping  TBL flour to the milk to thicken, brought it to a boil, then a bunch of cheddar.

most excellent potato soup!  I made some for me & my boyfriend.  Took the leftovers into work, the girls loved it!  One said I inspired her so much she went home and made her recipe for potato soup......and hated it!  She came into work the next day begging for this recipe, which I gladly shared.  Very good soup.

This soup was sooooo Yummy.  I made it according to the recipe except for the addition of corn. I think the next time I make it I will add both corn and string beans.   I was worried about the consistency so I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it up. I also mashed some of the potatoes with a fork per other reviewers.  I added salt at the end to taste, because didn’t want it to be too salty. I used some leftover ham but I think it would have been great also with some thick bacon as well.  It came out warm and creamy and my DH and my little one year old son loved it, as well as myself.  It made really great leftovers and went well with warm crusty bread.  Very easy and yummy give it a try!!!

Made it for my wife and I last night (I cook...lol). It was so easy and the taste was superb. I substituted bacon for the ham and added some cheese upon serving. Next time, I will use ham. I highly recommend this recipe!!!!

I thougth it was great.  I substituted evaporated skim to save on calories, ran short on potatoes and used a cup of instant spuds, and it was super.  I topped it with a sprinkle of crumbled bacon, a dollop of fat free sour cream and fresh sprig of parsley.  Served with awesome ceasar salad, it was a family pleaser.

I've never made potato soup before, but this recipe sounded good.    I did modify it a bit.   I used bacon instead of ham.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream  of celery.  I added some pepper and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.   I mashed up the potatoes a bit and added some cheese to make it creamier.    I loved the soup.  It tasted great, it had enough spice and was thick and creamy.     Overall this is a great recipe, it just needed a few changes to make it even better.

Really delicious. Used low salt chicken broth, did not add any salt and was perfect. Also substituted the milk for skim milk. I also mashed the potatoes. Added spinach at the end. And, because I am a truffle junkie, I added a spoonfull to my plate (my hubby hates the stuff). OUT OF THIS WORLD. Having leftovers tonight. Tks Allana.

This is a great recipe that can be modified with anything that's in your pantry!  I only had beef broth, and I used ham lunch meat.  I also substituted a large can of cream of mushroom.  (Had to add more salt and added black pepper)  I used the immersion blender to make it creamy and it was fantastic.  This is a no fail recipe and SO quick!!!  Thank you!!!  Next time I'm going to try adding the corn like someone suggested.  yummo!

It's not bad, but all it is is a couple of cans of soup with potatoes added. Why not just buy a can of potato soup?

We have made this potato Soup Recipe many times all with GREAT success. I know you will find the taste and flavor very  good, also you will find this a very easy soup to make. So anyone will be able to make this and come out with excellent results. WE do use a ham slice that comes from a bone in ham.

Love potato soup! I used bacon instead of ham, added carrots and celery, and instead of cream of celery soup (I didn't have any) made a flour/milk thickener. My husband and I also like some heat, so I added a few dashes of tabasco sauce that made it amazing!
