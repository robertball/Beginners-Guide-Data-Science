I have to give a three based on the original recipe. It wasn't very flavourful. I made it a second time, added about 2 tbsp white vinegar, fresh grated ginger, fresh crushed garlic (3 small segments), 1 tbsp sesame oil and 1 tbsp sesame seeds. I replaced the honey with maple syrup . I also added onion powder. The original recipe is basically a fantastic base to build your own next level sauce . Try out my take on this one and you won't be disappointed :)

Made a double batch. I substituted 1/2 cup of water (1/4 or the called for water) for 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, because I used half of it as a marinade for my chicken, before thickening the rest. 

I served it mixed with the chicken that I cubed and marinated with the sauce and cooked with sesame oil. If you are new to using sesame oil, it has a very low flash point, so use half sesame oil and half some other oil. I use canola.  After the chicken was cooked, I added a can of pineapple chunks, drained, and half of the thickened sauce and simmered for about 3 minutes, just to get everything hot again (pineapple was room temperature) and incorporated, stirring once or twice. The other half of the sauce had on the side. 

This was all served over white rice, cooked in chicken broth with a little ginger added.

Everybody loved it, even my son's girlfriend, who is a very finnicky eater.

Good, could have been a bit more flavorful.  Next time I'll use fresh garlic and a lot more as well as ginger.  But good from just what is in my pantry in a pinch.

Great Basic stir fry sauce! Just what I was looking for. You can go any which way from here.... Sweeter, Spicier, Thicker, Thinner, etc. But this sauce is great just the way it is.

okay, so, I used all the same ingredients. I used my own measurements and added flour to thicken a little more since a lot of the reviews said it wasn't thick enough. 

the mix of the ingredients made a wonderful taste. I did just four stars because I didn't actually do what the instructions said. I loved it anyway though! (as well as VERY picky husband, who doesn't eat ANY terkyaki) thanks for the dinner boost.

I think each person has a a slightly different opinion of what teriyaki sauce should taste like. But I think this is a good base to start with, and then tweak it to your personal taste. Like the rest of the reviews I found it not overly flavorful. I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup more soy sauce and a total of about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of honey. I noticed in the other reviews the vinegar that was added and will probably put in a touch of that next time I make it. I think most people have a slightly different opinion of what teriyaki sauce should taste like. But I think this is a good base to start with, and then tweak it to your personal taste.

Excellent!  Living in Costa Rica we don't have easy access to many of the things that I use to cook with in the US...   If we do manage to find it, it is usually 2-3 more expensive than back home.  So I find the cheaper alternative is to make my own.   This recipe was one of them...  I needed it for a new recipe that I had found.  I made no changes and It came out wonderful !!  I have added it to my arsenal of homemade sauces and will definitely use it again!!

One of my favorite dishes at Islands are their Yaki tacos, but I needed a good sauce. This was simple and easy to make. Like others I replaced 1/4 cup of the water with Apple cider vinegar, 2 Tbsp of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, 3 cloves fresh chopped garlic and 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. I would like to use fresh ginger next time. This made plenty for our needs and even some left over.  I will make this again ..

Very quick to make Andy use. We ordered Chinese food and they barely gave us sauce on the chicken so I thought why not make a glaze or sauce and this popped up first in the search engine on google. 

Amazing and like that I made it to my own zing minus the measurement for water. But then again I’m again I meant familiar with cooking.

I  agree with most reviews left as far as depth of flavor, there wasn’t enough.    The recipe was simple to follow and I added a couple teaspoons of liquid  aminos  all purpose seasoning (from soy protein)  which gave it the perfect flavor for me. 
 Thank you for this recipe and I will definitely make it again with the modification included.

Ground ginger and garlic? FRESH always. Had no honey so used raw agave. Also added some rice wine and a bit of a Thai pepper and bottom of green onion. Skipped the corn starch. Did salmon with rice, asparagus and mushrooms. Also a sprinkle of sesame oil and a diced green onion top. Quite tasty.  I rarely do any recipe straight up. Always just use as a frame.

*This was a good tasting Teriyaki Sauce, I made the recipe as written except for the honey, didn't have any, and I used Tamari instead of Soy Sauce. 
*I think next time I may add 1/2 cup of Tamari because the soy taste was a bit bland for my taste. I also bumped up the garlic to 1/2 Tsp, I love the taste of garlic in my food and it so suits this particular sause. I will make it again, thanks for the recipe!

I initially tried the recipe, subbing pineapple juice for the water and adding caramelized onions, and it was great. The second time I kept the onions but used the water instead of the juice and liked it even better. This is a great basic teriyaki sauce that tastes exactly like it's supposed to, and it's dead-simple.

I disagree with a lot of reviewers that this isn't a very flavorful sauce, or that it's not very thick. It's thick enough, and a lot of other sauce recipes are too sweet and salty for my taste. This recipe would be great if you subbed fresh garlic and ginger, and added some sesame oil and seeds.

This teriyaki sauce was very simple and tasted great. I didn't add honey (none on hand) and I simmered a bottle of Dr Pepper down to a thick sauce before adding these ingredients.

I have made this several times. It’s almost exactly what my mom used... I remember her instructing me when making stirfrys. 
Perfect for making any kind of stirfry. 
I add it over the meat and veggies at the end.

I made  delicious glazed turkey meatballs with this but added 1 T sesame oil and 1 T apple cider vinegar. I used two 20-oz packages of lean ground turkey to make 40 meatballs and seared them on medium high heat in batches of 10, then just poured all the sauce (without the 1/4 c water or cornstarch) into the pan with all the meatballs and let it reduce until the meatballs were glazed and sticky. I may leave the vinegar out next time, not sure if it contributed much. If you reduce the sauce in this way, it turns into a 'glaze', no cornstarch needed.  If you make this be sure to sprinkle on toasted sesame seeds and sliced scallions! This teriyaki sauce recipe is a keeper :)

3 stars and only after I tweaked it. I followed the instructions exactly and it was was really sour and strong. I added a LOT more brown sugar before it tasted okay. It did not set up at all and was very liquidy.

Lacks flavor. Others mention that it is a great launching point for a great sauce, I guess I was looking for a great sauce. Read this recipe at the store, knew I had ingredients at home so I was confident on my menu. It was not what I would serve again. I’m sure fresh ginger and garlic would have helped and that is the recipe I would have hope for. Not trying again n

Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I modified the recipe big time.  But loved the basic recipe.  I followed some of the other suggestions posted in that I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar.  I was making this to use in a Pineapple Chicken recipe so I wanted the acid.  I used fresh ground ginger. Also used fresh garlic. DId not use soy sauce.  Instead, I replaced it with 5 TBSP worchestershire sauce mixed with 2 TBSP water.  Replaced the brown sugar and honey with 2 TBSP pure maple syrup and 2 TBSP honey.  Wasn't looking for a lot of sweetness because of using it with pineapple in my other recipe.  This will be my go-to recipe to adapt as needed when recipes call for teriyaki sauce.

I didnt have any cornstarch or garlic powder on hand, so I substituted flour and crushed garlic. It was amazing.

Like most people who have made this recipe and reviewed it, it is a good base for a Teriyaki sauce because it does end up being not so flavorful. I decided to make it into a tangy-orange teriyaki by using the zest of half of and orange, the juice of a whole orange, two table spoons of lemon juice, and a half tablespoon of red chili flakes. My family enjoyed it with some battered and fried chicken. I gave this recipe a three star because of the amount of extra things I had to put into it to really make it more teriaki like.

I doubled everything except the water. I used fresh garlic and coconut amino's instead of soy due to allergy. Added 1/2 tsp onion powder and substituted 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar for water. The key is to let it simmer a long time to reduce the water down. The longer it simmers, the better the flavor.  At least 30 minutes over low heat and stirring occasionally.

This was a great basic teriyaki sauce recipe. I was in a pinch since I had forgotten to pick up sauce at the store. I remembered a friend had recommended this recipe, so I followed the recipe exactly. I found it a bit too bland, and added a bit more honey, more ginger and garlic powders, and a bit of Japanese pepper powder. My son and my friend absolutely loved it. I found it could do with some acidity, and a bit more flavor. Next time, I’ll try to add some orange juice or vinegar, use fresh garlic and ginger, and add onion powder.

Remember childhood? This tiny sauce brought back so many pictures of when I was a little girl. Fire up the Habachi, slice the meat and grill like the old days. All I need now are some palm trees, ukelele music, poi and I'm home.

I've made this recipe many times before. Oddly enough it didn't thicken up like it normally does so I had to add a bit more cornstarch. Otherwise tastes amazing as always!.

Also made a double batch. I added some fine diced sweet onions and pineapple chunks and a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, then slow boiled until the onions and pineapple were tinder before adding the cornstarch. Poured over a whole chicken in the Crock-Pot and it was fantastic! Much thanks.

This is a great starter recipe. It works very well as a base for many variations on teriyaki. Replace some water with pineapple juice and it is something new. Add a little more corn starch and it makes a nice sticky dipping sauce.

I don't use teriyaki sauce very often and the bottle in my refrigerator was very old. I needed something to go on my chicken with the cauliflower fried rice type dish I was making. I also am watching my sodium intake. So, I made with low sodium soy sauce. I thought it was good and will make it again in the future.

Simple ingredients from my pantry! Sometimes BBQ sauce gets to be boring for quick recipes. Try this one! Changed nothing!

Even with the starch it was somewhat thin. I suggest adding arrowroit to the starch.

I liked it. Didn't use all the corn starch because I didn't want it real thick. Brushed it on chicken wings from the air fryer. Enjoyed it and will make it again.

made as directed, but doubled only the garlic powder, and this second time, I added toasted sesame oil, how much?  Several shakes of a fresh bottle, guessing a teaspoon.  As always, I use lower sodium soy sauce.  Can this sauce be frozen?  I'd love to make it that way, even if adding the cornstarch/water had to be added after defrosting.

The missing ingredient is vinegar, add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar or rice vinegar. Add another teaspoon to your liking if necessary. This is a very good basic recipe!!

This was okay but I never could get it thickened up as much as I thought it should be. I kept trying but the longer it went it started to taste like burnt sugar so I finally pulled it off of the stove. The flavor is good but I think it needs more thickener.
