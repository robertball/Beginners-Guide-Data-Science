I’ve had this in my recipe box for quite a while, and I’m so glad that I finally got around to fixing it.  It’s not something that you can throw together in a few minutes, but it’s worth the investment of time.  By all means, let the onions caramelize.  My cable company came right after I started this dish, and I lost my iPad connection for about 20 minutes while he was installing the new modem, so I just let the onions continue to cook.  I served this over an AR recipe ground beef patty, as well as some mashed potatoes.  The red wine definitely gives it a nice flavor.  This is a versatile gravy that I can see being served over so many different foods.

Just a note that some Worcestershire sauce has anchovies listed in the ingredients, for those of you who are wanting to make a vegetarian version.

The flavor was great and everyone loved the gravy with our Irish bangers and mash. I added nearly four times the flour though to thicken it enough. My only real problem was that the red wine turned the gravy pink. Next time I will either modify this one to use red onions and beef stock (calling it red onion gravy and deepening the color would be less of a turn off then having straight-up pink gravy) or just use Williams Sonoma recipe for Banger and Mash with red onion gravy.

Excellent using rich beef broth instead of chicken stock, plus the red wine. I used grainy Dijon mustard. Served with President's Choice English Bangers, mashed russet potatoes and petit pois. For the next day, I sliced the leftover cooked sausages and placed in a casserole, covered with leftover onion gravy, and topped with the leftover mashed potatoes (with green peas folded in). Reheated at 350F for 30 minutes--delicious Bangers and Mash Cottage Pie. Cheers!

I used beef stock, as I felt this would work better in the recipe and help reduce the pink color others reported. I reduced the amount of wine to somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 a cup but feel it was still too much. Next time I'll use 1/4 a cup at most. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so that was omitted. It was very good over bangers and mash, and will be 5 star worthy with a bit less wine.

This was great! I did cut the wine to 1/4 cup and used beef broth. I used  Kitchen Bouquet  to make the color turn back to brown after I saw that the wine gave the gravy a pink hue. This was perfect for the Bangers and Mash recipe.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it is fabulous!  It tastes like French Onion Soup and who doesn't love French Onion Soup? I only used 1/2 tsp of Dijon Mustard-in that amount it serves as a flavor enhancer, but isn't too "mustardy" tasting.  I was surprised at how easy carmelizing the onions is--I turned the heat to low and they virtually cooked themselves.  

The second time I used Williams Sonoma's beef stock concentrate instead of chicken stock like the first time I made it-both versions were equally good.  I used bangers from the Whole Foods meat department and if you can find bangers they taste much better than Italian Sausage or some other sausage substitute.  They have a more subtle flavor and I believe are seasoned with cardamom and coriander.  However, they have breadcrumbs in them, so they are not gluten-free.  I just added a photo of the gravy made in my 3.7 qt Mauviel saute pan.

Made both versions (veg & chicken), & would make again. Great umami, lots of compliments. Perfect with the bangers from Aldi.

This was very tasty! I didn't have any wine, so I just used a slightly increased amount of chicken stock. We liked very much, and I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Incredibly tasty, and a wonderful addition to my bangers and mash. I scaled back a little on the red wine per most people's advice and it turned out really well. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was really good.  I agree with another reviewer you really do need to let the onions caramelize to get the right consistency for this gravy.  I will add a little less of the red wine next time.

The wine overpowered the other flavors.  I would half it next time.
It would probably be better with beef broth if you have it available.
If you prefer thick gravy (American style), you will need to quadruple the flour.

I didn't have red wine so I used cooking Sherry instead. I also used Vidalia onions. It was absolutely amazing! Definitely with the time it took to make it! Carmelizing the onions is a must for this recipe. I did add a second tablespoon of for to it as it was all simmering because it wasn't thickening enough for my dish. That seemed to do the trick! Great recipe, definitely try it with Sherry!

I doubled the flour and added a special seasoning mix I have.

I also cooked my sausages separately, till browned, then threw them into the simmering gravy. While they were finishing off there I sloshed some water around in the sausage pan til it came to a boil in order  to render out the leavings from that pan and added it into the gravy. 

This was the first gravy I ever tried to make and I'll probably use this recipe as a starting point for any future gravies I try.

My sister helped me make this and it turned out well I guess. The onions took forever to brown, I think bc of all the liquid from the butter in the beginning. Overall I thought it was kinda bland but it served its purpose.

I've made onion gravy lots of times to go with my homemade sausages but this recipe with wine was a first. The reddish color looked weird and the taste of wine was too strong. I threw it away. If we all liked the same things the world would be a boring place!

The red wine was overwhelming. I needed to add some sugar to cut down on the acidity. I also needed to add onion powder since it tasted flat.

I have now made this recipe at least 6 times, with variations.  It's the best one I've found for Proper British Onion Gravy (approved by my Proper British Grandchildren) , but I have Thoughts.  The 4 stars  instead of 5: the time indications are misleading

Observations:  

Actually caramelizing the onions takes at least 40 to 60 minutes.  Honestly, you should do the caramelizing step the day before.

If you are going to use chicken stock as the liquid, you should use white wine -- which would solve the "purple color" that other reviewers have mentioned.   In one iteration, we didn't have white wine, so I used 1 tablespoon of tequila + 1/2 cup of water, in lieu of the 1/2 cup of wine. This was quite good.

In another  iteration, I didn't have a slow cooker, so I did the "Cook and stir onion in the melted butter until softened, about 10 minutes" on the stove top, and then put the onions in the oven on 150 degrees overnight.  This was quite good, but I still had to caramelize the onions on the stovetop in the morning.

The rest of the iterations have been using a Ninja System slow cooker / stovetop thingy. While the onions were soft and yummy, to get them to properly caramelize still required about a teaspoon full of sugar (to prompt the caramelization)   and about 10-20  minutes of stirring to get the proper, deep brown, jammy results.  

But do try this recipe.

I used beef base instead of chicken, because it's what I had at home. It turned out great. I did use 16oz of beef base instead of the 14.5 oz of chicken so I used a little cornstarch to thicken it up a little. My whole family loved it!

Nice, tasty gravy.  Though I have a lot left over.   There's just the two of us and I'm the gravy nut.  I might use the extra as a base for veggie beef soup or stew.  I'd add more stars to this if I could.

5 thumbs up from the family.  Made as written.  Perfect.  I did add some gravy browning as the colour was not  very appealing.  It made it a lovely dark brown, but would have not changed the taste at all.  This will be my go too for onion gravy.

This was very good with the sausages I used. I think next time I might try a little creamy horseradish instead of the mustard.
