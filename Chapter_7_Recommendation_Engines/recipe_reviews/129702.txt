These turned out great. I didn't have the powdered coffee mix on hand, so I had to modify the recipe slightly. I used half white and half brown sugar. This made a nice, dense brownie - just right for dipping in the chocolate. I dipped the top and sides in chocolate, then drizzled with melted pink and red candy wafers. They were a big hit!

Wonderful flavor, very decadent and fudgy brownie. Wow.  I followed the recipe to the letter and was careful not to overbake as suggested, but these were hard to cut out as the top was not smooth and soft, so they cracked as I was attempting to cut. I think next time I will turn them over and cut from the bottom instead. I pressed the leftover scraps into the cutters to make several extra. That worked well as the chocolate coating covered the resulting imperfections (I coated the sides of the brownies as well).

this recipe was so easy and came out with a nice fudgy taste. the coffee mix added a nice undertone. helpful hint: dip the botttom side of the brownie into the chocolate. this will allow you to have a nice crunchy/hard bottom and the soft sticky side is covered with chocolate.

I made these exactly as directed and they tasted delicious! Just the right hint of coffee flavor and I used Cafe Vienna by International Coffees. My only concern was that the top had a thick layer that cracked so they were hard to dip. Instead of dipping I just used a plastic bag with the corner cut and drizzled some melted choclate squares and also some white almond bark. Verty cute! Looks fancy but easy to do.

While watching the super bowl I decided we needed browine and all I had was unsweetened chocolate. So, I made these into brownies and just used a few tablespoons of instant coffee instead of the suggested flavored coffee. Not a huge fan of those fake coffees. Trying to make these a little healthier, I did not bother with the chocolate on top. I used 1 stick of butter and 4 oz of applesauce. And also used egg whites only. These were good but I personally think nothing beats the fudginess of a boxed brownie mix.
