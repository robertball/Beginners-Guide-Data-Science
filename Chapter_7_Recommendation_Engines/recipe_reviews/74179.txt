I did not care for this recipe. I love seafood and I love bloody mary's so I was determined to make this recipe work. The bloody mary mix just doesn't seem to take to the seafood, it disappears with the cooking process.

Great recipe but must be tweeked a little.  Buy uncooked shimp and marinade in the mix for a minimum of 12 hours.  Personally when I shrimp, I place it in the marinade immediately and label the freezer bag until I am ready to use it.  I place it in the refrigerator to thaw at least 24 before.  As it thaws it is also marinading itself.  The liquid in the bad keeps the shrimp from getting freezer burn if you elimate all the air from the bag before freezing.  Everyone requests this at every grill out we attend.

This is very easy and cooks in just minutes.  I would add some minced garlic or maybe use chili garlic paste instead of the hot pepper sauce next time.  Overall this was pretty tasty.

I am actually not a big fan of bloody mary's however I had half a bottle of mix left over from a party so decided to make this. I thought it was fantastic. I did not have an issue with the flavor at all. I cooked on a hot griddle instead of the grill and it was really really good. I was actually taken by surprise by how much we liked it. I marinated for about 2 hours and skewered then sprinkled with a little old bay before cooking. Served over rice...really happy with this.

Pretty good, although I didn't really taste a lot of the Bloody Mary mix.  I added Old Bay and garlic to spice it up and it worked well.  I didn't have halibut so left that out. I tried this to use up Bloody Mary mix and while I don't know if I'd buy it or make it just for this recipe, if I had more to use up I'd try it again.  Thanks for the recipe!
