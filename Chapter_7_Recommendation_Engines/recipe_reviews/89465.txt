So glad to find this recipe because I had all those veggies and needed a way to use them!  I sliced the potatoes (skin on) and sauteed the potato with the onion briefly with several whole sprigs of fresh thyme before adding the squash & tomatoes.  This was great with marinated grilled "Unbelievable Chicken" from AR.

This is great. I guess the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it is almost too simple, ie all the goodness is in the freshness of the vegetables.

This was great! Next time I will throw in some bell pepper to add a little color, but the taste is fantastic.

Great new way to use summer veggies especially yellow squash.
