This is a quick and easy and very delicious dinner to prepare.  I used a packet of Costco boneless skinless chicken breasts and followed the recipe.  The bread crumbs I used were the Progresso Italian bread crumbs.  I did make my own herbes de Provence using a recipe from this site.  Timing was perfect and dinner was delicious.  We will have this one again.  You can't miss!  Thank you so much, EmmieYum!

I didn't have the herbes de Provence or the ingredients to make it myself.  However, the rest of the instructions plus the herbs I added that I had on hand- garlic, poultry seasoning, salt/ pepper, etc- made this delicious.  I highly recommend it  and will try it soon with the herbes de Provence.

This was very easy to prepare.   My husband really liked the flavor.   I used panko bread crumbs to give it a little more crunch.

This was great! Easy, tasty, and toddler approved. I followed the directions but doubled the recipe to make 4 chicken breasts. I used thin cut breasts, so I did lower the bake temp to 400, which worked just right. My bread crumbs were Italian style. I think the herbs de Provence really work well with the recipe. But if you don't have it or don't like it, I'm pretty sure Italian seasoning would give you a good result too. Will be adding this to the meal rotation!

This is easy and fast to make.  I didn't have cornflakes but a package of Kraft Stove Top did the trick.  I could've ground it down to a fine bread crumb consistancy but I wanted the crunch so I just emptied a package to pan and with the basted chicken of mayo, indicated spices (left out the cheese), badda-bing .... excellente'   Definitely a keeper!

I made this as per instructions. It needs added salt and the Parmesan mixture slid off the chicken into the baking pan. The chicken ended up flavorless. I think the chicken should be pounded out an even thickness to hold the mixture on top.

Turned out perfect.  I used freshly grated parmesan, otherwise followed exact recipe.  The chicken was very moist with a nice crispy  coating.  Will be making this again.  Happy Granny

I spread oil and some spices on the bottom of the Corningware, added some spices into the mayo(I used the olive oil type)/cheese mixture, as well the the bread crumbs. I added some ground flax seed 1 tbsp into the bread crumbs. Use a spatula to server and the crumbs will stay on.  My spices were basil, oregano, thyme, pepper, garlic, onion powder.

It was very good but I had some problems keeping the breadcrumbs on the chicken. The mayo sort of kept them on but could have been better. Overall good recipe though

This was fantastic! I did not have the herbs de provenance so i just used a bunch of my own seasonings and it came out fantastic!!! So glad to have this for a quick go to and seems like you can substitute in a pinch with great results.

This was delicious! Very moist and easy to make. I didn't have the spices mentioned, but instead used a pinch of chili power, cayanne pepper, oregano, and garlic power. Will make again!

Very easy to make.  I pound the chicken so it's the same thickness and added more mayo and cheese before topping with bread crumbs.
