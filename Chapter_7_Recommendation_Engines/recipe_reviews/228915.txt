This recipe was really easy to make, I used instead of onions some leeks that I had on hand and needed to use up.  I also baked them for a bit to melt the cheese and served them with lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream on top.  Yummy:)

This was surprisingly quick and easy!  I'm a novice in the kitchen and would use the term "cook" very lightly.  This dish was very tasty with great flavor.  I made 4 very healthy-sized tacos with toppings and have enough left over for 1 more taco for lunch.  I also could only get the green salsa in a 24oz jar so I have plenty to make this at least 2 more times.  Next time when I'm at a loss for something to make, I'll turn to this.  Fantastic! :0)

This recipe was REALLY good! I just tweaked it by using garden salsa instead of the suggested green salsa. It is a great dish for those who don't like beans,which I do not!

Black Bean Tacos Haiku: "A nostalgic meal. Cheap meal I made in college. Still a win for me!" I used to make the nearly identical thing in my dorm room, but prepared it entirely (don't laugh...) in the coffepot of my coffee maker. Finding and making this recipe on the stovetop and eating it more like a "grown-up" still brought back memories b/c it's easy, budget-friendly, healthy and tasty. We ate ours in romaine lettuce "boats" w/ toppings and loved every bite.

WOW!!! This dish is amazingly delicious and so easy to make. I made a few modifications--sautéed onion (yellow & red), bell pepper (red, orange & yellow), and diced chili peppers for extra flavor. Added a pinch of salt & sugar to the mixture as well. My fiancé & loved it--definitely adding to my repertoire!

This recipe is great.   I cooked this for 15 minutes and it tasted like it needed more seasoning.  I just let it keep cooking on very very low heat for another 15 minutes and the flavors were full on.  So the recommended seasonings were perfect in my humble opinion.

I loved this recipe as well!! It was simple and delicious. I didn't have canned beans so I boiled some, which it didn't take too long. About an hour and a half. I already had green salsa made so all I had to add was the cumin onions and instead of garlic powder I chopped up 2 garlic cloves, smallest pieces as possible. Definitely recommend this recipe :-)

FRY Your Spices!!! First,  Fry Onions until Lightly Brown. Then Add Spices. Fry for 1 Minute. Add WETIngredients. Blooming/Frying Spices Activate the Oils in the Spices and GivenYou that Punch of Flavor. Adding Spices with Wet Ingredients Boil the Spices and Do Not Give You the Flavor Intended AND you are Wasting Your Money. ALWAYS FRY SPICES BEFORE ADDING WET.??

I also added a can of diced tomatoes, green chilies, and some beer and lime juice to boost the flavor. Pairs well with some fried potatoes inside too!

Everyone loved them and didn't miss the meat at all!  I used one clove of minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder, and I didn't have any salsa verde so used roasted tomato & chipotle salsa (Archer Farms from Target) and it worked beautifully.  Can't wait to make these again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this recipe today and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. It took me a bit longer to make because I always use dried beans. I also used fresh garlic and some diced red onion. I didnt use salsa verde because I didn't have any. We loved it!

Oh my this was good!  Didn't miss the meat at all.  Omitted the garlic powder & used chili seasoning packet instead of chili powder (about a tablespoon).  Everything else the same and then topped it with the cheese & some diced tomatoes.  I love hard-shelled tacos and with these I felt they were more healthy and less fattening.

I gave this 5 stars because it is so easy and flavorful (you can always add more spices) and with rice it can be the main course of a quick and easy vegan meal! I double the recipe, make a big pot of rice and I have dinner and a few lunches made!

Very tasty but we always add a fresh jalapeno - with or without seeds - to our black beans to add a bit of heat.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe. I couldn’t let this one go by without letting the recipe poster know how much we loved these tacos. These are better than traditional beef tacos! Easy, inexpensive and filling! I also made the Easy Cilantro-Lime Rice from this site, which I also highly recommend! As soon as we were finished eating I sent both these recipes off to my daughters.

This was tasty and quick, but I'm not sure it would be enough for four people, even if you worked out how to split the six taco shells! I served it as a dinner for two (three tacos each), and it was just about the right amount.

Very yummy!  Such a nice change.  Doubled the recipe,  as I had a 29 ounce can of been,   did not have the verde sauce,  substituted about 3 Tbsp of frozen chopped hatch chilis.  Will add chopped cilantro next time.   Terrific recipe,  thank you!

Easy to make, but maybe a little too simple in flavour. Not bad though and it will do in a pinch if I don't enough time/ingredients to make a more flavourful non-meat taco filling.

Perfect. I used prepared garlic and mashed the beans a bit before serving with cheese to my picky 5 year old. She LOVED this! Super easy, super quick. Winner!

Loved it! So flavourful, easy and filling. I read the helpful reviews and added a clove of garlic to the chopped onion in the beginning. I also used regular salsa instead and was still delicious!

Made this for my daughters engagement party and everyone loved it.  It's a nice side dish as well  as to compliment street tacos.

I loved it! I doubled the recipe, added 1 pound of ground meat, (browned) and served it like a chili. It makes a mild chili with the spice proportion per the recipe. May make this in the crock pot next time. Sharing with friends!

Excellent!  I added spices in while stir frying and doubled the recipe to make a small crockpot full!  My vegetarian friends requested the recipe and I loved it as an addition to my beef taco meat!!! Will keep this as a goto & its soooo easy!!!  Thank you!!!

I used bean medley. I think the green sauce that I used was spicy, but it was really good and the kids liked it.

Followed the recipe exactly. Served with sour cream on the side and it was sooooo good. My boyfriend isn't even a vegetarian and he ate 5 tacos! This is a new favourite!

Fast, easy and delicious too! Both kids loved it, even though one at first didn't want to eat it. Think my teenager can make it on her own too.

Very much enjoyed the seasonings with this! Was intrigued by the black beans, but my family is not vegetarian and wanted meat...soooo...I added hamburger to the mix, and it turned out great!!  :)  Oh, also, kept the salsa out and served on the side.

It was ok.  I thought it was a little bland.  May try it again if I can think of some ways to add some zip to it.
