I lost the recipe I had for this cream cheese frosting/filling and found it here.  I guess it's not my secret anymore!  I use the filling (always a double batch) with any kind of cake, and layer it with fruit, usually strawberries or raspberries.  To prevent the cake from absorbing the juice and color from the berries, I spread a thin layer of the frosting on the bottom of the cake layer before I put it on top of the fruit, which already sits on a thick layer of frosting.  The raves I get from this are unbelievable.  My nephew who doesn't eat desserts asked for a second helping.  My boss--who is stingy with compliments--took a bite, stopped, forgot himself, and raved about it.  And EVERYBODY asks for the recipe.  When I offered the recipe for the filling only, they didn't understand.  Use the filling with ANY cake, ANY fruit, or use your imagination with chocolate, nuts, or other flavors.  

Once the finished cake is refrigerated, the filling sets to a wonderful texture, lighter than your average frosting but firmer.

If you want to impress somebody, use this filling.

I have made this cake twice now, and both times it was a big hit. Delicious, moist, not too sweet, and excellent presentation. Like others, I would just make a few minor modifications:

(1) If you have the time, I recommend making the chocolate cake from scratch using the "Dark Chocolate Cake I" recipe from "Carol." You will either need to customize that recipe to make enough for two 9-inch round pans instead of the three called for, OR you can use the extra batter to make cupcakes!

(2) As others have noted, you should absolutely double the other ingredients for the frosting. Otherwise there will not be enough to properly cover the top layer and sides.

(3) I feel that one 1-ounce square of chocolate is not enough to make the shavings. I'd use two! Also, I've found that it helps to microwave (or otherwise warm) the chocolate before shaving, as this helps achieve the curls you want rather than just messy specks.

Used the Dark Chocolate Cake I recipe.  The icing is really good, but I like my cakes to have more depth.  So I played around with using coffee in the cake recipe to make a mocha cake, added chopped hazelnuts to the side, and topped with shaved chocolate.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  This was my first attempt at homemade cake and I think I did pretty good.  Like another reviewer for the cake portion I used the recipe for Dark Chocolate Cake I by Carol.  Next time I will double the filling, I did not have enough and ended up making whipped cream for part of inside layer.  The filling is the best!

A solid, pleases everyone chocolate cake with yummy frosting.  Not something I would make to impress company with my baking prowess, but it DID get devoured.  MAKE 1 AND 1/2 THE FROSTING (doubling it, as suggested below, is waaay too much - and i love frosting.  1.5 is just right!)

This is simply delicious! So easy to make and looks beautiful. Others have said not enough filling but I felt it was the perfect amount! I have tried other torte recipes and I finally figured out an easy way to split the layers...I used a wooden spoon laying behind the cake and rested the knife edge on it then as I cut I "spun" the cake and it was a perfect cut!

Delicious!  Both rich tasting and light textured. I used a butter recipe fudge cake mix for the cake. I think next time I will double the filling recipe.

I was so nervous about making this cake.  It was for my brother's bday and I had never made a torte, and I am NOT a professional cake decorator by any means.  So I was really nervous about it looking good.  I doubled the filling (except for the brown sugar, which I did 1.5 the amount) and it came out perfect, not too sweet.  I made it the day before and chilled it in the fridge so it would be firm.  For the cake mix I used strong coffee instead of water to bring out the chocolate flavor and added chocolate chips.  The cake was so fudgy and moist and the filling complimented it beautifully.  I also layered in sliced strawberries.  Cutting the two cakes in half was not the most fun, lol.  But the cake turned out gorgeous!  Everyone raved about how it looked and tasted.  My brother said it was the best bday cake he'd ever had :)

This torte is easy to make, and is very, very delicious!!!  My only complaint was that I thought it would look prettier than it really did.  This could also be due to my own inexperience in putting together things like this, but just be forewarned, that if you're not an expert, you may find that it tastes a lot better than it looks!!  That being said, I did take it to a party, and people really did rave about it.

Fabulous!  It looked like a bakery cake and tasted wonderful, very moist and rich.  I doubled the amount of filling, as others suggested.  I will definitely make this again.

Fabulous recipe!  Whenever I try a new recipe for the first time, as a rule, I ALWAYS follow it exactly.  After the first time, I often make changes and/or substitutions.  This torte was delightful!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I made the torte for a family get-together and everyone raved.  My husband, who is quite finnicky, absolutely adored it!  He and I both thank the author.

I made this for dessert for Christmas. We celebrated 1 week early. Everyone was in love with the meal. All receipes from here. But disappointed in the torte. Sorry, but NO FLAVOR! That was the major complaint. I was embarassed to make such a dessert that no one liked! I will not make it again. I was not impressed!

I use dental floss to cut the layers. Just take a piece of floss long enough to cut through entire cake, hold taunt and zig zag through the layer. Works great!

LOVED the original photo on this recipe so I stolen their decor idea!  Doubled the frosting recipe (less the unsweetened chocolate - didnt have)  Made cupcakes instead of a cake.  Filled cupcake with a small amount of frosting (impossible to layer, i think)  Frosted sides of cupcake and rolled in crushed pecans, topped with more frosting.  *I will  crush the pecans into a finer dust next time.*   Everybody loved loved loved!  I also made a yellow cake batter cupcake, and those turned out just as good as the chocolate!  NOTE: I tasted both the finished product of yellow & choc.  Personally, I thought the dark choc was too strong.  Tasted mostly dark choc & almost no frosting -and I heavily frosted them. Yet my mom who LOVES dark choc LOVED them.  Took them home!  I guess if you love dark choc, use dark choc.  If you arent a fan of dark choc, use a milk choc or a choc fudge recipe? Just saying :)

Great frosting recipe!  Whole family loved it.  I used the "dark chocolate cake 1" recipe on the AR site and it made the cake even better.  A bit more effort to not use a boxed cake mix but so worth it.  Even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an amazing recipe! I doubled the amount of icing and used it with the "Dark Chocolate Cake I" recipe off this site and it looked really yummy! Although, the finished product I have not tasted since I sent it off with a friend for a party! The icing was delicious and I would absolutely recommend using fruit in the layers. I sliced up strawberries for the top and then grated chocolate on top! Yummy! I hope some comes back for me to try (I just didn't think it would look good if there was a slice missing!=)

used the frosting on "too much chocolate cake" recipe on site. cut the cake rounds in half horizontally then layered with frosting and sliced strawberries to make a monstrously rich, amazing 4 layered behemoth of a cake that was SO good even my boyfriend's friends (who hate me with a passion) couldn't help but compliment it :)

Looks impressive, is easy to make (as cakes go), tastes very good.  Based on all the reviews, I increased the filling (all I did was use 1 1/2 whipping cream, kept the rest the same) and that amount was just right.  Also, instead of a boxed mix, I used the SUPER EASY "Black Magic Cake" from this site - it's a moist, dark, one-bowl chocolate cake that's as easy as a mix, in my opinion.  (B/c it's soft, I was VERY careful cutting it.  In fact, I messed up the first time and my layers fell apart so I re-made the cake with success, used a bread knife and went very slowly cutting!)

I loved this filling/frosting for a boxed dark chocolate cake that I made. I substituted 1/3 cup Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar, and it tasted great.

This is wonderful! I made it for my mom's birthday, and everyone loved it. I did make a couple of changes. I am not a fan of dark chocolate, so I used a Devil's Food cake mix. I also doubled the filling.(I ended up using most of it)On each layer I sprinkled Heath toffee bits. I would also recommend purchasing a Wilton cake slicer. It is inexpensive, and a huge help in making the layers perfect! ...Also, I was only able to refrigerate for three hours.

I'm surprised any of the frosting made it onto the cake - it was so good I found myself eating it before even frosting the cake!!!  I took this to work, and it was a hit.  Very tasty, and very pretty.

Absolutely delicious! This went on top of the Dark Chocolate Cake I (the ONLY choc cake recipe I'll ever use!) for my birthday cake. Super creamy, like a slightly cheesy fudge. Delish! Even my parents, who hate frostings, ate the whole thing. The portion size was enough for me, I made a double recipe after reading reviews, but ended up using less than half of it to frost between layers and cover an 8" cake.

I have to admit - I haven't made this myself (yet!) - but my friend did and it was INCREDIBLE!  She used three layers instead of four and said it was so simple.  I will do the same and use the final layer as a crumble to decorate the top of that delicious frosting!!!

Can I give this recipe a 10?  Fantastic, our church had a catered dinner for our sweetheart banquet, and she had made this cake, this is so similar, I can barely tell the difference.  It is divine!

I have but 3 words for this recipe...Yum, Yum, & YUM!!  This was soooo good!  I made it for Christmas & it got rave reviews.  It tastes like a desert you'd get at a restaurant, yet it is so incredible easy to make.  The filling is just delicious!  The only thing I would do differently is that I would make double the amount of filling, as it would have been nice to use it as frosting for the outside of the cake for a finished look.  My grandmother doesn't particularly like chocolate, so I'm going to try this recipe with a yellow cake, and maybe some sliced strawberries & bananas layered with the filling.  Thanks Erika!

This recipe came out great, it was easy and delicious. Following the advice of another reviewer, I doubled the ingredients for the frosting. Because I used apple sauce instead of oil for the cake, it came out really REALLY moist, which is delicious and healthier for you, but also presents issues when frosting. Granted, I am no expert cake maker, but even after refrigerating the cakes overnight, they were super crumbly when frosted, which I think necessitates large quantities of frosting. And the frosting is the best part of this cake so I think you should slap on a lot of it in any case! I had a lot of frosting left over, so I would recommend increasing the icing ingredients by half rather than double. Totally delicious!

This is good for a simple cake mix.  The icing is what makes the dessert.  I am not a baker nor a cake eater, but it turned out good for my wife's family who loves dessert.

Nice light cake but I'm looking for something with stronger flavor, especially in the cream filling. This was a little flat for me.

Perfect. i didn't actually make the four layers, as said to do, but i did make a two layer cake, and found that since there weren't as many layers to "fill", the icing didn't go on as skimpily, and there was actually enough icing to cover the exterior of the cake using the original recipe. i also used walnuts in between layers and on top instead of chocolate shavings. i brought this cake to the thanksgiving potluck at my school and it was one of the first desserts finished. :)

This was a pretty good cake!  I used devil's food cake and (based on others suggestions) I made 1.5 the filling.  To me, it still felt a bit skimpy between layers, so I will double the original filling amount next time.  I also used Cadbury's Dairy Milk shavings on top instead of unsweetened chocolate.

The cake was OK, but not really that impressive.  I didn't think the icing had much flavor, and it just seemed greasy to me.  Overall, I thought it just tasted like any old chocolate cake.  The people I served it too seemed to enjoy it, but I don't think they were crazy about it either.  It did look very nice though, as I covered it in chocolate curls that I made from one of those oversized special dark bars.

Loved this recipe and would make it again, instead of using a cake mix I made the chocolate cake recipe called deep dark chocolate cake. Both recipes are excellent and everyone wanted a second piece. Will make this again. thanks, Cookiewhiz

This is an elegant looking cake that tastes delicious.  
It is not too sweet, but very tasty.  It looks like you made a real fuss, but
it is extremely easy!  My husband proclaimed it a "must make!"

OMG! This was so delicious. I also used the dark chocolate cake 1 recipe. I did not reduce the ingredients for that but just poured the batter into 2 9 inch rounds vs 3 and added 10 minutes to the cooking time. This allowed for larger cakes to slice in half - it made the cutting easier and the layers were not too thick. I make a double batch of frosting exactly as directed. I added thinly sliced almonds to top it off. It came out amazing. I will make this time and time again.

This was very good--made it for Easter and everyone loved it.  The icing is a nice change from the normal icing I make.  I did sub cool whip for the whipping cream and it was fine--I used about a half of a container.

I made this cake for a special occaision, and thought it was wonderful.  As others have mentioned, the recipe only makes enough frosting to cover the top of each layer and not the sides of the cake, but I thought it was an elegant look.  I also agree that the cake is delicious on the first day...even better on the second. Yum!  This is a very delicious, very simple recipe.  I will definately make it again.
