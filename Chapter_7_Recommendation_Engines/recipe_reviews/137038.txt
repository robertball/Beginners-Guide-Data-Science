Instead of preserves, I used some lemon curd that I made earlier in the week and used lemon extract instead of vanilla for the glaze.  My lemon curd spread out over the roll, so be sure to make your indentation deep enough to avoid that.  The cream cheese filling is really yummy.  The roll's texture is heavier than a flaky bakery danish, but the flavor is as good.

Extremely easy for a beginner and amazingly GOOD! I used the same triangles that come in the cans (16 total/ 8 per can), filled them with the cream cheese and rolled them like crescent rolls and they baked fantastic!! Soft and buttery and...oh! so good! My husband would have preferred a sweeter glaze (more powdered sugar). I think next time I would prefer almond extract in the glaze instead of vanilla.  I felt like a pastry chef!

I have made these twice now.  I would suggest reducing the cream cheese mixture by about 25% (so 6 oz (3/4 brick) cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tsp lemon juice) and adding about 2 T jam to the mix (still put some on top).  I made it as instructed the first time and thought that it was way too cream cheesy, and the filling exploded.  With less cream cheese filling and some of the fruit flavor mixed in, they came out much better.

Excellent.  Excellent.  I made according to recipe and the cheese filling was so good.  Very easy to make.  I used some raspberry and strawberry jam.  I added more after they were done baking as the jam had reduced quiet a bit.  I left two as is but i think they look better when you make the wells even if you just add some of the cheese filling to the middle.  Do not eat fresh out of the oven. But make sure to drizzle with glaze while still hot.  I made them the night before and had them for breakfast, they were perfect then.   These tasted like professional bakery bought Danishes.

I did the same thing the other reviewer did, I just filled them and then rolled them like a normal crescent roll, but I tucked the sides together more tightly.  One thing, I thought there was way too much cream cheese mixture.  I had SO much extra that I used it as frosting on a cake I had made earlier.  I also used some apple filling in some of them, and semi-sweet chocolate chips in some, too.  They were pretty good, and very easy.

I used lemon curd instead of fruit preserves. We didn't care for them. I don't feel like the crescent dough is transformed enough in this recipe

These were good, but I need to bake them longer because the insides were not quite done.

These have been a huge hit at home and at work. I have done them with strawberry jam and apple jelly with cinnamon mixed in the cream cheese mixture. Both turned out great! I did have a little extra cream cheese filling left over, but I also overstuffed the pastries a little too much... they were still a big hit thou!

These were very quck and easy to make. I made a half a recipe, so I only made 4 rolls. I should have sealed them better, because the filling oozed out a little. They were done in 15 minutes, but my oven bakes quickly. Good recipe.

We thought these were good----and very easy, too!  I made them as single pieces rather than the double triangles.  I put about 2 teaspoons of the filling from almost the large end to about 1 1/2 inches from the pointed end and then about 1/2 teaspoon of Smucker's jam on top before rolling.  I smushed up the ends to try to keep the filling inside, which didn't quite work (but I loved mopping up the part that spilled onto the parchment paper).  These baked for 18 minutes.  For the glaze I used a little lemon flavoring.  This would be an easy recipe for beginners (think kids).  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy yums!!! These were SO good! I made half of the recipe using Solo brand apricot filling (I LOVE Solo). They were super easy to roll and shape. They looked gorgeous and tasted absolutely great.

EXCELLENT!  This is a recipe to write home about!  I found it to be perfect.  No changes were made or are necessary.  Thank you Pillsbury!  UPDATE:  I made these using cherry pie filling this time and they were oh so good!

These were so delicious! I'm going to take another reviewer's suggestion and use almond extract next time instead of vanilla, and use less cream cheese in the filling. Highly recommend this!

so, so easy - if I can - you can - mixture made way too much filling, so you may be able to cut back - I made 48 danish and could of made 48 more.  I concur with other review, I only added 1 tsp of filling per crescent roll and it was more than enough and I used almond extract for glaze..amazing - I also used peach and apple pie filling for topping - rave reviews from family and friends - enjoy
