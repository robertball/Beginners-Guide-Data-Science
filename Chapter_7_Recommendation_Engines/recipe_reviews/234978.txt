I try not to be one of those people who changes a recipe, then rates it, but when it comes to baking, I can't help but try to "healthify" it as much as I can, using simple substitutions.
I feel this recipe as-written, is fantastic, reliable, and versatile, therefore I give it 4 stars.
My healthified substitutions:
1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup brown sugar, only 1/4 cup of white sugar
1/4 cup coconut oil, and 1/2 cup organic unsweet applesauce instead of veg oil.
Pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had.

THEN I WENT AND UN-HEALTHIFIED IT! YAY!
I made a streusel topping out of crushed biscoff cookies from the Tastebook.com post: "Biscoff Banana Bread with Biscoff Cookie Streusel"
And I drizzled it with some melted caramels... 

These things are so moist! I probably could have let them bake another couple minutes (I did about 23) but still tasty!

These are what I think of when I think of apple muffins. Perfect amount of moistness and the top bakes up crisp. Glad I tried this one. It's a keeper.

These are perfect EXCEPT that my first batch, at 400 degrees,  was dark brown and dry. Turned down to 350, next batch was wonderful. I used half brown sugar, half white. 2 cups of chopped Granny Smiths worked well. Texture of these muffins is great!

I've made this twice now - once as muffins and once as a cake, and both times it was very enjoyable.  I thought it would be dry because the mixture prior to baking is very thick, but i guess the moisture from the apples help it out.  Very enjoyable!

Toddler (and adult!) approved. I have sweet organic apples so changed the sugar to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 brown. I left the skin on the apples and swapped grape seed oil for vegetable oil with no problem. These are really delish! It seemed like there were too many apples and not enough batter at first but they baked up great. I used a mini muffin tin and baked for about 14 minutes. This one is a keeper.

This is a wonderful little muffin that is perfect with your morning cup of coffee.  Itâ€™s not too sweet, and biting into the little chunks of apple is delightful. I sprinkled sugar on the top to add a little jazz.  I made half the recipe resulting in 8 muffins.

These muffins are a five for taste, but I'm glad I read the reviews first. The oven temp I used was 375 and 20 - 25 minutes for regular sized muffin tins. It was a very thick batter that needed to be tapped down in the tin before baking. A cup measure of apples would have been better as even Mac's can vary in size. Taking these minor things aside it's a recipe worth saving.

Disappointed.... I followed the recipe exactly. The muffin was dry and slightly bland.  The only flavor is the cooked apples which is what salvages this and why I gave it 2 stars.  Sorry, but this was not good.

Decided last night I would whip together some apple muffins, since I have a bag of apples I need to use up.  Tried this easy recipe and was so happy I did.  Muffins were so moist and tasty, we did not eat fresh, we decided to have them for breakfast this morning with coffee.  Wow so delicious! A definite do-over!

My husband loved these! Nice and moist! The only change I made was reducing the sugar (used sucanat) to 3/4 cup. I would reduce it to a 1/2 cup next time.

Great breakfast muffin!  I only used half the sugar and substituted applesauce for half the oil and they were plenty sweet.  The kids loved them and they were a great way to use up apples we had bought that were a bit tart for just eating.  This is definitely a recipe that would be best with crisp tart apples rather than softer apples.

Yes I made a double batch . I did tweak the sugar down 1/4 cup and upped the cinnamon  another tsp. I didn't have walnuts in so I used pecans, no problem  either is good 
I baked both 12 muffin pans together  at  375 15 min than lowered  it to 350 for 5 min they came out delicious! It's a keeper. I used granny Smith and some other apples .   Big chunks. Nice mix!

I really liked this recipe. I will definitely make it again.  I followed the instructions for most of it. I used pink lady apples as that is what I had (3 of them) and instead of cinnamon I used ground clove.  I was out of cinnamon so I used what I had on hand.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good they turned out with the clove instead.  I did adjust the temp to 350 instead of 400 and I baked them for 20 min, but I think 15 min would of been fine too.  I also ended up with 20 muffins instead of 12.  This usually happens though as I filled the muffin cups 2/3 full.

Had to reduce the cooking time a little.  Used apples from my tree and no idea what they are.
Making them again now and a friend asked for the recipe.  Which i gave her.

I added some nutmeg as well as cinnamon ,  I shredded my 2 larger apples instead of  chopping them,  as it saved me a lot of time. They are really good snack for before and after sports . I recommend!

These muffins are delicious!!!!  Soft and fluffy texture, and the taste of apple crisp.  They are so moist that not a single crumb drops.  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed.  I also added 1/4 t. nutmeg.  I used about  3 1/2 cups "eating" apples I had that needed to be used.  I diced them rather small, but coarsely.  They baked up REALLY nice!  I baked them for about 23 minutes, and I did use paper liners.  The batter was strange, sticky too.  As I filled the cups I really thought there were too many apples.  As soon as they came out, I sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on top.  Great for dessert with a glass of cold milk, or for breakfast with coffee!

I liked it and so did my husband. The batter was thick, but it turned out really well. I was scared about how many apples were in it (3 large), but it could have handled more!

I loved them!  I made them twice in two days . I always vary the spice to my taste:  I added a little nutmeg. Also, these muffins can handle quite a few apples.  I needed to get rid of some Golden Delicious apples, so I added 4 apples per recipe.

Liked that it used a lot of my picked apples (I used 3 cups chopped), I left them in a bit too long because the tops didn't look done and they came out a bit dry (I don't make recipes based on comments, I make them based on the recipe).  Otherwise good but nothing I'm absolutely wild about.

Very easy to make these muffins with my daughter.  We added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (because we add chocolate chips to all of our muffins and breads!) and everyone in the house enjoyed these muffins.

Make these all the time opting out the walnuts and adding a streusel topping! They make a great grab and go breakfast if you're running late in the morning.

Did not have any vanilla extract so used coconut extract instead. Husband had 2 while still warm so must have been good. Will see how ladies like tomorrow

I put these muffins in for 20min at 400 and the bottoms burnt, if you plan on making them I would suggest 350.  I didn't find them moist at all, that could be because they were over cooked, but they were very dry with an unusual texture. These were more like a large cookie than a muffin, very sweet. We didn't like them at all, I can usually adjust a recipe to my liking, I wouldn't even bother with this one.

Very tasty- a big hit with the kids. I used 3 Sundance apples that we picked the day before. It made 18 muffins. Did not use walnuts but think they would be a great addition to the mix.

Just made em, very good! I used the apples I had on hand-2Honeycrisp & a Granny Smith-otherwise followed recipe. Bake time in my oven was 23 mns-1st batch I baked for 20-baked thru but lacking that nice, browned top. Tomorrow they will go to work w/the hubby-USCG-I'm sure they will be Coast Guard approved!

I was super excited about this recipe because I had bananas and apples and gathered all the ingredients, chopped the apples, and mashed the bananas and set to work.
Then I saw "self rising flour."  Huh? who buys that stuff? So I found how to make self rising flour and did so, but to my extreme disappointment, the muffins "fell," they were completely mushy on the inside. 
If the recipe has just called for flour and baking powder, I bet I'd be having a muffin with my coffee this morning.

Really easy to make. I made 14 muffins with these ingredients and I baked them about 25 minutes. They taste amazing, they are ideal for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Highly reccomended recipe.

I made these today, and have to say they were wonderful!  I did follow the advice of several other reviewers and made a few adjustments. I cut the white sugar in half and put 1/2 a cup of brown sugar in too.  I only used 2 apples instead of 3, since mine were on the bigger side.  I also reduced the cooking temp to 350 and baked them for 22 minutes.  And I added a streusel crumble topping to them.  They turned out so awesome that I don't have any to take a picture of!

APPROVED!  My parents and boyfriends approve 100%.  I found this recipe 2 days ago, and have made several batches (too many apple trees, not enough time).  Because the batter is very dry, I add 1/4 cup of water and load it FULL of apple chunks.  For variations, I have added brown sugar, raisins or dried cherries to some of the batches. Also works with whole wheat flour and reduced sugar (running low on supplies while baking). Will continue to make!

I love baking, and so I decided to give this recipe a try. The muffins turned out AMAZING. They were very moist and delicious. These muffins are actually the best muffins I have ever made. Would definitely make these again

I made these muffins substituting half the flour with whole wheat flour and they were excellent. Next time I make them I will use only whole wheat flour.

So good! Not too sweet, but just the perfect amount of cinnamon. I left mine in the oven for 19 min. Maybe even a minute or two less and they would have been slightly more moist.

Delicious! My family thought I was awesome! I tried it with dehydrated apples and it turned out perfect. I tried some using a mini muffin pan and reduced the time to 15 minutes. Excellent size for a quick snack.
