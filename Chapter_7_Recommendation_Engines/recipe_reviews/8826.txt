This recipe has the potential to be a good one, but the wine sauce was thin and strongly tasted of wine.  You could not taste anything else but the wine.  Next time, I will replace most of the wine with chicken stock and thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch or flour.

Good stuff! Everything went well as I was preparing this recipe. Step #3 says to pour out remaining bacon fat...I didn't have any left over. Actually I had to add a tablespoon of evoo to finish frying my chicken (no big deal). Then before I added the spinach I put 1 T of butter in the pan and sauted 2 big cloves of garlic. Then I immediately added the "wine" (I used chicken broth instead because I didn't have any wine)and the spinach. I used a whole bag of baby spinach and it was the right amount. My husband liked it, my 3 little girls liked it (5 year old kept asking for more cilantro (spinach!) with her chicken!) and I liked it. The sauce is very thin (no big deal to me). I can't wait to email the recipe to my sisters and mother-in-law! Thanks for another great one!

I used cream of chicken soup in lieu of heavy cream, but this recipe was wonderful!

My whole family loved this.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  Only changes I made were seasoning the flour with salt, pepper and paprika and using half & half instead of cream.  Thickened sauce with a little Wondra in water.  I may use double the spinach next time, as we all love spinach.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This was a 5 star with the following changes: added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour, and minced garlic and chopped green onions to the pan just before adding the wine. Also cooked the sauce uncovered to help thicken.

This was really, really good! I used cream of chicken instead of the heavy cream and it seems to have turned out fine. I also used turkey bacon, and possibly because of that didn't have any extra bacon grease with which to cook the chicken--no big deal, just added some olive oil. My only suggestion is that you don't have to use that much flour--one cup or one and a half cups would have been enough for the amount of chicken given. I also added some garlic and salt and pepper to the flour before coating the chicken. I served it with green beans, parmesan-garlic roasted potatoes and the rest of the bottle of Chardonnay I used to cook with. I think I might try this again with potatoes instead of chicken, and use it as a side dish and serve with roasted chicken.

This was wonderful!  Never mind the fact that I took the chicken out of the pan, put it on paper towels, went out to throw away trash and came back in to find that the dog had counter surfed and eaten one of our chickens!  We ended up splitting the remaining piece, but it was wonderful!  I topped with tomato slices and parm cheese when I put them back into the pan, and our only complaint was against the klepto dog!  I'll certainly make this again and again.

It actually took a little longer than I anticipated, but I was doing other things at the same time, so that could be why. Anyway, it was very good- my entire family loved it. I also added a can of mushrooms to it. I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 milk instead of the heavy cream(I do this in all recipes that call for cream). Very good! I made campanelle and mixed it all together.

Normally I avoid anything with heavy cream AND bacon, but I had both on hand and gave this a try.  How can you go wrong with this combination of ingrediants?  This is a fabulous recipe (I used a pinot gregio)!  It is so fast, so easy, and so delicious.  As for the ugly duckling - it really didn't look that bad, just make sure you don't cook the spinach to death.  Thanks, Kris!

I recommend using wine and not chicken broth for the ultimate results.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and wouldn't make any changes.  The recipe does make a lot of sauce which is not thick, but we found it perfect with the rice. Thanks for sharing.

The recipe, in theory, has some potential.  As written, however, it suffers from poor instruction as to execution of the dish as well as a sore lack of seasoning.  I cooked it in a way that made sense to me (still convoluted so I won't document it here) and added garlic, seasoning similar to steak seasoning, and mushrooms. Definitely not a recipe one could rely on with confidence if followed exactly as directed.

This was really delicious!  I did make some changes though... I used chicken stock instead of wine and chopped frozen spinach.  I also added Parmesan cheese and mixed the cream and spinach together and let in simmer before adding the chicken.  My husband raved about it!  I will for sure make this again.

Loved it!  Made some changes.  I pounded the chicken breasts and sauted them whole.  I also added seasoning to the flour.  Garlic salt and pepper.  Also seasoned the chicken with garlic salt.  I used pre-cooked bacon in the microwave and then sauted the chicken in oil/butter.  Took out the chicken, sauted fresh garlic, added the wine, spinach, then cream, and also added some parmesan cheese.  I let it cook down and thicken, and I needed to add in more wine.  Then added back the chicken, topped with bacon and tossed in 3/4 pound of cooked thin spaghetti.  Tasted like something you would find at Olive Garden!  Everyone loved it.

this was really pretty good!!!  I used italian breadcrumbs instead of flour. Did add a little bit of EVOO to the bacon grease.  I'm thinking next time I'll add some sun dried tomatoes.

This dish was fantastic! Easy to make and a big hit with family. To get 5 stars, I would thicken up the sauce as it is too thin; more soupy than a sauce.

This is delicious! I did use creative license and changed it a good bit, but it is a great base recipe. Instead of using wine and cream, I used the sparce bit of bacon drippings and a tablespoon or so of margarine and a couple of tablespoons of flour to make a roux. To that, instead of cream, I added about 2 cups of 2% milk. This made a creamy sauce, to which I then added a tblspn. of chopped garlic and one bag of spinach and the chicken.  It turned out absolutely delicious! Served it with a side of rigatoni with roasted red peppers, steamed broccoli, garlic and parm. cheese. Good enough for company, for sure!

Made this but with some changes.  I boiled chicken breast first not over boiling.  Cut bacon into small pieces and cooked it. Got chicken breast cut into pieces and put them into pan with a bit of bacon grease to fry breast just a bit then added bacon continue cooking added a bit of garlic salt, wine, spinach and since I didn't have heavy cream used cream of chicken.  This changes made an awesome meal.  My kids and family loved it.  Very easy to make and will be in my menu very soon again.

We love this recipe at our house. Last time I simply used left over baked chicken, crumbled crispy bacon on top of everyones helping and a bit of parmesan as suggested by someone earlier. It's always a big hit!

Great idea, but needs help.  The flavors are wonderful together, but the execution is why it doesn't present well.  Remove wilted spinach from pan, add wine - try extra dry Vermouth btw, and then add cream OR substitute non-fat liquid cream substitute (Land-O-Lakes) that's been mixed with 2 tbsp of corn starch to thicken it.  Arrange chicken on platter with spinach on top and then pour sauce over all.  This recipe also benefits greatly from some onion being between removal of spinach and addition of wine.  Also, try a small amount of grated swiss cheese, about 1/4 cup or less, to top of the finished result.

This is a great idea. I was in a hurry and just used a can of alfredo sauce instead of the cream.  I forgot to add the wine but it tasted ok - next time I will try the wine.  I also added some paprika and garlic salt to the sauce.  Since I was in a hurry, I boiled and cut up the chicken, microwaved the bacon and threw it all together with some mini-bowtie pasta and served the spinach on the side.  It passed my picky kids & husband test!

This was absolutely delicious and a HUGE hit with my family.  I sauteed mushrooms and garlic in EVOO and set aside before the bacon.  I, too, added garlic salt and pepper to the flour mixture.  I also cooked it without the lid at the end, then put the lid on and turned off the burner to allow it to 'set' for about 10 minutes.  This is a definite KEEPER!

I made this last night, with only minor technical changes, and my partner and I both loved it.  I added spices to the flour (garlic powder, italian herb seasoning, salt, pepper) and left the chicken breasts whole, cooked them a little bit longer.  I reduced the wine with the spinach, added the cream, and then threw in the chicken breasts and bacon at the last to heat up.  Looked and tasted fabulous!

I love chicken and I love bacon and spinach, but the calories and fat make me wonder about this one because I love my heart too.  I will probably try this one but without the bacon fat and dredging in the flour.  It will save some calories and fat by using chicken broth and evaporated milk with a cornstarch thickner.  I want more seasoning, add some garlic, onion and a little salt and pepper.

This recipe was very very good.  I'm giving it four stars since I did make a few changes to kick up the flavor.  I added 3/4 of an onion, 4 cloves of garlic and substituted chicken broth for the wine.  My husband went back for seconds and said it was "Lip smackin' good!"  We will definately make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Was this recipe ever delicious!  My husband was scraping the pot and he doesn't even like chicken normally!  I used Pinot Grigio for the wine and frozen spinach instead of fresh.  I want to make this one again!

Thanks, Kris! My husband wants me to keep this recipe, which I'm happy to do as it's easy and flavorful. My "bunch of spinach" was two bags of prewashed--took a little stuffing into the pan initially, but then it cooked right down into a nice amount, and I used the chicken thighs on hand. BTW, we also didn't have extra grease to pour off. The wine, sadly, was just old cooking wine because everything else disappears around here and I don't have it when I need it, but in your recipe it worked well. Thanks very much for "Kris's Spinach and Bacon Chicken."

As written, very bland.   Jazz it up a little with some onions, garlic, salt and pepper and top with Parmesan cheese and it becomes an excellent dish.

My famiy loves this.  Great flavor, yummy meal.  It takes a little longer to make than what I usually prefer (because you have to "babysit" it on the stove... can't just put it in the oven and wait for it to bake), but it is worth the effort.

So good! I only altered two things - I used a whole bag of prewashed baby spinach and added salt and pepper at the end. Perfecto! 

Note: I'm not the greatest cook, so if I could pull this one off, anyone can!

That was good and relatively easy (better if you pre-cook the bacon at breakfast to streamline dinner time) - a little parmesan cheese sprinkled over everything at the end was a nice touch.

I like this recipe and will make it again. However the picture gave me the idea to make it into a pasta dish so that's what I did. I cut the bacon up before frying. I also wilted the spinach in a different pan because I wanted to use the bacon grease to fry the chicken which added unbelievable flavor! I also chose to add some minced garlic at this point and cooked it at the tail end of the bacon. I cut the chix in pieces and then put flour and seasonings in a plastic bag, dumped all the chix in there and just shook it until coated. When I laid the chix in the bacon grease I had to add some olive oil as there wasn’t even of the bacon grease left over. I took the chix out when done and covered. Then I added the wine scrapping up any pieces, added the wilted spinach and heavy cream. Then I added all that (along with the chix I had set aside earlier) to cooked pasta. Delicious! I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because while it was an excellent recipe I felt I really had to doctor it up to bring out more flavor.

This was good, just not exceptional. I have learned to read reviews before making a dish on this site, but I didn't have time this time. I wish I had, because I definitely would have reduced the wine, using half chicken broth instead. The wine flavor is very strong.I also agree the sauce is a bit thin. I served it over angel hair pasta and it was pretty soupy. I also added a little garlic. If I had had mushrooms, would have added those too as they would certainly complement this dish. This reminded me of something I would have ordered at the Olive Garden. A good way to use chicken that's not totally boring.

We loved this and couldn't get enough!!  I tossed the whole thing with angel hair pasta and let it sit off of the burner for a few minutes before I served it and the sauce thickened quite nicely!  I used a Riesling wine (which I had open already) which gave it a sweet flavor and due to a defrosting mixup only 2 chicken breasts instead of 4, cut into strips so there was plenty for the two of us.  The chicken itself was delicious and got a nice little crispiness to it, so I left it out until the last possible minute so it wouldn't get too soggy.  It really had a light taste considering the ingredients (especially since I didn't have enough bacon grease in the pan so I added butter to cook the chicken, eek!), and next time I may omit the bacon altogether.  It was tasty, but wasn't necessary.  I was told I need to make this all the time!!

I made this recipe just as it is, and it was fantastic!! My husband loved it and I will certainly have it once again. My only issue was that I couldn't figure out the best way to serve it. I'll have to give it some thought. We had it with green beans and rice and it was perfect!

This was a RAVE at our house! DH loved it so much he seconds and thirds!  I tweaked, like everyone else.  I put the flour in a zipper top bag and added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Mrs. Dash.  Then tossed in the chicken to coat. 
I used real bacon bits, and olive oil to saute the chicken.  Didn't have a full cup of wine, but filled up the rest with chicken broth.  Used the suggestion of another reviewer to mix sour cream and milk for the heavy cream, which worked well.  Served w/egg noodles since we were out of rice. 

Thanks for the recipe--we'll add it to our regular rotation!

i cooked this recipe pretty much to the letter for my husband (i'm a vegetarian so i cannot taste along the way) and his complaint was the spinach came out too tough. i didn't cook it very long so i think maybe if it was steamed and added to the dish upon serving?
he also found it , despite his love of bacon, a bit on the bland side overall.
I will not make this dish again. 
Thanks for posting it anyway.

I just have to say that I did a variation: cut the bacon into little strips and fried it, drained the bacon; used chicken thighs, cut into strips, added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to the flour before dredging the chicken. I usually keep a Tupperware of bacon fat and used that to fry the chicken, drained on paper towel; added a splash of white cooking wine, because that's all I had to a bit more bacon fat and added the spinach to wilt; now...I skipped the cream and promise to make it next time, but I already had a jar of Bertolli's Garlic Alfredo sauce with aged cheese, and figured that this creamy sauce could be the "short cut".  And it was a great one! Served it on rotellini pasta.

Really?  I had high hopes for this one, sadly, I was disappointed.  You would think all these ingredients would come together well, but they just don't in this recipe.  Try Chicken Carbonnara from this site, way better.

This recipe is great.  The only thing that I changed was to add some salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese.
The sauce was a little thin but, after simmering for a short time, it thickened and was perfect to serrve over rice.

A really great starting point.  I added half of a medium sized onion while the bacon was about half cooked, and mushrooms a short while after that.  Used reduced sodium chicken broth, and only a splash or so of heavy cream.  Then thickened the sauce with a slurry of corn starch and broth.  And cracked black pepper.

I prepare this for lunch today. The recipe is good, but it needs a little work. I read the reviews so I decided to use chicken broth instead of white wine. The result was the sauce was in need of something else. I will add 1 tablespoon of cherry next time. I think the bacon bites do not mix well with the texture of the dish. My husband thinks the same. I will skip it next time. The resulting sauce is too thin. I recommend adding a little more flour to thick it. I had no problem with the presentation. It was beautiful. But I need to work a little bit in the flavor. I think with the extra cherry it will be a winner. My daughter loved it (and she is a though reviewer), except for the bacon bites.

A good meal best served over rice. I used one can of chicken broth instead of wine, some refrigerated bacon bits instead of bacon, and 10 oz frozen spinach. 10 oz was too much; 3-5 oz would have been plenty. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.

This was wonderful. I didn't have any wine or chicken broth so I just added my milk and sour cream with the spinach. Excellent!

This recipe is SO easy and delicious.  I prepared this dish for my girlfriend tonight because we had been wanting to try it for the last week.  Bacon? Heavy cream?  What else is there in life, really?  That being said this recipe is surprisingly delicate.  It may be too bland for you if you are the type of person who is used to or prefers a lot of salt or other seasonings in your food.  My girlfriend didn't like this at all.  She thought it was too bland. The word bacon alone makes most of us think yummy, greasy flavor. There really isn't that much bacon in the recipe and i think it adds just the right touch of guilt.  I served this dish over penne pasta and I will definitely make it again but not for my girlfriend!

Yummo!!! The only changes I made was that I added 1 1/2 cups of sliced mushrooms and used Marsala instead of white wine. So good! Will make it a regular at my house now. Even my boys, ages 7 and 21 months ate seconds!!

Flavor was good but sauce was a bit runny.  Maybe I didn't add enough spinach. Added rice to thicken.

I'm sure it is delicious as it is, however, I am following a Keto diet so I changed it up a bit so I could eat it too! 
I used chicken broth instead of wine. I replaced the heavy cream with sour cream. I added shredded cheese to help with thickening. I increased the amount of spinach just based on what other reviews said. (glad I did) Oh, and I also added some Greek seasoning. I served it over noodles for the family. While I enjoyed mine in a bowl. Absolutely delicious!!!!

I'm giving it 4 stars based on what I think it would be if I had followed directions exactly. I use turkey bacon and cook it in the microwave so I didn't have any bacon fat to cook the chicken in. I used olive oil instead. Whoever thinks 2 cups is the right amount of flour is nuts. I didn't even use 1 cup, more like 3/4. I used almond milk instead of cream, so what I ate was not nearly as good as what it would have been had I used heavy cream. But I try to be healthy so I'm willing to skimp on taste.

Delicious.  I put a bed of cooked egg noodles in a casserole, covered wit a thick layer of wilted spinach with cooked chicken pieces on top, then poured sauce and bacon and sauce over it and heated in 350 oven for 15 minutes.  Add some chopped green onions on top before serving.  Next time I would like to try it with chicken thighs.

I didn't use cream, I had a partial jar of alfredo sauce to use up. I also added a couple tbs of tomato bruschetta that added a nice flavor. My husband loved it, but thought it could have used less bacon, those bites were too salty.  we will make again.

It was a tasty recipe. Given that it was a little "saucy", it might go well on top of a pasta, such as fettuccini, or linguini. Also, the next time we make this recipe, we are going to double the amount of bacon it calls for. It just did not seem to be enough on it when we served it.

Grteat recipe.  We ate this the first night and it was really good, but then I had some leftovers the next day, and I couldn't get enough.  It's a good thing there was only a little left, or I would have really pigged on it.  Thanks!

This was easy and good! I made a few slight modifications. I cubed the chicken before dredging it in flour. I also found that 1 cup of wine was too much for me, I wanted a thicker sauce. Last substitution was that I used the new Philadelphia cooking cream instead of heavy cream. I served it with spaghetti noodles as well and it was d-lish!

This was VERY rich, VERY filling but wonderful!  I followed the recipe but was almost out of white cooking wine... so I compensated with what I had which happened to be rum (how hillbilly is that?!).  I had a dish similar to this at a rather upscale Italian Restaurant north of Chicago (minus the rum I'd imagine).  I have never been able to duplicate it exactly.  I think this recipe came really close but the sauce was a bit heavier - or maybe just more of it (thanks, Captain Morgan).  Seems it would be easy to adjust the recipe; lose the bacon, add garlic to the sauce etc.. All around great, easy recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly.I love all the ingredients in this recipe so I thought it would be great. It was terrible! I used real white wine (not cooking wine) Maybe I should have used cooking wine because the sauce tasted really bad, and cooking the chicken in the bacon grease made my house smell really bad. If I could give this recipe no stars I would.
