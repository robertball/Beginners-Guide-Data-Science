I made this dish as an appetizer for my girlfriend's parents and it was an absolute hit.  And her dad is Ecuadorian, so he's had his fair share of excellent ceviches and he exclaimed that this was one of the best ones he's ever had.  And it was very easy to prepare!

Excellent ceviche recipe - tangy, perfect amount of spice, great citrus kick, and easy to make too.  Love all the crunchy fresh veggies too.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have crawfish but had tilapia instead.  Very enjoyable!

This is good, but this is not ceviche at all. This is a little bit like shrimp cocktail, but without the jicama and the cucumber. This is not mexican food.
