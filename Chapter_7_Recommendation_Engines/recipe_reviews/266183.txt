This is very good!  I used a bit larger dish so my filling wasn't tall, but we will make this recipe again!

Very dry. 
You would be better off using pumpkin pie spice instead of the ginger, nutmeg and cloves. 
Will not make this again.

Loved this "crust"! I added 15 oz coconut milk from a carton, 1 Tsp cinnamon and subbed coconut sugar for Stevia in the filling.  It was a delicious pie for Thanksgiving. My husband LOVED it and my extended family wanted the recipe. Will definitely make it again and again. Thanks for sharing it!

Outstanding flavor which is aided by the Pecan crust.

this was so much better the next day.  i felt like it was a little heavy on the cloves. definitely needed some whipped topping. i added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used a store bought crust.  it helped with my craving for pumpkin pie at thanksgiving but was missing something texturally. either way thank you for the recipe
