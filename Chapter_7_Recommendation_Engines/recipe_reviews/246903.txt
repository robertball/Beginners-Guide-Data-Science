Easy recipe to throw together in a pinch. I used more rhubarb than indicated and more cinnamon, simply because I like both.  As expected, a microwave cake is a little more chewy than an oven baked cake but,hey, I wanted something sweet, fast and without fuss. That's what I got!  Sweet tooth satisfied lickedy split!

Easy to throw together but the 3 minute cooking time is way too much time unless you have a very low wattage microwave.  Most other recipes like this are 1 or 2 minutes max.   I made adjustments considering the power of my microwave and even using frozen rhubarb, 2 1/2 minutes was too long.  A pinch of baking powder also helps it to raise .

The cake rose beautifully in the microwave, but deflated very quickly making a tough, chewy cake.  This could be because my microwave runs higher than the submitter’s, or because it lacks a leavening agent.  The flavor was good though and worth adjusting for future bakes.  What I like about this cake is not only the ease in making this, but having a nice dessert during the summer that doesn’t need the use of an oven.
