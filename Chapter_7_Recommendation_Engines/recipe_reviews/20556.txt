Instead of making this a blender punch, I froze the limeade and lemonade concentrates, egg whites, sugar, and ice mixture in a pretty bundt pan lined with cling wrap and added thinly sliced lemon and lime slices throughout.  It made a lovely floating ring and we poured the Sprite around it.  The punch was a huge hit.

I prepared this receipe for the first time for 65 people. 
Not a drop was left and I am still receiving pats on the back for the
best punch at a Mexican Fiesta potluck.   The bad part is someone 
has to man the punch and operate the blender with each "batch".

This was a really fun punch to make and serve, and everyone loved it.  I made this recipe for a large party at work, and I fancied up the glasses with colored sugar crystals and a lime wedge.  I did make one deviation from the recipe:  I used a 2-liter of Sprite instead of carbonated water, and for the crushed ice, I bought it from my local Sonic.  The slush ice was perfect, but it melts QUICKLY!  Do not attempt this if you have to drive more than a few blocks!  : )  Thanks, Bea, for the recipe.  It was great.

I needed a non-alcoholic recipe for a bridal shower held at a church, but wanted it to taste like a real margarita.  This recipe is fantastic!  I followed the recipe as printed but froze it for 1.5 hours before serving.  Next time I serve this at a party, I will have one person designated as mixer, as it is so delicious everyone wants more.  I didn't try it, but would assume you could add a bit of Tequilla when mixing if you prefer alcohol.

I served these at a party where it was mostly adults but kids were present and I didn't want the liability of alcohol... I had nearly EVERYONE (adults) ask for the recipe and no one could believe that they were non-alcoholic...It was so refreshing...I was serving two different types of punch and I quadrupled this recipe and it was still the first one to be gone! I froze the concentrate mixture with the sugar and eggwhites and half of the crushed ice.  When I was ready to serve, I just put the frozen mixture in the punch bowl and added the other ingredients and stirred vigourously.  No need to use blender and it was still super frothy!

CROWD PLEASER! I make this the frozen way every time (in a bundt pan), and it never lasts more than an hour.  Kids & Adults LOVE it.  (Keep a small bottle of Jose Cuervo on hand for the adults - Yum!)

Went fast, next time I will double the recipe. I didn't use the bender or the egg whites. I had a pregnant lady on my guest list. Halved the sugar. I loved it and so did my guests.

Very good! I'm pregnant so I cant have the egg whites so I used 2 TBSP of a powdered egg white substitute instead. Turned out perfect! Can't wait to try this next summer with some tequilla! Not too sweet not too sour, just right. Yummy!

Oh my!  I found this VERY tart but the kids absolutely loved it!  Since sour is in, it is a total hit.  I've promised to put it on the kids' "we're having a party" menu for all time.

These were a super big hit! I followed the recipe exactly using a food processor to "crush" the ice....made a perfect consistency. I also used lemon-lime flavored seltzer.

i made this for a cinco de Mayo potluck at work  and skipped the egg whites as they just didn't sound good and cut the sugar down as that was way too much sugar. But the finished result was great. It tasted awesome and although I made double the amount, the punch bowl was soon empty!

Made this for the kids for Cinco de Mayo. I did leave out the egg whites, but made as written otherwise. The kids really liked it and said that they would ask for it again! Thanks for sharing. :)
