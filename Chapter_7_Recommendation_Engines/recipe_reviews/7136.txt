Absolutely wonderful! It was a huge hit at the holiday party I brought it to. However, I think 2 lbs. of cheese is WAY too much. I used one pound this time making it, but I think I could even go with 1/2-3/4 lb. next time. It was not too hard to make!

Wonderful flavor, but slightly bland.  Next time, I will place slices of ham on top of the cheese before rolling.  Also, be sure you place a cookie sheet under the cake pan, as the cheese oozed out of mine.

This bread is delicious.  I used 1 lb of muenster and that was plenty for my cheese-loving family.  Leftover slices were heat in the microwave for 30s to make yummy and melty.

I have been making this bread for years, and I love it.  It is a hit at pot lucks, too.  
1) I think it should be credited, it is from the Good Housekeeping Cookbook, mine was published in 1980. 
2) I use butter rather than margarine
3) Heat the milk and butter to 120-130 degrees.  "Very warm" is not descriptive enough.  An electronic temperature probe is excellent, it alarms when the temperature is reached so I don't have to stand there and watch it.
4) I too have tried 2 pounds of cheese and found it too much.  I use 1 pound.  
5) My recipe gives the oven temp as 375 degrees for one hour.

What an incredible tasting dish.  We absolutely loved it!  This recipe was very east to make and makes a huge loaf and will feed plenty of people.  We served it with marinara sauce as a dip.  What a great idea serving this for holiday parties.  We will definetly make this recipe again!

Delicioso! I made this with half the amount of cheese and it was still wonderfully cheesy. I also added some hot pepper flakes to the cheese/egg mixture for some added flavor!...if you like spice, this is a delicious addition. I also made this recipe a second time with shredded mozzarella cheese with added garlic and italian herbs...so good with italian food!

The BEST!  Rarely any left over, but if there is it reheats so easily.  Wonderful with tossed or fruit salad or served as appetizer.  I like to use 2 different cheeses or use up different pieces of whatever cheese is in the refrigerator.  Always great.

We did not care for this recipe. My kids love "stuffed crust" pizza and I was hoping for something similar but did not achieve it. It was very "doughy" tasting and I had a hard time getting the cheese to stay on the dough while rolling (I only used 1lb. cheese/which may be why it was more dough than cheese, but I cannot imagine having to fit 2lbs. of shredded cheese inside the dough).

The recipe is good, though I required a little more milk to bring together the dough and I agree that 2 lbs. of cheese is quite excessive. I imagine that the recipe may have mistakenly intended 2 cups of cheese.  I have used a half to three quarters of a pound with good results.

very pretty and original, perfect for a buffet. I was afraid to put too hot liquid on the yeast (I did it once and the yeast was killed and the bread flat), but it worked out beautifully. Easier than I thougth and no cheese oozing out at all.

This is great bread!  But while I used the required amount of cheese the first go round, I cut it in half the second time.  Also, I did not mix the egg in the cheese the second time (I forgot).  It still turned out fine.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!  I'm going to look for more by this author!  

It is requested at all our family functions!

I was a little skeptical about this while I was making it because my dough didn't seem to pull together well. I think I used too much flour - next time, I'll only use 3 cups or so.  Plus, the dough was too elastic to roll out to the correct measurements, so my loaf was a little small.  But it baked up wonderfully and tasted AWESOME.  It was gone in minutes at my New Years Eve party.  I'll definately make again, just with less flour.  Thanks!

Amazing!!! I added the full two pounds of cheese, (4 cups) along with some sliced ham. To get it all in there I made it 24x8" or so. Yummmm! I only used half a stick of butter, and I added some italian seasoning, garlic salt, black pepper and a bit of kosher salt to the top before baking, and it turned out perfectly. The bread was flavorful and the cheese was to die for. I will be making this over and over again and changing it up each time. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I’ve made this bread for more than 25 years using the Good Housekeeping Cookbook recipe. When I told my husband that people said 2 lbs of cheese is too much - cut it in half, he scoffed along with me. The cheese IS this bread. Jeez ! It’s been a deer hunting opener tradition for so long! With the recipe unchanged. I have noticed that now that I’m letting my Kitchen Aid mixer do the kneading, I use less flour allowing the dough the elasticity to hold the cheese. That said, some cheese usually leaks out into the middle during baking. And that is nummy too!

I prepared this dough at home, and then brought it with me to bake on our sailboat while we were racing one afternoon.  The smell coming out of the cabin was wonderful for everybody on the boat, and we ate the bread fresh and warm out of the oven.   It was wonderful.  Of course, food always tastes better outdoors after exercise, but  I think it would taste just as good indoors.  It made a beautiful loaf--looked impressive.

I made this as a sourdough bread. I did 3 cups of flour, 1 cup sourdough starter, 1/2 cup of milk, and a little over a pound of mozzarella. It turned out great! This will be my go to recipe in the future.

I've made this several times and it's always a huge hit.  I usually do a mixture of cheeses (muenster, mozzarella, cheddar, provolone) and I always add herbs too (otherwise I find it a little bland).  It is called FONDUE BREAD so I usually do 1.5-2#s of cheese for that crazy amount of goey melted cheese effect.  For the herbs, I sometimes to the cheese, sometimes to the dough.  I've usually always add red pepper flakes.  Then pick a few others -- thyme, basil, oregano & garlic, etc ... I always do the almond flowers too because it adds a good display vibe to the loaf for parties.  Never any leftovers!!

FYI I tried this with a mix of shredded cheese of cheddar and a few other cheeses because that's what I had on hand, and while it tasted good, the cheese didn't melt all the way, so it was more solid than gooey. Probably best to stick with the meunster called for in the recipe. I also added some jalepeno peppers which tasted good with the cheese.

Great recipe!  I used less cheese (about 8 oz) as suggested by others and thought it could use more.  I didn't have almonds, so we went with out and it was just fine.
