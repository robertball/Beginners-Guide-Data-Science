Fresh lime juice is the secret. I disagree with the bartender who recommends Cuervo -- I've slowly come to believe that the people who order Patron silver margaritas are not idiots wasting fine tequila. It's great for margaritas. A cheaper alternative might be Sauva Hornitos. My personal favorite is Herradura, but like the reviewer who is a restaurant owner and bartender, it can be a waste. Good tequila is like good wine, and you don't have to slam it like a college kid to enjoy it.

As a restaurant owner and bartender I find that using good tequila (over $20) in a margarita is a waste.  Any standard Cuervo will do.  The key is to use fresh and top shelf ingredients along with it.  Fresh lime juice, lime zest, Grand Marnier and Cointreau.  Remember....you wouldn't make a Bellini or Champagne cocktail with Dom Perignon!

This is my understanding of the classic recipe - and it is wonderful.  The tequila MUST be 100% agave (Patron is), and I personally prefer anejo, with it's additional flavor.  Another note, to soften a little, replace some of the freshly squeezed lime juice with freshly squeezed lemon juice - but no more that 1/2...

Definite keeper.  The absolute key is good tequila.  I added a little bit of sugar or splenda but otherwise a great margarita!

I did not care for this recipe. I though it was too sour and diluted. While tequila LOVES sour, and Cointreau adds sweetness, I highly recommend cutting out the water, cutting way down on the Cointreau, and adding some agave nectar or simple syrup to taste.

I never thought of a margarita as having a complex flavor...but lime juice and water isn't (to me) a margarita.  We tried these because of the fresh ingredients, but something is missing here.  (We're 'on-the-rocks' folks; no frozen for us.)

This is the second time I make this drink and I definetely love it, specially since there is not additional sugar other than the one that the tequila and the cointreau already have which means to me "pure flavor".

This happends to be  the original Margarita Cocktail recipe.  Combine lime, cointreau and tequila with ice in a shaker, shake for 1 mintute, serve up with salt, required.  Its ridiculously good, nothing like you'll ever have at any bar.

If you are use the the fake Margaritas (Limeaide based), then you will not like this. This is the authentic recipe.

Not too bad, but I used a cheap tequila-normally I do use a good tequila-Tarantula, 1800, Patron,but I prefer Cabo Wabo. I know it's expensive, but the best tequila makes the best margaritas...

Not quite what I was looking for.  Limeade works better for me.

Made no changes and yes, I would make it again!  They were spot on like the best I’ve had at a Mexican restaurant.

Too much water. Don't see the need for it. I do agree that a good tequila makes all the difference. I also prefer Patron. Another good tequila is Don Julio, very expensive though.
