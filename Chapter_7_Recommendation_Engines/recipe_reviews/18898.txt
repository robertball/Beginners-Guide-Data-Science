Add my husband to the bunch who hate squash but liked this. I guess the appeal for them must be that the squash is kind of "diluted" or tamed by the other vegetables. Whatever the reason, we both enjoyed this a lot. No changes other than to add a little minced garlic to the sauteed vegetables, and it was fine as is.  Sometimes simple flavors are nice in their own right without a lot of additional herbs and spices.

Oh my, oh WOW, and HOLY COW!  Made this last night, and my BF ate an ENTIRE SQUASH!!!  He loved it so much he didn't hardly touch the main dish, which was one of his faves.  Omitted the butter, started with 4 slices thichk cut bacon (cut into pieces) and sauteed veggies in the grease, used a little less onion and a little more mushrooms, and added a bit more salt.  As another reviewer noted, had MORE than enough filling, but I just heaped 'er in!!:)  This was a fantastic recipe!!!

Delicious.  Go heavy on the celery and mushrooms so that you get some in every bite. **update- I made this again with sauteed apples and onions as a filling (with the cheese) instead of celery and mushrooms... so good, and actually pretty filling!

Added a clove of garlic to the saute, and put on panko bread crumbs on top of the cheese.  Yum!

This was delicious, and pretty simple to make!! I used deicata and a deicata/acorn hybrid since that was what we had, and I added bread crumbs on top (before the cheese), and it turned out great. A LOT of flavors. Also, we dont have a microwave, so I just baked the squash at 375 for a half hour. 
It was our main dish, since we dont eat meat, and it was very filling. I will be making this again.

Absolutely Wonderful!  What a nice change from the usual brown sugar ect. method.  I did find that I could have filled 2 squash (4 halves) with the "stuffing" mixture.  I've already passed the recipe on.  A definate keeper!

I'm trying to eat healthier & stay away from sugar so I thought this looked interesting from the usual brown sugar recipes.  I used olive oil instead of butter, also sauteed some garlic & used dried parsley, as that's what I had in the house.  You can adjust the amount of celery & onion to your taste.

I classify this as a five star.   It's got lots of vegetables and flavor with the cheese just being the extra part of it.   It is definetly a do again recipe.

Perfect and easy! Portabella mushrooms and a little garlic go very well. To serve, just cut the squash in quarters and place on the plate!

This was good, though it was missing something, but I can't quite put my finger on what.  Next time I make this I will probably use less celery, add some garlic, and maybe sprinkle a little bacon on top.  One last comment - one squash will supposedly serve two as a side dish.  I ate the suggested side dish serving size as a dinner and was full after half of that!

We loved this change from traditional sweet acorn squash (although we love that too!) As per reviews, I cut the filling in half and I'm glad I did because it was exactly enough! The only thing I changed was cooking in the microwave for only ten minutes since ours is very powerful, used red onion because that's all I had and adding minced garlic to the filling while it was cooking. This is a simple and delicious recipe that we will definitely make again! FYI: I cleaned the seeds from the squash, sprinkled them with olive oil, garlic salt, creole seasoning and chili powder and roasted them in the oven! Tasted a lot like roasted pumpkin seeds!

Excellent, served with roast for a hosted dinner.  Great reviews, didn't have mushrooms so left them out and used swiss cheese.  Made again last night, used Asparagus instead of mushrooms.  Excellent.  Will continue making with different options as great side dish.

This was fantastic!  I opted to bake my squash instead of microwave it, 15 minutes did the trick.  Then I opted out of the celery, not a fan myself.  Next time I'll double the saute however, as I used big squash.  I'll definitly make this again!

Simply amazing! This reminds me of my grandmother's sqaush casserole!  I made this recipe with the same ingredients, but let the squash cook enough so that I could scoop it out and mix with the celery, onion, cheese, and spices.  After mixing, put it back in the peel and bake.  (very similar method as twice-baked potatoes)

Yum! Wonderful savory squash recipe. Even my picky teenager enjoyed this one. Served the halves as a meatless main dish with salad.

Fantastic way to eat squash without loading it up with sugar! We've used this base recipe to make several variations including stuffed with rice, potatoes, veggies, diced cured ham, etc... Superb!

Delicious! I had sautéed shrimp with onion and garlic as well as brown rice with this, and i ended up scooping everything out of the squash and serving in it on top of the rice and shrimp. So good!  The only thing I changed in this recipe was using zucchini insteat of mushrooms and adding baby napa cabbage because I had it and it needed to be eaten soon. Also added garlic. A+ for this recipe :)

This turned out great and it got lots of oohs and ahhs.  I baked the squash halves at 350 until they gave easily to a fork (rather than microwaving).

Absolutely a wonderful dish! simple and fast and a nice change from all the other sweet recipes. I made it exactly as Linda prepared it with no tweaking. My wife went out and bought two more acorn squashes and wants me to make it again! Thanks for sharing. This recipe keeps me out of the " Dog House".

This was delicious! I used a frozen mix of green & red peppers and onions, and added a tablespoon of minced garlic. And I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar, just because my husband and I prefer it. Also, I microwaved the squash for 20 minutes total, but started by poking a couple holes in the rind and nuking for 5 min. whole. Took I it out, cut it in half & hollowed it out, then back in the microwave for 15 minutes. Worked perfectly and much easier to cut in half. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

What a great idea for a recipe! Everything was great except for the celery. I will be making this again but will be swapping out the celery for either chopped carrots or cauliflower...or both. Oh, & don't forget to salt & pepper the squash prior to adding the filling.

loved it, loved it, loved it.  I did not change anything in the recipe.  The only thing that was different was that I had extra stuffing for the squash.  it would just not all fit.  I probably had enough to fill one more half.  This was super easy and I will definitely make it again.

Squashes like sweet potatoes have so much more flavor when baked in the oven first, even though microwaving is faster.  I tried the recipe as written (besides the baking of the squash and adding minced garlic) and we just weren't real crazy about the dish.  I may try again but will try with half the called for onions and add panko and fresh grated parmesan for the topping instead of cheddar as that was the taste we didn't quite like with the squash.

We really enjoyed this.  I adapted the original recipe a little to fit my style in the kitchen and make it go a bit further.  First off, I like to limit my use of the microwave, so I poked some holes in the squash, put it in about 1/2 inch or so of water in a pan, and cooked it in the oven for about 45 minutes (or until easy to slide a knife into) at 375.  Instead of serving in the squash, I cubed the squash and served it as part of the other vege's.  (I imagine this would be good with butternut as well, if adapted this way.) I added spinach and chicken to the mix as well.  Served on a bed of brown rice.  Used parmesan cheese, rather than cheddar, as a topping.  I increased all ingredients so we'd have a larger amount leftover.

I made this recipe twice. The first time the way it is shown. My husband wasn't really excited about it, he didn't  really care for the mushrooms. I however really liked it. So I decided to make it again and change it up to see if I could change his mind. I cooked the squash as the recipe says but then let it cool slightly. I cooked the onions, celery & mushrooms as per the recipe but then I scraped the inside of the squash into the celery mixture, added a diced clove of garlic, 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese. I then placed this mixture back into the squash shell, baked @ 350 for 15 minutes then topped with 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Baked for 5 minutes more till cheese melted. Success, he loved it!!

This is a huge hit with my family, one of the best side dishes I've made.  I don't like using a lot of butter so i substituted in olive oil as a healthier choice but you need to add extra salt if only using OO.  Frying a little garlic in the oil before adding the vegetables adds a nice flavor.

I scooped the squash out of the shell, put it in a baking pan and they added the celery, onion, muschrooms, cheese, etc. and baked it.  More small servings!

I followed the recipe and it was ok. Not as good as I thought it would be. It needed something and I cant put my firnger on it. It tasted like Acorn with dressing in it. Maybe needed cranberries or more cheese

This was good, but different.  I can't seem to figure out if I like it.

First there wasn't enough flavor from the celery and mushrooms.  Next time I will need to double that.

Second, I baked the squash at 350 for 45 minutes.

The squash itself was great!

Great alternative use for squash, very tasty, even without mushrooms.  Did half using this recipe and half stuffed with sauteed apples and onions with cinnimon and a little sugar.

Delicious.  I cooked it for my parents.  My Father detests squash and refused to take his own portion, but after dutifully taking two bites off of my plate, he told us that it was the best squash he had ever had.  My mom and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Used chopped red and green bell peppers in place of the mushrooms.  Yum!

Absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure they would turn out as yummy as the photo looked but they did. I didn't have any shrooms so I subbed some finely chopped ham to make it a main dish and added a little garlic as suggested. My only problem was the microwave cook time was too long. Next time I will try for 15 mins. Mine stuck to the glass dish in some burnt spots but it didn't affect the flavor just annoying to clean. I also used half the filling amount as suggested and it was the perfect amount. Half a squash is plenty per person. I served this with Cabbage and Dumplings also from this site and it made for a very filling and delicious meal. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this recipe! I only had one acorn squash so I had some extra filling. That didn't last long either! My husband gobbled all the extra. Will definitely make again. A feel-good-to-serve and tasty dish! Don't substitute the quinoa. It is soooo heathy for you!

After looking for something different to do with acorn squash, I decided to try this recipe and I'm so glad I did. The recipe is easy, uses ingredients readily on hand and is delicious! I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so substituted canned and used sharp cheddar cheese. The fresh mushroom would have probably added good texture and a bit better flavor, but did not (in our opinion) detract from the dish at all! Thanks for posting!

My husband and parents said they liked this dish, but I thought it was too dry.  The 20 minute microwave time was too long, and I think the filling could've used more juices.  I added some white wine to the saute to give it more flavor, and the filling was good, but the squash was dry.

We really enjoyed this.  I forgot to cover when I put it in the oven but I think that helped the toppings retain their crunchiness. (Which I liked) It  was super easy and very satisfying so we will be making this one often!! Thanks!

the celery is surprisingly tasty in this recipe. we make it a bunch of times every winter. we put half a squash in a bowl and eat it right out of the skin. half a squash with a salad or soup makes a satisfying meal.

We really like this recipe. Added bacon and garlic as suggested. First few times we had way way too much stuffing. Now I know why . . . Acorn squash vary in size. The first few times I made it the squash was slightly bigger than a softball. Today my wife came home with a squash that was bowling ball size. I think I can use all the stuffing for the first time.

Since I prefer savory food to sweet, I have been making different variations (depending on the last visit to the grocery store!)of this for years - it is one of my hubby's favorites.  We like to add either bacon or sausage to the fried veggies.  We use some of the grease from the meat to fry the onions & mushrooms in.  Haven't tried it with celery, but I like the idea.  I also like to mix some cheese in with the stuffing mixture, so you get some cheese in every bite (can never have too much cheese at our house!) We also add a  little seasoning, garlic, seasoning salt, that type of thing.  This recipe sounds like it would make WAY too much stuffing for the squash though.  But, it is the best part for sure!

Tasty dish.  I am not a huge acorn squash fan because I don't like the sweetness.  I was pleasantly surprised how the ingredients mellowed out the sweetness.  On a whim, I sprinkled some bacons bits over the top of the finished dish.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Linda.

This was a very easy and yummy recipe. I didn't use any celery or parsley (can't stand them) and added a dash of cinnamon (there's something about cinnamon and squash that can't be separated) and it was delicious. Thanks!

As squash goes this was a winner! I kept putting off making the acorn squash I bought because all other recipes have been so-so. The toppings for this squash helped give it great flavor! Microwaving the entire 20 minutes definitely helped the squash be easy-to-scoop. I'll make this again!

I had never eaten or cooked acorn squash. I made this with out mushrooms or parsley cuz I didn't have them. I added a pinch  ground bay leaves and marjoram. I thought it tasted like loaded mashed potatoes. Next time I'm going to cut the onion in half add cauliflower and bacon bits!

As is had to give it a 2 star. Easy enough, but just blah. I will make again using some sausage as others suggested & maybe even a butternut squash instead for some flavor.  We liked the idea & simplicity.  As others suggested bake the squash, don't microwave - so much better.

My whole family loved this!  I was out of parsley and substituted sage instead.  They all said it was really good, which is difficult to achieve in my picky family.  We have always used butter and brown sugar with acorn squash before, but this allows us to avoid the sugar and enjoy the health benefits of the vegetables.

This was pretty good. The "stuffing" needs to be jazzed up some - pretty bland. As suggested, I am going to try with apples & onions - think the sweetness of the apples will pair well.

Ok, so I followed it to a point. I had to sub some lower calorie butter and cheese, but the size of the acorn and the amounts of celery, onion and mushroom were what was called for. But...since this was a dinner meal for us and not a side, I added one link of Trader Joe's Roasted Garlic Chicken Sausage (sliced and quartered and sauteed at the end of the celery/onion/mushroom step). Very good, filling, and satisfying. We'll be doing this again. The recipe, as it is submitted, is a good jumping off point. Thanks!

I made this recipe last night and loved how simple it was. It turned out great. I added some crumbled sausage to the filling mixture and used some brie for the cheese. Great recipe. Will try it again using different veggies and protein.

Made this for dinner tonight. Delicious!  Even my husband who doesn't like squash thought it was yummy.  I added two cloves of chopped garlic when I sauted the onions and celery before adding the mushrooms.  This is definitely a keeper!

It tasted like thanksgiving day stuffing without any of the carbs! Yummy! I used sharp cheddar and regular parsley (not flat leaf). It didn't specify in the recipe. I had a small squash so ate both sides, it was a meal!

New family favorite. The only difference was I used a local herb cheese that had on hand. It was a nice change from all of the sweet recipes that can be found for acorn squash.

My daughter and I enjoyed this very much!  It would make a nice meal all by itself, it is so filling!  I doubled the recipe to feed my family of 5, and I added 2 Tbsp of a bacon seasoning blend in the hope that my husband would be more likely to eat it without judging too soon.  It was not to be, he said there were too many onions, and my boys just don't appreciate this kind of thing yet.  *Note that there are NOT too many onions.  I will be making this again for my daughter and me.

My family and I had this tonight for dinner.  It got rave reviews from the adults.  I did make a few changes.  I did like one person said and added bacon and cooked the veggies in some of the bacon fat.  I also mixed a little panko in with the cheese on top.  WONDERFUL!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  NOTE:  I only microwaved each side separately for 7 minutes.  Turned out perfect.  I also broiled the top for a couple minutes after the cheese melted.

Nice way of preparing acorn squash that isn't a sweet recipe. I subbed out the celery for asparagus. Quick and easy. I would recommend cutting down on microwave time, or at least checking half way through. My squash did not need nearly that much time.

Doubled it; it was pretty plain. It's a pretty good base, but it needs spiffing up. I think onion was the predominant flavor in mine

This is so yummy and beautiful.  We are going to add it to the thanksgiving table!  On a less elaborate day, it can serve as a vegetarian entree.  I prefer it with a sharper cheese - italian blend is good.

I've used this recipe twice now, and I love it - though I've adapted it a bit each time. The first time, I didn't have celery or carrots, so I just used mushrooms and onions. The second time I also didn't have celery/mushrooms, and I added barley to the mix along with a little bit of ground beef. I also spiced it with cayenne pepper and black pepper. It is delicious even without the cheese on top, and with variations. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Very, very good! Modified using a reviewers suggestion, of cooking bacon and then sauteed in bacon grease versus using butter.  Soooo good!

super easy, super yummy. I would substitute olive oil next time -- might have been a little greaser than it needed to be. Otherwise, awesome. I concur that 1/2 of one squash is a perfect main dish for a vegetarian :)

Very tasty! I only needed 10 minutes in the microwave (thanks for the heads-up, prior reviewers!). Also, I don't care for mushrooms and left them out. I added some sausage - delicious!  Don't skimp on the cheese at the end.

Ohh, this is a wonderful recipe. Sweet and savory. I didn't use butter because I cooked the onions and celery in pan drippings, just for a little more flavor. Soooo good...

Really delicious! My husband was a little thrown off by the sweet flavor of the squash at first, but it didn't stop him from eating the whole thing!  I would recommend checking your squash every 5 minutes during the microwaving - 10 minutes in my microwave was too long!  All together a really yummy recipe!

We really didn't care for this recipe... I don't know what it was... it felt like it was missing something and it was way too mushroomy (and we usually love mushrooms).

The whole family devoured it!  I didn't have any mushrooms, and they weren't even missed!  The slight sweetness of the squash, slightly caramelized onions and celery made THIS recipe a keeper!  The combination of flavors just were exceptional in the palate.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was AMAZING! My husband & I both loved it and the kids even liked it, too!  20 minutes in the microwave was way too long though, 8-9 minutes was perfect. Everyone should try this recipe, it's one of our new favorites!

This was so good!  Since we don't like mushrooms, I cooked up some barley and brown rice in broth, and added it in place of the mushrooms - it was very tasty and filling this way.  I tripled the recipe, and there was so much filling I used a 9x13 to hold the filled squash halves and all the extra filling.  It was a great casserole!  Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  Different, but not too crazy, very easy to make.  Added a pod of garlic and a little white wine just so the mushrooms would cook down better.

We enjoyed this for a change of side dishes.  Next time I will mix different cheeses in with the stuffing and also think this needs minced garlic; a fun recipe to experiment with!

I'm not a squash fan, but I thought that this was pretty good.  The flavors of the onion, celery and mushrooms overpowered the squash which is a good thing.  :)  Will make it again.

This is my favorite way to eat squash, hands-down. I love that it's savory.

My only suggestion would be to lower the time of microwaving the squash--I nuked mine for 10 minutes and it was already fairly soft.

A fun variation is to substitute the mushrooms for meat (I used Trader Joe's sweet apple chicken sausage--easy to work with since it is pre-cooked). This turns it into a delicious main dish.

my husband thought it was fine, but maybe I just don't like acorn squash.  for some reason the squash had curved bone-like things at the bottom??? this was my first acorn sqaush recipe.  kinda wish I just went with a soup instead.

20 minutes burnt my squash, way too long for me.  I had to send my hubby out to buy another while I continued cooking and it set us back about 30 minutes with dinner.

The second squash I cooked for 8 minutes and that was enough time. 

It was fabulous, my father-in-law liked it so much he asked for the recipe.  My kids didn't like it - but I knew they wouldn't.

Overall - very tasty!

Very tasty... Got a little soupy so I may puncture the bottom of the squash next time to drain some of the excess juices.  I will also scrape the squash away from the skin before stuffing it so it's easier to eat.

This was good but not fabulous. I think it needed some more spice and something more to the texture. But I do appreciate how simple and quick it is, which is why I made it instead of running to the store to get ingrediants for something more complicated.

This was an excellent dish.  I doubled the recipe, 4 halves.  Grounded 3/4 lb of beef with paprika, salt, parsley and garlic ... then sauteed the onions, and celery afterwards.  Did not add aditional spices.  Then drained the beef.  After cooking the squash in the micro, I lightly covered the squash with real maple syrup and then placed it in the oven first, after warming it up, I then I put the meat mixture in, warmed this up, then I placed cheese over the top then melted it.  The kids and my husband loved this recipe too!  Thanks for sharing!!  I will  be making this often when acorn squash is in season! ;)

yummy!  BF loved it too!  We don't like celery & I didn't want to pay $3 for mushrooms so I added chicken stovetop stuffing instead.  We could only eat 1/4 of the squash due to the stuffing.  Thanks for sharing- great recipe!

I thought this recipe was awesome!  I made it once and followed the recipe with the exception of adding bread crumbs as one person suggested.  The next time I made it I added some leftover wild rice and it was even tastier.  I will be making it again and again! : )

I have always been mystified by squash and never much cared for it. But this recipe was delicious. It is nice to have an alternative way to cook it besides butter & maple syrup. I will definately cook it again. My boyfriend, Mr. Meat & Potatoes Loved it!

I don't know...maybe I'm just a fan of the butter-and-brown sugar squash recipes, but I found the taste of this dish to be rather unremarkable. However, a squash-hating taste tester remarked it was "quite good, really", so figure that into the equation.

I didn't think I would like this combination and the first bite I still wasn't sure but it turned out to be great.  We ate the WHOLE thing.  Would be a great dish for a vegetarian.

Wonderful recipe.  It is such a great alternative to the usual sweet winter squash recipes.  My husband, who does not like squash and usually won't eat it, said to make it again and double the recipe!  Thanks for  sharing.

Definitely a winner!  I did make a few adjustments though.  I added chicken stock to the bottom of the glass dish and microwaved the squash halves for 12 minutes.  I added two tablespoons of chicken stock in each half of the squash prior to adding the sautéed mixture.  I sautéed the onions, celery and mushrooms with garlic, a Serrano pepper and fresh parsley, all chopped finely.  I added 8 minutes to the cook time prior to sprinkling the cheese.  Next time I will add some  crumbled breakfast sausage with the onion mixture and serve for brunch!  Everyone loved it!!

Very delicious. Definitely make it again. I added 1/3 pound cooked ground beef and 1/3 box of stovetop stuffing (prepared according to package directions) to the filling. That was a great decision.

This was a really simple recipe, and it tasted great. I think next time I'd be inclined to put some of the butter directly on the squash, and maybe some of the seasoning as well. I think I will make it again for myself and play around with the spices, but I think my boyfriend was not as keen on it. However, I think it would work better for him as a small side with something else to be the 'main' side dish. A suggestion he made was that the stuffing may be better with all three ingredients diced pretty fine to turn it into more of a hash, and I agree that this could be a nice modification.

I made this as a main course for lunch. Didn't have mushrooms or cheddar, so I left the mushrooms out and used mozzarella. I wanted to add some flavor, so I added 3 oz spicy Italian sausage and half a green bell pepper (chopped) to the onions, sauteed a few minutes, with about a tsp of coconut oil instead of the butter, and added a small/medium chopped apple, along with the salt, pepper, and parsley, just before stuffing the hot squash. Baked in a countertop convection oven for just 5 minutes, and it was done.  Golden brown on top, hot, and delicious!

I really liked this very simple recipe. My husband doesn't really like the sweetness of most winter squash recipes, so I opted for something more savory. While I didn't convert him to a squash lover, he did say that it was good and much better than any way he had had winter squash prepared before.The only change I made was that I used monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar because it was all I had in the fridge. I feel that change isn't big enough to drastically change the recipe and I can imagine that I would like it the same if I had used cheddar. 
Overall, this is a very quick, easy recipe that has lots of flavor. It was a nice compliment to the main dish of grilled top sirloin steak. A nice fall meal.

Great carb free option to have with dinner!  I added red peppers, because I had them and it added color.  Needed more salt and pepper,  but each person can adjust for their own tastes.   Really loved it, and it will be a regular for the season!

This was good but I think I prefer sweet on acorn squash over savory.  I didn't have mushrooms but know they would have been good.  I wish the author would have indicated to cut a slice of the bottom of the squash so it would stand up easier, or do in slices as someone did in the pictures.  Good flavor though!

I altered the recipe to include green onions, garlic salt, and ham because I had some on hand and added brown rice to make it a hearty main dish. It was amazing!!! I added bread crumbs to the top based off of some other reviews and it was soooo good. This is now one of my favorite meals!

I was looking for a savory alternative to the brown sugar/butter recipe and found this. I didn't have any celery on hand so I substituted some frozen turnip greens and added a dash of cayenne pepper. This would make a super holiday dish but is great for every day too. You could even use it as an alternate for a loaded potato. Added bonus, my kitchen smells wonderful!

I was thrilled when I first ran across this recipe because I've been trying to find a non-sweet recipe for using acorn squash (they're all for ones baked with brown sugar or maple syrup, ugh), but this one ended up being too sweet also.  The filling was delicious as other users have noted and the cheese is a great idea to add interest and complexity of flavor, but frankly, I just think acorn squash is way too sweet to translate well with savory flavors like the cheese.  I would definitely not make this again.  The only way I think this might work out okay is if you took it a step further and used a different, more bland kind of squash or possibly if you added a spicy ground sausage to the cheese and celery mixture.  Otherwise, the flavors are just too poor of a match.

Very good!!  Very easy to make. Didn't make too many changes. Only used 2 Tbl butter and added garlic salt. Put fresh ground pepper and a little salt into the wells of the acorn squash prior to adding the filling. I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was fantastic! I doubled the recipe as I had 2 squash on hand and omitted the celery as I had none and I am not a huge fan of it.  I also used garlic in the saute as other cooks suggested.  I hope it's not true about the leftovers being soggy, I am the only one going to eat them!!! I made this will a nice pork tenderloin and it was phenomenal with it!!! Happy cooking!!

I typically detest squash, but my four-year-old loves it and begged for some at the local produce stand. Not being one to discourage him from eating his veggies, I made this tonight (with my half of the squash) and was very pleased. I didn't have mushrooms, but the celery and onion were delicious and just crunchy enough to balance out the texture of the squash (the part I usually can't get past). I don't know that the little guy would have liked the recipe, as I found the onion flavor pretty prevalent, but I think for adult palates, it's terrific. Will make this again.

Excellent flavor and texture. I added 1 clove of garlic and had no parsley. Celery gave it a lovely texture, mushrooms added an almost meaty flavor. Absolutely delicious. My husband wasn't home on time and it smelled so good I ate my half. It was difficult to save his half for him. By the time he got home, he had already eaten. The next day I had his half warmed in the microwave for my lunch. It was good, but not awesome like the night before. From now on there will be no leftovers LOL

This was my first attempt at winter squash - WOW!  I followed suggestions to bake it for an hour instead of the microwave.  It was so sweet and delicious and the mushrooms added a great savory element.

BE AWARE microwaves have different strengths. I checked at 10 minutes, any longer the squash would have been cremated.  The second time I started checking at 5 min, ended at 7 min.  Anyway this is absolutely delicious.

I loved this, my husband said it was OK.  However, there is a lot of stuff he doesn't like so I am not giving his rating much impact here.  For such a simple recipe, it was very flavorful, and a great change from the typical sweet acorn squash recipes I have made.

This tastes similar to stuffing, but with squash instead of bread. So, if you like the flavor of stuffing but aren't crazy about soggy bread, then give this a try.

We have had to recently change my husbands diet, and while at the store rummaging through the veggie section I bought an acorn squash even though I have never been impressed with any squash types.  I tried this recipe and loved it!  I have definatly changed my ideas and thoughts about squash and how they can be prepared.  Thank you.

I roasted the squash at 350 for about 40 minutes and left out the celery and added a lot of garlic and extra mushrooms. Definitely delicious.

I added about a 1/2 cup of sausage. My husband like it. I really didn't care for it.I've never really like winter squash or sweet potatoes all that much. I was hoping this recipe would make me like winter squash. Oh well, at least Jeremy liked it!

It was awesome. I had some leftover chicken handy so I shredded it and added it to the stuffing. I didn't have celery handy, but it tasted great anyway. I think I found a great Thanksgiving side dish!

I love all the ingredients in this dish, so it's no surprise that I loved it. However, I was out of the room while the squash was in the microwave, and when I came back I smelled burning and it was a little too dried out and brown on the edges. Take the 20 minutes on high with a grain of salt! I used portobello mushrooms and it was very good. There's leftover filling, so I plan on making some more in a few days.

WOW! Not in a million years would I put these ingredients together, but I am glad I found this recipe and did! The sweet squash and savory ingredients blended perfectly! Others said they cut down on the filling, but I filled with what I could, then after baking, scooped the squash onto the plate and topped with the remaining filling. I followed the recipe to a T and this is a new favorite I am sure I will make many time this fall!!!

This was great, never knew squash could taste so good.  We ate leftovers for a couple of days, and it was good heated up.

Very Good, didn't change a thing. My husband who hates squash even liked it! Nice to have a change from the sweet recipes for squash.

This is delicious and easy.  You can adjust the stuffing according to what you have on hand.  I like to change types of cheese as well, depending on what's in the fridge.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe! A yummy new twist to squash! I made cornbread as my side dish and it was fantastic.

I agree with those who say you can halve the stuffing ingredients.  I also made mine with bacon.  Yum.  My baby daughter really liked it too.

We love squash, we grew it... we did NOT like this.  I added some stuffing & bacon to it, just to make it more filling for a dinner, my husband told me to scoop out the stuffing for him & he'd eat that... Kids aren't too big on crunchy celery, onions & mushrooms... not a family pleaser for us.

I loved this recipe.  I only had sweet prepared squash before so I was kinda scared to make it, but I wanted something different.  This was perfect!  I make it often!

Great idea- would have never thought of it on my own!  I modified it to my taste, using shallots in place of onions, and some fresh garlic.  I love this recipe!
