I threw in a large chopped organic red pepper and used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. This was great as a quick breakfast. The boys had this with last night's leftover cornbread.

Delicious breakfast! I usually melt the butter and fry the onions a bit then add the egg mixture.  Don't over scramble or they become rubbery.  This is great with toast, orange juice, and a bit of bacon on the side.

Great breakfast Heather! Simple ingredients and easy to throw together. I made this for The Boy for breakfast this morning, along with toast, before sending him off to school for the day. He LOVES it.....says it's the best breakfast he's ever had ~ then told me to rate this one a five-star! High praise indeed coming from Mr. Doesn't-Wanna-Eat-Anything-But-Chicken-Noodle-Soup.

add bell pepper; mushrooms, cayenne powder.  Cook before adding egg mixture.
Update, used sausage, fantastic, next time no salt if using sausage.

This recipe was fantastic! My usually picky son finished his before my wife and I and looked in the pan to see if there was anymore. We didn't have any ham so I substituted about a half of pound of bacon which I cooked before hand after cutting it into 1 inch pieces. Once again just the tastiest breakfast imaginable.

Tasty combination. Added diced green pepper and used frozen diced onions as a timesaver. I do think the timing is off a bit because eggs shouldn't have to be cooked for 10-15 minutes as the recipe stated. Mine were done in a just a couple of minutes.

We do low carb and were getting bored with our breakfast choices. I made this today, substituting sausage, browned, drained and crumbled, added when the eggs were almost set. Like someone else, I sauteed the onion, along with some diced bell pepper, then just added the egg mixture to the skillet, finishing with the sausage and cheese. I thought my husband was going to eat the plate! It was so good!

This is so good.  It make a nice quick breakfast.  I have also switched up the meat, you could do it with bacon or sausage instead of the ham.  Always good with whatever meat you have on hand.

This was a hit with the crowd and so easy to make! Next time I will not add salt since it's already in the ham and butter. I used a lot of ham so there was just as much ham as there was egg.

Yep, it's a good'un.  The only changes made were the addition of a red bell pepper, some sliced fresh mushrooms, and a generous shake, shake, shake of cayenne pepper.  Loved by Mrs. Elk Guy and our two sons.

Excellent recipe! This was fast to put together, tasted wonderful and was very filling too. I used onion powder and only 1 tsp. and didn't have a full cup of cheese. I didn't stir this while cooking, I lifted the cooked edges and let the uncooked egg run beneath and put a lid on the pan so I wouldn't have to attempt turning this over. This fed two of us so if you are really planning on feeding this to four then you should increase the recipe. Of course, we had it for dinner with only biscuits and honey butter for sides. It was great though and we both enjoyed this meal very much. Thanks!

This was delicious. I didn't have ham so I used bacon. That was very good. Next time I will try it with ham. To me that sounds even better. My DH loved it also.

I have made this for years. It is easy, quick, great for anytime of the day and can be made adding just about anything that sounds good. This can even be made into a very good Huevos Rancheros by adding a few ingredients and putting them in a warm tortilla. 

I make it with bacon fried cut into half inch squares give or take then cut up some potato, as much or little as we want,  into no more than half inch cubes then rinse and dry and fry the potato, onion and whatever else you add in at this time that needs longer frying time in the bacon grease then put the potatoes on a napkin or paper towel to drain. 

Drain most of the rest of the bacon drippings after frying the potatoes leaving just enough to scramble the eggs. 

Once the eggs are nearly set add the pre-cooked onions, bacon, cheese and potatoes just long enough to melt the cheese and voila. Heaven on earth! 

Add other ingredients as you like and spice it up a bit for Huevos Rancheros. This recipe CANNOT be ruined unless you leave too much bacon drippings.

Very delicious! I am a college student learning how to cook and this was by far easy and very tasty.
