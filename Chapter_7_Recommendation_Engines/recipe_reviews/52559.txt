I found this to be quite a charming recipe--easy to make with impressive results. Since the phyllo tart shells are not available in my area, I took phyllo dough and pressed it around the cups of a muffin pan, then filled the cups with the mixture. Although the recipe lends itself well to chanterelle mushrooms, it can be modified easily, e.g. by substituting spinach for the mushrooms. Any quiche ingredients would work. I find that this particular recipe tastes best by increasing the garlic, onions, cream cheese and Swiss cheese a bit, and I add an extra egg. This dish is also quite suitable for brunch.

Pretty good, but next time I will add more Swiss cheese, cream cheese, and bacon.

The only changes I made were to omit the parsley, and I used chestnut mushrooms. I couldn't find phyllo shells (admittedly, I didn't look too hard) so I used a cookie cutter to cut out circles of white bread which I pressed into a greased muffin tin, and toasted in the oven for about 5 mins. Turned out really well! This is a nice little snack/appetizer. Thanks!

I used this filling to go over crostini instead of phyllo cups. I didn't use the brandy because I don't like the taste but other than that- I popped em' under the broiler for about 4 minutes and they were perfect!  I brought them to a party and they were gone right away with requests for the recipe.  I have to say that I think with the egg and bacon texture they would be a huge hit at a brunch or breakfast!!

Not my favourite appetizer. I brought them to a party and no-one asked for the recipe.  I will look for another use for my mushrooms next time.

I am not a fan of swiss cheese, so I substituted Gruyere.   Also didn't have any brandy, so I used a Chardonnay.  The tartlets were amazing and I got loads of compliments.

I know everything is better with bacon, but to save some calories, I omitted it.  I'm sure with the bacon, this is a 5-star, so that's what I'm giving it.  I needed to use up a container of sliced button mushrooms, so I used that instead of the chanterelles.  And I used all dried herbs instead of fresh.  And I used the pinot grigio I was drinking instead of the brandy.  And with my changes that made this wonderful recipe much more low brow than it was intended to be, it was a solid 4-stars.
