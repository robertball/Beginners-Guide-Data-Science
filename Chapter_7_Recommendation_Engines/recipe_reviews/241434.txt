Thank you so much for this healthy alternative to chocolate chip cookies! Made these to the exact recipe, cooked them for 10 mins and they came out to perfection, soft centers with crisp edges!  My batch made 16 cookies, I will double it next time because with my family of 5 they won't last the day!

I made these with Jif All Natural Peanut Butter because I didn't have any Almond Butter (and it was crazy expensive at the store!). I baked the first batch for the full 8 minutes, but they were too dark on the bottom and had a few burned spots on the top, so I baked the second batch for 5 minutes and let them rest on the pan for another 2 minutes before moving them. They were still extremely gooey, but a beautiful golden brown and firmed up nicely. My middle son ate that whole second batch (6 cookies!!). I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead (because I LOVE chocolate chips). I did use Nestle Semi-Sweet because I really wanted a cookie recipe that just didn't have flour. This FIT the bill!! My dad is allergic to wheat, and he thought they were really good. I think you could really do a lot of different things with this base cookie recipe. Loved it! Thanks so much!!

My kids liked them after I explained that these were not store bought cookies. I told them that since they were made with honey instead of sugar, they could eat as many as they wanted. They loved that. I also added a teaspoon of coconut oil for a little extra sweetness and moisture. I used peanut butter when the cashew butter ran out, and they were still awesome.

I rarely write reviews, but these cookies were so good I felt compelled to rate them.  Most paleo treats are lack luster, but not these.  They are moist and a real treat.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe ! I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I love this recipe! Although I added some things to it, because I found that the first time I baked this, it was too dry. So I added 1/2 cup of shredded sugar free coconut to make it moist and I added 1/2 cup of flax seeds for some fiber ! My to go cookies when I'm losing weight and want something sweet!

I'm new to the gluten free diet and this was my first GF baking attempt. I did a "practice run" before taking these to my office potluck. The recipe was great as is. When I made them again for work, I doubled the recipe and added 1 tablespoon of unrefined coconut oil as others had recommended and thought they were even better. However, they were a little too oily so I'll probably use 1 teaspoon per batch next time. I used dark chocolate chips for half and craisins for the other.  Both kinds were gone within minutes and everyone, gluten free or not, LOVED them. Definitely saving this recipe to make again.

This was my first attempt at baking something "grain free" as I'm new to this!  Obviously, they didn't quite measure up to my old chocolate chip cookie recipe, but I was still pleasantly surprised! These really hit the spot after being 90% grain free for the last 2 months.  It was nice to eat something "normal"! 

I used 1/2 almond butter 1/2 peanut butter since I didn't have enough almond butter....and will probably do that in the future as well just because almond butter is so expensive. Other than that I followed the recipe. Oh, I did throw in a handful of chopped pecans. I didn't have anything but the junky hershey's chocolate chips, but plan to look for a healthier version. Might even just cut some chunks of a dark chocolate bar next time.  
In the future, I will 1/2 this recipe if it's just for me. I don't need that many cookies sitting around, healthy or not. They still have a ton of calories because of all the nut butter.

One would not know these are flour-less.  Tried them on husband and he really like them.  when I told him what the ingredients was, he was surprised.

The batter, not dough, is a bit sticky, but the end result is delicious.  Many other variations can be formed from this basic recipe.  Next time, I might try adding cinnamon chips, coconut, or even peanut butter, instead of almond butter.  A small amount of almond flour might even out the sticky batter as well.

Thumbs Up!

Add half cup walnuts and quarter cup flax meal and tbsp coconut oil. Use mini chocolate chips enjoy life brand. So great. Substitute any nut butter. Except peanut if youâ€™re paleo. Got a batch of twenty. So so good.

I made this twice and both times forgot to take pictures because my husband and I ate them so quickly. I have Hashimotoâ€™s and have to eliminate dairy, gluten and soy from my diet so these are a nice treat to have every so often without sending my thyroid levels out of wack. I ended up cooking them for 12 minutes to firm them up but thatâ€™s just a personal preference. Love it. Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe!

These are neither bad nor good. They're lightly sweet, and taste mainly of nut butter. But the texture is very crumbly. I tried a couple different temperature and time combinations and couldn't improve on the texture.

I am new to the Paleo diet and was craving a treat.  The only variation I made was more chocolate chips.  This was perfect.  The cookies are chewy and I thought better the next day after sitting out over night.  Thanks for sharing this.

These cookies are excellent and honestly, I was shocked at how good they are after reviewing the ingredients list.  My family prefers this recipe over non-paleo cookies.  I did double the amount of paleo chocolate chips.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe with the exception I got the honey almond butter. I also had no parchment paper so treated it like a regular cookie and put on baking sheet. My one year old is currently sensitive to gluten and dairy, so this was great to find. My 4 year old also ate these cookies and said he loved them. I may try the peanut butter instead of almond butter next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Taste best when they are fresh! We couldnâ€™t tell they were flourless. A great recipe. Baked them in an electric oven at 7400 ft. elevation and put the oven 5 degrees hotter to make up for the change in atmospheric pressure.  They came out perfect using the original recipe.

this recipe is awesome! I have to say I would not have tried it if it wasn't for the reviews. it just didn't seem possible, no dry ingredients. all the way to the end I was thinking this is gonna be a disaster. my husband is diabetic but he can have THESE COOKIES AND WE LOVE THEM!! I made two batches, one with, 1 cup pecans and half cup mini semi sweet chips. the other batch just Macedonian nuts 1 cup, nothing  ELSE. I also used the 4th cup almond floor suggested in one of the reviews to stretch the recipe, good Thing cause they won't last!!! Thank you so much for sharing your great recipe I will be passing this one on to friends and family.

These cookies taste great but for some reason weâ€™re dry and crumbly. I donâ€™t mind because they are so tasty but definitely not chewy/crispy like others say they turned out.  I will probably make again.

Love these!  Even my wife loves them and she is especially hard to please when it comes to desserts!  They are so moist compared to several other paleo cookies I have tasted.

I made it exactly as recipe, it needed to bake for 4 extra minutes, I think because of the size of my cookies. I made my own almond butter. Delicious and even received a yummy from a picky daughter as well ! Will be definitely be making these again!

Used peanut butter, added 1 tsp of coconut oil, added a little whole wheat flour to make it not so sticky, added some flax seed meal, and used 1 tsp salt. Good for a not too bad for you sweet.

I never knew gluten and dairy free tasted so good! Everyone at my house who isn't on the Paleo diet also think they're really good! I'm in love!!

So easy and delicious! If you're only making six cookies with this recipe, the cookies will turn out huge!

I made this recipe and switched out almond butter with peanut butter, switched honey with agave (what I had on hand) and added a tbls of flax and a handful of chopped walnuts.  It's a good basic recipe.  I'll try it with Almond butter and honey soon.

I realized that the almond butter that I had on-hand was flavored (Barney butter cocoa+coconut).  I didn't feel like running to the store, so I gave it a whirl.  It worked!  It gave it a nice coconut flavor.  I will definitely make these again and will try plain almond butter too.  This is the best tasting "Paleo" dessert that I have made yet.

I read all the reviews before cooking, added the teaspoon of coconut oil, doubled the chips and cooked exactly 10 minutes per various suggestions. These cookies were absolutely delicious! It is the first recipe I've made without wheat and been able to eat. This is a new venture for me and I am learning through experience. Thank you for sharing.

These are wonderful!  I wanted to eat the batter raw!  Just made my first batch and I am excited about sharing these with my husband when he gets home.  The two year old is loving them too!   I just got done with a W30 and am looking to eat healthier after feeling soooo good, but I NEED something to satisfy my sweet tooth. These fit the bill!  Yum!

Delicious! Perfectly moist and a touch salty which I love. Followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for creating this. I can share with my two year old and feel okay about it.
