Best soft cookie recipe I've found. Also a bit light/fluffy so it's slightly cakier than a traditional chocolate chip cookie.

Very good recipe.  Although I did make one change.  Instead of butter I used 3/4 cup butter flavored Crisco and 1-1/2 TBSP. water.  My husband says it's a keeper!

So soft and yet chewy.  I've searched a long time for a chocolate chip cookie that suits my picky sweet tooth.  This is it!  I didn't change a thing, only added some pecans as that's an addition my family enjoys in cookies.  My oven took ten minutes to bake them to perfection.  Yum!

I don't think I've added Karo syrup to a cookie recipe before... I was about 1/8 of a cup short of Karo, to I topped it off with molasses, which I was sure would over-power everything else. But it came out great! Also, I only used about 3/4 of the 12 oz bag of semi-sweet choc chips. My kids love it, of course!!

These cookies turned out great even though I had to substitute the brown sugar for white sugar, since I didn’t realize I was completely out of brown sugar. They still turned out great and were soft and delicious.
