I made this for our supper tonight, and I must say that I wasn't too excited about it. I thought it would taste like warmed up salsa. BUT... IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! We are adding it to our favorites folder, so I will definitely be making this again!

This was an awesome!  I used a chipolte salsa which added a wonderful smoky flavour.

I wasn't sure about this one either.  The combination of ingredients kind of threw me off...but it was yummy!  Sorta barbecue-ey, sorta sweet...thanks!

So, I tried this last night, didn't get out all the ingredients before I started cooking, I just assumed I had them all. So I had to substitute, I used spaghetti sauce and red onions instead. It came out great. Added a few other things, Italian bread crumbs, adobo and  garlic powder. Fiancee loved it. ;-)

Very Yummy!! We diced our green onions and added a little less on the salsa.  Would surely make again. Thanks!
