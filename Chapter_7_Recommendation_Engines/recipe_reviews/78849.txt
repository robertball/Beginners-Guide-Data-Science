The site didn't add that you have to clarify the butter so that the pancakes won't burn. They did however add a link at the bottom of the recipe showing how to clarify butter. For the purposes of this recipe you don't have to completely clarify it though, just heat the butter in the microwave and skim off the fat that floats on top before adding it to the mix. It is also nice if you add the hot butter to the cold milk so that it solidifies again and creats butter pockets in the pancakes when they cook.

I love this recipe, I have made it every year on Christmas morning for the last 5 years.  I add 1% milk to make the consistency better, start with 1/4 cup and add as desired.  Usually 1/4 cup will do.  
I also don't mess with clarified butter (don't have the time) I just use oil like my Mom used to and it works great.

They were okay. They were way too thick.  I added milk to make them more runny and then they turned out good.  If it wasn't for the milk I added they would turn out burnt on the outside and runny on the inside b/c they were too thick.  I think a 3/4 cup of milk should be added to the recipe to make better pancakes.

I was actually very impressed by this recipe!  The pancakes were extremely fluffy and tasty, with just a hint of eggnog flavor.  I'm not a huge eggnog fan, I go back and forth on it (although I do occasionally substitute eggnog for cream in my coffee, so I had some on hand).  My only criticism was that the eggnog made the batter very thick so the pancakes were slightly burned before they cooked through.  I'd suggest substituting up to half of the eggnog with milk.  I used lowfat eggnog and skim milk. They were delicious!

We really enjoyed these pancakes for our "day after Christmas" breakfast.  As written the batter was thicker than I prefer so I adjusted the recipe by adding an extra egg, rum extract, nutmeg, and 1/2 cup more eggnog.  Just add more eggnog until it is the desired thickness.  They came out perfect.

Good Recipe - not very pancake-like - more like a fluffy biscuit.  I did my test run for Christmas Morning last night, and everone in the family tried some.  I did not use Clarified butter, but they would have come out better if i had, since they are thick, it does take longer to cook the inside than regular pancakes.  We had leftovers, so we wrapped them in wax paper and froze them.  When i ran off to work in the morning i grabbed them, and ate them cold in the car after they had thawed for 30 minutes, and they were even better cold!!!  Very good quick morning treat!

They turned out good. Solid eggnog flavor without being overwhelming. I used about 3/4 cup eggnog about 1/4 - 1/2 cup 1% milk.

I was skeptical with the eggnog in these but always having extra at the holidays, I went for it.  Husband doesn't like "strange ingredients I put in food when experimenting but even he said these were really good!  Thanks!

Batter is way too thick if you follow the directions, so I changed a few things... 3/4 cup egg nog, 1/4 to 1/3 cup skim milk, 2 T canola oil (in place of butter) and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  With those changes, they were Fantastic!!!  Fluffy and tasty! Will def make again next time I have leftover egg nog!

Yummy! Great way to use up holiday eggnong.  I found that the batter was a bit thick so I thinned it out with milk.

I just made this recipe, and it was excellent! I like the texture, and the height these pancakes get! similiar to the Truckstop buttermilk pancakes I also got from this website, which my family loves! Oh, I did add a tad of milk because it was a little thick. I can't believe I can only make this seasonally though!

I do NOT like eggnog, but these are DELICIOUS! I added an extra dash of cinnamon to the batter too. This batter was much thicker than my usual Bisquick-so I had to adjust my cooking technique.

Taste good and are fluffy, but I had to add water to thin down the batter (I was out of milk). A big hit with my picky toddler!

These were thick and rich... totally delicious! I did, however, alter the recipe: substituted 1/4 cup of milk for 1/4 cup of the eggnog, and added a bit of nutmeg, rum, and vanilla... delicious!

These were very yummy, with a delicate eggnog finish.  My changes are as follows: used 3/4 cup eggnog, 1/2 cup 2% milk.  Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I cooked at 250* on the griddle - low and slow cooks them through and prevents burning/scorching.

Made these this morning for 5 people and doubled the recipe, exept for the baking powder...just used 4 teaspoons.  Also substituted cooking oil for the clarified butter (too much work!).  They were actually quite good...everyone liked them.  They are just a bit dense so don't expect "light and fluffy".  Good recipe and I will probably use again.  Thanks.

I rated this recipe two stars for a couple of reasons.  The first is that the recipe yield is for 6 people, but this is way off in my opinion, we only fed three!  As well, the batter is VERY thick and in the end I had to add about an additional 1/2 cup of milk to thin the batter out a bit.  The flavour was not bad, but we found them to be a bit....gluey and heavy for our taste.

You need to add a little extra milk to the recipe because it comes out to thick as written here. Other than that it was great! My whole family loved it.

These were pretty good, with some alterations.  I used lowfat eggnog, and added about 1/2 cup of skim milk to thin it out.  I "sorta" clarified the butter.  Didn't have a problem with them burning.  They were slightly dense, but had great eggnog flavor.  I'd make this again.

You're so right; even if you don't like eggnog, you will like these delicious pancakes. I made them because my family loves eggnog and I, of course, had to give them a taste. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised! Like the other reviewers, I had to add more liquid as the batter is very thick. Thanks so much!

The pancakes were a win when I made for my friends. I served these at the end when we had two flavors of semi-savory pan cakes so everyone was excited to wrap up the breakfast with the sweet kind. And to my pleasant surprise, they weren't overly sweet.  I altered the recipe a bit by adding half a cup of butter milk to thin the batter and they still came out nice and fluffy. Will make them again for sure.

We tried these pancakes for the first time the other day. True to the description, though I am not at all a fan of eggnog on it's own, I adore these pancakes! And so did my family.  I did find the batter to be a bit too thick with just 1 cup of eggnog, so added another half cup, which did the trick (but that's just me).   I'm recommending these to everyone I know.

I agree with the reviewer before me - could barely taste the nogg but the texture was deliciously light and fluffy. Good stuff! Thanks!

A great way to use up eggnog this season.  These were very tasty!  Very light and fluffy.  I decided to keep the eggnog at 1 cup and added approx 1/4 milk to the batter to make it spreadable, cooking it on med-low heat.  They came out a beautiful golden colour.  This has been added to my recipe box.

I made these for my 11 year old daughter and she LOVED them.  Instead of adding milk to thin out the batter, I added more eggnog.  The batter  WAS thicker than regular pancakes, but they were excellent. We will be making these again.

This was an excellent recipe and the eggnog added wonderful flavour.  I found the proportions too dry and had to add a fair bit of water.  Next time I make it, I will increase the eggnog by up to a cup and add water if needed (just adding water diluted the flavour a bit more than I would have liked).  I would also use half the salt or even just the tiniest pinch.

If you don't like a strong eggnog flavor then you will like these pancakes. I thought these were a little bland, so I added a 1/4 teaspoon of allspice, a dash of cinnamon and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also put some pecans in it to liven it up a bit. With the changes they were nice, but I would add more eggnog if you really enjoy the taste of eggnog.

These were just okay.

I made them as the recipe specified, only I used the Easiest Eggnog from this site. I found the batter to be incredibly thick, and even when I added 
another 1/4 c. of eggnog, it was still 
thick. I also added more nutmeg to the batter. 

If I were to make this again, I would 
use store-bought eggnog and cut it with 
milk OR I would seperate the egg called for in this recipe and whip the white seperately. The batter ended up being overmixed and the pancakes were on the tough side. They have a great flavor. The
recipe just needs to be tweaked.

I have made these twice now and they taste good, but try these changes.  I used veg. oil the second time around because clarifying butter is a drag and I added about 1/2 cup of milk to thin them out.  I cooked them on an electric griddle at about 325.

Not sure why this recipe is so highly reviewed - followed it and ended up with something that was more like cake batter than pancake batter. I tried to save the batch, but ended up having to through out the whole lot. Waste of 1/2 an hour.

Mixed reviews from my family.  I followed the recipe exactly (including the clarified butter) *except* I added 1/4 cup milk to thin the batter a bit and we didn't love them.  The only one who really enjoyed them was my youngest ds, so I'll freeze the leftovers to toast for him.  They weren't bad, by any stretch, the rest of us just didn't love them, and we LOVE eggnog in our house.  Disappointing.  Won't make again.

I added more eggnog because they were to thick  and they cooked  fast on the outside and runny in the middle. I solved that by  giving them 30seconds in the microwave. Flavor was good, but I think I'll try using eggnog coffee syrup in my favorite recipe to achieve the eggnog flavor.

I also had trouble getting them to cook through without burning. Added some milk to make the batter thinner, and omitted the sugar and added cinnamon. I love the idea of eggnog pancakes and they taste great!

We really enjoyed these. I added a half tsp of rum extract and used regular butter. I do always thin my pancake batter as needed so that it bubbles before I flip it. It should not be too thick. Mu hubby loved these!

I saw this and remembered I still had some eggnog left over from Christmas and thought it would be a good way to use it up. I found the batter heavy and the cakes chewy. Like many others I added some milk to thin it out. My son liked them but I like light and fluffy myself…..

These were a nice addition to Christmas breakfast.  One recommendation - use 1/2 milk, 1/2 eggnog, which makes the pancakes a little lighter and fluffier.  The first time, I used only eggnog and the pancakes were good, but a little dense.

Delicious pancakes! The batter was too thick with the above proportions so I added more eggnog until it was a good consistency. This ended up working out even better to give it more of an eggnog flavor! I used melted butter and even added butter to the pan which gave a wonderful flavor and crispy-edge finish to the pancakes. You just have to cook it on a less than medium heat to see that it doesn’t burn. Since it is Christmastime I also added All Spice to the dry ingredients. It was a big hit with the family!

I think the batter was WAY too thick.  I added more eggnog and it was fine.  Traditional pancakes use one cup of milk (or buttermilk) for one cup of flour, and 1.5 cups of eggnog is the right amount for 1.5 cups of flour.

I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  After making these changes, the pancakes were quite good.

Not so great, the batter was so thick I could not spoon it into the pan.  I  added at least 3/4 of a cup of milk to the batter and I still had to flatten it in the pan.  The eggnog flavor was really light, if your making this recipe add additional eggnog spices. I don't recommend this recipe.

ok these are very good however you do need to add at least 1 more cup of nog and another cup of either water or milk to get a pancake consistency. Without the extra fluids it comes out as more of a puffed up cake

They weren't the best pancakes. I had to add milk to get it   the correct consistency, I tasted the batter and there wasn't any flavor. I added pumpkin pie spice which gave it a holiday feel.  The cooking time and fluffiness was great! There was no eggnog taste when eating it   but there was a aftertaste of eggnog and pumpkin pie spice.

Makes delicious pancakes!!

I changed up the recipe a bit, using 3/4 cup of eggnog, 1/4 cup of water, 2 tablespoons of melted butter, and added an extra egg. Was still a little too thick, so I just added a bit more water until it was the correct consistency.

Followed the recipe and they were thicker than the consistency for cookie dough. Took 3x the amount of liquid (eggnog + milk) and another egg to make them runny enough to pour. I would say I'd have been better off winging it than staying with this recipe.

Instructions incomplete. Should the butter be melted first? My daughter, who is not a cook, ruined a batch by putting in cold butter.

I noticed that the consistency was to thick so i had to add 1/2 c more of milk , as i didn't have any eggnog.  But otherwise very good.  Next time i'll make sure  to hid the eggnog from my kids...lol

Way too thick,  I thinned them out and they still burned.  I turned the batter into waffles and they were just OK.

These pancakes were very light and fluffy, no problem with the batter being too thick, I scaled to 8 servings which yielded 10 pancakes with my 2 oz scoop. Unfortunately, they don't taste like eggnog, even though I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as well, but they are good none the less.

I've made this several times in the past three months. Each time I've done it a little different, depending on which eggnog I have on hand. Regular eggnog  pancakes are ok but add1/2 to 1 tsp nutmeg. Now that I discovered that there is pumpkin eggnog out,  I've been making pumpkin eggnog pancakes. I add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin spice to make it taste more like pumpkin

I made like the recipe called for didn't clarify butter added a splash of milk to loosen the batter alittle. Cooked on griddle at 325°.  Came out light and fluffy.  Could faintly taste the eggnog which was a surprise.  Very delicious. Quick easy pancakes.

I have a feeling I messed up with the butter, how does the clarification of butter make them better? They were crazy thick I put tons more milks and eggnog in, and added some vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. They tasted fine but were really dense. Could have been my fault though

These tasted great, but mine needed a bit more egg nog to thin out the batter. As written it was just shy of a dough.

I loved this recipe. I made it with 3 ingredients though, I used 1 cup self-rising flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 1/4 cup of eggnog.  I added chopped walnuts once on the griddle.  Light and fluffy topped pancake with sliced banana, powder sugar, and a dollup of cool whip.  Decadent Christmas Breakfast with bacon and sausage.

Way too thick when made as directed. First pancake was like a brick. I added some 2% milk until I had a better texture. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall the flavor was great, just needed some tweaking to get the right texture, add some milk for a lighter, fluffier outcome!

These are great, but as other reviewers have said, you need to add a lot of milk until batter is the right consistency.  Clarified butter does protect them from burning; since it takes a while for thick pancakes to cook it is worth the extra step.  For a Christmas holiday brunch, offer warmed mincemeat (diluted with apple juice) as a topping.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I ended up with up with a thick dough-like batter instead of a pourable type pancake batter. I added extra milk and eggnog to fix the problem and they turned out okay (I used 2 tbsp of oil instead of clarified butter). Had great flavour, but were still a bit more soft in the middle than I like. So, when you go to make this, just have extra milk and eggnog on hand to add until you get the proper pancake consistency (didn't measure the amount, just added a bit at a time. Adding regular milk will water down the flavour of the eggnog a bit, so that's why I used both regular milk and eggnog). I would garnish with a dollop of whip cream sprinkled with a bit of ground nutmeg if you wanted to fancy them up a bit.

I am an experienced baker and trust me- there is something seriously wrong with this recipe. I followed it exactly- and the batter is way too thick for pancakes. Ended up trying to salvage it with milk- no one would eat them.

I made these for Christmas morning, and I think they've become a new tradition! The batter wasn't runny enough so I needed to adjust a bit there, but other than that these pancakes are great. The eggnog flavor is there, but it's not overwhelming. It's just enough to make it festive! My husband dislikes eggnog, but its flavor was light enough that he could still enjoy these pancakes too!

My family enjoyed this pancake recipe.  I actually made 2 different ‘Eggnog Pancake’ recipes from AR.  I made as written, but didn’t oil the griddle before frying. I placed the batter on a dry griddle.   I think adding the butter to this recipe made the pancakes not rise as high as the other recipe.  They were good, but making both recipes at the same time made us favor the other recipe over this one. I made a double batch and froze them.  My guys just reheated in the microwave for a quick, warm breakfast.

Pretty good! It missed one star though because the batter was too thick. I added some more eggnog to thin it out a bit so it cooked and browned nicely over medium to medium-low heat. You just gotta be patient with these pancakes. Overall, yummy! Will make again. :9

Ater reading several reviews, I prepared the recipe using the full amount of eggnog and substituting oil for clarified butter. The batter was too thick so I added enough milk to thin to our liking.  The first batch of pancakes were fluffy and light but they needed a little more ooomph so we added several gratings of whole nutmeg. Delicious.  The nutmeg made all the difference!

I simply substituted vegetable oil for the clarified butter and added about 1/2 c.  milk to think the batter.   Worked great and they disappeared quickly.
