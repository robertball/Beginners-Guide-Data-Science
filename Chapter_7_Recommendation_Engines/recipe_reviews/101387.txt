Excellent recipe.  It caught my eye and even though I didn't have all the ingredients, the base was there. I had only plain Orange Juice; I had no cherries, I used dried cranberries.  I marinated pork cutlets for about 90 minutes. I had no canned oranges (or fresh) so I used cut up mango.  Other than those really minor exceptions, this came together as an excellent meal. For a side dish, I par-boiled bite-size chunks of potatoes, tossed with a couple of tbsp veg oil and parmesan cheese, and browned them on the BBQ (in a tin foil plate for easy cleanup). The grill marks on the meat looked prefect.  Excellent meal.  I could have have used a shake or two of salt, but my husband, who always is reaching for the salt shaker, pronounced it perfect.  The next time I may add feta cheese to the dish.  The only thing that left me wondering is why the recipe descriptor started off "All is not lost".
