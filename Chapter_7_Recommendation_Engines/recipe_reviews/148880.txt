Through trial and error I have come up with the way I make my guacamole and once I thought I had it perfected I never deviated from it--until now. Loved the idea of the bacon!  I mean, what isn't better with bacon? For the most part I followed the recipe, but added half of a fresh jalapeno pepper, minced, the juice of a lime, and 1/2 tsp. each of cumin and dried cilantro.  Just with the addition of bacon alone, this is very good, but still basic. Playing with this a bit and making it your own takes this from very good to excellent. I think bacon in my guacamole will be a permanent addition!

Good idea with the bacon bits. I suggest also adding a minced scallion.

This is closest to my favorite from an old Lawry's brand recipe that used their Seasoned Salt and Seasoned Pepper.  Spritz top with lemon or lime juice to keep avocado from turning grey before serving.

I used a 6 slices of bacon instead of 4 (to use up the rest of a package), and it was pretty tasty. Then I added (per Naples34102's review) 1/2 teaspoon each dried cilantro and cumin, 1/2 large jalape√±o and the juice of a lime, and it was even better. I used it on carnitas.
