I changed the serving size to 24 on this and baked them in a regular 9 X 13 pan for about 18 or 19 minutes (just until the top gets golden). They are PERFECT. I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe. They were so good I had one for breakfast with my morning coffee today.

These brownies were so easy to make and turned out very moist and delicious! 
I used 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and sprinkled
chopped nuts on top...I'm not the biggest fan of butterscotch and nuts (I made
these for a friend) but even I couldn't resist these brownies! I will definitely 
save this recipe and make them again!

I followed the recipe exactly (I feel like these days, that is a rare thing).  These turned out moister than any chocolate brownies I've ever made from scratch.  I did without the chocolate chips and still delicious.  Next time, I will probably spread a layer of Nutella spread to the top as icing.  Definitely a keeper!

One of my family's new favorites.  Very easy to make and sooo good to eat.  I wrapped them individually in saran wrap and they have lasted for well over a week.  We have been eating them for the holiday and as snacks to bring along with us shopping.  Very quick and easy to make.  Melt in your mouth when they are first cut and still extremely good when completely cool.

Great recipe! Will definitely use again. My husband loved them and said not to bother looking for another recipe, better than his mother's he claims. =) Easy to make, came out perfect, taste great!

I changed the servings to 24 and used a 9x13 pan and baked for 20min. They were delicious! So soft and chewy and yummy. Quick and easy to make too with ingredients that are usually on hand. I will definitely be making these again!

Very good. You do need a deeper and larger pan then the jelly roll pan though.

I used butter scotch morsels and chopped pecans.  About 11oz of each.  Baked in a 9x13 glass pyrex.  They came out almost perfect.  The very middle needed an extra 5 minutes even thought the coloring on the outside was perfect after 25 minutes.  They had the consistency, look and feel of a banana nut bread.  Not cake (as others have mentioned) or a dense moist brownie.  Flavor was amazing.  The first one I ate hot out of oven tasted like a pancake and maple syrup brownie.  Sooo goooood.

I thought these were great and the fam ate them up very quickly. I did as another reviewer suggested and converted the recipe to yield 24 brownies so the batter fit into my 9x13 pan. Worked like a charm; took 28 minutes to cook in my oven.

Very good! Hubby stuffed himself with four of these before he had to stop for milk. I had to cook them a bit longer than stated, another 8 minutes. My pan was only a quarter sheet size (9x13) so it was too full, but it didn't affect the taste any and my family didn't care how these look.

Made this recipe for a family get-together and for my sunday school class (made the 36 brownies but cut them all up into brownie "bites") and got raving reviews. I baked in a 9x13 pyrex glass baking dish and when I took it out at 25 minutes it was still a little "gooey" in the middle so I cooked it for another 4-5 minutes before it was finished. I also did 1/2 a package of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 a package of butterscotch chips and it was excellent. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is not a bad recipe, but I was disappointed in that the texture was more like a cake than the dense brownie-like cookie that I had made before from a different recipe.

I have tried several Blondie recipes, and this one is by far the best! Moist, chewy, and lots of good flavor. I used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet in the batter, and I added a cup of chopped pecans. I baked it 20 minutes in a 15 x 10 air bake jelly roll pan, and after baking I drizzled a cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate on top. Excellent!

I made these over the Memorial Day weekend for a picnic. Everybody enjoyed them. My pickie son even liked them and he doesn't like blonde brownies; I think it was the 1/2 Cup chocolate chips that I put in. I also put in 1/2 cup butterscotch chips too; like on of the other users did. This will be a keeper. =) =)

Exactly what a blondie should be.  Easy recipe that my 11yo can make without parental involvement.  Tasty enough to share with guests and friends!

Holy cow! I can now, FINALLY, make my favorite brownie recipe at home...I changed a few things like taking half chocolate and half white chocolate instead of the full 16oz. of just semi-sweet. I also added finely chopped pecans to the recipe. Topped with Vanilla bean ice-cream and a drizzle of hot caramel...It's far better than the ones you buy at a restaurant for almost & bucks... Beat that Ruby Tuesdays!

It was dense, but good. I like blonde brownies to be a touch lighter, and these just were plain *dense* HOWEVER... they were still very yummy!

Fabulous recipe!!  I turned these blondies into caramel chocolate chip blonde brownies.  Pour 2/3 of your batter into your baking dish and bake for 8-10 mins.  Then take your brownies out and pour one bag of melted caramels over and the remaining brownies mixture.  Swirl everything together and bake for 10-15 more minutes or until they come out clean with a toothpick.  Absolutely heavenly and such yummy goodness!!  :)

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for in a Blondie - chewy, moist and dense.  I wanted a thicker one and made these in a 9x13 and baked for a total of 30 minutes and they came out perfectly.  They were very quick to put together and my 3 1/2 year old loved helping.  I will be making these again!

I've used this recipe for a long time, it's awesome. Do use a  9x13 baking dish, gets you deeper brownies. Other than that, don't change a thing.

Fantastic bar-I used milk chocolate and added 1/2 cup of mini morsel semi-sweet.  The combination of the two kinds of chocolate coupled with the extra chips made this delicious.  I too used a 9x13 pan and increased the cook time to 27 minutes.

Loved these blonde brownies!  I used white chocolate chips and they were to die for.  I had to give these away to friends so I would not eat them all.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!!

Ahh... the traditional Toll House Blonde Brownie. Just sweet enough and butterscotch-y! I had trouble spreading the dough into a VERY large pan, so make sure you spread out the dough lots when putting in the pan so you don't have to spread it as far. It kinda skates around otherwise.

These came out good but not what I expected. They had a butterscotch flavor which was yummy, but instead of being chewy like a brownie, they were more like a cake. I didn't put the chocolate chips in as I had none. But I think that butterscotch chips might be better. Next time I will buy those and add them. Maybe if I had used 2 eggs and less baking powder these blondies would have come out chewy and not baked up so high.

This is a never fail recipe and makes a big batch for gatherings.  I usually use half semi sweet chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips for a twist.  Great tasting.

These were good.  I used m&m's to make them more like the Barn*** and No**** blondie.  Thinking I may have overbaked them though as they were a bit more firm than I would have liked.

Awesome. This is not a sophisticated dessert. But it is delicious. I made as written except I didn't have a jelly roll pan so baked in an 11x9 baking dish for about 37 minutes. These were literally inhaled in minutes.

I made a batch of these plus a batch of regular brownies (Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies from Allrecipes) -- cut them into squares then used small cookie cutters do transfer and make mix-up brownies with blonde & chocolate.  They were amazing!!  GREAT recipe, definitely saving it!

I just made these for a friend for Chanukah- so I made one change. I switched the chocolate chips for York Peppermint pieces, since they're blue and white. 
SO GOOD! I'm hoping I can hold off on eating them all, otherwise I'll have none left to give.
I'm curious now to make them with the other flavors of Hersheys pieces, I bet they would all be pretty good.

These were just ok. They were bland and kind of chalky in consistency. I doubled the recipe and added walnuts to half - that half was better. Maybe more chocolate would have helped, or maybe another egg or two? I didn't get that caramelesque, butterscotchy flavor in the description. :(

These were great! I replaced the brown sugar with white sugar and the butter with olive oil. Also added about a cup of chopped walnuts. Could have reduced the sugar by about a third or half, perhaps.

These are excellent.  I doubled the batch and substituted unsweetened applesauce for all of the margarine, and used unrefined sugar in place of the brown sugar.  I also put in one package of chocolate chips and one package of butterscotch chips, reserved 1/3 cup of each and sprinkled those on top of the batter.  Turned out great!

These brownies are more like cake, and mine turned out very dry. The flavor is good, but they need more moisture. I even added maybe a tbsp of oil and 2-3 tbsp of sour cream because the batter was more crumbly and then it  turned into the consistency of cookie dough, unlike the usual runny batter.

These were excellent.  I did add the chocolate chips but my family has requested I leave them out next time.   I also made the Maple Butter Frosting recipe on this site to put on top and they were great, both with the frosting and without.

this was a great recipie!!! it is soooo tasty, but i would NOT say that it is easy. actually, it was quite hard. the batter was stiff and not creamy, like it is supposed to be. and this took forever to bake!!! finall, after 90 MINUTES OF BAKING it was ready! thsi was ridiculous! but if you are in the mood for a tasty treat that is hard to make, this is for you!!!

This was exactly what I was looking for. However I'm not a maple bar lover so I really was looking for a chocolate chip cookiebar recipe that I could use this one worked but for some reason I taste maple and I don't know why. I added walnuts and used 3 oz of semi-sweet baking bars cut up (was all I had). I also used a white whole wheat flour and it didn't seem to affect the flavor. I also put it in a 9x13" jelly roll pan for 20 min and it came out perfect.

Great! Just like a big cakey choco-chip cookie. I used a 9x13 pan and it took 23 minutes. I wouldn't want to use a jelly-roll pan. These came out nice and soft and everyone loved them. Would be a great bake sale item.

I made these brownies and they turned out a little dry and not as chewy as I would have liked them. I cooked them for the full 25 minutes and while they looked like they  ere cooked perfectly perhaps I cooked them too much and that's why they were dry?  I only used half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips and added a cup of macadamia nuts.  And while the flavor was great, I will continue to search for a blonde brownie recipe that has a better texture.

I cannot believe how good these were.  I was looking for a quick dessert to make for an impromptu family dinner.  I made mine exactly as the recipe stated.  The only change I made was I used half a bag of milk chocolate chips and half a bag of white chocolate chips.  I also didn't measure them. I was just finishing off my leftover bags of chips that I had in my freezer, so it probably was a bit more than the 8 oz. but there were no complaints.  I baked them in a 9x13 baking dish, and forgot to check the time when I put them in the oven, but I just checked them.  I do know that I pulled them out when they started to pull away from the pan and brown on the edges, but I did the toothpick test, and they weren't done yet.  So, I just let them sit on top of the stove for about 10 minutes and then put them back in for another 5-10 minutes, retested and they were perfect.  I also used some sticks of margarine instead of butter, and they were still great.  I'm sure that they'd be even better with butter, because what isn't better with butter?  Oh, and keep husbands and kids away when it's in the batter state, because they will want to eat the batter.  (It is really that good.  lol)

I made these for a community meeting and was asked for the recipe.  They are delicious and very easy to make and I will definitely make them again.  The only thing I added was to sprinke some toasted chopped hazelnuts on top that I had on hand from the King Athur Flour catalog.   Otherwise I used the recipe just as is.  Definitely a keeper.

Recipe is the bomb! I didn't have the right size pan so I increased the servings to 48 and cooked for 30 min. the pan was approx. 13x18

Cooked again and did a mix of butterscotch chips and chocolate chip...supper rich (especially when you use the whole bag) but yummy.

These were moist and delicious - I used butter and cooked them in a 9x13 glass pan for about 30 min. in a convection oven at 325 degrees.  Mmmm!  The kids (and my husband!) loved them!!!

These were sensational! We used half a bag of white chocolate in place of semi-sweet because that was all we had and these brownies were AMAZING. Trying it out with the semi-sweet today!

I love how fast these were to put together -- especially since we had company coming.  I underbaked them a little more than I intended, so they seemed very rich, but were better the next day.  The butter flavor was a little overpowering, though, I thought.

These looked beautiful when pulled out of the oven but I was a little disappointed as they were too dry for what I was hoping to get -something chewy and gooey.  To remedy, I poked holes throughout and poured some condensed milk over top.  It added moisture and sweetness.  Delish!!

Made two time this week, both times gone & quick! I made this as previous note changed to 24 servings & in 13 x 9 non-stick pan 20-23 minutes. The only change was 1/4 tsp. butter flavoring in addition to the vanilla (even though I used real butter) & Splenda brown sugar blend instead reg. brown sugar.

I was looking for a blondie recipe, thought I found one for cookie bars, and ended up with something more like a heavy cake.  The batter was very thick which I wasn't expecting for a brownie batter. I tried swirling caramel and fudge through which improved it a bit. I will not try again

These are excellent! I followed the recipe exactly though I did use a 9x13 pan as suggested. They are nice and moist, I would suggest waiting for them to completely cool before cutting them into squares, otherwise it ends up looking like a chocolate mess. My children loved them and are already asking me to make more!

I'm confused as to why this recipe has received such great ratings; these taste nothing like the blondies I grew up eating.  The batter was delicious, so I was excited, but the end result was the texture of a slightly dry cake. The taste is good, but this isn't what I was looking for.

I used all butter and the result was a little too buttery rich for me.  Next time I'll use half butter and half margarine.  Otherwise, this turned out good and I will definitely bake it again.

Not a blond brownie.  Made as other suggested in 9x13.  Way too gooey. Should of been a bit sweeter maybe?  Wont make again.

We made these for the Super Bowl.  Days later people were still asking for more, but they were all eaten in about 24 hours!  Lining bottom of the 15x10 tray with parchment paper made these bars easy to remove and cut.

I changed the serving size to 24 and used a 9X13 pan like another reviewer suggested and must not have baked them long enough because the middle turned out kind of soggy.  But, the edge pieces are awesome!  I added butterscoth chips in with the chocolate. YUM!!!  I can't wait to try them again with just the chocolate!

These were very yummy!  However, they did resemble bar cookies and not blonde brownies, they tasted almost exactly like the nestle toll house cookies.  But no matter, they were yummy and we devoured them!!

These were really good.  I made them once the way that they are written in order to give an accurate rating, and my rating is based on that.  Since then, I've adapted it to make it a bit more health conscious (albeit still very much a "dessert")  my only changes have been to use Whole Wheat **Pastry** Flour (slightly pack the cup when measuring) in place of AP flour, and Sucanat (heaping in measuring cup) in place of the brown sugar.  Throwing in a high quality chocolate chip doesn't hurt, either (I used Ghiradelli). My family loves it just as much this way, and honestly hasn't even noticed the difference.  This is typically the case, as those two ingredients have proven in my home to be pretty precise stand-in's for the one's that I've swapped them for in this and every recipe (slightly packed WW Pastry = AP flour; heaping Sucanat = packed Brown sugar).  And it just plain feels a little better serving them such an indulgent treat when I know that the fiber and the non-refined sugar won't shoot their blood sugar into oblivion.  Just some FYI for people pondering what healthy adaptations can be made w/o altering the taste/texture.

I absolutely love this recipe. One thing that you could change (not necessary just depends on how you like it) is to bake it in a 9/ 13 pan for 30 minutes. They're a little bit thicker. Just make sure to check them often so they don't burn. Happy baking!

This is a great brownie! There is defiantly more to be desired when it comes to the sweetness of the blonde mix. I would suggest 1 cup 7oz packed brown sugar to give it just a little more of a sweet kick. Also i used milk chocolate chips as it also sweetened up the mix.

The dough was a little too thick so I added 1/2 cup of water and increased the baked 10 minutes longer. They were perfect... Will make for family gatherings

These were good, but didn't have that dense, almost gooey middle that is typical of a blonde brownie/ blondie.Going to try another recipe next time.

These are delicious, don't get me wrong, but I'm quite disappointed in the texture. I remember blondies were denser and chewier like a brownie. This taste like a very nice cake. I'm afraid I'll have to continue looking for the elusive blondie of my past!

This is my favorite most requested brownie recipe and has been for years. However, the above sugar amounts are wrong or have been decreased to make it "healthier". I have the Original Toll House Cookbook. All ingredient amounts are correct, except the sugars, which should be: 1 1/4 C light brown sugar & 1 1/4 C white sugar. They bake in the same size pan for the same amount of time and will come up much gooier/more brownie-like.

I have made this recipe twice so far. The 1st time exactly (EXACT. LY) as written. Great. The second time w/ 1 cup mini semi-sweet morsels and 1 cup milk choc chips (everything else the same). Great again! LOVE that it makes a lot. My daughter has a PN allergy, so I use other brands of choc chips with no issue (merp, can not use Nestle Toll House anything with cross contamination warnings). FYI, the dough will be thick; spread as best as you can to the edges of your pan, and it will rise/ fill in as it bakes. I used the pan called for, Baking PAM, and a bench cutter to get a precise edge/cut. These freeze beautifully. Wrap your cooled  blondie in loads of plastic wrap, label, and freeze. Can not go wrong.

Taste was OK; not quite as good as Mom's recipe...results were crumbly bars. Like many other reviews have stated it is kinda like a chocolate chip cookie, but dry.

this recipe is very similar to 'chango bars'.  When it comes to blondies, you don't need quite so many chocolate chips.  Because there is such a high sugar and fat to flour ratio, these are richer than a cookie.  Like a brownie without a chocolate base, the chips highlight without taking over.  These turn out so moist and if covered properly, (airtight container), they are firm yet still gooey the next day. After spreading batter into the jellyroll pan, I cover half of the surface with crushed walnuts, that way those not wanting nuts can clearly see which pieces contain them. Good recipe but it's worth googling "chango bars" as they are a little better in my opinion.

This is definitely a 5-star recipe in my book. This is my go-to dish whether I'm in the mood for a sweet treat or making dessert for others. I personally like to add chopped pecans or walnuts and a teaspoon of almond extract. Delicious!

Much more like cake than brownies or blondies.  I was hoping for a dense cookie/brownie like consistency.  Taste pretty good but not what I was looking for.

This is very close to being the same recipe on the back of a bag of Nestle Semi Sweet morsels for chocolate chip cookies nix the white sugar. It is really good which is why I gave it 5 stars. Both of my boys loved them and I had never thought to put them in brownie form but I don't see where you'd get a butterscotch or caramel flavor out of it. It really is nothing but a giant chocolate chip cookie.

These were pretty good. Not really as chewy as I was looking for, but at the last minute I realized my jelly roll pan was MUCH larger than the recipe called for so I switched to a 9x13 glass baking dish (baked 26 minutes) and I wound up with tender, soft, chocolate chippy (and walnutty) goodness. I was looking for something a little tougher and chewier, strangely enough.   This reminded me a lot of a thick chocolate chip cookie. Now ... don't get me wrong: that IS tasty. And it WAS easier than dipping out a lot of chocolate chip cookies. However it was still missing that "Blondie" feel to me. I'll try this again in the correct pan and see if it yields better results. Maybe tomorrow they'll be a little chewier too.   I roasted about a cup of whole walnuts and then chopped them into pieces to add. WOW. That really lifted the flavor up. I wish I wasn't out of almond extract because it would have been yummy in these.   If you read the other reviews and were nervous that these would be too dry I'd recommend baking them like I did in the deeper pan. These were great. Also... for those who are getting dryer, tougher results than they'd like... you could be over mixing and over handling your dough/batter or adding too much flour. Search on goggle for instructions on how to properly measure flour. :)  A note: I thought the batter was looking too thick when I was mixing it up but it did fine. I'm glad I refrained from adding a tablespoon of milk.

I rated this 4 out of 5 stars because this recipe is a little bit dry for me. Here's the recipe my Mom shared with me that she's tweaked here and there to get a very moist, decadent blonde brownie!   Measure 2 c. flour.  Add 1 t. baking powder, 1/4 t. soda, 1 t. salt, 1 c. chopped nuts and set aside.  Melt 1 c. margarine in saucepan; remove from heat.  Add 2 c. brown sugar and mix well.  Add 2 slightly beaten eggs and 2 t. vanilla.   Blend.  Add flour mixture, a small amount at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Spread in greased pan and sprinkle with 1 pkg. chocolate chips.  Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Do not overbake.  :) Enjoy!

These bars were delicious. I baked them in a 13" x 9" pyrex pan for 30 minutes, they definitely could have used an additional 5 minutes, they were slightly  undercooked.

Easy instructions, delicious result.  My only complaint was that the yield was way off (20 instead of 36), however, I think my pan may have been the wrong size, since after 25 minutes they were still uncooked in the middle. Will make again and would recommend.

Easy and delicious recipe. Made a few changes...used half butterscotch chips and half peanut butter chips and baked in a 9x9 pan. Cooking time was adjusted due to the thickness of the brownies and I baked these approximately 15 minutes or so longer than called for in the original recipe. A new favorite; will make this recipe again and again.

Oh so good.  Used Nestle chocolate chunks instead of chips and used an 8 x 8 pan.  These are so good and I am too full!!  Thank you

I made these because they had such a high rating but they were very dry and not at all sweet.  Very disappointing.  I thought I must have done something wrong, but we reviewed the recipe and know that we followed it to the letter.  They looked wonderful, but we couldn't even eat them.

Absolutely delicious, just as written!  They smelled so good while they were baking that I expected all the neighbors to come knocking on our door!

I have made this recipe several times and loved them.  This time I was disappointed because I used the 15x10 inch pan and the blondies were a little flat.  I think the 9x13 pan made a more brownie like product.  This time mine were more like a sliced toll house cookie (not much to complain about there) than a thick brownie.  I still gave this recipe 5 stars because they are really good and my husbands all time favorite.  From now on I will use the smaller pan.

This recipe was fantastic! They disappeared very quickly in our house! I substituted one of the eggs for  1 TBLS flax seed meal and 3 TBLS water for those all important omega 3's.   I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cups regular sugar because of what I had on hand-- but they were so good this way I would make them exactly the same next time.

These were good but not quite as flavorful as I would have hoped. I did use a smaller pan since I don't have a jelly roll one and it did take along time to cook, at least 45 minutes because the center was just raw. I was worried at first since the dough is EXTREMELY thick, like cookie dough and was worried there wouldn't be enough to spread over the entire pan, but it did bake up alot.  I would make again with some added flavorings.

I thought this recipe resembled a bar cookie and not a blonde brownie. Although it tasted ok, it was nothing like the blonde brownies I have made in the past, it was just to airy, not nearly dense enough.

These were pretty good; I found the texture closer to a thick cookie, then brownie-like.

Very good.  I would cut in half, though.  It made a whole cookie sheet full!

I made these brownies for a large organization, and was a little disappointed.  Though they were very appealing to look at, they lacked the sweetness that regular brownies have.  I'll probably stick with regular brownies from now on.
