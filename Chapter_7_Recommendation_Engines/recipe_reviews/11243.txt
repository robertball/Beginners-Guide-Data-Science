These are great cookies that I've been making for years. I think the recipe should say 'roll to 1/8th of an inch in thickness' as opposed to 1/2 (which would give you really thick cookies). Sometimes the dough is too dry to roll easily- feel free to add as much cream as necessary to get a dough of good rolling consistency- otherwise, the cookies will have a tough texture. Also, MAKE SURE to prick the cookies! One time I didn't, and they blew up like balloons.

These were so good. I understand what the other reviewer was saying, but these are tea cookies so they should not be too sweet. We really loved them!

overall the cookies were okay. The frosting was really good but the cookie just had a really weird texture. It didn't have much flavor either so i added some almond extract. Good, but bland.

Ours turned out very tender and light, so much so that they were falling apart when we frosted them. My 6 year old helped and we had a good time. The kids did not like them though so I probably will not make them again. Update: A few were left for the next day and they were much better after they had sat and the frosting really held them together.
