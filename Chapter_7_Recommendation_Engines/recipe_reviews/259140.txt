Sorry to be in the minority, but this was not as good as it could be. I tried it as was written & it was not what I expected or aiming for. Get rid of some unneeded ingredients. There is no reason to add that much butter (or, any butter). You already get plenty of salt from the smoked salmon- no need for a greasy filler. Instead, add 1/2 cup sour cream. It will give you the consistency of a spread, mixed with the cream cheese. Since the salmon has PLENTY of salt, you really only need to add the dill & a small dash of the Worcestershire. Do NOT add liquid smoke! That should not be needed if you are using proper SMOKED salmon. And with that, using a minimum of 6-8oz of smoked salmon is necessary. Otherwise, you have double the base & only 4oz of what is supposed to be giving the dish an actual personality & flavor. Don’t cheat on the salmon, and don’t overdo the extras- a good salmon dip is best with the least- from a born & raised Alaskan who grew up on this dish. 
Last, but not the least- refrigerate the dip for a minimum of 1hour prior to serving for all flavors to mesh & the best consistency for serving multiples.

Absolutely delicious! I made this exactly as written, except that I just threw all the ingredients in my mini food processor/chopper. A couple pulses later, and everything was mixed perfectly. Everyone who tried this was impressed. I follow a ketogenic lifestyle and this is the perfect addition. For my guests that aren't keto, I served this with a variety of crackers.  I will eat the leftovers with hollowed out mini cucumber halves. Yum!

Used a can (5 oz) of salmon and pretty much followed the recipe. The salmon was “tuna style” so no bones or skin, and not smoked so I add more than a few drops of liquid smoke (closer to 1/4 tsp smoke), left off the butter and only had half and half instead of whipping cream.  I was looking for a snack so my husband and I did not refrigerate, but dusted almost the entire batch. Next time I make it will try to refrigerate to see what it tastes once everything has gelled together, then I come back and change the rating... smack!

I made this for a football tailgate.  I served it with veggies and rice crackers.  Crackers were a bigger hit than veggies.  Everyone loved the dip!!  It went quickly!  I will make this again.  My husband catches salmon oh plenty and we smoke most of it-  this is a great alternative to just salmon and crackers.

I followed the directions pretty close.  Maybe a little more than three ounces of salmon.  It turned out amazing.  I have made it three times now.
