These muffins are delicious all of my family and friends loved them! I substituted the truvia baking blend for regular granulated white sugar and I used 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup truvia baking blend! I used Craisins and just re-hydrated them before chopping them up and adding them to the mixture!

Sooo soft and fluffy and flavorful! I used 2/3c of real sugar as other reviewers said, and my family loves them.

I made this recipe substituting 1 cup of Splenda for 1/3 cup of Truvia (Splenda measures the same as sugar), butter-flavored Crisco, and whole wheat flour to make it a bit more healthy. These are some of the best muffins I've ever had, and they were low on guilt! I'll definitely be making these again!

In a rush, I made this with self-rising flour....oops.  It came out fairly salty, but still edible, so if topped with cream cheese frosting, it would actually balance out really well.
I didn't quite understand why baking soda, salt AND baking powder were required, but went with it anyway.  I also didn't have access to fresh berries, so had to go with sweetened dried instead.

I would recommend a more intense orange flavor and maybe more cranberries.

This was not a hard Recipe to make.  I used 2/3 cup of Sugar, 1/2 cup of Whole Milk, Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice and Fresh Grated Orange Peel, and Fresh Chopped Cranberries.  The Muffin, with its perfect crowns (you need to make sure that your Flour, Baking Powder, and Baking Soda are fresh) turned out so beautiful and delicious.

I tried this recipe and although it tasted good it didn't look all that spectacular and didn't get a nice crown like I wanted. In fact even though I filled the cups full instead of making a nice crown they just kind of dripped over the sides. I want my muffins to have a good top and this one had no top to say. I agree with punkster, not worth the trouble.

These muffins were delicious, light, moist and Yummy!  I didn't have fresh or frozen cranberries, so I soaked craisins in Fusion cranberry/blackberry juice for a few hours to plump up a little and then strained them.  They worked great.

These were pretty good! I used 2/3 cup granulated sugar as recommended by another reviewer as well as dried cranberries. They were a little bit dry, but the flavor was terrific! I would definitely make these again.

I substituted the Truvia for 2/3 c. regular granulated sugar (as determined by the Truvia equivalency chart). The muffins turned out to be a great consistency and they were sweet enough. I also substituted the cranberries for Craisins dried cranberries (a 5 oz. bag, chopped). Turned out great, can't wait to try them again!!

I just finished making these and they turned out extremely bland. I don't know where it went wrong. I used craisins as many reviewers did, but I rehydrated them in orange juice for an extra citrus kick. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not getting any orange flavor or even any sweetness. Maybe I should try using actual sugar next time, but I don't know if there will be a next time.

I used 2/3 cup of sugar in place of the Truvia. The first time I made them they were dry so I added 1 cup apple sauce. I found that whole Craisins worked well.  Baking time about 10 minutes.  They were moist and delicious!

I used granulated white sugar. 2/3 cup as another baker stated.  And I used whole wheat flour. Made 12 muffins and a round ramekin.

I tweaked the recipe slightly, doing as others by replacing the Truvia with 2/3 cup granulated sugar and  also with my add-ins:    1/2 cup of drained canned mandarin oranges chopped and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  I shortened the baking time by about 5 minutes (times will vary by pan type and color, oven temp fluctuations, etc). The muffins turned out moist with a soft crumb. I love the citrusy orange flavor combined with the tangy cranberries and the nutty crunch of the pecans. They are wonderful as is, however, I wanted some of them a bit sweeter so I made a glaze using confectioner's sugar, orange extract and a bit of water with one drop each of yellow and red floor coloring.   Everything was mixed together for a lovely orange glaze that I drizzled over the tops of half of the slightly warm muffins.  The dear sweet hubby loved both variations.  These are wonderful with your morning coffee and just as great as an afternoon snack with cold milk.

My favorite changes to this recipe are to soak my craisins in any extra orange juice I squeeze out and to use 1/2 cup sugar and 2 Tablespoons of honey. I also zest the whole orange because we love the extra flavor!
