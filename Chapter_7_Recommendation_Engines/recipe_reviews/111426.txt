I meant to review this sooner but plain forgot! I went on a hunting trip with my male friend and cooked this recipe with the grouse he shot. First of all we took the meat off the bones and "bled" it to get rid of the game-y taste (just soak in salted water overnight in the fridge). When I cooked this the next night and let him taste a piece before dinner he said "Oh my God that's the best thing I've ever eaten." In other words we loved this recipe! It compliments the game bird perfectly. I cooked it exactly like it's written and I honestly can't wait to make it again.

With apologies to MommyFromSeattle I only made the sauce and not the grouse but the sauce is excellent! I have not eaten grouse but I know this would make a superb complement to pheasant. Since I was not using the sauce to cook grouse I reduced it till it was syrupy then drizzled it over risotto cakes from another website. I used apricot preserves but I can't wait to try it with peach--it was so good!

This was my first time making grouse and it was so good! I took the advice of another reviewer and brined the bird overnight which may have been why it didn't taste in the least bit gamey.

I used this recipe for two Chukar partridge which are normally pretty well received by my family in any fried or sauteed form. Everyone loved this preparation so I'll probably be expected to go to achieve this level of flavor and sophistication for future game birds. I did not soak them in buttermilk. I doubled the sauce and simmered the birds covered for about 15 minutes after a quick browning. Used apricot preserves and extra garlic which I reintroduced with the bird pieces. Next time I will probably salt and pepper the partridge before cooking. Excellent recipe!

Outstanding. One suggestion...hammer the grouse breasts flat....the bird is dry and this allows for greater sauce surface area.

We made this sauce to go with quail. We found the tarragon flavor to be rather pronounced and it overpowered the quail. Even though our quail came from a hunt they were very mild almost like chicken. Perhaps the tarragon flavor is better suited to birds with a more gamey flavor.

We doubled the ingredients for the sauce. It was a little too buttery so if we do it again (and I'm sure we will!) I'll not put in as much butter.

Very good recipe I made it with pheasant and tweaked the ingredients a little. I added 1/2 cup of peach jam and 1/2 c of chicken stock to yield more sauce. I served it with rice and green beans it was a big hit with the kids. I will make it again.

I loved this! Sear the grouse breast quickly then cook it in the sauce I found 3 minutes on med-high per side made it tough. And I didn't have peach preserves so I used Adriatic Fig Spread and it tasted great with the balsamic.

I made this with pheasant and it was awesome! I will definitely make this again and I plan to try it with duck. The sauce was delicious. The tarragon really enhanced the flavor.

I used a Chardonnay in place of sherry and added a drizzle of raw organic honey at the last minute and then thickened the sauce into a gravy by adding tiny increments of flour and whisking and then another splash of chicken broth... served it with a medley of roasted beets potatoes broccoli onion and spices. Not bad for my first grouse! The sweetness of the peach balsamic was a nice contrast to the game-ishness of the bird. Overall lovely.

Wish I would have read the reviews. I would have also soaked them in salted water overnight. Very important to season and/or salt and pepper before preparing. Sauce was great.

Fantastic. Changed it slightly. Used mango pepper jam since I wanted a little spice. Used Reisling wine and 1/2 teaspoon dried taragon. Used pheasant rather than grouse. Will absolutely make it again. Best pheasant I have ever made.

I made this for my roommates with a few changes. I used chicken instead of grouse and apricot instead of peach jam. It was so good. Everyone loved it and I will be making it again for sure.

I slightly modified your recipe since I didn't have peach or apricot jam. I used my homemade pepper jelly which works quite well and served the dish with roasted fall veggies.
