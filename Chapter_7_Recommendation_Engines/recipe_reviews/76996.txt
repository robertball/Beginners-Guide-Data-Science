At first I was weary of this...but it was sooo good!, I didn't change a thing.  The ketchup mixture is awesome!!!  I made it exactly as it said and my entire family just loved it!

I asked my husband to rate this.  We didn't think this was bad, but we didn't think it was very good either.  It definitely needs something with more substance -- some more flavor.  If I try this again, I'll oven roast the potatoes (in bigger pieces), add some garlic and rosemary to the ham mixture, and toss it all together.

This was very good and very colorful using both kinds of potatoes.  I did precook the cubed potatoes just a bit before I added them to the skillet since we do like our potatoes soft.  I am not a fan of dijon mustard but I couldn't even tell it was in there.

Easy and delicious.  I used a bit more of all the seasonings than called for, and garlic salt in place of salt, but that was all I changed.  I was worried the potatoes would be raw in the middle, but they were perfect.  I love how you can do the prep while you're cooking.

This is delicious.  I had to omit the sweet potatoes, as I was out, and therefore cut down the ham to about half a pound, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy and doesn't take long at all.  I also put this in a tortilla with some shredded cheese and voila---you have a tasty breakfast burrito!  I will be making this again.

This was really good even though I goofed.  Bought ham ends at the deli (always less expensive) It wound up being hot ham!  The men and teenagers liked it... but the younger kids...Not so much.  Will try again with regular ham.

Intersting flavor. Made this for dinner. Wasn't impressed. But I had leftovers for breakfast. Tasted much better and more enjoyable.

The flavors in this dish really worked well together.  I was a bit leary about the ketchup, but it really tastes great!

This was very good.  My daughter is allergic to mustard so I used a bit of cider vinegar.  I also cooked some diced celery with the onions.

Loved this. This was a standard hash, with some nice twists. The addition of sweet potato and Dijon  changed this up nicely. My only change was to use Canadian bacon in this

I make only one change to this recipe, using all sweet potatoes and no white potatoes. Having made the recipe three times, I have to say it is absolutely wonderful the first day, and as left-overs. Originally I used left-over Honey Baked Ham, but have now used a ham steak, and can say both are splendid. Adding some of the glaze from the honey-baked gave it a hint of sweet-spice that was very nice, but even without that, it is delicious. Thanks for a great recipe that doesn't require ten tweaks to make it good.

This was an easy and tasty meal.  Only changes were added 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper and omitted the 2 tablespoons of water. Made this for supper but it would be great for breakfast served with poached eggs.

I have made this a couple times already.  Once with sweet potatoes and once with regular baby red potatoes.  Very delicious.

This was very good and everyone enjoyed it. I diced up one jalapeno pepper with the potatoes which gave it a little zip.

Really delicious! I used just sweet potatoes, put cheddar cheese on top, and added an over easy egg.  Yum!!
