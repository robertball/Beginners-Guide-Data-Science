Excellent. Easy to do and a great way to utilize any fresh fruit you have to hand; we used peaches, plums, strawberries and banana. A great breakfast recipe.

Fun recipe!  It was very easy to make.  We used strawberries and bananas for our fruit, and it tasted and looked great.

This one is a winner!  So far, I have only prepared this in a "half-sized" version (used a 6" skillet, and reduced the cooking time a bit); the result was delicious, attractive, and very impressive for the minor time and effort involved.  I look forward to serving it to houseguests. (Warning: Watch out for the hot skillet handle!!)

This has been a hit with my daughters!  I had a verson of this dish a few years ago while visiting my friends and all of our kids wanted seconds! And I feel like they get a bunch of protein in the morning when they have a slice of this.  I didn't use as much butter as the recipie called for because the first time I did and it turned out too buttery(yes-something can be too buttery!!).  I also used apples the second time around and dusted it with cinnamon and sugar!  Yum!  This is a weekend ritual!

This is fantastic! I have made this twice now-once with peaches and strawberries and then with cinnamon apples. Definately a keeper!
