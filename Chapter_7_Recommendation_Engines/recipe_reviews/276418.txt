Very good! Dense in a great way. I made these to have for breakfast over the course of a week and I was pleased with the result. They are filling, with a unique flavor. I was able to heat them in the oven for a few minutes each day without them drying out. Spicy and sweet, without being too much of either. Great recipe!

Very high in all the good stuff - fiber, nutrition, portability (travels well in muffin papers). Took a little longer for preparation than I anticipated but next time it probably will not. I definitely will make this again.
