Fantastic! I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that there is a bit too much moisture. Next time I will cut the amount of cream cheese. I am also going to add some sauteed onion, I think that would really add to the flavor of these.

OH my goodness! I love sauerkraut, my b/f does not. This was probably the most original recipe I've found yet that utilizes sauerkraut, which I was trying to get rid of. These were too easy & fun to make! I had only 1/2 lb. sausage & was cooking for two, so I halved the recipe. [Using less cream cheese is TOTALLY OK!] I used half a pkg. of cream cheese and threw in a couple wedges of Wee Brie for extra creaminess. I didnt even freaking let the mix sit for an hour before rolling them into balls and baking them; my b/f RAVED and said they were soo-oo delicious. I served them alongside fresh sauteed grean beans and they made a great meal! This is SUCH a keeper, especially for a German sauerkraut loving girl like me!

I made these for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year and they are a huge hit!! I found that refrigerating them overnight seemed to bring out the flavors more than just refrigerating for 1 hour.  These are excellent!! Try with a dip of equal parts mayo and dijon mustard!!

My husband loved them...I liked them. I reduced the amount of sauerkraut and cream cheese. There was way too much moisture to roll them into balls. Next time I make them for my husband, I will reduce the cream cheese even more to just 1/2 pkg. And will chop up the sauerkraut.

I have never used the mustard, but we like to spice it up.  1 green pepper diced, 1 small onion diced, 2tbsp jalapenos diced.  We use seasoned bread crumbs.  They are a family favorite!

I had some leftover kraut & found this recipe after an ingredient search. Although my husband didn't care for it, I loved it. I think he was expecting more of a beef meatball. The flavor was tangy but the cream cheese mellowed it out. I dipped mine in a warm apricot dipping sauce (apricot jelly, mustard, honey) and thought it was excellent. I might tinker with the recipe and try it as a hot dip, baked with the cracker crumbs on top. Thanks for a treat Kendrajean!

These are really good!  I halved the recipe since it was just my husband and I and it was plenty for the two of us.  I will be serving these New Years Day along side the rest of the annual kraut dishes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good and different for parties! I reduced the cream cheese per other reviewer's suggestions and chopped the 'kraut.  Will try the "hot" sausage next time.  After note - made this early and froze it.  Thawed and heated in oven before party.  Rave reviews from guests.

These would be wonderful served as an appetizer, I felt they were missing something to be served as the main dish.  Make sure to crush the crackers so they are very fine and not to roll the balls too large.  Otherwise the measurements were  perfect. I used yellow mustard and chilled for five hours in the fridge. I'm not sure how "German" this would be but next time I think I'll mix in some fresh chopped jalapenos.

I love sour krout, but this was still a little odd for me. I halved the amount of cream cheese and the texture was good, but the krout was too strong of a flavor for me. I needs something sweet or spicy to balance out the strong krout flavor.

These are addicting, I only used half the amount of cream cheese, and they were delicious. Messy to make, but worth it. =)

These were okay, but nothing exciting. I made the recipe as written, so maybe it was my taste buds that were off tonight. I made about 20 medium sized balls but only ate 3 before I put the leftovers away. I'd probably try this again sometime, though. Thanks.

I thought this was very heavy on the cream cheese, so I only used one 8oz block, and it still was too creamy for me, but my partner liked it. I would consider increasing the meat, or still decreasing the cream cheese content.

Had Sauerkraut Balls for the first time at a party last year the day after Thanksgiving and had to find a recipe to help recreate them for a Christmas party. These were so easy to adapt to what I had experienced and I really liked that this recipe was baked not fried. I did add a bit of onion using onion and chive cream cheese as well as parsley and garlic powder to help round out all the flavors. I served them with a spicy honey mustard and thought crushing up French fried onion bits would be a great addition to the cracker crumbs...there's always next time. Thank you KENDRAJEAN1 for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is amazing.  Everyone loves it.  I squeeze the juice out of the sauerkraut so the mixture is quite dry and the balls turn out perfect every time.

I thought I would love this and when I first tasted a little bit, I did love it.  But after eating one or two I was kind of turned off by them.  I'm not sure what it was.  I had a mixed review from my guests.  Mostly they just seemed to find them so-so.

After my family stuck their noses up to this while I was making them... they devoured them later!  There is a lot of moisture, and it makes them hard to roll, but it's well worth it in the end.  I made the recipe as is.  You can't really taste the kraut (which was a little disappointing for me, but still really good!)

I experienced this wonderful appetizer this last Christmas and it was great!! The only difference in recipes is mine has about a 1/4 cup of minced onions, reg. mustard, bread crumbs instead of crackers and only 4 oz oz cream cheese. I actually just made the recipe myself earlier today and I didn't have any bread crumbs. Not wanting to go to the store I thought about using the crushed crackers but was to afraid of changing what I had already loved. Now I know that it has been done and I will definetly try it w/ more cream cheese and crackers.

I have made this recipe a couple of times. My family loves them! I think it is very important to  drain the sauerkraut very well. I lay it out on paper towels to absorb as much liquid as possible then I chop it. This helps when making it into balls. This time I used only 12 oz of cream cheese and I think I like it better. Fabulous recipe!

Also with mine (see previous review) I made a dipping sauce of equal parts strong Dijon mustard (Roland's is my favorite-Amazon), sour cream and mayo. Chilled for 1 hour. 
It's a great compliment to the kraut balls.

Love these.  I have made these several times using different recipes, somes times deep-fat frying, but for health reasons, i now only bake them.   After reading the reviews, I would like to make a couple of suggestions.  Chilling them before cooking will help them retain the "ball" shape while baking.  If you dont like the strong taste of kraut give the kraut a rinse first, drain or squeeze excess moisture out.   I ALWAYS remove excess juice to make them less moist and more "handable".  They freeze really well.  I prefer chopped kraut over shredded.

Oh, my goodness, these are delicious! I'm making homemade Sauerkraut just to make these again. I would have posted a photo but they didn't last long enough to get one taken. I used Clausen Sauerkraut in a jar the first time. Don't like sauerkraut? Don't let that stop you because you will be very much surprised!

Made the recipe as- is. Would make it again adding some diced jalapeno peppers and garlic.  I felt it needed more spice. Also you couldn't taste the sauerkraut as much.

Big hit for NYE! These were absolutely delicious! The mix is quite moist, so I just added some breadcrumbs to help absorb some of it.
