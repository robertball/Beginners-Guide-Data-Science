One of my favorite potluck dishes for 30 years!  I make a pot (3 cups) of plain white rice, and then mix all together.  I usually stir in a little garlic and onion powder, and salt and pepper to taste.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe.  I made it last night with Ronaldo's Beef Carnitas.  You can have it as a side or put it right in the tortilla with the meat.  I used a package of Uncle Bens Wild Rice.  Make sure you cook it with the seasoning packet.  I reduced the amount of sour cream to 1/2 cup, the cheese to 1 cup and didn't drain the green chiles.  I didn't bother layering, just mixed it all up in a bowl and poured into my pan.  Yummy.  I think you could really soup this up by adding sliced olives, mushrooms, sauteed onions, etc.  You could even add some diced chicken and make it a meal.  Very versatile.

I LOVE this recipe--so easy! Everyone begs for the recipe. I found I can use half the cheese and it's still great.

I gave this 5 stars cause I made this dish AS IT WAS WRITTEN, except I NEVER measure cheese, since I'm a cheese lover, I use as much as "I" prefer.  Will definitely make this one again!!  Everyone loved it!  Give this a try.

Great side dish. A nice variation to plain wild rice. I made it for a dinner party of 7 so I doubled the amount of rice. I used 2 packages of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice. I reduced the amount of sour cream and cheddar cheese. Even though I doubled the recipe, I only used 1 cup of light sour cream and 2 cups of cheddar cheese. I used 2 cans of green chilies and used the juice. I didn't drain them as the recipe suggested.   This was a very easy recipe. I made the rice earlier in the day and then just before the dinner party, I layered all of the ingredients and baked the dish. It turned out great.

Oh, we all hated this one.  Not sure what happened.  I didn't find a 6 oz. rice package so I bought a box and followed the directions for 8 servings.  Could have been too much rice.  The recipe also calls for 16 oz of cheese.  One 8 oz package of shredded cheese is 2 cups.  Does the recipe really want 4 cups?  I only used 2.  It was really, really dry.  Sorry.

This is a great recipe.  Rice can be a boring side, but this is so easy and so good.  So much easier than making a risotto.  I used 8 oz. Monterey Jack and 8 oz. cheddar and I was short about 2 tablespoons sour cream so I threw in some ranch dip (that I had made with sour cream) to make up the difference.  Will definitely make again.  I may throw in some shredded cooked chicken or a layer of prepared taco meat.  Love it! Additional note:  I browned 8 oz. ground beef and used 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning mix to make taco meat and added 1/2 on top  of the rice and then the other half on top of the 2nd layer of rice.  Awesome - my family loved it!

We all liked this one. Only used about 1/2 the amount of cheese called for and didn't drain the chiles. Mixed together the prepared rice, sour cream and green chiles, poured it in the baking dish and topped with shredded cheese.  Then baked it until hot and bubbly. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe!  My husband loved it and he doesn't even like sour cream.  Next time I think I'll add chopped chicken to make it more like a meal.

This is a great way to eat rice- especially for a rice lover like myself! Everyone raved over this dish!  I was looking forward to the leftovers, but was lucky to get my one serving! I am always trying to incorporate a new side dish to big dinners and this one is great! When people saw a spicy rice side dish added to Christmas dinner- they weren't sure why it was there, but then they inhaled it without wondering how it got there or why.  I have been asked for this recipe soooo many times, it didn't take long to learn it by heart! This is by far my favorite way to make rice! I am sure there are additions and substitutions that can be made, but the only changes I make are to use fat free sour cream and low fat cheese.  Still great! Maybe one day I will mix it up with a 1/2 cup of corn or tomatoes added in- that could be great! Wish I came up with this one myself!

Very tasty!  I used light sour cream and only used about 4oz. of cheese which was plenty.  This was a big hit!

Overall this was quite good.  I used Rice-o-roni wild rice and the box was only a 4.3oz.  So I scaled everything else down to fit that but it was still quite rich.  I think next time I'll use two 4.3oz boxes (one box doesn't make a whole lot) and keep everything else the same, so it's not so rich.  Also, it asks for a rediculously huge amount of cheese.  I love cheese, and used it generously in this recipe, but I used not even half of what it called for.  So my tip is: scale back on everything but rice so it's not so rich (although if you like green chilis, you can use the whole can).  I also used reduced fat sour cream and still was yummy.

Excellent!  I added a layer of sauteed mushrooms, onion and bell pepper seasoned with cumin.  I also cut back on cheese a bit.  This is a keeper and would be wonderful with shredded beef/chicken.

I used mexican rice and some frozen hatch chiles that i had in the freezer in this recipe. My husband and I liked it, kids not so much.  My rice was a little salty, which is why I tried this recipe in the first place.  I didnt want to waste the rice.  I think that is probably why the kids didn't like it.  Next time I will try it with regular rice and maybe some chicken.  Recipe was super easy can't wait to try again.

I wanted to make this a full meal, so I added chicken, a bit of chopped frozen spinach, a can of mushrooms, a little garlic and onion powder, and reduced the sour cream and shredded cheese. I mixed it all up in the pot with the cooked rice, threw it in a 9x9 pan, topped with a bit of cheese and it was terrific! I really like this base recipe - you can tweak it anyway you like. Very yummy!

I thought this was just good, but the men in the family loved it between the three of them ate it all so that is why I gave it 5 stars. Which surprised me as they usually do not like casserole recipes of any kind!  Served this with thick cut pork loin chops, mixed green salad with balsamic dressing.

I thought this was delicious. My kids didn't like it. My husband and I both enjoyed it and it was super easy to make. I just popped the rice/seasonings and butter in the rice cooker mixed everything together when the rice was done and put it in the oven to broil the cheese on top. Even though my kids didn't like it (they are 7 and 2), I gave it 5 stars because it was so easy.

This is a great dish, very tasty but it needs to be served right out of the oven so the cheese says melty.

Really delicious!  I didn't have the kind of rice recipe calls for, so I just cooked up 1 cup (raw) white rice(not instant)and then baked as written with the sour cream, cheese and fresh whole green chiles.  Can't go wrong with the fresh ones from Hatch!  Mighty tasty!

I added cubed chicken to the recipe to make it more like a meal.  I also used two large cans of diced green chiles for more flavor and added a little more sour cream to make it creamier.  I mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering and added a layer of cheese on top, cooked as directed, and then set the broiler on until the cheese browned up.  It was delicious!

This recipe has become a Thanksgiving tradition, with everyone fighting over the leftovers. I make it just as it is written.

So easy to make and so delicious! Last Thanksgiving I was looking for an easy vegetarian dish to bring (as I am a vegetarian with god awful cooking skills) and this dish was absolutely perfect. I got rave reviews and it's become my staple dish, even the meat eaters in my family were impressed!

Super Yummy!!  I didn't have a rice mix so I just used regular white rice and it came out fine.  I added some garlic powder to make up for no spice mix.

I started preparing this and just couldn't bring myself to add a whole pound of shredded cheese to the relatively small amount of rice.  I ended up using just half of the cheese and everyone agreed that it was the right amount to balance the various flavors.  It was delicious this way, easy to prepare, and I'll make it again.

This is just like a recipe I had years ago but couldn't find my copy. I made this one last Saturday using 3 cups jasmine rice, a 7oz can of green chilis with liquid and jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Delicious, would make it exactly the same again.

YUM!!!  This was so fantastic!  We're not big fans of green chilies so I made my Uncle Ben's rice mix with chopped, fresh jalapeños in my rice cooker and went from there. Didn't use quite so much cheese and it's still cheesy and yummy.  Just finished a small bowl for breakfast if that tells you anything. Thanks for a great new side dish!  I may add chicken and have a main course next time!

YUM!  My whole family loved this.  Even my daughter, who swears she hates all "casseroles".  So yummy.  I used reduced fat sour cream to cut the fat a little.  Also, I think I'll try mixing the sour cream mixture with the rice next time.

I enjoyed this - and added chicken to it (seasoned with mexican-style seasonings) to make it a full meal. It's a comfort food type of dish and isn't full of spice, but a good cook can always overcome that when they want. I will definitely make this again. I love being able to put green chiles in things! lol

Since discovering this recipe, I have made this probably 12 times.  I have made it for office potlucks, when friends come for dinner, when we go to friends houses for dinner, for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  It is always gobbled up, none leftover ( it) and everyone always wants the recipe. Thanks pcur, for a definite winner!

Everyone thought this was great.  Even hubby who dosen't like rice very much loved it (it must have been all the cheese) I didn't do it in layers though, I just mixed it all together and spread it into a greased casserole dish.  It came out perfect.  I will definately be adding this one to our mexican night menue.

Definitely a keeper recipe.  As mentioned by several other reviewers, I only used half the cheese called for in the recipe, and it was plenty.  Overall, we really enjoyed the combination of flavors!

I liked this! Mine wasn't dry at all. I left the rice a little watery prior to baking, and I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 jack cheese. The only thing I think it could use is a little more spice.

Easy and tastey! My grocer didn't have canned chilies so I used fresh, but I would recommend cooking/softening them - the crunch against the soft rice and cheese gave a weird texture. Great contrasting flavours; all my roomies gobbled up the left-overs!

This recipe is excellent!  I was concerned that there wouldn't really be any flavor but I was completely wrong!  I used our rice maker to make white rice and then followed the recipe from there.  My husband is crazy about this recipe!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I, too, only used half of the cheese this recipe called for.  This would be great for a potluck at the office.  The next time I make this I am going to layer in shredded cooked chicken.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving using roasted hatch Chile’s from New Mexico.   Family  ate the entire double batch.   Made more this week just for hubby and I.  Cut Cheddar cheese in half for calorie reduction.   Yummy to the max!

Husband loved it, I thought it was okay but was a little blah. Next time I will cook rice in chicken broth and see if that boosts flavor. Maybe add some garlic powered or something.

I did make some changes.  I know don't rate if you make changes.  However I do like this recipe.  It is straight forward and to me is quite adaptable.  I made the rice, put the real hatch green chilies which had been roasted and frozen into the rice while it was cooking.  That worked out great. Then put the sour cream directly into the rice mixture as one other review said the lawyering didn't work out so well.  This no lawyering method was perfect for what I was doing.  Then I added some meat to make this an entire dinner casserole.  I used left over turkey but any meat would work except ground something.  Then I topped it with a good amount of low cal chesse.
I also used low cal sour ceam.
Put the casserole in the oven just long enough to reheat after adding all other ingredients to the hot rice mixture.
Once bubbly I topped with some tortilla chips for some texture and crunch.  Husband loved it and he is not really a casserole guy.  I will keep this.  It is a really good and different way to use leftovers.

May have been better if I stirred all ingredients together rather than doing as the recipe called for and layering.  Sour cream ended up not quite curdling from cooking, but becoming "dotty" in the dish, if that makes any sense.  I saved the leftovers, will reheat tomorrow and see if better taste.

The appearance after cooking is that of baby food and the texture and taste don't make up for that.

This is good. 
Recommendations I can make after several times eating it....   
I like it  better with a fresh roasted poblano.   The canned chili has acid added to preserve it in the can and you can taste it.  I also recommend sharp or extra sharp cheddar.   That's all...  
Great recipe!!

Loved this!  I'm a big fan of green chilies so I used a 10 oz can of whole green chilies that I chopped.  I also used a sharp cheddar cheese along with a cheddar cheese blend.  I may experiment with different shredded cheeses next time.

This is a really tasty side dish.  Rice can be so boring, but this was not.  I would love to cut the cook time down on it next time so I will make some adaptations there, but the flavor was great!

Ok, so I admit I made a few minor changes... so this was just ok.  I couldn't find any 6 oz boxes of rice, only 4 oz.  And reading some of the reviews, I only used 8 oz bag of cheese (16 does sound way too much), and partially drained the chiles.  And I had some leftover rotisserie chicken so I shredded some chicken onto the first layer.  I don't know if I would make this again, seemed to be a lot of work for a simple dish (having to take 20-25 mins making the boxed rice first-mine took about 35 to cook).  Don't know if I would make this again.

This dish is always a hit!  I've made it as written and have also made it using a variety of flavors of rice, such as Spanish rice or Taco rice (Knorr) to accompany Mexican food.  I typically make it using 2 packages of rice, about 1-1.5 cups of sour cream, two 4-oz cans of green chiles and 2 cups of cheese (definitely not an exact measurement).  I reserve about 3/4 cup of cheese for the top, mix all ingredients together, top it with cheese and bake it until hot & bubbly.  It's been delicious every time and receives rave reviews every time!

I made this with regular rice.  I expected it to be a little spicy and was somewhat disappointed.  I will tinker with it.  Overall a great place to start for something a little different.

This was great! I increased the sour cream to 16 ounces and added extra (Ancho) chiles I grew in my garden. Will be using this recipe often.

Very easy to make. My 9 and 13 year old sons made this dish. I might make it again because it was so easy, but with slight modifications. There is too much sour cream. Some people love sour cream; and that's great, but I don't care for it. I will probably use half the amount of sour cream and mix it with an equal amount of tofu. That will cut the flavor a little bit, but keep the moisture and consistency. Some of my guests said there was too much cheese. It's a heavy dish.

We love this dish. I made it first time last Christmas and have made it most holidays since.  I used mixed rice and cheese to my liking, also added mushrooms.  This is one of those recipes that you can adapt to suit yourself. I gave it 5 stars because it is "the Best"!

My family didn't really care for the overwhelming clash of flavors.  Too much cheese, the afterbite of the green chiles.  We all agreed we would have simply enjoyed the less chaotic flavor of just the box of wild rice prepared alone.

Very tasty!  Everyone asked me for this recipe.  I used the 6 oz Uncle Ben's Rice which took about 25 minutes to make (not instant) and I also sauteed mushrooms and onions for the first layer. I found only about 3 cups of cheese is needed as well(not 4).  Delicious!

This was very well done. Even when you make it all in lowfat-cheese and sour cream.I also used a box of Uncle Bens wild and white rice seasoned. It was a hit everyone liked it.But the next time I make it I will use a little more green chiles to give it a little more of a bite. This dish went very well with the Bourbon Pecan Chicken.

Tasted great, but mine was a bit dry.  I'm going to try this again but make the rice a little more moist before I bake.
