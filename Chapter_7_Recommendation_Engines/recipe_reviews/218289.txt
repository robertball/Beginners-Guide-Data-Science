Right on, SKANDREWS! The tartar sauce of my youth, in WA state, was NEVER a sweet-pickle sauce- it was always dilly. This is almost exactly the same recipe I use- will try it your way soon! Thanks so much for sticking up for the "savory" side! :o)

I mostly followed this, but used dill relish (lazy!) and a touch of regular relish.  Added the dill juice plus lots of pepper and some seasoning salt.  I was trying really hard not to eat it as chip dip!  Very, very good!

This is tartar sauce.  Anything with sweet pickles, sweet pickle relish or Miracle Whip is something else and ought to be banned from using the name.  Same thing with potato salad.

I love this sauce! It's just perfect the way is. I grew up in Delaware, and the tartar was always tangy with dill pickle in it. Thanks for bringing back the past :)

This is good tartar sauce. I much prefer the dill pickles to the sweet relish. I made this last night and also added horseradish and spicy brown mustard. Delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

Loved the dill pickles, hated the mayo.  The measurements seemed just right, but I think I'll try miracle whip next time.  It just didn't taste right.

Tangy has aleays been my favorite but a hit n miss on flavor until now. I had ingredients but not measurements. So glad skandrews for this. My switch is in place of pickle juice I use lemon pepper.

I wanted to use this sauce right away so I minced the onion very, very and I mean very fine,  until it was almost liquefied!  No need to wait for the flavors to blend or mellow when doing this.  I  used pickle relish as that is what I had on hand.   A bit of celery seed was substituted for celery salt  for the same reason.  This is an excellent homemade tartar sauce!

Very nice tartar sauce.  I used minced onion and dried celery seeds since I didn't have celery salt.  Made this the night before and served with some fish sticks.  Hubs loved it, and I enjoyed it too.  It isn't sweet and is a very easy recipe to make, so I'm happy.  :)  It does make more than we needed for the two of us, but I expect it to last for a bit in the fridge so we'll have some fish again in a few days.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the only way I will make tartar sauce. I can't stand the sweet stuff. the only thing I do differently is to add just the tiniest sprinkle of cayenne pepper for a little kick. In a pinch, when I don't have fresh onion on hand, I will rehydrate dried chopped onion in water for about 5 minutes and add that.  If you are in a REAL hurry - Fish is on the table and you forgot the tartar sauce-dill pickle relish, which I always seem to have on hand, mixed with the mayo works well. Never any need to buy tartar sauce. This is so much better.

I love dill pickles & mayo, so HAD to try this recipe. I wasn't disappointed - it was all I could do not to eat it all with a spoon! I put it on "Jim's salmon patties" and it was a great flavor with the slight "heat" of the patties. I've tried more complicated tartar sauce recipes, but none better - this will be the only one I use from now on. I'm really thankful to you, SKANDREWS!

This is excellent!  I did make a few changes, hence the 4 stars.  I halved the recipe, used dill pickle relish (not minced), no juice, no S&P and celery seed instead of celery salt.  I took Emma's advice (but used a microplane) to mince the onion. I also added a shake of dill weed and a scant Tbl. of chopped capers.  My husband pronounced this as good, if not better than the tartar sauce we get at our favorite British Pub with fish and chips!  Thank you for sharing this "not sweet" tartar sauce recipe!!

Four stars as listed, 5 with my additions. I made half a recipe as directed using light mayo, tasted it and added the remaining minced dill pickles and onion.  I added 2 dashes of celery salt and about the same amount of dried dill.  If you like chunky tartar sauce like we do, you'll need to double the amounts in the recipe.  Not sure if we enjoyed it more with the crunchy fish (simple panko breaded baked tilapia loins) or on the red potato oven fries.  We will definitely have again and plan on having it be a staple in the refrigerator.

Love it. Only gave 4 stars because it needs alittle lemmon juice! Other than that, it's better than a sweet relish any day!

This recipe was perfect! I deviated from it a bit though, left out the salt, and added a couple dashes of hot sauce. Can't wait to serve it on top of salmon burgers tonight! Thank you, I am also not a fan of the sweet pickle relish.

I have my own recipe for tartar sauce that is a bit different than this one. With that being said we really enjoyed this one and it was a very nice change of pace. I loved the addition of pickle juice and celery seed.

Way too much onion to suit me!  It overpowered the other flavors.  Also salty.  May try again with only a small amount of onion.

This is very similar to the tartar sauce I've made for many years. I think dill pickle relish or chopped dill pickle are much better than sweet pickles in tartar sauce. You can also substitute capers, if you like. I use a little less onion and pepper in mine and add a little prepared mustard and no extra pickle juice. I also sometimes add just a pinch of cayenne pepper for an extra layer of flavor. Try it. It's easy to make and tastes great. 

I suggest making it at least an hour in advance if you have time, to allow the flavors to blend. You can make it and store it in the refrigerator several days in advance.

Both times I've made this I've made it without the celery seed because we don't have any. But I must say that this is probably the best tartar sauce I've ever had.

Fabulous! Surprisingly wonderful!  Tastes similar to restaurant tartar sauce only better.  Made exactly as written except for the extra salt since pickles are already salted.  Tasty, delicious and way better than anything you can buy.  Try this!

Dill is the only tartar sauce I've ever eaten, also.  I can't imagine anything sweet on fish.  Thanks for the recipe, now I won't have to buy it in a jar.

Great as is!  However, for a little perk I sometimes add some capers (finely chopped, unless they are very small) and/or some minced fresh dill. Make sure you use a good quality mayonnaise, this sauce needs that smooth tasting kind of base.  Some commercial brands are just too "zippy' and tangy,  and they fight with the dill. Combine this with come sour cream and it makes a great vegetable dip.

Can't wait to try this. I was going to buy tarter sauce even though I make most food from scratch, but I absolutely hate sweet pickles and relish makes me sick lol. I just looked on allrecipes out of curiosity and the first one I found looks like a keeper. I love dill pickles and I just know this will make my beer battered fish even better. Thank you!!!!

Good recipe. I tweaked it a little by substituting Old Bay Seasoning for the Cerlery Salt. And added a touch of yellow mustard like a fish n' chip place near us. Gave it the right kick!

Like so many others, I have been searching for this recipe for awhile. Thanks so much for the PERFECT tartar sauce. It tastes exactly like my Mom's from the gulf coast of Texas. We don't like sweet pickles in much of anything and this is excellent, easy and delicious. thanks again SSAndrews for a winner

Nice recipe, always avoided tartar sauce because I thought by definition it had to be sickly sweet.  Much better now.  Made as written once then again adding a little garlic powder.  Will try more pickles and juice next time.  Tastes like mayonnaise basically but is such a good  concept, thanks!

It seems that most of the tartar sauces that I've had are always sweet, so this was a nice change. I really enjoyed the dill flavor and had it with some fried fish that my brother gave me. I would just chop my pickles a little smaller pieces the next time. I added a little extra pickle juice which only helps here. Nice recipe, SKANDREWS!

Easy and very tasty.  The best part is that I always have all the
ingredients - no shopping for something that would sit around and spoil.  For a change of pace, try celery or dill seed (use mortar and pestle to slightly pulverize) and a tad of cayenne or hot sauce.

I learned to make tartar sauce from my mom and she made it like this (minus the extra salt). It was always good. No sweet relish for me either, not in tartar sauce and definitely not in potato salad!

This recipe is similar to how I make tarter sauce.  Try using dill relish (instead of chopping pickles), dried minced onion (instead of fresh), onion powder, lemon juice and dry dill weed.  I don't measure, just to taste, depending on how much sauce you're making.  It's delish with fried fish, shrimp and oysters!
