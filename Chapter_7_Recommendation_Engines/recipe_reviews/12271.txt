Did the recipe and it was great Was so easy and tasted great. I used a two pie order ,but used it in one deep pie pan I liked it better than two small shallow pies.

This recipe is just fantastic!  We were desperate for a coconut custard pie for Thanksgiving and none of the stores had them.  This recipe looked easy and made two pies so we decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad we did!  We'll definitely be using this recipe from now on instead of buying them.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I found that more time was needed in the cooking process. The bottom crust was a bit soggy.

I made this last week, this is the best tasting Coconut Custard pie ever!  I did make a few adjustments though.    You really need to make two pie's, there is to much filling for one deep dish pie.   I added some nutmeg, and I dusted the top of the pie with some cinnamon/sugar spice mix.

I had to cook this for over and hour to get it to firm up in a deep dish pan. By the time it was done the crust and coconut was burned. I tasted the filling and it seemed good, I may try it one more time with a shallow pan.

I've never before had greasy pie.  Yuck.  I didn't think I'd ever say this but this pie has... too much butter!

I JUST MADE THIS PIE AND IT SMELLS GREAT. I USED A GLASS PIE DISH AND THE BUTTER IS JUST BUBBLING ALL UNDER THE CRUST. 
THE CRUST SEEMS TO BE SOGGY. DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG? I ONLY USED ONE DEEP DISH PIE PLATE FOR ALL THE CUSTARD AND COOKED OVER AN HOUR.

This pie is so yummy!  Although I made a few minor changes to the recipe.  - I used two deep dish crusts instead of the regular,  I used light tub butter instead of regular and I whisked the filling instead of stirring.  Perfect pies!!!!!  It took exactly 35 minutes.  Delish!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving - everyone LOVED it!  It was super easy to make.  I'm making more for Christmas!  Only change I made to the recipe, I added more coconut flakes on top.

The custard was quite delicious. I was disappointed that using the two 9 inch pie dishes the pie itself was very thin. I would like to try next time just one 9 1/2 inch pie deep dish and see how that comes out. Everyone loved it and they thought the thin pie was better
