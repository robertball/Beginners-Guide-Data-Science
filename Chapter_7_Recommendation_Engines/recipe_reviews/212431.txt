I am German (although this is a Austrian tart) ha ha....but jokes aside.., it works fantastic as is...no tweeking...you can however add all sorts of nuts to this recipe but not the very fatty ones like macadamian etc. Great success at work!

fantastic flavors and easy to make except for the lattice.  I have a horrible time trying to get the thickness ect.  Clumsy I guess.  I cut out  hearts or other shapes depending on the holiday and place them around.
