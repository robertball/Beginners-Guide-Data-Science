This is very tasty!  I had all of the ingredients on hand with the exception of the matzo meal so I used a 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup italian bread crumbs mixed together - perfect!  I also have a lap band and for anyone who has a lap band they will appreciate this recipe (I ate TWO CUP)! Thank you for sharing MelissaD

Wonderful recipe.  I'm not Jewish, but I have a lapband which does not allow me to eat lasagne pasta...too thick & gets tuck.  This recipe is an answer to my prayers for a lasagne that I can enjoy as well as my family.  We didn't even miss the pasta!   YUM!  Thanks!!!

I have made this over and over again! What I like about this recipe is that you can become creative with the filling. I always put in more bell pepper. Also, I don't ever peel the eggplant and I use half flour and half bread crumbs.Just a tip: I've found that slicing the eggplant lengthwise so that it makes longer slices packs better into a rectangular dish.

I was a little skeptical about making this. I am not jewish but I did have a couple over for last night who happen to be jewish and he is strictly on a kosher diet and a vegetarian and the other well, is jewish as well but isnt as strict in her diet. So I said "what the heck let me try this out". And I am so glad I did. I ended up using about 2 small-medium sized eggplants. I am so glad I used the matzo meal instead of bread crumbs. I think that is something that I will be using often. That was my first time having matzo meal. I didnt just use red pepper I also added a little bit of yellow and green. I also used 2 packages of a mushrooms medley that were mixed with all kind of exotic mushrooms and oooh so yummy. My husband and I love mushrooms especially the mixed medley kind. About $4 bucks a package. The only thing I would do differently is layer the mozzarella between the veggies and eggplant. And 1 package is not enough. I used 2 and I wish I had bought more. But the exciting thing for me was that my guests loved it and even asked for some more to take home with them for lunch tomorrow. I am not kidding! I was like "sure!" I was so happy knowing I had pleased my finicky guests lol. It was fun. And would gladly make this again.  It was a lot of fin making sort if like a mini art project. I wanted everthing to look perfect! Happy eating people!!! xoxo

This is so good it must be criminal! I used italian bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand. I added some fresh spinach at the end of sauteeing the onions/peppers/mushrooms and also put some ground beef in my pasta sauce and layered some cheese in the middle. Husband had second helping, really enjoyed the dish.

The taste is very good, however it was too gloppy for my taste.  Perhaps if portabello mushrooms were substituted.  Also browning the eggplant slices took too much time.  I should have read the recipe more carefully. :)

Sadly, I went to two stores here in Tucson, Arizona and couldn't find Matzo :-(   I used panko, and it still tasted amazing.  Love the simple ingredients. Used Paul Newman's tomato basil spaghetti sauce.  Delish!

Very good.  I substituted instant mashed potato flakes for the matzo meal to make this gluten free. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Liked the onion/mushroom/red pepper filling a lot.  My son said this coating tasted like french fries, but he was the only one who detected that flavor.

OMG!  Who knew you could have lasagna without pasta!  Totally YUM!  I followed the directions except I was able to fit everything into an 8X8 dish.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you for sharing.

SUPER SIMPLE, I like super simple.  I halved this recipe so it'd fit in my toaster oven.  It turned out delicious, like eggplant parm with healthy sauteed goodies mixed in.  I'll definitely be making this again in the future.  I didn't change a thing and don't think it really needs tweaking, it's delicious as is!

Made this recipe as is with the exception of salting and setting the eggplant.  My family came for dinner and raved how good it was.  Will definite make this again.  It's a keeper.

It was good but leftovers were not that good. I would make this again just a smaller amount and change up the recipe a little.

My only complaint was that this dish is so dense. It might need some more light "filler" ingredients (potatoes or pasta maybe?). I still really enjoyed it though.

What a clever way to eliminate pasta from lasagna!! I've made eggplant parmesan and grilled it on kabobs, but this recipe has given me an alternative way to prepare eggplant when the garden is prolific!! Going to try freezing it, to reheat (I'll let you know).

Yum! Used carrots instead of red pepper, saltines instead of matzo, and half the cheese; healthy and delicious.

This was EXCELLENT. I made it for a weekend away so baked it when we got there.  Raves from the others, even for reheated leftovers. One friend said it should just be called Eggplant Cheese Casserole (or similar) because it isn’t lasagne at all, just really good. No substitutions - I try to follow the recipe the first time and save changes for the second time, unless the reviews all point to changes.  The next time I make it I will do it the same way except for this time I will add mushrooms.  Thank you!

Made this during Passover and will continue every year from now on.  Everyone loved it.   I only put one layer of the eggplant on the bottom and added parmesan with the mozzarella on top.  The matzo meal coating stayed on the eggplant during frying and tasted so good.

Loved it! I roasted the eggplant instead of breading, and put toasted bread crumbs on top with some Parmesan for the last few minutes.

Also substituted Italian bread crumbs, didn't use flour and that would have made it perfect.

This recipe is good.  I was missing some ingredients. No mushrooms and no matzo meal.  I made matzo meal by processing 4 matzos in the food processor first and then in a blender on high pulse for a few seconds until fine meal.  It made about 1 cup of meal.  I also added mozzarella cheese between each layer along with basil and parsley.  The recipe takes time to prepare but was worth it!  Will make it again most definitely.
