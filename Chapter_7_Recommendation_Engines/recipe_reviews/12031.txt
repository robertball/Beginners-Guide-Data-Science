Pretty good, but I would decrease or even omit the cream cheese next time. 

I don't really see how this recipe relates to Pakistan...I have never seen an authentic Pakistani recipe with cream cheese.

While makeing the meal, it seemed like it would be quite tasty esp with the onions on the top and the cream cheese & cottage cheese.  I found the onions burned a little and seasoning needs to be added. I found the meal to be slightly bland.

Very creamy.  Did not taste like I expected it to.  But, very good.  Will make again.  Instead of 3 cans of tomatoe sauce I used 2 cans and 1 can of diced tomatoes undrained.

I omitted the cream cheese like others suggested, spiced up the meat with onion garlic powder, thyme, and seasoning salt, and it was still a little too bland.  I may try this again as a base for future experimentation.

I loved this!  It was very easy to make and CHEAP.  The portion sizes were also pretty large.

This dish is super easy, but it is in need of some basic seasoning. I added about 1/2 a green pepper to the sauce and sliced olives. Definitely a recipe you can play with and one I will make again.
