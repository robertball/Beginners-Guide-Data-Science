I made this exactly according to the recipe, but without jalapeño and celery, and it was delicious! I was worried that it would taste weird because of the peanut butter, but it was perfect - I'm going back for a second bowl! UPDATE: I started using coconut oil instead of butter or other oils in the pan to cook the veggies, and I am now using almond butter instead of peanut butter. I can't believe it, but it tastes even better. I make this soup once a week, and we never get tired of it!

I was nearly afraid to dump the peanut butter into the simmering stew because it just seems so unusual. Turns out, these ingredients all create an amazing flavor that you simply cannot imagine until you try it.  It's akin to a slightly sweet, nutty minestrone. I think that the sweet potato, zucchini, and cumin are all critical ingredients for achieving the right flavor. Even with the jalapeño, the kick was minimal. I used fresh Cuban oregano as that's what I had on hand in the garden. Next time, I might experiment with more spice, but I will definitely put the quinoa in maybe 5 or so minutes later than the spices since I felt like it was a bit over-cooked.  The nutritional value of these ingredients is very high, and I felt energized after a bowl of this soup. Overall, this is a delicious, healthy and very unique recipe that becomes a fun talking point among those you make it for.

I read the reviews and was surprised that so many folks found the peanut butter unusual/weird...peanut butter is very much an ingredient that I find in most recipes from the African culture...I make this soup a lot as I try to cook vegetarian a couple of times a week...we love it!

I'm not a good cook -- I'm barely a cook at all -- and I was able to make this, so I call that a win!

The only thing I would say is that it was too sweet for me. I thought I was using a small sweet potato, but apparently it wasn't small enough. Next time I will definitely go smaller.

This soup was outstanding! I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was to omit the celery because I didn't have any.

So different than any other soup I've made.  Loved it!  Didn't change anything.  Perfect as is.

Very interesting withy the peanut butter. My husband loved it. It became a little mushy after a while but it still had a nice flavor.

I added okra, subtracted onions and used Yukon golds instead of yams. This was excellent and a nice change-up from my standard uses for summer zucchini and other CSA box surplus items

Has nice flavor.  I used more of the spices (about 1 tablespoon of cumin and oregano, and probably about 1 to 2 teaspoons of cayenne because it dumped out of the container). Also added a little more quinoa, about 3/4 c total, to absorb some extra liquid, so it came out more like a stew. I thought the cayenne would be too strong, but I think it came out just right for my tastes.

Very tasty recipe! I left out the jalapeño because we don't like spicy food vey much and I used yams instead of sweet potatoes but other than that I followed the recipe closely. Easy to make, as long as you enjoy chopping vegetables, and healthy too.

This is VERY good.  I followed the recipe as well as I could.  I used tri-color quinoa.  I did sub winter squash for zucchini and left out the oregano because I didn't have them.  I will use the sweet potato next time.  The flavor is awesome!
