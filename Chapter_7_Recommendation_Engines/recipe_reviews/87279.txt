Do add the dill to the lemon butter sauce and use fresh garlic if you have it.  I put thin slices of lemon on the salmon for a nice look and some extra lemon flavor.  It works well to wrap it all in foil to keep in all the sauce.  20 minutes was enough cooking time.  Serve with rice to soak up the tasty sauce.

I needed a quick and easy recipe and this fit the bill.  Used a few tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter, a few teaspoons of lime instead of lemon juice, and fresh pressed garlic instead of the powder.  Healthy and delicious.

Very good recipe.  This is one of the recipes that we use for salmon on a regular basis.  Definitely follow the advice of another reviewer and add the dill to the butter sauce.  It enhances the flavor and looks much better.  Thanks for the post.

I agree with mixing the dill in with the butter/lemon juice. I found that the fish comes out much less dry if you wrap the dish in aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Also, you will want to use only half a tablespoon of dill or it's too overpowering.

It was good, but I would definitelty mix the dill in with the butter sauce itself.  Otherwise you just have a thick coating of dill on top of the salmon, which can be off-putting.

A wonderful dish this truly is! I did cut back on the amount of butter and added in garlic, 2 T of fresh lemon juice, 1 garlic clove chopped up and also fresh chopped dill. I did not use a lot of dill after reading what other reviewers posted, just 1 tsp plus a little more (eyeball the amount) and I also mixed it with the lemon butter sauce before pouring it all over the salmon. The salmon was placed on a foil and after I poured the sauce over it I folded the aluminum tightly and baked 350 degrees for 25 minutes. The salmon came out sooooo moist, flaky, tasty, full of flavor, nothing overpowering. You can play with the amount of dill, lemon juice, etc., so the tastes suits you. I am glad I did cut back on the lemon juice and fresh dill. I also made a dill sauce (from this website) which I served alongside the salmon to dip in and I also made this with mushroom rice pilaf (from this website) with sauteed veggies. A very healthy and tasty dish. a winner and keeper in my recipe box.

My fiance & I liked this but thought that the lemon was a little strong.  I would reduce to maybe 4 tbsp.  Also, instead of the 1/4 cup butter I used 3 tbsp light margarine + 1 tbsp fat-free sour cream (would recommend this).  I also went light on the dill because 1 tbsp seemed like a lot.  I would make this recipe again.

This was my first time making fish and it turned out delicious.  My boyfriend loves it and askes for it every week.  It's very simple and doesn't require a whole lot of ingredients.  A must try!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. Our 6-year old and 3-year old had a different opinion.  I will make it again, but will reduce the lemon juice. Thanks for sharing this.

This was very good but I would reduce the lemon to 4 tbsp because it was very lemony. Other than that, I thought it was really good.

Wonderful and easy recipe, as promised. I did mix the dill in with the butter sauce and cut the lemon juice down to about 3 Tbsp. The sauce was excellent over jasmine rice. Also served with broccoli. Thanks for this tasty little recipe, Michele.

I've used a similar recipe for ages, and I love it. For light summer fare, season the salmon itself with the salt, pepper, and garlic, place a few sprigs of fresh dillweed on top of the fillet, and lay lemon slices on top of it all, drizzle lightly with safflower or olive oil, wrap the whole thing in foil, and then bake or grill, and serve with a nice light dilled cucumber salad.... be careful not to overcook the salmon, at most altitutes 20 minutes is plenty, 25 may be needed above 5000 feet.

This is my go-to salmon recipe and a cinch to make on those evenings when you want dinner ready in a half hour.  Pair it with brown rice and broccoli or peas, bread on the side, and it's a filling dish with super-easy prep and clean-up.  Thanks to this, we eat fish at least once a week now!  Oh -- forgot to mention that it's forgiving too -- I measure the butter & lemon juice, crush 5 garlic cloves instead of the garlic powder, and then just ballpark the dill weed, salt, and pepper.  I also add sliced lemon on top to give it extra lemon flavor, and usually bake for 30 minutes instead of 25 (my fillets usually range up to 1.25 lbs).  :)

This was my first time to cook salmon.  I looked through a lot of recipes before I decided which one to try.  I chose this one because the ingredients sounded like they would give good flavor.  I was not disappointed at all.  It was super easy and delicious.  I saved the recipe and will be making this again.

This is a nice, quick recipe, and it is very good.  I drizzled the fish with olive oil instead of using melted butter.

This had way too much sauce. I would cut it in half. I also used fresh garlic and my salmon turned out dry. I would cut 10 mins off my cooking time. I did like the flavors so I would make this one again.

This is pretty classic for almost any kind of fish.  People seem to think that the more off-the-wall the ingredients are, the more "classy" the dish is.  In the process, they seem to forget that the simple often trumps the "elegant."

I make this dish myself, on the stovetop.  It isn't precisely the same.  Most important is NOT to add the dill to the fish while it's cooking.  Garlic should also wait until near the end, to avoid burning it.

Dredge thick salmon filets in flour.  Avoid the sides as much as possible. Put into a frypan, skin side down, with melted butter, let sit, without being messed around with, until the bottom feels firm to the spatula and browning is visible.  (I'm partial to the crisped browned skin.)  Turn it carefully (two oiled spatulas help here), and repeat the cooking on the other side.  As it cooks, the butter becomes browned butter, which is lovely.  (If you want the taste of melted butter, add some at the very end of cooking, but not too much.)  By watching the color of the sides, you can know when it's done.  The color should be uniformly pale pink, rather than the almost-gelatinous darker color. It is then done.  Remove to a plate.  After that, squeeze lemon juice into the pan, scraping off all the browned bits.  This reduces and strengthens the flavor of the juice, and brings those flavorful bits to your plate.  Pour the liquid over the fish, sprinkle with dill (fresh or dried), and it's done.  Use lemon or lime, garlic and dill to your taste.

I really liked this salmon! However I did make a couple of minor changes to the recipe to ensure moist, flavorful filets (which is why I'm rating it 4 instead of 5 stars). I substituted freshly minced garlic for the garlic powder (which I think made a big difference), mixed in the dried dill with the butter sauce as per other reviewers' suggestions, and I placed a lemon slice on top of each filet before baking. Also, instead of baking the fish directly in the baking dish, I wrapped it in foil so that the sauce stayed put, instead of running down to the bottom of the pan. With these few modifications, this was a very tasty and easy meal! I think the original recipe would yield good fish, but this turned it up a notch. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm trying in earnest to incorporate more fish into my diet and allrecipes has been so helpful- this is an easy and tasty recipe!  I added the dill to the butter sauce and sprinkled some garlic salt on top right before serving.  Deelish!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I'm not sure if its because I am not a huge salmon fan - but I was really hoping as per the reviews that the "sauce" would be really great.  I wasn't really impressed.  The piece of salmon was good - very flaky and cooked perfect - and as for the lemon and butter together.......that was very good - I think if you put lemon and butter on anything it would taste really good!  But I truly think the dill was very overpowering in this dish.  I put the true amount - 1 tablespoon and it seemed a lot at the time.......and when I was eating the fish - truly all I tasted was the dill...dried dill is more powerful in flavor than the fresh dill and takes on a different taste - maybe fresh dill would have been better in my opinion.  I'm thinking if you maybe cut the dill to a teaspoon - it will balance out the flavors and you would be able to taste the garlic, lemon, butter AND the dill......not just the dill......overall - I will not be making this again.

I grew up always having this type of salmon and it's always been very tasty! I agree that the dill should be mixed in with the butter sauce. You can also use this topping on trout, cod fish, or orange ruffy. Wonderful and easy recipe!!

I used fresh minced dill I had growing on the porch and mixed all of the ingredients more like a marinade.....letting the salmon sit in a freezer bag of it in the fridge for a few hours (flipping occasionally) before placing it on a foil covered charcoal grill.  The grill was high heat, direct for 13 minutes.  I did not disturb the fish at all as it cooked.  It had a beautiful brown crunchy crust on the bottom and was delicious.  My husband loved it too.

this was phenomenal.  I made this for my husband (who is a salmon FREAK) and he said it was the best he had eaten in a long time.  I served it with garlic couscous, and roasted asparagus with fresh garlic and a few squeezes of lemon.  Definitely use less lemon juice in the recipe, and add the dill to the lemon, butter, and garlic sauce before you poor on the salmon.  Some people wrote in their reviews that 20 minutes was enough, it wasn't for me, I had a really thick cut so PLEASE don't commit yourself to a cooking time, you really just have to keep checking it.  Salmon should be cooked until you can flake it apart with a fork....if you under cook salmon it is off putting, but if you over cook it, you've basically ruined your dish, and a nice piece of fish.
thanks for the recipe!  I will use this often :)

I am very finicky with my salmon flavoring so imagine my surprise when that deliciousness that is this recipe hit my tongue.  Fantastic!  I was looking for a lemon and dill salmon and this fit the bill 100%!  Recipe is bookmarked and I will be making this one again and again!

I love this dish.  We've been making it in our family for ages.  Except I usually season the fish, squeeze a fresh lemon on top and then place chunks of butter on the fish, put it in foil and stick it on the grill for 15 minutes.

I'd personally give this 5 stars!  But, my children (who ALL LOVE salmon) just said it was "ok".  (BTW, it was ALL eaten.)  I used a large salmon fillet with skin on 1 side, so it took about 5 minutes longer to cook.  Took advice from others and put dill in butter and used 2 cloves fresh garlic. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

This is a decent way to do salmon, but you need to increase most of the ingredients, and the cooking time is way too long unless you like overcooked fish.  Fresh scallions are a great addition.

This was the first time I'd ever made salmon. Nervous! It was very simple, and tasted very good. I marinated the salmon for about 2 hours in the fridge in a mixture of butter, lemon juice (4 Tbsp), dill and 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic. My cooking time was actually 35 minutes; I checked it at 20, 25 and 30 minutes. The texture was just right: moist and flaky. I had added the marinade to the pan while cooking, and after done, spooned the sauce over the filets. As a side, I made couscous and also added in some of the sauce, plus additional fresh lemon juice. Overall, everything was good, but a bit under-flavored. Next time, I'll make a much bigger batch of marinade and add capers as well. Very simple and easy, and I appreciate the recipe! Also served parmesan asparagus, tomato slices, lemon quarters and muscadine wine, and not a bit was left.

LOVE this:   My way is to use 4 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of 5.  And DEFINITELY use fresh garlic!  Makes a huge difference.

Wonderful! Since I am the only fish eater in the house, I reduced the recipe to 1 serving. I love Salmon, and I had corn and brockley with it. I used the remaining Butter-Lemon in the baking pan for the vegetables. Since I am a low sodium heart patient, I omitted the added salt, and used Smart Balance spread instead of butter. It was super easy for me to make, and I loved the flavor. Since my Salmon is frozen and individually wrapped, it makes it very easy for me to do single portions for just myself when I feel like having fish. A bonus was the wife was having shrimp for her lunch with brockley. So she wasn't bothered by the aroma of my fish baking. As a rank amateur cook, this is one of my new favorite recipes. Thanks!

This is a super and easy dish to make.  I made this dish according to the recipe, but also made it with a few changes.  The best way I found was to use fresh garlic rather than powder garlic, gives it a rich garlic flavor.  I also added everything into the melted butter and let it marinade for a while before I put it on the fish.  I put a lining of aluminum foil in the pan to keep the marinade covering the fish.  Was fantastic.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it for company and not only was it super easy, everybody loved it!  A few pointers: Add the lemon juice either at room temperature or while the butter is still over the heat.  This way the butter doesn't harden on you like mine (I stored my lemons in the fridge).  I used about 1/2 T dill, I didn't want it to be overpowering.  I also used wild salmon with the skin on one side, it was fantastic.  A lovely color, plus the skin flakes right off and keeps the bottom of the fish perfectly moist and tender.  I will DEFINITELY make this over and over!

Try placing the salmon into tinfoil thats slightly cupped, then drizzling the sauce on before completely wrapping it up. It hold the moisture in to make the fish more tender, yum!!!

This is a ridiculously simple but shockingly good recipe. BEST SALMON EVER per my husband and I. He doesn't even LIKE dill and he thought it was the best salmon he's ever had. I don't prefer salmon, I eat it because it's so good for you, but this was so tasty... I even ate the leftovers cold it was THAT GOOD! Thank you!!!

Just made it again and AGAIN we were floored - I used to say I only ate salmon because it's good for you - one of the top five foods you must eat - now I can say I eat salmon because I LIKE it, all because of this recipe. NO LEFTOVERS, you can't stop eating it. Hot or cold it is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

I haven't been in a kitchen much, but due to a pretty serious relationship (and turning 20) I decided it was time to try some things out. This recipe was great and so easy to follow, even for a beginner! My boyfriend and I loved it, the salmon was so tender it fell apart the minute we bit in :)

I made this as written But with the suggestion to put the dill in the sauce. There was too much lemon.  Now maybe reviewers weren't using fresh lemon but I TBS of fresh lemon would have been plenty IMO.

Great recipe! I cooked this for the first time for friends visiting from Germany and it was well received. Like other reviewers, I added the dill to the butter mixture (only 1/2 teaspoon) and baked it in foil for 20 minutes. My husband said it was his new fave, thank you for posting! :)

I made this as written except I used lemon pepper seasoning instead of salt and pepper. I also added melted butter to the salmon separately after it cooked so the butter wouldn't burn in the oven.   It had a lot of flavor and is one of the better salmon recipes I've found on this site.  Thanks!

This was delicious! The flavor combinations worked so well together. I tend to do a lot of eyeballing when cooking, so didn't follow this recipe exactly, but mine turned out amazing and I'll be making it again. One thing I did differently - I just dropped pats of butter all over the salmon instead of pre-melting it, figuring it would melt quick enough once in the oven.

I averaged the rating for us - one of us loved it (5 star) and the other didn't (1 star).  If you really like the taste of salmon, this is a recipe for you as the very light butter/dill flavor really does it justice. One thing, watch the time as our filets cooked in about 19 minutes.  Very pretty presentation though, with the green from the dill being lightly browned on top of the pink fish.

LOVE this recipe!  It is extremely quick and easy but like everyone said before me, I would mix the dill in with the butter and lemon before putting it on the salmon.  Otherwise you end up with a whole lot of dill.  Using fresh garlic rather than garlic powder also adds a nice flavor.

I cooked Salmon and Ribs for a party last night.. had 12 filets and none were left.. I can't tell you what they tasted like, I didn't get any...  based on that, I'm giving 4 stars..  I used olive oil rather than butter.. 
Made 6 racks of Ribs too and any leftovers were taken by my guests..  Either, everyone was really hungry, or I'm a heck of a good cook!

Best salmon I've ever made.  I mixed the seasonings with the butter before drizzling over the salmon.  In the past I've added the melted butter mixture after I take it out of the oven, but this was the moistest salmon I've ever baked so I'll now add it before baking.  I omitted the lemon juice and it was still great tasting.  I look forward to trying more recipes from this cook!

I made this dish for Easter and it turned out great.  I used 4 lbs. of salmon for the same amount of ingredients and it was perfect... not too lemony or dilly :)  I used two fresh garlic cloves and about a tablespoon of heavy cream.  Everyone enjoyed it... even the 2 year old!!!

This was a very nice and light.  I wisked all the dry seasonings with the butter and lemon prior to pouring over the salmon.  Half way through baking I based the salmon with the butter mixture and then again right before serving.  I will make this again!!

I used 2T of fresh dill, juice of 2 small lemons with the butter and flavor was still subtle enough.  Nice presentation too. This was my first time cooking salmon and it was a hit!

Love this recipe, and have made it several times, with my own moderation. Rather than melt the butter, I take 1/2 stick softened butter, and add salt to it, as well as fresh dill, finely chopped. Stir until it's whipped together, and set aside to rest. I pat my salmon dry and place into glass baking dish. Then I pour the lemon juice over the salmon. Next, scoop the butter spread onto the salmon and cover it completely like a paste. Chop garlic and sprinkle over the butter spread. Then cover the salmon with cut lemon wheels to keep moist while cooking. Voilà! Even my 4 year old loves this! Pair it with asparagus and quinoa or wild rice and it's an amazing dish your family will thank you for!

Red Sockeye, Norwegian and Atlantic salmons are the best.

I make this dish all the time, but a bit differently, with the same ingredients. But mine is less messy and is never dry. I put a single piece of salmon on a piece of foil, with a 1/2 tablespoon of butter on the bottom, the same on top on top. I sprinkle Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Medley (a bit spicy), and then put a sprig of fresh dill on top, with a thinly sliced lemon. I then fold it into a tightly sealed packet. You can either put it in a 335 degree oven for about 20-25 minutes, or it can go on the grill. Comes out perfect every time :)

This was simply amazing. I reduced the lemon to 3T and the butter to 3T (I had 2 small pieces of salmon)and wrapped in foil to keep moist. I took some of the other reviewers advice and mixed the dill in with the butter sauce and also added 2 cloves of minced garlic. Superdelicious!

I need better measurements than this.  "1 pound salmon fillets"  is not specific enough.  I bought four 1lb fillets.  I quadrupled the sauce recipe to be safe, & had leftover butter sauce.  It's been baking for 40 minutes and isn't even close to being done.  My kids are hungry, & everything else is getting cold.

I was about to make it but I did some research on miso. Miso looses most of its flavor when heated. If i do make it I will add it 5 minutes after removal from oven, might try dipping salmon in miso side dish. Erwin

This was pretty good, but next time, I think I'll increase the flavoring or choose a different type of salmon.  I used sockeye salmon filets, and I could hardly taste the seasoning because of the strength of the fish.  Maybe this recipe would work better with king or coho salmon, which are milder.

I have made this twice.  I cut the amount of lemon in half the second time and it is just a wonderful, easy meal for a work night or a rainy night when you can't grill. I serve with rice pilaf, steamed veggies and salad.  My 5 year old even loves it!

I love salmon, and this recipe is really easy and quick to make.  I usually don't melt my butter, I just put pats of butter on top of the salmon after I've seasoned it.  Turns out really delicious!

Delicious, quick and easy! A great weeknight dinner. I too used 1 clove fresh garlic instead. I prefer to cook my fish at 400 for about 15-20 mins. depending on size of cut.

Good recipe. Mix the dill in with the butter sauce and use a little less lemon than the recipe calls for. I also added some fresh sprigs of dill.

This was an easy, elegant and excellent recipe - used with a fresh side (fillet) of a wild Alaskan salmon. I just made a couple of changes.  Cooked the fish at 375.  I used less butter, and made it a combination of butter and olive oil.  I omitted the garlic powder - just didn't have it. What I really liked was substituting fresh dill for the dried.  After I baked the fish for 15 minutes, I removed it, basted it, and sprinkled it with finely chopped fresh dill, before cooking the remaining time.  Serve with lemon wedges.  (Went nicely with quinoa pilaf, and an excellent green beans amandine with sliced red pepper that I found at food.com.)

Love this dish. My husband used to hate salmon, but he asked for me to cook this recipe once a week! I serve with brown rice and drizzle the butter/ lemon over it.

Easy, fast, tasty every time

This is an AWESOME "marinade" for any kind of fish.  I was looking for a recipe for some yummy cod I picked up.  Was tired of the cheesy, drenched in cream, or bread crumb coated recipes.  I happened upon this FRESH, DELICIOUS recipe and was so very happy!  LOVE IT!  Thanks for sharing.    Alternate:  sub olive oil for butter, used 1 tsp minced garlic with lemon juice and oil, used FRESH dill weed.

At first I was a bit skeptical because I never used dill weed before. But it turned out to be GREAT! I grilled on charcoal instead of baked, and did suggestions from the reviews -mix all seasoning with melted butter, use fresh garlic instead of powder- and I don't think it's too lemony or too strong. The flavor simply compliment the salmon. It did soften the strong fishy taste on salmon, but it did not overwhelm the taste of fish. Perfect for fish-beginner or salmon lover.

The amount of lemon juice in this recipe is out of control. I used about 1 tsp. and was pleased. I'd much rather add fresh lemon juice at the table. Also, I think 25 minutes is too long. My fillets were done at 15 minutes.

I was looking for something quick since I didn't have time to wait for a marinade like most of the salmon recipes recommended. I whipped this up in a jiffy and it did not dissapoint. It was tasty and the light flavors complement the salmon well. I did have to bake about 10 minutes longer than directed though. In the past I have also tried a few variations like fresh garlic, olive oil instead of butter, putting lemon slices on top of the fish, and baking in tin foil packets. All delicious!

This got a 5 for easy; but I was not too excited about the flavor. Not sure why. The taste was okay, but I think I like a bit more variety in the flavors. I followed the recipe exactly. 2nd effort: taste was better. Included dill & garlic in the butter, also covered with foil & cooked 20 min. Next time will reduce amt of dill. My piece of salmon was so thick that 20 min was not enough.

This is delicious.  Dill and salmon are a natural combination.  I covered the dish in aluminum and baked for 30 minutes.  Also, instead of using garlic powder I used fresh minced garlic.

So easy, quick, and tasty! I add a bit more dill (to suit my own taste) and I usually add a few slices of lemon on top while it bakes.

This dish is very lemony, but in a satisfying way. I think that, as previously mentioned, one will want to back off the dill by about half, and it would help to reduce the cooking time to about twenty minutes and/or cover the dish in aluminum foil to help keep it moist.

Instead of butter and lemon, i used lemon flavored extra virgin olive oil which did the trick quite nicely.  Also used minced garlic instead of powder.

Every now and then I try a different recipe for salmon, but this is the one I keep coming back to. I use olive oil instead of butter. The combination of the flavors work perfectly with the salmon. Thanks, Rebecca!

I cooked the salmon for the suggested 25 minutes, but next time I will cook it for 20 minutes and broil it for five more or maybe even cook it at a higher temp. I definitely prefer salmon with a crispy exterior instead of mushy! I think from now on I will always add lemon pepper and salmon seasoning for extra flavor. Maybe even garlic salt too...I'm a little surprised that a recipe with so much butter and lemon juice didn't have very much flavor. I'll experiment with it and post what I come up with soon!

I thought this had a great flavor. The fish I used wasnt fresh, since I live in a landlocked place, so it was a bit fishier than IM use to. I soaked it in milk to get some of the fishy taste out and it did help. The dill and lemon went perfect together and I made homemade tarter sauce to go with it. Wonderful and will make agian!

This has become my regular salmon recipe. Very tasty. I prefer to mix the lemon, butter, and seasonings together and then pour them over the salmon to avoid having all the dill caked on top of the salmon. I find this distributes the flavors much better.

This was overall pretty good. It was a little dilly for me. I did mix the dill into the butter as suggested by other reviewers. I also put it under the broiler for a few minutes after baking.

I really liked this recipe. The only thing I did different was I added onion on the top of the salmon for a little extra zip. I might add a little more dill only because I really love it on salmon. My husband really enjoyed it and when I cook salmon again I will use this recipe.

Just like the others - I was not disappointed with this easy, delicious recipe -- it lends itself to other spices on hand and is hard to mess up!  Bravo!

I used olive oil instead of butter.  I also added some lemon pepper seasoning.  I wrapped each salmon in a foil packet (with the olive oil/lemon juice mixture) and grilled for about 5 minutes.  I unwrapped the foil to make a hole at the top and grilled for about 10 more minutes.  Awesome!

My husband and I loved this really easy recipe! It's one of those recipes that leaves a lot of room for adjustments according to taste. I used the suggestion of others to bake the fish in tighly sealed foil. I also used 1 tbsp of melter butter and 3 tbsp of olive oil instead of 1/4 c butter and as the others had suggested, mixed in freshly chopped garlic and dill in the oil/butter mixture. I found that the juice of 1 lemon is more than enough for 1 lb of salmon, I also used the lemon zest in the oil/butter mixture. I served with a side of steamed broccoli and rice pilaf (from the box).

This was exactly what I was looking for. Years ago I was in Alaska and had Lemon Dill Salmon, and have searched for a similar recipe. This is it, delicious!! I love it, I improvised just a tad with measurements, but the ingredients are perfect, same delicious taste, great, wonderful, thank you, we love it!

Great recipe, used 2 garlic cloves instead of the powder and mixed all ingredients in to the butter sauce before pouring over the salmon. The whole family really enjoyed it, my 6 yr old daughter even asked for more. Thanks!

This was my first time making salmon, and I found this recipe extremely easy to make. I added chopped garlic and half a small onion, just putting those over the salmon before baking. It was absolutely AMAZING. It was served over rice. I'll definitely be making this again. My parents both loved this too. The only thing I'll change next time is maybe added the suggested amount of lemon, because it seemed like alot at the time so I cut it to 2 1/2 tblspoons. Definitely will look forward to making this again.:) Thanks!

This is definitely a must-make-again recipe.  I used fresh dill which is great!!  Next time I'll add more lemon or slice lemon for the top of the fish.  The tangier, the better, for us!

I had planned to make this recipe tonight - but we had a 34 degee C. day so it was time to use the BBQ . I used salmon steaks. mixed 1/4 cup of oil, the lemon juice, 2 tbsp chopped fresh dill, 1 fresh garlic clove minced and a pinch of white sugar. I brushed the mixture over both sides of the steaks and let them sit for 10 minutes (longer might have been better) and grilled the fish on the BBQ, basting periodically with the oil mixture. Delicious.

Excellent! My husband has to have a "Sauce" with everything. So I used half of the ingredients from this recipe, and combined them with 4 oz Philadelphia Cream Cheese with Chives, 1 tbs Woostershire, and 1 tsp of Red Pepper Sauce. Flavors went great together. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I used the whole salmon fillet I purchased from Costco. Eyeballed the lemon and butter and went crazy with dill. It comes out perfect and everyone loves it.  It was still moist when I microwave it again the next day for lunch.

I tried this for dinner last night- I made it for my boyfriend & a friend of his- they both loved it! I thought it was nice & simple, and the lemon & dill were 2 flavors that complimented the salmon perfectly. I used the dill sprinkle seasoning instead of the fresh, and it still came out nicely. I thought the lemon/ butter mixture made too much, though- there was too much liquid- I would reccommend making about 1/2 of what the recipe says to drizzle over the salmon (unless you are making more salmon than the recipe calls for). Overall it was very good and easy! I will definitely make again :)

I only used the 4T of lemon and and mixture of olive oil and butter.  I didn't think it had a lot of lemon flavor.  I will probably use more next time.  Also, I did put this on a Ceasar Salad, it was still a pretty good meal.

This recipe was quick and easy to put together. My toddlers and even my husband enjoyed it, and he's not much of a salmon fan. I did have to extend to the cooking time by several minutes but I suspect it may be because of our elevation.

Excellent recipe. I am awful with fish and found this to be easy and tasteful - the only thing would be that my 1 lb. of salmon was not done after 30 minutes, will have to extend the cook time in the future.

Absolutely delicious.  I’m making again today.  I’m new to cooking fish.  Didn’t know if I should take the skin off or leave it on or skin down or skin side up.  Still don’t know.

Same flavors, but way faster! I put the butter, dill, and fresh garlic into a saute pan, then when the butter melts and I'm smelling dill and garlic, I gently sautée the salmon, skin-side down. I stir in the lemon juice and slices, and after a few seconds, flip the salmon over and finish it. Depends on the thickness of your salmon, but don't overcook! Finally, pour the sauce over the salmon.

Forget the foil and wrap in parchment paper. Aluminum foil use has been linked to Alzheimer’s/dementia. Use coconut oil or avocado oil over olive oil as they are better suited for higher temperatures.

I ate it, but I didn't like it. Flavor was lacking, and the salmon was chewy. We got great cuts, so that wasn't the issue. I used fresh garlic, reduced the lemon and added the dill to the butter mixture, and covered with foil as many others suggested. I think the chewiness was due to the lower temperature and longer cooking time. I usually cook salmon at 450º for 12-15 uncovered, and it always comes out moist and melt in your mouth.

I would bake the salmon between 15-18 mins. At 20 mins. it was already too done and dry.  You want it to be tender and flakey,  not tough. Good flavor though.

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make. I did combine all of the sauce ingredients, using fresh garlic rather than powder, first and then covered the salmon in it. I also placed the fish in a piece of foil and layed another piece of foil on top while baking.

Delicious, I eyeball the ingredients too by the number of fillets - luscious delicious salmon!!!  Use unsalted butter, about per fillet - 1 Tbsp , 1 Tbsp Litehouse Dill, one small clove garlic minced fine, 1 tsp lemon juice,   1/4 tsp sea salt, fresh cracked pepper - dash of rosemary - place fillet in foil, mix all ingredients together and coat fish.  Pinch foil to cover fish entirely - -place in pre heated 350 degree oven and cook for 25 minutes.

This salmon recipe was delicious. A wonderful dish to make any night of the week. I followed the recipe as is, except I used fresh garlic. I also took a suggestion from another review and added the dill to the lemon butter sauce. Turned out great. Very tasty, and just the right amount of buttery. This says a lot because I don't like fish all that much, but I'd recommend this to anyone. Thanks for sharing!

Wow! Loved it!! Only thing I did differently was I grilled it, about 8 minutes each side (skinless Salmon was used). Make sure you spray the grill with Olive oil cook spray.  I will make this again.

Try cooking the salmon at 400 degrees and taking it our after about 12 minutes, depending on thickness of the fillet. I can't believe you can let a salmon sit in an oven for almost half an hour and not ecpect it to dry out!

This is a very handy and fast way to cook salmon.
But I like to put some tomato and raspberry salad dressing on it to bake, it already has the oil in the dressing and the tomatoes and raspberry gives it a great flavour.

I used Chinook (King) salmon. It was fast and easy but the lemon juice was overpowering and took away from the salmon. I would cut back to 3-4 T. I prepared this just as instructed except like other reviewers I used fresh garlic that I minced and added the dill to the sauce.

I have to be honest, I'd use the Baked Salmon II recipe by LADYBLADE before using this one again.  I can't really complain, though.  The dill and lemon flavors were good.  I just prefer fresh garlic over powdered.  I will try this one again with the suggestions from the other users before giving up on it.  Not at all a bad dinner, just not amazing.

I have tried this recipe with the following modifications: 
Olive oil instead of butter
Half a cup of fresh lemon juice 
Fresh dill half a cup 
A.Tsp.  of Dijon mustard
Fresh crushed  garlic
Sea Salt and pepper
And watched so the fish does not cook too much! It was very delicious indeed!

I really liked this recipe. The salmon turned out nice and moist and flaky - it wasn't dry at all. 
Next time I will use less butter. Although the butter made a nice rich flavour, it also was a bit too heavy for my liking.

It was super easy to make! It tasted delicious! I used unsalted butter instead. It was what I had on hand. It helped to control the salt content. Thanks for sharing. I will make this again.

Delicious and super easy. I made only 8oz for one person in foil on the BBQ (for 25 min) and it was delicious!  I didn't have dill so I subbed Herbes de Provence. Still excellent!

Made for one. Added a teaspoon of lemon pepper, sprinkled on to salmon. Might add yellow bell pepper for colour, next time.

This recipe was excellent! I have never really enjoyed salmon, but perhaps it was because I didn't know how to cook it. I used a parchment baking bag, so I did not melt the butter; instead, I sprayed the bag with a little butter, spread a small amount of light butter on the salmon, topped with the garlic powder, salt, pepper, dill, then lemon slices. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. I loved it! Can't believe I wasted all these years not enjoying salmon.

I don't like seafood and never liked salmon before I tried this recipe. It's so simple and delicious! It's part of our regular rotation now. Even our picky kids eat it.  I serve it with herb and butter rice (from the package) and fresh roasted asparagus. It's an easy weeknight meal! Thanks!

After I followed some of the suggestions and halved the dill and lemon juice and baked it covered, it came out perfectly.

Made this for dinner tonight and thought it was good but felt that it was more butter sauce then needed even for 3 pounds of salmon that I made. I also added the dill and garlic to the butter sauce. I Think I would also try using this with oil next time instead of butter to keep it a little healthier and less greasy. I also used fresh dill instead of dried. Overall, pretty easy to use and makes for a nice complement to fish.

I thought this was great.  I had two pounds of salmon, but I didn't quite double the other ingredients.  I used 6 TBS of butter, 6 TBS of lemon juice, a heaping TBS of dill, and two cloves of chopped garlic which I mixed together.  I got a lot of compliments.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!!! Made this twice already, and my hubby loved it both times! I used minced garlic from a jar (and lots of it- hubby is from India and loooves flavour!). Sometimes we add red chili flakes for an extra kick! And after reviewing other ratings, I secured foil around the fish to keep the sauce in and then poured it on the plates after... had it with peas and rice. Mmm!

This was excellent!  My boyfriend and I made it together for Valentine's Day dinner and we were both very pleased with the taste.  We didn't even have enough lemon juice, but it still turned out so delicious.  It was my first time making Salmon and I will definitely make this again.

this is really delicious!!! i already made it twice this week. i followed some of the other suggestions: butter and lemon i did 4tbs each(next time i'll do 2 of olive oil and 2 of butter) and 2 tbs of salt. i also made a little pouch and it was really moist and simply very good. my bf was impressed. i served w/ rice the first time, poured the sauce on top. the second i served w/ steamed veggies and used the extra sauce to toss. it added so much flavor. in one word, delicious. i'm making it for 8ppl tonight, i know they'll love it.

Definitely too much dill, but still delicious. I used the extra sauce to cook some rice and veggies. I think next time I will bake it with the rice and veggies in a covered dish for the same amount of time.

Great, EASY salmon dish.  I foil packed mine first, then opened it up for an additional 8+ minutes.  Terrific.  Thanks for sharing!

Really yummy! Cooked it in foil packet with 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil and juice of one lemon, plus minced garlic, dill. Ate it with wild rice, buttered peas, and salad. Thank you for posting!

I did as other reviewers recommended and used fresh minced garlic, also added the dill to the butter sauce. It was great!! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is FAST & EASY which is wonderful.  I used frozen salmon fillets and it still turned out wonderfully.  The only thing I changed was I mixed the dill in with the butter/lemon mix.  I topped the salmon off with a little more before placing in oven and it turned out great.  I was worried I had overdone it on the seasoning due to only using two fillets but it was perfect.  Will definitely use again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe is awesome! I thought I prepared salmon well before, but this took it to a new level. The only changes I would make the next time are to add capers and use a little extra lemon juice.

While I don't eat seafood I do cook it for the family.  This recipe received 5 stars from those eating it and 5 stars from me for it's total ease of preperation and cooking!  Due to a limited salt diet I substituted the S&P with Mrs. Dash, but still used the garlic and dill.  (Must admit- I didn't measure the spices though, I just sprinkled until it looked good.)  Thanks for sharing, this one is a keeper!

Oh my freakin' goodness, this salmon was soooo good! But I think a quarter cup of butter was too much. Next time I'm gonna mix w/butter and olive oil, it'll probably be better. I didn't have dill so I sprinkled Italian herbs instead. Fresh garlic spread on top was super fabulous!

very good, I did not have lemon juice so I improvised and squeezed the juice from a decent size orange, did not have the same issues others had with the dill, It was the best Salmon I have ever made, very moist and the flavor was very good, dont know if Ill even try it with the lemon since the orange worked out beyond my expectations

We really didn't like this.  It wasn't a waste of ingredients but we won't be making it again.  To much butter, really to much dill.  The flavors are a  good idea but you can have to much of a good thing.  I think if we would ever try it again we would put a pat of butter on each fillet, a slice of lemon and a sprig of fresh dill and steam it in a pouch.

Making this for the second time the recipe fared much better than the first! I reduced the lemon by half and added a bit of sea salt directly to the lemon/butter/dill sauce. My daughter is not a fan of dill at all, so I separated a quarter portion of the salmon and cooked sans the dill in another foil.

My family (not a seafood eating one) loved this....I prepared it in a frying pan flipping it once.   I cooked it covered to retain the moisture and then at the end, removed the lid and let it blacken slightly.   They loved the 'blackened' seasoning with the salmon!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!  (I also reduced the buttered and increased the lemon juice...to be healthier and use my lemons...I live in AZ with many, many citrus trees)

Excellent.  Made this for dinner last night, cook time was perfect, it was tender and flaky (I normally overcook Salmon), I will be using this recipe from now on.  Served it with Pan-Fried Asparagus from this site, wonderful dinner.

Nice, simple and delicious.  I made a few changes.  I used fresh dill and fresh garlic and replaced butter with extra virgin olive oil.  I also slightly brown the salmon by broiling it for 5 minutes.  Will definetly make this dish again.

Excellent!  Every member of the family devoured the salmon.  I followed other reviewers advice, and cut back dill to 1/4 tsp, mixed it in to the melted butter, along with the crushed garlic, sea salt and pepper, before pouring over the salmon, which I wrapped in foil.  This will go in the regular rotation for sure.  : )

Excellent! In my opinion, seasonings for fish should be light and minimal--a good piece, cooked well, stands on its own and it's easy to overwhelm with too many spices or a rich sauce. This was easy and delicious, and went great with a spinach salad and white wine. A healthy, savory meal.

I used salmon steaks with this recipe. I substituted the garlic powder for about 4 cloves of chopped up garlic, used only 4 tablespoons of real lemon juice, used less dill, covered it with thin slices of lemon, and then covered the pan with aluminum foil. I let this cool for about 20 to 25 mts then removed the cover and broiled it for about 5 mts. Everyone (husband, and even the kids) loved this one. I think this may be my favorite recipe from this sight!!!

This is such a delicious recipe for salmon. The dill may not look very appetising, but it is really great. Garlic powder is unnecessary, though. I love it (:

Quick, simple to prepare.  Would suggest cutting down time alotted by recipe.  Did so the first time I made it, fish was done and there was sauce to use.  (Added mushroom slices the last 10"... delicious.  When I made the dish again & used the full amount of time suggested, the fish was dry and the sauce completely gone.

Nice fresh taste perfect for summer! I cut it to 2 servings, and the 25 minutes left it a little over cooked. I will try reducing the cooking time in the future. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first time doing salmon and it tasted great.  My husband loved it. I didn’t have any dill and I did sprinkle the fish on both sides with Mrs. Dash extra spice seasoning (which isn’t spicy at all but very good) and it came out great. Next time I make this I will do it on the grill wrapped in foil to give the fish a bit of a smoky flavor.

We substituted thyme for the dill because we didn't have any and it turned out great! Will definitely make this again.

YUM!!  I bought some nice Salmon Filets and wasn't too sure what to do with them. I used your recipe only I put it on the gril for about 15 minutes instead of baking because it was too hot to have the oven going.

Nice, simple recipe!  I did this on the grill, but being the experience salmon eater I am, I know this would be just as lovely baked, and with the butter as opposed to the olive oil I drizzled it with.  I topped the salmon with a few lemon slices and the seasonings, wrapped and grilled for maybe 10 minutes - wasn't quite done so I opened the pouch, closed the lid on the grill and cooked another 5 minutes.  Perfect! Ate leftovers cold on a salad the next day.  Only other change was to use fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  Thanks for sharing!

I mixed everything together and poured it over the salmon and it turned out good. Honestly, I think that helped because some of the dill weed and lemon juice ran off, and it was still a little strong for us. My husband and I also like it using olive oil instead of butter.

This was the best (and one of the easiest) ways to prepare salmon I have found.  Buying fresh, wild salmon is the way to go too...farm raised just can't compare.

For not being a big salmon eater, I really liked this recipe. I used reduced fat margarine instead and didn't miss the butter at all. I also took the advice of others and mixed the dill and garlic powder in with the butter and lemon juice. Thanks! :)

Very simple and quick.  It was a little much on the butter.  That might be due to the scaling that was done.  Over all, it was still tasty.  My bf ate it all...he loved it.

Excellent recipe. I added the dill to the butter and that worked well and I also used real garlic. The dill flavor was very strong so I might use a little less next time. But all in all, very good!

Fabulous!  I used fresh dill (just happened to have it) and baked at 400.  Next time I'll use more lemon - we love lemon and you could barely taste it.  The salmon did not lose it's flavor at all with this recipe - just enough ingredients to enhance!

Great flavor, although we used a clove of fresh garlic rather than the powder. A little bit much liquid, but at least it was nice and saucy.

My daughter thought it was perfect! (that's saying something)
I overcooked it a little so it was a little less flavorless.
My husband rated it as "OK"
Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of using salmon, I used some fish we had caught ourselves.  It still turned out great.  Dill is a great way to get rid of that "fishy" flavor if that's something you don't like.

Didn’t like it.  The dill doesn’t work for me with salmon as it might a white fish.

This is delicious and the easiest recipe I’ve ever made when it comes to flavouring salmon. I Mix all the ingredients in a microwaveable bowl, pierce the salmon and drizzle all over and bake. Incredible flavor.

Fantastic! Left out the butter and used lemon slices instead of juice. Grilled in a tinfoil pouch and it came out tasty.

I followed the suggestion of mayo instead of butter. This was great for my palate- hard to find recipes for salmon that aren’t sweet and this was delicious

I used all ingredients as stated. But i Rubbed in garlic salt and seasoned with Black pepper before pouring in the Lemon/Dill(1/2 tsp)/Butter sauce. Cover it completely in foil and baked at 180deg, then open it up and baked with top heat Only at 220deg for 12 mins! Came out Perfect! Will definitely do it again!

buttery and lemony goodness. 
 I  made this to  go in my own Quinoa bowl. Cook 1 and 1/4 dry quinoa(cook in water its better to let the flavors shine through) cool and toss with 3 cups arugula and 1 cup shredded red cabbage. 
in a separate bowl zest and juice one lemon and one lime 1/2 cup oil 1 clove garlic  fresh parsley about a 1/4 cup coarsely chopped s/p to taste I used 3/4 t salt and 1/4 pepper use a food processor or blender (I have a wand) pulse a minute scrape down and another minute is all it takes. 
pour over the Quinoa mixture toss well and serve along side the salmon. Dinner perfection.
for a stronger lemon taste put a fresh lemon wedge for a squeeze.

My husband and I thought this recipe was good but nothing special. 5 tablespoons of lemon juice seemed a bit much so I reduced this to 3 tablespoons. I used fresh dill and fresh vs, dried should be 3 times more fresh, so I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh dill which would be the equivalent of  1/2 tablespoons of dried dill. When the dish was finished, there was more butter than needed, but I served the salmon with a mix of brown basmati rice and wild rice and the lemon garlic butter sauce also flavored the rice. So, this was fine. If I were to make this again, I would increase the dill to the recommended amount and use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. We all love garlic and the garlic powder was not discernible. We have salmon often and i don't think this recipe offers the flavor that some of my other recipes have. I will try it one more time with more dill and fresh garlic to see if this makes a difference. What I made was good but nothing to rave about. I would also like to mention that I mixed all of the seasonings in the butter sauce before topping the salmon

So easy and the flavor was fabulous with boxed italian mushroom risotto from Walmart! So delicious, highly recommend this. I used fresh lemons, garlic, and added a special Cedar Plank Salmon seasoning and Mrs. Dash Original from Sam's club instead of just salt and pepper.

Been making this for 5 years or more.  For two people, we use 1 tbsp of butter/margarine, 4 tbsp of lemon juice, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of dried dill, about 1/8 tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp pepper.  Mix up and pour over the salmon.  Line a roasting pan with foil for easy clean up. We always have rice with it, and use the butter/lemon mix as "gravy" for the rice. Wonderful.

This was really good, and will become part of my fish recipe rotation. The only thing I did different was to mix the dill with the lemon butter, per other reviewer recommendation. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was so good! I took the advice of others and wrapped in foil...using fresh garlic, 1tsp dried dill (added to the butter sauce) and one less TBS of butter. Cooked perfectly and will make again. Thanks for this recipe!

Very simple and very tasty. I didn't make a bunch of changes, except to use fresh dill and fresh garlic and add a squeeze of lime juice. My wife, who doesn't eat salmon, had the same sauce on a piece of chicken and really enjoyed it as well.

I used a whole salmon fillet and skipped the butter because I am diet conscious.  I forgot to put the garlic but the taste was really good moist and not fishy
thanks  for this good recipe

I made this again last night for the third time.  I bought the salmon fresh for $7.00 (6 oz.).  I froze them for about a week, defrosted in the refrigerator  36 hours.  This time, besides using really good salmon filet's, I doubled the dried Dill, and more lemon juice and butter.   Wow!  This is possibly the best salmon I ever ate.  Even at first rate restaurants.  Neither my wife or I could eat the whole piece, so today lunch is a Salmon Cesar salad.

Sooo good and so easy to make! I foolishly purchased four pounds of fresh salmon on deep discount and needed a tasty recipe to cook it up; this recipe did not disappoint! I did what other reviewers said and added the dill seed to the butter/lemon mix. I also made small cute in the salmon fillets so the flavor soaked all the way through the meat. And I put sea salt, pepper and garlic powder on the fillets BEFORE adding the sauce. Mine ended up cooking longer due to the amount & thickness I was cooking but definitely do NOT overcook fish; the longer you cook, the drier it becomes & you lose that delicious sauce you are cooking with! Bake this starting with the shortest time first then add minutes as needed until cooked through and flaky. My picky family LOVED this and I will be making it again soon :)

A tasty way to prepare salmon!  I used 1 clove of fresh garlic instead of powdered, but otherwise no ingredient changes. I mixed the butter, lemon, garlic, dill, sea salt and pepper together and poured it over the salmon and baked 25 minutes. The flavors were well balanced, and I would not change a thing.

This is a delicious recipe with a very mild mix of flavours. I did it in tin foil and also mixed the dill and 1 clove of fresh garlic into the butter and lemon. I will do this for company who like fish as it was just as good as fish I've had in high end restaurants.

Insanely juicy, tangy, and buttery! I had to sub the lemon for lime but it still worked perfectly fine, however i only put 4 tbs in case the acidity overpowered it.

Made this as written the first time except that I put fresh chopped dill in the sauce and liked it very much.  As always,  reviews are very helpful.   Will try again and perhaps sear skin on stovetop  first.

I made no changes to the recipe. It was salmon fillets drowning in a sea of buttery goodness. My daughter said it was the best salmon I've ever made. Woohoo! Perhaps adding the dill to the butter would be OK, but not necessary. Thanks!

Not as flavorful as I thought it would be.  Only changes were to use olive oil instead of butter and wrapped salmon in foil.  Used fresh garlic instead of powdered.  Really, it was the dill flavor that didn't come through.  Will try again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out delish!! Love the combination of the herbs and lemon. Definitely one of my favorite ways to cook salmon. I cook for a couple minutes on broil at the end to give it the "crust" that I really like on salmon

Wonderful easy salmon dinner!  We use it often; better, far easier than grilling.  Sometimes we add capers, usually a dusting of paprika, but nothing that really alters overall taste/texture.  It's just too good to mess with, even for an inveterate recipe adapter.

This recipe was a big hit with my friends! I used 3 large salmon fillets (approx 1.5 lbs), light butter, only  2 Tbsps of lemon juice, one fresh garlic clove minced, and fresh dill instead of dry. As others recommended, I combined all ingredients to make the sauce and poured it over the fish right before baking.  I will definitely make this again!

I did what the others said about putting the dill in the butter sauce and added minced garlic.  I also wrapped the salmon in aluminum foil and placed lemon slices on top of the salmon.  It turned out really delicious!

I made as recipe suggests, using more or less of what my husband likes. We used fresh Meyer lemons from my moms tree and when I asked my husband if he liked it he said "Yeah, it's pretty good" and his voice raised a bit, which actually means he really liked it. Will make for him again, especially when we have those fresh lemons.

This recipe was fine.

The salmon fillet cooked just lovely and evenly.

I substituted the butter with unsalted butter because that's what was in the fridge. I also substituted the garlic powder with garlic salt. To compensate for the unsalted butter. 

It was great! I will probably use the same recipe again.

This is a great simple recipe. I mix all of the spices into the lemon butter, then spoon it over the salmon; it seems to  coat more easily and evenly that way. I also use a baking dish that's just large enough to fit the salmon, so that the extra lemon butter sauce coats the underside of the fish too. My family prefers this with a little less dill,although I like the ratios exactly as written myself.

I never cook, but I saw this recipe and thought it was something I could make. I put in half the amount of dill and not much lemon juice because of other reviews I read. The salmon came out great! The only thing I would change is using really lemons instead of lemon juice. The lemon juice just kind of soaked into the salmons skin on the bottom. Other than that, it was a great dish that I would cook again.

We are not big salmon fans, but this was delicious. Used fresh dill and mixed it with the butter. Also used only 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Cooked the salmon on a cedar plank that had been soaked in salted water. Grilled for 25 min on a closed propane gas grill at 400 degrees. Will definitely make it again.

Mix the dill in with less butter which you've subbed with olive oil. Lime juice for lemon and fresh pressed garlic vs powdered. Healthy, easy and delicious.

Delicious and so easy.  I used sockeye salmon for the recipe and served it over rice as suggested.  I reduced the cooking time to 20 mins and could have shaved a couple of more minutes off the time.  My entire family loved the recipe and raved about the results.

Great base recipe - five stars for me with my changes! I halfed the amount of butter and mixed some olive oil in instead. I also put the dill directly into the lemon butter mixture and used fresh garlic. I drizzled it over the salmon and used a pastry brush to evenly coat each side - the result was a VERY juicy and delicious piece of fish. Definitely going into my regular rotation!

Followed suggestions of other cooks and put the sauce ingredients all together and poured it over the salmon. Nice flavor. The  wild sockeye salmon was a bit tough, so I will play with the baking time when I make this again.

I've made this recipe several times now and it is simple, delicious and foolproof. The only thing I do differently is use as many fresh ingredients as I can get my hands on - fresh dill if available, fresh chopped garlic, fresh lemon juice and fresh wild caught salmon if I can find it, though I also used frozen salmon steaks once and it still turned out delicious. Husband loves it and he's not a big salmon fan. Highly recommend it.

This was my first time making salmon and my step-dad said it was genuinely the best salmon he's ever had. I used foil and it turned out really juicy. I am not sure if it is supposed to be that juicy, but it tasted pretty phenomenal and was easy to make. A big thumbs up from me for this recipe!

I didn't have any garlic powder, so I used some fresh crushed garlic.  Use garlic powder.  The dill weed adds good taste, but I think the amount should be cut in half, if not more.  Maybe I'll try it again, and it will be a five star review.

This recipe was good.  I doubled the dill, but it still lacked some spark. Next time, I'll use more lemon, and liberally include onion slices under and on top of the fish.

I tweaked the recipe as I was going along. I cut the lemon down to about 2 tablespoons, and as other reviews mentioned I mixed the dill in with the lemon butter sauce. I laid lemon slices over the salmon as it cooked, as well. I also spooned some of the sauce over the steaks just before serving. It came out delicious, but I'll probably tweak it a bit more next time I cook it until it suits my tastes better.

I shoulda gone a little heavier on the dill, but I had to dry it on the fly from some fresh dill. Also, definitely wish I had used a lemon slice. It was still a stellar dish. I'd recommend using a little more spice and tang if you don't want it to be too bland, and perhaps saving a little lemon butter for after cooking, but that's to your taste. Also, if you're confused on how much salmon to use, I used 2 1lb fillets, and skinned it.

One of my favorite recipes! We usually have this once a week. Definitely mix the dried dill in with the butter sauce, and spoon it over the fish. I also add little slices of lemon on top. Tastes amazing even using vegan butter (cause of milk allergy in the family).

I make this ALL the time! Probably about once a week! Delicious and so healthy! Instead of lemon juice though I use a real lemon.

Wanted a variation for my usual salmon recipe (lemon juice, salt and pepper).  The butter and dill is super simple and makes a huge difference for adding to the flavor.  Don't be afraid of butter!  :-)

Great flavor! I followed the recipe amounts exactly (I hate when people rate a recipe that they didn't follow) I did take the advice of other reviewers and put the dill in the butter and wrapped in foil. Absolutely delicious and will make this for my family again!

This fish was very tasty. I think the amount of lemon and dill are perfect together, although the dill is a little strong. Maybe 2/3 of a Tablespoon would be better. We bought a pound and a half of fish so the cooking time was perfect, it was very flaky but not dry. I love salmon and this is one of my favorite quick seafood dishes.

Excellent! If you're making a larger fillet, be sure to go easy on the lemon juice -- if you try to double the recipe, the salmon will be overly tart.

I substituted limes for lemons and just barely eked out 4 Tblsps. from the limes but it was enough. When I sprinkled the dill over the salmon it seemed like a lot but it was really good. Thanks for an easy and tasty dish.

Pretty good, kind of plain-tasting. I was only making two fillets so I didn't measure anything, just mixed in what looked like the right amount. As some other reviewers recommended, I baked the fish in separate foil packets. This worked, but my thinner fillet ended up overcooked and chewy - hard to tell when it's done if you have to open a packet to check. So I'm not sure I liked this method, if I make it again I'll just try a baking pan.

There was either too much dill or too much lemon for us.  It was better in the thicker sections.  My husband does not want me to make it again, but it's not that bad.

I love this recipe! I'm on a low FODMAP diet for health reasons, and I'm always looking for tasty and safe recipes I can enjoy with my family. Since garlic is prohibited for me, I simply replaced the garlic powder with a squeeze of garlic-infused olive oil to make it safe for me to eat. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. It was a big hit with my family, and I will definitely be making this again. :)

Turned out incredibly moist and delicious.  Our favorite of the many Salmon recipes we have tried so far. As others recommended, I wrapped my filets in aluminum foil and baked for only about 15 minutes and that was plenty.

I have been making salmon with these ingredients for years, except I make it in the microwave, in a covered dish, for about eight minutes for 1 lb. of filets. I serve it with pasta and steamed leeks. For years it's been my quick meal for family, but lately I've served it to company and gotten rave reviews. If you're really in a hurry, dried dill works fine.

I wrapped each pieces of fish in foil with seasoning and small pad of butter then put on the grill for 15-18min. It was awesome. Great for taking to BQ's when it's BYOM. Thanks!

I followed the instructions exactly and cooked for 22 minutes.  It was fantastic!  The only change I would make next time is to use less butter.  Very savory and yummy - a new staple in my household!

This was really great!  We were in the mood for salmon, so I tried this recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  The lemon/butter combine is so tasty and the dill and garlic was nice added to it.  Followed the recipe exactly, but mine took a little longer only because they were kinda thick.

This was not a hit.  There was no flavor inside the salmon.  Lemon Dill Salmon is my favorite way to have salmon so I will be looking for another recipe to try.  I will not try this again.

My husband and I loved this dish! I followed the suggestions of others and mixed the butter, lemon juice, and seasoning altogether and then poured it on and around the salmon. It was a bit too much lemon flavor so I would also decrease to 3-4 Tbsp as others also suggested.

Nice enough to be a go to recipe.  I love how quick you can prepare it.  Part of that is because fish is so fast to cook but it is also because this isn't complicated.

This salmon recipe is perfect.  If you like lemon, this salmon has just the right amount of bite.  I usually add a little more dill to the mix and cut down the butter a little bit.  Perfect!

Maybe I cooked it too long (keeping warm for my husband to come home) but it wasn't anything special.  However, maybe that was just the cooking, so I won't give it any lower rating just because of that.

I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and mixed the dill with the liquid ingredients.  Also, I put the salmon into a handmade tinfoil packet.  Both very good ideas. My husband and I both loved salmon this way.  Will definitely make again soon.

Not so great.  I'm a first time fish eater. I never really liked fish or grew up eating it but I'm trying to eat healthy and thought fish should be in my diet. I tried this recipe because it had such great reviews but for me it was not good at all. My husband, however, devoured it. For me the flavors of dill and lemon were just too tangy and strong. I think I need a heavier sauce to cover the fish smell/taste to adjust my pallet to the new flavor of fish. Tonight I'm trying something different. I'm marinating salmon in a sauce I made up myself. It consists of orange marmalade, Italian dressing, Raspberry vinagarette, and Lipton onion soup mix. I'm hoping the sweet flavors of these ingredients are more appealing. I guess I can't say the lemon/dill salmon was awful because my husband raved about it and ate his plus mine.. but thank you for sharing this recipe anyway.

Amazing. I wrapped this in foil and took another reviewers suggestion to serve with rice to soak up the sauce. It was great. Thank you for a great recipe.

I used half butter and half light olive oil. I think it may be better to mix the dill into the butter sauce, mine just sat on top and didn't do much for the flavor.  I also put lemon slices on top, but still couldn't taste the lemon.  It was strange - it had all the ingredients for something great, but just didn't work out that way.  I may try it again when I'm in the mood for dill, but will add a little more seasoning.

This dish was quick and easy to make and came out delicious.  I did follow the advice of other comments and added the dill to the butter sauce.  I also cooked the fish in a foil envelope.  I would definitely make this again!

Easy, delicious, quick.  Can't ask for better than that.  Followed some suggestions made by other reviewers; a little less lemon and a little less dill.  Lots of compliments and a recipe I'll use again.  This review is amazing considering I've always said that I don't like salmon.  I do now!

Very easy to prepare and delicious as well.  I also added some chopped green onion to mine.  Make sure you keep an eye on the fish as it bakes so it doesn't overcook.

This is a great salmon recipe. Instead of salmon fillets I used a small whole Coho Jack and wrapped it up in foil to keep it moist. I used all the ingredients except the dill since I don't care for the taste of dill. I also used a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar instead of the garlic powder. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it turned out great. I will make this again.

Loved this combination, great with rice and steamed green beans. Just drizzle the plate with the sauce. My 4 yr. old twins even gobbled it up.  I did half the butter, used fresh minced garlic, and used 3T. lemon juice. Next time I would serve with lemon wedges too or just use the full amount of lemon.

I tried this recipe a while back and now it is the only recipe I use to cook salmon. My boyfriend Noah loves seafood and I actually dislike it, so I was nervous because I knew I wasnt going to taste it prior to serving it to him. He loved it and requests it quite often!

As delicious as it is easy. Only thing added is that I used fresh garlic (really wakens up flavor) and put salmon in tin foil packets for ultimate moisture. One of family favorites. Everyone loved. Even special housecat placed in other room so wouldn't pick off plate. We were greedy (and we never put cat away). LOL

Got home late and this was a perfect recipe. It was quick, easy and delicious. To this recipe I added dijon mustard to the sauce and after pouring it over the fillet, I place prociutto on top. Yummy! Thanks for this recipe.

I used much less lemon juice, and half butter, half olive oil. I think next time I will get fresh dill. Otherwise, a tasty, and easy recipe!

I'm not a salmon fan, but this was excellent!  I used olive oil instead of butter, added garlic, and mixed all the ingredients before hand and "marinated" the salmon overnight - very yummy!

This is a super simple, quick and delicious way to do salmon or arctic char. Simple ingredients you usually have on hand and no real prep/marinate time, etc. Fresh lemon, dill and garlic make a difference but the dry spices work well too.

My hubby keeps asking for more!!! Just make sure to rub the salmon with the spices to bring out the flavor. I baked in in tin foil on 350 degrees for 25 minutes and it comes out perfect each time!

Super delicious ~ I used fresh Coho salmon and 1 clove of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I omitted the salt ~ not needed.  Served with basmati rice and vegies.  Drizzed the lemon & garlic sauce over the rice.  This recipe is a keeper!

The recipe is fine.  I think that I just don't really like dill or lemon with main dishes very much.  My hubby liked it and thought it was good.  So, if you like lemon & dill, you'll probably like it.

It was so wonderful to find a simple recipe that my children loved!!!  We had to stop one of them from eating it all!  I used 1/2 Tbsp of dill added to the butter/lemon mixture and it was perfect!  Thank you Rebecca!  I will make this again!

This was delicious.  For anyone who likes a little crust on their fish, I added some bread crumbs and mixed them with parsley and garlic powder during preparation to create a light crust over the salmon fillets.  Then I poured the butter sauce on top as normal.  It turned out so flavorful and really filled up the room with a great smell as well.

For 2 salmon fillets, I reduced the butter to only 2 Tablespoons, the lemon juice to 3 Tablespoons, and the dill weed to 1/2 Tablespoon.  Very strong flavor and great healthy meal.

This recipe was very tasty!  Everyone loved it.  I took the advice of another reviewer and marinated the salmon in lemon juice for about 30 minutes.  My experience with salmon is that the smell can be a bit much.  The lemon juice was an excellent marinade.

Very, very good recipe. My family really enjoyed this a lot! I used unsalted butter to cut down on the amount of salt. Other than that, I prepared the recipe as written. My son had the leftover salmon for lunch and he said it was still very moist and delicious. Thank you for submitting this recipe. YUM!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I took the advice of another writer and used olive oil instead of butter.  Using butter makes me feel guilty for the fat content.  I also used lime instead of lemon, and it turned out delicious.  Next time instead of black pepper, I think I'll try cayenne pepper to give it a little more kick.

This recipe is wonderful!!!  The flavor is light yet delicious.  Best salmon recipe I have tried-my husband loved it too!  He keeps asking me to make it again...I covered the salmon as it was cooking to keep it from drying out though...and uncovered it the last 7 minutes...perfect!!!!

I loved this! I did reduce the dill to 1/2 tbsp and added it to the butter sauce. I also used fresh minced garlic. I'll definitely be making this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a huge hit with my husband and he's not a big fan of baked fish... The dill was a bit much, we plan on using less next time, but it was a lovely presentation with some white rice (which I made into cereal for our toddler who doesn't eat fish). It is really easy to make; it came out perfectly and I've never cooked fish before. We plan on using the lemon/butter/dill as a marinade for grilling too. It's really that good.

This sounded good, but I didn't think it had enough flavor. It seemed like the sauce ran off the fish and so the fish had no real lemon or dill flavor. I think a creamier sauce would be better.

The first time I made this, the dill was overpowering.  The second time I made it, I used about half the dill.  It was still overpowering.  Don't know if I'll try it again.

Very good and so easy to make!  I had never tried dill before and I loved it on the salmon.  I didn't use measuring spoons either so I had a lot of left over butter.  The salmon I had happened to have a buttery taste so the additional butter drizzled on top was a bit of overkill, but next time I'll add more dill instead.  The last 5-10 minutes of cooking the salmon I put it on broil and it was perfect!!  Crunchy on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside.  A definite keeper.

This was wonderful! I'm not too experienced with baking fish but this came out great and smelled wonderful while baking. I added a little more butter to the fish after it was cooked but aside from that, it'll be one of our family favorites!

The combination of dill and lemon complement the delicate flavor of the  salmon.  Instead of using butter, I substited light olive oil, along with the lemon juice to baste the salmon.  I grilled my salmon on a sheet of foil, and lightly sprinkled with the sea salt, freshly ground pepper, and dill.  Five minutes on each side yields a moist, yet well-done tender filet.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe, and so did my BF, which says alot because he is pretty picky.  I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the dill in with the butter sauce before putting it on the salmon, and also baked it for 25 minutes.

The lemony-dill flavor really added something to the fish, and it looked really good for being so easy!  I might even fix this for family get-togethers!

I made this for my husband and at first I was a little worried because I haven't been able to make fish that he really liked but he took one bite and said it was great. I followed the recipe but cut it down to one serving for just him. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple, subtle and delicious - my whole family loved this salmon. I used olive oil rather than butter, and mixed all the spices with the liquid before pouring it over the fish. Be sure not to overbake this.

This was a VERY easy recipe.  Next time I make this I will use just a little less dill though.  Also, I used spray butter and used the same amount, it measures great, a very buttery flavor and no fat!!!  It was moist and grilled very nicely.  This sauce is pretty good on grilled asparagus too!!!  Just put a bunch of fresh asparagus in a foil packet and cover with this sauce then grill in the packet. Thanks so much for this GREAT recipe!!!

This recipe was great.  We made 2 1/2 pounds of fresh salmon and we didn't have any dill so we added onion.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!!!!!!  THE BEST TASTING SALMON.
I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE TO ANYONE.

I did use minced garlic instead of powder, and a tad extra lemon juice. the cook time was perfect. This was my first time making a seafood dish... it was easy enough that I didn't mess it up and tasted good enough that a seafood hater like me could actually eat and enjoy it. Since I have promised my husband (seafood lover) to include seafood in our dinner plans more often... I'll be making this quite a bit! Thanks.

This was a nice change from our usual teriyaki marinated salmon. I've tried a few other recipes, but this so far has been the best non-teriyaki salmon recipe I've tried. I thought the cooking time was perfect as I usually have a hard time cooking fish without under or over cooking it. We will be making this again. Oh, and I mixed the dill with the butter mix and actually used lime juice instead of lemon since we didn't have any lemon. Next time I'll use lemon and see if I like it even better.

Flavorful with just enough lemon and dill to be extra tasty.  Baking the salmon makes it easy with less clean-up.
My husband doesn't particularly enjoy fish, yet he like this recipe.

Pretty good.  I thought it could have handled a little bit more lemon.  I think next time I will slice a fresh lemon and bake the salmon with the slices on top.  Really simple to make though!  A nice quick dinner.

There were mixed opinions on this one.  One liked it, but it wasn't his favorite.  My daughter and I both scraped a lot of the dill off and it still just wasn't to our liking.  Will probably not try again.

Very good, easy to follow recipe.  Used 4 salmon steaks and followed recipe except omitted garlic and reduced dill to 3/4 tsp.  Salmon was moist and tasty. I will definitely make again.

Although I loved this recipe my husband hated it.  Perhaps it is because I added fresh garlic and it overpowered the taste of the salmon.  My husband is not a fan of garlic. I loved the texture of the salmon as well as the taste.
