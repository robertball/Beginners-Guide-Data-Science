Definitely double the spices to get the best flavor, also if you use an entire can of coconut milk, just let it simmer longer to thicken it to the right consistantcy.

This was an easy and delicious meal that the meateaters in my family enjoyed as well. As the recipe said the chilli powder was to taste I doubled it. The only reason it gets a 4 is because a full can of coconut milk made it a little sloppier than I would have liked but that's just personal taste, I'll just reduce it slightly next time. I served this with basmati rice and Naan using a recipe from this site. Many Thanks.

I'm only giving this one three stars because it was okay (we ate it) but I won't be making it again.  It was very bland with the just the amounts of spices indicated.  I added lots more chili powder and some curry powder too.  Also you need to serve this with rice or couscous and the recipe doesn't suggest it.

I used frozen mixed vegetables instead of corn and peas.  I didn't use coconut milk or a sub, but we enjoyed the flavor of the dish!

I loved this recipe. I added a freshly juiced coconut for coconut cream (picked outside as I live in Hawaii) which was very tasty. I added frozen peas,carrots and corn mix and substituted eggplant since I didn't have carrots which we all thought was very tasty. I tried it again 2 days later and used cauliflower which was also good and added lamb. Yum!

I agree with some of the other reviewers who thought the amount of spices was insufficient. I almost doubled everything and still felt that there was something lacking. If I make this again, I'll add cayenne for sure, and maybe even some cinnimon. The coconut milk almost made me want to add something a little sweet. However, I really liked the mix of veggies and beans and I thought they went together well. I'm always looking for new things to do with beans!

I doubled the spices (added curry powder) and halved the coconut milk, as some reviews said, but it was still really flavorless. Granted, I did not use salt at first, and once I added some it was decent. Still, it didn't have the rich interesting flavor I was hoping for. It was a healthy meal though, so that was good.

We drained 2 cans of mixed vegetables in place of the potatoes & other veggies since we had them available. Also, my husband wanted to add beef, so we added a pound of stew beef, though It would have been just as good without it. Very hearty, flavorful, & delicious!

This recipe is rated based on the changes I made: subbed fresh broccoli and zucchini for the corn and peas, doubled spices and also addd about 1/4 tsp curry powder. Omitted water so it would be thicker and only used 8 oz coconut milk (all I had left). Very good, but I do wish I'd used the full 13.5 oz of coconut milk.
