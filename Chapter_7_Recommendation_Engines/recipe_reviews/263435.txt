"Great on any beef" says the recipe submitter. Indeed it is! I used this on 2 1/2 pounds of sirloin steak and you talk about tender and flavorful. I'll be making a huge batch of this to keep on hand for ribs and you name it. I make a lot of rubs and they all turn out good but this one stood out as being one of the better ones I've tried lately. Excellent recipe!

This is a great Rub. BBQed some Ribeye earlier with this on it. Lots of compliments on how well the steak turned out as well as the seasoning I used. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely keeping this one
