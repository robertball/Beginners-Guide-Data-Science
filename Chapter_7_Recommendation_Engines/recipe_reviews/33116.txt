An excellent recipe, but I had to give it 4 stars for two reasons. First, the recipe makes so much that it was much more than my 3 boys, husband and I could eat.  Second, the flavor is a bit balnd and needs a bit of spicing up.  To fix the first problem, I simply divided in half.  Instead of three eggs, I used one whole egg and one egg yolk.  To fix the second problem, I kept the original 2 Tbls of brown sugar for the divided recipe and added vanilla extract and a little bit of cinnamon.  Overall, the texture of the pancakes are soft and fluffy.  Even though they are made with oatmeal, you would not know that unless told.  My whole gang likes them, including the picky 8 year old. One word of caution though, these pancakes do not bubble the same way as normal pancakes, so make sure you turn them when the edges are slightly drying to make sure you don't burn them.

Even though I made some changes, these still deserve 5 stars.  The major change I made was using buttermilk in place of soy.  I would have used soy, but I don't really have any other uses for it, so decided to go w/the buttermilk I already had instead.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, and next time, will probably just use that and cut out the white flour altogether.  I used old-fashioned oats because I don't keep quick oats on hand.  They were great!  I also added a little bit more blueberries.  They were light and fluffy with a great texture inside and out!

Excellent and healthy. I have made these many times. If not a fan of soymilk you can substitute buttermilk or evaporated milk. I have made them all three ways depending on what I have on hand. These always turn out perfect. Easy and without the presevatives of packaged mixes.

Surprisingly moist, fluffy, and yummy.  My favorite Saturday ritual at home was having mom's all fat, sugar, and white-flour pancakes, but these had the same texture with more hearty taste;     even used all whole wheat flour, subbed applesauce for oil, splenda for sugar, and mostly egg whites;  couldn't part with my maple syrup (which goes even better with hearty, whole-wheat pancakes)

Definitely a different texture from your classic pancake, but that's part of what makes it good.  I use applesauce instead of the oil and regular milk instead of soy.  Add a few extra blueberries, they're good for you.  Delicious, and leftovers are good too.

These were very good!  My husband and kids cleaned there plates even though it was a "healty" recipe! I did make a few changes as other reviewers noted.  I used 1 cup buttermilk & 1 cup 2% milk instead of soy milk and I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for the olive oil.  I also added a few shakes of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla.  I made the blueberry syrup listed with a waffle recipe from this site for the topping.  What a tasty and healthy breakfast!!  Thanks!

I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the AP and half of the ww flour, clabbered the soy milk a bit with 2 t. of white vinegar and used raisins in place of the blueberries I did not have. Made  17 (1/4 c.) pancakes that got better towards the end as I gained more patience and resisted flipping too early!** I have since made these with blueberries, ww pastry flour for all the AP flour and 4t of vinegar for clabbered soymilk. Made 14 (1/4 c.) fluffy pancakes!

This is hardly the same recipe after all the tweaking we've all done. I used buttermilk not soy & old fashioned oats not quick & vegetabe oil not olive. VERY GOOD! This is a keeper.

My eighteen-month-olds loved these!  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and let the batter set for about 5 minutes to thicken up a bit.  I also added more blueberries as another reviewer had suggested.  Next time I will try applesauce instead of the olive oil (they had a slight olive oil taste).  I think that they would be great with bananas or raspberries too!

What a great breakfast! I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour in place of the other flours and I didn't have any blueberries.  They were awesome just plain though with a little maple syrup.  I will definitely be making these again!

LOVE THESE PANCAKES!  So good, I got my mom to replace her recipe for pancakes and she's the one who taught me everything I know about cooking.  I never have Soy Milk on hand (can't stand it), so I use 2% milk.  My first step is to put Whole Oats in a bowl with the milk and set aside while I prepare everything else.  I double the brown sugar and no one bothers to put syrup on them they're so sweet.  I make them at least once a month and we let the leftovers sit out a bit on a paper towel to dry and then freeze them for a toaster oven quick breakfast in the next week.

Best banana / whole wheat / oatmeal pancakes I have ever eaten in my life! I looooooove these pancakes.   I substituted soy milk for regular milk, used only whole wheat and mixed in small chunks of bananas. (about 2 bananas).   Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was definitely delicious! I substituted almond milk for the soy milk since I didn't have any soy milk. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla since other reviews suggested it. I doubled the amount of blueberries as well because, hey, I like blueberries! I would absolutely make these again!

My 5 year old ate 7 pancakes.  They were fabulous!  Update: I have now been making these pancakes regularly for almost a year.  As is they are delicious, but I have also found that they are very versatile.  When I don't have soy I use regular milk, when I don't have wheat flour I use white, and it still tastes great.  I have also tried finely chopped apple with cinnamon and nutmeg instead of the blueberries. Others I've tried were banana, fresh blueberries, fresh strawberries, and today I tried frozen mixed berries with a jar of apple blueberry babyfood and it still tasted great.  And I find most of the time my kids don't even ask for syrup they taste so good. This is an awesome recipe!!!

Great pancakes. As others did, I used applesauce instead of oil and only used 2 eggs. Added 1 tsp of vanilla. Will definitely make again.

This was a great base recipe. I had to make a few changes for taste though. I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and some vanilla. Also, there is WAY too much baking powder in my opinion and it left an aftertaste. Reduce the baking powder to 2 teaspoons. Other than that I love this healthy alternative to regular old pancakes!

I made a couple substitutions, based on what I'd done before with whole wheat/oatmeal pancakes. 

Two tablespoons of baking powder seemed excessive, so I scaled it down to two teaspoons. I used vegetable oil and buttermilk and added vanilla in with the milk.

I also tried blackberries in this recipe as I still had a bunch from last year that I need to use before I go picking again. 

These turned out well. This makes a lot of pancake batter, so you might want to wait for Sunday Breakfast or make this for a big family. The blackberries didn't make a huge difference in the substitution, as I drained most of the 
liquid I could out of them. It was just a different berry flavor.

I think if I were to make this again, I would pulse the oatmeal in the blender before adding it to the dry ingredients to make a smoother consistancy. As they do make a good pancake, I think it would be an even better muffin.

THIS MAKES A LOT of pancakes! They were hearty and super yummy! Very filling! I used 1/2 baking powder and 1/2 baking soda, as I don't care for the taste of baking powder much. I also used all whole wheat white flour, no AP reg. flour at all. I had Vanilla soy milk, so I used that. It gave it a great flavor! DOUBLE the blueberries too, it needs it! I would make these again in a heartbeat, DELISH!!

These were wonderful, they were surprisingly light and fluffy. I used whole wheat and oat flour instead of the all-purpose.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla, as many other reviewers have.  My kids requested chocolate chips instead of blueberries -- these pancakes were a big hit!  I doubled the batch and froze the extras.

I don’t normally get excited over pancakes, but these were excellent.  Unfortunately, when I reached for the bag of frozen blueberries I found out my husband had eaten them all.  I chopped some strawberries to use instead, however the pancakes didn’t need the fruit as they were very good plain. The only change I made was to use skim milk instead of the soy milk.  I also soaked the oats in the milk for an hour before mixing into the dry mixture. These are my new favorite pancake.

Great recipe - my 10 yr old who doesn't like "oats" changed her mind after eating these pancakes.  I didn't have soy milk on hand so I followed others suggestions regarding buttermilk.
Made the recipe again today with more variations.  Cut back baking powder to 1 tbsp.  Used all whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup plain yogurt and 1 1/4 cup skim milk.  Replaced sugar with honey.

Delicious hearty pancakes! Although I made a few changes... I used only whole wheat flour, skim milk instead of soy, canola oil, and frozen raspberries. I also added some cinnamon and a tsp. of vanilla. This was so good and devoured by all! Thanks for sharing!

These were excellent! Next time though, I will be sure to cut the recipe in half.  I had more than enough mixture left over.  I even froze about 7 good sized pancakes and still ended up pouring out the left over batter.

Light, fluffy, yet filling pancakes.  These are the kind of pancakes that help you make it all the way to lunch without feeling hungry.  I had mine with blueberries, the kids had a few chocolate chips in their's and my husband had his plain.  Everyone loved them!

this was exactly what i was looking for. I modified a bit. Added a couple tbls of ground flax seed and instead of quick oats, i used regular and ground them up first. I also added a little pumkin pie spice for flavor. They turned out great!

Initially I wasn't that fond of these pancakes, although my husband loved them. However, now I find myself craving them on a weekly basis. We do substitute regular milk and fresh blueberries, and occasionally add a touch of vanilla or flaxseed. I never would have thought to put oatmeal in a pancake, but these just keep getting better and better!

I made a few changes to the recipe based on other reviews and ingredients I had on hand.  I used only whole wheat flour and added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I don't allow soy milk in the house, so I used 1 cup of non-fat plain Greek yogurt and 1 cup of non-fat milk.   I don't think 1/2 cup of blueberries was enough to get blueberries in each pancake.  I'll increase that quantity to 1 cup the next time I make them.  If I wanted to cut the fat calories further, I'd substitute two egg whites for one of the eggs.  The recipe made 18 pancakes so I froze the extras for weekday breakfasts.

These make very light, fluffy pancakes and as another poster indicated, you'd never know there were oats in this.

We make pancakes at least once a week, always with 100% freshly ground whole grain and with the same substitutions each week no matter the recipe.  So as usual, I used all whole grain flour, coconut oil and coconut milk instead of olive oil and soy milk. We cooked them on low heat.  They do bubble differently but that wasn't so hard to figure out, and I'm used to blueberry or banana pancakes sticking a little to the griddle so no problems there.  I'm not sure what we did wrong with the ingredients, but we did not care for these at all!  The first taste wasn't so bad, but the after taste was unappealing. Even the 2 year old who will normally eat anything said, "I don't like it!" and pushed her plate away!  Same reaction from the 6 year old.

Used 1 cup oatmeal and 1/2 cup oat bran, which I soaked in the milk for 15 min. Added cinnamon and vanilla per other reviewers, also cut the oil to 2 TBS, using canola. GREAT pancakes. And I'm going to call them healthy. Even tho I changed it, it is worth all 5 stars!

I put in a special request for these pancakes for my Mother's Day breakfast. My husband and kids followed this recipe and the pancakes were the BEST I've ever had. They really are delicious! Even my 7 & 8 year olds loved them.  All the healthy benefits without the "healthy" taste.

LOVE! I never rate recipes but HAD to rate these,  SO good and it's not often that I find a recipe I love.  I did nit have soy milk, used skim milk.  Put choc chips in some and they tasted like oatmeal cookies.

Best pancake recipe ever!! This will be my go-to recipe from now on! I only had 2 eggs on hand, and they came out perfect! I made small pancakes and got over 20!! My husband found them very filling, and my 8 month old loved them! I took advice of one review and doubled the brown sugar, but i still added maple syrup!!

These were phenomenal!!  And for the purist, I'm sorry I didn't follow the recipe exactly. (One of the things I love about this website is other people's suggestions & experiences.)  I used all whole wheat flour, replaced oil w/ unsweetened applesauce, and subbed buttermilk for the soy milk, which I don't keep on hand or particularly care for. I also had old fashion oatmeal, which I ran through the mini chopper until a little less coarse & added a splash of vanilla. The result was a moist, delicious batch of pancakes w/ superb texture, that I'm guessing is at least as healthy as the original recipe & 100 times better for you than traditional pancakes.  I love the addition of oatmeal.  My only 'complaint' & it was my fault: I heeded a suggestion that this made too many and cut the recipe in half.  My bad--I ate 3 as soon as they came off the stove (not sure how that racks up on calories) & wished I had MANY more to freeze for later.  Thanks for sharing  an incredible recipe & the great suggestions!

for being healthier than regular buttermilk pancakes, I gave them 5 stars.  My two year old ate them WITHOUT syrup, and so did I.  I also halved the recipe, (using one whole egg and one egg without yolk) but kept the brown sugar at 2 Tbs, and used strawberries because I am not crazy about blueberries. Threw in a dash of vanilla, too~Definitely a keeper! :)

Awesome, awesome, awesome.  I have never had success with homemade pancakes until now!  Usually they come out tough, but these were tender, fluffy, and delicious.  Had no soy milk so I used skim.  I put fresh blueberries and strawberries in them and served with light whipped cream.  It was to die for!

Great recipe!! I halved the recipe, used skim milk instead of soy, used one egg and one egg white, omitted the oil, added 1tsp vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and used fresh blueberries. With these changes it made 8 pancakes (1/4 cup batter each) and the calorie count is right at 100 calories and 7g protein each. I will be making these again!

Made this for my friend and her family here in Australia and they l loved it! I was a little disapointed that they werent a little fluffier, but they did still taste good.  I used half buttermilk and half light milk instead of soy.  Added 1 tsp of vanilla and doubled the blueberries! I was very pleased with how much fiber was in these! Very filling without weighing you down, type of fullness. i'll make these again, hopefully i can get them to turn out fluffier next time around

These were great!  I used milk with 2 TB of vinegar (sub for buttermilk) instead of soy milk which I never have.   I found this recipe to be too salty so I cut back the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  An addition of 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract made this perfect!  It made a ton of pancakes which is fine b/c I popped in the freezer for a quick breakfast later.  Yummy!  I also enjoy using this recipe with different fruits...Oh which I doubled.

Loved these pancakes! Healthier but still very yummy.  I subbed canola oil for olive and reg milk for soy but it does not affect how the recipe turns out - will use this one again and again! Added slightly more blueberries than this called for.

So good! My husband thought these were the best pancakes I had ever made! I did make a few substitutions, using whole wheat flour for all of it, replacing the oil with butter, and adding some vanilla and cinnamon. So yum!  With a little sugar-free syrup, we'll definitely be making these again!

Good, but no pancake recipe worth its salt will tell you to beat the batter "until smooth." You should always leave pancake batter lumpy, unless you want flat, rubbery pancakes.

When our grandsons, Alexander & Aaron visited us this week, their grandpa and I  had just picked blueberries & wanted a delicious, but healthy recipe to share with them and their parents Dave & Connie. Although we have shared pancake breakfasts, we hadn't experimented much with home-made versions.  After reading other reviews,we chose this recipe to make together. We added 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp vanilla to the batter.  Used 1% milk, with 1 Tbsp vinegar vs. soy milk.  The pancakes were great - a wonderful taste and texture & enjoyed by everyone!  Fun to make - particularly with such willing apprentice chefs!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Four adults and two hungry boys (8 and 6) quickly polished these off - we agreed that with pancakes this good, the servings should be reduced to 4 from 8.

Really good, and man that's a lot of fiber! I left out the blueberries this go around and they were still good. I subbed canola oil instead of olive oil, and skim lactose-free milk instead of soy, and it worked well. I made a double batch and froze them individually wrapped to pop in the microwave later as needed.

This recipe was really good! Made enough for 5-6 servings. They came out really thick with a bit of a baking powder aftertaste so next time I think I'll cut the bp back by 1/2 tbsp or so. I added some vanilla and probably doubled the blueberries. Very good! Thanks!!

Yummy! I also tweeked this-I like a thicker batter so I added an extra quarter cup of flour. I also added a tsp of cinnamon. I would have used the vanilla like other people had used too but I couldn't find it. If your using syrup I don't think you'll miss it.

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe and substituted 1% milk for soy milk (I would have used almond milk if I had any left) and used applesauce instead of oil. I also added a lot more blueberries, and let me tell you: It tasted amazing. I don't know why I've never made my own pancakes before. And yeah, these do cook a little differently, so just watch the edges until you can get a spatula underneath the pancake without it sticking.

Thank you Carter for this delicious and healthy recipe.    If you are not planning on eating these with maple syrup, honey or another sweet topping, I would suggest adding extra brown sugar OR maybe add a tablespoon of real maple syrup to the wet ingredients.  I didn't have any quick oats, so I used old-fashioned (and let them sit in the wet mixture for about five minutes).  I was a bit skeptical about the olive oil (instead of canola), but we couldn't detect it. I followed other reviewers advice and added 1 tsp vanilla to the wet, and 1 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  We froze the remaining pancakes, and now have enough for a few quick and easy breakfasts for another day.  Thanks again!

Love these!  I found this while being dairy free.  My other half who won't touch dairy my free pancakes or "healthy" oatmeal or whole wheat.  When i make these they are scarfed up.  I've mde them with soy milk and vanilla rice milk.  The vanilla rice milk adds a nice flavor.  Thank you for a great pancake recipe.

I liked this recipe even though I ended up changing some things.  I used a whole pint of blueberries.  I used skim milk with vinegar to approximate buttermilk.  I added some cinnamon and vanilla for some additional flavor.  And finally I left out the oil by accident, but did not miss it.  I will definitely be making this again, and will try the soy milk if I have it on hand next time.

I was leary about having Oatmeal in pancakes, but these were great!  I only had wheat flour so no white.  Added a little vanilla and some flax seed.  Didn't have soy so used skim milk too.  Not a big fan of pancakes usually because of their weak nutritional value, but these seemed healthy and were really good!

These pancakes come out moist, so you won't need as much butter and syrup on the top. I used almond milk in place of soy and 1tsp agave syrup in place of sugar. I also added 1tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. So tasty!

WOW! These turned so Light and fluffy...i was  pleasantly surprised :) . The only things I changed was:1) I added 1tbs of white sugar along with the brown. 2) I used 1% Milk Instead of Soy Milk  I added 1/4 cup applesauce,  and Only half the Oil. I also added some vanilla Extract, a little cinnamon and lots more Blueberries!!!  Yummy :) 
oh ps I put the milk and oats in a saucepan with the oil, applesauce, vanilla and Cinnamon and brrought it to a simmer and then removed it from  the heat, added the eggs, then mixed it in with the dry mixture.

I made a couple of changes (per suggestions of others), but the end result was delicious! They are almost like "stove muffins", very fluffy. I didn't have soy milk on hand so made a little sour milk and used that instead. Also added about 1t of vanilla extract, 1/2 - 1t of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. 

As several others have noted, this recipe makes a ton of pancakes.  Next time will only make 1/2 a recipe. Great weekend breakfast!

These were good, I wont say that they were significantly great but they were good, good enough to deserve four stars and good enough to make again sometime. The only change that I made that probably wasn't all that significant is that I had a little extra buttermilk left in the carton so used half buttermilk/half soy milk and it turned out great this way. Also I used 2x as many blueberries but that was just to my individual taste. Also I think 1/4th a cop each pancake is a bit too small, I made mine more like 1/3rd to 1/2 of a cup each and it made 3 large pancakes for half of the recipe. So really I made no significant changes that would make the entire turn out really all that different from the original recipe.

This is a great starter recipe, but I made a few changes to make it even healthier, without losing that fluffy, indulgent pancake taste.  I use all whole wheat pastry flour in place of the flours mentioned. I also added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla.  In place of oil I use either applesauce or smashed banana.  My last change is that I take out the sugar.  If you still want a little sweetness, use 1/2t of agave nectar in its place (agave is much sweeter than sugar).  With the added sweetness from the fruit, I don't miss the sugar at all!

Delightful! I used soured milk (2 T. lemon juice + 2 c. milk, allowed to stand 5 min.) in place of soy milk, used canola oil in place of olive oil, and fresh blueberries, since that's what I had on hand. I also let the oats set in the milk about 5 min. before adding to dry ingredients. I will make this frequently!

These were awesome.  I didn't have whole wheat flour or soy milk but it didn't matter.  I was a little wary of the olive oil but I went with it.  Also, the batter looked very thin when I first put them on the griddle so I thought I did something wrong but they puffed up nicely.  Yum.

Beautiful and delicious pancakes. I don't keep soy milk or buttermilk in my fridge, so I mixed 1% milk and lemon juice. They turned out great- used up the last of our homegrown blueberries!

These were pretty good. I did use 2% milk instead of soy since that is what we always have. Also added some vanilla and subbed applesauce for the olive oil. They did taste really good and puffed up very nicely. The problem I had with this recipe is that it is so liquidy it takes the pancakes forever to cook. I'm used to pancakes cooking a lot quicker and so I didn't plan out my time very well. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again!

I was worried that the oatmeal would give these pancakes a weird consistency, but they didn't.  They were still light and fluffy... and for the most part- healthy!!  I added a tablespoon of ground flax seed to add a little more healthiness.  I make a double batch right away and then freeze the leftovers... it's nice to grab 2 or 3 out of the freezer, and pop them in the microwave for about a minute for a quick breakfast.  We love this recipe!!

I used 1/2 cup of apples instead of bluberries and the recipe came out fantastic! Yum! I will definitely make these again soon! They are very filling, I only had to eat one when I normally eat 2-3 normal pancakes so because of that the serving size may need to be adjusted. Or perhaps I'll just make a bunch and freeze them... definitely a keeper thanks!

I loved this recipe but also made changes.  I used all whole wheat pastry flour and 7 grain oats.  Also, if anyone has heard of Wildtree all natural foods, they have a line of grapeseed oils that are suppose to be even better for you than olive oil and they have different infused flavors.  I used 2 tablespoons of the butter infused grapeseed oil and 2 tablespoons of applesauce.  I let the oats soak in the soy milk a while to get them soft and added a little vanilla extract....so delicious!!

I used only whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, agave instead of sugar, a splash of lemon extract, a shake of cinnamon, and doubled the fresh berries.  I also only had two eggs and old-fashioned oats.  I found the inconsistent texture (both lumpy and runny) difficult to work with on the griddle.  Quick oats would have been smoother, but I still think grinding the oats in a food processor would have been best. I would also add the berries directly on the griddle instead of mixing them into the batter.  Good taste, but with all my alterations I can only give 3 stars!

Far and away the best pancakes I've ever had! So good you could eat them without syrup or butter. Made no changes except sneaking in a few extra blueberries. Used vanilla soy milk.

These are wonderful.  They definately have a different texture than regulary pancake, because they are wheat.  However, my husband who is a pancake junkie, says they are excellent.  The only thing I did different was use 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup water because I ran out of milk.

I really liked these, given that I added cinnamon and vanilla.  They aren't too sweet.  But my kids ate them without syrup and said I should definitely make them again.  After they had finished, I tried mine with syrup and beware!  These pancakes soak up a lot of syrup!  So, I think they actually do better without or maybe with very little syrup.  This recipe made about sixteen 5" pancakes.

I'd make these again.  I used all whole wheat pastry flour (no white).  I also added 1t of vanilla, a couple of shakes of cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  They were very light in texture but four made me stuffed!

Light and tasty, these are fantastic.  I'd followed to the letter the first time, and was woefully shy of ingredients the second (substitute regular milk, add 1 extra tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 cup extra blueberries and regular unbleached flour, plus melted butter instead of olive oil) and ya know, both were fantastic!  highly recommend either version, and will continue to make both. Yum!

My husband found this recipe, and decided to try it with Bananas. We didn't have the blueberries. They were absolutely Delicious! I would DEFINATELY recommend this recipe to a friend. I LOVE the fact that they are low cal and low fat. We Used Skim (fat free) Milk instead. thanks for a healthy alternative to a already great pancake!

I tried this recipe and realized as I put the first two pancakes on the griddle that I had completely forgotten the olive oil.  Since it was too late, I went ahead with them anyway.  They were delicious and no one missed the olive oil at all.  My kids weren't crazy about the blueberries so I made them again, this time using all whole wheat flour, a mixture of skim and low fat milk, and no olive oil.  They were so good! So, if you are watching your fat intake, you can totally make these without the oil!

These pancakes had an odd smell while cooking and just didn't taste great.  I followed the recipe except added a sprinkling of wheat germ and doubled the amount of blueberries.  Loved how healthy they were but won't be making again.

These were great! I've never made pancakes with oatmeal before, but they didn't taste oat-y or anything.  I didn't have soy milk, so I used 1 1/2 C skim milk. I used about a tbsp of olive oil and the rest applesauce plus fresh blueberries! My husband thought they were a tad salty, so I might reduce the salt next time.

Very good recipe.  I used old fashioned oats, but did not have blueberries on hand.  I made a half batch which equaled 6 pancakes.

I thought these pancakes were delicious-so light and fluffy, with a nutty texture. I substituted old fashioned oats for the quick oats, 1% milk for the soy milk and canola oil for the olive oil. I also only used 2 eggs, and they still turned out great. This will definitely be a keeper in my family!

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I made a few changes, though.  I ground the oatmeal in a food processor, used regular milk instead of soy, and used cooking oil instead of olive oil.  I don't add the blueberries to the entire batter but put the blueberries on each pancake as it is cooking. I put sliced bananas, pecans and cinnamon on half the batch.  My family loved it with bananas.

Well...  I read all of the reviews before trying this recipe and I thought I could make it work.  I substituted 1% milk for the soy milk and canola oil for the olive oil.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  These pancakes were a nightmare to make!!!  Like many of the other reviewers, I had trouble getting these turned.  Usually by the time the top was set enough to turn, the bottoms were way too brown.  And that was with my skilled heated at less than medium heat.  I had a few that turned out decent enough to serve and I thought they tasted good.  My 9 year old ate 1 1/2 and my 4 year old at 1 1/2.  They usually put pancakes away like there's no tomorrow.  I ate 3 of the pancakes.  Afterward, I noticed a weird after taste.  Ugh.  I think a couple of other reviewers mentioned that as well.  My kids aren't really picky and we eat a lot of whole grain products and healthy foods.  However, since we only have pancakes once a week anyway I think we will stick with the regular white flour, buttermilk, 'unhealhty' pancakes.

Soooo good! I used probably 3 times more blueberries than suggested, and used 2% milk rather than soy. These pancakes were hearty and delicious!! I had a difficult time flipping them at first -- it's really important to let them cook on the first side for long enough. Also, we had some of these left over, so I wrapped them in foil, froze them, and reheated them for about 10-15 minutes in the oven for a great weekday breakfast.

These were very good.  I used fresh blueberries and regular milk.  The only other addition is that I added some chopped, toasted pecans which gave the pancakes a wonderful crunch.

Great recipe, my family loved it. Very filling, my daughter will normally eat half a batch of pancakes but stopped after three of these.  I put the leftovers in the freezer with wax paper inbetween each one, we pull them out and warm in the toaster, they taste even better than when fresh.  Next time I will try to use applesauce instead of oil and eggbeaters to make it a little more diet freindly.

Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a healthy type, but give me nice, fluffy, fatty buttermilk pancakes over these anytime.

The flavor was fine but I wish there was a way to make them less dense. Also, some overcooked and others undercooked - it was hard to figure out when they were done.

These were pretty good.  My picky 14 month old gobbled them up!  I used applesauce instead of oil, added a little vanilla and wheat germ and used fat free buttermilk instead of soy.  My husband liked them better without the blueberries. Overall, they are a great choice, especially for getting kids to eat healthy foods.

Tasted pretty good. If I make this again, I will increase the amount of sugar and drop the blueberries onto the top of the pancakes before flipping so they do not turn an ugly brownish blue.

I had been looking for a pancake recipe that would be a little healthier and lighter than a regular pancake. I had the recipe scaled to 4 servings and made a few changes. They came out great. Instead of soy milk I used low fat buttermilk which had no fat and helped to add some thickness to the batter. Also, I used 4 egg whites in place of 1 1/2 eggs and eliminated the olive oil. As suggested by others who have tried this recipe I added 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.

These were really good and healthy.  They were great plain, being I didn't have any blueberries on hand, but I'm sure they'll only be better when I make them next time with the blueberries.

Because I have picky eaters that don't like to bite into whole blueberries, I put the oats and wet ingredients in a blender, blended until smooth.  Then added the dry ingredients and blended until mixed.  Finally, I blended in the blueberries.
You get a "blue" tinted pancake (what fun for the kids!) with the texture of buttermilk pancakes.  I also doubled the blueberries!  Who knew?

Really enjoyed the moist heartiness of this recipe! Like some other reviewers, I used applesauce instead of oil. I also substituted whole  spelt flour for whole wheat and whole milk for soy milk. I didn't have quick cooking oats so I coarsely ground up regular oats, and I also doubled the blueberries. Will definitely make again!

Amazing!  Even my 4 year old and mother in law both loved them!  I have no business changing someone else's recipe, but I did change olive oil to applesauce.  Second time I also doubled recipe for more people. Still good but It didn't come out as well. I'm sure there is an adjustment you chefs would do better.  Thanks for recipe!

I think adjusting some of the oatmeal for flour would make the consistency a little smoother. I didn't like it that much. Curious about the reason for using olive oil rather than vegetable oil?

The texture of these were surprisingly smooth and fluffy. I did add a little cinnamon and more blueberries for our taste. It was nice to enjoy pancakes and not feel guilty. Very yummy!

I like the jest of the recipe. As some others mentioned about a bitter aftertaste.  I noticed it too, which I think is from the baking powder. 2 tablespoons seems like a lot.  I will make these pancakes again using only 2 teaspoons of baking powder.  I used 1% milk, no oil applesauce instead. Used fresh blueberries (1 1/2 cups), only two eggs and added some cinnamon & vanilla.

I made some adjustments according to what we had on hand.  I used buttermilk instead of soy milk.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  I processed my oats in the blender first so the were more like flour.  And, for the flour, I used a cup of white whole-wheat flour.  I didn't add the blueberries directly to the batter, rather I dropped them into the pancakes as I put them on the griddle.  Also, as with any pancake recipe, I did not over stir the batter - you want to stir just until everything is moistened.  Once you have done that, let the batter rest a good 5 - 10 minutes before cooking; that will give you a fluffier pancake.

This is one of my favorite breakfast recipes!  I love the texture and taste of these pancakes.  You would never know there is oatmeal in the recipe unless someone told you.  I follow the recipe for the most part, with the exception of the soy milk.  I use whatever milk I have on hand (whole, skim, etc.) and they have always turned out great.  This Saturday I used buckwheat flour in place of the whole wheat flour, and they were one of the best batches I have made!  Highly recommend.

These are great...the only thing I would change is to up the blueberries which I did to about a cup.  For personal preference I used coconut oil in place of the olive oil.  Yummy!

Really enjoyed them. 1st time making these so followed the recipe, but used Almond milk because that's what I had plus extra berries. Olive oil is good for you, didn't add bad flavor. Not sure of calorie count for each? Ended up with 20 pancakes!! Will freeze and enjoy again and again!!

Made this recipe today for breakfast. Wow! Very light and fluffy, but very filling. I used whole wheat pastry flour and fat free milk. Very good, I will make these again!

Probably the best whole wheat waffle I've made!  These were fluffy and light, yet with the heartiness of whole wheat and oatmeal.  I really liked that they weren't overly dense like the texture of most whole wheat dishes.  The only changes I made were due to what I had on hand, and personal preferences.  I actually used all whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 of each. I left out the brown sugar because I like to sweeten with a good dose of maple syrup later. :) I used half the olive oil it called for and added a splash more milk.  I have regular old-fashioned oats and they worked just fine (just make sure to soak them with the milk for at least 5 minutes).  I removed 1 TB of oats to replace with 1 TB of protein powder - hey, why not get more protein while we're at it? :) For some added flavor, I added some cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as vanilla.  These pancakes start out on the thinner side, but they puff up wonderfully!  This is my newest favorite recipe for pancakes - very easy and quick to throw together, clean-up is also a breeze. Not to mention, healthy!  Although I made a lot of changes, they are minor replacements and additions that really do not alter the original recipe enough to not warrant giving it 5 stars!  It's very versatile to suit your tastes.  If you're looking for a light and fluffy whole wheat pancake recipe, this is a winner!  Thanks for sharing with us.

Loved this recipe...followed the list of the ingredients exactly, but didn't soak the oats in the milk beforehand (I will do that next time!) and will also try applesauce substitution for the oil, and cut down on the b. powder.  thank you for a great recipe, I'm trying to make healthier comfort food and this was a big help!

These pancakes turned out delicious.  I substituted original almond milk for soy, and used regular oats (not quick oats), and topped them with a dash of maple syrup.  Delicious.  They do turn blue from the blueberries though -- I'm sure there is a way to avoid that, but I don't mind blue pancakes =)

The only change I made was the milk since I don't buy soy milk I used regular milk. I was a little leery of using olive oil but I gave it a try. Glad I did. Not that I could really tell it had olive oil in it and no one in my family commented about it so it must combine well with the other ingredients. My family loved these and I will make these often!!

I'm always trying to find a healthy pancake recipe and this is one of my favorites since I love blueberries.  I made a few changes. I doubled the amount of blueberries, I used almond milk because that is my preference and I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking since that is even healthier.  I mixed the milk and oats together and stuck it in the microwave for 1 minute and it turned out great.

I think this would have been a good recipe if I didn't divide the portion size into 2 servings. The result was that the pancake batter was to runny. I might try this recipe again in the future but with the original recipe serving size.

Not sure what I did differently besides using 2% milk instead of soy, but theses did not hold together for me at all, the outside was done long before they were cooked inside. Finally resorted to putting a lid over them to get the insides cooked before the outside burned. Good flavor tho, and my husband and son thought  they were great, albeit ugly...

halved the recipe, still used 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 cup blueberries, added 2 tsp of vanilla and added cinnamon. replaced the evoo with apple sauce, and used all wheat flour (no ap flour). I think i still need to tinker with the recipe to change it to my liking. Needs more brown sugar or cinnamon i think or I may add banana.  Also I did add a tad bit more flour as per other reviews, but I think I'll stick to the recipe next time or add more baking powder to make it fluffier next time.

Ok so a few notes... These seem VERY runny when you pour the batter, but they fluff up perfectly!  There is a slight olive oil taste, nice time I may use vegetable oil or try the applesauce.  I did add a tsp of vanilla and a tbsp of cinnamon, I always do with pancakes.  They are so yummy, even with the EVOO.

These were OK - my son and husband didn't like them too much.  I tweaked ever so slightly based on others' comments: halved the recipe, added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon, used rolled oats and put them in a manual food processor to chop up a bit, used only whole wheat flour, and used a mixture of milk & vinegar for a buttermilk/fluffier pancake affect.  The pancakes were tasty enough but the texture of the oatmeal is what they couldn't get past.  Even chopping the rolled oats and letting it sit in the milk/oil mixture didn't do enough to hide the oat texture.  I finished making the batch and will eat them myself.  We'll try another whole wheat pancake recipe in the future.

These were very good, though I did make a few modifications.  I replaced the white flour with whole wheat (I use whole wheat flour for everything, even cookies), doubled the blueberries and brown sugar, and used 2% milk instead of soy(because it's what I had on hand).  They do make a BUNCH, so unless you've got a houseful of big appetites or plan to freeze them individually so they can be microwaved later (this is what I did and it worked well), I'd also recommend halving the recipe.

Delicious!!  With other recipies I've tried the pancakes taste kind of doughy.  I love the hint of oatmeal taste in this pancake w/o it overpowering the blueberry flavor.  I did alter recipe slightly.  I used applesauce instead of oil, added vanilla bean paste and cinnamon, used 2 eggs instead of three and used 1 1/4 cup 1% milk and 3/4 cup half-n-half.  Will definitely use from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  One of my favorite pancakes yet!

I made a few changes though:

1) 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 cup of white flour

2) add 1/2 of unsweetened shredded coconut

3) try with dark chocolate (70%) chocolate chips as a change from blueberries.  Equally delicious.


Also, if you let the batter sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour after mixing the pancakes will have a much smoother texture.

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly other than I used old fashioned oats (because that is what I had), I added a tsp. vanilla, a 1/2 tsp. of lemon peel and an extra Tbsp. of brown sugar.  I also let the batter thicken for about 10 minutes, as it looked a little runny in the beginning.  My family likes oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, so I may try this recipe with mini chocolate chips next time.  Definately a keeper!

WOW! These are so good!  Very light and fluffy - I have never had pancakes so light outside a restaurant. I was nervous when I poured them as they were very flat but as they cooked after flipping I could see them fluff right up. The oatmeal is not even noticeable.  I did use regular milk and it was fine.

I also followed other reviewers suggestions to add vanilla and cinnamon.  And I used extra brown sugar (I halved the recipe in general but used the original amount of sugar.) However I do not use syrup so I want the extra sweetness and flavor.  I imagine the recipe as posted would be just fine if one uses syrup.  (Though even with syrup these changes would probably only enhance the already great recipe!)   

Thanks - this is definitely a keeper!! :)

Wow!  This is the best "healthy" pancake recipe I've ever found.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and added cinnamon and vanilla.  I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar but instead of reducing the amount like I normally would bc Splenda is more concentrated, I still used 2 Tablespoons.  Fabulous recipe!!!

These are some of the best pancakes I have made! And I have made a LOT!! I made a couple of changes, however. First, I used only whole wheat flour. Second, I added a whole cup of blueberries. One half cup just didn't seem like enough for such a large amount of batter. My 6 year old daughter said I am the best pancake maker ever! So I think she's a fan of them, too. :) I bet they would be good if you added some chopped pecans...I didn't think of that before I made them. I live in Louisiana and have access to local pecans. So I always have a stock in my freezer. I will try that next time!

I did double the brown sugar and add vanilla, but these pancakes are surprisingly fluffy considering the oatmeal.  My two year olds and my husband love them!

Found this when looking for an easy and quick morning fix... and it was perfect!  Like other reviewers, I replaced oil with applesauce and used more egg whites than eggs.  I also did not have blueberries so used a whole chopped up banana and then threw in a splurge of 1/3 C choc chips...heheh.  Wonderful morning meal and we will definitely make these again.

Wow. These were so good. I used almond milk and all WW flour. I added a dash of vanilla, cinammon and nutmeg for extra flavor. I didnt add oil or use anything in its place, they didnt need it.  On one batch I also added chocolate chips and walnuts. I prefer the pancakes without the extras. Served with scrambles eggs.....I'm so full!

These were wonderful.  The only change I made was to substitute canola oil for olive oil, and I only used half of it.  I also used about 2x the number of blueberries because I LOVE blueberries!  They were divine!

Very easy.  I cut it in half for my small family (2 eggs, which ended up making the batter a bit too thin so I had to keep adding flour to re-thicken).  I also added vanilla extract & cinnamon.  But everyone loved it and it "felt" so healthy!

Wonderful recipe! I subbed canola oil for the olive, chocolate chips for the blueberries, and added a teaspoonful of vanilla for extra flavor. Makes over four cups of batter! Plenty for a feast and enough to freeze for later. (They freeze and reheat well in a toaster oven -- quick and easy breakfast!) Thanks for the recipe!

Great tasting!  I used the suggestion of adding 1tsp vanilla and one of cinnamon.  I also used half of the canola oil and the other half apple sauce.  Instead of soy, I used Almond milk.  The kids loved them too!

I must admit, when I got finished putting this together I almost threw it away.  It looked like it was WAY too runny to make anything resembling a pancake.  But I was glad I didn't, they turned out great!  So if it seems too runny, just go with it and give them a lot of space to spread out, they are worth it!

We love this.  I use whole wheat flour and way more blueberries.  Pair with homemade syrup (1 c. each of water, brown and white sugar, and about 1t vanilla or maple extract- bring to boil for less than 1 min, then shut off. Serve warm or cool) and this is a favorite breakfast.  They are much more filling than regular pancakes.

Very nice pancakes and healthier than most.  I added some cinnamon to the flour mixture for added taste.  My recommendation is to add the blueberries by hand after you have formed the pancakes on the griddle - that way the blueberries are evenly distributed.  I also used a lot more than 1/2 cup of blueberries, but my berries were pretty big.

I am gonna give you 3 stars because the turnout of batter and pancakes seems to be too thick and will not cook through evenly.  I halved the ingredients to make less of an amount, not sure if that is the reason but still cooking.  Outside is browning but the inside still looks raw.  Maybe i should add more liquid.  Took the remainder of the batter and added 3 spoonfuls of organic plain yogurt.  ...  Ok finished the second try with the yogurt added and presto!!  An excellent texture and build more pancake-like.  I will advise a little change in the already stunning recipe.  With the recipe how it is adding 1/2 C of plain organic yogurt and like (you can play with this a bit to get the consistency you like) 1 C Milk.  just my thoughts...

GREAT! It made A LOT, but I froze them (great alternative to store bought frozen pancakes). Very hearty and filling, though not quite the same texture as a "regular" pancake, it was still delicious. Made mine without blueberries since I didn't have any, and still great. Will be trying with blueberries and almond milk instead of soy to save on calories. YUM!

This recipe is amazing! My family said they never want "normal" pancakes again.   I used the suggestions of other reviewers.  -all whole wheat flour - no all-purpose. -added cinnamon and vanilla  -used applesauce instead of olive oil -used buttermilk instead of soy but I think soy would taste great too.   I've been making extra batches in my free time and freezing them so the kids have an easy and healthy breakfast before school :) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I've been an allrecipes.com fan for a few years and this is the first review I've done.  This recipe is amazing - healthy and delicious!  I've made these pancakes a dozen ways and they're great every time. You can "healthify" it even more by using all whole wheat flour, adding a couple tablespoons of flaxseed meal and/or wheat germ, and a smashed banana or applesauce to the batter.  My two boys, 4 and 1 eat these almost every morning - I feel great knowing their day is starting off healthy!  And they're so filling that I'm not hungry again until lunchtime.  Good stuff!

Wow, these healthy pancakes are absolutely devine!  The only thing I did differently was use vanilla soy (it's what I have on hand) and these pancakes turned out beautifully!  I even made extras, froze them, and then toasted them up the next day - still great!

These were pretty good.  A nice quick, healthy option for breakfast.  Although I almost always love anything with oatmeal, I didn't think it was too great in this recipe.  I'd prefer a very similar recipe with all whole wheat flour, a little or no oatmeal, and more blueberries (which of course, can always be added).

So good! Great texture and appearance.  I used 2% milk and I also added vanilla to the batter.  I really enjoyed these, especially knowing they are healthier than the all-white flour versions.

I thought these were excellent.  I halved the recipe, added 1/8 cup of flax meal, and added 1/2 t of almond extract (thought I was grabbing the vanilla, great mistake), and kept the 2T of brown sugar.  These were excellent...great flavor and so glad I added the almond extract.

Wonderful, moist, pancakes.  Will probably try to make a few plain before putting in the blueberries next time for my picky eater.  Also, after reading some of the reviews, I used grapeseed oil in place of the olive oil for a milder flavor.  I also used 1% milk as it is what I always have on hand.

I really loved this recipe. I used white whole wheat flour, so maybe that bit of extra fiber made the batter perfect. I let the oatmeal soak in the milk for just a minute too.   These were nice and fluffy, everybody loved them. Made without the blueberries and still tasted great, might have added cinnamon and vanilla and used whole milk. Yummy!

OH SO GOOD! I used 1 cup evaporated goats milk and 1 cup water (that's all I had) and these were fantastic. Will not go back to any other mix/recipe!

Not bad. My tweaks - whole milk instead of soy, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil & part of the milk, 3T brown sugar, and more blueberries. Will definitely make these again, but instead of blueberries I'll use chopped apples & cinnamon ;o). My 4 kids, ages 2.5, 4, 6.5, 8 - mixed reviews. 2 loved them & had seconds, 2 thought 1 was enough & wanted something else. Even my picky hubby liked them and ate 6! (they came out pretty thin). Everyone agreed on trying them again with apples!

Very, Very good.  MY twio year old and I are devouring them as I type!  I halved the dry and then added 1 egg plus 1 white, 1 cup 25 evap, 1/4 cup applesauce, cinnamon and vanilla to the half I was cooking.  Yum!

I agree with the 2/08 review in that this recipe does make a lot of pancakes (about 8 or so large pancakes for me) but I put them in the fridge and warmed them up later.  Also because of oats they were quite fulfilling but very light and fluffy.  I as well put in cinnamon, a little bit more brown sugar and added apples to some of the pancakes to add additional flavor.  It also doesn't bubble so I turn them ever 30-45 seconds.  Enjoy!

Very easy. Pancakes are tender and delicious (don't overmix the batter).  I used instant oatmeal and milk and cut back the oil to about a tablespoon and they came out great.  You can easily cut the recipe in half to serve four people.

I always keep my freezer stocked with blueberries, since I make this often for my family.  I have tried it with soy and regular milk, and although both taste great, I prefer using regular milk since the pancakes made with soy milk take a long time to get a nice brown color.  Rinse and drain your frozen blueberries to prevent discoloration of pancakes.

Great base recipe.  I added a tbl of vanilla and some flaxseed, because I add flaxseed to everything.  I used cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil and one egg plus one white.  The texture was great, the entire family likes them!  Doubled the recipe to freeze.

These were pretty good.  I left out salt, used skim milk with some vinegar, all wheat flour, added some cinnamon and vanilla, and doubled up on fresh blueberries.  They were a bit tricky to cook, as when I flipped them when the first side was perfect brown, blueberries and mix went flying.

Very good. I changed a couple of things - sorry, I hate rating a recipe that I have changed, but it was still really good - skim milk instead of soy, applesauce instead of oil, no blueberries, and a splash of vanilla.  It was great and very filling. My very picky 11 yo stepson ate them with no complaint (very rare for him!). We had them for dinner, and it made enough for 2 meals easily, and we are hearty eaters. This is my new go-to pancake recipe! Thank you!

Used extra brown sugar and vegetable oil instead of olive oil, and low fat milk instead of soy.  Delicious and hearty!  I will definitely make again.  These would be delicious even without blueberries.

These came out pretty good!  You really couldn't tell there was oatmeal in them once cooked.  I added a tsp of vanilla extract and a few sprinkles of cinnamon.  Used regular 1% milk rather than soymilk.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very good, however, I made a few changes to give it a little more flavor.  First of all, I ground up my oatmeal and I replaced the oil with applesauce.  I think next time I will use 1 cup of whole wheat flour to make it healthier.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  My husband really enjoyed these pancakes.  I will definitely make them again.  Thanks

This recipe was good.  I did take the advice of others and added cinnamon and vanilla, without that bit of flavoe they may have been a little boring.  Left out the blueberries because no one here eats them.  I also used this batter in the waffle iron and they can out well too!  Makes plenty, that's for sure.

I made them for dinner one night and when my wife and I exercised the next day we had noticeably more energy.  So maybe they're a good energy food also.  I used fresh blueberries and a lot more than 1/2 cup, maybe 1-1/2.  I think I'd also recommend letting the batter sit for 15-30 min to give the oats time to soak in the liquid.

Fantastic recipe!  Both delicious and healthy.  Since it was for only the two of us, I halved the recipe.  I used all whole wheat flour and 1 egg plus 1 egg white (as another reviewer suggested when halving the recipe).  I love soy milk, so I did use that.  I thought olive oil sounded strange (although healthy), so I ended up using canola.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as well and they were awesome.  Since I usually have all of the ingredients on hand, I will definitely make these again and again!  What a tastey and healthy way to start the day!

The first time I made this, I used just wheat flour. That made the pancakes too dry. This time I did what the recipe called for. However, I used the suggestion of another reviewer and used 2 tbsp of brown sugar. I didn't have any blueberries around so I just added bananas on top after the pancakes were done. Pretty good! Of course, they aren't the buttery pancakes that I love, but I'm glad to have found a healthier version of my favorite breakfast item!

Great recipe!  I did change a few things based on reading a number of reviews, however.  I added 1/2t. cinnamon and 1/2t. vanilla, used applesauce instead of oil, used regular milk instead of soy and used about 1 cup of blueberries.  I prefer also to drop blueberries onto each pancake after pouring the batter as it helps to disperse the more evenly.  Very good and I will definitely use it as my new go to blueberry pancake!

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the healthiness of the recipe.  I don't use soy milk, just used 1% and used Splenda Blend.  Didn't have blueberries, so they were served "plain."  My husband said they were okay.  Kind of bland. I'm sure the blueberries would have made a great difference. They did turn out beautiful. I noticed someone else said they didn't freeze well.  Guess I'll find out for myself because I have 8 left and put them in the freezer.

While I really liked these pancakes, my husband wasn't impressed. I think it's because they are very dense. I will make them again, but next time I'll make a fresh blueberry syrup to top them off.

I thought these were wonderful!  I made some minor changes based on the reviews (only 1/2 tsp salt, some cinnamon, used 1 1/2 T of baking powder, used all WW flour, canola instead of olive, and I used dairy milk).  I had to omit the blueberries (kiddos love blueberries but not IN their pancakes).  My kids only know healthy pancakes, so they ate them.  Very filling and satisfying to chew.  My batch made 22 largish pancakes so I have plenty in the freezer!

I wonder if those who tasted a bitter or strange aftertaste used baking soda instead of baking powder?

These pancakes were delicious.  I just made them for our Sunday breakfast and my 13 month old daughter absolutely loved them -- she kept saying "MMMMMM!" and opening her mouth for more.  Like some of the other reviewers, I too used buttermilk.  I added about 2 t. each of cinnamon & vanilla extract for some extra flavor.  These were excellent & I will definitely make them again.  Happy Sunday!

The batter seemed a little runny so I cooked these pancakes at 300 F on a lightly oiled griddle. I think it is a perfect temperature for these pancakes--they cooked slowly and browned nicely, and they were not dense at all. I didn't have soy milk so I used 1%, used applesauce instead of oil, and all whole wheat flour. I considered grinding the oatmeal, but it was fine the way it was. All I had on hand was frozen blueberries, but I'm sure these would be even better with fresh. These taste great with sugar-free syrup and sliced bananas.

Very good! I've tried countless variations on my own and have sampled a number from this site, but this really is excellent.
I've made some alterations to make them healthier:
1) Dropped the all-purpose flour and substituted 1/2 cup of buckwheat flour.
2) Dropped both the brown sugar and the olive oil and added two heaping (!) tablespoons of organic applesauce. 

I made half with bananas and half with blueberries. Both were really good.

This is a real nice recipe. I only switched to 2% milk and applesauce for the oil. Cooking slowly works very well.

Very good recipe.  I have been looking for a good whole wheat version of pancakes. All  the others I have tried always come out to dense.  These were wonderful.

like others i substituted 2% for soy, and butter for olive oil. i halved the recipe for my boyfriend and i. i added chopped pecans and chocolate chips to mine. I didn;t have a problem cooking them, instead of 5 (med) i cooked mine on 4 on my burner settings. both of us had an issue with the "tang" it left in our mouths, not sure what caused this. Also, this calls for an unusually large amount of baking powder. i enjoyed mine, but the chocolate cut back on the tang coupled with the maple syrup.

Suprisingly good pancakes! They were light and fluffy (but you have to cook them over a lower heat otherwise they burn easily). I subbed applesauce for oil and added extra berries. Made twice so far and will make again!

Fabulous! Made the recipe as is and had it with pure canadian maple syrup.  We were all liking our plates! The oatmeal gives a nice texture, what if we soaked it for a few more minutes in the milk?  Will try to see. Also can't wait to try the different variations proposed by the members: milk, buttermilk, evaporated milk,... and all the different fruit combinations possible (raspeberries, banana, strawberries) and whatever else I can conconct.  Thanks for a great healthy pancake recipe that lends itself to many variations on the theme.

These were good.  I used all wheat flour and I think next time I'll combine wheat and white as written instead.  I used melted butter instead of oil.  I also put 1/2 a cup of blueberries in the batter and then topped the pancakes with more blueberries in the skillet.  1/2 a cup is really hardly any at all so they needed the extra.

Excellent.  I did use 1% milk instead of soy milk and I placed blueberries on each pancake instead of mixing them in.  I made 17 delicious pancakes with this recipe.  We ate to our fill and I have individually frozen the rest for future breakfasts.

Tasted great...I modified it quite a bit: 2c bisquick, 1/2c canned blueberries, 2Tbl flax seed, 6Tbl old fashion oats, 2Tbl applesauce, 1/2c chopped walnuts...turned out great...make sure you use 3 eggs, or the pancakes will stick to the skillet, and will not form a pancake...great idea/recipe!

I am giving these 5 stars even though my husband didn't like them.  He's just not into healthy eating.  I thought they were delicious and so did my picky kids.  I substituted low-fat buttermilk for the soy and I used applesauce instead of oil.  I also added cinnamon.  Next time I will probably add diced granny smith apples as I think they will add an even better flavor!

These are the BEST whole wheat pancakes I've ever made.  I only used whole wheat flour, fat free half & half because I don't have (and don't really care for) soy milk, 1 tbsp olive oil with 1/4 cup apple sauce, and I omitted the blueberries... oh, and I only had old fashioned oats, but the pancakes still turned out fantastic with a prefect texture.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful! I used half buckwheat/half wholewheat flour. I also used traditional oats, as opposed to the quick. I've made them with both canola oil and olive oil, but prefer the canola as the olive can be overpowering. My two-year old loves them and I feel better about feeding him a healthier version.

I substituted melted butter for the olive oil and reduced the baking powder to 1 T.  I also used huckleberries in place of the blueberries, and almond milk instead of soy.  Great recipe!  I think next time I'll use all whole wheat flour.

EXCELLENT! These pancakes were so good and my family loved them. The changes I made due to not having them at hand: 1)substituted whole milk for the soy 2)substituted canola oil for olive oil 3)added more berries and used assorted frozen berries (raspberries, blueberries, blackberries from Costco). This will be our Sunday morning standard. Thank you for sharing.

These are really excellent, healthy pancakes!

They are the lightest fluffiest pancakes I have ever had, that still actually have some nutritional value to them.

I make them with entirely whole wheat flour and have made them with and without blueberries - they are good either way.

My entire family loved these, including my 2 picky kids.  I will be making these pancakes from now on.

My 2 year old loves these pancakes and so does my husband.  I make them will all whole wheat flour, skim milk and egg whites only which makes them very healthy.  For my husband I add toatsted pecans or walnuts and sliced bananas.

I used skim milk instead of soy, and left the berries for on top.  The batter seemed thin and lumpy until almost time to flip, and I was pleasantly surprised by how fluffy they turned out, with such a fabulous flavor. These are our new Saturday morning standard.

Delicious!  I used 2% milk, as it was what i had on hand.  I did add vanilla, but no cinnamon.  I used melted margarine instead of the olive oil, as it was also all i had.  Next time I will definately use olive oil.  If you use Light tasting Olive Oil, you will not get that olive oil taste in the end result.  Oh, and I did use 1 cup of blueberries instead of half.  My 3 year old has been getting So picky..  these were easy for her to help me make and she ate every bite :)

These were awesome!  Based on other suggestions I used 1 cup of blueberries, substituted applesauce for the oil, added cinnamon and vanilla (1/4 tsp each),used lowfat buttermilk instead of soy milk and added 1/4 of pecans. So, so good!!

This really is an AWESOME recipe!  I could not believe how fast and easy these were to make- and my kids absolutely LOVED them.  I will make these on Sunday mornings from now on.  They are the best!

I thought these were really good but my 9 year old didn’t like the blueberries. She liked the rest. Definitely needed syrup.

This is my go to recipe for pancakes for guests.  The only change I make is I add one finely chopped banana to the batter.  I also interchange fresh or frozen blueberries depending on what I have on hand.  This recipe is soooo good!  I get asked for it all the time.  Give it a try!

These are spectacular pancakes.  I do suggest adding more berries than the recipe suggests, but otherwise, it is perfect.  One does want to be aware that  these pancakes will not bubble and develop holes like normal pancakes, so be careful to pay attention and flip them when the edges start to dry.

These were aweful. I mean I've definitely had worse pancakes but these are going in the trash. I did what was suggested and halved the recipe and added cinnamon and nutmeg. 

These taste like you made oatmeal, flopped some in a pan and fried it in a "patty"

I subbed oat flour (oatmeal pulverized in a blender) for wheat flour because I didn't have any in the pantry. Also, for the milk ingredient, I used half whole milk yogurt and half milk. These were delicious!

Best recipe I've found for pancakes. I 'be made them a few times. I substituted banana for the blueberries and added toasted pecans on top yummy! I've substituted coconut flour for the wheat flour which was good. I think you could substitute any fruit and it would be awesome as well.

Admittedly, I was looking for a multi-grain pancake recipe, and I decided to try this without the berries.  I substituted honey for the brown sugar and vanilla almond milk for the soy milk, and I'm happy with this.  My only issue was that the baking powder didn't integrate better into the batter, so there were a few clumps of baking powder in the finished pancakes; I'm sure all I need to do is be more thorough in mixing the next time.  If you're looking for a sweet pancake, I'd suggest adding more of the brown sugar (or whatever sweetener you use); this doesn't have much sweetness at all.  I'll be making this again!

These pancakes were just OK.  They were a little bland, and they could have used more blueberries. On a positive note, the texture was good, and they weren't overwhelmingly sweet.

Wonderfully good pancakes!  I made only a few changes for my taste.  I knew when I saw the ratio of blueberries to batter that 1/2 cup wasn't enough, so used 1 1/2 cups.  I also used coconut hemp milk and added some slivered almonds.  Topped with pure PA  Somerset County maple syrup.  Absolutely delicious!   -beware, it makes a lot of pancakes!

Everyone loved it! I did use all whole wheat, applesauce (no oil), cooked oatmeal and milk together first (about 3 mins), add extra milk,  cinnamon, and vanilla.  I doubled it so I could freeze some pancake for busy school mornings.  They froze well:)

Way too much milk. I add more flour & it was still too thin. Definitely not thick enough to hold blueberries. But the taste is great.

These are yummy, made waffles rather than pancakes so I used less BP and used blackberries instead of blueberries, only because I prefer waffles and had blackberries that had to be used up.  Love this recipe.

Used all whole wheat flour, half rice milk half reg milk, and coconut oil instead of oil. For the oil it gets hard when you put it in the milk, so heat mix up in microwave for 1 min.

Thank you thank you thank you for this recipe! I've been wanting to find a healthy alternative to our conventional recipe for our weekly Saturday morning pancake tradition. This recipe is awesome! The first time I made it I was weary, and so I added a tsp of vanilla, a liitle more salt and used butter instead of olive oil. I also used whole milk instead of soy and regular old fashioned oatmeal. They came out good, but second time I followed the recipe exactly but still used regular whole milk and old fashioned oats. Amazing! My kids loved it! I did cook these on lower heat because the density of these require them to sit awhile longer. Also have to check them since, as other reviewers noted, they don't bubble yo like regular pancakes. I love that this recipe is so healthy, easy and delicious! No blender or food processor needed and no specialty store ingredients required. My daughter (5) said she likes these better than the old pancakes!

These pancakes are fantastic! I adapted the recipe for my own twist: halved it (since I was only cooking for one!) and made the following substitutions:

- Old-fashioned rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats
- Almond milk instead of soy milk, which I curdled with a bit of white vinegar for "buttermilk"
- Melted coconut oil instead of olive oil (and used coconut oil to lightly grease the pan)
- Fresh banana slices instead of blueberries (make sure the bananas are plenty ripe)
- Added a dash of vanilla extract and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter

I also used only one extra large egg in the halved version. These could easily be made vegan by using a flax egg or some other egg substitute.

All in all, these are my new go-to pancakes! Not only are they (slightly) healthier than regular pancakes, they taste just as good, if not better :)

By the way, the halved recipe gave me about a dozen 4-in diameter pancakes. Freeze and reheat leftovers for a delicious weekday morning breakfast!

Very good oatmeal pancakes!  I used coconut oil and almond milk instead because that's what I had on hand. I made the full batch and not a single one left.  Making them smaller (3-4 inch) vs bigger worked much better.

This is a great base recipe, I have made it a few different ways.  I have used olive oil, coconut oil, and apple sauce, all good, with a different tastes for each.  I used all wheat flour instead of half white, as well as almond milk instead of soy.  I also added cinnamon as well as vanilla extract.  Even sneaked some milled flax seed in as well!  When I was out of blueberries, the recipe still tasted good without.  I also want to add that I rarely make these to eat at the time, I make a double batch on the weekend to freeze so the kids have a hot, homemade breakfast through out the school week.

Love this! Thanks so much for the recipe! I never would have thought the oats would work in pancakes...and this is such a healthy recipe! I doubled the blueberries, used all whole wheat flour, and added a bit of vanilla - just personal pref changes. I wouldn't think you need to double the sugar as other reviewers suggested - this was perfect! My 15 year-old health nut vegetarian daughter gave these her seal of approval! thanks-

Not bad pancakes.  A trifle runny but pretty tasty.  I used about a cup of family farm grown blueberries, which apparently are more tart than what are sold in the stores, so hub asked me if I'd made raspberry pancakes.  No, I hadn't, but raspberries would be good in this.  Added cinnamon and vanilla and it made a lot of leftover pancakes that I guess we'll have for breakfast tomorrow.  Pretty easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

The consistency is great - they are fluffy and thick. Couple that with the healthy nature of the ingredients and I think it deserves 4.5 stars. I thought the flavor was just a bit bland - it could definitely use some vanilla and cinnamon as one reviewer suggests and perhaps more brown sugar or a sweeter fruit such as bananas. Or just slap some syrup on those suckers. At first I thought there was more than 8 servings in this recipe. I got about 16 large (the size of my hand) pancakes out of this so I think 8 servings is correct. One very helpful hint from another reviewer that I tried - cover your blueberries in a little flour. It keeps the blueberries whole as you cook the pancakes (we used fresh blueberries, not frozen). We will definitely make these again. PS I used 2%  milk instead of soy milk.

These are great! I make 1/2 a recipe for the 2 of us: I use regular milk for the soy, 2 eggs, and double the berries (huckleberries).

I really liked these. I replaced the soy milk with 1% milk I replaced the blueberries for fresh strawberries as that is what I had on hand.

I used fresh blackberries because I had no blueberries and it was very good. I gave it a 4 because it was wrong on the amount it makes. I followed the recipe and it made more like 15....so we had lots of leftovers. I also thought it was a little bitter, so 2 tbsp baking powder was probably too much...and a little extra sugar would help.

Made these for the first time this morning. Used applesauce instead of oil. As some other reviewers mentioned, I let the batter 'stand' for a few minutes to let it poof. The result was great pancakes that the kids loved! My kids aren't big on 'health food,' so the fact that they loved these was a big plus!

This is a hearty pancake yet it's not too heavy.  It tastes wonderful.  I did make suggested changes; i.e. buttermilk for the soy, applesauce for the oil, and all the flour I used was whole wheat.  It's real easy to make these.  Just turn the cakes when the edges are dry.

The kids loved these.  We used 2% milk instead of soy, and canola instead of olive oils, since some people said they tasted olive-oil-y.  Also used a cup of blueberries instead of the 1/2 cup (had them frozen from blueberry picking last summer... yay!).

Awesome recipe! My son is a pancake snob and he gulped these down ( he's three) .. I actually put the dry ingredients in mason jars so I'm ready to make them on the fly!  So great to have a healthy recipe that tastes so good! I would recommend letting the better sit until it has a chance to fluff on its own. Its best when it reaches the point of nice and airy!

These were really tasty - fluffy on the inside and a little bit crispy on the outside. I usually put butter on my pancakes and these were so moist that I didn't need to at all. I did double the amount of blueberries, and I think they might have been a little bland if I hadn't done that. My husband wants me to make them as waffles next time, and I think they will be great that way too.

Very good and good for you! I used only the whole wheat flour and added a bit of vanilla as well. I didn't have any blueberries but I put strawberries on top of the pancakes and served with maple syrup! Yummy!

I hadn't had much experience with pancakes from scratch before this. I love the use of whole grains in these pancakes. The taste and texture are great (though I do increase the liquid due to personal tastes). These work great using all whole wheat flour instead of part all purpose flour as well. Thank you for a new favorite.

yummo yummo yummo!  i've never been a lover of pancakes....but, now that i have two young boys, i thought they'd probably enjoy these.  so, i did a test run tonight.  and, man...are these ever good!  the only thing i didn't have on hand was soy milk.  so, i substituted skim...and, they turned out delicious!

This pancakes are really good.  I didn't care for the olive oil flavor and will leave that out next time.  It just doesn't go well in a sweet pancake.  I used all whole wheat flour and added vanilla and cinnamon.  Yum.  I'll definitely make them again.  Beware... this recipe makes a LOT of pancakes.  I think I came out with 21.

We loved these pancakes! I mostly followed the recipe (used canola oil - I don't like olive oil taste in baked items - non-instant oats, and honey instead of brown sugar). I added pecans to half, and they were really great with the blueberries. Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I had read the negative reviews before I made these pancakes. These need to be cooked on very low heat in order to turn out. Since I didn't know that prior to making them, I cooked them on medium, and my pancakes turned into a half overcooked, half undercooked mess. They were impossible to flip without destroying. I've made pancakes many times before and have never had such a problem, so I'm wondering if it's the frozen blueberries that affected the cook time/process. If I ever made these again, I would lower the heat to between low and medium and add the blueberries to the top of the pancake once the batter was already in the pan and partially cooked. The only change I made to this receipe was to use apple sauce instead of olive oil. As a side note, the blueberries pretty much made my batter blue, not the lovely tan shade from so many people's photos. I think adding the blueberries to the top of the partially-cooked batter would also be more visually appealing...

These pancakes were very good and so healthy.  I only gave it 4 stars because they are a little bland but they are great since I am on a restricted diet right now and can not have very much sugar.  I also had to omit the blueberries for now so that may have added some more flavor.  My whole family loved them too (and they are picky eaters).  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to add some fruit to these!

These are delicious! I just made my first batch and they are much better than I thought they would be. The only change I made was to add vanilla. I'm a huge pancake fan but am working using only whole grain foods for my family. I tried another whole wheat blueberry recipe and it was VERY bland. These are good without any butter and/or syrup. MMMm!

Excellent-thank you for sharing. My husband and two teenage sons ate the whole thing! I substitued buttermilk for the soy milk and applesauce for the oil. I also made a homemade blueberry sauce instead of fake maple syrup. This is one pancake recipe I feel good about feeding my family.

Excellent!  I loved these.  I did half applesauce and half olive oil and another readers suggestion.  I didn't have soy milk so whole milk instead.  I did add the vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I was a little worried about the runniness of the recipe, but they cooked up perfect.  I didnt' have just blueberries so I used frozen mixed berries and I am in love with these pancakes!!

Got to say I love it! My 4 year old loves pancakes, but I am leery of making them any more than just once in a while. I added our huckleberries that we picked last summer and instead of syrup, I used homemade huckleberry jam. Very nutritious and a big hit with dad...the hardest to convince that health food can be tasty!!

Very delicious. I cut the recipe into 2 servings and it made exactly four nice-sized pancakes. I used regular whole milk and a bit less olive oil, and they still turned out great. I'll definitely make this again with bananas or something instead. :)

As far as a healthy cake goes...is pretty good.  Wouldn't take them over a buttermilk hotcake by any means...but good.  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and all whole wheat flour, skipping the all purpose, and added 1tsp. of vanilla extract and extra blueberries.

Great recipe! I will be making this about every week. :)  I didn't change a thing, but put in a full pint of fresh blueberries in the batter.

The best blueberry pancakes ever. The only changes that I made was to add cinnamon to the batter and I couldn't get soy milk so I used butter milk. These would even be great without blueberries.

I made these with my son for both of us and my husband.  My husband just LOVED these! Myself I would have liked them a little fluffier but I have heard that cooking with whole wheat flour can make things a little more dense and less fluffy, plus I had to alter the recipe for what I had on hand which could have contributed to it as well.  I didn't have soy or buttermilk as the recipie and some of the comments have suggested so I used 1% cows milk which is all that I had on hand.  Also out of olive oil so I had to sub whatever veggie oil I had on hand.  I also added vanilla and cinnamon to mine, as I have a cinnamon fetish that is only cured by cooking anything possible with it! :) The batter was thin so I added a bit more whole wheat flour until it was a thicker texture that cooked much better then the watery mixture the recipe created.    I'm really not sure how soo many people got so many pancakes out of the mix, unless they left the mix thin which would have made many more, but then they would have been thinner and more crepe like.  They would have looked nothing like the picture above. My mix with my changes only made about 12 medium pancankes (about the size in the picture above) which this time around made enough with a little left over, but if my daughter was home would have been a perfect amount.  I will definately use this recipe again in the future!!!

Wow. These are excellent. I made half the recipe and got 15 small/medium pancakes. I only had regular oatmeal so I ground it (3/4 C of oats) into flour in the food processor. I replaced the oil with applesauce and for the liquid, I used 1/2 C kefir and 1/2 C low fat milk. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I made half the batch with fresh blueberries and half with mini chocolate chips. Next time, I'll make the whole recipe and freeze the leftovers.

These were fantastic!  I thought olive oil sounded a little weird for pancakes, so I used vegetable oil; I also used skim milk instead of soy milk (not a soy fan).  Fresh blueberries instead of frozen were a wonderful touch.  Thanks for sharing!

I added some vanilla and cinnamon for flavor, but it was still a little bland. I substituted applesauce for the olive oil. I guess I didn't wait long enough before I flipped the first ones and they fell apart.  Once I waited a little longer for them to cook, they came out perfectly.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  The pancakes were difficult to turn and broke easily, making a mess several times.  Mine rose quite high but once they were browned on both sides, I discovered that they weren't really cooked in the middle, so subsequent pancakes I cooked I had to press them down hard to make sure that didn't happen again.  Even then, they had a gummy texture inside.  The flavor was very bland even though I added cinnamon and vanilla, used buttermilk, doubled the blueberries and used half organic butter instead of all olive oil.  I won't be making this again, and will be sharing my plethora of leftovers with the dogs!

Not bad! Used all whole wheat, didn't have milk. Put some chocolate chips in it, along with mixed berries. Very filling! I would probably cut down the oats next time and add more flour. The texture was too much like oatmeal.

My family LOVES these.  It's a keeper.  I only use whole wheat flour and 2% milk since that was what we have in the fridge.  And we have never used the blueberries.  We just eat them plain w/ maple syrup. These are also great as a post workout snack (cold out of the fridge drizzled w/ a little honey).  We make them a few times a week and we're never dissapointed.

Beautifully grainy, delicious, perfection.  My 3 year old said yummy after every single bite! lol.   I used all whole wheat flour and I didn't have quick cooking oatmeal, only regular.  I soaked them in the milk (regular, not soymilk) for appro. 10 mins to soften.   Used some very sweet strawberries that we had on-hand, instead of blueberries.   Have enough batter for pancakes tomorrow morning (and maybe the day after).    Very nice.  Thank you.

These were great!  I made them for my vegan husband and used egg substitute.  This is probably why they were a little bit crumbly.  Great!!

Excellent, but when I recalculated for 4 servings,  the amount of blueberries stayed the same and it was way too many.  Probably could cut back to about a 1/4 cup and be plenty. Excellent recipe and I used buttermilk. Hubby loved it and kids raved!

These are great! I did make two changes: 1. I used egg beaters and 2. I used canola oil instead of olive.  They were so good.  A great healthy alternative for a sweet breakfast treat. I have enough batter left for tomorrow's breakfast too.

I just made these pancakes on Easter morning. I doubled the recipe and made 1 batch with blueberries and another batch with mashed bananas because that's the kids favorite fruit in their pancakes. I omitted the sugar because of the fruits and since I was out of soy milk, I used skin milk.

I have been looking for ways to make healthier food.  I tried this recipe and was very impressed.  It was tasty and satisfying.  I only used the whole wheat flour and I flavored with cinnamon.  I also used a lot more blueberries.  Although my husband initially questioned oats in his pancakes, he loved the results.

Did some substitutions like others: chocolate chips for blueberries, old-fashioned oats for fast cooking ones and added a little vanilla and cinnamon. Came out great and very tasty.

These pancakes are amazing!  I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers and used apple sauce in place of the oil.  I used all whole wheat flour, and rice milk in place of the soy milk because that's what I had on hand.  I left out the blueberries and I let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to thicken a little as one other reviewer recommended. These pancakes tasted great and are much healthier than your typical pancake!

Tasty and somewhat healthy. I used buttermilk instead of soy and applesauce instead of olive oil and I cooked in veg. oil.  The batter was really thick and I ended up adding about 2x as much buttermilk as called-for soymilk. They were still too thick to cook all the way through.  Next time I will add even more buttermilk or maybe just skip the oil/applesauce completely.

My husband and I give this recipe five stars even though we made very minor adjustments.  We didn't have palin blueberries, so we added frozen mixed berries.  Extra cinnamon because we like cinnamon alot!!!! We also used skim milk in place of soy milk because we didn't have any soy milk on hand. throw in a few tsp of ground flax seed, and you've got a healthy breakfast.  Also, we used sugar free syrup because of our diet.

FANTABULOUS!!!! We had these for breakfast yesterday. I thought with the oatmeal and the wheat they maybe a bit heavy, but they weren't, they were light and fluffy and simply delicious. we served with sugar free syrup and the kids went wild over them. I also ground my oatmeal very fine before adding it to the batter. Five stars from our family!!! Delicioso.

It's hard to find a recipe that is both delicious and healthy - here it is!  I used buttermilk instead of soy milk and next time will increase the blueberries to 3/4 C. or 1 C.  Perfect amount of sweetness.  Very good recipe.

WOW! These are one of the best healthy pancake recipes I've ever made. VERY versitle (we used freeze dried strawberries instead of blueberries and almond milk instead of soy because that's what we had on hand) and I also used only whole wheat pastry flour. They were fluffy and delicious. We made them dollar size using a tablespoon as a ladel and froze a bunch to heat up for our toddlers breakfast. Cant wait to play with other fruit options again. Thanks for this great recipe!

this was a GREAT recipe. i liked having a pancake recipe available to me that was tasty yet very healthy, too. i made a few of my own adjustments: i used canola oil instead of olive; i used 1 egg and 3 egg whites; i added ground flaxseed meal; and i added a few tbsp of pecan chips (smaller than chopped variety in the bag). to keep from increasing calories, i opted to use raspberry jam on top of the pancakes instead of maple syrup. nicely done! this is a keeper and a new favorite recipe for my husband and me.

Delicious! The texture was divine. I cut the recipe in half, and I used just one egg (since 1.5 eggs is hard to do!) and they still came out awesome.  I'm a beginner and not usually good at making pancakes but these came out perfect!

This is my new favorite pancake recipe.  I substituted 2 c milk and 2 t vinegar for the soy milk and added 1/2 cup milled flax.  I served these with "The Absolute Best Pancake Syrup" on this site.  Update:  These were great fresh but didn't freeze well.

I used only whole wheat flour and these turned out so nutty and so delicious!  I omitted the blueberries because I had none and added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  I also left out the oil from the batter and used that amount to cook the pancakes instead, because the batter absorbs the oil while cooking anyway, and this way, my caloric intake is the right amount.  Had this with slices of banana and apple sauce.  Yum!

These are the best whole wheat pancakes I have ever had.  I doubled the blueberries and added 1 cup of wheat bran to give us a little more fiber and they turned out fantastic.  They taste great with some all natural no sugar added applesauce on top or maple syrup.  My 2 1/2 year old ate them up too.  This recipe will definitely replace the prior ones I use to use.

I love these pancakes because they are delicious and healthy.  I substitute a small amount of the oil with ground flaxseed and add extra blueberries, and I used 1/2% milk in place of the soy milk.  Thanks for posting this, we will definitely continue to make these.

Great! I used applesauce instead of olive oil, egg beaters instead of eggs and non-fat soy milk.  Let the oats sit in liquid for a couple of minutes - batter is thick, pancakes very fluffy.  Will probably add vanilla next time for more flavor.

Delicious, even with a few additions! I always throw a handful of flax meal in, 2 eggs (as flax can substitute an egg), little bit of applesauce and sometimes vanilla. I even use quinoa flour sometimes which gives it an earthier taste. My kids aged 7, 5 and 3 love them as well. We've been using this recipe 99% of the time for four years. Thanks for the recipe!

Love the healthiness of these- however, they are too runny and don't have an "awesome" flavor. I think they are great for family but not the best to serve for company.

These were healthy and hearty. I made them with all whole wheat flour, splenda brown sugar, egg beaters, and applesauce in place of the oil. I also omitted the blueberries and added cinnaman and vanilla. We very much enjoyed these.

Delicious and easy! I did use vegetable oil instead of the olive oil, and let the batter sit for about 15 minutes before cooking. They turned out great and even my fussy husband couldn't get enough. Kept the unused batter until the following day and had more - still great!

great pancakes.  i used rice milk instead of soy (preference), and kept the rest the same.  whole family loved it.  if using rice milk instead of soy, i would add a touch more salt to compensate, but my husband loved it the way it was, no extra salt added.  i will definately be making these on a regular basis.  so nice to have a dairy-free recipe that is simple and yet so tasty.

Yummy. I made a few minor adjustments;
I used only wheat flour, and half regular milk/half evaporated milk, and only 2 pinches of salt. Even picky husband liked them!   Thanks for the recipe.

These were delicious!  I substituted apple sauce for 3/4 of the olive oil and used fat free half and half instead of soy milk (my fridge is pretty empty as it has been a week since my last trip to the grocery store).  I have no talent for flipping pancakes, so I used a 1/8 measuring cup for nice, small pancakes.  They are just so moist and fluffy!

My new favorite pancake! I used buttermilk and applesauce instead of soymilk and oil. I found that the end of the batch turned out better than the first few pancakes, so next time I will let the batter sit a couple of minutes. We ate them with blueberry or maple syrup.  Suprisingly, they tasted best with maple syrup!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe to freeze some. I used whole wheat, w.w. pastry, and a bit of spelt flour. Also added a little whey protein powder and a LITTLE powdered goat's milk  for extra protein. Also added ground walnuts and a dash of cinnamon. I cut out 1/4th of the sugar (I used Suconat) and they were fantastic! Thank you!

These were SO good!!!
I used 2% evaporated milk since I didn't have soy, and they came out great! The mix looked too runny to me at first, but they actually cooked up really nicely. 
I will definitely be making this again - many, many times again! Thanks for a tasty AND healthy recipe!!  :-)

YUMMY. I used all whole wheat pastry flour (no white), and replaced half the oil for applesauce and the other half canola.  Blueberries are a great addition. If using old fashioned oats, steam milk and soak oats for 5-10 minutes so they soften.

I will probably make these again- only because they are the only wheat pancake recipe without buttermilk.  I loved the idea of these more than the actual result-  they were a little bit bitter tasting.  I subbed with canola oil and regular milk.  Decent, probably a 3 1/2.  Suprisingly light for such hearty ingred.  Worth a try!

These are very good.  I only made a couple of changes: regular milk, canola oil, dash of cinnamon, and extra  blueberries.  Next time I'll drop on the blueberries and will undoubtedly use more than 1 c, there were just not enough blueberries.

Made the recipe as is and was not very impressed.  The pancakes tasted ok, but definitely not great. I will probably not make these again.

These were pretty tasty, but I had to tweak the recipe a bit - the batter was extremely thin and the first few pancakes were flat.  However, I added a bit more flour, and that helped.  They are a very dense pancake rather than light and fluffy like buttermilk, but I prefer them dense, so this recipe gets 5 stars :)

I used canola oil in place of the olive oil and put the blueberries on the pancakes after I poured the batter. I think this recipe taste ok, but because it is healthier than my buttermilk pancake recipe, I will make it again. Next time I will add a little cinnamon and some banana slices.

I loved these pancakes! I was afraid the oatmeal and wheat flour would make them too heavy, but they were great. I used raspberries because my family doesn't like blueberries and it turned out delicious.

This recipe tastes great with some blackberry syrup.  It has oatmeal, blueberries and soy milk in it which make it a very healthy choice to start off the morning. Very filling as well.

My kids and I loved this recipe. With the whole wheat flour,old fashioned oats and eggs,I love the fact that it has more protein than traditional pancakes. I doubled the recipe like I always do w/pancakes and I had LOTS of batter left over. A little scoop of batter makes a BIG pancake! This is our new favorite pancake recipe!

The wheat flour flavor gave the after taste of this pancake bitter.  I was impressed and will not make them again.  I followed the recipe excatly.

I thought this recipe sounded like a healthier alternative to regular pancake recipes and thought it was very good.  I did make some changes that were suggested in other reviews.  I used the low fat buttermilk, added some cinnamon and vanilla, only used 1/2 the amount of oil and changed to vegetable oil.  I used fresh bluberries and made some blueberry syrup for them also.

I added a bit more flour to thicken the batter and used it to make waffles.  The batter was very simple, and the waffles were pretty good.  I like the idea of oatmeal.  The texture was different than normal waffles, they didn't get crispy and were really thick!  Almost more like bread than waffles.  Oh and I recommend putting in more sugar, maybe some vanilla extract or cinnamon, too!  I don't know if I'll make these again because I like my other recipe better and it's fat free.

overall, not too bad.  I personally do not like the lumpy/oatmeal texture.
