This recipe is delicious, but a little warning: It is extremely GREASY. I recommend cutting down on the butter by about half. Also, I have made it both with and without the cornflakes on top, and my family likes it better without. Leaving out the flakes will eliminate even more of the unwanted butter. Another thing I like to do with this recipe is to grease the casserole dish, put the tater tots on the bottom and top it with the rest of the ingredients, reserving some of the cheddar chz for the very top.

This casserole is so much tastier than the traditional tater tot casserole!  I added a pound of cooked hamburger, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Definitely a great "cold-day" dinner!

This was really good.  However, I made a few changes.  I didn't use any butter at all, I used Mozzerella cheese instead of cheddar because it's all I had, and Durkee onions on top  because I didn't have any Cornflakes.  It was still delicious and didn't miss the butter at all.

Great recipe.  I'll definetely use for dinner guests -- makes a lot and is easy to do ahead.  But, there was absolutely no need for 1/2 cup butter in the recipe AND on top of the recipe!  In fact, it was way too rich with the butter.  Next time I won't put any in and about 1/2 on top.  But there will definetely be a next time!

This was absolutely delicious. I completely omitted the butter and used cream of mushroom soap instead of chicken b/c of my own personal preference. I've always loved tater tot cass., but my husband wasn't a huge fan. He loves this version though!!

This recipe was yummy!  My kids really enjoyed it, and so did I and my husband.  I made a few changes though.  I didn't have cornflakes so I used regular saltine crackers and poured the melted butter over them.  Also, I used frozen tator tots (for lack of time to thaw them), and I cooked it for about 1 hr. 15 minutes.  I covered it with foil for the entire time except about 15-20 minutes.  When I uncovered, I watched until the cracker were nicely browned them removed it from the oven.  The sour cream makes it very rich, so you could probably adjust the amount to your liking.  This would be very good if you added chopped ham, or for breakfast added crumbled sausage.  Yummy!

To lower the calorie content, I used LIGHT sour cream, doubled the tater tots and doubled the soup.

Tasty, easy, and quick.  However, found it a little boring; it just needed something....maybe something spicy?  Green chiles, jalapenos?  Maybe some greens?  Peas, green beans? Overall, great idea.  Liked the added crunch from the cornflakes (watch out, they'll burn, so cover with foil about half way thru baking).  Used cream of mushroom soup since I had it on hand and left off the parmesan cheese.  Didn't thaw the tots and still cooked thru.  A little experimenting, this could easily be a favorite.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!!!
I wanted this to be a dinner entree so i did the following.  
1 lb ground beef browned, then I added in 1 cup of frozen chopped onion and 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies to the pan of beef.  Seasoned this with herbs de province and then placed it in the bottom of the casserole dish.  Instead of using 1)10.5 oz can of soup I used a large Family size can of Campbells Cream of mushroom and reduced the amount of sour cream i used.  
Topped the beef with the tater tot mixture and then sprinkled additional cheddar cheese and parm on top.  Then I topped this with these new cracker crisps that Lays has come out with.  They are their new Air Cracker crips in the cheddar flavor.  melted the butter, combined the crackers with and topped the casserole.  It was really good and even 10 times better 2 days later when we ate the left overs.  DEFINATELY A KEEPER!!  THANK YOU!!

I made this recipe for Easter Sunday dinner, and it was very well received.  I used fat free sour cream, and 97% fat free soup to save a little on the fat and calories.  The taste was great.  I also assembled all the ingredients with the exception of the corn flake topping the night before and refrigerated it.  It save a lot of time and still came out great.

We really liked this recipe, but before I go any further, bypass this recipe if you are on a sodium restricted diet.  With all the sodium in the soup, cheese, sour cream, and even the tater tots, this is most certainly  sodium overload, even without the seasoned salt.  Having said that, I have made this recipe three different ways. One just as it is, one adding a pound of browned and drained ground beef, and one with the ground beef and green pepper.  All three are good.

Very tasty.  I opted not to use cream of chicken and used cream of celery instead and didn't add the corn flake topping and it was very good.  Thanks :)

My husband and I liked this, even my 15 month old son enjoyed this, & anything my son will eat more than a bite of is a winner in my book. I did add some diced ham to mine, used reduced fat cream of chicken, light sour cream and I left the corn flake topping off, we aren't fans of crumb toppings on potato dishes most of the time. I also reduced the butter down to 2 tablespoons total... the three of us alone could eat that whole dish in one sitting so I just couldn't justify using the full amount. It still tasted good with less butter and it wasn't greasy either. I wasn't sure about using cream of chicken vs cream of mushroom soup but it turned out very good & id make it this way again if we were out of cream of mushroom soup and were craving some tater tot casserole.

Bea, I tried this recipe for a bring along dish, and I was asked several times for the recipe. It is one of those old fashioned comfort foods that people still love. I was out of  cornflakes cereal, so I used buttered crackers, which I crushed, and sprinled a few fried onions on as well before drizzling the melted butter on. I also sauteed the butter and onion together before adding the other ingredients into the bowl(I love that particlular taste), so maybe that added to it as well. It is now one of my favorites-thanks again!

I really liked this recipe. I made a couple little changes. Instead of using 
cream of chicken soup I used cream of onion and omitted the chopped onions. 
Therefore making the dish vegetarian. I also used 1 cup bread crumbs 
instead of the corn flakes. The dish was a big hit at Thanksgiving and I'm 
using it again for Christmas.

I did not care for this recipe. I wasn't sure what I was thinking putting 1/2 cup Butter into one dish. Save the butter for the top only, 1/2 the amount of it. The top, I will say, is absolutely devine. Needs some meat as well: I think chopped uncured Cherrywood Bacon!

This is a wonderful dish!  Here are a few tips to save a lot of calories and not alter the flavor:  1.) Don't use any butter.  It's just not necessary.  I do spray a little PAM over the corn flakes so they brown.  2.) Don't bother with the parmesan.  This dish has plenty of flavor without it.  3.) Add uncooked diced chicken breast.  It cooks perfectly in the time called for in the recipe and makes this side dish into a main dish!  Some similar recipes call for breakfast sausage or ground meat and I was afraid that would change up the dish too much so I experimented with chicken and you hardly know it's there!  I cook a lot and this is one of my all time favorites.

Yummy !
First time having Tater tot casserole. To make it a full meal I added well seasoned cooked ground beef, cream of mushroom & chicken soup, and a couple of tlbs of jarred jalepeno's diced which gave it a nice kick. I left out the butter and corn flakes and added the cheese 20 mins before the hour was up and cooked uncovered.. Everyone loved it.  Thanks 4 this great recipe. Its a keeper. Jan

Probably fattening but it's great comfort food. My children loved it. Let's face it, I've had the recipe in my file for almost 10 years! I guess that makes it a keeper.

My first review on this site!  Awesome recipe, just what I was looking for, well mostly... I did make a few changes.  I browned up a package of turkey breakfast sausage, cut 'em up and added to the tots.  I also didn't add the 1/2 c. softened butter to the mix, so made sure to grease my pan well.  I omitted the parmesan and eyeballed the amount of cornflakes.  Instead of melting and pouring butter on top I used my large hole cheese grater and grated some on, letting it melt in the oven (it's easier to "spread" around evenly then pouring on melted).  Happy family here!  Thanks!

Good recipe.  I skipped the butter (it doesn't need all that extra fat).  I didn't have any sour cream unfortunately although I know that would have been awesome.  I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes because I just like bread crumbs better and I reserved some of the cheese for the top.  I also used cream of celery soup instead of chicken because that's what I had.  I was also lazy and used onion powder instead of real onion only because I was making this for myself only.    I still used one can of soup and enough tater tots for me only.  Makes it a little more creamy.  If I were making this recipe for 8 I'd probably use 2 or 3 cans of soup.  I can see it being a little dry.  Just a tip, microwave your tater tots for a few minutes to thaw them before putting them in the oven.  It helps lower the cooking time.  I also found I could cook this at 375 instead of 350 without a problem (at least in my oven).

My family and I enjoyed this very much. After reading the other reviews, I did tweek it. I used a butter flavored non-stick spray in the pan and cut out the butter in the mix. I also placed the thawed tots in the pan and poured the mixture over them. I used creamy chicken & mushroom soup(that's what I had). 8 oz. of sour cream and 8oz of green onion dip. I also sprinkled 1/2 pack of dry ranch into the mix. Instead of corn flakes, I crumbled sour cream & onion potato chips and used about 4Tb. of butter. While the changes didn't do much for the fat, salt, or calories, it was not bland at all. We really liked it and I will definately make it again.

I doubled this recipe and baked it for 1 1/2 hours.  I used a disposable large pan(retangular turkey size).  I omitted the butter that was supposed to be used in the dish itself and only used the butter for toasting the cornflakes.  It turned out absolutely delicious!!!  I decided to make this dish as a "filler" in case I hadn't ordered enough food from the caterer.  Everyone loved it and there were not leftovers!  I had 4 guests ask for the recipe and one wouldn't leave until they had the recipe with them.  This is definetly a keeper!!

Super easy & Very good, I added some ground beef and I forgot to buy butter so I left that out completely. It was rich and yummy, my son who is super picky ate it! I also added some sour cream and onion potatoe chips to it.

WOW! This is one of the most savory dishes I have ever had! Unbelievable.  I mean, what could really be bad about fried potatoes and cheddar. I followed one of the other reviewer's suggestion and cut the butter down.  I didn't add any to the potato mixture but dotted the top of the casserole with 1/4 cup before cooking.  I also used a condensed mushroom soup (not cream of mushroom) and cut out the corn flakes to make this acceptable for Passover.  Oh and I also left out the parmesean because it didn't seem like it would taste good with the other flavors.  Amazing!! Thanks so much!

I usually make hashbrown casserole and decided to try this for a little change.  It was good.  I cooked it as a side dish with hamburgers and everyone loved it.  I did cut butter amount in half like others suggested. Thank you!

This was sooo yummy!!  My husband even loved it (which rarely happens)! I cut the butter in half.  And used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes b/c I didnt have any. Also used about 1 Tbsp of minced onion, maybe could have increased it.  My tater tots were frozed and still cooked fine in 1 hour, then I let it sit with foil on top for about 15 min til our turkey burgers were done.   Made for a yummy side dish!!

This was awesome!! I did change a few things. I cut the sour cream back to 8 oz. and used 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of 1. I also added 1 cup milk and 1 lb. browned/drained ground beef w/ the tater tots. I then mixed all the liquid/spice ingredients and poured it over the tater tot/meat mixture. I then topped that w/ the cornflake mixture and baked as directed. My boyfriend loved this! I will definitley be adding this to my regular rotation! Thanks Bea :)

This was pretty good, but a bit too rich for us. I think we just aren't tater tot casserole people, but I thought I would give it a try since everyone seems to love them ;-) It wasn't bad - if you like tater tot casserole, give this a try!

Yum!  So good!  I added 1/2 a block of cream cheese that I had.  Made it even that much better!  I also changed from cornflakes to Ritz cracker crumbs and no Parmesan cheese.  Never a real fan of Corn Flake toppings.

I loved this recipe.  It is way better and more of a complete meal if you add veggies on the bottom (corn, broccoli, peas/carrots etc).  I didn't use any butter at all and it was great!  Regular sour cream and soup-no butter needed.

Everyone loves this dish when I make it. I too cut way back on the butter, I only put about 2 T. of butter in the mixture and didn't put any on top.  Also I used a mixture of the butter garlic crackers and fried onions for the topping. I also used the healthy request cream of mushroom soup and used light sour cream and no one knew it was a lighter version.

Very good and easy.  A new family favorite.  Only changes made, based on other reviews:  reduced softened butter to 1/4 cup, reduced sour cream to 8 oz and replaced excess w/8 oz cream of mushroom soup.

I fried the onions with a pound of hamburger.  It definitely needed the hamburger.  Also, it needed mushroom soup, which I used.  Not the chicken.  The flavor was delicious; however, next time I will use half as much corn flakes and finely chop them.  They were just too much.  But otherwise, it was delicious.

This recipe is a great side dish, I left out the butter except for a tablespoon to mix with the flakes, it was fine. One thing that bothers me is the nutrition police, all things in moderation is our motto. If you don't like it move on, no need to make the poster feel bad and youself look snarky.

I just loved this recipe. My only changes were to leave out the butter in the mix (I did use it with the cornflakes)and to leave out the Parmesan cheese (only because I totally forgot it!) It was the perfect comfort food for a freezing, snowy day. I enjoyed the crunch the cornflakes provided on the top. Excellent and Easy.

I added 1 Pound Zesty Pork sausage, and some fresh garlic rather than powder, and I omitted 1/2 Cup Softened butter. I also used a box of white cheddar cheeze-its rather than corn flakes. It smelled fantastic, and tasted alright. I think there's too much sour cream, that's coming from a sour cream addict! NEXT TIME I make this, I will do the same changes I noted above, but halve the sour cream and add in another can of soup-- cream of chicken & Mushroom or something like that.

Id have to say this was an ok recipe.  Although i did add a can of cream of mushroom. Seems like it would be really dry without it.  I didnt use as much sour cream, and i totally omitted the butter.  I mushed apart about 20 tots onto the top of the casserole with some ritz crackers and 1/4 of the grated cheese.  The kids seemed to really like it.  Hash browns would probably work even better.

I didn't think there was necessarily something wrong with the recipe... I just don't like the way it tastes, as did everyone else.  I still have 90% of it and will have to throw it away.

This is an easy, delicious recipe.  Like others, I omit the butter (the cornflakes still crisp without it).  I also sometimes make it more of a rounded meal by adding ham or ground beef and veggies like peas and green beans to the mixture.

I fixed this the other night with a few modifications:
* When mixing all the ingredients, instead of using 1/2 c. butter, I cut it down to 2 TBSP.
* I omitted the Parm. cheese and paprika.
* I used mild cheddar.
* I didn't thaw the tater tots.
* I added cooked ground beef with onion to the mix.
* I added basil & meat tenderizer (with the meat).

Overall, this is very similar to the popular hash brown potato salad. This didn't seem very dinner-y to me, more for a potluck. Because it's a little sloppy, my son wouldn't touch it. It might sit heavy on your stomach with the dairy content -sour cream, cheese, butter - so make sure you're not watching your calories with this one. Because my tater tots were frozen, it took a little while longer to cook and I spread foil underneath my pan to catch any bubbling over (which didn't happen with me). 
And a tip, unless you're using a glass baking dish, spray Pam, or you might be scrubbing.

This recipe was great. I tweaked it just a bit and came out great. I did not thaw the tater tots. I put them in a 9X13 casserole and then poured the mixture over the tater tots. Instead of corn flakes, I used fench fried onions. YUMMY Also instead of cream of chicken, I used cream of mushroom. I took this to recipe club and not one bite left! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!!! Very tasty.....first of all I love tater tots....grew up on them as a kid....this was a great casserole. I made a few adjustments....I used low fat cream of mushroom soup(instead of the cream o'chicken), fat free sour cream....omitted the softened butter completely...and used leftover cornbread crumbled with about 6 tabelspoons of melted butter for the topping(since I didn't have cornflakes). This was very good...hardly missed all the fat that I cut out. Will make again real soon!

My husband and I both found this recipe to be a little bland.  I sat there trying to think what I could do to make it better the whole time we were eating it.  We both ended up dumping salsa all over it.  I also felt that it took longer than 15 minutes to prepare with cutting up the onions and grating the cheese and everything else.  I didn’t have any problem with mine being too runny though as some others did (I used margarine).  Mine seemed to be fine in that manner.  I decided that rather than try to fix it I would just scrap the recipe.  There are so many other great recipes on this website I don’t want to settle for something that neither my husband nor I were in love with.

Very Tastey.  I cut the amount of butter used in half,  and it turned out really good.  I also used the onion tater tots,  and omitted the chopped onion to make it easier.  Overall Good.  My co-workers loved it at a pot luck!!!

I made this for the Forth of July.  Everyone loved it, but the kids.  My husband asked me to make it again, and my mother in law asked for the recipe.  That was a first.  This was GREAT, but I will use less butter next time.

This was good.  The next time I make it I will try using onion flavored tater tots for some extra flavor.  We thought it could use a little more salt.  Over all we liked it.

Made this for my son's 17th birthday party exactly as written.  Then I made it again and again and again!  Great for large gatherings, keeps better than French fries and other potatoes on a buffet and everyone loved it.  Some preferred it to be spicier and grabbed my cajun seasoning to top it and others preferred sriracha.  It's easy to "top" with bacon, extra cheese or chives and feeds a crowd.  I'm asked for it at every gathering now! THnk you!

I loved this recipe.  I decided to use cubed hashbrown potatoes instead of tater tots.  I added all the cheddar and then added about a half cup of colby jack to the potatoes.  You can cut the amount of softened butter to the potato mixture in half but putting all the melted butter into the corn flakes is important, they crisp up so good !!  I made all of the potatoes but there is a ton so I filled up the baking dish and freezer saved the rest of the potato mixture for a later time.  The recipe as written does make a ton.  Make this and you will have  a great side dish,  I made them with grilled soy sauce turkey tenderloin on the grill and veggies.  You will love this recipe.

I made this for my husbands lodge. They all loved it. I changed a few things. I added two cups of chopped chicken. A small can of chopped green chiles. I sautéed onions, chilies and chicken together in a two table spoons of butter thats the only butter i used in the recipe. I used two cans of cream of chicken soup. Two cups light sour cream with a hint of sriracha. (Hot sauce).  I used ritz crackers for the topping. I'll make it again.  Thanks.

This is a wonderful base. The cornflakes topping was kind of strange for me; I have seen this type of topping on lots of casseroles and it's pretty standard, but I guess it just isn't me. I'd prefer to just sprinkle some of the cheese on top or serve it with a breadcrumb or Ritz cracker topping. Still...not an everyday dish, but it's yummy.

This is my go-to recipe for potlucks and events, but I strongly suggest leaving the butter out of the casserole entirely.  (You will still need butter for the topping).  And people love the corn flake topping, so I recommend using as much of that topping as you think you can stand.

This tastes great! I made a few minor modifications. I sautéed the onion along with fresh garlic in the 1/2 cup of butter rather than putting in the onion raw. I also added cooked bacon to the mixture (since this is going to a pot luck party). I love how buttery and crispy the corn flakes are on top! Yum!

A huge hit with my family!  I didn't have garlic powder, so I added minced garlic instead.  I also added a little bit of milk--maybe 1/2 cup.  I didn't have enough tater tots to put in the mixture, so I added them to the top.  YUMMY!  I will definitely make again and add the recommended tater tots!  There was not any leftovers!

Great recipe although I took others advice and did not put any butter in nor did I top with corn flakes, the tots are crispy enough.     Put a layer of tots, then the mixture and added frozen mixed veggies (this recipe is similar to a Minnesota family favorite that calls for ground beef and steak seasoning) But great taste, this version without butter and the topping is very light and not to rich.

Yum! I sauteed the onions in 2T of butter first, rather than add butter to the mixture.  And I also used 1 cup Panko with 4T butter for the topping rather than the cornflakes.  Great recipe!

This is a good recipe, we omit half of the butter, and don't usually make it with cornflakes.  The recipe needed a little punch, so we added a pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar, which helps a lot.  The biggest drawback to this recipe is that although it tastes great and is easy to make, it is so unhealthy, 150% of your daily recommended fat intake in one serving.  Ugh.  We only make it once in a while (it's ok to have junk food occasionally).

I made this for my family tonight.  I suggest not adding any additional salt as it made the dish too salty. I also did as another reviewer suggested and left off the cornflakes and used Durkee French Onions( be sure to cover half way through baking if you use these because they tend to burn if left uncovered too long)

Yummo! I have never had anything like this before. I eliminated all the butter, sauted the onion and mixed it with the cheese, sour cream & soup (I used cream of celery). I spread the soup mixture on a casserole dish then topped with the potatoes and didn't put the cornflake topping on. The potato went nice & golden brown on top & the bottom went all soft & creamy in the sauce. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this wonderfull recipe for a party I had at my home.  Everyone loved it!  I did make two changes.  The picture didn't look very good with the corn flakes.  Instead, I used grated crakers in butter and sprinkled that over the top.  I also didn't use the paprika.

I think this is delicous.  I added one can cream of Chicken and one can cream of celery and only 1/2 the sour cream.  I also used no butter at all and frech fried onions on top instead of buttery cereal.  yummy!

This was delicious, but be sure and cut back on the butter like everyone is saying. Otherwise, too greasy.

Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!
I added some hamburger meat to the bottom of the casserole.  I am making it again tonight, but will saute the onions first b/c some of the family members didn't like the crunch.  But we all loved it!!!!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I was looking for something to make with my leftover ham.  So, I added cubed ham.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I added cream of celery.  I enjoyed the corn flake crust on top. Yummy!!  Thanks for sharing!

I opted not to use the cereal, parmesan or paprika and it turned out just fine. This is one of those recipes you cannot live without. It proves to be the perfect last minute easy recipe that we all need once in a while. It's delicious and easy and is the perfect heart warming meal! 5 stars for sure.

Soo good! This is a great recipe.  I had been holding onto the recipes for a few months and finally made it last night.   
I did make a few substitutions: Instead of tater tots I used 2 lbs. bag of frozen hash browns(the loose, small cubes)and I added 1 c. of Hormel Bacon Bits. 
Also, the next time I make it, I will add cubed ham and use Panko flakes mixed with the butter for the topping instead of the corn flakes.  I really like the corn flake topping but other family members didn't share the same opinion.

With some tweaking this would be great. bake the tater tots and get them nice and crispy. all the butter, sour cream, and soup really make it a mushy mess oterwise. i added a pound of ground beef and cooked the cup of onion in a little bit of butter before adding it to everything in step two. CALORIES CALORIES CALORIES!iI'm sure there is a way to cut the fat, i just havent figured it out yet. But my boyfriend almost passed out he was so overjoyed w/ the end result!

Made this for my family, to try ahead before taking it to a potluck. We love the usual hashbrown potato casserole recipes, but this was a little too salty and rich for our tastes, I'm sure because the tater tots are already pre-seasoned. I would probably hold off on the seasoned salt if I were to try it again.

I found this recipe to be a bit bland. I added a pound of cooked hamburger meat to jazz it up a bit, but it still needs something - maybe green pepper or jalapenos? My husband on the other hand had three helpings. If you like very mild tasting comfort food like he does, this recipe is for you. I did use low-fat sour cream and could not tell a difference in the taste - still very rich.

This is very good but VERY salty.  Next time, I will use a can of low-salt cr. of chicken soup and cut the seasoning salt down to 1/4 tsp.  I added 1 lb. of cooked hamburger meat to the bottom and, per others' recommendations, cut out the butter in the mixture and only melted 1/4 cup butter to add to the cornflakes.  I didn't have time to thaw the tater tots, which I would recommend, it was a little hard to mix the ingredients.  Next time, I will cut the recipe in half for my family of 4.

I forgot to put in cheese but didn't miss it. even at only 1/2 cup it was pretty greasy. 1/4 cup is probably just right. I didn't have cornflakes so subbed sour cream chips, just a handful.

I did not add the corn flake topping. I added hamburger and used cream of mushroom instead. I left out the butter and used all the sour cream. Too much sour cream, maybe half it and maybe add some butter? Also, I will sauté the onions first next time.

I've made this many times over the past 5 years and it's always a hit. I reduce the butter in both the recipe and corn flakes to 3/4 of a stick instead of a full stick. Also used a 1/2 cup of ranch dressing in place of 1/2 cup of the door cream and it really added some good flavor to it. I think next time I'll add a pack of real bacon pieces.

I liked this, but it had a little too much butter for my taste. Next time I will probably cut the butter in half and leave off the topping. Thanks for sharing!

I used Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream, added 3/4 bacon bits the real ones by Oscar Mayer, I also used Great Grains banana nut crunch cereal instead of corn flakes.  I used what we had and eat instead of going out and buying ingredients that we might not use.  picture us before baked will upload after vsked.  I also did not mix the tots in the mixture I layered the tots on the bottom and then put the mixture on top then layered tots on the mixture agsin. I did brush the 1/2 butter on the tots and sprinkled parmensan cheese.  once cooked I layered shredded cheese on top to melt.

just made this, it's really good but I gave it 4 stars because of the things I changed. I left out all the butter, only had about 8oz of sour cream on hand and a cup of grated cheese. I was surprised that there was no actual meat in the recipe so I boiled 2 large chicken breasts and shredded them up to add with the tots. I also sauteed the onion and added cayenne instead of paprika since my husband likes things spicy. He loves it, and the spice is not too bad for me (I'm a wimp). I topped it off with more grated cheese that hubby brought home, threw it under the broiler, and huzzah! Totally making this again. It's really good, I like it with a bit of ketchup, and I would probably add some bacon and call it a breakfast casserole :)

I just made this last night and my family loved it! Just be sure to leave out the extra 1/2 cup of butter because it is not needed. I also added some crumbled bacon to this recipe and it tasted great!

My family loves this. I leave out the butter in the main dish and only us a 1/4 cup of butter with the flakes. I add 1 pound of cooked ground beef and a can of peas and corn in mine. I also add 8 oz of mozzarella along with the 8oz of cheddar. It's a quick dish to make and feeds a lot of people.

This is a very decadent casserole. Like most everyone here, I agree, you don't need 1/2 c butter in the mix. 1/4 c is fine or omit it all together. Important on the cornflakes, put them on at the end.  Mine burned in 20 minutes. I used cream of chicken & mushroom soup and added bacon and diced green chilies. It was amazing with the bacon. Zero leftovers!

My family loved the recipe too.  I made a few alterations also.  I completely removed the butter.  I mixed all the ingredients but added 1 lb of ground beef and used only half the tater tots.  I put the rest of the tater tots on top, instead of the corn flakes and seasoned the top with the parmesian cheese and paprika.  It was a big success.

WOW!  Only one word to describe this!  Yum Yum Yum!  I changed just a few minor things that made it the best!
1) Did not use as much butter - 
2)  I crushed approximately 4 Ritz crackers on top along with Crispy Onions (Garlic Pepper) made by Fresh Gourmet.  Comes in a small bag and usually found believe it or not by the salad and fruit isle.  

Had 20 people over and everyone left with the recipe!   Thank you 

:)

We do this casserole with bagged frozen hashbrowns, as opposed to tater tots----and we add either diced green chile or diced jalapenos---it is great, it does sound odd, but it is sooooo good!!!!

I have made this several times, and taken it to potlucks.  It is one of the first items to be finished off.  I add more seasoningd to my taste (i.e onion powdergarlic powder and chipotle tobasco sauce).  This is another recipe people always ak for.

This dish was OK, but I probably won't make it again.  The only change I made in the recipe was to reduce the butter to half the amount called for.  The taste was good, but I didn't like the texture of the tater tots.  It might have worked better with hash browns instead.  I also think that bread crumbs might taste better than the corn flakes.  All in all, the it was a bit of a disappointment.

Fabulous! With some changes...Used diced hashbrowns, 1 lb ground beef, green pepper, red pepper, yellow pepper, onion. Used half the sour cream & added helluva dip, used cream of mushroom & onion soup, used Italian seasoning but no garlic powder/salt, added pepper, added no butter to the mixture, used 1/4 cup butter with the corn flakes and also topped with tater tots, did not use Parmesan cheese or paprika. Family loved it and it really wasn't that greasy.

I make this all the time for my family.  I think they're sick of it by now. I tweaked the recipe a little bit to make it a little taster. I use lb of ground beef with onions, sometimes I add green beans or corn.  Then I add a can of cheddar cheese soup and cream of chicken. I don't thaw the tater tots, I just throw them into the pan with the mixture and let it cook for a couple minutes. Throw a bunch of sharp cheddar cheese on top and cook for 45 mins.  YUM!

I used this recipe in a cafeteria that serves around 120 people daily.  Besides adjusting the serving size, I kept it as it was, and it was one of our most popular sides.  Kids really like it too.

I brought this to a potluck dinner for step-son's hockey team. It was GONE by the time came to clean up! I didn't add the butter/cornflake topping because I didn't have any cornflakes & really didn't think it was necessary. And I didn't add the seasoning salt because I didn't have it on hand either. But parents & kids alike raved about it & I got a few requests for the recipe. No one had ever heard of Tater Tot Casserole but I'm sure it'll be on a few tables in the near future! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I tried this recipe as it was written and my family said it was too salty and mushy.    Next time I will try and add lots of veggies to the soup mixture and put the tots on top to crisp them up and maybe slash the seasoned salt.

This was very tasty and filling.  I served this casserole up with some mixed fruit and green beans.  The only thing that was missing was hamburger meat.  Next time I will add meat to the casserole.

I have been making this for a couple of years and I recieve nothing but raves about it.  My children's friends now ask for it when they come to dinner.  I usually make it without the topping, but either way is GREAT!!!

This is a great & easy recipe!  It was a hit at my housewarming party.  I didn't use the cornflakes & extra butter and just kept it to the parm cheese & some extra chedder on top.  I would go easy on the onions too.

This is a great base recipe.  To make it more of a complete meal, I added: ground beef, a can of green beans and an extra can of soup.  I also sautéed the onions prior to baking.  This makes a lot of food.  When cooking this for myself, husband and my 1 year old - I could half this recipe and still have enough to re-heat for the dinner the following night.

This dish was quite tasty...I would only change the "Corn Flake" cereal topping...I would suggest that you use a crumbled up "Cheez-It" crackers topping instead...the "Corn Flake" topping was a little too chewy for me.

We really liked this. I held the butter out of the cheese mixture, so it only had a 1/2 cup mixed with the topping, and it really cut down on the greasiness but didn't dry out the cornflakes.

Yummy! Though I changed it a bit due to ingredients on hand/personal preference. My changes included:

Add 1 lb browned ground beef
Add 1 package onion soup mix
Remove: onions, other seasonings.
Halved the butter as others suggested.
Did not add the cornflake/butter topping. I had no topping-type stuff on hand, so I just baked 'as is'.

Delicious! Probably next time, I would layer half the tater tots on top, though, to brown up and hold shape better. Very comforting food!

Made this recipe last night... I didn't have cereal so I used crushed crakers. My husband and I liked it...youngest son said it tasted like too much butter. Next time that I make it, I'll cut back on the butter.

I have not eaten a tater tot in many years but there have been many changes in my life recently which have changed my cooking needs! Cooking for kids! We all loved this and will make it regularly from now on! I combined two tater tot casserole recipes from this site, III & IV and added my own touch.
Greased 9x11, layered mushroom soup, 2 cans beans and dried onion rings. Browned hamburger and sausage on top of onions. Topped meat with III and sprinlked with paprika. Baked 45 min. Then topped with more dried onion rings and popped back in the oven for 5 minutes.This was so good and will be a great leftover! My boss made the meatless version and her family loved it too!

That was exactly the type of tater-tot recipes I was looking for. Very yummy...a little too onion-y because of the tater tots already have some flavor, but I liked it. Will make again.

Pretty good, although I did alter it a bit to reduce the fat content.  I left out the butter and cornflakes.  Used low fat sourcream and milk and added some chicken to the dish for more substance.  I suggest you layer the dish with foil, it was a big mess after serving.  Tasted pretty good, served it with hotsauce (which made it better) and it tasted much better when cooled off.  But I think w/o the meat, it wouldn't have been as great and yes, it does need some zip to it.

This recipe was great! I did cut back the amount of butter used, and limited only to the corn flakes.  Next time I plan to throw some shredded chicken in it.  Yum!  The kids loved it, too!!

great taste, way too greasy. Next time i will only use 1/4 of the butter and only put it in the topping not the dish itself. Other than that it had excellent flavor. Will definately make again.

I agree this is a great recipe.  My boyfriend didn't like the corn flakes, so next time I made it without.  Also added some diced japs like someone suggested--it's now a favorite!
