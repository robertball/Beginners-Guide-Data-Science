I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and added about 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar...it added sweetness to the spicy/tanginess (my preference I suppose). Grilled up nicely with good color, and juicyness.

I used boneless chicken breasts for this and they came out very moist.  The cider vinegar tenderizes the chicken nicely but doesn't leave an aftertaste.  I used Frank's Red Hot and doubled that along with the worcestershire.  This reminded me of a buffalo wing marinade so I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 1 tsp. of celery salt vs. all regular salt.  It smelled great on the grill!

Juicy, flavorful chicken.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, marinated overnight.  The vinegar isn't too strong, and the hot pepper sauce isn't too spicy.

This is the juiciest chicken I have ever grilled. I marinaded the chicken for 3 hrs. I will be using this marinade often.

This marinade is very good!  I used two cloves of fresh minced garlic and I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I halved the recipe since I only used 4 breasts.  I already put the chicken in the marinade before reading to reserve some aside for basting but it still turned out very yummy!  Next time I will use bone in chicken for more flavor and marinate longer.

Juicy and flavorful!  My guests loved this and asked for the recipe.  Did not change anything and I recommend using bone-in chicken as stated.  Boneless is just not as flavorful.  Takes a little longer to cook but so worth it!

I made this last night, my husband tasted it and said "what did you do, go to KFC and get Kentucky Grilled Chicken?". I thought he had seen the recipe still up on the computer but that was his honest reaction upon seeing and tasting it.  I thought it came out juicy but not as good as I was hoping for. I didn't get to marinate it for the full 4 hours so I'll try again and see what happens.

I've had tastier marinades. It turned out kind of bland, and the chicken was not as tender as I was hoping.

It seemed like there was a missing ingredient that would have amp'd up the flavor.

This was ok. 6/2/2012 - Had to come change my rating.  The first time I made it, I marinated but didn't baste while the chicken was cooking.  This time I marinated and basted it while cooking and it was delicious!! Def will make again.

This is really good.  I will be using this often.  Thanks so much.  I cooked in the oven (we had terrible wind that day)  I can't wait to try on the grill. I used thighs because thats what I had.

This recipe is fantastic! I try to push this on all my friends bc anyone who has not tried it is truly missing out. I let my chicken marinate all day long in the fridge and usually serve w/ grilled potatoes in summer and in the winter months I serve w/ mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. Delicious!

Easy and awesome marinade.  I added 2 tsp of minced garlic and a little more hot sauce (I use Krystal).  Marinated in fridge for a day then took out half the meat and froze the rest for later use.  At first we were worried it would have too much of a vinegar flavor, but it wasn't.  I made this with boneless/skin less breasts that I pounded to about 3/4 inch thick and grilled for 8-10 minutes each side.  Quick and easy and I have some ready to thaw for next week.

This was surprisingly flavorful for so few ingredients. The only thing I did differently was add some garlic to the marinade and use chicken breasts. It was tender and so easy to prepare. Will make again!
