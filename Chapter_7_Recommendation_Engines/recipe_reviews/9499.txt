I did like this as a cookie. I only used raisins, sliced almonds, and diced, dried apricots for the fillers. It is a sweet,chewy cookie that I'm sure is very low fat since it does'nt have any eggs or oil. Be sure to grease your cookie sheet and I suggest rolling the dough with lightly buttered hands to form balls rather than just spooning them onto the cookie sheet.

This was truly a crowd pleaser.  I made mini fruitcakes using three mini loaf pans, and baked for 40 minutes.  Great gift idea also, wrapped in holiday plastic saran wrap and tied with ribbon!

Finally a low fat cookie that actually tastes good!  I made about 30 medium sized cookies, and added some wheat germ when I ran out of whole wheat flour.  I also reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and the sweetness was perfect.  Just make sure to watch carefully as they cook, because even if they don't look done on top, they may be burning on the bottom!

Made these into 10 mini loaves. Also made some changes: used about 2 tbsp. each of honey and molasses in place of sugar, added about 1/4 cup canned pumpkin; added nutmeg and cloves; used raisins, prunes, dried apple, dried pear, dried apricots, cranberries, walnuts, and almonds as filler; added some wheat germ; sprinkled with sifted powdered sugar. The first day they tasted just OK, but I put them in the fridge and the next few days they tasted better and better. Very dense and chewy. Next time I might try added a bit of almond liquor.

these cookies truly are delicious! and nutritious, I'm sure. 
I used honey as a substitute for sugar. Also, I added 1/2 cup of fresh strawberries because I didn't have dates, and that made the cookie very juicy, fragrant, and irresistible.

This recipe makes delicious cookies.  I also added 1/4 t. cloves and 1/4 t. nutmeg, to add a little additional spiceness.

This has to be the easiest cookie recipe I have tried. I adore fruit cake but dont want to wait to eat it so this is a perfect recipe for me. I followed it exactly. The dried fruit mix had the peel included so I used 1 cup of mix and did not add the 1/2 cup peel called for and my chopped nuts were pecans.  Even cook time was right on. Thanks Tuula

they are more like little cakes than cookies! very soft and chewy and very very moist and full of taste! I put dry sweet fruit mix like coconut, mango, papaya, banana, pineapple and so on and they comes a little to much sweet, so next time I will reduce sugare depending on the fruit mix I put into..When cooled they have a wonderful crunchy surface but soft and chew inside. Time and temperature are perfect. Not for breakfast, better for tea o coffee time!

These were so good!! I made them as a cookie. I didn't have much dried fruit on hand, but used raisins, a dried strawberry fruit bar, and some cut-up marshmallow. I also added a half cup of oats for more filler. I realized I was out of ginger, but added the nutmeg/cloves like the other reviewer suggested. These almost had a molasses taste to them. I will make again. Wonder if there is a way to cut down on the sugar, though, without sacrificing too much flavor. Delicious!

These were just very delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and chose pecan for my nuts.  For those people who don't like the taste of whole wheat, I must tell you that you cannot taste it at all.  I will definitely make them again.

I could not find my own recipe for fruitcake cookies, so this recipe was my choice.  I should have gone with my gut and realized that with only two tablespoons of butter, these cookies would stick.  I could not get the first cookies off the sheet at all. Stuck to the sheet like glue. This was a nice quality airbake sheet that I have baked hundreds of cookies on!  For the next batch, decided to spray the sheet with non-stick spray.  Most cookie recipes do not require this step.  It helped, but they still stuck and many were torn apart as they were removed .  They tasted just ok.

Oh boy, a new recipe that I really love and don't feel guilty about. I didn't see how this could work without egg or shortening, but I read reviews.  Thanks folks!  I tried to make them as printed, but I did add the cloves and nutmeg, and found my batter so runny it needed an extra 1/4 of flour to be able to hold together as a cookie (no way could I have rolled it into balls...worked fine dropping by teaspoons.)  I added half a candied cherry to the top for holiday cheer.  Will make again and again with different combinations of fruits.  Think I will like it best without the candied peel...just lots of dried apricots, prunes, dates, cherries.  A real winner!

OMG this recipe is FANTASTIC!!!!! I also swapped sugar out for honey and molasses 2tbsp each and used 1/2 cup cherries, 1/2 cup mixed fruit, 1/2 cup sliced almonds (all chopped) I had some raisins soaked in rum, so I used 1/2 cup of that as well.  If anyone knows what 'a carribean bun' tastes like then welcome to this take on it!!  Thanks I will be using this time and time again

Made this today.  Used fruit I liked and doubled.  Used orange juice instead of water.   Cranberries instead of raisins. I am freezing for the holidays.
