I cut this recipe in half for a trial run just to see if we liked it before I made a full batch. In a half batch, I did increase the baking powder to a full teaspoon and the baking soda to a half teaspoon. I also used a teaspoon of apple pie spice instead of plain cinnamon. I did use a good quality apple cider as well.  The kids thought these were great--they ate all six pancakes. Thumbs up--this recipe's a keeper.

My family loves anything Apple. But these pancakes were disappointing.  The apple flavor was barely detectable, they were thin and elastic. I think this recipe has potential.

Makes a nice smooth pancake, not too sweet.  Good use for leftover apple cider.

This recipe has potential, but needs tweaking.  I followed this recipe to the letter, my review is based on the way it is written, and how they turned out without modifications.  The batter was very thin, so I added a little more flour (the only change), and what I ended up with were pancakes that had no rise at all and were a bit rubbery.  These pancakes were not even remotely "fluffy".  On the positive side, it did have a nice, subtle apple-cinnamon flavor.  This recipe definitely needs more baking soda and baking powder to get a better rise and some additional flour.  I won't be making this again, instead, I think I'll just go back to my tried and true pancake recipe and add some apple pie spice.
