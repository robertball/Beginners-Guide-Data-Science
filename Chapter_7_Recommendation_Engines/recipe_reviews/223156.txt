Sometimes great dishes/recipes are born of necessity, as was this dish tonight.  As a Roman Catholic on Ash Wednesday, I needed a meatless dish and, because I am “hitting the road” again in a couple of days, finding ways to use the fresh produce in the fridge was a priority.  An ingredient search quickly led me to this recipe and it was a winner for me.  I didn’t measure anything – the beauty of cooking is that you can use ingredients to your own tastes rather than adhere to strict measurements as is the case, for the most part, with baking.  If you want more soy sauce and oyster sauce (as I did) add a little more!  More sauce?  Add a little more cornstarch mixed with water or chicken broth.  I had mushrooms as well as broccoli to use up so I substituted the mushrooms for the indicated water chestnuts, which I really think I prefer anyway.  I tossed this with some spaghetti to which I added a good dab of butter and finished it all with a sprinkle of chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds. It was a simple and deliciously satisfying dinner. I and my tummy are doing a happy dance.

I tried this recipe in hopes of finding the perfect garlic sauce.  Unfortunately, this wasn’t it.  This is very weak on flavor and just feels like it’s missing something.   To perk it up, I doubled the amount of oyster sauce and also added a tsp. of sesame oil which helped a great deal.    After reading the instructions, I felt this recipe lacked some basic cooking principles, so I chose a different route.  After sautéing the garlic, I added the shrimp, stir-fried until cooked and transferred to a separate plate.  To avoid the risk of a clumpy sauce, I mixed up all of the sauce ingredients (including the corn starch) in a separate bowl and then added it to the wok.  When it was thick, I tossed with the steamed broccoli, shrimp, and water chestnuts.

I chose this recipe because it used ingredients I had on hand. The only change I made was to substitute chopped celery for the water chestnuts. Although this was quick and easy to make it was very bland. The amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce was far too little to have any impact. These ingredients should be doubled or tripled.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Tasted like it came right out of a restaurant too. I made a few changes based on what I already had at home. I used 1lb wild caught frozen shrimp,  powdered ginger, instead of peanut oil, I used olive oil and instead of chicken broth I used veggie broth. I used a store bought veggie stir fry mix instead of the fresh broccoli. I love lots of sauce in my meals so in a separate bowl I added broth with a couple spoonfuls of flour. It really thickened up everything. I will be making this for my family again! 

Oh, before I forget, I also added about 1/4tsp of cayanne pepper as I thought it was missing something just couldn't figure out what.

Very nice.   I used a 50/50 blend of sesame oil and olive oil instead of peanut oil and I used powdered ginger instead of ginger root.   I also left out the water chestnuts and I used a lobster base instead of the oyster juice.   I also added in a little white pepper.   I know this sounds like not even the same recipe by the time I was done, but I believe it would have been just as good as written.   You might say that my inventory dictates my recipes.   Oh, and I used fully cooked shrimp.   I should have thickened my sauce before adding in the shrimp, but I didn't so they got a little tough, but still tasty.   I will make again.

It's so good my husband thought I bought take out! I cooked the shrimp in garlic, added some extra seasoning or it would of been too bland and then added the broccoli and sauce. Delish!!

Hubs said this one is a "do it again".  I used mushrooms instead of the water chestnuts, and served this over angel hair pasta.  The sauce could use a little "kick".  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper.  Good recipe!

Delicious! Although we took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the broccoli, shrimp and sauce each separately and then combined at the end. We also made a quick shrimp stock from the shells and used that instead of chicken stock. We also doubled the oyster sauce.

I thought it was was pretty good. Added more chicken broth. Used sesame oil instead of peanut oil. Did not not add the ginger or water chestnuts. Used granulated garlic and red pepper flakes. Definitely will add more garlic the next time. Threw in some scallions and cauliflower. Served over rice. I will make again w/the above adjustments.

This tasted authentic however I did make some changes. I used avocado oil instead of peanut oil. I stir fried the shrimp after adding the garlic. I then added the steamed  broccoli and water chestnuts. I whisked coco aminos, chicken broth, sesame oil, ginger, cayenne pepper and cornstarch together and added it to the pan after combining the shrimp and broccoli.  I didn't have oyster sauce so I left it out. I added green onions and sesame seeds at the end. It was delicious!

I enjoyed this recipe, but modified the measurements and added Maggi crayfish seasoning in the mix and some extra spicy pepper flakes in the mix. 
It had a restaurant quality taste and look. I’m keeping this recipe.

I had high hopes for this recipe but I agree with a previous reviewer...it was missing something.  I doubled the soy & oyster sauces which didn't seem to help.  I also took the reviewers suggestion to sauté the garlic and shrimp then remove from the wok before combining all wet ingredients with cornstarch to thicken. That worked well.  The recipe also says to steam broccoli before adding to dish.  Big mistake.  I got a wok full of mush.  I may try this again but will add raw broccoli.

I made this tonight and enjoyed it. When I have had this in restaurants, it has been darker in color and sweeter. I followed the recipe exactly until ready to serve, then tasted, and added a couple of Tbsp of brown sugar to sweeten it up. Served it over white rice. It was quite good and I will make again.

This was my first attempt at this recipe. I must say, I did pretty well. After reading some of the reviews, I tripled the soy sauce and oyster sauce. I also double the ginger root. I did not have peanut oil so I used sesame oil. I also added red peppers and mushrooms.  My family enjoyed the dish as well as I!!! All in all, I would make this again.

We loved it!  The only change was to substitute a 1:1 ratio of hoisin and soy sauce for the oyster sauce we didn't have.

I agree with most of the other cooks, you must double the oyster sauce and soy and I added more ginger.

I found the flavor of the sauce to be a bit lacking, so I add dried shiitake mushrooms at the same time as the shrimp.  That gives them just enough time to rehydrate, and gives a nice rich taste to the sauce.

Bland and boring. Needs a lot of work. I used more garlic and ginger than called for. I did not have water chestnuts (actually don’t like them) and therefore used carrot  matchsticks instead. Oyster and soy sauce needs doubling and there is way too much cornstarch. You only need 1-2 tsps and mix in some water first unless you like lumps. Even with that it was too plain so added ~1 T chilli gatlic paste but if you don’t have that then try some red pepper flakes. With this the fish was just ok..

I was looking for a recipe with an Asian sauce and decided to go with this one. The only thing is, I just made a shrimp chop suey dish so I wanted something else. I used the sauce and broccoli but skipped the shrimp and used veggies. I sauteed celery and onion in vegetable oil. After about 8 min, I added chopped zucchini and eggplant. I had the chicken broth aside and kept adding tblsps of it to keep the contents moist and not burn. After a few min, I added micro-steamed broccoli, bean sprouts, with a little hot sauce and sesame oil. This needs more flavoring; maybe more oyster sauce and garlic? I had this dish, along with my shrimp chop suey, and it was a nice dinner with a sweet chile sauce on the side.

This had absolutely no flavor! Such a disappointment.  I would double all of the spices and then still add more ginger and garlic to give this some flavor.  Just terrible and can't believe it got decent reviews.

I love shrimp and I love garlic but this recipe was just not to my liking. All in all, it was very bland. I guess I could spend time trying to doctor it up  but really don't think it would be worth the trouble.

Tasted great. I didn't have peanut oil so I used olive oil. The other change was celery instead of chestnuts (my wife hates them). I also doubled the soy and Oyster sauses for more flavor. Served this over brown rice and it was delicious.!

Used 4 cups broccoli and a whole can of water chestnuts. It was very good.  We added some hot sauce as it needed a kick as others have said.  May add crushed red pepper next time and we thought crushed peanuts might be good too.  Will make again for sure.

Although I made minor changes, like adding the cornstarch and thickening before adding the shrimp, adding spice and ground pepper, carrot shreds (slightly cooked down), and I finished it with fresh chopped parsley....This came out very nicely and served as a great base-recipe. I enjoyed it and will make it again with my minor changes...

I made this tonight and it was pretty good. Hubby said that I could make this dish for dinner again at least a hundred times.   I made a few changes.  I upped the garlic cloves to about 8, and used a press instead of mincing them.  There were reviews that this recipe was bland, so I added an onion cut into wedges and about 2 Tablespoons of Szechwan spicy stir fry sauce.  I boiled some udon noodles, then stir fried them in canola oil in the wok with some of the pressed garlic and oyster sauce, soy sauce and spicy stir fry sauce. I used tongs to put the noodles aside, then added the rest of the garlic, onion and broccoli and cooked for three minutes. I added the shrimp and soy sauce, Szechwan spicy stir fry sauce and oyster sauce. When the shrimp was opaque, added one tablespoon of corn starch mixed in a half cup of water, let it boil until thickened. Served over noodles.

We loved this recipe! Tasted like a restaurant dish.  It is very savory (not spicy at all as written) and delicious. We made 3 small changes out of necessity- (1) no peanut oil, so we used sesame and olive oil, (2) no oyster sauce- was still yummy, and (3) when it was time to add cornstarch, I pushed the shrimp over to one side and didn't add the broccoli until the cornstarch was thoroughly mixed into the sauce with a fork (added 3 Tbsp) b/c I didn't want the cornstarch to clump. YUM.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. I couldn't believe how quick and simple it was. I'm not a fan of water chestnuts but I love snow peas so I used those instead. I added diced green onions. I also added a dash of sugar because it seemed like like it was lacking that sweet flavor most Chinese food has. I would suggest going easy the ginger because I used 2 teaspoons as the instructions said but the flavor seems a little overwhelming.

This is quick and easy and perfect for those busy nights.  I substituted 1 tbsp of sesame oil and 1 tbsp of olive oil for the peanut oil.  I wish I had added the cornstarch before adding the shrimp just so I could adjust the smoothness and texture of the sauce.  It didn’t have as much jazz as I had expected, but it was still very good and could be easily adjusted.

Having read some of the other comments ..  I will also play with this recipe by using some mushrooms, celery, red pepper and even maybe one or two chilli peppers for a little kick. This WILL be a recipe I will use often. Flavor was quite good ... I like to bulk up my menu with lots of veggies so I will add more than the recipe calls for :-)
