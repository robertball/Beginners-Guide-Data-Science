I have the exact recipe in a favorite Italian cook book of mine!  It's excellent and can be adapted in many ways.  My favorite is to eliminate the lemon zest and lemon extract in exchange for 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  While the cake is baking, I make a simple syrup and add sliced berries (strawberries usually) the juice of an orange and enough cold water/corn starch to thicken.  Once the berries break down, I serve this sauce over my cake.

For those of you in question whether or not you grease the pan and claim to be expert cooks:  shame on those of you who question this!  *LOL* No sponge cake or angel food cake should ever be baked in a greased pan; it won't rise like it should otherwise!  Invert your pan over a bottle, allow the cake to completely cool, then run a sharp knife around the edges and the middle part of the pan, then gently stick a finger down the side of the cake and loosen the bottom, working gently and carefully.

Excellent cake, excellent recipe!

Great recipe!  This recipe was easy to follow and turned out great.  I would definitely say using a handmixer (on the highest level) to get the whites to a stiff texture is a must!  I kept the lemon extract and did not use a substitute and the cake came out perfect.  In fact, to get a heavier lemon flavor, you could even use a tiny bit more.  As it was, the cake turned out the perfect consistency, light, flavorful, and visually appealing.  I'd use this recipe for a shortcake instead of an angel food cake any day.  I also doubled this recipe because I was using a 9x13 rectangle pan.  However, it was a little more than I needed so I made a spill-over loaf.

This recipe is great! Good flavor and taste with 1 T extra lemon juice. I TRIED to substitute Splenda Baking Sugar for the regular sugar and it did not really work.  Totally my fault! Not an error with the Recipe. Thanks for submitting the recipie!

Excellent recipe, finished product has perfect texture and tastes great.  I found that this recipe is not very forgiving and recommend that it be carefully followed.  Although, lemon flavoring might be too strong.  I prefer it with two tablespoons lemon juice.

Very light and fluffy - be careful it feels like you can't get full on it. I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and added 2 Tbsps of lemon juice instead of lemon extract and took away a bit of the water to make up for the extra juice. I took it out earlier than an hour - check 45 minutes after you put the cake in the oven. I also didn't preheat the oven - in case anyone was wondering.

This cake worked out great.  I was using it for a base in tiramisu, so instead of lemon, I used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I also used whole wheat flour (instead of cake flour) as someone suggested, by grinding it in the coffee grinder.  The tiramisu was great!  Anyway, we had some leftover plain sponge cake for dessert tonight. I figured out that it tastes just like a twinkie!  Weird.  Anyway, bake time was only about 43 minutes in my oven.

Excellent! My recommendations: use lemon juice, not extract, but increase to 2 tsp. Regular flour instead of cake is fine, as long as you sift it. Cream of tartar is not needed - instead, add the lemon *juice* to the egg *whites* before whipping (lemon juice & cream of tartar are interchangeable as egg white stabilizers).

Excellent. My great aunt used to make a similar cake, but I never had the opportunity to ask her for the recipe. 
I used all purpose flour with 1 tbsp of baking soda, 2 capfuls of lemon juice and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Baked at 375 for 45 min. It was a little hard to remove from the pan, but eventually relented. The crust was thick and chewy and the center moist. Great! I made sure to let the cake rest for 30 min after removing it from the oven.

This is a great recipe!  A friend asked for "something lemony" for his birthday, so I used this recipe and made it into a roulade (jelly roll), and then used Carol's "Lemon Filling"  inside it.  Everyone said I'd outdone myself.  I'm sure it's great as a tube cake, too, and will try that over the holidays.

I followed this recipe to a tee and the cake turned out great! Be sure to preheat your oven long enough (give it 20 min or so), else the cake may not rise properly. Also, make sure you use a whisk instead of rubber spatula to fold egg whites into the yolk mixture - it's so much faster and easier, and above all, it prevents the egg whites from losing their volume. Lining your pan with parchment paper can be helpful for easier removal of the cake. If you are a beginner, check out the sponge cake article on Allrecipes. It really teaches you a lot!

Overall, this was pretty good.  It was a nice dessert.  However i didn't find it had that 'fresh cake' taste that most cakes normally do.  It also wasn't as soft as other sponge cakes I've had.  I had wanted something lighter, but instead I got a cake that literally tasted like a sponge.  Although I still enjoyed it.

I have used this recipe a billion times and have never been dissapointed!  I always take out the lemon extract and replace it with vanilla, also I take out the zest completely!  Holds up extremely well when carved, frosted, and cut and has a great texture and taste!  I have never baked it for the full time and it has never been over/under done!!!!!!!!

I literally made 5 sponge cakes to decide which one to use in my trifles.  This one was the winner.  Don't change a thing.  It's divine.  Not too eggy, light and fluffy and moist.

This has to be the best sponge cake recipe I've tried yet! Perfect texture!  The only changes I mad was to substitute the lemon extract and zest with 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract. I didn't have lemon on hand but if i did, i'd use fresh lemon juice.  DO NOT grease the pan! Because the cake is so light, it will not rise! If your cake turned rubbery, do not over mix the flour and egg yolk. Take care to gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture bit my bit.  Watch the cake starting from 30 min. Mine started to brown at around 40 min and so I took it out just in time. I'd reduce the time to 35 min next time.

What a simple and easy recipe!  I used 2 T lemon juice since I didn't have extract or zest.  Baked in two loaf pans and shortened the bake time by 10 min.  My wife loved it! (and that's very high praise)

This is the best sponge cake I made, it is soft and yet moist. Very easy to prepare. I baked it in a 10 inch bundt pan for 45 minutes. I beat my egg whites first, then used the same hand beater to beat my egg yolks. Sprayed baking spray on my pan. I used cake flour and sifted it before adding it to the eggyolk mix, I try not not overbeat the flour with the egg yolk mix. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was an excellent recipe. I did not have a lemon so I used 1/2 a package of unsweetened orange drink mix crystals (about 3/4 tsp) and the flavor was outstanding. I also cut the sugar content in half. I baked the batter in a medium loaf tin and then cut the cake lengthwise (after cooling) and added a layer of raspberry jam which was quite complimentary to the orange flavor. Because I didn't use lemon juice, and because I only used half the sugar, I cut down the water content to 2 tbsp and 2 tsp. I also didn't have cake flour so I placed whole wheat flour in a coffee grinder to make a fine cake flour. I also omitted the cream of tartar. I will use this recipe again. Thank you for sharing!

Finally! A sponge cake that retained its volume even after cooking. I have a recipe that calls for squares of sponge cake, which I make in an 8"x8" pan, and every other recipe I tried fell flat. But this one stands tall!

I did use this recipe to make home-made Twinkie™-like filled pastry... and this didn't give me any heartburn like its name-sake.  I filled them with various fillings such as a wonderful ganache with butter-crunch cookies, vanilla-bean pastry cream filling, and almond schmear.  I was in heaven!!!  Because I was planning to use other flavors, I only used Mexican vanilla as my flavor base.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

And no -- I'm NOT sharing.  They can make their own!

This recipe is very simple for an intermediate level chef.  You have to know which consistency the yolks must have before gradually beating in the sugar and you have to know how stiff the peaks of your egg whites must be to get the right "sponge" consistency (and fold them in carefully, little by little).  I added butter flavoring, eliminated the lemon zest and added vinegar in place of lemon juice.  It turned out perfectly for the "bieskwie" I made for my family here in Belgium - a sponge cake filled with chocolate mousse and whipped cream, topped with chocolate chips and "iced" with more whipped cream.  It was fantastic and I'm making it again tonight just because we loved it so much.  If you're comfortable working with egg whites, this is a no-fail recipe!

I scaled the recipe down to half and made a test cake, and it came out great. I made sure to use cake flour, as opposed to all-purpose flour. Learned that lesson the hard way before. I also used vanilla extract instead of lemon since I didn't want a fruit taste. While the egg whites fluffed in the blender, I mixed the yolks, sugar, water, vanilla, and flour in a food processor to speed up the process. Baking for 45 minutes was plenty time for my test cake. In fact, I may have over-baked a little. The cake came out very spongy and springy, just as I liked. Other reviewers complained of an eggy taste, but I didn't get that from mine.

Glorious is the right word!! if only i could give 6 stars..

The best cake i ever made. Though i was a bit hesitant by the no-greased pan. I admit getting the cake out took some effort (specially since i don't have non-stick bundt pan) but it was well worth it. Make sure you don't overcook it or it'll stick to your pan. I used 10inch bundt pan and it only took 40mnts at 165.

Just make sure that you beat the yolk till lemon color and thick, and beat the whites till stiff. And fold carefully (i add the flour to the yolk first, add 1/3 of the whites to the yolk and add the yolk mix to the remaining white. I know it's a pain but it does make a difference).

i was a little scared making this recipe at first since i didn't know what "stiff peaks" and "folding" was, but with a little googling, i decided to try it out since my hubby wanted to eat sponge cake!  to those who said that their cake stuck to their pan, this is because your cake was overcooked! I know this for a reason because my oven was being stupid and half of my cake ended up overcooked and the other half perfect.  The perfect side came out of the pan easy breezy while the overcooked side took a lot of scraping...
I did substitute the lemon flavour with 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract and baked for only 45 minutes.  next time, i'll probably only use vanilla extract since hubby found the almond flavor to be too strong.  overall, fantastic recipe, will use again!

I don't know what went wrong.  Only the top half was edible.  I must have not whipped my eggwhites enough or used too much flour...the bottom half of the cake was like rubber.  I used 2 tsp. of fresh lemon juice instead of the extract according to another review.  Any other ideas of why it flopped????

Wonderful cake, turned out beautifully! Hubby thought it was store bought it came out so good. I was nervous about reviews saying it was stuck to the pan after cooking, but did not have an issue after allowing it to cool fully. Great texture. I did sub vanilla for the lemon, and cook time was a good 20 min less (but I cooked this in 2 loaf pans).

Absolutely perfect. This was light, fluffy, and a gorgeous shade of golden. I made mine in a silicon muffin pan, for "strawberry shortcake". I also substituted vanilla extract and cardamon (recommended at the shortcake recipes) for the two lemon flavorings. The cakes were reminiscent of angel food cake in flavor and texture, without the hassle of measuring egg whites and having leftover yolks! Definitely a keeper!

This was an easy recipe to follow. Make sure you don't get ANY yolk in with your whites, because the whites will not fluff. The cake turned out great and had a nice flavor. I will be making this for Easter.

This cake is PERFECT!!!! The users that had problems must had made error some where. I followed the directions EXACTLY with just one minor adjustment. I used vanilla instead of Lemon.... I just prefer it. It looked and tasted amazing. Please don't try to change it because you think you know better. Like most other users it only took 45 min. in my oven. Kudos....

Wonderful classic sponge cake but not with lemon extract.   Really does not need it with the lemon rind.   Makes a great base for so many things, e.g. strawberries, blueberries, trifle or just by itself.

Taste good but the texture was not as light as I expected. Maybe if I used cake flour (not all purpose flour), the cake may be lighter. I baked 45 min as many reviews suggested. turn out nice. 

For the topping, I put in jelly-liked cover with orange / grapefruit meat. I think it goes well with the sponge. Here is the recipe for topping.

Water 300 g 
Concentrated orange juice         50 g 
Sugar 100 g 
Corn starch        20 g 
Butter 20 g 

Put everything, except butter, in the sauce pan on miduim/low heat. Stir constantly until thickened around 5-10 min (or until syrup-liked texture). Off from heat and stir in butter. Stir frequently while you lay orange meat on top of cake. Gradually pour/spoon in mixture over the cake. Let it set at room temp or in fridge.

I made this in time for my birthday for my family.
First time I attempted to make a sponge cake! I halved the recipe and made about 10 cupcakes with this. Baked at 325 degrees for 35 min. 

The cake itself was just-right in sweetness so I didn't need frosting. I cut each cupcake in half and spread berry-flavored Chobani (kiddie version that is whipped) with some jam in the middle, sprinkled some powdered sugar on top, and served it. Deelish.

om nom nom! Yum!  I omitted the lemon and put in 1 tsp of vanilla and it was very tasty.  I baked in 2 bread pans and next time need to cut down the baking time if using these pans again.  I'd say 50 min next time perhaps as the edges were quite brown.

This cake was a flop for me.  Did exactly step by step.  I see it does not have baking powder so i re did another cake with baking powder and nothing.

Can someone please give me some advice

GREASE THE PAN...The recipe calls for an ungreased pan, but I wish I'd done it anyway.  Despite using a non-stick bundt pan, it stuck to the bottom and tore when I finally got it out.  I usually make sponge cakes in a springform and have never had that problem before; I wanted to make a larger cake this time and chose this recipe to help with proportions.  I substituted vanilla&almond extracts and orange zest--it tastes great.

I love this! Nice, lighter cake that I have made several times. I skip the lemon extract and such, and just use vanilla and it's always fantastic! Last time, I frosted it with buttercream frosting from this site (Rick's Buttercream Frosting). YUM!

My family LOVED this cake! I made it for the 4th of July as a base for the "Berry Tiramisu Cake" on this site. We loved the cake so much, I'm making it again without the berries and everything on it! The lemon flavor is just right! Makes a light cake great for summer desserts!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Cake stuck to the 'ungreased' pan (last time I'll make that mistake).  It was more dense than I'd wanted, I was expecting a light, airy cake.  I won't make this again.

Very simple, easy recipe with consistant results.  The lemon flavor is VERY SUBTLE, so I made a quick glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar to drizzle on cake.  Mine was cooked after 45 minutes.

The texture of this sponge turned out wonderfully.  Loved the lemony flavor.  I used two tart pans instead of a tube pan, and topped it with a thin layer of whipped cream and fresh fruit for Christmas dinner (having been asked to bring a "healthy" dessert, LOL).  Everyone thought it was very "elegant".  And best of all, easy!

Time consuming, but well worth the work. It made a great anniversary cake for my inlaws. I filled it with raspberry jam after patting with amaretto. I covered it with Butter Cream frosting.

Good. I made with 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 almond extract instead of the lemon and it had a good flavor. I used an angel food cake tube pan (with the removeable bottom) and had no problem with sticking. I only cooked it for 40 minutes at 325, maybe those that stuck were overcooked? Needed to invert it for 25 minutes. Frosted it with strawberry marshmallow frosting (but used cherry) from this site. Yum.

I haven't ever given a recipe on this site one star before.  I have a weekend business of making cakes for parties, ergo, I know how to bake properly.  My friend has a birthday tomorrow and he requested a lemon sponge cake.  I have not made one before given that I do not like sponge cakes.  I found this recipe and tried it given that it was ranked highly by its users.  I followed the instructions exactly including this statement:  "Pour batter into an ungreased 9 inch tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for one hour, or until done."  My cake is completely stuck in the tube pan.  I assumed that since the author took the time to point out that the tube pan is to be ungreased (which is usually not the case with cakes baked in tube pans), they meant that the tube pan should definitely be ungreased.  It is 9:30 PM right now and I have to start over using another recipe for my friend's birthday given that the cake is permanently attached to my tube pan.  To say the least, this is frustrating.

Glorious! I'd never made a sponge cake before, so I was worried. I followed the directions to a T and this recipe came out perfectly! I was worried that my cakes would be difficult to get out of the pan, but I just had to slice around the edges and underneath, and  they held their shape perfectly. So easy, and I'm a first-timer! (I also used Carol's "Lemon Filling" and topped the cake with strawberries. Divine combination!)

A fantastic recipe. This was my first sponge cake, and I think it came out perfect. (We'll see what the family says tomorrow. I sneaked an early taste!)
I used a teaspoon of lemon juice (not the fake stuff), and it gave just a slight lemon taste. Not to overwhelming, just right.
The cake is fluffy, beautiful in color, and melt in your mouth delicious!

I made this with regular AP flour (i did sift it). I also don't have a bundt cake pan so I put it in a large bread loaf pan. It fit just fine an turned out spectacularly! Oh, I also replaced the lemon with vanilla because I have one son who does not like lemon flavored desserts. If you are separating the eggs and not very good at it, just be fearless. Pay attention and as soon as you think a yolk is broken just toss it into the yolk bowl. I was afraid because 2 out of my 6 egg yolks broke. There was even a little yolk in the egg whites. I scooped it out with a spoon and went on my way. The egg whites whipped light and fluffy just fine.

I honestly did not like this cake much. Even though it came out just the way it should, and I followed the recipe to a T, it was really hard to get it out of the pan, Even after I had let it cool upside down over a bottle. I had to dig my fingers all around the cake down to the base to try and loosen it up. It did end up coming out, but with much effort. It did not break however, but that's because of it's extremely sponge-like texture, which I did not like much. I know it's supposed to be "spongey" but It was soo elastic it felt like I was eating a sponge. I still gave it a four star because most of my family surprisingly liked it! I guess each one his own taste!

I made this last night and it was a hit! My family dug in like no tomorrow. I changed tweaked the recipe a bit. Instead of lemon rind and water, I added two-three extra tbps of lemon juice. It had a faint lemony taste. Overall, simple and delcious!

This cake was awful.  It was barely lemony at all, and the texture was like eating a mouthful of lint.   I know it's a sponge cake (I'll admit sponge is not my favorite, but I was looking for something light), but this literally felt like we were eating a sponge. I added a lemon glaze after eating one piece.  That made it a bit better, but all in all I would never make this cake again.  I am a very experienced cake maker, and this was my worst-tasting cake ever.

i was unsure what "cake flour" was so i just used standard flour - maybe this made a difference in how my cake turned out.  i used 2tbsp of lemon juice (and slightly less water)instead, but followed the recipe otherwise exactly, including using an 'ungreased pan', which i regret now, as my cake was so stuck to the pan i had to literally scrape it out.  i would suggest either using a non-stick baking pan, or baking paper to avoid this. because it came out looking rather unappealing, i used a lemon icing (found on this site) to frost it, which gave it also a stronger lemon flavour that i was after. overall, it still tasted nice, and i especially loved the texture of the cake.

Sponge Cake Noob Help: I’m a sponge cake noob and my first attempt at this fell, so I want to give advice to other noobs out there that may help.  This is an awesome cake, and when you nail it you will love it.  But if you aren’t certain you know how much to beat the eggs, watch a youtube video on what beating egg whites until they are stiff looks like!  My first crack at this I was afraid to over beat the egg whites and the result was disastrous.  But I did a rematch last night with a little help from my Super Husband and he beat the stuffing out of the egg white until I was faint with fear that they got so darned fluffy! I thought that couldn’t possibly be right.  It was! It was very right! And the cake came out beautifully!  AFTER CARE: I baked my cake in an ungreased bunt pan and flipped it upside down over a bottle when I took it out of the oven. After it cooled I righted the cake, ran a skewer around the edges twice and the cake popped out. It's delicious, and it makes a fantastic tea cake!

I didn't change anything and used a lemon glaze to "frost" the cake. I Tried it a second time using orange zest and extract it it was still an amazing cake. It's low enough in sugar if you don't glaze or frost it it's diabetic friendly. The texture is lovely...almost that of angelfood cake. This is fast becoming the "go to" quick dessert.

I used vanilla extract instead of lemon extract and my cake came out fine. I also only needed to keep it in the oven for 40 minutes. Next time, I'll spray the cake with simple syrup to give it some moisture.

I made this recipe twice. The first try I did NOT use "cake flour" or have tube pan!  The 2nd try I used both cake flour & tube pan, both times it did not turn out.  It did not rise at all, very disappointed...

This cake is absolutely breathtaking. Of course, you are going to have lines from where you took it out of the tube pan, but the flavor makes up for it. It is very plain and simple on its own. I tried it with raspberry jam, powdered sugar, vanilla and lemon icing, lemon curd, and other various toppings. It also makes delicious french toast the morning after...trust me!

Fabulous!!!!! I just made this recipe. I did not have cake flour or lemon ingredients so I used all purpose flour 1 cup, 1 tbsp baking powder.For the lemon I used 1 tsp almond extract. I was looking for a sponge cake like the stores have. This is wonderful. I will try it with the lemon next time but they are great. I didnt even need sugar on my strawberries. The other thing I did was cooked them in a muffin pan for 20 min. Then used a small press from pampered chef to push the center down so that they were more like the stores. They are perfect. I will keep this in my recipe box and make again and again. Thank you for the recipe!!!!!

it was ok...the texture was way too thick, it felt like chewing sponge at some points, but the flavor was alright. I used the Lemon Filling on this site and it definitely improved the cake over all. I will try this again with 5 eggs though, and some baking powder.

This cake was amazing and really deserves 5 stars. The texture was fantastic and it came out of the over perfectly cooked and came out of the tin easily as well. I used it to make a birthday cake. next time i'll probably use  bit more lemon because i like the taste but other than that it was a berfect cake, thanks.

I love this recipe. The only change I made was to use lemon juice instead of lemon extract and I cooked it for about 45 minutes. I drizzeled the cake with a simple lemon icing and served it with vanilla ice cream (although I don't think the ice cream was necessary). The flavor and the texture are nice and light and are perfect for a summer dessert.

Great recipe :)

I used 1 tsp vinegar instead of 1/2 tsp tartar 
and 
1 tsp vanilla instead of 1 tsp lemon juice/rind. 

I baked it on parchment paper  on 2 cookie sheets and made jelly rolls.  

They tasted great! Gotta love this website......

Amazing recipe! Replaced the lemon zest and extract with vanilla extract, and subsititied the cream of tartar with vineger, but the cake came out perfect nonetheless. Made a two layer cake with peaches and frosting in between, and then topped it off with some almond and peach slices. It was delicious, and I will definitely make this recipe again soon.

This turned out great, I am glad I used my instincts and only left it in for 35 minutes, as the top was almost burnt. I am not sure why it needs an hour at 325 degrees, but I have a gas oven maybe mine just baked faster. Anyways, I used this for the cake in my strawberry shortcake, it is very similar to what my grandma use to make and I knew she was with me in spirit as I was making this as it tasted almost as good! I left out the lemon, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and kept everything else the same and actually used cake flour. I still haven't perfected my strawberry shortcake but in time I know I will get it right and I will use this sponge cake recipe in the future. This cake has potential for a lot of different recipes.

This was ok, but still not what I'm trying to find for a specific dessert. I did take others suggestion & not use the lemon extract, but vanilla & no lemon zest. Hubs said to try again using them which I will & hope for a little different texture & flavor. Watch the baking time cause I used a large foam pan so I could cut the cake in several layers. WRONG, I got one cause it went down like a souffle. It was also baked & possibly over baked at 35 min.  This is a far cry from 1 hour. Some of my problems are of my own making I know, but even with that aside I'll just try once more using the lemon extract & zest then decide to keep this recipe or not.

The cake is a good recipe but the flavoring is lame.  I squeezed a small orange and added the juice to the egg yoke mix and doubled the grated rind.  Then, I added 1/2 tsp of Pumpkin Spice.  Whole new cake!

Oh yum! It even turns out using whole wheat pastry flour, reduced sugar, and lemon juice.
