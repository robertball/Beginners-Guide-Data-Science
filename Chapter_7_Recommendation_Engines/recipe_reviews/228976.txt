I was looking for a Fried Chicken Strips Recipe to make for my born and raised in North Carolina boyfriend and this was it!  I didn't have potato flakes, so I omitted that ingredient.  I cut my chicken breasts into pretty narrow strips so they only needed about 5 minutes on each side in the cast iron skillet, which was filled 1/4 way with Vegetable Oil.  The Oil should be at about 350 degrees, it is important to fry in a good hot oil but not to the point of smoking.  I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, a little cayenne and garlic powder.  After dipping the strips in the flour, then in the egg and then in the crushed saltines, I noticed some bare spots on the chicken so I sprinkled bread crumbs over the top which filled in the gaps.  After frying they were SO moist on the inside, and CRUNCHY on the outside.  This was a great recipe, and its a keeper, thanks for posting it!

Wasn't bad but i wish there was some more details for us newbie fried chicken cookers like how how the heat because if to high it burns very easy it also didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for and the breading kept falling off. I liked the fact it used up ingredients I had laying around like open packs of crackers and potato flakes, since I no longer make instant potatoes.

I made this last night and it was a hit! I did make some changes: I did not have dry potato flakes, so I crushed some plain potato chips instead and used about 2 tablespoons of that. I also found that one egg was not enough, but you could probably go with 1/4 cup of flour as I had plenty of that left. Finally 1/4 cup of vegetable oil was not near enough; maybe if you were using a very small pan, but for my large pan I used a cup or more (you want the chicken about half submerged in the oil). Not a health-conscious meal, but it is delicious and pretty easy to make. I will make this again.

I made this recipe and it was delish!! The only variation was I used applesauce crackers(store brand ritz crackers) instead of the saltine. Crispy crunchy and tender. So good. Didn't even need any sauce to dip them in.

Simply delicious. I did not have potatoe flakes so I omitted them. One thing I learned from my cooking experience is when I'm coating I put a little milk in the beaten egg mixture, along with 1/2 tsp of baking powder.and in the cracker mixture I added thyme, paprika, and a touch of granulated garlic . I first coat the meat in flour, then egg mixture , then flour, then egg , and with this recipe I did the cracker mixture once at the end right before I drop in the pan. For me the double even triple dipping process keeps the coating nice, thick, and keeps it on the meat. Very good recipe though thank you.

This recipe exceeded my expectations. Thanks to those who clarified what temperature to cook the chicken. As written the recipe makes delicious and crispy chicken strips.

I never have saltines so I use a sleeve of Ritz crackers instead. For seasoned salt I used Lowry's. In subsequent preparations, per the recommendations of other reviewers, I added a dash of garlic powder as well and dredged in flour and egg twice before coating in crackers. I used two eggs in order to do so, but did not need to increase the flour. I left the crackers in the resealable bag and added the other ingredients to the bag, then added the chicken pieces and shook to coat. Much easier and cleaner.

I think the 15-20 min cooking time indicates how long it takes to cook all the chicken, not per piece. It only took me 6ish minutes per batch of strips to cook through using about 1/2 cup peanut oil in my cast iron skillet. The coating was perfectly crisp and didn't get greasy or soggy like a batter-fried or oven-baked strip.

If needed, here are some substitutions for the potato flakes: crushed corn flakes, crushed rice crispies, seasoned bread crumbs, corn meal, or a second kind of crushed cracker.

I served the chicken with a honey mustard, sweet and sour, and garlic lemon dipping sauces left over from a fondue dinner.

The key is the deep frying at 350 degrees, use a thermometer to keep the temp and measure the chicken which should be 165 inside.

The entire family loved it! So glad i found this one. I also used 2 eggs.  I cooked the small tenders in a deep fryer. They were fully cooked in 8 minutes. Just the right amount of crunch and nice and tender and flavorful. Soooo good!

Very good recipe, quick and easy to make.  Perfectly fried and browned with oil at 350.  The cast iron pan is also a must.  Watch how many minutes per side depending on your thickness of chicken.  Two finger thickness all around, will be 4 to 5 minutes per side.  The other's suggestions garlic powder, cayenne are a good idea.  When picking how many breast to cut and fry.  A normal size breast = three nice strips = one person. I needed two eggs for three large size breast.  A shot of milk helps to have more egg.  I'm going to try nuggets next.  And also going to fry strips and nuggets to throw in the freezer for a rush, rush evening.  GREAT recipe. Thank you for sharing.

This is the first review I have ever left and that is because this recipe is perfect.  The only thing I would do differently is double the recipe.  I was only able to bread two large chicken breasts.  Also, I did not have potato flakes so I used some panko flakes that I had instead.  Aside from that minor change I did everything the same and it was a hit!  I am going to use this as my go to fried chicken breading regardless of boneless or not.

Having not been raised in the south, I often get teased by my children because I can't fry chicken.  This recipe changed their mind and gave me a confidence boost!  I forgot the potato flakes, but they were awesome anyway.  I will add them next time!  I don't usually rate recipes, but when I do, you know it's a good one!!!

This chicken was amazing! The recipe is good as is, but if you like it spicier like I do, add some cayenne for a nice kick.  I will definitely make this again. I made 2 batches- the first as written, and the second I added about a teaspoon and a half of cayenne. Next time, I'll also try some paprika, and possibly other spices.

This recipe is one of the best I've ever tried. I left out the potatoe flakes because I didn't have any and I used Lowery's seasoning salt and pepper in the cracker crumbs, but other than that, I made no other changes. The chicken strips are delicious. My family loves them.

This was delicious!  I made a leg, thigh and 2 boneless, skinless breasts.  I can't believe how tasty the cracker crumb coating is.  My boyfriend was delighted too.  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for the recipe LillysMom!

The cooking time is too long. If you heat the oil before cooking it’s more like 10 minutes - 5 per side.

Absolutely delicious!  I made a few changes. I exchanged the saltines and potato flakes for potato chips and club crackers. Instant hit. Will be using this from now on.

I did make changes. One by mistake, I included the flour with the crackers. But still did the amount separately. The second, I sub'd the 1 tsp salt for 2 tsp Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning. I didn't notice the cajun seasoning though. Nor did they seem too salty. I just tried the seasoning to give some flavor but really didn't seem to do anything. The third change, I know right?, we used instant potato out of one of those packets (butter flavored) since we didn't have "potato flakes."
Cooked in the 12 inch cast iron with canola oil and they did come out perfect. The batter stayed on the pieces and gave it some crunch.
I would say this recipe works and is a keeper. 
I thought about after these are cooked to use Chef John's recipe for buffalo wing sauce and toss them in some heat.  Maybe next time.
We had these with cream gravy, mashed potato's, and green beans.

It was pretty good but not outstanding. I followed the recipe pretty much as written except I added some garlic and onion to the flour. Everyone liked these but they were fairly bland and messy to make. Not surprisingly so, but based on the middle of the road reception, I’ll do something else with the chicken.

I loved how my chicken turned out. I didn’t have saltine crackers so I used corn flakes instead. Like others suggested, I added garlic powder. I also put the seasoning directly onto the chicken. Oh, and I didn’t have enough vegetable oil so I used canola oil which turned out great. I did will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have any saltine crackers so I used crumbled potato chips which came out too salty with the seasoned salt added.  I found some salt-free potato chips that my wife bought for my diet (which I had forgotten about for some reason) and used those.  The end result was great!  The chicken had that unmistakable potato chip flavor and was exceptional dipped in ranch dressing.  I am looking forward to trying unsalted bbq chips if I can find them.

These are seriously SO good!  I didn't have potato flakes so crushed up some potato chips instead and added to the crackers.  I also used a deep fryer just because it was already out and ready.  I will definitely make them again!  The only thing I may do differently next time is add some cayenne or red pepper flakes to give them some kick.  Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe!

Yum! These were really good! I did a couple substitutions. All I had was self rising flour, so I used that. I added a bit of cream and hot sauce to the eggs. And I added garlic salt, sesame seeds and poultry seasoning to the cracker mixture. I made a homemade honey mustard dipping sauce and these were gobbled up!

These are the best chicken strips I've ever tasted! They were crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I followed another reviewers suggestion and added garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne to the flour. These are pretty easy to make. I made a honey mustard mayo dip to go with this and it was awesome! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you!!

I didn't have potato flakes, so I omitted them.  Next time, I will cut down on the oil and only use 1/2 a sleeve of saltines.  Yummy, and AJ loved them.

We loved and will definitely make again! I read the comments first, and decided to add extra pepper, a few dashes of Cajun seasoning and some garlic. Also seasoned the flour, raw chicken and egg with salt and pepper. Has a southern taste. This recipe is a keeper!

Oh my goodness! What a wonderful recipe! I made mine with buttery round crackers instead of saltine's and cayenne instead of black pepper. My family ate every last bite. It turned out quite amazing...even though I forgot to use the potato flakes.

I love this recipe! I've made it three or four times now, and my whole family loves it. And you have no idea how hard it is to please my whole family. This is literally the only dish we agree on. I also made a couple of different sauces on this site to go with the chicken: Zaxby's Chicken Fingers Dipping Sauce and Honey Mustard Dressing II.
 PS: I made an account just to make a review for this recipe!

I loved this receipe, however, I don't think I will make it again.  It was simply the mess factor.  I've never cooked anything I had to dredge & fry before, and it was messy!  
1. I tried the way the recipe said: Flour / egg / crackers and that worked fine.  However, I took some review suggestions and dredged twice and went flour / egg / flour / egg / crackers and that was better.
2. I was half way done when I realized I forgot the potato flakes. I don't think I missed them. The end result was still very good.
3. I took some review suggestions & seasoned the cracker mixture a bit. I used fresh ground pepper / celery salt / garlic powder / cayanne.  I think the seasoning was a good add. I liked the added spice.  Now I need to clean the mess that is my kitchen!

perfect texture on the crust and meat.  I do add some thyme, paprika, garlic powder, salt and a half a tsp baking powder to the crackers and some milk to the eggs.

I make chicken strips often when my grandkids come and this recipe was great!  It was easy and the chicken came out moist and tender. I will only add some garlic powder and maybe some red pepper flakes next time for some zip.

Love, love, love this recipe. The only thing different I did was place all my dry ingredients in a zip lock bag. I poured a little of the breading mix in one bowl and had the eggs in another bowl. I started out with 1/4 of the mix then added more to the bowl as needed.  My kids and hubby loved it.

My husband is really picky, and prone to dislike change.  Because of this, I usually don't make a lot of changes, but I am glad I did because he kept telling me how good this was and how much he liked it.  Thanks for sharing this one.

Better half said a 4, but I thought a 3.  Easy to make, but needed some zip.  Will make again, but try adding some cayenne pepper to the cracker, potato etc coating. Think my bake chicken strip recipe is better but will be a good wife & make these again for hubby.

Oh my goodness this is amazing. I loved how crispy it turned out. A couple differences, I added a touch of cajun seasoning to the flour and mixed the salt and pepper with the flour as well. I also only had Betty Crocker instant Loaded Mashed Potatoes. This recipe will stay on hand for sure.

Very good--just wish it wasn't fried.   I even made it worse by frying in a combination of oil and butter.  Won't be allowing myself to eat this recipe very often.
