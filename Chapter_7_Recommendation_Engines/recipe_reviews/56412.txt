What fun, Surfwrench!  This isn't how I typically make sausage and peppers but I couldn't resist trying this with such a cute and catchy name and I got a kick out of how you came up with the recipe!  I used rigatoni rather than spaghetti because I didn't remove the sausage from the casings, so I needed a sturdier pasta.  I just cut the links into manageable sections.  I added a little red wine and used fresh herbs rather than dried.  At  the end, I couldn't resist throwing in some chopped, fresh San Marzano tomatoes from my garden.  Hubs said he likes the way I usually make sausage and peppers better, but when I reminded him that the whole point was to try something different, he agreed this was very good in its own right! I admit my own Italian bias, but beyond that I have to say you can't go wrong with this recipe - it's delicious!

I wedge a large yellow onion and saute it with the peppers, and add more garlic, seasoned salt,  fresh ground pepper, and a shake of red pepper flakes. There needs to be enough olive oil to coat the pasta well. My two Grandsons like it done with Polish Sausage, too.  This is what my Brother-in-law always wants when he comes for dinner. A tossed salad and garlic bread makes a perfect meal.

I tried this one last night and my family LOVED it!! My Italian husband accused me of stealing the recipe from his mother! The only change I made was I added a large can (drained) of diced tomatoes to it. I am definitely saving this one as a family favorite! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've got to be honest, I got major brownie points with my hubby just for texting him that I was making a Godfather-inspired meal for dinner. I did make some changes (2-3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, added a can of drained italian-style diced tomatoes, a splash of red wine, 1 chopped small onion, multi-grain penne instead of spaghetti, and extra sausage cut into bite-sized pieces), but I don't think any of these changed the character of the dish too much. It was tasty and filling, and while he ate, hubby picked up an Italian accent as he told me about movie references to food in The Godfather. I guess that means it was a success - I'll make it again.

This dish was hearty without being "heavy."  Such a change of pace from tomato-based pasta dishes.  The only thing we did different was to remove the casings completely and cook the sausage crumbled.  That way, every inch of the pasta absorbed the sausage flavor. Will make again, and again...and again.

This was very good - I used hot turkey sausage and it was delicious while it cut a lot of the fat from the original recipe.  I got raves and will definitely make this again.

I was thrilled when I found this recipe, as my husband and I both love Italian sausage and pasta. I prepared it exactly as the recipe stated. It was very quick and simple to prepare. I will be serving this dish often. Thank you Mama Corleone for sharing this recipe.

delicious! Hubby & have wanted to try a "sausage & pepeprs" recipe, but were skeptical since neither one of us were real pepper fans. I only used two peppers, an orange & a red. Used at least three times the garlic. Used 5 sausage links, removed the casings and cut into bite size chunks. Cooked covered on med with 1/4 cup water for 10 minutes. Transfered to a plate & used the grease/water mixture in the skillet for the peppers. I also added about 1 cup chopped onion. I think we will add a green pepper next time.

This is a favorite here. I have prepared this many times and always use whatever pasta I have on hand. I leave the sausage in the casings and cut each link into 5 or 6 pieces before adding to the pan. When the pepper are tender, I deglaze the pan with approx. 1/4 cup red wine. This is a great recipe. Fast, easy and perfect results every time. My whole family really enjoys this. Thanks for sharing!

I think that Penne pasta would taste better then spaghetti.  I  should of added more garlic for flavor.  It is missing somthing, as far as making it stand out.  But it was good.  My picky toddler ate most of it and my Itilian husband liked but said the same thing I did about it missing something.  But it was pretty good.  Will eat it again with the Penne pasta.

I used hot italian sausage.  It was still good.  However, I would still use a few red pepper flakes.  Also, the volume of finished product calls for a very large skillet or even a wok.

Really Yummy!!  I often double the recipe and bring it to pot lucks.  Also, I add some wine (white works surprisingly well too), and double the garlic.  One funny thing:  the picture does not show spaghetti, it penne pasta.  Soooo....I went along with the picture and like it much better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my husband and he loved it. It is one of my favourites. It is easy to make and delicious. What I did differently was that I made the sausage into meatballs.

Excellent!!!!!!  I just used a scissors to cut the raw sausage links into one inch pieces and then browned them well with just a little olive oil in the bottom of the pan - enough to get them going, and put in a bowl, not the oven when they were cooked.  I added onions with the peppers and used a lid for part of the time to steam the veggies till they were still a little crisp.  I used Angel Hair pasta.  I marked it excellent and put it in my cookbook here at home and gave the recipe to several people.  I was VERY impressed!

What a catchy name! For this meal I used 1 lb. of Rigatoni pasta and mild Italian sausage. I used a medley of red, yellow orange and green bell peppers, 3 cloves of garlic, and a handful of fresh herbs. While cooking I added a splash of red wine and two Roma tomatoes I had sitting in the refrigerator. I let it simmer a while before it was done. This was a mild tasting and hearty meal.  Right before serving I added freshly grated parmesan cheese which balanced its’ sharp cheesy taste with the mild sausages and peppers! I also serve with a fresh homemade, “Jo’s Rosemary Bread,” also from this site. This was fun and easy to make with delicious results! Thank you for sharing this Godfather-inspired meal with all of us!

I stuck to the recipe and then added a can of diced tomato's like some of the other folks mentioned.  We only sampled the dish that evening and ate it the next day.  It was so much better reheated!

This recipe is awesome. I added a small chopped white onion. I also used spicy italian turkey sausage and whole wheat spaghetti, because thats what my husband and I prefer, it turned out amazing! I added about 1/4 cup of a blend of italian cheeses at the end along with the parmesan. Yummmm I can't wait to make it again

It was good, changes were made though.  Cut the sausage into bite sized pieces, Made a nice sized pot, doubled the sausage, added chopped onion, used Italian seasoning to taste.  Ended up putting in a can of tomato paste and water(we aren't big fans of olive oil soaked pasta)dash of sugar and cooked everything for a couple of hours. It was a nice change from my regular sauce.  Thanks.

Spice it UP!  It was good and my 15 yr ol liked it, something new.  I added about triple the garlic, used 4 oz of sweet italion and 4 oz of spicey italion sausage.  Also added tomatoes right before serving, sliced, and them added about a minute before taking away from heat.

Delicious! My husband took 2 bites and then asked me to save some back for his lunch. I used a fajita blend veggie (sliced red and green peppers and onions) and just tossed those in the skillet with the sausages as they cooked. I went a little heavy on the garlic since we love garlic. Such a simple dish and do delicious too! Thanks, my family loved this dish!

I love this pasta!  I have already made this several times.  My variations include using a pound of penne pasta with about 1 1/2 - 2 lbs of italian sausage, casings completely removed & cut into bite sized pices, and 3 peppers.  I'm also generous with the parmesan & olive oil...the whole family loves it, and it is such a great change from red sauce! Is also great left over!Thanks so much for the recipe!

This turned out great for me.  I used turkey sausage with a little wine, extra garlic and a small amount of red pepper flakes.

This was excellent.  I did add sliced onion and DelMonte petite cut tomatoes to the bell peppers.  And I did not slice the sausages lenghtwise and remove the skins but just cut them in half while they were sauteing.  I also let the dish sit all combined for almost an hour...then reheated adding grated parmesan and parsley before serving.  Very good!

I had this for dinner last night and it was wonderful. I did simmer the cooked sausage and peppers in some Marsala wine and then tossed it with my pasta. Soooooo good.

This dish was amazing!  I substituted penne for the spaghetti, and my grocery store was out of sweet Italian sausage, so I had to substitute the hot. I used peppers of four different colors, so it looked beautiful in the pasta bowl.  I made this because one of my husband's favorite meals is the sausage and peppers at Macaroni Grill.  He liked this recipe better!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Liked the flavor but I was missing the sauce. Ended up putting in some spaghetti sauce. Still a nice flavor and easy to prepare.

This is a good recipe, but to give it more flavor complexity I would combine both sweet and hot Italian sausages and I feel the casings should always be removed because they are tough.  Either break apart into bite size pieces or slice after removing casings.  It also makes a better presentation that way in my opinion.

My mom is always sauteing bell peppers and garlic that leaves something to be desired. The oregano, basil, and permesian cheese are the answer. Serving it over noodles is a great idea, but the sausage didn't do much for me. And definitely don't leave the peppers in such long strips. It makes them hard to eat. (PS- I remember reading about this in The Godfather, but it still doesn't seem like a Corleone family staple.)

The recipe was good, but it called for too many peppers. They watered down the taste. I would have used 3 peppers and added some onions.

I cooked it but didn't eat it.  (I went to sleep, did not choose to not eat)  The family thought it was pretty good though.  I accidentally added an onion since I just naturally assumed an onion would be involved with S&P.

This was very good! I did add or change some things, but I think that's what fun about recipes. Finding a good one, then making it your own. I know some people don't like it when you change recipes, but I think many good cooks do this to fit their own tastes. I used Smoked Turkey Sausage that I sliced and sauteed in olive oil and a splash of Worcestershire sauce instead of the Italian Sausage. I added a large sweet onion, sliced into strips to saute with the peppers. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chopped portabella mushrooms. I tossed rainbow rotini pasta (spinach & tomato enriched pasta) into the mixture after everything was cooked, heated for about 10 minutes more and then added about 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella, stirring until the cheese meted just before serving. I didn't drain the canned diced tomatoes so the pasta absorbed the liquid, adding even more flavor. Family thought this was very good and I will be making it again and again! Thanks for the recipe Surfwench!

This was not a hit at my house. Turned out really dry. I added pasta water to loosen it, but it just never came together. I thought it might be better with a little tomato paste or something. Guess I'm just accustomed to my pasta having a cream or tomato based sauce.

yum! I made this with wheat speghetti and italian chicken sausages. I slices the sausages into rounds for better presentation and easier eating. I love sauce, so I did use a tomato caper and olive sauce on the pasta. This was really tasty and healthy with the alterations. I did agree that the order of preparation directions was a bit off, i added the precooked sauge to the peppers when they were almost tender and did the pasta somewhere in between.

This was easy and yummy. My DH said he would like it again, but he says he has to get used to not having sauce. I added extra garlic. I thought it was good and a nice alternative to the heavy tomato sauce.

Have made this numerous times over the past 2 years, and it is always delicious.  I would never discount the original recipe, but I from time to time tweek it, which is why the original is so good.  It lets you do that.  Of course, more garlic, and I will occasionally throw in some mushrooms and onion.  Usually I serve it on Angel Hair pasta, but that usually only lasts for the dinner.  The left overs just get eaten without the pasta.  Great meal anytime.

Amazing!  I wasn't sure about taking the sausage out of the casing but man what a difference it made!  Def get good Italian sausage, the flavor added alot.  I added a can of italian diced tomatoes and since we love spicy food added some red pepper flakes.   This is our new favorite dish and my hubby has asked for it every night since!

The basics are here, but it's not my favorite. I changed the pasta to penne and am sure that a can of diced tomatos would have pulled it all together.

I used a pack of tricolor peppers for this and used raw spicy turkey Italian sausage from Whole Foods, and used whole wheat pasta (riganoti).  This was easy and tasty and I will definitely make it again.  I'd thought the spicy sausage would be heat enough so didn't add the pepper flakes.  Since I like spice, I'd add them next time but this was a great recipe, thanks!

I should have read the reviews.  It wasn't that flavorful, kind a bland.  I used chicken sausage, which was wonderful and flavorful, but the rest of the meal wasn't.  Needed a lot more garlic (I would use at least 3 cloves).  I would have decreased the amount of peppers and added onions.

Love this!  It is quick and easy and a hit with the family members who like sausage.  A great way to take advantage of late summer market bounty.

I see the potential for this dish, but was not completely successful.  I just moved out of the parents home, and was having them over for the first dinner.  I can cook, but don't do it often (because Mommy cooked for me), so I wanted something that would be easy.  Each step itself was easy, but the timing was off.  I cooked the pasta too early and being a skinny pasta, it stuck together.  I think that if I were more experenced at putting larger dinners together I might not have run into this problem.  The flavors were great, but I might add onion next time too.  So on a whole the recipe is good, it was just user error and that is why I rated it highly.

Good start but a bit bland as is.. doubled the garlic and could have used more.  Needed additional seasonings.  Peppers give a nice colorful presentation.

Fabulous! This recipe is quick and easy. I like the idea of removing the sausage skin but this probably should be done to a half-frozen sausage. It's to mushy otherwise. You can tinker with the amout of sausage and pasta but everything else is just right regardless. I used 12 sausages and 1 pound of regular spaghetti and it came out great. The family loved it and we'll be having this one regularly! Thanks SURFWENCH!  John

I loved how clean this dish was.  As I was making I had a little skepticism, as there is not much of a gravy to go with the dish, but it came out amazing.  Definitely going to be making this about once a month.

It's a decent recipe, I thought having no pasta sauce to be a bit weird for me, so I tossed all the ingredients together and added plain pasta sauce on top.

My Italian, pasta-lovin' hubby loved this! I happened to already have a partial can of Muir Glen Fire-roasted Tomatoes on hand and threw it in at the end, reducing it  before throwing in the pasta.  I also added more fresh herbs and lots of fresh basil. YUM!

I can't wait to make this again. I doubled the amount of pasta (I used penne instead of spaghetti) and it was perfect for me. I also used two to three times the amount of garlic, which also worked perfectly for the pallete of myself and those I made it for. I didn't add in the bell peppers, but it was still great. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Excellent recipe! I followed all the directions but doubled the basil, oregano & garlic. We love seasonings in this house! I also added 2 medium yellow onions & 2 cans of Rotel mild to give it a little heat. I'll definitely be making this again.

Oh my goodness!!!!  This was quick, easy, and delicious. I've tried two others on this site and I've found my go to sausage and peppers recipe. Thanks naples34102.

I only changed to Garden Rigatoni pasta. And then, only after on my plate - I sprinkled some more seasonings - but this recipe is awesome as is! 
Question: I'm a newbie in the kitchen area. I made this recipe ahead of time. (on a Sunday for Tuesday) what's the best way to store and revitalize it?  Actually seems like a dish you eat right away....just wondering. Thanks for a great recipe

The only changes we made were to add a thinly sliced onion to the veggies, along with an extra clove of garlic.  It was a good dinner.

Delicious!  Added extra garlic (since we can't get enough!), a can of chopped tomatoes, a sliced sweet onion, and used hot Italian sausages.  Wondered if I could skip the parsley garnish, but was very glad I didn't...added a perfect extra touch.  I've added this to our recipe box for sure!!

This was very good! The only thing I did differently is I added 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. Will definitely be making this again!

A variant of Italian sausage and peppers, but a great recipe for a busy family.

I pulled up this recipe because I happened to have two hot Italian sausage links and 3 bell peppers (yellow red orange). I also found a bag of rice vermicelli in the cupboard so I used that instead of spaghetti. The only changes I made were to slice up and throw a tomato in with the peppers and added some chicken broth ice cubes and Irish butter. So good.

Delicious!  Made this last night for my husband and me.  We loved it. I will definitely make it again.  The only changes I might make are to add a little more garlic and olive oil.  There did not seem to be enough to coat the pasta, I will have to admit though that I did not measure out a quarter cup and so may have used less than that.  We love garlic in our house and more is always better.

A decent recipe to use as a jumping off point. It was just okay, kinda bland. Next time I'll use more seasoning (probably fresh instead of dried), definitely MORE garlic, and maybe some onion and crushed tomatoes.

I thought this tasted good. None of the flavors were real dominant over the others. Even the herbs weren't excessive. I felt like the noodles could have been flavored a tad more. I made this recipe to stretch a package of chicken sausage I had. With the amount of peppers in this recipe, I would definitely consider buying a bulk bag if not summer time. Red peppers individually are expensive this time of year. The recipe is a little heavy on the olive oil, but worked fine for a filling meal in this cold weather. ty

Tasty!  I took the casing off the sausage and sliced it before browning.  I added more garlic and seasoning, a sliced purple onion, a can of diced tomato and used tri-color penne pasta.

I make this all the time!  I use turkey sausage, but there is so much flavor that you don't even notice.  It is really great, easy and healthy too when you use turkey sausage and one of the healthier noodle varieties.

My family loved this. I didn't have fresh onion so I used minced onion and it worked well. I used penne pasta and turkey Italian sausage and kept it in the casings. My husband loved the flavor.

Excellent....family loved this! I used extra lean chicken sausage that I removed out of the casing, cooked and crumbled with garlic, the onions and peppers and seasonings in the olive oil. Used ziti and mixed all together....topped with pecorino romano and some red hot pepper flakes on mine....there were no left overs....delicious!

Like so many others, this recipe was inspirational!  I used the spaghetti base with the sausage but sauted sweet onion, red, yellow, and orange peppers in evo and butter with the meat.   After 3-4 min on medium heat add about 1/4 a cruet of Good Seasons Italian dressing and let simmer.  The sauce thickens nicely and flavors everything-- toss in the pasta and voila.  My husband ate heartily!

I always follow a recipe as is the first time to be fair, so when I tell you this was a hit believe it. The only thing I changed was to use penne pasta. There were no leftovers. The second time I doubled it and added bacon and mushrooms just because my nephews love them. It's nice to find a great no sauce pasta.

This is a new favorite in our house.  I use chicken sausage and double the amount.  I also double the spices and the garlic. when the peppers are done I put the sausge back in and add about 1/2 cup of red wine and simmer it for a couple of minutes.  I then mix with penne.

This turned out pretty good.  I want to say it could maybe have used a little more seasoning, but maybe that would detract from the clean flavor of the peppers.  I did add onions like other reviewers suggested.  Overall I would make it again.

This is a simple recipe for great tasting sausage and peppers. I always make extra and freeze some. Upon reheating the sausage is so tender it melts in your mouth.

I have to give this  4 star only because of the presentation.  I took the sausage and cooked as I should have but!  I felt it was a better presentation cut up and mixed together like bite size pieces.  But other than that very good!

Pretty good. I used fettucine in place of spaghetti. I also broke up the sausage in big chunks as I was browning it and cut the bell pepper in very short strips. Added parsley at the end and dusted the whole thing with a generous helping of parmesan/romano cheese. A good change from the standard red sauce.

I have made this many times. I really like it. The only thing that I do different is that after I take the casings off the sausage I slice them to bite size pieces and saute. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great flavor and textures. I made it exactly as the recipes goes, and it turned out great. I served it over angel hair pasta.

This was very good and something different than red sauce and pasta. Good for a weeknight meal.  I did add more garlic as per other comments I read.  I suggest adding the pasta to the peppers as I had way more pasta than peppers.

I used Italian bratwurst and this still came out great! A good twist on a boring week night.

Excellent!  We are vegetarians so we used 'Soysage' instead of sausage and it was great. Will make this one again and again.
