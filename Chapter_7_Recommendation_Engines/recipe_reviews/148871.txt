This is one of my favorite sauces to make and eat. One way I found to make the sauce stick better is to dip the chicken in flour first, but it's great either way.

Awesome Sauce.  Family and friends request me to make it all the time.  We use it like ketchup....  Been using it for many years.

The recipe didn't specify to heat the sauce up or toss the wings in it so that is how I first tried it. It was pretty thin so I decided to heat it up on the stove for a bit so that it would reduce down some and give the flavors time to get acquainted. I preferred it warm but either way it was good.
