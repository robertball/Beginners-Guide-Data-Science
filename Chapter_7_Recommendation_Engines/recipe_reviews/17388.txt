This is an old and grand recipe and worth all the effort. BUT, it is a LOT of effort and very time-consuming. I admit, over the years I cheat and adapt. You can have basically the same cake, minus the jellied bits, by buying lemon cake mix, doubling the frosting and mixing in a bit of coconut. I make this "cheaters" RELee cake and no one ever notices the difference. It's a great adaptation if you're pressed for time (and who isn't!)

It's unusual to find a new cake recipe so good.  I've had this saved to my recipe box for, no joke, 10 years.  Finally tried it out this weekend for my MIL's birthday.  A real show-stopper.  Very special.  Not at all hard to make, although the zesting/juicing of all of those lemons/oranges took a lot of time.  Only modification: I thought it was strange that the cake recipe had no oil/fat in it.  I thought of how oil makes chiffon cakes so nice and tender, and added 1/3 cup canola oil to the batter.  Taste and texture of cake was superb.  I will make this again for a special occasion.  Thank you for sharing!

Cake is more like a sponge-cake than I was anticipating, but the lemon curd is AWESOME

Best cake ever. Enough said.   But to elaborate: The recipe is wonderful; the only change I made was to add more zest than was called for in all parts of the cake. I might try to convert this to a sheet cake for more common every-day use, but it was superb. Received rave reviews from my parents and my family, and I loved it. Thanks so much!!!

I have made this twice. First, as written and this time, due to time, I used store cake mix and the rest as written. I only made one batch of frosting, though I could have made more. Either way, as long as you add the 1/3 c. oil into the batter of the cake (if you're doing it as advertised), then it's just perfect.

Fabulous flavor and beautiful to look at but I would not make the cake portion of the recipe again. It was dry and had a texture more like a ladyfinger. The curd and the frosting were the best I ever tasted. I can't wait to use them on a more worthy cake.

I will never make this cake again. It took HOURS to make and the cake came out dry. I also stirred the lemon curd for a long time bc it didnt thicken and it thickened when i removed it. It was almost impossible to cut the cake into 4 pieces without it crumbling so I put the lemon curd in the middle and the entire cake slid off. I had to put it in the fridge with skewers, which dried the cake out even more. The flavor of the frosting was good, but I will never make this cake AGAIN.

It is imperative that you double the lemon curd to make this cake delicious.  It's a very good cake but really needs the extra lemon curd filling.

Fantastic cake! Instead of making the frosting in this recipe, I used the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting found elsewhere on this site.

I was excited to try this recipe because of the combination of lemon and coconut. Like other reviewers have said, this recipe does take some time. I think the prep time listed in an underestimation. I was a little concerned when I separated the layers because the cake did seem dry and bland, but once I poured the delicious lemon filling on and let it soak in, the cake had a great lemon flavor. Definitely let the cake sit a couple of hrs before serving. The cake does have a dense texture, and is not comparable to the texture of a boxed cake mix.  This was the main negative for me. The frosting is really sweet but tasty. For me, the best part is the filling which has a wonderful lemon flavor.

Delicious cake and icing. Definitely a bit labor intensive. Make sure not to overbeat the egg whites or the cake will  fall in the center as it cools.  I also had trouble with the lemon curd.  I was expecting it to thicken, like pudding as I was cooking it.  It never did, as a consequence I over cooked it and it ended up more like lemon jelly, rather than curd -still tart and delicious, bit not the right consistency.  Looking at other recipes perhaps a better stopping point is until it coats the back of a wooden spoon.  The frosting is delicious; the combination of orange, lemon and coconut was perfect for this cake.  I will definitely make this cake again, a bit wiser for the experience.

For the actual cake: I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have lemon zest... I found the cake to be dry and lacking the lemon flavor I was looking for. Why is it so difficult to find a good lemon cake recipe?! 
I did not try the frosting so cannot rate that, I did a lemon chocolate and was disappointed in the cake's outcome.
