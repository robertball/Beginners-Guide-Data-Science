This is a good, but very rich, waffle.  I don't know why some people have had problems with sogginess.  The recipe says to start with 1 cup of eggnog and then add more if you need it.  I added ad additional 1 Tbsp at a time and probably put in another 1/4 cup total to get the consistency I wanted.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I'd leave the cinnamon out next time.  I probably won't make this again because it was just too rich with the eggnog and raspberry jelly, but it's always fun to try new things!

I just used this recipe for the waffles - didn't use the raspberries at all.  Very yummy.  Everyone - including in-laws - enjoyed the waffles on Christmas morning!

Really Yummy! Not at all soggy as previous user stated - however you want to make sure that you only add the amount of eggnog needed to make the batter pourable. You may need a little less OR a Little more then recipe states.

I also added a touch of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.

I tried the recipe as is (just 1 cup of nog) for the first waffle.  I found there wasn't as much flavor as I would like.  So, I added some vanilla, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I must have added too much vanilla because then the waffles became soggy... so, I added 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder, which fixed the sogginess.  However, with everything put together (preserves, raspberries, and whipped cream) I still couldn't taste the eggnog flavor.

Creamy, delicious, rich (but not too much for my sensitive stomach). These waffles were absolutely wonderful, and will be a new Christmas morning tradition in our house. We used blackberries, and used plain yogurt instead of the whipped cream.

very good...but very sweet. I finally watered down the raspberry preserves to cut the sweet. I also think that this waffle does not come out like a belgian waffle texture to me, but maybe it was my method? Thanks for sharing.

Ended up pretty soggy, and dense. Not the fluffy crisp delight that it was described as. I think main culprit is that the amount of eggnog is way to much for the amount of flour in the recipe.

These were yummy! I didn't make the raspberry topping, the eggnog waffles were great! I did added a little cinnamon and nutmeg :)

Texture was okay but eggnog flavour didn’t really come through. Ended up adding a tablespoon of cinnamon and half a tablespoon of nutmeg. Didn’t make the topping. Made my own berry compote for that.

Very good.  I added 1 cup of eggnog and then gradually added more until I got the consistency I wanted.  I also threw in some vanilla and cinnamon.  Delicious.

Really good holiday waffle recipe to use the eggnog.  Eggnog adds a nice flavor to it.

I would give the texture five stars, but I punched up the flavor with added spices, thus the four star rating.  My waffle iron must be bigger than the original poster's, because I doubled the recipe and got eight waffles.  To the doubled flour, sugar and baking soda, I added 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Then I mixed the melted butter with the dry ingredients (and Alton Brown trick - looks weird, great results).  Finally I poured in two eggs mixed with two cups eggnog and a splash of vanilla.  After mixing, I added a bit more eggnog until the batter was thick but pourable.  Didn't have raspberries so I topped with real maple syrup and had a fun, Christmas flavored treat.
