Being Greek Orthodox I took al the shortcuts my mom does, add some buttter to the nut recipe then you dont have to butter so much between the Phillo, and u dont have to thaw the Phillo out all the way it handles better partially thawed, simmer your syrup for at least 2 hours

To echo someone earlier: This Is It.  I've been dreaming of this recipe since the first time I tasted baklava, homemade by my best friend's mom 13 years ago :) After many disappointments from other recipes and storebought baklava, this is the sweet stuff that I remember -- so if you don't like sweet, check out another recipe.  My tip: do NOT generously butter every single layer, or it'll end up dripping butter -- not the ideal baklava.  I'll try spray butter next, or every 2 layers. Mmm!

This was a wonderful recipe! A couple tips are, Make sure to keep the phyllo dough covered with a damp cloth, or it drys out. Also I took out 1/2 cup of the butter and 1/2 sugar and it was great. I don't think that it would be any better if I had put it all in. 
Thanks so much for the recipe! There's only one BIG problem with it... I CAN'T STOP EATING IT!!!:)

wow!! this is a great recipe. I had never worked with phyllo dough before and was scared, but it turned out okay! (just keep it covered with plastic wrap) I also did not brush every single layer with butter, just the top of each of the 4 (Although brushing the last couple layers would make it easier to cut).  I also subbed the almonds for 1/2 pecans, 1/2 walnuts and added a little cardamom to the nut mixture.

I am not known as a great cook but I certainly impressed my sister in laws with this one!  It was easier than I thought & turned out beautifully.  If I can make this, anyone can!

I made this recipe for my works christmas party, and now everyone wants the recipe.  It is not very hard to make, just real time consuming like CAMILLE_LT had stated before.  Thanks for the recipe Debbie.

Thanks so much for a great recipe! No Greek restaurant has yet come close, where we live at least, even if they say it's made there by Greeks, it's not nearly as good. This comes so close to what we had in Turkey! So tasty and syrupy! An added note...I made it for Thanksgiving, or so I thought, but the pan is empty! Just in case you don't have unsalted butter or almonds as I didn't, no one noticed that I used salted butter and walnuts which I normaly do. My one son and husband couldn't get enough of it. I'd give it more stars if possible. Thanks to  Stephanie suggesting the dough can be partially frozen, I'll try that next time.

Made this three times so far. My middle eastern friends couldn't get enough!  Many compliments!! Worth the time. Use spray margarine rather than melted butter and a pastry brush.

Good classic recipe.  Assume you will need ludicrous amounts of butter so brushing can be fast,  easy and not interrupted by scrambling to melt bore in the middle.  Also, a whole lemon worth of fine zest and a splash of almond extract in the honey syrup is good.  I think this recipe underestimates the time for simmering, as you need to stir constantly until it thickens or your arm falls off - (its worth it).  Finally, stay with me this sounds odd but trust me here: instead of just melted butter, if you use about one part high quality extra virgin olive oil for every for parts butter  it lends just a little Mediterranean savory kick to enhance the pistachios.

It was fairly easy and tasty.  I made just a tad bit extra syrup as a couple of the reviews said it was dry.  I was unsure if I was supposed to butter the top so I only brushed on a little.  Learn from my mistake and brush every other layer on top.  The top was a little too crisp and didn't stick to the rest of it.  It was still good, you just had to hold the top on.  I copied another reviewer and added a little brown sugar to the nut mixture.  Yum!

This was my first attempt at Baklava and it was way easier than I thought it would be. I used a combo of pecan and almonds for the nuts and it tasted great. I didn't quite use all of the sauce but at least I had enough. I plan on making this frequently now that I have this recipe!

I was very nervous working with the phyllo dough, it is so delicate. This recipe was very easy to follow, i just wished I had followed it more closely...  :) That being said, you have to remember how many layers you have put down. Also, don't use too many nuts... I unfortunately added too many nuts :(  I had a variety of nuts almonds, walnuts and pecans...again too many. Oh well, it did have a good flavor, just too many nuts...one more thing, i took out 1 cup of sugar, because you are already adding 1 cup of honey. It was ok with, that but next time, I might go with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 cup of honey and see how that goes... good luck...  :)

I made this 2 christmases ago and was talking about making it again. People who I didn't even know who tried it that night remember it and tell me how good it was, still. I tried Baklava in 2003 and I didn't know where I could buy it until I found this recipe, I can marinate in the yummyness of this treat. That night 2 years ago, it was gone before I could grab a piece.

This was my 1st attempt at making baklava. I already had nuts hanging around the kitchen, so, I decided to mix the almonds with pistachios. I didn't have the 1 1/2 lbs this recipe called for, so, I used half the amount. ( 4oz almonds and 4 oz pistachios and it was enough to do 6 layers using 1/3 of a cup mixture between each ) I also put them into a coffee grinder for almost a ''coffee grind'' texture. The only other small thing I had to change was the lemon. I didn't have any fresh lemon, so, I just put a few dashes into the syrup. It's a long process, but, it was worth every minute!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and plan on making it again for Christmas. It's a little time consuming, but very easy. My kids did most the work and had fun while making it. But the best part was eating it! It is sooo yummy! I made a few changes to meet our tastes, I used pecans instead of almonds, and omitted the cloves (I hate cloves). I'm sure it would be great with other kinds nuts if you like them better. A very good recipe.

This was Great!!  We made it in a little assembly line with 3 people, it was lots of fun to do.  I cut back a little on the syrup that is poured over the top, and I used walnuts, and less than the recipe says to (Im not a huge nut fan).  This was a great recipe, and really lots of fun to make!  Thank you!

Wonderful!  This was my first time ever using phyllo dough, and what a pain to work with!  But this recipe is great and it was a huge success.  I made this for work and let my co-workers be the guinea pigs.  They all raved about it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  A little moist, but I was told by every one at work that that was the way they liked it and not to change a thing.

ditto on too much nuts.  used mostly honey and a little water and no sugar.  This is just cuz I have lots of honey from the hive that I wanted to use.  It turned out pretty good.  3 cups honey + 1ish cup water.

I like this recipe because it has more syrup than others do and because of the amount of honey-taste that comes through.  I always need a bit more butter than recipe calls for; I butter every sheet.  I don't have a scale but use 4 cups of nuts that I then chop up - some fine, others a bit bigger for better "mouth feel".  A mixture of walnuts, pistachios and almonds is interesting. When making, I cover the filo with the plastic sheet it's wrapped in and then use a towel on top - works fine. Today I poured cold syrup over hat baklava; I'll next try hot syrup over cold baklava.  I added orange peel to the syrup - about 1/3 of the orange - hubby wants more next time. Spices for the nut mixture were cinnamon, allspice and a touch of nutmeg.  My only caveat is on the syrup - don't turn your back on it or it can boil over very fast. It is better on day 2-3 after flavors blend.

Baklava proved to be tedious but kind of fun to make. The result was WONDERFUL! Took it to a party with friends and it was a hit. I didn't use all of the syrup, about 3/4 and it came out just right.

This came out terrific!  A little time-consuming, but all in all, pretty easy l make.  I had no cinnamon sticks so left it out, using only the cinnamon mixed in with the nuts.  I'm not sure if it was a typo, but we had about 3/4# of nuts left over  even though we used ? cup on each layer as instructed.  I also only used about ½-?'s of the simple syrup that is poured over it at the end, and think it was perfect that way.  Thanks for so much for this wonderful recipe...so many compliments!

This recipe is really close to the one I once got from my Greek landlady.  I use pecans instead of almonds, since I have so many pecan trees in my yard.  I also use brown sugar to mix with the nuts for layering, for a richer baklava.
