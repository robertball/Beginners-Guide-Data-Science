This was very good but when you mix sour cream, ground beef, and cheese together always turns out looking like brown goop on the plate. But family loved the flavor. And used chips to eat it with...  this would work great as a dip for a big party.  So I rated it on flavor not looks.

This recipe is one of my all time favorites! Unlike almost every person that had rated this recipe. I made it as is! I would not change a single thing about it! Don't be afraid of the miracle whip in it. It compliments all the other ingredients to come together to make one tasty casserole! Just because a certain ingredient in it doesn't sound good, don't be afraid to try it. I was a little worried about the salad dressing too when I made it, but just went with it, and was glad I did! I wouldn't recommend substituting it with yogurt or sour cream. The zing of the salad dressing is what makes this dish delicious! Try it as it was written, chances are you will love it!!

I like Mexican food, so I found this to be good.  My family wasn't quite as thrilled, but they found it OK.

I add about 1/2 medium onion to the ground beef (venison is great). I also add one cup of Minute rice and I one cup salsa to the corn and bean mixture. Just bachelors here but usually only serves myself, son and grandson.

Great basics but rather bland. Get creative with it and add more flavor and it tastes great. i.e. garlic, onion, peppers, spices, etc even just taco seasoning.

basic recipe is good but our family is into spicy do I made a few changes.  I used a pound of hamburger and added 1/4 pound of chorizo.  The store did not have a can of mexicorn  so  put in frozen corn with Mexican spices. Thawed it first.

Instead of sourcream I used cream  cheese because I didnt have any handy at the  moment . So  i melted the cream cheese and it was quite tasty!

I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and had good flavor though a little on the bland side. The next time I make this I will tweak it a little to give it a little kick being we like our food spicy.
