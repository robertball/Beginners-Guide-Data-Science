Ok. I made this wonderful dish without the sauce. I made the filling (cranberries, boiling water, cinnamon, cloves, brown sugar--I omitted pine nuts), and I'll tell you, in my personal opinion, that was enough sauce for the whole dish. It came out EXCELLENT. My momma couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was and I was just pleased as punch with the outcome. The sweet spiciness of the cranberries contrasted perfectly with the saltiness of the pork chop. Next time I will be sure to use less cloves--for they pack a powerful punch. Perhaps 1/4  tsp instead of half.  Now, keep in mind even though I omitted the sauce I was only making two chops. So if you are cooking for four and choose to omit the sauce you MUST double the cranberry filling. When the pork chops finished cooking I made a small bed of the cranberry filling on a plate, laid the chop on it, and lastly dabbled a little cranberry filling on top of the pork chop.   Now from my experience, the side I used was a twice baked stuffed potato--with sour cream, bacon, chives, and gouda. It contrasted PERFECTLY. Some of my potato mixed in with the cranberry filling and they were two perfect matches. Im serious about this people! I'm not gonna lead yall astray here!  Lastly I had a side salad with a basic head of lettuce, all natural balsalmic vinagrette and homeade croutons. The salad, however you may choose to make it, added an outstanding crunch to the whole meal.  I couldn't finish my plate and I was sad :(

Very time consuming recipe, but well worth it! I also only made two pork chops, but that worked out nicely because we enjoyed having more of the cranberry filling to put on top of the chops. I made the sauce but we really didn't use it, the next time I make these, which I will be for sure, I will not be making the sauce. It came out runny for me and did not add tons of flavor, so I will just leave it out next time. Overall, awesome recipe! I will definitely be making it again!

This meal was simple, experimental and exceptionally tastey! I used sage instead of cloves and that mixed perfectly with the flavor of the cranberry. It was lightly sweet, unlike the normal cranberry tanginess. In the future I might add in more pine nut, I feel that would take out some of the sweetness and add a more savory feel! I would absolutely recommend this recipe!!

This is the best stuffed pork chop I have ever eaten.  I have often searched for a pork chop recipe that would flavor the pork and this one does just that.  A wonderful culinary experience.  My family loves it.

We loved this.  I did not have pine nuts so I just omitted them but I did add a little goat cheese to the stuffing.  I think it gave it a great flavor and was a good contrast to the sweet cranberries.  I also did not take the time to make the sauce but instead made a little extra stuffing, heated it through and served on top.  I will be making this one again.

Unfortunately, we didn`t like this dish at all. I can`t believe I wasted time and good and not cheap ingredients making this. The chops were absolutely tasteless. The recipe makes too much cranberry sauce which is too watery, not salty and really lack of flavor. The sauce uses too much chicken stock that "kills" other ingredients. The final sauce tastes like chicken stock coloured and a little flavored with red wine. 1 cup of the sauce is too much, the meat soaks and loses its flavor and we didn`t like that after baking the meat wasn`t baked, but was boiled. This cooking process made the meat tasteless and not tasty. The cranberry filling itself is delicious, but it doesn`t make the whole dish with the meat. Sorry, but we were really upset and disappointed with this stuff.

These were delicious and easy!  I used thick center cut pork chops.  The needed to bake about 15 minutes before they were done.  I will definitely make this one again.

A-MAZ-ING!!!This is my first time rating a recipe... and it's because this was so good.  Would be a great holiday tradition meal, but good anytime.  I had no pine nuts, so I substituted with chopped almonds.

I followed this recipe exactly, which is not my normal MO. This was so gross to me that I wouldnâ€™t eat more than the one bite. Allowed kids to kick it to the curb as well. My it

Super!! Agreed with others that sauce not needed. Only other change I made was with cloves. Did half cloves and just a little more than half sage. Took the other reviewers advice and served stuffed baked potatoes. One of very few recipes that everyone in our family loved!

Great flavor... I did not use any wine but replaced the wine with more chicken stock and a little more cranberry juice in the sauce... Very tasty.
