Great taste.  I used soy milk instead of the evaporated milk, and changed the 2 1/2 cups sugar to 2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup pear butter, because I thought that the sugar amount was more than I wanted to deal with!  The amount of filling was enough for 2 pies rather than one with a top crust!  I baked the pies at 350 for 1 hr. 10 mins.

I grew up eating and loving bean pies, so it's great to finally have a recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of 2 1/2. I didn't have a food processor so I put the ingredients in a blender instead. The tops of both of my pie crusts burned a little bit, so when I try this again, I think I will follow the advice of a couple other reviewers and bake at 350 for an 1:10. My pies didn't have the deep, dark color that I was expecting (they were light tan). However, the taste was still good. The secret, I found, was letting the pies refrigerate overnight. By the next day, their color had deepened AND the flavors seemed even richer and tastier than they'd been the day before. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! It's definitely going to become a regular in my house!

Nice pie. Not to be nit-picky, but this is a traditional African-American muslim bean pie. I would substitute a homemade crust for the ready-made crust to keep with the tradition and roots of this dish. An additional of brown sugar with the white sugar would result in a richer, darker color and taste. Additionally, make sure to use a vanilla extract that does not contain alcohol! Well done.

This was my first time attempting to make a bean pie, and it went very well! I made a few adjustments to the recipe as written. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1.5 cups of dark brown. I only used a half teaspoon of nutmeg. I used 3 teaspoons of vanilla rather than 2. I used 3 eggs and 2 yolks rather than 2 eggs and 2 yolks.I used a blender rather than a food processor. I baked on 350 the entire time rather than switching temps. The recipe makes 2 pies.

I've always wanted to make Bean Pies for my family and your recipe made it possible. It was quick and easy. However I didn't use as much sugar the 2nd time I made them but they came out great.

Delicious!! I have made this about 10 times now. My husband loves them. I actually use 3 cans of beans now and increse all the other ingredients accordingly because I like my pie crust to be full to the brim. I then also have to ccok it a little longer. We use to get bean pies in the city of Baltimore but we now live an hour away so I was looking to try to make my own and this recipe is perfect. People think a "bean pie" does not sound like it would be good and are always pleasanytly surprised when they try it. I usually say it is similar to a sweet potato pie. If you like sweet potato pie you will probably like this recipe. Great with a little whipped cream or cool whip. Thanks for posting.

Great pie!  I randomly tried making this after browsing for a 5 star recipe that was different from anything else I'd ever made and was very impressed with it!  It's quite delicious.

This recipe is delicious.  I didn't find any canned navy beans so I used black beans and it still was great! I followed the directions and cooked it at 450 for 15 then cut back to 350 for 35 and I don't like the way it browns the top. The 2nd time I tried this, I used navy beans soaked overnight - but they were still too hard and the pie had great flavor, but not the right consistency. My 3rd try, I will find the canned navy (somewhere) and cook for 350 at 1 hr 10 min (as suggested by another member) and I'll let you know how that goes.

This pie tasted great, we ate it all up, but it looked pale instead of golden brown. I used Walmart ,great value great northern beans, the only ones I could find that were not seasoned. Should I use a differant bean? Maybe I should have put them on the top oven rack. Nevertheless, this is a dynamite pie, and I used the full amount of sugar. I wonder if folding the eggs into the batter would make it creamier? Someone please respond...

I am not sure what I was really expecting taste-wise, but this was not a very good tasting dish at all. The texture is heavy and dense, the flavor far too bean-y. Won't make it again.

Thank you Jolli for sharing this recipe. I have been looking for a bean pie recipe for years that was similar to the taste that I grew up with. This is nostalgic because this taste exactly the way I remember it way back in the 70's.

Made these and everyone loved it. The first time I made them as is and everyone loved them, but the second time I made them I only added two cups of sugar and they were still great. My children don't care for beans, but they are this no problem.

I followed the recipe to my personal taste. I like pretty much all my pies sweet except pies with meat or without berries. When I made this I followed the recipe I found but added more vanilla, sugar, butter, and even added brown sugar to the recipe.  What I got was so scrumptious before I put it in the oven...I was so excited.  Now I have the pie setting and cooling off. I made this pie from scratch. The crust was from flour, brown sugar, and butter. Wow! This crust is so good! I'm excited about this pie. Oh and I soaked the beans over night. Then I got a huge cheesecloth and cover the inside pot with the cloth. I then put the beans in the middle and folded the cheesecloth. I poured water around the inside of the pot and boiled the beans for a few hours. I smashed the beans a few times. Having the cheesecloth prevented the beans from burning and it kept the beans moist. I would recommend using cheesecloth.

My very first time making this recipe and very first time tasting a bean pie!! I followed this recipe almost to a T. I only used 1 3/4 cups of sugar, I used dried great northern beans (let them soak all day), I used a premade graham cracker crust, and I used my vitamix. It was so creamy and sweet and delicious!! Would never be able to tell I used beans, because it does not taste like beans at all. I love the cinnamony taste!! Excellent recipe!!

This was a great recipe! I agree with  others 2 1/2 cups of sugar is too much. Next time I'll drop a 1/4 or 1/2 cup. I also used a blender after I used a potato masher first. As others have said, they were tan in color but, I turned the oven on 400 for the last 20 mins and they were nice and brown. The next time I will cook on 350 for the hour and ten mins as suggested. One person was correct, after refrigerated over night, they taste better and the color is  then the rich brown we're used to. So easy!   I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

I grew up eating bean pie so I am a very tough critic.  I changed some aspects of the recipe which I will not give away my secrets here (Ha!).  I did not have Navy beans but the pinto beans I used worked out great.  Thank you for sharing this.

Have been following and experimenting with this recipe for a few years now. And have had excellent results. It's ironic, after all these years I'm still introducing people to the Bean Pie. Most have heard of it but not tried it. I'm winning a few new converts. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  All who tried it, loved it.  I did make a couple of mistakes; I also did not have nutmeg.  My food processor has a liquid fill line and the evaporated milk was too much.  I forgot to add it later and I forgot to put the flour.  I did come out scrumptious but, I will not forget the rest the next time.  Just a note this will not be creamy like a pumpkin pie. The texture is like none other and the flavor is amazing.

Fabulous recipe! I shared the bean filling at a shared meal [with no crust]. Looked country-style baked, was light tasting, [I added a cake frosting to appear more dessert like.]

Super Easy-tasty and satisfying. The only adjustment I made was that I went a little lighter on the sugar using 1 1/2 cups instead of the amount prescribed still turned out great! This is a keeper!

Bean pies have been a favorite of mine for years. I would try changing the amount of sugar to 2 cups instead of the 2 1/2 cups.

I like that this recipe was very easy ( aside from soaking andcooking beans). It tasted ok,a bit beany but  I should have expected that.I likedthat I didn't have to dirty a bowl. Next time I make this, I may add more evaporated milk and turn th heat down. My crust edges  burned and the  pie was a little dry or not. I've never had bean pie so I d on't know what it should taste like.

I love this recipe I also added a pinch of Ginger and a touch of lemon extract when it was done I topped it with whipped cream sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar.  I have also cut the recipe in half and baking a graham cracker crust and it came out fabulous!! this also works well with Great Northern beans if you use a graham cracker crust make sure to cut the cooking time in half as well and watch closely they cook pretty fast!!!!!??

I made this today and it is divine. The only change I made was to substitute 1 cup of dark brown sugar for one of the cups of sugar. I also used a vanilla wafers pie crust. This recipe is a keeper

This is by no means a bean pie.  I grew up eating bean pie after service every Sunday afternoon, purchased directly from the brothers at the Nation of Islam. This pie has minimal flavor, is not dense enough to be bean pie, and unfortunately the recipe makes two pies that I had to toss into the trash.  I will keep looking for the actual bean pie recipe or create one myself.  This recipe was extremely disappointing given the 5 start rating that it has. What a waste of ingredients.

No fail is correct! Even with a few substitutions, this pie is great. I made the following substitutions out of necessity: I used pinto beans instead of navy beans, just over two cups of light brown sugar instead of white, and vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla extract. Everyone asked for 2nds. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I just brought it out the oven. It smells great. I haven't tasted it yet but I will update once I have. The difference in the ones that I know from muslims in New Jersey, is that the color is darker. The darker color looks more appealing to me. If anyone has any ideas let me know.

To call this a traditional Muslim dish, it might be best to specify the vanilla extract must be alcohol free. That said, I made this as directed and with the frozen pie crusts in the foil pans. I think the bean mixture could have used twice as much time in the food processor (I kept getting bits of bean skin that was texturally distracting) and they got rather dark  after the first 15 minutes at 450. I would suggest that you bake in the bottom third of the oven or use a pie shield/foil wrap the crust. The pie has a nice flavor and a very curious texture.

I love bean pie.  I grew up on it.  Then I learned how to make it myself. I use brown sugar instead of white. Almond milk instead on caned. 4 whole eggs. It's always delishious but..... I always get this really shinny film on top after a few hours. Although this doesn't take away from the taste. It does take away the beauty  of the pie. How can I get ride of this shinny wet film?....... Pleeeeease.

Thanks, Jolli, for a great recipe. I have made two batches and everyone loves the bean pies. I did cut the sugar back to two cups, other than that, followed to the letter with a perfect outcome.
I have people squeeling for more.

I was craving a bean pie. So I  decided to see if Allrecipes had this recipe. To my surprise, it was here. So I decided to make this bean pie from scratch. (I need to work on making pie crusts though.) LOL.  I didn't have navy beans so I substituted northern white beans instead. Other than the beans, I stayed with the original recipe. The recipe came out great. Many thanks to the author for putting this recipe together.

I made mine with dried beans and cooked them on the stove instead of using canned beans. Next time I will need to make sure that I keep my food processor blending for a longer period of time so as to make sure the beans are fully pureed.

Taste was interesting, not objectionable, but a little bland or flat. (Beans used in this way aren't as exciting as baked beans with brown sugar & bacon.) Flavor could be enhanced with addition of 1 cup pureed coconut(sweetened) per pie. I cut the recipe in half for one pie, which worked out fine. I'm glad I tried this recipe.

It was a little too sweet so I would do 2 1/4 cups of sugar next time. I also added 1 teaspoon of Almond Extract.

Great recipe! I recommend running the beans through a fine mesh strainer to help remove the skins after purée. Or removing the skins before purée

Loved it. Shared it with the men of the family, and some of their friends. They loved it. Of course I added a pinch more of this and that for a little more flavor. I have made them weekly around holiday time and plan to make them again this year.

I didn't realize I was low on sugar, so I used both white and brown. I also couldn't find Navy beans at whole foods, so I used great white beans. Tasted a little "beanier" than if I would have found the correct type, but it was very delicious and reminds me of when my mom was on a nation of Islam kick after my father walked out on us. Weird memory, great recipe!

I made one pie and didn’t change a thing and it was DELICIOUS!!!  My fiancé loved it and said it’s better than the usual sweet potato pie I make.  This is going in my personal cookbook and thank you so much for sharing.  I wish I could add more stars!

This recipe is fantastic.  A nice change of pace for dessert, and very easy to make.  Will make again for holidays and special occasions when I want to know for sure I’m bringing something different to the dinner table for family get-togethers.

This is my first time I made the Traditional Navy Bean Pie that I was introduced to by the SiStars of the Nation of Islam. I made mine without crust to save myself some calories because I am calorie counting. 

This recipe from allrecipes.com Called "No Fail Bean Pie" says that it is 539 calories per serving but I made mine without crust. I save myself 108 calories. 431 for a healthy treat!

The recipe calls for 2 Tbs of Vanilla - I substituted 1 of those Tbs with 1 Tbs of Maple syrup. I also substituted the canned Navy bean for dried beans which I soaked for a few days. I also made evaporated milk from a powder form.

It tastes close to what I'm used to in a bean pie. Although, I would like a creamier texture.

I broke the last blender we had right in the middle of making this recipe! .

So if anyone has a food processor or heavy duty blender that that don't Love anymore I'll Love to have One. PLEASE aaaaand Thank You!

This was really really good. I did replace a cup of regular sugar with brown sugar to get a darker color to the pie. I haven't had bean pie in about 7 years and couldn't find the lady at the mosque who was baking them so I'm ecstatic that now I can bake my own!

The first time I made it-(bean pie)- we used pinto in the bing and it was quite tasty. I've been home now 16 yrs to the day and have yet to find anyone to make it. So in 2011 thanksgiving, I followed your recipe with a tweak on the sugar and surprised all who had the pleasure of tasting. So it is only fitting that I celebrate my sweet 16th year home (without interruption or further adieu), with grilled Cornish hens and Bean pie. Y'ALL BE COOL!!!

I altered it a bit, I used 1 1/2 cup of granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, I used 4 eggs and baked both pies at 350 degrees for 1 hour (I also had extra filling  left. This recipe is absolutely amazing and I've never had bean pie before.

This was a perfect bean pie.  I was raised a Muslim and my mom made bean pie for years. She's elderly now and I wanted to surprise her by making it all on my own.  The recipe was an easy follow.  I used pre-prepared vegetable shortening crust. The only thing I changed was instead of using canned beans, I used fresh beans from the farmers market, and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  I will definitely make again!

It turned out delicious. I only did the 2 cups of sugar also. It taste like the ones from the muslim restaurant.

I added an extra cup of sugar and tablespoon of vanilla extract the 2nd time I made it, and it tastes more like what I usually get from Mohammed's restaurant (Detroit). Mmmmmmm! I love bean pie!

My boyfriend is allergic to pumpkin so unfortunately I have never been able to introduce him to Pumpkin pie.  This tasted similar and he loved it.  I took someone else's suggestion and used brown sugar and cut the measurement a bit and it was perfect.  Thanks so much for this :)

Great recipe, I made adjustments down to 2 cups of organic sugar and 2 eggs only no extra yolks. I added 1 tsp of molasses and used graham cracker crusts, Yum!

I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with 2 excellent pies with a unique consistency. Reminds me of a sugar cream with better texture.
