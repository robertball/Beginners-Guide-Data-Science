A very nice side dish!  As there were only two cups of steamed rice involved, I only used 1/4 lb of low salt bacon, NO added salt, low sodium soy sauce and a whole bunch of green onions.  Drained the bacon on paper towels.  Also added 1/4 cup of julienned carrots for extra crunch.  Easy and very tasty.
