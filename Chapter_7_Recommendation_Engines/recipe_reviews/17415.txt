I have been making this recipe for years having gotten the recipe from my friend Susan (awesome cook!!).  It's one of my most popular cheesecakes--and I make lots of them!  I garnish with drizzles of chocolate ganache.  It's important to add a bit more than just one package of the gelatin--I dissolve about 1 1/3 pkg. of gelatin in the 1/2 C. of cold water.    I also make my crust with 15 graham crackers, 1/4 cup of sugar, mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter.  I bake the crust at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, then allow it to cool before putting the Amaretto Mousse in.  Soooo light and yummy!

I've been making this exact recipe for over 10 years and get numerous requests for it.  My favorite way to dress this up for the holidays is to cut pirouette cookies in half and place them around the cheesecake.  Then I tie a wire ribbon around the cookies.  A little chocolate drizzle on the top and you have a show stopper of a dessert!

I made this for our ladies Bunco night, and everyone loved it! I dressed it up by adding sliced almonds, fresh raspberries and a drizzle of chocolate on top. It turned out gorgeous! Other than the additional toppings, the only other change I made was to use 1-1/3 pkgs of the unflavored gelatin, as recommended by another reviewer. Not sure how it would have been with just the 1 package, but I can say that the firmness was spot on using the 1-1/3 pkgs. One of my friends said it was the best cheesecake she has ever eaten!

I did not care for this recipe. Not much better than a Sara Lee frozen cake.

This was beautifully creamy with a delicious Amaretto flavor.  I made this recipe in individual portions for ease in serving.  Because I was going to cover them in a chocolate mirror glaze, I added a little sugar to the crust and baked it for 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven to set the crust.   I froze the individual cheesecakes overnight so they would be frozen solid before pouring the chocolate mirror glaze over them.  I baked a few almonds to release the oils and then chopped them very finely to decorate the bottom edge of each cheesecake.  They came out just as I had hoped.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever made! As suggested by another review,  I did add a little more gelatin powder, but that was it for changes. It was creamy, yet  light and absolutely delicious - I'm making it again this week for my husband's office.

I have to say, this recipe was a hit.  I made it for New Year's eve and everyone love it.  Thinking about making this again for Valentines Day.

Really liked this, even though I used sugar substitutes. I also made a low carb crust using almond flour and a few drops of  a liquid sweetener. The whole family asked me to make it again soon. Delicious!!!

I have made this several times receiving many compliments. Instead of making the graham cracker crust, I use 2 prepared graham cracker pie crusts. Less work, same great taste.
