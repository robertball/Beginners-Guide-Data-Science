Unique and tasty.  I was skeptical about Romaine lettuce being included but it worked out well.

This was wonderful. I made the liquid mixture and browned the rice early in the day & served it with shrimp enchiladas suizas.

I rinsed my rice thoroughly but it still was a bit gummy. I still loved it and will make it again.

Deceptively simple but AMAZING. I subbed out the rest of a jar of salsa verde for the tomatillos and it turned out wonderful. The only issue is cooking time; it came out rather watery and I needed to cook it longer, which made the rice pop. Not a perfect texture, but still very good.

Love the flavor combo. The only thing I will do differently next time is that I will rinse my rice. It got a bit gummy from the starch.
