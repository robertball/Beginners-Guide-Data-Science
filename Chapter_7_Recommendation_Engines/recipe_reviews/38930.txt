Moist and delicious muffins!

Made the following alterations to the recipe:  1.  Did not use the dry milk.  (Didn't have it on hand.)
2.  Used raisin bran instead of plain bran.  (I like the combination of raisins and apples.)
3.  Added one tablespoon of flax seed for body and nutrition.

My family loved these.

This is a great recipe for those that don't like an overly sweet breakfast.  I used granny smith apples and they were great.  It's a wonderful breakfast when you're in a hurry.

Muffins were a bit dry and bland.  Perhaps because I
did not use a bran cereal with sugar.

Wonderful breakfast muffins!  I wanted a muffin that was high in fiber, low in fat, easy to make, not too sweet, and delicious.  These muffins fit the bill perfectly!  I freeze these muffins and eat one in the morning during the week (instead of eating nutri-grain bars that are loaded with sugar).  Tips:  grate a large granny-smith apple instead of chopping it (you can keep the skin on this way and it is just as fast as chopping), add more cinnamon and some ground cloves for spice, and add some Splenda or raisins if you want your muffins sweeter.  Enjoy!

Wonderful breakfast muffins! I prefer mine a little sweeter, so I added 1/2 cup sugar and they came out delicious.

The batter was very dry. The muffins came out dry too. A note should be added to say sift the flower. They weren't sweet enough for my taste and I made 24 of them.

Tried this recipe twice, exactly as written and both times muffins were tiny and very heavy.  Tasted great but looked horrible!

The batter was dry and muffins were not fluffy.
