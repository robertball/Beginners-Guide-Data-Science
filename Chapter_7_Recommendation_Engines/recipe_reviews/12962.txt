More of a very rich drink than a soup. I would cut down significantly on the cream to reduce the fat and increase the flavor.

It tasted like a regular cup of cocoa, except a bit richer because of the cream. The flavour wasn't as nice as I'd liked. It was okay.

I think this was so neat!  I made it for myself, because I had one heck of a sweet tooth.  I didn't use as much cream as it called for.  The trick to this is eating it right off the stove.. I also used Graham Crackers to eat with it.  I am sure any child would love this... However it is very sweet/rich I found myself eating about 2 or 3 bites.. and then a while later going back for more... Very unique recipe!

Maybe mine didn't thicken like everyone elses, but it wasn't thick, it wasn't thin. Just right. The flavor is well worth the 5 minutes it takes to cook. This is much better than packet cocoa. I'll use this again and again!

It was ok.  A little thick, I would rather just make up some hot chocolate from a mix.

I think the best thing to do with this recipie (which is virtually identical to mine from years ago) is to add a liqour like chambord or beucaunt, etc to ad a hint of flavor.

I would describe this as a nice cup of creamy homemade hot chocolate. 2 tablespoons of sugar would have been too sweet for me ... I used 1 tablespoon and thought it was perfect. Use your judgement when making it for yourself. The heavy cream makes it rich and extra creamy. You can mix the dry ingredients in the saucepan, add a little of the milk and cream blend and mix with a whisk till it is well blended then add the rest and heat till desired warmth.
