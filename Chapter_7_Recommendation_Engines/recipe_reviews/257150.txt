OK, the lard is IT. I could wax poetic about the interesting way lard can take heat (medium high), the wonderful smell while frying, the insane flavor of the refried beans, and on and on... I followed this verbatim and usually I use recipes as more of an 'idea'. So, having had lots of homemade refried beans, let me say that these are spot-on. I do love Chef John's recipes. Bravo!!

These were by far the best refried beans ever. I will never eat them from a can again. Chef John is my new cooking guru.

These beans turned out so yummy! I used bacon fat I had stored because my store didn't have lard. Online people said bacon fat works so I went for it, not disappointed at all. I want to say this is either the 6th or 7th recipe of Chef Johns I have tried, not a single one has been disappointing, they've all been great so far. Got so many more to try next.

It's personal, but for my next batch I'll probably drop to one Serrano instead of two.  Of course, the Serrano's I bought we're rather large.  Excellent and easy recipe.  I doubt we'll ever eat canned again.  I cooked the beans in a pressure cooker, so I didn't need to soak them overnight and it only took 45 minutes to cook the beans.  I highly recommend a pressure cooker.  My wife is still raving about how delicious this recipe is.

I have been trying to make beans for 10 years and they have been so so.  I stumbled on to this recipe and tried it and it is to die for.  It has to be the lard that makes the beans so good.  I have made this according to the recipe and once I used green chiles and it was just as good.  I would rate this 10 stars if I could.

Excellent refried bean recipe! I made this for a trip to the family ranch with my parents, siblings, their husbands, and kids. Everyone loved them.  The only thing I changed was the amount of diced Serrano peppers. My husband and my sister can't handle the heat. Despite that, they were still quite warm. But very tasty.

Wayyyy better than the canned stuff, and super easy. I love homemade options over store bought. After we ate dinner I froze smaller portions for future taco nights, nachos, or whatever we may want received beans for. I love chef John's recipes, keep up the good work.

These are delicious.  SO much better than store bought canned beans. I have also made these in an instapot with  
4 1/2 c water on the bean setting.  You must use lard as others have stated. It's what makes them tasty.

These are the real deal. They also freeze well, so I make a batch and freeze some to use for burritos and wavos rancheros.

I made some changes to suit my taste- I was able to obtain fresh epazote and I put a quartered onion in with the boiling beans, both of which I strained out of the water at the end.  I then used jalapenos in the lard 'cause I didn't want that much heat; perhaps I needn't have worried, but I loved the result.

We spent a year in Mexico on our sailboat and when we returned to the US I had more or less given up on getting the excellent refried beans we had enjoyed so much south of the border.  I just kept trying to doctor up canned refried beans from Costco. 

I should have known better.  Any refried beans that advertise themselves to be fat free sort of miss the point.  

When I looked at Chef John's recipe it looked like a lot of work but it was a rainy Sunday so I persevered.  Fortunately I had some manteca (lard) on hand because I was planning on making some tamales.

These beans are  absolutely incredible and as good as we had in Mexico.  They are not as much work as I anticipated but you do end up with a lot of beans.  I am trying to freeze some in vacuum sealed bags.  If that does not work Ill pressure can them.

Absolutely perfect! Almost identical to my mother's recipe. Lard or (as I prefer), bacon grease IS critical. Also if you like them a little "cheesey" flavored, add a bit of buttermilk in place of the liquid while mashing the beans. A staple on our table. I also use these in our taco meat to hold everything together. Now I'm hungry!??

I live in South Texas on the Rio Grande and this recipe rocks! I cooked the soaked beans in the crockpot for 3 hours on high and one hour on low.  (Rinse the soaked beans well before putting in the crock pot to get rid of, well you know, gas).
I like a coarse mash with some texture, but still needed to add some reserved bean cooking “liquor”. Use an immersion blender for a creamier product.  Top with finely chopped green or white onion and serve - delicious!

These were so good! I used black beans and leftover bacon grease rather than lard but it was still just. Really good. For myself I would reduce the amount of grease/lard from 1/2 a cup to 6 Tbsp because it was a little too much for me. I would also recommend cutting the initial salt in half to 1 teaspoon and then going by taste from there. You may end up adding the same amount but for myself I have a lower salt preference and so the original starting amount was too high for me.

THIS!  I followed the recipe exactly. We absolutely LOVED these refried beans! They were even better heated up! They weren't spicy, just had a wonderful flavor.

If you save some for leftovers, save the extra liquid and add a little each time you heat some up.

Way to go Chef John!

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of making it in the instant pot. I sautéed the onions, pepper and garlic in the lard, added the rest of the ingredients and cooked 35 minutes--High pressure, Natural release. They are so tasty! I think it's all that lard.

I made mine with pork broth from when I boiled ribs for dinner the night before (saves time in the oven and makes them really tender). Came out yummy. I tried using Crisco this time because I didn't want to buy a huge thing of lard and thought the pork broth would make up in flavor. They were a little salty, but I think it was from all the salt in the broth. I think I did a pretty good job for a first attempt making refried beans and also not following the recipe to the T. Next time I would like to try with lard and follow the recipe exactly. I'll update my review again when that happens.

Great refried beans! Only changes I made were cooked beans in a pressure cooker and sometimes adjusting spice to accommodate my young kids.

I will make this again. Because I live in a country where lard is not obtainable, I used something similar to Crisco and I thought it worked just fine but one day when I am back in the states I will definitely try it with lard. And because of a time crunch between finding this recipe and having to make the dish for a Christmas celebration, I used canned black beans. I could obtain only jalapeno peppers here and they substituted well. To make up for the lack of taste from lard it did add extra onion and garlic

I didn't have epazote, nor the serrano chili peppers, so I had to do without, but it was still amazing!! We love these beans, and will never go back to canned refried beans again!

What can I say?? Listen to Chef John. The man will not steer you wrong. This is not diet food people. This is traditional cooking! IMO, portion control of good food is better than bucketloads of healthy food.

This was really good, I did add in some chicken stock and 2 slices of crumbled bacon.
