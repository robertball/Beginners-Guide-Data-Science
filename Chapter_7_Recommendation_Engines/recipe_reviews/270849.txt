Overall this is a pretty good meal! I also used kidney beans in place of cannellini, and added a bit of chile in adobo sauce for some heat. Topped with white cheddar and green onions, and it tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this.  Double the chili mix but not the cornbread. I also used green pepper instead of celery.

I loved this recipe but I did make a few changes. I used a pound of lean ground beef instead of turkey. I used light red kidney beans and a can of Brooks Chili Hot Beans. I took what others said and used 2 eggs and 2\3 cups of milk. I topped it with a Mexican cheese blend. Everyone loved it. I will make this again.

I agree with the reviewer who suggested the milk and egg proportions were wrong when using two boxes of corn bread mix; they should be doubled. Otherwise we really enjoyed this dish. It is easily adaptable to individual tastes by using other spices, beans, or even some salsa in place  of some of the tomato sauce. I made half a recipe in an 8" square dish and there were nine generous servings. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I accidentally added a can of tomatoes with juice thinking it was tomato sauce but I just cooked it on the stove top a little longer to get some of the juice to cook down. I was concerned the cornbread wouldn’t bake well but it all came out delicious!  This is a keeper in our house. We will be having this again.

Only change was I added some chopped green onion. I dislike when people change recipes. We had some that were getting old, so I figured why not. Great Recipe,  Great for hungry meat lovers. Great Chili, without all the work. Thanks

My family really like this and asked that I make it again.  I would add some additional liquid to the chili though.  Next time I will try adding a can of stewed tomatoes.  The corn bread really soaked up the sauce.  It was fabulous though.

Super easy and quick to make. I have made it a couple of times and tweak it every time. Once with kidney beans and once with sweet corn. It was delicious both times. Overall great recipe!

We loved this! I added some mild salsa to the top. 
Served with lime tortillas. 
Absolutely scrumptious! 
(oh, and I did make with turkey and Mexican cheese.)

I made it according to directions except for the cornbread.  I only used 1 box pf mix so followed the Jiffy Box ( 1 egg & 1/3 c. Milk)  mix directions, I didn't want it too crusty,  I also baked  in a  7' x 11' as apposed to 9"x13" as in menu and added about 15 minutes to bake time as it was still doughy after 30 minutes of baking.   Otherwise, it was a good easy dinner option if you like chili & cornbread!
