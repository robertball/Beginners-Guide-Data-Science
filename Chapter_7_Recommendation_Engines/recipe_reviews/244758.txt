Made as written and these were pretty good. They came together in a flash and the corn was a nice addition.  They could have used a bit more salt so next time I will add more soy sauce. I recommend having all of your ingredients out and chopped before you ever start because once you start, it moves fast.

Turned out great.  Although I added my own twist and added some fresh ground pepper, Hoisin Sauce, peanuts and dried chow mien noodles.

My entire family enjoyed this recipe! We substituted edamame for the sugar snap peas but otherwise prepared as written.

What a yummy low calorie meal!  Made as is but left the corn out. For sure I’ll make this again!

This was good but I put in shiitake mushrooms and no corn. I also add the fried noodles and used Ice burg lettuce instead of  bibb. There was nothing left so they loved it. The next time I make this I will add a sauce.

I loved these! I used ground turkey and put chopped pecans on top because I didn’t have peanuts. I think I’ll try it with hoisin sauce next time. Will definitely make these again!

Was craving lettuce wraps and this was a great base recipe. I agree that you should prep all your ingredients before you start cooking as it does move fast. I added green onions with the snap peas and added teriyaki sauce to the mix. Served on f
