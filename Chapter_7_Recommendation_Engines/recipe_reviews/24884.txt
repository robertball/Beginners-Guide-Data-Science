Excellent salad.  Makes a very attractive and appealing presentation on a large platter.  Very gourmet.  A great recipe to serve guests.  Just a note, if you print out the recipe to the 4x6 size, the romaine hearts appear separate from the ingredients list and are easy to miss when making your grocery list!

Excellent salad!  Hubby and I ate it up!  I used a little less olive oil, as the previous reviews suggested.  Will definately make again!

I've made this salad twice and yes, the dressing is runny but it still works fine. I tossed my greens with the dressing, place them on a large shallow platter(with a lip) then arrange the rest of the indredients on top drizzling a bit more dressing over everything. I did not use all the dressing, about half. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful! I did add some crumbled goat cheese and was very pleased with the addition. If this salad sounds good to you, try it and don't worry about the runny dressing because the orange flavor it adds to the salad is well worth it.

I thought 2 cups of OJ was a bit too much.  I poured out about 1/2 a cup after adding the herbs.  I could not get my dressing to thicken  (probably because I have a really bad blender), and had to use cornstarch as a thickener. I stuck it in the freezer to cool because I was a little pressed for time. It worked out just fine.  The dressing is very tasty.  I might add a bit more sugar next time but tastes fine as is.  I added crumbled feta on top of my finished product. Thanks for a new twist on salad J. Craig.

I  started out with doubling the dressing. I thought the salad would be small, but it serves at least 10. Anyway, I cooked orange juice down to half thinking maybe that was why some reviews said it wouldn't thicken. I had no better luck doing it this way. Was still very watery. I added less olive oil and it was still overpowering flavor. Didn't like it. I kept trying to "fix" it but ended up throwing it out. I ended up using the dressing from Betsy's mandarin orange salad(this web site). I thought I would have to get more than 2 pears. I was serving 8 and had to do 2 servings without nuts and wanted everyone to have a good taste of the pears. So I got 6 asian pears  and it cost me $9.oo! It wasn't necessary to get all those pears, 3 would have been enough. They held up good during cooking time, I think another type of pear may get mushy. I never had asian pears before, they are shaped like an apple, slice like an apple, I was worried they weren't ripe because they are firm, but they were. This part of the salad was good. Wait to add pears and dressing to lettuce until just before serving. I added pears to salad ahead of time and it got very wilted, even without the dressing. I really didn't need to double anything afterall. My husband loved it and so did my other guests, but I thought it was too sweet, My fault for trying to double pear mix.I won't use that many pears next time. It did have a complex of flavors and that I liked. Thanks J. Craig!

This salad is wonderful, the dressing however needs help. When searching for other recipes to compare it to, most said to reduce the orange juice to 1/4 C. I tried that but didn't like the flavor of the dressing, when I blended in the onion, it over powered the flavors. So I used the recipe from Orange Vinaigrette Brown Rice Salad (also on this site) I also used Red Wine vinegar instead of balsamic vinegar, as someone said it turns the dressing a brownish color. I waited until time to serve to add the dressing, and topped it with crumbled goat cheese (a first for me, but very mild flavor and good) Its a very elegant salad and I got many complements.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  This salad is comparable to a few I've had in some of the best restaurants in the Washington D.C. area!!  Light, refreshing and a great combination of flavors.  My only substitution was onion powder in place of the raw onions (personal preference).  I'm sure this did change the *bite*  of the salad slightly.  Do not skip the prosciutto because the salty/sweet combination is great with the asian pears!  My pears did not caramelize to a nice brown color, so I added a tablespoon of organic agave nectar to help them turn a more golden color.  Make sure not to slice your pear too thin because they will become overcooked easily.  I will definitely be making this salad again for friends and family functions.

We served this salad for a dinner club we belong to -- we really felt it was VERY so-so...nothing special and certainly no special tastes.  Don't like the way the pears disintegrate.

I was excited about this because I love pears, but the combination of flavors was strange.  I wasn't wild about the dressing-there was a weird, olive oil aftertaste.  I think the recipe would grow on you.

I really love this recipe, however, I change it up a bit when I make it.  Last time I made it, I left out the prociutto and added some goat cheese.  Instead of the dressing I just used balsalmic vinegar & olive oil.  It was really good.

This salad is WONDERFUL!!!  It takes some time to prepare but if your willing to put forth the effort I totally reccommend it.  The only change I have made is I do not add the water to the pears when I'm carmelizing them...  they just turn to mush.

Delicious recipe though a little time consuming. I had no problems with the dressing. It is going to be a little thin but that shouldn't be a big concern. Next time, I will forgo carmelizing the pears. I think they could be cut up as is and placed in the salad without any real difference in taste. Really liked the proscuitto in this recipe. Plan on making this again for friends. Really liked the combination of sweet and salty.

Great salad.  The men in my family hate girly salads but made an exception for this one.  The dressing takes a while to thicken but is well worth the wait.

I just could not get the dressing to work on this salad. I followed directions exactly and they would not emulsifly!! Made it once more, still did not work. Just put Paul Newmans Balsamic dressing on and called it a day!

Excellent recipe.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of white.  I would also cut down on the amount of oil.  I made the dressing a day a head.  Wait to put salad together until you are ready to eat otherwise it will wilt.  I will make again.

The flavors in the salad blend together so perfectly that it is a party for you mouth.  It is also beautiful...the colors are all really different.  My friends were so impressed they deemed the dinner I served the salad with "the best ever"!!  I topped the salad with crumbled goat cheese...it was good that way too.

This salad is delicious. I made it the first time and followed the recipe exactly except I used bacon instead of prosciutto (because it's hard to find here). The second time I did not carmelize the pears, which was a fresh twist. The flavors were all still there-- both are very good. Other reviewers who complained about the olive oil taste may just want to use a milder olive oil.

Delicious, but prosciutto always is.  Even without it, the dressing and caramelized pears and walnuts were great.  It was a little sweeter than I prefer, so next time I'd probably not add the sugar to the dressing.

I scaled the recipe to just 2 servings and didn't reduce the orange juice (just used less). The carmelized pears and walnuts were fabulous, and the vinagarette was delicious. It didn't thicken, but vinagarette is typically very thin. Served with a ham and cheese quiche for a great meal - the salad was made while the quiche cooked, and everything came out at the same time.

Made this for a special lunch and it was a hit. I used Asian pears, substituted red wine for the white wine since I was out, and then added goat cheese as well.  Fabulous!

An intriguing mix of tastes and textures. Akin to a salad you might find on the menu of a top notch restaurant. Dressing was lukewarm when served, would have preferred it chilled a tad more. Otherwise an extremely good salad.

Good way to change up salad.  I tried this with thin cut salami was good.  be careful it can get sweet.

This was pretty good but nothing so amazing that I need to make it again.  The nuts came out a little soggy.  It was a little sugary overall.  I included the pear sauce so that is probably avoidable.

Not worth the money or effort. The onion in the dressing overpowered the orange; I ended up using the vinaigrette from "orange vinaigrette brown rice salad" instead. That helped, but I won't make this salad again.

My salad dressing was way too runny. I read reviews before I made it, and decided to make dressing hours before serving. I made dressing about 6 hours before, kept it in refrigerator for 5 hours, it didn't help. Then I put it in freezer for another hour, guess what? It DIDN’T help. So I ended up using just half of made dressing, because the consistency was just like water. Overall, salad is very sweet. And it is time consuming. I used regular green pears. Next day I had some of the leftover salad with my lunch and it tasted better to me then day before. Will I make it again? Maybe in 5 years or so...

I thought this salad was perfect.  It is a bit sweet, but with the dressing it works out. I loved the dressing because it wasn't as strong as some of the other ones out there, but still had flavor.  I served this salad to about 10 people who don't like to try new things and they all gave it a shot and they all asked for more.  I also didn't add all the water to the pears when carmalizing them and they turned out great.

This is a good idea for a recipe, I just had a caramelized pear salad at a restaurant and wanted to try it myself. 

I skipped the Prosciutto because I'm a vegetarian and I cut the recipe in half because there were only 3 of us eating (and I knew I'd have seconds).  I was wary of the dressing right after I made it (the orange juice did reduce, it didn't take forever but that may have been because I halved the whole recipe) so I put it on the side.  The three of us all enjoyed the dressing quite a bit, despite initial apprehension.  
Without even reading any of the reviews, I peeked in my fridge and just knew that goat cheese would be great in it.  I served the caramelized stuff on the side because my boyfriend doesn't care for pears and our guest doesn't care for nuts!  I know that that probably affects the overall distribution but hey, I thought it was pretty good.

Maybe next time I'll try it with fake bacon instead of prosciutto?  

This recipe does take a long time to prepare, the dressing, especially.

The salad is great.  I like to add a bit of gorgonzola to it as well.  The dressing just didn't work for me.  I substituted a raspberry vinaigrette instead and that worked beautifully without all the work.  The sweet and salty of the the pear and prosciutto play well off each other.  We like the tang of the gorgonzola as a contrast as well as the sweet and tangy of the vinaigrette we used.  Very nice salad!

Carmelizing the pears & walnuts is easy...and delicious. Guys & girls love this recipe. I've made it several times already. 

With shame I admit that I have never made the dressing part...I use (gasp) store bought Vinaigrette! Still wonderful.

This was just ok.  The pears were gooey and the dressing tasted unremarkable and took forever to reduce.  Plus I only used about 1/3 of the dressing and the salad was still heavy on the dressing.  I wanted this salad to seem extra special bu it was not.

I used two Bartlett pears and that was perfect for 2 small bunches of lettuce (I used 1 romaine and 1 green leaf). I used pre-made OJ and cut the amount in half (overpowering flavor). After the dressing was blended I returned it to the stove and added cornstarch (mixed w/ water to get rid of lumps, of course) to thicken the dressing, and after that it was perfect. Oh, and I used honey instead of sugar. To the salad, I added dried cranberries and goat cheese. The flavors were AMAZING. My pears/walnuts didn't have the glaze that you think of when you hear "caramelized," and I almost dumped out all the liquid in the pan. Luckily I didn't because the sweetened pear juice was DELICIOUS. I ended up with about twice as much dressing as I needed for this salad, but we'll use it til it's gone--we loved it!

Great, delicious salad. The prosciutto with pear make this a recipe for elegant or fancy dinners.
