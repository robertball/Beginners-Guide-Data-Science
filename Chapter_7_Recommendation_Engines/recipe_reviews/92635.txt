I used fresh spinach and simplified steps.  I made the roux in a dutch oven, adding garlic early.  Then I mixed in chopped 
fresh spinach, covered the pot, and removed from heat.  Stirred in cheese and dusted with nutmeg and pepper. -- Since I used fresh spinach and removed it from the heat it maintained more of its shape and character, but you can let it cook down more if you prefer.

Wow!  My 11 and 9 yr olds fought over the last of this.  It's that good and very easy.
I didn't read the directions, but having cooked for a number of years, I figured out the method. OK, it wasn't as written but I had fabulous results. So I melted the butter in a saucepan, then gently cooked the garlic.  Then I made this into a white sauce of sorts w/ the flour and milk.  I squeezed my spinach dry as I don't care for that liquid in the spinach (tastes like the freezer), so I added more milk.  It got a little dry while waiting to serve it, so I threw in some fatfree half and half (what a wonderful invention!!!).
Add the nutmeg - freshly ground if you have it.  It adds just the right touch to a creamed dish.  I used white pepper and sea salt and plenty of fresh parm..   YUMMMMMMM!!!

This dish was way too yummy.  I added a few extra indregients(cream and ricotta cheeses), topped with both shredded and grated parmesan cheese and baked it off in the oven until bubbly and golden.  I also subtituted the whole milk with evaporated milk and used an extra 1/4 cup of it.

I LOVE creamed spinach, and this is not bad recipe for a basic start.   I like that is was quick and easy and used frozen spinach.   However, I like more 'sauce' on my creamed spinach and the flavor was just shy of being 'really good' - and I even added a small amount of dried chopped onions.   I will make this again, but will make more sauce and try additions to ramp-up the flavor - more garlic, sauted onions, maybe bacon...   guess it'll have to be a work in progress!

My favorite coffee shop recently stopped offering creamed spinach as a veggie option on their menu and I was devastated!  I had never made creamed spinach from scratch at home, so I was looking for a simple recipe.  This was exactly what I was looking for!  The only thing I did differently was to skip the microwave step, sauteeing the garlic in the butter before making the roux in my dutch oven, and I used a pound of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen (next time I'll use a pound and a half).  Even my daughter, who doesn't like cooked spinach, ate hers without complaint!  Thanks for a great recipe that will absolutely be a regular in my kitchen :-)

This recipe was very blah as written (I omitted the nutmeg, but used plenty of garlic).  It was not creamy enough.  So, I made a separate batch of the cream, using 1 3/4 c. of milk and the same amount of butter and flour and added that plus 1/2 c. extra of parmesan.  It was pretty good then.  Thanks for the base to start with!

I only had skim milk onhand, so I added a couple tablespoons of whipped cream cheese to give it a creamier texture. I think the lack of "zing" a few have noticed comes from using frozen rather than fresh spinach. This is a good basic recipe, but I'll saute fresh spinach when making it next time.

I used tapioca flour instead of wheat flour (son's allergies), left out the garlic and increased the butter...so it wasn't exactly the same recipe, but it was so easy and my son who doesn't like spinach asked for seconds!!!

I think this is terrific with a few changes.  I sauteed fresh spinach and drained well. I cooked garlic in butter with about a half a cup of minced onion,flour until blended & then added the milk to make a cream sauce. I scraped maybe an pinch of nutmeg and zapped it up with a little cayenne.  I used a little bit more parmesan & threw in a bit of swiss cheese. Delicious!  Thanks so much for this recipe

I needed to bring creamed spinach to a school potluck since I volunteered to make sides and creamed spinach was what was voted on....great...the one side dish i've had a million times but never made for myself. Followed the recipe except for nutmeg (didn't have any) and made it more like how i'm used to it (chicago bergoff style) with red pepper flakes and a few shakes of mexican hot sauce which gave it a nice kick but wasn't overpoweringly spicy since it was for a crowd. Everyone ate it all up.

Awesome recipe...as good or better than creamed spinach at very expensice restaurants I've visited.  We don't have a dutch oven, so I sauteed the garlic and onions in a pan, then added the spinach and cream mix.  I transferred the food to a casserole dish, covered with fresh parmesan and cooked just long enough to melt the cheese.  I would only use a dash of nutmeg next time, but otherwise, it was GREAT!

Darn it, it's just too delicious! Everyone ate it and liked it. Too bad - I wanted it all for myself. I did cut back on the garlic, of which I'm not fond, but no one missed it. I think I'd add even more cheese next time!

This was very yummy!  The only thing I did different was I used heavy cream in place of the milk.  Otherwise, I followed it to the letter, and it was quite delicious!!!  :)

This was the best creamed spinach we've ever had!!  I used cream instead of milk and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  We'll be using this recipe from now on.

This creamed spinach had a great light flavor.  I made the recipe using a can of spinach because that was what I had handy.  I will definitely make it again.  I really liked the way it turned out.

Thank you! My daughter, the teenager - who is extremely picky, has despised spinach forever - amongst 8 million other food choices - Well I made this recipe - told her it was chinese cabbage (so I fibbed a little - she loves chinese so was willing to try) and she loved it. We all loved it. FANTASTIC and EASY - I've long since told her it's spinach - but in my house we now call this Chinese Cabbage" and it's asked for often!  I do try different cheeses and increase the amount - our favorite cheese is mild cheddar with some "american" using about cup and a half. Thanks so much!

This was soooo easy and delicious.  I did not defrost the spinach.  I used half and half (there was no milk in the house).
I keep a jar of onion and garlic (which I process weekly) in the fridge...this was used instead of plain garlic.
Yummy.  Thanks for sharing.
My 12 year old enjoyed it!  Even better.

I made this to go along with a salmon pasta dish that I made the other night.  I halved the recipe but still used 3 cloves of garlic.  I think it would've been too bland if I hadn't used as much garlic.  Even my husband thought it was pretty good, and he's not a big fan of spinach.

I made this tonight and it was fabulous.  Even my 11 and 13 year old kids liked it.  I used fresh spinach and steamed it in a bit of chicken broth and omitted the juice from the spinach which  was indicated in the recipe.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.

I made the recipe as written, and it is delicious.  It definitely needs salt, even after the parmesan cheese is added.  A keeper for my family, for sure!

LOVE this recipe!  The only change I made was to add just a tiny pinch of salt.  It's not too heavy, so you can really taste the flavor of the spinach.  I've made this 3 times in the last 2 months and can't get enough!!  THANKS!

Really good; halved the recipe exactly but after tasting, had to add a little more milk (maybe 2 Tbsp or so).  Will make again with a little more milk and maybe a shallot.

I made this dish to accompany a prime rib I made for my family. I did make one change to my version. Less nutmeg for us...its so overpowering. Besides that, it was a lovely side dish.

As did others, I used this as a base recipe, following the method exactly. I added in chopped green onion with the garlic, used 2 cups milk instead of part spinach liquid, added another 1/4 c. Parm. and 2 T. cream cheese.... and it was great!

Not a bad recipe...has a good creamy consistancy and good flavor. I didn't give it a five only because I've never made creamed spinach before so I really have nothing to compare it too. Enjoy it.

When I purchase 32 oz. instead of the 40 oz. as mentioned on the recipe. I add less milk due to spinach having  watery content. I add more cheese and butter and 5 tablespoon of flour. Thank you for the recipe! Less calories than cream cheese and cream of mushroom soup.

Amazing! My family and I absolutely loved it! The only thing I did different was that I used 2% milk mixed with a little 1/2 and 1/2 because we didn’t have whole milk in the house. Also I didn’t heat the milk/spinach juice mixture, I kept it cold, made the roux (I used half butter, half evoo) and then just poured it in and whisked til it was creamy. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious!  Fortunately my kids already like spinach and they LOVED this recipe. I didn't add any salt though as the Parmesan added enough saltiness. I served it with chicken Marsala because I didn't feel like going to an Indian grocery for the ingredients for Saag Paneer.  It was an excellent substitute. Yum! Yum! Yum!

Deliciously flavorful and rich (using fresh parm). Cut fat grams by subbing OO for butter and replace whole milk with lower fat milk. Cook the flour (roux) mixture over low heat for 2-3 minutes to remove raw flour taste - use equal amounts flour/OO. Once thawed, squeeze (and reserve) as much liquid as possible from spinach to avoid diminishing the final rich flavor - use liquid if final dish becomes too thick.  Recipe halves very easily.

Really good as written.  Used fresh parmesan.  Even better with onion added.  The adults in this household liked it very much.  The 7 year old tried one bite as agreed upon and decided that one bite was sufficient.  The 2 year old wouldn't even try it, and I am not willing to argue about it.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was wonderful! Using aged parmesan cheese, rather than the stuff in the can, makes a huge difference; and I would never have thought of adding nutmeg, but it adds a nice touch.

There are no Boston Markets where I live, but now I don't miss them!

Quick and delicious flavor, but I had to add just a touch of seasoned salt.  Will make again, but next time maybe a dash or two of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  :)

Recipe did not work well at all. The flour to butter ratio seemed off and when the milk was added the flour turned into dumplings. The spinach was not tender after 5 minutes. More like fifteen.

It came out excellent. I just submitted frozen spinach for fresh and combined 1/4 1% milk with evaporated milk because I never buy whole milk. Finally, substituted the cheese with 1% mozzeralla cheese.

I made this with fresh spinach.  This kept the texture and a bright flavor of the spinach.  3 of my 4 family members liked it - only the pickiest eater wasn't impressed.  I like the addition of the nutmeg too - a nice touch.

Very tasty, and I used canned spinach (if you do, just drain it well and use 2 cans). I did have to add a few more spices and some more milk to make my sauce creamy, but it turned out well. Even my toddler liked it, so I'll be making it again.

Wow!  If you want me to describe how this tastes, it's almost like a light Alfredo sauce.  I made chicken meatballs, rice and this creamed spinach recipe with fresh spinach.  Can't wait to eat, I'm about to set the table but had to say "wow" and "yummy" first.

I've never made creamed spinach before.  I had to borrow 2% milk from my neighbor b/c we only had skim.  I used the leftover amount of a bag of frozen spinach and just winged it with the amounts of ingredients. I didn't really measure anything.  I used fresh garlic.  And the recipe turned out great.  That never happens for me.  My husband is the real fan of creamed spinach and he loved it.

Love this dish and this was the best I've ever tasted!  And so easy, too.  I only had one box of spinach, so I quartered the recipe.  You have to be careful not to overdo the nutmeg.  Too much causes a little bitterness.  Next time I will make the full batch.  Wonder how this freezes.

This is really good! I'd never made creamed spinach before, so I was really excited with how this turned out. It was a spur of the moment decision to make this, and I didn't have the exact ingredients, but I was able to follow the recipe pretty closely. The only real difference was that I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whole milk. I'll definitely be making this again!

I added too much flour because it looked watery - don't do that, it will be fine. Otherwise it was very good. We added extra parm to taste.

just made this...mmmmm. Almost followed the recipe. I had no garlic so used garlic powder, no nutmeg so used a pinch of allspice. I had only one 300gram (for you Canadians) package of frozen spinach. The recipe made what I thought was just the right amount of sauce. I also added a heaping tablespoon of sour cream.

I made this as a side dish for our dinner tonight. I tweaked the recipe a bit and the outcome was yummy. I used 2 large bags of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I sautéed the spinach until wilted in a dutch oven. In a medium size pot i sautéed 1/2 cup diced onion, 3 minced garlic cloves, in the butter. I then added the flour and milk and wished until smooth. I then added plenty of salt, pepper and 2 dashes of cayenne. I simmered until thick and also to cook the flour a bit. I mixed in a heaping 1/2 cup of fresh Parmesan. Once melted I mixed in this cream sauce into the spinach. My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely be making it again!

Easy and yummy. I like the idea of using milk rather than cream. I left out nutmeg because of personal preference. 
Even my non-creamed spinach eater liked it. Will definitely make again. Thank you!

Very good, loved loved the nutmeg!  Thought it should’ve cooked just a little longer, and next time I will use more liquid as I found it to be a little drier than I would have liked.    Over all, it was very good.

Had nonfat milk only so i added some sour cream. In addition to parmesan, added a touch of other cheeses happened to have on hand like blue cheese and Mexican mix. Used frozen spinach. Using a silicon whisk to stir while on low heat maintains consistency while blending flavors.

I had some confusion over bagged vs boxed spinach but made it with 3 bags. It wasn't creamy enough so ended up adding some cream cheese and it was delicious. Everyone (including) kids loved it.

I used fresh spinach, cooked it first  I did not have whole milk so I used what I had; almond milk.  I heated the milk, added the butter and whisked in the flour.  Added the spinach, grated nutmeg and the cheese.  We really enjoyed it.

Way too much nutmeg for my family. I'm going to x the nutmeg the next time and see if it's better. Very easy to make and is enough to serve 6-8 people in my family as a side. Both my kids loved it. My husband and I didn't like the nutmeg taste.

never made creamed spinach before this recipe. very easy to make, the entire family loved it. the only thing we didn't like about the recipe was the amount of nutmeg.  the next time i made this, i made sure to cut the amount of nutmeg in half, and instead of using milk, i used heavy cream. very very good!

I made this with fresh spinach, so it was difficult to estimate and my husband thought it was too creamy.  However, it was still absolutely delicious!!

Great creamed spinach!  I've never seen my husband eat spinach, but he cleaned up his serving---just said it was a bit bland.  Well, hey!  It's spinach!

A really nice and easy way to use frozen spinach. I made it entirely on the stove top and added more milk as it was a little dry for my tastes. I also added a shallot.

It was okay, and I will probably make again. My family felt it had too much nutmeg and could've used more salt. Which I added quite a bit to begin with.

I made the cream spinach and it was very good!! I think this recipe is better than the cream spinach from Ruth Chris Steak House. I also saved some money and had plenty of left overs!!

Yum!  I substituted garlic powder for the minced garlic just because that's what I had on hand.  It was very tasty, though.  I had this with the French's Onions Crispy Parmesan Chicken and it was really good.  I actually thought this was better creamed spinach than I recently had in an upscale restaurant.

This was pretty good.  I halved the recipe.  It felt like something was missing so I added about two tablespoons of cream cheese and it came out perfect!  I will definitely make this again.

I have admired Pam Anderson for years, I even have one of her cookbooks, so I had high expectations for this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written, making no changes (which is unusual for me).  I was disappointed.  The dish was okay, but somehow flat.  It needs something, but I can't put my finger on it.  I'll try it again, but I'll play with it and try and find the missing ingredient to give the flavor I'm looking for.

This was really good and I'm glad I used fresh grated nutmeg. I sauteed a HUGE bag of fresh spinach that I roughly chopped in some olive oil instead of using frozen. It really takes about as much time as zapping the frozen stuff in the microwave. Anyway, great basic recipe. I'll use some shallots or gruyere cheese instead... just to mix things up a bit. I could have made a meal out of this deal.

This tasted good, but it's a bit labor intensive.  I sauteed the garlic first, with half a chopped onion.  I took points off since there's nothing in the directions to indicate when the last three ingredients should be added.
