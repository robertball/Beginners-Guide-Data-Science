Very easy and delicious. We have a vegetarian in our family and we are always looking for meatless dishes that are hearty. This recipe would even please meat lovers!

I was really excited to try this recipe because it had such a high rating- made it for the superbowl! Unfortunately, there was way too much of the ricotta mixture and no where near enough sauce. Although my guests tried to be nice, I could tell it wasn't a favorite. Bummer! I followed the recipe to a T. With a few changes I could see it being good. In the "unadapted" version on allrecipes, it is rated much lower. Wish I had seen that before I made it!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it came out wonderfully!  I'm not big on ground meats so this recipe peaked my interest.  I used Ragu sauce because that's my favorite.  I also added pepperonis to the top because I was afraid my fiance would miss the meat.  He LOVED it!  I might double the sauce next time because after sitting for a few days and reheating it was starting to get a little dry.

Absolutely fabullous!! I used Classico Florentine Spinach and Cheese sauce, which made it awesome!! And instead of Parmesan and Mozzarella, I used Italian 5 Cheeses!! Delish!!

I made this today, and this was my first ever attempt at lasagna. I had to add meat to this already amazing recipe, but oh my gosh this made my taste buds screaming for more =]
