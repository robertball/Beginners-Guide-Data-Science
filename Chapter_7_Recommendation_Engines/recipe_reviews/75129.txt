I wanted to duplicate the Mango Pineapple Smoothie at McDonalds so I was ecstatic when I found this recipe!  I just made it, and even though I completely forgot to add the cream of coconut this was just as refreshing and delicious as McDonalds and a lot cheaper.  I made it with 0% fat vanilla yogurt which just brought the calorie count way down.  Thanks for posting! :D

Great! I used coconut milk to replace the milk and cream of coconut. I didn't need the extra sweetness as my fruit was very ripe. Thanks for the recipe - its a good one.

This was a nice refreshing smoothie. I froze the banana, used soy milk, and substituted orange juice for the pineapple as I didn't have any, and the result was a creamy tasty smoothie. There are a few strands of mango hanging out in this, but it's nothing you can't put up with for the taste.

Smoothies provide a lot of margin for error.  I made this recipe with what I had on hand, plain yogurt instead of vanilla, orange/strawberry/banana juice instead of pineapple and I did not have any cream of coconut.  Without the cream of coconut, it was a little tart, but still good.  I could have added splenda or another sweetener, but enjoyed it as it was. I added some strawberries, which were awesome.  I look forward to trying this with the proper ingredients and realize my "4" isn't fair in light of my substitutions.

Very good.  I used what I had on hand...fresh pineapple instead of juice, frozen banana, fresh mango, nonfat vanilla ice cream and used coconut milk in place of the milk/cream of coconut.  I also added about 1/2 cup of ice to make it thicker.  Very yummy and creamy!

I've never heard of cream of coconut, but the rest of the ingrdients made a yummy drink. I found it a bit thick, but a few ice cubes solved that problem. This was a hit with the little people.

Here's what I did: (a majority of the original ingredients, but different proportions): 4 cups frozen mango chunks, 2 cups sliced cold pineapple, 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup orange juice, and 1/2 banana. Really good!!!

I modified this according to what I had  on hand - skim milk, plain yogurt, vanilla extract - and I'm not sure what cream coconut is, but I didn't want to open a whole can of coconut milk for just 2 tbsp, so I left that out too. I think next time I will add more banana. Thanks, Starflower!

When I first made this I really liked it when I tasted it. Then, I realized I forgot the mango. I ended up adding it and I thought it made kind of a tart taste it didn't have without it. Also, whenever I add mango to a smoothie, it turns the smoothie kind of fiberous unless I blend it a long time. However, I don't like smoothies like water either from so much blending. Nonetheless, I made 2 servings and we did drink it all. I would consider adding ice cubes though.

This is a pretty good smoothie.  I like my smoothies thicker and more frozen, so I left out the milk and froze the mango chunks.  I didn't have cream of coconut, so I subbed some flaked coconut, which made it a little chewy, but not bad.

I made this recipe twice and overall it's pretty good, but I don't know if I will go out of my way to make it again. I took off one star because cream of coconut is so hard to find at the grocery store (hint: I found it near the alcoholic drink mixes at Walmart).

The first time I made the recipe all I had was vanilla Greek yogurt. I don't recommend using Greek yogurt because the strong protein milk flavor of Greek yogurt tends to overpower the other fruity ingredients. The 2nd time around I found it has a good texture with mild tropical fruitiness and is very, very sweet. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. I'm used to green smoothies for breakfast but this tasted more like a desert than something I would eat while running out the door. Next time I'll try diluting the pineapple juice and adding some strawberries to give it more fruit and less sugar.

i didnt have pinapple juice so i used orange juice.  it wasn't sweet enough so i added a tbl spoon of splenda.  even the 1/2 banana made the whole thing taste like banana and it was really stringy like it had a bunch of hair in it.  taste was ok but dont think ill make it again.

I left out the milk and added a ton of ice and some chia seeds. Otherwise it would much too runny and warm for my liking. The results were tasty. I made my own cream of coconut.
(Note: this is a lot of sugar for a smoothie)

Excellent. I did make changes based on what I had on hand and was making a single serving so cut the recipe down to 1/4 cup instead of 1 cup measurements. I didn't have any coconut, but will try it with it when I  have some. I used frozen mango and pineapple chunks and plain vanilla yogurt, but added a scoop of vanilla protein powder. I might drop out the banana entirely or reduce it next time I make it.  Really yummy smoothie!

We just had this smoothie and it was absolutely delicious!  This is the first time I've ever tried mango in anything!  I did use sweetened pineapple juice, cause that's all I had, but it was delicious.  I didn't add the cream of coconut, didn't have any.  Loved, loved, loved it and we'll have this again.  I did freeze the mango and the banana - sliced them into small pieces and they separated ok and weren't a problem in my (weak) blender! :)  I'm going to Pin the recipe on Pinterest.  I'm sure others will love it too.  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this delicious recipe!!

Instead a whole mango I just used mango ice cream and instead of cream of coconut I used 2 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk.

As much as I love fresh mangos (any type), I don't think it works well in smoothies.  It kind of made everything chalky/dull tasting.  I bet if you switched from fresh mangos to a liquid form and pineapple juice to fresh/frozen pineapples,  it would be balanced....that's just my opinion though. Overall, it wasn't bad.
