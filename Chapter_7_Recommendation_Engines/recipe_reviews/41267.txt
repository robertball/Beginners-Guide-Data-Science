This dish was extremely bland to my taste.  I am American, but I cook only Indian food for myself and my Indian fiance.  We are used to spices- not terribly hot chili spice (he's actually very sensitive to chilis), but just lots of cumin, coriander, turmeric, ginger, etc.  But when I made this recipe, even though I added twice the stated amounts of each spice (as Manisha said the spices could be increased, and I knew the amounts were very small for our tastes), AND I added chopped fresh coriander, it was still disappointingly bland.  I also used about 1/2 of the recommended oil.

I gave the recipe 2 stars because it still has some of the basic ingredients for a good okra dish, and it may be good in a pinch (when you're not in the mood to chop/measure out a bunch of ingredients).

This is a great dish.  The Indian spices were just right -- definitely not what I would call spicy-hot, just good and flavorful.  The dish is not so exotic that not-so-adventurous palates wouldn't like the dish.  I really liked the onion and tomato combination with the okra.

I've made this several times without the asafoedita, and it's always tasted great.

This is a decent okra dish, but it's not a very good Indian okra dish. I doubled the spices and added half of a jalapeno, and it still seemed to be missing something, so I added coriander and fresh ginger, and I topped it with chopped cilantro. Nope, still missing something. I love the okra at our favorite Indian restaurant, and although I didn't expect this to taste like that, I expected more flavor. Thanks, anyway.

I decreased the oil to 2 Tbsp and used fresh okra and it was delicious and easy!  I also used cayenne pepper instead of chili powder.  It's well flavored but not too spicy.  If you really want the burn, add more spices or peppers---I'll do this next time I make it.

I make this recipe frequently.  Indian food is not always supposed to be spicey and the amount of spices is just right.  Wonderful easy recipe to make.

I give this one 2 stars, but due to operator error :) I love okra but don't cook it very often so mine turned out really stringy. Guess those special spices are pretty important too; I had to eliminate a couple and the resulting flavor was not what I expected.

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this recipe at all. Please learn from my mistake and save yourself the trouble. This was so bland; I more than doubled the spices and still it didn't taste flavorful at all. In fact it tasted pretty bad (before and after adding more spices). I tried to fix it up, but really this recipe isn't even worth experimenting with.

This was a pleasant surprise.  The favors blended well for me.  I didn't have a couple of the spices, but it still worked.

This is a GREAT little recipe.  I made some tiny changes to it and it was absolutely delicious.  Instead of the chili powder I added a little bit of fresh chili chopped up into the mixture, and as I don't like frozen anything, I made it from fresh, garden grown and freshly picked okra.... YUMMY!

I hate okra but I am trying to eat a wider variety of vegetables so decided to try it. I actually find it GOOD. Yes, it's not the spiciest Indian dish but it's still okra cooked well. I enjoyed it!

Awesome stuff, though I modified the spices to what I had on hand - garam masala, coriander and cumin.  Delicious!

This recipe has very small proportions of the spices usually used in Indian cooking.   The spices aren't wrong  but the amounts are, and could use a serrano chile also.

This is an excellent dish! I couldn't find asafoetida powder, but didn't seem to miss it. I doubled the amount of the Indian chili powder (lal mirch) and found that had a good amount of heat. I used 2 tomatoes as I wanted it a bit saucier. I served it as a side dish with barbequed chicken thighs and Jamie Oliver's "Bombay potatoes."
