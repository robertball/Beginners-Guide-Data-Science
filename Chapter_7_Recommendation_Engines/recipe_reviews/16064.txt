The jello was very runny -- there is far too much fluid in the recipe.  I would change the 2.5 cups of water for the jello to 1 cup, given that there is also pineapple juice and orange juice crystals.  It is very tasty, however.

We really enjoyed this but I did make a few modifications.  I only used 1 3/4 C water and omitted the pineapple and pineapple juice. I put it in a 7x10 pan.  I kept the topping as written. It set up nicely and tasted very refreshing.  My husband requested this again very soon.

This is absolutely superb! I have made it twice. The first time it didn't set but only because I added all the crushed pinneaple with juice. It only calls for part of the can. The second time it was PERFECT. The topping is sooo yummy! :)

This recipe is great.  Those of you complaining it is too runny, did you look at the size of your jello box???? If you have a regular size box (3 oz) of course you need to reduce the water.  Also look at the oz on your can of crushed pineapple.  Please everyone try this.  It is fine if you pay attention to what you are doing!!

This was okay, I took the advice of others and decreased the amount of water to 1 1/2 cups.  Not super crazy about this recipe, will probably not make again.

Since the sizes of cans have changed I notified the recipe. I drain the oranges and use a 22oz reg size crushed pineapple also drained. This allows the jello to set firm. I also add a container of cool whip to the topping. Itself thick it's hard to spread. Always a favorite at my home.

Hmm.  I've never had anything similar, so I have nothing to compare it to, but we were not a fan of the cream cheese topping--it was kind of rubbery when all was said and done.  We ended up taking it off the top.  The jello itself was good--I didn't have pineapple so left it out and added a bit of water.  I didn't have two boxes of orange jello, so hubs suggested raspberry and orange.  That didn't work so well, however, so I wouldn't suggest that.  Barring that, though, we liked the jello so would try that again, just leaving the topping off.  Thanks for the recipe!
