Because I grow blueberries, Iâ€™m always on the hunt for a good blueberry recipe and this one is very good.  This makes a wonderful blueberry cake that has wonderful flavor and texture.  The only changes I made were to add a little vanilla and I extended the baking time.

My momma would make me blueberry buckle every year for my July birthday. When The Lord suddenly took her home a few years ago,the recipe went with her. I've been searching for & baking many Blueberry Buckle recipes. Think I have finally found a keeper! Will definitely be making this again. Thank you ChefGary for submitting this recipe ~ you have brought back many wonderful memories :-)

Batter was so thick, I could not work with it. Needs either less flour or not milk to make the right consistency.

Followed the recipe exactly but scaled down for an 8x8 pan. It was lovely and a great use for extra blueberries!

If you are looking for more of a det, cakey buckle you might like this. I followed the recipe to a T, including only not overmixing and took mine out of the oven at 38 minutes to play it safe. I still find it over risen, somewhat dry, and crumbly. Not horrible but there are much better recipes out there in my opinion.

I added only 3 and 1/2 cups flour rather than 4. still a bit dry. But I like the large size and served warm it is really delicious.

My family loved this.  I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead and it made a nice crispy topping.  The only thing I think detracted from it was the amount of flour.  Even after baking I could still smell the flour when we ate it.

My daughter made this. She meant to follow the recipe but dumped all dry ingredients in at the same time. It still came out tasty. She had to bake this an extra 20 minutes because the middle was still gooey. Very dense coffee cake. Flavor was good.

Since I'm a vegan I didn't think I would be able to make this recipe but I figured how to make it vegan and it came out pretty  good. I changed the serving size to 4. I substituted the eggs with Bob's Red Mill Egg replacer (1 1/2 Tablespoons) and instead of milk I used soy milk. I also used Earth Balance soy butter instead of regular, substituted white sugar for brown for the topping and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter. It turned out excellent. Fluffy with a soft texture to it that melts in my mouth.Not too sweet but sweet enough. This one is a keeper. Thank you!

An easy recipe.  My husband loved it so much, he was bragging to my brother.  So my brother is going to trade some carpentry work for this.  It probably helped that I had fresh blueberries from Oregon.
