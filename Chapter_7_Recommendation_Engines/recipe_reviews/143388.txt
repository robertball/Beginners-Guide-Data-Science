If done right this soup is SUPER YUMMY!  First, I made my own veggie broth with chopped up carrots, celery and onion.  I added an all natural chicken base to it but you could just add some salt too.  I also used Thai Kitchen brand red curry paste.  I was assuming this is something like what the recipe called for.  Last but not least I doubled the fresh ginger.  Used a stick blender to blend so I didn't have to pour it into a belnder.  AMAZING!!!! Just a note...most brands of "lite" coconut milk is just watered down coconut milk.  If you want "lite" just use a little less of the coconut milk and add water.  Save money!

The ease of preparation for this soup made it better yet! The blend of flavors that tingled the tastebuds was a delight. The taste was very exotic. I would add another teaspoon of cumin for more zip. But overall, a very good and different twist to a soup.

Served this chilled and then heated the leftovers - both ways are tasty.  I took the advise of other reviewers - I didn't change the amount of coconut milk, but used equal amounts of "light" coconut milk and regular coconut milk. Thank you!

Now this is some good soup! I do agree that it needs some salt and pepper, and I cut back on the ginger a bit since 1t a bit much for my taste. I also use canned coconut cream which is way richer than coconut milk - a little goes a long way. Like all soups I make, I find that they are much better if you make them a day ahead. Thanks, sourpony!

Big disappointment!  I followed the recipe exactly thinking it would be a delicious, flavorful soup.  It was expensive- 7 cups of coconut milk is a lot at $2 a can! Fresh cilantro, broth-it easily cost me $15 to make.  The taste is bland and boring and not at all tangy like I wanted.

We really enjoyed this soup. I had to sub in chicken boullion for the vegetable broth due to forgetfulness at the store, but I just eliminated any salt from the seasoning. I would recommend the low fat coconut milk too even though the richness suffers just a little.

Excellent soup - great blend of flavours.  I used light coconut milk and cut down on the amount used by half to make it lower in fat.   I also increased the amount of ginger considerably.  yummy!

Desperately needed some salt & pepper, but once they were added, the soup was quite good. Nice texture and hearty.

I made this as a light dinner and it was an instant hit.  I used 7 cups coconutmilk (the dairy replacement not the canned stuff) and left out the broth just because we prefer these types of soups on the thicker side.  So good, so simple, so healthy, but with so much flavor and I really loved the idea of using milk replacement options for recipes like this.

I was skeptical about this, as I was worried it might taste like curry, and it didn't.  This is a great soup recipe.  I used the version from All Recipes magazine, which had 5 1/2 cup low sodium vegetable broth and 1 can of coconut milk, which seems more logical than 7 cups of coconut milk, and had a 20 minute cook time after you put the broth and coconut milk in.  I did cut the onion down to half, but it was still really good and will probably add the second one next time I make it.   I used an immersion blender and it was very smooth and not as messy.

This was truly delicious!!  I added extra cumin and ginger and I only had 5 1/2 cups of coconut milk. I had one sweet potato and one regular white I used them both and It turned out fabulous!  My whole family ranted and raved about it!  I'm making this for my thanksgiving meal for extended family and friends.

I only used 40.5 oz of coconut milk. Buying five cans of coconut milk seemed absurd, but three was reasonable.
I didn't add anymore liquid to the soup and thought that all the flavors were very muted.  I preferred it hot, my partner preferred it cold.
If I were to make it again I would add a red bell pepper, more chili paste, more ginger, and less onion.

This was sublime! I reduced the chili by half and it had the perfect amount of heat. (still too spicy for the kids though.) I added shrimp also... seemed like a nice touch.

I just made this soup to use up the ingredients I had on hand and thought it was delicious.  I had to substitute cauliflower for potato because I follow a low carb diet but other than that I pretty much followed the recipe. I also had to substitute curry powder for cumin which I enjoyed.

1/15/15: I think there was too much coconut milk in this recipe; even using half regular and half light coconut milk, it was too rich for me. Next time I would use half of the coconut milk, and use more vegetable broth for the rest of the liquid.  I also thought it needed some salt and more spice. I would add more chile paste next time. 
*2/17/16 update:* made again with 1 can each of regular and light coconut milk, and made up the difference in liquid w vegetable broth.  I forgot to bump up the spices so I made it as written for that part, but I still think it needs a bit more. Adding some cayenne pepper powder to a bowl before serving helps a lot.  I thought the creaminess was about right, though, with these changes.

Very tasty and freezes well.  I used a 1/2 cup less of coconut milk because I ran out and it was still very thick (which we like).  Using a blender gives it a smooth consistency.

Has the base of being a super soup but the quanity it ends up making dilutes the flavour. I followed the recipe, tasted it and I was disappointed, it seriously was lacking flavour. Soo I doubled up on chilli and garlic,  tripled the ginger and cumin. I also added fish sauce (not necessary but it added depth) and added about 3 stalks of lemongrass (3 tbl spoons). Now it has the perfect balance.
