This pork loin was great, but it took nearly and hour to cook using the "indirect heat".  Also, I read on another website to sear each side of the tenderloin on high heat (gas grill) for one minute on each side before using the indirect heat.  The searing made the loin have a great crust that helped make it very moist and tender!

Delicious!  I was tempted to leave the honey out of the sauce because we don't like 'honey mustard' but we barely tasted the sweetness.  Marinated tenders for 3 days.  Very tasty crispy outside from grilling.

I doubled the marinade for two 1 lb. pork loins, which worked perfectly. I only marinaded for 4 hours, which flavored the pork plenty. I wrapped each loin in foil to put on the grill, but "indirect heat" did not cook well... After 30-45 minutes, I moved the pork directly over the heat and for another 10-15 minutes I removed the foil to get a nice crust on the outside. Everyone loved the flavor of the pork ("best pork I've ever had!") and loved the mustard sauce. Would definitley make this again.

This was a tasty and simple meal- I  can imagine it as a great appetizer for a party or sports event also, although I made if for dinner with an artichoke and some garlic bread.  I did make a few minor changes using what I had at home since I was looking for a new marinade for pork loin that I already had in the freezer. I only cooked half of the loin, it probably weighed about a pound. In the marinade I added sesame oil that i had and no sesame seeds. My boyfriend isn't a big fan of horseradish and so he just mixed up yellow mustard with some Spike (seasoning) and hot sauce (Tapatio). This was an amazing dipping sauce I will use again. Also I seared the loin in a stainless steal pan on the stove top about 2.5 minutes a side and then baked it in the oven in a glass Pyrex at 350 for about 30 mins (160 degrees). It was delicious and juicy. Try it tonight, sure to impress!

This marinade is awesome!!!  I was only able to marinade about 4 hours but it was still so flavorful!  The sauce was good, I would do more honey next time for my taste.  Great recipe!

Loved this marinade!  Cooked it on the grill on high to sear the meat, then turned down the heat and cooked for another 20-30 minutes.  Was fabulous..my husband was eating the leftovers for breakfast the next day!  Tastes as good or better than any great restaurant!

Unreal!!!  i made this last night for a 4th of July BBQ I was invited to and it was the only meat dish that was all eaten.  This pork is delish!!  Expecially with the hot mustard sauce.  You can make the mustard as hot as you like, and the longer you marinade the pork, well, the better it is.  Thanks for a super recipe.

Easy recipe with great flavors - will probably make the hot mustard alone a regular go-to sauce for many other recipes and meals. Thanks!

This went over fantastic with my family for dinner! My daughter didn't care for the hot mustard, but the pork is great without it. Using the indirect heat it took longer than the recipe said it should... but other than that it was perfect.

Only made the mustard as I was needing something quick to spruce up a ham and I happened to have those three things on hand.  Yum-o!

I am only rating the hot mustard sauce for this recipe because I was looking for one and there aren't any on this site to use for sliced BBQ Pork I'm serving for Superbowl.  The mustard sauce is spot on and awesome!  Can't wait to try the entire recipe.

This came out relly good. Didn't have any honey for the marinade, so I substituted molasses. Came out great!

This was incredibly good and so easy to make considering the limited amount of ingredients used.  I accidentally added the sesame seeds to the mustard sauce instead of sprinkling them on the pork but it didn't matter.  Also, only marinated for an hour and it was still very juicy and flavorful.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!
