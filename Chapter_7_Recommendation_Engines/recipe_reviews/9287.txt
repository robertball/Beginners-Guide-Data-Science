I tried this fruitcake in the last minute before Xmas. I substituted the sugar with rum-flavoured brown sugar and the result was fantastic. I baked two loaves and they disappeared within a day!
Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe!

This is the first fruit cake that I have ever baked.  I know it is not Christmas, but I love fruit cake and this was the only recipe that I could find that did not have brandy or rum in it and it is the best.  I can't stop eating it.

I am NOT a cook having to learn after my wife's death. But this recipe was easy to follow and it was FANTASTIC. It tasted like the fruit cake I have always eaten growing up.

The best easy fruitcake recipe.  
Last year I had to make this cake three times before Christmas because we love it so much.  I've already today baked one today as my hubby requested it for Thanksgiving.

delicious! Even a non-fruitcake eater would like this. I agree that this is best after it has set a day or two to make it moist.  I subbed the lemon with an orange instead. added the zest of one orange and 2 tsp juice.  The butter really makes it so good. I toasted the nuts first for a nicer level of flavor. I don't think the parchment is necessary and wouldn't bother to use it again. Made this in 2 bread tins to give away and had 1 small mini loaf for myself:)  the batter is more like dough but easy to work with.

I made it just as written the first time. The author is right that you can eat it the same day. It smelled wonderful baking. We liked it so well that I had to bake another one. This time I decided to experiment with it and do what my grandmother used to do. I mixed a simple syrup with a mixture of whiskey, brandy and rum and brushed it all over the cake. Then I wrapped it up in plastic wrap then foil and put it in a tin and placed in a cool place to age. I repeated with the liquor again and let it sit a couple of weeks. It tasted wonderful to my family and friends. Now, I need to go to Publix and purchase the ingredients to make this for Christmas!??

This cake is really yummy! Couple things, though. . .I used orange zest and juice cuz I like a sweet cake, not too sharply citrus. (Does that make sense?) But the biggest thing is 2 hours is WAY too long to bake!! I baked mine 1 hour and 20 minutes. The toothpick was clean so I took it out. It was totally done. I will actually check it a little sooner than 80 minutes next time. If you baked this for 2 hours, you will have a dry crumbly mess. Don't hesitate to try this recipe, especially for Christmas!

I have never made fruitcake before so I followed the directions EXACTLY. The cake was dry and crumbly. I cooked it for two hours per the instructions and it was way toooo long. I was very disappointed. The batter was amazingly good. We loved the batter, so I will try making it again and cutting the time in half at least!

This recipe is exactly the recipe my grandmother made.The only change I make is substituting pecans for walnuts and adding a 1/2 tsp of mace.  I also only bake it for 1 h 45mins.

Very flavorful cake...however DO NOT BAKE FOR 2 HOURS....WAAAAY too much.  Next time I will only bake for an hour and maybe 10 minutes.  There are expensive ingredients in this cake, it is such a shame that it came out so dry and crumbly.

My husband loved it! Because the 2 of us are diabetic I made substitutions to the recipe:
1 C each Golden & Cranberry raisins
1 C cut mix dried fruits 
1 C cut Persian dates
1/2 C cut Candied pineapple
1 C chopped walnuts
1 C each Almond flour, All-Purpose flour & Golden-Flaxseed-Meal
1 1/4 C Splenda baking white sugar mix
Rest of the ingredients as called by the recipe 
Reduced baking time to 1 hr. for 10 mini loaves
Rest of the recipe as the original.
9 loaves are wrapped & aging in a tin, 
1 already eaten by my husband. He could/did not want to wait.

Using the recipe as my base I know that I will be able to create others and have them be just as delicious as the model.
Thank you!
Happy Holidays!
