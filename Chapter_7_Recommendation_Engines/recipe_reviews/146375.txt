For the turkey I use Pavo de Salvadoreano (10 lb Turkey, 8 Roma Tomatoes, 1 Green Pepper, 1 can stewed tomatoes, ½ yellow onion, ¼ cup green pumpkin seeds, 1 dried pasilla ancho chile, 10 oz pimento filled green olives, ¼ tsp Cumin, 1 Tbsp Oregano Broil green pepper and Roma tomato. Remove skins. In blender blend Roma’s, green pepper, stewed tomatoes, onion, pumpkin seeds, pasilla ancho, cumin, oregano. Season Turkey with black pepper and cumin. Sear Turkey. Place in roasting pan and pour salsa over turkey With spoon add olives to salsa. Bake recommended time for size of your turkey) I then shred the turkey and place in a toasted roll. I mix mayo with my curtido (cabbage, carrot, onion) slice my tomato, cucumber and radish thin. I add watercrest as well. then i put a little sauce from the turkey over the filling. PERFECT! My slim hubby can down 3 of these. and all my kids love them (made to their own preference). Enjoy!

Made these sandwiches and thought they where good. They are messy so be prepared. My husband and daughter enjoyed them also. Instead of cutting up the cabbage I bought a bag of coleslaw mix which already had carrots in it so I used that. Worked out great. I still put in water like recipe says. Will make again. My daughter said I should get a job a subway told her I will pass. Thanks for the recipe.

This would have been four stars with the key addition of salt! Try it first, then salt it to taste is my advice. I wanted to make these without turkey leftovers and without roasting a turkey, so I used a rotisserie chicken. I prepped all of the ingredients the night before, but (silly me) I also did them tomato. As you might guess, tomato does not take kindly to being cut ahead of time.

I'm sorry but i did not care for this. I'm salvadorian and this is not the way you make it. The only part that is okay is the curtido.
