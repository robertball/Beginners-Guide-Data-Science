I'm good friends with the the submitter of the recipe and the site gave the wrong proportions,much to her alarm. You make this with 2 cups mayo, 2 cups shredded swiss cheese and 2 cups vidalia or any sweet onion (NOT all those onions it says to use!!!)No wonder some people thought it was nasty. It's to die for when it's made correctly! I hope those people who had bad experiences will try it again.

We could not stop eating this dip!  Next time I will put it into a crock pot to keep warm throughout the party.

I substituted 8oz (1 brick) of cream cheese for half the mayo and used both parmesan (FRESHLY GRATED - not powdered ) and swiss cheeses.  The parmesan added a nice kick of flavor and I think that all swiss would have been too bland.

Be sure to chop the onions medium-fine or it takes a lot longer for the onions to cook.

I got a variation of this recipe from my good friend Karen and I love it!  She uses:
3 onions, 
2 c mayo, 
2 c shredded swiss, 
1 8 oz can choped water chestnuts, 
1/4 c dry white wine, 
1 minced garlic glove, 
1/2 tsp hot sauce.   

It is a fabulous recipe. There is always a crowd hovering over this dip at parties.

A friend of mine calls this recipe "Cuppa, Cuppa, Cuppa" as in "a cup of Vidalia onions, a cup of mayonnaise, a cup of swiss cheese."  (Or in this recipe's case, two cups of each!)  I made this last night for Monday Night Football and it was a crowd favorite!  Use a sturdy cracker for this dip - - regular tortilla chips just snapped when you scooped.  Can't wait to try the leftover reheated tonight!

I've been making this a party staple ever since snagging the recipe from a friend years ago.  This is THE BEST and it's so easy.  The rater who said "cuppa, cuppa, cuppa" made me laugh, because that's how I remember the recipe when I asked.  Equal parts swiss, mayo, and sweet onions.  I use light mayo and it's still yummy.  Great w/crusty french bread.

GREASY, GREASY, GREASY! I was very embarrased last night when this came out of the oven in front of all of my guests. Everyone kept asking how much butter I put into the dip. This dip was nothing but a huge puddle of grease. The ingredients seperated and it was just a mess. Needless to say, I had TONS left because no one really wanted to eat a big pile of greasy mess.

Love this dip, use low fat Hellman's mayo instead of full fat and it won't be so greasy.

I love this dip; I'm making it right now.  To reduce the greasiness, I use half real sour cream (not fat free)and half real Hellman's mayo.  I also add about 4 turns of my pepper and salt mills.  To reduce onion smell/tears while I'm making this, I put the cheese in a mixing bowl, season it with salt and pepper and stir it up with my hands, add the sour cream/mayo mixture and stir everything up well, and THEN cut the onions and quickly fold them into the cheese/mayo/sour cream mixture.  I also like the recipe as is and I am really thankful to adodd for posting it--so delicious! Great with bread, crackers, and even Doritoes.  I simply can't imagine making this with anything but real mayo--I never touch lite or reduced fat mayo, and I would certainly never make this with miracle whip because it seems like the flavor would be off.  The sour cream reduces the greasiness without changing the flavor base.  Thanks again!

This was quick and easy to make. I ate this warm. I thought the 2 cups of mayo was going to be too much so I added more like 1.5 cups and it was great. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

Very, very yummy and totally delish!  Makes a ton of dip, enough for 8 persons Chistmas eve and Christmas day!  Followed the recipe exactly except used 3 onions (mine were pretty big) and garnished with a sprinkle of paprika on top for color.  Served with cocktail rye, carrot chips, and pita chips.  Really easy, thanks for sharing!

The taste is wonderful. I had this at a potluck at work and had to get the recipe from my coworker (her only difference is to add a little parm. cheese with the swiss). I do agree with one of the other users...this recipe does produce A LOT of grease. Just drain it as much as you can.

I agree with some reviewers - it's gets greasy but it's so good!  Definitely not for dieters.  I also sprinkle paprika on mine.  We have served it with Fritos Scoops (even worse for you!) or tortilla chips.

I used 1 cup of vidalia onions, 1 cup of mayo & 1 cup of swiss cheese. Sprinkled a little bit of parsley flakes on top before baking for a little visual appeal. This goes really well w/ corn chips.

This recipe is so simple and it is wonderful! I used approx. 2 cups grated onion, 2 cups shredded swiss cheese and only 1 cup mayonnaise.  It is excellent if served with fresh baguette slices.  Always a crowd pleaser!!!

Wish I could give it less than a complete star. Should have trusted my instincts. Hot mayonnaise just turned to oil. Bland flavors floating in a sea of grease.

I read one review that said they have nicknamed this dip "baked fat".  Well that is pretty accurate...it produced a lot of grease.  I took it to my in-laws and it was hardly touched.  Those that did taste it said the flavor was alright, but the grease was too much.

Not horrible, just bland. After the first few bites I added cooking sherry, fresh ground pepper, & cajun seasoning which helped a little. Perfect texture for dip though so will probably make again with minor tweaks in seasoning.

I followed the advice of others and used 1.5 cups kraft light mayo (other ingredients unchanged) and it turned out great! It just started to brown on top at 20 minutes, which was perfect. It is best hot, but still good once it's cooled. Another reviewer mentioned that it's not the prettiest, and maybe it doesn't pop on the party table, but once people began to try it, word spread and it disappeared quickly! I also used a metal 8x8, not glass, which may have helped it cook more evenly.

I followed this recipe exactly, and while we really liked the flavor I did find it a little on the runny side.  I will make again, but maybe sub some sour cream for cream cheese to thicken it up.  Over all a hit though!

I made this for my nephew's birthday party yesterday and it was a huge hit. I added some Mozzerella Cheese as another reviewer suggested, it came out awesome! I also used my food processor with the slicing blade in order to reduce the prep time.

I have had this before at other parties and thought it was delicious.  Yes, a bit greasy but it's cheese and mayo, so I was not alarmed.  It's easy to make and I usually have the ingredients on hand making a quick fix.  I DO prefer the onions to be finely chopped.  My were a touch course.  It will be finer next time.  Love it!

I followed the suggestions to only use the two large onions and I used miricle whip.... It all got eaten.  I think next time I will try it with mayo and I'm anxious to try it with vadalias!!

Great dip recipe, I suggest using a shallow dish to back it in.  I used a mexican cheese mix, with white sweet onions and nacho chips to dip it, everyone loved it.  I will make this again, thanks!

This dish tastes wonderful. The only drawback is an enormous amount of grease.

This is a really tasty recipe. However, I did have to keep it in the oven for longer than the time specified. You just have to watch it until it really starts to brown and bubble. I made it a second time with two cups of onions and it turned out awesome. It does not require four whole onions. I used about 2 big Vidalias and it was great! Definitely a keeper! You won't be disappointed and neither will your guests!!!! Really delicious!!!!

I love this recipe but I hollow out a loaf of French bread and put the dip inside and bake it. The bread shell soaks up the greasiness, it's always a great hit!

The dip was truly delish; people loved it at our New Years gathering.  I was wondering if I did something wrong though because as it sat on the buffet table the top started forming puddles of what looked like melted butter (am assuming it is the fat from the cheese and mayo)...has anybody else experienced this?  Maybe a crock pot to keep it warm throughout night might conceal the fats?  I don't know...any suggestions?  Was very yummy even if it is bad for me!!

Been making this for years- it's great.  I usually sprinkle some paprika on top for color.  Serve with club crackers. Great! I notice the brand of mayo makes a difference on the oil/grease factor.  I usually use hellmans but used Kraft last night and it turned out great- not too oily at all.  I think I'll use Kraft from now on.  Great stuff!

When company arrives unexpected, or if I am short on time this recipe is a super time saver, in and out of the oven in no time.  Many people have asked for the recipe.  I have tried it with many cheeses I have had on hand and the swiss cheese is the best, in my opinion

Everyone loved this.  However, I changed it up a bit based on the reviews.  Here it goes: 1 cup lite mayo, 2 cups chopped sweet onions, sprinkle of garlic powder
1 cup shredded swiss, 1/4 cup apricot preserves.


A little explanation:  I didn't use parm because I forgot and it turned out great.
I used garlic powder becuase I didn't have garlic salt. Yes, it was a bit greasy, but I took some paper towels and soaked it up. As far as the apricot preserves, I know it sounds wierd, but I heard someone mention it in a review (maybe on another similar recipe).  I was hesitant, but intrigued, so I tried it on half and everyone loved it so much that I put it on the rest.  I just stirred it until somewhat smooth and spread it on the top of the dip after it was done baking.  The sweet/salty combo is out of this world!

Smelled good while baking, but my husband and I couldn't get past the grease.  I drained off what I could, but it still overwhelmed the dip, both visually and taste.  Luckly, I tried this before a girls happy hour at my house this coming week.  Might try again with fat-free mayo and low fat swiss cheese...but not for girls night.

My mother got this recipe years ago at an office party, and I hadn't made it in years until this Christmas.  I had my office over for a cup of holiday cheer, and they devoured it!  I too have the "cuppa, cuppa, cuppa" recipe, and it couldn't be simpler to make!  I like it best with plain or rye Triscuits.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it.  I didn't find it greasy at all.  I did put it in two small round baking dishes about 5 inches across.  I used 3 medium vadallia onions.  Will make it again!

One reviewer said this creates a lot of grease. I didn't find that to be the case. I used Miracle Whip "lite" instead of regular mayo. If you have access to Vidalia onions, by all means, USE THEM in this recipe. I also only used two onions and kept it in the oven longer than the recipe stated. I let the dish bake, then sprinkled some sweet paprika over the top and broiled it for a few minutes. This really is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I hollow out a round pumpernickel loaf, pour mix in it and bake it in the bread. All the blended flavors are absorbed into the bread and it’s easy to pull pieces of bread off!

I love this dip.  Super fast and easy.  Great if you need a last minute dish to take along.  
I agree it does get very greasy.  Just pour it off.  
I'm wondering if anyone has tried any add ins...Bacon?  Hot Sauce?  Just for something different.  I have not and wouldn't want to ruin a good thing.

The recipe is great but 400 degrees is too high a temp. It makes the mayo separate & causes greasiness. Bake at 300-325 as in other similar recipes and you'll really enjoy the difference.

Not too bad for a 3 ingredient, quick and easy dip.  The ingredients together didn't sound very appealing but I had to try it.  I served on toasted french bread.  It wasn't the most attractive of dips, kind of curdled looking, however, it had a decent taste.  Although this probably won't be a regular made recipe at the house, it is is quick and easy backup for those times when you have unexpected guests and need to whip up something fast.

Delicious! We had ours with sun chips. The only thing I didn't like was as it cools it gets oily. What can you expect though.

I didn't measure the amount of mayo I used. When it looked right I continued with the recipe. I added a few seasonings and used asiago cheese. Big hit at our party and thanks!
