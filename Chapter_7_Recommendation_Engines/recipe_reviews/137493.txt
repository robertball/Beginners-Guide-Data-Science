I wanted a spaghetti sauce that had some pizzaz and not the same traditional flavor and this is it! Easy to prepare and the wine gave it a unique flavor. Sure to be a hit with your guests! The memory stays with you long after the meal is over.

Yum =)
I use hot Italian sausage, diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil, cream instead of milk, and I add about 2-3 crushed cloves of garlic while it simmers as well as approx 1 1/2 tsp of dried basil, few good cracks of fresh ground pepper and a roasted red pepper for a sweet little zing! To cut down on the "soupiness" that others had complained about I drain my meat really well after it has all been browned and I make sure that the cream really reduces before adding the wine and that the wine (only use 1/2 cup) really reduces before adding the tomatoes. I think this really helps as my sauce always turns out thick and hearty!  
I have been searching now for a good 2 or 3 years and have finally found my go-to spaghetti sauce recipe!!

i don't usually leave reviews, but this one was AWESOME!  i added some frozed peppers (red green & yellow), fresh sliced portabello mushrooms, and one more can of diced tomatoes.  Over whole wheat pasta spirals and fresh baked bread (from the store, i didn't bake it myself) this was WONDERFUL!!!

I changed a few items in this recipe - I used turkey sausage and a red drinking wine instead of the cooking wine.  While everything was simmering, I decided to add italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a small can of tomato sauce. After the extra additions, this recipe was even better.

This recipe was GREAT!!! My husband and I both loved the wonderful taste, my husband is very picky and usually I hear "it's ok" but this time he told me he loved it. I didnt change the recipe too much all I added was portebello mushrooms.

The Sauce was a hit with everyone but I found it to be too mild and a tad bit too soupy. In my Opinion, the 28 oz can of Tomatoes was a little too much. I think next time I will throw in some more sausage and more Seasonings.

Very easy to make, and it was a hit with my family.  I did add some fresh basil while simmering, and lots of fresh chopped garlic.....Very nice, and sticks to the pasta!

This sauce was a little mild, thus I added some spices to make it better.

This is a really good spaghetti sauce recipe.

I included saut√©ed mushrooms and used precooked Turkey meatballs rather than the meat that was recommended.

Not much more difficult than how I used to make spaghetti from a jar sauce, but 10 times better!

This recipe was pretty good.  If cooking for two, I recommend cutting it in half.  It made more than we could eat.  I added a few extra items..salt, pepper, garlic, mushrooms, and basil.  The sauce had a nice wine taste, not overpowering as I was afraid it might be.  Overall, a different twist to spaghetti and was a nice change.

Good meaty sauce with more complexity of taste than your typical meat sauce. Ease of preparation is also a plus. I used 1/2 cup of milk, and 1/2 cup of cream - it was not soupy at all.

I gave this a five it was fantastic! My family has told me that if they see a can of an spaghetti sauce in the house they will throw it away. Recipe is deffinitly a keeper. I did not have tomato paste so I substituted with tomato juice and some ketchup. The secret to this recipe is to cook it on low for a good 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours. We loved it!

I have been using this recipe as my staple spaghetti recipe for a year now. I am suprised that there are not more reviews for this. I also noticed that it is hard to find in the search unless you scroll through the 100s of spaghetti recipes. The only thing i change is to use fresh basil, rosemary, parsley, fennel, and garlic and to simmer for one hour. If you make this a day ahead, it makes for a better sauce! Thanks so much for my favorite spaghetti sauce.

I had a spaghetti craving and came across this recipe.  I liked the idea of sausage so I gave it a try.  I used spicy sausage and ground turkey (to make it a bit healthier).  I couldn't help but throw in a few other things ( basil, garlic, salt/pepper) during cooking.  Since I only had non fat milk I threw in some whole milk ricotta cheese.  I'm not sure if that did anything but over all this recipe turned out amazing.  It was meaty and flavorful.  The bf and I were eating it plain after the noodles ran out it was so good!

This sauce was so good!  My entire family loved it.  I did add quite a bit of tomato sauce to it to make it a more liquid consistency.  Highly recommend this!

Very good.  Eliminated the milk, increased the wine to 1 cup.  Added 1 tsp. oregano, 2 tsp. basil. Even better the second day!

This was delicious! I am not usually a fan of spaghetti but the sauce was so thick and flavorful I couldn't stop eating it. I left out the stewed tomatoes because I don't care for them and I added about a half cup of water and doubled the tomato paste. Turned out beautifully. This will definitely be a repeat recipe.

I thought this was really good - when I ate the leftovers.  Fresh off the stove it seemed really salty, but this meal freezes really well so it's great for work lunches.  Really yummy!  I love the combination of sausage and beef.

hubby thought it needed a spice--daughter LOVED it (after picking out the tomato chunks)...and the mom? i simmered this for hours to soften up the tomato...maybe i just don't LIKE bolognese. this was a first time effort for me.

Very good and easy to make!  I made the recipe as is (without the sausage) but I might try some suggestions from the other reviewers.  It doesn't have an overly "Italian" taste but it's very savory and sure to please most palates.
