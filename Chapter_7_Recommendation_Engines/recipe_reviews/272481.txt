I made it exactly as directed except I used asian pears instead of peaches. (seasonal exchange) It came out great, even my husband enjoyed it and he's not a fan of goat cheese normally. The sweetness of the pears balanced out the tartness of the goat cheese and the arugula made it seem more substantial and fresher than just cheese bread. Will definitely make again.
