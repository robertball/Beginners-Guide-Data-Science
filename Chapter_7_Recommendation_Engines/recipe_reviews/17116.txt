This is an excellent glaze, I have used it for years.  The only differences is that I add a little mustard to the glaze.

This is a wonderful recipe for ham.  I did add some ground cloves and dijon mustard to the pineapple juice mixture and it gave the ham a great flavor.  I would definitely use this again.

Quick, easy and really permeates into the meat. My father in law thought it was from a "Ham Company" since it was so flavorful. Nice way to jazz up a ham.

YUMMY! However, I jazzed it up a bit by adding all of the pineapple and marachino cherry juice to the brown sugar...also added a tiny bit of clove and a bit of honey. This ham was AWESOME:)

This is an excellent glaze that provides a wonderful flavor - this was the first ham I've ever made and it was a huge hit with my husband and my in-laws.  My mother-in-law wants me to make this for Christmas dinner!  Excellent taste and not hard at all.

I made this for Christmas dinner, much better than regular ham! I omitted the cherries, great even as left overs. And I didn't even like ham...

This is a very simple yet delicious glaze for ham.  I used this at Thanksgiving and my ham came out fantastic.  Before baking my ham I did make an additional glaze using maybe 1/2 cup dark corn syrup, 1/4 cup honey, and 1/4 cup brown sugar and I coated the ham with this prior to sticking it in the oven.  Then I used the pineapple glaze for basting as the recipe instructs you to do.  It was the best ham ever. There weren't a lot of leftovers and we quickly wiped those out by having ham and biscuits for breakfast!!!!

I've made this glaze a few times and it never thickens up (since I use a 20oz. can of pineapple), so I had to improvise. Instead I poked holes in the ham, put the cherries and pineapples on with toohtpicks then place the ham in a turkey size oven bag (poke holes in the top) and put it in a glass pan. I cook it for an hour, open the bag, then baste the ham every 15 mins or so. This is the BEST ham I ever had! The bag keeps it super moist and there is plenty of glaze/sauce left over for after slicing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This is a great recipe. Can be used on pork or turkey ham. I used the same ingredients but the only thing I did differently was slow boil the ham in the pineapple juice prior to baking it. Drain the ham from the juice and use the same juice for the glaze. This way the ham is baking with the pineapple flavor already in it..... . I also added ground cloves to the glaze. This gives it a burst of flavor.

Easy, beautiful and DELICIOUS!  I did this with a pre-cooked pre-spiral sliced ham from Safeway and it turned out fantastic.  The spiral sliced hams absorb the glaze nicely.  Easiest Christmas entree ever!

I made this for my family for Christmas and it was very delicious. It was very easy too.  I did add some of the maraschino cherry juice to the reserved pineapple juice.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas lunch, and many people asked for the recipe.  It was super easy to make and the ham was very tasty.  I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added a little dijon mustard and cloves to the glaze.  Also I couldn't find maraschino cherries so ended up using canned papaya, and used  some of the papaya juice in the glaze, was still good!

My family likes this recipe very much.  We tend to like a little twange to our ham glaze, so i added a little mustard and ketchup.  It takes a little bit of the sweetness away, but adds just enough wow to balance everything out.

At last minute for Easter dinner, I had to use crushed pineapples and some maple praline syrup. Had no cherries! I purreed the pinapple and cooked it with the brown sugar and syrup, i also added a splash of light syrup frommed canned sweet potato . The glaze was awesome! The ham came out moist and we had a delicious dipping sauce. The pineapple falvor just gives it that extra kick. Everyone enjoyed the ham amd liked the flavor

This is a simple, classic and no-fail recipe. Only thing I added is some corn syrup as I didn't have enough brown sugar. It was my first time to bake ham with a glaze this Christmas. My family loved it! Even my son, who is a picky eater, asked for seconds. I'll certainly be making this again!

This glaze was great.  I served it for Mother's Day and got rave reviews.  I had to add more brown sugar to thicken the glaze because I used a 20 oz can of pineapple, but it turned out great.

Very good and VERY easy. I left out the maraschino cherries - maybe that made a difference between 4 and 5 stars. I did make extra to pour over the ham after it was sliced and it was great.

Very good flavor.  However, most of it drained to the bottomof the pan instead of sticking on the ham like I had hoped for.

Loved it, the family loved it.  the liquid from the pineapple glaze was so good, you have to make more just to pour over the meat after slicing.  Next time I will make more sauce

This glaze was easy, but not enough flavor for me. Just too sweet for my taste. The cherries were the best part. Had to add more brown sugar to make a thicker glaze.

I only had a few minutes to make a glaze, for Christmas dinner and I'd never made a ham before. This one sounded the easiest! But as I went through the pantry I discovered that I only had pineapple tidbits, so I just used the juice from the can and the brown sugar, then I added the pineapple as a side dish on the table. This came out so well my hubby didn't even know that I'd made the glaze myself! He thought it had come with the ham!!! Way to Go! thanx for making me look good! :)

The glaze was good, but the pineapple and cherries fell off throughout cooking and burned on the bottom of the pan. The pineapple that didn't fall off before, fell off instantly after I took the toothpicks out. I won't make this again.

I used this glaze on a spiral sliced ham. It turned out wonderfully. The cherries ended up being candied in the process. Everyone kept eating them before I could even get the ham on the table. I made this for Easter dinner.

I have used this glaze on hams a couple of times, and each time the flavor added to the ham is wonderful. This glaze is very thin, but I have enough to spoon it over the ham a few times. Enough of it sticks to the have to produce a wonderful glaze and flavor. As another reviewer mentioned, I also add a little Dijon mustard to the glaze mix. Since I never have enough pineapple juice from the can of pineapple slices, I always add a little orange juice.  I will use this glaze for any hams I make from here on.

The ham was moist and deliciously flavored. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it was not overly sweet at all. Will add this recipe to our regular rotation! The kids loved it!

Yup! This is just about the same recipe I use every year. Although I use the liquid I boil the ham with...to get a salty/sweet/sour flavor.  Family loves it.

Wonderful and absolutely delicious glaze.  Added a pinch of ground cloves and a dash of maraschino cherry juice.  Reduced on the stove for about 10 minutes.   Used this glaze on a Hatfield boneless ham.

Exactly the simple recipe I was looking for. My mother always used  whole cloves too. I'll use either whole after scoring my ham or use powered cloves when I microwave the glaze.
