I am continually frustrated by people who provide a rating for a recipe but yet state that they "changed some of the ingredients".  They are not providing a review for the listed recipe, but instead one of their own.

I did try the Mediterranean Seafood Salad and prepared it exactly as specified.  It is excellent and doesn't need to be changed in any way.  It is very tasty and I'll be using this recipe again.

excellent  wouldn't change a thing.   I cant believe people give a low rating    after they have not followed the recipe.  Those people should keep their comments to themselves or send their own recipes in. Jt's rude

I would actually give this one about 3.5 stars but am rounding up due to the rating scale.  The recipe was better than store bought salads and was on par with decent restaurant food.  There was WAAAAYYYY too much mayo used in the recipe.  Next time I would cut the mayo down to about 1 cup, maybe even 3/4 of a cup.  There also wasn't enough pasta to balance out the abundant amount of mayo.  If you are going to keep the mayonaisse the same I would add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of dried pasta.  If you bring the mayo down I would still add about another 1/4 cup of pasta.  The taste was good for an imitation crab salad.  The Worcestershire and hot sauce give it a nice tang.  If you want more spice I would hold up on the hot sauce and add more dijon or Worcestershire instead, they will give it a kick with a stronger flavor.  If you just want that burning on your tounge sensation go with the hot sauce or add a couple teaspoons of minced raw onion.  With a few changes I believe this recipe could be a solid 4 (perhaps higher).

This was pretty good. I did make some adjustments for my family. Instead of Catelina dressing I used Ranch. I also added 1/2 cup sour cream.

Very good!  I added Thousand Island dressing instead of Catalina.  I didn't use dijon mustard, I used yellow.  I didn't add the olives or the cheese.  It's pretty basic, but I think that my kids and my guests are going to enjoy this with a lettuce salad.

I actually made this with Ranch like a previously mentioned comment and it was NASTY. I'm pregnant and the smell was horrendous and lingered in my kitchen and fridge for days.  It might have just been me... but you've been warned!

Very good. I used Greek Vinagrette for the dressing instead. Gotta love feta cheese and oregano.

I've made this lots of times....one of my fav. things to make! I slice my olives & add Miracle Whip instead of Mayonnaise...i've never added the Dijon mustard b/c I don't have it around but it didn't taste like anything was missing. I always use the crab meat. VERY GOOD RECIPE, Thanks for sharing!!!

Really good salad! Reading other reviews I imagine trading in the Catalina dressing for Ranch is not recommended.

Made as written before making any changes and I didn't like at all.  After changes this is a 3+ star recipe, but still not outstanding.  First of all, I thought the textural contrast between the rest of the salad and the cubes of cheddar was a little weird.  The flavor wasn't bad, but if I were to make again I'd use shredded cheddar.  Way too much mayo, would cut in half next time.  I ended up adding 2 tsp Sriracha, 1 tsp Sambal Oelek, 1 tsp black pepper, an additioanal tsp worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and 1/2 tsp parsley.

The taste was ok. I did not like the imitation crab. I think the lobster may have worked better.
