These were really good. I did bake them instead of grilling. I put them on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet and baked at 400 for 35 minutes. They came out really good. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I cut up the bacon and cooked it crisp, and rolled it inside with the cheese instead of on the outside, and baked it in the oven. My husband said it's a hit- especially good with a ranch dressing!

This was an excellent recipe. I cooked my bacon half way and used it to keep the cheese and peppers inside the chicken using toothpicks. I will make this again, but I don't think I will ever cook on the grill because of the other reviewers problems with the bacon grease smoking up the grill.

This recipe was amazing! We have 5 children from 9 - 3 and they all liked it. We did two things a bit different. First we used Jalapeno/Monteray Jack cheese in the middle instead of a jalapeno, because of the kids. Second, we wrapped two or three pieces of bacon, two wrapped the length and one wrapped around the middle to make sure the cheese wouldn't all come out. It worked really well on the grill.

This is good, I'll try it again.After reading the previous review I cooked them in the oven and served them w/ ranch dressing, next time I'll grill them.  They're kind of hard to roll up. If they're not better on the grill I won't keep this one.

I also baked these and they are incredible.  I did use chicken thighs and cream cheese in the peppers instead and tastes delicious.  The flavors just all blend so well.  I did kick it up a notch on the seasonings with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and some italian herbs.  WILL MAKE AGAIN!

I give it four stars my husband really liked it and my son loved everything but the cheese. It was a bit salty with the turkey bacon to me and I don't really like salt. So next time I will skip the bacon for me and add more jalapeno. (I didn't use as much as the recipe said to and I should had.)

These were delicious, but not easy to make!  The rolling process sounded easy, but my cheese crumbled and was hard to keep in.  The bacon helped a little, but still hard to wrap tightly.  I lost most of my cheese during the grilling.  That said, it was delicious and I'll try it again, next time I'll cut the skewers in half and use a softer cheese.

Made this tonight for my husband and some guests.  I had never made this before but knew that I would love it.  I was surprise that EVERYONE loved this.  As a matter of fact, my husband said it was the best "Chicken Cordon Bleu" I had ever made.  Basically, made it the same as was directed with some modifications.  Instead of stuffing it with Pepper Jack cheese, I stuffed it with "Queso Fresco" because it melts without oozing out while cooking.  But in order to incorporate the Pepper Jack's robust flavor, I made a sauce that I spooned over the chicken and broccoli.  My husband said it is a keeper and asked if he could take same for lunch tomorrow.

I am the one who took the picture here. I added portabello mushrooms in with the jalaopeno's and jack cheese. Grilled them on the BBQ and they turned out awesome. Perfect hit!

These were great. I did bake these and I used only cream cheese to stuff the peppers. My oldest son loved them and said this was a keeper. I really enjoyed them, but feel a finishing sauce is needed. I will make these again, but I will come up with a sauce to add to the finished product.

My entire family loved this dinner! My husband said it was AWSOME! I made ranch dip to go with it. The only thing that kept me from giving the meal five stars was that I could not determine a way to keep the cheese inside.

This chicken is great! The only thing I changed is that I used canned whole Hatch chiles and pepper jack cheese. And I used the chiles and monterey jack for the kids. I serve with tomalito from this websight and spanish rice. It is always a hit!

I used greek seasoning instead and also wrapped the bacon around in both directions so that it sealed everything in like a pouch. It cooked perfectly and tasted great.

This was pretty good.  Kind of a pain to make, and the bacon really smoked out the neighborhood.  I think I will try pepper jack cheese next time instead of cheese and jalapenos.

lots of flavor, quite impressive for the simple ingredients. the grease from the bacon creates a flame show on the grill, but it makes it nice and crispy. i used fresh jalepeno peppers, but since they don't roll very easily, i would lay them across the cheese, instead of beside it. nice and tasty.

It was good but needs some sort of sauce.  I noticed a number of people suggested ranch dressing but I'd be interested in an alternative.

I added some "Philadelphia jalapeño cream cheese" instead of jalapeño and cheese. It was great.

we absolutely loved this.. loosely followed the measurements.. mozz for the jack cheese.. didn't pound the chicken.. just cut a slit and stuffed.. secured with toothpicks and baked in the oven like Rae.. ours took closer to 45 mins.. bf didn't know this was supposed to be grilled and mentioned once we were finished that he would love to see how this would turn out on the grill for that smokey component.. ty so much for this simple yet awesome recipe

I tried a version of these tonite and they were awesome. My brother in law made them. He took a bite size piece of chicken and placed a jalapeño slice on top and placed a piece of pepper jack cheese on top of that and then wrapped it all in bacon and then put into the grill. They were awesome. Will be making them myself and also trying by rolling up the chicken too. Great 5 star recipe!!!

Husband loved this dish and said he would pay for it in a restaurant.  Will try to make again but it was a bit of a pain to roll and grill. I used provolone cheese and banana peppers because that's all we had in house and it tasted great. I used way more bacon then reccommended because I didn't feel it would keep the cheese in. The grill did flare up because of the grease but I just kept watching and moving and it was fine! Good luck!

This is a great combination. I stuffed chicken breast with bacon and monterey jack cheese then put it on Gorge Forman grill. It turned out very moist. Topped in with ranch dressing. Easy and tasty.
