Okay, I've made this 4 times now, and have a few conclusions and suggestions. 1-When cooking the potatoes in the micro, don't bother measuring the water--just cover the taters with water.  Also, cover the bowl with a glass lid or plate or something; it makes the potatoes cook evenly much better. 2-I used apple juice instead of wine each time, and it's been great.  3-I only use about 1/4 cup of water, so the marinade sticks to the potatoes better.  4-Once they're skewered, I salt them generously before grilling them. Delicious! Even the kids love them and ask for them at each barbecue.

I loved the cooking method - but because I scaled this down to two servings these only required five minutes in the microwave. So much easier than cooking on the stove. I skewered these with red, yellow and green peppers, marinating all. Unfortunately, while the cooking method was fantastic and this really was good, the whole marinade thing is kind of a waste of time. Even though I added extra seasonings and fresh rosemary, one wouldn't even know there was anything but plain potatoes.  As for the mayonnnaise, it didn't add anything to the flavor and only created an unbecoming "deposit." I'll make these again, for method, but will probably only rub the potatoes with a little olive oil, garlic powder and salt and pepper.

Great way to grill potatoes! There's never a shortage of wine in this house, and I didn't use as much white wine as called for and they turned out perfect. I love the rosemary flavor! It was a great side dish for grilled steak.

Perfect way to cook potatoes on the grill, but prefer to skip the marinating portion of one hour in the fridge as I couldn't detect a difference between it and brushing it on while cooking.  Light flavor without overpowering the potatoes makes this a perfect side dish.  4 stars for ease and originality.  Thank you kimberlyj for the submission!

These were very good!  I was a little nervous to put these on the grill with all that thick mayo sauce on it. We do charcoal grilling so we put in the middle ubove the fire for about 8 minutes then moved to the sides as we grilled our chicken... "chili suace chickine" from this site....what a great meal! I HAVE MADE THIS A HANDFUL OF TIMES NOW AND THEY ARE SO GOOD EVERYTIME.  WE GRILL THESE WITH CHICKEN AND IT GIVES THE POTATOES A BIT OF THE CHICKEN FLAVOR.  I ALSO USE THE REALLY SMALL RED POTATOES AND DON'T CUT THEM.  SO CRISP AND FLAVORFUL ON THE OUTSIDE AND CREAMY ON TH INSIDE.

We loved these!  BUT I added some packet onion soup to the marinade! YUMMY! I think it added the flavor the other reviewers said was missing.  I also added a shake of parm, green/red peppers, onion and whole mushrooms to the skewer.  This was a great base thought to grilling potatoes though.  Thanks for the mayo & rosemary marinade idea!!

They were great! I didn't have rosemary so I used Italian seasoning,  Didn't have skewers so i chuncked the potatos marinated them, then I made a "boat"  with foil and poured everything into the boat and cooked them on the grill for about 8 to 15 minutes.  They were soo yummy! Hubby took leftovers to work and said they got better overnight. Highly Recommened

I love this method, didn't do exactly as the recipes says... I microwaved the potatoes as it says to, then I just marinade it in Good Seasons italian dressing (I add a little mayo to it to make creany and so it will stick better) Then grill as it says, very good!

Words cannot describe how awesome these potatoes were!  What a simple marinade, but so much flavor!  I was skeptical about how partially cooking the potatoes in the microwave and then grilling them later would be.  Fantastic texture -- they were tender and creamy with just a little crispness on the outside.  Will make over and over again!

I have to agree with naples34102 on these.  The method of preparation was nice, but the final outcome as far as the taste goes, was truly lacking.  I also feel that the mayo only adds excessive fat that is not needed.  The rosemary was nice but I found over all the potatoes lacked flavor.  If I ever make potatoes in this manner again, I too, will use olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.  And as far as the wine goes...I'll have it chilled, in a glass while I prepare the potatoes, my way!

precooked the potatoes about 10 minutes in the microwave in a casserole dish - completely covered in water. Then tossed with EVOO and seasonings (salt, garlic powder, black pepper, rosemary and thyme is what i used but a host of different flavor combinations would be great). I used the evoo instead of may for health factors and after reading other review that it made it gloppy. Grilled as driected. we loved them!

Since I already had some open apple juice, I used that rather than the wine, and I did add some grated Parmesan to the skewers before placing them on the grill.  Don't forget to salt and pepper the skewered potatoes!  I thought these were tasty, but I think almost anything you put on these using the cooking method would be wonderful!  Thanks for a really great idea for preparing potatoes!

We really love these. I do add salt, fresh garlic and about a fourth cup fine Parmesan cheese. The longer they marinate the better, don't forget to baste them while they grill.

These are really delicious. I couldn't be bothered skewering them, so we cooked them on the BBQ on a perforated grill pan instead, and they turned out delicious. Potatoes and rosemary are great, but you could also use other herbs that are potato friendly like thyme or oregano. I wouldn't bother using fresh herbs in this, dried are fine. Thanks!

Wonderful flavor!  I did not have time to put these on skewers, so I made a foil pack instead.  Made these for cookout with friends and they were a huge hit!

Oh my goodness these were awesome. I made 8 skewers for 4 of us and there was only one left when we were done. I would highly recommend. The one change I made was thyme for rosemary. I am not a rosemary fan. Still awesome. We are big potato fans in our house. This is a recipe that we will make again!!!!!

Decent, not amazing. I think they'd be better with fresh garlic because they weren't quite garlicky enough for me. I wasn't crazy about the wine aspect. It added kind of a funny twang. It just seems like a basic potato recipe to me.

These are simple to make and delicious.  I followed the directions for the most part but used 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh Rosemary for the dried.  The sauce is nice and light with a little tang.  My whole family enjoyed them and I would make them again.

These are EXCELLENT!  I, too, added a handful of grated parmesan to the marinade mixture.  I grilled these alongside chicken breasts and veggies.  I used half of the extra marinade to baste the chicken and it was also great!  One time I wanted to make this and was out of rosemary so I substituted dried Italian seasoning.  Equally good!
Thank you!

These were great!!  I also added onions and bell peppers, quartered. I microwaved the potatoes per instructions, but I felt it made them way to soft - I cut it back to 10 minutes.

I goofed up this recipe and it still was a big hit at my barbecue.  I didn't microwave first, just marinaded them in the mixture, then realized my mistake and microwaved just before serving.  Even thought the flavor probably wasn't as good due to lack of marinade time, they were still very tasty.  Nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Next time I won't forget to microwave first...and there definitely will be a next time!

The mayo/rosemary combination seemed a little off to me, but WOW! Very good! I only marinated them for about a 1/2 hour and they really soaked up the flavor. I also added green bell peppers and mushrooms to the skewers, but only put the mayo mixture on the potatoes. Very good, thank you!

These were okay.  The potatoes needed some more spices added to them.  If I made these again, I would doctor the recipe a bit.

These potatoes were excellent.  I saved the sauce and put the potatoes back in after grilling.  Then when we cut them open, we spooned a little of the sauce inside....amazing! thanks for the new recipe.

You don't have to work as hard as this recipe directs...  I skewer raw baby potatoes (cut in half), and baste them with a mixture of mayonnaise, rosemary, and garlic powder (I add salt and pepper) as they cook along side my grilled main course.  It takes about 40 minutes (perfect if you're grilling a whole chicken).  You can move them to an upper-rack, or place them over indirect heat if needed.  The seasoned mayonnaise gives these potatoes amazing taste and texture.  Love this babies :)

These potatoes are so good! I'm always floundering when it comes ot bringing something to a bbq - but these are spot on every time.  We never manage to have extra wine in the house so I sub with white wine vinegar and they are still excellent.

These were really very good and couldn't be easier.  I put them on the grill the same time as my London Broil, so did have to move them to a cooler part of the grill for the last 5 minutes or so.  We loved the char on them.  I added wedges of sweet onion to the skewers.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe~!

This is a good recipe. I thought they tasted just a touch too much on the "mayonnaise-y" side, but I'm not a big mayonnaise fan so maybe I'm oversensitive. But they were good and easy to make, which means they're a keeper in our house!

These were great with my grilled chicken, I did what someone else suggested I used a packet of dry onion soup mix and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the great idea, nice change of pace for grilled potatoes.

What a great recipe. I used small red potatoes (so cooked them whole) and 1 tsp chopped, fresh rosemary instead of the dried, other than these adjustments, I followed the recipe.  Tasty!

Surprisingly not that great.  I love the pre-cook method, but the marinade just didn't give the potatoes enough flavor.  But served alongside Savory Grilled Corn and Flip-Flop Grilled Chicken, we didn't really care because those two recipes (also from this site) are OUT OF THIS WORLD!  But this one...not so much. Probably won't make again.

Very good.  I cooked the potatoes about 1/2 the time, and I know potatoes vary in size, but red potatoes are about the same size, and some fell off the skewer.  I would cook even less. The marinade was good

No changes, My grill probably wasn't hot enough as I was making chicken at 425 on the yoder pellet grill so they didn't carmelize but they were really good. I'll make them again exactly the same recipe. Only thing I MAY try is using fresh rosemary but this is a winner for a quick, pantry lighter tasting side.

Made just like the recipe, except (after learning from another recipe) I added a tablespoon of vinegar to the water when microwaving - - it helps make the skin crispy when grilling.  Did find that the potatoes that had more char on them had more flavor - - will make again.

Loved this recipe.  I've never cooked with mayo before so I was a tad skeptical.  But I was very pleasantly surprised with the result.  I made two substitutions.  Instead of wine, I used chicken bone broth and instead of garlic powder, I minced fresh garlic.  I also added salt and pepper and a touch of savory. My kids have already asked me to make them again!!

We really enjoyed these! I didn't have any skewers so I made a pan out of foil. I only had 2 for dinner that day so I scaled back a little. I used 2 potatoes, cubed and microwaved them for about 8 minutes. The sauce I did 1/4c. of mayo and 3Tbsp. white wine, fresh garlic and the rosemary, mixed it all up. Finished cooking it on the grill, in the foil pan, about 10 minutes. Yummy!

I really enjoyed everything about these except the wine in the sauce. The potatoes cooked nicely in the microwave, the sauce adhered well, and they charred up a bit on the grill. Next time - and there will be a next time - I'll substitute in cider vinegar to make the marinade similar to a white barbeque sauce.

The sauce for this was delicious, but once put on the grill lost the marinated flavor (I grill with charcoal).  Going to do this same recipe but with the broiler.

Based on comments I added a dash more garlic powder. Everyone thought these potatoes were great and went back for seconds. The only problem was that the potatoes kept spinning on the skewers when flipping even though I used flat skewers. Next time I will double skewer to prevent.

Amazing! The flavor of the potatoes was incredible and the inside was creamy while the outside was flavorful and crispy. Don't bother marinating. Just baste the potatoes generously as you grill. This is going to be a new summer staple for us.

I used apple juice instead of wine just for preference but was not overly excited about this. It was quite simple to make which is a plus. Nice to try something different. May make it again but will add salt and something else just not sure what.

THe potatoes were cooked to perfection using this method. Didn't have time to marinate them after boiling so I smothered them with the sauce mixture while on the grill. The sauce needs a little more flavor. I will try again and not sure what I'll do to spice it up. will continue using the cooking method though.

This is excellent! My picky teen who doesn't like potatoes loved it!  If you don't have time to marinade the potatoes for a full hour, I recommend saving the extra marinade (still do it as long as you can) to brush on the finished dish. Also, I added thickly sliced zucchini and thick onion slices. You could really be creative with this.

These were a huge hit with the family. I didn't marinate and they didn't need it.  Just brushed with marinade while they browned.

Excellent... followed others review & used good seasons dressing with about 1/8 lite mayo.  I don't have a grill, so I microwaved the potatoes & then broiled them in the oven for 10 minutes.

DELISH!!!

So easy since most of the work is done ahead.  I loved cooking the potatoes before grilling, so my husband only had to brown them.  Great flavor without a lot of added fat!

Love the technique on this dish. I like the rosemary but didn’t think the mayo added anything. Needed salt. Will use the technique with different seasonings.

I made these potatoes for a family gathering. Well holy Toledo. This recipe was a hit. At the dinner table all you heard people doing was ummmmm,  ummm, wow these are delicious lol.  I didn’t use any water, just poured more wine in the marinade. I used the Little potatoes which don’t take long in the microwave and I only put little water in to steam then. BBQ grill was hot. Omg such an excellent recipe. Thank you

I used baby Yukon Gold potatoes instead.  They came so creamy and delicious.   I also par-boiled instead of microwaving them.

The idea is a winner. After cooking the potatoes in the microwave, I put the on the skewers sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic and rosemary. Perfect with grilled steak.

We really enjoyed this simple, but flavorful side dish.  I love the quick cooking time in the microwave and then a few minutes on the grill to pick up the smoke flavor and a bit of char which goes perfectly with the rosemary and garlic.

These were very enjoyable, but lacking flavour for the amount of effort and ingredients. Next time I will add the onion soup mix as others have suggested ( I use one from this site) and I will also try to marinate for longer. A recipe worth trying again.

Loved these. I did sprinkle with salt while on the grill and I used fresh rosemary instead of dried. I also used regular mayo not the light because that's what I had. This is a keeper. Another difference that I did was boil the potatoes on the stove instead of the microwave but I doubt that changed anything. Thanks for a nice recipe.

Very easy to make. I love potatoes and am always looking for new ways to make them. The rosemary gave it a nice flavor. I used fresh rosemary. I marinated them for about 4 hours only because that fit my schedule. They turned out great.

I poked the steamed potatoes with a fork before marinating so they'd soak some flavor. I marinated for 2.5 hours while I was at a movie. The marinade thickened and stuck to the potatoes well. They had lots of flavor. Great! Will make these again and again.

I made this recipe, with alterations because I realized I didn't have enough of some ingredients.  I liked the texture but the flavour was a little off (of course, again due to my alterations) so I look forward to trying this again so I can get the true flavour.  Thanks for sharing!

These werent that great although it may have helped if hubby grilled them longer.  I am not a big mayonaise based ingredient fan so I think that has a little something with my tastebuds liking this one.

I didn't think these potatoes were anything special, however, everyone just loved them. I thought they were better the next morning when we fried them in a little butter and had them for breakfast.  Salt and pepper is a must.
