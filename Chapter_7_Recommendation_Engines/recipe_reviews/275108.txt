Easy to prepare. Only adjusted the heat to our tastes, so enjoyed the flavour. Served on rice. Great for a weekday meal.
Next time might try with some chopped carrot, snow pea and bean sprouts for some crunch. Fun recipe.

I made it as written except I marinated the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes then drained before I stir fried it in two batches. Added great mix mash of veggies. Excellent and I control the spice and salt.

Nice recipe- I might reduce the honey next time but you can control your spice heat the way you like it   I was lazy and decided not to do the premix in the bowl.  I would suggest itâ€™s worth the extra dirty bowl. ??
