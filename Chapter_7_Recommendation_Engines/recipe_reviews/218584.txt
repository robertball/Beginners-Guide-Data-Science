I loved this dish.  Followed the recipe to the T.  When I went to dice the peppers  in adobo they were filled with seeds, i did scrape them out and am glad i did.  This dish did have quite a bite.    Served with mexican rice and flour tortillas.  Will definately make this again!

Do not give this recipe a bad review just because you don't like a little flavor and spice. This is HOT. To bring the heat down, add more sour cream. The only few things I did different here, I sauteed the onion and bell pepper separate from the chicken. I then combined everything in a stew pot and let everything simmer for 40 minutes. This was tasty and with tons of flavor. DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe and easy too. I would certainly make this for company. I thought two chipotle peppers might be too much but they were just right. I did chop them up before adding (with their seeds too)

Yum!  5 stars for a great punch of flavor in a quick and easy recipe.  I omitted the onion and green peppers (hub won't eat either and green peppers seemed out of place anyway).  I whirled the chipotles in the food processor.  Served over rice with a side of black beans - good stuff.

If you like the flavor of chipotle, this is for you!
Even though it is tempting to add extra peppers for more heat, I don't recommend it, this was perfect... followed the directions exactly! Because there are young ones in our house and chipotle can be intense sometimes, I served it with an additional dollop of light sour cream on top and sprinkled with chives because I didn't have cilantro.

Wow! This was delicious! B/c I'm on a special diet, it's hard to find things I can eat! I just took the butter out completely and used fat-free sour cream, and a tiny tiny bit of olive oil. But WOW! This was quite amazing!

Perhaps I should have known better, but I have never cooked with chipotle peppers before.... This was HOT!  The flavor was nice, but we could not stand the heat enough to eat very much of this at all.  I am sure this is a good recipe for those who like spicy, but this one was just not for us!

I coated the chicken with a mixture of brown rice flour, chickpea flour, and tapioca starch so it would be gluten free and I had to sub a mixture of bacon grease and sunflower oil b/c my son is allergic to olive oil.  I did not chop the chipotles because the recipe didn't say to, and to compensate, I added in about 1 Tbsp extra adobo sauce.  I served it to my husband and son without the sour cream, as they are sensitive to dairy, and the rest of us ate it with the sour cream.  To be honest, it was a little rich for me, I had a bite before adding the sour cream and preferred it that way.  My children did not care for it (too spicy for them, I think), but my husband loved it and at all of his serving and my son's.  If/when I make this again, I will omit the sour cream for all of us.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pre-made but held off putting in the sour cream.  Added sour cream when it was reheated.  Turned out great.  Easy to make and we all enjoyed it.

Absolutely awesome sauce! Just saut√©ed onions and diced yellow bell pepper , added the broth, sour cream and chipotles and threw it in the blender. Put it over chicken enchiladas I had made previously and frozen for a later date (without sauce). I usually use canned sauce but didn't want to go to the store so I adapted this recipe. Won't be using the canned stuff EVER again!

This was easy to make and very yummy. I didnt bread the chicken because i feared it would get soggy before my husband got home. I also added about 1 TBSP of chipotle sauce from the can of peppers because we like spice! I also added a lil bit of flour to thicken the sauce and served over egg noodles. The husband LOVED it.

We made this last night. It was very,very good! I did double the amount of chicken and only used one chipotle pepper( we like hot but even with just the 1 our noses were running and brows were sweating!)
Definitely will make again!

Delicious!! Amazing flavor with a little kick.  We followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, we might use a little more chicken stock and sour cream to make more sauce.  We chopped the chipotles because we love their smokey spiciness.  Threw it over fettucine, and it was delicious!

Yum-O!  We used boneless chicken thighs and replaced the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper, but otherwise kept the same ingredients.  We served it over rice, but would probably do Mexican rice next time.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

omg this was so good...tried this recipe took some my co worker some of it to try she turned around and made it for a dinner party that weekend. The flavor is awesome! If you don't care for a lot of heat just adjust the chipotle peppers you use, I served on warm corn tortillas with chopped avocado and tomatoes, yummy

3.5 stars - This was a decent and quick dish to put together.  We like spicy food so the heat level was perfect.  Used red bell pepper instead of green, but followed everything else.  It was good, but felt like it was lacking something.  Would maybe make again and see if I could figure out what it was.

This was pretty good but definitely borderline too spicy for this moderate spice lover.  I only used 1 1/2 chipotle peppers and next time I would reduce it to 1 for our tastes.  I served these in whole wheat tortillas with a little bit of cheddar cheese.

This had really good flavor, but I accidentally added 3 peppers which made it way too spicy for most of the family.  Next time I will only add one.  I put it over egg noodles for the sake of the kids and it worked.  I skipped the first step of cooking the green pepper and onion ahead of the chicken.

I came across this website looking for diffrent recips for Homemade Chilli, and I seen this Chipotle Cream Chicken recipe and i seen the word CHIPOTLE and had to see what it was about lol, and i actually liked the recipe and how it looked so i made it. And I have to say it's GREAT , easy simple and GOOD, my boyfriend went back for seconds ;-) and he loved that it was creamy and or a cream with the chicken melting pretty much in your mouth ;-) I would definatley recommend this recipe, but I am going to be making this again, just with maybe shrimps next time, trying diffrent things out but i love the cream base ;-)Great Recipe!!!

Excellent! Even Alfonso liked it! Hurray!!
I omitted the green bell as I did not have it. Which was OK because I'm thinking it may not taste that good in this dish.....not sure if I'd like the flavor with the chipotle. The cilantro was a nice touch.  Also, it was very easy to make.

I really enjoyed this... probably because I love anything chipotle.  I made the recipe as is, but doubled up on the sauce.  Served with garlic rice, and jalapeno cheddar biscuits.  Delish !!!

This was OK, good basic recipe. It might be nice to add pasta or something to it to soak up the sauce.

My husband gave this dish a 7 out of 10, but I didn't care for it too much. It would be good as tacos, but I would recommend a different pepper. My house was very stinky after cooking this and I personally did not like the smokey flavor the peppers gave the dish. I didn't eat my portion. I might try this again, but with the adjustments and as a taco dish.

I make this recipe all the time for my boyfriend. He likes his food hot and spicy so I usually use 2 of the larger peppers in the can as well as a tablespoon of the adobo. If you want the same flavor and less heat use more adobo and 1 large pepper. I also add more sour cream to my portion to cool it off a bit so you can add more cream to the whole dish to put out some of the fire. I usually serve over mexican rice or buttery garlic rice.

this was AWESOME! Easy to make & yummy! I added chipotle bouillon & a little tomato sauce instead of using the peppers with adobo sauce. I also used red & yellow bell peppers instead of green because we don't care for them.

this recipe is so simple and delicious. We've been making this in my home for years but never thought to put in flour to make it creamy. Its delicious with flour and just as delicious but much healthier without it. 
To save calories I do a mix of flour and corn starch and I slowly add it till it's creamy enough for me. Again, anything go save calories lol.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, gluten free all purpose flour, and I steamed some broccoli on top of the rest of the mix during the last 10minutes of cooking. No other changes. Served it over brown rice. Delicious!

6 10 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/218584/chipotle-cream-chicken/ .... Like others said, this was okay, but lacked something; maybe beans, tomatoes, jalapenos.  I'm not a firebreather & two weren't really spicy, just smokey flavor that developed into mildly hot as you had more.  'Think it depends how on how much sauce you have with each pepper.  I used half the amount of chicken broth & didn't bother with the reducing step; decreased sour cream to 3T.  Pretty, restaurant-looking dish.  S liked, went back for seconds.  K tried a bite & liked.  She'd already had spaghetti.  :)  E hasn't tried yet.  For me, three stars, but I"m willing to "play" & S would like it again.

this was delicious I made a few changes I cooked my onion, bell pepper, poblano peppers, fried them in my oil with my chicken, I used poblano peppers because I love them and there not as spicy at the chipotle peppers, then I made my sauce I don't have abobo sauce so I put some soy sauce in a pan with the chicken broth and boiled that then added my sour cr√®me after boiled and poured into the chicken mixture when everything gets tender, this is so a keeper thanks for the recipe

This turned out great! I am very sensitive to spice and this recipe was fine without adjusting the heat. I used two chipotles with seeds. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand. I served it with an improvised Mexican rice and some guacamole to cool it down.

Made as directed, but didn't use low sodium chicken broth.  I scraped the seeds out of the chipotle peppers and the finished dish did still have some heat, not overwhelming, but you could definately tell the devil was in there somewhere.  Served with mexican styled rice and corn tortillas. That also helped take some heat off.  Maybe should use a little less pepper if cooking for kids.  Overall, it's a keeper!

Very tasty.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, but had about 4 times the quantities and mostly eyeballed the amounts.  I blended my chipotles and adobo sauce together to get a fairly creamy mixture (no deseeding... why would you even...) and used about 3 tablespoons or so.  The end result was a nicely spicy dish.  Ate with white rice.  I recommend a side dish of veggies or a salad as this is pretty much pure protein by the time it's done.

This was easy and delicious!! I I changed it to a crock pot meal and really only skipped the breading and frying of the chicken, but added all of the seasonings. It cooked 4 hrs on high setting, then after adding the sour cream and cilantro I turned it down to warm. I also only used one chipotle pepper so my kids might try it, but it was still too spicy for them!! So this is easily adaptable to your needs and tastes.

Only changed a few things in this recipe. Instead of a bell pepper I used a Pablano seemed to fit a lot better.  I used 2 cups of broth and doubled the sour cream.  I also added some jack cheese. Added good flavor. Good recipe but needed a few adjustments.

Only 3 stars from me.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I chopped the chipotle peppers.  We really like spicy food so it was ok for us. I liked the heat of the peppers, but under that the flavor was kind of bland.  I don't know what was missing, but something made this just OK.  I might make it again if I happen to think about it...

I've made this many times. In case you don't know this already, chipotles can be very spicy--some brands more so than others. If you don't like the heat, this is probably not the recipe for you. To the reviewer who said "a recipe for adobo sauce would be nice," adobo is the sauce in the can with the chipotles. I think the ingredient list is pretty clear about that, but it's also clearly labeled on the can. Unless you absolutely need to, I would not omit the sour cream. Aside from cooling things down a bit, it's an important flavor in the dish!

Very tasty and easy to make, though I recommend using only one chipotle pepper.  Using 2 was VERY hot, though still very good!

Did not include the bell pepper (neither of us care for it) and cut back slightly on the onion.  DH would have preferred no onion whatsoever, but in the end agreed that it added a layer of flavor that would otherwise be missed.  The flavors were outstanding -- neither one of us found it too hot for our liking.  Served it with pasta, which I would do again in a nanosecond; but will try it on rice next time.  Thanks, KNBUCHANAN, for a great recipe!

Great recipe & very close to what I was looking for. I always order this at my favortie Mexican restaurant & decided to try & replicate it at home (its a $20 plate!) rediculous.. I skipped the green peppers & added mushrooms (like they do it @ Gallos). I didn't bread & fry chicken for the same reason I used fat free sourcream. I had the smoker already going so I smoked the breast for a cpl hours before cutting & finishing in my cast iron pot. I cooked everything in one pot & let it simmer for about an hour; only because, as usual, my company was late for dinner. This was so yummy & Im thankful for finding this recipe!

it wasn't my favorite but it wasn't bad at all.
i added 2 chipotle peppers without the seeds but found it not hot enough so i added more adobo sauce.
we made rice and had it with tortillas. 
the cilantro is a must for this dish.
thx for sharing your recipe.

LOVE this!  I use shrimp in this sometimes, instead.  My mini food processor (or blender) is very helpful for combining the chipotle peppers, broth and sour cream--though if I don't have sour cream, I just use milk or half and half with water. Yes, this is HOT with the peppers and their seeds, but I am crazy about chipotle peppers in adobe--so to me, this hot is a good thing.

Unbelievable! I adjusted the recipe for a low-fat diet...didn't use the sour cream and substituted olive oil and butter with no-stick sprays and it turned out incredible! I served it to my husband over mashed potatoes and fresh corn and he is a happy man!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and this turned out great. Very easy, simple, and quick.  A nice change from the typical chicken recipes.  Very good flavor.

I have the pickiest hubby in the world. He's Mexican and automatically thinks he knows everything about ALL Latin-esque foods. He loves this and regularly requests it.  I am not a chipotle flavor fan but must admit that this chicken is amazing.  I don't always have the same type of cream on hand and it doesn't matter. I've even used Mayo when out of cream...GREAT results every time.

Delish!  I did as the others said and removed the seeds from the peppers.  It was hot without being uncomfortable.  I am looking forward to trying it warmed up.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes. I haven't made it in a while, and just made it for my husband for the first time. He liked it very much even though he's not a fan of spicy food. I used orange peppers instead of the green peppers and served it over white rice.
