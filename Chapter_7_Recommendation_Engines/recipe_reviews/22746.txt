I'm only giving four stars to this recipe because I had to alter it as suggested by other reviewers to get the perfect cupcakes.  I added a cup of sour cream, increased the sugar by 1/4 cup, and for the crust used two and a half cups of crushed wafers with 1/4 cup butter pressed to the bottom of the cupcake liners.  They turn out great after these changes -- people keep asking for the recipe!  I also made them using the plain wafer cookies for the crust as described in the recipe and they just turned slightly chewy ... it kinda felt weird having to chew the crust when the cheesecake itself just melts in your mouth.  So if you have time, do the extra work and crush your cookies - it's worth the trouble  :D

A+ Recipe!!  Made this early yesterday morning for a winter sports banquet last night.  Vanilla Wafers have shunk over the years, so I crushed 2-1/2 cups, added 1/4 cup melted margarine and pressed 1 T into each paper liner.  Also as per previous reviewer, I added 1 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup more sugar to the cream cheese mix and got 20 wonderful cups.  Topped 1/2 with 1 T blueberry pie filling and the other 1/2 with 1 T cherry pie filling....blue and red, my kids HS school colors.  First dessert to disappear!!  Thanks for sharing this one Diana.  It's been printed and filed for lots of future use.

These were easy, fast, and tasted pretty good.  After reading some of the reviews, I changed up some things.  Also, I only had one pkg of cream cheese so I had to adjust the ingredients accordingly.  For the Crust:  The wafer cookies were too small for regular muffin size and too big for mini-muffin size.  So, I crushed 20 wafer cookies and mixed it with 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  After lining the muffin pans with cupcake papers, I put tablespoon full of crushed cookies to each muffin pan.  I had exact amount of crushed cookies for 12 cupcakes.  I used a measuring cup which fit nicely in the muffin pan to press the crushed cookies to the bottom.  Very easy!  For the Filling:  I used one pkg of cream cheese, added 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1 egg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Filled each cup evenly and baked it for 20 mins.  After it cooled a bit, I put it in the refrigerator to chill.  I read in other reviews that cheese cake cups sink afterwards.  Well, it sinks quite a bit - about 1/2 inch deep, which provides you more than enough room for your favorite filling.  My choice of filling is strawberry (fresh, frozen, or pie filling).  With filling and all, I thought it was little too sweet for my taste.  Next time, I think I will use a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This one was really worth it!  Very easy and VERY tasty!  I used butter cookies instead of vanilla wafers - you MUST try this because I believe the butter cookies (store-bought in the tin) made them even more delicious!

I brought them to a pot luck and they were a big hit.  Thankfully I made more than enough and had a (very) few left to take home - yum!

BTW, I used half a strawberry to top each one, slicing each strawberry in half, then slicing each half to make three thin slices, and fanning those for an elegant topping.

Awesome!  A party smash hit.  I made as is, but followed the other's advice by mixing 2 1/2 cups wafer to 1/4 cup butter in the food processor and then scooping 1 tablespoon of the mixture into each cup and pressing down to make the crusts.  I also topped with cherry pie filling.  Everyone loved them!

Make sure you don't overfill the paper baking cups.  If you do, increase your baking time.  I filled mine about 3/4 full and had to bake them about 30 to 45 minutes total.

Easy and tasty! Crushed the wafers in the food processor and added melted butter and put 1 tbs. in each paper and pressed down for crusts. Everyone here loved them -- even picky son who never tries anything new.

These are VERY good, and VERY easy!!  They went so quick at my gathering, I almost didn't get to try one!  I used strawberry flavored cream cheese (Philly) and topped them off with Betty Crocker chocolate desert decorations (found by the icing in the baking isle).  They turned out BEAUTIFUL!  I baked them for 25 minutes, but I think that it was a bit too long.  Thanks Diana, for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These were so good and SO easy.  I baked for 20 min. and topped them with a variety of jams and crushed nuts after baking.  I'll definitely make these again.

I have made these twice now. The 1st time I made as the recipe to stated. Didn't add a thing and they turned out great. I made them the second time tonight taking others advice adding 3/4 cup sour cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2/3 cup sugar as well as dropped the syrup from cherry pie filling randomly in the cream cheese mixture and cut with a butter knife to create swirls. Then made the rest above recipe. I have to say both were good but will make them second way from here on out.

These were really good. Only I took the advice of others and crushed up the vanilla wafers, added some melted butter and pressed the cookie mixture into the bottom of each cup. Was much better than just placing a cookie in bottom of cup, which made it have way to much crust in my opinion. Next time I will experiment with different toppings and marbling my cheese cakes. But very good!

I used to make these when I was a girl and they are just as good as I remembered.  Not sure why others feel the need to crush cookies,etc.  The cookies set in the bottom of 2 1/2 inch foil cups and the taste & texture is fine, just like a crust.  And the foil cups eliminate the need for a muffin pan, I just placed cups in a cake pan.  But I do agree with others on cooking time, these need 30 minutes and didn't brown at all (which is fine since cheesecake shouldn't brown).  I substituted 1/2 c lite sour cream for 1/2 c lite cream cheese.  I also used reduced fat Nilla wafers and lite cherry pie filling (20 oz can was perfect amount for 4-5 cherries in each).  So they end up about 140 calories each.  Very easy to make & a nice treat when you want a simple and light dessert.

Omg! This recipe is AWESOME! So I did make some modifications + I had scaled it. I knew just cheese would make the cake too hard, so I wanted to substitute some of it with sour cream. But too bad! I didn't have any! Instead I had strawberry yogurt. Thus, I substituted 1/3 of the cheese with yogurt. I baked it for about 13 minutes (it rose up and was about to crack, but not yet), then I turned the oven off, and opened the oven door for it to cool. Then I made some cream cheese icing to top it off. Lastly I put a strawberry on top ! Viola!! A Yummy, beautiful looking treat that ONLY took 45 minutes!

O yaa!! I did use graham cracker crumbs plus butter as the crust!
PS: *I didn't put as much sugar since the yogurt was already sweet*

Strawberry Cheese is sooo yummy.

I made these for a party, and they were fantastic! They were incredibly easy to make.  The center did sink, as other reviewers mentioned, but I just topped with cherry pie filling.  The only hint I have is to refrigerate them before removing the cupcake liners or they won't come loose cleanly.

This recipe has been around for a long time and it is such a fun and quick dessert to make. For a twist and more elegant appearance I fold into cheese mixture 1/2c. mini chocolate chips and drizzle about 1 tsp. homemade caramel sauce over the top. I get 17 servings. and it tastes yummy!!

I LOVE this recipe and so does everyone else. I get requests for birthdays and potlucks at work all of the time. I suggest reading the cheesecake tips on this site, it helped a lot. I've made this so many times that I experiment with it. I crush up oreo cookies and mix it in the batter as one variation, or I'll pour some of the plain mix into the muffin liner then place a flattened candy miniature in it then fill the rest up with the mix. I have also used a pulled apart oreo as the bottom instead of a wafer, have fun trying new things!

Outstanding. I just made them.  I needed a quick dessert for the 4th of July and my wife is working.  Needed something easy because although I'm of the King of the Grill, my wife certainly rules the kitchen.  I also processed the wafers with butter and added an extra 1/4 c sugar.  They took about 25 minutes to cook and when they cooled the tops collapsed a bit, but this allows for the addition of topping.  I used blueberry on some and cherry on the rest.  I doubled the recipe and came up with 29 2 1/2 ounce cups. There are now 27 for the cookout tomorrow... I used Reynolds foil baking cups so I wouldn't have to deal with the cupcake pan nonsense. They worked great. My wife will not believe I made these.  Maybe I'll try a souffle next!

I revised this recipe for Thanksgiving dessert by using gingersnaps in place of vanilla wafers, decreasing cream cheese to 1 package and adding 1 cup of pumpkin puree in its place - bake for 20 minutes and you have mini pumpkin cheesecakes...I'm still eating these for breakfast!

excellent!  make just the way the recipe is written, but add a 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg to the cream cheese mixture.  it adds wonderful flavor to the mixture that is otherwise plain, but still delicious. I like to serve them with a variety of toppings. Here are suggestions:  cherry pie filling, strawberry pie filling with chocolate curls in top, apple pie filling (w/ apples chopped smaller) then sprinkled with cinnamon, blueberry pie filling, carmel sundae topping sprinkled with chopped walnuts or pecans.

fabulous recipe and easy to make!  I modified the recipe slightly as per the suggestion of other posters.  I crushed the cookies with butter, added an additional 1/4c of sugar, added 1c of sour cream and used almond extract in lieu of vanilla.  I had to bake them for 18-20 mins. and they came out wonderfully.  I'll definately be making these again - thanks!

Soooooo good. I found these individual cheese cakes much more practical then a whole cake. Not as messy and you can just grab one and go. Can be eaten plain or topped with cherry or blueberry pie filling, jam, nuts, fresh fruit, chocolate chips, whipped cream... Fun for kids to decorate too.

Let them overcook a little, then when they sink in the middle, put some fruit filling on top.

Very quick and easy! Tasty too! I put chocolate chips right in the mixture and topped with fresh pieces of strawberries. My baking time was also more around 25 min than the 15 stated on the recipe. Also, make sure you refrigerate for a few hours before serving.

i have been making these for as long as i can remember.  crushing the cookies takes away the easiness of the recipe! it doesnt matter if there is a little bit of the bottom not covered with a cookie, they still taste AMAZING!!! my mom and i use to make these when i was little and still make them regularly.  Keep everything as is, they are so quick and trust me they will be gone by the end of the night!

These were great! I added 1 cup of sour cream and another 1/4 cup of sugar like some other reviewers did. That gave me enough for 24 regular size cups. For the crust I took 40 vanilla wafers and combined them with 4 T. melted butter. That gave me enough for 23, so one didn't have a crust. So now I know. :) I baked them for the 15 mins. and then turned the oven off and let them cool in there for another 15 mins. before I took them out to cool completely. Then put in fridge to cool. Great texture. Will definitely make again and try adding things to the batter like some mini choc. chips and maybe some mini candy bars chopped up. Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious, easy-breezy recipe - great for entertaining!  A few TIPS: I used Oreo cookie crumbs for the base (1 1/4c crumbs + 1/4 melted butter + 1/4c sugar).  I swirled strawberry jam through the cheesecake mixture which was super. I did lightly spray the cup cases to prevent sticking and I refrigerated overnight before I peeled off the cup cases.  I also baked for 25 minutes. Make sure you place the cup cases in the muffin tins b/c the mixture does tend to spread a lot. I topped with fresh strawberries and this was definitely a big hit. A definite must-do.

Enjoy!

There are several things you need to konw about this recipe... First it is easy to make and it is a very tasty treat! However the recipe directions leave a lot to be desired... I made this exactly as written but after 15 minutes of bakeing, the cup cake was neither golden brown nor was it set up. I put back in the oven and baked another 15 minutes. It still wasn't golden brown but kinda looked like it was set up. I tried to take one out of the muffen pan but it spilled out of the cup cake paper into the muffen pan. I put back into the oven again and cooked for another 15 minutes. It still didn't turn golden brown but it did set up. The next thing about this recipe is that it does not make 16 cup cakes. I only got 10. If you fill the cups about 3/4 full, you might get 16 if you are lucky. But for all the time it took to make, it was worth the trouble.

I did this substituting about half a cup of sour cream for half a package of cream cheese, and then adding another 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also used lite cream cheese and sour cream to reduce the calories.  I learned two important lessons, however--chill them for about 2 hours before you remove the wrappers (45 min wasn't enough, and they weren't completely set--it was very gooey), and don't put on the toppings until AFTER you've removed the wrappings (double on the gooey-ness).

My book club LOVED these--there were rave reviews, and I ended up passing out the recipe!  I used them as my guinea pigs...now I plan to make these for my in-laws extended family Christmas get-together.  I think I'll use thawed frozen fruit this time instead of pie filling, sprinkle them with powdered sugar, put on some chocolate shavings, and garnish with mint sprigs.  That should be wonderfully Christmassy AND be guaranteed to blow their socks off! :P

I make these all the time as a quick last minute dessert.  They are always a huge hit.  Very simple to make and come out great.  I usually fill the sunken top in with caramel, chocolate or fruit preserves.  Love this recipe!!!!!

I made this recipe before and wasn't that impressed with the flavor.  However, the second time I made this I added the sour cream and extra sugar and it made big difference in the flavor.  These were great and disappeared very quickly.  I will use the modified recipe when making these again.

I cannot thank the person who posted this recipe enough! Do NOT let the simplicty of this recipe throw you off, baked in foil muffin muffin liners, its actually an elegant lil dessert PERFECT for those standing only get togethers, and more casual BBQs.  
I fill my muffin cups with the mixture about 2/3 full. (Making 14 cups instead of 16)This does increase the baking time, however, the cheesecakes are done when their tops crack, rather then waiting for them to brown. MAKE SURE to chill these overnight, as they are SOOOOO much better that way.
For the economy of the ingrediants, the attractivness of the finished outcome, and simply the time you save, you cannot get any get any better then this. A MUST for any busy Moms recipe box.

These really are easy and so good.  I used a half cup sour cream and a little more sugar.  For the crust I just used the recipe on the graham cracker crumb box (crumbs, sugar and melted butter) pressed into cupcake papers.  Topped with cherry pie filling but next time I think I'll use fresh fruit.  The pie filling was a little overpowing and I like the taste of the cheesecake more than the fruit topping.  Awesome dessert if you want compliments.

I have been making this recipe for years, and it has never failed to turn out correctly. I would like to thank the submitter for sharing this. It is a cheap, easy way to satisfy a childs sweet tooth...or you can dress it up for more elegant fair. During the holidays I use "fancy" foil cup liners, sub the wafers with gingersnaps and top with cranberry chutney and orange zest. You can not go wrong with this recipe, however, I never bake these cups for the time recommended...I take them out of the oven when they are just about set and still slightly jiggly in the center.I then cool in the coldest part of my fridge overnight to ensure a dense, moist cupcake. Let your imagination run wild when topping these little gems, and you will soon be asked to bring them to every picnic, potluck, and gathering you are invited to!

I made these for Christmas.. and I found that the recipe was quite easy, though the instructions said to wait for them to brown.. and they never did... but they were too tough.. if I had known, I would have added whipping cream to make them lighter, and maybe some lemon juice for extra flavouring.
Over all, they were pretty good though.

Ohhhhhhh...yummy, yummy, yummy!  These are really good.  As some reviewers suggested, I made the following changes...I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, added 1 cup of non-fat sour cream, and added an additional 1/4 cup sugar.  With these changes, the recipe made 23 cupcakes.  They came out so creamy and yummy!  I'm not sure what the other reviewers meant about the texture of the Nilla wafers...they seem to form a great crust and I didn't do anything to them.  Since they sink when cooling, they've left a perfect crater for me to put in cherry pie filling.  I can't wait to serve these at my party in a couple of days.

Perfect desert on the fly, super fast! I honestly didn't expect much the first time I made these. I wanted to do like others suggested and make a graham and butter crust but I was running short on time. I was really skeptical about the wafers but WOW. Nice light flavor. I think I'll just leave this one the way it is. I did however sub with 1/3 less fat cream cheese. If you're into a really rich cheese cake you may want to add a little more sugar, use regular cream cheese and a graham and butter crust.

Very tasty!!!  I substituted some sour cream for about 1/4 of the cream cheese, and it was excellent.  I might try using plain yogurt next time.  Wonderful with cherry pie filling on top!  I did find, however, that the vanilla wafers weren't big enough to cover the bottoms completely, so I had to crunch them up.  Maybe next time it would be easier to use graham crackers...  Also, these take much closer to 25 minutes to cook.

Like other reviewers mentioned, I also had to cook these a lot longer than the recipe stated.  However, the end result was great.  I think the sunken center provides a perfect place to add your favorite topping.  They are easier to eat that way too!  I took these to a dessert sampler and they went fast!

what can I say that hasn't already been said about these great little cheesecakes? I, too, added 1 cup sour cream and 1/4c more sugar as another reviewer suggested. Yum...Perfect size and presentation for a ladies luncheon. I spooned blackberry sauce (just modify the Betty Crocker Raspberry sauce on this site) into the sunken centers. The centers that sink may put someone off, however, it becomes an advantage because it provides a little hollow to put in your favorite sauces or fillings. Thanks Diana.

WONDERFUL! I made these "light" cheesecake cups and the were great.  I used Reduced Fat Wafers, the sugar substitute (like Splenda) and two packages of light cream cheese + the rest of the ingredients.  I took them to all of my friends and didn't tell them they were light and all of them said they were great!!  AWESOME RECIPE! Thanks

I really liked this recipe. I put sourcream /w powered sugar in the holes made after baking and then blueberries and red raspberries for a 4th of July treat. Next time I would try what someone suggested of using round butter cookies instead of the nilla wafers. They have made those wafers so small now they did not even come close to covering the bottom of the muffin cup.

This recipe is soo perfect. I was looking for something to offset my chocolate brownies, but I didn't want a frosting, more like a cream brownie texture. Well, I came across this and It looked so easy so I tried it. I simply pouered it over the brownies when they were fifteen minutes to being done and stuck them back into the oven for 15 more minutes. What a delight, just what I was looking for. It made a sort of caky deliscious layer on top of the chocolate brownies. I lvoed it. Going to be keeping this recipe, Thanks!

Killer easy and delicious!  I added a tablespoon of lemon juice for extra bite.  The wafers I bought seemes so small inthe muffin cups, so I crushed them slightly to cover the bottom - more than one to a cup.  It all baked well and held together and great just plain!  Toppings could make endless delicious.  I used homemade raspberry jam and made a quick white chocolate sauce (chips and milk inthe micro) Very good!  Saving this for party ideas!!

I liked these very much. I crushed the cookies and added butter as other reviews suggested and I also added sour cream to the mixture. I topped them off with blueberries and cherries. Everyone loved them. Thank you!

For the cheese filling I also added a cup of sour cream.  For the crust, I crushed the cookies, added a half cup of mini chocolate chips, 2 tablespoons of melted butter and pressed the mixture down in the tins.  It was delicious!

After reading reviews I did change the recipe a bit.  I added 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 cup of sour cream.  I also crushed the cookies and added 1/4 cup of butter for the crust.  These turned out great with these changes!

I love how easy this recipe is and still has great presentation! You can make ahead and chill. I served with sliced strawberries (bought frozen, then thawed) and caramel sauce and mini chocolate chips. Also, I made them in foil muffin cups. This is one of my faithful recipes for company and parties.

I make this recipe all the time and have gotten rave reviews.  The only thing I do differently is blending crushed ginger snaps with melted butter for the crust.  Very good!  The recipe says to bake until the top is golden... mine never get golden, which isn't a problem but it tends to make me want to cook them too long.

It was a pretty easy recipes and the taste was really good. The batter wasnt enough to make the 24 cup that i orignally planned. I had to add more into the batter at the last minute. I would double the batter that the recipes request. I added some blueberry and cherry pie filling with mint to garnish. It had a nice presentation. Will make this again. After two days, family is already requesting it!

Great recipe but I had a little trouble with the baking. It took 25 minutes and they don't turn golden. I was also making a bunch. I baked some in cupcake tins and some in a cake pan I used the foil cupcake liners and they held up very well. The ones in the cake pan turned out way better. They set up real nice and no cracks. The ones in the cupcake tins sunk and cracked all over.

I have been doing this one for years.  My recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 of a cup.  It makes 12 cupcakes and bakes for 20 minutes.  My muffin tin must be larger.  But the result is the same; fantastic cheesecake.  I also top the cupcakes with prepared pie filling.  Everyone who eats them asks for the recipe.

These were GREAT! I did use the altered version with 1cup of sour cream the extra 1/4 cup of sugar and almond extract instead of vanilla. I also added chopped up chocolate chips in the batter and filled the tops in with frozen raspberries thawed and crushed. They went before anything else at two parties.

These were very good, however, not very sweet.  I also had a hard time getting the wafers "unstuck" from the papers.

Great recipe!  The batter yielded 32 cupcakes.  SOOO simple, and very tasty.  YUM!  While the sunken top may seem like a turn-off to some, it is the absolute perfect place to spoon your favorite topping in.  Refrigerate over night for best results.  The only thing is the vanilla wafer got a little soggy during the whole cooking/cooling process.  But don't get me wrong...this recipe is sooooo worth making!!

This has been a favorite in my family for years!  After the cupcakes cool, we top them with a spoon full of the canned cherries in thick syrup.  The best cherry cheesecake I've ever had!  I'm sure other fruit would also work well (strawberries, etc.)

Simply fantastic! I added just a touch of crushed fruit into the mix for a splash of color. Also, to cover the indentation left after baking, i dropped a spoonful of sour cream (mixed with confectioners sugar) on top and garnished with fruit! Thanks Diana!!!

Cheese Cake is a desert which reaches the height of dignity and class, because it both looks and tastes pure and soft.  Having these little miniature cheese cakes really works for me, so I won't get carried away with the amount I consume.  It's easy to eat too much cheese cake only to feel sick later.  Having a set portion is really smart and it is really tasty.

This is my first review as I am so happy to share the compliments I received using this recipe. I am not really good in baking or cooking but this recipe did make me proud! I tried it for my nephews birthday and their friends kept giving me compliments and asked for more. Too bad I only did a few as am not sure I will do it right.  I did follow the reviewers suggestion of crushing the vanilla wafers which my 3yo son was so eager to help in operating my small chopper. Added also the sour cream and sugar. Add more time in prep but worth the compliments I received later. Thanks for sharing and I will do this again for my son's baptism in 3 weeks!

This is a very good recipe as is, the only thing that I did different was instead of a wafer crust, I used a graham cracker one, because I didn't have any wafers, next time I will have to try the wafers sounds like it will go well together.  My family loved this recipe. I made my own fruit toppings for it.

I made this for a church potluck lunch and it was a hit!  I altered the recipe a little based on others comments and tweaked on my second batch.  I crushed 2.5 cups of nilla wafers in a food processer with then added 1/4 c butter.  Take the time to do it- so much better!  My first batch I used 1c sugar, but I thought it was too sweet.  I my 2nd batch I used 3/4 cup and it came out perfect.  Fill each cupcake only 1/2 way up.  Do the toothpick test after 15 mins- if not done then check again at 20.  It does not brown and don't worry the cupcakes are supposed to deflate.  I added chocolate chips to each cup before baking and topped with light cherry pie filling.  Yummy!  Got many compliments from everyone!  They said it was the hit of the potluck!  Will make this again and try different combination.

This is very good and easy.  I changed some things to lower the calories.  I used fat free cream cheese and crushed fat free graham crackers instead of using the vanilla wafers.  I used the same amount of sugar and halved the recipe and it was delicious and easy.  Thanks for posting.

I also followed the suggestions given in the review, and they turned out wonderfully. I love that it's simple enough to involve the kids, particularly if you put the mixture in a ziplock freezer bag and cut a corner to pipe it into the cupcake tin.

I used to make something very similar to these called "cheesecake cookie cups", which I got off of this site, but I can no longer find them on here??? It has been a few years.  If you want to spice up the crust, just ditch the wafers altogether and replace them with a chocolate chip cookie.  The Toll House break-apart kind work perfectly!  Just place one in the bottom of each cup and bake for about ten minutes before adding the cream cheese mixture, and then top with cherries.  They were really good!

This was a really nice recipe, I did use chocolate crumbs and marg for the base as no wafers to use. I didn't use cupcake papers I did use aluminium trays (about the size of a small meat pie) they turned out great, never had any sinking centers and only one had a small crack across the top. I did half the recipe as there are only 2 of us...I will make this again..

Took suggestion of others to add 8 oz. sour cream, an additional 1/4 cup of sugar. Crust:Used 2 1/2 cups of crushed waffers with 1/4 stick of melted butter. Topped the cheese cakes with cherry pie filling. Delicious.

These were just ok. Nothing special, wont be making them again. I also had the same problem as many other reviewers with the centers caving in. And the nilla wafers seemed too soggy.

These were very good. I topped them with the cherry pie filling like in the picture and they were so pretty. I only wish it made more. Next time I will double the recipe or make mini ones. Also I had to cook longer that indicated. (maybe just my oven)

These were just okay.  I didn't care for the vanilla wafer at all.  Next time I do something like this I will definitely take the time to make the crust with graham crackers.  I love vanilla wafers, but they didn't offer much crust at all.  They did also seem to be a little soggy.  Also, they tasted MUCH better after being refridgerated over night.

These where SO easy to make!!! Make sure the rack is not close to the bottom of the oven because either the tops wont cook all the way or the bottoms will end up a little more brown than they should be. Also, i covered the top of half of them with fresh blueberries before cooking them... made them beautiful and tastey. also fresh strawberries on the other half with a strawberry glaze, they really where beautiful on display and very yummy to eat! thanks for the recipe! i will defiantly make these again

I loved this recipe. I did crush the cookie for the fact that I don't like anything soggy and I was afraid that they might be. I also cooked them for 25 minutes instead of fifteen. These were great and everyone that I made them for loved them. Thank you for this easy recipe. My three year old even got to help!

BRILLIANT! BRILLIANT! BRILLIANT! 
My guests thought I purchased it :o) Thank you so very much.  One tiny thing I personally didn't quite love was the fact that the wafer came out soggy... my guests DID NOT have a problem with this though :o) I also think it's *LOVELY* when served chilled. Thanx again Diana!

So simple! For a pretty topping, I melted some milk chocolate chips and piped a very thin swirl onto the unbaked filling, ran a toothpick back and forth to make a spiderweb-ish pattern, then baked. I was worried about the centers being so jiggly after only 15 minutes, but after chilling it was perfect. Next time I might try making the crust like another reviewer suggested, by crushing the cookies and mixing with butter like a traditional cheesecake crust. A great recipe for taking to gatherings.

These were not my favorite.  They ended up having a really strange taste.  Way too rich and just not a very good flavor.  I placed a chocolate chip in the center of each and was hoping it would melt into it some, but it didn't.  Maybe I did something wrong, but they baked kind of unevenly and then flattened out and got dense when they were cool.  My fiance and roommates thought they were okay, but I didn't like them at all.

I can't thank Diana enough. It was so awesome that I made this recepie twice in one week. Some for work and some for home.  My roommate could not get enough and stated that she will never purchase another cheese cake from the store.  My co-workers, which are all males could not stop raving about it.  They did have more that their share though.  I also followed that suggestion of one of the other reviews by adding an ounce of white chocolate and the sour cream mixture and topped it off with rasberries.  I had many people request the recepie, including my older sister who made it for her husband.  She put strawberry glaze on the plate and a fanned strawberry on the top and it was a big hit.  Her husband couldn't get enough.  THANKS SOOOO VERY MUCH FOR THIS RECEPIE BECAUSE IT IS SURELY A KEEPER.

This was a very quick recipe and easy to make.  I made this for my husband's work get together.  I love quick and easy recipes, and this one definitely meets the criteria.  It tasted just like Chic Fil-A cheesecake.

This is a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe that gives the impression that you spent hours slaving away. I recently made these for a graduation party and they were gone in 5 minutes flat...No Joke!! I topped them with cherry and apple pie filling to fill-in the centers that had collapsed and they turned out perfect. A definite keeper!

Wow!  This one is so quick and super easy to make!  I used ginger snaps in place of the vanilla wafers. They were great.  I also had a problem with the center falling (not uncommon with many cheese cake recipes however)- So to make them look great I topped them with assorted fruit pie fillings.

Oh my these are so GOOD.  I can not believe how easy they were to prepare. I added a touch of fresh lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture. I used graham cracker crumbs with butter and sugar for crust instead of the Vanilla wafer.  Topped with a little sour cream and fresh Blackberries after baking and I took the other reviewers advice and refrigate overnight.  WHAT A TREAT!!! my friends were in a Cheesecake eating FRENZY :o)

Did anyone else experience the centers of the cake falling?

Thank you for a wonderfully delicious recipe.

This recipe is EASY and delicious.
I took it to a Bible Study and everyone raved on how scrumptious these little cheese cup cakes were.  And they thought I had worked all day on them.

Delicious!  even got a thumbs up from my picky boys! I did make the changes suggested,  I added a cup of sour cream, increased the sugar by 1/4 cup, and for the crust used two and a half cups of crushed wafers with 1/4 cup butter pressed to the bottom of the cupcake liners. It was easy and I got tons of compliments from family and friends on Thanksgiving.

Hello there,
I have successfully made the cheesecakes and they taste delicious!
I have two questions though.

Can you bake the cheesecake without the cupcake cases? So just in the muffin tin. Would it disturb the layering etc?

And can you use vanilla bean extract instead of just vanilla extract? Would it change the taste?

Thank you

Great recipe as is. I had to use digestive biscuits as graham crackers aren't all that easy to find outside the US; however, this recipe draws accolades from everyone I serve it to. A credit to the recipe is that the sweetness is where it should be and not overwhelming like some other recipes.

Everytime I make these, they are gone within minutes.  Everybody raves about how delicious they are.  I sometimes use vanilla wafer cookies for the bottom of the cups but have also used crushed animal crackers or crushed graham crackers.  I also top these with berries.  They are easy to make and such a hit!

Thanks for this wonderful recipe. We topped ours with fresh strawberries. My youngest daughter who is three helped make this and it was super easy and lots of fun for us to do together. My girls loved these so much, we will keep this recipe for many years to come. Thanks again

Great tasting and EASY!   loved it!  I didn't have wafer cookies, so I used Girl Scout's Shortbread cookies instead, and it was yummy.  I did a variety of toppings - strawberry, cherry, and chocolate ones. A+

I did what many people suggested, crushed the wafers and blended with butter for the crust as well as added a cup of sour cream. I loved it! What's better is that my husband loved it and he can be hard to please.

OMG, these were so awesome and easy.  I followed Schafer5 reviewer's suggestions with the sour cream and wafer crushed crust, and it was soooooo good.  I also used the other reviewers suggestion to skip the cherry filling topping and used sliced strawberries instead and it looked like a professional pastry. 've never cooked cheesecake before and wasn't sure about the timing, as 15 minutes just didn't look cooked enough so I left it in another 10 and it turned out well although I saw after the ate them that another reviewer wrote she cooked it 45 minutes, so I may leave them in longer next time. This is definitely a winner.

Did follow other reviews and added 1 cup of sour cream, and used a full cup of white sugar.  I used a whole box of Vanilla wafers, ground them up and added 1/4 cup of melted butter as the crust. I might add a pink of lemon juice to give it a kick next time.

I added mini chocolate chips to 1.2 of the batter and they were great.  For the toppings I used canned blueberries and red raspberries in their own syrup, fresh blueberries and raspberries and I shaved dark chocolate on top, they were terrific!  

So easy and so good.  I will make these again and again.

These are excellent. I brought them into work with me, and all my coworkers think I'm a master baker! I crushed the vanilla wafers and mixed in some melted butter for a crust, rather than using just the cookie, but that was the only change I made to this recipe. I'll definitely be making these again, and probably soon.

I crushed the vanilla wafers with butter as others had suggested and also doubled the recipe as I am taking this to my son's Kindergarten Grad. Party.  I came out with about 30, I was expecting more.  Next time I will use mini cupcake foils to make them bite size.  Overall, these are delicious and I will make them again and again.

These were awesome and easy.  I added about 1tsp of lemon zest to the cheese mixture. I made a recipe for graham cracker crust which I divided evenly and pressed into the 24 cups. It was the perfect amount. They tasted best after a couple days.

These little cupcakes are great!  You can take them anywhere and dress them up however you like.  I have used the wafers whole and crushed and I think both ways are fine.  They are best if you can leave them in the fridge for at least two hours.  I like to garnish mine with a dollop of cool whip fresh fruit and some chocolate and a sprig of mint.  People will gobble these up!

Very good plain or with your favorite topping. I usually use short bread cookies for the crust b/c I love them but the Wafers are good too.

Wow, these were good and very simple to make.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white and topped with blueberry pie filling.  Oh boy, were they good!

Love it: Simple ingredients, delicious, and easy. Purchased the Nilla Wafer pie crust instead of individual cookies. My husband said it was one of the best cheese cakes he's had. I did have to cook it for an additional 15 minutes though (still a little wobbly in center after 15). Then chilled it in frig for ~2 hrs as previously suggested.

Quick and easy to make A+++. I did as previous posters had suggested. Added sourcream and crushed the cookie and added butter to make a crust at the bottom. I added a bit of almond extract as well. They were devoured in no time. Definetly making again.

Wow!  This is so good! I took the advise of some other comments and added a little sour cream to the cream cheese, then stirred in a whole bag (way too much) chocolate chips.  I also used ginger snaps instead of wafers, and it was great.  I used the paper muffin liners, and they were hard to peel off.  Next time I'll try using the metallic type.  The cooking time was at least 30-35 minutes - not the 15 the recipe calls for.  Thanks for such a great, easy treat!!

I had to make a last minute dessert for a cookout and these were a real hit!  Within 30 minutes I had a delicious dessert made.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla to give the cheesecake a little different flavor.  The great thing about these is that you can top them with whatever you want! Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

This cheesecake was delicious! Instead of using the Nilla wafer cookies, I made my own crust with cinnamon-graham crackers,"Maria" cookies, and dashes of nutmeg (Yum!) I also used another review's advice and added one cup of sourcream to the recipe. Because of this I also changed the sugar amount from 3/4C to a full cup. Try it..it's a hit!

Very tasty... I love cheesecake.  I was, however, disappointed that they sunk in after coming out of the oven.  They were a hit in my house and I will make them again.

These were just great! I changed it a bit and added some brandy instead of vanilla in fact I doubled that. My son was going to go a cheesecake from the cheesecake factory and I suggested that he just make these for Thanksgiving I think there better and a hell of a lot cheaper. I will use this recipe over and over again. Good job!

These taste great!  They are not as pretty as I'd hoped, though, so they do not work well to turn out onto a dessert plate with raspberry sauce, but they are great when not for company!

So good and so easy.  It was my son's birthday and he 'loves' cheese cake.  So I searched allrecipes and decided on this one. Pressed for time, I let my 
9 year old and a very new at cooking 18 year old make this. No problems and it is so very good. Everyone loved it and we will have it again.  Thanks.

The BEST cheesecake recipe I've ever found!! I've always wanted to make cupcake sizes, but the making the graham crust is always a pain! Substituting it for vanilla wafer cookies is a wonderful idea.  I've added a piece of beligum wafer cookie on top of fruit toppings and cool-whip, to cover up the cracks, and everyone loves them!

I followed the directions to crush the cookies and add some butter to the crumbs to make the crust.  Nice dessert to take to a potluck.

I made this filling and used it in a homemade pie crust. My family loved it! I made a fresh blueberry sauce to top it with! Compliments all the way around.

My husband and I are on the “Keto” diet and I try hard to find recipes that fit into our eating lifestyle. This recipe was perfect! I omitted the cookie and went crust less. The suggestion of adding sour cream and a bit more sugar were Right On! Instead of regular sugar I used Splenda. They came out nice and creamy.

No changes other than swapping out the sugar for Swerve sweetener. Super Easy recipe. I added raspberry pie filling and a few mini choc chips on the top of each serving.

A family favorite that is always asked for during the holidays. Listening to the other reviews defiantly helped. Using the Cheeseman crackers and sour cream was the best suggestion.  The cupcakes are amazing !!!

I did not have the wafers, but went with the "cookie on the bottom"idea. Lemon Oreos (separated into their halves) were awesome. I did take suggestions of others for the sour cream and added sugar, but I think next time I'll skip the extra sugar. There will be many next times for this recipe!

I have used this recipe for about 25 years and its perfect, as a New York style. Add the 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup sugar makes it a creamer cheesecake. Both are great and quick.

Sometimes you just need a base to start, then you modify to your likes. I read other reviews so added the cup of sour cream, instead of sugar I used splenda and to make it tart, because I love key lime pie, added the juice of 5 key limes at the end. I put the ingredients in my food processor. (make sure you add the key lime juice at the end) 
5 stars for a great inspiration for the non regular bakers.

These were great, I made them for a party at my house and everyone loved them.  My mother who thinks I can't cook for some reason asked "did you make the cakes?"  Yes 
Mother I did, thanks to this recipe.  Everyone was asking me for the recipe.  My mom's birthday is coming up so I'm going to take the recipe and make a cake out of it for her.  :-)

I made a Graham cracker crust rather than the vanilla wafer crust only because that's what I had. Other than that, I followed the recipe. They were just okay.

My husband loved it, and some I swirled chocolate syrup and chocolate chips.  The only problem was the cookies were too small for the cups.  What I ended up doing was crumbling them, added butter and cooked it for 5 minutes as the other recipe did with the graham cracker crumbs.

I substituted sweet crackers for the vanilla wafers and added some butter to them before using them as the base. I also found it was okay to not use the muffin cups, less convenient, but if you do not have them it is not an "end all".

This was amazing and delicious. My niece and I enjoyed making this together, and they were a win over with the family. We didn't have wafer's on hand so we made the base with melted butter and gram cracker crust. Only complaint, was use more cherries next time. :)

This is great, especially since people like to eat their cheesecake differently. I leave some plain, so people can add their own fruit if they like. Also you can take a few extra cookies and either stick them in the middle shark-fin style or crumble them to cookie dust and sprinkle on top!

This recipe is the best recipe I'v found on allrecipes.com!!!!!!! I think instead of 1 wafer cookie in the bottom u should put 2. I can't wait to make these for a family get together!

Great recipe. I did as other reviewers suggested and used a graham cracker crust and added sour cream to the cream cheese batter. Topped with cherry pie filling and it was delicious. Makes for nice small portions. The hard part is eating only one!

(Review of original unaltered recipe) I didn't really like them.I really don't think they are sweet enough, the vanilla wafer by itself on the bottom was not enough, and the baking time is wrong. So...they were OK. But I would opt for a different recipe for our next event and am considering throwing something else together to replace these. I do have one recommendation: **use foil cupcake cups!!**     I used half foil and half paper and the paper ones just don't hold up to the weight of these cheesecakes.

I absolutely love this... so easy to make and quick to enjoy. I love putting strawberries on top. I put a little of maple syrup to tone down down the cream cheesey taste and crushing the cookie but other than that, this is my #1 go to quick dessert.

I also increased the sugar and added a cup of sour cream based on other reviews.  This was  excellent.

This is the easiest and best cheese cake ever!! We LOVE it!! Made it for my daughters birthday and my husband requested it the next week for his!  I have made some changes..... I use 1 cup of cottage cheese in place of one brick of cream cheese (put through blender 1st) this adds loads of protein! I only put in 1/2 of sugar and I add a tbsp of instant coffee powder, and 4-5 chocolate chips on top...yumm!  Tonight I used Leclerc Celebration caramel filling truffle cookie for the bottom....very excited to try!  I have used another little cookie that Mr.Christie makes (yellow box) my husband likes these as they give the perfect size crust.  I have also used for my celiac friends a reeces pieces cup for the bottom.  once cooled serve with a little whipped cream and raspberries for garnish (if you want).....such the perfect dessert!

Giving this only four stars because like many others, i crushed butter cookies with butter for the base. Apart from that, the cheese cake itself was great.
 I used home made cherry pie filling using the recipe uploaded by mgiampietro07.

These were a hit with my cheese cake- afficionado friends. Do add the extra sugar and sour cream, though. Also, I made the more traditional graham cracker crust using butter and honey.

This is a great recipe! I did it a little different myself.  I crushed up gramcrackers and added some melted butter to make a crust.  I made an actual cheese cake instead of cupcakes.  For the top I melted semi sweet chocolate chips, fudge and butter then added choped walnuts.  (only cause I didnt have cherries) It turned out great for a baked cheesecake! I had quite a few and this is a good very simple recipe.  I do perfer a no bake cheesecake though.

I took the advice of other reviewers and put the sour cream and extra sugar and it came out ok but it just wasn't creamy the way that cheese cake is supposed to be. Although it is a hit, I prefer real cheese cake. Not to mention I had to bake them for 25 mins and not 15 as the recipe calls for. So its four stars because they are a hit but, they are not very creamy. If you like light cheese cake go for the sour cream. I'm going to try them without the sour cream next time to see if they come out more like real cheese cake.

These were fantastic! I did add a cup of sour cream and 1 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of lemon juice, like some of the others. I also used the crushed vanilla waffers with 1/2 cup butter for the crust. I topped with blueberry pie filling. Will for sure make these again.

These were pretty good.  My boyfriend loved them.  I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used a little less than a tsp. of wildflower honey instead, and it tasted great.  Next time I will go with vanilla, and add a layer of sour cream on top.  Yum!

My husband liked these, but I thought they were too bland.  Maybe would've been better with fruit topping.  I followed some reviewers' suggestions and added 1 c. sour cream & an extra 1/4 c. sugar.  For the crust I combined 2 1/2 c. crushed wafers with 1/4 c. melted butter.

This is good, but I liked it better with this modifications(1)boxed crushed graham crackers with brown sugar and butter ( direction on the box) instead of wafers (2)fresh strawberries on the tops of the cake cups and drizzle with melted chocolate (3) mixing cream cheese ( buying whipped cream cheese saves time) and sour cream 2:1 ratio

These were good, but the ones I made with whole cookies in the bottom of the cups were not as good as the ones I made with a crumb crust. It didn't take any extra time and was so much better. I put strawberries and syrup on top. Bluebirds boxed one. It was super yummy, and easy.

I love to make this dessert! It tastes great, and is so easy to make. The first few times I made it, I stuck with simple toppings but am really enjoying messing around with different flavors. 

I would recommend larger muffin cups, and I tend to stick with at least two wafers on the bottom.

I may be one of the only people who wasn't thrilled with this recipe. Maybe it was me -- the edges burnt a little before the centers were fully cooked -- but I didn't like the burnt cheesecake taste at all.

This was great.  I needed something fast and easy for a work pot luck.  They were gone before everyone finished lunch.  I put just rasberries and strawberries on top.

These were really good.  I made them for Easter brunch.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that the cookie in the bottom goes soft and then you can't really pick it up to eat it.

I love this recipe. Try it with the mini
pecan sandies or chocolate chip cookies
for a different taste then the vanilla wafers. They are good also.

Wonderful! I crushed the vanilla wafers (2 per cupcake) and filled the muffin cups with the crumbles because the wafers are so small. I topped them with cherry pie filling and they disappeared before my eyes.

The taste of this recipe is really good, and it's so easy to make. The vanilla wafer didnt quite make enough crust, so you can try combining crushed graham cracker and butter to make a crust. Also, mine cracked, and needed more time than what was said in the recipe. Every oven is different so be sure to check them often. I hope you have better luck than I did! But I will definatly try this recipe again.

I made graham cracker crust from a recipe found on allrecipes, and this turned out great!  I will definitely be making this again soon.  The best part is the ability for everyone to choose their own toppings - it really makes dessert fun!

These we easy to make and went over well with my fiance. I use two vanilla wafers (one facing bottom, one facing top) and had to cook them longer than indicated. Very good.

This was a great recipe! I like the fact that it was simple, quick and tasty all in one. Since I had a taste for chocolate, I made a chocolate graham cracker crust and added mini-chocolate chips to the batter. It was great! Oh, I used cherry filling on the second batch! Thanks!

Wonderful Recipe! Extremely Easy! I served this for dessert at church (I cook/serve 60+ people before Wed. service). It was a hit, we sold out! I'll make more next time! I used jumbo muffin pans (with liners), crushed up the nilla wafers with a little butter and brown sugar. Doubled the recipe and made 26 large cups. Topped with strawberries. Thanks for this great recipe!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM....can only say it all.  As suggested by others I modified it using some sour cream and reducing some of the other ingredients and by doing so, I have made this 4 times since printing it in the last 2 weeks.  A very quick recipe and very delicous.  Everyone asked for the recipe...Thank you!

my first time baking ever! this recipe turn out perrrrrrfect, my boyfriend really enjoyed it and thought I had natural talent in the kitchen, which I beg to differ lol.  I now make this for my family and friends and they all love this recipe.  The only 2 things I altered is the crust and topping. Instead of putting in a whole wafer cookie I crushed a bunch in a bag with a hammer (good way of releasing anger lol) and added butter, then mold it into a nice crust at the bottom of the paper muffin cups. With the topping I cooked fresh strawberries with sugar into a nice sauce and topped the cheese cupcakes. Thanks Diana you're awesome....

EXCELLENT!!!  I made these for a party and they were a huge hit.  I think that these were probably one of the easiest things that I've ever made.  I topped mine off with canned strawberry topping but they were just as good plain.

My daughter is in a dessert club in 6th grade.  It was her turn to bring something and she choose this recipe.  It was a hit.  The individual cups worked perfect for the club.  She added a strawberry slice to each when served.

This is an awesome recipe! I just found it last week and am about to make it the third time. My family of 4 guys can't get enough and I made it for a church supper and everyone there loved it also. I topped the cups with a spoonful of berry pie filling. Instructions are perfect. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

My guests thought a bakery had supplied these for a meeting we had, they thought they looked so beautiful! I definately recommend using cherry or strawberry topping to pretty it up. I tried using powdered sugar for an even better presentation but the sugar dissolved in the topping. Still a hit!

I made these for Christmas this year, they were wonderfully easy and very delicious.  I think I over cooked them though and after I took them out of the oven they lost some of their volume.  But the topping suggestions took care of that.  Thank you Diana.

This recipe is just AWESOME! I made these for Thanksgiving this year, and we have a very large group of people, 60+. I did several batches, some just plain others with strawberries and cherries and they were gone!!! Thanks for sharing such a easy and wonderful recipe.

This dessert deserves stars for being simple and for tasting like cheesecake with less hassle!!! The beauty of it is that you can always vary the recipe up by doing whatever you want with the taste, like adding chocolate or lemon. I did bake mine for about 25 minutes instead, as after only 15 they looked quite unappetizing. Crushing the Nilla wafers and mixing a little butter in makes a perfect crust!!

AWESOME, EASY, and FUN!  I loved this recipe and so did my four year old daughter.  I did have to cook them about 25 minutes vs. 15 but other than that no problems.  Then I topped them with Cherry Pie filling which completed them.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again and again!

Not only did I add a generous amount of cinnamon, I also substituted butter flavor for the vanilla.  Yum!  It tastes and smells just like Cinnabons.

Quick and easy!  A good use of all the extra cream cheese I had lying around!  I stirred too many chocolate chips in with the batter I thought it to be a little overpowering, they taste much better with only one or two chocolate chips per muffin.  I made these again and instead of stirring chocolate chips in with the batter I put them on top with a few broken walnuts.  Yummy!  Tasted much better like this. Great recipe!

This recipe is so good and so easy to make that I will definitely use it in the future. I made it last night for the first time, and my boyfriend is still telling me how good of a cook I am. If he only knew it took me less than 1/2 an hour to make!

YUMMY!! These are a great bite-sized treat to have in the fridge, send for kids lunches, etc. I crush the vanilla wafers and add melted butter before pressing into cupcake liners.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 cup of sour cream and increased the sugar to 1 cup.  I have also added mini choc. chips to batter or swirled raspberry jam into batter (sometimes both!!)  Also I usually use almond extract instead of vanilla.  I usually top with a squirt of whipped cream--delicious!  Note: It takes these longer to cook in my oven--about 25 minutes.

These get a 5 for being so easy and delicious! It didn't quite taste like cheesecake to me, but I still really liked the flavor. Put some cherry pie filling on top and viola! P.S. - We had to bake these longer than 15min. Will make 'em again, thanks!!

This recipe is soooo easy to make. Every year I make these for our Easter season fish fry and I also bring along a can of pie filling to top it off with. They are always the first to go and I always double the recipe. My husband sneaks a few before I can get them out the door. (Use a mixer instead of mixing by hand.)

These were still RAW after 15 min.  By the time they were browned on the top, I may have overcooked them a bit.  I filled the well in the center with chocolate chips, which worked out well.  A good snacky kind of dessert, but kind of small.  Count on more than one per person unless these are for school lunches or a buffet.

These were okay.  The texture was too eggy, not smooth like cheesecake should be.  But the flavor was pretty good.  I topped mine with a bit of raspberry jam, and used Chocolate Nilla Wafers for the crust.

These were so easy to make, and tasted pretty good too.  My cheesecake-loving-6-year-old son loved these as an after school snack.  Much cheaper than buying a cheesecake or those expensive little refrigerated cheesecake snacks.

I used a mini muffin tin for these.  I put a whole wafer in the bottom and filled it to the rim.  Unfortunately the wafer floated a bit so next time I will crush them or omit them all together.  This is my favorite recipe.  Thank you.

I threw these together in no time at all, and my roommates loved them. I used whole ginger snaps in the bottom to give it a little bite, because I didn't use any topping.
