Trying to replace a similar recipe I tried making these cookies. They turned out much more dry than what I expected and the flavor just wasn't there.  I think if i would not have drained the pineapple so heavily they wouldn't have been so dry.  My advice drain the excess juice but don't sqeeze out the juice from the meat of the pineapple.

Awesome cookies... so soft and chewy.  My kids, my husband and I can't stay away from them. I think i'm going to have to make some more today!!  Be sure to keep them on the pan for 5 minutes before removing to the cooling rack.  They have to "set" before you can remove them --otherwise, they'll fall apart.

Wow! These were good.
Except, I did not have shortening, 
so I used butter.
Also, I made a cream cheese icing and threw
some pineapple chunks in it. Yum!
Since this was something for work, I
added a slice of strawberry to the top.
Not bad.  Guess I'll find out tomorrow! ;-)

I made these tonight, and I have a few comments... first, my fault, I should have drained the crushed pineapple better I guess because my batter/dough, while light and fluffy, was very wet. So the first cookie sheet I baked the full 10 minutes and took out becuase I was afraid the bottoms would burn. Well I shouldnt have worried - they were so underdone I had to toss them. The next batch I baked longer, and increased the oven temp slightly - these turned out much better.  The cookie doesnt spread hardly at all, so if your "rounded spoonfuls" are not perfectly smooth, the cookies will be rather odd shaped, needing icing or something to pretty them up.  All of that aside, the cookie is just boring. I was looking forward to trying a new flavor/ingredient in my cookie baking, but I am disappointed. The cakelike texture is fine with me, as is the level of sweetness. But it's missing something. Maybe follow the suggestion of another reviewer to add walnuts or coconut. I probably wont make these again unless someone new reviews the recipe and has some suggestions on improving it.

We loved them!  I looked for a recipe to use up a big can of crushed pineapple in the pantry.  The cookies were simple and turned out light, just a little sweet, soft and fluffy.  I had never made or eaten pineapple cookies so I was very delighted!  My daughter insisted on pink cookies and so we added some pink food coloring.  Might make more sense with yellow.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious and easy!  The cookies are soft almost cake-like and have a great pineapple flavor. These are great to make for something different. Next time I am going to try adding some coconut and walnuts for a more hawaiian flavor!

Good.  Very fluffy.  I substituted butter for shortening.  I'd like to try it with white sugar.  Keep them small.  They tend to spread a lot.  They seem to have a sheen to them while they're still hot, so it was a little tricky sometimes to just look at them and know if they were done.

I thought these turned out great! They were nice and soft, and had a great flavor that wasn't too sweet, wasn't too bland. I used a 12 oz. can of crushed pineapple instead of the 8 oz and just added a little bit more flour to make up for the added moisture. Thought they were great!

Tried this recipe yesterday to give my wife a piece ofÂ her childhood back, her Nanny made them for her when she was a child. One bite of these cookies and
she had tears in her eyes from that special treat. Later on I got a special treat of my own!

Very good and light (not necessarily calorie wise). I took them to a neighborhood get together and they went over very well. I had to bake them longer than the 8 to 10. I had a hard time telling when to take them out. I thought there was just a little something lacking maybe cinnamon.

They weren't inedible but I'll never take the time to make them again. They were very cake like and kind of underdone at 10 minutes for 325. The flavor wasn't spectacular either. I have another batch that I'm going to make at 350 instead. I added butterscotch chips to all the dough and I added some coconut flakes to about a quarter of the cookies.

I followed the directions - got tasteless cookies.. not pineapple at all.. Not really anything at all. The texture was more like a biscuit. I make made from scratch cookies all the time and have never had any turn out like these. Will not be making again.

Not exactly sure what happened but I followed this recipe word for word and they came out super flat and far too cakey.  The taste is so-so, SO I'll have them with some ice cream.

I really wanted these cookies to turn out (despite all the lukewarm reviews)but they just didn't work for me. I used butter instead of shortening, and I added 1 tbsp coconut extract to make them pina colada cookies. I am really surprised that something with so much sugar in it can be so tasteless. I added a pineapple coconut icing and only then were these cookies actually edible.

SUPER easy. SUPER fluffy. Makes A LOT. I got 48 mini muffin cups and 36 standard cookies out of it, with batter left to spare. But... recipe doesn't call for draining the pineapple and I wish I would've for a more concentrated flavor. I had done a double batch with a 20oz can instead of two 8oz cans, so there was plenty in there! I'd also maybe add a dash more vanilla. The mini muffin cups I made had a half marachino cherry on the bottom which added the perfect amount of flavor to make this taste like Auntie's pineapple dessert. Will make again, with tweaks!

I'll make it again, but I added extra pineapple and cooked several minutes longer.  Still soft and delicious!  Just like a recipe my Grandma made.

I followed this recipe to a T event though I was skeptical about the oven temp, amount of baking powder and the cooking time. I was right, they came out quite raw, completely undone inside with just a thin layer cooked on the outside. I bumped up the temp and stretched the cooking time to 11 minutes, and got a batch that was edible. But, very "bready". I made a second batch, and added a half cup of granulated sugar, cut the baking powder to 1/2 tsp. baked 'em at 350 for 9 minutes and got a batch that some said they liked. they were a bit chewey. No one was fond of these at all by the published recipe. I checked my oven to make sure the temp was spot-on and it was only off one degree F. I use two timers (1 on a necklace so I can move about and not get distracted), and both keep perfect time, so baking time was perfect. I'm always a little shy of cookie recipes that call for baking powder. Some come out all right. But, these tasted more like pan-cakes with pineapple in them than cookies.

I added ginger, cinnamon and cloves, as well as 1/2 cup of walnuts, and really liked the result. Definitely wetter and stickier than most cookie recipes (has anyone tried adding a little extra flour?), and the pineapple taste is very subtle, but the finished cookies are soft and sweet. Keeping the cookies small seems to be the secret to getting them to bake well.

I Love this recipe.  My kids loved the cookies.  I did add a third cup of flower, a tsp extra shortening and I used chunky pineapple.  They turned out GREAT.  Thank you!

I made these again this time using Splenda brown sugar blend (1/2 cup = 1 cup regular brown sugar) and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups regular. I also used 2 small cans of pineapple rings in the blender, last time I thought they weren't very flavorful with just one can, this time they're definitely pineapple-y and better. Also used butter, less than what was called for due to the extra pinneapple juice. Very good and quite healthy!

This was a good recipe... not too sweet.  I did add chopped walnuts and chopped dried apricots for more substance.  The cookie had a cake-like consistency.  My staff loved them!

Very soft and moist. Used dark brown sugar-(all I had). Doubled the recipe as I only had a 20 oz can of chunked pineapple. ( I put the pineapple in the blender and made crushed.) Thanx Lady Jade.

I didn't have enough pineapple for the recipe so I substituted 4oz. crushed peaches which turned out very well.  Not too sweet and very cake-like.
