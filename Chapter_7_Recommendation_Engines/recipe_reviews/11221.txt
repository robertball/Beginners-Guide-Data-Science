A new addition to my Christmas cookie list. Very tasty!!!!. I had to bake them longer than the recipe said, at least 11 minutes.

A little too sweet for us. Perhaps a decrease in thea mount of dates would help.

Good recipe. Makes the kind of cookie I wanted in terms of taste and texture. I'd suggest adding some spices to the mix, to make it more like a fruit cake flavour. I also needed about 1/4 c more milk to incorporate all the flour.

  Overall, a keeper recipe.

I substituted candied pineapple (chopped) for the citrus peel.  I liked these very much.
