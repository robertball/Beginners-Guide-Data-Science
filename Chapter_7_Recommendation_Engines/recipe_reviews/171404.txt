WOW! These are soo good, I juiced all the fruit ahead of time and it was a breeze to whip these up and the taste is fabulous!! Although I did switch the name to Alamo Martinis..LOL Thanks for sharing!! What a difference the fresh juice makes, I will never go pre-mixed again!! Will be making these often =)

Austin is my second home and this drink brings me back!!! I skip the olives but add an orange or lemon slice. These are the best!! Perfect for the summer!

This was pretty tasty. I used tequila gold because I do not like silver, and Triple Sec in place of orange juice and Cointreau. And the olive, strangely enough, tasted really good in the drink!

I had never had a Mexican Martini until I moved to Central Texas- now that's all I order when we go out.  These are great, and go down very smooth.  My kids loved them when they were out for a visit too.

I have lived in Austin most of my life and agree this is one of the best margaritas!! I LOVE olives so I add some of the juice when mixing everything together! Also, skip OJ and use a splash of triple sec!!

This is delicious! I only used one jigger of lime and I thought it was perfect.

This was perfect, though I did use Gold (never tried Silver yet, will have to though) and because I refuse to use mixes (corn syrup, etc) this is a healthy cocktail with WHOLE foods!  Loved it!
