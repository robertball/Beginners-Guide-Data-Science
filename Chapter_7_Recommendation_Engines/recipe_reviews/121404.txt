Very good. I am the only one in my family who will eat spinach so I substituted a little Italian Sausage. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Even my youngest who is very picky liked it. I sprinkled it with a shredded Parmesan/Romano blend right before serving. Thanks for sharing!

This dish received rave reviews from my dinner guests and was so easy to make. Even better, I was able to prepare the whole dish the night before and then just bake it right before dinner so I had time to do other things. Also, Kraft makes a parmesan/romano/asiago blend in a shaker jar and it worked out really well in place of the individual amounts of parmesan and romano. It wasn't that old-fashioned 'green can' parmesan I feared it might be, it was really fresh. I used the whole 7 oz jar so there was no measuring and no waste (I couldn't find individaul parmesan or romano is less than 8 oz containers) and the asiago adds depth. One package of thawed frozen spinach was the right amount for me.  Definitely will be making this one again.

Based on other reviews, I used one package of frozen chopped spinach, all ricotta cheese and no cottage cheese, and the Kraft parmesan/romano/asiago mix. Turned out great! One pack of shells made enough for me to freeze and we had 3 meals (for 2 people) off of this one recipe!

This recipe was very, very good.  My only suggestion would be to cut back on the spinach just a little bit.  Otherwise, this is an excellent dish.  We've found our Christmas dinner tradition!  Thank you!

This was awesome.  I used a little blanched broccoli instead of spinach and romano instead of mozzarella.  Really, if you stay with the proper amounts of cheeses, you can't go wrong!

This is so easy to make, and it turned out absolutely delicious. I substituted the cottage cheese for another cup of ricotta, and added diced cooked chicken. It's so good, and everyone who ate it can't stop raving!

I live on a small Marine Corps Base in Japan and the small commissary didn't have ricotta cheese available, so I used feta cheese instead.  Also, I don't like provolone cheese so I replaced that with mozzerella cheese and the recipe was SO SO good!!!!!

Made these using the Mix of Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano cheese. Man the Asiago really made the flavor POP!

I omitted the spinach, cause neither I or my boyfriend really like it. We also used ricotta and no cottage cheese. I added mozzarella instead of provolone because that's what we had. And instead of 24oz of tomato sauce we did 14oz of tomato sauce and 15oz of alfredo sauce. We also sprinkled a little extra mozzarella on top. It turned out amazing.

I thought this was a lot of work and didn't have amazing taste or texture.  I was the only one in my family that ate it :(  Could be that stuffed shells aren't for us...

I liked it. Substituted all ricotta for the cottage cheese because I hate it. Followed the rest as is and was very good.

ok only changed a few things.  I did not add the egg (i hate cooking with eggs) it did make my filling a bit runny and melty when it was done but that is fine with me.  I did not use the cheese recommend I just used up the shredded cheeses I had in the fridge.  and I just LOVE cottage cheese, so instead of half cottage, half ricotta, I just used all cottage cheese.  I loved it very much and will make again :-)

This is a GREAT recipe! Only change I made was to use 2 cups or ricotta and skipped the cottage cheese. Also a pinch of nutmeg is a nice touch :)

My husband requests this recipe often! We LOVE it!  We have alternated using spinach a time and 1lb of Italian sausage on others! The only tweak I make is adding a little garlic salt (Lawry's with parsley) but that is because my husband loves salt.  I make my own sauce (from allrecipe). It is perfect just the way it is written! Thank you!
