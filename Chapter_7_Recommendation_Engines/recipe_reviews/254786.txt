This was delicious. I made two minor changes. I was afraid the asparagus would be undercooked so I added it to the sautéed veggies about one minute before they were done. I also used bacon instead of ham because I had some bacon already cooked in the freezer. I used more than two slices of provolone because I love cheese in an omelet. The provolone was an unusual ingredient but it added lots of flavor. Mushrooms would also be good. As the author said, it was filling. I only ate about half and it was great reheated the next day.

Loved it! Great combo of flavors. Mine didn't look the prettiest, but it sure was delicious. I used a combo of Swiss and American cheeses b/c those are my favorites for omelets. I will def be making this again~YUM!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Turned out great.  For two senior adults, I used: just 4 eggs; next time I’d use 3, 2 T. Oil, 8 slices of bacon (next time I’ll use 4 slices.), 1/2 t. Garlic salt.  The full recipe for two people made for a big portion for each of us.  BUT, I will definitely make this again.  It is delicious.

Loved it. Easy to make, and a great portion, too. I didn't used the garlic salt, but regular instead which tasted too salty, but next time I just use less.
