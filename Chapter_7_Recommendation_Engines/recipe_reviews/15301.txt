Excellent. Some advice for those having trouble, sift your flour BEFORE you measure it. Sifted flour is much bigger in volume. If you don't sift you are adding too much flour overall, resulting in too-dry dough. Also, use salted butter, or there's no taste, and let the butter be room-temp soft.
These are classic cookies! Yum!!

I have tried this and, after creaming butter and sugar, I get such a 'melty' batter that I've begun to add powdered sugar to try to firm it up so that it can be rolled out---or even pressed into a pan.  What have I done wrong?

AWSOME!!! I found this recipe mixed together with out any trouble at all . They are my husbands and kids new favorite . I liked to put a little peanutbutter on top for a quick afternoon snack. They store well. and they don't melt and crumble till AFTER they get to your mouth, then yummm !

I baked these for the holidays and they were a big hit.  My kids and I kneaded some mini chocolate chips into the dough and they were awesome!

These were such a hit at Christmas!!  I frosted them w/ a simple powdered sugar frosting, & they just flew off the plate.  The brown sugar gives them a wonderful flavor w/ a hint of nuttiness. ONLY downside was that these were very hard to handle-- it was hard to roll out the dough & cut the cookies, & they were extremely fragile hot from the oven.  I will definitely be making these next year!!

For a roll out dough its not at all good we worked all morning and couldn't get it to stop crumbling. My 9 year brother was VERY frustrated... we ended up making them into thumb print cookies (not easy either!) and filled them with different jams. They ARE delicious but not at all easy when you have a LOT of holiday baking like I do.

Maybe I had trouble rolling because I live in the tropics...it just kept crumbling up on me.  Not to worry, tho, I just pressed into 2 X 9" cake rounds, sprinkled with coloured sugar, baked for 40 min.  WOW!  The cast of my kids' Musical Show went nuts and devoured in less than 5 min.! Thanks, Vel & daughter!

I use this recipe to make toffee chip shortbread cookies. I add a package of toffee chips to the dough(you can find them in the chocolate chip section of the baking aisle in the store). I roll the dough into 2 inch balls, then flatten slightly on the cookie sheet. If I am feeling really festive, I drizzle some melted chocolate over the tops of the cookies after they have cooled.

These cookies are very dependable! Perfect for intricate cookie cutter designs. I enjoyed adding extra butter to the recipe for taste. I eventually made some with everything from toffee chips to sprinkles and even frosted some. very yum!

THE WORST!  I have done about a dozen or so cookie recipes off of here if not more and this was horrible.  My husband who eats anything said they were the worst cookies he has ever had.  They had NO taste and were waaay to dry.  I followed the recipe perfectly and it was just bad.  I have never left less then a 4 star on any recipe.  I dont know what the people who left good ratings did.  I couldnt even fix the recipe I had to throw it all out after I baked the first batch and tasted it.  Yuck!!!!!

I have tried several shortbread recipes looking for my favorite. This is it! Instead of rolling the dough, I pressed it into a jelly roll pan (10" x 15" one recipe fits perfectly) and scored the dough prior to baking, then rescored and cut along the same lines when it came out of the oven. No other changes and the result is an excellent cookie.

I used this recipe for my cookie exchange for Xmas, and they turned out great. I used green and red food colouring to make the cookies look more festive. I also made the 2 colours into bricks and put them together and sliced them into cookies. Made a nice double coloured cookie.

Makes a delicate, light shortbread cookie--A bit crumbly after baking, and easily break, so I wouldn't recommend icing them.  Otherwise they are a fantastic cookie that melts in your mouth.  I use this recipe every year and it's a big hit every time!

Great recipe to have in your repetoire, always goes down a storm every time I make it.  I usually add chocolate chunks to it, or at Christmas use a christmas tree cutter and dip the tops in white chocolate.

Judy was right!  Her mom's shortbread cookie recipe is the best!  :-D  These were simple but absolutely delicious!  I want to add a couple of simple tricks to make these easier to make though.  I used the dough hooks on my mixer to incorporate all the flour.  From a "grocery store check out cookbook" I found a shortbread recipe that called for non pariels (4 Tbsp.

I made a mistake by adding all the flour in at the same time, so it didn't turn out very well. I put gheridelli semi-sweet chocolate chips to make it look appealing, but it looked like it was unbaked chocolate chip cookies. If it wasn't for the chocolate, my friends wouldn't have ate them. However, I liked eating them.

I did not like this recipe at all.  The dough was far too dry and I had to add a good 1/4 - 1/2 cup of liquid to create a consistency suitable for rolling.  Even then the shortbread was too dry and didn't melt in my mouth.  I would suggest another shortbread recipe.

12.19.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15301/vels-christmas-shortbread/ ... Tried subbing white for brown sugar.  Using 4c flour, softer, more buttery taste.  Yum.  Using 5c, still very good; but not as creamy.  Not dry, just less creamy.  Yum.  The prick holes stayed in the 5c, disappeared in the 4c. 5c, 38 minutes.  4c, 35 minutes.
