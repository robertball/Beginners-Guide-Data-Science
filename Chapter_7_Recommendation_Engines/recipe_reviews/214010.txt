I wanted to give these a better rating, but I felt the chicken was a bit bland.  I also don't like mayonnaise, but prefer a plain yogurt style tzaziki sauce - easy to make with plain yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic & lemon juice.  I made these the second time with the changes and marinated my chicken strips for a couple hours in a bit of olive oil, lemon, fresh garlic, oregano and the garam masala.  We grilled these on the grill and heated the pita on there too.  Added the sauce and they were delicious.  I've never had them with a pickle, but my son thought that was a super idea.  Great summer dish and I added a side of Tabouleh salad as a cool salad sticking to the Middle Eastern theme.  Thanks for submitting - one could do alot with this dish to make it the way they like it.  Thanks for serving!

Oh YUM...We LOVED these!!! I have never had/cooked with garam masala, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was wonderful! I also seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and garlic powder (along w/ the garam masala) for extra flavor. I opted to use flatbreads because I felt it would hold up better, and I wasn't disappointed. I only had sliced pickles on hand, so I went with it. Oh, and the garlic mayo just put this over the top!  I really couldn't believe how these simple ingredients ended up being such a delicous sandwich...hubby was even impressed! I will definately be making these again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I did not follow the recipe directions on preparing these. Instead of placing the pita bread flat, then piling the ingredients on top,folding and serving, I placed my Toufayan Pita rounds between two damp paper towels and placed in the microwave for less than a minute. Removed from the microwave, laid the rounds flat and cut in half, making two halves.  I then took my fingers and lifted the cut edges up to form the pita pockets – no  tears in the pita bread and no mess when enjoying the ingredients inside the pocket.   I used  McCormicks ® Gourmet Collection Master Blends Garam Masala and Mt. Olive Deli Style Kosher Dill Relish made with sea salt. Mrs. J, another Buzz Recipe Group participant, suggested the minced garlic be combined with honey to alleviate the “skunky taste" of the garlic and I followed her  suggestion which was spot on.  We enjoyed the Chicken Shawarmas and will be making again.  Thank you for sharing your easy, quick and tasty recipe, Luke Summers.  Recipe Group Selection on June 7, 2014.

I don't have garam masala, so I used a combination of cumin, coriander, ground black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and garlic...and I was supposed to use cardamom too, but I didn't have any. I also used a little salt and a pinch of nutmeg. I just used as much as I thought I needed of everything, but you can look up a recipe for garam masala online too.  Anyway, besides that I sliced up some cucumber since I don't have pickles (yes really). I'm sure I will make this again some time! We had it for dinner but it would be great for lunch too!

Ohmygoodness! These are delicious. My husband and I were looking for something comparable to our favorite Mediterranean restaurant, and I think we found it. The ingredients are so simple that I was honestly surprised at how great it turned out. I am kind of wishing that I had doubled the recipe now so that we could have more leftovers for tomorrow, but I will just have to make this again soon. I was leery about the pickles, but I really think that this would taste kind of plain if they weren't in it. So good! With as much as we liked this, we will probably be making this every week, and that is not like me at all. Thank you for this fabulous recipe, Luke!

RECIPE GROUP: Yum yum yum. DBF actually said, out loud, "it's like a party in my mouth!" He doesn't really talk like that, so, obviously this was a huge win. It was super easy too, once I got past the garam masala (had sticker shock at the grocery store so decided to make my own, using 'Easy Garam Masala' from this site). Somehow managed to run out of fresh garlic so had to use powder :( but that won't happen again! Helped that my pickles were homemade and super garlicky. Loved the ease of preparation and fabulous flavor, can't wait to make again!

I tried this TWICE! The first time, I had to agree with some of the reviews, the chicken is a little bland on the inside. BUT having said that, I think I cut my chicken pieces a little too big the first time. When I did it again, I learned from my mistakes and (1) cut the pieces up SMALLER and (2) marinated the chicken in salt, pepper, oregano, oil and garam masala for a couple of hours. It was delicious! I don't know why there were left overs but when I tasted the chicken shawarma the next day, it tasted even BETTER than the night I cooked it! Since I ran out of pita, I added the chicken to greens and had a CHICKEN SHAWARMA SALAD! :-p

This was tasty, but not exactly what I know of chicken shwarmas. The chicken was pretty close and I liked the added pickles. The garlic is also a must. However, the ones I have tried had the garlic, but it was a slightly different garlic sauce. I also think they had tahini in them too. Also, from what I remember there was also some vegetables lettuce, onions, or something. This sandwich though, was easy to make. I even used the recipe Easy Garam Masala from AR and made what I needed for the recipe. ty

This was outstanding!! Definitely a keeper! My only variances was I used naan instead of pita bread but that was a mistake TBH. We couldn't pick up the shwarmas and had to just scoop the filling with the naan. Dill pickle spears were an interesting touch. I served this with Good for you Greek salad from this site and mixed in a bit of the feta from it in the garlic mayonnaise... Ooh so good!! Thank you!!

My family loved this. It was so tasty and so easy to prepare... a win!! I took another reviewer's advice and made sure to cut the chicken into small pieces and season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written and was very pleasantly surprised. Don't skip the pickle!! (My family also RAVED over the mayo/garlic spread... I didn't have the heart to tell them how easy it was. I might use it on other wraps!)

I have made the chicken for these "Chicken Shawarmas" for years for salads but had never thought to put it in a pita bread. My husband enjoyed it like that. I used Middle-Eastern-style pita bread (which is much lighter than Greek pita bread) wrapped in the Middle-Eastern style ("pita wraps"). I have three homemade variations on Garam Masala made from recipes from different parts of India in my cupboard (Herbs & Spices: The Cook's Reference, Jill Norman), so obviously I think whether or not someone likes this recipe may depend on the type of Garam Masala they use. I think this particular recipe would also be good with Saudi Baharat (a favorite seasoning blend at our home). I used a microplane for my garlic but did not especially like it added directly to mayonnaise: I would let the garlic sit in a tad of honey for 15 minutes to take the "skunky taste" off it before adding it to the mayonnaise next time. Also, my husband prefers his pita wraps with lettuce and tomatoes. Nonetheless, this is a good "quick and easy" meal for a busy day. Thank you Luke Summers for sharing your recipe.

Recipe Group Selection for June 7, 2014 -  This is one of those recipes that you’re not quite sure if you liked it or not.  Never having had tried a shawarma, I wasn't sure what to expect. I’m glad I tried it, was good for a change,  but not my favorite.  I’m not a fan of mayonnaise so I used Greek yogurt instead which worked out fine.

I had garam marsala and was glad to find another recipe to use it!  Chicken is very fragrant while cooking.  I warmed up the pitas a little bit - my only problem was getting a rather healthy bite of garlic mayo where the garlic was too strong.   I think I didn't throughly mix it (I'll make sure to do so next time) or use a little less garlic.  My husband and I liked it

Recipe Group Selection:  07, June 2014 ~ Shawarmas and garam masala were two new items for our family to experience.  I used 'Easy Garam Masala' from AR in this recipe, and just cut the recipe back to one-fourth the amount due to me using 1 large chicken breast. I bought pita bread at our favorite Greek restaurant to use with this recipe.  We liked the taste and I liked the ease of the recipe, but felt it needed lettuce and tomatoes and maybe some onions added.  We really enjoyed the taste of the garam masala and I look forward to using it again.  This is a good wrap, and I plan on making it again, just will added the above mentioned veggies.  These were served with 'Good for You Greek Salad' and 'Buttery Pecan Green Beans' both from AR.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I had doubts about the chicken and mayo but it turned out great. I did make some more additons though : Instead of full mayo, I added some plain yogurt as well. I also made a tahini sauce with sesame seeds, olive oil and garlic. The pickles add a lot IMO. Along with this, I added lettuce, tomatoes and onion slices. Delicious!

These were pretty good but I made lots of changes.  I used thighs instead of breasts.  I used a basic curry seasoning I had on hand.  I used half mayo and half sour cream for the garlic spread.  I had fresh from the garden tomatoes, lettuce and onion so I sliced those up and used them instead of pickles.   My 3 and 5 year old boys liked it too.  I'll be making this again.

I made this for lunch with some leftover chicken gyro meat. I liked the garlic mayo with the chicken and the pita. I forgot the pickle at home, but this was still very good!!

While this is NOT authentic shawarma, it is quite good. I'd classify it more as kind of an Indian spice    flat bread chicken sandwich. Not much middle eastern about it. Lots for room for tweaking.

I used hummus instead of the mayo mixture, vegetarian "chicken" with curry powder, lettuce, and pickles. It was delicious. My husband liked it too. Thanks for the recipe idea!

Made exactly as stated. I have never had shawarma but we didn't like this at all. Tasted like a weird cinnamon garlic pickle combo.
