Loved it, and my family loved it! Didn't change a thing.  Next time I might add more shitake, and button mushrooms or other gourmet mushrooms and leave out the canned ones.  It doesn't seem like it's enough to feed six though. I served it with Pork Lo Mein and Egg Rolls for a nice Asian meal. Flavor was excellent!

I used 1.5 cups sliced white mushrooms and 1 cup portabello. It was wonderful!

This was excellent and any combo of mushrooms would work nicely. Next time I make it I might add some water chestnuts to the mix for some extra crunch.

My husband commented on how good this dish was. I only had shiitake mushrooms on hand and used chardonnay instead of dry sherry (because I had a bottle open). I also omitted the green onion because I didn't have any one hand either (I think they would be a tasty, though). I also substituted agave nectar for the honey. It add a nice, sweet flavor. I served it with brown rice and a teriyaki-marinated pork loin.
