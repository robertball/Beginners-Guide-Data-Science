Fantastic flavor! My pieces of salmon were pretty thick and 15 mins was a bit much, so next time I'd do 12-13mins. That said, I prefer the flavor of grilled salmon, so I might even do that instead of baking.  Some recommendations: 1) season the salmon first before cooking. The salmon itself was a little on the bland side. I'd suggest in the very least, salt, pepper and garlic powder. 2)Mix the mango, onion, serrano, cilantro and lime juice together in a bowl and let it sit while the salmon cooks, instead of sprinkling each individual ingredient on the fish.  I'll be making this one again with the tweaks I suggested. Yummy!

I absolutely loved this and I was amazed at how quick and easy it was to make. Quick enough to be served as a weeknight dinner but impressive enough to make for guests. Lots of flavor without the belt-tightening shame. I will definitely be making again! Thanks, Utonah Ruiz!
