this is super easy and tasty, though it seems to need a little more flavor. I'll add some thyme and maybe a bay leaf next time. My family that doesn't like too many things in one dish, liked it a lot.

If you are looking for a money saving on the grocery bill this is it and you can freeze it. We like the flavor and the parsely really makes it hopefully you will use fresh parsley and with crusty bread it is a great recipe. thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This is a great recipe to use up holiday leftovers.  I used the leftover holiday ham.  I omitted the onion (not many onion fans around here).  I used more veggies than the recipe called for so it was nice and hearty.  I used dried parsley flakes because I had no fresh and did not add the caraway seed.  But, what really made this soup for me, was the addition of the leftover ham broth!  I mixed 2 cups chicken broth, ham broth and enough water to make it all add up to 6 cups.  It was VERY good!  I have more ham broth left so I will be making this again and freezing it.  Very, very good.

I have made this recipe several times and my family loves it!  I even get special requests for it when it gets cold!  Modifications: I add shredded carrots, a pinch of red pepper & lemo pepper for a small spicy kick.  I also sub EVOO for the vegetable oil.  I don't use the caraway seed.  The first time I (unfortunately) used dried parsely.  definitely splurge for the fresh - they also offer it freeze-dried in glass jars (tastes just like fresh) in most produce sections now and it lasts a while longer.

Delicious...I used bacon instead of the ham and 3 medium sized potatoes. After the potatoes cooked in the broth I used a masher on them to thicken the soup. I used only 1 onion as I didn't want to overpower the soup with an onion flavor.

I was looking for another way to use leftover ham and this was perfect!    so much lighter than split pea soup!  next time, I will really load up the cabbage and maybe add carrots to make it heartier.  I left out the caraway seed, and let the ham make its own broth in water first( in the crockpot), then added a few chicken boullion cubes, then I just threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook - definitely making again!!!

We did enjoy this soup, but I made a few changes. I used a basic, onion, celery, carrot base in olive oil. I used 5 small red potatoes diced smallish and a fine shred on the cabbage, because my ham was the remains of a sliced spiral ham and I wanted the soup to be less chunky, I used my own chicken stock so I added some salt, a splash of red pepper, and some butter.. Left out the caraway but did use the fresh parsley as others advised. Very hearty but delicately flavored early Spring dinner with fruit salad on the side and a crusty loaf. Made a lovely meal.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I followed it to the T but it was too watery and no taste at all.

Found this recipe in a little cookbooklet called "Irish Favorites" at the grocery.  I think the flavor will have a lot to do with the ham you use.  I used part of a package of "slices and pieces" of spiral-sliced ham, and it turned out delicious, even better the next day.

Very tasty! My husband loved it. We went through a whole pot in two days. The only thing I did different was adding some seasoning like paprika, basil, and a little ground sage. Awesome fall comfort food.

A very nice soup to have a cold or chilly day.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I added a sliced carrot.  I like the color it added to the soup.  I did use the optional caraway seeds and that added a lot of flavor.  Served this with a slice of homemade bread and honey.  It made for a nice meal and the leftovers the next day had even more flavor that the night it was served.  Yes, I would make this one again.

Just OK. Added a can of chopped tomatoes and some extra veggies (celery and carrots, and extra garlic, red potatoes, and cabbage). Used leftover brown sugar braised ham. I added a bay leaf as suggested, and used fresh parsley. I did omit the caraway seeds as I'm not a fan. Flavor needed more oomph. Not sure what it needs to up the flavor but it needs something.

Turned out very good with some modifications.  I used 3 cups vegetable stock plus 3 cups chicken stock that I had in the freezer instead of the Swanson.  I used 1/2 large head cabbage and substituted 4 red potatoes (a little on the small side).  I also added 2 chopped carrots, 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar, 2 bay leaves and 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning.  I lightly sauteed the cabbage along with the onion before adding the stock.  Would probably also work with a little crushed tomato in it, but I didn't have any.

Very tasty soup.  The second time I made it, I substituted V8 juice for the chicken broth.  This gave it more flavor, in my opinion.

Nice hearty soup that is low in calories and fat.  I probably put in 4 cups of cabbage and I added a couple diced carrots and some leftover sliced mushrooms because I had them and didn't want them to spoil.  I like how the carrots and mush added another color dimension to the soup making it very eye-appealing.  Whatever you do, don't skip the parsley - it's key.

Loved the simpleness! We used ham broth instead and used the caraway, because of my German roots. It was great. After the first meal I chopped a few extra veggies in to use the produce left in the garden before the first frost, and the next day the meal was a bit different and just as good!

1/13/2013 This was very good.  My first time eating or cooking cabbage soup.  I used two potatoes and added sliced carrots. Used left over sprial sliced ham. I will make it again.    10/9/2016 I have made this soup many times now.  My recent changes to recipe include adding a can of stewed or diced tomatoes with juice, 1 stick celery thinly sliced celery and 1 carrot thinly sliced.   I love it!

This came out a lot better than I expected. I wanted to make something healthier and lighter after all the fatty holiday foods.  This fit the bill perfectly.  The only changes I made were to use homemade chicken broth rather than canned and to add some diced carrots because it looked like it could use a little color.  Very good, simple recipe.

Made this tonight and it was a big hit! I added flake red pepper, 1 celery stalk and 1 1/2 carrot cut up small not to over power the rest.
