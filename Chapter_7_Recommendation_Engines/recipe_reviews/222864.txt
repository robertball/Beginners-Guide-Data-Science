If it wasn't for the fact that I'm this recipe's first reviewer it would suffice to simply say, "Mmmmm," and add that Hubs remarked that this was "A five" - virtually unheard of.  So I'll expand and say that not only were these made in no time, they were soft and tender with that characteristic sandy texture so familiar in cookies where cream of tartar is one of the ingredients. I HATE rolling out sugar cookies and these had the advantage of turning out perfectly round, perfect for decorating.  I glazed them with "Shiny Cookie Icing," also from this site, before decorating them for Halloween. I'm very pleased.

My boyfriend is a sugar cookie snob and these are his absolute favourite! =) I made tiny ones to have with tea and they're absolutely wonderful alone! Add some sweet orange marmalade to a nice, warm, fresh-out-of-the-oven cookie and they're divine! Cheers!

I was looking for a cookie recipe that only used egg yolks after making meringue cookies. The texture was quite nice. I found it a bit oily and a bit too sweet. I would suggest cutting the oil back a bit, and not to bother with rolling in sugar. Also, with my convection oven (which I'm still learning how to use), 2 batches at 300 (automatically switched down to 275 on convection setting), it took about 22 minutes for them to puff up nicely, still before browning.  I'm thinking my go-to recipe for sugar cookies is still "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" on this site.

This is my favorite sugar cookie recipe from this site.  I don't usually make any recipe that only has a few reviews but I'm glad I did! I was looking for the perfect soft cookie recipe and I found it.  The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very tasty but the texture was a little off.  There were a lot of holes in them so the second time I made them I mixed the vanilla extract in with the wet ingredients and then sifted all of  the dry ingredients together well in a separate bowl and then  blended it all together with an electric mixer.  They turned out perfect! Sugary sweet and soft.  Make sure you take them out of the oven before they brown so you get a soft cookie!  This is my go to sugar cookie recipe now.

These turned out great! Chewy and sweet enough they don't need icing if you don't want to. I added more vanilla than the recipe called for and will definitely make again.

This was a great cookie! I had some dehydrated cranberries sitting around, and by adding some to the batter, the tartness of the cranberries helped douse the sweetness of the cookie. I will definitely be using these for my party tomorrow!

Very delicious! I have made them for 2 events and they turned out great each time. If I were to change one thing though, it would be to take them out of the oven just 1 or 2 minutes earlier, but they are great either way!
