I made these cookies this past weekend and my family ate them straight from the oven.  I plan on making more and hiding the rest until closer to Christmas.  They are so easy to make!!!

Yummy and Easy. The only thing I didn't use was the frosting decoration.  Instead I sprinkled them with colored sugar at the end.

In my double oven, for both ovens, I had to lower the temp to 350 degrees, and take the cookies out at 9 minutes.  The first batch burned on the bottom, but still tasted good.  Otherwise, fantastic taste and beautiful, uniform little puffs!

Made these to send to my BF and also took the leftovers to a friends. Everyone always loves these. And the best part, everyone thinks they are from scratch!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were really good.  I baked mine longer than the recipe said.  They came out great and were easy to make!

Very good, I didn't have any flour and needed to use the cookie mix (it was about to expire) and they still turned out very good. I did need to turn down the oven temp a little.
