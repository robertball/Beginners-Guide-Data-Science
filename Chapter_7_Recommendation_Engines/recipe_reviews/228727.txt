It was a very good base recipe. I omitted the mushrooms and cut the parsley to 1/4 cup added two cups of fresh tomatoes and put all the herbs into the blender with a can of diced tomatoes and pured it. Instead of olive oil I browned some hamburger and added onions and garlic, sauteing them in the grease while the ground beef cooked. Didnt have bell peppers and added salt to taste after all the ingredients were added together. Just waiting now to see if it cooks down (thickens) but the flavor is spot on! Awesome recipe for just a bunch on ingredients from my fridge, pantry and cabinet!

I made this with wonderful results!  The spices are almost spot on!  The flat leaf parsley is AKA "Italian Parsley".   (Little cooking trivia!).  I cut this down, just a bit (ran out in garden) but still tasted great.  I did, however, not include the mushrooms, again because I was out, & grocery store is 14 mi. away.  However, I can only imagine they would have only made the dish better.  I used fresh tomatoes, rather than canned because Istill have tons.  Just for the record though, for those who added meat, or sausage, a Marinara sauce, by definition, is a meatless red sauce.  When you add meat, you are making spaghetti.  HTH!!!  Blessings!!!

Just finished making this recipe and it is easy to make with great taste. Today I didn't have any mushrooms but I did have everything else in my cabinet. Added a dash of sherry to the onion mixture, at the end, to replace the mushrooms. It worked great. Emulsified the sauce then added a tablespoon of butter. That gave it a bit of a creamy feel. Love this recipe and will make it again and again!

I made this exactly as written. Yep, even with 8oz of mushrooms, 2Tablespoons oregano and a cup of flat leaf parsley. So yummy!! A perfect blend of spicy with a full body of flavors I feel you can only get with using all the mushrooms. I did 3 dashes of black pepper, but next time will only do 1 per my tastes. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!! Great recipe!

3.18.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228727/worlds-best-marinara/ ... Unusual for me, but pretty much followed this & used with "ziti & eggplant".  'Didn't use mushrooms, red bell pepper, rosemary or sage.  'Think that 2T oregano is supposed to be 2t - so I did 2t.  Only added 1T sugar & it was enough.  I cooked the eggplant in the sauce then blended it.  Nice thick sauce, but not too thick or too tomatoey.  Two days later, K, 13, wants it again.  Yay!  Next time since adding the eggplant to "dilute" the sauce, I'll use puree or crushed & more, up to double, the spices.  I'll blend in halves, too.  It all fit in the blender, but blending made it orange-y.  Maybe blending in halves it won't be so orange.  :?  :) Time2: less orange, but orange. :)  'Used crushed. Shoulda been sauce.  I added water & wine, but it still tasted too tomato-y/concentrated with crushed. Next time, sauce with double spices.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I used 4oz of fresh mushrooms instead of 8, and added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil at the end and it was delicious. Definitely will be my go to marinara sauce!

I processed tomatoes and made tomato sauce at the end of season and when my jars ran out, I tried this sauce for freezing the last quart. I didn't add the mushrooms or red pepper as I will add when I make my pasta.  I would probably go a little less on the oregano in future...but this was an excellent sauce nonetheless.

Fist time making sauce from scratch and I must say it was very easy. I did make a spaghetti with meat and zucchini and my family loved it. I skipped the sage and added more garlic because who doesn’t like more garlic. I added some fresh basil from my garden when I blended it for some extra flavor.i will never buy from a jar again ??

Absolutely Delicious! Thick and Spicy, Perfect Blends of Spices! All I did differently was not add the Mushrooms. Will be making again soon...

Two Tabelspoons of Oregano?  That was too much for me.  I decreased the oregano after the first batch...friends agreed that 2 tabelspoons was too much.  I rated this recipe based on the recipe as published.  The spices may be a personal taste choice.  The base is great.

Outstanding. I quadrupled the recipe so I could use it as a base for several dishes for the week. I left out a couple of the herbs I’m not a fan of and used an immersion blender for the whole pot. Outstanding Flavors! Makes a great base for a meat sauce, for spaghetti and meatballs and for lasagna. This house is my go to from here on out.

This really is pretty delicious. It’s also filled with vitamins and nutrients, which is a great aspect. The bell pepper gives it a slightly sweet edge to it. I served it with vegetarian meatballs and fettuccine. Everyone loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

We loved this sauce! The only change I made was to omit the mushrooms because my family doesn't like them. The flavor was perfect with just the right amount of spice.
We served it over stuffed shells this time, and will be adding this to our regular recipe rotation.

12.9.17  I really liked the chunky texture of the sauce after it was cooked, so I didn’t even put it in the blender.  In particular, we liked the chopped mushrooms in the sauce.  In the future, I might try splitting the tomato sauce with a can of petite cut tomatoes for just a little variation.  Very nice and easy marinara sauce.  Served with Meatball Nirvana from this site.

I like this marinara. It was easy to make and my family  loved the marinara on stuffed shells. The only changes I made was I omitted the rosemary and I used 1 tsp. dried oregano.  My family doesn't like rosemary.

Delicious and easy! Made as written but had to sub in a yellow onion and dried parsley because that was what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again.

The taste is perfect but blending it at the end made it kind of chunky and I felt like it wasn't liquid enough... I will probably add water to he remaining sauce and blend again to see if I can get it smoother but if not then I will opt to not blend at the end next time. Thanks for the recipe!
