9.28.19 First, I must say I had my doubts about the caramel syrup, but moved forward with it.  The syrup basically balances out the tartness of the vinegar, and I could detect no caramel flavor at all (and that's a good thing IMO).   The apples provided some sweet crunch and the pears additional sweetness.  With the sesame oil and rice vinegar in the dressing, I would describe this salad as having an Asian flair.  We donâ€™t like our salads soaked in dressing, so I did have some left, and it went into the fridge for probably another luncheon salad tomorrow.  Super simple to make, and we enjoyed it.
