Excellent!! yum yum!!! I'm actually craving this right now. 
I did add a little black pepper, and it turned out great. I think it would be also great with some cheese cubes and/or tuna in it, I'll try that next time.

Awesome Salad. I used red onions and deleted celery seed and used tarragon in its place! Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers. I have many requests for this salad at family gatherings!

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and it turned out great!  Several of my guests had seconds even though there was a multitude of food to choose from.  I made the salad the night before and added a few bacon bits.  I also added a tiny bit of garlic powder and a little bit of dried cilantro to the dressing.  I really enjoyed it and I'll be eating the leftovers tonight and this weekend.

This was really, really good. I was actually looking for a pasta salad recipe, but this one sounded so good that I decided to try it and just add some pasta. It turned out great. A wonderful summer pasta salad.

This was quick to put together and was gone from the dinner table in minutes. I used celery salt instead of celery seed since that's what I had on hand. I also used scallions and diced up the cucumber without the seeds instead. It's such a refreshing salad I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe Ginger!

This was really good.  I chilled it for about an hour or so so the flavors would blend.  Youngest child ate a second plate, and ate more of the leftovers (the little that was left) the next day. Oldest kid was being picky and ate only the cucumbers out of it.  Husband as usual liked it.

I dont like corn so I thought I would give it a try with something new.  I didn't have celery seed so I had to leave that out.  I added extra salt and pepper also.  I thought it was very runny.  Maybe try scraping as much of the seeds out of the cucumber as possible.  I dont think I will make this again.  But it did have a wonderful smell- like summer in a bowl!

Something is missing in this salad.  I sampled some an hour after I made it and thought it had a strange flavor.  I think I'll add some crumbled bacon and maybe some shredded cheese and maybe some tabasco sauce before I serve it to the rest of the family.

I wasn't expecting anything particularly special with this recipe, I just needed to use up some leftover corn but I really liked this. It's a nice twist on the 'ol cuke/sour cream dish we all know how to make. Very refreshing salad:o)

Good!  A little onion-heavy, but the sweetness of the corn was perfect to compensate.  You can also use bagged frozen corn, just soak in ice water a few minutes after cooking, and it's still ready quickly!

Absolutely awesome corn salad, although I had to improvise and use what I had on hand.  I've been looking for a good recipe since I first ate corn salad at Luther's BBQ in Houston.  I omitted sour cream and used all mayo;  accidentally doubled the vinegar, so balanced it with 1/2 pkt of Equal;  added a sprinkle of dill and chives due to no dry mustard;  used 1 can corn and one whole cucumber w/2 Roma tomatoes.  Thanks a bunch for the initial recipe.  Can't wait to try it with the sour cream and see what that tastes like!

Wow, we loved this! We didn't have celery seed, but added a little more salt and some pepper. We honestly couldn't stop eating it. But then again, we LOVE corn. :)

This recipe was super delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and cubed the cucumber to add to the salad.  I also used fresh grape tomatoes from my garden.  I will definitely make this again.

This salad was a pleasant surprise. I did not have celery seeds, so used tarragon as someone else had suggested. My kids and I kind of looked at it at first wondering if it would taste good, but once we tasted it, we were hooked! The kids all went back for seconds!

What a nice change for a salad.  It is so easy to make!!  It is very refreshing in the hot weather.  I peeled the cucumbers (used 2) and diced them.  Next time I will leave part of the peel.  Years ago,  a girlfriend taught me to strip the peel for more fiber and color.  I used Grape tomatoes and left them whole, although I almost cut them in half. I did not measure the sour cream and mayo but used the same proportion.  I used celery salt and pepper .... lots of both.  I LOVE THE CRUNCHY AND MY HUSBAND LIKES ANYTHING CREAMY.  He said he could eat this for dessert!!  I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Think of all of the other possibilities .... such as colorful bell peppers, blanched broccoli, etc.  Thank you sooooo much!!

I have been looking for a really good corn salad and I have found it at last.  My 4 yo son enjoyed it for lunch with some bbq chicken.  This will be a regular on our table from now on.

Absolutely fantastic! I changed only a couple things while preparing the salad and got rave reviews from my in-laws. I used a seedless cucumber and seeded the tomatoes before coarsely chopping them. Used a red onion for zip but chopped it very fine and added an orange bell pepper. For those of you worried about the salad being runny, place the veggies in a colander so any excess juice can drain off before you add the liquid ingredients. I doubled the mustard, added some garlic powder and some course ground pepper. Omitted the celery seed entirely. I chose this salad looking for a "summer" veggie side dish but I think this one will be used year-round at our house!

Nice fresh taste.  I used regular mustard and onion salt.  Do not sacrifice the onions; they add that crucial zip!

I used fresh corn(3-4 ears) and cubed the seedless cucumber I had. It was so good!  The celery seed is wonderful in it- I always have it on hand for soups.  
Roma tomatoes worked fine also.
