My daughter has problems with gluten and I have been hesitant to try Gluten free baking.  (She is an adult).  Even though there were no reviews on this recipe I thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't change a thing.  Only baked it longer to get it golden brown on top.   I will definitely make it again.  Served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  Used Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour.  Excellent!!!

I used almond milk instead of whole milk, and subbed half the flour with rice flour... Came out amazing! Will definitely be making again. Update: made again, with only all purpose flour, in a bundt pan. Thanks for the recipe!

Donâ€™t know what I did wrong, but so dense and heavy.

This was surprisingly easy to make and everyone really likes it. Quite tasty and likely to be made again. Has been enjoyed with ice cream and strawberries. Just as good by itself.

It was a little dry.
