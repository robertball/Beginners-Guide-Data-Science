After preparing the marinade, I thought it tasted pretty sweet, but I have to say that it did a fantastic job of marinating a London Broil.  It was just sweet enough, and the soy sauce didnâ€™t overpower the flavor as many teriyaki sauces do.  Shane, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it!

We were looking for a good teriyaki sauce recipe for our grilled pork steaks. We came across this one and made it with a few tweaks. We did not have sake on hand so we didn't use that, We added one teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and I used a heaping tablespoon of ground ginger (because I love Ginger!). Also, instead of honey I use brown sugar and it was spectacular! We marinated the steaks and grilled them and then simmered the sauce down on the stove after bringing it to a boil and poured that over the steaks when they were done.
