Excellent starter recipe. I changed it a little  I used 3lb pork loin, liptons dry mushroom onion soup and half the bottle of Chardonnay.  Drank the other half while slow cooking on high.  Ready in 4 hrs.  Yummy ?? over rice or potatoes

This was really good!  I've made a couple of times now and my husband and I really like it.  It's just the two of us so I just used one package of pork tips (2+ lbs). I used one package of dry onion soup mix, 4 oz of Chardonnay and one full can of cream of mushroom soup.  I cut the meat into pieces that wouldn't require a knife later, mixed all the ingredients with the meat and everything into a slow cooker and left for work. 10 hours later it was done and worked great with mashed or scalloped potatoes.  It was a little salty but we liked it that way. Definitely making again!

I gave it 4 stars because, although good, it just quite didn't have the depth of flavor with so few ingredients. A great starter recipe. Also, I am not sure what MichelePM was looking at. I could not find any reference to yogurt. Lastly, to the person who said it wasn't quite tender enough, this is because you only cooked it 4 hours instead of the 8 the recipe called for. The longer you slow cook this the more tender it will become. GL, Chef Cosmo

I really like this? I used a whole pork tenderloin (will try chips next time) and added a package of mushrooms. It was very tasty!

This is delicious.  The only change that I made was I used chicken broth instead of wine as I did not have any white wine.  I also used pork tenderloin instead of tips.

This was very good, I served it over buttered noodles. I did add an extra can of mushroom soup and a little extra wine to  compensate for adding extra meat. Didn't really change anything, It was eaten up, with no leftovers (I feed 6). I prepared it the night before in crockpot, put it on at 6am, on med. served at 6 that night. Again very very good.

This was a good recipe.  Easy to make, moist and filling.  Goes well with the brown rice.  Needed some freshly cracked black pepper  and maybe some chili flakes.  I'll definitely make this again.

I think the previous review before me was another recipe because this didn't call for yogurt. I used this simple but wonderful recipe and it turned out great! I added chopped potatoes and made a gravy with the juices, yummy! I only cooked 5 hours on low and I was done and plenty tender.

I didn't have the yogurt, but made the recipe faithfully.  It cooked faster than I expected, and wasn't as tender as I was hoping.  The flavor was good, but not fabulous.  Like some of the other reviewers, I would love to see the gravy be thicker and the flavor just a bit more intense.  The house smelled wonderful, though!
