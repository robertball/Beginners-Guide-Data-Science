This was really quick to make and tasted GREAT! I couldn't rate it 5 stars because I had to substitute 1 of the 3 ingredients! I didn't have the knorr's dried veggie packet. I only had dried french onion dip and dried ranch dressing mix so I decided to try it with the french onion. My daughter doesn't like her salsa "chunky" so I put it in the food processor to make it smooth. We liked it made with cold salsa and not room temperature. Tasted like a dip a store named Lawson's carries! Next time I will try it with the dried ranch dressing mix or actually what the recipe calls for to give an fair review.

Don't use the vegetable soup mix! It's better with just the salsa and sour cream then mix in some grated cheese and use as a dip for your favorite taco chips! Yummy!:)

OK I just made this and rated it a four because its so easy and really does have a good flavor! The only problem was that it was a little too salty for me. next time I will add only half of the soup mix to start with or skim mostly the vegetables off of the top of the soup packet. Would also be good with celery or carrot sticks. Ok time-warp to alot later. It has been a while since I wrote this review. I would just like to suggest to anyone looking for SOMETHING to mix with that sour cream that taco seasoning is the bomb. My son and I discovered that some sour cream mixed with a some of a taco seasoning packet (to taste) is our new must have for bean and cheese tostadas or nachos. I love it with tortilla chips. Or on a spoon...

I read the other reviews so decided to leave out the soup mix. Just sour cream and salsa (more salsa than it calls for)...turned out great!

I agree with the other reviewer. This was easy (and what I had in the fridge for a last minute dip) but it was rather salty. To salvage and balance out the flavors I added mayo and some dill. As described in the recipe it would've been too much on its own.

I used the idea of this recipe. Instead of using the soup mix add some seracha chile sauce. It is very good that way...especially if you like it spicy.

the mixture does nothing to compliment each other. We ate one bite and had to throw it out.

My family didn't like this. The dried veggie soup mix over powered the sour cream & salsa.
