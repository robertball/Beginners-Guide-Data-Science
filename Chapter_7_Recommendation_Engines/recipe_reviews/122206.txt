Followed the recipe exactly as stated, but without the salt and celery seed for no other reason than I forgot. :) The whole family loved it and I'll definitely make this again.  And FYI -I did not end up with soggy bottomed biscuits like some others have. Update: made this again, in a hurry, the biscuits were perfectly golden brown so I took it out of the oven about 5 minutes early - guess what - soggy bottomed biscuits.  Lesson here is to bake them the full amount, maybe a few minutes more, no matter how golden brown the biscuits look.

Great recipe with changes:  I sautéed the onions (1/2 onion) in butter to soften, I omitted the eggs since they just didn’t seem necessary.  I also omitted the salt since the soup has plenty.  I cut the celery seed in half because it just seemed to be too much.   I then combined all the ingredients except cheese and biscuits and poured mixture into the casserole dish and baked for 20 minutes.   I then placed the biscuits on top of the mixture and sprinkled the cheese on top and baked until the biscuits were done.  It turned out to be a five star recipe and we enjoyed it.   From now on I’m going to alternate various vegetables for variety.

Great recipe!  Delicious and beautiful. My husband loved it and made me promise to put it on the rotation of meals.  Will make for a friend who just had a baby.  We're not big on celery so next time I'll only use a 1/2 tsp. of celery seed.  Thank you for sharing - comforting, classic, and makes you look like a seasoned cook.

My biscuits didn't cook all the way through and I was left with a slimy layer of dough between the biscuits and cheese.  1 medium onion was way too much for this simple recipe.  It overpowered the flavor of the chicken.  

If I made this again, I'd double the broccoli, use half as much onion and use less biscuits so that the pan is less crowded and they will bake all the way through.

Sort of used this as a guideline to make my own thing. I ended up using 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, and a bit of milk. I did not do the sauce over the top nor did I add the worshtishire sauce, neither of these sounded very appealing. With the changes I made, it was excellent and didn't have a scrap leftover. Ü

This recipe is great!! I didn't use the final topping on the biscuits and it still came out delicious. I bought a rotisserie chicken and cut that up.. omg I strongly recommend using that in this recipe!

My family enjoyed this dish. Next time I will add to it. Needed a crunch to it, so either slivered almonds, or water chestnuts, perhaps. I'd add mushrooms as well. I will make this dish again with the additions.

This was only OK. The topping that was poured over the biscuits was a little different. If I attempt to make this a second time, I would reduce the amount of celery seed. Also, this didn't reheat very well. The egg mixture that was poured over the biscuits curdled when reheated - almost like scrambled eggs in the areas that it was heavier. Convienent though with the ready made biscuits and the chicken layer was good. Second thought, I don't think I'll make this one again - sorry.

This was not only a delicious dish, but also a beautifully presented one as well.  I added mushrooms to the bake, simply becuase I got this recipe confused with another one and thought this recipe called for mushrooms.  They were a welcome addition, nonetheless.  Recommendations:  Use a deep 13x9 pan - possibly a lasagna pan - because I had spill over in the oven.  Also I had to adjust the baking time to alow for my buscuits to cook all the way through.  I would suggest that after you add the buscuits to the pan to cover very loosely with aluminum foil and bak for 20 minutes, and then bake uncovered for 10-20 minutes longer.

This was really good! I was a little skeptical of the mayo and worcestershire sauce, and even the egg/ sour cream mix on top.  I read a few reviews and decided to go for it! I did season the chicken when I cooked it and sautéed the onion along with it. I did not use celery seed in the egg / sour cream mix, I added sea salt and black pepper over the top. I baked the full 20 minutes and left it in even a few more, and the biscuits were done. It was great, my hubby loved it, and it really did make a nice presentation!

I liked this.  I thought it was really good.  My husband on the other hand, said it was "good, but not great".  I thought it was creamy and comforting.  I used rotisserie chicken like other reviewers and the 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese because I didn't have regular shredded cheese.

I have to give this 5 stars because I can't think of a single thing to "improve" it.  I did make some changes based on what I had in the house.  I used "healthy request" cream of chicken soup, light mayo and light sour cream, and I thought it tasted fine.  Also, I didn't have broccoli or cheddar so I used peas and shredded 4-cheese Mexican blend.  I also used only one 16-oz package of biscuits, so I just stretched each one out and laid it flat on top, instead of the arches pictured.

I enjoyed this.  I made it exactly like it states the first time.  It was good, I thought the mixture that was poured over the biscuits was different, but not bad.  I changed a few things.  I used two cans of cream of chicken soup.  Mixed the soup, mayo, worcestershire sauce, chicken, broccoli and half a pkg of cheddar cheese. Then sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top of the mixture when it was in the pan.  Baked as usualy, topped with biscuits and baked again.  No other ingredients.  urned out great, and I make it often for the family!

Huge hit with my family! Both of my picky kids loved it and asked me to make it again the next day. That definitely says something! I put in some cauliflower in along with the broccoli. Next time I'll probably put in some carrots too. Very good flavor!

So good! I made changes and it turned out great. Even the kids loved it! I steamed brocoli before adding it, I did not add the eggs and a only half the celery seed.  I then mixed all ingredients together and added biscuits on top then cheese on biscuits. So it was like cheese biscuits on the casserole. It was so good.

Mine didn't taste all that great - but I marinated the chicken before cooking it, and I think the strong flavor drowned everything else.

This recipe is wonderful. I used to make a brocolli chicken casserole that we loved that was just cheese, mayo, chicken and cream of mushroom soup. It PALES in comparison to this dish. It is so so good! We'll make it again and again.

This was good; however, next time I'll cut down the amount of celery seed, and saute the onion first. Otherwise, it was a nice combo of ingredients.

very good - husband loved it!  a little salty.  cut the amt of celery seed to 1 tsp and will probably cut to 1/2 tsp when making in the future.  will make again.
