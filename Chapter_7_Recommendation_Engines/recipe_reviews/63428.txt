A quick fix for German rouladen. Its good, but nothing compares to scratch. Try it with bacon and mustard inside. YUM!

Very tasty recipe.....next time I will likely cook longer at a lower temperature to make the beef more tender. I also added worcheshire sauce to it. Served it with roasted veggies. Mmmmmmm!
