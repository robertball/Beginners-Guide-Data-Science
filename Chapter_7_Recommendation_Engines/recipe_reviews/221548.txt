Excellent! I did this with homemade Kimchi and it was spicy and delicious. I recommend using a whole teaspoon of sesame oil.

A nice change on just plain Kimchi.  Those who already like Kimchi will love it.  Those who just tolerate Kimchi will like it.  Some family members never will, so gave it 4 stars.  I served with Bulgogi.
