Easy and delicious - perfect for lunch! I used half light Miracle whip and half Hellman's light mayo. I also used green onion and cut back on that a bit. I made these into wrap sandwiches and added some smoked bacon strips crisp lettuce and fresh tomato slice along with the Swiss cheese - YUM!

Instead of the ciabatta rolls I put a few tablespoons into flatbread and made a wrap. Spicy good flavor.

I used Hellman's mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip (personal choice) and I added a teaspoon of cumin and about a quarter cup chopped pickled jalapeno. This was really yummy! I didn't have ciabatta rolls so I just ate mine on whole wheat bread. NOTE: This made enough for one sandwich today and two more for tomorrow.

Love the cilantro - nice touch. Not your typical chicken salad in a good way!

Really good. I subbed paprika for the cayenne and added a few dashes of cumin. It's the lime and mustard combo that's so good though.Used Hellmans mayo.
