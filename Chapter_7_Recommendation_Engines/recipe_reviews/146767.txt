What flavor!  Having said that, I will say that both my fiancé and I felt that the habanero pepper overpowered the wonderful flavor of the salsa.  I LOVE spicy food, but even this was a bit much.  It was edible, but not as enjoyable as it could have been.  Maybe I added too much pepper.  Who knows?  Next time though, I will use jalapeno peppers or some red pepper flakes just to be on the safe side.  The combined flavors of the salsa were absolutely incredible.  I served it atop a bed of rice and with Jay’s Jerk Chicken as the main dish.  Definitely try this recipe, but pepper it to your liking.

This was fantastic and like other comments made about this recipe "I tried it becuase it intrigued me". To be honest I married two recipes together so mine was a combination and it was killer!!! I didn't add the ginger, and subsititued 1/2 Walla Walla sweet onion instead of green onion. I added 1/4 cup finely minced mint, added 1/2 cup minced cucumber, and I used 2 bananas finely chopped, and the juice from 2 very large limes. 
I served it with pita (or you could use other flat bread) that I had brushed lightly with oil and Mediterranean spices and grilled that had been cut into wedges. The next time I will also grill some pita with sugar and cinnamon and serve it as a dessert salsa! WOW!

When I saw this recipe, I was totally intrigued and had to try it. I'm glad I did, because it is really good! The only thing I would do differently is next time, I'll put half in the food processor and then mix it with the rest. I prefer a part chunky, part liquidy salsa. Thanks Michelle!

Wow, everybody loved this.  I did get wimpy and substituted a jalapeno pepper for the habanero and it was just the right amount of hot for me, although I am sure it is excellent with the habanero.  I made it ahead and added bananas just before serving.  Everyone loved the fresh taste and interesting combination of flavors! Thanks!

HUGE HIT!!!  I served this over coconut rice at a tropical themed bridal shower and had multiple requests for the recipe.  I also had grilled jerk shrimp on the buffett and it paired very well.  I will make this recipe again and again!

Loved it!  very different and you can make it as hot as you want (we like it hot!).  Only downfall is you can't make it in advance or have leftovers because of the banana.  I guess you could make everything else, and just add bananas to the portion you are going to serve about 15 minutes before, so that you can keep the rest in the fridge.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this as a topping for some Jamaican Jerk pork skewers that we grilled. It was quite interesting! Two changes only: I used a jalapeno instead, and I used roasted red peppers (in a jar) because I forgot the red bell pepper at the store.  People seemed to enjoy it. A fine dice is very important for this salsa. I also recommend adding the bananas and cilantro just before serving, as things tend to get a bit soupy from the acidic lime juice. Thanks for something new and fresh and different.

REALLY loved this! I used poblano instead of green pepper and left out the habanero. I also used shallot and fresh chive flowers in place of the green onion. The purple was very pretty in it. Served this with Oprahs coconut risotto ( made with coconut rum instead of wine) and grilled jerk shrimp. A gourmet night in Jamaica!

WOW!!!   This was soooo good!  We used a jalapeno instead of the habanero.  We served it with Jay's Jerk Chicken skewered and grilled and a bed of basmati rice.    This is one of the most unique and delicious recipes we have tried from Allrecipes.  Will definitely make this again!

I didn't make this recipe, but I assigned it to a guest at our dinner party and she made it.  The salsa was delicious!  She used jalapenos instead of habanero because she was nervous the habanero would be too spicy and it turned out to have no kick at all, so we all agreed next time it should have habanero peppers instead.  But even without the kick, it was flavorful and refreshing!  I'll make it myself soon!

Followed others advise and only added bananas prior to serving. Other than that followed recipe exactly. There was not one drop left over !! Was served as a regular salsa with lime chips.

Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! We made this recipe for a Jamaican themed party and everyone loved it! We spooned the salsa over jerk chicken and grilled turkey burgers! Since a habanero pepper seemed a little to hot we subbed a jalepeno. This salsa will definitely be on our menu this spring/summer!

Yum!  My husband was downright scared of this experiment, even though he loves apple salsa and watermelon salsa.  But when he tasted it, he loved it.  TIP:  Make the salsa without the banana ahead of time to allow the flavors to mingle.  If you make it very much ahead of time, you might even wait on the cilantro.  Then add the banana/cilantro sometime during the last hour - might be able to stand another banana at that - at least another half, and our banana was not small. OTHER CHANGES NEXT TIME?  The fresh ginger I used had been peeled for a little while, so maybe that's the reason, but we could barely taste the ginger, even after allowing it to sit for a bit.  So we'll put in the called for amount, allow to sit a bit, and then season to taste as needed.  Happened to throw in a banana pepper, and that was a hit, but would add several.  Had no habanero, & only added a touch of jalapeno.  Spice doesn't come through this terribly fast.......   (used one slice of pickled jalapeno with a good bit of juice, no heat, my husband liked it anyway though he likes heat).  Only put in 2 T of cilantro, and that not ahead of time.  That was just right for those of us who think that cilantro tastes like soap (which is a genetic thing, I hear tell).  A bit of rice, a bit of fish, and a lot of Caribbean Cole Slaw (from this site) and all these veggies in this salsa made a plate of full of yum without guilt. Anyway, thanks for another fun recipe!  Will make again for sure.

I also used a jalapeno instead and would up the sugar just a teeny bit more next time. The banana is such an unexpected treat in this spicy salsa! Love it.

Great flavors.  Would be perfect over any type of grilled white fish.  We served it over coconut rice for an island themed meal -- everyone raved.  Use the habanero, it gives the perfect kick to the sweetness. Make sure your banana is not too ripe.  I chilled everything for an hour in the fridge and then added the banana right before we ate (this seemed to help it "keep" a little longer).

This was a little funky at first but once the bananas blended in it tasted good.  It was gone by the end of the night, I served it with lime chips I tried to find cinnamon chips but couldn't.  It would be good over fish.  I blended half of it to make it more salsa like.  IT was really good before I added the banana too.  I tried it over coconut couscous with shrimp yum!!!

I served this with homemade cilantro-lime flax crackers, and it was a nice change. I pulsed it in the food processor to a chunky consistency. The market was out of habaneros, so I used a jalapeno and some roasted green chile, but it wasn't hot enough for me. You'll definitely need the habanero if you want this salsa hot. I thought the banana blended right in; it was the ginger that stood out.

Fresh, healthy and lots of flavor - plus easy to make! I used just 1/2 tsp of the habenero pepper - just right for us!
