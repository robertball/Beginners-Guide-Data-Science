we really liked this at new years. We used a cheaper Aldi's pomegranate juice blend and champagne, and used 7 up for the kids. all liked it and it really was as good with 7 up as champagne. Thanks for sharing.

Love love these!! So much better than the traditional ones. I can have more of these because they don't give you that acidy feeling after two! You can also add a bit of cranberry juice the pomegranate...yummy!

This was my drink of choice on New Years Eve.  I did use cran/pomegranate juice and a puree of raspberries/pomegranate seeds in the bottom of the glass-beautiful color & tastes delish!

I served this drink to our guest as they arrived on Christmas Eve this year and quickly ran out! Had I known it was going to be such a hit I would have bought more champagne!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I used a sparkling pomengranate juice. Simply delicious and highly recommended!
