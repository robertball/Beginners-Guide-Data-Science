This recipe was great!!! I only give it 4/5 stars b/c of the necessary modifications.

Based on the other reviews, I only used 12oz of bowtie pasta and doubled the sauce ingredients (but only used 5-6 Tbsp of butter; I also did not double the parsley).  I used just 2 chicken breasts, and also doubled the sun dried tomato portion.  We didn't have any Romano cheese at home so I omitted it and it still turned out great! I am not sure why another reviewer said this dish lacked flavor, b/c it is full of flavor! We also like our food with a little kick, so I added about 1-2 tsp crushed red pepper (to taste).  My husband raved about it and is already anxious to eat leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I tried this recipe and absolutely loved it.  I added white wine, used olive oil instead of butter (and used less than the listed amount of fat), and added extra sundried tomatoes that I made myself.  I have been looking for a way to use up all these dried tomatoes, and this is wonderful!  I also used penne pasta, but only half the called for amount, and had just the right amount of sauce.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I was originally extremely excited to make this after reading the previous reviews and looking at the ingredients.  But, I must say it was only mediocre, I was not impressed at all.  The only differences between the original recipe and the way I cooked it is that I added teaspoon of italian seasoning and some artichoke hearts, both suggested in previous reviews.  I will not be making this again.

I was leary of the cream of chicken soup in this recipe- but it was really delicious.  I only had canned tomato's and used them.  It was very good.  You could really make alot of variations.  We will definitely make again.

This was VERY GOOD!! I'm sad there weren't enough leftovers for both my husband and myself to take for lunch today! I read through many of the reviews and made several changes, one of which was halving the pasta (I used tri-color rotini), which made the amount of sauce just perfect! I used the "light" cream of mushroom soup, sauteed green onions and garlic in olive oil first (instead of butter), and added a splash of dry white wine. I also used Italian seasoning instead of parsley and added some crushed red pepper. I rehydrated my sundried tomatoes by tossing them in with the pasta! Worked great. I used fresh grated Parm as well. So tasty - I want to make it again soon! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good! I changed a couple of things - tried to make it a little lower in fat.  I doubled the sauce. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken. I used half of the butter.  Also I used Basil & Oregano stewed tomatoes instead of sundried tomatoes (because that is what I had on hand!).  It turned out really well! Will make again! Thanks!

Great recipe!  The only change I made is adding a little white wine to the sauce as it was cooking.  Will make again!

I tried this recipe last night, but with a few alterations.  The grocery store nearest to my house did not have the farfalle (bowtie) pasta, so I used rigatoni, and they were also out of sundried tomatos.  Even without the sundried tomatos, it was SO GOOD.  And if you like more garlic, don't be afraid to add more.  I used at least 5 gloves of garlic and it probably could have used more!

As suggested, I doubled the sauce (but used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup when doubled) and added more sundried tomatoes.  I also added sauteed asparagus and it was delicious (gave it a good color, too.)  Also, I used parmesan cheese and it was very delicious.  I served my family with slices of lemon and red chili flakes (optional side) and EVERYONE LOVED IT.

Hey, Damon... you're wife's a lucky lady to have you cooking for her! This recipe was exceptional, and went really well over farfelle with the suggested side of steamed asparagus. If I didn't know it contained "cream Of" soup, I might not have figured it out, it was that good. 
We did end up doubling the sauce, adding a splash of Pinot Grigio and used the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil. Tasted like restaurant fare to me. Thanks for this new keeper!

May I just say "OH MY GOSH!!!"  This is absolutely delicious!  I've made it twice in three days.  The first time was for a dinner with friends so my family only got to taste it but because it was so good, they asked me to make it for them.  Everyone really enjoyed the dish.  I only had rotini noodles the second time but it still turned out yummy.  It was a bit salty so I added milk the first time and cut back on the salt the second time.  I added diced fresh tomatoes to the sauce and shredded parmesan cheese on top just before serving.  Thanks for the recipe Damon, your wife is a very lucky woman.  :}

My and husband and I loved this dish. It tastes like something you would get at a good Italian restaurant. Because other reviewers complained of it being bland, I seasoned the chicken before cooking it with Italian seasoning and garlic pepper. Other than that I didn't change anything. However, next time I will add a vegetable such as peas, broccoli, or spinach and maybe more sun dried tomatoes. And also add some crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit. I served it with a salad and texas toast.

This is a easy to prepare and delicious recipe. Obviously, it could be seen as a starting point to many variations. The only difference on my part was replacing the dried parsley for fresh. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my new favorites.  I did substitute a little olive oil for the butter to make it a bit healthier.  I like to cut the chicken up into bite size pieces instead of leaving them as whole breasts.  I also add red pepper flakes to taste.  This one reminds me of a dish you get at one of those over priced Italian restaurants.  YUMMY!!

This was excellent!  I took others advise and made a few changes - used 1/2 box of farfalle and full amount of sauce - it was just right; used italian seasoning instead of parsley, more pepper, and a little red pepper; only used 1/2 of butter; didn't have romano so I used about 1/2 cup of asiago cheese instead.  I will definately make this again!!!

Second time I made this recipe.  After I started cooking I realized I had no sundried tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Instead, I used 1/2 can of tomato sauce, added about 1/2 c white wine, and 1 small sliced onion.  Topped with Romano and Parmesaen. I thought it came out better than the first time

I love this!!!!  I'm so glad I made enough to take for lunch!.  I didn't add cheese.  Also, instead of crean chicken soup, I used cream chicken and mushroom.  I had a bag open of sherred  brocoli and lettuce and I added at the end, before the pasta.  I seasoned the chicken with the salt and pepper so I didn't added to the sauce.  About sundried tomates, I used the ones with olive oil.
This is a keeper!

I thought this was a good recipe....However,I did modify it a bit. I used olive oil, only 1/4 cup, cream of mushroom soup and added white wine (quite a bit) to thin the sauce. Also added frozen / thawed artichoke hearts and a bit more Romano cheese. Everyone at the table LOVED it !! Thank you Damon Morrison for being so kind to your wife :-)

Made this tonight.  Used fresh tomatoes, more garlic.  Thought it came out pretty good.  I would make it again. :)  I'd like to try using something other than cream of chicken soup, just because it has MSG in it.  So I'll try that next time.

I made this for my boyfriend and I last night. I doubled the sauce recipe (only using 3/4 cup butter) and used a pound of chicken. I used cream of chicken soup with herbs instead of the regular kind, added some red pepper flakes, and canned diced tomatoes with garlic and onions.  It was delicious and as my boyfriend took his first bite, he said "this is already my favorite thing you've made me."   I also paired it was some real italian garlic bread. Just mince some extra garlic while making dinner.  Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions.

Delicious! I'm not a sundried tomato person and the kids weren't interested in them either so next time I'll sub mushrooms for the tomatoes but it'll definitely be a reg at our house!

I also modified the recipe a little. Added white wine, asparagus and mushrooms. I substituted the soup for Classico Sundried tomato sauce, and adding the wine and the milk helped thin down the sauce. GREAT flavor! Everyone loves this and it is so quick and easy to make.

This recipe was fantastic! My husband loved it so much he said he could eat this everyday, haha. I did add more sundried tomatoes, and milk. I also used 1/2 the amount of pasta b/c it would have been to dry if I used all the recommended amout. When I make this again I will make double the amount of sauce while still using half the pasta. Thanks for sharing this one, Damon!

Absolutely fantastic and sooo easy. I also used parm instead of romano, and I made the sauce with skim milk and lowfat cream of chicken, 1/4 of the butter, and it was still rich and delicious. Because I love the flavor of sundried tomatoes, I scooped them in straight from the jar rather than rehydrating them. Thanks for submitting, Damon!

Wow! This is definitely a keeper! I marinated the chicken breasts in a garlic and onion marinate for an hour then baked them. I used half a package of farfalle pasta (either that, or double the sauce), added a package of fresh mushrooms, 1/2 ts of Italian spices and 1/4 ts crushed red pepper. I also used 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil - make sure you cut them up small. What a great, easy meal! My husband and mother just loved it! As good as Olive Garden.

Excellent dish!  Had it on the table in less than 30 minutes.  Since I'm a garlic lover, I doubled the garlic.  Next time I'm going to add fresh mushrooms when sautéing the garlic.  Thanks!

My whole family loved this recipe - even the kids. They called it " chicken spaghetti " and ate every last bite. I was a little leary of using the cream of chicken soup as a "base" but it was fantastic. I make it several time a month. The great thing is it can be an every day dish or served as a fancy italian dish with salad and garlic bread for company.

I enjoyed this one...I used less pasta and added some milk at the end to make it a little creamier. I think it's a great 'base' recipe that anyone can add anything to and make it their own!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

Followed some of the recommended modifications. Cooked the chicken in olive oil. Added more romano cheese. Great recipe. Add more salt and pepper for extra flavoring. Next time I will add some pepper flakes for some spice... maybe some hot sauce

12/3/09-This recipe was great!  I wasn't exactly sure how to measure the sun-dried tomatoes but I ended up using about 1.5oz.  I love them so next time I'll use the whole 3oz bag.

EXCELLENT!!! This dish is great with a couple moderations.  I ony used about 1/3 of olive oil in place of the butter and I used two cut up roma tomatos in place of the sundried and we like alittle spice so I added some cayenne pepper, I also added alittle oregano for extra flavor!

This was just ok. I used canned chicken from Sam's which was really tender and good. The sauce was bland so I added white wine. Onion would be good too. This is a quick meal that will satisfy your family though.

Excellent dish.  The only thing I altered was to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk to the sauce.  I thought there was more than enough sauce to coat everything.  The dish was very flavorful & the sundried tomatoes added a nice tang.

Thanks for sharing : )

I made a few modifications and it turned out much better.  I didn't brown the garlic, just sauted it on low for a few minutes.  Used heavy cream (adding water when needed) instead of milk, added some nutmeg, and let it simmer for a bit longer to let the flavors meld more.  It turned out really nice.

Very good and easy base receipe!! I rated it a 4 because I had to make some modifications which made it a 5!! I took some suggestions from others and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter, added crushed red pepper for a little heat, used parmesean cheese instead of Romano, cream of mushroom 0 because that was all I had and added frozen broccoli in the boiling water during the last 4 minutes of cooking my whole wheat spiral pasta.  SO YUMMY!!

This was wonderful!
I did make changes for what I had, what others sugested, and what I enjoy.  This recipe would be great many ways.

I didn't have romano so I used lots of parmesan, and I only had cream of mushroom soup and it was great!  I love veggies so I threw in some sauteed onions and zucchini.  1/2 of the pasta was perfect for the amount of sauce.  I used the sun dried tomatoes in a jar with oil, and actually cooked my chicken in some of that oil.  I added extra garlic and milk, and in the end I added a little sugar and crushed red pepper while it was simmering.  I substituted olive oil for butter, and italian seasoning for parsley.
Work with what you have and it will be great!

Seemed like too much butter for me so instead used about 2T olive oil.  Halved the pasta, used more chicken and the results were great!

Excellent recipe, and so easy!  I added some chopped spinach just before tossing in the chicken.  I might add some pine nuts and/or lemon pepper seasoning next time, but this recipe is great as-is.

I give this 4 stars with the recipe as is, but I make changes to it! 

CHANGES: 
1. 1 tsp black pepper during cooking (instead of 1/4)
2. Add 1-2 cups of chopped up fresh spinach after mixing sauce with pasta.  Heat just enough to warm spinach just before serving.
3. Change pasta from farfell to penne.  
4. Swap out parsley with Italian seasoning for more flavor.

i followed the recipe just about exact (I eyeballed the milk, chicken, tomato, parsley) and added more garlic.  It was great.  Something I would easily make again.  Next time, I might cut the butter or find a way to omit it- but not for taste.  I thought the pasta was the perfect shape, and I mixed it all together so it was a nice coating and not too saucy.

Very good! I made this with 2 chicken breasts because I wanted plenty of sauce. I added way more sun-dried tomatoes - too many for Husband, as it turned out - and also more milk, as it was very thick. I wouldn't describe this as restaurant quality, but it was very tasty. Thanks, Damon!

Good recipe, my husband and I both enjoyed it.  However, there are a few things I would do differently.  My biggest complaint is that there is way too much pasta for the sauce--it was too dry.  I would probably use half to 3/4 the pasta next time.  Also, I used 1/4 cup butter instead, two chicken breasts, extra sun-dried tomatoes, and parmesan cheese instead of romano.  In the future I would use extra cheese as well.  It was yummy though, and I'll make it again with those modifications.

YUMMY! My boyfriend and I are amateur cookers but this was easy and delicious. BUT I will definitely make more sauce next time and use a lot less pasta than the entire 16 oz. box. We used less and it still didn't have enough sauce. We also used parmesan instead of romano. Still gets 5 stars because the flavor is definitely there.

This recipe was extremely quick and easy to prepare.  I did use bagged, cooked chicken breast, which turned out fine.  I also added some basil & oregeno.  My family thought is was really good for the amount of time put in.  Give the recipe a try when you need something quick, filling & tasty.

I loved this recipe.  It has great flavor and was really easy to make!  I didn't use the butter to sautee the garlic-- just used some Pam which worked fine.  I also ended up halving the recipe and found that there didn't seem to be a lot of sauce-- I ended up adding another couple of tablespoons of the cream of chicken soup and a little more milk and it was perfect!

This made a great dinner, and it was  relatively easy too!  I did have to make a few alterations. I found that the recipe was salty enough without the additional 1/2 tsp; that may have been affected by the salt content of my cream of chicken soup. I recommend you season the sauce to taste.  I also added a touch more milk to thin the sauce, and had to use parmesan instead of romano.  All in all,  a good recipe.  Thanks Damon.

This is a fabulous recipe! I added mushrooms to the garlic and butter and sauted them until soft and continued the recipe as usual. My husband and I are not crazy about sundried tomatoes so I just replaced them with a chopped fresh tomato. It was perfect. There was no hint that this sauce was made with a can of soup. My husband kept saying how delicious it was. A definate keeper!

This dish was easy to make and very tastey.  Next time I think I would use reduced sodium cream of chicken soup as it was a bit salty.

Did not like this recipe at all.  Certainly not enough sauce for a pound of pasta.  Added some chicken stock to thin out sauce but still a thick gluey consistency.  Would not make it again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used half the pasta, so I thought I had just the right amount of sauce.  I also used twice the tomatoes.  It is, indeed, mighty garlicky, so next time I may try only two cloves.  And it seemed that a whole stick of butter was a bit excessive.  1/4 or 1/3 cup might have worked just as well.  But, I ate the entire thing in three days (dinner and lunch) which for me is something new.  And I immediately bought another bag of tomatoes, so that I could make it again.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

this recipe is wonderful except it has too much pasta.  I made exactly as called for and I thought a half box of pasta would have been better.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a great, go-to "nothing left in the pantry" kind of meal. I did not pre-cook the chicken breast. Instead for the sake of time and making this a one pot meal, I added the pieces of raw chicken directly to the sauce with an extra 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C water and turned out great. I also used the bottom of several different kinds of boxes of pasta probably measuring about 10-12oz and this was plenty of sauce - I used probably 1/2C of the pasta cooking water to add the sauce to the pasta. I also only used 2T of butter.

This was great and so easy. My variations were I cut up my chicken and sautéed it with the garlic in olive oil. Used Italian seasoning and white wine instead of milk Also used about 12 oz ww pasta.. I make my own oven roasted tomatoes in Evoo, garlic, and rosemary. Keep them in the freezer and popped them into this dish. Will definately make again.

My whole family LOVED this meal. Even my 8 year old who is very picky.  I followed the recipe. The only thing I changed was the amount of butter. I thought there was a ton of flavor.  The amount of sauce was perfect!! Hubby said this is a cheat day meal for sure and asked for it again.  Thank you for the recipe....

We used soy "chicken" and cream of mushroom instead of real chicken and cream of chicken soup, since we are vegetarians. It was delicious. I think it could have done with a little more sauce and tomatoes, though.

I never review things but this recipe was amazing. So so good and all my guests loved it. I used mushroom soup instead, less butter,more garlic , more tomatoes and more chicken. So delicious. I can't believe some people don't like it on here. Seriously a must try.

I used whole wheat penne, which was good as well. The amount of sauce, however, should be doubled for a 16-ounce package.  I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, and it was still plenty.  I would never use the full 1/2 cup.  I also used probably 1.5 cups of sundried tomatoes (packed in oil).  It was very good; my husband really enjoyed it.  Very rich; I will not make it often as it is very fattening.

Enjoyed by the entire family.  The only variations I made were adding a dab of italian seasoning.  I made this for my freezer cooking group in bulk, so I cooked all my chicken (thighs) in the crock pot with some of the sauce, including the sundried tomatoes.  I diced my tomatoes in the food processor because my kids don't like them, but they had no problem with them diced and cooked a long time.  (I don't like them in big, hard chunks either.)  I doubled the sauce as some suggested, except the butter.  Very, very good.  I think it will be enjoyed by all 6 families!

Very quick, easy recipe...usually stuff I have on hand too.  Definitely decrease the pasta and increase the tomato.  I added some left over chicken broth to thin it out a bit and make it more kid-appealing.  I chopped us some steamed broccoli too, but I feel that it competed with the tomato.

I just made this for a pitch in at work tomorrow, and I couldn't stay out of it! I loved loved LOVED this recipe!! I used minced garlic from q jar because I didn't have fresh garlic. I also let the sun dried tomatoes rehydrate in the sauce instead of separately. I pretty much stuck to the rest of the recipe, except for adding some fresh chives and a little feta cheese on top. So yummy, I may not even share it with my co-workers tomorrow.

Terrific after adding a little bit of spice to it. Great Basic recipe. I didn't have Romano so I used Parmesean cheese. Added 1/2 tsp of Chili flakes which gave it a nice zip my family loves.

Delicious, and super easy.  I made extra sauce and I'm glad I did, it was so good.  My daughter that doesn't like tomatoes LOVED this.  Next time I may add broccoli or serve it on the side, as the sauce would really compliment it.

This was the very first recipe I made from this site and have now made it twice. I omitted the butter and used a little canola oil instead. I also used low fat milk and no salt. I added extra garlic as I do with all recipes since it's never enough. And added red pepper flakes for some hot spice This was great: Quick, easy and tastey.

I thought this was great. Slight changes---half the butter, half the pasta, a 1/4 cup of white wine at the same time as the garlic.  Even the kiddos ate it up with a side of strawberry spinach salad. I cooked my chicken tenderloins in the butter (in a skillet) before adding the garlic. I removed them and then added again according to the directions.

The whole family loved this :-) We like a lot of sauce, so I added another can of soup and changed the milk to a cup. I also added some broccoli. This will definately be a regular at our house.

I used sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, and the flavor was awesome. I would recommend cutting them up into bite-size pieces.

I was really excited to try this after tasting an amazing sundried tomatoe with prawns dish at a local restaurant, but this was a fail for me. Too much salt, and the sauce was too thick even though I added white wine and extra milk. It came out tasting like condensed soup with extra salt. I will not make this again.

I love this recipe! I use the sauce over chicken breasts instead of using it with pasta and it's amazing. The only changes I have made (I've made this twice) was to add white wine and the first time I added fresh basil and the second time I used fresh rosemary.

This was absolutely delicious!!!! I used more garlic than it called for just because I love garlic. Other than that everything was the same. I don't see now people thought it was bland it was so flavorful. The only difference I am going to make next time is to make more sauce.

I made this today and followed the recipe, except used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 box of farfalle.  It is delicious!  Definitely restaurant quality, and very simple to make.  Am going to make it next time I have company.  Of course, you can always cut the butter and use fat free soup to make it lighter if you want.  Great recipe!

We will be making this again!  Per reviews, I added about a cup of white wine to the sauce.  I will be adding more sun dried tomatoes next time, but otherwise followed the directions to a T.  Good family meal, this kids loved it.

This was really good with some variations...I cubed the chicken and seasoned it with basil, salt, pepper and oregano. Then I sauteed onion and asparagus in olive oil until almost tender, then added the sundried tomatoes - cooked for about 2 min, then added garlic and followed the rest of the recipe.

I have made this recipe many times and keep forgetting to review it.  It deserves another great review since we make it all the time and it has become a favorite in our household.  The only thing I change is that I add a lot more sun dried tomatoes just because we love the flavor!  Excellent recipe to pull out and use over and over again!

I thought this was pretty bland as is so I made the following modifications: - used only 1/4 tsp of salt - used olive oil in place of butter and half the amount - used about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped basil - used about 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes - added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, if you like it spicy you might want to add more.  We loved this and I will make it again for sure with these changes.

I rated this 5 stars because it was so surprisingly good considering the main ingredient is cream of chicken soup!  We used just over a half box of baby bowties, and the sauce was plenty. I used julienned sundried tomato in oil, omitted the butter completely, used healthy request soup, and just sauteed the garlic in a little evoo first before adding the soup, milk, and tomatoes.  Instead of adding in the chicken, we cooked turkey cutlets on their own to mix up the flavors.  Very good!

Great tasting and unbelievably easy. I followed many of Jaime's suggestions. I doubled the sauce ingredients but used only 6 Tbsp of butter and did not double the parsley. I didn't have chicken to prepare for this, so I used 3 cans of COSTCO chicken breasts. This was really a tasty dish and a great dinner to make on a busy evening.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe, because there just wasn't much flavor.  Maybe it's because I used fat free soup?  If I make this again, I will only use two chicken breasts and will marinade them in italian dressing before cooking.  I would cut down on the amount of pasta, too, because it was a little dry.

This was very tasty. I didnt have any bow tie pasta on hand so i used the corkscrew kind and it worked well. My husband really enjoyed it. I have to admit i did not use all the butter the recipe called for i substituted some olive oil for it and it still was wonderful.

I made this a while back and this is great. I followed the recipe, except for I added additional garlic...but I always add additional garlic.  It was very easy to make, easy on the wallet and was very tastey and filling.

I really liked this recipe.  I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil and added a can of artichokes.  There were no leftovers.  I will be making this again.

good, only thing is that the sauce becomes a little too thick. Next time, I would add a little white wine or chicken stock to think it out

This recipe was easy to make and yummy.  I did make a few changes...instead of sun dried tomatoes I used yellow and orange bell peppers.  The husband is not a fan of tomatoes.  I sautéed them in olive oil and then put them in the cream sauce.  I did add two extra cloves of garlic (love the garlic!!), and some extra cream of chicken.  I also added some red pepper to spice it up.  Overall, I thought this was a simple, delicious recipe.  Great for a last minute meal.

The whole family loved this one! I was so excited to see my 8 yr old give me a thumbs up while my 5 1/2 yr old was diving right in. Our 1 yr old even approved LOL! I did two modifications to the recipe. I used 12oz of pasta instead of the full 16oz and I only used 6 Tbsps of butter instead of a 1/2 cup. Next time I might add a little wine. When my husband wants seconds I know the recipe is a keeper and I add it to my monthly meal planner. Thank you!

I made this recipe one night when my husband and I had an overnight guest.  Both my husband and our friend went back for seconds, which my husband NEVER does!  I wasn't too thrilled with the sundried tomatoes but it tasted ok to me.  My husband has already asked when I will make it again...guess I'll learn to deal with the tomatoes.

This recipe was very good.  It was a nice meal to make on a weekday and the family enjoyed it.  I was leary of the condensed soup, so I bought the light version.  I also made a few changes.  I browned the garlic and then added boiled chicken to brown.  I also used fresh parsley.  I did'nt add any salt (because of soup and sundried tomatoes- enough with the sodium).  In addition I used 5 cloves of garlic- after all I am italian.

Excellent and easy to make!  Took me a little work with the spices to make sure it doesn't just taste like I  poured chicken soup over pasta.  Will consider using egg-noodles next time to mesh the flavors.  Overall a great dish, that looks more complicated than it is!

Amazing recipe.. everyone in my family loved it! It was one of the first real recipes that I ever followed (I'm just beginning to cook now) and I was so happy with the results. I did add some white wine for extra flavor and  then some broccoli for extra color. It looked beautiful in the dish.. I cannot say more good things about this recipe and SO easy!!

To add a little twist, I tossed in fresh bacon bits to give it a carbonera twist and the taste of the bacon and sun dried tomatoes together were heaven!  This was the PERFECT quick recipe to cook for my household when I wasn't really in the mood to cook!  Fabulous!

I cooked this pasta for dinner the other night and I thought it was just ok - my husband liked it more than I did though.  I did change the recipe somewhat.  I used cream of mushroom soup, I sauteed a shallot and a clove of garlic with the chicken.  I also added some blanched asparagus which I'd cut up.  In the end, we found that this dish didn't really wow us at all.

I loved this recipe, I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom, and it was very tasty with that. I added crushed red peppers to give it a kick which was real nice. My dad said it looked like something from the Cheesecake Factory, looks kind of like the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Had to add milk because it got a bit dry. Thanks for the recipe!

This was phenomenal! I also doubled all the ingredients for the sauce and added 2 chopped zucchini’s. I only used about 3/4 cup of skim milk and that was plenty. I also added about 1-2 tlbs of sugar near the end, while it was simmering.

This was surprisingly good.  I wouldn't say it was five-star quality, but much better than I was expecting.  If you're expecting to make sauce for 8 people from the ingredients listed, though, think again.  I made the pasta for two and still used a whole can of condensed soup.  I also added some basil, and fried the chicken in the pan with the garlic (used olive oil instead of butter)... it was good.  If I have one gripe with this recipe, it's that the sauce is too thick.  Next time I might add more milk and see where that takes me.

Very good...used cream of mushroom because we were out of cream of chicken. Next time I will use half the pasta so that it is a little more saucey as a previous reviewer suggested. We put half the leftovers in the freezer...hope it's good when we pull it out and make it in a pinch!

Delicious! We made this over mini penne, used cubed chicken from a roast sticky chicken. The house smelled heavenly! We thought that the sauce was a little thick so we added 1 cup of chardonnay. We used fresh grated parmesan instead of Romano. This was like something from a nice restaurant. We will make this again. Thank you for the post :)

Good, but ended up getting tired of the sun-dried tomatoes, which I didn't expect. I used rainbow rotini and Parmesan cheese instead of the farfalle and Romano. The sauce was very good-- used my lactose-free milk. I'm sure I'll make it again sometime, but maybe do something different with the tomatoes.

My daughter made this.  And Damon, you are right, you can't go wrong with the ingredients.  We used penne because we didn't have farfalle, which worked fine.  We also added a bit more cheese.  Thanks!

This recipe was very tasty and pretty easy to make...I used whole wheat pasta and it was great. I would add less butter next time as I don't think that much butter is necessary. Also used fat free soup.

Excellent!  My husband loved it and it is very hard to get him to try and like new foods.  This is easily converted to a "light" recipe by using skim milk, whole wheat pasta, and 1/2 the fat cream of chicken soup.  Also, doubling the veggies (I used mixed frozen veggies) increases the health value. Very yummy and will make again!

I made a meatless (no chicken), slightly altered version of this, and it stilled turned out good.  Here's what I did:  I used about 2 T. oil instead of the butter.  I addded 1 t. paprika, only a dash of salt, and 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese (instead of Romano).  I mixed cooked spaghetti noodles (they were leftover--maybe 3/4 pound?) with the sauce, poured it all into a sprayed casserole dish, topped it with fresh tomato slices and then shredded Cheddar cheese, and baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes.  Yum!

All of my roommates, my boyfriend & I loved this!  I will definately be fixing it again.  I used low fat cream of mushroom soup (instead of cream of chicken), olive oil (instead of butter) & skim milk.  The only other change I made was that I didn't cook the chicken before adding it to the pan so I just let it simmer until the chicken was cooked through (about 15 minutes total, I think).  When I make it again, I'm going to cut the pasta by half.  

Yummy & Easy... just the way I like 'em!  Thanks!

My family loved this. Based on others' experience, I added a splash of white wine,  chopped red onion, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and a can of artichoke hearts. I thought the amount of sauce and the flavor was just right.

Like others, I cut out the butter and just used olive oil, I also used 2 cans of the soup, 1 can of milk, and instead of the sun dried tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes. I added the juice with the tomatoes, but if I were to make it again, I would drain the juice. I also added 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese. Some italian spices would also add some flavor!

I like a little more sauce for my pasta so I used two cans of soup and added water as well as milk to the sauce. Oh, and I used condensed cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  I did not use any butter, just a little olive oil for sauteeing and also sauteed a carton of sliced mushrooms and added that to the sauce.  Also stirred in some fresh chopped basil at the end and omitted the dried parsley.  Didn't have Romano so I used freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese which worked very well. When you have a store-bought roasted chicken on hand, this is a very easy, not to mention, a very tasty dish.

My family loved it.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 8 and there was plenty to go around plus a lot left over.  Had to substitute the tomatos with chopped stewed tomatos and used rotini, but it was still fantastic. The kids liked it as well as the adults.  A+.

This was really good. I read a lot of the reviews and used some white wine and seasoned the chicken before I cooked it. My bow tie pasta was stale so I ended up using linguine. I'll try a different pasta next time. Will definitely make again! It was good and easy.

I boiled my chicken breast in water with with 1/4 cup chicken flavored soup base added. Boiled my pasta ( 8 oz) in the same water. Used sun dried tomato pesto.  Omitted salt. This was a wonderful chicken pasta dish.

This recipe was delicious! I did make a couple of changes. 
 One change, which was suggested by others, was not to use the entire box of farfalle. I did use about 3/4 of the box, though. The other change I made was adding a large handful of raw spinach towards the end and cooked until it was just wilted.  This was SO good the second day - arguably even better.

This was pretty good as written, but a little salty for me.  Next time I think I'll use a lower sodium soup, or make my own white sauce.  The sun dried tomatoes added a nice pop of flavor!  I did add sliced portobello mushrooms and a can of drained quartered artichokes for added veggies.  Overall, I'm sure to make this again!

This was really good and easy to put together. I always have to adjust the recipe with what I have on hand. I had cream of mushroom soup but I'm going to try it next time with cream of chicken. I used a regular tomato instead of sun dried tomato. I also added Italian seasonings. I had penne pasta. I think any pasta would be good. Enjoy.

3 stars because I made changes--with changes a 4 star, but we all know how the "purest" cooks/reviewers can be.  This box does ask if you made changes so here they are: added some white wine to make more sauce and didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I added a can of drained Italian seasoned diced tomatoes--both additions really added to the flavor.  Also, hubby smokes several pounds of chicken for future use--which went into this dish, but any leftover chicken would work well too.  Topped with grated Parmesan--family loved it--will make again with stated changes.

This is a very good recipe. Hubby and I enjoyed it! The only thing I did was add an extra can of cream of chicken soup (I made this adjustment based on others' reviews). Everything else I followed exactly. Will be adding this one to my regular rotation.

This is by far one of my favorite recipes EVER! It's very easy to make and so delicious! I always make a double batch right away. But, even so, everyone wants more leftovers. I just made this Friday night, and here it is Monday and I've made it again because the kids and husband were begging for it. My only change to the original recipe is I substitute Parmesan cheese for the Romano.....I always have Parmesan on hand and not the Romano. I have only been able to find the sun dried tomatoes in a jar with olive oil.....so no rehydrating of them has been necessary.

If I had followed the recipe better this would have probably been a 5 star meal but I'm not too sure. I accidentally only made half of the pasta but double the sauce recipe since that was the most recommended. Sun dried tomatoes have a very intense taste compared to the subtle and soft taste of the sauce so if you don't like a sunburst of surprise burning your mouth I would suggest probably using cut up tomatoes instead of sun dried. My family loved it but I wish the recipe mentioned a good time to start cooking the chicken. Overall it was really great and will probably make again and try following the recipe better.

This was really good. We used leftover chicken from a whole baked chicken. Instead of farfalle we used linguine. Added Crushed red pepper to give it a little kick! We all  really enjoyed it!

I first made this recipe about a year and a half ago, first time cooking for my boyfriend. We absolutely love this dish! I add crushed red pepper and mushrooms and it turned out great! I always have sundried tomatoes and we bought a case of the soup so we always have it on hand. Would absolutely recommend this recipe and already have to friends and coworkers!

I'm one of those incompetent cooks where I MUST follow a recipe, or else it is downright inedible and this one is a hit. . This was the perfect recipe for left over grilled chicken.  I always have a can of cream of chicken or mushroom on hand. I only had one good sized chicken breast left, so I just cut it into smaller pieces.   When I first served this to my 8 y/o buttered pasta loving kid, I got a "boo!" However, he and my 10 y/o daughter ate it up pretty fast, along with having seconds.  Winner, winner chicken dinner. I will for sure add this to my dinner rotation.  Thanks.

Made this tonight. Very good. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I used 2 fresh Romas, fresh from my garden.  I only had fat-free soup, next time I will use full fat version but it still tasted good. I only used 3/4 of the can and added more milk. Then I used a little of the pasta water to thin it. I like my pasta with more sauce than the photo showed.

I used leftover fried chicken breast, just removed skin and bones and cut in bite size pieces. Had 1-1/2 breasts. Made it very economical and quicker.

Substituted marinated sundried tomatoes for plain sundried tomatoes.  Will use a little less pasta than what's in the box next time.  Will make again.

I substituted the sun-dried tomatoes with canned "Italian Style" tomatoes and used linguine noodles and it turned out beautiful! I will be adding this recipe to my routine.

OMG, this is a great recipe, we thought we were eating at an Italian Restaurant!, the only thing this sauce is only enough for 8-10 oz pasta, i used a 16 oz pkg so i have to make more sauce, we loved it!!!

This recipe had good flavor but is VERY rich. I cut the butter in half and will probably use only 1/4 of what is called for next time. I also recommend reducing or eliminating the added salt. I will make this again, the family liked it and it was easy.

I couldn't figure out how to give a 3 1/2 star rating.  This was good and I would make it again.  I followed some of the suggestions.  Less butter probably about 3 tbsp.  Added a little crushed pepper, less parsley and some Italian seasoning.  I used vit D milk and 1/2 cup of white wine and sun dried tomatoes in oil, no cheese on hand.  This ended up being a really thick sauce.  Next time I will omit the wine because I don't think it adds to this recipe with the strong flavor of the cream of chicken soup.  Instead I will use more milk to thin the sauce a bit.

Good recipe but it was too heavy on the Cream of chicken soup.  I'll make again but will substitute the cream of chicken soup with a white wine/heavy cream combo instead.

This dish is DELISH! I have made it with both stewed tomatoes, grape tomatoes and without the chicken as a side dish. Any way I swing it it is delish!! I like it best as a side with grape tomatoes cut in half!

Thought it was just OK.  Not a huge fan of using cream of whatever soup but was looking for something fast.  My son was not a fan.  Maybe the suggestion of others using some white wine might make it better.  Otherwise, I probably won't make it again.

Enjoyed this, fairly easy to make.  I used sundried tomatos in oil and more than suggested.  Found it difficult to thin breast enough to wrap around mixture.

I really liked, but won't give 5 stars because I had to make adjustments so that it was not too blend: per reviews I added white wine. I also added mushrooms, fresh parsley, red pepper flakes and bacon pieces. The end result was great! I would do it again and again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was SO good.  The sauce was creamy and delicious.  The only suggestion I have it to perhaps make more of the sauce.  I used a 12 oz. box of pasta and it was just enough to cover it all.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was absolutely fabulous, even my picky boyfriend loved it. I was skeptical about the cream of chicken soup, but it turned out to be a wonderful sauce. I would have liked more sauce, just because I prefer my pasta to have a lot of sauce. But it all came together to be a great tasting meal and was super easy to make too. Next time I might try adding some mushrooms or some asparagus on the side. Really delicious meal.

Wonderful recipe!  My husband even liked it and he's a little hard to please.  The only part I messed up on was cooking the chicken first.  I had to fish it out and pan cook it quickly and then readd it to the sauce and cook a little longer.  Definitely a once or twice a month meal.  Very easy.

Great recipe and very easy to make, I wouldn't say there is anything really "special" about this dish which is why I only gave it 4 stars but I've made it twice already and will continue to do so.

It was decent. Honestly I like garlic but this dish screamed garlic. I would reduce the garlic to one. FYI: To rehydrate the sundried tomatoes you just put them in your measuring cup with 8oz of water and microwave them for 1 minute on high and then 1 minute on 50% power. Then just let them sit for 5 minutes - WAH LA! The dish was okay. The sauce was too thick for my taste, esp. if you wanted to eat it for leftovers. I didn't really alter anything on the recipe...it was just okay. I don't think I will make this recipe again.

Yum!  I made this without the chicken (because I didn't have any) and doubled the sauce.  For such a quick and simple recipe it was a lot better than I expected.  The sauce is way too tasty.  I couldn't help but sample it while cooking.  Excellent, will make again!

Very, Very good pasta. I wish I could have made more. The sauce has a great flavor and the tomatoes add more to the flavor. I will absolutely do this recipe again. Next time I am going to cook the chicken bits before putting them in the sauce. Just because the chicken let out juice. I did not have farfalle pasta so I used whole wheat penne pasta. I also used the 98% condensed chicken. Sooooo goooood....We cleaned our plates.

I loved this recipe!! I added a bit more to make some more sauce, but then found it a bit too salty. I won't add the additional salt next time and may add some white wine, as another member suggested.. Very good overall.. will definitely make it again!!

This came out a little salty for my taste and the sauce was really thick! But it was really good other than that, I don't know that I'll make it again though, I'd rather make something like that from scratch.

This one is definately a keeper. I think it's "the Bite" that the romano has that really kick starts this pasta dish. I added a fraction more liquid to the sauce (personal preference)
FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!

Very easy to make and full of flavour. My boyfriend who is a fussy eater has called this his favourite dish. I omitted the romano cheese and instead of dry parsley I put in fresh herb paste. Occasionally I will also put in a tablespoon of tomato pesto for extra flavour & colour. Also a hit with guests.

My husband and I have made this recipe several times and love it! It's really easy and very delicious.   We use a T of Olive Oil now when cooking instead of all that fatty butter. Other than that, great!

YUMMY! This recipe is so good. Made it for friends and they said it was restuarant quality. Followed the recipe. I cooked the chicken ahead of time with Emerils Bayou Blast and fied in a little EVOO and 1 Tbs. of butter until browned and no longer pink. I just put it in the fridge until needed. Good stuff! Will make again.

This was really good!:)  When I saw condensed cream of chicken soup for the sauce I thought YUCK!  But it turned out so GOOD!:)  I used an 8 oz pkg of pasta and kept the sauce ingredients the same.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing!:)

This recipe was delicious! My husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I followed the recipe more closely than any ever before, but I also added broccoli and used garlic spaghetti instead of farfalle. Read the ingredients/ directions carefully and cook the chicken before it goes in the sauce!

Easy and yummy - didn't feel too heavy, it was nice to use Cream of Chicken soup instead of a cream.  I used sun dried tomatoes that were in olive oil and herbs and I also used fettucine instead.

Decent flavor, but incredibly salty. I recommend not adding the half teaspoon of salt; the cream of chicken takes care of enough salt content, in my opinion. I also cooked the chicken in the sauce, which I believe added a lot of flavor.

What flavor?  This recipe definitely lacked flavor, but I think it has potential.  I think if I were to make it again, I would chop the sun-dried tomatoes up so that you could get a taste of them with every bite.  I also think I will try a bit of sherry, or more romano cheese...it needs something.  I might play around with the leftovers tonight.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I left out the sun dried tomatoes but added broccolli and doubled the sauce-it makes enough for two pounds of pasta.  I cooked the chicken on the barbeque.  My family loved it.

This was so easy to make and the falvor was wonderful.  My husband does not like cream sauces on pasta, of any kind.  When he asked for seconds, I knew I found a keeper.  I didn't change a single thing when making this recipe.  We will make this again

It was good, but not as great as I expected.  I thought it was a little bland, but maybe its because I used the healthy version of the soup.  Next time I will make more sauce-I like a lot- and perhaps some more garlic or other seasoning.

This recipe was a huge hit with my parents.  Since I am a new regular in the kitchen and am still have a lot to learn, my parents are always a little leery to eat my dinners.  This was the first thing I made that made them say "WOW!!!"  My Dad said it was just as good as going to the Olive Garden.  This recipe is supposed to serve eight, but the three of us finished it off very quickly.

This recipe was about average, If I make it again I will use the oil kept sundried tomatoes instead of the dried.  The recipe was generaly lacking in flavor.

Very rich, but very good!  The only thing I changed was using reduced sodium/fat soup and parmesan cheese instead of romano.  Delicious with salad and good crusty bread!

Sorry to say that my husband and I did not like this at all.  I thought it was very bland and had a definate canned soup flavor.  I did use an off-brand can of soup, so that may have been part of the problem, even so, I still won't make it again.

This was a very big hit in my house.  My children ask for it everyday!!!  The only thing they don't like are the sundried tomatoes.  I just add them when serving for my husband and myself.  Great dish...won't change a thing.

My husand and I thought this was just "ok".  I listened to previous postings and doubled up the soup and milk and was sorry I did as I thought it was too rich and overwhelming despite the fact that I used 98% fat free soup and 1% milk.  I won't make this again but that may be due to doubling things that I shouldn't have.

I followed previous reviews and added 2 cans of soup + 1 cup of milk.  I used butter however, for more flavor.  I cheated on the spices however, and used Mrs. Dash Italian Blend (a lot of it).  I couldn't find Romano cheese except for a 6-cheese blend of Italian cheeses, but it turned out just fine.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of sundried.  My 5-year-old and husband LOVED it!

This was wonderful!  My husband and I loved it, and our 3 year old thought it was okay.  I did make some changes based on some of the other reviews and it turned out really well.  This is  is a terrific base recipie for any pasta dish.  The changes I made were:  1/2 bag of fresh spinich, 3 oz of sundried tomatoes (whole bag), 1/2 cup of dry white wine, used skim milk, 1 cup sliced mushrooms, 99% fat free chicken soup, fresh grated Asiago cheese, less butter than specified. I cooked the chicken in the butter/garlic and because I was trying to be quick used frozen chicken tenderloins and jar'd minced garlic.  Enjoy!

OH MY!  That was just to easy, to be that delicious.  What a great quick recipe to make when company is coming over (or just drop in)..they will think you cooked for hours!!  I did add more milk(upped it to 3/4c) to make more sauce and it didnt change the flavor.  But I still had to leave out some of the pasta, ab 1-2C.  It is to dry if you use the whole pound of cooked pasta.  I will definitely have to double the recipe next time! lol

We loved the recipe! My 10-month-old gobbled down the pasta like it was going out of style, and my husband, who is generally very picky, even ate the leftovers! I added some red onion and a few artichoke hearts for taste, and will probably use a little less margarine next time. GREAT recipe--easy, fast, and yummy, thanks to Perdue ShortCuts for the chicken.

I made this from ingredients on hand, so subtituted large pasta, and FRESH grated parmesan cheese. I also cooked the chicken in the butter/garlic.  This is the finest pasta recipe we have ever had. My 3 and 5 year old grandchildren also loved it.

This was really quite good!!!  I just had a couple of things that I did differently---I added Italian Seasoning instead of the parsley, added red onions with the garlic and added some marinated artichoke hearts (yummmmm!) when I added the sun-dried tomatoes.  Our family loved this recipe and I will be making it again and again.  Thanks Damon

Very good.  I think it would be better without the sundried tomato's or chopped 
very finely.  It was extremely good and will definetly make it again.

This was a really great recipe.  I made it for a pot-luck last night, and it was a huge hit.  The only complaint that I have is that it was not as saucy as I'd like.  Next time, I'll leave out some of the pasta.  I'm also going for more sun-dried tomatoes.  Thanks, Damon!

I had my neighbors over for dinner and decided to try this recipe.  It was a big hit.  I did make two changes, adding onions along with the garlic and chopping the sundried tomatoes (a must), both changes worked out well.  Definitely a "keeper"

This recipe was pretty easy to make. I used dehydrated sun-dried tomatoes which worked out
just fine. I would have liked it more if the sauce were more saucier or more tomatoey.
The taste was very good, though.

* I ended up using pre-crushed garlic b/c i was in a major rush. I couldn't even tell the difference. 
* I cooked the chicken fillets in a seperate frypan, adding italian herbs (the more the better), garlic and 1 inch pieces of chopped asparagus (1 bunch).
* I added alot more cheese (more like 5 tablespoons) to balance a miscalculation in the garlic which worked quite nicely.
* I used whole pieces of sundried tomatoes (very expensive here in OZ) but next time will try chopping (if i have time) into small 1 cm cubes - the 2 inch long pieces i had were just too overwhelming and didn't complement the chicken b/c of their size. I'll let you know how i go, b/c this is definately a nice dish.
* Hint: I used instant cup-a-soup (not canned) b/c i already had it in the cupboard (plus it's cheaper). With a bit more milk i'll bet most could get away with it!

I had printed this recipe off before and tried it.  My husband loved it nad has asked for it again.  My son doesn't like anything with "gravy" right now.  It's a phase.  I loved it and it was so easy to make.

I love this recipe!  Chicken and pasta are both so easy to cook.  It's great when you want something quick and easy after a day at work.
