I love potatoes and any excuse to use my instant pot. I made this for a potluck at work, with yukon gold potatoes specifically, plus a couple of adjustments:
a) Added greek yogurt after sauteeing and mashing (I always do this with mashed potatoes--great sour cream substitute)
b) Added some shredded sharp white cheddar after sauteeing and mashing
c) Only did half the leek called for, but my leeks were pretty huge and I didn't want to overdo it.

I work with a lot of foodies and I've already had two of them reach out to ask for my changes because they wanted to take them to a Thanksgiving or other holiday potluck. This recipe is a great base for mashed potatoes that you can easily customize with your preferences!

Ding ding ding we have another winner of a recipe from this submitter! I made exactly as written and they turned out perfectly. After hubs took his first bite, I asked him what the verdict was. His response was, "Light, Airy, Fluffy, Flavorful". So there you have it and I couldn't agree more. I do recommend doubling the recipe. The leftovers held up nicely and you'll be wanting more the next day so do yourself a favor.

Wonderfully creamy and enjoyable! It was way better than I expected! Without an instant pot, I used a rice cooker, but it still came out great! I used some shredded hard white cheddar and sour cream like mentioned in other comments, and it came out even better!
