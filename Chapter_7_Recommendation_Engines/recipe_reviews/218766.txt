I typically don't try anything from allrecipes if it doesn't have at least a few ratings and 4 stars. I am glad I did with this dish. It is super easy, super fast and came out delicious. The only alteration I made was adding black pepper to taste. It really is fantastic & will be making again.

Very easy and tasty, a great way we used up our leftover Christmas ham. I didn't have the special broccoli pkgs, but I prefer fresh so I steamed my own, seasoned with salt & pepper, and added 1 extra cup of cheese to the filling. The rolls were a little gooey on the bottom, didn't bother me but I might go past the 25 min cooking time a little bit next time. Great recipe!

This was delicious. My husband doesn't like casseroles, but liked this! I added lots of salt and pepper and some onion powder.Next time I would use the dough flat over the top. The dough didn't cook evenly on my oven cut up like that although the presentation was very pretty. I might even try this recipe with egg noodles. I will make it again soon!

This was alright.  I felt the need to add some finely chopped fresh garlic and freshly cracked black pepper, which turned out to be good additions.  I think the onions should be sauteed a bit first as they had too sharp of a raw taste.  Also, the crescents were a bit doughy on the bottoms and the broccoli packet provided hardly enough cheese sauce.  Wish I'd added more mozzarella, Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano cheese to the mix.
