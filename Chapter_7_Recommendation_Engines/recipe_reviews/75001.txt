Very moist-interesting flavor-stuck to the grill a little more than most, but that was because of the cheese.  I did actually soften onions before-as I am not a big onion fan and I did add a dash of A-1 Steak Sauce. Should have chopped the onions finer, but great flavor. Likely to make again.

These were good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and froze the mixture. I pulled them out and cooked them on the stove (it was too cold to grill). These were good and everyone enjoyed them. I guess I make bigger burgers because with doubling the recipe, I only got 10 burgers.

I made this recipe but substituted a combo of onion salt and onion powder for the onion (because my kids don't like onion) and used cheddar jack cheese (because that's what I had on hand).  It was very delicious.  The burgers were very juicy with a hint of cheese melted in them.  I will make it again.  My daughter didn't think it tasted any different from my regular burgers but I could tell the difference in the juiciness and even a slight hint of cheese taste and she ate over half of her burger this time which is unusual for her.

Not bad...

I added a little Steak Seasoning Spice to give it extra flavor.  I had problems with the patties falling apart, and the cheese popping at me in the frying pan.  Otherwise, these were very tasty!

My daughter told me these were delicious hamburgers after dinner tonight and she was right. I used sharp white cheddar cheese. Yummy! They went great with the cherry tomato salad recipe on here!

Indeed, these were very moist burgers. I didn't use any egg. I used onion powder because I don't like crunchy onions. The cheese gave the meat an odd texture, too soft or something. We didn't care for the texture much, it seemed a bit fall-aparty in a meatloafy way, but the flavor was fine. Nothing special though.

These burgers were good.  My husband and I both enjoyed them and will probably try them again.  I added a little chili powder to the meat mix, just to add a little spice.  Next try I may add some red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe.

This wasn't the best burger I've had. But wasn't the worst either. It was just okay. I think it needed salt and pepper. I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. I put BBQ as a condiment and a slice of mozzarella cheese on top.

great! I changed it up a bit. I added all that plus a dash of soy sauce, some steak seasoning, and I added chopped up red peppers and mushrooms. My bf ate three of the burgers and my girls actually ate them. They NEVER eat meat.

My family enjoyed these okay, but I had higher expectations. I didn't discern much of the cheese flavor. Further, the burgers came out concentrated, more like a meatloaf than grilled hamburgers. Grilled hamburgers are always good, but I hoped for more from this recipe.

These are FANTASTIC!!!  So juicy and delicious!  The only things I do differently are I add minced garlic and instead of putting the onion in the burger, I slice it and grill it separately to put on top.  Sooo good!
