Yummy - but it needs a little garlic and dill.  Used FF yogurt, 2 Tbls lite sour cream AND 1-1/2 Tbls Mayo.  Used dried parsley - ok, but better I'm sure w/fresh. Add about 1/4-1/2 tsp dill weed.  Needs more than 2 Tbls milk.  Buttermilk even better.  Added a sprinkle of garlic powder and garlic salt.  Try mixing it in your blender rather than stirring as suggested.  Helps get the green onion and parsley minced down and mixed in.  5 stars w/added garlic & dill!

Used half FF plain yogurt and half FF sour cream because that was what I had. I thinned out the dressing with lowfat buttermilk, but it needed more than two tablespoons. Good as is, but needs something. I'd like to play with this recipe a bit. I liked the parmesan very much. NOTE: This made a ton. Almost four cups of dressing. If you don't eat dressing several times a day like we do, you might want to cut it back. Great for us. And you know, the longer it sits.....the better it is.

We really enjoyed this, even though I made a slight mistake, lol! I planned on halving this recipe, so I bought 1 container of yogurt (fat free). I go to make the recipe and then realize that the only thing I halved was the yogurt and kept all of the other ingredient amounts the same, but no worries because it was fantastic this way! I also added a clove of finely minced garlic. I will definately be using this recipe again, and often~very tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)

So I (almost) totally ruined a batch of homemade yogurt and was actually looking for a recipe that called for sour cream to *use up* my oops when I stumbled on this.  Thought "what the heck" and grabbed a cup of my almost but not quite yogurt stuff, and made recipe - - - only change I had to make (probably due to thin consistency of my poor yogurmess) was to add a tad more mayo to tighten it up a bit.  I do feel like it's missing something - not quite sure what (lemon juice?) but it's not had an hour to sit yet, so will tuck away in fridge and come back once flavors have meshed :) UPDATE:  oHHHHHHHH !!!  yUMMMMM

This is very good, especially considering how low in calories it is.  I didn't have parsley and used cilantro instead, which I think would be nice for Mexican food as a sauce.  I put in some minced garlic as well. It tastes best the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good as a dressing or a dip.  The Parmesan, green onions, and pepper provide so much flavor that you won't even notice this is a lowfat dressing.

I really did not like this.  I thought it tasted to much like yogurt with green onions. I guess I was expecting something else. Sorry Emily, not for me:(

Fabulous! I made this to use as a dip w/"breaded chicken fingers" & they went together perfectly. I'd like to try this w/mayo &/or sour cream instead of mayo next time, just a personal taste preference.

I used fat-free yogurt and fat-free mayo and the result was just awesome!

Just finished making this exactly as stated (unless you count the fact that I used sea salt instead of regular salt).  It is DELICIOUS exactly as stated.  I think what makes it so good is the combo of the fresh parsley and green onion.  I would not change a thing.  To me, adding garlic to it would make it something else entirely.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic.  But not in this.  This is excellent just as stated, letting the flavors of the fresh parsley and green onion come through.  Yum!!!!!

Too plain for my tastes.  I doubled the herbs (not pepper) and onion, then added some granulated garlic and dill. Let it sit once again.  There we go! I loved it after that tweaking, and definitely much better than any bottled dressing in the store.  I'll be making this often since there is lots of flavor punch for the low calories.

I found two teaspoons of pepper too much for me so the second time I made it I cut back to one.
The second time I used dried onion powder  as I did not have any fresh green onions. It was good too.

I liked this very much.  I didn't make any changes, except that I used good old home made mayonnaise, which makes the difference.

I didn't really think the yogurt worked here; the dressing was very heavy dairy. It works as low fat, but tasted almost like it was made with cottage cheese. I probably wouldn't make it again.

Liked the basic recipe...I used cilantro vs parsley, and added some grated lime zest and juice of half a lime, along with a tbsp of olive oil instead of the milk....the rest I kept the same.  Absolutely delicious on salad, and as a dressing for black bean burgers...Will make again!

This has just the right ranch flavor but it is really missing the creaminess from mayonnaise. It is better as a dip that salad dressing as is. Because the flavors are spot on I will try making this again and change the ratio of mayonnaise and yogurt to increase the mayonnaise and decrease the yogurt.

I used 2% plain Greek yogurt, half the amount of dried chives and parsley, and lite mayo (what I had on hand) but the rest was as directed. The Greek yogurt made it require probably more like 1/4-1/2 cup of milk. Other than that, WOW. I was surprised at the flavor. This is a really good recipe. I added some garlic to make this five stars to my liking, but it's really good as written.

Added garlic, cilantro, a dash of paprika and dill. Now it tastes like ranch. I agree with other reviewers that without adding stuff to it, it tastes rather bland and oniony. I also added extra black pepper.
