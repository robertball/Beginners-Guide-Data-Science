Split peas give this soup a bit of texture as well as they take away a bit of the sweetness of the pumpkin. Works for me, I'm not too keen about sweet food for supper! Great recipe!

It was great on a cold fal evening. I used green split peas, veggie burger instead of salt beef and asafotida instead of the bitters. Used a pressure cooker to cook it all. Everybody was pleased.

Just finished making this, and it is really delicious!  I unfortunately did not have all ingredients to hand, so I made the following substitutions/revisions:
1) Because I'm impatient, instead of soaking the split peas overnight, I started them cooking first, then just added the ingredients as I got them ready.
2) Used about 2-3 cup of diced fresh cooked ham on the bone.
3) I had a HUGE green chili pepper, so I removed the seeds first, diced it up and then sauteed it with the onions.
4) Didn't have any bitters, so I added about 1/2 cup of pumpkin ale.
5) At the tail end, I added about 2 teaspoons of curry.  (The soup tasted great as is, I just felt like curry is all.)

Thanks for the new and interesting twist on split peas!

This is really good.  I had never heard of "salt beef" before.  Thought of maybe adding ham but forgot.  I soak the peas over night then stuck it all in a crock pot and let it cook all day then blended.  Tasted good to me without the salt beef.  Super simple and nice change.  I didn't add all the onion they called for, seemed a bit much.  I just realized I used Lentils instead of split peas!!  Still yum

Great soup! I love the way the pumpkin compliments the split peas. I only added one onion because that seemed like plenty. And I used butter instead of margarine. I also spent 2 hours at various grocery stores looking for salt beef and never found any so went to Applebee’s because by that point I was starving to death, got kicked out for hitting happy hour a little too hard.... long story short, never found the beef. I made the soup without it and didn’t miss it... possibly because i didn’t know what it was? Oh well. Also I used green split peas, not yellow. And added carrots for that extra vitamin boost. Also added rosemary and sage. Tasted like thanksgiving :)
