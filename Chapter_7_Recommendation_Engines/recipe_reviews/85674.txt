About one month ago, I made these brownies for two coconut lovers merely because I was looking to use up some coconut rum and flaked coconut.  The raves from these two women were over the top.  I'm making them again this week for one of the women by request!  I tried them and they are very rich and moist - delicious.  I wouldn't change anything about this super easy recipe.

I thought this brownie was the perfect combo of chocolate and coconut. One suggestion is that the coconut on top should not be added until the last 10 minutes, otherwise it will burn. I threw a few chocolate chips on top when they came out of the oven, too. Very moist! Thanks for the recipe!
