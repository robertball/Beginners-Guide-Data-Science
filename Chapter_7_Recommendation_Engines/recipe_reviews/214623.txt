I return again and again to Swiss Phil's recipes and his recommendations. They all seem so good and aimed at me and the Caf√© in which I work. This is as he describes, sensually spicy, and has rapidly become a big hit. We call it Thai Prawns with Grapefruit! And when we ran out of it, I just went a bought some cooked prawns and used them with no real difference detectable.

Amazingly flavorful!!  I substituted a tablespoon or so of sweet thai chili sauce instead of the chili pepper and brown sugar.  Served with corn muffins this was a perfect supper for a hot summer evening.

Excellent! Delivers everything promised! Love it! Can use pre-packaged cooked prawns if you like. Perhaps not an authentic Thai recipe, but then the title DOES say it's Thai-style.

I made this hot and it was really easy to make.  I liked it but the rest of the family was not crazy about it and just picked out the shrimp.  It was much better cold the next day.  I like the mix of spicy and tart.

This was simple to make and very tasty to eat - so the best review wording would be "Simply brilliant". Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe because we love grapefruit/avocado salads. Sadly, this was not at all what I was expecting. I'm guessing I bought the wrong type of fish sauce (I thought it was Thai, but maybe not) because as soon as I put it on the dish smelled rank.

Love the flavor idea of this recipe but  it could use prawns that are a little more spiced. So I  would combine it with  prawns that are cooked in  a heavy  spiced brine.
The fresh  and citrus flavor from the grapefruit is excellent combined with the cilantro and a little kick from the chili. 
Try it first the way it is made here and then see how to improve on it but you may  very well like it the way it comes.

I used cayenne pepper since I didn't have the red chile pepper.  I didn't like it at first but the next day when the flavors were well blended and it was chillled, it was very good.  I will agree  with another commenter that the fish sauce    smelled pretty rank.   I was worried that I ruined the dish once i put in the fish sauce..

LOVE this! We were a little nervous of trying it because it's completely different from the kind of food that we normally eat, but I had grapefruit I needed to get rid of, and this was definitely the way to go about doing it. The only thing I changed was that I used a large red jalapeno instead of the red chile pepper, because that's what I had on hand, and 1/2 tsp of grade B maple syrup instead of brown sugar, for the same reason. I think next time around I will cut the amounts for the liquid ingredients in half and let the grapefruit drain over the sink after it's been peeled and de-membraned, because it was pretty soupy towards the bottom. Otherwise, the flavor was amazing. We will definitely be making this again!
