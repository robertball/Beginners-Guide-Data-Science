This dressing tasted better the day after it was made.  It was very nice but you need to be sure that you don't use too much as it is very tangy.  I will definately make it again.

Excellent tangy dressing for all salads! My mom and I loved it so much we ate what was left with bread. If you add sugar it makes a good coleslaw dressing too!

Very easy to make!  It's also a really pretty color when it's made.  This would be great on breads or even some vegetables.  I give it a four because I don't think it would be good on salads.  Overall, a very good dressing!

This dressing is absolutely delicious! It reminds me of the homemade tomato basil vinaigrettes you find in Italian restaurants. I didn't have fresh herbs on hand, so I used dried. Even so, it was superb. I decided to add a little drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil for the health benefits, but concerning flavor, you could totally leave it out and not miss it at all. So healthy, so tasty. Great one, Sal!

Besides being extremely lowfat low cal, this is one of the most flavorful dressing I've ever had - better than any store bought dressing I've tried.

Good stuff, and definitely tangy! I agree this tastes better if you let it refrigerate for a day. I added a splash of olive oil. Thanks!

Excellent low-fat dressing!  I put it in the blender and added horseradish and black pepper.  I will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was good, but not great. It had too much vinegar in it. I didn't put the ketchup in it, either, so it probably would've tasted better with that added.

Was full of flavor!!! I recommend adding less thyme (maybe thyme overpowered the dressing for me b/c it was ground instead of fresh?)  A quick easy way to use up tomatoes from your garden!

Alright.  I may wait and make it again in the summer when I have fresh basil & thyme as the hard bits did tend to nestle themselves in my front teeth. I did add some splenda to it, as it was far too tangy as is, and let it sit overnight before eating.

I made this because we had a ton of tomatoes to use up.  I want to be very specific that I made up the dressing and let it sit in the fridge for a few days before we actually ate it.  The dressing itself was delicious, but the tomatoes had soaked up all of the vinegar and became "vinegar bombs".  They were so terrible that we had to pull every one out of the salad.

Will definitely make again ! Used a can of diced no salt tomatoes 
(with juice), and followed directions to the letter. Next time might try a little Garlic Powder or finely diced onions ...... Easy fast and inexpensive, great combination of flavors

Love this recipe.  It is the lettuce toppings and dressings all in one.  A healthy and delicious alternative to a gooey, creamy dressing.

This is a good start. Its almost french dressing like. I used grainy mustard since thats what I had besides yellow. After it set and I tried it I did add 1 scant teaspoon of sugar because it had alot of bite. I also used dried herbs. This worked well with tomatoes from my garden and I did chop them small and mush them with the back of a spoon since my family isnt big on chunky dressings. I think this would be improved running the ingredients through the food processor to get a creamy texture. It might coat the salad better which is what I needed was to coat a big bowl of iceburg lettuce cukes and tomatoes. Thanks for sharing.

Not bad, a nice alternative to oil-based dressings. I made it in the blender along with a handful of walnuts.

I thought this was a great alternative to  dressings made with oil. I used balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, omitted the ketchup and used ground mustard instead of Dijon (it's what I had). I also blended it and refrigerated over night before eating. I used it as my dressing for my chicken salad, it was delicious!
