Easy and yummy.  We made this last week and the base custard is outstanding!  Instead of using regular half & half, I used non-fat half & half and added 2 cups of pureed peaches -- yummy peach ice cream!  We're up for chocolate this week and I think I use 1 cup of non-fat milk, 2 cups of non-fat half & half as well as 1 cup of heavy cream.  BTW, this recipe (8 servings) is 2 batches in the Cusinart ice cream machine.

This is a delicious, classic ice cream. It's incredibly creamy - heavenly on a hot, steamy, summer day. I used a scant 1/2 cup of dark cocoa powder and it was the perfect chocolate ice cream. I plan on making this again very soon with strawberries and blackberries as both are going wild right now! Thanks for a great recipe!

Wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars since you probably don't need the full cup of sugar if you're going to stir in a sweet addition.  I only used 3/4 cup sugar and added a 10 oz jar of chopped maraschino cherries and its syrup and thought the recipe came out really rich and nicely sweetened.  I also added 1/3 cup slivered almonds for a cherry nut ice cream.  It was yummy and I'll definitely use this recipe again!

I used this to make mint chip ice cream. I increased the servings to 12 because I had 12 egg yolks left from an angel food cake. I added 1 tsp. peppermint extract and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  I added one cup of chocolate chips but it could use more. Everyone loved it. I've just started making ice cream this summer.  This is the best recipe I've found - very creamy, smooth and versatile.  Exactly what I wanted!

Perfect ice cream base, easy to make and very creamy with the perfect touch of sweetness.  I recommend that the base be chilled overnight so that it cools down completely before putting it in the ice cream maker.  As a result, it reaches the soft serve level in about 25 minutes! I highly recommend this recipe--perfect for novice and expert ice cream makers alike!

This had very good flavor.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I changed it a bit - instead of 1 cup sugar, I used 1/2 cup sugar and a small box of vanill pudding. I also added a Tbsp of vanilla.  It cooked up great - hardest part was not eating it as it cooled.
Added some crushed oreos as it mixed in the ice cream maker.  Really good!

YUMMMM!  Once you try this, store bought will never be the same.  I made this exactly as specified and added 1 TBSP pure vanilla extract as suggested to make vanilla.  It was my very first time making ice cream and it was a huge success if I do say so myself.  This amount fit perfectly in a 2Qt. Cuisinart ice cream maker, and the final product all fits great in a 1.5 litre container.  Thank you so much for posting, this is frozen dessert perfection.

I haven't even frozen this yet, but I have to give it 5 stars. I was drawn to this recipe because of its simple solution to the problem with adding the egg to the warm cream. Other recipes intimidated me because of so many reviewers stating that they got little chunks of egg that they had to strain out. I really had no desire to deal with that. I'm not entirely confident that the egg yolks are thoroughly cooked, but I'm not one to be picky about that either. I did taste the warm mix before putting it in the fridge and it's fantastic! I flavored it with 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of instant coffee. It has a slightly strong coffee flavor, I would recommend just a tablespoon and a half for anyone new to the world of coffee ice cream. I plan to add Heath bars for the final product.

Made exactly as written, turned out great.  Did not have an ice cream maker, used the plastic bag method and then froze for a day to have firm custard.  Also added fresh black raspberry puree to a portion to get a different flavor.

This is so good and very easy.  I added some milk chocolate chips and about 1/2 cup cocoa powder.  I can't wait to make it again with the flavors that I want.

This is a phenomenal base recipe!  Be warned if you change the servings it doesn't update the salt amount.  We loved this recipe before it got in the fridge! The warm base itself was so good!!  

I don't know if it either of these flubs helped but we didn't put the vanilla in till after we turned off the heat.  And dear Hubs keep stirring for ten minutes after that cause I read the recipe wrong.  To rush the recipe to use the same day we put the warm base in a flat rectangular plastic storage container and put it in the deep freeze for about 2 hours.  It didn't freeze solid during that time.  

In the ice cream maker it froze relatively quickly and was so so so good!!  The texture is so smooth and creamy like no homemade I cream I've ever had before!!  I can't wait to play with this recipe some more and try new flavors, this is definitely a keeper and I will refer everyone I know to this recipe! 

And better yet at 12 serving I have enough egg whites to make an angel food cake too! :D

This was incredible. It set up so quickly and was very creamy-no ice crystals like some of the uncooked versions.

This is amazing and SO delicious.  I substituted 1 cup 1 percent milk for 1 cup of the half-and-half and it still was creamy and very rich.  I flavored it with 1/2 cup cocoa powder.  I may reduce the cocoa powder next time, but other than that, it was perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I absolutely loved this.  My husband, not so much.  However, I believe this is more because he didn't grow up with homemade ice cream.  For those of us that did, you can't beat this recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is the BEST ice cream I have tried on allrecipes! It is smooth, creamy and the vanilla version tastes like creme brulee! Even before I froze it the consistency was like that of super rich vanilla pudding. In the freezer it doesn't freeze super solid but stays scoopable. This it the only recipe I will use for ice cream from now on!

This is the best homemade ice cream base I've eaten.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I liked the sweetness of the full cup of sugar, and for flavor, I used 1 tbsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tbsp almond extract.  (The almond paired nicely with a peach dessert!  However, it was strong on the almond flavor - could add only a tsp or to taste.)  I think I have a larger ice cream freezer - we easily could have doubled this recipe, but it is true to the stated yield of 8 servings.  I just like BIG servings!  Can't wait to try it with crushed up Butterfinger candy bars mixed in!

This has a wonderful flavor. I tripled the batch since we had a surplus of eggs. I didn't use heavy cream and half-and-half. Instead, I used non-seperated, fresh milk. Figured that would work just fine. I added vanilla after it was thickened.   Since I tripled the recipe, I had 4 quarts of base. I used 2 quarts in the ice cream freezer. Here's where I had issues. I ran out of ice cubes and decided (again) to use snow. It just didn't work. The ice cream never got to that creamy, frozen, soft serve stage. It was getting fluffy, but very grainy. Froze it anyway. It has GREAT flavor. Very creamy flavor!!!! I can see using this for a variety of add-ins. I gave it only 4 stars because, while I'm sure the graininess is due to me using the snow, I'll know absolutely when I freeze the other 2 quarts, using ice cubes.

I just made this Ice Cream Base and it was easy and looks very velvety-creamy!  I will update when I decide if I'm adding a flavor/fruit.  So far so good!  I added fresh, macerated strawberries.  I put finished product into a container and froze it.  When I was ready to try it, I was surprised to find it was not too hard (like store bought) to scoop!  It was perfect and creamy!  The only adjustment I made was 1 Tablespoon of Pure Vanilla.  I made this today again July 23, 2012 and made it vanilla with shaved dark and milk chocolate.  I also put in 1/2 C. Corn syrup with the egg yolks and sugar n salt.  It helped keep it creamier as it froze solid with no type of ice crystals.  MMM very good!  This is the best "base" recipe and will recommend this to everyone!

This was my first time making homemade ice cream. I got an attachment to my kitchen-aid and I used this base. The end result was delicious but super filling. My family loved the ice cream. I put a table spoon of vanilla in and it tasted great. My only complaint was that it took a while for the mixture to thicken while I heated it.

Thickens easily. You can make it whatever you want. One of my favorites is: Baileys amaretto.

PERFECT. We added real vanilla bean to the mixture (scraped and dropped in the pod, then strained the pod out). So delicious. Thanks! 
We tried this trying to figure out what to use our yolks for after we bake an angel food cake - this will be on our list for sure!!!

One tip for those making custard, cooked ice cream bases.  Before you cook up the base, make sure you have a hand held strainer propped up on the bowl in which you are going to pour your cooked base.  It prevents accidentally scrambled eggs from becoming part of your ice cream.  This recipe is rich and delicious.  Try adding a little banana extract...wowza!!

Perfect . I cooked the cream and half & half to 160 degrees.  Then I added it to the yokes as specified and cooked it all to 160 degrees.  Followed the recipe to make vanilla and it turned out great.  Tastes a lot like a famous ice cream in Texas, only better.

This came out amazing! So creamy and perfect. I added a 1/4 cup of cocoa and a 1/4 cup of Starbucks mocha powder. I then added a tsp of vanilla. After the ice cream was in the ice cream maker for 20-25 minutes, I added mini marshmallows and bunny grahams. My whole family loved it! Thank you for the recipe.

Very good!  I was in a hurry to go somewhere, so I didn't quite let the mixture heat to the point that it was coating the back of the spoon, but as it cooled it thickened up very nicely.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was if I was supposed to add additional milk when I put it in the ice cream freezer.  I didn't and it probably made about a 1 1/2 quarts (used a 2 quart freezer).  My husband is not a huge homemade ice cream fan, but he loved this!  And since it doesn't make a whole lot, it is perfect for the two of us and another couple!

I combined this with another recipe and added 2 more cups of liquid. So I used 3 cups heavy cream and 3 cups milk. Increased the sugar to 1.5 cups. I then made kheer/kulfi ice cream. Added ground pistachios, rose water, saffron, ground cardamom to the custard. Added some chopped pistachios near the end of churning time.

I swapped out the cream and half and half with coconut milk- just the cream from the top part of the can- I did 2 cups, 4 eggs, added 3/4 cocoa powder and additional sugar- I used a bit of the coconut water in the bottom of the can to liquify the eggs/cocoa more- despite all those tweaks- it turned out great!  Oh and added a couple teaspoons vanilla.

Fantastic recipe that we make all the time. For those that are looking for more exact instructions than "coats the back of a spoon", simply heat the custard (SLOWLY) to 160-165F.  Trust me I've tried to rush it and made scrambled eggs. If you do want to save a little time, I've successfully tossed everything in the pot at once (vs creaming the yolks and sugar and tempering first) and slowly heated. Constant stirring is also key.

I honestly messed up and I overheated my base.  I cooled it and threw it in the food processor and viola, it became perfect again.  I also added vanilla.  I split the batch, cookies and cream and half of a box of strawberries in the fridge that I threw in the food processor and pulsed a bit with a tiny bit of sugar.  So cookies and cream and strawberry ice cream.  This base is so fantastic, trust it.  I am a great cook and was afraid of ice cream, never had a good recipe.  Try this, and even if you mess up like me, it will still be fabulous.

This is a great homemade ice cream recipe. I just made it with the suggested tsp of vanilla to have with a red velvet cake.  In all honesty, it tasted very much like the Bluebell Homemade Vanilla, which I also LOVE. I look forward to making it again and trying other flavors!

I did not chill the custard overnight like the recipe said.  I chilled it for 4 hours.  I had read similar recipes which only required 4 hrs.  It turned out great.  I will try chilling it overnight and see if there is a significant difference though.

I concur - this is a wonderful rich creamy ice cream.  I added a vanilla bean to the half and half and cream mixture while it was cooking and let it steep about 30 additional minutes.

I added a whole vanilla bean to the warm milk mixture. It was delicious!  We made 2 batches, 1 with the plain vanilla and the other one we added fresh peaches.

A very good basic vanilla ice-cream. I was concerned about egg flavour so I only used 5 eggs yolks (also partly because I was also baking a white cake that called for 5 egg whites!) I had mistakenly purchased whole milk instead of half and half but it still had a creamy, custardy texture. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Fantastic base for just about any type of ice cream you would like to make.  I followed anther reviewers advised and added marachino cherries. I did have a slight problem in that once I had added all that base, the additional liquid in the cherries overflowed and made a mess but that did not hurt the flavor at all.

It took a couple of tries to get it right, I think I was overcooking it & most of liquid was evaporating, but it is good if you have time & want really good creamy ice cream!! I prefer this over the refrigerate recipes any day!

I have used this recipe for years since finding it on All Recipes. I just made again. I tripled the recipe. I change nothing. We always make vanilla ice cream and hands down it’s way better than any store bought or restaurant ice cream. Amazing taste and it’s super easy to make.

I have made this many times. 
It takes 2 batches for a 4 quart ice cream maker.
It stays soft when completely frozen.
I have made black raspberry,  pineapple, strawberry and banana...all were great.

Really a simple base that you can add your own character to. Agree with a few reviews that it is a bit eggy and also way too much sugar. I used 3/4 cup and its still too sweet for us but tasty like a frozen custard.

It made a delicious base for fresh peach ice cream.  I halved the recipe, using only 3 yolks.  ( I had 3  that I needed to use up).  I pureed 1/2 peach with a small amount of brown sugar.  At the end of the churning cycle I added the other half of the peach, diced and mixed with a squeese of lemon juice and and about 1 T of almond syrup.  Came out great, and held it's creamy texture after freezing firm.

Very easy recipe to follow, especially if making an ice cream base isn't something that you've done before. This makes the best homemade ice cream, in my opinion.

I forgot to add the eggs to the cream in three batches to temper the eggs.  Rather than throw it all all, I just slowly brought the whole mixture to temp (about 12 minutes) on a medium warm burner.  It turned out fine.   

The recipe itself was delicious and I would make it again.

What a great recipe. The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup of cocoa to the sugar, then whipping the eggs and sugar mixture together. After it was in the ice cream machine for about 10 minutes I added 1 cup of dark chocolate chips. The end result was like a frozen French Silk Pie. I will make it again.

I have made this eight times - only chocolate flavor - and it comes out perfect each time. I use the microwave to heat the cream so I don't scorch it, and cook the custard in my Vitamix - keeps the custard from needing to be strained if it gets lumpy, and reduces the number of items to be washed! I reduce the sugar by half, it's still plenty sweet. I have also been short on Half and Half, and substituted heavy cream for one cup (equal parts heavy cream and half-and-half) and it made no difference in the flavor or texture. Very easy recipe to tweek without ruining the result!!

This recipe is delicious.  I added about 2 cups of 2% milk since it didn’t make that much.  It was perfect after thinning it out a tad with extra milk.

First time making ice cream and I must say I will be using this as a base from now on! Ice cream came out so creamy and I loved how I can add whatever ingredients I desire. For mine I melted in some dark chocolate (about 4 or 5 squares worth) with the heavy whipping cream and half and half. I also added 4 or 5 tablespoons of maraschino cherry juice and threw some cherries in as well. After being stored over night I cut up some more dark chocolate and added it to the mix. I must say it was delicious and probably one of the best ice creams I’ve had ever.

Made exactly as written.  This made about half of a regular ice cream freezer using rock salt and ice. I will double if using that again.  Seems to be just right for a tabletop Cusinart electric freezer.  Excellent base.  Can't wait to experiment with flavors. Big hit with family!

This came together well, but the texture was more of a frozen custard--thicker, richer. Only substitution was to use a real vanilla bean. The family enjoyed it, but not our favorite.

This turned out wonderful.  I did the vanilla and it is yummy.  Make sure your maker or churn has enough ice and salt in the water to make it cold enough.

I made this again today, and I mixed in a 21 oz can of peach fruit filling and topping.  Peaches and Cream.  I love this recipe.  I've never been a real fan of non chocolate ice cream till I discovered this.

This was excellent! I've been looking for a great base recipe and I think I found it! For my first batch, I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract and a chopped up ghiradelli peppermint bark bar. Look forward to experimenting with flavors this summer!

I have been trying to find a good ice cream base that stays creamy after putting in the freezer. I just put it in the freezer so the test is still on going but I did change it up a little bit. I used 2 cups each of the cream and half and half instead of the 1 and 3 cups. I like a creamy ice cream. The ice cream I put in the freezer was really good. I added some vanilla bean insides to it along with vanilla extract. Love it.

Excellent recipt. Very rich. Made one addition. Used two cups of heavy cream and two cups of half and half. I didn't realize until too late that this recipe is are most of them designed for the small freezers. If you have a 4, 5, or 6 quart freezer you will need to adjust the ingredients. Would make again.

I used this recipe to make strawberry Ice cream.  I hadn't made a custard based recipe in a long time and now I don't think i'll ever go back to the alternatives.  Family and neighbors could not believe how good this was.  This is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely wonderful. I made a simple vanilla ice cream, and it took about 25 minutes to churn. This base is so rich and creamy, yum! It was gone in a matter of minutes. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this for the first time! Very easy. I did adjust to the 10 servings just to use rest of cream. It tastes really yummy. Letting it cool now the in fridge over night. Also, I just kept the sugar at 1cup instead of 11/4c, after reading other comments. I'm excited to finish it tomorrow!

I think it could have done with less sugar, maybe 3/4 or 4/5 of a cup, but it is a great simple base. I think next time I might do 2 parts each of heavy cream and half and half and add other ingredients.

This tastes YUMMY.  I reduced my sugar to a little less than 3/4 cups, and I added: a little more than 1/4 cup honey, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  Kids approve!!!

I would definitely recommend, while stirring the entire mixture for 5-8 minutes, that you also take a heat-resistant spatula and scrape it along the bottom corners of your pot, to avoid egg-iness.

Delicious! Followed instructions exactly, with excellent results my first try. I often make little tweaks here & there to recipes. Not with this one--it's perfect & very easy! I've tried vanilla & banana. I will add more banana next time. My entire family raved about it & now they're all complaining, "who ate all the ice cream?!" I have a list of flavors to try. Btw I snuck tastes during the entire process, it's delicious at all stages. The flavor is fullest when going the full length of the recipe, however I doubt there would be any complaints eating it soft serve right out of the machine!

Great recipe. If you add cookies, make sure you add them at the end of the ice cream making cycle. The ice cream was a funny dirty color but the taste was still amazing! I will use this base recipe for all my ice cream recipes in the future!!Love it !!!

I made this ice cream over the weekend, following the exact recipe with the noted addition of vanilla extract.  This is a VERY rich ice cream.  I'm giving this four stars instead of five because it is much too rich for my taste.  I'll make it again and modify the recipe by replacing one of the cups of half and half with milk.  If you are into extremely rich ice cream, don't modify at all!!

Creamy! My favorite ice cream recipe now. I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half and half for extra creaminess. WOW!!

I never tried making ice cream before but have chickens and pheasants so have plenty of eggs.  Use twice the amount of pheasant egg yolks since they are smaller.  Added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and then used the "no machine" method.  It worked great and tasted better.  We started making it at about 1p in the afternoon and it was ready by 7p for dessert after dinner.

Okay, it's been just about two hours since I put this delicious bundle in the freezer and I just snuck a few bites. Wow!! This is the best ice cream I've ever made! This base is wonderful. I added butterscotch fudge and chocolate fudge pieces a few minutes before I was done mixing. (The clostest recipe I've found to mine is Aunt Teen's Fudge Recipe on this site... obviously, for the butterscotch, I just substitute the chocolate chips for 3C of butterscotch chips.) Admittedly, I added a lot and the concoction was nearly spilling out of my kitchenaid! :) But the small mess was oh so worth it!!!!!  Thank you Autumn Pumpkin for posting this custard ice cream base! My tummy is SO happy!

I made this last weekend.  It sounded like the one my Uncle Joe use to make and it tasted like it too.  I was go happy with it.  Next time I am adding bananas and pecans.  I can't wait.  Easy to do and was so great.

This is amazing!!! Very creamy and dangerous because I have to keep reminding myself not to have more then I should. 
It's a sin!!! 
It was my first time making ice cream and I'm so happy that I found the right recipe otherwise I might not have succeeded. 
Thank you so much for sharing it.

I halved the recipe and used all half and half instead of heavy cream and half and half. The recipe came out delish!! I also added chocolate, bananas and oreos, so yummy! I do think there is a touch too much sugar in the recipe but it was still fantastic. Thanks for posting!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was heaven.  I like the custard best before freezing.  But I did save some of the custard to make ice cream and added 1 1/2 ripe banana during the freezing process.  Yum!
