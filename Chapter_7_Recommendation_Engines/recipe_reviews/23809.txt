My family thought tonight's homemade pizza was awesome...I will make again, although, I did make a few changes...I used 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 egg (not two) and added 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1 1/2 tbsp baking powder, 1 1/2 tbsp cold water and 1 tbsp basil. The baking powder made the dough rise just a bit more than it would have otherwise and my advice - use the herbs you love to add some flavour. All in all, baked into a lovely crust.

I thought this was a great yeast-less, homemade crust. I made a few substitutions and followed some of the recommendations and was really pleased with how it turned out. First, I used whole-wheat flour and added at least another 1/2-1 cup to the recipe so it was more firm and less moist. I omitted the second egg, added 1 tsp baking poweder, put in about 1-2 Tbsp. Italian seasoning, then pressed into a well-greased 11 x 13 baking sheet. I only needed to cook it for about 8 mins, then pulled it out and spread olive oil on top; then topped with tomato sauce, mozarella cheese, mushrooms, onions, fresh garlic and basil, tomatoes, green bell pepper, and olives. I then popped it in the oven again but used the broiler instead since my crust was already cooked enough and I was afraid I'd burn it. I might try cooking the crust for 5 or 6 mins next time, then add my toppings, then cook for about 8-10 mins at 400 next time to see how that goes. The crust was thin but sturdy...held all the toppings really well and had a great flavor. My hubby really liked it and both kids gobbled it up. A great, healthy alternative to traditional pizza crust. I'll definitely be making this again!

FYI...definitely follow the recommendations of adding more flour, omit the second egg, and add baking powder. The original recipe does seem to be a little moist. Oh, and don't forget to spray your pan...otherwise you'll be scraping it out of the pan.

I used one egg, as others had suggested and also baked the crust for 10 minutes before adding toppings then an additional 10 minutes.  I did not have oregano on hand, so I used Italian seasoning and it was very tasty.  I had no problem with the crust sticking to the pan...I sprayed it well with butter spray and also sprinkled the pan with cornmeal.  This is the perfect no yeast crust!

I would have called it flat bread rather than pizza dough. It tasted terrific. I made the following additions: I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour, I baked it for 10 min w/out any toppings, I coated my baking stone with lots of Crisco Olive Oil spray (it didn't stick at all). I added crushed red pepper, lots of garlic powder, onion powder and pepper to the crust. After it cooled I topped it with a mixture of olive oil and 5 pressed cloves of garlic. Then came the colby/jack cheese, thinly sliced tomato, thinly sliced onion and thinly sliced mushrooms. I cut a chicken breast into bite sized pieces and sauteed it in olive oil and pressed garlic (2 cloves) until done. Then I used my Pampered Chef chopper to chop it into tiny little pieces and added that to the toppings. I then baked it at 400 for another 12 minutes. No sticking, no bad or bland flavor, no burning, nothing wrong at all. This recipe is wonderful and I'll be making this again with other fun toppings. But I call it flat bread, not pizza crust. Enjoy!!

Good pizza crust in a pinch when you don't have yeast.  I will make it again but will only use 1 egg (it tasted a bit like an omelette with pizza toppings :)).  Also, we were only using cheese so I baked it by itself for ~15 minutes in the preheated oven, then turned it over and put on the toppings.  Baking it longer would have probably burned the crust.  It did stick but only in one place so I probably just didn't evenly spray the pan.  The dough is very batter like before you cook it, but bakes up nicely.  Note; if you are making this, don't expect it to be like a store bought or restaurant pizza crust.  It's good in its own right but doesn't have the yeasty taste or feel of yeast raised crusts (obviously :)).  My husband loved it and might even prefer it over the typical pizza crust.

I never made homemade pizza because I didn't like to deal with yeast, so this is great.  I've made it more than a dozen times now, and get a request for it at least once a week.  I make a triple batch (with 4 eggs), and use two large insulated cookie sheets.  Cook for 12 minutes, then flip over and spread with tomato paste.  My 3-year-old handles all the other toppings.  Then back in the oven until the cheese starts to brown.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

If you like thin crust, and don't like to mess with yeast dough, you've got to try this!!!  I added some garlic powder and italian seasoning & did prebake it for about 10 minutes (it was amazing the way it formed "sides")  I used an 11 X 15 cookie sheet.  Thanks for a great recipe!

If you are looking for a deep-dish pepperoni pizza crust recipe, this is NOT the recipe for you.  That being said, I made this (minus one egg as per pervious reviews) and thought it was fabulous.  I topped it with leftover grilled chicken, sundried tomatoes, feta cheese.  I baked it for 15 mintes and added mozz and parm cheeses.  I used a jelly roll pan and spread it with a spoon sprayed with Pam.  This crust was thin and crisp and perfect.  I will use this recipe for my BBQ chicken and Hot wing pizza recipes also - Thanks for this great and fast recipe!

I made this by the recipe and it was fresh and made me wonder why I buy the 5.00 pizzas.  I look forward to trying different herbs and cheeses in the dough.

I thought this crust was quite good.  I cooked the crust alone for about 12 minutes before adding anything to it, made a nice thin crust.  Also, it's important not to overload the crust or it will be soggy.  I use 1 cup pizza sauce and 1 cup cheese.  Came out delicious.

This recipe makes the most amazing gluten-free pizza crust!  As soon a I saw it was egg-based, I wanted to try it.  I cut the recipe in half because it was just for me.  I made it using a flour combination of 3 parts brown rice flour, 2 parts potato/corn starch, 2 part refined corn flour, and 1 part garbonzo/fava bean flour, and I added 1 1/2 tsp guar gum. For seasonings I used just a pinch of black truffle salt (yum!) instead of the 1/2 tsp salt it calls for, garlic powder, basil, freshly ground black pepper, and red pepper flakes. I DID use the the full amount of egg the recipe calls for.  When it comes to gluten free, extra egg=extra good.  I used Almond Breeze instead of milk because of dairy intolerance. I cooked my half-batch in a glass pie pan and it fit perfectly.  As others have mentioned, I baked the crust alone for about 10-12 mintutes, added the toppings, then cooked it about another 1-10 minutes. I used red sauce, mozzarella, and pepper-jack.  For a topping I re-fried some black beans in a pan with a little canola oil and lots of chili powder, taco seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, and other seasonings.  It was amazing! My husband tried making it the regular way (not gluten free).  He said his was ok, but mine was better.  So this recipe works BETTER for gluten free than it does for normal wheat flour!  That doesn't happen often!

The first time I followed the directions exactly and although it was pretty good it was not exactly what I wanted so I tweaked it a bit. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 tsp of baking powder and then omitted one egg. I followed the rest of the recipe and I used a pizza pan with the holes in the bottom...you can get them at most department stores. WOW what a difference. I cooked the batter for ten minutes then added some chopped jalapenos, mottzo cheese and tomato sauce then I popped it under the broiler til the cheese was melted. It slid right off the pan unto the serving dish and sliced up crunchy on the outside and tasty on the inside. A much healthier alternative to white flour pizza. I see not reason to every use a yeast crust again. I think the secret was the pan with the holes in the bottom...the whole pizza was done all the way through and crunchy on the outside. This is my keeper recipe...I am going to try it as a breakfast pizza next time I have company. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

Awesome recipe! (But, I made this as bread to go along w/ pasta - not pizza). I used 1 1/2 c. flour and added in 1 1/2 T. baking soda, 1 1/2 T. cold water, 1 T. olive oil, and a lot of different herbs. I used a glass, 9x13 dish (which I sprayed w/ olive oil) and baked for 15 minutes. It baked it pretty fluffy and pulled away from the sides of the dish - and did not stick at all. It is a lot like foccacia bread this way.

Best pizza dough ever! My family said it was the best pizza I had made yet. I only added one egg and I upped my flour by 1/4 cup not half. Super easy and quick. Also I pre-baked the pizza for 10 min before adding any toppings then I turned the oven up to 475 and baked with the toppings for another 10 min, this made the pizza bubbly and perfect. This is a keeper, my husband told me not to lose this recipe. Thanks :)

Very good!  My husband hates homemade pizza crust and he loved this!  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to it because we love garlic, and followed the suggestion of only using one egg.  This made it a thin crust, but tasted amazing.  I might try 2 eggs next time because of my own curiousity, but I will definitely make this again and again.

If I could give a negative mark for this recipe, I would.  The crust stuck --no, it became part of the pan, could not get it off, we picked off the cheese and ate it alone!!  Awful recipe !To say to oil the pan is not enough, really oil it, OR YOU WILL NEVER GET THE CRUST OFF OF THE PAN!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I did not use it for pizza.  I removed the dough from the oven a little early before it became crispy.  I used the dough as a wrap with garlic and caramelized onions and sauteed chicken.

This recipe worked really well for me. It had a nice bready, chewy texture. I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour and threw in 1/2 tsp. of baking powder like others suggested. For half of the dough, I used a medium sized muffin tin to get little bite sized pizzas- it would work great for appetizers. Or dessert pizza too, if instead you spread melted butter and cinnamon-sugar on the tops and drizzle it with vanilla icing :) MmMm...

Like many others, I was in desperate need of a pizza crust dough that didn't require yeast.  I loved it!  I can understand how other folks may not like the chewyness of it, but I thought it was great.  I added a lot of garlic powder and black pepper to it.  I used turkey pepperoni, turkey bacon, onions, mushrooms, black olives, and jalepenos,  along with shredded colbyjack, feta, and parmesan cheeses.  I put the noncheese toppings on first and let it go 25 minutes, and then another 10 minutes to melt the cheese.  Soooo awesome, I will definately use this recipe again!

Great pizza for a quick nite's meal. Here's what I do differently: I use a cast iron skillet (large one) instead of a baking sheet or pizza pan. The cast iron bakes the crust evenly ...just add your sause and cheese at the end to heat and melt the cheese. Turns out great every time.

it was ok. It did in a pinch. I used 1 egg like most reviewers suggested. I can't imagine it having another egg in it. I'm going to try again, next time i'm going to spread the dough out on a baking sheet as thin as i can get it to see if that help. (update) I cut this recipe in half and spread it out really thin (almost see through) on a insulated baking sheet. It came out alot better then my last attempt. I fully baked it then put the toppings on and just waited for the cheese to melt and warm toppings. I've made it at least twice last week.

My family truly enjoyed this recipe after I doctored it up a little bit.  Just pre-bake the crust about 10 min. The crust was thin and crispy on the edge and slightly chewy in the center as long as you don't overdo the sauce.  It was a delightful change from the everyday crust.  Great recipe!!

Tried it out just looking for something new. I only added one egg and substituted my own spices, but it turned out great!

Giving this 5 stars based on what this dough is supposed to be, and that is a crust without yeast.  It was better than I expected, since there is no yeast.  After reading other reviews, I decided to omit 1 egg, added extra flour, garlic and basil.  I PRESSED this out making it a very thin crust and I am completely happy with the results.  I doubled the recipe, and baked the second crust for 20 minutes, then froze it for a later date, where all I had to do was add the toppings to the frozen crust and voila! pizza ready in minutes.  Thanks for sharing

i've made this recipe twice, so far.  using the other comments for help, both times i've used only one egg, added a T. baking powder, and a T. olive oil.  the first time i increased the flour to 1.5 c. -this made a batter too stiff to pour, too sticky to roll, but tasted good.  BAKE LIGHTLY BEFORE TOPPING.

the 2nd time i used only 1 c. flour -this pour-able batter was easier to work with.  after tilting it evenly around the pan i baked for 10 minutes, removed and cooled enough to handle, then flipped the whole thing over in the pan, added my sauce and toppings and baked again just long enough to melt my cheese.  this produced a nice cracker-crisp thin crust without any unwanted "omelet" taste or texture.

be sure to add plenty of your favorite dried pizza herbs to your dry batter ingredients, and you can stir in parmesan cheese instead of the salt too.

good if you want thin-n-crispy crust without using yeast.

We are absolutely addicted to this recipe. You can easily make it gluten free with rice flour and substitute water for milk. I love using garlic cloves and other veggies for a unique twist on pizza. Just make sure that you brown it well on the first baking or the crust may be a little soggy.

LOVED this dough! I did only use one egg and I baked it on my pizza stone (liberally oiled and a sprinkling of cornmeal). Perfect and SO easy. Definitely will become my regular dough.

I chose to use this recipe because it didnt require yeast. I was skeptical because it was batter-like consistency. The crust had no taste at all and the toppings sunk to the bottom.

The dough was too thin and hard to shape, so I kept all the ingredients the same except I reduced the milk to a half cup and used 1 egg. It was a lot easier to shape that way. But I like how simple and easy this recipe is-AND it doesn't require yeast!

This dough was so easy to make, and my kids loved having this pizza for lunch today.  My only minor problem was 2 unsightly air bubbles that appeared during the first bake. I popped them and smashed them down before putting on the sauce and cheese, and in the end, they were undetectable.  This is so quick, easy, and versatile with the toppings, I know I will be making it again.

It was good, but I had to add a bit of extra flour, so it only gets 4 stars. Very simple though!!

I made this with one egg (instead of two) as many of the other reviews suggested.  It was fluffy, didn't stick, had a great texture, and tasted great!  The flecks of oregano also looked great! I would definitely reccommend it!

Maybe I made a mistake somewhere but I didn't care for it. My boyfriend liked it, hence the 3 stars. Made mine into little pizzas and presentation was good. I thought the pie dough itself was very rubbery and unappealing. I had a topping of ham, pineapple, and alot of cheese. Probably won't be making again.

It's pretty good. I made it as written, but found there was too much flavor of the egg for myself. Made it again, since it's super easy:) with one egg and 1 Tbsp. olive oil. I liked it much better. I added red pepper flakes and chopped garlic which was great with the peanut thai topping I added. I will use this dough recipe again. I really appreciate how quick and easy it is. Thanks, Karen

This also makes incredible bread sticks!! Better than most restaurants! Just bake till dought is set, run your pizza cutter through to slice then put back in the oven till finished and golden brown. Add some garlic and shredded mozzerella or grated parmesian for extremely great and easy breadsticks!

Have made this several times.  Great and quick pizza crust recipe, added garlic powder and a bit of oregano for flavor.  I always (as others suggested) bake for 10mins then add the sauce and cheese and bake for an additional 10.  Next time I will see how well the crust handles being stuffed with cheese.  Make sure that you keep your fingers floured while pressing this out otherwise you will just end up with sticky fingers and a awkward shaped crust.

This recipe saved the day!  I promised my 2 year old that we'd make pizza tonight but the package dough mix I bought didn't turn out.  I tossed it and had to find something else that would work in a pinch and be quick.  This did the trick!

I only used one egg like others suggested.  Since our only toppings were going to be sauce, cheese and pineapple, I baked the crust plain first until it wasn't mushy, then added all the toppings and baked another 10 minutes.  

It was good!  I'm so glad I found this recipe or we would have had to heat a frozen pizza instead.

after reading the mixed reviews I was afraid to try this one.  I am soooo glad I did!  Be advised this is not a "dough".  It is more like a foudation for you to put pizza toppings on.  I also used 1 egg and used 3/4 c regular flour and 1/4 c. wheat flour.  I added onion & garlic powder, dried oregano, basil and a pinch of rosemary.  I let it rest for 10 minutes after mixing.  I buttered a 11X13 flat  metal roasting pan and then I sprayed it with olive oil.  I poured in the batter and cooked for 10 minutes.  I removed it from the oven, sprayed with olive oil and sprinked with Asiago cheese. Returned it to the oven for 10 more mins.  I took it out again, topped with sauce, mozz cheese, chopped green pepper, cubed ham and pineapple.  Back into the oven for about 8 more minutes.  When it was done I was able to lift the whole thing right out of the pan with 2 spatulas to a cutting board. It did not stick AT ALL!  The crust was very thin, like a pita or a tortilla and the toppings do soften it up.  The outer pieces were crisper than the center and the edges were "cracker like" in crispness.  We thought it had good flavor and my kids loved it.  Be careful not to use too much sauce or wet toppings if you are concerned about a soggy bottom. We did eat the center pieces with a fork. Overall it was so easy to make, very versitile and pretty tasty.  Try it with an open mind and I think you will be surprised!  Will make again with other topping like a mexican pizza.

this crust was delicious! I love how fast and easy it was. I did add one 1/2 cup of flour as well as 1 tsp baking powder and left out one egg as per suggested in the reviews. It was perfect! Even after I had forgotten to bake the crust a little before adding the toppings. I will make this again.

I followed the recommendations.  I added another cup of flour and added 1 tsp of baking powder, but kept the second egg. 
I also used garlic pepper seasoning and about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper since those were the spices I just happened to have (no oregano).  I baked at 400 for about 3 minutes then added olive oil to the top.  Continued baking for an additional 8 minutes.  Then added my tomato paste, tomatoes, olives, broccoli and cheese.  Baked for another 10 minutes then broiled until the cheese was bubbling.
I was pleasantly surprised that the crust was not doughy or too crusty.  If I would have baked it any longer though, I think it would have been over done.
Great easy choice for a throw-together dinner!

This is a great recipe.  After reading the reviews, the recipe does need some tweaking.  I used 2 cups of flour and only one egg, because it really was too liquidy.  I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, and then added a little garlic powder as well (1 teaspoon) I also used 2 tablespoons of Baking Powder. I put olive oil on top of the dough after it was rolled out added fresh garlic on top before putting it in the oven for 8 minutes.  After 8 minutes I took it out and added the pizza sauce and toppings.  Cooked it for another 12 minutes, and whooola!  The crust was crispy the rest was perfect.  I use a pizza stone, also.

I made this recipe as it was posted.  The only thing I did differently was to put it in a 9x13 baking dish since my cookie pan was otherwise occupied.  I baked it for 15 min then put on my hawaiian pizza toppings and extra cheese then baked for another 15 min.  My husband and I ate the whole thing for dinner.  Will definitely make this again!

Delicious and simple! I followed the advice of other reviewers, and only used 1 egg. I also added crushed red pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to the mix. I baked the crust for about 10 minutes, then brushed some olive oil onto the top of the crust before flipping it over and adding the toppings. Then I packed for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the cheese browned. Very good! Will definitely be making again =)

Not too bad, makes sure to bake long enough, use baking soda for some fluffiness.

Ok, so I really want to like this recipe, I mean I really want to, especially because me and yeast do not get along to well. But even with all the suggested modifications, increasing flour, 1 egg, baking powder, etc, I found this to be spongy, dense, and overall nothing like what a pizza crust should taste like. Dang it, I will give it two stars for no yeast and ease of on hand ingredients, but sorry to say it is not a pizza crust.

This was a simple, easy Supper recipe!  My child is lactose intolerance and I'm trying to lower my cholesterol along with lose weight.  So, the take out pizza is out of the question.  Why have I been getting pizza for so long from a restaurant or the frozen food section?  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use 1 1/2 C. of flour and 1 egg.  In order to lower the cholesterol value, I'm going to use Egg Beaters next time and I'm going to try to use whole wheat flour as well.  I also added garlic and onion powder to the pizza dough.  My little one got soy cheese on his part of the pizza and Daddy along with Mommy had italian cheese on our part of the pizza.  I don't want to mess with yeast and measuring water temperature so this recipe caught my attention.  The crust was a mixture between a hand tossed and thin and crispy crust which is just perfect for me.  I know pizza dough is more convenient, but this was I can customize the dough according to our needs.  Thanks allrecipes.com!

was not crazy about this..it did work because I had no yeast but it was doughy even tho I cooked it ahead of time on a hot pizza stone...I physically had to take slices & put them in a skillet to crisp up the bottoms. The taste was just kinda off for me, but my bf seemed to like it ok.

I followed the recipe exact, only using a mix of half AP/half whole wheat flour. This was quick and easy for sure, but I don't think I'd use it again. The kids didn't really care as it was pizza, but the grownups didn't care for it. There's nothing wrong with it, I think we just like a yeast-y crust.

Add me to the list of the disappointed.  Although I didn't think it was bad, it also was not that great. I'll keep searching but thanks for sharing the recipe anyway.

This crust did not work out for me.  I followed the recipe directly, and cooked it for twenty minutes.  I took it out, spread a white sauce on the top, added cheddar cheese, and baked it for ten more minutes.  It seemed to rise well, although, after taking it out of the oven, it completely sunk. It also sticks terribly. The taste was great, but it did not rise and it sticks to the pan!

I tried to prepare the crust following the exact recipe.  When I was done preparing it, it looked very runny.  After reading some of the reviews I added a cup more flour.  The flavor was there but the crust was really rubbery.  I will not make this crust again.

Loved this!!  Was so easy I love to make pizza with no sauce and this went great with it.  First time I made it I only did half the recipe to try it out on a pie pan.  My kids ate it in a heart beat.  Only changes I made was I put garlic salt and Italian Seasoning.  Turned out great I will make this over and over again best and easiest crust I have ever made.

Not your typical pizza crust. i would suggest adding more flour to make it so you can form the crust how you like. but it was too flat and not how my past pizzas have been. i wont use this again. :(

My 8 yr old daughter had a friend over and they wanted to make home made pizza - crust and all.  This recipe was great!  Quick and easy and we all loved it.  I did follow the suggestions of others and only used one egg and added garlic powder and italian seasoning.  This recipe is definitly a keeper!  Thanks for sharing it.

This was awesome! I only used one egg, added a ton of spices to the dough and made sure to grease the pan very well before slathering on the dough. I'd recommend taking a fork and stabbing some holes in the crust once it gets going. I also baked it for about 20 minutes before adding the toppings and cooking my pizza. I topped it with pizza sauce (from scratch), ham, onions, olives, tomatoes, and avocados which had been soaked with lemon + 4 cheeses on top = Fantastic

This wasn't really dough, it was runny, and then after I baked it, it was really soggy in the middle and doughy. I ended up following another recipe.

I reduced the egg but otherwise left the recipe as it was written.  The whole idea of it is that it's a pourable pizza crust (super easy and quick!) so it didn't make sense to add a bunch of flour and baking soda and roll it out, even if that does work.  I doubled the recipe (but still only used 2 eggs) and poured it into well greased cast iron pans and baked empty for 20 minutes.  Then I topped one with black olives and homemade pizza sauce and cheese for the kids and spread the other with homemade pesto sauce and then piles of sauteed onions and red and yellow peppers and pizza cheeses.  I baked another 10 minutes and then broiled them for a couple of minutes to really melt and brown the top.  Both pizzas were delicious (especially the pesto one!).  The crust was a little thick and doughy but fully cooked.  Having lots of oil in the pan helped it crisp up nicely. It bubbled up in one pan a few times as it was cooking so I pierced it with a steak knife to let the air out.  Considering other pizza dough recipes need up to an hour for prep work, rising, rolling and so on and this takes literally a MINUTE to whip up and pour in a pan, I'll definitely be making this again. All four kids, hubby and I all liked this recipe.

Yum!  I used this recipe exactly - except I used one egg, added garlic and onion powders.  I have the perfect piece of pottery that this runny batter fits into... I baked it, then used Aldi's Spinach dip as a base sauce, added sliced up artichoke hearts, sauteed chicken, caramelized onions and garlic, a little sauteed spinach and topped with some mozzarella cheese... big hit in my house!

I made the crust exactly as stated. I don't think I would change anything next time except cook it 5 minutes longer on the lower rack. This seemed to help with any sticking issues. I also used a nonstick cookie sheet so it was extra thin and crispy like we like it. I will make this anytime kids want pizza and I am out of yeast. No one said anything about it being different; they were all too busy eating.

I cannot believe how amazing this recipe turned out to be! I did make a few changes: only used one egg, and about 1 1/2 cups of flour. I also knead the dough before pressing it into the pan...turned out great! Super easy, only took about 30 minutes, yet i would suggest cooking the dough a little longer before you put the toppings on. Otherwise, i will definitely be using this recipe again!

Good for when you want a thin crust and are in a hurry. I made exactly as stated, making a breakfast pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, cheese and gravy. I put all the veggies on the raw dough, threw it in the oven for 25 minutes, then topped with sausage, gravy and cheese and cooked for another 10 minutes. Pretty good! Oh and I used bread flour instead of all-purpose.

This recipe was not only a hit with my family but my girl's youth group as well.  I followed some of the suggestions such as substituting Italian seasoning, adding 1 tblspoon olive oil, and 1-2 tsp baking powder.  I purchased 6-inch square tin pans at the dollar store and we made individual pizzas at one of our meetings. The girls had fun preparing their own personal pan pizza with all the fixin's. Just a note to the cooking time. We pressed the dough into the pans and cooked the dough at 400* for about 6 minutes.  We took the pans from the oven, brused with a little olive oil, added spaghetti sauce then cheese and topped with favorite pizza items such as pepperoni, canadian bacon, olives, peppers, pineapple, etc.  We placed the tin pans back in the oven to cook for about 12-15 minutes depending on the amount of cheese and toppings.  Some liked their cheese a little more crispy than others. All in all, we had a great time preparing pizzas and a great time eating them as well. Definitely a recipe I will use over and over again.

I tried this with a few tweaks after reading through the reviews. I increased the flour to 1.5 cups, decreased the egg to only 1 egg, added 1.5 tbsp of baking powder. I baked the dough for 10 minutes at 400 degrees before adding some toppings (some cooked chicken, tomato, onion, green pepper, black olives, mozza and feta on top of a bit of pizza sauce) and we were really impressed with this. Again, this is not traditional pizza dough, it is much more like a flatbread but really good like this!!
I will definitely make again.

crazy is right... if i could give 0 stars for any recipe, this would be it. i followed the recipe to the t, not only was the "crust" thinner than a tortila, it bubbled 2 inches across the entire tray. it was so crisp, when i tried to flip it, it cracked in two. i tried a pinch to judge the taste, all i have to say is over cooked omlet. absolutely the biggest disappointment i have ever seen in all my years in the kitchen. god bless those of you who gave a positive review, but i just cannot for the life of me understand how mine came out so terrible!

As noted by others, this is not regular pizza crust.  However, it is home made pizza crust without yeast and waiting two hours to rise and such.  AND it's tasty.  Since some previous reviews complained of lack of flavor, I added extra oregano, some basil, a litte parsley, garlic powder and extra salt.  I also added a tiny bit of leavening, but that may have contributed to the rather large bubbles that I had to pop and flatten a few minutes in to cooking.  Also, cook times were shorter for me than noted (although my oven temp gage is admittedly wonky).  Getting the right balance of eggs/liquid to flour took a little tweaking, but that's not uncommon with quick breads, which is essentially what this is.

I'm not much of a cook, but a few nights ago, it was 2 in the morning and my hubby was working from home so I decided to treat him to some pizza.  I had no yeast handy, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and went with 1 egg.  I added tons of herbs, and added tomato paste w/ a little vinegar, olive oil, cheese, and garlic to the top after it was in the oven for about 15m, and then baked it some more. It turned out really really delicious, and my hubby loved it.  I will definitely make it again, and next time probably add some baking powder to see if it'll make it slightly puffier or lighter... and next time I'll also try to remember to beat the egg lol.  I prefer thin crusts and this definitely satisfied that craving.

This was great.  I love allrecipes, where else can you find exactly what you are looking for?  I wanted to make pizza, but had no yeast, and this was perfect.  I followed other's advice and only used one egg, and it turned out great.  Thank you so much for a good idea that I will use again and again.

Fabulous! One time I made it I completely put it together with sauce , toppings and cheese, resulting in it being soggy. So follow the recipe and cook first without the added moisture! I use a stone baking sheet with sides (bar pan) and it never sticks even without extra oiling. Good quality bakeware makes all the difference.

My husband and son really liked this recipe, I thought it was ok. It's a great recipe if you want pizza but don't have all the things you need to make the dough. It of course doesn't turn out to be like pizza dough (bread like) but it was good otherwise.

This is such a quick, simple and funky recipe!! My mom and I tried this recipe while we were in a rush, and we were having a lot of fun, watching it cook in the oven! The edges/crust rises up and curves over. It's really quite neat to see! Very nice crust for those who like the thin kind. I really enjoyed this recipe, especially with the herbs and toppings right into the top of the dough. Neat variation! Thanks!

If you like a crispy pizza you won't like this recipe.  The crust just doesn't hold together.  I'm going to try baking it before I put toppings on and see if that makes a difference.  Hopefully it will be a little crispier.  But the flavour is great!!

I wasn't quite sure if I'd like this "quick and easy" pizza crust cause it sounded a little strange being a batter instead of a dough.  I was right.  My family (including myself) didn't care too much for it.  The taste was great with the oregano and all but the consistency wasn't something to write home about.  To me, even though I baked it as directed (even a couple minutes longer than stated), the crust was soggy except for the outer edges where it almost got burnt.  This crust resembles more of an omelette or frittata because of the sogginess of it.  We didn't care for it.

This was great! I took it to a potluck sort of thing and everyone loved it! great recipe I added a bit of basil and some extra flour like 2 cups of flour and it bakes evenly and I even got the crust brown!. ;)

-Janice H: People are entitled to make changes with what they have, and if it was great they would give it 5 stars. Just keep that in mind (Not men't to hurt or anything)

This was a good recipe - I used a pan that was a little too large so it barely coated the full pan and came out very thin but was a great thin crispy crust pizza.  I baked the dough for 10 mins without toppings, then another 8 with the sauce and toppings but I think that was only because it was so thin (my own fault).  I'll definitely make it again

There's no indication of what size pan to use.  I ended up using a 11x17 pan and my cooking time was only 12 minutes.  I did not get raised edges but did get a bunch of large air bubbles.  The texture is a little different but it made a nice, thin crust when I was in a pinch. Cutting small pieces was a must since it was very floppy, but firmed up after being out of the pan.  I may use it again, it's so easy.

I made this recipe as written and thought it was pretty good. I may make again, but not before I compare it to some others on allrecipes.com. Incase there are people with allergies making this crust, I made it lactose (almond milk) and gluten-free (King Arthur AP mix) and thought it was very comparable to Pizza Hut's thin crust. Making mine lactose and GF free I did cook it longer than the recipe said.

Update: Still one of the best crusts for a gf/vegan. I did flax seed slurry instead of eggs the second time I made it to make it vegan and it was really good too!

This was so easy and fast to put together. It was on par with a boxed mix crust as it was a fork and knife style crust and thin and flimsy so not really suited to being picked up. I cut this in half and used a quarter sheet pan and non stick spray. I used self rising flour and cut the salt to only a pinch. My crust was set in about 15 minutes. This turned out great and although it isn't gourmet or going to impress dinner guests, it is perfect for everyday. The most time consuming and difficult part of the prep was getting the dough to spread out while tilting the pan. Far easier, much faster as there is no rise time, and had more flavor than a packaged mix does. I took the picture after it was set but I had already drizzled it with sauce so you can only see bits of crust here and there. I'd use this again. Great easy super fast recipe. Thanks!

Between my husband's gout and mine and my daughter's numerous food allergies it's becoming harder and harder to cook a meal that all of us can eat.  With that being said this recipe has become an almost weekly meal for us.  I just double the recipe and make 3 individual pizza's on toaster oven baking sheets.  That way we can put whatever toppings on and everyone is happy and nobody is puffin up from an allergic reaction.  I make it exactly how it says except I put a little garlic powder and Italian seasoning in the batter.  Bake it for 10 minutes then put my toppings on and bake another 10 minutes.

My mom has been making this for probably 30 years now and it is a wonderful, fun, easy, family dinner that I now make for my own family! It is not meant to be like a regular pizza dough, that's why it's called Crazy Crust Pizza. I always make it as is and it is full proof. Just make sure you grease your pan throughly, pour in the batter, tilt your pan to coat, and sprinkle on whatever type of meat you want, I find hamburger or crumpled italian sausage to be our favorites. Bake for the recommended time, then take out and put on the sauce and remaining toppings. I made a bacon cheeseburger version and it was GREAT! Used hamburger meat, then topped with ketchup, a mix of shredded cheddar, jack, and colby cheeses, then topped with crumpled bacon. So many possibilities for a great Pizza night with the family!

This was my first home-made pizza dough, and it turned out awesome!  I did follow the reviews and only used one egg and a bit more flour, which is the only reason that I'm rating it 4/5 stars.  Success!

EXCELLENT recipe for a yeast-free dough! I upped the flour by 1/2 cup and only used one egg (more dough-like). I rolled the dough out, using a small sprinkling of flour, onto a greased pizza sheet, baked just the crust for 8 minutes and then cooked it on broil with toppings until cheese was bubbling and edges were turning brown. DEFINITELY will recommend to friends and make again!

I used this two make make smaller pizzas instead of a big one. The first pizza came out more like a pancake with cheese and sauce, so I added baking powder to the second pizza, it did not fair much better.

Great recipe! I made this with all the suggestions that others made and it turned out really well.

1)Use 1 egg and 1 and 1/2 cup flour
2)Add in tons of herbs! I used Oregano, parsley, basil, garlic powder, chili powder, salt and pepper
3)Once its in the pan I coated it with olive oil and baked just the crust for 10 mins.  Then add toppings and baked for another 15 mins.

Also with a generous spray of pam and a sprinkle of flour the crust didn't stick at all.  Perfect!!

This was....ok. My 7-year-old loved it. I wasn't sure how large of a pan to use. Obviously this affects the crust and how thick it is, how long to bake it, the consistency. I went with a small-ish pan, a bit smaller than a 9x13 jelly roll. The crust puffed up in the center. I was able to flatten it when spreading the sauce, so that was fine. The crust was pretty thin, even for my small pan, was sort of soggy, despite prebaking it correctly. I doubt I'll make it again, but it tasted ok.

This was VERY tasty! My daughter followed the instructions completely aside from using 1 egg instead of 2. I really recommend this to anybody... better than the recipes using yeast that I've tried.

I made this doubled and poured it into two 9 1/2 round pans. 2 cups flour, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups milk, 2 tsp salt, a pinch of pepper, tbsp or more of basil to my liking, and a pinch of oregano. I topped mine with mozzeralla, parmesan, roma tomatoes and sauce...very delish and the crust was very filling so i didnt have to eat alot to get full!

Excellent for when to you don't have yeast on hand! I used large pan so it made a thin crust and I only had to bake it for about 15 minutes total (10 before I added sauce and cheese and 5 after). I didn't add any other toppings...just a cheese pizza. Very easy and tasty.

Didn't work for me. I poured in 12" low side pan, put in oven to "set" and after 15min I must admit it did look crazy. Big tough bubbles on top. I punched them down and used anyway but it was not much.

Great recipe! I followed the tip to half the amount of eggs, added my family's favorite spices, and used some whole wheat flour as well as white. It turned out great!

Perfect.  Super easy and my husband ( who NEVER eats leftovers) took everything that was left to work today.  This is defintely a thin crust pizza though.

It's difficult to find a recipe for pizza dough without yeast. This turned out much better than I originally expected! Be careful which pan you use, however. The dough spread out quite a bit in my oven and one side of the crust looked just like a cresting ocean wave! All in all a great recipe. ^_^

I oiled my pan well with olive oil and the crust stuck so badly the pieces were all shredded.  Despite cutting the salt in half, it was also still too salty, and it was well-done after just 20 minutes.  I will not be making this again.  I am so disappointed and frustrated with my ruined meal.

I have used this recipe a few times and each time it gets better and better.  What a great alternative to frozen or delivered when you have those pizza cravings!  I have also used up leftovers, so it's been a money saver.  I recommend making it with only one egg and a little extra flour to your liking.  I have also added in different herbs and spices to make it really tasty (Italian seasoning, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese was amazing).

My niece and I made this and we both loved it! It was easy to make and that's good, since she's only five. We used two round 8 in. cake pans and they worked perfectly... It says to lightly grease the pan, but to test that I greased one lightly and the other a bit more. The one that I greased lightly, our pizza got stuck... So just be careful to use a nonstick pan and just enough pam (or what ever you preffer) to work, but not too much that your pizza crust gets soaked in oil.

My kids loved this and I love the idea of this recipe (which is why I still gave it five stars)!  I don't know why, but I HATE to make pizza dough.  This is a welcome alternative.  Like other reviewers, I am eager to try some modifications (I like the idea of wheat flour and a little added baking powder).  But it is delicious as is and deliciously easy too!    *Incidentally-the original recipe yield was perfect for a regular size cookie sheet-about 11X16.  I bet some of the varying results came from using differently sized pans.  I did use the entire recommended cooking time.

I really like this as a crust, but like all who comment I had to add my .02 cents. Instead of just oregano, I used Italian seasoning, just one egg, and finally some water. Just enough water to make the batter flow like a cake batter. Somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3 cup of water.   Now bake at 350 for 12 minutes, remove and add your favorite toppings. Now pop back into oven at 450 and go for 15 - 20 minutes depending on the amount of toppings.  Crust should be stiff and golden brown.  My thanks to the original poster, this make pizza making so much fun and tasty.

I followed the suggestions of others, using 1.5 cups of flour, 1 egg, etc. and it came out terrible. The only part of the pizza we (or our kids) would eat was the toppings. I will NOT be making this again.

I have made this family favorite for years. I make it just as the recipe says except 1 tsp. or Italian Seasoning.  I do place it in a pan with higher sides (81/2 x 12). I flour the pan with cornmeal. Arrange the toppings of meat, bell pepper, onion etc. over the batter.  You bake it on a low rack in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes until pizza is golden brown (Crisp Crust). Remove from oven; drizzle with pizza sauce and cover with cheese. Return to oven for 10 to 15 minutes. I made this last night and my husband ate it all and ask for another one today.

I was not "crazy" about this pizza crust.  I was in a hurry and no yeast on hand.  I was excited to find a no yeast pizza crust recipe.  I wish I would have had the time to read some of the reviews because I agree that the recipe needs baking powder, more flour, and less egg.  IMO, this recipe needs work and turned out to be more of a cross between an omelet and a pancake and nothing like any pizza crust I have ever eaten.

I'm giving this 5 stars with my few changes:  1 egg instead of 2, an extra 1/2 cup of flour, 1 tsp of baking powder and I added 1 T of Italian seasoning along with the oregano.  This is a wonderful base for a simple pizza.  YUM!

I have made this twice now.  The first time I added more flour, a tsp of baking powder and omitted an egg as reviewers suggested.  That gave me a sticky dough that had to be pressed into the pan (I too found it to not seem to stretch enough to cover my pan, but then thicker then I like it when it came out of the oven).  Since I had misplaced the recipe (and had 4 starving kids begging for pizza...no time for yeast), I had to find it again on the site.  It occured to me as I started to pencil in the suggested changes again that, although one would end up with a decent crust, the point of the original recipe was that it produces a thin "batter" vs a dough;  no need to roll out or press in the pan!  I used an offset spatula to spread the batter on a jelly roll pan brushed with olive oil.  I baked it for 12 minutes before topping with sauce and cheese and baking another 12 minutes.  The crust was a bit too brown.  Next time I'll bake for 8 mins to set and then 12 mins once topped.  The kids loved the very thin, crisp crust!  I will NEVER buy a frozen pizza again.

Use 1 egg, add 1 c flour, add 1 Tablespoon baking powder, grease pans well! If topped raw, bake on 425 for 15 min or more. I added salt to the dough because I made my own pizza sauce without salt.   This made 1 "medium" sized pizza- OR- 3 individual sized pizzas!   Tested and approved by both adults and teenage boys and girls! Great simple, no-yeast recipe!!

Aside from me misreading the directions (isn't sauce a topping??) and the funny way it looked. This crust turned out pretty good!!  My husband and I like thin crispy crust and this turned out thin and crispy.  I mixed the batter exactly as directed.  Sprayed a baking sheet with cooking spray, added the batter and then put sauce, mushrooms, onion, bacon pieces, and chopped up meatballs (had left over sauce and meatballs from spaghetti night) Put a light layer of cheese over the top and cooked for 20 min.  Once it was done I added more cheese which melted on its own.  WORKED GREAT!!  Except, I must have made it too thin cause the edges were a little burnt.  Still good!

This crust worked very well for the Chicken Fajita Pizza I made.  I would use it again, adding 1/2 cup more flour and 1 tsp. of baking powder.  It's not the best crust I've ever had, but considering the ease of it, I will definitely use again when I find myself out of yeast.

It was pretty good. I used 1&1/2 c. flour, 1 tsp olive oil, 1 egg, 1 tsp baking powder and a lot more seasonings than called for. The flavor was fine, but it was, I don't know, really, really thin, and sort of floppy. Possibly user error on my part, but overall it was good and I'll probably play around with it some more, see if I can get it a bit thicker or same thickness but crunchier, one of the two!

This was my first time making pizza crust, at first I thought I did something wrong because the dough was wet, I added another 1/2 cup of flour, crust turned out perfect. I made both the thin crust in my pizza pan and then used my cast iron skillet to make a deep dish and surprisingly to me both turned out perfect. I would suggest baking the crust before you add the topping. Will definitely make this again and again.

I made it with a few of the changes listed by others.  Here is what I did: 1.5 cups flour, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp black pepper. Mixed together and then added 1 egg, 1.5 T olive oil, 1.5 T water, 1/3 + 1/4 c. milk. Spread on greased pan that was sprinkled w/ cornmeal.  I baked at 400 for 13 min. (next time will probably do 15-17 min). Added cheese and my toppings (sausage & pepperoni) and baked for 12 more minutes.  Added some more cheese and baked 3 min. more.  Turned out really well and the kids liked it too.  I think I would back a little more in the beginning because I like my crust a little crispier but overall, it was really good.

I have never made pizza dough before and am not very good at using yeast.  This recipe turned out great!  I put it in the oven for 10 minutes then added the toppings (used the pizza sauce III recipe on this site).  I did add garlic powder, onion powder and baking powder and a little basil like other reviewers mentioned.  Really good and really easy!

This was so easy! I like that it didn't use yeast and I had all the ingredients on hand, and it came together quick. I added a Tbsp. of olive oil, a Tbsp. baking powder and probably another 3/4 flour to get it to the right consistency. Try to get it rolled out as thin as you can, because after it is baked it puffs up quite a bit. I pre-baked it for 7 minutes before I put the sauce and toppings on, and then baked it for another 20 minutes. Deeeelish!

I liked this crust.  I took others advice and used 1 1/2 cups more flour, only 1 egg, added baking powder, and about a tbl spoon more milk.  I sprinkled a pizza stone with corn meal and rolled the dough onto the stone until it was the right size and about a 1/4 inch thick.  Then I rolled up the edge just a little and baked for about 6 min at 400.  I then removed it from the oven and added my toppings and cooked another 10-15 minutes at 400.  It came out crisp and yummy and didn't stick to the stone!

I made this with only 1 egg, 1 1/2 cups flour, and a little less milk as several reviewers suggested, and it turned out fine. However, if you're used to yeast pizza crusts, this one is a disappointment. It's not a bad recipe, just a completely different taste.

Wow, this was really disappointing for us.  Even my 3 year old wouldn't eat it.  I made one batch exactly according to the recipe (except only prebaked 15 min, as the edges got very dark and the center was a mass of huge bubbles) and another batch according to the suggestions made by a number of reviewers (extra cup flour, 1 tsp bk pdr, 3 tsp Ital seasoning instead of oregano, only 1 egg), and we were not impressed with either.  I oiled both pans well with olive oil and sprinkled semolina liberally on top before adding the dough, but the original recipe still stuck to the pan something terrible.  The altered recipe did not stick, but it was also extremely sticky, wouldn't spread out well and was very frustrating to work with.   The finished texture of each was disappointing - the thin "orginal" crust somehiw managed to come out crispy and soggy at the same time, and the other one was biscuit-like and too bready.  We make pizza from scratch every week, but we will never use this recipe again.

i halved this because it was for a piza for my daughter. She is allergic to citric acid, and as that is a preservative in so many things, making stuff from scratch has become commonplace. She enjoyed this crust, and has asked that we make it again. So easy she helped make it with me - and she's 4! :-)

I loved this crust, but make sure you spray your cookware REALLY good. The first time I tried this crust I forgot to spray the sheet and we ended up eating cheese and toppings because the crust all stuck. Overall, great crust for those who don't have yeast laying around.

I really wanted to have success with this recipe but I was disappointed.  It was kind of like eating pizza toppings on top of an omlette and I only used 1 egg.  I prebaked and flipped before adding toppings but it never really cooked any more and was too soft.  I think I was expecting more of a biscuit texture.  Didn't work for me and probably won't make again.

This pizza crust is excellent and no-hassle!  I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour and one egg instead of two.  It came out perfectly.  It's the perfect thin crust pizza (which is my favorite style crust), yet it's sturdy enough to hold anything you want to put on it (I piled on cheese, sausage, olives, mushrooms, fresh basil, and the crust held up nicely.)

A little like focaccia, not a traditional pizza crust but great if you're looking to make pizza and you're out of yeast.  I'll make it again.

So much fun! I made three crusts with this recipe and made each a different way. The first I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added about a 1/2 c. extra flour and tossed some basil in. The second I only used one egg, a dash of garlic powder, 2 tsp. italian seasoning and a drizzle of olive oil. For the third, I tried to cut the recipe in half but didn't use exact measurements and kept playing with it until I achieved the same texture as the first two. These bubble up a LOT when you pre bake them, but it doesn't change how good your pizzas can turn out! The only downside is that I just couldn't get the crust crispy enough. They were a bit chewy. Everyone in our home agreed that we won't be ordering out for pizza again. Thank you!

A doughy gourmet crust it is NOT, but it is yummy, easy and quick.  It is also very cheap to make.

Adding fresh garlic and herbs to the crust made it taste very, very good.  Will be making over and over again.  Great recipe.

Not bad. Delicious flavor, but very thin. I used a 13x9x5/8" jelly roll pan. The dough barely filled the pan, so the corners were brown. Baked the pizza for about 10 minutes, then topped it with sauce, mushroom, green peppers, and Parmesan cheese and baked about 10 more minutes. Next time I make it, I will probably double the recipe and use the same pan. *I only used one egg this time, as other reviewers said they had done. I think this is sufficient.

New variation - mini pizzas! I omitted the oregano and used only 1 egg (per the other reviews).  I spooned the dough into a greased muffin tin (made 1 dz) then added meat and spinach to dough before baking about 10 minutes in electric oven.  Then  added sauce/cheese and baked again until cheese melted.   My 2 yr old and 4 yr old absolutely loved these mini pizzas!

This came out great. I didn't have any yeast, so I didn't expect it to be like normal pizza dough. The edges rolled up all by themselves which made it good in holding the toppings and forming an edge. My kids loved it. The middle didn't cook as much as I would have liked it too, but otherwise it was great in a pinch.

I gave this one another shot tonight, and I really did love the results.  I made sure to spray my pan really really well and I baked it for about fifteen minutes then took it out of the oven and topped it with sauce, cheese and toppings and baked it for another fifteen minutes.  It turned out a nice thin kind of chewy and really good crust.  I still like regular pizza crust better but this was good, and just so so easy and fast. 
Oh, also I didn't put any of the seasonings in it, just salt and I substituted water for the milk, and used only one egg.  
If this crust doesn't come out for you, or tastes like a tortilla then you did something wrong.  There is no way it tastes like anything but a good different pizza crust.

I like this recipe, although I add a bit of garlic powder, parsley and Italian seasoning (in place of the oregano).  The first time I tried it, it stuck horribly to the pan (I used a deep frying pan for deep dish style), so I changed things around and used a cookie sheet, well oiled.  I bake it for about 10-15 minutes before adding the toppings so we end up with a nice, crisp thin crust.  Great recipe when you don't have yeast on hand, and makes a great pizza out of a few ingredients!  I have this in my recipe box and will continue to use it on game days!

This recipe was so easy!  I used a double batch of dough because I have a deep dish pizza pan and the dough rose up the sides perfectly!  I did let it cook about 10 min before I added the hamburg topping. Then I grated up some pepper jack cheese for a little added kick. My husband and son LOVED it!  If I can do it, anyone can!  :)  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

I loved this recipe.  It was really easy and fast.  I baked the crust about five minutes before I added any toppings at all....it came out great.  I also added about two tbls of olive oil (I love olive oil) and a bit of salt more.  Although it was not a "traditional" pizza crust, it is a good one especially when time is limited.

This is a great recipe that uses basic ingredients (it was the only one I found that did not call for yeast). It is very quick and easy to prepare and has a great flavor. I have already passed it onto several friends and they love it also.

I tried this recipe when we were in the mood for pizza, but time restraints made me balk at the idea of making the traditional dough. It was super easy to do and the crust comes out almost like a pancake. Generally, I prefer a thick crust, but this was really good and my kids loved it. It did not last long at all!

No words for this. So amazingly tasty. Will make our Wednesday nighst pizza night. Simple ingredients, and easy to put together. And the kids?!?! ''Mom, please make these every night?" :-) Once a week is enough, but seriously next time I'll double the recipe.

It worked okay in a pinch but I only used 1 egg because other reviews said it was too "eggy".  REALLY oil your pizza pan, I sprayed mine down pretty good with cooking spray and it still stuck in the middle.  I baked it for 12 min, flipped it, and then put the toppings on and baked for another 10 min.

Followed recipe to the letter then baked in a cast iron skillet. Fantastic. Definitely try as directed before making substitutions -- you won't regret it.

Was looking for a quick dinner, and saw this recipe. I only used one egg, and a little more flour to make the crust more doughy. Instead of pepper and oregano, I used italian seasoning (grinder) and it was great! Topped with red peppers, ham, and cheese :) Put a little oil in the pan to crisp up the crust and it was great! will make this crust all the time now!

Ive just made this recipe. It was the best yeast-less pizza I have ever made and Ive tried several. Read the reviews and only used 1 egg and added some basil and then my toppings.  I will make it again. It was so quick and easy.  Very good pizza.

I have tried many times making pizza at home and the crust was always funny tasting. This is a great recipe. I did make it using the suggestion of reducing to one egg. Whole family loved it, including my 4 kids. Nice, flavorful, soft where needed and crispy where its supposed to be. I think we wont be ordering out for pizza anymore.

It was a great yeast-less pizza crust. Very simple but also very good. I didn't have any oregano in my house so I used some garlic powder instead and it was a hit. :))

Great non-yeast pizza dough recipe.  Our dough rose up in the oven, took only 12 minutes to brown in oven at 400 degrees.  We poked it to deflate...seriously it almost reached the top of the oven.  However, the crust was crispy on the edges, and  I wished we had left it in the oven for the time required.  DELICIOUS!

I liked how easy and fast this recipe was, and I specifically like how it didn't use yeast. I thought the crust was flavourful and made a great pizza. I took some of the previous reviewer's advice and only used one egg. I found the crust was a little doughy were air bubbles in the crust formed, but I am still going to use this recipe again!

I was nervous about this recipe because the batter was so runny. I pour it onto half a cookie sheet then the crust started to settle and I was relieved. I decided to roll the pizza crust like a Stromboli, LOVED IT!!!

I liked this a lot.  It tasted more like a cornmeal crust than a floury crust, and it was pretty heavy.  I used a cup of milk accidentally, instead of 2/3 c and it made a very large crust.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but for me the 20 minute initial cooking time was too much. By the time I added the sauce and cheese, and put it back in for 10 minutes, my crust was burned.
I will use this recipe again with 10 minutes and 10 minutes. The rest of the pizza NIC the crust was good.

This is my go to crust. We love it here. I have made a couple of changes though. We like a thicker crust so I always double the recipe when I make it. I also use italian seasoning instead of oregano and pre-bake the crust for about 10 before I add the toppings.

Loved this recipe. I make homemade za all the time and this is a GREAT FAST TASTY crust that gives you that chi town deep dish mouth feel in half the time with what seems like zero effort. I left the recipe as is and was pleased. I'm making it tonight and will add some different Italian seasonings. Thanks for the recipe! It's in my AR save recipes box

Great no yeast Recipe. I followed Kimbermarie's changes, however... When a recipe is changed too much from the original recipe, it no longer is the same recipe.  That's what happened here.  But it was a wonderful option.  I needed both eggs & had to roll out the dough with a rolling pin.  But it did rise well and cooked in 12 minutes for me.

We LOVE this recipe, I'm allergic to yeast, so for years I've been searching for a yeast free pizza crust. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's too hard to make with these measurements. Rather than throwing a batter in to set, then added all the toppings, we just add one extra cup of flour, then it's like an actual batter and you can throw it right in to the oven. And you can see by the picture I added, that it's not too biscuit-like or anything. That's what I love about this recipe, every other recipe I've found tastes like a biscuit or like a cracker...It is pretty dense, but I like that. This tastes just like pizza with the toppings!!!!!

I did an oops with this one and had spooned sauce on the dough then realized that it was supposed to go on last. Since I was already beyond the point of no return I kept adding all the toppings finishing with cheese and cooked it for an extra 10 min. Turned out great.

I at first did not realize why it was called Crazy Crust. Now I do and I am amazed! I did not have to fold up the sides in order for the outer part to rise up higher than the middle! It was amazing and tasted phenomenal. I of course added Italian seasoning instead of just oregano.

I use this pizza crust when I'm in a hurry as it's quick and easy to make, no waiting for the dough to rise.  It's not my favorite but is a frequent in my house.  It makes for a quick and easy pizza.

I followed mizwhite's idea for the additions! (Thank you!) I also added: 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and chopped up pieces of pepperoni and put in with the dough.  Also for little ones who may not like pizza; I separated a portion of the dough and added shredded cheese then dropped little portions on the oiled baking sheet to make little puff balls. Cooked those for 10 minutes. I heated up marinara then added chopped basil to use for dipping. Yummy!

Tasty, fast, and filling.  Used flour as needed to firm up dough, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, garlic powder, pepper, one egg, and milk.   Thank you.

A little disappointing because tortilla pizzas in the toaster oven are better. I, too, used the one egg; baked for 12 minutes, then added toppings, and baked for another 20. The middle was still quite doughy. For something one can make in a pinch, it was fine (family liked it, but weren't raving), but I don't think I'll do it again.

This is basically a Yorkshire pudding recipe.  I don't think you need to add baking power as some people did but the extra 2 eggs are necessary.  The key to getting it to puff up better is to let it rest for a minimum of 1 hour and you can leave it for up to about 4 hours.

This was a fun recipe; not really a crust, more of a popover, but a tasty change.

I needed a quick pizza crust recipe.  I found this!!!  It was excellent!! I used leftover ingredients for toppings.  I actually made a meatball pizza.  I added an extra 1/2c. of flour and that was all.  I made this for me and my dad who refuses to eat pizza.  Guess what?  He ate it and loved it!!!!!!!

Awesome finally a pizza dough you can throw together with ingredients you always have on hand. AND it tastes great! I just did one egg as so many others suggested, and followed everything else the same. Took 20 minute, didn't stick AT ALL, then about 6 minutes more once I added the cheese. I just did cheese and sausage, didn't have pizza sauce. Thanks!

The final result was a delicious pizza!! Loved the idea that is easy to make and everyone can pick their favorite toppings on their side of the pizza!
I added like 1/2 a cup of flour so it was more doughy and pizzalike.

I made this crust for a chicken-ranch pizza and it was awesome!  I did like some others suggested and only used one egg and added some extra flour. I sprayed my pan with some PAM and sprinkled it with cornmeal and it didn't stick at all.  I LOVE oregano so I added a dash more than called for, and also added some crushed red pepper flakes for a bite. My whole family LOVED it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This made a pretty good crust, for when you are time pressed or out of yeast.  It came out tasting like a large crispy edged crepe.  Very with non traditional toppings, like smoked cured salmon ( put it on after baking) cream cheese and capers.  Yum!

After carefully reading all the suggestions, I followed the most common ones, made the dough, and it was probably the worst pizza crust I have every made.  Someone mentioned the sauce may make it soggy; it was not soggy, it was DOUGHY and inedible.  I'm not sure what recipe everyone else was following, but I would not recomment this one to anyone. Had to scrape off ingredients and eat without crust as it was so bad.

Ok, this one is a bit more difficult for me to rate.  As far as taste and personal preference, I would give it a 3.  It in no way compares to a yeast pizza crust which is what I prefer.  However, that is not what it promised to be, it promised quick and easy without the yeast and without the wait.  The teenagers, who told me they would not be home for supper so I didnt make a pizza dough ahead of time, came in hungry and this did seem to satisfy the hungry natives.  So for delivering  what it promised, and for being quick and easy, I will give this a 4 because if that is your goal and what you need, it will work just fine and still have a decent taste.  It is just a different taste and texture to pizza is all.  And that is okay too, just not my thing.

This was a great solution when I realized we were out of yeast. I used fresh savory and oregano from my garden and baked the dough for about 10-12 minutes before we added our toppings. The crust didn't become soggy either, and we really enjoyed the flavor.  Being that this is more of a flat bread, I'm going to make this again and try it with hummus.

This pizza dough was okay. The flavor was good; I give it a B-. But it does not have the texture of pizza crust at all. The texture was more like masa, the outer covering of tamales.  It wasn't like eating pizza at all.

It was a different experience, i'll give it that. the crust was a bit cakey but since I added a tblspoon of baking soda not flat at all but not exactly desired height, oh well it was good and I got some to eat it. As goes another day.

This was super easy to make but I did only add one egg, and I cooked it in the oven for ten minutes, and then put sauce, cheese, and toppings on and put on the grill, yes I grilled pizza, and it was amazing, I followed the recipe exactly (except for the egg), and the dough tasted soo yummy! I will definitely use this recipe whenever i make pizza!!

Follow the suggestions to reduce the eggs and add baking soda, and this is a fabulous base for pizza dough.  Great on the BBQ, too.

Great in a pinch.  I used a combo of regular flour and self-rising flour.  I also did a batch and a half for a regular sized cookie sheet.  Added baking powder, onion and garlic powder, olive oil, 2 eggs for the batch and a half.  Baked for 12 min. and then w/ toppings for another 10ish.  It came out quite puffy, kinda soggy/crumbly, salty.  Next time, I think there will be a next time, I will omit the salt, and stick w/ one batch for a cookie sheet.  The kids were fine w/ it so thats pretty much all that matters!

This pizza crust is amazing! I followed Mizwhite's recommendations and it turned out awesome! The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white.

Made this tonight with other reviewers suggestions of more flour (1.5 cups) and 1 egg and a little olive oil.  I added garlic & onion powder as well as basil, salt & pepper.  BIG hit with the kids.  8 yo son said "best homemade pizza ever!"  I baked the crust first for about 10 minutes to keep it softer, next time I will cook it longer for a crisper crust.   Will make again!

This crust is awesome.  Like most people I only used 1 egg.  As my household is gluten-free it was made with a gluten-free all-purpose flour and it was still amazing.  I also used a glass casserole instead of a pizza pan which made it deep dish.  It suprised me how heavy the pizza ended up considering how little went in it.  5 stars all day long.

very impressed with this yeast-less dough!  i did a few things differently: 1 1/4 cups of flour, 1 egg, 1 tbls olive oil, 2 tsp baking powder, parsley, basil, thyme, pepper, oregano, garlic powder for my seasonings. also, no cow's milk in our house, rice milk instead. turned out fantastic!  made 2 pie plates(dessert sized, not pizza sized).  my son really loved helping and making his own pizza.  baked for about 14 min, no toppings, then an additional 5-10 for the cheese to melt.  FANTASTIC!  will make again and again!

I followed this recipe pretty much as it said. The base is thin.  I did cook it for a little longer than suggested so that is was not sloppy. I will use it again.

Tried this and substituted Italian Seasoning, do not use a small retangle sheet as it spreads too thin and overcooks on the edges.  use small pizza pan, instead and 10 min cook time is just fine, smells great, and is great to use like a thin foccia with salads.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers: 1.5 cups of flour, 1 egg and 2/3 cup milk. I then made the Arrabbiata Sauce from this site and it was a hit. I spread the dough out to make a very thin crust (which my family prefers). Definitely our go-to crust recipe from now on.

I can't get this crust to taste yummy. It bakes up nicely but it doesn't have a good, pizza crust flavor.  I plan to keep playing around with it since it's so easy and convenient though.

Perfect for a fast family dinner! My family really loved it. I made it for dinner and the next day it was requested for lunch. Since it makes a very thin crust, make sure not to overload the toppings.

Great pizza dough, I preferred it over my yeast recipe.  It's suppose to be runny, so don't add the extra flour;  It turns out great without it.  I did add a tsp baking powder, and only 1 egg. Delicious!!

I'm a little torn rating this recipe. I chose not to take reviewer suggestions, and made this as written. It was crispy ~ like a thin, crispy pizza crust, but while the middle was still needing cook time, the edges were burning. I did spread the batter with the back of a spoon to make it uniform, but it didn't help. Also, it really puffed up in areas (most areas) even after pricking it with a fork. The crust came out very "bumpy." It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. I loved how quick and easy it was but wouldn't make this again.

Love this because you don't have to mess around with yeast!  Instead of just oregano, I use an Italian seasoning blend to make it even more flavorful!

Love this! A different tasting pizza crust, but easy and fun to make! perfect when you don't have a pizza crust on hand. I've made all different pizzas with this crust, and they're all tasty! a thinner softer crust. My young children have no problem eating this crust while they'll sometimes skip the crust on commercial pizzes.

I added lots of italian-y based spices to the batter. The kids loved it, my husband hated it. I will try it again, maybe add some baking powder this time or bake it on a different dish to make it crispy.

Delicious! I added a tiny bit of baking powder, to make it rise a bit more, and put all the toppings in the center, so that the crust would rise more at the end.

Very good, although we usually make a deep dish pizza in a large cake pan so we need to use 1 1/2 times the recipe, otherwise it is too thin for us.

This was a pretty good crust. I read reviews before getting started and decided to add 2 tsp. of baking powder but 1 would have probably worked. I also added an extra 1/2 c. flour because I was too afraid of sticking. As I tried spreading the crust on the bottom of my very well oiled cookie sheet, I realized one batch wasn't quite enough. As I made a second batch I remembered that I was out of milk and my only option was water!  I did what I had to do and in the end couldn't tell a difference between the milk half and the water half! Good to know! I will definitely be making this again so long as it passes the husband test. Being able to add more seasonings made an awesome difference (2 t. garlic powder, 2 t. dried chopped onions, and 2-3 t. Italian seasoning) compared to a pre-made Pillsbury crust. The cost difference is great too.  Oh-I also pre-baked my crust at 400 for about 8 minutes and it was pretty much done on the inside After 10 minutes more with the toppings it was just right and still moist.

Really good and easy to make.  I did as suggested and used more flour and also added baking powder. It was very thick and sticky, so the step that notes: "pour" it into the pan didn't work out. I used a greased spoon to spread it into the pan.  Topped it with a little ricotta, garlic, chicken, feta, fresh spinach and artichoke hearts.  It was fantastic.

My family liked this. The only thing I would do differently is make 2 seperate pizzas instead of 1 half n half. The cheese side was perfect.The topping side was a little soggy but good.

I followed the recipe except used only one egg.  I decided to make a breakfast pizza.  Used Alfredo Sauce and topped with scrambled eggs, sausage and monterey jack cheese.  Very good and easy to make in the morning if you get the toppings ready the night before. Yum!

Not bad! I couldn't find my usual yeastless pizza dough recipe so I opted for this one. I made a bbq chicken pizza & it was quick & easy! Love the way you just plop it on the pan and spread it around by tilting the pan. I did make a couple changes such as one egg & 2 tsp. baking powder & baked it 10 min. before adding the toppings. Next time I may add more flour because I wouldn't mind it a little thicker. My son was home & he liked it as well. He's a picky eater so this is a compliment! I will add it to my recipe box.

i gave this recipe 5 stars although mine didn't turn out quite so well, but that is my fault.  i misread the recipe cause i was in a hurry and i used water instead of milk. but it was still really good.  maybe i will use a little less salt and add some parmasean (sorry) cheese to the mix.  idk but the kids really liked it even my 2 yr old who never eats the crust.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added baking powder. I also reduced the eggs since I was doubling the recipe I only used three instead of four. I also went with the lower cooking time. With these few modifications it turned out great.

Uh, no, not a good recipe.  If you read through, most people who have had succhess with the recipe, it is because they changed it.  I made as it.  It had the consistency of cake batter.  I added flour until I could make it into a pizza crust.  Baked it for 20mins, put on toppings, and baked for 10 more.  It was like eating baked play-doh with pizza toppings.  Served its purpose, but would have rather pulled out a can of the refrigerator biscuits and added a bit of flour to knead into a crust.

I was looking for a bread stick recipe to go with some chili I was making, but could only find ones with yeast, which I didn't have. I came across this one and adapted it to work for bread sticks by shaping the dough into logs. Like others, I used only one egg, used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tablespoon olive oil and a sprinkling of water. I also added some cumin and red pepper to give it a spicy kick. They were a bit dry, but perfect for dipping in chili! Will make again!

Interesting recipe - the pizza crust is made from a liquid batter poured onto the pizza pan. Decent thin crust.

As I started mixing the batter I have to say I was not hopeful for this recipe.  However, it did not turn out bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Its not wonderful but does well in a pinch.

so good and easy. was surprised at the mushy crust, but then realized that eggs were in it. add oil if you it's not a non-stick pan. I will definitely make it again:)

This crust was both tasty and healthy. I used whole wheat flour for mine. I put a layer of fresh spinach leaves on top of the unbaked crust, and then sprinkled on sliced fresh mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, sliced onions, sliced olives, and diced cooked chicken. I baked it for about 20 minutes, and then put on the sauce and cheese. The crust was a little rubbery, but very tasty and healthy. Thanks for a good recipe; I will use it again!

Just came out of the oven, really great, tender and chewy, i really like it, but the dough was very sticky couldent handel it so i added an extra cup and a half flour (used whole wheat) and i added more spices to it like dried oregano, basil and nutmeg, and used only one egg. turned out very flavorable.

My husband loves to make this pizza dough with our kids.  It gives me time off and the kids get to do something with their dad.  Makes for an excellent pizza!

This is one of the best pizza crust recipes I've tried.  It's easy because there is no yeast, so it doesn't take long to make.

I used the ingredients as listed (did not cut down on egg as some suggested).  I didn't cook as long as the recipe says.  I did not time it, but when the crust was golden brown on top, I took it out of the oven, flipped it over, and put my toppings on.

I didn't have a pizza pan, so I used two pie pans.  This made two perfect individual pizzas.  I used 3 tablespoons of sauce on each, and about 1/2 cup cheese each.

I will certainly be making this recipe again!  Thank you!

This is very simple to make and you can easily adjust the flavors to your liking.  I make a Mexican version of it also for a Mexican pizza and we love it!

Crust was hard and crunchy around the outside, rubbery and heavy in the middle. Poor texture, odd flavor. If you're going to make pizza, just make pizza. This was a waste of ingredients.

I was not impressed.  My dh liked it and ate all his, but I scraped off the topping because I couldn't stomach the crust.  I used 1 1/2 c flour, 1 egg, the baking powder, water & oil recommended by other users.  It did not stick to the pan at all but was a little hard to spread.  It tasted to me more like bisquick with too much baking powder.  I don't think I'll be making it again.

Best crust I have made thus far. Super easy and tastes great. The only alterations I made were using Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder.
When I made it I spread it out super thin on my Pampered Chef Bar Pan and I thought it might be too thin once cooked but it turned out great.
Andrea :)

This dough was terrific! I usually don't have time to wait for the yeast, so I was looking for a crust that didn't require it.  I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and shredded asiago cheese. It was delicious and my family loved it. Very quick and easy.

This is a great Idea. Quick and painless. I love basil. So I added two teaspoons of basil and one of oregano. The crust works well as bread for dipping.

If I could give this recipe no stars, I would.

This recipe tasted like I was eating pizza on playdoh. I was not a fan, and based on all of the good reviews, I was really excited about trying this recipe. I love pizza, and I love trying new kinds of pizza, but this did not make the cut. Suffice it to say, I will NOT be making this recipe again.

Although this recipe tasted great, it stuck to the pan like crazy, even after adding oil to the mix and spraying cooking spray on the pans.   We make homemade pizza every weekend, and I have never had a crust do this before.  Won't be making it again....sorry.

Our 12 year old does not like homemade pizza due to the crust we usually use, but he LOVED this!! He actually scraped the topping off his last piece just to eat the crust. I wasn't sure what size pan this called for, and I needed to use an 11x13, so I doubled the recipe but used exactly the ingredients it called for. It was a little too thick for my taste, since it's not "fluffy". I can't even describe the texture- almost like a frozen pizza crust, but it tasted better. Next time I will not double and still use an 11x13 pan.

This was okay.  The baking times seemed to be way off.  I checked my crust at 16 minutes and it was already done with the edges getting VERY dark.  I sprayed it with some olive oil before I put it back to melt the cheese.  I used all the exact measures in the recipes.  It did taste a little eggy.  I did not have a pizza pan with an edge, so I used a 9x13 pan.  It seemed to be a good size.  If I do this again, I think I might use a 9 inch round pan...so the crust is thicker.  And I might take the suggested of a single egg from other reviews.

This is a great recipe to have! Saves limiting pizza to the nights I remember to buy a crust. As per other reviews, I used whole wheat flour, only one egg, and added about 1 tsp of baking powder. This made a good, crispy, thin crust. I topped mine with pesto, brie, pears and pine nuts. Yum!

I made the following changes:
2tsps baking powder
1.5 cups wheat flour
1 egg
Baked for 10 minutes, then flipped and put toppings on  (sauce, onion, mushroom, pepper, and cheese) and baked for another 12 minutes. (all at 400)

The recipe didn't turn out terrible, but a little thick and crumbly.
It was not egg-y at all.
I think it's best if you spread this out pretty thin though, just to warn you all.

Worth trying out :).

I took the suggestions of other members and used only one egg and a little more flour. I increased the seasonings (used italian seasoning) and salt. Overall my husband and I thought it was great! I did add a couple of glugs of olive oil to the batter. Baked for 10 min, flipped it, added my toppings and then baked about 12 min until the cheese barely started to brown. Will use this again! Very very easy! Don't touch the batter with your hands though. . .very very sticky. I used a wooden spoon to spread on sheet (11 x 15).

I read several of the reviews and took their advice!  Used just one egg, a 1/2 tsp of dried Italian season, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp granular garlic and 1/2 tsp of onion powder in the dough.  Poured it into the center of a large cookie sheet that I had sprayed well with oil spray, baked it 10 minutes, flipped it over and baked it 10 minutes more.  I brushed a bit of EVOO over the crust, scattered thin slices of kielbasa over the crust and covered it with a mix of parmesan, romano and mozzarella.  My husband LOVED it!  Thanks much!!!

I give this recipe three good stars! If one star means that it didn't turn out or that the recipe was awful, five stars means that you would make the recipe for Dalai Lama and have him for supper. Three must mean that I'm glad I tried it and probably wouldn't make it again. I followed the recipe and added the helpful hints given by another reviewer "mizwhite". The only exception was that I had added 1 1/2 Tbsp. Pizza Seasoning (Oregano, Basil, Marjoram, Gran Garlic) instead of the Oregano in the original recipe and the Basil in mizwhite. Overall, it was a fun idea for our Pizza and Movie Saturday Night. I'll try a different recipe next time!

I tried this twice because I wanted so badly for it to work, but unfortunately I didn't get good results.  With the exception of the outer edges, the crust was soft and spongy, almost the consistency of a thick crepe!  I only used one egg, pre-baked before adding the toppings, and let it bake for extra time on the second try to make sure it wasn't underdone.  Still not good.  My quest for a good yeast-free crust continues...

I must admit that I had my doubts about this one, but it came out very good...if you don't compare it to real pizza dough.  I made a double batch for 1 pan and only added 2 eggs instead of 4.  I used Itallian seasoning and greased and cornbreaded my pan.  Great for if you are in a hurry!

For a thin, no yeast recipe, this is the best! I also only used one egg (to cut down on the "eggy" flavor) and it turned out great!

My kind of recipe: quick, easy and cheap!! I used two eggs and only 1/3 cup of milk, it seemed like if I added the rest, it would've been too soggy.  But I think that pizza crust consitency and taste has a lot to do with the quality of flour you use. (tips from the NYC pizza guys)  I did put some garlic in it too.  Great recipe!

I am the all-time worst pizza dough maker.  I mess up every dough, even frozen.  Well, not any more!  This made the BEST pizza dough ever!  It was a little strange when I put it on the pan, but came out beautifully thin and crispy.  Unbelievable!  I will now make a lot more homemade pizza!  I can't thank you enough!

This is the recipe that had me signing up for AllRecipes in order to rate it (and to give me a reason to frequent the site). I'm all for quick and easy, and this is both -- and, as a bonus, quite good. It encourages creativity in adding the toppings and provides a good base for a quick meal.

Crazy crust is a perfect name for this recipe!  It is very simple to make, but it's paper thin, like a tortilla.  Truthfully, it tastes like one too.  Not very good for pizza, sorry :(

For as easy as this recipe is....my 5 year old made it, I'm not sure why it would get 1 star.  I used bread flour, all I had and it came out good...even the next day it was good.  I think the fact that it bubbles up may just be the reason that it is called "crazy crust pizza dough."  Anything that will bring that big of a smile to my son's face...because he did it on his own is worth 5 stars to me!  He has already asked to make it again because he really liked it.  Actually I am going to be making a pizza dip and I think that this crust will be good for dipping.....mmmmm.  Thanks Karen!

My husband really enjoyed the pizza I made with this crust.  He isn;t an easy man to please when it comes to food.  I took other reviewers advise and only used one egg.  It had a floury taste to me.  May be it was the type of flour I used.  I will diffently make this again.

After reading other reviews I altered the recipe a bit. I used less water and took the advice of others and used only one egg. I was able to achieve a nice consistency that I spread out on to my pan with a spoon. It cooked nice and crusty. If you like an easy crusty dough this is it! My three year old daughter even said, "I like this crust."

Well, I just got done making this.  I  didn't have any yeast, and it was really easy to make.   For some reason, mine kindof bent up on the edges to form  a bowl shape, which actually worked nicely.  I halved the recipe and made just a little pizza.  I cooked it about 10 minutes, then added the toppings.  Ithink it turned out incredible.  It's not plain old pizza.  My toppings were pretty good so maybe  that helped.  I added red onion, mushrooms, and green pepper.  For meat, I used some leftover nacho meat I made with hamburger, chipolte powder, and chili powder.  I used mild cheddar cheese, and created my own pizza sauce with diced tomatoes, a small clove of garlic chopped, salt, pepper, and sugar.  It turned out great.  I was making it for my boyfriends lunch tomarrow, but I don't know if there'll be any left by then!

Very good!  I added garlic and onion powder and little extra flour to the crust as well.  I used this crust last night to make a home-made chicken alfredo pizza.  I baked the crust for about 12 minutes, then topped with alfredo sauce, poached chicken, and a blend of cheeses, then baked for another 15 minutes.  I sprinkled grated parmesan cheese and let it sit for a few minutes before putting it on the table.  Was a nice change from the norm :)

I have to say that in a pinch, I liked this recipe. Is it the "Best"? No, but in a pinch it was just fine. As far the those that complain about the dough sticking to the pan, try parchment paper. It works great. No muss no fuss.

I actually really enjoyed this pizza crust. I can't eat yeast, so it was perfect! But I made modifications. I doubled the recipe, but it was sooo runny that I added another cup of flour and only 3 eggs. Next time I am going to just do one to one with eggs and flour. It came out about the same consistancy as yeast pizza dough, but a tad stickier. It was hard to spread out, but once i got it even, it didn't move. I used a non-stick cookie sheet and olive oil and it didn't stick at all. I also put sauce and toppings on before baking it at all. I baked it for the suggested 25 mins at 400, then broiled it for about 5  mins to get the cheese brown.

Well I tried this recipe due to fact I didn't have time for the traditional yeast crust. I read all the reviews and thought beforehand I knew all the bugs ... I was WRONG!! I greased my pan, but still the batter stuck to the pan and I had to scrape the surface of the pizza off, what a mess.I will not attempt my hand at this crust again!!

I love pizza and am very set in my ways, but yesterday I had no dough and no yeast, so I came across this recipe.  It was very different, but good.  Don't make it if you are looking for a traditional type of crust.  This one was more chewy than a normal crust.  I had a problem with the crust bubbling up, so after the original 20 minutes, I poked some holes before adding the sauce and cheese.  The bubbles went away and it came out perfect.

Great recipe if you don't have yeast. The crust is simple and good. I used a few tablespoons of extra flour to thicken and added a teaspoon of baking powder.

I had a horrible time with this crust. First, I put it in the pan, baked it for 20 min at 400 degrees. At around 10-15 minutes, I went to check on it and it was burnt and there were bubbles in it that were bigger than my fist. I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I tried again. This time I used a new pan because I had to throw the other away (yes, it was burnt that bad). This time I only left it in the oven about 8 minutes. I then put my sauce and cheese on. Well, obvoiusly that 8 minutes was not enough, it's rising everywhere it's not supposed to. It was coming out the sides of the pan instead of rising upwards. It's the ugliest pizza I've ever seen, not only that, it's very doughy. Been a major pain in the butt!

Yummeeee!!!  Just like the old family italien restaurant that I love.  It came out perfect.  Heres what I did...baked 10 min.  then put on sausage + veggies, bake 10 min.  then sauce (1cup)and cheese, bake 7 min.   Used foil and cooking spray on my old baking sheets.  Thanks so much!!

This pizza crust is GREAT!  It is quick and simple.  If you have a Betty Crocker cook book this is very similar to the puffy oven pancake only flat.  I had told my mom we had a pizza in the freezer and I found out I was wrong.  I hopped on AllRecipes and found this.  I made it and we were very impressed.  It is kinda crisp on the edge and not in the middle.  One tip though once it is mixed and in the pan let it sit for about 10 minutes.  This will make a little more stable crust and maybe just a touch thicker too.  This is a good pizza for thin crust lovers.

ICK!!   This dough had the consistancy of cornbread.  The spices helped the flavor, however they were not enough to rescue this recipe.  We followed the advice of others to cook the crust for 10 minutes prior to putting anything on it.  It was not a pleaser for our family at all.  My daughter who loves pizza ate apple slices with peanut butter for dinner instead of the pizza!

I thought it was kind of weird that the pizza was not like a dough but rather like a liquidy substance.  But it came out good in the long run except I suggest cooking the dough first because the pizza is sloppy in the end and taste more like a kind of pasta but it's still worth it because it was delicious.

I used this recipe for years and lost it when we moved.  The only thing I do different is bake the crust for a few minutes to get it to set up and then add the ingredients so they don't sink into the dough.  The boys did not like the ingredients sinking into the dough. Also could put a cornmeal or salt base on the pan then pour the crust on it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. My toppings were pepperoni, sausage and ham. Then the sauce and mozzarella. The crust was not eggy as others had noted. It had thin crisp crust. Maybe other people are overloading it with sauce or not spreading the batter thin enough.

This recipe tastes great but doesn’t look too good. If you are cooking for others, I recommend using another recipe!

Rated for the recipe as written.  Following the advice of others of only 1 egg, extra flour, and olive oil, I would rate the reviewers revised recipe a 5.

This pizza dough came out great, I did take the suggestions of the other reviewers, increased the flour and added one egg instead of two.

I made this to the recipe and then tried again with the adjustments suggested by reviewers. the original recipe was better than the one egg, extra flour suggestion. however it was nothing like pizza dough. I'm not sure how to describe it. we ended up making a cheesy bread of sort. I won't be making it again, even in a pinch.

When trying to tilt the pan around to spread the dough it would all slide around in one big mass because the pan was greased. I had to use my hands (big mess) to spread it. Even with the pan greased the crust was positively glued to the nonstick pan. Taste wasn't great, toppings didn't stick, just a complete failure. I will stick to a crust with yeast from now on. I thought this would be a time saver, but it will take me forever to get the pan clean.

Wow! So impressed! The texture was right on, the shape the dough took as it was baking was super cool, and the taste was GREAT! It almost reminded me of a focaccia bread, and I didn't have to wait an hour and a half for the dough to rise!!! And and and it only took 5 minutes to make!!!! Amazing! I think I already have it memorized, it's so simple. I can whip this out anywhere and amaze people, I love it! Thanks so much for sharing my new favorite recipe!

I don't think I did anything wrong in the directions but it was not good. Almost as thin as a piece of paper. I pre cooked it for about 8 min, then after the toppings were on about 20-25 min more and it was still raw. The toppings were burning so I had to take it out. My family was very dissappointed.

Quick, easy, and tasty, but it stuck to the pan horribly even though I sprayed it.  I had to eat it straight out of the pan.  Next time I'll try it with parchment paper underneath.

Based on other reviews I left out one egg, I am not sure if that is why the bottom was soggy or not or it was due to me adding to much sauce but I love how easy it was to make and it had pretty good flavor. Everyone liked it just  joked it was like lasagna. Will give it another try for sure!

Just devoured our pizza using this recipe! Added more flour like reviews said and only one farm fresh free-range egg as well as one tsp garlic powder! Mixed into ball then used rolling pin to flatten dough! Will use this recipe again if yeast isn't available!

I loved this..easy and good!  Was somewhere and didn't have oregano or tomato sauce.  Added dried onins, substituted salsa ( added a little water to thin), topping was chopped chicken breast.   Used shredded cheddar and pepperjack cheeses. Lightly broiled top of cheese and added crushed tortilla chips...yummy chicken taco pizza!

This made a thin almost crakerlike crust - which is what I prefer.  I did add some oregano to the mix and it was good.  I enjoyed it.

Followed the recipe to a T and wasn't disappointed  with the results at all. The only problem I had was they stuck terribly in the middle and remained soggy but that was a result of the thick heavy pans I used and not the recipe.  I just pried em off the pan and baked them on the rack to fix that problem. I would suggest using your el cheapo thin pan for these. Kids loved the crust declared it to be better than thin crust take out plus its sooo easy to make ;)

Looking for something different I thought I would give this a try. I read other reviews and added more seasoning so it wouldn't taste bland. Don't worry, its not bland. No matter how much seasoning you add it will NEVER mask over the egg taste.

Nice when the house is too cold for yeast to rise. I gave it 4 stars because it is yeast-less, so naturally it will not be quite as good. I did not give it 5 stars because it stayed soggy in the middle (of an 8 inch pan, half recipe.) I absolutely drowned the pan in olive oil knowing it would be sticky, and it still stuck some in the middle. Basically, it is convenient but not good enough for company. Given how easy it is, I will make this again. Next time I will add more flour, and bake to the brink of burnt before I put anything on it. Also I highly recommend using bread flour rather than AP flour.

Wasn't too bad for a yeastless crust. I did modify the recipe a bit. Instead of oregano I used Italian seasoning. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and added 1/2 tbls baking powder, 1 1/2 tbls water & 1 tbls olive oil and only used 1 egg. I used a cooking stone, oiled the edge of the crust with garlic butter and it turned out perfect. Will make this one again.

I didn't change a thing and this recipe baked horribly. Not sure what happened but it fluffed up and didn't form into a nice looking dough. Instead it was a wave here and a wave there.

Turned out AWFUL!!!! Oregano in the dough left a weird texture. During baking, outside of dough crusted and burned while inside was still nearly raw probably from pouring batter and then cooking. I even tried spreading the dough batter out evenly on the baking pan before cooking. Complete waste!

This is my first attempt making yeast-less crust. I probably would never have tried it if my roommate wasn't allergic to yeast. I thought the recipe was decent although maybe a little to be desired. It was rather flat (although I guess I should expect that when no yeast is added) and a bit rubbery (due to the eggs) but overall it wasn't bad. I'd say it isn't my favorite recipe but definitely one worth making again when it  comes to yeast-less crust.

This was a very good quick crust that my family loved however it is quite like a biscuit style so if you are looking for a "pizza shop" crust, this isn't the one for you.  I did omit 1 egg, add 1 tsp of baking powder and no herbs.  We liked it!

I couldn't believe how quick, easy, and delicious this was.  I doubt I'll ever buy another pizza crust.  Tried my own version with diced chicken, chopped spinach, and alfredo sauce with mozzarella cheese topping.  My husband is a picky eater, and he loved it.

It almost never comes out the same way 2x.  I constantly have to add more ingredients to get a better consistency or just pour it in the pan and cook it first.  It never tastes bad its just annoying.

This is a great recipe as-is.  I found more success with having the milk and eggs at room temp- in terms of ease of "spreading".     For variation I added 1/4 t crushed red pepper, and it was nice and zippy.

Admittedly, I'm not the greatest cook in the world, but this was really bad.  I followed the hints given by others - 1 egg and about 1.5 cups of flour.  It ended up being a big glob in the middle of the pan until I tried to pat it down.  Then it was a gooey mess.  It never did spread out in the pan so I ended up with something like really thick pizza crust that remained sort of gummy tasting after about 30-35 minutes of cooking.  I'm actually laughing at this whole situation, figuring it must be something I did since so many others had good luck.

I halved the recipe.  I poured the dough into / baked the pizza in a pan for a toaster oven lined with foil for 15 minutes.  (Don't be alarmed...looks more like batter than dough.) I then pulled it out and pressed the dough down with the back of a spoon (it puffed / bubbled up).  After flattening the pizza, I spooned out pasta sauce and topped with shredded cheese, olives, and sliced turkey and returned to the oven for 10 more minutes.

The pizza was good and satisfied my craving for pizza.  The dough was a good vessel for the pizza toppings.  For next time, I need to make sure I oil the foil liberally because the pizza was sticking.  But overall, good dough that served its purpose.

this recipe was fantastic. I needed to make individual pizzas on a time limit and couldn't wait for a crust to rise.  I did the recommended changes and it turned out fantastic.  The herbs were a good change to a regular crust

I did what many reviewers did and only used 1 egg. My boyfriend observed that the result was more like a lasagna noodle than a pizza crust.  After he made that observation, I had to agree.  Part of this may have something to do with the fact that I made it in a toaster oven (I don't have a regular oven), but I can't say that for sure.  It was a fine recipe, though, and I'll probably make it again.  Like another reviewer said, the "dough" was really runny, but it firmed up just fine when cooking.  I only had one small rectangular tray (for the toaster oven); so I tried pouring half the batter in at a time to make two pizzas.  I miscalculated, and the first has a paper-thin crust while the other had a crust about 1/4" (1/2 cm) thick.  So, please note that you will not be getting a very thick crust regardless of what size pizza you are making.  (Also, please note that I have no measuring instruments in my house for cup, tablespoon, teaspoon; so I was eyeballing all the ingredients.)

Regardless of the potential disappointments, my boyfriend and I were both happy with the outcome for a homemade pizza, and I will likely make this again for us if his diet permits.

Most times I really wonder why people attempts at a recipe failed, but this time I completely understand I made the batter twice. The first time, the batter was way too sticky and I added 1/4 cup of flour and only one egg because of the "egginess" everyone talked about, I also added garlic powder and used a 9 in cake pan ( used margarine to grease pan). Second time I added 1/2 c of flour instead of 1/4 to the original 1 c and still only one egg, still too sticky. the second time i used a cookie sheet checked the bottom and it stuck to the bottom after greasing with margarine (almost ruined it) so i transferred the semi baked pizza dough to another cookie sheet this time greased with shortening and finished baking. overall will not use this recipe again and will try a yeast version instead. also flavor was not evident in the dough and the texture of the bread was a couple notches above cardboard although it did rise a bit but center was not affected.

Will not be making this again. Less a crust and more like a crepe. Omitted one of the eggs as suggested by others and baked it 10 minutes first. Very thin; do not use a large pan! Bland and floppy.

My son who is a mildly picky eater told me this was the best homemade pizza crust he ever tried and wanted me to make it at least once a week! It was nice to have a pizza crust similar to a bread.. more eye filling. Delicious. ( I added fresh Rosemary to add an edge.) It was delicious!

Very nice, and very quick.  Wouldn't really call it a pizza dough but it serves the purpose of being a base to serve pizza toppings on when time is short.  I too added baking powder, more flour, and reduced the egg to one.  Will definitely use again when time is short.  Thanks for sharing! :)

This  crust came out very good, thin and crisp just the way I like it. Usually I use a yeast recipe but today I was out of yeast and decided to give this a try. I added 1cup of oats to the recipe (4x the amounts= 32 servings) and omited half the eggs  and the salt for 1tbs baking powder. Baked for ten min- before adding toppings and baking for another ten min..also added garlic seasoning to dough..came out delish and nutritionally its my favorite dough recipe =)

I added the extra 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp baking powder and only 1 egg. I think the pan I used was too small though. When it was that thick I didn't care too much for the taste. Next time I'll use a bigger pan and add a little more seasoning. Great basics though, I'll keep working with it.

I agree with another reviewer, it's more like flat bread rather than crust.  This is a great base recipe.  fast and tasty with added herbs.  The kids loved it!

Quick and easy. More like a flatbread pizza.  Used only 1 egg, per the other reviews.  Will be making this again!

Thought it was great and easy!  I used one egg after reading reviews. Also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I just use my large skillet for the crust, wrap the handle in foil. Once the crust cooks I take it out add toppings and put in back in the oven with no pan to make a crisper crust.

This was a really good, not to mention super fast and easy dough.  I changed the recipe a little bit.  Used 2 cups of flour and only 1 egg.  Put it in the oven for about 5 minutes, then took it out and spread olive oil and Italian spice on top.  Then I put tomato slices and cheese on top, put it back in the oven for about 10 minutes and then ate it!!   Really good!

I used the suggestions in other comments, used only one egg and added 1tsp of baking powder.  I also used some extra spices. But honestly I thought it was awful. Maybe I will try a recipe that calls for yeast, but now I'm nervous to make a homemade pizza crust.

I made this pizza crust recipe twice and it is a favorite in my house. I did follow another reviewers suggestion.  I replaced the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour and used 2 cups instead of 1 cup, plus additional flour when placing the dough in the pan. I added 1 tbsp Italian seasoning to give the crust an herb flavoring. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder in place of salt, 1 tsp of baking powder, and used 1/4 cup of egg substitute. For the remaining ingredients, I followed the recipe to a tee (oregano, milk, and black pepper that is required in the recipe). I prepared an 11 X 3 pan with canola spray or Baker's Joy (your preference) to prevent the crust from sticking to the pan. After it was in the pan, I baked the crust for 8 minutes. Once baked, I took it out from the oven and added my desired toppings and I then returned it to the oven.  I baked it until the crust and cheese were golden in color (20 minutes or less). The results were tasty. It is a really easy recipe and I like how it does not use yeast.  Also, it tastes better than store bought. I will use this recipe for a long time!

I chose to leave out one of the eggs like others suggested, and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 2 tablespoons of olive oil because I wanted to bake it in a pie plate since we like thick crust and I knew it wouldn't rise and the texture would be off if I didn't use them.  I baked it for 15 minutes, then put on the sauce and cheese.  It actually turned out with really good flavor!  The olive oil helped a lot.  Baked in a pie plate, it turned out very thick too.  I think it would make a great speedy focaccia bread.  Next time I'm going to try stirring in a packet of rapid rise yeast and bake it in a 9 by 13 pan.  I know I changed this recipe a lot, but I'm looking for a quick batter crust recipe to use when I don't have time for normal crust, and this recipe is an excellent base.  Thanks!

It was OK in a pinch, but I would not choose it over regular yeast dough. I used 1 1/2 flour, only 1/2 teaspoon salt, cut out an egg and used a bit of thyme instead of oregano. Came out rather thick, but the consistency was soft, chewy and light but not dough-y. Thanks for the idea, I will probably play around with this in the future! :-)

It was good.  I added 1/2 C WW flour and used both eggs.  Cooked it at 450 for 15 min. until it sounded hollow when I tapped on it.  Added my toppings and baked for 15 more min. and then put it on broil for an additional 10 min.  Very tasty and probably pretty healthy.  Sprayed the bottom with spray and sprinkled corn meal on there before coooking.  No sticking.

This was a very good thin crust, which is what my husband and I like. I used half a cup of whole wheat flour instead of all white and only 1 egg, like other reviewers did. It seemed a little tough - next time I'll try adding baking powder to make it just a bit puffy, like another review said. And it did not need to be baked for 25 min. I will be keeping this one.

Even with 1/2 the egg it tasted really egg-y.  It also stuck to the pan even though I oiled it well.

To prevent sticking I covered my pizza stone with corn flour--no problems at all. I did follow others advice to use only 1 egg, and add extra flour, baking powder and olive oil. Baked 8 minutes, topped and then baked another 15 min. Was easy to make, but not the tastiest dough in the world. It was kind of crumbly instead of a smooth consistency when baked. There wasn't a lot of flavor, even with the addition of lots of spices and garlic.

I took the advice of other reviewers by adding 1/2 C flour, 1 t baking powder, and taking out 1 egg. I separated the dough into two balls - one for me, one for my husband - then rolled them out. We used olive oil whisked with garlic, part-skim mozzarella, and broccoli to top our pies. DELICIOUS! Thanks for this recipe, Karen!

I followed other reviews and used the 1.5tbs of baking powder. I think the salt was a little bit much for my taste. I also added garlic powder and it turned out awesomely garlicy. Mine was a bit sticky and since it's my first time dealing with any kind of dough, I just kept my hands moist when dealing with it. All in all, it was pretty good. :-)

Delicious!! I also modified the recipe quite a bit. I used 1 egg, an extra 1/2C flour, and 1 tsp baking powder as advised by others. The dough was still too sticky to work with so I just kept working the dough with more flour until it didn't stick to my hands. I baked the crust @ 400 for 6 minutes, added toppings (tomato sauce, mozz, olives, frozen broccoli florets on one half, mozz & pepperoni on the other), and cooked it for 8 minutes and then broiled for just over a minute. DELISH!!

I made it for a snack and it turned out very munchy but a little soggy. I would definitely not use 2 eggs but 1 (one) and 1/2 a cup of wheat extra next time! A hint: One should cook until the borders start to get a little burnt so as to add some crunchiness. Worth trying again anyway!

my kids love making and eating this.  Great basic pizza crust recipe.  We add whatever we are in the mood for at the time, oregano, garlic, cheese, etc.  Thank you!  And since the kids can do it themselves, gets me out of the kitchen for a night!  PS - I double the recipe to fit on a large cookie sheet

A definate RERUN and additiom to th weekly menu.

I decided to try this out since I was craving pizza but can't stand dealing with yeast.  I halved the recipe since I wanted something smaller and used whole wheat flour instead of regular.  Mine didn't spread like I expected it to, so I just pressed and spread it with a damp hand.  Baked it about 10 mins without toppings, than an additional 15 minutes with the toppings.  Came out great.  Definitely more like a flat bread, but a great substitute to satisfy those cravings.

OK- this recipe is actually really good...it just took two attempts, my family ended up eating the pizza toppings while waiting for me to make up the second batch! First time round, it wouldn't come off the baking tray- I had to throw one away- although it was on its way out anyway. Second time I put greased baking paper down on the tray first' I recommend this. I also used one egg and a cup and a half of flour, a splash of olive oil. It definately is more flatbread- but don't let that put u off, if u like thin crust u will love this!

Followed the instructions and recommendations of extra flour, 1 egg, and baking powder that others reviewed and it turned out great! I used chicken and a garlic white sauce with mozzarella and it was great.

It's a good yeastless crust.  I used 1/2c wheat flour and 1c white and added 1tsp baking powder. I didn't have oragano so used dried basil instead and it worked well. I baked it 5min w/o toppings and then baked it 10min and broiled it 1.5min with the toppings. It only makes enough for a small pizza (11x7pan)

It didn't work for me to follow the recipe exactly. For an omelette-style breakfast pizza: add another cup of flour, and pre-cook crust for 10 minutes before putting on toppings.  For an actual pizza: use only one egg, 1 1/2 more cups of flour, less baking powder, cook crust for 15 minutes before adding toppings. Or better yet, search Google for a different no-yeast Pizza recipe.

Really good! I added Italian seasoning, garlic salt, garlic powder, and olive oil. 1/3 cup of olive oil in mixture and little drizzle on top of cheese. Just really good.

I followed exactly...edible but not impressed!  Too rubbery in middle.  Recipe not state size of pan...I used a jelly roll pan and I figured the size was to large to tilt pan and spread through out but maybe that would have made it thin enough and crispy.

I made the recipe EXACTLY as stated and it is awesome! The recipe states to POUR the batter, it is supposed to be thin so you can spread it around the baking pan. This is not your typical pizza crust, but it's awesome!

Normally i look at the reviews before i make something i really wish i would have this time.. 2 eggs is way too much.. next time i will only be using 1 egg and about a 3/4 cup extra flour. I had thrown in a tsp baking powder and it did rise nicely but had a really eggy taste.

The dough was runny and stuck to the pan even after it was generously greased.  I could modify it to work, but the recipe is not good as stated.

I never have yeast just "on hand" and this recipe is excellent compared to other crusts. I will say that I too feel more flour, less egg is the approach, and I added more seasonings as well; but overall it was a great crust and I will be using it again!

Great yeastless (aka flatter) crust, but you can still roll over the sides to make it more pizza-like. Definitely follow the baking soda, more flour, less egg suggestions. Will definitely make again!

Took the other suggestions and added a little extra flour and it seemed very dry as well as didn't roll out either.  I think I will stick old school dough using yeast.

I thoroughly enjoyed this....  I want to start a family tradition of saturday night make pizza's and I would have to say this recipe may have started it....  Yes it was similar to a flatbread but a very tasty one, not like in the restaurants.  Instead of Oregano I added Italian seasoning, Garlic Powder, and Onion powder...  More Garlic and Onion then Italian....  A++++  I did the cook 10 minutes on either side then it actually sat on the counter well I was at work all day....  and only added one egg like others had mentioned!!!!!!!  I poured it on to a small cookie sheet and used a greased spoon and my fingers to manuveur it into place wiping the edges at the top of the cookie sheet for sure stick(there was no grease there)  Good Luck!

Pretty good! As others have said, it is not the pizza crust you'd expect as it is baked without yeast. But for my first homemade pizza crust it was great! I used about a 1/4-1/2 cup more flour and used less milk, about a half cup. Also, I used italian seasoning instead of oregano, and added a little garlic and onion powder to the dough. I also added a small amount of baking powder. It got pretty sticky so I had to use a lot of flour for kneading and rolling. Lots of fun, I will make pizza dough again, probably with yeast though if I have the time.

My son's allergic to eggs, so I always have to tweak a lot of recipes I find on here.  This was a great start though.  Instead of eggs, I used two tablespoons of ground flax seed and some extra milk.  I also used bread flour rather than regular flour to make it a little firmer, since I didn't have the eggs to help with the structure.  Hubby approved!  My son wouldn't eat it, but that was just because he saw something green in the pasta sauce LOL.  Look forward to trying it out again soon.

I thought i'd try this just to do something different.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and it turned out edible but strange.  From other reviews i knew not to expect a crust that was like regular yeast pizza crust, but this was different in a not so good way.  I poured the dough it into a greased cookie sheet, baked it for 10 minutes and flipped it like others advised.  It turned out crispy around the edges but rubbery/soggy in the middle. I don't know how you'd put topping on this dough without baking it first - it's almost like pancake batter!   Anyway, maybe using one less egg might help? I probably won't try it, though... i'll just use my regular pizza crust recipe - it's not that difficult to make!

Was not crazy about this dough, only because it doesn't fulfill ones need for pizza. It was also very crumbly. Might make an interesting base for some over recipe.

It's really wet. It's not a traditional crust... It's not bad if you add the extra flour, but not what would be expected.

I really liked this and was super easy. My crust actually came out pretty thick. I aded a bunch of italian seasonings and used the 1 egg and baking poweder. the pizza is more of a bisquet consistency than dough, but nonetheless, will still make again

I loved this recipe! I just made some tonight and it came out great. It was a little heavy, but the plus side of that is that was very filling. I made some modifications: I used whole wheat flour, I added about an extra cup of flour, used only one egg, put in a tsp of baking powder, put in a lot of oregano and garlic powder into the dough. I let the crust bake in the oven for about 5-10 minutes and then took it out and sprayed some canola oil spray on the crust and added tomato sauce and cheese and more oregano. I then put the pizza into the oven for another 5-10 minutes and when I checked up on it I noticed that the crust was fully cooked. Next time I'll try to put a little bit less flour to make it a little lighter. Thank you for a great recipe!

Like the recipe said, the crust was really easy to make.  However, it didn't suit my tastes.  I thought it was a little bit rubbery (which could have been my fault, I'm not a chef by any means) and very bland.  I also didn't like that the dough was really more like a batter.  It made all of my ingredients sink down to the bottom of the pan, which made my pizza look very awkward.  Basically, in a pinch this would do, but I wouldn't want to entertain with it.

This did not work out well for me. First it was hard to spread around the pan because the greased pan prevented it from staying in one place. Then the edges were too thin so got burnt, and the middle was sort of soggy. In the end it reminded me of a pizza crepe. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it actually tasted ok. My 2 year old gobbled it up. I won't make again though.

Dough was very heavy. Fallowed the recipe exactly as directed. I think I'll stick to yeast dough.

I made a double recipe of this the first time I made it.  I doubled everything except the eggs - instead of doubling two eggs, I used three because so many had suggested using only one egg. The first crust actually GREW instead of shrinking like most do.  The other, on a thinner cookie sheet, did shrink slightly. The kids LOVED it and went on and on about the crust.  I also sprayed the pan heavily, and used a bit of cornmeal sprinkled on it to prevent sticking.  Easy, quick, and tasty!  We'll be using this again!

This really was a disappointment to me, I'm confused as to how others got such great results.  I made this recipe as directed and first of all, the flavor just wasn't there at all, needs ALOT more seasonings.  Secondly, it stuck to my greased, non-stick coated pan horribly and upon prying out the pizza with an array of kitchen utensils, it ruined my good pan :(  I will not be using this recipe again, but hey, other people had excellent results so give it a try!  (use an old pan)

I have to admit that it did stick, but it was quick and easy and tasted great. A word of advice... greese and floor your pan and don't use a sause. The sause will be asorbed by the dough and then the dough will be doughy. Just put your tiopping directly onto the dough and it will turn out perfect. Great for people who like the thin crispy crust. I have made several pizzas using this recipe now and love it.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and used only one egg, 1/2 cup more flour, and waited to add the toppings.  I baked the crust for 10 minutes, then took it out and added some cooked chicken, mozzarella cheese, and pasta sauce.  I then stuck it back in the oven for another 8 minutes on "broil".

I made the chicken in a skillet with vegetable oil, a little garlic powder, and some dill weed flakes.  I ended up with a pretty thick crust, but I think it was because I poured the batter into a smaller circular pan.

Sprayed the pan really well with vegetable oil spray, and had no problem with it sticking.

Overall, this was an excellent recipe that I will DEFINITELY do again.  It lends itself to so many easy varieties of toppings, and was a snap to whip up.

For the sheer simplicity of it all, this was FANTASTIC!  I had no yeast and had such a craving for pizza so this was a lifesaver!  I used one egg, as others suggested, (though 2 might have been fine because I had to spread the dough out it was so thick).  I think one made it more like a pita bread and two might make it more like a dough.  Also, I went nut-so on seasoning the dough with oregano, basil and garlic powder, (it was practically green when I was done with it), and it was great!  Thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good, my husband and I liked it, however I would have cooked it a little longer, it wasn't as crisp as I like! Great homeade pizza when you have no yeast.

I give it 5 stars for the idea of it, and for making this recipe for me to try!!   I added a cup more flour and doubled the milk   so it would spread in the pan.  I also spread some olive oil on the pan and then floured it, and my pizza crust did not stick at all :)  With the right toppings this is a great and easy dinner when I want to make something easy!! Will use this recipe over and over again! THANKS

This is a great tasting recipe, and about the sticking to the pan? Just add cornmeal to the bottom of the pan, and it will not stick so much. Oh, and I also added 2 1/4 more cups of flour to make it easier to handle, I am sure that helped as well.

I was hoping I could put 5 stars, but it stuck in the pan so badly, I couldn't. I made it exactly like the recipe even though I was tempted to make a couple of the changes that others made. But I thought I'd give the recipe a fair chance. Don't know what made mine stick. Otherwise, it was fairly good.

Like the other person had mentioned this is NOT like pizza crust but it is REALLY good. I make it and let everyone put their own toppings on. A great recipe especially since yo'uve almost always got an egg and some flour. Thank you for share this recipe with us. It is a keepoer for sure.

This is a good pizza crust recipe if you don't have any yeast. I added 1/2 cup more flour and only used 1 egg, as others suggested, and also baked it for 10 minutes before topping it (also suggested by others). I also added my own selection of spices (sage, garlic powder, and an Italian herb blend) to it. I'll probably use this recipe again.

This was a huge waste of ingredients. It turned out similar to a cracker. Which honestly didn't taste that bad because I loaded it with spices. HOWEVER, I well oiled the pan with E.V.O.O. and it still stuck so bad. The batter was so liquidy I had to add way more flour then it was just this gloopy mess.  I instead made another recipe for pizza dough that came with my Kitchenaid. Much better.

I did not care for the taste of this at all.  It was a thin crust (obviously) but had a very strange flavor to it, and the texture of the bottom of the crust was kind of crumbly but not really... very odd.  I won't be making this again.

I made this out of necessity as I forgot to pick up refrigerated pizza dough at the store and I had no yeast to make regular pizza dough.  I wish I'd just skipped it all together.  This dough really has no flavor, even with the seasonings, and 20 min. was way to long to bake it.  It was overdone and tough.
Sorry, but my family just didn't care for this one.

We loved this! It's easy, and with some modifications, it is actually better than any yeasted dough we've tried to make at home. We followed others' suggestions and used only one egg, and we increased the flour by almost a half cup. We also tried using half whole wheat flour, and it turned out great too. We have a special pizza pan with holes in the bottom to crisp the crust, so we didn't have to flip it like some did half way through baking. It does make a bit of a mess on the bottom of the pan when you spread the dough on it, but it cleans up easily. Bottom line, we won't use any other dough recipe. We loved it.

I've made this twice so far this week (using one egg and adding more flour, flipping halfway through cooking), and it came out great both times. The second time, I added some fresh shredded basil and parmesan cheese, which complemented my toppings very nicely. This crust makes a tasty last-minute pizza.

It was quick and easy to make, so-so tasty, but the edges almost burnt. I did flip the dough half-way through.... I think the pizza was so tasty because of the toppings I chose! Easy, though. And my son ate it up!

Well, it was fun and VERY easy to make, but I think next time, i'll try using only one egg, and (as suggested by another rater)I will try flipping it over and then adding the toppings. Better luck next time, I hope!

I like the fact that this is a no-rise crust that is pizzaria quality without the waiting.  I found it just a bit bland, so will add a bit more salt next time (up to 1tsp?).  I put the toppings on and started to bake the pizza before realizing I was supposed to pre-bake, and it still turned out just fine.

This was pretty good. I think I'll stick to my yeast dough, but it was good for a quick pizza fix. I used 1 egg, whole wheat flour. Baked untopped for 10min on cookie sheet, them removed to a pizza screen and added toppings, cooked about 12min more.

Just made this. I made double quantity because my pan was huge, but only used 2 eggs total. Threw in heaps of italian herbs and a splash of olive oil as someone recommended. 

After I scraped it in the pan (mine wasn't so runny.. (not doughy either though) I grated a clove of garlic over the top, cooked it for 10 mins, added tomato, ham, pineapple, mushroom , beans and cheese, then cooked for another 10 mins.

Base was simple and great, although if I had done the second bake on a grill instead of in the pan, I think the texture would have been nicer in the middle.

This is definitely more like flat bread, but it was still very good. I used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. white flour, added garlic powder and Italian seasoning mix in the dough mixture. Great stuff!

Very easy and worked well in a pinch. Seemed like it would be much better with more spices. I will try adding a few next time I try it.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I was short on time and was looking for a pizza crust that I could make without having to mess with yeast. Not only was this a snap to make, it was better than any other homemade crusts in the past. You are a genius!

Its not like your topical pizza dough. This pours into the pan, and the crust is very tasty. I plan to make this again!

I've made this for my boyfriend and roommate.  Both of them said it was great stuff.  I mixed some extra spices into the dough, as well as garlic, parmesian cheese, and asiago cheese.  I also substituted a little of the all purpose flour for wheat flour to make it a little bit healthier

This recipe turned out great!  Granted, I am the type of person that prefers thin crusts.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations of using only 1 egg and baking the crust first before adding the toppings.  I doubled the recipe for one crust in a medium-sized rimmed cookie sheet.   The crust was so easy and effortless -- I am so happy to have found this recipe.

Excellent recipe ... my husband loves the thin crust, and my teenagers enjoy making it.  I have been making a similar recipe since I was in 4-H 30-some years ago. For those who had sticky pan issues, we have always dusted the greased pan with cornmeal.

I was looking for a fast crust and this was it!  I doubled the recipe and just used 2 eggs instead of 4.  I also added garlic and basil to the crust.  My husband loved it!  I baked the crust for 10 minutes before I added the toppings-I highly recommend doing that.

This was a life saver.  I opened a premade pizza crust I had just bought and it was already moldy.  Most of the crust recipes called for yeast which I didn't have.  This made a great quick substitute.  I had to increas the batter by a half in order to cover the pan.  Also, I didn't get the batter evenly spread so it didn't cook evenly.  Easily fixed next time.

This recipe was awesome!  Even my 11 yr. old son made it and it was perfect.  At first i thought something was wrong because the dough came out soopy but that is the way it is supposed to be.  Will make this pizza crust all the time.  The crust actually had flavor!  Five stars!

I chose this recipe because I wanted to try to make a calzone and I didn't feel like spending $4 on the refridgerated pizza dough when I had all these ingredients at home. I pretty much followed the recipe except I added garlic. It wasn't the greatest pizza crust. At first it seemed to rise nicely, but then it just seemed to stay flat and thin. You also should really really spray your pan. It seems to be a very basic crust but I will probably try it again and tinker with the recipe.

I really enjoyed making this and adding different seasonings in the crust.  I coated the pan with melted, low-fat margarine and it made it a little crispier around the edges.  It is "crazy" though! It bubbled up and went up the side of the pan (I used an rectangular baking pan) but once you put the toppings and things on it, it turns out great!

Not good at all.  Dough was way to "eggy"  Tasted like an omlette and not pizza dough.  Gross combo with sauce and cheese.  Will not make again.

Also had problems with it bubbling up.

This was more of a BATTER than anything... I had to add AT LEAST 2 1/2 more cups of flour.  This didn't even slightly resemble pizza dough, but it makes a good flatbread!

This recipe was great.  I promised my daugther pizza for supper.  I went to the freezer and there was no frozen pizza, so I went to Allrecipes.com and found this recipe.  It's the only one I could find that didn't require yeast.  My kids ate it up.  Thank you I will make this again.

I was making pizza for my family and had to throw away two things of dough that I had made/bought... this was great in a pinch, and worked. It is a little strange, and not for you if dough is a big deal to you, but for us the toppings are the focus of the pizza. The dough is merely something to bake the toppings on, and this one tasted good.

This was more of a batter than a dough to start out with, and the ending product was not what I had hoped for.  Yeast seems to be the way to go for pizza crust!

Great crust in a pinch, and way easier to make than the kind you have to knead.  I will make it again and again, with different variations depending on the toppings I have.  I added about 1/4 c. more flour, as well as some garlic powder.

My first time preparing pizza dough. I thought it tasted great! I had to add about 2 more cups of flour- to get it not so sticky, but it still tasted great. I cooked it in the oven for about 12 minutes, and meanwhile stir fried bell peppers, sausage, onions and broccoli. I took the crust/dough out of the over and put just traditional pasta sauce on top, then spread around the stir fry and smothered mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan cheese on top. YUM!

The texture of this dough is like biting into a block of cheddar cheese.  Was still pretty good tasting.  In addition to the oregano, I added garlic powder, onion powder, and a bit of paprika to this dough.  My husband and I enjoyed it and it was quick and easy to make when I didn't have any yeast.  Will definately make again.

At first it fluffed up as I baked it and I thought I did something wrong but it flattened out when I added the toppings and came out pretty good. Most recipies ask for yeast but this recipie is very simple and recommended for anyone that's learning to make pizza fir the first time.

Quite a different recipe, but that doesn't mean it won't taste great. i was in a frantic search to find a pizza recipe without yeast. i'm so glad i came upon this.

Excellent and Easy! My 20-month-old daughter isn't a big fan of pizza, either store-bought or restaurant, but she gobbled down her dinner! I used a muffin pan to make mini pizzas and she ate 2....amazing! Next time I'll try a full-size pizza. thanks!!

Not what I was looking for.  It was kind of like a crepe, as someone else already said, and was pretty bland and flat.  I did like the idea of putting oregano in the crust, though.

i thought this was a wonderful recipe, my mother and everyone i have had try it absolutely love it!  I have followed everyone else's advice and i cook the dough for about 10 minutes or so to get it a lil more crispy.  I also add a few more spices like basil and such.  I love the way the crust folds up, makes it really yummy and crispy.  Very good :)

Surprixingly not bad at all!!! So very easy to make!!!  It doesn't hold the sauce and cheese very well, but good fork eating pizza if you want pizza!!!  I wasn't feeling well yesterday, and really didn't feel liek cooking, so I tried this and was shocked! I'd make this again if I didn't have yeast on hand or just wanted something quick and simple to make!

This recipe is not your normal pizza crust texture.  It is more like a pasta or thick crepe.  I took other peoples advise and cooked the crust about 10 min. before adding the toppings.  I really loaded it with toppings and baked until the cheese was bubbly.  It was o.k. and perfect when you don't have time to make a real pizza crust.

Sorry but this was not good. I made bbq chicken pizza using this crust. It was not a pleaser. Will definately not make again.

This recipe is quick and easy. I was skeptical at first since it is batter and not dough but after reading the insteuctions a few times to make sure it was correct, it was a piece of cake. My family loved the dough and it was fun. It did bubble around the edges but my pizza pan was not very large. My husband liked it so much he bought me a bigger pizza pan so next time the crust will fold over in the correct spot. If you follow the directions to a T then you should have a delicious pizza crust!
