I figured out how to make these the best bran muffins ever!  The trick is to use fancy molasses rather than blackstrap or other types.  Fancy molasses seems to be less intense in flavor.  Also add 2 tbsp. of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. of cinnimon.  Yummy!

Lovely, earthy flavor to these muffins, due to the molasses. This recipe is less sweet than most, because there is no sweetening other than the molasses. For those who don't appreciate a strong molasses flavor, consider using half dark corn syrup or honey to replace half of the molasses called for. But leave in at least half for the subtle flavor contribution and deep color. If you like a sweeter muffin, add 2 Tb sugar, either brown or white. For those who had trouble with a runny batter, allow the bran to soak in the milk for 10 minutes before mixing. I used sour milk and cut the soda back to 1 tsp, which is sufficient for a recipe of this size. 1-1/2 tsp, particularly if you use fresh milk (as opposed to buttermilk or sour milk) could be contributing to the off-flavor some have reported. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, because I just like it in my muffins. I brushed the tops with a drop of honey as they came out of the oven, adding a slight punch of sweetness and a beautiful sheen. Already ate one fresh from the oven, and it was stellar! Be aware that these do not rise very much. What you see when you spoon the batter into the muffin tins is pretty much what you get coming out of the oven. So don't be afraid to fill nearly to the top. It made 12 very full muffins. All in all, an excellent recipe! Edited 10/14/08 to add that these are excellent keepers. Four days after baking, they are still remarkably  moist, almost as good as freshly baked. A+

Delicious bran muffin recipe!  This a a great way to use up the last of the All-Bran cereal and sneak something healthy into my husband's diet at the same time.  I used 1/4 cup of molasses, 2 Tbsp. of dark brown sugar and 2 Tbsp. of honey.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 Tbsp. of vanilla.  I let the wet ingredients soak into the bran cereal along with the raisins for about 10 minutes before adding the dry ingredients and the batter wasn't runny at all. This made 12 muffins that rose up nicely, were very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness.

This was a very easy bran muffin recipe. It was moist and full of flavor.  I did 1/4 cup each of molasses and honey instead of 1/2 c. molasses, just a preference.  I also added some ground flaxseed 2TB (which acts like oil in baking) (so 1TB of canola oil was enough).  These muffins are very good, and have good flavor.  I was a little worried about the batter looking kinda runny at first, but the flakes soak it up pretty fast and they turn out just fine.

This recipe makes excellent muffins. I've made them with coconut added as well. However, I suspect that the 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda should actually be 1 teaspoon of baking powder plus 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, as is common in most recipes. The extra baking soda could account for the unusual taste detected by some of the reviewers.

These were yummy. I added 1/2 t cinnamon and vanilla.  Also, to make them healthier,  I used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 cup wheat germ, and instead of raisins, 1 cup blueberries, and topped then with oats.

For people with anemia, this is a great recipe. Blackstrap molasses is the only molasses that is high in iron. I did change it up the 2nd time around to create a low fat muffin. I used sugar free instant flavored oatmeal instead of the bran, no additional sugar needed, but if you wanted to you could sub it for splenda. And instead of using 2 tbl spoons of oil, I used 1 tbl sp oil, and 3 tbl spoons of applesauce. The muffins tastes better hot. And each muffin comes out to 3 grams of fat and 92 calories. 2 muffins a day for a week, brings your iron back up and your energy as well. And it also helps with those who have IBS,like myself.

My grandmother made the best bran muffins in the world. I have been looking for a recipe like hers and this is it. I used whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup of wheat germ to make them fiber healthy. I also add more molasses and raisins, and then added vanilla and cinnamon like grammy did. This lends to a tastier, heartier, healthier muffin. These are wonderful warm spread with real melted butter.

Pretty good!  I used whole wheat flour and substituted apple sauce for the oil just for a little extra healthiness.  Also I didn't have raisins on hand, so I used an equal amount of cinnamon chips instead which was a nice taste.

I LOVED this recipe! The muffins are so moist and delicious, you'd never even guess they were good for you. I followed one person's instructions and added a pinch of cinnamon and YUM! You have to like the taste of molasses though, which I do. Thanks for such a wonderful, healthy recipe! I will make it again and again.

I took these muffins to a party and they were a big hit.  They are so healthy, but they taste great and I ended up giving the recipie out to everyone there.  These were a nice contrast to everything else at the party egs. cookies, pies, etc.  The batter was really runny, which freaked me out a little bit, but all turned out good.

We made this recipe as it stands.  We used Brer Rabbit full flavor molasses and Wheaties cereal.  Maybe this was a problem.  They are moist, but they are not very flavorful at all.  Mostly molasses taste.  We could barely taste the raisins.

I made this recipe. Changes: 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda (according to other reviewers), changed milk to buttermilk, changed molasses to half molasses and half honey for a lighter flavor. I also changed the raisins to chopped dates and added a cup of chopped pecans. I used generic bran flakes cereal and crushed them in a ziploc baggie, then let the batter rest a few minutes to soggy up the cereal. These were so fabulous, I can't tell you. Delicious with peanut butter on them. With a small drizzle of honey on the split halves, they were reminiscent of baklava, chewy with nuts and good honey flavor. Weird but true. I baked them in Pam sprayed Pyrex custard cups and got 10 big muffins. They slid right out with a lovely color and an almost glazed crust due to the molasses and honey content.

It was good. I didn't use bran flakes, just regular bran. I had to add a little extra flour to get them a bit thicker. I also mashed up a ripe banana and added it to the mixture to make them a little more moist. Topped with brown sugar and these are great!

DO NOT USE PAPER MUFFIN CUPS WHEN BAKING THESE!!! I just made 22 muffins wrapped in cups and they're almost impossible to remove!! Other than that, the muffins themselves taste pretty good. A little bland - add honey or sugar for sure if you aren't into less intense flavours. Or use a sweet jam when eating.

These were a mess. Batter was very runny, didn't
rise, ran all over the top of the muffin pan.  I checked the ingredients and I made them correctly. My soda was new, so it wasn't that. I just threw them away.

Very easy to make...the kids and I loved them!  I too, was leery of how runny the batter was, but they baked up beautifully.

I prefer my bran muffins a bit sweeter, so next time around I am going to add 1T of brown sugar and double the amount of raisins.

Definitely a keeper!

These cooked really weirdly...all of the molasses sunk to the bottom of each tin. I think the batter was too thin: needed more flour and less milk! However, they had a pleasant taste after an addition of brown sugar

These were tasty and were not dry, but did not have a nice "muffin" texture either.  They tasted like your typical lowfat muffin/cake made with little or no oil, a little gummy.  If you don't mind that, this is a great recipe.  Just don't expect to fool anyone who doesn't like the lowfat stuff.   I had to eat the entire batch myself, but I would probably still make again for a healthy breakfast/snack.

Dense, flavorful muffins that aren't too sweet.  I made the following additions to the recipe:  substituted Total multi-grain cereal flakes for bran flakes.  Used 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Added 1 teaspoon each of vanilla, powdered ginger, powdered allspice, and cinnamon.  Tastes just like a molasses cookie!  Also recommend stirring the raisins into the wet ingredients first and letting them sit for a couple of minutes.  They "plump up" nicely.  End product is tasty and healthful and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Blah - didn't care for these at all.  They smelled fantastic while cooking and I was very excited to try one but, unfortunately they didn't taste nearly as good as they smelled.  Sorry - just not my thing, I guess.  (though I usually do like bran muffins...)

Very good recipe. I added 1/4 c. dried kiwi, 1/4 c. dried mango, 1 container baby food plums, 1/8 c. whole flax seeds, 1/8 c. hemp hearts, and an extra 1/4 c. flour. I used whole grain spelt for all of the flour and they taste great!
I didn't fill the cups full enough so I ended up with 14.

I just made these. They are the best bran muffins I have ever made. I used half honey & half molasses. Also instead of raisins I used dried pineapple & dried bananas. I am a cookl in a retirement home & I am going to serve these often.  Try them. You will love them.  What a great way to get your fiber & actually enjoy it.

It's an ok bran muffin, wasn't that tasty and I like health nut food. A little too much salt and baking soda taste for me.

This is a great recipe!!  I use half molasses and half agave syrup, and I used soy milk instead of milk.  Came out great.  I added crushed drained pineapple - my family loved them!!!  Thank you so much for submitting the recipe.

They just came out of the oven, and they are delicious.  If you are a fan of bran muffins like the ones you get from a coffee shop, then this is the recipe you're looking for.  I added 2 T of brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey.  I also let the flakes and raisins soak in the liquid for 10 minutes before adding the flour mixture.  Brushed the tops with honey.  I added more raisins too.  I highly recommend.

These were very good.  I did add 2 Tbs sugar.  They had a strange but attractive shiny top.  Another review said that the muffins don't rise much, so you can fill the muffin cups up.  I may have taken that advice to literally, as my muffins overflowed the pan and left a mess.  I would say leave at least 1/2 inch for growing.  Also, I baked some with paper liners, and some without.  The muffins without liners had a better shape and came out of the pan really easily.  I misted the pan with Pam for Baking.  Nice recipe, I will make again, and the kids liked it.

These are really good!  I have quite a sweet tooth, and although these muffins aren't particularly sweet, I didn't find them to need any extra sweetener.  The only change that I made was that I used 1tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda instead of 1.5 tsp baking soda.  With that little change, this recipe is awesome.  I will definitely make these muffins again.

These were tasty and got good reviews from my roommates. They came together pretty easily, and no muffin liners were necessary (after spraying the tin with cooking spray). When I make them again, I'll try replacing one of the tablespoons of oil with applesauce, and use the extra calories to sprinkle some brown sugar on top.

These made good, filling muffins full of fiber for my breakfasts this week-great recipe.  I may try substituting applesauce for the oil, as one reviewer said, but they're great the way they are.  Love that slight molasses flavor!

I added frozen blueberries to the muffin mix and about 1/3 cup flour. The molasses hangs on the palate. Could be a tid-bit sweeter.

Really good. If you use paper liners, make sure you let them cool completely or they will stick. I used applesauce in place of the oil. I added frozen blueberries, but will leave them plain and add some cinnamon next time. I brushed the tops with honey - as another reviewer suggested. These are super moist. Will be making these often.

Great tasting, healthy muffins!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white...for a little extra health kick.  Very moist!  Also, not too sweet.  Of course, it's probably because I forgot to add the raisins/craisins before baking and the recipe doesn't remind you to add them to the batter.  Still yummy, though!

Delicious, they're moist  with wonderful texture.  It has  just enough sweetness from the raisins and the perfect amount of molasses that adds the flavor without overwhelming the muffins.    This is a keeper!

Almost perfect! I am so in love with commercial raisin bran muffins! Those moist, sweet, slightly sticky and rich morsels are heaven!
I made these and can never follow a recipe exactly -  I probably used 2 1/4 cups raisin bran and had no milk in the house so I omitted the oil and used eggnog. I also used 2 eggs and opted to add cinnamon, vanilla and 1 tsp baking powder with 1/2 tsp soda.
They are so delicious. I will definitely make again and again.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. That deep, dark, molasses taste that I remember from my younger years. I did follow some changes that other reviewers recommended. I did add 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and I changed the baking soda instead to a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder. I also added 1/4 cup of white sugar. I filled the muffin papers pretty much to the top, and they rose straight up a little bit. It was perfect. The husband does not like raisins, so instead I used blueberries. Using cooking molasses, it really is a deep molasses taste, which isn't for everyone, so I also made a second batch of these, using further changes that people suggested. In this batch, I kept my changes the same as written above in my review, however, instead of the 1/2 cup of molasses, I used 1/4 cup of the molasses + 1/4 cup of white corn syrup. This also turned out extremely well, however I think next time I would leave the white sugar out as the corn syrup seem to help with the sweetness enough. This version is great for people who like a more subtle molasses taste. Also, make sure that you soak your bran (I used the Original All Bran, crushed somewhat) in the milk/oil/ eggs/vanilla mixture for at least 10 minutes or you will end up with a very soupy batter - the bran needs to absorb & be a bit mushy. A great recipe, for me there is no other now!

As per the most helpful review. I added the 2 tbsp of brown sugar but did not add the cinnamon. I will also have to adjust the baking time as mine were a little overdone by 18 minutes.

Our family absolutely loves these muffins. I have probably made this recipe over 2 dozen times. The only thing we change is to sub out half the molasses for brown sugar, a tsp. cinnamon and a dash of cloves. Half a cup of raisins seems like a lot for 12 muffins so put a 1/4 cup. Perfect every time and the kids gobble them up!!!

Update from previous post: they turned out beautiful!! Very strong molasses flavor. Nice texture. Next time I will add more raisins and maybe nuts or chopped dried apples. I like the pineapple idea someone had!

Did not use raisins, but walnuts instead. Sweet enough for my tastes and nutritional.

I didn't make any changes.  I was very disappointed--I guess I should have known that this wasn't the recipe for me when I saw only 1 cup of flour.  I'll look for another recipe more to my liking.

I am just eating one fresh out of the oven now.  Very good muffin.  The batter was quite runny when they went into the oven but they baked up just fine.  You can definitely taste the molasses so if you don't like that, maybe do the 1/2 molasses and 1/2 honey.  I added 2 tbsp. of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as recommended.

I made this muffin in attempts to find a tasty way to add iron to my diet - it was great! I used cashew/almond milk in place of the milk and blackstrap molasses instead of regular (way more iron and health benefits). Also cut out the raisins (personal preference). The muffins were moist and flavourful. So dark they look like chocolate muffins!

4 4 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/47146/molasses-bran-muffins/ ... 'Read most, if not all, the reviews & pretty much stuck with the recipe with the exception of Fiber One for flakes & adding 1t cinnamon.  Oh, no raisins.  Initially, I thought "sweet enough;" then, after having, thought "just a bit too sweet."  So thinking, maybe with raisins would be too-too sweet.  Fiber One doesn't have any sugar in it.  These smelled better than they tasted, but they taste good; not amazing though; not one for the records.  :D  Tip: Spray your liners & you'll get the benefit of not sticking as well as a bit o'buttery flavor.  Who doesn't like that?!?  :D ... Oh, the regular vs blackstrap molasses thing.  I don't know what I had.  It just said "unsulphured" & maybe "original".  The muffs didn't scream "molasses," but, then again, bran is a powerful force that can cover other flavors well.

I've had gastric bypass, and love to bake, bad combination.  I've been craving sugar free muffins and have a hard time finding them in my local stores.  I cannot eat sugar period.  I just make this recipe.  I wanted a good moist muffin that would satisfy my sweet tooth and serve as a breakfast meal with my coffee.  I changed the recipe, baking powder instead of baking soda, I put the flakes through the food processor to break them up (adding more flavor), I added 2 tbls of butter along with the oil, 1/4 of artificial sweetener, and used almond milk instead of cows milk.  First run result, very moist and lighter than I expected.  Next run, I'll add some cinnamon for additional flavor, walnuts, and whey protein powder to boost the nutritional content.

I used Craisins instead of raisins, but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out great!  The muffins tend to stick to the papers, so one must be careful, but that's the only problem.

Delicious muffins like my grandmother used to make.
I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers; I used only 1/4 c. molasses, and added 2 Tb. honey & 2 Tb. brown sugar.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I used bran buds  instead of bran flakes.

These are pretty tasty, and a good way to use up that Raisin Bran cereal that's been sitting in the pantry. I used whole wheat flour. I subbed half the molasses with honey as suggested by another reviewer- they were still flavorful with less molasses. I also used half coconut/almond milk and half whole milk instead of the skim. I completely omitted the oil. I probably would have added a few more raisins to mine-but I didn't measure them as they were already mixed with the cereal. The batter is very runny, so use a bowl that's easy to pour from, and make sure the cereal flakes get evenly distributed- my first pour was mostly the runny part, until I figured out I should be spooning some of the bulkier part of the mixture as I poured.

This mixture was like soup. I had to use a ladel to put it in the muffin pan.  I was very skeptical about them baking up but they did and are somewhat tasty.

I was looking for a delicious, dark bran muffin, and I think I found it! It's also very moist. I used whole wheat flour in place of the white flour and dried cranberries instead of raisins. For the milk, I used the dry buttermilk that you put into the dry ingredients and a specified amount of water for the liquid. I did one cup of this and added 1/4 cup regular milk. I followed Jillian's recommendations to soak the bran cereal and craisins with the wet ingredients for 10 min. To that I added the combined dry ingredients, which included 2 tblsp of freshly ground flax seed. Other changes: 1/4 cup molasses, 2 tblsp brown sugar, 2 tblsp honey, 1 tblsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. I made these into six jumbo muffins and they rose just about to the top of the cups. Baking time was 14 min, and they were perfect, with a little butter, of course!

*Update:  I would have updated this sooner but was too busy doing a happy dance.   For the second batch I used all molasses and let the cereal soak about 2 hours. PERFECTION.  Absolute perfection.  With coffee on a chilly morning, heaven!*  Original review:  This is an amazing bran muffin.  Even leaving out the oil (I used fat free Greek yogurt instead) they were so moist - so unusual for a fat-free muffin!   I was specifically looking for a  muffin recipe with molasses, then was dismayed to find I had much less molasses in the pantry than I thought, so I had to use half honey.  Still tasty, but can't wait to make them again using all molasses, I think they will be perfect.  The batter is runny, even though I let the cereal soak for 15 minutes, so all my raisins  fell to the bottom - may try letting the cereal soak for much longer.  I did use 1 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp powder, all whole wheat flour, and store-brand raisin bran cereal.  For those reviewers that claim these muffins are too blah, it may be the cereal.  My muffins tasted like raisin bran; if I had used a blander type, or just plain bran or oatmeal, I can imagine they would be somewhat lackluster.  Also, if you are looking for a bran muffin that is closer to a pumpkin or zucchini muffin with cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, etc. flavors, you'll be disappointed unless you specifcally add them.  But if you are after a traditional, old-fashioned bran muffin, this is it!  FANTASTIC plain, with butter, or cream cheese!!!

Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe, Mindy.  I've been searching for something similar to the bran muffins Mom made way back when and this one is oh-so-close! Mom's Alzheimer's has caused her to forget both the recipe and where she had put her recipe box.  I read all the reviews and added a bit of brown sugar.  Should not have done that.  Next time I'll use dark molasses and omit the brown sugar.  Thanks again!!!

These were great. I substituted unsweetened almond milk for regular milk, applesauce for the oil and did the 1 tsp soda 1/2 tsp powder as most people recommended and they came out just awesome.

Love the rich molasses flavour!  Used almond milk plus 1 Tbsp vinegar instead of buttermilk, added 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Like some others, I found the batter quite runny.  I did let the bran cereal sit for a few minutes and then mixed in the dry ingredients.  With it so runny, I added about 2 Tbsp ground flax seed and ~1/3 cup natural wheat bran.  Still was quite runny but it baked up beautifully.

I loved the flavor of these muffins but abhorred the texture. I had to "choke them down" (so-to-speak). Anyone have any ideas on improving the texture? Maybe by adding a different grain? I like muffins that have crispy tops and are more cake-like in the middle.

This is a very simple and easy recipe to whip up.  I've found these muffins really helpful in my post Christmas weightloss...they are very filling.  I thought I had Bran Flakes but I only had the origincal All Bran (the stick) kind and it worked just as well!

My mom makes a very similar bran muffin, using All-Bran cereal and blackstrap molasses. She replaces the raisins (or adds to) with sultanas, and also adds walnuts. I think she may also add a dash or two of nutmeg, or allspice. I imagine these would be good replacing some, or all, of the oil with butternut squash or pumpkin puree. Nice autumnal touch anyway. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a hit in my house - they don't last long once they are out of the oven.. Everyone eats them and no one realizes how healthy they are!! I've substituted dried cranberries for the raisins a few times, and they are just as good.

While making the batter for these I kept saying there was no way these were going to turn out - the batter was very watery but they came out moist, chewey and very tasty.  Only complaint was they were too molassesey.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of molasses and use a combination of molasses and honey (maple syrup or mashed banana would be nice too).  Only things I altered were I used 2tbsp of apple puree instead of the oil, added a cup of raisins instead of a half and I cut back on the baking soda as another reviewer suggested.  I might crush the bran flakes next time too - see what that does to the recipe.

These are great muffins that my kids love.  This is a good way of getting iron for the non meat eaters.

Another happy customer!   These make for a delicious, low-calorie breakfast.   I omitted the raisins (by request).   I'll bet dates or dried currants would also be tasty but DBF wanted "plain" this time.  Substituted 1T of ground flax seed for half the oil; used 1/4 cup eggBeaters (r) instead of the egg; both of these are my "usual" procedure with any recipe.   Next time, I'll add the cinnamon suggested by another poster; I've made a note on the recipe to do that.
