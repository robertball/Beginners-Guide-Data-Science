My husband and I really enjoyed this!  I had to make some changes based on costs and what we could find locally.  I subbed Barilla whole wheat spaghetti since our store did not carry linguine.  To make the sauce: I sauteed the garlic in olive oil as stated and added Chardonnay, and let it gently boil for 4-5 minutes.  Then, I added 2 cans chopped clams (with all the juices) and let that simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce just a little. We do not get fresh clams this far inland.  After the sauce reduced a bit, I added in the Barilla marinara sauce and let it heat through and simmer 5 minutes longer. I topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Using canned clams was an easy way to make this much quicker, making it a great weeknight dish. We will make this again!

I tried this for my family today and they loved it! I also added sauteed calamari to the clams.  Living in a port city, we really love the fresh seafood.  Definitely going into my permanent cookbook!

Great Pasta! Great Sauce! I made this on Christmas Eve and it was a big hit! Everything about it was perfect. I topped with freshly shredded Parmesan and that was all. It's been a while since I made linguine and will make it more often now.

4 out of 5 stars because I think the instructions should be altered. Linguini should be boiled for 9 minutes not 4 and then added to sauce with clams because once the clams are steamed open they have been fully cooked and further cooking can make them rubbery.  Otherwise an easy and great dish. Also, I used Manilla clams which are smaller and sweeter than littlenecks. I also did not need any of the pasta water at all

I made this dish for my family for our Christmas Eve dinner, and I was quite pleased with the result! The recipe was simple and easy to follow, and I'm sure it would be good with any of your personal favorite modifications.
I definitely plan to make this again!
