i really love this spread!  it goes well on anykindo of cracker and using low or non fat ingredients does not change the taste tremendously.  if it does, you can add extra seasonings and capers to make up for it!  i make this for all my get togethers and can't resist it while i wait for company!

I made this for the office "treat day" and it was a huge success.  I doubled the amount of salmon and halved the capers.  I have made it a couple of times since and everytime people asked me for the recipe.  A definite keeper.

Oh my goodness - this is wonderful!!!
It's very low-carb, perfect for Atkins.  It tastes great stuffed in celery sticks or spread on cauliflower or broccoli.  A great way to use up leftover salmon.
