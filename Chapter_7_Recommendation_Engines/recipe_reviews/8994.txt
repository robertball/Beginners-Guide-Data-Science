This was a great recipe.  Although I followed the ingredient list, I made mine low fat.  Instead of frying, bake the strips on 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until the center is white.  Also, I used skim mild instead of buttermilk.  Spray the cookie sheet with fat free butter flavored spray and voila! very low fat tenders!  If the powder looks like it's not baked golden, don't woory, if the chicken is done, so is the breading.  I also added a teaspoon each of rosmary, thyme and pepper.

I made these today for my husband who orders chicken tenders whenever we go to a restaurant that has them on the menu.  I was worried that they wouldn't measure up, but he thought they were quite good for homemade!!  The only change I made was that after I shook them in the breadcrumb mixture, I dipped them in a beaten egg and RECOATED them in the leftover breadcrumbs. This made for a thicker, crunchier coating and a MUCH more tender bite to the chicken. (i only know that because i ran out of the crumbs before I could recoat the last 3 so I fried them with only a single dip...they were noticably more chewy) Over all an awesome recipe!!  Will do it again!! :)

Excellent...however, as I read the recipe I decided that for my own taste buds I'd prefer a little more seasoning, so I added a little paprika, poultry seasoning and cayenne pepper to the crumb mixture. I also "double dipped" them, repeating with a second coating of the buttermilk mixture and then again in the crumb mixture. These are great with barbecue sauce or Ranch dressing. Good recipe Janet, thanks for sharing it! Update Dec. 2, 2013: This time I made these with Panko bread crumbs and didn't bother to "double dip."  Equally as delicious as the first time I made them.

I've made these twice now, and tonight I slightly altered the recipe.  I used regular milk instead of buttermilk and added 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also made 1 1/2 times the bread crumb mixture.  Then I poured off the milk mixture into a separate bowl, dipped the chicken strips in the bread crumb mixture, back into the milk and then back into the bread crumbs, and finally into the oil.  This made a nice thick crust on the chicken fingers.

These were excellent.  I also double-breaded them (I didn't have enough coating to do all of them) and added about 1/2 t. of creole seasoning to the coating.  It wasn't too spicy for my 3 and 4 year olds, and gave it a bit more pizzaz.  The chicken was unbelievably tender, even considering I marinated them for just under 2 hours.  Note that if your oil is very hot, as it should be, it should only take a few minutes per side to cook the breasts; otherwise they will get tough and absorb more grease.

Out of the park!  These chicken fingers are absolutely yummy!  The buttermilk marinade is the key!  The breading sticks to the pre-cooked chicken better, if it's kept cold...so I marinated over-night in the buttermilk, and then dredged the chicken in the breading..and put them back in the fridge for 15 minutes or so..and then cooked them off - so tender!

After reading some of the reveiws, I'm really not sure what some of the reviewers did wrong because these chicken strips turned out wonderful.  Crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.  I did add more garlic powder, cayenne pepper and salt to the buttermilk mixture as well as the flour/breadcrumb mixture for more flavor.  I also double dipped as many reviewers had suggested with egg first then dredged in the flour/breadcrumb mixture and repeated. They fried easily without breaking apart and my oil looked like it had hardly been used after I was done.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

When it comes to chicken fingers...I am like a kid at heart! These are sooo good and we all loved them!  I only had 1/2 cup bread crumbs so I crushed some Ritz crackers to make a full cup of crumbs.  Still, very tasty...crunchy on the outside and moist inside.  Great lunch idea and will be making again.  Thanks Janet! My daughter thanks you too!

I only let mine marinate for an hour and they turned out awesome. I coated once and baked at 350 for 35 minutes turning once. Made a honey mustard sauce to go with. Delicious.

I can't believe I forgot to rate these!  I have made these so many times!  sometimes marinating for a couple of hours, sometimes overnight (best!).  These are awesome and BETTER than any I have had at any restaurant!  My kids went nuts over them and I love them too!  I made exactly as directed and would NOT CHANGE A THING!  AWESOME as is.  I serve them with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue sauce and Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site!  :) Thanks for making me a super mom!

I just made these for the 3rd time tonight.  Each time I marinated the chicken in the buttermilk mixture overnight in the fridge.  The second time I tried the "healthier" oven method, and I was incredibly disappointed.  The oven method does not even come close to comparing to how good these are when fried.  There is absolutely no reason to change anything about this recipe.  Love it!

Delicious!!!  I made them with plain breadcrumbs since I didn't want to use the Italian seasoned ones.  Next time I'm going to try double-dipping them as other reviewers have mentioned.  I'm not big on deep frying and certainly didn't want to waste a quart of oil - all I did was pour 1/2 inch of canola oil into a skillet and fried the chicken in that, flipping the pieces over after 3-4 minutes.  Worked just fine and only used a cup or two of oil.

Updated to add that I have also tried this recipe using 1/3 cup regular bread crumbs and 2/3 cup Japanese panko bread crumbs, which are large and crispy - like restaurants use for fried shrimp.  They were crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside!  I tried all panko but the breading didn't stick as well and didn't brown as nicely either.

Loved it, just loved it!!!!
My son said it tasted better than McDonalds!!!
Very easy.  I prepared the marinade in the morning and it was ready to go dinner.
This one is a real keeper.
I followed the advise of others and added a little garlic to the marinade.  Perfect.

Loved these.  Followed Naples34102's suggestions and added some paprika, cayenne and poultry seasoning to the flour mixture.  I didn't double dip, but didn't need too.  My buttermilk mixture was nice and thick, and it really helped to get a nice thick coating on the chicken strips.  Fried in half canola, half vegetable oil, to use up what I had on hand.  The kids really liked these.  Made some honey-mustard sauce for dipping, and also had blue-cheese dressing and sweet & sour sauce for dipping too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow...these are actually quite good! My son is allergic to eggs and dairy so I used rice milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice --no egg. I also  made my own bread crumbs (from this website) and added oregano and parsley. I double dipped them too. Thank you for the recipe!!!

I used chicken tenderloins in this recipe. To the breading, I added a ton of spices for extra flavor (Johnny's seasoning salt instead of regular salt--it's a Seattle thing, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and lots of fresh ground pepper). This go-round I did fry them and the family loved them though next time, I think I'll bake them instead to cut back on the fat. I did not flour them in a bag, I individually dipped them in the breading mixture. You really do need the added spices. The pre-soak is absolutely necessary. NOTE: My mother in law taught me for a crispier breading, subtract a little flour from the breading recipe and fill in with cornstarch. I've done that with all my chicken breading recipes ever since.

The recipe didn't work for me, they turned out not as good as I hoped. I'll take the blame, however, and admit I probably did not make them correctly.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I added about 1/4 cup of hot wing sauce to the egg and buttermilk mixure just to spice it up a bit.

These are awesome. I take 3 chicken breasts and makes tenders. I let them marinate over night. I fry them in vegetable oil in a saute pan on med/low heat for about 12-15 minutes and then put them in the oven on about 400 for 5-10 minutes for extra crispness.  I serve them with some frozen corn and garlic dill potatoes.

We use this recipe every time and we always love how it comes out!  The chicken fingers are always perfect!  We won't use any other recipe.  (We don't refrigerate the chicken and liquid mixture for more than 20 minutes and it turns out the same as when we've refrigerated it for hours.)

Though it maybe unfair for me to rate this recipe because I did not fry. However, definitely do not put in the oven @350 for 30 min. It will turn out soggy. We try to eat healthy and I do not like to fry. If I were to try the oven again, I would crank up the temperature to 400. Perhaps that would encourage a crispier coating.

Really good! Moist and crunchy. Next time I will try and double bread since I like a little bit more coating. I didn't have any buttermilk but I added 1 Tsp vinegar and then added milk till I had one cup. Will definitely make again!

Incredibly moist and tender! I used seasoned bread crumbs and crushed corn flakes in place of the flour. I also added a few extra spices for flavor. I don't fry things so I sprayed them with a little olive oil, put in the oven at 375 and baked them for about 25 minutes. They came out crispy and tastey.

These are ok.  I agree with Suzi..there just your typical chicken finger recipe.  I didn't find a lot of flavor in them.  The crunchy/tender part is right, but nothing to rant and rave about.  I left mine in the buttermilk overnight as well.  Might make again in the future when my son is in the mood, but won't take this recipe to the grave with me.

This is a fabulous recipe! My daughters are huge chicken finger fans and we have tried many times to make them at home. This recipe beats all the others hands down, and my husband and I are now also big fans of Chicken Finger night!

Good but the breading didn't stay on as well as I had hoped. I will definitely try again because it may have just been me.

When I normally make fried chicken fingers I use a lot of different spices; was not in the mood to mess with all the spices so I used this recipe.  It was good but think next time I will try Panko bread crumbs adding a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning.  The store bought seasoned bread crumbs just didn't work best for our taste.

O M G..this is the best homemade chicken fingers!! I made this for dinner tonight..the ONLY thing I did different was left out the garlic powder. I have a 1 1/2 year old toddler..she's a picky eater and I didn't want to make it where she doesn't want to eat it. BUT she actually ate 2 pieces!! This was very easy to make, I fried these in a deep fryer!! I will be making these again!! Thanks for sharing!!

EXCELLENT!  We have made this numerous times now.  I double-bread my chicken, as suggested, and definitely prefer it that way.  I've also frozen these (flat on a cookie sheet, into a freezer bag when frozen) and reheated in the oven--taste better than the kind you buy in the freezer case!

I didn't make this as written.  I needed more spice to my basic panko coated chicken, so I used the coating and baked them dotted with some butter.  It needed more butter than I used because the chicken fingers came out with dry flour spots.  While I would use the spices in this recipe again, perhaps doubled, I would not use flour in my breading.

The buttermilk/garlic marinade tenderizes and adds great flavor to the chicken.  The breading is very good, but not great.  A different breading and/or batter recipe can be used.

I made this recipe almost exactly as it was posted. The only thing that I changed was I used whole milk instead of Buttermilk. These chicken fingers were AMAZING! My children loved them and my picky eater boy friend loved them so much he said next time he was not using barbecue sauce to dip them in! I will be making these again this week and this time I will use the buttermilk! Because some one told me that buttermilk makes chicken even more tender! Thanks for the recipe!

It was good and I changed it a bit for more flavor like people suggested. I added paprika, black pepper, and cayenne. I used whole chicken breasts because I forgot to cut them into chicken "fingers"! I marinaded them for 2 hours. Before I put them in the oven, I added a tbsp olive oil on top of the chicken so they would crisp up. My husband and I ate them with ranch dressing. I will try honey mustard next time and see how that is! Though they are good on their own you really don't need any sauce. I took away a star because I think as is the recipe would be a bit bland.

I followed this recipe and tried double dipping the chicken like some of the other reviewers had said... It would have been so much better had I not done that... Breading was just too thick.  Also needs a bit more salt... I put a little Johnny's Seasoning Salt in the mix and it came out pretty good.

I made these instead of using store-bought, they are so much more economical!  I had the deep fryer going and made a few different kinds of fingers. We had them for dinner and then used them in wraps and salads.  These are delicious and very versatile!  Think about making a Buffalo wing sauce for these!

Make this last night and my husband ask if it was difficult to do.  In other words he would like me to make if again, possible often.  I did double dip in in the buttermilk and crumbs as others recomended.  Next time I might try cooking in the oven to avoid all the extra fat of deep frying but there will be another time!

I double dipped mine as described by other users (had to make 1-1/2 times the bread crumb mixture. Instead of frying, I put them on a rack in the oven (375, 25 minutes). The taste and texture were really good, but if you decide to use the oven, I would suggest that you put in more bread crumbs, less flour, as they seemed "dusty."

I liked the base recipe for these, but I did change quite a bit.  To feed 3 people, I pounded one large chix breast to 1/2 inch thick, then cut into 3 inch strips. I marinated them for only about 15 minutes in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk mixed with 1/2 tsp of garlic powder & 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I crushed a 12-15 Ritz crackers (in a ziploc bag w/a rolling pin), added 1/4 cup parmesan and a bit of black pepper. Dredged the strips directly into the cracker mix and put them on a rack sprayed with cooking spray, then placed the rack on a baking sheet and then sprayed the strips lightly with cooking spray. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes and they were really delish. The parmesan adds nice flavor and they're so much healthier than fried. The kids loved them. I think it's the buttermilk that makes them so tender.

Wow. Double-coating the chicken with the breading was a brilliant idea. I'm so glad someone offered that suggestion. I used panko bread crumbs for an extra-crispy breading, and added some herbs, and a bit more salt. I added crushed garlic to the milk mixture for a more robust garlic flavor, and I only let the chicken marinate for about 20 minutes, and it still came out extremely tender and juicy.

Since we don't eat fried foods very often...when we do it has to be outstanding...and this was!  Made this for my aunt's 90th birthday party and all the ladies and gentlemen loved them. Marinated overnight and then thought I would try baking to lessen the calories.  I baked for about 20 minutes but they were still white on the outside so had to flash fry--in and out--til brown.  I also used panko instead of bread crumbs which made them extra crispy but still very juicy inside. Next time I made them I decided since the first batch was so great I went with the same cooking method.  Takes a lot less frying time--since they aren't cooking,just browning--and not as messy.  These are very, very good.

These chicken strips are absolutely delish!I've made these several times now and have found it ideal to go ahead and make extra.  As I am coating the chicken,  I lay all the pieces on a cookie sheet. I cook up whatever we need and leave the rest on the cookie sheet and put in the freezer.  After frozen, just put in freezer bags and you're good to go on a busy night!

These were really excellent! I only used about 1-1½ cups of oil to fry - turned each piece after about 4 minutes - and replaced the garlic powder with about ½ tsp paprika. This is a simple recipe to start with for those who have yet to try bone-in fried chicken. Reheated the leftovers the next day to use in wraps. They also tasted great! Thanks Janet!

These were soooo good. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used the milk and vinegar substitute. I also added some Adobo Lemon Pepper Seasoning, Hot Salt, and Accent to the buttermilk mixture.  We didn't have any bread crumbs, so we just used two cups of flour.I left out the baking powder and used Hot Salt instead of regular salt in the flour.D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!

Got a thumbs up approval from the picky boyfriend and child!  Pretty easy, though time consuming (which is the basis for -1 star), but very tasty. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Edit: I like to use this recipe as a base for boneless buffalo "wings", yum!

The breading that coats the chicken is lovely, and marinating it in buttermilk really adds some moistness and flavor. I will be making this again.

Wow, this was great! I used two chicken breast halves, and there was enough marinade and breadcrumb mixture to double-coat. The magic frying time for us was 8 minutes at 375. I added lots of spices - double the garlic! Those two breasts ended up making enough for about five people - too bad there's only two of us. I think next time I make it, I'll add even more spices; probably about a teaspoon of black pepper and about a half teaspoon of cayenne. Great recipe, and super easy!

Awesome. I added a little bit of ground red pepper to the breaded, because I like a nice bite. Great recipe.

These were sooooooo good!! Excellent recipe! I didn't have buttermilk, used regular milk. Turned out perfect. I also used my deep fryer. I used my own spices, used self rising flour so I didn't have to add salt or baking powder. This recipe is super easy to make perfect chicken tenders!! Thanks, we will make these again!!

This was the best breaded/fried chicken recipe I've ever made. I added some parsley to the buttermilk mixture, and a bit of paprika to the powder, based on the tastes my husband and I like. I also did the double dip method, and am glad I did, because the batter was delicious! I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a quick and easy meal of comfort food!

Okay, the only difference between this recipe and my own is the marinating in buttermilk, egg and garlic powder.  Does that step make them better?  I'm not sure.  I still found some pieces very tender, and some very chewy....I have a love/hate relationship with chicken!  It was good, but I feel like the marinade needs some other flavor infusion besides garlic, I'm just not sure what, maybe additional italian herbs.  I didn't double dip, and I don't think they need it, more bread crumbs and less flour and the breading is perfect, do let the coated chicken rest for 10 min. before frying.  So what's the bottom line?  Well, this is a good recipe, but didn't knock my socks off.  3.5 stars when hot, and 4 stars when cold!

First, let me say this was an EXCELLENT recipe! The buttermilk marinade I'd never tried before, and it made the chicken super tasty and juicy. The breading was excellent, I did add some Old Bay seasoning, paprika, a little cumin...and my only errors were in being a novice in the deep frying dept...MAKE SURE YOUR OIL IS THE RIGHT TEMP! And another good tip, use thin chicken, or pound out your chicken. I used perdue skinless boneless tenders, and they could have used some flattening. Overall, this was a really delicious recipe, thank you Janet!

These are AWESOME.  Double dipping is best because they turn out SO crispy.  I did like others mentioned and strained out the buttermilk mixture into a bowl, then dipped into the flour mixture, back into the buttermilk and again into the flour and right into the pan.  I used a frying pan with oil since we don't have a fryer and just watched them til they needed to be flipped.  Really it couldn't be easier!  My fiance liked them too and he's not really that into chicken!  I can't wait to make them again.

For leftovers, I used some garlic pesto tortillas and put lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, and these and rolled it up into a wrap.  DELICIOUS!

Very Very Yummy!  My parents and boyfriend love these, too.   The buttermilk marinate make these amazingly tender and juicy.  I am going to start soaking all my chicken in buttermilk.  This is a valuable cooking tip!  And definately double dip for perfection.  I drain the chicken into a strainer so as to catch the buttermilk mix in a bowl.  After shaking all the pieces in ziplock bag, start over by dipping back into buttermilk mixture, then recoating in ziplock.  Let all set for a few minutes, then start frying.  It doesnt take long to reach the perfect golden brown on both sides.  AA++ recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!!   I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE INGREDIENTS EXACTLY.  THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS I PUT THE DRY MIXTURE IN A DISH AND DIPPED THE CHICKEN STRIPS TO COAT.  I FOUND THAT THE COATING DIDN'T COMPLETELY COVER THE CHICKEN WHEN I SHOOK IT IN THE BAG.  GREAT RECIPE.  I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS RECIPE THAT THE NEXT DAY, I DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH CHICKEN WINGS.  THE WINGS WERE UNBELIEVABLE. AFTER FRYING I SHOOK THEM IN A POT WITH BUFFALO WING SAUCE, WOW!

This recipe has become an instant classic at my house, and we don't even have kids! My husband absolutely loves these and asks for them all the time.  I love how easy it is to adjust the quantities for larger batches.  When my picky 10-year-old niece came to visit on her birthday, this is what we made her and she loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

We were disappointed at this after reading all the wonderful reviews.  This wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.  We even added extra seasoning to this and it didn't help much.  This made a lot, so we froze the extra (saran wrapped them individually).  Won't make again (except for the leftovers).  Still prefer the restaurants over this. Sorry.

WOW!!!  Worth every second of work that I put into it!!!  I took the advice of others and once I dipped them into the bread crumb mixture I redipped them into the marinade and then in the crumbs again.  I used chicken tenderloins and marinaded them for 48 hours.  EXCELLENT!!  THANK YOU!!

These are better than any chicken fingers I've ever eaten at a restaurant!  Definitely double dip the chicken:  batter to breading, back to batter and then breading again.  Half my batch was single-dipped and the other half was double-dipped... we all agreed the double-dipped chicken was so much more tender on the inside, and crispier on the outside - YUM!! (If you make the full 6 chicken breasts the recipe calls for, you will need to double the breading).  I fried them in batches of 4-5 chicken fingers for about 5 minutes per batch and they turned out perfect.  Also, if you keep the oil at 375°F, these will not turn out greasy at all!!  If you're lucky enough to have any leftovers, reheat them the next day and wrap the chicken fingers in a flour tortilla topped with lettuce and honey mustard sauce... DELICIOUS!!

These are really delicious. I opted to bake mine instead of frying them. I baked at 425 for twenty minutes, flipping the chicken half way through the baking time. At the end, I sprinkled some olive oil on top and then broiled them about 45 seconds on each side. I also added a little parmesan, Italian spices, cayenne pepper and old bay to the bread crumb mixture. These were absolutely delicious and very tender.

Chcken Tender Perfection, IMHO!  They WAY Exceeded my Expectations.  I double-breaded and also added 1/2 cup of cornstarch to the breading for extra crunch.  The family just LoOovEd them.  Thanx for an amazing recipe.

I used the frozen chicken breast strips and this turned out kind of bland.  Next time will use chicken breasts and add more to the seasoning to spice it up.

These are wonderful!  The whole family loves them!  By the way, for those wanting to make it low fat... DON'T omit the buttermilk!  Buttermilk itself has a very low fat content and it adds a depth of flavor that skim milk can't hold a candle to!  You won't be sorry and neither will your waistline!

I double the egg so that it sticks better. Once they have refrigerated for the proper amount of time I dump the chicken and egg mix into a bowl. Coat the chicken in bread crumbs then RECOAT in egg mix then cover in bread crumbs again. Fail proof way of getting great crunch!! Once they're cooked I brush on a little wing sauce onto them and they are a huge hit!!

These were very good, my husband loved them. I did not have buttermilk so I made my own (1 C of milk w/1 TBSP of white vinegar or lemon, let sit 10 min.) I also double breaded the chicken strips; after the chicken marinaded in the milk mixture I poured the mixture into a separate bowl, dipped the chicken strips in the bread crumb mixture, back into the milk,  again into the bread crumbs and proceeded to fry them. Very good recipe.

It was good and tender. Very easy to make. Next time will mix it up with a  little more flavor. Didn't have much of a taste.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have time to marinate so I just dipped them in beaten egg and took the tip of double coating them (highly recommend doing this step).  They were perfect, just like the restaurants, and I didn't marinate.  However, hubby thought it could have used a bit more salt and seasoning.  I don't care as I love to dip and made them with the Honey Mustard Dressing II off this site. Make sure not to cut the strips too thick or they will still be raw on the inside and done on the outside.  Through trial and error learned that my smaller strips looked and tasted better.  I will make these again and perhaps add some seasoning to appease my husband.  Here's a tip: don't try to make homemade french fries with these like I did, as I just spent four hours over the deep fryer! :)

This was pretty good. I didn't have buttermilk, only soy milk and it worked fine . I also used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. It was very moist. The key is the  marinating.

These definitely didn't last long on my table.  I made some honey mustard sauce to dip them in and they were gone in no time.  They were very good and the recipe was fairly easy, but I'll try some other chicken strip recipes before I settle on this one.

My very picky family loved these!  Very easy to make and I didn't change anything in the recipe.  Personally I found out that these were just as good if not better eaten cold a couple days later.  I served them with the honey mustard sauce (recipe found here also) and it went just perfectly with the tenders.  This recipe went in my cookbook to use again and again.  My family is already asking for more.

My roommate and I have probably gained 10 pounds since we found this recipe. The chicken is soo good. I don't bread mine twice, because the batter falls off of the chicken while frying for some reason. I also add a lot of cayenne pepper to the buttermilk mix, and the flour mix, which gives the tenders a little kick. You can also fry 1/4 - 1/2 in thick breast halves and make crispy chicken sandwiches. Overall this recipe is really easy and makes an awesome snack.

Buttermilk is the key. I noticed that quite a few cooks used regular milk. PLEASE don't omit this ingredient. I know alot of us have reservations about this product, especially me but I decided to go for it.  Terrific meal enjoyed by all. I also made the "Honey Mustard sauce" from this website (click on my name for the recipe if interested). WOW!!

These are soooo good.  Most other chicken fingers I've made were lack-luster, but these were fabulous.  Even though I made some alterations, I still give the original recipe 5 stars.  Instead of using garlic powder, I put 3 cloves of garlic through a press.  I also put hot sauce in the buttermilk mixture.  I served these with a honey mustard recipe from this site that consisted of 1/3 cup mayo, 3 tbsp honey, and 2 tbsp yellow mustard.  These may not be the healiest thing you can eat, but they sure do hit the spot!!

I baked half and fried the other half.  I have to say, even though unhealthier, you have to fry these if you're looking for exceptional  chicken strips.

This is a standard recipe for chicken fingers that always worked well.  I also add some parmesan cheese and italian seasoning to my breadcrumb mixture just before frying for a more italian flavor.

While mine did not turn out crunchy as others deemed theirs to be this recipe turned out delicious. 
Since a few others proclaimed the recipe to be a little bland I added about 1-1/2 Tbls. of off the shelf Cajun Seasoning to the flour, just enough so I could taste it in the flour, if you want it spicier you could add more.
The buttermilk/garlic soak really did the trick though, I couldn't believe how tender and juicy they were. What a great flavor! Definitly a keeper!

Some are put on this Earth to help the less fortunate and some to advance mankind in the matters of science.  Me?  I'm here to find the perfect chicken finger (who said anything about misguided priorities).

This chicken finger, while not perfect, was an awesome first attempt.  I'll continue to tweak this recipe and I'm sure I'll declare my quest complete soon. The possible marinade/breading tweaks are mind numbing.  

FYI - the best chicken finger I've found in 11 states is in Birmingham, AL at an eatery called Baskits.

This was an OK recipe, but what the heck is the big deal?  Although the chicken stayed nice and tender and the breading was crispy, I felt it strongly lacked flavor. I really don't understand all the 5 star marks for such an ordinary dish.  It's like raving about a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the crusts cut off!

These have a fantastic garlic flavor that even the kids liked ... granted they don't know it's garlic they're tasting and enjoying.  I gave it a quickness rating of three because they need time to marinate for full flavor.  I also nearly doubled the recipe and deep fried them which added time.  If you don't have buttermilk, add a tablespoon of white vinegar to a cup of regular milk and let it sit for fifteen minutes before adding to recipe.  Same effect.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were FANTASTIC!! I ran out of breadcrumbs, so i just used plain crackers- also only 1 tsp of garlic instead of the full amount. They were awesome with the honey mustard on this site!!

didn't allow marinating time, rats, but did oil pan, then spray coated chicken--not enough oil--consider brush on next time so it browns--or put closer to top burner & don't convect.

Love this recipe and wouldn't change a thing. A beautiful, light breading, packed with a delicious garlicky flavor.  No need to bump up the seasonings especially if you plan on serving a dipping sauce.  Honey dill or ranch are our favs.  The only change I made was to put the breading mixture in a shallow baking dish rather than a plastic bag - far less messy in my opinion.  Also I let the breaded strips  "dry" on a wire rack for about 15 minutes before frying. The coating seems to stay on better. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

This recipe was simple to make and if you don't count the marinating time, doesn't take much time to make. The fingers were pretty and tasty. My only complaint is that for us, they need more seasoning. I will definetly make them again.

I came to the conclusion after I made these chicken fingers that these are not meant to be baked. I'm sure they turn out much better when fried. I didn't mark them down to a four because of the baking though because that wouldn't be fair, but I rated a four because my husband and I thought they were a little bland. Just tasted like breadcrumbs to me. However, my three year old ate them up like a champ so I will probably make these again for him. Make a whole batch of them, stick them in the freezer and pull out a few whenever we're crunched for time, and that will make an easy dinner for him. Much healthier than prepackaged frozen ones! Thank you for the recipe!

This was "one of your best" said hubby. Tender, moist and flavorful!  I was in a hurry to get dinner started so I skipped the marinating.   I like to use seasoned salt or Tony Chachere's for flavor.  Put just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and lightly browned both sides of chicken and then baked it for 30 mins.  I left out the baking powder.  Didn't need it.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks

Excellent! I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs and it came out delicious. I didn't have the time to marinate as long as called for but it didn't make any difference. I'll try for longer next time.

These were wonderful.  I marinated the chicken for two hours and double dipped in both the buttermilk and coating.  They came out flavorful, perfectly golden and tender and moist on the inside.  Thanks for a keeper!

I had high hopes for this recipe...I loved the idea of a buttermilk marinade, but was disappointed with the results.  While the chicken itself was very moist and tender, the flavour just wasn't there for us. It's quite bland actually. I suppose I could add a bunch of spices or whatnot, but then it wouldn't be this recipe any more.

This was great! I used chicken breast and added about a teaspoon each paprika, montreal steak seasoning and red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Double coated and then baked at 350 until the thickest breast was no longer pink in the middle. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER!

Really moist chicken and you can take this so many different ways by adding more spice. I made just the basic tonight and made a plum sauce to go with it turned out  great.

very good basic recipe! I followed most of the directions..i didn't have butter milk so i substituted a cup of milk and added some lemon pepper seasoning and a little vinegar, i also added some seasoning to the marinade. a little garlic, cayenne, onion powder and paprika. i marinated the chicken strips for a few hours then i crushed some saltine crackers, added some instant mashed potatoes and flour, seasoned the breading mix with a little cayenne, salt, seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic powder. i took the chicken, rolled it in the breading, then egg, then breading again and fried it for a few min in the deep fryer. they turned out perfect! make sure not to fry too long, it only takes a few minutes

Doesn't work well for baked chicken fingers. Also, I'd suggest breading them individually on a plate rather than in a bag.

A++++ Everyone, including 3 picky children can not stop talking about how good these chicken fingers are! The first time I had to substitute Lawry's Seasoning Salt for the Garlic Powder - which is fabulous also. When made exactly according to recipe - Amazing! Various seasons could probably be substituted for the Garlic or in addition to and this recipe would turn out Delicious! If there were only more than 5 stars for exceptional recipes just as they are written!!!

Very good!  I did not have buttermilk, so I used regular milk instead and it still turned out great.

So great! I added red chili flakes and lemon pepper to my buttermilk mixture as well. Next time I will add a little hot sauce instead of the flakes because we couldnt taste them. I only marinated my strips an hour and they were so juicy! I fried them in my cast iron skillet this time but will try baking them. I served this with mashed potatoes and gravy for a Sunday lunch. Check out the Honey Mustard II recipe from this site, I served that on the side as a dipping sauce.

Yum!  I followed the recipe as written except I used fresh garlic instead of the powdered garlic.   The chicken was delicious!  Next time, I will use only the egg whites, not the yolks in the marinade.  I will also dredge the chicken in the flour& bread crumb mixture because  the moistened chicken wanted to stick together in the plastic bag  and did not get coated completely.  My grandkids will love this recipe!

I love this recipe! I love the fact that its so easy and no fuss. All done in bags. To save even more dishes, I even mix the egg with the buttermilk inside the bag before adding the chicken. I know I'm so bad, I'd do anything to minimize dishes! Anyway, not only is this recipe easy, but it is also very delicious. I used plain bread crumbs that I seasoned with some italian seasoning and pepper. Awesome! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has a lot going for it: primarily simple ingredients and ease of preparation.  The marinade goes a long way to help keep the meat tender and plump even when slightly overcooked in the fryer.  The use of plastic bags, while not really earth friendly, helps allow for easy clean up as well.  The only reason this recipe rates a 4 out of 5 stars boils down to taste.  The final product is relatively bland, now this may be a VERY GOOD thing for picky eaters!  With a little imagination however, this basic recipe can be personalized easily with a few spices or other ingredents.  One other plus, I have placed the chicken in the marinade as much as 24 hours in advance and it still came out nicely.

Yummy!  I had to make a few substitutions for things I didn't have on hand...I crushed seasoned croutons for my bread crumbs, substituted garlic salt for garlic powder and cut down on the salt.  Very easy!  It would probably be even better with garlic powder, since we love garlic (I can't believe we were out)!  Definitely a keeper.

PURELY DELECTABLE.  By far, the best tenders i have had, and my family devoured them.  I used 3 breasts, and it was alot for my family of 3 because the tenders are so thick (in a good way).  3 breasts can defintely feed 5 with this recipe.  oh yeah, definitely try the honey mustard dressing II dressing from this site....perfect combination.

The chicken is so soft to chew. I double dipped as what others recommend and it turned out to be better in appearance . I marinated it for 2 nights and it was utterly soft to chew. The taste was a bit bland. I think I have to add chicken powder or other seasoning the next time I do it. Definetely a keeper

Very good.  The only reason I didn't rate at 5 stars was because I still needed to add a little additional seasoning to get them nice and spicy.  I used a chicken flour mix that I make up myself that has lots of spices and mixed that with italian bread crumbs.  I also added about 1/4 cup of hot sauce to the buttermilk.  They were great.  The recipe as is makes a lot of chicken fingers, but they keep well, and cut up make a great fried chicken salad.  They didn't actually last that long in my house anyway, so I didn't have to think of very many ways to use them.

WONDERFUL RECIPE, a hit with the kids and even though I thought it would be greasy it wasn't at all!!! loved it!!!

I didn't have much time to refrigerate, I only left the chicken refrigerate in the zip lock bags with the sauce for about 30 minutes and it still tasted awesome!!!

VERY VERY GOOD!! I made the mistake of putting all the chicken pieces in the bag at the same time which made it difficult to coat them all. Put them in a few pieces at a time.

Made these the other nite. We (hubby & kids & me!) LOVED them! I used Panko bread crumbs, made them extra crunchy! And spiced up the crumbs alot! They were crunchy on the outside & so moist on the inside.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I found this recipe months ago and have made it many times. I serve these yummy strips atop a green salad (half iceberg, half green leaf lettuce) with spring onions, cucumber, tomato, and toasted walnuts, with a honey mustard dressing. I never have leftovers.

My family really liked these!  First I tried to bake them instead of fry them, but the flour and bread crumb mixture just stayed white on the chicken.  I didn't know that it would do that.  I didn't like how it looked so I decided to fry them in oil.  I had some leftover flour/bread crumb mixture so I did as others said they did and dipped the chicken in the egg mixture and then dipped it back in the dry mixture and fried it.  They looked much better!  The one good thing about baking them first was that I didn't have to worry if the chicken was cooked all the way through or not.  This recipe was fairly easy and didn't take much time to make.  I will definitely make this again for my family.

Takes a little work but they are worth it.  I used the buttermilk substitute - regular milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice added.  Dipped and breaded the fingers twice, then refrigerated for 20 minutes before deep frying to hold the coating on better.  Dipped in Honey-Mustard sauce from this website - YUMMY!!!

This is a good recipe for juicy, tender chicken pieces. However, the coating does need a little bit more seasoning. I add a little more garlic powder, ground cayenne pepper and freshly ground black pepper.

These were great!  Better than the restaurant!  This will be a regualr recipe at our house.  We soaked our chicken tenders overnight.  My DH and I made these together and he commented on how easy and how tasty they were.  Thanks! :-)

Another winner from this website!  I made these for a party and they were a huge hit.  The buttermilk kept them so tender & although I did omit 1/2 tsp. of the garlic powder, it was still great!  I substituted the 1/2 tsp. garlic powder for seasoned salt.  Everyone at the party raved about these.

Janet these were a smashing success at my house with the kids and adults alike. All I did differently was add some extra garlic to the marinade. I also tried as some other reviews suggested and coated the chicken twice. I preferred it with only one coat. Two made it seem to "breaded". As with everything fried I added salt after they came out of the oil. This is fabulous and some much better than mystery meat chicken fingers from the fast food joints or the freezer. THANKS!

Hats off to Janet! A very simple, straight forward recipe! I marinaded my chicken for about 6 hours, breaded them and set them in the frig for about 3 hours. My wife deep fried them and I have to say they turned out crunchy on the outside, very tender on the inside. One thing I did a little differently was instead of garlic powder, I used minced garlic out of jar in the marinade.

Chicken was very juicy and tender.  The taste was a little bland but next time will add more spices to liven it up.  Will definately make again for myself and children.

Yuppers Janet, you have a real winner with this one!   I didn't have the buttermilk on hand, but found a great recipe for a "substitute buttermilk" that worked just as well!

The chicken fingers were crunchy, perfectly seasoned, and very tender & juicy inside!   It didn't take much oil either; just a heavy skillet with maybe a couple inches of oil.    This one is a KEEPER!    (Oh and I took the garlic theme one step further and made "garlic mashed-potatoes" along with these!)

My little girl drizzled a tiny bit of honey on her strips :-).   These are GREAT Janet and will be on our "favorites list" from now on!  MMMM!

This was the best fried chicken I have ever made!  I do recommend marinating overnight.  I tried marinating both overnight and for a couple of hours and the flavor of the garlic is more noticable when marinated overnight.  My family LOVES this recipe!!!

Such a great recipe, we let our chicken sit overnight in the garlic buttermilk. Then followed everything, other thank adding a half a cup of grated parmesan cheese into the breading mixture.

Hubby asked for homemade chicken tenders so I found this recipe and whipped it up tonight. It was really good and would definitely make again! I think this would also be great to do for a party app and just cut the chicken in bite size pieces. Looking forward to making this again!

I made this recipie as is except for the fact that I used ranch dressing instead of the buttermuilk and egg. Ranch has the egg buttermilk and seasoning in it already. Came out so tasty and moist! Thanks for sharing!

Perhaps I made them wrong, but I can't get a good crisp crust that actually stays on the chicken. Was a little dissapointed. Also, I prefer more spice in my recipe.

I found a way to make crispy chicken that works well everytime (thanks mom!). Use any spiece you want and brush each piece with MAYO! I would have never thought to try it. As it is egg based and adheres well to chicken, then sprinkle with breadcrumbs and panfry. So easy!

Very good!  It just took a couple of minutes per side to fry.  I only had plain bread crumbs, so I added Italian seasoning to the mix.  I also put in a pinch of cayenne pepper and paprika.  I recoated them with eggs and then threw them back in the bag of crumbs.  My 3 year old loved them!

I flattened and pounded the chicken before cutting (gave a better texture).  I used low fat milk instead of buttermilk and fresh garlic instead of powder.  We also put them on baking pan, sprayed with olive oil with our special sprayer (or use cooking spray) then bake - tastes like it was deep fried without all the calories and fat.

Ths recipe was a success...I altered it a bit because i did not do it ahead of time. I added Franks Hot Sauce to the Marinade with salt and pepper. I also added salt and pepper to the dry ingredients as well and they came out awesome. I highly recommend for football season.

This was a delicious breading which gave the chicken a restaurant-like flavor that my children appreciated. The chicken itself was juicy and not dry at all. The process was also simple. Like others who made this recipe, I double-dipped the breading to make it a little thicker, which made it twice as good. This has become a regular dish in our home!

These were very good. I just added a little more seasonings and double dipped them as others suggested. I baked them and fried them to see how they turned out. The baked ones were definitely less fatty but still turned out pretty good and the fried ones of course were completely perfect.

These were just great. Rave reviews from adults and kids alike. I did follow the suggestions of others and after shaking the chicken in the flour mix, I dipped it in the buttermilk "marinade," and then dredged them back in the flour mixture. I fried them in about 1/2" of oil in a cast iron skillet.
I used Bella Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs, which I bought at Cub Foods. The seasoning was just right.

I cooked these in a deep fryer for 8 minutes at 325 degrees.  I used canola oil.  These would taste great dunked in hot sauce.  I let my chicken marinate overnight in the buttermilk.

I've given this recipe to so many of my friends!  I marinate my chicken overnight in the buttermilk mixture.  I added cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the breading mixture (I didn't measure, just added by eye) and they fried beautifully.  The chicken was very tender and the seasoning was absolutely mouth-watering.

Very tasty! I baked my chicken fingers on a baking sheet sprayed with PAM. I marinated the chicken in the buttermilk mixture for 8 hours today. I added some paprika, black pepper and more garlic seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. I coated the chicken in the bread crumb mixture and placed them on the baking sheet and baked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. They were golden brown and crispy on the outside. The chicken was also tender and juicy on the inside. The chicken was moist and that I liked a lot. I served this along with, "Mom's Favorite Baked Mac and Cheese," and "Restaurant-Style Coleslaw II," all from this website.

My brother made these for me last night... and WOW, fantastic!  Tasted just as a good if not better than restaurant chicken fingers.
He made as directed, but marinated overnight rather than the instructed 2-4 hours.
Thanks for Sharing.

Its not really fair of me to rate this so poorly as I didn't follow the recipe so much as followed the reviewers.  I baked this instead of frying it at 350 for 30 mins.  I also double breaded some pieces.  While altogether not very good, the pieces I double breaded taste the worst.  THe chicken turned out very dry and is still very floury.  I guess we will be ordering pizza tonight

This recipe is awesome! I changed mine up. I added cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs. I didn’t soak the mix for 2 hours, only because I didn’t have time and they still turned out awesome. I used skim milk. I baked them in the oven on 400C for 40 minutes. I used parchment paper to line the pans and rubbed a bit of olive oil on the parchment paper. They turned out to be really crispy and yummy!!

I marinated the chicken for exactly 4 hours and it came out moist and tasty!  This was also the first time I used my cast iron skillet.  I put the burner on medium heat and let the chicken cook.  Super easy.

Awesome!  I used 1% instead of buttermilk and still turned out great!  Only did one coat and they were perfectly breaded. Never had such great luck with crumbs sticking properly before! Totally PRO!

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used extra seasonings , more garlic powder, seasoning salt, poultry seasoning , pepper. They were very good. I also made a honey mustard dipping sauce to go with them.

This came out so good. I used unseasoned bread crumbs so that I could add my own seasonings to suit our taste. I took the advice of other users and double breaded. This is a keeper.

Great recipe!!! My husband and I try to to eat pretty healthy so I baked the chicken in the oven instead of frying it. I also left out the flour and it still came out great. I will definitely make this again.

So good!  Great coating recipe! I've made it with chicken strips and also with whole boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Both are great!  I top the cooked chicken breasts with honey bbq sauce and serve on a toasted bun with cheddar cheese.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

I marinated these for only 30 min and they were amazing! What I did was bake them in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes and then quickly seared them in the pan with olive oil to cook the flour.  They were AMAZING! I had leftover chicken before I made it, so I cooked the rest the next day.  Marinating them for a day made them extra juicy!!!!

These were pretty good. Made a batch for dinner last Sun. night. I'm still in search of the "perfect" recipe, but until then, this will do!!! I was expecting a very garlicky taste, and, to my surprise, these weren't "garlicky" at all (IMHO). My marinade smelled VERY garlicky (and I even marinated for 6 hrs.), so I am not sure why.... I pretty much followed JANETFORAUBURN's directions to the ltr. except for subbing a pkg. of chx. tenders for breasts (I didn't have enough breasts on hand & think it is just easier using tenders anyways). I also dbl. dipped everyting (i.e. breadcrumbs, buttermilk marinade & back into the breadcrumb mix.) and used my new fryer (well... not "totally" new - I got it for my Bday back in Jan. and am just now using it!). I was able to fry all 10 of my chx. fingers at 375 degrees for ~ 7 min. They were perfecly golden brown & crunchy on the outside, yet tender on the inside. I think chx. breasts would have been juicier though.... One tip: place your breadcrumb mix. in a lg. Ziplock bag & shake (no need for sep. bowls). Also, re-use your marinade if dbl. dipping (saves an egg & works just as well). Served w/ Restaurant Style Coleslaw I (Marsha), mashed potatoes, chicken gravy, Grand's biscuits & fresh lemonade. I thought I was at KFC! The bf says the only thing missing was honey mustard sauce. Nxt. time, I'll whip up a batch using the recipe from Aussie Chx. by beckie (I LOVE that stuff!). Thx. for sharing :)

Ooooohhhh these are good! Made recipe exactly. I double dipped them and they were so crispy! I don't have a deep fat fryer so just heated up some vegetable oil in a large cast iron pot, dripped a drop of water in it and if it made a "sizzling" sound then it was time to fry! I made twice baked potatoes with these and had an amazing meal! Oh yeah- got the twice baked potato recipe from this site as well! Mmmmmmm! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  And so easy!  Due to time constraints I only soaked the meat for about 20 minutes before double breading as recommended.  I also upped the garlic powder to about a tablespoon.  The meat was so juicy and tender, the outside delciously browned with breading that actually stayed on!  I will so be making this again, and soon.

This was a really good recipe! I was going to bake these in the oven but my oldest asked me to fry these instead. So I did but saved some to make the next day for lunch & then I would bake them so I could see which way was better. Well, to me frying was soo much better. Maybe I should have double dipped them in the batter but I just dipped in the batter & then the flour mixture & when I took them out of the oven, they were still covered in flour. It was gross. Marinating really long didn't make a difference either.  But, overall, I will deffinatly be making these again. Very yummy!

My family loved this.  The 16 year old said, "this chicken is AWESOME".  In place of buttermilk, I used 2% milk with a Tablespoon of vinegar. This will be a regular at our dinner table.

This is by far the best "fried" chicken recipe I have ever had the pleasure of making. My niece has raved about this recipe for years and tells everyone they must eat her aunties chicken. I have baked this recipe instead of frying it before and it turns out just as good! When baking you will need to either drizzle some oil over top or spray some cooking spray on it or they will not turn out.  If you don't have buttermilk just add 1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup milk let it rest 5-10 minutes and then use it in the recipe. Works just as well!

This was awesome. Don't throw out the buttermilk!!  I dredged the chicken twice in the buttermilk then flour.  Only marinated for one hour. **Make the Honey Mustard Sauce II from this site!** and a side of mashed taters and green beans. Comfort food at its best!!!

Great recipe.  I double dipped my strips as recommended by other reviewers, which required that I double the flour/bread crumb mixture, otherwise, I did everything exactly as shown in the recipe.  This officially replaces my previous recipe.

Another alternative to buttermilk: add spoonful of vinegar to cup of milk and let it stand for ten minutes. Basically something acidic + milk. 

I love love love this recipe. I cannot believe how juicy and tender the chicken turns out! Usually add some parmesan cheese and bit of garlic salt to the bread crumbs for extra deliciousness.

Yum! I'm glad I made a double batch! The only mistake I made, was that I should have changed my oil half way through because it seemed to get "dirty" and the chicken didn't turn out as nice after the first few batches. I am new to frying though and probably need to read up on the best methods. I also double dipped half of my strips, and they were the best. We had a few strips left over, which were fought over the next day and eaten cold - I will make this again very soon!

Awesome recipe!!
I double dipped them and used a bit of garlic salt since I had no garlic powder.  They were a HUGE hit.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this recipes. I had real buttermilk -not the low fat stuff-in the fridge; It is pretty thick so I did not use the egg. I marinated for 2 hours. I will definitely make again.

Made as is, but didn't deep fry--just pan fried on the stove.  Froze extras (before we started nibbling) and they reheated wonderfully!

i followed this recipe as written with the exceptions of using skinless, boneless chicken thighes (cut into nuggets) & rounding off the amount of garlic powder. soaking the chicken in buttermilk made this dish tasty & moist. very yummy with the honey mustard sauce from this website. thanks janet!

I loved these!  They were good and easy and if it wasn't for the fat content, they would be perfect.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added 1 tsp of vinegar to the milk.  Someone else suggested 1 tbsp of lemon juice but this also works.  A keeper!!

Great as-is!  I used lemon juice and milk instead of buttlemilk, too, and pounded the chicken--it melts in your mouth!  Definitely worth the calories :)

these were extremely easy to make and were very tasty.  i made them for my new year's eve party and they were gobbled up in no time.  i, too, used a lot less oil than what was called for and should've taken others suggestions and pounded the chicken a bit.  but, regardless, they were still very good.  thanks for the recipe!

Great!  I used minced garlic and 2% milk for marinating and it was wonderful!  I double dipped them to add crunchiness and they fried up golden brown with a great crisp to them!!

I've recently moved out on my own and can't find any restaurant here that serves decent chicken tenders (a staple of my meals back home). These are great! Easy to make and really good. I've made them with both buttermilk and the substitute (milk & vinegar) and it just seems that the buttermilk ones have a more potent flavor to them but they're great either way.

I made this last night, and they were delicious! I've made fried chicken before, and I have to agree with others, marinating in the buttermilk is the key. They were crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. I also used the milk/lemon juice substitute. (I never even knew there was a substitute for buttermilk). I used minced garlic rather than powder (about a clove), but I'm sure powder is just as good. I also added spices to the flour mix (a dash of cayenne pepper, and about a teaspoon each of onion powder, coarse black pepper, paprika). Cut them small, and they were done in 3 to 3 1/2 minutes. Excellent!

A great chicken recipie.  I did try to bake them first but they did not brown and were powdery from the flour.  We ended up frying them at the last minute and they were great.  They were crunchy and moist on the inside.  I would add more seasoning to the flour mix as they were a little bland for me.  Overall, easy, tasty and the ingredients are always on hand at our house.

These were so amazing!!  My husband and I loved them!  I don't know if I have ever had a better chicken strip.  I fried them in olive oil because it's healthier and they turned out great with no heavy oily taste.  I want to eat them again right now.  Also-make sure to make them with the Honey Mustard II recipe.  It was the perfect addition to these strips.

I followed others suggestions and reduced the amount of garlic powder.  I only added 1/2 t. instead of 1 1/2 t., and we LOVED IT!!  My husbands only suggestion was that I didn't make enough.  This is easy!!!  A definite keeper!!

Fried them - yummy! Not much of a fryer though, so I tried them baked. Didn't brown, but moist and good. Added olive oil to a shallow baking pan; placed breaded chicken in pan. Baked at 400 degrees for appr. 4 minutes on each side, or until chicken was thoroughly cooked.
When didn't have breadcrumbs, I've used finely crushed cornflakes and it turned out just as well.

This is the best chicken tenders ever!
They are very crispy and fry up so good.(I think the buttermilk is the key to keeping the batter on the chicken)
Great flavor, I will be keeping this one.
Thanks!

I enjoyed this. Because I like the flavor, I used cornmeal instead of bread crumbs for the coating on the chicken strips, seasoning it with a seasoned salt mix. One problem I did have was that even though I thought I cut the chicken breast into 1/2 inch strips, once they were coated they seemed big. The coating was beginning to get too brown by the time the chicken was cooked all the way through. I used a bottled barbecue sauce for dipping and served with cole slaw and oven fries. It was a great change from all the other "boneless skinless chicken breast" ideas I usually can come up with for dinner.

This was a good recipe.  I will definitely make this again, but (the only drawback) there wasn't enough breading on each piece.  So, I'll probably coat it in flour, as noted in the recipe, then dip the chicken back into the buttermilk mixture, then dredge it again in the flour before frying.

My family loved this recipe.  I used whole chicken tenderloins.  I didn't have time to refrigerate the chicken in the buttermilk mixture, but it still seemed to work quite well.  My kids (and husband) requested that I make these again "very soon."

I seldom fry anything anymore, but my husband likes fried chicken fingers, so I gave this recipe a try.  I added a little salt to the buttermilk mixture a few minutes before draining the chicken.  I served them with country gravy for dipping.  We enjoyed them, but I think next time I will try marinading fresh raw shrimp in the seasoned buttermilk mixture and then coating with the flour mixture with perhaps a little cornmeal added.

My 4 kids make dinner once a week, with as little help form me as possible.  My boys, (ages6 and 7) chose this for the main dish.  They marinated, mixed, measured and did the shaking.  All I did was deep fry.  They loved it.  The family has declared this a big hit.  My husband had the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Thank you !

These were good, but I couldn't get my 3 year old to try them.  The recipe made a lot more chicken fingers then my husband and I could eat at one meal.  They were yummy on a salad the next day.

ummmmm ummmmm good! Very Very tasty...Although a little time consuming..It is well worth it! I did add a 1/2 cup crushed corn flakes with the flour mixture. It was just great!

I took some advice i'd read in other reviews and added a couple of tsp black pepper to dry mixture for kick as well as added a clove of fresh minced garlic to the buttermilk mixture. I also double dipped the fingers (if you do this i suggest doubling the dry mixture otherwise you will run out) Everyone whose tried them likes them, great recipe.

No Lies here.  I'm picky.  I'm the kind of person who demands the best (Calphalon, Henckels, etc). This is a fantastic recipe for chicken fingers.  I'll never buy frozen ones again.  They're also good tossed in Buffalo Sauce after they're fried. I added a little Garlic Salt to the Buttermilk Mixture.  I bet these would also make a great finger sandwich served on Garlic Bread.

I don't get it, these were good but not what I'd consider spectacular.  I did like that the breading actually stayed on the chicken, and my children gobbled them up.  We served them with a honey mustard dipping sauce as well as BBQ sauce.

I read all the ratings and decided to try it.  I was kind of disappointed.  The breading was not crunchy like the ones I have bought out.  Just kind of plain.  The kids ate all of them and enjoyed the dipping...

Yum!  I was really suprised by how good these were!
My husband and I both love garlic, and loved the
flavor of these.  Frying them on the stove was not 
the easiest thing to do, but I was well rewarded
for the effort.  I'm sure if I had a deep fryer it 
would've been much easier, and I wouldn't have spent 
so much time waiting for the oil to heat!  As it is,
though, I'll definitely make it again; they were just
too yummy!

Splendid recipe! I use the overnite method, the flour mixture could stand a little more seasoning in my opinion! Kids loved it! I served it with bbq baked beans and cole slaw! Another great meal from Daddy!  :0)

Wonderful recipe....but beware the previous advice to cook 45 mins.  You would not be able to eat them if cooked that long.  Maybe she meant 4 to 5 mins.?

We've had store-bought chicken strips and these are by far a step above!
I'll try the overnight marinade next time.  Even my husband helped put it all together!

This recipe was delicious!  The breading was flavorful and crunchy and the chicken was moist and tender.  After they came out of the frypan I tossed them in a sauce (melted butter, garlic, and Red Hot).  We also did a garlic butter Parmesan sauce.  They became boneless wings!  Very good!   This will become my go to recipe for sure! Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe exactly, except added a little cayenne to the flour. Just did the single breading and it worked out great. Shaking the soaked chicken in a gallon bag didn't coat them well enough, so I just dumped then on a plate and hand breaded, pressing the coating into the pieces.
I think the buttermilk makes ALL the difference. These were sooo tender and crunchy. I deep fried mine in my cast iron dutch oven (by the way, the best deep fryer EVER) and they came out fabulous. Will definitely make again.

My family and I LOVED this recipe, although I used regular 2% milk instead of buttermilk, and let the chicken marinate overnight instead of the recommended 2 hours. Simply an AMAZING recipe that is sure to be back on the menu quickly.

I didn't marinate them at all (no time), skipped the egg (son's allergic) so just used buttermilk.  Dipped in seasoned flour, then buttermilk, then dredged in the breadcrumbs (used panko).  Refridgerated for 15 mins then fried them. They turned out well

Very easy to make.  Tasted very nice. Takes only a few minute's to cook.  Need a temperature gauge to keep oil at 375 and a temperature gauge to check on chicken at 165. Nice and moist.

Excellent recipe! I didn't realize that I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs when I started making these, but I did have panko, so I substituted it and added some dried seasonings (i.e. tarragon, basil, oregano, salt, pepper). It was delicious and the texture was crunchy while the chicken was moist and tender! Mmm-mmm-mmm!!!

Wonderful recipe! I used half breadcrumbs, half potato flakes, a bit of parmesan, and added my own seasonings. Double-dipped, fried in half an inch of oil, and they turned out the tenderest chicken fingers I've ever had.

These were delicious! I added 4 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture. Everyone said they're the best chicken tenders they've ever had! I took another member's recommendation of using skim milk in place of buttermilk for a lower fat recipe - it tastes just as good. I totally recommened these 5/5*

I have been trying for years to find what is to me, the perfect fried chicken flavor.  I finally found it.  My husband and I were so excited that we finally found what we have been looking for that we had this for dinner again only two days later.  I will never use another fried chicken recipe.  Thank you so much for finally bringing my fried chicken search to an end!!!!

Needed more salt, didn't use buttermilk but regular milk instead(not soured). This turned out well. I did the breading times 1.5 and that was too much. There was a lot left over so next time I'll just follow the recipe. :)
Thanks!

I made this over the weekend for my family.  I used  chicken cutlets to make  a chicken club sandwhich.  Absolutely delicious!  I marinated the chicken for about three hours.  I am making again tonight - tenderloins have been marinating over night this time for a more intense garlic flavor.  Tonight's menu is ciabata bread toasted with garlic butter, topped with  the fried chicken fingers that will be tossed in buffalo sauce and  topped with sliced tomatoes and melty swiss cheese.  YUMMMY! This is THE way to make the best fried chicken ever! Thank you Janet! Oh - I used Progresso Panko Italian bread crumbs. Soooooo good!

I thought these were great!  I made the liquid for them to soak in early, so I think they may have been in the buttermilk for about 5-6 hours.  The only minor change I made was to use garlic salt instead of regular salt in the coating.  Very good recipe.  Will have to make again.  Soon!

Fantastic recipe. I tweeked mine slightly and used milk with 1tbsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk and 1/2 cup regular breadcrumbs mixed with 1/2 cup Panko crumbs which gives it more crunch. Recipe works out good as is but i didn't have the buttermilk or seasoned breadcrumbs. Also added 1 tsp onion powder, 1tsp pepper, pinch of cayenne and celery salt and used seasoning salt in place of regular salt. My first batch did not cook through properly so I reduced the deep fry temp to 350  for 3-4 minutes;had tried at 315 degrees for 5-6 minutes and meat was too dry. Definately double dip for a thicker coating!

These chicken fingers were a hit at my house! Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed ritz crackers, the flavor was excellent! I have made this recipe time and time again, and it even pleases the picky eaters at my house!

I only got to marinate my chicken for 4 hours and the chicken was still sooo juicy and tender. I bought chicken tenderloins instead of having to cut the chicken breasts. I added cayenne pepper and used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt and it was still a bit bland for my liking. I double-dipped as others suggested. but my breading kept falling off the more batches I did.

Husband and I thought there were pretty good! However, the coating did not stick to the chicken once they were fried, but it did stay in one piece and kind of formed a "shell" around the chicken. Can't complain too much though, b/c they had good flavor!  Dipped them in Yummy Honey Mustard dipping Sauce *another allrecipes recipe. Delicious! Another one for the recipe box.

This is a staple at our home now. The children look forward to it and so does my wife. I usually make it as written. Incredible yet simple recipe. Thank you Janetforauburn.

I made these today and my family loved them, the only changes i made was used italian seasoned crumbs and i baked them instead of frying them.  This recipe is a keeper.

I adjusted this recipe to serve 80 (yes, 80) people for a community potluck. It turned out great and people have been talking about it ever since! My only addition was Old Bay seasoning to the flour/breadcrumb mix.

This is a tasty recipe.  I did add some extra seasonings (garlic powder, poultry seasoning, pepper) because we like bold flavors.  The breading mixture stayed on the chicken with no problem.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious.  I used 2 pieces of toasted bread as my bread crumbs and threw in some fresh parsley as the herbs.

I made these tonight for supper and both myself and my two young boys (6 and 4) really enjoyed them! I accidentally didn't read the recipe fully ahead of time and didn't marinate the chicken in the buttermilk mixture.  Still came out great, but will definitely marinate next time as I'm sure this improves taste and texture.  I also wanted to make it low-fat, so I followed fellow reviews of baking at 350, mine took about 40-45 minutes (maybe my chicken pieces were a little bigger?).  I also sprayed my sheet pan with pam and melted 1-1/2T.butter and spread over the pan.  Then, I took my pampered chef olive oil sprtizer and sprayed the top of the chicken to ensure a crispy texture.  I also shared some with my sister-in-law and niece and they loved it!  I will definitely make again!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

UNBELIEVABLE!! Absolutely LOVE these! Thankfully, there were few leftover so we had them 2 nights in a row & I'm craving them again already. Excellent flavor. I fried them in my deep fryer & they were perfect!

This is an excellent recipe--especially as I was able to adapt it to suit my daughter's gluten-free diet.  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I also used the double-dip method, and then set the coated chicken in the fridge for about 30 minutes to help the coating set.  I also chose not to fry, but baked at 350 for about a half hour.  This is a keeper!

Pretty good.  Adding flour to the breadcrumbs creates a nice coating without being too heavy.  Rather than strips, I used whole chicken tenderloins and browned them quickly on both sides and then put in a 350 deg F oven for about 15 minutes.  Next time I'll add a bit more seasoning, but our family likes our food well seasoned.

I totally agree that these should be double-dipped in the breading. I also used skim milk + 1T of lemon juice instead of buttermilk.  Fantastic!

look out KFC...this recipe is AWESOME!  I think I added a few more things in...I wanna say some lawry's seasoning salt, increased the garlic, salt and pepper, nothing crazy.  I didn't measure the spices, just used these measurements as a guide.  I used a cup of milk with a squirt of bottled lemon juice instead of the buttermilk cuz I didn't have any on hand.  these fry up perfectly and are sssssoooooo good!

Tried these on a limb hoping they would turn out well. I read below that adding 1 tbsp to 1 cup of milk makes buttermilk, so I tried it and it worked. The chicken was very tender and it only sat in the liquid mix for about 20 minutes. I fried them in oil, and they where very good. Excellent the day after cold also.   Would make again!

Excellent!  I didn't have time to refrigerate so I just dipped the chicken in the buttermilk mixture and then coated with the flour mixture.  Still turned out great.  I added some cayanne pepper to the flour mixture for a little zip.  Very yummy!  Severed with loaded mashed potatoes.

I just made this recipe for dinner today and not only was it super easy and quick to make, but it was delicious!!! The chicken was so moist and tender! I followed the recipe as stated and I had more than plenty buttermilk and breadcrumb mixture. I did however substitute garlic powder for a tsp of minced garlic and I used way less oil (only enough to cover the bottom of a wide skillet). I saw that some people tried baking them and they turned out great, so I think next time I'll give that a try. Otherwise a great and super easy recipe :)

These were a big hit with the whole family!  My toddlers couldn't get enough.  I repeated the milk and breading steps.  Next time, I'll omit the flour when I bread them the second time.  I found that the flour left a dry powdery finish.  They were still really tasty despite that. The first batch I baked (350 for 30 minutes) I breaded the second time just with crushed seasoned crackers.  I will definitely do this again; they were crisp and delicious. One tip, when breading them the second time, don't toss them all back in the wet mixture.  The breading just got all clumpy and made them difficult to bread a second time.  Next time, I'll do them each separately for the second breading, dipping them one by one and rolling them one by one in the seasoned cracker crumbs. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is the best chicken finger recipe ever! I have been told they are better than a restaurant. Didn't change a thing, followed recipe exactly. Delicious served with honey mustard, ranch dip, or mayo w/ some honey. Sounds strange, but it's very good. Thanks for this recipe, I will use this very often. Thanks (:

Searched for a recipe to use left-over buttermilk after making Irish Soda bread yesterday. Made these tonight. Didn't love them, as I hoped I would based on reviews. Just as well, as they are hardly low-fat. One of these days I will learn to stick with the tried and true.

Holy Cow these were good!  Definately do the 'double dip' method if you like the coating. I used the milk with lemon method and it seemed fine. I also added some red pepper power, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and seasoned salt (without msg) to the flour/breadcrumb mixture.

Double coat as suggested, with extra salt and pepper in the egg mixture.  Works great if you make twice the coating in one go, and fry up a big batch of breaded chicken fingers and breaded green beans.

Really Great,  Made these tonight for company.  I used my food saver to marinate these, which really helps the marinate get in the chicken.  I also used panko Japanese style crumbs with a little extra seasoning.

Very good!  I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder before coating with the flour/bread crumb mixture - and that was the only change that I made to the recipe.  It was wonderful!

My husband is horribly picky about certain foods- he gave this a big thumbs up and told me to remember this recipe and don't change a thing! High Praise indeed!

The only change I made was to save the marinade and double dip the chicken. Loved it!

I'll give this a five for flavor but I opted to use the oven-bake method that other reviewer suggested. It lacked the crunch I love, but that's what I get for not frying. I adore fried foods, but I have to cut back (I already deep fried zucchini to go with this!) But the flavor was good and I'm sure the frying would have made them perfect.

These chicken fingers were amazing!  I didn't marinate them in the milk/egg mixture long enough but they still turned out very good.  So flavourful and juicy.  I will definitely make these gain.

This is a good recipe and my boyfriend liked it, I marinated at least two hours and double dredged, and cooked it all at once in two skillets.  I served it with salad and my favorite side dish (Corn Casserole III on this website).  Needs a lot of oil, I didn't use as much as called for (probably 1/3 or 1/2 cup in each pan), but my last batch burned because I used the pan twice and didn't add another couple glugs of oil.

I make this every time I cook dinner. My one suggestion is marinating the chicken. The chicken does not require two to four hours. I usually do it for about thirty minutes.

Okay, Hands down the best homemade chicken fingers ever!!  I did substitute whole wheat flour and put a little wheat germ in with the flour/breading.  I definitely think the secret here is the marinating for a few hours.  Absolutely excellent chicken fingers.  I will definitely make again:)

We make these all of the time.  I omit the garlic.  I melt some butter and add some hotsauce in a bowl.  We coat the hot chicken with the buffalo sauce.  Yummy.

Did not have any buttermilk (and I dont like all the fat!) So just used Skim, the breading stuck very well to the chicken.  I didnt marinate it the full amount of time, probably about 20 minutes. Also deep fried, very tender & juicy. Tasted great.

This is the first time I've fried anything, and I must say, after a minor glitch in the beginning, it turned out very well. I made my own buttermilk with the directions from a previous reviewer (1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice). I also added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and a few dashes of a seasoning mix to the flour mixture (I only had plain bread crumbs in the house at the time). I didn't have a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil (which led to my glitch in the beginning because the coating on the chicken cooked too quickly leaving the middle of the strips pink). My suggestion to anyone who may have had or will have the same problem is to start heating the oil over high heat then switch to medium to medium-high heat to cook the chicken in. I also made the honey mustard II to go along with it.... mmmm! Very good dinner! :) Looking forward to the leftovers!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it exactly and they turned out bland. So the second time I left out the garlic powder and used seasoned salt and used more seasoned breadcrumbs than flour. They were excellent. My guests at my apartment warming loved them and wanted the recipe.

I printed this recipe and my 17 yr. old neice made them as her part of a "finger-foods dinner."  We didn't have time to marinate in the buttermilk, so we just dipped them in it before breading.  They still turned out awesome.  I can't wait to make these again when we have time to allow for marinating!!

These fingers were great tasting and easy to make.  I used panko crumbs and seasoned with garlic power, onion, power, pepper and cayenne.  Also added additional seasoning to the buttermilk mixture.  Served with honey mustard...but they were so good I prefer them plain!  Thank you!

My husband's favorite food is chicken nuggets/fingers so I made these as a treat for him last night.  He loved them, which means I'll be making them often.  They're super easy and they come out so juicy and tender.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was so happy with this recipe.  I used my new deep fryer for the first time and I was worried that they wouldn't turn out well.  Luckily I was wrong and these were delicious!  I used Italian seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs and they were perfectly crunchy.  I will definitely be making these again.

Really good...I soaked the chicken in the buttermilk and egg mixture overnight.  They were moist and tender with a nice crispy crust.  Perfect dipped in Honey Mustard II from this site.

These are very good- I don't like to fry too often & "grease" up the house! If you slice the chicken breasts thinly on the diagonal, you don't have to pound. I think the recipe needs a little pepper. The whole fam liked them- keep an eye on them so they don't get too brown! Dipped in "Honey Mustard Sauce" from this site & also used some Panko for part of the bread crumbs.

I let this marinate in the fridge overnight and then fried it the next day at work for Superbowl Snack Day.  It was a huge hit and people were eating it as fast as I could fry it.  I did add some chili powder and cayenne pepper to the mix to give it a smidge of bite.  I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  Next time I will add more spices.  I only used two halves of a skinless boneless chicken breast and it was way too much for the ywo of us.  I will cut back to half of breast next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe! Boyfriend loved it and so did I. Apart from the marinading time, it's really quick to make and it's better than anything you can buy in the supermarket. The buttermilk maranade makes the chicken really tender too. I will definately be making this one again!!

Wow, were these GREAT!!  I hate frying food because it never seems to come out right, but these turned out perfect!!  The whole family was able to sit down and eat the SAME meal, which was nice:)  Definitely keeping this recipe!!  Served with the Honey Mustard II recipe on this site as a dipping sauce last night and used the chicken fingers (made a lot!) and dressing on a big ol' salad today.  YUMMM!!

A tasty entree for sure. I substituted milk and lemon juice for buttermilk, an unusual concoction that causes the milk to curdle and providies a similar effect while not being as vinegarry as the aformentioned buttermilk.

Very tasty and so easy to make. I marinated my chicken over nite with the buttermilk mixture, the buttermilk is really the key ingerdient. If you dont have buttermilk on hand, you can make your own (check this site for subsitutions.) Next time I will add a little season salt to the flour mixture and maybe will try to oven fry them. I used the Panko Japanese Breadcrumbs which worked well.

These were very good....the chicken tasted great. I will always use buttermilk to marinate now.  I did use a little seasoning salt to season the chicken before breading.  I did have a problem with the coating falling off after frying though......

These are GREAT!  I used regular fat-free milk instead of buttermilk and it turned out just fine!  They are crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside, and are an easy quick-fix...tip....if you don't thaw the chicken ALL the way, it's easier to cut into strips, and then finish thawing.

This recipe was an absolute hit at my New Year's Eve party. The chicken fingers went really fast. Next time I make these I will try adding in a little extra zest to the breading mixture, but they were incredible as is!

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent!  My two year old, who typically never eats, polished off 2 chicken strips herself.  My husband, who was having leftover PRIME RIBE from Christmas, said the chicken strips tasted better!  I will definately make this again!

These chicken fingers are amazing! The first time I made them, my brothers and I fell in love with them. They're really easy to make too. 5 stars for this one!

Very good. I added cajun seasoning to the buttermilk/egg mix and Panko for the bread crumbs. I double dipped them in flour/egg/panko.I only fry in oil maybe once or twice a month so this was a real treat. It doesn't take much chicken to feed a family of 4 either. I used 4 1/2 breasts and we had left overs so it's an inexpensive meal with some oven frys. Kids loved it. Thanks!

Awesome.  One of my favorite finds on this site.  Try this in a tossed salad and honey mustard dressing.  I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I soaked the chicken in milk with some seasoning for about 10 minutes.  Next I dipped chicken in seasoned flour then milk again and then the bread crumb mixture.  Cooked in vegetable oil in my cuisnart skillet at 375 degrees using my candy thermometer. Do not put all chicken in at once this will bring the temp down.  Do in batches.  Takes about 2 - 3 minutes.  Sooo good and juicy.  I made honey mustard sauce with this (mixed about 2 tablespoons of mayo with 1 tbsp of honey and grey poupon), lemon juice and a splash or 2 of white wine vinegar.

This chicken is wonderful. I am often leary of frying, but after reading reviews, I went for it. They did not turn out greasy at all, and the buttermilk added tenderness and a depth of flavor absent from usual chicken fingers. Will keep this in my monthly rotation!

WOW!  The flavour was excellent, and the meat nice and tender.  I used a crushed garlic clove for the marinade (didn't have any garlic spice).  Also, I didn't deep-fry the chicken but sizzled it in a non-stick frying pan with a knob of butter.

Wow...this was awesome chicken!! I halved the recipe and made 3 chicken breasts which I pounded out slightly. I didn't cut them into strips...left them whole. I did add fresh cracked pepper to the buttermilk mixture and marinated the chicken for about 4 hours before breading and frying. I also add some paprika to the bread crumb/flour mixture. I thought this chicken was tender and so tasty...loved the garlic flavor..and very moist. Will make again soon!

Liked these. Used Old Bay for the seasoning, with good results. Chicken was very tender, nice contrast to the crispy crust.

My husband loved these.  I thought they were good too, but a little salty for my taste.  It may have been the brand of seasoned breadcrumbs that I used.  Next time I'll probably cut back on the salt and pound the thicker ends of the chicken breast to make them thinner.

I just finished eating this for dinner and I wanted to make sure to comment right away. I tried to make chicken fingers before and they were really bland. So bad, in fact, my boyfriend regards that meal as the only one he hasn't liked. This recipe had such good reviews I decided to give it a try. What great results. The chicken was moist and flavorful. This time around he said that he would pay for this chicken in a restaurant. Thanks for redeeming me in the chicken finger department!

We really enjoyed these!  Tastes much better than the store-bought kind!

I would recommend cutting back on the bread crumb and flour, as I ended up wasting quite a bit.  Other than that- great!

Wonderful! We live in Germany and I miss the chicken fingers at the resturants in the states. This is the first time anything that I fried turned out correctly. I couldn't believe how moist the chicken was yet so crunchy.  For those you think that it made to much for your family, scale it down, it does state in the recipe that it calls for 6 chicken breast. If you normally eat 6 chicken breast, great, if not, scale it down for 3.  As for all recipes, season to taste. I loved it and so did my kids.

I made these into chicken nuggets and we loved them.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used milk.  We are thinking about using a variety of spices to achieve different flavors in the future.  Very easy and very rewarding.

I followed the recipe to the T and the chicken was wonderful. Very tender and juicy! I made these with "Grandmas green bean casserole" on this site and they were great together. Some of us dipped the chicken strips in bleu cheese dressing which was good.  I will make this again because it's not expensive, not very messy and it's pretty easy, too. Thank you Janet S.

These chicken fingers were great--very moist and tender on the inside, nice and crunchy on the outside.  I did add a few cloves of minced garlic to the marinade, and some poultry seasoning to the breading.  These chicken fingers looked great, and tasted great!  Thank you for sharing!

So simple to do and perfect for a meal or a snack.  My kids love them, especially when I serve them with cheese melted over the top.

really very good! These came out looking fabulous and were excellent left over on a salad. Takes a little time to bread and fry, but worth it for an occasional meal.

These strips were better than any other home-style chicken strip I've had.  I think I'll add a little more garlic next time.  We dipped them in ketchup and BBQ sauce.  Very good finger food!

Made this with chicken tenders and it was very good.  I only marinated it for about an hour but the buttermilk def. made it more tender.  Fried it in only about 1/2 the oil and that seemed to work fine. Served with ranch dressing for a dip, but the crust was plenty flavorful by itself. Def. a keeper.

Very moist and tender chicken.  Definitely better than restaurant chicken strips!  Next time I will probably add a few more spices to the coating mixture as well.  Served them with sweet & sour sauce, and they were very good.

This took some time to prepare & used a TON of cooking oil, but I will never again pay $5.00 for 2 chicken fingers at a fast food place when I know I can make my very own right at home that are EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!  These were awesome!!  I even made my own honey mustard sauce & it just topped the whole thing off!

I don't give 5 stars very often, but these are the best chicken strips I have ever had--agreed with by my two teenagers and husband!!  The breading stayed on the chicken as they cooked and the taste was wonderful.  Marinating them in buttermilk (I added a tsp. lemon juice to insure no egg flavor)  made them very tender.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was an awesome recipe and I couldn't keep enough of them.  I used regular milk because I was too cheap to spend $3.50 for a gallon of buttermilk that I would only use once, but it tasted great nonetheless!  I highly recommend this for any party, snack or dinner!

This was the best chicken I have ever made! The marinating definitely adds a certain something, I think. My extremely picky husband gobbled these up and keeps asking me to make more. A definite winner. Oh, I deep-fried them and they came out PERFECT.

This recipe is wonderful! Of course, I doctored it up with some paprika in the flour/breadcrumbs and some green jalepeno sauce in the egg/milk (try it...it's not spicy...just flavorful) and I added more garlic, but overall this recipe is a 5-star one in my book. Also, I didn't have time to marinate it, but I found it was just as tender and juicy without the time in the fridge. The breadcrumbs and the baking power are key. This is the only way I will make fried chicken from now on. It's a must-try for those of you who haven't.

This is by far the best chicken fingers i have ever eaten!  I was a little hesitant to make at first because I don't fry food often, but the end result was well worth the effort.  I will make again, and again, and again...

Yummy! These were so tender that they melted in your mouth and the garlic flavor was great. One of the best chicken strips I have ever made or eaten.  Really good dipped in cream gravy.

These are FANTASTIC-the best, tenderest chicken
fingers! My husband isn't a garlic lover so I
cut the garlic in half (my daughter and I think
full strength garlic is great). All during dinner
he kept saying "this is the best chicken". In
fact he ate 3 of the 4 breasts I made. Next time
I'll make more.

Excellent! I think my husband found a new favorite with this one, and very easy! I never thought frying chicken was so fast. This will become a regular.

This recipe is the BEST.  The chicken is so tender and has a very good taste, not too garlic-ey but just enough to make it noticeable.  I printed it in December for a holiday dinner with friends and have made it ten times since!!!  Thank you!!!!!!

Excellent! I've never been able to make good fried chicken.  I also tried both the overnight and a few hours, and overnight gives the chicken a more garlic flavor.  I thought the directions for the actual cooking was too vague, and had to call my mother to learn that it would take about 45 min to cook.

Good crunch and easy to make, but definitely needs some more seasoning on this. As a southern man I need some kick.

Family loved it. Might play with seasonings a bit next time, maybe some pepper and such. But, as is, it's an easy, quick, non-messy recipe that was kinda fun to make.

It was easy and tasty. I breaded it twice but don't think I needed too. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will make my chicken pieces smaller. I prefer when a recipe tells me how long to cook the chicken in the oil. The first batch were a little too dark but fully cooked. The second batch wasn't as dark but not quite fully cooked.

I used cast iron skillet, and candy thermometer to test oil temperature. The oil was at 375 degrees but the batter turned black in 30 seconds.

These Chicken fingers turned out fantastic. As others noted I also added a bit of paprika and additional garlic but other than that I followed all steps. My son who never wants my homemade Chicken came back twice to fill up his plate.

I tried the baking method so many had mentioned. I will fry them next time. The flavor was great but baking takes away some of that wonderful crispness.

Great recipe, I got the oil super hot then cooked the tenders 3 minutes on each side.  Enough oil to almost cover the chicken tender. They came out perfect. I used sweet and sour sauce and a good barbecue sauce for dipping.

*put a piece of the crumbled flour in the oil and when its turning brown and sizzling then the oil is hot enough.

Used chicken tenders instead of breasts, paired them with waffles for my husband's dinner.  Made me realize just how bad frozen chicken fingers are!

These were awesome! I did have to change a few things. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I made 1 cup milk with 1 Tbsp lemon juice to substitute. Didn't have baking powder so substituted with 1/4tsp baking soda. Didn't have time so I let the chicken sit in the milk for a half hour. Didn't want to fry, so I baked in the oven at 400deg for 25mins. Also, I used chicken thighs. These were juicy, flavorful, and my picky 5 yr old actually enjoyed it! Next time I'll half the flour like someone else suggested.

I followed druidfaery's advice and baked these instead of deep frying and added some addition spices. They are really delicious but I think I'd turn the heat up a bit as they weren't as crispy as we would have liked.

Well first of all I didn’t use chicken instead I used wild turkey breast and they were a big hit at our playoff party! I also used peanut oil for frying! I believe it was the best turkey tenders I’ve ever had thanks for the help! Probably will do them again for the super bowl!

I thought these were good, but not great.  I didn't double coat them and wish that I had, I think they would have been really good if I had.  Used them for Chicken Caesar salad one day and Chicken Caesar wraps the next.

I made it exactly as the receipe called for except I added Creole Seasoning & Cayenne Pepper to the dry ingrediets.  I have NEVER fried chicken before not knowing how to do this properly.  My kitchen smells delicious and my sons are very happy!  (I did deep fry them because as a Southern, we fry everything!)  Thanks for a great recipe that I will use often!

Panko bread crumbs are too chunky and didn't cover the whole rings. I made a 2nd batch with fine bread crumbs that came out much better. Suggest also to really slop on the batter first. Makes for a better coating, in my opinion.

I followed the recipe but I used seasoned salt to replaced the salt, then I added Cayenne pepper. This turned out great.

Followed the recipe pretty much as is, except I used what's called "chicken tenderloins" and didn't bother cutting them up. Also I don't measure ingredients too exactly, but the good news is you really don't need to. Anyway we all loved it! Thanks

Made these tonight.   Our empty nest has just two of us so I used one whole breast and it made many many strips.   Mixed some butter in the oil to cook strips and that gave a nice flavor.  Husband wants these from now on,  frozen are not near as good.  Thank you for a great recipe ! ;-)

Substituted buttermilk for a mixture of half and half, lime juice and water.  Added paprika, onion and garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the flour (contribution from another recipe).  Turned out fantastic and have made it 3-4 times.

Delicious! I didn’t read the directions properly and missed the part that says to marinate the chicken for 2-4 hours... I only had 45 mins to marinate and they still came out delicious. I can’t wait to make them again and let it marinate for a couple of hours AND will try double dipping in batter. Thank you for the recipe

I made more chicken breast because of that I did 2 cups of buttermilk and 2 eggs, I also added salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, crush red pepper, garlic powder, season salt to the egg and buttermilk mixture whisked it all together then added it to the ziplock bag with the chicken and let it marinate overnight.  Then I did one cup of flour, half a cup of season bread crumbs and half a cup of panko bread crumbs, some of the chicken breast I dip twice like some of the other reviewers suggest but some of them just dip once.  My husband loved it and wants me to add it to our rotations, we ate it with honey mustard sauce I made and pasta salad.  Next time I think I'm going to use only panko bread crumbs.  I gave it 4 stars because it did not say to add the extra seasoning which I think if I did not it would taste pretty blend and I love full flavors.

A simple, yummy way to fry chicken "fingers".  I followed the recipe pretty closely, marinating in the buttermilk for about 4 hours. I added seasoning to my personal preference to both the marinade, and a little to the flour-crumb mixture.  I breaded per the recipe for about half of the chicken, and double-breaded for the remainder, just to see what I thought about each way. I thought both were good, but the original recipe yielded a more moist finger.  I don't usually fry like this, but was bored with my usual chicken recipes.  Fried food bothers my tummy a little, so I won't make it again soon, but definitely will some time!  Thanks for posting!

Some of the best chicken strips I've ever had. The garlic buttermilk marinade gives it a good flavor. I love this dipped in honey mustard dressing.

Made my own buttermilk for this recipe. The chicken was great. Only thing I did differently was add some Greek seasoning.

I used the double-dipping suggestion made by several reviewers and these were delicious! Light and crunchy just the way we love them at restaurants. Since we didn't have buttermilk also just mixed regular milk and 1 TBSP of vinegar. Also added no salt seasoning and paprika. I didn't fry in a lot of oil, just enough for a crunch. I will definitely make these again.

Made these last minute, therefore didn't soak them like I should have. They still turned out great! I bet they'll be even better with letting them 'marinate'. I also believe you can make buttermilk by souring regular milk (adding vinegar an letting it rest)

This is the only dinner EVERYONE in my family will eat. I make extra buttermilk/egg mixture on the side to make sure I have enough to double bread. I also go ahead and throw them in my deep fryer... I just have a harder time regulating the temperature of oil in a regular pan. other than that, i don't make any other changes to the recipe. It's become a weekly staple in our home!

Great recipe!  I've made with seasoned bread crumbs as the recipe calls for and also with panko instead of bread crumbs.  Both ways turned out wonderful.  Coupled with Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce by Jillena and Zaxby's Chicken Fingers Dipping Sauce by Franny is super!

awesome.  Kids even loved it.  Hubby loved it too.  Easy to make.  I used lemon pepper seasoning.  These were awesome.  To call my kids picky eaters isn't quite doing it justice.  If they love something and eat it... It is almost a miracle!!  I cooked the chicken in a pan for a bit before putting in oil.  Just to lessen the amount of time they sit in oi.  Worked fine.

Great recipe!  I did add additional seasonings such as salt, poultry seasoning, and smoked paprika to the Panko/flour mixture and I did double dip it. The buttermilk marinade is the key to great juicy flavor. Turned out great!  I fried a couple pieces of chicken first without the extra seasoning and felt it needed more for me and my family's taste.  Definitely a keeper!

I marinated the chicken in the buttermilk and egg, but I used seasoned salt (not really a fan of garlic). I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs so I tried planko. I think they were getting burnt before the chicken would cook thru. So I dumped that and used just the flour and baking powder. They browned so much prettier.

When making this I was a little skeptical as I've always made chicken fingers like this with a tempura batter.  My kids loved it.  My teen daughter said that it tasted close to one of her favorite restaurants (Zorn's Chicken) sesame seed chicken.  Next time I'm going to add sesame seeds.  A keeper recipe!

The chicken was great.  I did not have time to marinate for that long but my husband loved.  It's simple to make.

I had to write about this because we had them last night for dinner and today I am craving them!  I made them exactly like the recipe called for...to me, it had the best flavor ever...I did fry them in my fry baby....but, that's only cuz I hate frying on the stove top... after marinating the chicken in the buttermilk...the breading formed a pocket over the chicken after frying...and the chicken was soooo moist and tender....I even fried them up early and popped them in a 250 oven wrapped in tin foil to keep them warm for about an hour...still moist and wonderful...Thank you for a great recipe!  Oh, I did not double dip them like others did and they were  perfect.

Wonderful!  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so used  plain bread crumbs from my homemade bread and added poultry seasoning and extra sage.  They are even better now that I use my home grown chickens.  I usually de-bone 2 or 3 chickens and make a big batch.  They make a great  snack  cold from frig or heated in the microwave. They are just as good as fresh from the fryer.  I use ranch dressing as a dip for them

This recipe was awesome. I made a few changes myself because I thought it might be the thing to do based on other reviews. First, I marinaded my pork (I didn't have any chicken in the cupboard) for 20 minutes and instead of bread crumbs, flour and baking soda, I used powdered milk. I used water instead of buttermilk for a low fat marinade as I didn't want to add another 5 lbs to my already fat @ss. The breading really didn't want to stick to the pork fingers when I boiled them in low fat water so I just rolled them around in the driveway for some added crunch. Out standing! 

Update....I just tried this recipe as it is written, and these REALLY are awesome!! I will make again for sure!

Following others' advice, I double-dipped these as well and fried in hot oil (nowhere near a quart of it) for about 3 minutes each side. Tender and absolutely the best chicken strips I've ever had.  Yum!

This was an easy recipe to make and it turned out great!  I followed the directions, with the exception of not having any baking powder or buttermilk...  (I mixed one tablespoon of lemon juice in with one cup of milk and let it sit for 10 minutes, to replace the buttermilk) before adding the other ingredients...  I took a chance on not having any baking powder to add but the chicken fingers still turned out well...  I also did the double dipping as several other reviewers suggested...  Will definitely make again!

You bet I'll make it again AND again! I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne to the marinade for a little pick-me-up spice. These were so easy to make and sure tasted good! My family loved them!

I used the recipe for 4 very large pieces of  chicken breast with the bone and it worked out wonderfully.  Very juicy and tender, with good flavor.  I substituted panko crumbs for half the flour and added paprika and pepper to the coating, but otherwise followed the recipe and directions.

I had very high hopes for this recipe and they turned out just OK. I added paprika and onion powder to the buttermilk mixture for some extra flavor and marinated for at least two hours. The flavor was decent, but they weren't crispy. I think if I make again I will do as others suggested and give them a second dip in the buttermilk and bread crumbs for a better coating.

These were a hit.  Next time I make them I'm going to play with the spices to give them a little more zip.  I may try adding powdered ranch dressing to the crumb mixture.  I marinated about 20 minutes. These were really yummy :)

I made this during my foods class and it was delicious! I used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs. Instead of 1 cup of panko for every cup of flour, I used a cup and a half of  panko which made the tenders even crispier! I also allowed my meat to marinate in the buttermilk mixture overnight instead of 2-4 hours which let the chicken absorb the buttermilk even better! I also used 3/4 a quart of oil instead and fried the tenders at 300 degrees instead of 375. This allowed me to keep the tenders in there for longer to get them to a perfect golden brown! I am most definitely going to be making these again and hope to bake them at some point!

I've been looking for a good chicken nuggets recipe since the in-store ones are either gross or too expensive. Used only 1 1/2 breasts and cut them into bite-size pieces instead of the strips. Also, used plain bread crumbs and only a dash of garlic powder because I had a sweet and sour recipe I was also testing out. Everyone loved them even my picky brother who was visiting. The only complaint was that I should have made more! Making again tonight.

My family loved it. Even my son who doesn't like chicken. I used panko instead of bread crumbs. Other than that I followed the recipe. I did slice the chicken a little thinner than 1/2 inch. It only took 4-5 minutes to cook each batch.

I added a bunch of black pepper and chili powder to the crust. Like some others I baked mine rather than frying it. Glad to read other reviews that mentioned that the top didn't brown when baked. They tasted fine, but didn't look great. I think next time I might brush the tops with some oil or melted butter before baking to try and get a more golden color.

This was a hit in our house.  I usually bake chicken tenders but wanted to splurge for my son after his first day of school.  We all enjoyed this one.  The coating stayed on the chicken  very well, and it came out crispy with the chicken being tender.  I did not have buttermilk so I subbed buttermilk ranch dressing, but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Great dipped in ranch or buffalo sauce.

This recipe was really good! I made a few changes to the recipe.  I soaked and refrigerated the chicken overnight because I didn't read the recipe until right before I wanted to make it.  So I mixed up the wet and then the dry ingredients, added the chicken to the buttermilk mix, and left it all until the next day.  That made it much easier to cook, hardly any prep.  And I used just 2 breasts cut up, because that's what I had.  There's still enough for leftovers, after two people ate.

Yum! Easy to make and very tasty. I like this recipe because I can control the amount of coating, as I don't like things to be super-breaded (except for KFC :) ). The only things I did differently were to use minced garlic (lots!!) and pound the strips a little once they were in the bag of marinade to infuse them with more of the flavor.  Oh, and added garlic salt to the breading mixture.

I used cut up boneless, skinless chicken thighs, marinated them overnight and salted and peppered them before frying. I also added extra salt and pepper to the batter as well as some cumin and cayenne pepper so it wouldn't be bland. It turned out amazing!

My future wife is obsessed with chicken fingers, so for her birthday we did a tasting where I used six different recipes I found online.  This one was my personal favorite (and her second favorite).  It had the best flavor and a very good crunch.

The kids loved it at lunch though I didn't let the strips marinate long enough, but they were preseasoned. I clean and season the chicken before I freeze it.  Maybe that helped, because they were tasty.

These were super good chicken fingers!  I used only half the garlic powder.  I also served these with the Zaxbys chicken finger sauce recipe from this site.  Excellent meal the whole family enjoyed.

Made this quite a few times now and LOVE it! My daughter is an extremely picky eater and I never have a problem getting her to eat these when I make them. I actually make about half of this with chicken chunks instead of strips for her. As good, if not better than, Chic-fil-a, hands down! I use the seasoned bread crumbs because I like a lot of flavor. Also, I use the powdered buttermilk (just follow the recipe on that) and it's awesome. ALSO, I have had to make this in an hour, so didn't get to marinade the whole 2-4 hours and it was STILL delicious :)

Left out the breadcrumbs to keep chemicals/preservatives out of the finished product.  You can safely replace the breadcrumbs with an extra cup of flour, or leave it out and have extra salty chicken.  My kids noticed the garlic flavoring and commented that it was good.  I think this recipe needs to be used often!  Moist, crispy, and best if you can use organic chicken like we do.

I made this but on a more skinny receipt.  Absolutely delicious!  I used very thin boneless breast and one egg.  Used a very small amount of breading.  I pan fried it with Grape seed oil which is lighter.  It took 15 minutes and there was not much to drain.  Tasted like fried chicken.

We made this recipe a week ago and the family has been asking for it ever since. I'm making it again tonight and the family was asking if it was the same recipe. I assured them it was the same recipe and they were filled with delight. Lol. We use Almond milk rather than cows milk and no need to change the recipe. This recipe is absolutely wonderful! Hope you enjoy as much as we do!

First time with this recipe... Great taste... I did it a little different... I used fresh spices with plain crumbs... I only let it sit in buttermilk for 20 mins.... I also let some of the grease soak out of them, and then dipped them in franks hot sauce... Amazing... Then served them with honey mustard... I should have let them soak a little longer but I was hungry lol...

Everyone liked it but personally thought it needed more flavor/seasoning.  Next time, will use fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, double the salt and add some black pepper.

Made this last night. It was a SUPER hit with the family. My daughter kept 'taste-testing' the tenders, rating them the best she ever had, which my son heartily agreed to, between bites. They buy chicken finger subs all the time, so this says a lot. I zinged the recipe a bit, adding Franks Hot Sauce to the egg/buttermilk mixture. I also added black and cayenne pepper to the breading mix. I also followed the advice of a few other reviewers, using a 1/2 bread crumb, 1/2 Panko mix (double breaded, too.)

Prepared exactly as described last night, other than cooking it in my electric frying pan.  Tender, moist and very flavorful!  Today, I had the leftovers cold and dipped in ranch dressing - again, excellent.  thanks for sharing this recipe!

What a wonderful recipe !! My nine years old boy like it sooo much and he asked me to make it again & again .. Thanks for this recipe & for the reviews that mentioned how to make the buttermilk (put 1 cup milk w/ 1 T lemon juice and let sit for 10 min) Also I didn't fried it in the oil but I used the Tefal Actifry 2 in 1 .. it was fantastic !!!

These were great. Note: Only fry them for a small amount of time on each sign. They get tough quickly. (I will bake them at 350 for 30 mins just as a user suggested).

This was pretty good for home-made. I did what one review suggested, which was to marinate the chicken tenders un-refrigerated for about 20 minutes. In my case I left them to marinate for about 1 hour. The problem I had was what several people complained about which was that the breading came off in clumps. Next time I will try using Panko and I will double-dip them in the breading and maybe even let the breading set for about 10 minutes before frying them. I also added some hot sauce to the marinade, as well as creole seasoning to the breading. Yummy!

It's hard to find a recipe that can compete with mom's amazing chicken. This had the family coming back for more!  I made a batch of this for Sunday family dinner and it was a hit!  Only marinated for about an hour because I was limited with time, yet it still turned out amazing. I'm someone who is all about the breading and thought a single coat was just right. The chicken was juicy and tender from the marinade and garlicky n crispy on the outside. Perfect combo!  The only additions I made were a little onion powder right after they're out of the oil. This is a keeper!!!

This recipe is great! I make it as it is, except I pan fry in 1/2 of oil, to conserve oil. You can only make 2-3 batches before the oil gets too much sediment.

Such a great recipe/method.  Made these for dinner tonight along with "mom's best mac and cheese" from this site and I have to say this was a big hit!  My INCREDIBLY picky son loved them as did the rest of us and I have to say I will never waste money on store bought again.  I made them according to recipe with only one change and that was to "double dip" them as many reviewers suggested....thanks for the great recipe. (just had one cold straight from fridge and still delish and crispy!)

Awesome taste! For me it was the perfect amount of seasoning.  These aren't the fingers that come out with that thick crunchy breading, but I think they are perfect. I used mostly seasoned panko but didn't quite have enough so added some plain bread crumbs.  Of course all panko would have been even better! I fried mine and then cooked them in a 350 oven for 8 mins to ensure they were cooked all the way.  I expected this to dry out the smaller pieces but NOPE!  They were all tender!  I'm sure from marinating them in the buttermilk!  Ty for this awesome recipe!  Next time I'm gonna try baking them and spraying themm with Olive oil spray to crisp them.

One of the better chicken tender recipes I have tried. Although I followed review advice and added extra spices to the marinade, next  time I may add spices to both the marinade and bread crumbs!

Made these for a potluck but cut chicken up into bite size pieces. Followed the recipe exactly  except I double breaded them. the second time through I breaded them individually because it was easier with the small pieces. First batch came out really bland but then I added a cajun spices and it was delicious! Got many compliments!

I skipped soaking the chicken in the buttermilk and just used regular milk. For an extra crunchy coating I did two rounds of coating. These were crispy and really good! (I used a bit of garlic powder in with the actual flour coating too)

SOOOO good.  Even my 7 year old who claims to "hate chicken" ate 3 fingers!  I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own with 1 C milk, 1 T lemon juice.  I did as other reviewers suggested and double dipped (milk/egg mixture to flour mixture, back into milk/egg mixture and then flour mixture) and they were perfect . . . crispy outside and juicy inside. I didn't have time to marinate and they still turned out so yummy. Thanks for a great recipe!

I did not love these.  They were pretty dry and flavorless.  The kids weren't thrilled either.  It was a lot of work for a mediocre result.  Of course, maybe I did something wrong, but I'm not inclined to give these another try.

marinade is ok....breading is not crispy....suggest using more egg in the marinade or bath in egg whites prior to flouring. This will make the breading crispy and extremely tasty.

Love this recipe!  My husband and I use it to make chicken nuggets.  We use this as a base and add more spices (onion, more garlic, cayenne, etc) to the batter to make them even more delicious.

My husband and stepdaughter liked them. I personally didn't but I'm not a big meat eater. So I based my rating on their like. From a cook standpoint they were very easy to make. I marinated them overnight kinda on accident. I had planned to make that night but something came up and ended making the next night. I used tenderloins instead of cutting chicken breast up.

These were so good. The only thing I did different was - added 1 1/2 tsp garlic to the dry & wet mix, fresh parsley & basil also to dry & wet mix. I didn't have buttermilk, used buttermilk substitute, 1 c milk & 1 tbs w. vinegar.

This recipe is great as is, I teach a high school cooking course and this is probably my students' favorite recipe. The only change I make (for those who like a little heat) is to add Sriracha to the buttermilk/egg mixture. I start out with probably 1 tablespoon, and may add more if my guests like more spice.

Great recipe, easy set up and clean-up.  My family said the strips were great, and I love using buttermilk whenever I can!  Make sure the oil is hot enough so the chicken doesn't get greasy.

Excellent breading recipe...by far the best Ive made.  I did add extra garlic powder, onion powder and some black pepper to the breading mix and only had time to let marinate for 1 hour.  Still really, really good.  My only question - posed to anyone with a solution - how can I make chicken fingers w/o making such a HUGE mess :(

Fabulous!!  We used less garlic powder the first time, just to be on the safe side.  They were absolutely fantastic!!!  We've tried other recipes but this one is a keeper!!

I didn't have the time to soak the chicken for 2 hours, but it was still nice and moist.  I used the 'lemon juice in milk for 10 mins' suggestion since I had no buttermilk, seemed to work fine.  Cooked them in a cast iron skillet on the stove top.  The breading stayed on pretty well.  Oh, I did add 2T of Parmesan cheese to the dry mixture.  I used standard, Italian bread crumbs the first time (wanted to try it) but prefer the crispiness of Panko so I'll probably use those in the future.  BF gave these 5 stars and so did my 16 year old son.  Thanks for the recipe.  Update:  my guys ask for these almost every week.  The photo is of tenders using Italian Panko crumbs and also some mashed potato flakes added to dry mix, plus the grated parmesan.  We love these!

Absolutely delicious! 10 stars plus! This is the only way I make chicken fingers now.  I have marinated them anywhere from one hour up to six hours and the results are perfect either way.  I do fry them, however, in a shallow pan of oil.  The garlic powder adds just the right touch.  They are crispy and never soggy.  Thanks Janet for the perfect recipe.

These were good, not over the top.  Just regular chicken tenders.  Nice and tender.  Next time I will add some spices as suggested by other reviewers.

My family loves this recipe!  We will never buy breaded chicken from the store again!  I usually don't have buttermilk on hand, so I use 1 cup of milk, and I melt a little butter into the mixture to thicken it.  I also use fresh garlic for the marinade instead of garlic powder.  I also usually double to baking powder, and add some garlic powder and oregano, and black pepper to the breading to add a little more flavor.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!

My wife and I enjoyed these chicken fingers. We were a little disappointed because the picture looked just like Chick-Fil-A but were nowhere near as flavorful. I just cut 2 large breasts into strips and marinated them. I followed the instructions (and double-dipped and -coated them) but the breading wanted to fall apart. 4 out of 5 because our expectations were higher. Still a great recipe!

So easy and good!  I increased the breading 1.5x as suggested and double-dipped.  Also increased seasonings and lightly salted after frying and putting on wire rack.  My husband loved these and even drove home from work to eat the leftovers the next day - huge compliment from him!

We loved these. I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so I added some garlic, onion, and cayenne powder with some salt and pepper to some panko crumbs instead. I did double dip mine so I doubled the flour crumb mixture. They were perfect and juicy. I love the idea of marinating in buttermilk. I will be making these again as my kids love chicken nuggets!!

Everyone loved these. I used Ritz crackers in place of bread crumbs and use Italian seasoning.  I also coated them twice.  I had to double the recipe to have enough for for my family of four.  They really indulged :)

I made this recipe and loved it.  Once cooked I chilled it over night and packed it for a road trip.  It was very good the next day right out of the picnic basket.  This will be on the menu often at my home.

This was pretty good.  The chicken was very tender.  I just breaded by hand instead of using the bag method.  Also, I followed othere user's reviews and breaded, dipped in egg (I used egg substitute) and then dipped in breading again.  This made a thick breading.  It was good with bbq sauce and with honey mustard, too (we used Ken's brand Honey Mustard salad dressing...delicious).

These were very tasty,but I may have done something wrong,because the breading kept slipping off of mine.I've made different fingers before,and this wasn't the case.My boyfriend and I both loved the taste (but he didn't care how they looked,he just wanted fried chicken,and it 'all ends up at the same place' he says) so I wish I knew what the problem was.Very good tasting,though,we had a great dinner with these,hashbrown casserole,and greens.Thanks!

This recipe has potential but needs a little work. Maybe one of those who really likes this can experiment with improvements.   Like others, I added spices to both the batter and the breading. It helped the taste a lot, as did a honey-mustard dipping sauce. Also, the double-dipping of the batter and breading helped. These weren't bad, but they weren't that great either.

Really good!  BF has been asking for fried (not oven fried) chicken and although daunted by the idea of that much oil, I decided to indulge him and, boy are these good.  The only thing I did differently was to add about 2 tb Frank's Wing Sauce to the buttermilk/egg mix and I'm glad I did.  It added a nice kick to it, but obviously this is a matter of preference... Not a good addition for kids or those who don't like heat.  Point being, he was happy and I'll be hitting the gym!  Totally worth it :)

Great recipe.   I usually never have buttermilk so  I place a Tablespoon of white vinegar with a cup of milk and let sit for 15 minutes. I use it instead of the buttermilk and follow the recipe just as it is.  Delicious every time.

Very good - very filling.  I followed some recommendations such as double breading and this turned out much better than I had hoped.  I definitely thought it needed more seasoning - I added some creole seasoning and lots of pepper to the breading and would probably add a little more next time.

Absolutely Amazing.  My family could not say enough about these chicken fingers.  I also took the advice of another member, and after I tossed them in the breadcrumb mixture, I re-dipped them into the egg/buttermilk mixture and then re-coated them again in the crumb mixture.  I also substituted Panko bread crumbs for ordinary bread crumbs and they came out so crispy.  My family insists on these fingers over the local restaurant ones.  I served it with the “Honey mustard Dressing II" from this site.

I thought this recipe was okay, but not really worth all the work.  I would make it again, but not marinate for so long.  The chicken turned out really crisp and my kids liked it.  I just think that taking the time to marinate was probably not necssary.

Oh my goodness!  I am so glad I tried this recipe!  The down side is that my family and friends want me to make it all the time!  
Thanks for sharing this- we do not go out for chicken fingers anymore.  Why, when these are so much better?!?

Success!!!!! Not a fried food fan myself but decided to give "Himself" a treat. He LOVED this - served with Honey Mustard Dressing and asked for this recipe to be made for upcoming party. 
I did add paprika, chicken stuffing and cayenne as another review suggested. 
Next time might add a bit of dried chilli as well.

I followed a few of the other members suggestion. I double battered and I tried baking them. When i took the out of the oven...the batter wasn't fully cooked...and they were still quite white. I was making home made fries as well, so I through them in the oil for around 30 seconds. They turned out perfect.

These chicken fingers, or as my kids call them, "clucker dunkers" due to the kids menu at Village Inn, were really tasty. My 4 year old son, who is a very picky eater absolutely LOVED these! We'll definitely be making them again!!!

I could not believe how good these turned out.  I didn't double dip them like some other reviewers advised and I thought they were really tender.  And this recipe was really easy.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

I unfortunately didn't have the time to completely try this recipe. I was starving and so I skipped over soaking the chicken in buttermilk and garlic (I was also lacking buttermilk) and simply used the breading recipe. SO delicious! I live overseas and have been missing the resturaunt-style chicken strips from back home, and this just hit the nail on the head. I also double dipped as others had suggested. This recipe will definitely be used often.

I've made this a few times. It's great. I substitute the powdered garlic and use fresh instead. I make a few portions and freeze them- why buy processed store bought when this is as easy and so much better? Try it- you'll love it!

I did not use the garlic powder since I had made roasted potatoes with garlic. I used chicken cutlets and only marinated for 30 minutes. This was a super tasty breading and it stuck on! Everyone loved the chicken - no leftovers! Will definitely use this recipe again.

Just wonderful. It needed more garlic however for our taste. Very easy to make. I did roll in crumb mixture twice and the resulting fngers were moist and flavourful. I also used  non-stick pan and cooking spray to cut down on fat. Thanks, Janet.

My husband is such a picky eater and when we had these for dinner his comment was,"These are good, REALLY GOOD"! That is so huge for him and these chicken fingers are that good. They are so juicy and tender, even as leftovers the next day. The only change I made was using Panko for the bread crumbs and then seasoning to our liking and that was only because I was out of the other stuff. Make sure to watch them when cooking as mine cooked up very fast. Really good with the honey mustard dressing II from this site. Seriously, you don't want to pass this recipe up!

Easy and yummy! Did as others suggested and double dipped for extra crunchiness. Used a deep fryer but will try baking next time. Delish!  Served with Honey Mustard II sauce from this site--great dinner!

My family was hungry & I needed something FAST. I added seasoned salt & pepper to the mixture, but didn't let it marinate. I added paprika & crushed corn flakes to the flour/bread crumb mix. These turned out so good! I will plan ahead next time so that the meat can marinate for a few hours. I bet it is even better! Thanks!

great, I skipped the bread crumbs and just used flour, and added some paprika into the flour mixture. Kids really liked it.

I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1% milk instead. And I didn't realize that it needed to refrigerate for so long, so I just let it set in the milk mixture while my deep fryer heated up. They still turned out flavorful and tender. I used the suggestion of double-battering the chicken tenders and I think that is a must!! We will use this again!!

Great recipe!  My entire family loves these.  I've cooked many times for dinner and have passed this one on to several friends.  Last year I cut the chicken into nuggets prior to cooking and served them at our annual Halloween Party.  After they were cooked and drained, I placed half in a large covered bowl and poured some warmed BBQ sauce over them - covered and shook them to coat.  They were a big hit awith both the adults and children.  People have already asked if I'm serving them again this year.  A definate keeper....thanks for sharing.

Excellent!!! I added cajun seasoning along with the garlic powder.  I also used this recipe to make Chicken Parm, only I used Italian seasoning instead of cajun.  The longer you marinate the better!

This is a definite keeper, ten times better then the restaurant style!  I used two packages of Tyson's chicken ternderloins and marinated them for about 4 hours.  This made a lot of chicken and there is only three pieces left!! DH ate a ton

I had a lot of breasts that I wanted to use up so I did a LOT of these and they were great. 
I also froze a lot of them (cooked) and they are great to have on hand. They nuke very well.

I am a veg, so I didn't try these myself, but they went very quickly at a party I had.They were very tender. I used the frozen tender strips rather than slicing the breast myself, and they worked out great!

This is the only recipe I use now for chicken fingers.  If you are going to go to the bother of dipping and frying, this recipe is so worth it.  I add a few more seasonings, to suit our taste.  Excellent!

Despite my aversion of frying, these turned out really well. My husband stopped several times during his meal to tell me how good these were, and even exclaimed "These are the best chicken nuggets I've ever had." Served with a variety of dipping sauces, and am serving the leftovers on a nice big green salad for dinner tonight. Versatile food, delicious meal!

Delicious- even my husband, who does not like chicken, liked this recipe! 

  Simple to prepare as well. I have always been leery of deep frying...a mental stumbling block I have. But, after making this, I was suprised to see how easy it can be!

These are delicious.  I couldn't find any seasoned bread crumbs except for Italian so I just added some typical fried chicken spices of my own.  One word of caution...the second time I made them they wound up going back into the fridge overnight after they were floured.  I thought this would be okay but they seemed to cook twice as fast the next day and turned out kind of dry.  Other than that, I would strongly recommend.  Wish someone could tell me what the buttermilk does other than make the flour adhere better.  I know many "old fashioned" cooks swear by it for fried chicken but I don't know why.

This is such a wonderful recipe.  They are so easy to prepare and always turn out golden crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I serve these with blue cheese dressing and hot sauce.  Those of you who have a fear of frying will be delighted at your new found talents.  Even my husband found these acceptable.  I live for such moments!!!!!!

WONDERFUL! These turned out so moist inside. I used a deep fryer and use the substitute for buttermilk (milk & vinagar). Thanks for the GREAT recipe, will make often!!

These were good, I cut them too thick and didn't realize how thin they should've been, they were still great, you'll need some kind of dipping sauce to go with these, they were even great the next day heated in the microwave!

This recipe is so yummy and so easy. The buttermilk marinade made them so tender.  I used chicken tenders and that worked really well.

Husband bought plain bread crumbs so I added creole seasoning to the flour mixture.  I also marinated it overnight.  I also added the creole seasoning to the marinate mixture.  the chicken was super moist and the flavoring was perfect.  Definately a keeper.

now this is a great recipe for chicken, if you like it hot add alittle crushed red pepper. I made spicy chicken sandwhiches with fresh tomatoes. The strips would be good in a wrap with ranch and shredded lettuce endless possibility's with this one.

This recipe was great.  I made chicken fingers and only had two left and that's only because I made my husband stop eating them so that I can have them for lunch the next day.  I bet the leftovers tasted great over a salad.

MY family and I really enjoyed this. I think it was the best chicken fingers I have had. We used a honey mustard dressing to dip with. For some reason ranch didn't go well for a dipping sauce.

The chicken strips had great flavor, not the traditional homestyle fried chicken flavor, but worth the time.  They were great the next day on a salad.  I also used the Honey Mustard II recipe and the dressing really complemented the chicken.

These chicken strips were terrific!  I was short on time and buttermilk, so I subbed milk/vinegar and marinated for only about an hour.  Made a honey mustard dip to go with.  We'll absolutely have this often!  I'd like to try using chicken breasts pounded thin and put them on Kaiser rolls with Swiss.

Excellent homemade fried chicken, though not the "down south" kind (no gravy here). The chicken is doesn't dry out. My husband loves this recipe. Don't go too heavy on the garlic.

Rcv'd good reviews for this recipe.  Next time I will just open the spice cabinet and go wild with the flour mixture.  Really loved the Honey Mustard recipe one reviewer offered.  Best part is that I premade everything and just fried up when I was ready.  Leftovers the next day were pretty good too!

Double dipping is the way to GO!  These are so good!  The only change I made was that I did not use butter milk (but regular milk) and I added some black pepper.  My husband even said they are better than MINE!  LOL

They were OK. Wasn't that flavorful. Maybe because I didn't use any buttermilk. I'll probably make them again next time with the bmilk.

I didn't have any buttermilk so I used milk and it worked well.  The flavor was pretty good...I think next time I will add more seasoning to the breadcrumbs.  I will make again.

I prepare recipes as-is before making any adjustments. However, in this recipe I have found that it needs know adjustments. Delicious!! The chicken came out tender. My family loved them. Next, time I will double the recipe.

Great chicken strips! Crunchy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. I put minced garlic into the marinade and added a dash of ground cayenne, coarse black pepper and poultry seasoning into the flour/bread crumbs. Good stuff, definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed the directions precicely, except I was a little crunched for time and only allowed the chicken to marinate for 1 1/2 hours.  Great with a side of coleslaw!  I will certainly make it again.

I put fresh garlic (I'm not a fan of the dried stuff) into the buttermilk and put it in the fridge for a few hours. Didn't change anything else and my family absolutely devoured each and every last piece. This is going to become a favorite!

These were pretty good.  The breading did not stay on as well as some other methods I've used.  I really spiced up the flour/bread crumbs with some cajun spice, poultry seasoning, garlic powder.  I made a light sauce with the drippings and some lemon juice, white wine and chicken broth and poured it over the chicken and some pasta.

Its not often that I find a food that all of my family likes.  This recipe certainly accomplished that.  I marinated overnight and added a little extra garlic.

This was pretty good but a little too greasy for my taste.  The flavor was really good and the batter was fluffy. Thanks for the receipe.

Very easy to make. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The only thing is you need more batter, especially if you are double dipping. It came out crispy and flaky but by the time I finished frying the rest of the chicken the crust did get soft. For a family of four 3 chicken breast would of been plenty. Over all great recipe and I will be using again. My kidsand husband loved them. Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times and always ment to submit my review.  I gave some to the neighbors kids and they ran home to ask their mother to get the recipe.  Adults and kis both love this recipe.  I usually  serve a homemade honey mustard sauce with it. Truly delicious!!!

This recipe was yummy. I followed a few suggestions that other reviewers listed. I used milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk, and also added minced garlic to marinade. I also put a dash of season salt in the flour/breadcrumb mixture. I deep fried them instead of pan and they turned out great. I will definatly make these again!

This recipe was pretty good.  I let it marinade from Saturday evening and made it on Monday night.  There was just a slight garlic flavor even though I added the amount of garlic powder the recipe recommended plus 4 diced cloves of fresh garlic.  I also had to add tons of other flavors to the flour like soul food seasoning, chicken seasoning salt, etc (the regular seasoning that I add to fried chicken).

These chicken fingers were delicious. I used chicken tenders and marinated them in buttermilk and minced garlic. Instead of seasoned bread crumbs, I used Panko.(You can find this in the oriental section of the market). For dipping sauces, I offered honey mustard sauce (found on this website), ranch dressing and barbeque sauce. I will definetely make this chicken again and again.

I didn't really like this recipe, I wanted to give it a 3, but my parents really liked it, and my mom thought it deserved a 5, so I compromised and gave it a 4. It certainly doesn't put any chicken nuggets to shame... it was pretty good, but it wasn't really anything spectacular and I think all the hours it spent soaking up garlic/buttermilk in the fridge didn't really do much. I wanted something with a little more flavor. Maybe if I make it again I will add some fresh minced garlic to exaggerate the flavor.

Great recipe!  I made these a month ago when I was in the mood for bar food but not the bar.  I used the milk/lemon juice instead of buttermilk and used crunched up pepperridge farm dry stuffing for the bread crumbs (b/c I don't have any plain bread crumbs).  Fried in a cast iron skillet and was such a hit with baked seasoned potato wedges!

They were great!  My 2 & 3 year old loved them.
We had them once marinated & once without marinating.  My husband & I are used to spicier things, so might add some spices next time.

This was the best chicken I have ever made, my son said that it tasted better than the chicken fingers he gets at his favorite restaurant, the first time I tried it w/out the buttermilk, and it still tasted great.  I definately will keep using this recipe, its' great with a white country gravy.

This was a good recipe for chicken fingers.  The buttermilk is what makes this chicken so tender.  I will make these again.

This recipe rocked!!  I was having a craving for some good ol' fashioned chicken fingers and this was absolutely the best!! I didn't have time to marinate, but the flavor was still wonderful!! Next time I will definitely marinate so even more flavor will come out.  I can't say enough about this.  Will definitely become part of my recipe box!!!

This was a good recipe. My kids loved it. My 2year old daughter was eating the chicken cold the next day. My son also ate them when he came home from school. I took them with me to work and they were really tasty.

If you like chicken and you like garlic then try this recipe and you will say it's the best dish you've had in a long time.  I have sent this recipe to family and friends.  They all loved it. My fussy husband raved about it.  Thanks for the recipe Janet.

Yummy.  I can't leave recipes alone, so instead of garlic powder and salt, I used Old Bay seasoning powder in the marinade and coating.  Instead of half flour and half breadcrumbs, I used a third cup each of flour, cornmeal, and breadcrumbs for a very, very crunchy crust. Boy, my meat and potatoes hubby didn't leave me any leftovers.

OK, I have REALLY picky children and my husband is no better.  I was just about to send my husband out for popcorn chicken from KFC because it's one of the few ways I can get meat into my 4 year old.  Then I thought I'd check this site.  I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.  It turned out just like popcorn chicken!!  Hooray!!  I did add a pinch of this and that to season it a bit more.  Also, I didn't have time for marinating, so I skipped the buttermilk and just dipped the pieces in egg first.  Since they were small and cooked quickly, they were as tender as could be.  Great job!!!

If you can manage to keep any leftovers with this recipe, the chicken works great for sandwiches the next day.  I will be making this chicken again!

These are so delicious. Although they take a little bit of time, they are very easy to make. I'd like to try them with a ranch dressing dip.

Yum. Does anyone know how long to bake this for? See, I don't fry food because of the high fat content and would like to enjoy this by baking it as opposed to frying.

All of my "meat-eaters" complimented me on this chicken.  I didn't have buttermilk, so used 1% milk mixed with a spoon of vinegar.  Turned out fine.

This is a wonderful recipe~I just tried it today, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it turned out!  The chicken was sooo tender, it just melted in your mouth.  I have already recommended this recipe to my friends!  I assure you that if you like chicken fingers, these will be the best ones you have ever had!
