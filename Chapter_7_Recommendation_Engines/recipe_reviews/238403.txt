Excellent and a beautiful sauce; I made this some time back and am finally posting the pic. We paired it with bacon-wrapped, stuffed rabbit medallions and was exquisite. I used a food processor to mix.

I made this with dinner the other night and it was fantastic!! I hate fish, so I was a little worried about the anchovy paste, but it's honestly delicious!! :) Thank you, Chef John!

I made it for Mothers Day to accompany Puttenesca Sauce for spaghetti on homemade bread as a spread.  Wow, it is not just for steak anymore.  We are thinking it would be great as a white (green) sauce on pasta.  Great stuff and as with so many other thing you can make it yours.  I used some Truffel oil in the mix.
