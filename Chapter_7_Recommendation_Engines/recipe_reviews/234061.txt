More, more, I want more! This is worthy of 10 stars! I wasn't sure what size eggplant to use - the one I used was about a medium size. I didn't use all of it, probably about 2/3 of it. I ended up slicing up 10 slices using my mandolin. The mandolin ensures even slices and is such a time-saver. Next time I will do about 12 slices (3 rollups per person)because I had a bit of goat cheese left over.  I used a 12oz jar of roasted red peppers (there were 2 peppers in the jar), since I couldn't find canned. If you don't feel like dicing the peppers, you could also just cut them in strips and lay a couple down the middle of each slice of eggplant.  The flavor of these is PERFECT, and this comes together easily. The first few I tried were warm, and then I later tried a couple that were room temp. Both delicious! Very impressive appetizer or side for company! Thank you BUSYBEE25 for the fabulous recipe!

Easy to make and tastes great. Don't cut the eggplant too thin because it gets thinner as you grill it and can tear when you spread the goat cheese on it. I made it just like the recipe said, then, with the leftovers, I added tomato sauce and fresh basil which was delicious!

Had to substitute cream cheese for the goat cheese. Thanks for teaching us how to grill eggplant. We added garlic and Asiago cheese. Looks as elegant as it tastes.

I didn't have goat cheese but had everything else handy so I used light cream cheese (sparingly).  Even the finicky husband who has always turned his nose up at eggplant loved it.  The advice to use a mandolin to slice made this a breeze!

Very delicious.  I used zucchini, as part of a challenge, sliced length wise on a mandolin and let them air dry to remove some of the moisture.  Thinly julienned fresh red pepper and pan grilled .  Did as suggested and put the pan grilled zucchini on a rack to cool.  I was lucky I even got to try one as RD snatched them all up.

This was delicious!  I didn't have regular goat cheese so I used Apricot & Thyme crumbled goat cheese from Vermont Creamery. The subtle apricot flavor really paired nicely with the roasted red pepper. Yum!!

The grilled eggplant is delicious, however, we did not like the combination of the eggplant with the goat cheese & pepper. I will definitely grill the eggplant like this again and serve it plain.

I REALLY wanted to like these. I bought a beautiful eggplant just to make this recipe. I read the reviews and followed some of the suggestions, like using a mandoline to cut the eggplant splices a little thicker. I don’t know what happened, but when by the time we finished grilling the eggplant slices, several were ripped in the middle, making it much more difficult to spread the cheese and roll up. I will admit that I don’t like goat cheese, but I used cream cheese as another user suggested. It worked well with the roasted red peppers. But, the assembly on these took far too long because of the “grill” disaster. And, although I liked the flavour of each component very much, it was just “meh” when put together.

Took the shortcuts: grilled without soaking, used cream cheese and used a pepper onion jelly .  Delicious.  Would be great for company.

Heavenly!  This are simply amazing. I got high praise from everyone who tasted them and was asked for recipe many times over.  I used an Italian bread dipping seasoning instead of plain old Italian seasoning.

This was our first taste of goat cheese.  I could only find it with herbs already in it  but it was very tasty.  Nice tang to it and a cream cheese like consistency.  Personal preference would be to have the eggplant breaded and broiled for this recipe.  Maybe a schemer of pesto for some added flavor.  I roasted my own red pepper in place of the jarred.  Lots you can do with this recipe!  Will be making again.
