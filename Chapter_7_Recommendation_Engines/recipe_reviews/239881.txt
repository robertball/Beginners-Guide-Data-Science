Good recipe to start with. The nice thing is, you can doctor it up or down, depending on your spice rack inventory. I tried this recipe because I bought some Mayocoba Beans from the markdown bin, and had never heard of them. They plump up nice and have a nice buttery texture.

I made this soup exactly like your recipe ingredients and it came out delicious. The only exception is that I used my pressure cooker and made it simply by adding all the ingredients  at once and it was done in 15 minutes!  It was amazing!  Im making it again today.... hoping to remember to take a picture to post.  Thank you for the great recipe.  It's a keeper. Love it!

Hot, delicious soup! I also bought my beans on the clearance rack. These beans do have a great buttery flavor that works with a nice contrast to the heat in this soup. You can adjust the heat by adding the the jalapenos  until you're happy with the heat you want. I enjoyed vinegar in the pickled jalapenos.  Complex flavors, yummy! I didn't do the bacon only because I didn't want the added fat. I got plenty of flavor by using  ham hocks. I'm sure the bacon step would be delicious! I will be looking for these beans again and making this soup many times!

This is a great dish, especially for cold weather! I would recommend making a double batch and freezing the leftovers as it is fairly labor

What is there to dislike about this? The kitchen is awash in the smell of cooked onions, freshly chopped cilantro, fried bacon and ham. I personally could see adding a few more peppers but I happen to lean that way and was unable to detect any particular heat to the dish. Perhaps I used too much water as there was no amount recommended, just a vague height about the beans in the pot. All in all, my kitchen is a mess and this is one I would do again!

Fantastic recipe.  Added a ham bone while cooking beans. Substituted the 7oz can of pickled jalapenos with 14 oz can of drained pickled carrots and jalapenos.  Also substituted the mexican beer for a pale ale I had available.  Thank you for posting!

Amazing recipe. Probably one of my favorite things to make, especially when the peppers are coming on in my garden. I like putting habaneros in it.
