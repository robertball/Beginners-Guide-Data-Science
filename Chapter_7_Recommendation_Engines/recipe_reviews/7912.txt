They were delicious, moist and fluffy. I made some changes as suggested by other members. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, added 1 tea spoon cinammon and 1/2 of nutmeg. I substitued the sugar with 1/4 cup of splenda and added 1/2 cup walnuts and used also canola oil.
Thank you for the recipe, I did it 3 times and it was always the same result (very easy and delicious)
By the way the cooking time was less than suggested by the recipe and be sure if you have them for breakfast you won't feel hungry at all. I eat them one hour before I start fasting. They make you  feel full.

I thought these muffins were pretty good.  I tried to be healthy and used 2 cups whole wheat flour and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I will make again.  Thank You.

For some variation, substitute apple sauce for vegetable oil and add 1 tsp. ground cinnamon and 1 tsp. ginger.  The smell will warm your whole house.

I modified this a lot -- used 1 1/2c whole wheat, 1/2c oatmeal.  Replaced 1/2 the white sugar with brown sugar, used applesauce instead of oil and added a lot of spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cardamom.  Yum!

i used all whole wheat flour (no white flour), added about 1/3 cup of chocolate chips and sprinkled sugar on the tops of these before baking and they came out awesome!

These could be good if you make some changes.  They tasted decent when they came out of the oven, but when the cooled off they became very hard.  Use apple sauce instead of oil, to make moist.  Add like a cup of blueberries.  Add more sugar.  The recipe was just lacking in taste and moisture.  Add 2-3 TB of honey.

I used a few different suggestions from other reviews.  I recently had my gall bladder removed and I am trying to make recipes with low fat ingredients. I substituted applesause(homemade) for the oil,used all wheat flour, used no fat milk and added 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg, used 1/4 tsp of ginger and I sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking. The muffins came out moist and delicous.  However, the next time I will not use any ginger. Taste is too strong in this recipe. I can't wait to try again.

Very good, basic muffin recipe. Can be easily adapted by adding fruit, etc. Add chopped chives to the batter and a cube of cheese in the center of each muffin tin before baking for "dinner" mufffins.

i needed a quick, healthy muffin recipe for my 2 stepkids...I only made have the recipe and subsituted a scant cup of Splenda for the sugar and used applesauce and cinnamon as recommended.  My kids loved it!  It was very moist and had a good light texture.  Next time however, I'm going to add more cinnamon and add other spices to make it more tasty.  Definitely a keeper!

I have a very picky 8 year old who wants everything 'plain'.  I was looking for something healthy that he could have for breakfast on our way to school.  This was perfect.  He enjoyed these lightly sweet muffins with a tall glass of milk.

Used brown sugar instead of white, 1/2 melted butter 1/2 applesauce instead of the oil (was out of oil) and added a lot of cinnamon/nutmeg and a bit of vanilla.  A tip that might make your life easier: you can make the batter the night before, spoon it into your muffin pan, cover and refrigerate overnight so all you have to do in the morning is pop it into the oven (add ~3 minutes to bake time).  Even better, freeze right in the muffin pan and then pop the batter balls out and into a Ziploc.  Pull out as many as you want, plop back into the muffin tin and bake (add ~5-7 minutes to bake time).  Never have an excuse not to have fresh-baked muffins in the morning again!

Good recipe if you're looking for a simple, lightly sweet bread-like muffin.  I modified by substituting half of the sugar with Splenda and replacing the vegetable oil with applesauce.  I also added 1 tsp Vanilla, 2 Tbsp cocoa powder, 1/2 cup chocolate chips (attempting to appeal to my 3 year old), and 3/4 cup finely grated carrot.  I think in general they would be better with raisins, cranberries, or blueberries.
A word of warning:  if you replace the oil with applesauce, don't use paper cups!  Mine stuck to the paper!!!

This is a great healthy recipe! I wanted the muffins to be very low in calories with lots of fiber so i used 2 egg whites instead of one whole egg, i replaced ALL the sugar for Splenda, i used all whole wheat flour and no white, i replaced the oil for unsweetened apple sauce, and finally i added 1 tablespoon of wheat germ and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. With all that the muffins are just under 100 calories and taste great! These are a great snack and breakfast food & im happy i came upon this recipe! Will make again! NOTE: Remember when cooking with Splenda that your baked items will cook much faster. It took these muffins only 10 minutes to be done.

These are god but I'm giving four stars for this for two reasons. First, because I added cinnamon and nutmeg, which made a BIG difference in the flavor, and also because they always seem to come out dry. I've made them several times, and I put extra milk and an extra egg but they are still a bit dry. I really like this as a base recipe for whole wheat muffins, because you can make your own additions or changes every time you make them. Also I used only ww flour.

These were like cupcakes when I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat Organic Flour!  Be sure to use the *Organic* White Whole Wheat, as this has the highest protein for lightness in taste & texture and is the favorite in the KAF Test Kitchens.  It acts almost like white flour.  I used all KAF Organic WWW, brown sugar for white and applesauce for oil.  Result: 100% Whole Wheat, High Fiber, Low Fat and Gorgeous with outrageous cupcake lightness and texture.

I made the base with: 2 cups whole wheat flour 1/2 cup white sugar (just under) 3 tsp baking powder a pinch of salt 3/4 cup skim milk 1/3 cup homemade apple sauce (apples water cinnamon) about a tbs of oil 1 egg 1 tsp cinnamon ground flax (1/2 tsp)  I made different versions: PLAIN-added butter to the base yum! SUGAR TOPPED-topped, with sugar WHOLE GRAIN BLUEBERRY-Extra cinnamon, blueberries, nutmeg, half of the sugar was brown, flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds APPLE-Extra apple sauce cinnamon and nutmeg, cubed apples HONEY-Mixed in honey, wasn't my favourite ROLLED OATS-Replace 1/2 cup flour with rolled oats. Can be used in combo with another alteration I did above  -All in all, they were yummy and healthy.  -The taste was very mild with the main flavour being my cannamon and nutmeg (I reccommend extra for the blueberry and apple versions).   -As I was making the batter it was very dry.  I will use more wet ingredients next time.   -I think that they were a little dry (after cooked too) because I used less oil to be healthy.   -In contradiction, although they were dry, I found they were a little doughy after cooked.   -The muffins rose very nicely in the oven. -I think they would be very good with a butter base instead of oil! -I baked them in 375 for 17 mins -I only got 10 muffins :(

This is an excellent recipe.  I also made the substitutions of oatmeal & applesauce per reviews & added chopped walnuts and golden raisins. I made 6 jumbo muffins instead of 12 regular size and they cooked in 20 minutes so be careful not to overcook.

Great basic recipe, though I did make a few modifications... I took the suggestion of another user and used applesauce instead of oil, and I also used all whole wheat flour instead of half white and half whole wheat. I added in around 1/3 cup of ground flax, as well as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (more cinnamon than anything else, but I kind of winged it!) and to compensate for the flax and the amount of whole wheat flour, added around 1/4 cup more almond milk (which I used instead of milk) and 1/4 cup more applesauce. I also added 1/4 cup of honey and cut back the sugar. The result: something that tastes kind of like a honey-whole-wheat muffin with a big of sweet spice. I'm also pretty sure that with some modifications you could make this a vegan recipe, or substitute sucralose for sugar for diabetics. Next time I may add grated apple, or substitute orange juice for milk and add dried cranberries. The possibilities are endless. Again, lovely basic recipe!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I'm currently eating from my second batch. I made it almost exactly as written (for the "all-purpose flour" I used "unbleached flour", and I suppose the "all-purpose" is implied). I found that 20 minutes of baking worked just fine for me, both times. These muffins came out light, fluffy, moist enough and slightly crumbly. The flavor is basic and slightly sweet, good for a little snack or a light breakfast muffin. And as suggested, they taste best when warmed. I've no doubt, as other reviewers have written, that these are a good base recipe to use to make your own variations, but I enjoy them as is. Thanks a bunch!

I made a mistake in placing the dry & liquid ingredients together before chucking it in the blender. But in the end it was all still good - the mixture still rose. I added some frozen blueberries just at the end which ended up being good. I also made a mistake & added olive oil instead of vegetable oil but in the end the muffins were moist, yummy and not too sweet like you get when you buy the pre-made mixtures at the supermarket. Overall a healthy and easy recipe to keep in the cookbook!

I replaced the sugar with half a cup of honey, the oil for half a cup of applesauce, the egg for two egg whites, and the flours for 2 cups of whole wheat flour. They came out delicious and moist. I will definitely make these again in the future.

These were good! I had to substitute flax seed for egg cuz I was out of eggs. I agree with a couple other reviews that they were slightly heavier like a bread than a muffin. However, that is more what I was going for this time so it worked out really well. 

Adding the cinnamon/nutmeg like several reviewers mentioned wouldn't hurt.  I opted to add chocolate chips to half the batch and cranberries/walnuts to the other and I sprinkled them all with coarse sugar. :) 

Thanks for the quick, easy and good recipe!

Love these as a basic recipe for all kinds of muffins. I use all whole wheat flour, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and about a tsp vanilla. I also like to add whatever berries are in season, or sometimes for a sweet treat, I like to add chocolate chips.

Loved these. I did use 2 cups of WW flour rather and added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon as well as a about 1/4 cup of chopped pineapple. Fantastic muffin, nice and fluffy too! I am very happy to have a whole wheat muffin option.

I made these wonderful muffins this morning as directed in the recipe but since I didn't have all purpose flour I used bread flour.  Substituted a little Splenda for the sugar as well. These muffins came out light and fluffy and yummy straight from the oven!
Yes, they are plain but since they are muffins, that's what I expected! When I want delicious, fancier cake recipes , I look on allrecipes and find those. But, for now, coffee and a muffin is making my morning wonderful!

Great base recipe. When I made as originally directed, I found it a little bland. But, after the following additions/changes, they are a hit with the family: added 1 small can of pineapple chunks with juice, 2 very ripe bananas-smashed, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2cup of shredded coconut.
I omitted the oil, cut back a bit on the sugar and added a splash of milk after mixing everything just to get the right consistency. This made 12 perfectly portioned muffins and they came out moist and flavorful. I try to replace oil and butter with fruit when I can.

After 3 attempts, changing the time/oven temperature, because the bottoms burned after baking for only 20 minutes at 400 degrees, I had to turn down the oven to 350 and bake for only 15 minutes. Finally! They turned out great. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and added some mini chocolate chips. My 1 year old loves them!

Great for modification. I revamped this with 1 1/2c whole wheat flour, 1/2c rolled oats, 1/2c splenda, 3tsp baking powder, 1/2tsp salt, 3/4c fat free milk, 2/3c applesauce, 1 egg, 1tbsp+1tsp flax seed, 2tsp cinnamon. my picky kids loved them and had no clue how healthy i had made the muffins.

I followed other's suggestions and these turned out wonderful!  I used 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. old fashioned oatmeal.  Also sprinkled in some cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.  Moist and yummy!  I am making another batch now, and plan on substituting half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.   Thanks for the recipe!  This is a good muffin recipe that doesn't have a million calories! - After making these with applesauce instead of some of the oil, I'd have to say they're not as good!  I may try again but only substitute 1/4 of it.

5 stars because this is a really good basic recipe. They came out nice and moist and fluffy. I was looking for something healthy and I will definitely make these again. With that being said these muffins are very plain just by themselves. I added blueberries and chopped apple as well as cinnamon. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I doubled it. Because others said that they had come out hard after they cooled off, I added a touch more milk to the batter just to make it not so thick. I made these last night and I didn't let them cool completely before I tried one and it stuck to the wrapper but this morning I had one and it did not stick. So definitely let them cool if your sharing or serving to friends or whatever. I think next time I will do blueberry/chocolate chip. Very good recipe. Thank you Jenn.

This recipe is a GREAT base to start from when trying to make a healthy muffin. I gave it 4 stars as I didn't think it was a good recipe just by itself... if you get creative though it's definitely 5 stars. I added a little bit of vanilla, and half a cup of chopped strawberries and raspberries, and some blueberries. I also used brown sugar rather than white. So good! Next I may try apple and cinnamon, and may use honey as the sweetener. I like the idea of using applesauce instead of sugar, and will do that when I next have some on hand!

I made this recipe a couple different ways. My favorite so far is to use all "white whole wheat flour" instead of mixing two different types and to add a teaspoon of vanilla and a cup of dried cranberries.

I tried to follow the other reviews to make this recipe both more healthy and tasty. First batch was dense and not very tasty. For the second batch I did 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purp, 1/4 heaping cup of splenda, 2 T honey, 1/4 sour cream, little less than 1/4 oil, 3/4 milk (may need to eyeball adding a bit more), the baking powder and salt along with a tsp of cinnamon, 1 banana, 1/3 choc chips on half the batch. You have to keep in mind that if you opt to use more whole wheat flour, you must have more wet ingredients in order to keep them moist. The second batch was very tasty and even my picky husband who only likes pure sweetness enjoyed them!

This is a great basic whole wheat recipe. I followed other reviewers advice and put in only whole wheat flour, a 1c brown sugar instead of 1/2c of white sugar, I added the cinnamon and the honey, but I also added in bananas and chocolate chips... it came out soooo moist, that it's hard to believe it was whole wheat, and I didn't have any applesauce.
Thanks for a great base, I'll use this to start off all my variations now! Thank you!

OMG these are good!  I used 2 C of whole wheat flour.  1/3 cup of agave, 3/4 c of cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4 c of skim milk, 3 bananas & 3TBLS of cocoa... the perfect snow day treat.  We ate them like we hadn't eaten in 3 days.  They did cook in less time also.  Great starter muffin recipe.

I just tried these myself & they are delicious! It seems to be a perfect base recipe or it's great on it's own. I used whole wheat flour for it all, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, raw sugar instead of white sugar, & added 1 tsp of cinnamon  & 1 tsp ginger like  someone else suggested. I drizzled some honey on top & it added a touch more of sweetness. My husband likes them & he is SO hard to please, especially things that are more healthy for you. Thanks!!

I have made this recipe multiple times and it has always worked out for me. I added 1 cup of froze n berries to the muffins and another time I made it with apples by adding 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and mixing 1 cup of chopped apples to the batter. Both tasted great! But with the berries you can not mix it to much with an electric mixer or your batter will turn gray:( ( I found by experience ) I also  topped them with a quick frosting.

This recipe was good but I did alter it a bit. I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup rolled oats and added chopped apples, walnuts, pecans, and about 1/8 cup chia seeds. Yummy and very filling!

Really good with a few minor modifications.  Low fat milk and splenda.   Also, instead of muffins I made bread.  Need to reduce heat to 350.

these were a great whole wheat alternative for the sonma diet i try to do. I added pumpkin pie spice and they had a nice flavor and were not too dry.

I really like these muffins. I made a few changes to the recipe. I used 1 cup of ground oatmeal instead of the all-purpose flour, 15 packs of Splenda instead of the sugar, applesauce instead of the oil and I added just a little cinnamon and vanilla.

I added the 1 t cinnamon and 1/2t nutmeg as suggested.  I found these to be moist enough and I can't wait to try them with some fruit.

Perfect muffins. I have been successful experimenting with add-ins, too -- so I plan to use this as my muffin "base" for other flavors.  Also, I baked them for less time than is indicated. Maybe my oven is just hot. ?

After reading other reviews, I decided to skip straight to some alterations that sounded good.  I did the 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup oats (no all-purpose flour), 1/4 cup white sugar+ 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/3 applesauce (no veg. oil), and I used instant non-fat dry milk (3 tbsp. milk powder plus 3/4 cup water = 3/4 milk) as I do for all of my baking when milk is required (saves having to keep as much fresh milk on hand).  The baking powder, salt, and egg were as directed.  I made sure not to over stir the batter and kept a close eye on the muffins in the oven which ended up coming out around 17 mins (my oven runs hot).  They turned out great!  Attractively craggy and rounded, rather dense as I expected with the applesauce substitution, and very tasty.  They were gently sweet, and with the added spices smelled so good while baking.  I will be making them again!  I enjoyed them with the "Delicious Vegan Hot Chocolate" recipe from this site.  That was a much sweeter and richer treat, which balanced these milder muffins.  I also look forward to trying other variations on this versatile recipe.

I added half a banana instead of all the oil. Then just a1 Tablespoon of oil.  Half brown half white sugar, and a cup of blueberries.  Alittle crumble on the top with oats, butter and brown sugar was excellent.  Next time I'll try with all whole wheat flour.  They were plenty moist.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe! It's really easily adapted. I've tried banana blueberry muffins by substituting the milk for bananas (I added a little milk to soften the mixture) and adding blueberries!

This muffin recipe is just the begining of many yummy things.  I tripled the recipe.  Then I divided it into three equal parts.  The first part I added 3/4 cups of fresh cranberries (cut into halfs), the second part I added 3/4 cup butterscotch chips and sprinkled with ground cinnamon before baking, and the third part I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 3/4 cups of chocolate chips!  ALL ARE GREAT!  WARNING!! The bake time according to the recipe is much too long (unless you are making jumbo muffins).  I adjusted the bake time to 13-15 mins and they were cooked perfectly.

Maybe I did this wrong, but they came out like kashi cookies. They were gummy in the middle and didn't puff up into muffins at all. I'll try a different muffin recipe next time.

A little heavy for my taste, but my husband loved them.  I used all wheat flour, added cinnamon, ginger and applesauce.  Also threw in raisins and cranberries.  They keep very well for over a week.

I followed the advice given by others (only whole wheat flour, added 1tsp. cinnimon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, capful of almond extract and a handful of dried cranberries) and these muffins came out delicious! Great to find a recipe (and additions) where I have everything always on hand.

These were so super easy and perfect for breakfast. They were good as they were, really moist and fluffy, but were also good when I cut them in half and put jam in them...mmmm. I did add a tsp of cinnamon as suggested by another member which did make a difference as well.

Turned out great! I used a half cup of berry flavored applesauce instead of oil, a little over a tablespoon of honey, and 2 cups of whole wheat flour. For half of the recipe, I also added some walnuts and rasins.  Will make again.

These are good as is (well I used all whole wheat pastry flour) but they only took 12 minutes in my oven-which is right on on temp.  Maybe this is why they are so dry for some?  They weren't dry for me but a little crumbly.

Wow!!! The muffins were awesome! I only got nine instead of twelve, and when I tasted them and found out how delicious they were, I was so sad that I didn't have more. I ate the last one for lunch today. I will have to make more soon. They were great!

I add buttermilk to the milk to make a whole cup.  Also I vary recipe with ground pecans or almonds, cinnamon, cardomon, and golden raisins or a dried fruit mixture.  Top them with sparkling sugar or cinnamon sugar.  Always get rave reviews!

These muffins were slightly sweet and very good. I made them just as written but the dough was very thick and heavy just like cookie dough. I added an extra 1/4cup of milk and they turned out perfect. Next time I may try some of the variations and additions suggested by other reviewers but my family liked these pretty much as the recipe is written. FranJ

I made two batches using this base recipe today, one blueberry and one cranberry. I added vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon, and subbed half the flour to whole wheat for the blueberry (personal preference, I do in all my baking). For the cranberry, I simply added a tiny bit of lemon extract, orange zest and the juice of the one mandarin I used... the blueberry is delicious and I’m dying to try the cranberry for dessert after dinner tonight! This makes a great fruit muffin base!!!

I have made this at least 10 times in the past few months! Tweaked the recipe a little to suit my needs. Used 1/2 cup oat meal,  1 and a 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. Added 50 ml more milk to the recipe. At the end 1 added 3 tbsp of honey.  Then I add 1/2 cup of dried blueberries since we don't always get fresh or frozen ones.
The recipe as it is, makes dry muffins. The changes I made, gave me less dry muffins and it is tastier.

Recipe is quite dry – probably needs more milk and oil. I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and a few drops of honey and the flavor was lovely! I cooked for 18 minutes and they were very well done, so I would even go so far as to say cook for 15-18 minutes, depending on how moist you want them. Good with frozen berries or chocolate chips

I had leftover eggnog and have never been happy with the taste of any eggnog bread recipes I've found, so with fingers crossed I tried this.  Subbed eggnog for the milk, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla, and threw in whole cranberries (too lazy to chop).  Makes them more tasty and moist.  Good enough and will keep for using next year's eggnog,  Yay! :)

Good muffins for those of us who enjoy the taste of whole wheat. I'm cutting refined flour and sugar out of my diet so I ended up using 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup oats, cinnamon, and nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers. I substituted 1/4 cup agave for the sugar and used 1/4 cup no sugar added mixed berry flavored apple sauce instead of the oil. They smelled fantastic as they were baking...16 min @ 400 degrees.

Delicious! I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and used 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1/2 c. oatmeal. I also replaced the oil by a similar amount of butter, and it worked fine.

Like others, I made these with all whole wheat flour.  I also substituted 1/3 c + 1 tbs honey for the sugar (and added 1/4 tsp baking soda, to counter the slight acidity of the honey), as I try to avoid white sugar.  The resulting muffins were pleasantly sweet, moist, and fairly light yet filling.  Versatile enough for dinner, breakfast, or a healthy whole-grain snack, but just plain enough that I think I will either add some cinnamon next time and eat them for breakfast, or reduce the honey and add something savory, like a touch of fresh rosemary.

Original recipe was hard after they cooled...but it is a great starter recipe to make into anything you want. I made mini-muffins out of it instead because my kids are small. They devoured them! I added pumpkin pie spices, chunks of apple, ground flax seed and a few swirls of honey the second time around :) I found I needed to spray my muffin pan top as well because they rise more than I expected and I had trouble getting them out of the pan the first time. GREAT recipe!

The taste was delicious. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and added one teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, which gave it a delicious flavor. I also tried using apple sauce instead of oil, but I didn't know how much to use, so I used the same amount called for the oil - 1/3 cup. I'm not sure if that was a correct measurement though, because the batter, when stirred, was more like cookie dough than batter. I lumped it into the cup cake papers, and they came out just fine. But they stuck to the paper pretty good, so I would recommend just greasing the muffin tin instead of using paper liners. In the end, I ate more of these than I should have, so I'd say I really liked them! I'll be making them again, but next time I'll use the oil instead of apple sauce.

Great basic muffin recipe!  I have never made muffins before, and these have a good flavor and were easy to make.  Next time I will try throwing in a handful of cranberries or something similar.

Modified this recipe a bit based on what I had read. Changes: apple sauce in place of oil; added 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Cloves, All Spice, Nutmeg; added 1 cup Golden Raisins; used all WW flour instead of 1/2 white; dusted with sugar; made with three with Chocolate Chips for the chocolate lover in the house.   Whew! That's a lot of changes- I'll update with flavor profile!

Pretty Good! took others ideas and added 1/2c oatmeal and 1,1/2c wheat flour. Replaced oil for applesauce.   Added honey cinnamon and apple spices. Next time I will add some dried cherries and walnuts. Or like someone else did, make my applesauce and add it to make an apple muffin yum! The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

I took some other reviewers' suggestions and substituted applesauce for oil and added a bit of honey and some blueberries. They are good, easy, and low fat. Perfect for an everyday muffin, not your friend's shower.

This was a great base recipe. I add spices and slices of apple for a more flavorful muffin. You can also make it w/ egg whites for less fat

These muffins were very tasty and moist.  I added a mashed banana.  However like others mentioned 20-25 minutes is way too long.  I only baked them for 14 minutes and they were done.

These muffins are okay though dry.  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a half tsp. each of ginger and nutmeg.  I put in about a tsp. of vanilla, 1 TBS. of honey and a few handfuls of dried cranberries.  Substituting applesauce for the oil probably would have helped.

Sorry these didn't work for me. I used all whole wheat flour like some other people, added cinn & vanilla & used applesauce for the oil. Came out too dense for my tastes. Thanks anyway!
