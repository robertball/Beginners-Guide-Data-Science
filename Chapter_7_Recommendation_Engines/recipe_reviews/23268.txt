I've made different fudge recipes over the years, and this is a good one. One thing you have to pay attention to is the evaporated milk....ONLY 5 ounces, not the whole can. It sets up quick and you don't need the fridge. Make sure when you bring it to the boil stage bring it to 225 degrees, then the fudge always hardens.

I may have stumbled upon the problem some people are having with this recipe. It's the amount of evaporated milk.  When a recipe says "one can" I usually just go with what seems to me to be a standard sized can. But before I poured it in the saucepan this time, I checked the ounces. Whaddya know? To me, a can of evaporated milk is 12 ounces. But this recipe only calls for a 5 ounce can.  So be sure to check the size of your milk can!

I personally LOVE the fudge you make from the recipe on the back of the marshmallow cream jars. But the cream contains eggs and my son is allergic. (Marshmallows themselves usually do not -- weird, huh?)  Anyway, this reciped turned out better than any other non-marshmallow cream variety I've tried.  It's creamy, sets up well and tastes nice and yummy. (With all that butter and sugar it ought to!)

A quibble is that to my eye it never really lost its gloss. But I quit beating after several minutes anyway and it turned out fine.  No nuts for us due to allergy issues as well -- that can be a problem with some fudge recipes I've tried but not this one!

Try this an be diligent about the milk measurement and you'll be pleased. And of course, as with anything with milk and this much sugar, forget the directions to stir "frequently" during the heat-up stage and just plan on stirring constantly.

So yummy!  We ate way too much of this!  Use a bigger saucepan than you think you'll need, because it just about doubles in size as it cooks and you don't want any boil-over accidents.  I lined my pan with foil too so I can just lift the whole thing up, peel the foil off and cut it up on a cutting board.  When it says to beat until it "loses its gloss" I thought I hadn't done it long enough (it was still a little glossy), but it set up perfectly.  I love the crunch walnuts add to this. ******UPDATE: Made this again 12/20/5 with orange extract instead of vanilla, kept everything else the same.  It was SO GOOD!  Try it this way, or use your favorite flavor.  (Kept the amount of extract the same, using "real", not artificial, orange flavoring).

I have never had success with fudge until trying this recipe.  It turned out so creamy and, well just perfect.  I got rave reviews by everyone that has tried a piece.  I would suggest using a candy thermometer just to eliminate any doubt on when it is ready to take off the stove.  I did a slight varation on it - First of all I doubled the recipe and left out the walnuts.  I also used 1/3 milk chocolate chips and 2/3 semi-sweet (my personal preference).  After I poured it into two pans I topped one pan with crushed candy canes and the other with walnut halves.  Both versions went over really well but people seemed to really like the one with the candy cane on top.  Very festive looking too.  The only suggestion I have is to give a approximate time needed to beat the mixture.  I wasn't totally sure if the gloss was gone but I had been beating for about five minutes (in a KitchenAid mixer) and was afraid of over doing it.  It would have been nice to have a general guideline.  Thank you for this recipe.  I'm already planning on making it again tomorrow to give away as gifts.

I followed this recipe to a T and it did not work at all. The mixture never really thickened and didn't lose its gloss even after 30 minutes of beating it by mixer. Its been in  ther freezer for 2 days and its still wants to be "runny". I don't know what I did wrong but I'm dissappointed because I really wanted this fudge to work. O Well, if anyone knows the fix let me know.

This is my go to - never fail recipe for fudge.  I always use 2/3 cup of evaporated milk and 12 large marshmallows. Over low heat I bring the butter, sugar, and milk to a boil - stirring constantly - when the bubbles cannot be stirred away I start timing for 5 minutes - again stirring constantly.  After five minutes, I remove from the heat, add chocolate chips and vanilla, I blend with my portable handheld mixer.  Then add nuts and pour into a foil lined and greased 8 x 8 inch dish.  Allow to cool, lift foil out and cut into squares.  I make a lot of this and give as gifts.  Been making for years!

I just finished making this wonderful fudge! I doubled the recipe, using 1 whole can of evaporated milk (12 oz can) 2 cups ghiardelli bittersweet chips, 2 sticks butter, 2 tsp vanilla, 4 cups mini marshmallows,  4 cups evaporated cane sugar (organic). I used a candy thermometer and cooked the milk marshmallows and sugar on 4.5 heat (setting on electric stovetop) till soft ball stage, I didn't time it, but I know it took quite a bit of time. I stirred with a heat proof rubber spatula slowly the whole time. I then dumped this onto the butter, vanilla and chocolate chips in my kitchen aid mixer. I mixed for atleast 5 min on medium speed. I then dumped into a pan with buttered foil in it.  I would say a 10x10 or so would do the trick. It has the best texture of any fudge I have tried. I put walnuts on top of half of the fudge. It looks amazing, Thanks for the recipe.  This is the second time I have made fudge and I am sure this will be the main recipe for me! The first fudge I made was a disaster.....  have made this countless times, never failed yet. A quarter sheet cake pan works perfect. it takes about 24 min, starting the timer right when you turn on the stove with the ingredients in the pan.

Pretty good fudge. I wish I'd read the reviews or I would've used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate since I didn't think it had a rich enough taste for my liking. I had to put it in the freezer for it to set up, but at least it set up! I live in DC and for fudge to set up in DC in the summer is a miracle! For those of you who live in humid climates, be warned that it is NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE to make any kind of candy in humidity. Trust me, I know.

Made a batch of this for a friend, who couldn't stop eating it!  Took awhile to get to the right consistency, but it was worth it in the end!

This is "Old Fashioned Fudge"  so having said that it is not Fool Proof!  The directions say 5-oz can evap. milk so don't mistake that for a regular size can which is what I did...  I had to triple my ingredients to make it work!  BTW if your making lots changes to this recipe how do you know it really works!  Rating 5 stars should be if you followed directions 100% and it worked!  As for me, I'll stick with the "Fool Proof" fudge next time. Here's a link on "how to fix your fudge" just in-case you need it!   http://candy.about.com/od/fudgecandyrecipes/f/fix_fudge.htm

I had never made "real" fudge before.  This was excellent!  I followed the directions closely but also read through the handy hints from other users (big pan, candy thermometer, correct amount of milk, varying mix of chocolates, etc...).  The only other change I made was to the nuts.  Instead of walnuts, I used toffee bits stirred into one batch and crushed candy canes on top of the second batch.  Both were amazing!  Today I'm going to try it with dark chocolate and the candy canes again!

I've never made fudge before and this turned out perfect, so easy to make. Just remember to stir constantly the whole time though as it can burn easily. Instead of buttering the pan I just lined the pan with wax paper which works great and helps minimize mess.

Very simple, turned out great. I taught a girlfriend how to make fudge the old fashioned way.Then I showed her how to make this recipe and she couldn't believe how easy making fudge could be.  My husband couldn't even tell the difference between old fashioned fudge to this one. A real keeper!

This fudge never set for me - I did everything the other reviewers said - measured the evaporated milk, beat for about 30mins, but it never lost its gloss.  I give it two stars because is tastes reallly good even though it didnt work out for me.

I meant to buy sweetened condensed milk but I bought evaporated milk instead.  So, I made this recipe.  It turned out very delicious.  It was a fairly easy recipe with tastey results.

These were okay.  Texturally, they came out fine with no problems reported by other reviewers - 5 oz evaporated milk worked fine, and instead of taking the milk mixture off the heat at 6 minutes, I used a candy thermometer and waited until the temp had reached about 235 - if some people turn the heat down low and take it off just at 6 minutes, it may not be up to temperature, which may account for the fudge not coming together.

The milk mixture was difficult to cook using a stainless steel pot - it really wanted to burn on the bottom, so I had to stir really vigorously for the 7-8 minutes I was cooking it.  It still burnt slightly, although could not taste it in the end result.

Used semi sweet baking chocolate and bittersweet couverture chocolate rather than chocolate chips. With a Kitchen-Aid mixer, the fudge lost its gloss really quickly (within a minute or two), which confused me since someone here had said it took longer than expected... so I kept going and probably overbeat it.

 Flavor turned out pretty bland, albeit rich and dense.  It really needs a flavor punch somehow, and I'm not sure what would work - more vanilla? A bit of salt (since I used unsalted butter)?

Will try other recipes - I'm spoiled on a childhood of boiled fudge with heavy cream that is kneaded as it cools - now THAT's the good stuff.

I make this every year for my mom. You can substitute any flavor chip instead of chocolate. This last time I did half chocolate & half peanut butter chips and it made an amazing chocolate peanut butter fudge! Make sure it gets hot enough and it will set up beautifully!

I probably will give this 5 stars after I  fix my water down fudge, that didn't set up. Thank you mommycherly for sharing to watch the evoporated milk measurements bec thats actually what went wrong. I used a can which is 12 oz when receipe only calls for 5 oz, U bet i'm gonna double it up. It has a good flavor. I used  Huge milk choc candy bars too instead of the semisweet choc chip, but thats only bec thats what I have. Thanks 4 receipe!

I have never attempted candy making before, and after reading all the  reviews (stir constantly, omit vanilla if using milk chocolate morsels, melt marshmallows first, then bring to a rolling boil, etc etc) the fudge turned out fine, and set quickly-- I was quite proud of myself!  I used parchment paper instead of tin foil, and it came out beautifully. It tasted and looked just like just fudge, and although I am easy to please when it comes to chocolate, it seemed like it could have used some additional flavor or punch-- it was a little bland. We did enjoy it, however, and if I  make this recipe again, I will use the semisweet morsels and maybe add the orange or raspberry extract as some of you suggested. I am giving this recipe 4 stars for ease and success of directions, but omitting one for taste-- hope this helps.

This worked tremendously for me. I used 2 cups mini marshmallows (what I had on hand) and fat free evaporated milk. While it did take a little longer to set up, the end result was deliciously creamy. Not at all dry or crumbly. I think this may be the only fudge recipe I use for Christmas this year!

My fudge didn't set up, it stayed creamy despite chilling all day.  It still turned out ok though, I turned the failed fudge into yummy cookies.

This fudge never set up, a fate that apparently befell another reviewer. After an hour of beating, all I had was a bowl of room-temperature, chocolate sludge. I guess I'll have to turn it into brownies tomorrow. The recipe was followed to the letter, something I feel you have to do with any confection involving boiling sugar. I suspect the problem is that I never got the sugar-milk-marshmallow mixture up to a temperature high enough to insure that it would set up later after beating. It would help if Leema would provide a temperature to which the boiling mass should be brought. Providing such a bench mark might be so much clearer than instructions to stir and boil, then reduce heat to low and stir some more for 6 minutes. Just what temperature is "low" anyway. I suspect Leema's low is probably higher than the low on my range.

This was delicious!  FYI 10 large marshmallows equals approx. 130 mini marshmallows.  I didn't change the recipe a bit and it was super easy and very tasty!  I also lined my 8x8 dish with foil, super easy to clean up!

If using a different size can of milk, 5oz is about 1/2c plus 2T.  This recipe is easy, and makes creamy, sweet fudge. I wouldn't change anything.

I made this recipe for my in-laws and everyone seemed to really love it.  Even the people that were very particular about thier fudge liked it.  The first time I made a few mistakes.  I used condensed milk instead of evaporated.  The fudge was horrible.  It never looked how the directions described it and it tasted like chocolate sugary sand.  When I realized the huge error I made the 2nd batch was much better.  Another mental note, if you have stainless steel mixing bowls, then you might want to consider using a different bowl.  The steel bowls get very hot while mixing the butter and are difficult to hold if you don't have some sort of oven mit handy.  We just got a kitchenaid mixer so that might solve my hand burning problem if I misplace my mitts again.  I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and I've used Hershey's Dark chocolate chips as well.  Everyone seems to like that version just as much.

Very very good! First attempt at making fudge, so I wasn't sure what to expect. This was so very easy to make. After chilling in the fridge for several hours, it was still soft when I cut it. Very creamy too. I put it on my cookie tray, made one batch with walnuts inside and on top, the other with crushed candy canes on top. Went over great!

This is a great recipe, and I've only made fudge maybe twice.  I took someone's advice and let the cut up marshmallows melt before I started the timer for boiling.

I wanted to mail the fudge, so I added twice the amount of choc chips, as the first batch was creamy and delicious but I was afraid if it sat in the sun during transport to Mississippi, it might be too soft.  The extra chips made it quite firm but it was still nice and creamy.
If you make it with extra chips, it won't take as much beating.  I noticed it was getting ready to pour in the pan at about 3-3 1/2 mins.  Thanks for this recipe.

THIS IS THE BEST FUDGE IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD!!!!!! For my younger sisters bday, she wanted me to make my "famous fudge." Truth be told, i had NO idea what she was talking about!! It had been years sense i made fudge, and i had kept changing recipes. I quickly jumped on AllRecipes, like i always do, and found this fudge recipe. This is now my "famous fudge recipe." It is so good and easy. I didn't have large marshmallows, so used 2 cups of mini's. I actually only used about 1 1/4-1 1/2 cups sugar (mostly because i ran out), and it turned out WONDERFULL!!!! Make sure to only use a 5 ounce can of milk otherwise it WILL NOT work (obviously.) I beat it for, um, maybe 4-5 minutes and  it was beautiful. I lined a pan with foil, to make it easier, and only refrigerated it for about 1-1/2 hours and then am having it just sit on the counter, because we like soft fudge. I have a dairy allergy, so didn't try any (ok, ok, maybe i tried just a teeny-weeny bit), but everyone else says its good, and it turly is. Seriously, make this fudge recipe and you won't try another!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome, easy and delicious. I'm no expert but I got a great texture. Didn't trust the 6 minutes cook time. I used a candy thermometer like my mom taught me but it actually turned out to be about 6 minutes anyways. Thanks for a great treat.

I followed the rei pe exactly, after reading the other reviews (very helpful thanks).  Using the foil to coat the sauce pan makes clean up much easier.  It did need to be refridgerated over night to set properly, but it started to set immediately. I also suggest lining the 8x8 pan with waxed paper for easier clean up, too.

Excellent! As long as you follow the directions exactly it will turn out great! Note: Only use the 5oz. of the milk, and not a whole 12 oz. can and stir CONSTANTLY. I have never made fudge before and it was not hard to make, nor was it runny or gritty from the sugar. I didn't even use a candy thermometer. This only toook me about 15 minutes from pantry to fridge to prep, and let it sit for 3 hours or so in the fridge. I also used a 9x9 pan because that's all I had and it still was thick enough to enjoy! I will make this again for sure and only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars to me is fudge that I woud die for! :) Otherwise, It was chocolatey and smooth!! MMMM!

Came out too soft.  I looked at some of the other reviews before making this and knew to check the amount of evap. milk but it still was too soft. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I followed it exactly and was disappointed as it did not firm up.  I will keep looking at the reviews to see if others had the same problem.  Thanks for sharing

I hadn't made fudge since I was a kid at my Grandma's house. She grew up in a bakery ran by her parents. She always made fudge for Christmas. Long story short this turned out so creamy and delicious, I used Ghiradelli chocolate and oh my! The kids, the husband and the family gobbled it up in no time. It was really easy to make too!

LOVED this - as did all my family - and it is so easy to make ... if i can make it perfect every time, anyone can. the only thing i changed is to leave it on the stove until it gets to around 220 on the candy thermometer. i found it took about 10 minutes.  also, i tripled the recipe, and it worked great.

This recipe is great.  I live at 6800 feet so making candy is a challenge because water boils at 196 deg F.  This turned out wonderful.  I used 12 oz milk chocolate chips instead of 1 c semisweet chocolate chips because I prefer the milder flavor.  I also prefer pecans to walnuts.  The grandkids can hardly leave it alone.  I want to try again with butterscotch chips for a different flavor.

Came out very smooth! Very easy recipe to follow. I love fudge and this was the first time I made it at home, I expected it to come out grainy and falling apart, but it came out awesome. Folllow the directions to a T and you will do fine.

This is wonderful!  I made it last night for Christmas gifts. It is delicious and it is firm but not dry.  Cuts cleanly and into perfect squares.  Very cute gift idea in metal tins.  Little mess, and VERY simple!  I will be making this for years to come.

I doubled the ingredients,  I used miniature marshmallows because it's all I had as I am on a Towboat, on the Mississippi River,  celebrating Christmas away from home with my fellow towboaters. It was an easy recipe so I thought I'd give it a try.

Very good! Like other reviews use a candy thermometer to make sure the butter, milk  and marshmallows are at 225  degrees. This helps the fudge set up at room temperature .  ( no need for the fridge)  I doubled the recipe and didn't have large marshmallows, so I used 3 cups mini marshmallows (packed) and it came out beautiful ! Silky, creamy fudge, thanks for sharing!

This recipe has a great texture. I boiled it till soft-ball stage - 234 degrees, and it firmed perfectly. I chose this recipe because I could easily change it to meet my daughter's food intolerance. I used 2 tablespooons ghee, a pinch of salt, and 6 tablespoons palm shortening in place of the butter, and heavy whipping cream in place of the evaporated milk.

That said, the flavor was lacking a bit - next time I will add more chocolate somehow - either with cocoa powder at some point, or more chocolate chips.

It would be an understatement to say my daughter was thrilled with the fudge. I think she would give it 5 stars, but she's been fudge-deprived for 3 years now, so I think ANY fudge would get 5 stars from her.

This is great! I followed the recipe exactly (minus the nuts) and I added a tsp of cinnamon and it's SO yummy and the perfect texture.

I will use this recipe as a base for other flavors since it's so easy (no taking the temperature and evaporated milk is much cheaper than sweetened condensed milk!).

THIS HAD TO BE THE EASIEST FUDGE EVER.  I'VE MADE 7 BATCHES, SUBSTITUTING PISTACHIOS OR ALMONDS AND THEY ALL TURNED OUT FABULOUS.

Great recipe! I have never made fudge before and decided to try it. I used 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. I also added crushed walnuts on top before the fudge set. I followed the directions to a T and it came out WONDERFUL! It never really lost the "gloss", so I just stirred until it was all mixed up! It was a hit at work. Thank you!

This had a nice texture and was easy to make - even in a very humid Japanese summer there was no difficulty getting it to set.  The first time I made it I used a large bar of milk chocolate and another of dark chocolate, but I found it too bland and sweet.  For my second try I used all dark chocolate, of a higher quality than chocolate chips.  I also reduced the butter slightly.  I liked the second batch better.  I still think the flavor needs a bit more 'oomph', maybe orange extract as suggested by another reviewer, or another flavour, would pep it up.  A good basic recipe though.

I followed this recipe exactly; used the 5 oz of evaporated milk and exact directions. However, it turned out the consistency of molasses, even after chilling in the fridge for 24 hours and beating it in my KitchenAid mixer for 20 minutes while it was hot. Great fudge taste, but it sadly never turned into fudge.

I made this fudge for a church potluck. It only took me about 15-20 minutes to make it was so easy! Cleanup was really easy to! We thought it was so fast to make we made a batch for ourselves too! Unfortunately the potluck got canceled...so we ended up eating it all to ourselves lol. YUM!

My daughter and I just made this fudge.  It is good!!  The only thing I did differently...was lined my pan with aluminum foil to make them come out a little easier.  My daughter asked if I would put them on the table,  so she could eat them all day?  NOT!  I recommend this recipe!  Easy and good!

The semi sweet chocolate is the way to go for me, the sugar and marshmallows are quite sweet so the semi sweet chocolate adds rich chocolate flavor without adding more sweetness.

I made this fudge. Really out of curiosity to see if it would come out. I did follow another reviewer suggestion and used my candy thermometer and cooked it, stirring consistently until it reached 225 degrees. BIG HIT. My husband doesn’t even liked fudge and couldn’t stop raving. Thank you for an easy recipe.

Like many others, I didn't pay attention to 5 oz of evaporated milk and used the whole can. It might be better to just list it as 5 oz evaporated milk since they don't have 5 oz cans. I realized this after when the mixture didn't thicken. So, I put it all back in a large pan and doubled the recipe. I boiled it to 230 degrees then took it off the heat. I beat it awhile, glossiness never went away.
I poured it into 2 pans and added nuts to one. To me, it was a little grainy and not smooth. It did set and tastes okay. I'll try it again with the right amount  of milk.

Awesome ;) 
We're making several fudge recipes due to making kids a promise we'd sell fudge at an event and this one is top 2! 
1. We used 2 cups of mini marshmallows
2. We heated until softball. 235-236; it's sets faster. 
3. We doubled the recipe and it's doubly delicious. 
4. Ours lost its shine fast and we got it into the pan just in time. 
5. Also if you like more milk-chocolate taste try using 1/2 the chocolate -Yum!

I used to make this every year and sell it for $1 per piece for relay4life. I could get 18 pieces per batch. It's bee  4 years since I last sold it for relay, but I still have old high school friends asking if I'll give them the recipe.

The recipe is simple and easy to follow for lazy cooks like me. 
Had the sudden urge at 10 pm to make some fudge. 
Zeroed in on this one because I had all the ingredients.
Used 100 ml water + 1 cup milk powder instead of 5 ounces of evaporated milk.
Used one Bournville bar  and 2 heaped tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder.

Waiting to make it all over again with flavor variations now.

My mother in law is very picky when it comes to any dessert so I was shocked when she loved this fudge! I followed instructions and it came out awesome, but next time I will probably add more sugar for a sweeter taste. 
Thank you!!

Made no changes save used 2oz Half and Half and 3oz Whole Milk because I had no evaporated milk.  Also left the butter out at room temperature for 2-3 hours before final assembly to soften it.  No complaints here.  Used a Kitchenaid Mixer on low (not lowest but low) setting for the final mixing.  I would run it and for 30-60 seconds and stop for 30 seconds or so.  Scrape down the sides ect.  Finally the surface  would start to crack when I would begin to mix it again and basically thats when I added the nuts and I was done.  Transferred to refrigerator and let cool for several hours.  Was great, would make again.

I have probably made fudge about 2 x, but this was my best effort.  Thanks for this recipe. I liked it's simplicity and ease.  How ever, I added extra half cup of chocolate chips  because my husband likes his fudge with robust chocolate flavor.  I think this worked very well, hence my 4 stars rating. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of salt.   It was very thick and was set in under 2 hours with a rich chocolate flavor.  For other reviewers whose fudge did not set , may be trying to increase the chocolate and paying attention to the quantity of the milk will help. The 5 ounces of milk is 10 table spoonfuls.   My husband and I were really impressed with the outcome considering  my earlier attempts at fudge making weren't successful.

I read all the reviews before making this.  The only problem (if it's even considered a problem) was the gloss really never left when mixing and I mixed for about 6-8 min.  However, it turned out just fine...many compliments for all who tried it.  Thank you for sharing.....

This fudge was very easy to make but I really didn't  care for them. Just too sweet.  Should've figured with the ratio of sugar to chocolate. Still searching for that perfect fudge recipe

The texture was okay, but I all I could taste was chocolate chips. Not that chocolate chips are bad, but I would like a more complex flavor. Maybe next time I'll add some peanut butter.

I like a sweeter, richer fudge so I normally use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  I found that if you use them in this recepie, then omit the vanilla as it changes the taste completely and leaves a bad aftertaste.

This fudge turned out perfect. It was well worth the bit of time it took to boil the mixture . One thing I found was; even with constant stirring on the  heat, I still scorched it somewhat. You really need to be careful with that. The beating was a little exhausting ,but the fudge was so delicious,  creamy consistency, and set up so beautifully. Thanks so much Amber, for submitting this great fudge recipe!

This was a good tasting batch of fudge. I'll have to warn people going to make this, to use a big pot; it boils and doubles in size. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but mine keeps turning out soft. Maybe I'm not beating it long enough?

I didn't make this,,my husband did.  Having said that..it never firmed up for him,,but boy it was great on top of ice cream!  I don't know what he did wrong, but I hope it happens again, because it was a big hit for sundaes!
