We LOVED this! I used 1 carton of broth and then filled the carton with water and used that too. I also added some onion, carrots and celery while it was boiling and when the soup was all done I threw in some torn fresh spinach that needed used up. This was such a simple soup with great flavor and I will definately be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very, very good recipe. First attempt I cooked up 32 servings in about 2.5 hours. Not too bad! And it is a relatively inexpensive soup to make. Just a note, you can skimp on the parmesean by almost half and turn out with a great end product.

This was so easy and good. I did not use hamburger that was lean enough because it was very greasy. I ended up skimming a lot of grease off the top. Next time I will use very lean hamburger. Kids loved the idea of meatball soup!

This was a good basic recipe. There wasn't a lot of different things going on in it and sometimes simple is good. I used a frozen egg noodle instead for a more heartier soup.

This tastes great! The only thing I would do is maybe even double the broth. Mine was not soupy at all.

This was delicious!  The meatballs were scrumptious and tender!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  So did my picky father, and the 2 and 4 year olds.  I didn't have enough chicken broth, so I used half chicken, half beef broth.  It was really good, believe it or not.  Thank you!

This was simple, but too salty. I recommend using low-sodium chicken broth or cutting the chicken broth with water. I also would have liked more broth. Otherwise, it makes a good easy lunch.

My husband loved this soup. I use ground chuck and it turned out too greasy for me but everyone else loved this. Next time I will use a leaner ground beef to fix this. Instead of salt I used Season-All in the meatballs. The flavor was delicious and not bland like I had expected. I ended up using 32 oz of chicken broth since that is what size container I had on hand. There wasn't as much liquid as I thought there should have been though as compared to the noodles and meat, so I might increase that as well the next time I fix this. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe, it's a winner in our book.
