Made the Broccoli Polanaise today.  Thought it was a quick, easy side dish to make.  Used Italian bread crumbs and real butter - made it very rich.  Would make again.

I enjoyed this.  It does need some seasoning so i added a spicy salt blend. I also dry toated some panko crumbs instead of using the butter and added some light butter to the dish afterwards.

Loved it - added more parmesan cheese and lime juice (approx. 1 TB).  Totally impressed and will definitely make again! :D

This recipe was just ok for us.  It it is a little on the dry side.  We did like the broccoli/egg combination, so when I try it again, once the broccoli is steamed I'm going to add some butter to it and then add the topping.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make it "as is" with only one addition. I added a teaspoon or so of Johnny's Garlic Spread and seasoning. These are not items I would have prepared together, but it turned out really good!

Wow - Tasty!  I made a couple of modifications:  1) Saut√©e fresh broccoli florets in 1 tsp bacon fat and 2 Tbsp unsalted butter in a covered saucepan over med heat until desired level of tenderness (I prefer mine a little crunchy).  Instead of bread crumbs, substitute a half sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers. No need to add salt; the crackers provide plenty. Bon appetite!

I wanted to make something different with some fresh broccoli. This certainly fit the bill but it was surprisingly good. I increased the seasoning in the bread crumbs. My husband wasn't a fan (he thinks gooey cheese sauce is required for a broccoli dish) so I had leftovers. It reheated fine in the microwave and I used it as a main dish for lunch. I'll make it again (but take out his part before adding the bread crumbs and egg.) :)
