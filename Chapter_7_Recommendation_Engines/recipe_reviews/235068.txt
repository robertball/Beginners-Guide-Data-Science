Instead of rolling it flat and using a cookie cutter, I rolled the dough into little balls, covered the balls in sugar, and pressed them a little flat on the baking sheet. I loved the balance of sweet and spice and my 2 year old loved them too.

With a little care this can be just as versitile as the regular dough, only this stays moist much longer. I've used this for multiple gingerbread houses with few issues, just avoid giant slabs of wall.

I'm not a connoisseur of gingerbread cookies, but these were pretty decent for how little went into them. The dough wasn't dry at all like I had feared, though I had some trouble rolling the dough out smooth enough. The spice is fairly mellow, so even those who aren't crazy for normal gingerbread cookies still seem to enjoy them. I would probably use this one again for the holidays :)

I absolutely love this recipe. I don't use it for the tree decoration though. I use it as a gingerbread cookie recipe. I make them every year for my family for Christmas. It's a big hit. :)

I followed the recipe and the dough was easy to roll with my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter!

I don't make gingerbread cookies as a rule but this year my 3 Grandsons requested Gingerbread men for Christmas. I picked this recipe and then another recipe from this site that actually used molasses for their recipe. Both recipes were a hit with them but this one was my fav. A soft cookie with a mild taste. Grandsons want this one cut in different shapes so they can have it throughout the year without looking Christmasey. LOL.

I'm giving this five stars because I feel guilty for not following the recipe to the 'T'. Instead I used it as a base recipe. Instead of butterscotch jello I used French vanilla and omitted the cinnamon. Made very tasty cake like cookies so I added some vanilla frosting. My son and my boyfriend loved them and sadly I only had one and they were gone. Next time I'll stash some away for myself.
