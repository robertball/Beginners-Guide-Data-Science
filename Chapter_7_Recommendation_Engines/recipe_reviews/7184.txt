These are SO yummy! Remind me a lot of KFC biscuits, but better! 
To make these I scaled it down to 6. Then I used 1 cup of milk, mixed it into the mixture until soft dough formed. Then I put it down on a floured surface, knead 10 times. Then rolled out to 1/2 inch thick, and cut with a biscuit cutter. I baked in 450 degree oven for 8-10 minutes. Then I made the Honey butter recipe from this site to put on them. YUMMMMM. My family gobbled them up! Thanks for the awesome recipe!Will make this over and over!

This is a terrific biscuit mix!  I have used it three times over the weekend for biscuits and pancakes and find it to be a light fluffy biscuit, far superior to its commercial mix inspiration (which is w-a-y too salty!).  I took a reviewer's suggestion and put it in the 3 lb shortening container which works well.  The 10c amount is too big for the container but the excess was quickly used up!  To clear up some confusion, I did not know what to do with the mix to make the biscuits so I found the bisquick site and here is what works well:
BISCUITS
2 1/4 c mix
2/3 c milk
Bake at 450 degrees and 12 mins (in my oven).
PANCAKES
2 c mix
1 c milk
2 egs

For more recipes, go to the www.bisquick.com website.  The biscuits fluffed up about double in size and were absolutely delicious.  Enjoy, and thanks Janet!

This is the ONLY recipe we have ever rated a 5 because we have found that all recipes can be changed and improved.  We have been buying Bisquick and spending approximately $5 on a large box.  We even did the math and came up with us having spent approximately $3.05 to make this recipe which is about equivalent to a large box of Bisquick.  Overall, the homemade baking mix actually did a BETTER job on pancakes (which is a big weekend breakfast treat for our kids) and did good on biscuits.  Also did EXCELLENT on the Cheddar Bay Biscuits in Allrecipes.  Only thing to keep in mind regarding biscuits is to not try to do half of the recipe for less biscuits.  You need the whole recipe so your biscuits will be of a good size and thickness. Something else to keep in mind on this recipe: if you are fortunate enough to have a KitchenAid mixer we really recommend using it to prepare this mix.  Use the wire wisk attachment and it is so easy to do. Only thing is unless you have a really large mixer bowl, would suggest preparing mix in half quantities so as not to get flour everywhere.  ENJOY!  Janet, we truly appreciate you sharing this recipe with us.  What a find!

Excellent!  Baked up really high and were very tender.  We replaced the shortening with butter and made enough for one batch of 6 biscuits.  We baked them for 10 mins. at 450.  After making these many times we have found that they freeze beautifully!  We just put the leftover biscuits in a freezer bag and pull out however many we need a bit before dinner; I wrap them in foil and heat them in the oven.  They are as good as freshly made!

This recipe is AWESOME.  Personally, I used 2 cups of this mix per 3/4 cup of buttermilk.  That makes great biscuits and a great topping for chicken pot pie!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe with us!!!!  Natalie

These were great and fast!  I halved the recipie and added 2 cups of milk to turn the biscuits into dough.  I then kneeded 10 times, rolled the dough out to 1/2-inch thick, cut the biscuits into circles, brushed the tops with butter, and baked at 375 degrees for 10 minutes.  Awesome!

I have been making Biscuit Mix for years and this is a good one. After cooking for 5 boys for what seemed like forever, It's just Hubby and I now. 
Another hint that might be useful. When you use up all your shortning, make half of this recipe and it fits wonderfully in the 3 lb shortning can. Then I just pop it into the refrigerator and it will keep practically forever.

I scaled the recipe to 6 and added just a splash over 2/3 C of milk, rolled the dough out and cut with a biscuit cutter. Baked at 450 for about 6 mins and they were perfect. I still prefer a biscuit recipe using whipping cream, but this is a wonderful alternative if you don't have any on hand. Will never use a mix again!

Makes great biscuits, both cut and drop, shortcakes, pie crusts, anything you would use baking mix for...when I make this I at least double it. It goes fast. :)

I LOVE this.  I use it in place of the yellow box from the store - can use with all the "biscuit mix" recipes!  Save money and know what is in it!

Because I've had the printed out recipe for awhile, I was unable to read everyone's reviews. I'm a beginner cook, and unless it is specifically spelled out for me, it took me some time to figure out a liquid (milk) had to be added. (I don't have Bisquick box to check measurements, nor was my computer accesible) So I just guessed on the milk amount and the oven temperature. The taste was bland and crumbly. I am rating the recipe and since there are instructions missing, I am giving it 2 stars. I shouldn't have to read everyone's reviews to see that there are ingredients and steps missing.

I make this 1/2 batch at a time - once a week. We love this better than krusteaz pancake mix. Have only used it for pancakes and waffles so far, but it is by far the best!  Pancakes 2 cups mix, 1 1/3 cups milk, 1 egg, dash of vanilla.  Waffles, 2 cups mix, 1 1/4 cups milk, 2 eggs, 2 T oil & dash of vanilla.  Perfect every time! Thanks. This is a staple ingredient in our house.

Very easy to make!  I didn't have shortening, so I used stick margarine, and the biscuits still came out great.  The only info missing from this recipe is that to make the biscuits, you should add water until it's tacky, but not thin, and then bake for about 10 minutes at 450 degrees.  Next time, I'm adding some garlic powder, parsley, and cheddar cheese, to make garlic cheddar biscuits! Yum!

This is a great recipe.  I have a child with a milk allergy and this is the first recipe I found that didn't call for non-fat dry milk.  It works just as well as the store bought mix.  I have a foodsaver vacuum sealer and put the mix in the canisters for better shelf life. I figured I saved about seventy cents per 40 oz. of homemade compared to the namebrand. Every little bit helps.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This recipe is perfect for me.  I am a widow (live alone) and old (don't eat much anymore)!  I made just half the mixture, adding a bit of baking soda.  I store it in the freezer, bringing it to room temp before preparing the biscuits.  I use 1 cup of the mixture with about 1/3 cup of buttermilk (milk with lemon juice), pat it out and cut into two biscuits.  Perfect for this old gal!

It's so easy, and the biscuits are fantastic!  I used this recipe with the "Cheese Biscuits" recipe, the they were delicious!  It's so convenient because I just take out enough of the mixture to whip up couple of biscuits to go with dinner, and pop it in the toaster oven, and in a few short minutes, a yummy complement to my meal.  Thank you!

We didn't get as many biscuits as the recipe said because we kept sneaking bits of dough-yum!  We used it for a topping on pot pie (with basil added) and as regular biscuits.  It is really yummy with butter instead of shortening and buttermilk for the liquid.

For the person who said the recipe is missing something, milk or water:  this isn't a biscuit recipe, it's for biscuit MIX, like bisquik.  You can't just dump it in a pan and get biscuits!  Use it like you would a mix, and you'll do fine.

This is an absolute blessing to have.  I have used this several times.  With the hectic schedule our family has with six children it is wonderful to just pull it out and use it at a moments notice.  Love this recipe.  Thanks.

This is a biscuit *MIX*recipe and not an actual biscuit recipe.  As long as you understand that, it makes a good replacement for Bisquick and other similar mixes.  Butter instead of shortening makes it taste slightly better, but if you make that substitute, you should refrigerate the mix or use within a few days.

As a finished product this is absolutely great, I wanted a good bulk recipe that I could make ad hoc.  However, this recipe is in need of some serious editing for people who dont know what "Use as you would a baking mix" I would suggest to the creator that they add ratios for fluid, baking temp reccomendations, you know the stuff of normal recipes.  Taste = great!  Writing style = poor 3 stars.

BEAUCHAT- this is a recipe for baking "mix" to be used as you would normally use in place of dry bisquick. This wasn't intended to be a full recipe to make biscuits with.

Fantastic recipe, and great results! The biscuits are light, flaky, tender, and without that horrid 'baking powder' after taste that happens in too many recipes. In short, absolutely delicious. I am in a simillar situation as one of the previous reviewers - I live in another country, and bisquick, KFC bixcuits just don't exist here. Also, I am in a wheelchair, so "quick and easy" are big considerations - especially when it comes to sudden snack ideas. I made up a medium size batch of the mix, and then cooked up just enough dough to make 2 biscuits to snack on. It was so quick and easy to do, and I will be able to make a couple any time that I want! (even 2 am, like tonight!)
The only thing that would make this recipe better would be if you shared some of the recipes you make with the Biscuit Mixture.

Excellent recipe.  This may be old news to y'all, but I did it in my food processor.  Sifted dry ingredients together.  Chilled the shortening in the fridge till it was hard, then processed half of it in half the flour, did the other half, stirred together.  So easy.

Made as written, but scaled down to 6 & didn't over do the cutting in of the shortning. Added 1 cup milk & kneaded just a few times on a lightly floured board...the dough was so soft! Patted down, cut 12 biscuits & baked 450 degrees until golden. They raised quite a bit & turned out so fluffy! Next time I will add a pinch more salt (not quite enough flavor on their own) & will use buttermilk whenever I have it. I can't wait to try using butter in place of shortning since so many others rave about it! I guess y'all can tell I plan on making this over & over...hmmm...I gotta try it for pancakes, too!!!

Just made these scaled down to 12. With a little over 2cups of milk, knead 10x, rolled out to 1/4"-1/2" and used my drinking glasses to cut out biscuits. I got about 15-18 perfectly golden dense biscuits, I didn't count exactly, on 375* for about 15 mins. YUMMY! We had these with a traditional southern dinner of fried chicken last night and then again this morning with spicy Jimmy Dean sausage, with eggs and cheese between these biscuits. I've had them with grape & strawberry jams and honey w/ butter.  Possibilities are endless. This will be a staple in my house!!! THank you so much :)

When you eat it hot out of the oven with butter… it is hard to stop! I made about 6 servings and used a cup of milk like previously described in another review. I baked it for about 10 to 12 min. at 425 degrees but brushed the biscuits with butter before putting it in the oven! It was my first time making biscuits and I was nervous on how it would turn out because I didn’t have a biscuit cutter but the biscuits turned out well! I will certainly use this recipe again!

This recipe is a great one. I just tried and my kids loved them. They are really great when mixed with butter milk. The recipe was easy to follow and they turned out fluffy and soft. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of butter milk, needed it 10 times like someone else suggested. I rolled them out, topped with melted butter, and baked in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes. They are awsome.

Very tasty. Fast and delish. Downside you MUST eat them right away, fresh out the oven, they don't save well for the following day.

True the name- EASY! Here's a couple of adjustments: we are a family of 4, who needs 10 cups worth of biscuits?! My awesome math made enough for my family- 2 cups flour, 1/8 tbs sugar, 1/8 C baking powder, a pinch of salt and 1/2 C butter (we live in San Diego... I don't even think SHORTENING is legal here :)

Made about 6 big biscuits - YUM

I first made this to use in Zucchini Pie on this site - worked perfectly once I figured out to cut down the oil in the pie recipe! I've also used it to make pancakes following a reviewer's suggestion (2 c mix, 1 c milk, 2 eggs) and they were wonderful - I usually don't like pancakes but these were light and not greasy. My go-to pancake recipe now :)

I FINALLY have found a GREAT biscuit recipe!  I cut the recipe down to 6 servings, added 1 cup of milk and rolled onto floured surface.  Baked at 450 for 12 mins, then brushed with melted butter.  YUMMY!

great base, I added some milk then rolled them out and cut them into circles, then layered the circles into a stack of 4 with butter between each, then baked in the toaster oven for 10 min on 350.
Hubby loved it! 
thank you :)

I am confused here.... what can you use this for, do you store everything mixed together, even the shortening and is there anything else to add to this to make biscuits???  Do you just store this in a container and stick your hand in and grab a glob, form it and whip it on a pan?  NEED MORE INFO PLEASE.
AFTER researching to find recipes... SIMPLE recipes, found it was too salty for my quiche.  I did scale back to 1 1/4 tsp salt.  Again, would have been helpful for a simple recipe or two like pancakes, or biscuits instead of having to search for them.

This is a really good recipe, eit is very simple and you're sure to have all the ingredients already in the Pantry! I used Butter instead of the shortening. these came out fluffy! The thicker you roll it, the fluffier they'll be!

This really is a great biscuit mix if you find the right way to use it (hence the 4 stars). I followed the advice of another reviewer to use 2-1/4 cups of the mix with 3/4 cups of milk. I used half and half milk because I had it on hand. I coated the biscuits with a little melted butter before popping them into the over at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, until they were golden brown.

I have biscuits and gravy for the grandkids quite often.  I use half of the recipe and use buttermilk. I have made this recipe using  2 cups of buttermilk twice. Both times were really good, but the second time I added 1 teaspoon of baking soda to the mix.  I also don't roll the mixture out I just pat it out and use a pizza cutter to cut biscuits and then I don't have to reroll. I thought the biscuits with the baking soda were the best.  Bake on bottom shelf of  450 degree oven for 10 to 14 minutes or until tops are brown.  My grandkis are already asking when I am going to make again and it has only been a few days.  They heat up real good in the microwave the next day for buttered biscuits.  This makes about 24 biscuits. I plan on trying this mixture for everything I use Bisquick for.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This mix is excellent!!  I used 7cups APF (made into SRF), and 3 cups Whole wheat flour.  I also used frozen shredded butter instead of shortening. I halved the recipes for two batches of biscuits. Using 5 cups of flour mix with 2 cups of milk. And they still came out fantastic!! Fluffy, soft, flaky ... yummy!! Second batch was Cheddar biscuits, made the same as above with added 3/4 cup of cheddar shredded cheese! This recipe is fantastic and easy to adjust to your liking ... wonderful ... thank you so much for sharing!!   PS ... can't wait to make pancakes with this mix ;o)

For PANCAKES:  add 2 eggs and 1 1/4 cup milk to 2 cups mix.  Works great, and for waffles, too.  I use whole wheat flour for about 1/3 of the flour called for.  Halving the recipe will make enough mix for 4 pancake breakfasts!  I've been making this mix for pancakes for two years.  We keep it on hand in the fridge since I use butter instead of shortening.  A good starter mix for the kids to make breakfast themselves.  Even packaged some up for Christmas gifts with the recipe tied on. Thanks for sharing it!

I'm thinking I didn't make the mix right...  I thought the biscuits were yummy but they didn't brown up on the top like I thought they should and they were very crumbly.  So I think it was bakers error, not the recipe error.  I am going to try to make them again for dinner tonight....I added 1/4 cup more milk than the 2 1/4 cups suggested by another viewer and the biscuits held together better and browned up perfect. :o) Thanks for the mix recipe!

I've made this several times, using the recipe to yield 3 instead of 24. (It actually makes 6 biscuits). I also used another users directions and added 1/2 cup of milk and I use butter instead of shortening. They taste great! I combine all of the dry ingredients, cut the butter into small bits and blend it with my hands. Then, I add the milk a little at a time, mixing it with my hands until I form a nice sturdy lump and I knead it maybe 10 times. Some people may roll it out, but I just flatten it to 1/2 inch thick with my hands and cut it using a glass since I don't have a biscuit cutter!

I have never made any kind of bread before, and I was terrified, but this was SO EASY!  I just added some milk until it looked like dough, and I didn't even have a biscuit cutter, so I just chopped some triangles with a dough cutter, and stuck them in my Japanese oven, where I have no idea what temperature it actually is and it STILL WORKED BEAUTIFULLY!  I made enough for 6 servings, and I added about 1/2 cup of milk.  I had every opportunity to screw this up, and it was still better than most biscuits I've ever had.  Try it!  For me, I would call it foolproof!

Awesome, the best biscuit mix found after a long search. The only thing I changed was the shortening to butter to give it a smooth buttery taste

Oh, goodness! I had my reservations when folks were comparing these to KFC, but WOW!! These are SO delicious! They remind me of McD's biscuits too :) My kids love them! I only made a recipe for 6 servings, but got about 12 or so biscuits. I used margerine because that is what I had on hand and they were wonderful-flaky, moist, and lightly crunchy outside :)

I also live outside the States where real biscuits just don't exist.  I used the recipe to make a small batch of biscuits and also to make a batch of Chicken and Dumplings.  The biscuits turned out great, slightly crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  The dumplings just didn't work...they completely dissolved in the soup and we ended up with stew.  For the biscuits, I used about 3/4 c. of milk to 2 1/2 c. of mix.

Used this to make the Cheddar Bay Biscuits on this site. Yummy! Nice to know how to make a baking mix when Bisquick is not to be found in the cupboard! Thanks Janet!

It all fit in my stand mixer and did well with the splash guard on. Not very sure I like the taste of these? Perhaps the shortening or too much baking soda? We'll see.

I made a 1/2 batch of this mix, using 4 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  I used butter instead of shortening as well.   I ended up mixing the entire batch with 2 cups (plus a little) of milk and it ended up a tad too wet- will def use just 2 cups milk next time.  I mixed it in my stand mixer and this was so easy.  I used the mix for cheese dumplings in my tomato soup- got about 7 of them into my pot.  I made up 13 more dumplings and froze them (uncooked) in a greased muffin pan.  Now tomato soup with dumplings will be a quick meal and less work!  Thanks for a great recipe- its a keeper for sure!!

Great recipe but it would be nice to see how you use this mix to make biscuits, crusts, pancakes, etc.  I winged it and my biscuits turned out good but I have ever used bisquick so I didn't know to turn the mixture into a finished product without some research.

THE BEST biscuit recipe I have ever tried.  I took some advice from a few others and halfed the recipe and added 2 cups of milk.  I kneeded it 10 times and rolled it out.  This biscuits were delicious!

I was SO happy with the way this recipe turned out.  For some reason I'd been having so much trouble with my biscuits.  They just never came out right.  This are so easy and come out light and fluffy.  They look and taste wonderful.  I always use buttermilk.  That's for a great and time-saving recipe.

great recipe! I made them into sausage biscuits and froze them for my husband to eat in the morning. He is counting them down, and has asked me to make more for him before we run out! I made the mix according to the directions, and them followed the direction on the bisquick box, and they turned out great. I think next time I will try to roll them out a little thicker though, they were a little shorter than KFC's!

This is an outstanding example of perfection through simplicity!  They are quick, easy, and delicious.  I cut the recipe down to make 6 very large biscuits.  I also cut the temp. down to 350 degrees and let them cook just a bit longer.  They came out wonderfully…and I will ALWAYS use this recipe in conjunction with my other cooking.  This is one of those recipes that you can look to as a secret helper in your kitchen.

I made these last night and I have to say that these are the best buscuits I've ever made. I'm not much of a baker so my only complaint is that the directions should have had a cooking temp. and  a milk or buttermilk measurements. Thanks for a great recipe my family loved it.

This is the best biscuit recipe I have found.  My husband made them the first time and they turned out great for biscuits and gravy.  We add 2 cups of milk, knead it for a few seconds, pat it out and then cut the biscuits.  We bake them at 450 degrees for about 12 minutes.  Great Recipe!

I'm not what you call a great cook, so when I find something EASY that tastes good, I'm HAPPY.   I used to buy the canned tubes of biscuits for biscuits and gravy, but tried this recipe today, and it was quick and easy to do. (and cheaper!)  I scaled to '6' and added milk. ....I wonder if the people who had problems were using baking powder that was old...

There was a lot of info missing from this recipe. What temp. to bake at...How much liquid to add and what liquid when preparing. 

One of the reviewers mentioned 1 cup milk for 6 servings. So I tried that. Recipe didn't mention what size thickness to cut biscuits.

I used the 12 serving option. Added 2 cups milk. Cut to 1/4 inch thickness. Biscuits were dry. Could use them for hockey pucks. Recipe is incomplete and more info. is needed to reduce errors.

Very quick and easy. Needed more salt for our personal taste, but other than that the biscuit were very good. I mixed in enough buttermilk to make a moist dough and then turned onto a floured surface and kneaded sparingly until no longer sticky. Instead of rolling out and using a cutter, I simply patted into a rectangle and cut into squares-no rerolling and the biscuits fit perfectly next to one another. Popped them into a 450 degree oven for 12 minutes. Heaven.

I made this recipe, but found it a bit confusing. After making the recipe, I found that you really couldn't make the actual biscuits, until you added some kind of liquid to the recipe's base ingredients. I used milk, and they turned out pretty good, but they were very crumbly. I also wasn't sure as to how long to bake them, or what temperature to set my oven at. I set mine at 375 degrees, and ended up with about ten minutes cooking time. Overall, I liked the taste, but if I make them again, I will definitely have to make some adjustments...

My 10 year old daughter loves to make pancakes from the box mix.  We ran low one day, and I made a half batch of this recipe, dumped into a plastic storage bag and put it in the empty mix box, so my daughter can read the recipes on back while she's cooking.  My family loves pancakes and biscuits from this recipe more than from the box.  As with all my cooking, I mix half white flour and half "whole white flour" for added fiber.

I scaled this down to make about 6.  Before baking I added some milk (not too much) and rolled them into crumbly balls.  I baked them at 400/450 or so for about 12 min.  When they came out they looked like lumpy cooked balls.  I opened one up and it was perfect.  Crunchy/crumbly on the outside and moist and flavorfull on the inside.   I ate 2 of them with butter and I can say the taste is compareable to fast food restraunt biscuits (KFC).

Great recipe! I mixed 3 cups of the mixture together with 7/8 cups milk for the biscuit portion of the Omelet Biscuit Cups recipe on this site. Baked up flaky and fluffy. Storing the remainder of the mixture in the freezer for later.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly. I used butter instead or shortening, if you do that you need to mix it up fresh every time or have the dry ingred. already mixed and cut in the butter fresh every time. That said I have used this recipe base for buscuits many times and every time I get compliments on how good they are. I followed another reviewers comment and used 3/4 c buttermilk per 2 cups mix which seems to be the right amount of liquid. All that being said this is my go to recipe for buscuits, the only one I will use.

SO delicious! And so incredibly easy to mix up.  I put the whole mixture in my stand mixer, and although it just baaarely fit, it did the trick! Next time I will put half in at a time, because it was so dang easy in the mixer, and cut in the shortening to perfection.
I've only made biscuits with this, but they rose higher and were fluffier than when I used Bisquick.  I will be making this again and again!

I used this recipe in the cheddar bay biscuits recipe and it was fantastic. I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings (made 3 3/4 cups) i used margerine since that is all i had and made sure i had everything cut in really well. it took awhile by hand but these were the fluffiest biscuits i have made. Better then bisquik in my opinon. Definitely replace the big daddy biscuits from this site.

I was thrilled to find this recipe, as I have never been able to find baking mix here in the UK. It's opened up so many more recipes for me. For it's first outing I used it in Quick Onion Bread from this site which was a success. I'm sure I'll use this many times. Thanks so much Janet.

This is perfect! Crumbly and melt in your mouth goodness! Started with 12 servings and used butter and brown sugar (out of white). Used milk, finger mixed and rolled into biscuits by hand. The best thing about this is the versatility... fancy dinner? Add some cheese and herbs! Breakfast? Add some buttermilk and make into pancakes! I tend to not really measure items into doughs, and this mixture was perfect! I like that you can really use what you have. I don't keep shortening around, and I am glad to know that butter, lard, bacon fat, whatever is handy will still work in this recipe. A keeper!

This mix is wonderful! I have used it to make both bisquick strawberry shortcakes and flaky biscuits and both items came out fabulous! Bye-bye Bisquick, now I can make my own! I used butter flavor crisco to make this because it was all the sticks I had on hand and I was too lazy to measure out the regular kind from the can. Thanks for the great recipe, this is going to get a lot of use!

Works great for regular biscuits or as "biscuit mix" in casserole recipes.  Great standby to have on hand!  I added about 1 c. buttermilk to 2 1/2 c. mix for biscuits, and they were as good as my normal recipe.

I absolutely LOVE this mix recipe. I have a baby so I need all the extra time I can get and this is a real time-saver. I use it primarily for biscuits (of which my husband can't get enough) but I've also used it for pancakes, waffles and pot pies. Thank you for posting!

These biscuits were delicious.  I made them for bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwiches.  My family loved them so much that I ran out.  I will have to make a bigger batch next time.  Much better than bisquick biscuits!!!

Mmm... I never tried the biscuits by themselves, but I cut down the recipe to 3 biscuits, added a 1/2 cup of milk, and made brown sugar biscuits instead. I rolled out the dough into about a 7x5 inch rectangle, coated the top with melted butter and sprinkled on brown sugar and raisins. Then I rolled starting at the 7 inch side, cut every into inch-wide rolls and cooked it in the oven at 415F for 11 minutes. Made about 5 of various sizes, and they came out crispy on the outside and nice soft inside. I have a hard time limiting myself to eating only two.

This is a wonderful mix to have in your cupboard.  I've been using it for cakes, cookies, loaves and biscuits (recipes I found on this site by ingredient searching under "baking mix").  It sure makes baking a breeze.  Thanks for sharing this, Janet!

I made these as directed in others' reviews using about 1/2 cup of milk. I also made these as drop biscuits instead of cut-out biscuits. Went extremely well with homemade honey butter. Definitely plan on making again!

The biscuit mix turned out way too dry. I had to add more shortening and water in order to salvage it. I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

I'm allergic to wheat.  So I used gluten free all purpose flour instead of regular flour.  Other changes I made were using butter instead of shortening (all I had on hand) and I cut back about 1/2 a tbs of baking powder.  I read other reviews and thought it best to cut back the baking powder, but I really don't think that was necessary.  I know I made a couple of changes, but overall it worked really well for me.

edit: I love this biscuit mix. This will be my second time making it and I will make sure to make enough to store in the fridge. I use 2 cups of the mix and add just enough milk to get a dough consistency to where it is not too sticky (1/2 cup of milk more or less), if it is too sticky I add a little more mix. Then I gently knead it about 15 times, roll it 1 inch thick on a floured surface, then bake until golden brown. After they are done I drizzle a honey and butter mixture on them (2 parts honey 1 part melted butter). They are sooo good. I will never buy frozen biscuts again

This recipe made the best biscuits for Thanksgiving :) I scaled the recipe down to 6 and put 1 cup of milk to make the dough, as was mentioned in Roxyjas' review. To make the biscuits a little more healthy, I used smart balance as a substitute for shortening. It worked great. Thanx :)

Yummy! I decided to use butter instead of shortening..since shortening kills your body..and just put 2 tbsp with 2 1/4 c. mix, then add 3/4 - 1 cup of milk. Bake at 450 for 12 minutes. Delicious! So fluffy and awesome flavor. They rise a LOT so make suer you don't roll the dough any thicker than 1/2 inch. I did it at 1/2 inch and they baked out to be 1 1/2 inches tall! Very good recipe! I'd recommend to anyone :)

I've stopped looking.  This is it.  Light flaky texture, rises well.  I made a 1/2 recipe substituting lard for shortening, and then mixed in 2 cups milk.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow this recipe is wonderful! My kids love it and ask for it at least once a week. I make a big batch and put it in the pantry every week. It might last longer but not in this house. I also tryed somthing new with it tonight.I used 2 1/4 cup mix,1/2 cup milk,1/4 cup milted butter,1/2 tsp cinnonmin,1 Tbsp brown sugar and 1/3 cup raisons. baked for about 10 minuts at 450*F and they turned out really good. I dont have biscuit cutters so I used cookie cutters insted. This recipe will be in our family for a long time I'm sure!

I followed the directions, they were horrible flat greasy and crumbly.  Dont prepare this while your pregnant and hungry or mentally unstable :) Put me into tears and I had to toast a bagel after all the work and mess in the kitchen.  No one liked them and I wasted a bunch of flour! I even read other reviews before preparing them and knew to add milk.  Whats the secret or key? Id like to know before I throw out the rest!

Very easy to do - I also adjusted to 6 servings and added 1 cup of impromptu buttermilk (1 cup of milk with 1 tsp of lemon juice, stirred, and rested for 10 minutes).  Very tasty.

These were totally awesome! I just plopped them onto the pan and they didn't change shape much, so make sure that you like the shape they are when you put them in the oven!! Good luck- these were great!

This is great! I added a cup of Saco buttermilk mix and used butter instead of shortening (storing in fridge). Used it for the Garlic Cheese Biscuits on this site, and they were AWESOME. Thank you so much!

This recipe is GREAT! I was apprehensive about making biscuits because the last time I attmepted, they tasted really bitter (different recipe). But these were quick, easy, and yummy. I used butter instead of shortening, and added heavy cream to form the dough. I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, and there were enough biscuits for 4 people. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

OMG!!! I live in Israel, and we don’t have any biscuits mixes, and kfc over here doesn’t make their famous biscuits which I love! It’s now 1am, and I know I’m crazy, but I scaled the recipe down to one (!) and made one delicious biscuit!! 
I used butter and mixed it all with my hands. Added about 1/3-1/4 cup of milk (not sure)
Yummy!!!!!!!

This is Awesome! It tastes and works the same as the "commerical" biscuit mix. I used it for cobbler and for biscuits-it worked perfectly!

We make quick breads regularly - waffles, biscuits and any recipes that call for baking mix, and knowing how to make this mix is very practical, and better than any commercial ones; I also add 1 cup buttermilk powder and mix it all together. I've made half a mix, using butter (they don't last as long though) oh boy .. yum. Thanks Janet; and I especially love it when I get to know a fave recipe's nutritional info. Good one.

Where I live, you can't easily get packaged baking mixes. This is a wonderful and economical substitute. The biscuits are great, the pancakes just like they should be, and it works as well (or better, since you know what's in it!) in recipes.

so easy as this is Just the mix, the dry ingredient. 
After reading the reviews for ideas or finding a biscuit/pancake/waffle etc, recipe. 
This is brilliant. I am a yank living in the UK and always use this site rather than the UK site. 
Thanks for sharing this. To me it is like being stateside again

I make a half batch since there are just two of us.  I just use it for biscuits, 1 cup mix to 1/4 cup milk or buttermilk for each 3-1/4 x 1 inch biscuit.  I stir the mix and milk together with a wooden spoon and then kneed about 6 or 7 times on the counter dusted with a tablespoon of mix.  I pat it down to about an inch thickness and cut with my Mother's biscuit cutter from the 50's. Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 450° for about 11 minutes, top and bottom should be golden brown.

This is the best biscuit recipe, ever.  I think that the leftover biscuits are AWESOME, especially with a cup of tea.  I also keep my mix in my freezer and just pull it out when I need it -- it lasts forever there.

I love this recipe.  It has replaced Bisquick in my house.  I use all the Bisquick recipes from their website with this and it's so much tastier home-made!  Store in an air-tight container in the fridge.

Very good, very easy. I reduced my ingredients to make 10 and then mixed it all with 1 1/2 cups milk. I've got many more than 10 biscuits and they're wonderful. Going to use them with the biscuits and gravy recipe from here tonight.

This went over really well when I used it for biscuits. The guys loved it for making breakfast sandwhiches and it really was like a KFC buscuit. I haven't had the chance to make pancakes, but I am sure they will be great!

These were just ok. They were edible, but not light and fluffy like my grandmother's.

I use this recipe all the time for biscuits... I halve the recipe though since we don't make biscuits all the time and just use when needed. I also just use hard margarine instead of shortening. My favorite recipe to use this in is "Cheese Biscuits I" from this site.

I was so excited watching how these puffed up as they baked! I haven't had great results with previous recipes from this site. So I scaled this to 6 servings, used half ww and half ap flour, added 1 cup buttermilk, kneaded 10 times, and baked at 450F for 12 minutes. Perfect results!!

Turned out very light and fluffy.  Added milk just as needed and let my daughter cut out fun shapes in the rolled out dough.  Next time I think I will add some garlic and grated cheese to the mixture for a special twist.

What a great short cut! My husband was leaving for work  at 4am and I was NOT getting up to make him bfast that early! LOL! So I did this, and each night before I went to bed I would prepare a few for him for the next day! He still got his home made biscuits and I didn't have to wake up at 3 am!

Good Mix.  I used this to make "Garlic Cheese Biscuits" and pancakes.  Both were excellent.  For sweet recipes this doesn't substitute for all the sugar.  I substituted oat bran for 2 cups of the flour and used butter instead of shorting. My version needs refrigerated.

Awesome recipe! So quick & easy...you can even whip them up for a fast breakfast. And the mix stays good in the fridge for quite a while (not that it gets a chance to stay in the fridge!)... it won rave reviews from the crew, especially when partnered with honey butter!

I really like this recipe.  I used them as drop biscuits in a turkey stew and they were really good.  Had some left over and made a few in the oven, which were also good.  I have another biscuit recipe that i prefer over this one, but this one wins hands-down for ease and quickness.  I substituted coconut oil for the shortening because i do not use shortening in my cooking.

The bicuits are awesome, I cooked them @ 450, with 3/4 C buttermilk, and brushed them with 1 egg+1 Tbsp milk.
 Absolutely the best. Thank you Janet.

Very good biscuit base. I left the sugar out of the base and added sugar only when I  made shortcakes. Very yummy. I will DEFINITELY make this again (oh, and for those of you who don't live in the states, shortening is Graisse végétale (fr) or Pflanzenfett (al) - I had a hard time finding it!)

There is a little too much baking powder in this. I made some mix up and used it for pancakes and biscuits. They both tasted a little like baking powder. Next time i will try it with 1/2 the amount of baking powder.Other then that it's a great recipe. Thanks.

I had never made biscuits before in my life so I was a little nervous about trying this recipe. Since reviews raved about how easy it was I decided to go for it. I made the whole batch for a gathering at the park and everyone loved them! These were the easiest, most amazing biscuits ever. I added shredded cheddar cheese and I think next time around I will use buttermilk instead of regular milk to make them more savory.

I was making French Onion biscuits when I realized that my baking mix had expired.  Allrecipes to my rescue.  This was the first recipe that I found, and it came together really fast and well.  I did use bread flour in my batch b/c it has the most gluten and that's what you want when you making something chewy like a biscuit. I won't be buying baking mix again. Thanks for the recipe.

I am so glad I finally found a biscuit mix that actually tastes this great. They are light and fluffy and no baking powder after taste. They are close to my mom's who made the best biscuits from scratch. She only use  self-rising flour,crisco and milk. Wish I paid more close attention when was making them.  
I used 2 1/4 cu mix and 2/3 cup buttermilk. I followed the instructions to the tee with the exceptof brushing the tops with butter. AWESOME!!!

Used whole wheat flour instead and didn't put the salt in, but came out excellent!  mmm!!! My family, including the 2 y/o ate them up... FAST!  Will definately make this again!!!!

BTW, used 1/4(+) C mixture to 1 1/2 Tbsp whole milk milk (yield: ONE biscuit :-)) at 450F for approx 12 min.  Came out excellent!

Used this as a base for cheddar biscuits, which turned out great. Not sure which recipe to praise, so both get five stars. Biscuits came out light and tasty.

I tried this recipe and was very pleased. I have made biscuits from scratch before and never had them turn out even half this well. I used the amount for 6 people and added 1 3/4 cups of milk and used butter flavored shortening to add flavor. My only mistake was that I rolled the dough out to flat when I cut them and they didnt rise as much as I would have liked, but that was my own fault. Even after that they still turned out great. Next time I'll add garlic and cheese and a pinch more salt for a new taste.

The best biscuit mix I have used so far. I used butter flavored shortening & combined the ingredients in my food processor. A couple of pulses on the low speed will do it. The first time I tried they came out wonderfully crumbly and light but on the dry side. So I made them again using 1/2 c apple sauce (cinnamon flavored) & 1/3 c lemon/lime flavored sodapop. Good results. This time moister in the middle & they did have a light cinnamon smell. The biscuits rise up just fine without the use of the carbonation from the soda. It was an experiment. Will have to try buttermilk next time.

I needed a biscuit mix to make sausage balls (I usually use bisquick), so I tried this recipe. The texture of the final product was nice & tender, with a nice crunch on the outside. I thought the flavor was a little bland and would either add more salt or maybe use part butter next time. I cut way back on the sugar. I will make again.

Perfect in a pinch!  I accidentally used baking soda instead of baking powder so my biscuits were very bitter, but otherwise the recipe was great!  My mistake!  LOL

Like another reviewer, I scaled the recipe down quite a bit and used milk to activate it.  Baked them right away and had them with dinner. They were ok, nothing spectacular, but I liked how easy they were and since I used butter instead of shortening, I avoided all the trans-fatty poison you get with boxed mixes.  Overall these weren't that bad.

These were simply outstanding! I followed another user recipes and added milk to the mixture. I scaled down the recipe to half and added something like 2 1/2 cups of milk and rolled out the dough. I brushed the top with a bit of butter. The biscuits came out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy. Very inexpensive and convienient substitute to Bisquick mix in other recipes. Although, it would have been nice to include how to make just plain ol' biscuts using this recipe. I used a little over 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 1/2 cup whole milk to make dinner biscuts. Turned out nice and fluffy, although a little crumbly. Next time, I will do the same, but add a little melted butter to hold biscut together and add a little extra buttery flavor. Great recipe though!

(I would not recommend eating more than 1 serving in 1 sitting... the caloric intake is sky high)  
Big, fluffy, yummy.  She's right!  The possibilities are endless.  I served it to myself and I enjoyed it.  For the first trial I cut in 1 cut of ricotta cheese  and about 1/2-3/4 cup of water for every 5 cups of flour. Let's see what happens at the next family get together.

This is the best biscuit recipe ever! I loved it, it taste very similar to KFC biscuits! I wouldn't  change a thing. My whole family raved about it. We put honey or jelly with butter on it and we gobbled it up.

Excellent recipe. I usually use canned biscuits for biscuits and sausage gravy.Didn't feel like running to the store so I scaled this down and tried it. 
I will be making this again and doing a bigger batch so I can store it.

I've made two dishes using this recipe: Cheddar Bay Biscuits (from allrecipes.com) and pancakes. The biscuits turned out well, but the pancakes were soooooo thick and chewy - the texture wasn't great, the taste was just blah. I won't be using this biscuit mix recipe again.

Great recipe!  It was quick and easy.  However, in the beginning I did not realize that this was a "mixture" as it did mention.  I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings, used whole wheat hi-pro flour, 1 tbsp of sugar, and added 1 cup of "soy milk" - that's it...and no yeast... My husband loved it too.
This is definitely a winner.  Went perfect with my soup. :-)

Tasted much like bisquick, but better. I think I rolled my buscuits a bit too thin however..but it didn't change the taste.

I have allergies so was glad to see a from scratch (yellow box) mix. I used lard instead of shortening. I also used powdered milk with water as I had no fresh milk. I liked thease better than the box mix even with the powdered milk I used. Thanks much for the recipe, now I can enjoy the quick easy recipes again that call for (yellow box Biscuit mix)

Very good. Their light and flakey. And they baked better in my oven then the boxed mix does. We go through a LOT of biscuits in my house, so it is good to have this recipe, when your pinching pennies especially. Thanks for sharing it Janet.

Made this last night for creamed chicken over biscuts.  Fantastic!  I used cold butter cut into thin slices instead of shortening.  Making the biscuits again today for blueberry cobbler.  Adding a bit more sugar.

These made excellent biscuits.  Very light.  I used butter instead of shortening.  As someone else said to do, I made the servings six and used 1 cup of milk.   Kneaded 10 times and rolled out. 450 degrees 12 min.  It made 10.

I made these with the changes that user ROXYJAS made, cut the flour to 6 cups (the rest of the ingredients cut in half), ADD MILK THIS STEP IS NOT LISTED (except I used 1 1/2 cups buttermilk), mix then knead, cut and baked for 10-15 min (higher altitude).  They came out fluffy and light and quite yummy.

I'm about to make this for the third time. At first I made it in a pinch b/c I ran out of "bisquick" now I love it! I personally think it's better than the boxed stuff (gasp!) and I know what's in it, score! I have been making half this amount just to be sure I would use it up. I've used it for biscuits, a casserole and pancakes, just like the author says just use it as you would the original yellow boxed stuff!

I have made sausage pinwheels with this recipe multiple times and they are fabulous. Make the biscuit dough as normal. Split dough in half, then roll half of dough out very thin and spread half of a pound of sausage over the rolled out dough. Roll into a long roll, then cut 1/2" slices. Repeat for other half of dough. Sausage should be room temp so it will spread easier. Bake at 350 until lightly golden brown.

This is the best biscuit recipe I've found. I have been making biscuits all my life like my Grandma taught me. Nothing measured. I've been teaching the kids and grandkids and they all want measurements, go figure! I did double the amount of sugar to cover the baking powder flavor and give a little sweetness. I've tried several recipes online and this one is the best. Just make a well in the mixture and pour in your milk or buttermilk until they hold together. Add a little at a time but be careful not to overwork them. Dust a little flour on if they are too sticky. Pinch off or roll out, they are fabulous!

This worked wonderfully! I did the same as a previous reviewer. I cut the mix down to 6 servings, added 1 cup of milk, kneaded a bit, rolled to about 1/2 in thickness, cut out discs and baked at 450 degrees for 8-10 minutes.  Perfection! 
Cutting back to 6 servings made 14 biscuits.

I used this recipe to make a quick batch of cheddar biscuits and loved the simplicity of this mix. I added shredded cheddar after altering the serving size of the original recipe to 6. Then added 1 cup of buttermilk. Delicious! Thanks Janet!

This mixture was very dry and crumbly for me, so I had to add milk until I got the consistency I wanted. I don't have much cooking experience at all so this was a guess for me. It turned out fine but this ended up being more work than I was expecting. They were good though.

I needed a half cup of bisquick for a recipe.  I divided this recipe's servings by 20 and whipped this up.  I would like to make a half sized batch and either keep in the fridge or leave out the shortening and keep in the pantry.  

Just a tip, if you hate cutting in shortening or butter like I do, throw it in the blender and pulse a few times.

I didn't make any biscuits out of it, so not sure how it holds up in that area.  But as a baking mix it is great.

Easy recipe to make. Taste great. Though mine weren't light and fluffy.  However, I did cut the recipe down to 1/4 of what it was, so I probably messed up.

All of the women in my family were phenominal bakers. I have been the exception to this rule. It's been one of my life's goals to be able to make big, light fluffy biscuits. (no kidding) FINALLY I have the right recipe. Thank you SO MUCH!
Last night I made the mix with half butter and half shortening, added powdered buttermilk to the 2/3 cup of milk and made dumplings with my Irish stew. 
They were so wonderfully light and fluffy that my family raved about them. My 4 year old grandson filled up on dumplings and forgot to eat his stew. I am looking forward to making a huge batch of biscuits and gravy for my family this weekend.
Again, thank you, this is fabulous and so easy!
If possible to add to the recipe, it would be good to have the liquid measurements for things like biscuits. Luckily other posters left notes, thanks to all of you :¬D

Absolutely delicious!!  My husband and I love these biscuits and I just can't say enough good about them.  I used some of the advice given in other reviews (how much milk to use and how long to bake) when I made them up.  YUM!

This is an excellent biscuit recipe. I've never been a very good baker, but this recipe is very easy to follow, and easy to prepare. The best part, is the biscuits are quite delicious. I've been asked for the recipe by friends.

I made these about 2wks ago and I'm doing a review cus my hubby noticed that we didnt have biscuits and actually requested that I make the biscuits I made last time, so due to demand I am rating this recipe, which was easy and moist on the inside and had a nice texture and I did knead the dough about 5x and jus dropped by spoonful on baking sheet and they rose quite fine. Thank you so much I'm an amatuer cook and new to baking and this will be my new biscuit recipe.

Thanks for posting this! I needed biscuit mix and didn't have any so I used the feature to scale this way down. Worked like a charm!! Thanks again!

Do not buy any more boxed biscuit mix!  This is totally easy and much better tasting.

I use EASY BISCUIT MIXTURE more than the national brands. The only time I use the national brands is when I have to.

I use this for everything!  I no longer buy refrigerator biscuits and my husband doesn't mind.  I use this just as I would Bisquick or any other store-bought biscuit mix.

I have no clue where I went wrong with this.  I followed the recipe.  My biscuits came out dense and mushy on the inside.  They just wouldn't cook through. :(  I think I'll try using it again just to make sure I didn't mess up the biscuit recipe I was using.

I love this biscuit mix - but I found that I often have to add a little more than the recipe calls for (when it asks for the name-brand).  Still - what a money saver!
