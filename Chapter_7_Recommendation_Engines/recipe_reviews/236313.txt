This recipe fit right in with the meal plan my husband and I are eating. It was very very good, but I did add a little more seasonings to it, as we like more flavor. I added the cheese blend at the table, as my husband is allergic to dairy. The filling was moist but did not hold together, and I wonder if the egg should have been added raw to the meat mixture giving it more binding. Adding a hard boiled egg was a bit odd, it tasted fine but didn't really add anything to the mix.

I made this dish because I’ve been looking for different ways to cook with ground beef. It was good but I think next time I’m going to make a red gravy to top it with and the cheese there just wasn’t enough of the tomato taste and maybe a little more basil and a little Italian seasoning.

Very good and easy to make-yes more seasonings are necessary. But overall delicious!

It was good but definitely needs more flavor. I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions and added some additional seasoning but seems it still wasn't enough. Next time I'll add a pinch more.

ery good recipe that I ended up grilling outside. I didn't add egg to my recipe and top it off with some Parmesan cheese.

Fabulous! Great idea! Served with a kale-feta-pinenut salad. I used leftover taco salad meat/olive/tomato with spanish rice and mixed together with the eggplant. Served for my family of 7. Mom liked it, Dad loved it. From Cody, age 22

We stuck to the recipe and loved the flavor. About the only negative is that the eggplant didn't give the amount of pulp that I expected. The result was a very tasty dish that was kind of overbalanced in ground beef and the texture of the eggplant wasn't significant.

I followed the recipe except for the hard boiled egg and it was disappointing. Pretty much tasteless.
