I thought this was wonderful. It was very tasty and fun to make. My advice to anyone who makes it, make sure you use balsamic vinegar at the end (it's not optional!), otherwise this will be a very bland dish. I skipped over the balsamic vinegar for the first bite, thought it was boring, then added it in and it transformed the dish and rocketed it from 3 stars to 5.  This also tastes great with baked zucchini chips on the side.

This was a hit and a miss in our house. I liked the idea of the feta, but not hubs, so I unfortunately had to leave it out. I loved the little spark the red pepper flakes added, but it was a little too hot for hubby's sensitive innards, so be careful with children or those who can't tolerate any "heat." And I didn't even use as much as the recipe called for! Because this is such a fresh and colorful dish I thought it would be better suited with fresh basil, and I used halved grape tomatoes for additional color and texture. I went heavier on the garlic, about one clove for the recipe scaled to two servings. I served this with a rather robust chicken dish so the fact this was light on any additional spices or herbs made this the perfect accompaniment. I think what I like best about this is that it's just so darn pretty on the plate!

Very good.  I tried this recipe to use up some extra pine nuts and I
wasn't just pleasantly surprised, I was astonished how good it was.  The
cheese adds a delicious creaminess; the tomatoes provide a refreshing
tang; the pine nuts give a wonderful fragrance; the orzo and wilted
spinach in spices serve as a nice base. And it's quite pretty.One
nice feature of the recipe is that the main ingredients are prepared
separately so each person can mix them to his or her own preference.  (I
like more spinach (50% more) and much more tomatoes (100% more) and less
cheese (33% less).)   Some changes: I used half the olive oil and
2/3rds the butter.

Elegant is right!  Really easy to make  and it tasted gourmet!  I had tomato/basil feta which was excellent on top.  I might toss in a few sundried tomatoes next time.  Will definitely make again!!

I've made this about six times now and I find myself looking forward to it each time. Other reviewers are correct, don't skimp on the spinach and cut the oil. Great for a summer side dish.

Absolutely first rate!  Follow other reviewers advice and cut way back on the fats - 2 tablespoons of olive oil and no butter.  Also didn't add any tomato because they're so disgusting this time of year.  Made far more than we could eat in one meal, so I stirred in some quartered artichoke hearts and balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing, and had a delicious pasta salad!  Thanks for the post!

I'm in the "just okay" camp.  Definitely needs some more zip.  After the pine nuts and spinach are sauteed, my reaction was "That's a lot of oil to pour over the orzo."  But, it works out fine.  The problem is that it IS too bland.  I'd lower the olive oil next time and replace it with red wine vinegar, tsp. of salt and 1/2 red onion.  Looks pretty...has great potential...but B-L-A-H.

This is a good recipe. In my opinion you need more seasoning. I make another orzo pasta which is much better. The only changes I made were reducing the olive oil way down. I did add more garlic. I will make this again but use more garlic,  red chili flakes, add salt and pepper, maybe add red onion.  I may try balsamic vinegar instead.

This recipe was great. I didn't have any orzo on hand, so substituted it with Basmati rice and it worked out wonderfully.  This was a great way to sneak in some spinach without any complaints.

Really likes this!!  I don't like tomatoes so I omittef that but made everything else as written.  I didn't use an additional frying pan, just used the same pot I cooked the orzo in to heat the EVOO, spices and wilt the spinach then added the orzo back in...makes less clean up.

I loved this dish!  It is not only delicious but so pretty...will be making this for company soon!  Per the advise of others I did add additional spinach and tomatoes which I loved as well as a little less oil.  This recipe makes a lot so the next day I added red onions, and yellow peppers and grilled chicken for a quick pasta salad for lunch.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Not the best recipe.  I don't know why but something was off... the combo of the ingredients just didn't work for me or my husband.  Thankfully, a friend or mine recently shared a simpler and tastier orzo recipe... orzo, chopped sundried tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, feta cheese, and basil (all added in portions you prefer... I always add a lot of nuts). Don't worry about oil and salt as the tomatoes provide plenty.  I also add fresh cracked black pepper.  Trust me, it's great!!!

WOW!  This is so good, yet so easy-just my kind of side dish!  I actually forgot 2 clutch ingredients (tomatoes and pine nuts) and it was still fabulous, so I can't wait to make it as written (I knew I'd forgotten to pick up pine nuts, but I forgot I used the last of the tomatoes for last night's Tomato Cheese Crunch).  Even Mr. LTH loved this (and he *hates* vinegar!).  THANK YOU for a new staple at the LTH house!

The strange thing about this is we thought it tasted bland for a few seconds and then the red pepper comes out and it's great! We actually liked it better after it had been chilled and all the flavors came together.

WOW! Served this as a side dish at a family dinner - should have doubled the recipe!!!!!! I've been asked to always bring this dish! I added chicken broth to the orzo when I cooked that (1/2 chicken broth 1/2 filtered water)

Almost perfect - I add twice the spinach, a couple more tomatoes and a tad more garlic and hot pepper. I like this even better cold the next day. Then you can add the feta and cheese before serving & let people at the balsamic. I've had nothing but compliments on the recipe.

Based on many other reviews, I did not want to quite follow the recipe and end up with blah. Did, however, add the balsamic vinegar, some red wine, fresh pressed garlic to the butter and half the oil. I had no pine nuts so substituted sliced almonds. Wow!! First time and already it's on the request list.

My AllRecipes search began with the need to use up a couple of ripe tomatoes and some fresh spinach.  Though I made a couple of changes to accommodate ingredients I had on hand, I don’t believe I compromised the dish. It truly is elegant with luscious flavors.  I didn't have orzo, so I substituted 8 oz. uncooked very tiny macaroni pasta. Half a cup of olive oil seemed too much, so I halved it and am satisfied with this change.  I used 2 medium tomatoes, diced, added to the pan along with the spinach.  Because I didn't have feta cheese, I went out on a limb and used Camembert, with rind removed and then grated. This went into the pan at the very end with the Balsamic Honey Vinegar.  I will make this again and again, and try the recipe as written next time.  But now I know I can improvise if necessary.  What a find this is!!!

I just made this last night with some grilled chicken. It was really good but I had to add a  1/2 cup of chicken broth to moisten it. I think next time I will use chicke broth and cut out the butter to make it healthier.

This is really good. I had it with steak au poivre, and it was a great combo. I used walnuts in place of the pine nuts, as that is what I had. I also don't think the spinach needs to be cooked for five minutes. One to two minutes was enough for me, and I didn't even cover the pan. Plus, the hot orzo helps to wilt it even more. Overall, very good and quick.

I have made this twice.  The first time was according to the recipe with the exception of cutting back on the oil and butter.  Its quite good but makes a huge quantity.  The second time, I made it with 8 oz of mini bow-tie pasta since I was out of orzo 4 oz of feta and reduced the butter and oil to about a tablespoon each.  I used toasted pecans in place of the pine nuts. Since my family doesnt like spicy food, I also cut the red pepper to 1/8t.  Everything else, I left at the original quantity.  This version was quite good as well, even though orzo is nicer in this recipe than the bow-ties.  I will probably make it again using parmesean or asiago cheese instead of feta to see how that works. Don't be afraid to try this recipe and tweak it to suit your family's taste preferences.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it. I made just a few alterations, and used extra of all the herbs, and a bit larger drizzle of balsamic vinegar. I added a bit of chicken boullion with the herbs/oil/butter mixture, and I did not have orzo pasta so I just used angel hair (still yummy with it!). I also didn't have quite half of a tomato, but I used what I had on hand anyway. Instead of fresh garlic (which I also didn't have) I used garlic powder, and at the time you would normally saute the garlic I sauteed red onion as a tasty addition to the recipe. I also added the chopped tomato to the wilted spinach mixture right before tossing it with the pasta, to warm the tomato slightly. So yummy!  I'll definitely recommend this to friends.

I have a new fav recipe! Thank you for sharing! It actually tastes better the next day as left-overs, and if there's tons left and you're looking for something different to do with it, you can just add some spaghetti sauce! The ONLY thing I changed was just adding salt to taste (per plate) and left out the vinegar just because I REALLY don't like vinegar. Otherwise, made as-written and it's incredible!

I served this with marinated chicken breasts sliced overtop, and I used half as much oil and no butter to try and avoid some fat in this dish (it seemed to be missing something, so it could have been the fat). Everyone in the family liked this even after I altered it, so it is definately a keeper.

Great recipe! I'm not a big fan of feta and found it overwhelming, so when I made it a 2nd time, I just sprinkled a bit of feta, along with some diced fresh mozzerella and it was excellent!

Had this for dinner one night, we loved it.  Very pretty on the plate, flavors went very well together.  Changed things to suit our tastes and what we had on hand and found recipe very forgiving.  Less pine nuts and thought there was still enough, less butter and oil, and thought you could even wilt the spinach in stock or something.  Used cherry tomatoes cut up, threw them in with the spinach at the last minute to warm them up, then mixed the feta right in with all of it, which made it so creamy.  We did find the balsamic helped give it some zip, but it still needed a little more salt and pepper.  I would like almost double the spinach tho.  Thanks for sharing, we will definitely make this again!

This was really easy and quick. It was missing something though, so I added chopped Italian sausage. Really gave the dish a much more substantial flavor.

Very good tasting and looks great. Sundried in place of the fresh tomato is a great change. I would also recommend cutting up the spinach before cooking. I used baby spinach, and it sort of "clumped", meaning many fork-fulls were without and some had too much spinach. A small note to improve a great recipe. Thanks.

well, the family really liked it. I don"t like feta but decided to try the recipe as was written.  I decided I really DON't like feta.  I let it sit in the fridge for about 2 hours and the pasta seemed to really soak up the spices.  I recommend doing that.  I will definately make this again but with motzarella instead of feta (my personal preference).

Not only is this dish delicious, it looks elegant.  I brought it to a Christmas party potluck and it was a big hit.  Based on the reviews, I cooked the Orzo (al dente) in chix broth.  I used a little less EEOV than called for.  After lightly browning the pine nuts I added about an 1/8th of a c. of dry white wine, and then only slightly wilted the spinach before tossing the mixture with the orzo. I also added some finely chopped sundried tomatoes in addition to the regular tomato. I sprinkled the  balsamic vinegar and the feta (used tomato/basil feta) just before serving.  I did not use the full amount of balsamic called for as I was concerned the flavor would be overpowering.

Through the roof, wonderful-- even better the next day, either reheated or cold over salad.  Just added a bit of extra garlic, since we're garlic nuts in our house! Thank you so much~ this is one recipe I'll use again and again!

I was missing some ingredients (tomatoes and pine nuts) so I added black beans and chopped olives (variety).  Delicious and so easy to make.  I found that the spinach wilts quickly just tossing in the pan and did not need to cover for 5 minutes.

I have made this several times.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it needs a little more flavor.  I use sun-dried tomatoes instead of regular.  I also add a little more balsamic vinegrette (and less oil).

This was pretty bland, I had to add lots of salt and pepper to give it some flavor.  But when we ate the leftovers we added calamata olives and extra red pepper flakes (approximately 1/4 teaspoon per serving) and it was great!

Pretty good.  I agree with others that less oil can be used.  The feta and tomatoes make the dish.  I added extra basil and some oregano for flavor. I also used chopped hazelnuts in place of pine nuts as I don't care for their flavor.  I think this dish could really be five stars with some chicken broth added and artichoke hearts would go swimmingly. Try this one and you'll enjoy it!

Deelish.  I changed this up a bit, by blending some of the ingredients from the carmelized onion and blue cheese orzo recipe from this site.  i followed pretty much but I left out the tomatoes and instead of feta I used blue cheese, two heads of fresh spinach and extra garlic.  Wonderful with the balsamic and blue cheese together!!

This was definitely tasty. I was looking for a side dish to go with lamb and it was perfect. I didn't have a big enough bag of spinach, it definitly could have used more than my 6oz bag but was great anyway. Since orzo cooks so quickly, it was easy to put together and my guests went back for seconds!

Great recipe - this is very close to a favorite dish of mine that a local restaurant has stopped making.  I reduced the amount of olive oil and added in sundried tomatoes, which gave a lot of flavor.  Add them in at the same time as the pine nuts.

Since pine nuts are so expensive here in Tokyo ($8 for 1cup) I was glad they didn't go to waste.  The flavor was really good and tasted even better the next day when we took the leftover to a picnic.

I do think the amount of oil called for is way too much.  I only used 1/4c olive oil and 1tbsp butter and still found it a tad oily.

I found this recipe while in a rush to find a side for my entree (salmon).  I had most of the ingredients on hand but still left out quite a few things: the olive oil, crushed red pepper (I typically don't like spicy things), the pine nuts and the tomato.  Even without these ingredients, this was a really stunning and simple recipe that is definitely going in the do-again box.

Too much oil - cut oil by 1/3 to 1/2 amount in recipe. Dish is very bland without salt and balsamic vinegar.  Increase all spices to compensate for bland flavor.

Delicious!  I over cooked the pine nuts but that was my own fault.  And despite that I cook with spinach at least once a week, I always forget how much spinach cooks down once wilted/steamed/etc.... just a reminder!

Love; will add more spinach next time because it really wilts down to a miniscule amt!  Also added chicken at the end for my meat-loving husband :)

This is one of those no-fail recipes which holds up well to changes/substitutions. I sauteed a small onion and added more garlic. I don't care for cooked spinach, so I added raw spinach to the hot, cooked orzo and gave it a good stir to avoid clumping. Perfect!  Sadly, no pine nuts on hand, so I added toasted walnuts instead. Next time, I'll add more tomato (sun-dried would be fabulous). Even though I enjoy balsamic, I didn't enjoy it in this dish, so I'll play around with other options in the future. I made this as a main dish for our weekly Meatless Monday dinner, however, it would make a wonderful side dish to chicken or fish. Simple, quick, and solid recipe which will definitely be made again.

No ingredient changes! Which is really saying something for me. I did use half the oil and half the orzo. The orzo was a little over-cooked at 8 minutes. But yum, and so QUICK.

So easy.. my daughter and I loved it.. but I was glad I heeded advice and cut the oil back.. Also.. I did not stop to think how much 1 lb of pasta would make.. so LOTS of leftovers.. Am going to try adding artichoke hearts and balsamic vinaigrette for a pasta salad,as suggested in another review.. Will definitely be making this again.

This is an awesome recipe! I made enough to take to lunch for work but ended up eating it all! I didn't follow the recipe to the fullest, though. I left out the tomatoes and vinegar and instead of Feta I used Goat Cheese. The next time I make it (tonight :) ) I think i am going to use less EVO and butter.

So yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly but threw in a handful of diced red onion at the end to keep them crunchy.  I also used halved cherry tomatoes because it is what I had on hand.   To keep the cost down, I think I will replace the very expensive pine nuts with slivered almonds next time.

LOVED it!  I decided on this recipe to go with grilled salmon and portobello mushrooms as I had spinach that needed using up.  I cut the recipe in half and opted to only use 1-2 tablespoons at most of olive oil (leaving out the butter).  I didn't feel the quantity or both ingredients were necessary (lots of extra calories to an already calorie rich dish!).  As I was out of pine nuts, I decided not to sub another nut in their place.  While adding slivered almonds would have been great, again, the calorie thing made me chose otherwise!  The balsamic, feta and tomatoes add the perfect finishing touch to an amazing dish!

What a great side dish, particularly if you are looking for something a little different. As another reviewer noted, without the balsamic vinegar (and I would add the feta cheese and tomatoes), all of which are added at the end, this would be a very bland dish (albeit quite attractive looking). But with the vinegar, cheese, and tomatoes, the side dish really takes off. The recipe is also much easier to prepare than one might assume when viewing the list of ingredients. Excellent.

Very pretty!  I also agree that this is somewhat bland--the balsamic vinegar makes it, so don't be hesitant with it.  I added some wine to deglaze the pan since the herb and garlic mixture starting sticking, so I added a bit more flavor of my own.  Bf wouldn't like this, so it's a good thing we still have leftover stuffed peppers and chicken with rice for him to have!  Thanks for the recipe.

I also cut the olive oil in half. During the summer months, I make the orzo, add balsamic, and then stuff the orzo into summer tomatoes and let them warm in the oven to melt the cheese. I sprinkle them with fresh basil and parsley right before serving. Such a pretty plate with the cedar plank salmon from this site.

I recently served this alongside grilled chicken breasts and all of my guests loved it! I reduced the evoo called for in the recipe and set pretty bottles of oil & balsamic on the table so people could add more if they wished too. I also served the feta on the side since some people don't like feta. It was a huge hit and everyone got it just the way they liked it. I didn't have any leftovers because my guests all asked if they could take some home with them.

This was a huge disappointment. I was really looking forward to making this because of all the great reviews. Way way way to bland for me. It also made a HUGE portion. The flavors just did not mix well at all and like I said very bland.

I was very excited to try this because I love all of these things individually; but the flavors did not mesh well at all.  The vinegar and feta cheese were to pungent and really ruined the taste of the dish.  Maybe with a little tweaking....

Pretty good. Feta cheese and spinach are really good in this. Balsamic vinegar is kind of unnecessary. Could use a few more spices - it feels like it should be spicy because of the crushed red pepper, but it's not.

I can't get enough of this. I made it for lunch today and wished for more when I was finished. I made it in smaller proportions since it was just for me and added some tomatoes roasted with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic, and it was perfection. I prefer this with fresh parmesan rather than the feta. Seems that adding the pine nuts along with the spinach keeps them from toasting a bit too much. So good and so healthy. BTW, I barely wilt my spinach so plenty of nutrients remain, and I love it that way personally.

This was great!!  I halved the oil and butter, doubled the spinach, added grape tomatoes before I added the spinach and used spaghetti squash instead of orzo.  The vinegar is a must, definitely a keeper!!

I've made this several times both with and without pinenuts (I've got friends who are allergic) and it's delicious both ways.

Needed to add extra salt, vinegar, garlic, and fresh parsley and left out the butter completely.    Otherwise delicious and really easy!

This dish is probably the best tasting side dish I've ever made, and it's really easy to make and doesn't require a plethora of ingredients.  I prefer sundried tomatoes to the regular as it adds that uniquely powerful taste that seems to work so well with the feta.  Have always gotten rave reviews!

I made this for dinner and thought it was  a great recipe for summer.  I was able to put it together without really measuring the ingredients, since you can eyeball what amount of each item looks like it will taste good to you.  I did use only a small coating of olive oil for the pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm only giving this a 3 because I feel it needs alot of tweaking. Like others have stated, it is very bland. I halved the oil but left the butter the same. I felt it would have been way too  oily. I increased the garlic ALOT. 1/2 tspn of minced garlic didn't seem like  enough to me.  I also felt that the tomato added nothing to the dish. Maybe it was just my tomato :)   I used more than 10 ounces of spinach because I had it and I didn't want to waste it.  I will make this again but I will take other reviewers suggestions and add wine and maybe some red onion.  It is an absolutely beautiful dish.  For guests and presentation purposes this could be served in hollowed out tomatoes. I added some chopped parsley too because I looove parsley. Thanks for sharing.

Completely amazing. I used goat cheese instead of feta, and it was unbelievable, both warm and cold. Can only recommend it.

Terrific recipe!  I doubled the garlic and basil and halved the olive oil.  I also added 1/2 tsp. salt to the olive oil.  I loved the results!  The red pepper adds just the right amount of kick and the basalmic vinegar just the right amout of zip.  It's a wonderful dish and keeps my love affair with pine nuts alive!

With the exception of reducing the amount of oil & butter,as others suggested, I made this recipe as stated.  Though it is a pleasant looking dish, it was severely lacking in the taste department.  I served it slightly warm.  Today I tested the left-overs - cold.  It tasted horrible cold. Spinach took on a weird flavor.  Individally, I love all the ingrediants and thought that I would love this dish especially with so many 5 stars reviews. I was very dissappointed especially with the cost of feta & pinenuts. Thank goodness I served it to my family and not to guests. My recommendation would be to a test run before you consider preparing it for guests.

A really delicious dish.  I cut way back on the oil (probably only 1 T - I used a nonstick skillet) and omitted the butter... I'm sure it would be quite greasy if I hadn't. I only added a tiny pinch of red pepper because my kids were going to eat it too - and they liked it. My husband doesn't like feta, so I added an Italian cheese blend instead, and I didn't have any tomato.  I think it would be great with sundried tomato and maybe some mushrooms too. I served this with some falafel, hummus, and veggies.  Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe!

Wow!  Dont overlook this recipe!!  The first time I saw the name, I wasnt impressed but after reading the ingredients I wanted to try it out.  This was REALLY REALLY! good and especially for such an 'unlikely' combination.  BTW, I didnt have enough pine nuts so I broke up some raw pecams and cooked them with the rest and it was awsome.

Oh yum!  SO GOOD!  Had to omit the pine nuts (allergy in the family).  Added a tiny bit of minced shallot.  Made ahead and just stirred the vinegar into the whole dish. Added the feta when time to serve. We absolutely loved it.  Thanks!  Great dish!  Oh, and very pretty too.

We loved this!  It makes a ton, so next time if I'm only making this for two of us, I will cut it in half.  I mixed the balsamic vinegar, feta and tomatoes in the bowl and it was very good.

Wow...This is so good. I was very suprised. I just had lots of extra pine nuts and this worked out well! I think it has plenty of zing... I don't understand why people thought it didn't.

Served this as a cold pasta salad. Used tomato-basil feta and sundried tomatoes. Also used the frozen spinach, as per other reviews. My guests raved about it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I was a little worried about serving it to my husband since he hates spinach, but he ate it. I halved the amount of orzo, but left the other ingredients about the same. I was unable to find pine nuts, so I had to omit them. This was a quick and simple but totally elegant dish that went wonderfully with baked salmon. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was easy to make and had a very different, fresh taste.  I liked it alot.  I especially liked it b/c I have a family member who is allergic to all mayonaise based products, as well as salad dressings, so it was a nice side dish to offer with a brunch I made. Everyone enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe to go with a fish dinner and it was great. I did alter it a bit because the fish had feta cheese and tomatoes in it. I added fresh, sliced mushrooms to the pine nuts before adding the spinach. Once on the plate, I put some of the tomatoes and feta cheese from the fish over the orzo - it made a very nice presentation and the orzo still got the tomato and feta taste as well.

Definitely needed more spinach. I also added some shallots and cut back slightly on the red pepper the second time I made this. A good start though.

I am telling you, this dish is outstanding!  I started making this last summer and it has become my signature dish around town, my friends ask me to bring it to EVERY party, infact im making it for the zillionth time on Saturday.  I add the tomatos, feta and balsamic (just a dash, too much overwhelms the dish and changes the flavor) to the orzo all at once, it makes for a beautiful presentation, and absolutley delicious!

I love orzo pasta and I was eager to try this.  It was just OK.  I only used 1/3 cup of oil, but it was still too much for my liking.  Other reviewers are correct...it was bland.  Next time, I will add onions, maybe green peppers, and more balsamic vinegar.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I've made it about four times and get rave reviews from everyone, including my brother, the skeptic. I don't change a thing, other than that I go ahead and toss the feta and chopped tomatoes in with everything else at the end, but do splash the balsamic on individually. This is a recipe that has top billing in my recipe box.

I liked this!  I took to heart that other reviewers said it was a bit bland and added in a spoonful of chicken boullion.  I also added a touch of garlic salt and stirred the the tomatoes and feta into the rice.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

this was very good - I did not know what to make for supper, but I had tomatoes, orzo, pine nuts and (frozen) spinach.  I made it with some pan fried shrimp.  The only thing I would change is the balsamic vinegar.  There needs to be more of it!  I splashed it over the orzo mixture and mixed it in.

Very flavorful.  Used blue cheese instead of feta.  Next time I would double the amount of spinach and reduce the olive oil to about 1/3 cup.

This dish was absolutely delicious! The only modification I made was that I used roasted pepper and garlic feta cheese instead of regular feta. I was amazed with the amount of flavor that was in every bite. Makes a great side or a vegetarian main dish.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I cut down on the olive oil to 1/3 cup and I typically add more pine nuts.  I also grill chicken with a teriyaki marinade and throw it sliced in with the pasta.  My niece and nephew who are notorious picky eaters enjoyed this recipe very much.  I've been asked to make it again.  Thank you for posting this.  Most excellent!

So easy!  I was looking for an easy, light pasta dish with spinach -- I didn't have orzo but just tossed everything with capellini/angel hair, minus pine nuts.  Terrific dinner with chicken tossed on the grill, ready in 10 mins!

Great recipe.  I just went on and added the balsamic to the entire dish and passed the feta and tomatoes for sprinkling.  I served this to my future father-in-law along with the Artichoke Chicken and he loved it.  Will definitely make again.

So delicious and beautiful to look at!  I made this with Salmon Patties III for dinner with friends.  It was a huge hit!  I might use a bit more garlic next time.  I know for the amount of food, we doubled the tomato and chopped a whole one instead of half of one as well.

Excellent recipe.  As others suggested, I cut the oil to a little less than 1/4 cup and added sundried tomatoes.  Everyone raved about it and had seconds and thirds.  I served it with roast chicken and asparagus.  It was all very complimentary.  Thanks so much for posting this wonderful recipe!

Added salt, a squeeze of lemon, and about 6 chopped kalamata olives.  Substituted quartered grape tomatoes for the beefsteak tomato.   Followed other users advice and halved both the butter and oil.  It was still more than plenty!  Very tasty and a great side dish to my hubbs smoked salmon!  Four stars because it would have been bland without the additions.

I made a few minor changes: 1. Cut the orzo in half because there's only two of us. It still made for a lot of pasta though. 2.  Cut down the oil (not necessary) and didn't use butter (health reasons). 3.  Didn't use pine nuts (too expensive) or pepper flakes (toddler can't handle the heat). 4. Put in extra garlic and spinach - I didn't find that either overwhelmed the dish given that I cut down on the orzo.  I served this with a Greek chicken recipe that I found on this site. Not a bad dish but I probably wouldn't make it for dinner again. I would consider making it for a BBQ as a side dish though.

I made 1/2 recipe.  Only thing I would change is to wilt spinach in plain water. The vinegar darkens the spinach.  I added a little salt myself because it will be part of a buffet.

This orzo dish looks fancy and is very easy to make. But, beside the little kick from the red pepper flakes, it was little bland. The only change I made was omitting the butter, just didn't  see any need for it , with that much olive oil..
Next time, I will cook the orzo in some chicken broth, before adding to  the spinach.

This was my first time cooking orzo and I was very pleased.  My only advice is to take it easy on the red pepper, because it will overtake the dish if you are careless.

This is one of the most delicious orzo recipes I've ever made/tasted! Like other people, I would suggest making 1/2 a box of orzo and definitely doubling the spinach! I also toss in 1 whole tomato chopped, instead of 1/2. I really like onions, so I sauté 1/2 a medium onion, chopped with the garlic, basil & crushed red pepper before browning the pine nuts. To make things more spicy, I add 1 tsp of crushed red pepper instead of the 1/2 tsp. Finally, I do without the cheese and it tastes just as yummy!

I have made this twice, and it is really good. I do find that the wilted spinach likes to clump together and is hard to separate when adding to the orzo. I might try cutting up the spinach before or after the cooking stage. Also, I feel the dish may need a little more crunch. The pine nuts add some, but I may try adding cucumber next time.

Although this dish looked "elegant", the taste was just average. I feel like it needs to be seasoned more. If i do make this again i will have to add my own lil touch to it. As written, just ok.

I think I used too many pine nuts and I think I browned them a little to long.  So the dish was a little to pine-nutty.  Also, I didn't have enough spinach...but I will make this again with the correct amount of ingredients because it was still good despite all my little blunders.

My family and coworkers love this recipe. It is such an excellent, easy side dish. The only thing I added was about to Tbs of sun dried tomato pesto to give it a little extra flavor.

I've made this a few times and it is so easy and yummy.  It is still good with less olive oil and/or butter.  The feta and fresh tomatoes on top really make it delicious!

I used less olive oil, 1/2 the pine nuts (because I only bought one bag), 1/2 the crushed red pepper, and twice the balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. My husband ate it without the tomatoes and still gave it rave reviews. I mixed the balsamic vinegar and feta directly in with the spinach/pasta mixture. Fantastic. I'll make this again.

Excellent! I sauteed red peppers with the pine nuts to give it the color boost (since I don't particularly care for tomatoes), and you can add as much spinach as your pan and taste buds will allow (to up the healthiness and color of the dish).

I liked it, a very good light dinner. I only made half the recipe, and used about 8 of the 10 oz of spinach I will use all of it next time. I did not have any balsamic vinegar so I used balsamic vinaigrette instead. I used more tomato then was called for and just stirred it in along with the cheese. This was easy and quick, good for when you don't feel much like cooking.

I thought this was a very good main dish.  My wife is a vegetarian and I am always looking for good dishes.  I thought the fat content was a little high when looking at the facts, but the dish seemed light and fluffy when finished.  I would not skip the vinegar or feta because I think it add great flavor.  Next time I make this dish I might cut the olive oil down a bit and add some red onions.  Overall this was a great find.

We really enjoyed this recipe! We made some slight changes leaving out the tomato and using blue cheese instead of feta cheese. In addition, although I took it out to use it I completely forgot the balsamic vinegar but it tasted great anways! We used much more spinach than stated in the recipe. Will definitely make this again!

A solid recipe.  It was very colorful and the balsamic vinegar and feta cheese are a very nice combination.  I used a 12 oz. bag of baby spinach as others have suggested.  Fresh basil along with the pine nuts which I browned pretty well, gave it great flavor.

This recipe is so good and so easy!  I made it for Mother's Day and my mom loved it.  I made a few changes per other reviews.  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, I boiled my orzo in chicken stock, I used about 1 cup of sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh and added them a few minutes after the pine nuts and I mixed the feta and balsalmic into the whole pot right before serving.  I will make this again and again for sure!

Really great recipe, great way to use the spinach in our garden! My husband loved it. I was out of Feta so just sprinkled with some Mozzerella and Parmesan.  Also sprinkled with pink salt crystals for a little texture. Will use much less oil next time.

Each year at the beach, we take turns making dinner for the house, 9 adults & 7 kids. This year I tried this recipe for my meal, even though I never made it before. I did not use tomatoes, but did every else per the directions, it was wonderful and will be making it many more times. It is great to make the risotto shortly before serving and then tossing everything together just before serving. Since it is great hot or at room temperature it is great for large dinner parties.

Oh my God.  This is SO GOOD!  I was looking for a recipe to use up my leftover orzo and this was it!!!  I used frozen spinach and added some lemon juice and sun-dried tomatoes.  It even tastes good on its own without the balsamic! Thank you!!!

I'm not a big pasta eater, but as a side this was just incredibly good when served with Chicken Piccata II

A hit - thanks for the great recipe.  I added a bit of fresh basil in addition to the dried basil.  And I used a bit less than 1/2 cup olive oil, and I added some leftover grilled chicken breast.

I fell madly in love with pine nuts recently & sought out recipes to use them in. This pasta is so delicious & easy that I haven't even tried the others yet!

Very good.  I had no fresh spinach so I used frozen, thawed and drained.  I also added cooked chicken to make this a main dish.  For a side I served bruschetta.  Awesome meal with a nice glass of white wine.  There are only 2 of us and this recipe makes a lot.  I've frozen the leftovers.  Another yummy meal later in a snap.  Thanks for the recipe.
