Wonderfully different dressing recipe. If you're tired of the same old yogurt, mayo, or whipping cream dressings, you have to try this! Great recipe, Sheila!

Wow!  My tastes must sure be different, because I didn't care for this at all.  All I could taste was vinegary mustard.  I won't be making this again.

This is a wonderful dressing for fruit salad.  A real change from yogert or mayo.  We found it to be delicious.

I have been looking for this receipe for years.  
My dear neighbor used to make it, but I didn't
get her receipe before she passed away.  I knew
the ingrediates but not how to put it together.
THANK YOU, my husband and brother ask for it every
Thanksgiving & Christmas. They always fuss because
I didn't make it more often. Now that I have the
directions again, I WILL!!! THANKS AGAIN!!

I made it and the taste was different and good. The texture was not what I was looking for. If I make it again I will not refrigerate it first and immediately serve it in the salad.

I was so intrigued by the different ingredients in this that I had to give it a try.  It definitely would fall into a "non-traditional" category.  Glad I tried it, and I may make again, but can't say that it's my favorite dressing for fruit salad (DH and I were in agreement on that).
