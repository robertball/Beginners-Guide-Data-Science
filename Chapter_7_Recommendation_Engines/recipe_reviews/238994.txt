We LOVED these! I didn't have any egg substitute, so I just used regular whole eggs (4 eggs are equal to 1 cup egg sub.). Made as written otherwise. So simple and they were perfectly done at the 10 minute mark. The whole family gobbled these up...HUGE hit and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

OMG - who knew eggs and pepperoni could make such a wonderful combination! This was so good and what a great way to liven up scrambled eggs. I used 1/2 cup of egg substitute and 2 whole eggs as egg substitute tends to be a little watery. I fried a little green pepper along with the onion and added a little chopped tomato to get in some extra veggies. I also used minced garlic vs. garlic powder. You could easily but this inside a tortilla for a really awesome breakfast wrap! This recipe is a definite keeper!

Simple but delicious. I needed something quick and didn't want just plain scrambled eggs.
