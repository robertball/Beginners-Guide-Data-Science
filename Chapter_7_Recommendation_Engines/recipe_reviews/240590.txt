I've tried several waffle recipes, and my family just wasn't happy with any of them.  However, this is now our go to recipe.  They are light, fluffy, crispy, and filling.  The one thing we've noticed is that they get soft if you store them overnight after cooling.  However, pop them in the toaster, and they crisp back up and are just as tasty.  5 stars from each of my kids!

The malt is nice to add to the waffle. I also had to add a little more malt for taste and a 1/4 cup of flour to give them a bit more volume. Good, but not stellar.

Tasty and quick waffle. We love malt so next time I will add a couple of more tablespoons malt to bring out that flavor. Thanks so much for sharing.

I've been looking for a simple and tasty way to make waffles at home.  These were good, although not as fluffy as the Meijer brand malted waffle mix.  I admit, though, that I did NOT cook them for five minutes, only until the light on the waffle griddle went out... so that is something to try when I make them again.  I may add some extra flour and malt, as another reviewer mentioned doing.  All in all, a good, easy, recipe.

I cooked it the whole 5 minutes. It made them crispy - just the way that I like them! They are wonderful and my whole family loved them! Good recipe.

Very Nice Recipe but didn't taste the malted milk aspect as much as I hoped to. Would suggest adding an extra tablespoon

We loved them. I doubled the recipe for a NYE family sleepover, added blueberries to half and cooked them in our Belgian waffle iron.  I served them with fruit and pure maple syrup. They were a big hit with all of the children, grown and young.  Thank you.

These are pretty good!  I used heaping tablespoons of malted milk and added two more (for a total of 7).  I am considering adding another the next time I make it, but am unsure.  The malt flavor definitely came through and I don't want to overdo it.  I also subbed 1 tbsp of brown sugar for white sugar, based on some other recipes I read.
