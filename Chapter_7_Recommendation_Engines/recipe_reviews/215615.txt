I actually bought a muddler to make this recipe. This tasted good, but I couldn't really taste the mint at all. It tasted like limeade with a bite.

These are excellent! I do use a LOT more mint since I have a bunch in my garden and we like the mint flavor.

When I can find some dry, old fashioned ginger ale (Jamaican), I substitute it for the soda water.  It gives it some bite.  It changes the taste but its great.

This was VERY refreshing. I made it a little stronger, a little bit more lime juice, but it is the perfect mix to drink cold on a beach.

I never used the mint because I don't like mint in my drinks...  I really liked it and loved knowing what freshness takes like.  I also used organic sugar(all natural).  Probably a little more mixing but no longer use refined sugar, so I was very happy with the results.  I liked how it taste, so I was pleased.  If you like more of a lime taste, I would suggest using a whole lime instead of just 1/2 of a lime.
