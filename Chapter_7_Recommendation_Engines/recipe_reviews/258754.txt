I made some changes: almond butter instead of cashew, powdered ginger instead of fresh, and red pepper flakes instead of Thai chilis. The family liked this. It is a wee bit dry and could probably use a dipping sauce of some sort, but its not necessary. It took a few tries to get the wrapping technique right, but once I figured it out, it wasn't hard. Was kind of fun to make and serve.
