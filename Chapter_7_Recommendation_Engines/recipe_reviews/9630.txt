I can fully assure everybody that they will like it. I'm Egyptian and this is a traditional cookie that we enjoy all year round. Then to my surprise after living 3 years in Scotland and enjoying the yummy Scottish shortbread I discovered that it is the same taste and recipe. It seems that tasty bites has no nationality but humanity!

I have been searching for the recipe to duplicate the cookies of my childhood and this is it!  When we used to visit relatives, I would eat tons of these but I never got a recipe.  The look was not 100% the same so I might try to shape them a little differently but the taste is exact! Not only are they delicious, the texture is amazing.  Last but not least, lactose free!

The recipe my mother-in-law, who was from Bethlehem, gave me was far different than this one.  Her recipe is light, flaky, & full of flavor.  There is no way you could frost this cookie.  It's my favorite Arabic pastry, & if made right, they almost melt in your mouth and coat your fingers.  There isn't any semolina in her recipe, that would make the cookie heavy.

I just made this recipe, which is actually from Paula Wolfert's fabulous "Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean" cookbook. Shame on the original poster--you Grethel--for apparently lifting the recipe and headnote verbatim from Paula's cookbook without attribution. That's very bad food karma. Paula's a legend in the cookbook world.

Quite tasty!  The orange blossom flavor is nice and delicate, but the dough was very crumbly and hard to work with.  I made some of mine with pistachios instead of almonds--tasted pretty good that way.
