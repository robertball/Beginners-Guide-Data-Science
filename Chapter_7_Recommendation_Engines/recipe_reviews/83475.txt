I personally love this!  I added a bit more curry to it - cos I enjoy the flavour.  

Another great salad is the broccoli raisin salad, try that too!

Very easy and very delicious.  I followed recipe exactly. Textures work well together. Leftovers were great.  I will make this again and again.

I used a reg. size bag of pre shredded cabbage for slaw, a 16 oz bag of petite peas and 3/4 c of chopped pecans and left the dressing amount the same and really liked it.

I love this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe states but used the packaged broccoli slaw because that was all the store had at the time.  This is just a fantastic recipe and easy. Thanks.

I made this recipe for a pot luck and everyone loved it. Some people even ate it without the dressing and still loved it.

Seems too easy to be good, but it was fantastic!
Because I had a Sweet Curry powder, almost doubled the amount, and it was a good thing.

I also used more cabbage than required, so the dressing was a very light coating.  The result was much more light and crispy than I normally associate with slaw.

Wow, thanks for this great recipe!  The contrast of textures and the mixture of flavors was fantastic!  The only thing I changed was that I made a little more of the dressing mixture than the recipe called for, because it looked a little dry.  I will definitely make this again, we had it with spicy pulled pork sandwiches and it was awesome!

I make this recipe again and again, and my family loves it.  I prefer it with Savoy cabbage, but packaged slaw mix works too.
