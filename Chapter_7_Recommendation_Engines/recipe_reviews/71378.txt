My husband and I loved this recipe!  I hate to be that annoying I-changed-everything-in-the-recipe person - but I did make a few changes.  To the bread crumb/ranch mixture I added coarse ground pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (my husband is Cajun and loves hot food).  We aren't fans of frying so we baked ours on 375 for 25-30 minutes.  Will definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation.

This recipe was fantastic!  I took the advice of a few others and changed it a little bit though.  I dredged the fish in flour, then egg whites, then the breading mixture (bread crumbs & ranch mix only).  And instead of frying it, I sprayed a baking dish with Pam and baked it.  It turned out wonderfully.  My boyfriend even rated it top 5 meals I've ever made!

This was SOOO GOOD!  And very easy and quick to make!  The only thing I did differently was to bake it instead of frying. I baked at 400 for 25 minutes.  The edges were a little too done so next time I'll only cook it for about 20 minutes.  Oh and don't forget to coat your baking dish or it will stick. :)  Definitely a keeper!

You know, we liked these, but I can't give them five stars.  I used about 3/4 of the ranch dressing package, and it was pretty strong; I was using flounder, which is maybe the mildest fish in the entire world, so that might have contributed, but I couldn't imagine using the whole package.  I like the ranch breading idea, but I think next time I might try a different method - maybe people who are dredging the fish in milk first have the right idea.  My oil-and-dressing mix never came close to anything like a "paste" (again, I didn't use the whole packet) and I didn't have enough for all of my fish.  Anyway, though, good flavor - particularly for people who don't like fish.  I baked at 375 for 10 minutes.  Edit:  I tried it again with tilapia, baked at 375 for 10 minutes.  This time I mixed the dressing mix with the breadcrumbs and lightly brushed the filets with olive oil - delicious!  Just the right amount of tang.  I'm upping my review to 5 stars.  Thanks!  EDIT AGAIN:  just printed out a copy of this to give to somebody else, and realized that I don't actually follow this recipe at all.  My version is 5 stars, but I'm sending this one back to 4.

I just tried this recipe as a quick dinner tonight. I was alarmed at the sodium level, so I altered the recipe a bit. I used 1 cup of finely crushed corn flake cereal instead of seasoned bread crumbs. Instead of making a paste, I did a flour and egg wash prior to dipping in the corn flake/ranch mix, then I baked at 425 for about 20 minutes until crunchy. The kids liked this "good crunchy" fish. Overall, I'd make this again.

Unlike other reviewers, my breaded fillets were not at all crunchy. We also found it much too salty. We ended up scraping quite a lot of the breading off which was a shame as the first few bites were great. Thanks anyway.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but after reading most of the reviews, I will use low fat buttermilk instead of egg or oil. Not only will it enhance the ranch dressing it will be lower in fat. I know w/o trying this will be an excellent fish recipe. If I change my mind I will retract my review. I always use b'milk instead of egg for my recipes. I don't like the egg taste on my chicken or fish.

The first time we had this type of fish, my hubby destroyed it. So I was scared to try it again but we have soo much of it. I decided to try something myself. I found this recipe and it was great. I baked it instead of frying. I baked it at 425 for 20 minutes. Flipping it over and baking 20 more minutes. it was  GREAT, everyone loved this fish.

Pretty good!  I used a few changes as per some other reviews - dredged in flour, then dipped in egg, and then into the breadcrumb/ranch dressing mix mixture, and then fried in olive oil just because it was quickest.  Next time I'll try baking it in the oven.  We didn't find it overly salty, and my husband is usually very salt sensitive.

I made this recipe exactly as written here.  While the taste was excellent, I found the breading to be flaky, and it basically fell off of the fish as I cooked it.  Next time, I may try to flour the fish, or bake it instead of using a skillet.  I will make it again, though!  I wouldn't change the flavor at all!

Very good WITH one modification---go EASY on the ranch! That stuff is super-salty and can ruin the dish if you aren't careful. 1/2 of the package is plenty of ranch for 4 people.

My family does not eat fish on a normal basis, but I decided to try this out during lent.  I baked it on 375 for about 25-30 minutes and ended up having rave reviews.  I now alternate between baking and frying...either way it is highly requested year-round by my husband and even my in-laws!

This had a good flavor, but I think a whole package of the dressing mix was a bit much for just two pieces of fish.

This recipe was okay. I baked the fish instead of frying it, but my husband and I both thought that it was very salty. Probably won't make it again, but it was okay for something different.

I liked the concept of this recipe, but wasn't completely sold on the recipe as is... so I made a few changes to suit my tastes.  First and foremost, I highly recommend soaking the fillets in a shallow dish of milk for 20 minutes.  (If your fillets are fresh and not frozen, do so in the fridge).  This will eliminate the dreaded fishy taste that Tilapia especially tends to have.  I opted to bake mine, so I preheated the oven to 425.  I too decided to just mix the bread crumbs and ranch seasoning together, as well as some parmesan cheese and a dash of dried dill.  It seemed a bit excessive to use the entire packet of ranch seasoning, so i just sprinkled it liberally over my bread crumbs until it just looked like the right amount.   I had plenty of seasoning left over.  After removing the fillets from the milk, i gave them an egg wash, and then dredged them into the breading mixture.   I baked them for 20 or 25 minutes on a lightly greased baking sheet, flipping half way through.  They cooked beautifully this way and had a nice crispy crust (without all of the extra calories of frying), and the flavor was good.  I couldn't taste the dill that I had added, but I would imagine that a bit of fresh dill could have done the trick... or it could be used in mayonaise with some lemon for a dipping sauce or to spread on bread for a fish sandwich.  As is, I would rate this recipe with 3 1/2 stars.

OMG this is the absolute best tilapia recipe I have ever tried!! I see alot of ppl saying it was too salty but Im going to have to disagree with those ppl who are obviously not wearing they're reading glasses when measuring. Oh and ppl saying there is too much of a fishy taste well you are dealing with fish duh and the recipe says nothing about there not being a fishy taste however you can soak the fish in salt water and the taste will vanish. Loved it!!

So, I changed basically everything about this recipe, but we love it. I mix half cheese crackers, half saltines with the ranch seasoning and coat the fish with the dry mix. It is crunchy and delicious!

Great!  Though we used milk instead of egg and just mixed the ranch with panko breadcrumbs.

This was some of the best fish I've had!  I did make some changes, but only because it's what I had on hand.  I left out the oil and butter because I baked the fish at 400 for about 20 minutes flipping it half way through.  I soaked my fish (tilapia) in milk for about 10-15 minutes, dipped them in Kraft Ranch salad dressing, then breaded them with the seasoned bread crumbs.  I sprayed my pan with nonstick spray so it wouldn't stick.  It came out wonderfully.  My husband rated it a 9 out of 10!  I will definitely be making this again, thank you for sharing.

I always make the recipe exactly as is the first time. With some tweaking, this will be five stars!  As it is good but it can get better.  The ranch paste is too concentrated and will be better if the dressing is mixed in the bread crumbs.   Also the coating did not stick and fell apart a bit in the pan.  Because of this, it does need some type of milk mixture to make it stick.  I liked pan sautéing the fish as I have a bad lick with timing when I bake fish.  I feel like I get it to a perfect doneness in the pan but not in the oven.  Because of the oil in the paste, it needs little butter in the pan.

The whole family loved this recipe. I changed it just a bit. I dredged it in egg first, then coated it in the combined bread crumbs and ranch seasoning mix.  Will definitely keep this one! A great way to get the family to eat more fish.

Didn't mess with eggs/milk as others suggested. (That takes the "simple" out of this recipe ;). I didn't have the Italian bread crumbs, so I used plain Planko bread crumbs and tossed in a little oregano, basil, rosemary and cajun seasoning...just a couple shakes of each...very forgiving).  Very good, very easy.  Will do again!

good but very salty. This is most likely my fault as they were out of the ranch dressing packets and so I had to use a ranch DIP packet. Will try again with a dressing packet.

I have made this a couple times now, once with crushed Ritz crackers and once with breadcrumbs.  I like it with the Ritz better, but it's great either way.  I dredge my fish in buttermilk and then dip in the breadcrumb/ranch mix, so no paste mixture for me.  I also bake at 400 for about 20 minutes.  My son, who "hates" fish will eat these if I cut them in strips and call them fish sticks!  Nice!

I've been making this for the last year and a half - probably at least ten times.  At first I followed the directions exactly, but they were a bit greasy, although very tasty.  I've experimented with different reviewers tips and tonight it was delicious perfection!  Mix about 3/4 of the ranch packet with the bread crumbs.  Dip the fish in a bit of whisked egg, then into the bread crumbs.  I did exactly 5 minutes on each side and it was perfect - the best texture it ever had.

I mixed the dry ranch dressing with about 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil, making a dip versus a paste; then dipped the fish (4 pieces of Tilapia) in the oil and rolled in the Italian bread crumbs.  I baked the fish at 375 for 20 minutes and broiled on high for 2 - 3 minutes to get a crisy coating.  Turned our absolutely wonderful!

OMG! I loved this fish! So did my family. It has a taste sorta like fish sticks. VERY kid friendly and good if you want something that tastes like its bad for you. I added the ranch to whole wheat bread crumbs with a lil Tony's, spread some mayo on the fish and dipped in the bread crumbs and cooked on a cookie sheet greased with butter. I am sure the origianal way will be just as good. Will make again often.

This was super easy! Which I love, but the flavor was a little off. The ranch was overpowering. I might try this again using less Ranch and maybe adding some garlic.

you need to flour the filets first before you coat them, so the egg mixture can stick. Pretty good, very easy weeknight meal.

This recipe is wonderful!!!  Keep in mind it is for FRIED fish - you can use olive or canola oil to keep the calorie/fat count down if you like.  Otherwise, it is perfect AS IS.   The ingredients are just right for 4 small to medium tilapia fillets.  The fillets were moist and tasty.  I'd highly recommend this recipe.  (You could bake it, but I would still drizzle a little oil on both sides of the fish after breading to give a nice crunch.)

Great flavor, but I mix the ranch seasoning with the breadcrumbs instead of making a paste which I found was hard to work with, and flavored the fish unevenly.  I coated the fish with the crumb mixture and just frying it in the oil over medium heat.  No extra oil needed.

Thumbs up from all my family! I made one change -- didn't have any ranch mix so I coated the fish in bottled ranch dressing then dredged them in the italian bread crumbs. Came out perfectly!

I made these the other night and my family loved it.  I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable oil to mix with the Ranch.  I used the whole 1oz packet of ranch mix and it was just enough paste for 3 nice sized Talipia filets.  The only other tweak I made was to mix Panko with the Italian bread crumbs.  I decided to treat my family and actually fried the filets.  I am definitely making this again, but will bake if it becomes a more frequent meal.  Thank-you for the recipe!

This was easy.  I made it as written.  Next time I will use 1/2 of the Ranch dressing mix.  Everyone agreed it was "okay" and a do again, but nothing to rave about.  I will probably play with spices and incorporate other reviewers suggestion and I will bake rather than fry it.

I baked the fish at 375 for about 30 minutes (I prefer baking over frying).  I also listened to other reviewers' advice and cut out some of the dressing mix. I don't what happened, but my fish turned out to be a little too breaded- and somehow I still had a lot of the breading mix left over.  Because I realized I was going to have a breading issue after the fish were already in the oven, so I whipped up a little sauce in hopes of covering up some of the breading taste.  I used a little butter, lime juice, white wine, and minced garlic and let it boil down.  While the fish was pretty tasty (sans my breading error) on its own, the sauce made it so much tastier!

Great flavor - I use Swai Fish, added some grated parm cheese in to the breading mix and also baked, per some other suggestions.  Was a tad salty but still good.  Served over cous cous and with a side of mixed veggies!

I followed the recipe exactly and it is good as is.  I do agree with all the other reviewers who said it is VERY salty, the coating does not adhere very well, and there was a fishy taste to these.  I will try the flour, egg, panko version next time.  I have read that you can soak your fish in milk to remove the fishy taste, but I've never tried it.

I personally found the ranch part a bit overpowering, but my husband liked it a lot.  I might try a bit less ranch next time and add more red pepper for him.

I'm watching my weight and so i decided to bake it and it turned out very plain. maybe cooking it over skillet would have been better but it doesn't seem as healthy.

We really enjoyed this made with Red Snapper since that's what we had at home. Of course I made a few changes...first off after reading other reviews I decided to half the ranch packet, I also decided to not try to make a paste so I mixed the dry ranch into the breadcrumbs and added some parmesan cheese to this also.  I used a wet mixture of butter and milk with egg to dredge the fish in then coated with the breadcrumb mixture.  Then, like other reviewers, I baked this for about 25-35 minutes.  Just make sure to grease your dish or the fish will stick.  My boyfriend loved this and he is not a big fish eater.  I can not imagine using the entire packet of ranch unless you doubled the fish.  Ours was very flavorful with only half a packet...no need to salt this dish!

This was great.  We used Basa fillets and floured and egged the fish before putting in the bread crumb and seasoning mix.  Baked at 400 for 20 minutes.

Delicious. I took the suggestion of other reviewers...used flour and egg wash and then put fish in the mixture of breading, ranch, and red pepper flakes.  This dish is definately going in the rotation.

Just got done eating this and had to write a review.  My wife, daughter, and I loved it.  (daughter doesnt even like fish)  Prepared it as directed.  The only thing I would do differently is lightly flour the fish before dipping into the oil mixture.  The breading didn't stick as well to the fish as I would have liked.  I think next time I might try this with chicken breast.

I loved the concept of this recipe, but took the advice of others and simply coated the talapia in flour, egg, then the bread crumbs and ranch seasoning mix.  Then 'fried' the talapia in a about a 1/2 tbsp of butter per filet.  Excellent flavor and texture, definitely a repeat for me and my husband.  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

I made this tilapia recipe tonight and my husband, who is not a big fish fan, loved it.  The only variation I made in the recipe was not to use a pre-made ranch dressing packet.  I found a ranch dressing recipe on allrecipes and mixed the dry ingredients only. I made the paste using the entire ranch dressing mixture with the the same amount of oil that is in tilapia recipe. Very flavorful!!

Great flavor, can taste the ranch mix, though my kids all thought it tasted like sour cream & onion potato chips--didn't tell them otherwise because they HATE ranch!  My husband doesn't like fish & I've been searching for fish recipes that he'll eat.  This is only the 2nd recipe I've found that was successful with not only my husband, but the kids as well!  Great!

Excellent. I altered the recipe only by using frozen fillets (unthawed)and baking them for 20 minutes at 425. The fish turned out excellent, my husband loved it, my picky kid ate it and asked for seconds. I did not find it too salty. We will be adding this to our regular rotation

Not the best recipe I have tried for talapia....maybe it was the ranch seasoning...the fish tasted, well, sour.  My kids who love fish did not like this one.

I stuck to the spirit of the recipe, but did change around a few things. First I dipped the fish in an egg wash, then I dredged it in the mixture of crumbs and dry ranch mix - I didn't make the paste or use the oil. I baked the fish instead of pan frying it. I thought it tasted pretty good. Was a different but yummy flavor to the fish.

I'm not sure what it is about the ranch (I'm assuming it's the ranch), but it makes this meal taste like summer to me. Would be amazing for a nice summer night with a glass of wine and some good friends.

Soo easy and soo good!  I used cornmeal instead of italian bread drumbs.  Topped it off with tartar sauce. The ranch flavor gave it just the right amount of kick...Definitely a keeper :)

Used panko bread crumbs to which I added Italian herbs. Following other's suggestions, I used only 1/2 package of the ranch dressing mix. Baked instead of fried. It was OK.

I am not a big fish fan, but I had some tiliapia fillets I needed to use and wanted a recipe to help mask the fishy taste.  This somewhat did the job, but then again, I did things a little differently than directed.  I dredged the fillets in flour, then in egg and then covered them with the ranch/bread crumb mixture.  I sprayed a baking pan with Pam and threw them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes, flipping them over halfway through.  They came out crispy and golden.  I thought the taste was good, but I needed some tartar sauce to go along with it.  I will more than likely make this again when I have tilapia on hand.

This was great and really quick to cook. Small amount of ingredients was great.  No salt needs to be added because you get that from the butter.....I LOVE IT!

This was ok. I used half a pack of ranch & it tasted a bit salty...also, it tasted like there was something missing but not sure what. I don't think I'll be making this dish again...

Great.  Dipped in milk; didn't work.  Dipped in egg; worked great.  Used 1/2 packet of ranch.  Could have used a touch more flavor.

It tasted a bit too fishy for me, but my husband didn't think it was too bad.  We both agreed though that there are better tilapia recipes on this website.

My husband and I were not fish people, but we started out making this recipe and boy did we love it.  We have made it at least five or six times in the last two months.  As per other reviews, I think I am going to try to bake it.  Wonderful receipe.

This was pretty good.  I liked the tang from the ranch dressing mix.  To save a few calories, I baked these at 375 for 15 minutes.

This recipe is very tasty, which is difficult to achieve, in my opinion, when it comes to Tilapia. I had trouble with the "paste" though, in that the Ranch power congealed and clumped up very quickly. I had to clump it onto the fish which over-killed the flavor so much that I had to scrape some of the breading off when I ate it. I thought the Ranch dressing would add a subtle flavor, but I was wrong... it really adds a LOT of flavor, so it's best not to cover the fish with it too much before adding the breadcrumbs.

We HATE fish....I FORCE myself to eat it when we go out every now and then, but have to smother it in tarter sauce and chase it with another bite of a side.  But after reading the NUMEROUS reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot!  Fish is such a healthy choice and I want to do my best for my family.  Well, I was PLEASANTLY surprised!  I purchased 2 lbs of talapia to feed our family of 2 adults & 2 children.  Plenty, right?  NOT!  All of us kept going back for more until it was completely gone!!!  I'm serious!  It is AWESOME!!!  Thank you SOOOO much for sharing and I will use this every single time I make fish (which has already been requested for tomorrow!  haha!)  I crushed garlic & butter flavored croutons in a ziplock, dumped them into a shallow dish along with the packet of ranch and a very small amount of fresh dill.  Rubbed fish with olive oil, placed filet on cookie sheet with olive oil and baked on 375 for 20 minutes (turning once 1/2 way thru)  TRY THIS RECIPE!  You will NOT be disappointed!!!

I used fillet of sole. Lined a pan with foil, sprayed the foil with Pam and put a little butter on the foil and put it in the oven to melt while the oven was preheating to 375 degrees. Baked for 25 minutes. This was great. Definitely a keeper.

This was quite good.  I used it as a base recipe and oven fried walleye filets.  I dipped the filets in buttermilk instead of oil and dredged them in the bread crumb/ranch mixture (I added a little grated parmesan cheese too)  I am sure I will make this again, and pretty tasty crispy way to make fish!

Both of my daughters ate this, so this gets 5 stars from me!!!! I haven't had much luck with coating anything in bread crumbs so I decided to try panko bread crumbs and it was great!! I didn't have a dry ranch dressing packet so I used the recipe on this site for the dry ranch dressing and that worked out great. I coated my fish in melted butter then the panko bread crumbs with the ranch seasoning mixed in. Then pan fried them in olive oil... Very good will make again. Oh I cut the kids into strips before coating and they liked them like that, they thought they were fish sticks!!

Yum!  I've tried other tilapia recipes, and this is by far the best.  I mixed the ranch and bread crumbs together first.  Then I brushed the fish with olive oil and dipped them in the bread crumb mixture.  Baked them for 10 minutes at 375 degrees and they came out perfect.  Next time I will make a little tartar sauce to dip them in.  So easy and very good.

I used fat free Ranch dressing mixed with water to wet the fish then mixed 1/4 cup parmesan cheese with 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs seasoned with lemon pepper and garlic powder. Baked 425 for 16 minutes, turned over after 8 minutes. Very good even my fish hating son said he would eat again.

I used other reviews' advice, and dredged in flour and egg, and then a mix of ranch and bread crumbs.  Baked for 14 min at 425, turning once.  I am not the best at frying fish.  So good, and my kids, ages 8, 4 and 2, LOVED it.  That says a lot!  I think that next time, I may try melting shredded cheese on top at the end of the baking.  This is a keeper!

This dish was very tasty. The only thing I would do differently next time is use thinner filets. Mine were thick (closer to a steak than a filet), and the flavor was much better on the thinner pieces.

I tried this as the recipe stated the first time and felt it needed some improvement. After ready the reviews of others, I chose to dredge the fillets in flour and egg first. I also mixed the Italian breadcrumbs with two Ranch packets in one bowl, and completely omited the olive oil. This instantly became a 5 star meal that everyone enjoyed.

This dish was very good.  I took the suggestion from an other review and used Cod instead of Talapia.  I liked the tangy bite that the dressing gave the dish.  I will fix this one again.

Salt and pepper before breading is definetly necessary, but otherwise this is a decent recipe. The ease of prep and the fact you can get it to the table in about 15 minutes is great. Plus, you can get everything you need for under $10 (at least where I'm at). What more could you ask for?

This recipe was great and really easy! I changed it only slightly by dipping the tilapia in egg white and then dredging in the italian seasoning and ranch mix.  I then placed in frying pan with a tablespoon of olive oil.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten.  I thought I had taken out tilapia but it was cod.  It still tasted awesome.  I used it with a fish taco recipe from this site.  Very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very easy although I changed it some.  I dipped the filets in ranch salad dressing and then coated them with Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I then pan fried the fish in a little butter.  The taste was excellent!  Thanks for the idea of using ranch dressing.  We will definitely make this again.

We liked this recipe. I gave it a 4 only because I altered the recipe. Instead of making the paste I added the ranch dressing (buttermilk flavored)to plan bread crumbs dredged the fish in egg then fried in olive oil. Used pollack as the fish will try with chicken breast. Thanks for the recipe

the ranch flavor was WAY to strong and salty and the bread crumbs didn't stay on very well and just went soggy, not crunchy at all. it did give it good flavor as long as you scrapped off the outer part and only ate the fish.

I made this by the recipe and it was so-so, not bad but would take some tweakimg. The paste did turn out perfect and I had the perfect amount for two pieces of fish (talapia).  I also had a little bit of breading fall off when I flipped them so to recover I left them ugly side down when I served.  Then while the pan was still hot I quickly tossed in some purple cabbage, corn and garlic in the pan, the breading left in the pan made a perfect light pairing seasoning.  I served the fish over the cabbage which made for very pretty presentation.  Next time I'd use less ranch seasoning and probably just come up with my own seasoning medley but this was a great place to start!

A whole package of dry ranch dressing is too much for only 3/4 cup breading it made the fish way too salty. My son, myself and hubby had to scrape off most of the seasoning. When frying the fish I had a hard time keeping the coating on the fish. It would be a good recipe if you cut down on the ranch dressing or add quite a few more bread crumbs.

We liked the flavor of this, but the breading didn't stay on while pan frying. Should have baked them or added an egg to the breading process.

This was something new and my family liked it. I did as well but it came out a little mushy in some parts. I followed the recipe for the most part. These are the changes I made: preseasoned the fish with garlic, peppers, sea salt, pepper, and parsley that morning. After work I them dipped the fish (whiteys) in the ranch then the bread crumbs. For me when I mixed the two at first it became a clumpy mess and didn't stick to the fish. I left it in the preheated oven for 30 min on 420. I paired this with brown rice and beans with string beans. **i think next time I will just use ranch dressing bc I didn't use all of the ranch mix and ended up throwing but out, which was a waste to me.

This was a big hit that gave the fish just a hint of ranch.  I'll definitely be making this again.  

A small heads up, add the oil a little at a time to the ranch dressing.  It didn't so much make a paste for me as it did a thick ranch wash, but it still worked out very, very well!

I generally followed the consensus on this recipe by dredging the fish fillets in flour, dipping in egg white, then in (plain) breadcrumbs with Ranch powder and baking at 425 for 20 minutes. Not bad, but it's not a recipe I'll be making a point of doing again.

Good idea, but the ranch dressing mix makes the flavor WAY too strong for fish.  We ended up scraping the breading off.  I would suggest using either the ranch mix or the flavored bread crumbs, not both.

I made this exactly as instructed for myself and my fish-hating fiance.  I called them "grown up fish sticks" so he was willing to give it a try.  This is the first fish recipe he's ever called "really good".

Simple, fantastic recipe.  Perfect for a weeknight meal!  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but the oil/ranch mixture didn't coat the fish very well. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and baked instead of pan fried.

Baked it instead of frying it.  Coated as instructed then put in a baking dish and sprinkled with Panko bread crumbs and paprika.  Baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  Excellent.

I dipped my fish in milk then in the ranch/bread crumb mix. My husband (who isn't a huge fish fan) said I could make it this way again. That's a winner in my book! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't follow the recipe 100%.

This is one of the best recipe's!! I had a problem though with not having enough of the paste for all of the fish. One thing that helps is to not use really cold fish. If the fish is cold, as you dip the fish in the paste, the paste becomes very thick and lumpy, is hard to spread on the fish and you end  up not having enough for all of the fish.  I ended up making a second bowl of paste to finish the job. Very tasty!!

I tried this dish the other night.  This dish was very salty.  I think the concept is good, it just needs tweeking.  I had 6 flounder fillets and I did not have enough coating to cover them all.  Next time I will use 1 cup Italian Panko bread crumbs and 1/2 package of dressing mix.  I also used 1 egg to coat the fish in.  Baked in oven at 375 degrees for 25 mins.  I may add Parmesan cheese to add to the flavor when I make again.

I really liked this recipe, though I took other reviewer's advice to go easy on the ranch mix.  I used about half the required amount, but next time I would use the full amount to give it more flavor.  It was nicely crispy and quick to get on the table.

Quick and flavorful way to fix tilapia! I mixed the bread crumbs and dry ranch in one bowl. Then I dipped the tilapia in egg and dredged in the bread crumbs mix. I omitted the oil. Also baked the fish. I'll have to try cooking this in the skillet, as it was not perfectly crisp from the oven.

This was such an easy dish to prepare (it is in a warm oven waiting for hubby to get home... but I sampled it first so I ran to the computer to compose my thoughts!) I can understand how some people have concerns about the salty taste... if you look @ the back of Italian seasoned bread crumbs (at least my brand), salt is the #4 ingredient!!  I accidentally headed off that problem because I reduced the crumbs by 1/2 to control for the carbs.  I also used unsalted butter.  Everything turned out fine, particularly the last piece I cooked... I think I overcrowded the pan with the first batch and the breading came out a little patchy.  The last piece, 100% success!  Using a non-stick skillet really helped... and using a spatula to flip the fish...just plopped the fish in the pan and let it sit there for 5 minutes & then flipped it. I just need to ask Santa for a larger non-stick pan for Christmas.  Thank you for sharing... my family is going to love this!

My boyfriend LOVED this! I did use Dill powder instead of ranch because that's all my grocery store had and it was so good. The flavor didn't overpower the fish at all. I used Halibut. This will definitely become a regular at our house! Thanks!

Great dish.  I used other reviewers suggestions and did a flour dip, egg wash, then breaded it with the ranch/bread crumb mix.  Couldn't get it crunchy, but it was still very good and flavorful.

This has a good flavor, but I doubled the ranch paste and it still only coated 4 fillets.

My family loved the taste of this recipe it has great flavor with a few changes, I used olive oil instead of veggie oil, I did not use butter just cooking spray for the pan so the fish didn't stick, and baked it like others suggested at 325 in the oven. The fish came out crispy and they loved it! My son and I like lemon so we put that on at the table in moderation, that made it tangy and very good. Would suggest this to others that love fish.

My 17 month old had two pieces of this fish! I did modify it a bit for what I had on hand. I only had plain bread crumbs so I just mixed the dressing mix into the bread crumbs. I soaked my fish fillets in buttermilk for about 20 minutes and then dredged in the bread crumbs. Then I baked the fish for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I served the fish with rice and veggies, it made for a quick and delicious weeknight meal.

This is a wonderful recipe for families! Try it! My 3 y.o asked for more and my 13 month old ate it up! I did use the bottled Ranch I had on hand and used olive oil instead of butter. It was a quick and tasty meal and I will definitely make it again!

I give this a 5 for the simplicity...but I also put it in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes...I also added some red peppers to the bread crumbs...it tasted so good I didn't even use any sauce with it.

I think this recipe would be better if the ranch and bread crumbs were mixed and u only coated the fish with oil instead of trying to use the paste.  When I made it the paste was too thick and the flavor of the ranch was way to strong when cooked.  I will try it again and see if I can tame the flavor a little.

This was very good. And the family loved it.  It was a little salty for my taste, I will use less of the ranch mix the next time.  My children who are not very good eaters even ate this one right up.  Made with a side of rice and side salad.  Yuummm!

This was pretty good, especially considering how simple it was! I decided to bake the fillets instead of frying the to save a few calories. I baked at 375 for about 25 minutes, then broiled for a few minutes. Crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Thanks :)

This is EZ and have ingredients on hand.  That's what made me try it in the first place.  My husband and I love this recipe.  First time cooking it, I followed others advise and used olive oil and baked it - turned out GREAT!  The 2nd time I added a little crushed red pepper for that added zing and hubby loved it even more!!  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!!!

I thought the premise of this dish was awesome.  Sounded delicious- here was my mistake- I baked it instead of frying and I think I lost a lot of flavor that way.  I'll make it again and hope for better results in the frying pan. (rated it 3)

******Okay- here is the NEW and improved version- that is a 5!
used more ranch powder about 2 1/2 TBLS.  Omitted butter and added about 2 Tbls more olive oil- sprinkled lemon juice all over the bread crumbs.  Broiled the fillets in baking dish for about 6 minutes unil crisp- THE BEST fish- SO good!

This recipe is very tasty.  Really dresses up any boring white fish.  It even makes it tasty enough for my 1- and 3-year old to eat fish with no complaints.  The only thing I changed was I added a little more oil to the seasoning mixture.  Otherwise, it's a little too salty and doesn't go as far.  We'll make this one again and again!

I made this fish last night following recipe exactly (the only minor change I made was to add some olive oil to the butter so that it wouldn't burn).  The end result was pretty tasty, but both my DH and I found that the ranch seasoning really over-powered the flavour of the fish.  So if you're looking to actually taste the fish you're eating - this recipe probably isn't for you.

This is a great ,  quick and impressive
fish dish!!!!!   I used panko and mixed the ranch packet together. I dredged the fish in four then egg wash then the ranch mix. Sprayed the baking dish with non-stick spray...baked at 425* for 14 mins. Flipping once...so good!!!!!!

Yum... I really liked the flavor of this fish... I made a couple of little changes. 1. I used Cod instead of tilapia; 2. I didnt use the whole packet of ranch - I reserved a little bit and sprinkled it over some sauted asparagus.  It went great with the fish!

With the exception of modifying the spices to suit our taste, this coating is one that I have been using for years to coat chicken with prior to cooking in a covered dish in the microwave. It makes any meat coated in it super moist.
I had used it on fish before but we loved it. A great way to cut back on the fried foods and bake instead. Thanks for the recipe.

This was SOOOOO good!! I can't believe how easy it was, by far the quickest meal I have made in a long time. Great family meal to make after work. Even my 2 year old, who is not a big fish eater, gobbled it up. The only change I will make next time is try to find low sodium ranch as it was just a little salty for my taste.

It had too much of a fishy taste. I couldn't even finish it. But I don't think that is the recipes fault. Im sure that if I did this on another type of fish or chicken or something it would be good.

This was really good! I usually like to see how stuff tastes the next day as leftovers but, there were none with this. I do wish there was a way to cut down on the salty taste but, it did not ruin the dish for us. Will make again and try it baked next time (just to see)!!!

This was good.  Tilapia is such a fragile fillet I had trouble keeping it in one piece.  I substituted Panko for the Italian bread crumbs which gave it a nice crunch.

The ranch really gives this recipe good flavor, and the bread crumbs give just the right amount of crust. It's the only fish recipe I've found that I love since I've moved away from the coast.

It livened up the tilapia a bit, but it's definitely not a favorite.  Perhaps with a different type of fish?

This was so good - crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside.  About the only thing I am going to do next time is use unsalted butter and plain breadcrumbs.

My BF had a bad experience with Tilapia. So I had to make it secretly with this recipe and he loved it. When I told him what it was he was shocked. He loved it and asked for seconds!  I, too, thought this was delish!  It is a must try, I think kids will enjoy it too.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but it just didn't turn out well.  Maybe my heat was too high, or my filets were too thick.  The parts that were not overdone tasted pretty good, though.

My husband actually picked and made this recipe (a rare occasion in our house) and we both loved it!  He said it was so fast and easy to make.  We will definitely be making this again along with the parmesan tilapia also on this sight, they are our 2 favorite fish recipes now!  Oh and to the person that gave this 1 star because she didn't want to eat green fish...I would suggest not using your ranch dressing if it's green...just a thought.

What a great new way to make tilapia!! It tastes fresh and light, even though my fish were frozen and the spices are dried. It also feels indulgent, even though it's not too unhealthy.

This was very good.  I would suggest that instead of adding ranch dressing, double the amount of ranch dressing powder mix (use 2 envelopes instead of 1) and add a bit more oil to the "paste".  Also this cooks VERY quickly so keep an eye on it.

Very quick & tasty.   I agree with others that it was a bit salty, luckly we had egg noodles with butter and that helped cut down on the salt. I will make this again.

Tasty!  The flavor was a big hit but it was a little salty.  If they in fact make a low sodium ranch mix, I would definitely use that.  I used a bit more butter than the recipe called for and a let the breading sit on the fish for twenty minutes or so before cooking.

Excellent!  We've tried a few different recipes for tilapia and so far this is the best.  The longer you leave them in the pan, the crispier they get.  We loved every bite and fought over the last piece!

The store was out of Talapia and cat fish so I used red snapper.  You definitely have to use a non stick pan or it gets a little messy.  We enjoyed the flavor but my son didn't care for it.

We loved this one.  Even my 2 year old mooched for more.  I used crushed black pepper and parmesan croutons instead of italian breadcrumbs (a staple bread crumb switch). Will definately "DO OVER".

Very tasty but between the oil in the batter and the oil to fry it in, it may have  been a bit too oily. I will make this again and just cut down on the oil. Again it was still quite tasty!!!

I followed this recipe precisely and it was delicious! Even though the recipe calls for only five minutes each side, I recommend keeping it on for an additional 2 minutes and it creates a wonderful crusty coating.

I admit I changed this to just taking ranch dressing and mixing in some Italian breadcrumbs, but it was still pretty good.  I totally eyeballed amounts, but next time I will make sure to put a slight layer on the bottom in addition to spreading over the top of the fish.  Baked it at 400 for about 15ish minutes.

I was hesitant about this one...the word "ranchy" just sounded gross but it was really good!  made it per recipe and will make it again I used seasoned panko bread crumbs.

Made it! Took ideas  from others and baked the fish. I mixed the dressing with panko and bread crumbs and baked on a sheet that has holes so fish was crispy.

SO GOOD!  I was looking for a simple fish dish and this one was great.  My 4 year old, who we normally chase around the house for an hour trying to get him to eat dinner, said no less than 20 times how much he LOVED this fish!!  My picky husband loved it, too.  SO GOOD and easy!!

This dish was really good, so good that my 4 year old actually ate his fish before any thing else. My only complaint was that it is actually too salty for my taste. I will of course make it again since it was such a huge hit with my son, but I may make a few changes.

We didn't have a problem with the breading. That seemed to stay on pretty well, but the ranch was overpowering. Next time we would use half of the packet instead. Looking forward to trying it coated with flour, then egg and bread crumbs/ranch mix. Also, seems interesting to try coating it in ranch dressing and then bread crumbs. Oh the possibilities!!

Awesome. Made with flounder instead and omitted butter. I baked in oven at 375 for 30 mins. My 3 yr old thought it was chicken and my husband who hates fish ate 4 pieces. "4" AMAZING

I thought this recipe was good, but not exceptional, but my kids really loved it! They are picky eaters so I was surprised that both requested seconds. For the ease of preparation and kid friendliness I'll give it 5 stars. :)

Whenever a recipe calls for italian bread crumbs, I use italian panko or plain crumbs and season it up.  I love the crunchiness and lighter taste of it.  I will use it on halibut or sea bass.  After breading it I spray some olive oil Pam on it which gives it a nice brown crust and bake it in the oven.  If you're a fan of pistachios, that makes a delicious coating on fish as well.

This fish came out really great.  Added about 1T of buttermilk to the ranch mix and cut back on the oil a little, since it seemed like it was just getting too greasy/oily.  Used plain bread crumbs and butter/olive oil for frying.  Delicious.

This was so delicous, and so easy, a perfect weeknight dinner.  I used Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) instead because I love the crunchiness of them.  I followed others advice and dredged in flour, then dipped in egg, then coated with the breadcrumb/ranch mixtures.  Perfection! And I even used this on some thin sliced chicken, which was delicious.

Very Easy to make and Quick. I think I coated to much with the ranch paste. A little too much ranch for me.  I'll be more conscientious on that next time. Also I think I'll bake it or cook in Oil next time Just to be a little healthier. My son Loves it and Again VERY EASY AND FAST!!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I hated it up everyone in my family LOVED it, I'm talking fighting over the leftovers. I thought it was way to salty and couldn't get the paste to stick to the filets. I guess it's just a matter of taste. If I could make it less salty it'd be perfect. Anyways, if you don't like salty dishes, I wouldn't recomend it.

These were good, but did lack some flavor as other reviewers had mentioned.  Would recommend adding more spices.  I also coated the chicken with mayo as some had suggested and that seemed to work well. Chicken was very tender, just not enough taste.

very greasy and not any crispier from frying it than it would have been in the oven, which also would have made it healthier as you could have omitted the butter.

I am a full time student and mom, and finding time to make new dishes and/or trying them at the same time is hard.. But this meal was perfect i altered it a little (since i'm on a diet) but it came wonderful and my family enjoys it, my husband hates fish that tastes like fish and this was wonderful.... eat up : )

Hi.  Instead of the crumbs I used crushed saltines, and baked instead of fried (400 for a short time on parchment). The amount of dressing mix to fish was a teensy bit high for our taste--the kids and the hubby ranked it as 'sour' but tasty. So next time I may skimp a little on the mix. The italian breadcrumbs would be good with it.  The cracker bits were slightly crunchy on top, but moist underneath. That was fine with me, what I wanted was an idea and a method, and I got it.

Overall a good recipe. I'd suggest making some of the changes that other reviewers have made, as following the recipe made this recipe a bit too salty for our tastes.

Very good.  I loved the crunchiness and the little extra kick the Ranch dressing made.  A fun alternative for fried fish.

My whole family loved this. I soaked the tilapia in buttermilk, then dredged it in the crumbs, to which I had added the ranch seasoning. Like other reviewers, I increased the amount of ranch seasoning and added a smidge of red pepper flakes. I let the filets sit about 25 minutes in the fridge to firm up the coating before cooking while I prepped my side dishes. I can't believe how quick, easy and tasty this was. We'll definitely be having this again. My persnickety 11 year old daughter demanded the leftovers for BREAKFAST the next day, and the 8 year old ate every bite!

THis was ok.  The fish was very moist, however I found the ranch to be really salty.  Maybe if I had just lightly brushed the fish with the paste, instead of dipping it in before the bread crumbs?

I made this for a friend for lunch yesterday and she loved it.  Great timing on the recipe as I had some frozen tilapia and she had mentioned that she'd never had it.  I followed some of the other reviews and tried to "lighten" the recipe.  I used the crumbs mixed with some dry ranch dressing, dipped the fillets in skim milk then the crumbs, baked for 25 minutes at 350 and they were perfect, nice and moist!  Even better than my old recipe that I've now thrown out.  Thanks!

Tastes fantastic, a bit of a PITA to make.  Needs more oil than listed to fry, I'd like to try to bake it as the frying oil adds quite a bit of fat.  I watered out the "paste" w/ a mixed egg.. may have used milk if I had it.

Great recipe. I followed the reviews--coated the fish with egg first then coated with the bread crumb/ranch mixture. I then baked it at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes (my fish was a little frozen). DELICIOUS!!

I find that I can make my own bread crumbs and leave them unseasoned, by zapping stale bread in my food processor.  A great substituet.

I broiled vs. fried.  This had a very tangy taste.  I love ranch dressing and it was just okay for me.  However, my taste buds are off because I have a cold so I am grading upward to a 4*.

This was really good.  I did bake it instead of frying.  I baked at 375 for 20 minutes flipping over halfway through. It's definitely a good option- tasty, easy, quick.

I agree with some of the other reviewers; it was way too salty.  As written, it isn't anything special (sorry). It was a good idea, but if I make this again, I will use much less seasoning and bread crumbs.  Also, I haven't tried this before, but I've heard of using ground up Fiber One cereal to create the crunchiness that some people were missing.

I did not read the reviews 1st because I was in such a hurry to fix dinner. I made it exactly and did find I was running out of the paste and it was not coated evenly. With that being said it was easy and it did get crispy - last piece nearly burned and my husband who dislikes fish actually ate it without using tarter sauce and liked it. I thought it was good but not great and I do like fish a lot. Will make again since this is the 1st fish recipe hubby will eat in 26 years.

I really liked this, the only problem I personally have is trying to find a fish recipe that doesnt taste FISHY.  Even the individual wrapped tilapia fillets end up with a strong fish taste, which, no matter how cooked, comes through.  But this recipe was good and I ended up getting it past 3 out of 4 family members without complaint!!

I thought these were very tasty.  Easy prep and quick cooking.  I followed the recipe exactly, however I had troubles getting the paste on the filets.  It was either way too much or way too little.  So some of the filets had a strong ranch taste, some had none.  However, both my husband and I enjoyed the dish and will make it again!

Simple and tasty.  Brushed fish with olive oil and covered with bread crumb/dressing mixture.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes and it wasn't crunch or crisp but cooked through.

I took the advise of other reviews and change this up a bit. Used corn flakes and added only half a packet of ranch dressing. It was perfect.

This fish was only okay in my book.  Not really a fan of using bread crumbs as a coating since I can never get the food crispy no matter how light the coating or how I cook it.  Next time will probably just skip the bread crumbs and use the ranch dressing as a marinade or basting sauce on the fish because it did have a nice flavor.

I was looking for a quick recipe for talapia to make after work and stumbled across this one and I'm so glad I did because it was absolutely delicious and took less than the time listed to prepare. I didn't have any of the ranch dressing mix so I used some buttermilk ranch dressing that I already had and it was moist and extra tasty!! I also used EVOO instead of veg oil. Will definitely make again. Thank you!

Ok, so I didn't read through all of the reviews, but I think I'm one of the only ones who tried this with actual ranch dressing (in the bottle).  I seasoned my fish with some salt and peper and then coated them in a thin layer of ranch (that I had added a little pesto to). I then coated them in bread crumbs (seasoned with some garlic/herb blend and dried rosemary).  I cooked them over medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side in some oil and butter.  The flavor was good, but I couldn't quite get them crispy enough (the thinnest parts were the best).  And I think in trying to get the crust nice and cruncy the fish was cooked too much.  Nonetheless, my boyfriend liked it a lot and we're looking forward to following the actual recipe next time.  Hey, never hurts to try! :)

I'm giving it 4 stars for potential.  I think the idea is great!  I did what everyone else did and mixed the ranch seasoning with the breadcrumbs, and I found that was not flavorful enough, but I had tons of breadcrumbs left over.  So, next time I will use probably halve the amount of breadcrumbs.  I think that would be about perfect.  Also, my way of cooking tilapia is to fry in a medium-hot pan for 3 minutes on each side and then throw it in a 375 degree oven for 8-10 minutes.  Deliciously crispy!

Good but salty as others have stated. Served with Plain white rice and baked potatoes which took away from the saltiness a bit. My husband AND four year old daughter both enjoyed this.. not an easy feat! lol =) Thanks!

This got good reviews from the kids and from my husband, I enjoyed it as well.  I used up 6 small fillets of tilapia and next time will use 2 packets of the dressing mix and double the oil.

only put the ranch mixture on one side since people were saying it was too salty.  I also used Panko breadcrumbs since people said it wasnt crunchy.  It was okay....but like others said, we ended up scrapping off the topping to just eat the fish.  I may make again and play around with it. But last night....it was just okay.

This was absolutely delicious.  Only bad thing (which really wasn't bad) was that it was kind of messy.  My fish fell apart when trying to turn it.  But this could be because I kept adding butter to the pan because I was afraid it would burn.  But it didn't take away from the good flavor.  Very simple fish recipe, and great when you don't want to spend a lot of money on fish.  However, not for people who don't like salt.  This is great because you don't need tartar sauce or anything else to dip it in.  The flavor is all there!  I'll keep this in my favorites.

This was just o.k. I used bottled ranch dressing instead of the packet. I found that the coating didn't stay on well at all when I fried it and the flavouring wasn't all that great. I probably won't make it again.

LOVED THIS FISH. CAN GIVE A BLAND FISH A LOT OF FLAVOR.  I THINK THE NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO TRY AND MIX THE RANCH DRESSING WITH THE BREAD CRUMBS AND RUB THE OIL ON THE FISH THEN THEN DREDGE.

Too funny!! I read the other reviews, where everyone was saying even people who don't like fish liked this. Well, my 13 year old daughter hates fish so much, she gets sick if she eats it. No, not allergic, just doesn't like the taste. So, I figured here's the ultimate test. I told her she had to eat one small bite, and if she didn't like it, she didn't have to eat any more. She took that bite, then, because 'she couldn't taste it' she took another one. Next, she put 1/2 of what was on her plate back in the pan 'to stick to her principals.' She actually liked it, but wouldn't eat it all just because she doesn't like fish!!!!!!

If I could, I'd give it more stars!

I needed double the ranch and oil for the paste -- maybe I was putting it on too thick. But it was delicious! Oh, and I also baked instead of fried -- 400 for about 25 minutes. Going into my rotation. Thanks!

It was alright.  Talipia is an awful "fishy" tasting fish.  We might try the coating on another type of fish.

I did't have some ingredients so i dredged the fish in ranch dressing and used club crackers to bread with. My family loved the taste although my breading didnt stay on very good.  Still a hit though!

I thought the breading was too spicy and so we had to scrape a lot of it off to eat it. My fiance didn't care for this, but I thought with less breading it was good.

This was delicious!  It didn't look too great but the flavor was awesome!  I didn't have any bread crumbs so i crushed some ceaser croutons i had instead.  I will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed these. My fillets were rather large so rather than make skimpy coated ones I only cooked two instead of four. The ranch flavour was suprisingly light tasting. I will make this again. Thanks

Way too salty!  Will try again, perhaps on chicken, but will heed some of the advise of others to dip in an egg white, then dredge in a mixture of breadcrumbs and ranch mix, although I think I'll still reduce the amount of ranch mix to ensure a less over-powering flavor.

We made our own bread crumbs out of whole wheat bread. This helped the recipe to not be to crunchy or salty. My husband said that this is now one of his favorite recipes!

Never thought ranch would go well with fish, but it was really good!  Next time I will use a little water instead of oil for the paste to cut down calories. We like our fish on the 'well done' side so I cooked it med-low until it was cooked through and nicely browned. My 5 yr old son said I was the best cook ever! =)  Thanks for the recipe, I will make it often.

Pretty good!  I didn't use butter, just Pam cooking spray and it turned out great.  Just watch and add more Pam when needed!

This was a very flavorful recipe! Could probably cut down on the calories more though by no butter and baking it!

Awesome recipe, all of my roommates loved it, even the picky one! I doubled the recipe but still had to use a bit more oil to cover all of the fish, but I did pick really big fish fillets.

I generally don't like fish but my husband does so I try recipes to cover up the fish taste.  This was one we both liked.

To add some extra ranch flavor, I mixed some bottled ranch dressing in to coat the fish before breading. My husband loved them, but said that he couldn't tell that they were supposed to be ranch flavored.

Very tasty recipe.  Added about half a TBSP to the ranch mixture because it was a little to thick.

My husband loved these! I made them just as the recipe says. I served them with asparagus wrapped with bacon and done in the broiler while the fish was cooking on the stove. So quick and easy!

I wish I could give this more than five stars.  It's quick, tasty and not a lot of ingredients is needed. I love that it makes a nice crust on the fish.  This is going to be kept in my family favorite recipe box. Thanks again!!!

Awesome! Easy & great tasting, I'm going to try baking instead of frying next time.
