Such a great recipe! Ours turned out very nicely. My guy absolutely LOVED it. I followed the recipe but just made more rue than in the recipe so it would not dry up with all the filling. I also added an herb flavored vegetable bullion cube.  Was perfect! Will definitely make it again.

This was so easy to prepare and perfect for leftover turkey! My whole family (including children) absolutely loved it, and were impressed at how "gourmet" it looked. I had to add a little extra broth because the flour mixture was extremely thick & impossible to work with. I also added a little garlic powder, but will add fresh garlic to the onion mixture next time.  I will definitely be making this again!

this turned out excellent!  I added spinach and some more onions and celery to give it more vegetables.  This was my first time with phyllo and it turned out fantastic!
