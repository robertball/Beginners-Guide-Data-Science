I'm the original creator of this recipe, Carol Emory.  I did not want to star rate my recipe because I feel that would be unfair, however I want to clear up some modifications that were made to the recipe.  I actually only use about half a cup of green onion and about 1 and 1/2 cups of petite peas.  Italian parsley is best to use when making this (also know as broad leaf parsley.)  I add the peas to the pasta in the last 2 minutes of cooking and rinse both to cool before mixing it together.  Also, I've found that ranch dressing works best (especially when mixed with 1 cup mayonaise and 1 cup low-fat buttermilk.)  The dressing has a better chance of staying creamy when buttermilk is used.  And with the portions listed, I would use about a half cup more of dressing and serve the recipe to about 8.  Thanks for the reviews everyone.  I have more recipes on the way!

I liked this recipe and I would definitely make it again-however, next time I will add more mayonnaise as the leftovers were a little dry the next day.

Honestly, the best creamy pasta salad.  Fresh parsley and the dry italian dressing mix are definitely the key ingredients.  I used more sour cream and less mayo and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it.

PS: You definitely need to reserve some dressing and add it when ready to serve.

What an awesome summer salad! We had a family of 5 as guests this weekend and I wanted something bulky that could make it 3 days, this was it! I did modify it a bit though: I added chopped plum tomatoes,a small jar of roasted red peppers with a couple tablespoons of the juice, a 6 ounce can of olives I sliced in half, and a bit more of the dry salad mix.  Wasn't dry at all - My husband said it's the best pasta salad he's ever had, and the 2 year old came back for more. Great recipe Carol!

I have made this many times since first coming across this recipe in 2001. The only modification I have made is I add cubed cheese as I can never get enough cheese. The last time I made it I could only find sliced salami, so I just cut each piece into fourths. This was by far the best and I will do this going forward. This is always a hit!

SOOOO GOOOOD! I was tired of the same old pasta salad with the bottled Italian dressing, and boy was this salad a delicious change! What a wonderfully refreshing and simple dish! Made it in 15 minutes (chopped the veggies and mixed the dressing while the noodles boiled). I used rotele noodles, diced a half a cucumber, half a red bell pepper, and half a carrot. Minced 2 cloves garlic, and coarsley chopped a quarter of an onion (the onion flavor did not overpower the dish). Dressing was 3/4 C mayo, 3/4 C sour cream, 1/4 C milk, and 1 packet dry Italian dressing mix.  That's it!  I completely forgot to put salami, or pepperoni, but the meat was not missed, even by my extremely carnivorous boyfriend. Now even my vegetarian friends can enjoy the fantastic salad! I believe any combo of veggies will work wonderfully. Just use what's on hand. THANKS CAROL:)

i have made this many times since first finding it. It is a FABULOUS recipe for hot summer night when no one really wants to eat. Even the kids love it ( and they do not like salad for dinner )! I used the Kroger- Private Selections Hard Salami ( I think it is a 16 oz. package way cheaper than the Genoa found in the regular lunch meat section cut into pizza like wedges)
and a small bag of frozen baby carrots and a small bag of frozen petite baby peas , thawed and drained ( extras are for the next time) dice the celery don't chop it
and add any of your favorite veggies, such as broccoli ( florettes), tomato,diced red pepper diced and red onion diced. Try it, you will love it!

I would not make this again. It was ok. The previous reviewers were right, it was way too dry and needed more milk. I  doubled the dressing ingredients and it was still vey dry after being in the fridge. Regardless I did not think it tasted all that great.

Good pasta salad to eat during the heat of summer.  Make the night before and enjoy for dinner the next day.  I didn't change a thing in this recipe.  But, I would suggest using tri-colored pasta noodles just to add some color to this mostly green dish.  Thanks!

I made this for a family function and got RAVE reviews.  I made it the night before, and allowed the dressing to really set in.  I added some peppers (green, yellow and red), pepperoni, olives and chunks of cheese.  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you Carol.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it.  I definitely needed to add the extra dressing in the morning in order to make the pasta more moist.  It tasted great, and it was especially a hit with the kids!

This salad tasted really good, although, I omitted the peas and green onions. I substituted artichoke hearts, tomato, and cheese. Very good. Next time I'll try a pkg of dry ranch mix instead of italian. Great for a potluck.

Made this several times during the holidays but never took time to tell you how GREAT a recipe this is, I have cut it down to smaller scale several times, works great every time.  A little extra milk sometimes is necessary, but easy to judge.  Thanks for this great one!

We thought this was great! Fellow cooks ~ use your creativity! This is an excellent base for a wonderful salad that can be customized to your tastes. For starters: I'm not fond of salami so I used some cubed/cooked ham. I added the veggies I like such as green/red bell peppers, (left in the celery & green onions but added them to taste). I took anothers advice = used 3/4c mayo, 3/4c sour cream, 2 TBLS milk and the dry italian dressing. Finally, JUST before serving, I added a small handful of shredded cheddar cheese (although it really was not needed). Great pasta salad w/ our steak dinner! A keeper in my book! Thanks!

I omitted the peas, parsley, and celery and added halved cherry tomatoes, julienned green peppers, as well as some diced ham and provolone.  The dressing was good and was a nice change from the typical Italian dressing pasta salad.

Sorry Carol, I was disappointed in this salad. Thought it would be better because of the reviews. I did use pasta shells, dried parsley falkes and bottled creamy Italian dressing. The dressing was good but the combo of the olives and peas just didn't get it for me. Hubby didn't comment on it either. That wasn't a good sign. I think I might leave the peas out next time, if there is a next time. It made a huge batch and the leftovers haven't gotten any better either.

This has got to be the best pasta recipe I have ever made.  We usually make it once every two weeks and have changed the recipe up by dropping the peas and celery and adding 4 hardboiled eggs, green olives and exchanging genoa salami for genova.  Outstanding creamy pasta salad.

I made this pasta salad for a family BBQ. It was the first time I ever made a pasta salad ever & I am an experienced cook. It was fabulous. Everybody enjoyed it. I used both regular salami & pepperoni cubed in the salad. Thanks. Bernie

I tried the recipe based on the rave reviews that it got from so many others, and i have to add my own raves now - especially from my husband and daughter.  So tasty - was the comment.  I won't make it any other way now. I left out the salami (vegetarians) and used 1/2 low fat sour cream and l/2 regular, but followed the recipe exactly other than that. Great recipe.

We took this to a church picnic and everyone raved about it.  It takes some time to chop up everything, but it is well worth it.  Very delicious!

Wow!  This recipe is up there in our list of all-time favorite pasta salads.  When my husband took his first bite, he closed his eyes and could only make multiple yummy sounds.  This salad would be a certain hit at a pot luck or picnic.  Can't wait to try it on my friends.

Good! It was a little on the bland side for our tastes as written - added a few additional seasonings to kick it up a notch. Also added grape tomatoes for a splash of color. As the submitter wrote in their review, the amount of peas is a little much. I made half a recipe and only used about a 1/4 cup of peas, which was plenty for us. Thanks :)

OK, for those who wrote that the pasta was dry, this is what I did:  Use one 16 oz. carton of sour cream, 1 cup mayonnaise, 1 package dry Italian dressing mix, 3 tablespoons bottled Italian dressing and mix.  Mix in 16 oz. pasta of your choice and refrigerate at least 4 hours.  Was not dry for me even the next day, plus the higher ratio of sour cream to mayonnaise made it less mayonnaisy.

To die for...ok..maybe not to die for...but this is really good!!  I have made it several times and use different pasta each time.  I use a whole bag of petite peas.  I don't add onion, due to a 14 year old....I add pepperoni, hard salami, fontina, cheddar, cherry tomatoes, you name it...you can add it...I have made it with and without the fresh parsley.  No difference to  my family.  I like to use the zesty Italian dry mix if I can get it at the store.  This is a true keeper!!!

original posting: 5/22/06 Not as good as i thought it would be. Im suprised at all the rave reviews.
I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was too dry and a lil on the bland side. Thought it was missing something. The measurements are probably  a lil off too. not enough peas, and salomi for all that pasta.I might give it another shot, and just eye ball everything instead of measuring. I think it has potential to be great.
12/4/09: Ok i am going to bump this up from 3 to 4 stars. The second time around i eyeballed the ingredients instead of measuring and it was alot better. I do think the dressing needs alot more milk to thin it out but other than that it was great.

I really like this recipe and used it for a shower and several asked for the recipe. The creamy pasta isn't as heavy as I thought it might have been. Very good and simple recipe. I subbed the Genoa Salami with cubed ham and it worked very well. I also thought that you could use chicken too.

Hmmm...I chose this recipe because there were so many good reviews, but I don't see what all the hype was about.  I thought the pasta salad came out dry and not tasty at all.  It seemed that I was eating straight pasta with no sauce.  I even added a cup of milk instead of two teaspoons.  Oh well...on to the next recipe.

This was a great recipe! I made this for a bridal shower and everyone enjoyed it...no one asked me for the recipe, but they ate over half of it! This does MAKE A LOT!!! I did change a few things, I did not use green onions, and I used Seven Seas Creamy Italian Dressing out of the bottle, instead of the packet, and a bag of Italian cheese (Kraft) I also added little tomatoes, and that really added color!

Delicious! Our family just loved it. One guest didn't like it because it wasn't the bottled Italian dressing he preferred but the rest of us loved this new take on it. Makes a lot!!! (Easily served 10.) Next time I'll half it.

I'm not a lover of pasta salads, but I made this a luncheon and they loved it.  I added blanched broccoli & diced carrots for color.  I didn't have green onion so I finely diced regular onion and added that.  I didn't use peas because so many people don't like them.  I wish I had seen the reviews saying to use buttermilk, b/c without it, it's rather bland.  I added 1/2 cup ranch dressing and that worked perfectly.

Thanks, Carol, for a great recipe!  Everybody I've served this dish to loves it!  You can't go wrong because you can take out or put in whatever ingredients you want.  I add herb-garlic feta cheese and/or mozzarella cheese.  I also use ranch from the bottle instead of salad dressing mix, milk & mayo like someone else suggested.  Use rainbow pasta for great presentation.  Keep extra ranch handy because the pasta soaks up the moisture.

I'm making this salad again today for a group barbeque.  My husband, who does NOT like pasta salads, asked me to bring it.  It is truly wonderful!

I add "buttons" of sliced string cheese, and use sliced salami cut up in small pieces instead of cubed salami.

The last time I took it, there was none left to take home, so that says how others felt about it, too.

This is an awsome past dish!!!  I have made this dish 3 times, and all 3 times I have had so many compliments.  I did make a few changes of my own.  I added both red and green peppers, cucmbers, shredded carrots, as well as adding a little more milk.  However, I must say the reciepe is outstanding!!!

I was not impressed.  I'm a big fan of Good Seasons dressing, but not on in this recipe.  As far as presentation, the white dressing coated everything and the beautiful colors of the salami, peas, and olives were lost.  There was a definite mayonaise taste to the dressing.  I would not make again.

This was really great and I will definitely make it again.  I used bottled creamy italian dressing and sliced pepperoni instead of the genoa salami. The dressing was a nice change from the traditional oil and vinegar based dressing - everyone wanted to know what was in it. I doubled the recipe and brought it to a birthday party and it disappeared.

I have been making this pasta salad for every summer picnic occasion since I discovered it in 2002.  It is always a hit and everyone always asks for the recipe!  The only change I have made is; we use mini-farfalle pasta.  It incorporates all the flavors and you get a little bit of everything in every bite.  Enjoy!

Exactly what I was looking for... this is perfect for cleaning out my fridge.  I subbed greek yogurt for s. cream, used a "mystery packet" from Tastefully Simple instead of It. Seasoning (I think it was 5 years old... and I think it was some sort of Asian blend), and ham instead of salami.  Anyways, it was good!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this!  I just now made this, minus the salami, and ate immediately.  Very tasty, and next time I will add tge salami and treat this more as a main dish, rather than a meatless side...

Love love love! Did I mention I love this recipe? I sub penne because my family prefers it to fusilli. I bought a large thick slice of salami from the deli counter and then cube it myself. I make this for almost every family gathering (picnic, bbq, graduation, 4th of July) and everyone loves it.

I loved this! I used slightly less pasta because I read the reviews that it was dry, and I thought it would be easier to do less pasta than more sauce. I also added red pepper because I had it on hand.

I have been making a salad almost like this for 20+ years: it is in my file as "Jeff's Salad" because my son likes it so much. I sliver the salami, add cubed cheddar cheese and instead of peas, use slightly steamed broccoli. Exact same dressing, which everyone seems to enjoy.

I kept the dressing the same and added red pepper, cucumbers, and red onion.  Very colorful and delicious even before it has sat in fridge!!  Will make again and again!

We didnt care for this all that much. I honestly didnt think it had enough flavor and even with the reserved dressing it was still too dry and the flavor of the dressing took away from the salami which I couldnt taste at all - kind of a waste of money. I will keep looking but thanks anyway.

I made this dish the other day and we all loved it!  My husband does not like cold pasta, but he liked this.  My 3 year old even loved it.  I did use 1/4 cup of milk instead of the 2tbs and along with the salami, I added grilled chicken cut up in pieces.  I made it Tuesday night, it's still nice and creamy today, Friday.  I am definately keeping this recipe and taking it to a picnic we're having at the end of the month.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I substituted chopped red pepper for the celery, buttermilk for the sour cream, and did 1/2 italian dressing mix and half buttermilk ranch.  Kids and adults at the potluck gobbled it up!  This is the best recipe I've ever tried on allrecipes.com!

We made this for Memorial Day and really enjoyed it. We left out the olives just for our own personal preference and used mini penne for the pasta. This was yummy comfort food and a nice side dish to go with grilled burgers. The dressing was great and very creamy. I'm not a huge fan of celery, but they really added a nice crunch to the salad, and I'm glad we left them in. We'll make this one again.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made it Saturday and served it Sunday, I do believe it's best to be chilled overnight.  I also added tortellini and some cubed cheese.  I ended up doubling the dressing for this-it worked out great with my extra add-ins.  We all loved this recipe and agreed it was a wonderful change from just using Italian dressing for a pasta salad.  Thanks for sharing this one, it's a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I wasn't able to find Genoa salami, so I used hard salami instead (in the deli meat section). I also had to substitute mini-farfalle (bowtie) pasta for the fusilli, but any pasta will work.  This recipe is a keeper!

Huge hit at my daughters birthday party.  Kids and adults went for it.  I hate celery so for crunch I added some thinly sliced baby carrots.  I chilled it overnight with most of the dressing on then added some extra dressing just before serving and it was great!  Will definately be making again and again.

This is a great pasta salad.  I made a few modifications for personal taste.  I added 1 cup chopped red roasted peppers, 1/2 cup sliced green pimento stuffed olives and 3/4 cup shredded parmesan-romano cheese and increased the dressing to keep it from being too dry.  I make this salad all the time and everyone loves it.  Thanks for the recipe !

Incredible pasta salad.  Much better than the typical pasta salad with oil/vinegar dressing.  This creamy dressing really stands out and makes this salad 5 stars.  I brought it to a 4th of July party and it was the first thing emptied in the buffet line.

This is a very good basic recipe and you can use whatever veggies you have on hand.  I used red peppers and broccoli.  I also subsituted pepperoni for salami because I didn't have any. I also used bottled Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and added low fat sour cream to cut it a bit.  Took this to a pot luck and the hosts ate the leftovers all week.

I've never really cared for peas or black olives, but this recipe blends these vegetables so well, that I never even noticed they were in there.

Definitely the best pasta salad I've ever had!

Although this is a good recipe, after mixing it up, I doubled the onion. And felt there was not enough dressing, especially the next day, so I recommend making half again of the dressing mix.

I made this initially for Memorial day bbq and it was AWESOME.  Then I made it for a pasta pot luck for some people in my office who were running the "Lawyers Have Heart" race the next day...several people asked for the recipe.  Then I made it for a friend's bbq and got rave reviews.  Next I'm making it for a housewarming party...Can't get enough of this pasta salad!  I didn't change a thing, it's perfect as is.

Made this for a baby shower and followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the salami to keep it vegetarian.  I thought it was okay but needed more salt.  Next time I will include the salami and maybe some diced cheese.

Great pasta salad.  Always a big hit!!! I just buy two inch thick pieces of salami from the deli and then cube it. It gets dry over nite, so in addition to the remaining mayo mix, I add a little more mayo if I have to.  Thanks for the great recipe

I substituted turkey salami for the Genoa.  I also used peas and carrots.  I substituted creamy Italian dressing for the mayo combination which made the recipe even easier.  I added sundried tomatos for a different flavor. Everyone loved it. Will make a gain.

This was a very delicious pasta salad.  I used garlic/parsley fusilli which added just a hint of garlic.  I will add this to my favourite recipes list.

The dressing was good and everyone at the picnic ate it, but no one asked for the recipe...asking for the recipe is my gauge on greatness.  I'd make this again though.

I liked this recipe, but changed a few things.  I used (turkey) pepperoni, fat-free sour cream, tri-colored pasta, and left out the parsley.  The dressing was excellent, but seemed a little dry.  Instead of only 2 Tbs. milk, I used 1/4 cup.  Adding more milk made the dressing stay moist for a few days, as if I had just made it.

I took this dish to a potluck and it was a big hit. I prepared the salad with salami as noted but I want to use pepperoni next time and I am sure it will be just as good. Try it!

This was a big hit. We planned a BBQ and I woke up the morning of worrying that I did not plan for enough food. I had all these ingredients on hand so I made it. Everyone loved it and there was none left. Will definitely make this again.

I gave this five stars because it's easy to make, is delicious, makes enough to feed a crowd, and uses ingredients that you probably already have at home.  Very good. Very easy.  I made it according to the recipe. Next time I'm going to sprinkle  some grated parmesan cheese on top. And to add more color and crunch, next time I will add diced carrots.

Good recipe, although when I mixed up the mayo/sour cream/milk I determined it was way too much for 16oz of pasta and instead made two 14oz boxes of rotini and there was plenty. I also used two Italian dressing seasoning packets to add a bit more flavor to the recipe. Otherwise, delicious!! Love a pasta salad recipe that's easy and has the creamy consistency to it - much more fun than just a bottle of italian dressing!

Yummy! My husband gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up, and declared it a new favorite! I forsee in my future making this numerous times this summer. I used shell pasta instead of the spiral. Especially liked the peas and salami. Thanks!

I used tri-color pasta and regular, lunch meat salami (which I cut into four wedges).  It's a good pasta salad and I liked the various vegetables; however, it's not an "out of this world" good pasta salad.  I'll try a different recipe the next time I need to make a pasta salad.

I've made this recipe numerous times over the past few years and it always receives rave reviews.  I just made it again on Saturday for my daughters' birthday party to accompany pizza for 49 guests.  It was a huge hit! Recipe doubles well.

Very yummy! I couldn't find "Genoa" salami, so I used Oscar Meyer "Hard Salami" for sandwiches and it was delicious.

I printed this recipe several years ago and use it every summer for potluck BBQs, and it always goes over well. I don't use a package italian mix, I just add oregano, garlic powder, dill, & basil into the mayo/sour cream.

Good salad!  I was searching for something else and this was the closest version I could find.  I omitted the olives, salami, onions, and parsley.  I'll make this again as a side and add those omitted ingredients for potlucks.

Excellent Recipe.  I made it twice so far.  Once for a Boy Scout Dinner event and once for co-workers at a party.  It was a hit.  (A little expensive though).

I added cauliflower and green beans I had in the fridge, no meat and used mozzarella cheese. One night I added cut up rotisserie chicken and extra mayo for a salad meal. I’ll make it again. It was really good

Yum! As others have suggested, feel free to adjust the veggies as you wish. I have included chopped broccoli, chopped cucumber, chopped red peeper, artichoke heart, cherry tomatoes, etc. I leave out the onion, but include some onion powder. I have been known to add chunks of cheddar (yum!). I also substitute at least half of the mayo with plain yogurt, to save calories, and I play the milk by ear, adding enough, as I wish, to make the salad as moist as I like. Plan to stir in a bit more milk before serving-- it gets a bit stiff in the fridge. This is a wonderful little pasta salad-- my favorite, by a long shot. Try it!

this gets 5 stars because i usually am not a huge fan of pasta salad, but i loved this! Instead of peas and parsely, i put in broccoli and tomatoes. i didnt have packaged italian dressing, so i just used a few tbsp of italian dressing instead of that and the milk. if it thickens up in the fridge, thats normal, just add a spash of milk! yum thank you

Very good pasta salad.  I've made it a couple of times this summer and the dressing is light and tasty and simple to make.  I keep my pasta and dressing seperate until I am ready to use the salad, as the pasta absorbs so much of the dressing when it sits.

Nice twist on an old favorite.  Sauce has good flavor, but needs something extra.    Instead of cubed cheese, I used a blend of the shredded provolone and mozzarella.  Great recipe to start with, that can be adapted to your own taste.

It tasted too much like mayo.  I tried adding pesto to it and I still was not impressed with the flavor.

I know this recipe got a lot of great reviews from other people; however, I was very disappointed. It was extremely dry and not that tasty. I covered it and let it set in the refrigerator. I even made extra dressing and brought it along for those who wanted to add a little more. The only change I made was using ham in place of salami. It just wasn't a hit at all. There were about 20 people at the party as samplers and not a one said it was good or asked for the recipe. And this was a group, that when a recipe is good they all want a copy.

I was disappointed in this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated it overnight.  This morning it was very, very dry and even the 1/2 cup of the dressing I had reserved was not enough.  I ended up adding about a cup of Italian dressing which I luckily had on hand.  Except for that, the dish is tasty.

I tried this recipe with ham instead of salami, and it was delicious. I loved the creamy sauce instead of the oily sauce other pasta salads have, and the chunked ham blended in nicely.  I think salami would work just as nice, but the ham caught my eye at the grocery store.  Just be sure to not cook the pasta too long - sitting overnight in that sauce softens it up even more.  Keeping this one in the recipe box at home!

DELISH~I didn`t have all the specialty ingreadiants like the salmai, pepparoni sausage or provolone cheese. Or even the olives and peas, lol. But, I made the dressing exactly as wrote. It rocked! I used fettacine noodles because that was all I had. I only had regular pasta salad veggies (carrots, green onion, bracoli, tomatoes and red, yellow and orange peppers). It was the best pasta salad everyone loved the neat twist on a classic. Everyone was pleased even the toddlers! A KEEPER, I WILL MAKE THIS INSTEAD OF THE USUAL ITALIAN DRESSING ONE I MAKE.

I have to say this is a wonderful salad! I mixed the dressing as directed but just used the veges that sounded good - thinly sliced carrot, roasted red pepper, diced green pepper, chopped cucumber, chopped red onion, cherry tomatoes and chopped smoked ham.  WOW! SUPER SUMMER SALAD!

Even the kids love this. The seasoning taste is not strong. My 8yr old daughter loved the dressing so much. She made me dice up the leftover salami and she just dipped it in the sides of the empty bowl. She said it tasted like ranch but didn't burn her throat like the nomal(bottled) ranch. I did add quartered cherry tomatoes to my husbands serving and he said it was the best I ever made. This recipe was a hit in our house.

Good but it seemed like it needed something else. Green olives maybe? Next time I'll make this with more salami, some green olives, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Hopefully then I could rate it 5 stars.

I agree with a few other reviews that this can be a little bland, especially if you only taste the pasta without the other ingredients. It also a little dry even after adding the additional dressing the next morning. Guests ate over half of it.  Worth trying again & tweeking the recipe for those cooks who know their herbs & spices & how to use them together.
