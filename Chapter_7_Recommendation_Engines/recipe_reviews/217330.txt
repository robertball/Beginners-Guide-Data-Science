This is a mainstay for us. I did add extra cumin, curry and tumeric to the pot as the ginger was saut√©ed

I love Indian food and this was so simple to do at home love the recipe, but my trick when cooking with tofu is to use a tofu press or pressure to get the moisture out first and it has way more flavor... I love it

This was very easy to make. I used regular curry powder and I didn't have ginger root so I used ginger powder. I also didnt have veg. broth so I used chicken broth. Instead of tomato paste I used tomato sauce because it was all I had. I omitted the mushrooms. My husband loved it because we are normally meat eaters but are trying to eat healthier and this was perfect !! It was very filling and I cant wait to share the recipe with the rest of my family!!

Very good! I added a chopped Portuguese hot cherry pepper for heat, as my vindaloo curry powder is more aromatic than spicy, a couple cloves of garlic, some cilantro and I omitted the mushrooms.  Very tasty and filling!

I used a head of cauliflower, entire can of tomato paste along with regular curry powder (more than recommended), added some ginger powder and cashews. Easy and flavorful.

Great meal! I made it as directed, except that I used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth. The recipe was easy and delicious, and spicy. The curry powder can be garam masala or regular curry powder. Definitely add some salt.

I made this exactly as the recipe states, except I used regular curry powder, and it was a huge hit. Lots of yummy leftovers. Will definitely be making this again.

I doubled the amount of curry powder (standard for any Indian cooking) and it was still too bland.      Might have been better with a sliced orange pepper or nuts, as others have suggested.    Or maybe some (a lot) of garlic.   Definitely needs salt.    Will not make again without major revisions.

I thought it sounded a little one-dimensional on the spices. So I added 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 2 tsp oregano, and used regular curry powder since that's what I had. It came out really good! I will definitely be making this again, as this is the only tofu recipe I've found that I like so far.

This turned out really well.  I did not have vindaloo curry so just used regular.  It was not really spicy.  I also threw in some cashews with it.  Great dish!

quite tasty!  i made a couple of changes; i added garlic, salt and a serrano pepper.  i also didn't have vindaloo powder, so i used regular curry powder.  i also salted the veggies a little while they were cooking to help them reduce a little.  i have never cooked with tofu before, though i am a huge fan.  just be careful to FOLD (as the recipe says) and not stir, otherwise you will break up the chunks of tofu.  anyway, this one is going in the recipe box!!

I'll admit I changed the amounts of ingredients to suit my tastebuds, but it still turned out great! I went light on the curry power, heavy on the mushrooms, and omitted the cauliflower (because I refuse to pay $6.00 a head!). I buy whole ginger on sale and freeze it in one inch pieces so I always have it on hand. I will make this again.

This is wonderful and simple!  I more than doubled the vindaloo (because we are crazy in my house) and I substituted something green (brocolli, fresh beans) in place of the carrots.  I've made this several times and it is wonderful.  Also try using fresh roma tomato instead of paste - way better.

This was really great! Tasted like something you would pay for at some fancy restaurant. Would definitely suggest throwing in a few more spices to pump it up a bit - like turmeric, garam masala and cumin. Needs lots of salt. Yummy.

Only changes I made were to substitute japanese eggplant for cauliflower and to use a dollop of commercial curry paste (I used a madras paste) instead of curry powder. Im convinced that anything made with coconut milk tastes amazing. Even my toddler ate this up. Very tasty!

Super delicious and easy to prepare.  I didn't have vindaloo powder, so I used 3 tbs regular curry powder and 1 tbs garam masala.  To add some spice I threw in 1 heaping tbs of crushed red pepper flakes.  I doubled the mushrooms and added 3 cloves of garlic since I'm a fan.

This is also great on top of spaghetti squash or quinoa for anyone looking to cut some calories or diversify.

I just made this.  It's easy and very comforting.  It snowed here today on the first day of spring so it was perfect. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and thickened it with a bit of corn starch.  Yum!

We have had this dish several times in the last few weeks.  Prep is actually very easy and the end result is a very good combination of ingredients, texture and spice.  Served with brown rice makes for a great vegetarian meal that provides for a great leftover the next day.

Great basic recipe.  I used sweet potatoes instead of cauliflower and they were great.  I also added lots of chopped fresh cilantro, because we love the taste. I substituted "Kitchen King" spice mix (a lady at the Indian grocery told me about it) for the vindaloo  powder because my husband likes spicy but not hot.  It was delicious.

Wow...really great recipe!  Two things though....cooking times listed are too short. "Cook until vegetable have softened, about 5 min." Really it's more like 10 - 15 min.  "Simmer until vegetables are tender...15 min " Really more like 45 - 60 min.  If you are hesitant about the tofu like I was, suggest cutting the extra-firm tofu into smaller cubes.

All I have to say is AMAZING! This dish was so flavorful, filling yet light. I'M a vegetarian and it's challenging to find great dishes that offer all of those elements. When we journey to India within the next year I'll know how to cook traditional Indian dishes that are healthy. Thanks for sharing

Oh wow, thank you sidnam!!! I was so excited when I saw this recipe and the positive reviews! My daughter and I love Indian food and though I've tried many times to make something delicious at home (with an Indian flavor) I have been seriously unable!!! YOUR RECIPE IS TOTAL SUCCESS!!! I did sautee my mushrooms with the veggies in the beginning and I only used one good sized onion. I also used 6 cloves of garlic as we love, love, love garlic and it's so good for you! And I had to use lite coconut milk cuz...well, healthy eating dictates it!!! Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T!!! I will say that I did end up buying an American-looking curry powder. I believe that success and failure will depend largely on that one ingredient. Some have mentioned that it's bland. I agree if you mean non-spicy-hot! But for me and my simple tastebuds it was just perfect. I figured my hubby who likes spicy food can just add a squirt of sriracha and call it a day! But otherwise this is seriously flavorful goodness! My daughter is at college right now but I can't wait for her to come home so I can show off my new skills...all thanks to sidnam!!!

Easy to make. My husband really enjoyed it.  My 3 yr old complained a bit about the tofu and chickpeas as it was usual to him but he still ate it all when he realized he could make a taco with naan bread.  I used low fat coconut milk, no onions as my hubby does not like them and a mixture of curry powder, cumin, etc as previously recommended by a reviewer (chili peppers instead of red pepper flakes) as I could not find the curry vindaloo powder. It was not really spicy, there was some heat to it but as someone who does not like really spicy foods I would say this was a mild heat. I forgot to add salt and it was a little bland but still good but after I added salt to my own plate it just seemed to bring out all the flavors and it tasted much better.  My hubby did not salt his and still had a second serving of it.  It was a delicious dinner I will be sure to make it again for vegetarian night!

Hands down the best recipe I have ever tried. My husband raved about this and took some to work to share with his friends. Everyone loves this dish. We have started a plant based diet and we were worried that we‚Äôd lose out on flavor and texture in our meals. This dish delivered in both areas.

I love this recipe. But used Brussels Sprouts for  an ingredient as that's what I had and used Ga ram Marsala for curry.  Delicious!!

I made minimal changes--left out the garbanzos (didn't have any) and added peas, as well as a little cumin.  Delish.  We'll be putting this in regular rotation.

This was fantastic, I used an extra tablespoon of vindaloo powder for even more of a spicy punch.  I will definitely make this again, possibly with chicken or lamb next time.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

As others mentioned this was super bland. I couldn‚Äôt find vindaloo curry powder so I used half curry powder and half garam masala. I ended up adding quite a bit more garam masala, coriander and cumin as it cooked. Otherwise it would have been flavorless. I might add cashews as others have mentioned by others next time.

I cooked the vegetables longer and simmered longer. I would cut the cauliflower florets in half for a softer texture in the future.

Dropped the chick peas, added more paste.  Absolutely recommend using fresh minced ginger root for saut√©ing the vegetables.  Can substitute cauliflower for broccoli.  

Made own Vindaloo Curry Spice mix:
1 Tbsp Garlic Powder
Cayenne Pepper Powder to taste (1/2 tsp for mild, 1 tbsp for HOT)
1 tsp Paprika, ginger powder, coriander, mustard powder
1/2 tsp cumin, cinnamon, turmeric.

For more curry flavor over heat, add more paprika, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and turmeric.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I did add a dash of turmeric, garam masala, and red pepper. I wasn't crazy about the flavor, so I regretted that I added other spices and can't give an honest review of the recipe as-is. I also used regular curry powder because my store didn't have Vindaloo powder. I think I will attempt it once more once I find Vindaloo. It was pretty good, though, and I had no problem eating it last night!

I'm going to make this tonight, however I'm wondering if the Tofu might have a "crispy edge" if I first saute in a separate pan with a little EVOO.  I'd like a texture to the protein.  Any thoughts?

I liked it and will be making it again. The only thing I'd like to point out is that the cauliflower is nowhere near ready after 15 minutes of simmering (for me it took around half an hour). And definitely don't skip salt!

I used coconut cream once accidentally. Coconut cream is sweet. Ever since, my daughter prefers it sweet so I use the coconut milk and add sugar. About 5 tsps.

Fantastic recipe! Fast and easy, add Jasmin or Basmati rice and your at an India Restaurant! I added extra mushrooms and a hint extra Vindaloo Curry powder. Awesome! I am Vegan and I served this to my non vegan, but health conscience girlfriend and she loved it, had it the next day for leftovers too!

The gf says: "Wow, this is really good. Such good flavors! *pats me on knee* I love you!"  I found that following the recipe left the veggies a little bit crunchy (though definitely not raw), which adds body to the stew. We ate it over brown rice...the next day the gf served it the same way as leftovers, but with an overeasy egg on top...which was fantastic.

Between the excessive tomato paste and the coconut milk, it just tasted like a can of Campbell's tomato soup, but hot.

i really liked this recipe!!  i used regular curry powder. i love all the different ingredients. the recipes i've used before usually just have maybe 3 vegetables and tofu. i used the full amount of oil but you could easily scale this back to a tbsp.

NOTE: i made this a second time using light coconut milk and a different curry powder. not good. make sure you use regular coconut milk and get a good curry powder (ex. sharwood's) and don't use a regular grocery store one (ex. no name brand superstore, club house).

Loved it! I had all the ingredients at homes so it was a quick meal for me. Even though I am not vegetarian, I often eat veggie dishes. Overall I had my taste buds had fun with this dish!! Oh and I used broccoli instead of cauliflower.

I found this to be quite good.  A few said it was bland, which I found to be true UNTIL I added the salt, as the recipe says. I only had regular curry and added turmeric.  The only other alteration I made was to the tofu.  I don't like tofu's consistency, so I coated it in whole wheat flour and baked it until crisp on the outside.  I wish rice had been in the ingredients.  I didn't note that until it was too late. If the option were available, I would have given this a 4 1/2 stars.

Really liked this recipe even though I changed a bit based on reviews from others.  First, I cut up the tofu and pan-fried it before adding it to the mix (I like when the edges are lightly browned).  I used a whole small can of tomato paste and a quart of Veg stock to make a larger batch and to create a soup/stew.  I used a whole head of cauliflower and some extra carrots.  Loved the recipe.  It was flavorful and easy to make.  The prep was a little time-consuming but worth it.

This was my first time making this recipe. I followed it to a T, however to me it was a bit bland. The ginger taste/smell is VERY strong. I love Indian food and was a bit disappointed at how this recipe turned out.  Any suggestions?
