Taking the "heads up" from Tunatwist, I used regular Cool Whip rather than the strawberry, folding in some pureed frozen strawberries. I also added a little lemon zest to the pudding for fresher flavor. Not a bad dessert for something so easy.

I think I ate almost the whole pan myself! I lined the pan with foil which I sprayed with non-stick spray. I followed the crust and cream cheese-layer directions, but instead of using pudding mixes, I used a can of lemon pie filling. And I didn't use the strawberry cool whip since it's gotten not-good reviews, I just used regular low-fat whipped topping. Pretty good! It wants to be a lemon cheesecake, but it's a little less bad for you. :)

Very good! My sister in law makes these but uses banana pudding instead. The strawberry cool whip is not always in stock at local stores.

i made exactly as written, except i used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, fat free pudding mix and low-fat graham crackers.  i would give this recipe 5 stars except for the somewhat jarring fake strawberry taste of the cool whip.  i would suggest using 1/2 the amt. of strawberry cool whip...that's what i'm doing next time, anyway.  and, there WILL be a next time--it's too easy and everything else abt. the recipe tasted great.

I made these for a potluck and they were devoured within minutes!  I absolutely HATE flavored cool whip, so I sliced about 2 cups of fresh strawberries and folded them into plain cool whip.  Fabulous.

This wasn't terrible, but I just couldn't get past the fake strawberry flavor from the Cool Whip.  It would have been much better using regular Cool Whip with real strawberries mixed in.

I took the advice of others and used regular whip cream with sliced strawberries instead of strawberry flavored whip cream. I also used neufchatel cheese (cream cheese with 1/3 less fat) and sugar free lemon pudding. This cuts down on calories but still gives it the great taste. The only problem that I had is I made this the day before and the strawberry juices made it a little runny.
