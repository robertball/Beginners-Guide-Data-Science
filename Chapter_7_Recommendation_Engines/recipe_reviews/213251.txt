This was a hit with my friends.  For the pearl sugar I caramelized the sugar over medium heat in a sauce pan then poured it out onto a cookie sheet and let it cool.  Then I shattered the sheet and used the shards as the pearls.  It works very well.  I suggest using a medium low heat in the waffle iron.  That way when you are making several waffles you will not burn the sugar from previous waffles.

The texture is good BUT this recipe has TOO MUCH oil in it!!!!! The dough started leaching oil as it sits and my waffle iron was flooded with a pool of oil when the waffles were cooking. A total disaster! I would say just cut back on the oil say 1/2 cup and you'll be fine.

My husband and I really enjoyed these.  We put strawberries and strawberry syrup on them.  I ordered the Lars Belgium Pearl sugar from Amazon.  It takes a whole package for one recipe.  I used a wooden scewer to scrape the hardened up sugar out of my waffle iron for cleanup.

I joined this site just to review this recipe.  This is the third Liege waffle recipe I have tried- the first of which was excellent, but required you to start making them a day ahead.  The second were too bland and bready.  This recipe comes very close to flavor and texture of the 24 hour recipe, but in about 2 hours from start to finish.  I, too, was concerned about the amount of butter, but decided to try the recipe as indicated anyway.  I had no problems with too much butter, and I think it even contributes to the richness of the waffle.  Perhaps the reviewer that had the butter leaking issues let their dough rise in a place that was too warm, causing the dough to "weep" butter.  Overall, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have tried this recipie with every different sugar I could think of and the best I found was to take some raw sugar, spread it on a parchment covered cookie sheet.  Drizzle a couple teaspoons of boiling water over it and mix in until sugar is clumpy.  Throw in a hot oven for 3 or 4 minutes until it gets sizzly and then toss around with the parchment paper to break into small clumps. I paid about 12 bucks for the larsens sugar and was really dissapointed. We got these at Bruxies for $4 each, but my homemade with raw sugar are much better!

Excellent recipe.  Taste just like the liege waffles we get at a local restaurant.  But they charge $3 a piece to take theirs home frozen!  I couldn't find any Belgian pearl sugar locally so I took a tip from YouTube and used a manual hand-crank nut grinder to grind sugar cubes into small nuggets.  It worked perfectly and is much cheaper than the pearl sugar.  You NEED to make these waffles!

Thank you sooooo much for this recipe!    I was an exchange student in Belgium over 15 years ago and haven't had one of these since.  These turned out just as I remebered them.    I carmelized sugar as suggested by the previous reviewer as I wanted to make them right away and they turned out great.  My entire family is in love with them.

really really good. I found the pearl sugar at an international store yesterday and had to try them.  They were so similar to the ones we had in Belgium.  I think next time I'll increase the salt and the vanilla just to enhance the flavor.   I served them plain and with only 4 of us here, there was only 1 left over.  Next time I may serve them with ice cream for dessert.

Two types of pearl sugar. You should use Belgian not Scandinavian. Belgian softens and carmelizes whereas other pearl sugar remains hard.

Perfect!!  Wanted to make some authentic Belgian waffles and this recipe was easy (as compared to some others I found on the internet).  I had sugar cubes, so smashed them into little chunks the size of raisins, and it worked great instead of the pearl sugar.  Nothing needed to be changed.  Remember these are sweeter than normal waffles,and yeast gives them a moist yet crumbly texture- so don't expect it do be like an eggo waffle.  Next time I will make dough in advance and refrigerate overnight so as to speed up the process in the am.  One review said butter was too much- I disagree.  It was perfect- again- these are real Belgian waffles so the excess butter when you cook them is normal.  My waffle iron did get greasy, but I never needed to spray the waffle iron!  I think the butter aided in having the sugar caramalize on the waffle.  Again, can't compare it to the traditional American waffle.  Even my kids agreed, no syrup needed.  Next time I must make a fresh fruit topping for these.  Also, I thought these were better when cooled- complete opposite of the "eggo" type.  Can't wait to make these again!

These were enjoyed by the kids as well as the adults.  I only had 3/4 cup butter and they came out delicious with a crispy outside and a chewy, tender crumb.  This is a keeper!

OMG!!! This is EXACTLY like the waffles we eat here in Belgium.  I would not change a thing.  For those having problems with them being too greasy or with the butter seeping out while they are baking try putting the dough balls in the refrigeration for at least an hour if not longer and then bake .  I did notice the dough was a bit too greasy after it had risen, so I added my pearl sugar, made balls and then set them in the refrigerator for about an hour and a half then baked them.  I am so happy we have pearl sugar here.  :))  This is approved by a Belgian.  If you haven't tried this recipe you should.

I have made these once before as recommended with just a bit less butter and they turned out really good.  I can't stand when people rate lesser stars because they changed or modified the recipe, thus the five stars.

This is a really good start for a Liege Waffle in my opinion.  I've tried a few recipes now.  There's another one on a very long blog that's also good, but I question whether that recipe author really understands baking because that recipe is way over complicated - much more than it needs to be.  

When I do this recipe now, I make very early or the night before.  I do think that in order to really replicate a Belgian Waffle, the dough needs to be chilled for a period of time.  

I made this early this AM and divided onto a greased cookie sheet and refrigerated for a couple hours (better if all night).  Pull the cookie sheet out for about 30 minutes before making the waffles.  This turns out a lot more like a true Belgian waffle (I was just there last month and ate a lot of the "real deals").

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would. These are the most AMAZING waffles I have ever eaten!!! Also, I couldn't find hail sugar around me and wanted to make them quickly, so I used a generic equivalent to sugar in the raw or turbanado with superb results. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it is terrific!!!!

The closest recipes that I have found to the authentic waffles on the streets of Brussels. I made a 7 Serving batch. I used 2+ cups of King Arthur Bread flour, I added a tbs of Honey, 2 tsp of Vanilla, and decreased the butter to 3 tbs, which ended up being not enough. They still came out very good. I will try again and add more butter. Shh! Do not tell my wife!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have sugar pearls and couldn't find them locally, so instead, I bought a box of sugar cubes, put them in a plastic bag and pounded them with a rolling pin until I had pearl sized sugar pieces.  I used a sieve to sort out the pieces from the loose sugar and a box made about 1 1/2 cup pieces and a half cup of loose sugar.  I did find that keeping the waffle maker on medium and cooking them for about 4-4 1/2 minutes each made for an evenly browned waffle and minimal butter loss. Keep in mind, I don't have a fancy waffle maker, just a simple little round Oster waffle iron that I bought at Kmart for $18. The pearls would have been best, but they came out nice and crisp, buttery and with the sugar in nice little lumps all over.

I took the loose sugar from above and made an almond sour cream filling with 16 oz sour cream, 1/4c sugar(approx.- sweeten to taste), 1 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I also made a berry topping with approx 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 cup blackberries, 1 cup blueberries, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  I cooked the berries until they boiled- pureed the mixture and added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and then cooked it on low until thickened.  All together it made a fantastic brunch dish!

Great.  I substituted hard old brown sugar (as hard as a rock) that I broke up to small bits for the pearl sugar.  I got the caramelization effect that was desired.  My wife said after her first bite, "why don't more people make waffles like this?'  Very good.

Made this once trying to work around not having the pearl sugar - it was OK.  With the pearl sugar, AMAZING!  I followed the recipe exactly and let it rise in my oven preheated for standard proofing.  Might try rapid proof temp next time or give it a few extra minutes.  I used a Waring iron that rotates to make two waffles at a time.  Heat was set on 4.3 or so.  Cleaning caramelized sugar out of the iron afterwards was a bit messy - but the results are so worth it.  I think I like the waffles best at room temp (gives the sugar a chance to solidify a bit).  Definitely no syrup needed!  I got the pearl sugar from Black Tie Mercantile on Amazon.  It was the most expensive bag of sugar I ever bought but I would do it again!

Amazeballs!  Love it!  Haven't tried sugar pearls yet and have to crush up sugar cubes, but it works!  I would recommend reheating in a toaster or oven, never in the microwave as they will be soft and the yeast flavor will come out too strong.  Doesn't even need syrup!

I LOVE this recipe! It turned out great, even the first time I tried it. I used crushed sugar cubes because I couldn't find pearl sugar. I will order some pearl sugar to use next time, but I really loved it just fine the way it was.

In the last few years, I've made this recipe over 10 times. Last Christmas, I made over 80 of them as presents. When I first started, I used the Swedish pearl sugar because that's all I could get my hands on and they were great. Last year I was able to order some Belgian pearl sugar online (and now it's available on Amazon as well) and they weren't necessarily any better but they were different in a good way. I don't change anything about the recipe though I occasionally add walnuts. To get consistent sizes, I cut my dough in half until I have 16 balls. Just to get things started, I spray my waffle iron with a little coconut oil before the first waffles go in but after that the butter takes care of things.  I can't recommend these enough.

Amazing ! These taste just like the ones I had as a kid from some missionaries in Belgium.  The hardest part was making the pearl sugar. And a little tip with  waffle maker clean up. You will have carmalized and burnt sugar in the maker. The easiest was to clean it is to let it harden in the grill.   Then turn it on high for  10 to 20 second and ALL the sugar will just peel out like taffy. And
 it taste great to after it hardends reminds me of creme Brule sugar.

This recipe was surprisingly less difficult than I thought it would be.  The waffles turned out with a great level of crispiness, sweetness, and that delicious yeasty flavor.  However, my waffles leaked butter everywhere, so I think next time I will cut the butter down to one and a half or maybe even just one stick of butter.  Otherwise, everything was delicious.  I may try the turbinado sugar or the sugar cubes next time to see how close to this it turns out, as the pearl sugar is a little on the pricey side.

I made these waffles today for a pot luck brunch. I'd been wanting to make liege waffles since I had them at a ski resort in Tahoe.  The other recipes I saw online looked too difficult or too plain, and this one struck the perfect balance.  For me, the hardest part of the recipe was letting the dough rise in 80 deg temperature.  I ended up putting a space heater in my bathroom and cranking it up to make it warm enough.  After the first 30 mins the dough hadn't risen, so I turned the heater to blow directly on the bowl, and 20 minutes later it had risen!

One of my favorite things about these waffles are how little mess they make!  The firm ball of dough cooks into a waffle without spilling all over the counter.

My waffle iron (Krugs belgian waffle maker) doesn't have a temperature setting, and I don't think the sugar melted quite enough, but the waffles were still delicious!

These were delicious and exactly how I was hoping they would turn out.  Very soft and dense on the inside, with a crunchy sugary exterior. I used a large crystal turbinado sugar and it worked perfectly (I mixed one cup into the dough and then sprinkled the rest evenly on top before pressing the iron down).  They were very buttery but it made clean-up a breeze since the crystalized sugar on the waffle iron just slid right off.  So much better than a regular waffle, and great to eat just as-is.  I also froze some and reheated in the oven and they may have even been better!

Nice recipe but it took me a long time to find the pearl sugar in Australia. I finally found "Swaffels" online http://swaffels.com/pearl_sugar.html
Perhaps this will help some of your Aussie cooks!

This recipe is an ok one when I couldn't find the one I usually use. Tip: if you don't have or can't find pearl sugar you can crush up sugar cubes in a bag with a rolling pin.

Made these for my husband and nephews (9 & 13) and we loved them! I used an ice cream scoop to get a good size ball of dough into the Belgian waffle maker. The recipe was easy to make and we used all ingredients but I cut the pearl sugar in half because we put Nutella, or cinnamon w/whipped cream or berries and whipped cream on top. We still had plenty of sweet, crunchy bits throughout the waffles. Fantastic and everyone would eat it again.

My third Liège waffle recipe and the others were nowhere as good.  This is so close to the street-market waffles I just had in Belgium that I am ecstatic.  Anyone know where to buy pearl sugar cheap?

OMG!!!  This was an amazing recipe!!!  My children inhaled these waffles.  Santa was kind enough to put a Belgian waffle iron under the Christmas tree this year ;-) and since then, I've been on a mission to find the best waffle recipes ever!  This is one of my top 2 recipes that our family of 5 loves.

I did have to splurge by buying the sugar on Amazon, but it made the waffle.  I went ahead and bought 10 pounds, because I figured it won't go bad.  The kids loved the sugar in the waffles so much, (and by itself it's fun to eat) I had to hide the bag so I have it for the waffles!

I think the only thing I would do differently is to slightly stretch the dough into a Frisbee shape when placing it on the iron.  The waffle ends up being larger and isn't quite so dense.

Overall, amazing recipe!!

Followed directions exactly but used half the butter, 1 cup is just too much. This was perfect. After allowing the dough to rise you pour in the Dutch sugar pearls. Don't use the Swedish pearls which are a smaller granular. I thought it was weird pouring I gravel size sugar into the dough, but the waffle iron melts the sugar through the waffle. It took a couple of waffles to get the right temp. Just one below medium heat. The waffles should be dense on the outside and moist on the inside and the sugar melted through!!!! I'm trying the other recipe found on google. Takes 2 days to make, several dough rise and refrigeration steps to do. Happy waffleling!!

Tasted like waffle truck waffles! They were dee-lish! My favorite way to top them is cookie butter (or biscoff), bananas, fresh whipped cream, and a caramel drizzle.  If you need more ideas for amazing toppings check out waffle crush, waffle love, and waffle bliss.

Really easy, dad , and so delicious!! I decreased the butter by a third and would still decrease it more, it was so rich.  The dough was a softer dough than the overnight recipes I have used in the past, but so much better tasting.  I had bought Lars sugar pearls at ikea.

Love this recipe.  I use this (with less sugar) for my waffles n' chicken combo.  The steps are extremely important to follow and having pearl sugar absolutely makes a difference in caramelization of the sugar on the surface.

Really great result. I used Swedish pearl sugar found at an Eastern European grocer, but I think 
Ikea stocks  too. All-clad waffle iron worked a treat. I let the dough sit longer than the recipe stated but only because we were not ready to make them yet.  No issue with leaking butter either. I would suggest the iron itself has to be able to  really heat up hot, and a generic waffle maker just cannot do that. 
Flavour was excellent!

I make this vegan, super delicious. My suggestion: don’t add the pearl sugar until you’re ready to cook, it will dissolve into the dough and won’t caramelize the surface of the waffle.

Excellent waffles, just like in Bruges!Now, IF you don’t use all your dough, bake the dough balls at 400F for 25 minutes (dark golden brown). Incredible sweet rolls. You’re welcome.

Made this exactly as directed. As I folded in the sugar I thought it looked like a lot compared to similar recipes I've tried...about 50% more with less of everything else. Oddly enough, they didn't seem to be any sweeter. I will reduce the sugar to about 1 cup next time. The extra sugar made much more of a mess in my waffle iron and left a pretty hard sugar crust on the waffles, otherwise I might have given this 5 stars. Overall good flavor and texture. I will try this recipe again with less sugar.

These waffles are amazing!  We ate them plain, and it was fantastic.  I did also have butter leaking out onto my waffle iron, even after refrigerating the dough to try to prevent it.  I will probably cut back on the butter next time by a bit - maybe decrease to 3/4c.  Even with the butter leakage, they are SO GOOD!!!

I love love LOVED this recipe! my husband was a big fan too! The waffle is sweet enough to eat alone if you don't have any toppings. It is even better with some whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries on top! the texture is crisp on the outside and soft inside. The instructions were pretty straightforward even for a novice in the kitchen like me. will be adding this one to the books!

I didn't have pearl sugar, so I ground up pure maple candies (the ones in the shape of maple leaves) and added brown sugar. Amazing! These were such a hit!

Super easy.  We have a restaurant here that does a waffle with goat cheese, bacon, basil and an egg (over easy or sunny side up) all on top,  served with maple syrup.  It was way expensive to add the bacon, so I thought I could do it myself - it was fabulous!  I just followed the recipe until the pearl sugar part and then put the goat cheese, bacon, and egg on top then garnished with thin sliced basil leaves and topped with syrup - my family loved it and it was cheap and easy!

I agree with another review, there is too much oil. My dough also started seeping as I was using it.
I reduced the Pearl sugar to 1 cup, as the pearl size I had was on the larger side, and In glad I did. It was plenty. The waffles came out tasty, but also more fragile than other recipes I've used. Great for the relatively quick rise time, and pretty nice end result overall. I hope they freeze well.

I’ve made these many times, so much that I’ve killed 2 electric waffle makers! (Now I’m using a non electric stove top aluminum waffle iron)

I reduce the sugar amount to  just 1/2c of pearl sugar for perfectly sweet waffles. They freeze well too!

Delicious! Turned out perfect even though I didn't have quite enough pearl sugar I substituted the rest with turbinado sugar crystals and they still turned out great.  I'll definitely make these again!

I’m married to a Belgian and we visit the county often. These were authentic, divine and are pretty easy to make. I made the recipe exactly as written with the addition of putting dough balls back in fridge to firm up the butter before cooking. These were so yummy guys. Make them!!!!! I’m thinking new x mas morning treat!

I made these with diy pearl sugar. Wasn’t that hard to make. Drizzle these with chocolate and put raspberries and whipped cream on them as a topping!

Great waffle recipe! We wanted a sweet Belgian waffle and this is definitely it. It does take a bit of planning ahead but was good for a lazy Saturday. We didn't want too many waffles since it was just my husband and I that would be eating them so we halved the recipe. Turned out great with my husband making the pearl sugar (not sure which recipe he used but I know it was normal white sugar in it).

I think it was way too much butter - dripping with oil.  Would definitely reduce the butter.  The waffle dried out after just one day.

Not a fan of standard waffle recipes, but the sugar in this (purchased on Amazon) makes all the difference. I can eat these plain with no toppings and they’re delicious. The recipe is also very easy to follow, and besides waiting for the dough to double in size is finished rather quickly.

I didn’t like them. I prefer a waffle that is tender, I found these tough. The amount of butter called for was crazy, I reduced it. That may have affected the texture, but regardless there is too much butter so I won’t make them again.

I lived in Belgium and fell in love with these. The local waffle food trucks do a decent job but this recipe is better. I didn't change a thing, used Belgian pearl sugar from Amazon and we got 7 great gauffres de Liège. Merci!

We found these more dense than we like but the flavor is good. I prefer them without syrup as they are very sweet with the caramelized sugar. I made them the night before and left mine to rise at room temp and then let them finish rising in the fridge. Not sure if that made the difference, but we are also at a high altitude, which may have also played a factor (around 7000 ft). They are easy to make but I would give it five stars if they weren’t so dense. We prefer ours light and crispy.

It really needs 1/2 tsp cinnamon, but otherwise, it's a winner. Very similar to the waffles we enjoyed in Liege.

They did not come out as I expected. They were too dense and cakey. Nothing like the real thing! I made the recipe twice with the same mediocre results. Any suggestions?

Prepared exactly according to recipe.  These are so good the really don't even need anything on them.  Yeasty and sweeter than the regular type waffle mix.  It's more of a dough than a batter.  Just carry on.  They do not fill the waffle iron pad to the edges due to the doughy texture.  These are delish!!  Well worth the extra time.

I'm still eating it and cooking as I type this. This is an amazing recipe. I'm eating them plain but will probably be eating this all day. Got the sugar off of Amazon and think this recipe is 100% accurate! Love love love them

I've never tried Belgian Waffles before.  I picked one up at a local juice bar for breakfast and I was hooked!  I knew there had to be a recipe out there.  I made about 20 waffles for the price of 1 waffle at the store!  I froze most of them and take one out for work when needed.  Going to try sugar cubes  instead of pearl sugar next time.  Thank you!!

I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup half-n-half. I also left the dough overnight to rise. My husband and kids love them. They were crunchy outside and chewy inside.

These were very good.  I used this recipe, but with bread flour and a different  technicue based on a Belgian man I saw make them.  I used instant yeast and combined that with the flour, sugar, and salt.  Added softened butter to that in pieces then the milk then the eggs and then the vanilla.  I did need a bit more flour though. After the rise I added the hail/pearl sugar in mixer with dough hook on low.  Divided into 10 portions on a sheet pan then refrigerated for 20 min before cooking.  Had no problem with oozing butter.   Would definitely make agin!  Found the sugar on Amazon.

Just like I remember from my time stationed in Belgium. I made my own pearl sugar by adding a tablespoon of water to 3/4 cup of sugar and cooking on the stovetop on low setting for about 30 minutes to clump the sugar.

Delish!!  I used instant active dry yeast/bread machine yeast.  I halfed the yeast.  So yummy with cookie butter and whipped cream.  Oh and I did not have any pearl sugar, I just made without and it still was yummy.  I am sure it would be better with it, but just put on more cookie butter.  :)

Tasted great just like the Leige waffle place I like to visit. I used a regular waffle iron and would think it works better with a Belgian waffle maker. The only challenge I had was having to rinse off the iron after every waffle batch because melted sugar and butter were burning.

Taste is delicious! However, what am I doing wrong? I always need to add extra flour to make it a dough. It's just batter when I follow the recipe. Not judging the recipe on my situatio.  5 stars!!!!

I loved the recipe but found that I could use a little less butter (3/4 cups) and it turned out just as good. A little lighter in fact. 

Also, I couldn't find pearl sugar so I bought sugar cubes and crumbled them with a meat tenderizer. This worked perfectly. No need to go find fancy pearl sugar or make your own on the stove when you can just smash some sugar cubes. 

This recipe however is delicious. Now one of my favorite desert recipes.

I made the dough and then after it rose, I put it in fridge till morning.  Dough was very stiff and I had ti fold in sugar by hand.  I got 8 balls out of it, but the waffles did not impress me.

The family loved it, but it did offer a few challenges while baking.
It's relatively easy to overfill the waffle iron, so I actually reduced the amount of dough.
I guess a baseball size chunk will be for very big waffle irons.

Over the concerns of too much fat, I reduced the amount of butter by around 15%.

I tried this recipe after attempting another recipe which required a lot more time.  This recipe was so much easier to follow and the results were so much better.  They taste amazing and I would make them over and over again.  The only change was that I used turbinado sugar instead and I used only 3/4 cup.  They probably could have been less sweet, but my husband and I loved them and I can't wait to make them for our children.

I was initially worried as they looked like they were going to turn out heavy, but instead they turned out perfect. Children approved and this recipe will take its place amongst our regular Sunday morning rotation.

I made this recipe in a Gluten Free version for my daughter who has Celiac disease.  The end result was yummy!  They aren't as light  but I wouldn't expect them to be.  They have the golden crust and the sugar bits that make them just delicious.  I was very pleased!   I will say that I read some of the previous reviews and did cut the butter down to 1 stick (1/2 c) and the pearl sugar down to 1 heaping cup.  This worked well for us.  Plenty of butter to crisp up and keep things from sticking and enough sugar to add the crunch without being overwhelming.  Easy to follow instructions cap off a great waffle experience!

These are very rich, but very delicious.    I needed to add an extra half cup of flour, and I used Lars Belgium pearl sugar; which I found on Amazon.

Too buttery - it oozed out everywhere. Too much sugar, was very sweet. Possibly a recipe that could be tweaked, but as is - not a keeper. Thanks.

Excellent! This is the second Liège waffle recipe I've tried and it turned out much better than the other. I'm not sure if it helped that I accidentally heated the milk, sugar, yeast mix more than the recipe said, but it helped bind all the other ingredients together which was a problem with my last recipe. These were delicious and we all agreed they were better than the local restaurant's version that we sought to copycat. Definitely keeping this recipe!!

Good, but overly sweet. I used my grandmother's very old waffle iron and they came out crisp. (Cleaning the 75 year old iron was a bit more than I had planned on, but I do love that waffle iron!). I'll keep this recipe, but will keep looking for perfection. We ate them with fresh strawberries, the Cadbury version of Nutella, and real maple syrup. (not all three  toppings at once. )

Made these exactly to the recipe, with the Lars Belgian pearl sugar. Used a George Forman grill on a med-high setting. So delicious. It was a test batch for an upcoming brunch party, my husband and I ate them with whip cream while standing over the grill waiting for the next batch to be done. Super rich, but so good. Definitely more of a dessert.

These waffles are so good. I made 300 for my sisters wedding and have made them several times since. They are always enjoyed by people. They cook nicely and they do well even if you prepare the dough the night before.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I let the dough rise over night.  I would say add the sugar in first as the dough gets very bready and is hard to mix the pearl sugar in after its risen.  I also added only about a half cup of the sugar and it worked beautifully and was still plenty sweet.  We tend not to like an overly sweet anything!  Fantastic recipe as is.

Years ago, a new mall opened close to our house in Irondequoit NY. There was a little red English delivery van there that had been converted to a Belgian Waffle concession. I fell in love at first bite, and used to make excuses to "go to the mall" so I could sneak a snack. Unfortunately the owner closed up after a year or so. Years later while in Brussels I found my wonderful waffles again... just like I had loved back at home. I tried this recipe today, and it was perfect!! I tried chopping sugar cubes to make the pearl sugar... a real pain to get 1-1/2 cups worth. I think I'll order pearl sugar for my next batch (oh yes, there WILL be a next batch!!)

Excellent recipe followed exactly as directed. FYI, Lar's Own pearl sugar is available at Sur la Table stores.

Excellent! I finally had the pearl sugar and that recipe did the rest. I put raspberries and whip cream. Heaven :-)

Great recipe. First time making these and whole family is addicted. Did not have pearl sugar handy so chopped up a bunch of sugar cubes. Worked great!

Good! The first time i tried making these i didnt have any pearl sugar, so i followed some of the alternatives from the reviews and my waffle didnt turn out great. Once i found my hands on some pearl sugar, the texture and taste was perfect! I'd also suggest adding 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the 10 waffle serving.

I'm sure this recipe is great, but I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  The result was a very grainy and yeasty tasting waffle.  While the pearl sugar does sweeten the waffles, I'm not a fan of how they came out with whole wheat flour.  I'll update my review the next time I make it.  :)

not great, too thick with too little egg and I didn't get the crispy shell to form on the outside.
