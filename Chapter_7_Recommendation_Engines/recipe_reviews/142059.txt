OMG! If you love Cobb Salad this sandwich is for you! Definitely toast the bread to avoid sogginess. I used light mayo and homemade bleu cheese dressing. This was a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken. All I added was thin sliced tomato and red onion. Anytime you combine bacon and avocado you have a hit in my book! Next time I want to try this using tortillas instead of bread and make it into a wrap. Great recipe!

Very good recipe! I did make one change because I wanted to have lunch pretty much prepared for a few friends. I made a chicken salad with all the ingredients except the avocado. To avoid browning, I sliced the avocado just before serving and fanned a few slices across the top of the sandwich. 

This "chicken salad" received rave reviews.

Made this for hubby and he absolutely loved it! No changes made with the exception of toasting the bread to keep it from getting soggy. Thank you Lydia, super idea and recipe!!

I would definitely recommend this if you are having some friends over for a nice lunch.  I would go a little lighter on the mayo. but it is certainly great!  Enjoy!

This is a great sandwich. I this past February, I made a similar one for my daughter's baby shower.  I also wanted the work done ahead of time. I used poached boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced thinly, sliced the avacodos and submerged them in lemon juice and little water then used the rest if the ingredients and put them in flour tortilla wraps.  I wrapped them well, refrigerated them and then took them out the next day, sliced them in half and served.  They held up pretty well overnight and the guests loved them.

this sounded wonderful until i saw it had 57 grams of fat, 11 of them saturated. that is just way to much for a basic chicken sandwich. think i'll pass.  i gave it 5 stars because it did sound wonderful

This reminds me of a recipe I have enjoyed for a long time. Mine is a "club" and has no chicken. It's three slices of toasted whole grain white bread and also has thinly sliced red onion and tomato.  It's a keeper!

I didn't know Linda made this recipe recently?  What a coincidence!  We had this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  I also toasted the bread to avoid it being soggy.  I added a sliced tomato to the sandwich ingredients and omitted the mayo, but that was it.  Everything else was as written.  The blue cheese dressing made the sandwich....so good.  It truly tasted like a cobb salad.

Great recipe. I forgot the lettuce leaf, but no one really noticed. Everyone questioned why I was putting egg on it, but loved the result! We all enjoyed it and I have a couple of picky eaters.... ;-)

My absolute favourite sandwich, a little twist on an old classic club sandwich. I know you'll love it. My super picky husband did.

I modified this just now b/c I didn't have all the ingredients. I LOVE avocado but didn't have any on hand. I used a low carb tortilla wrap instead of bread and used turkey instead of chicken. I didn't have lettuce, so I omitted that. This was delicious. I can't wait to try it again in a wrap + lettuce/avocado!

Delicious! Great way to get your Cobb salad fix while trying something different. I had to use turkey lunch meat instead of the chicken and I added tomato slices, which I think are a must for this sandwich.

I agree it was a lot of work for a sandwich, but it was very filling and delicious! I used less mayo and more blue cheese dressing than the receipe called for, and it was still a bit too much mayo. It overpowered the sandwich. I tried it as a wrap in a tortilla, and I enjoyed it even more!

Very good sandwich with all of the traditional Cobb Salad ingredients.  It could use a flavor boost with the addition of onions or black olives.  I made my own blue cheese dressing using "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing" recipe from this site.  It was the perfect choice.  Since the dressing recipe uses a lot of mayo, I used it as is and did not add the additional mayo called for in this recipe.

I served these to my family on toasted multi-grain thin buns and everybody raved about them!  I can hardly wait to make them again.  I grilled the chicken breasts and then sliced them on the diagonal, and I sliced the eggs instead of chopping them.  Sliced honeydew melon on the side made this just right.

Great sandwich!  I made a few changes due to personal taste-no blue cheese or egg and I mashed up the avocado and added a bit of mayo to make it a creamy texture.  I used provolone cheese too!  I added some spiced to the chicken for some added heat!  We will definitely make again soon!

Oh my goodness!!!! This is soooo yummy! I went with sandwich flats instead of regular bread. I did add tomato. Just try it! If you like the salad you'll love this! Even my 6 year old ate it with avacado and all!!!!!

One of the best recipes I have made in a long time!!  I was unsure of how all of these ingredients would taste together but the combo was WONDERFUL.  The sandwich tasted so fresh.  It will be a great picnic/summer sandwich (even though it is a little messy).
