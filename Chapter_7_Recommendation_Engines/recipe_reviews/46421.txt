The best veggie chili ever!  Great consistency.  I consider this a very sweet chili, so next time I might decrease use less splenda.  Makes a big pot.  So good!

thought this was great!  the only change I made was to reduce the splenda by 1/2 as suggested by others...also didn't have any cayenne pepper, so it wasn't spicy, but the chili pepper was enough for us...really loved the flavor the balsamic vinegar gave it...will definately make again...

I used this recipie in a recent chili cookoff and won 1st place! No one knew it was vegetarian and I even threw in some soy "meat" to make it more "chili like." :) It was a hit!

I have been eating this chili for lunch all week - it is great on top of rice, baked potato, even butternut squash, spicy but not too hot.  I only added 1/4 c splenda - still thought it was too sweet but let it sit overnight as recommended and the sweeetness went away.  Love that a serving has 10 grams of fiber.

This is the most delicious chili I've had!  I added black beans, kidney beans and navy beans for a little different coloration.  Terrific.

Very good!  I cut the Splenda in half, didn't want it too sweet, and it came out perfect.  I added a little cayenne too, as suggested, to make it hotter.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Excellent recipe!

These was the best vegetarian chili I have ever had - I shared with all of my friends. I am not a vegetarian, but will never eat regular chili again! I did leave the splenda out and served over white rice with cheddar cheese on top - We loved it!

This dish was delicious - my family loved it.  We're not true vegetarians, however, so I used ground turkey. Thanks for great recipe.  I will use it again and again this winter.

Very good.  Definetly does not need any sweetner though.  I put it in a slow cooker for about 6 hrs, and it turned out great.

I did adjust it a little as I did not have a jalepeno. I used one red, yellow, and orange peppers. I did not have cayenne pepper so I added cumin (must have for chili) and taco seasoning. I also did not put as much splenda in as called for and only used black beans as that was all I had. I love white corn so added an additional cup. I also added tomato sauce and a little bit of water.

This was a great one!! Even my dad liked it who is used to having meat in his chili. I did make a few changes.... I didnt use any sugar- it was sweet enough already. I also added more veggies. I doubled the peppers and added squash and zucchini too. I also added about a 1/2 cup of dijon mustard to spice it up a bit b/c I only had a little bit of chili powder. I will make this one again!!!

This is a flavorful and fresh alternative to bland chili in a can, and my roomates didn't even realize it was vegetarian until about halfway through the bowl.

Awesome chili recipe!! I think this may be the best one I ever had! I added a dollop of sour cream to my bowl as well as fresh chopped cilantro. So good!

This is excellent. I only used half of the spices and it was still really hot; next time I will only use a fourth of the amounts. I used 1/4 C. sugar instead of 1/2 C. Splenda. I also omitted the balsamic vinegar (didn’t have any), one can of kidney beans (to make less chili) and corn (don’t like corn in chili). The bell peppers and jalapeño give it a great flavor.

I drained some of the bean liquid so it wasn't too soupy and added four little packets of splenda. It was delicious and tastes even better when it sits a day or two!
