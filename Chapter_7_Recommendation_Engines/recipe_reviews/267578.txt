I suggest you watch the video first. The recipe calls for a whole uncooked chicken and shows how to cut the breast to make this dish. Of course , then you will have the rest of the chicken to use for another purpose. Use your finger to loosen the skin on the breast.

Haven't made it but it looks wonderful! I remember flying in my "good" clothes and having actual knives and forks with actual plates and real food.  I love this!

I don't understand this recipe.  It calls for a rotisserie chicken.  Isn't that a fully cooked chicken - available at many groceries and Costco?  I didn't make.

I’ve been purchasing the cut from  the chef at our county club for the past several months. It’s my favorite cut of chicken. I reduce chicken stock and add 1/2 cup dry white wine to pan sauce. Makes a beautiful presentation at a dinner party. I will add cayenne next time. Thanks for bringing Back my favorite cut of chicken!

Best ever and I'm a roast chicken nut. Chef John made carving the Frenched ( Airline ) cut from the whole chicken look simple, but, clutz that I am, I struggled with it.  I'll keep at it though. Besides the taste, the presentation is awesome.

Great video, Thanks for bring back a old memory! It has been years, but  I used to make these about 50 at a time when I went to chef school for the food line, but with a red bell pepper sauce back in '95-'97. They always sold out! and you can use the wing bone as a handle! I just happen to have a whole chicken defrosting rite now. Inspiration!

I used a poultry seasoning that had all the spices suggested by your chef.  Yes I saved the recipe to use again.

Can honestly say this one came out looking (and hopefully tasting) just like it shows in the video. Only change was to use Italian seasoning in place of herbs de Provence since I had none. I highly suggest watching the video to understand the technique of removing the breast, the directions are confusing at best and also omit the vinegar he uses to emulsify the pan sauce. I used a heavy aluminum pan to get a nice sear on the skin, cooked to 160 and it was juicy and perfect!

Literally the best chicken I've ever eaten!  Not sure if it was due to the high quality chicken I bought from the butcher or due to Chef John's pan sauce method, but it was amazing.  Give it a try!

I used two bone in chicken breasts, removed the bones  (didn't have the wing drumette part). EVOO, S&P and parsley flakes. After frying on both sides, had to put in 350 oven 'til it got to temp (maybe 10 minutes?).  Very good, but I could not fry them until done, they would have been burnt. Made a pan sauce with chicken broth and butter.
