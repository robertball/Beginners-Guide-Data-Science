I wanted a smoother consistancy--I ran the cottage cheese through the blender before mixing it with the Jello. I used sugar free Jello and "lite" whipped topping. I only had one big container, I used that instead of three small containers. My family loved this salad. My husband loves ambrosia but he dosen't care for coconut--he ate THREE BOWLS of this salad!

After mixing everything together and tasting it, I thought 24 ounces of whipped topping was too much, but it was too late. So in addition to the recipe, I added another can of mandarin oranges and a can of chunk pineapple. I also added extra chopped walnuts. It finally met my taste test. Next time I will follow the recipe but add only 16 oz of whipped topping, and maybe more cottage cheese for a chunkier consistency. It is a very good salad, very ambrosia like.

I made sure to use 4% cottage cheese since I like the thicker consistency . This recipe is a keeper.

This is second time I've made it. People said that the liked it didn't taste as sweet as some other "Hawaiian salads" they've had. I used strawberry/banana jello the first time and raspberry the second time. light cottage cheese and whip topping. I did not use nuts either time, but did add coconut shreds and mini marshmallows. Next time I will add the nuts too and report back. My dad and I agreed we could sit and eat the whole bowl in one sitting.
