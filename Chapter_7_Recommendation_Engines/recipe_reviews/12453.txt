This is a very good pie and it does taste simalar to pecan pie. I have used white syrup in this in the past but the dark cornsyrup is better. Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent oatmeal pie! I wasn't sure how it would come out as the filling was more runny than I am used too but I baked for 40 minutes in a 10-inch pie pan and it came out perfect.
