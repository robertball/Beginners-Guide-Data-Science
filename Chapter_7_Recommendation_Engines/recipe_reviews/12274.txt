I made the mistake of using phyllo shells and the filling just soaked into them.  I can't recalll seeing 3" tart shells so I will have to look for these next time.  (Frozen or not?) Also, I did bake some of the filling in a small glass dish, since the shells didn't work, and I don't think it tasted rich or creamy the way I was hoping.  This  recipe sounds delicious but needs a little tweakin.

These tarts were quick and easy.  The filling only filled 9 tart shells, but they were great.  Would definitely make again.

I love the taste of cappuccino, but this was too coffee flavored and I only used 3 TBSP of coffee liquere. Next time I will try using less coffee crystals and I think it will be fine.

These tarts were very good and very easy to make.  I confess I was a little intimidated by the egg tempering process but it turned out to be incredibly easy.

There tarts turned out to be very tender and flavorful.  They are well worth the time and effort it takes.
