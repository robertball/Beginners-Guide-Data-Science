This was yummy!  In texture, it is very similar to a coffee cake.  Since other reviewers were having trouble with their apples sinking, I chose to grate mine- this worked perfectly.  Also- I did not have any OJ on hand so I subbed lemon juice which worked out just fine as well.  We made a homemade caramel sauce to drizzle over the top- everyone enjoyed this and we will make it again.  Thanks!

The 4 apples were so heavy they sank to the bottom, this spoiled the looks and texture of the cake. I will try it again with my own changes to the recipe.

Well, I think four apples are too much apples, and I have to say that due to the amount of mixture I had, I had to do two cakes instead of one. The apples coates weighed too much and went to the bottom of the baking tin, and got stuck. However my friends loved it!!! Really tasty.

Fairly simple, and pretty tasty.  Didn't seem to have enough batter.  The layers of cake batter were pretty thin.  I really wasn't sure about the whole Tablespoon of vanilla, could this be a mistake?  I used only a teaspoon, (it was pure vanilla) and seemed to be fine.  Other than that, loved it!
