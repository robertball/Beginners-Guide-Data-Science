Simple and delicious. I used a bag of cut up peas and carrots I had in the freezer--they worked just fine. I probably used more canola oil than I was supposed to, but it wasn't greasy so that worked. I've made fried rice a bunch of times and couldn't find any of the recipes I already tried, but I don't care. I'm going to use this one from now on!

Used a bag of frozen oriental veggies instead of the peas/carrots/corn. Pre-peeled shrimp makes it even faster. Also used brown rice. It was easy and delicious.

It’s become a “keeper” in my family. Shared it with in-laws and they are now fans too. Didn’t modify the recipe but did add a little soy sauce to my plate afterwards.
