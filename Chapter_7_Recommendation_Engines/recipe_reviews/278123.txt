Love it!  Easy and forgiving recipe, you can make it just about any way you want and it will be delicious.  The only change I made was I used the full 12 oz of chorizo, can't imagine it would have been good enough with just 4 oz!  

Next time, we are putting diced and seeded jalapenos in as well.  Easy and delicious layered dip that is delicious right out of the skillet!
