Sometimes you win with untested recipes, sometimes you lose. Let's just say I didn't win on this one. As the first reviewer of this recipe, I had no warnings or tips to go by, yet I think I should have known this would flop. With pudding, yogurt and then a whole can of coconut milk, I think I should have recognized that it was all just too much for one little ol' cake mix to support! The result was heavy and dense, almost wet, with no crumb to speak of and barely resembled cake. Perhaps this is what the submitter intended? As for the frosting, I didn't even try it. I knew a mere cup of confectioners' sugar for one package of cream cheese just wasn't going to work. I opted to use another cream cheese frosting recipe but it didn't matter as the entire cake, with all its many ingredients, was tossed.

I made this recipe into cupcakes. Flavor is great but the cupcakes sunk in the middle and they also shrunk. I'm not sure if the same thing happens when it's made into a cake. If I were to make the recipe again (as cupcakes) I would remove one egg and reduce the amount of yogurt to be more inline with the wet ingredients called for on the box.

I'm going to have to thumb this recipe down, . . . it  has  real problems.  I made it as a 9" x 13" sheet cake( like the pic shows),  and the  cake rose nicely, but later, totally collapsed .   Unlike another reviewer with dramatic  literary license,  my budget NEVER  allows food to be wasted and "tossed".  
 I did eat it, but I would never serve it to guests.

I made it with sour cream instead of yogurt. It was amazing.

I made a few cupcakes and they all sunk in in the middle - fail.  Used the rest to make 2 round cakes and they are hardly cake-like.
