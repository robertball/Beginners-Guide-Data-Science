This review is for the cake only as I did not make the filling or frosting. The cake is delicious - perfectly moist and dense. The flavor is best the second day. I made a 9x13 so I cut the baking powder back to 1.5 tsp and used my own chocolate frosting recipe. I am a cake snob and prefer scratch made and it doesn't get much better than this.

If you're looking for a great cake and filling recipe and have a standard chocolate frosting you want to use this is your recipe. I thought this recipe was really great if for no other reason that I botched it a bit and it still got rave reviews. I accidentally put in 1 cup butter instead of the advised 3/4 cup. It was very dense but for it being a peanut butter cake I don't think that's a total failure. If I make this again I would probably not add the extra 1/4 cup butter but it certainly wasn't dry like the other reviews have warned. Also I really loved the filling! My only complaint is that I wasn't so much a fan of the frosting part as the filling. The peanut butter filling is SO EASY and really fancies up the cake. I felt the frosting left a little bit to be desired. Mine came out not too chocolaty. I was afraid it wouldn't be strong enough to couple well with the all that peanut butter so be prepared with a chocolate frosting back up if you like a richer chocolate taste. However I'll use this recipe again for the cake and filling. Excellent.

My 14 year old son was craving a PB cake and found this recipe. It was his first ever attempt at baking. Excellent cake recipe just right on the PB flavor. He baked a sheet cake using the cake mix and frosted it with Fudge Frosting (by Martha). Delicious!

I liked the filling but the didn't have the best results with the cake. I've made it twice it may be me but it turned out dry both times and I didn't care for the flavor nor did my husband and chocolate & peanut butter fanatic. I used a homemade chocolate glaze hoping it would help with the dryness but no luck. I won't be making it again.

I have to admit that I only tried the peanut butter center/filling part of this recipe. I am results.....fantastic! I loved it. I tried this on an "experiment" cake. Let me just say the lady that I gave this to said that the cake was GONE by the next morning. Five stars all the way for just the filling! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great cake recipe for any peanut butter lovers. Between the peanut butter in the cake itself and also in the filling is was loaded with flavor. That combined with the chocolate frosting was very good.

Pure heaven cannot explain the joy it brought to our tastebuds. Makes your home smell like peanut butter cookies. Try caramel topping instead of fudge. Endless combinations. Delish!!! Highly recommend it.

Delicious cake & filling. My cake came out a bit dry but I may have beaten it too long. I poured a chocolate ganache over the top & down the sides. One word....YUM!

Very good cake overall I agree the cake itself was better in the second day and should be made ahead of time. My one and only complaint was the chocolate frosting- in the future I would use a different recipe for the outer frosting.
