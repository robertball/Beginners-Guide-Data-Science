Well, I took a chance on this unrated rice recipe and am glad I did!  I had some leftover brown rice to use, but no wild rice.  I had to use regular brown raisins, and had no mint, but this is still scrumptious!  I used the marsala wine, and a bit of sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Good way to use up leftover rice, and I will make this again!

I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was fantastic! Full of citrus flavor for sure, I think next time I'll cut back on the orange zest... but the mint and orange and marsala blended to become a tasty dish that I was proud to serve. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for a fruity pilaf recipe so thought I'd give it a try. Clearly I have reading issues because I didn't notice this is served at room temp. I used craisins, soaked in boiling water to plump, instead of raisins and halved the olive oil. It's good even without the mint but will add next time. Thanks!

Very good. I save 5 stars for extraordinary, and while this is excellent, it doesn't quite make extraordinary. I will for sure make this again.

Excellent!  Easy!  Directions are spot on.  There is some plan ahead time needed for this dish because the flavors really do have to sit for a time in order to blend.  Right after completing the recipe I tasted the dish and thought, "meh".  Served 3 hours later with dinner and it was, "wow"!  One small change - I left out some of the olive oil to cut back on fat and calories.  I drizzled over the top and mixed in - probably 1/8 to 1/4 cup.  Everything else was followed to the letter.  Great, healthy alternative to potato or macaroni salads in the summer time.

Made this recipe as a side for a citrusy fish dish. Overall, it’s very good, but as a side, I felt it was very wet and heavy - even though I cut the oil and orange juice in half. My daughter and I decided to sauté the finished dish to cook off the extra liquid, and it was quite the improvement of flavor and texture! Also withheld the pecans due to a nut allergy.

This dish is amazing!  It's attractive, tasty, and can be made several hours ahead of serving time. I had to drain the excess water off the wild rice and I added just a tiny bit less oil than called for. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.
