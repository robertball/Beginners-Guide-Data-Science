I consider my oven to be a "hot oven."  That is why I am so surprised that I baked this recipe for an hour and 20 minutes, and it still didn't set up.  I would have burned the top if I had cooked it more.  I did not drain the 2 cans of regular corn before adding them.  Should I have done that?  Help!!

I have not had Corn Pudding this good since childhood.  My children and grandchildren loved it, even the ones that are not fond of corn.  I am taking this dish to a company pot luck this week.

Unlike another review, I did drain the corn well, but I still couldn't get the pudding to set in the alotted time. It had way too much liquid b/w the cream corn, the half/half, the milk, etc...I had to turn the hot dish over the sink, and literally let it run. Then put back in the oven another 30 minutes. Better, but not perfect. 

Despite the runny trouble, I served to my family and they all liked the flavor (I did sub Splenda for sugar for my diabetic mom).

The best was the leftovers. Once it was cold for 24hrs and had time to really stiffen up, I thought it was much more delicious!

I cut this recipe in half and baked it in a large casseroll and it turned out delicious. I added a bit more sugar to it, because i have a sweet tooth.

My boyfriend had some corn pudding out in Lancaster, PA and has been bugging me ever since to make it.  Decided to make it for his Italian family and him as a side dish for Christmas Dinner.  Unless they were just being nice, they loved it! This recipe is a definate keeper! Just remember to DRAIN the whole corn before you mix it!  YUMMY!

I found this to be too bland, and with a poor texture.

STOP NOW! Do NOT use this recipie for your corn pudding.  Drain all you want, it will not set and have an awful uncooked consistency. If you insist on trying this recipie, keep your receipts to remember how much money you wasted on ingredients.
