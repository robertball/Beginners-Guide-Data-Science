This was a decent recipe with some potential. I made a couple of changes. I sauteed the onion for 5 minutes, then added the garlic and sauteed for a minute or two before adding the chicken.  I also added a jalapena pepper (finely diced) with the pasta sauce, etc. Rice did come out a bit too watery, next time I may cut down to 3 cups and see if that helps.

My family enjoyed this rice. It was simple and made a nice side dish. It makes a ton though so you could make it as an entree with or with out some meat added. Just don't cook it too long! I did not use cilantro because I don't care for it.
