This tuned out really good. Add some herbs and you have a 5 star.

Great flavor & easy to prepare, wasn't salty but I would add more garlic & some habanero for a kick.
You should be sure to have freezer bags as they are best for storing the chops in Brine.

Didn't have 6 hours to marinate so marinated only 2.5. It still came out delicious!
