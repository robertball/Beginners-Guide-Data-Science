Made this for Thanksgiving...it was a huge hit!! Sweet but not too sweet. Kind of tasted like creme brulee with pears. LOVED it. 

I used red pears and sliced them.

Excellent and so easy to make. Absolutely delicious. I added a bit more nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe. Yum!

This is GREAT!!!!  It was wonderful and I even forgot to put the butter in! (left it in the microwave...)  I cannot wait to make it with butter.  If it is wonderful without the butter, I can't imagine what it will be like when I use the butter.  This one is really a keeper!

I used 3 Bartlett pears and 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice in place of the nutmeg. I covered the top of the pie with foil as it was starting to brown, and baked it another 20 minutes until the center only wiggled very slightly. I let the pie cool overnight, and when I cut into it the next day it was pretty messy. It seems the custard was not completely set in the bottom/middle of the pie, and ran out over the rest. Let me tell you, nothing is more disappointing then having a beautiful pie that you can't serve to anyone. If I make this again, I am going to add at least one more egg to help it hold together. It had a slight floury taste to it-I kind of felt like I was eating raw batter. Maybe I need to extend the cooking time even more... I'll keep playing with it because the pear flavor was so great and I like the concept.

I got a load of japanese pears from a co-worker, so I decided to try this. I'm glad I did, my family liked it and so did I. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, or if it's supposed to get brown and a little crunchy on top? I checked it after 20 minutes and I thought it was burning so I took it out. After testing it with a knife, however, it wasn't done inside. I cooked it some more, but the top wasn't as pretty as the picture with the recipe.

This pie is delicious! I cut back on the sugar to about 2/3 C. The sweetness of the pears makes up for it. I took this pie to a dinner party and everyone loved it. There was enough custard for two pies, so I froze one. I wrapped it in foil first and then put it in a zip lock bag. A couple months later, it was just as delicious. Enjoy!!

I would rate this a 5, but changed it so I can't.  My changes were I used Splenda in place of the sugar because my hubby is diabetic.  I also sprinkled the top with chopped pecans.  This pie is really good.  I had no problems at all with it and will make again.

This was amazing! Guests (one a chef) said it was the best pie they had had in a long time.  They were surprised that pears could taste so good in a pie.  Def would make again- a must try!

Loved this pie!  I was looking for a way to use up some pears & this is a great way to do it. Followed the recipe as stated except I didn't have heavy duty foil, just used regular & it turned out fine.

I tried this 2 times before I reviewed.  The first one I followed exactly and the pears never did get soft, in fact, they got even more tough and hard.  Threw that one away.  Told my husband I'm going to try it with granny smith apples.  Well, I did and I cooked that sucker for about 1 1/2 hours and the apples still weren't done and the custard never set, just juice in the middle.  Not sure but it just didn't turn out for me.  Sorry.

This pie was delicious! I always make a recipe "as is" before modifying anything. I have to say that it was a success! My only warning is to make sure you cover the edges properly because it will leak and make a small mess at the bottom of your stove. Other than that, no issues! Thank you for sharing!

1st the foil stuck to the pie shell so when we removed it to put in the pears, the pie shell fell apart.  2. After adding the pears, we poured on the custard stuff, only to find the pie shell didn't have enough room, with half of the liquid spilling all over the counter, and onto the floor.  Maybe using a deep dish pie shell would help.  3.  We haven't even baked it yet and created a huge mess.

Absolutely loved this pie!  I had an abundance of pears from my trees this year and searched for something to make.  So glad I happened upon this recipe! Everyone in the family thought it was unique and delicious.
