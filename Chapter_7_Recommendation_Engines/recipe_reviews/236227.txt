This was the time I've used parsnip.  I like them a lot - made the recipe almost, I used heavy cream instead of creme fraiche.  Really good and nice new side choice for us.  I will make this again.

This was actually my favorite dish on Thanksgiving, surprisingly! The sauce was delicious, and though the parsnips didn't necessarily add any substantial flavor, their texture was nice. Would definitely make this again.

Loved it! This is not your typical Gratin. The flavors from the thyme and creme fraiche really  came through for me and you won't even know the parsnips are there. Chef John is right about the parmesan. Pony up for the authentic stuff, you'll definitely taste the difference.

Found pre-made creme fraiche at Safeway so didn't bother making homemade.  Everything made exactly as directed.  First time using a mandolin slicer so of course took a piece off my finger.  Duh!  Tasted awesome. The potatoes tasted awesome, not my finger!

Only issue I had is that it took longer to cook than what is included in recipe. The potatoes were done in an hour but there was still a lot of juice in the casserole dish. So nuked it for 10 minutes and that seemed to solve the problem.  Will make this again for sure.

I cooked this for over an hour and still the potatoes where hard. The sauce was super watery, that may be my fault as I did not dry off the mandolin sliced potatoes and parsnips as they came out of the cold water. My crockery was deep, not wide and shallow like the photo, that may have contributed to my fail. I did not use a lid while cooking, maybe that would have helped. Sadly, it is bagged and trashed. I blame me.

Varied a bit due to what had on hand and it was delicious, even reheated two days later. I used Sartori Belavitano cheese (balsamic flavor), grated fine. Instead of creme  fraiche I used evaporated milk and no chicken brothe

Try this recipe..you won't be sorry!  I like my veggies, but hubby is a meat and potato man.  I discovered parsnips several years ago and really like them, but not many recipes for them out there.  This was a great side for pork chops!  Loved the touch of cayenne pepper.

I cannot wait to make this dish again.  It was perfect as a side compliment to our main dish.  I did saute the aromatics before adding them, and I did add a touch more thyme than stated. 
Great dish for those leftover parsnips.
