I love broccolini if prepared correctly and these are nice directions.  I took one more step and transferred the broccolini to an ice bath after the first two minutes of cooking to stop the cooking process.   This kept it a beautiful, vibrant green.

when in a pinch I always use S&P Garlic with EVOO but the addition of lemon juice made it pop and I was serving it with panfried Talipia. many new cooks go right for the most ratings so lets show them simple can rate high as well.

I love the simplicity of the recipe! Plus, doing a ice cold bath after cooking it really helps big time! Serving it with roasted garlic alongside it adds more taste. Thank you for sharing! ??

I was searching for a quick and simple recipe to pair with my weeknight meal of cod fish, veggies and rice and this did the trick. Taste was ok and texture was one-dimensional.

Simple and easy with a lot of flavor. I, of course, added far more garlic and I liked that. I wonder too if it would be good to cut the broccolini once it was blanched.

I used it for broccoli. Leaves it with a firmer texture than steaming. I will use this recipe again.

Made this to go along with dinner. The taste was great and the man loved it! I did add the hot pepper flakes, but the flower tops seemed to melt away. He liked it because he likes the bulk of the stalk...I missed the top. But I'll cook it less the next time and see if we both can be thrilled!

Great recipe.  They now have, or I just discovered, broccolini prewashed and ready to microwave in fresh produce department.  So I sauteed  my garlic and then nuked the broccolini as directed and added it to the garlic and oil

I’m a big fan of broccolini and this is my first time making it at home. Great easy/fast recipe! I paired it with a sweet & spicy mahi mahi. Great match! Will definitely be making this again.

I saw another highly-rated recipe online that also called for lemon zest, so I added that. I trimmed about half an inch off the bottoms of the stalks. After blanching, I did an ice bath (well, really cold water) to stop the cooking process. Half a bunch was plenty just for me. I let it cook for about 3 min; it was still a little crisp, but much better than being soggy. Easy, healthy and delicious! Thanks!

DELICIOUS. "What is this delightful vegetable?" is what one of our dinner guests asked of this broccolini. Stovetop cooking allows it to stay nice and crisp. The lemon is a magnificent flavor enhancer. And it's so simple that after one or two times you won't even need to consult the recipe anymore. (In other words, I've made this many times!)
