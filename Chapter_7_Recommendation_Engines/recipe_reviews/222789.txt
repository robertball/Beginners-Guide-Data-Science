This recipe is easy and delicious! In the future, however, I would make only half of the amaretto glaze. It made way more then I needed and I ended up wasting half of it.

I made the brownies cake and cut the powered sugar in half. I also refrigerated the brownies before adding the chocolate drizzle to prevent it from melting the topping.

Well first off my came out more cake like than brownie.But it's my fault because I only had one cup of chocolate syrup not one and a half as the recipe calls for.Still very good sort of like a German chocolate cake.I also made extra icing because it didn't look like an to cover 9-13 cake.Chocolate drizzle was clumping maybe because I melted in microwave.But still tasted good drizzled on cake.Will try again with full amount of syrup.
