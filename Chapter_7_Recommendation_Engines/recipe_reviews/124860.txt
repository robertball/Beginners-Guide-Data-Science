I've made these a few times now. I've messed around with all crumbs on bottom, using milk chocolate chips, using more butter...basically trying some of the most popular suggestions. Our favorite? AS WRITTEN!  also: SOMETHING I JUST DISCOVERED: I made these last weekend for a family gathering. I used pre-crushed graham crackers I bought from the store. BIG MISTAKE! I saw where a lot of reviewers were having problems with dryness/not-sweet-enough-ness. Every time I make these with graham crackers I crush myself and use the amount of butter and sugar called for, they are SUPERB. But this time the crust did not hold together and it was not sweet enough. Down right "yucky" compared to the normal turn out. I learned my lesson! No more pre-crushed graham crackers for me.

Big Hit at my son's school party. Several parents asked me for the recipe.  I put all of the graham cracker mixture on the bottom of the pan, and just topped it with the marshmallows and chocolate chips.  I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  I cooled them in the fridge, and then cut them into perfect squares!  Excellent treat and so easy.

These bars were such a hit at work, I didn't get a chance to try one. Several people asked me for the recipe. So quick and easy too. I doubled the graham/sugar/butter mixture per others' posts. I also made my own crumbs so I could have some bigger pieces of graham cracker. Yum!

this is the first time ever i didn't take the time to read many reviews b-4 making a recipe thinking to myself how could anyone screw something so easy up.... i did by not reading ur gr8 reviews first as u all suggested u need at least 1/2 cup butter more to make a well formed crust. next time i will add the extra butter but as far as leaving all the crust on the bottom i will not! i like the extra crust on the top! it really makes the bars like a s'more and breaks up the incredible sweetness! these were amazing and all my employees loved them and all wanted the recipe!! definately one of those recipes u can play with using different chips and different marshmallows like white chips and strawberry marshmallows ect. only ur imagination can limit the possibilities!! a keeper!!!

Delicious and really easy. I also crushed up graham crackers in order to add some texture. To have enough crackers I crushed 4 packs (about 1.3 boxes worth). I increased the margarine slightly to 7/8 cup at the other reviewer's suggestion and it worked great.

I used semi-sweet mini chips and they seemed fill in the little gaps between marshmallows really well. I took them to a 'campfire' themed potluck at work and I proceeded to get email requests for the recipe for 3 days afterward. Yum!

I love this recipe... but I like it better with more of a crunch to it (which is why this is only getting 4 stars).  I recommend layering graham crackers on the bottom of the pan in squares, then top with the chocolate and marshmallows.  I broke up some additional graham crackers so they were chunkier to sprinkle on the top to add more crunch.  These little changes perfected the recipe for me to make it 5 stars.  Yum!

I, too, put all of the graham cracker mixture on the bottom, but did have to add a little more melted butter to make it hold together better.  Then I just loaded all the marshmallows and chocolate chips on top that I could.  They were delicious and disappeared fast.

I put the original amount of graham cracker mixture on the bottom, and then made another cup and a half to put on the top.  Needed about 5 more minutes in the oven to melt the chips and mallows properly.  Refrigerated overnight and cut them into bite size bars this morning.  Yummy!!  Definitely took care of my s'mores craving.

These are so easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I do reccommend cooling them in the refrigerator to make them easier to cut into bars.

These were very good.  the only issue I had with this recipe is that I had to double the grahm cracker mix in order to get enough to cover the entire bottom and top.

I made these using 9 oz. chocolate chips--plenty--and 1/2 chocolate graham crackers & 1/2 honey graham crackers.  Definitely not enough crumb for the size pan.  I chilled the bars after cooking & cooling.  The first ones were delicious but leftovers (kept in the fridge) were chewy and soft-gummy.  Won't make again.

These were perfect!  I made them just as written and I wouldn't suggest changing a thing.  In fact, I think they may be better than the real thing!

I thought these were great. I followed the recipe exactly and they were awesome. My dad suggested maybe adding some coconut to the mix one time to make it even more delicious, although that would take away from it being a true s'more bar ;)

These are so fast, easy and yummy!!!  This is a perfect go-to recipe when you need something sweet but don't have a lot of time.  I have made this twice now, and the only changes I made were to use about another half cup of graham cracker crumbs, put 2/3 of the crumb mixture on the bottom and sprinkle 1/3 on the top, and I used a mixture of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips.  Everyone really likes this, and they are rich enough that a little goes a long way.  The first time I made them, they cut into bars fairly well.  For some reason, last night, they were softer and needed to be eaten with a spoon. Either way was fine by us!  Thanks for the recipe--this would be perfect to take to a barbeque or picnic.

I love this! This is a good way to get the taste of smores when you don't have a fire to roast your marshmallows. Next week I'm going to quadruple the recipe and take them to a tailgate party!

I make mine a little different but i use the ingredients. I line a baking sheet with foil and use whole graham crackers and just lay the crackers on the sheet side by side 8 fit perfectly. Then in a pan melt the butter and brown sugar and pour it over the crackers then bake 5 minutes remove from oven and immediatly sprinkle with marshmallows and broken chocolate bar then bake for another 2-3 minutes. It is wonderful.

These are great. I like s,mores but can only eat 1 when camping because I think they're too rich and I was kind of afraid this might be the same but I dont think they're rich at all. My daughter loves them too, I will be making these again.

I love s'mores, and was somewhat but not completely satisfied with this bar.  I used an 8x8 pan, line with aluminum foil and lightly greased to help with the sticking and removal.  It was so much easier to just lift and cut.  I also only used a stick of butter (1/2c).  I would cut the amount of sugar in the crust in half if you aren't much of a sweet tooth.  I only had one bag of chips, which is only 2 cups, so I just made do.  It was more than plenty.  This was my layering system: 3/4 of graham cracker mix, all but a handful of chocolate chips, as many marshmallows that would form a single layer in the pan, sprinkled with left over chips, then pressed the rest of the graham cracker crumbs on top.  The marshmallows started browning after 10 min, I cooked for 11.  Put in the freezer/fridge to help cool and harden.  I was afraid of not cooking the crust first, and I would def cook it first next time, before adding the chips and marshmallows.  Then put it back in to melt the chips and marshmallows.  It wasn't very crunchy, more soggy, on the bottom.  I tried these hot and cold, and actually preferred cold smores for once in my life. UPDATE: I just made these with 1/8 c sugar in the crust and they were excellent.  Sweet enough, but not killer sweet.  I also prebaked my crust, and it didn't make that much of a difference in texture, so I will skip that next time.  I only used 1/2 c butter the first time i made these, and the crust was much better.

These are SO easy to make, and are a huge hit.  They can be rich, but are tasty.  I normally do Hershey bars instead of chocolate chips but both work.

Super fast and easy and taste great! Next time I will either use a smaller pan (9x9) or make more of the crumb mixture. Mine turned out very thin and hard to keep together when cutting. Everyone really enjoyed them so I will try again with a couple of small adjustments. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good, except that the crumbs on top made it seem a little dry, especially on the second day.

My picture is not a good one compared to others. An ooey, gooey mess, but we liked them. I only had big marshmallows, so I cut them into 4. Used dark choco chips. Good, but my crust was thin and really fell apart.

This was awesome. I was only able to take a small bite...it smelled wonderful. I did double the recipe and possibly cooked it longer, but my kids loved it being all gooey and sticky. They were totally fasinated with the stretching ability the marshmellow has. They all ate 2 potions and said it was off the hook.....They are very rich and were soo easy to make. I did make my own graham cracker crumbs instead of using the store bought ones. This recipe is a total keeper. I had never thought about this until I saw a photo from some one else, and I always keep these ingredients on hand....what an awesome pantry throw together in a fix especially when you want something chocolatey....these are a hit with my kids......I can't see how you can go wrong really.

I made these to bring to a week long camp for high schoolers to sell at the snack bar.  They were a HUGE hit.  They were gone by the third day, and as they were buying snacks and drinks for the ride home, people were asking if there were any left.    These were super easy, I will DEFINITELY make them again!    **I've made them several times since the original review, and have tweaked it to make them work better.  1) I add about 1/4 cup corn syrup (sweetened condensed milk would probably work, as well) to the crumb mixture-it helps them stick together MUCH better when cutting.  2) I used all of the crumb mixture on the bottom, topped with a single layer of marshmallows, and then sprinkled mini chocolate chips generously over the top.  These changes really made the recipe work for traveling-I would highly recommend trying it this way if you're bringing them to work, a potluck, etc.

Easy, fast and delicious!  I made them exactly as directed, and they were very tasty.  The crust had a great butter flavor and held together.  I used 2/3 of the graham cracker mix on the bottom and sprinkled the remaining 1/3rd on top.  We had about 10 people over for a BBQ and the entire 9x13" tray was devoured by the time everyone left (and this was not the only dessert we served).

I made a half recipe and baked it in a 8 by 8 inch pan. I used vegan marshmallows since i'm a vegetarian. Me and my husband couldn't wait for them to cool so we ate some of them right after they came out of the oven and they were really ooey and gooey. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

Easy to make and wicked good! They are very sweet, but that's kind of the point isn't it? I used a little more butter and milk chocolate chips. I think I used more marshmallows than called for because I had some of those really giant marshmallows to use up which I cut into pieces. But... loved them and will make them again. Thanks for sharing.

I give these bars only 3 stars because of the crust. I added a little more butter as some suggested and still cant get them to cut and keep shape. The taste, however, is great! So, if you can get the crust to harden a little more than you will love this recipe!

I was disappointed with these.  The crumb topping and crust completely falls apart so you need to eat them with a plate rather than hold in your hand like a cookie.  My kids liked them but my husband and I weren't crazy about them.

These were wonderful! My only wish is that I could have gotten the marshmellows to have that burnt, right-off-the-fire taste, but that is just because I like my marshmellows like that with smores. This was easy to make and popular among my family! I did add some extra crumb mixture to the top to make it less likely to fall apart.

I made these for a coworker's Birthday and everyone loved them.  I used 3 cups of graham crumbs, 2 sticks of butter, 2 cups of marshmallows and 1 10 oz. bag of Ghirardelli Milk Choc Chips. I reserved 1 cup of the crumbs for the top and put the rest on the bottom as I do with all bars I make and baked at the exact time recipe said and they came out perfect and everyone at worked loved them.....some ate them just they way they were while others put their pieces in the microwave for a few secs to warm up again. :-)

I loved the idea of this, but not the outcome!  I made half the recipe in a little square pan that I had lined with non-stick foil with enough extending that I could lift the bars right out, hoping to get nice clean cuts.  After baking I sprayed a spatula with non-stick cooking spray and pressed the bars down firmly.  I didn't have any mess as suggested by another reviewer, but that may have been because my crumb topping completely covered the top.  I cooled the bars completely and then refrigerated.  When they were thoroughly chilled, I lifted them from the pan and used a very sharp chef's knife to cut straight down through.  Well, I didn't get the nice clean cuts I was hoping for.  These are very crumbly.  As for the taste, they are ok, not as good as I'd hoped and too rich for me.

I made the recipe as written and it didn't work for me. There's not enough of the graham cracker crumb to cover the bottom of the dish. Plus the recipe says "Remove from the oven and immediately press top firmly with spatula." That was a huge mistake. Everything stuck to the spatula and the chocolate and marshmallow turned into a big mess. I took them to a friend's house. Everyone tried them, but no one said they were good. I'll stick to making my indoor smores under the broiler.

This is so yummy everytime. We only use half the grams for the crust, then just mix the marshmallow, choco chips, and grams in a bowl and press into the pan.  We also turn the broiler on 2-3 minutes to toast the marshmallows on top!  YUM!!

Very good and easy.  The kids loved them.  I put them in the fridge to harden them up and they cut great that way.  I will be making these alot this summer.  My daughter already requested them for a sleepover this weekend.  These would be great for camping (less messy) if you have young kids too.

I made these bars last night after reading a few reviews. I placed a piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan to make them easier to remove from the pan. I did use precrushed graham crackers because I had some I wanted to use up and the only real graham crackers I had were cinnamon flavored (didn't reallly want to use those for this recipe and wasn't sure if I would get three cups out of what I had left in the box). I did double the crust recipe as per some reviewers suggestions and I love crust, totally not necessary as it was too much overpowering the flavor of anything else. Next time I will use real graham crackers and crush them myself as the precrushed does make the bars seem dry (even though I added a little bit more butter and slightly more sugar). I pressed the crust down on the bottom layer firmly and it stayed intact for me.  I also placed some of the graham cracker mix on top, next time I won't as I would like to have all the marshmallows exposed to brown them a little more. I used milk chocolate chips as I only have ghiradelli chips in the house right now (both semi-sweet and milk chocolate) and the semi-sweet ghiradelli can be a bit strong. The milk chocolate chips were just fine and not too sweet for us perhaps because I may not have had quite 3 cups of marshmallows (I had an open bag that was a little more than half gone that I used up for this recipe). Overall a great recipe and I think I will just make as directed next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, using freshly crumbled graham crackers etc., and did get a crumbly crust. Not so bad as to strike these from my dessert list, but I'd make them for family or other people I could make sure would shove a plate under themselves at all times. That said, these are a unique, simple and well-received snack and I'll make again for ourselves or an outdoor event. Be careful when the directions say to press firmly after baking: the soft not-yet-set filling smooshes everywhere and might ruin your presentation, next time I'll just do it before the baking.

Tasty - no doubt!  I try not to read others reviews before I try it myself, but wish I had on this one.  It definitely needs the crust combo doubled!

i followed someone's suggestion to double graham crackers, sugar, and butter.  i tried to cut a piece after it cooled down, it was just way to crumbly and the bottom fell apart.  the graham cracker part will be crumbly either way, but placing it in the fridge before cutting definitely helped.  i kept mine in the fridge, but would heat up a slice for about 10-15 sec in the microwave---just enough to warm up the marshmallows on top before eating :)

These are insanely good! Gooey and yummy are the two words my boys used to describe them. I followed the recipe to a "T" and had no problems whatsoever with the crust staying together. I used my food processor to make my graham cracker crumbs and it worked great. I used slightly more than half the crumbs on the bottom and sprinkled the rest on the top. Will absolutely make again!

I love S'mores, but I can usually only eat two bites and I'm done, because they are so sweet.  I like these bars because they use semi-sweet chocolate, which cuts down the sweetness a lot.  I made 1/2 batch and baked it in a 8" round cake pan.  They turned out great - the marshmallows were even toasted a little!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems with the crumb mixture, it stuck together fine.

used this at a bake sale last night and then re-served in the dorm.  "This is the best thing I've ever had in my life," said one high school kid.  SUPER EASY, QUICK RECIPE when you are in a rush.  and when everyone else is serving chocolate chip cookies, your s'mores bars are the thing people go to because it's so different.  beware, though - super gooey and rich.  should serve with milk!  btw, i just dumped a box of teddy grahams into a bowl (i was in a hurry!) and did the recipe.  i think i added another 1/4 cup of butter, too, since i read somewhere that it needed some more butter...seems to have worked!  i'd probably buy some more graham crackers to sprinkle on top for the full effect in the future! :)

These are DELICIOUS!  I made them exactly as written (and made sure to crush my own graham cracker crumbs), took it to a tailgate, and got raves from both kids and adults.

These are so good! I put to much butter in my crust so it did not crisp up on the bottom but I did like some other suggested and used the 3cups on the bottom and made an additional cup for the top! These are addicting so watch out!

These were just ok and were too soft by the next day. I love the concept though so I'll keep looking for a recipe with a different crust.

These were very yummy.  I increased the crumb mixture by 1 1/2 times based on reviews I was reading.  This made way too much of the crumb mixture so next time I would follow the recipe as written.

These were delicious. I didn't have graham crackers (they don't sell them here in Sweden) but I used Digestive crackers/cookies as a substitute and it turned out really good.

I brought these to a 4th of July party and they were gone within an hour!  EVERYONE loved them!  I did have to increase the graham cracker/butter mixture so I would have more "crust" but left everything else the same.  YUMMY!

I couldn't help it... when they were fresh out of the oven, I spooned some into a bowl and ate it while it was still warm and gooey. Delicious! They're still good now that they've cooled, but I think I prefer them warm ;D I put them in an 8x8 pan cause I wanted a thicker bar, and used milk chocolate chips instead of the semisweet. If I make that substitution again I plan on either reducing the amount of sugar or eliminating it because they're VERY sweet with milk chocolate chips. Fabulous recipe, Darlene! Thanks!

simple, easy, delicious. I find it easier to just throw graham crackers in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush the crackers finely. I crushed honey flavored graham crackers. I melted the butter and mixed with graham crackers and sugar. pressed it down firmly in a glass baking pan and then sprinkled the marshmallows and choc. chips on top. The baking time is appoximate, 10 mins., which was great. As soon as i took it out I noticed a nice TOASTY golden brown color evenly on top of the marshmallows. I took a spatula and pressed the topping down firmly. I let the bars cool completely before cutting into bars. :)~

Another 10 stars.....everyone raved over these simple yet delicious bars. Yes, a little messy.....but so worth it. I made these the day before my party and left them out at room temp covered with plastic wrap. I thought that refrigerating them would really harden the marshmallow...so glad I followed my instinct. Did not change a thing, I think the key it to really press down on the cooked bars when they come out of the oven to get them to stick together. These cut nicely the next day and were amazingly good. Will make again and kids and adults loved them. Thanks!

I made this last night and they were super easy. I cut the recipe to make 12 servings instead of 36 since it's just myself and my boyfriend in the house. I did what others did and used whole graham crackers and beat them with a rolling pin to make largish crumbs. The only thing I noticed was that I didn't have enough to make thicker bars, they were more like a bark. So next time I will use more graham crackers and more butter and I'm sure they'll be perfect. Otherwise, as is, they are great and my boyfriend scarfed down 3 bars just in the first few minutes of taking them out of the fridge. For a quick sweet tooth satisfier, these are awesome.

I made this for company and it got all eaten up!  I put about 2/3 of the crumb crust on bottom and the other third on top.  I agree with other reviewers who suggested adding more butter to the crust.  It was a little too crumbly for me.  However, they still tasted very good!

these are super yummy but you definitely need to double the crust recipe!  there is no way you're going to cover the bottom of a 9x13 and then have enough to make a top crust too.  and the crust is good enough that you definitely want to have it on the top and bottom :)  otherwise very simple and delicious.  kids enjoyed helping me make this today!

4 stars for taste, but only 3 for presentation.  The bars were a crumbly mess, but were yummy and appealed to the kids. I should have taken others advise at doubled the crumb mixture.

These taste how you would expect them to taste... like a s'more, so if you like s'mores, you'd probably like these.  I liked them.  And they were easy.

So easy to put together and my kids loved them.  I used red and green holiday marshmallows and they were very festive.  Keep in mind, these are messy (just like s'mores), and I have graham crumbs everywhere when my kids eat these.

Yummy. I made it with all the ingredients, had to change them around. I used huge marshmellows, and cut them up then sprinkled them over in the pan. And for the chocolate I did not have chocolate chips, but I had chocolate bars and just broke them up over it. It was just great and was requested again before the night was over. Thank you for the great recipe :)

These were so so yummy and even easier to make.  I made extra graham crakcer crumb mixture the second time I made them.  Also, after they are cooled and cut, warming up in microwave on low for a short amount of time, melts the chocolate and marshamllows just enough!!

These are excellent!  I  made them when there were too many mosquitos to go out and roast marshmallows, so these were a perfect replacement. I don't think the crust needs 3/4 cups of butter though.  The crumbs were practically wet with butter.  Next time I'll cut it back to 1/2 cup. This is a very easy and quick recipe to make!

Made these for the 4th of July - Big hit.  I made more crust as others have suggested, and next time I will also add more marshmallows.  I had a hard time measuring them and I think I missed the mark a little.  Highly recommend

Yummy. S'mores is one of my favorite things in the world. I would concur with some of the other reviews that the bottom layer is very thin- I might try adding another cup or so of crumbs next time to make it thicker. I think having enough to sprinkle some over the top is important. I will definitely be making this again - perhaps with milk or dark chocolate. I'm taking these camping this weekend and looking forward to enjoying them in the beautiful Colorado mountains!

YUM!!!!  So easy and so good!  Made it with semi-sweet chocolate, but next time I will use milk to get that more authentic s'mores taste.  I wasn't sure that 10 min was enough baking time, but it was perfect.  Also put a few broken crushed up pieces of graham cracker (without the butter/sugar) on top for texture and it was a great addition.  The marshmallows held them in place perfectly.  Will definitely make these again!

I made these for a party and they were so good and easy to make that I made another batch for a tailgating event the next day!  Great recipe if you want to throw something together quickly that everyone will like.  The only thing that takes time is waiting for them to cool, but you could speed up the process by putting them in the refrigerator or freezer.

Only did the 3 layers: graham crackers, then chips then marshmallows. I used parchment paper, but also sprayed it (omit that because it became too greasy). I can't imagine doing two layers of graham crackers because the layer on the bottom is already thin. I tried half of semi sweet and half butterscotch chips but I would omit b chips because then it was TOO sweet. Watch the timing! 9 minutes was a titch too long to toast the marshmallows.

These bars are awesome! I did make a couple of changes so that the eye appeal of these bars would be better. First of all, I used only 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup, and the sugar to 1/4 cup. I pressed all but about 1/2 cup of the crumbs onto the bottom of my foil lined pan (I used the foil to make "handles" that make it easy to take the bars out of the pan, which allows cleaner, more even cutting) then sprinkled with the chocolate chips ( a combination of milk and semisweet) and put the marshmallows on top of that. I sprinkled the remaining 1/2 cup of crumbs on top. I baked these about 5 minutes longer than stated, because I wanted the marshmallows to get a bit browned and crispy. I'm glad I did, because it made cutting them a lot easier. I didn't press the bars down upon removing from the oven because I didn't have that big crumb layer on top. The finished bars were a big hit...they were super yummy and everyone liked them! They are a bit messy, but who cares? Thanks for sharing the recipe...it is super simple and fun! I'll be making these again!!!

Easy, easy, easy!  Everyone really loved these.  I'm not a s'mores fan personally so I won't judge for myself.  Think next time will add some peanuts to get the sweet/salty thing going.

This was just okay for me. I am not sure why I didn't like these as much as I thought I would. I may try putting it in the fridge to see if they would be better like that instead of eating them at room temperature. Thanks for sharing.

A big hit at my son's end-of-the-season party.  Followed directions, and placed pan in the refrigerator for an hour to make cutting easier as others suggested.

This came out yummy but I found the remaining crumbs that I sprinkled on top just fell off, and when I cut into it became a mess and did not stay together like I was hoping it would.  The kids ate it with a fork cause there was no way to pick it up and eat it with just their hands but they loved it nontheless.

This was a great alternative to the traditional S'more roasted over an open fire.  I used the ghrahm cracker crust suggested by another reviewer and broiled the top for 3 minutes to make the marshmallows brown before serving.  We had it for father's day and was  enjoyed by both young and old.  Great desert to serve following a standard picnic type meal!

My boys have been begging me to make these for a couple of days.  I am giving this 4 stars only because there is not enough butter to bind the grahams together.  When cut into bars, they mostly fell apart.  I followed the recipe exactly and let them cool completely.  We could not eat them as bars but rather in bowl with a spoon.  I thought the crumbs were plenty to put on the top and the bottom.  I used a little more than half on the bottom and put the rest on the top.  The flavor, however, gets 5 stars.  My boys and hubby kept coming back for more.  None of us thought they were too sweet.  Using semisweet chocolate chips cuts down on the sweetness.  I will make these again, playing around with the crust.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great concept. However, it definitely lacks butter to bind the crushed grahams. Will add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup butter the next time I make this. I chilled the bars overnight so i can cut it without making a mess and wasting all the crumb mixture. I will also try other reviewers' suggestion and try putting all the crumbs at the bottom next time. Otherwise, its a good tasting recipe, not too sweet and not too bland, just crumbly.

These are the best!  So easy and delicious.  Everyone who tries them loves them.  I put all of the crumb mixture in the bottom, then top with the chocolate chips and marshmallows.  I store these in the fridge, we prefer them cold.  Try one with a glass of milk, you'll love them too!

Big hit with our family!  We made it exactly as it says the first time.  The next time we made it easier on ourselves and just put all the graham cracker crumbs on the bottom.  Either way tastes wonderful (and is messy!).  One way is just easier to do.  Will be making this recipe many more times!

This was good, but not as good as I expected.  I doubled the graham cracker mixture after reading the reviews.  It seemed like too much.  I will try again, but I will not double the graham cracker mixture.

I've been on a baking marathon all night for a bake sale today! Made these about 2 am...following recipe exactly as submitted. There was not enough graham crumbs left to cover the top completely, so the marshmallow and chocolate bubbled up to the top. Not really a big deal, but it made it difficult to press the top down firmly when removed from the oven, because it was so sticky. I lined my pan with parchment paper, so that I could just lift the paper out of the pan when cooled. Flipped it over and peeled the paper off, then cut into squares. Worked like a charm, but it did smoke a little while baking, so keep a window open..lol. We all tried a sample before packing and it wasn't a smash hit in my house. Hubby says too much chocolate compared to marshmallow, and kids say they are tooo gooey. I like them, but thought they could use a little less chocolate as well as a thicker crumb bottom. Might make again, but would definetly use more graham crumbs and a little less chocolate.

I have made this for years! Use the crackers not crumbs. I love to crush mine but still leave several big chunks. Also use real butter not margarine. That will help the crackers stay crunchy and not soggy. I like semisweet chips bc the marshmallows and crackers are sweet already so the semisweet chocolate give it a good balance!

I don't cook or bake. Pretty useless at it. I couldn't even screw these up. They were awesome! I did forget which type of chips to get when I was shopping and got Milk Chocolate.This was yummy! Made this for a pot luck and I got major compliments.

Next time I'll make these in a smaller pan, like a 9x9.  They turned out a little too thin.  Plus I don't like when I eat an entire 9x13 pan of something! Also, I'll take other's advice and use more crumbs.

Very tasty, but a little too messy for my taste. The crumbs fell all over the place when eating and they were a little difficult to cut as well, but they tasted good and didn't last long in my house.

This is a great recipe.  I am not a big cooker, but this recipe was simple to make, but tasted delicious.  We even froze the leftovers, and then heated them back up later, and they still tasted great!

I made half the recipe, but used kept the Graham crackers the same. I made them in my silicone pan, and when they came out of the oven I placed them in the fridge. They came out beautifully! What a treat! Great for a s'mores craving.

I like smores and seen this and decided to try it. Unfortunately, mine never came together like a bar. It was like buttered graham crumbs and melted chocolate. Most of the marshmallow melted too much to even be tasted just making the pile of chocolaty crumbs more sweet! I would have been better off to just make smores under the broiler like I had thought of doing. Luckily, I only did a half a recipe, but I am still not sure what to do with it now. It is too messy and overly sweet to eat as a bowl of crumbs!

These were really good but I couldn't get them to stick together to make a bar. I will have to play around with the crumb part, but we ended up just eating these right out of the pan. Mmmm.

These weren't as good as I had hoped...not b/c they didn't taste good, but they were too crumbly. It fell apart a little when cutting, then completely when I tried to pick up the cut bars. It definitely needs more butter in the crust mix (which I used all in the bottom), but I probably won't make this again.

Nice recipe; I halved it in an 8x8. The only difference between this and AllRecipe's "S'mores" is that this has 1/4 cup less butter in it. I'd go for this recipe just for the fewer calories!!

Very quick and easy recipe! It was extremely rich! After cooking I let it cool in the refrigerator to let the crust set and then I cut into bars.  It was good but not sure I would make again.

So delightful!! I didn't add the 1/3 cup sugar into the graham cracker mixture. I didn't want it to be too sweet. It smelled wonderful coming out of the oven! I attacked it as soon as it was cooled. Delicious!!

My husband LOVED this snacky dessert. He ate most of it. I made one that I donated to a church service auction, so I didn't get to taste it. I made another one that was a little smaller, so I could taste it. It is SOOOOOOOO easy.

Amazing! I stuck to the recipe except I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. The only thing I would change is I would probably make a thicker graham cracker crust as they were a little messy but oh so delicious!

Just incase you haven't read other reviews telling you to double the graham cracker, butter, sugar mixture...DOUBLE the graham cracker, butter, sugar mixture! Definitely my mistake. Don't let it be yours, because that mixture is in my opinion the best part of the bars! Also, I lowered the amount of chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups.  But overall, very good recipe! :D

These were tasty. My crumb crust was falling apart like others have mentioned. I used my own homemade marshmallows that I needed to use up. Even though they fell apart, they were still really yummy, but I think I'll probably stick to good ol' s'mores

VERY sweet and gooey!  I'd eliminate the sugar & use less chocolate chips.  Don't crush the graham crackers too fine either.  Enjoy!

I followed the other reviewers who said to double the crackers, butter and sugar.  I used crackers and crumbs because I had both on hand.  Took it to youth group and they devoured it.  The finished pan is not pretty and does not "cut" like pretty bars, but the taste is yummy!  We just put a small spatula in the pan and let the kids dish up their own servings and that worked well.  Will make this often--very quick and tasty!  Thanks!

These were okay.  I may have used too much marshmallow.  If I make these again I will try to use less.  These are very sweet and rich.

This is delicious! I put the graham crackers on both the top & bottom & it's a little messy but I like it. I've kept them in the fridge & I think they're good cold or warmed up. Very simple! Great dish for a small gathering or for kids.

these were ok. I actually liked them, it was a REALLY easy recipe, but I had alot left over and it went to waste... which is rare in my home. Not quite what we were expecting, but a close second when you have no fire available to toast the marshmallows :)

Really good. I love marshmallows so this was awesome for me. I think next time I would use 2/3 of the crust mixture on bottom and 1/3 on the top. So much of the top crust crumbled off, it seemed like a waste. So easy and fast. I refrigerated before cutting which made it very easy. Actually easier than making real s'mores!!

OMG!!! This is sooo good! Very sweet though. Only one problem...the recipe doesn't say how much of the crushed crackers to keep for the top...so i just made an additional 1 cup with sugar and butter and used that for the top. Baked an additional 5 min also. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow are these good! The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five was because the crumb mix didn't hold together very well- I think it needs more butter. It was still delicious- just messy. The worst part was waiting for them to cool enough to cut into them. Great recipe- will tweak and make again. Thanks so much!

Not a bad recipe, it satisfied the craving for a smore! However, I felt the crust didn't hold together well, and overall didn't turn out quite as I had hoped. There's a few other recipes I'll try from this site, don't think this is a keeper for me, but good luck!

This was delicious but a little messy.  I didn't use all chocolate chips, I threw in a few butterscotch ones also.  I also used more of the crumb on the bottom than on the top.  It might have been better not to press down on them at the end also.

This was okay. You really need to like marshmallows to like this dish. Next time, I think I will use fewer marshmallows. My kids liked it, though.

These were soooooo delicious!  A hit at work!  There wasn't enough crust for the bottom and top, so I made these open-faced and put all of the crust on the bottom.  Usually I would give a recipe one less star because of a poor ingredient amount, but these were so good I can't help but give these a five star!

Yummy!  I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8 pan.  Like others, I put all of the graham cracker mixture on the bottom.  I baked a few extra minutes, until the marshmallows were golden brown.

Yummy! I improvised w7ith what I had...pre made/store bought graham cracker crust, threw big mallows in with dark choc, butterscotch, and milk chocolate chips. Baked until mallows were nice and brown. Hard to cut but soooo good. I think it would have been too sweet without the dark chocolate.

I made this for a fundraiser and it was gone in 45 minutes or less. Following another recommendation, I too, put all of the graham cracker mixture on the bottom.  I topped with milk choc chips and sprinkled mini semi-sweet chips over the marshmallows.  It was DEEEELISH!

I made this last night for the first time.  Everyone loved it.  I did what other reviewers suggested and put all the crust on the bottom.  It made for a nice presentation.  I personally think it's a bit on the sweet side.  I would totally cut down on the sugar next time.  Even now as i eat it the next day i personally think it taste sweeter from sitting over night if that's possible.  But totally a very easy and quick treat to make.

HUGE hit at both parties I brought this to. I took the advise of others and put all graham crumbs on the bottom, I also cooked it for five minutes prior to putting on chips and mallows. The only thing I will do differently is add a bit more butter, about a cup of the crumbs stayed on the bottom.

I love these bars! The best part of the recipe is that it is very flexible. For example, if you are a marshmallow lover, you can increase the amount of marshmallows and it doesnt take away from the recipe. Likewise, I like my graham crackers, so I used crumbled up graham crackers instead of graham cracker crumbs and it turned out great. This recipe is of course wonderful without any alterations! Will definitely make again!

Oh My God- SOOOO addicting!!  These are so quick and easy to make, so yummy, and gooey and slightly chewy and oh so fantastic!  Can you tell we liked them?  We devoured the first pan and we're on to making the 2nd! These are the best, maybe even better than the real thing!

Note: we did put all the crumb crust on the bottom and threw in an extra handful or so of marshmallows- Yum!

This was a fantastic, super easy dessert! I wish I had come across this earlier, like at the beginning of the summer, because there were plenty of times I was craving s'mores, and these would have hit the spot exactly. The only change I made was I put all the crust on the bottom and didn't leave any for the top. YUMMY!

Yummy. That's all that needs to be said. It's very yummy!  Easy to make. I had to put it in the fridge for a bit to cool before cutting otherwise it's just a mess. A VERY GOOD mess!

Great, hit at party.  I used a mixture of choc chips, butterscotch, white choc and peanut butter, I also cooked a little longer to crisp it up. I made it the day before.

i cant give less than a 5 because i did not  follow the recipe exactly so that wouldn't be  fair, but what i did turned out great. i didn't have any graham cracker crumbs so i improvised. I used smashed up pretzels mixed with cake crumbs (i had leftovers from a cake i made) and then i doubled the sugar. it turned out to be a great salty but sweet treat!

We added some chocolate chip cookie dough over the graham cracker crumbs.  Bake that for a few minutes, take it out, then add the chocolate chips and the marshmallows, and bake for ten minutes.  Amazing!!!

I'm not sure what happened but my "crust" never did set so mine couldn't really be considered bars.  I followed the directions exactly.  They tasted great and filled my craving for S'mores!  Next time I will try prebaking the crust before topping with the marshmallows and chocolate chips.

These were a little too chewy for us.  My boyfriend said I should add more graham cracker crust to it but he just wasn't very excited about these.
