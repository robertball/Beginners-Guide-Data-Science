When I tried it out the first time I halved the original recipe and it worked really well, but then once my group for my history project tried and liked it I tripled the recipe to give to the rest of my class and it was more difficult that time. It's still a great recipe though.

This was a wonderful flatbread. Made this bread to dip in balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Went really well with our soup also.

I would totally make it again but I would add a butter wash next time to get a more golden look.

Delicious!!

I don't know if I did anything wrong, but the bread tasted like pasta. I had to crisp it to a cracker in order to eat it. Making it was fun though
