In Response to Cookie Diva ... rather than putting down the recipe and rating it 0, why not simply substitute your own alfredo sauce for it. 1) some people like me don't have the time/energy to make my own sauce 2) can't afford it. Personally, I enjoy jarred alfredo, especially Ragu! You were quite rude and brash, especially for never trying the recipe.

Personally I poached my fillet with a bit of garlic and red wine. I use rotini because that's what was on sale (yup, that's right, on a super strict budget and can only afford the noodles on sale!! oh wow, why do I have salmon? because I live in Alaska!) ... so jarred alfredo, on sale noodles, and bay caught salmon ... this recipe was pretty divine!

Just fabulous!  The only change I made was to use white wine instead of vinegar when cooking the salmon.  I've made it several times already and will make it many more!

Wow, this was so good. I used the "famous restaurant alfredo sauce" recipe in place of the canned sauce. I also didn't toss it with the parmesan cheese.
Will use this recipe again and again. Thinking about replacing the salmon with shrimp and scallops next time.
Thanks!

This was a WONDERFUL recipe - our whole family enjoyed it, even my 2 year old.  We ended up making too much salmon for the original dish and ended up just buying more alfredo sauce and cooking up more rotini to eat it again the next night.  Super easy and it took about 20 minutes total to make - I just timed the cooking time of the salmon with the cooking time of the pasta.  
Thank you for sharing this recipe - will be added to my permanant recipe book at home!

I have not made this recipe but I don't know how anyone could use jarred alfredo sauce.  It is like glue and tastes gross!  If anything, use the alfredo sauce sold in the refrigerated section of the market or better yet, make your own!  It's so easy - sorry but I'll pass on this one.

This dish was okay.  Beware, it tastes like it came from the Olive Garden, so don't serve this to any one you want to impress!

I like this recipe for the ease and yum! I used Schwans salmon filets which are already fully cooked so i got to skip a step! I also added  broccoli. I really liked it-the kids aren't a huge fan of salmon but they ate it. Thanks!!!

Very good! I like to use salmon frequently in our diet and am always looking for new ways to serve it! I used this recipe with the "Lighter Fettuccini Alfredo" sauce on this website and really really enjoyed it! The garlic, onion, lemon, and spices went really well together! (the alfredo can use twice as much seasoning as listed)

delicious but I did make a half batch of homemade alfredo sauce to add to the jar to improve the store bought stuff and to stretch the entree out for more people.  Mega calories but who's counting...

Awesome, and quick.  I didnt have lemon juice so I used white wine and vinegar.  Added a little salt to the salmon and the sauce.  So, so , so yummy and easy.  Made a wonderful meal for my husband and I.

This dish was delicious and very easy to prepare. I had some friends over for dinner and a movie, and it was just the right type of dish for our informal gathering, and my friends took the recipe home with them. I used fettucine (cooked al dente) instead of rotini. I know this will go in my permanent cookbook.

I added 1 green pepper sliced thin and 1 clove garlic minced to the salmon before adding the lemon juice and vinegar. I also tossed 1 tbsp. chopped dried tomato {reconstituted after chopping)to the pasta, salmon and sauce.

Maybe it's because I'm only a moderate fan of alfredo sauce, but this dish is quite bland.

Diva is right!  Don't trash a recipe you refuse to try.  I have made this with fresh alfredo sauce and with homemade and both are great.  After a long day the jarred sauce works fine for us.  Great combo of flavors!  Thank you for sharing and I'm sorry someone was so rude.

This dish was incredibly easy to make and it was a hit w/my family.  I added a latin flavor to the dish by seasoning lightly the salmon w/Sazon (1/4 the pkg) and sprinkled white wine (1 TBS) along w/the lemon.

Nothing wrong with a recipe that's super-simple. If people want to upgrade things by making their own Alfredo sauce, all the better.

I did fine with Chef Emeril's sauce, and I added a cup of frozen peas which I cooked in the microwave while the pasta boiled. That eased some of my guilt about the fat content! It wouldn't hurt to add half a bag of baby spinach (plus additional lemon juice) either, if you really want to 'up' the veg content.

I took another reviewer's idea and added fresh broccoli florets to the  pasta while it was cooking (penne instead of rotini). Since I was using salmon that had already been cooked (thanks to my catering job), I added the dried basil and parsley to the Ragu classic alfredo sauce while it was heating. With about three minutes left for the pasta and broccoli to cook, I added the salmon to the sauce so that it would heat up without cooking more. It was so flavorful that there was no point in adding parmesan cheese! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was pretty good. I am looking for different ways to serve salmon, (instead of just with rice and veggies), and this was definitely different! I took suggestions from other reviewers and used white wine instead of the vinegar. I also added 1 clove of minced garlic to the wine & lemon juice, and tossed some chopped broccoli in with the pasta. I used Classico brand alfredo sauce. Everyone liked it, even my 2 year old! Lots of leftovers if you make the full amount in the recipe. Thanks for this!

This was really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly.  I found there wasn't quite enough sauce for the amount of noodles, but that wasn't detrimental. I should have cut the recipe in half also, since I just realized it serves eight, and that is totally true.

Awesome recipe. I made this for my guests but I made the following changes:
1. I replaced vinegar with white wine.
2. I added shrimp. I cooked shrimp in butter, white wine and lemon.
3. I baked salmon in white wine and vinegar (as this recipe specifies).
4. I made fresh "Alfredo Sauce" (4 cups Heavy Cream, 6 cups Parmesan Cheese, 4 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of chopped parsley).
Fantastic recipe. I highly recommend making your own Alfredo Sauce. The difference is significant.

Yummy!  Changed it up a bit by sautéing an onion and then using vodka sauce instead of Alfredo. I also used farfalle since we were out of rotini and added a little bit of dried jalapeño for some kick. So good; would absolutely make this again. This made a great base recipe.

If you like pasta dishes drowned in dairy and fish dishes that don't remotely taste like fish, you're in luck. Mostly flavorless, except for occasional acrid bites of lemon/vinegar soaked salmon. Please note: if you decide to make this anyway, DO NOT heat your sauce over medium heat. Low should do it. Otherwise, there's a good chance it will explode and scald you at some point when you go to stir it, and this meal really wasn't worth burnt fingers.

I served this deconstructed and let folks make their own - pasta, salmon, sauce, broccoli, cheese. It was a hit.  I will make again. I used Newman's Alfredo. I may try a different brand next time as it was not my favorite.

I used butter and paprika, as well as apple cider vinegar. It came together great!

I made half the recipe as written except realizing it needed more sauce, I used the whole jar for just half a recipe. Although we enjoyed the recipe, we thought the flavor needs more dimension as did others. Next time I want to add 1/2 tsp. of lemon pepper. I also like the idea of adding broccoli and maybe some carrots and mushrooms too.

The salmon taste was a little too overpowering for me. I think it would be better with less salmon and fresh ingredients like mushrooms, tomatoes, etc.

My kids LOVED it!  I have one who doesn't like Salmon or cheese and he loved it too!  My daughter just asked for it again (I made it last week).

Tasty!  It's good grub comfort food.  Used bow tie pasta and made my own alfredo sauce.  The lemon was a little strong from baking the fish, but I think with more cheese, it would balance it.
