We liked it, but it's a bit strong.   It has a great taste to it.  However, with 1 part Amaretto, 2 parts Vodka, and 1 part Irish Creme Liqueur,  and just a touch of Molasses , it can be a bit overwhelming for a morning drink.   Oh, BTW no Ginger.  That's in the cookies that are recommended to be served with it.  We'll likely make it again.  However, may experiment with it to help tone it down a bit.
