Delicious! I made just a few changes - I added several cloves of chopped garlic and added the juice of a lemon to the sauce. I used the large sea scallops, they're a little pricey, but worth the cost. Also, I sauteed the scallops separately in a pan sprayed with lemon flavored non-stick spray, 2 minutes or so each side, then put them in the sauce for just a minute before serving. I like the texture of sauteed scallops better than those cooked in a sauce. The fresh ginger is so much better than the bottled stuff. Will be making this again and again, thanks!

Great Aroma and Great over rice as suggested - might want to consider cooking the scallops prior to adding to pan since the moisture relased by the scallops made for a much longer cooking time in order to get the reduction in sauce needed - my wife had the leftover sauce over rice for breakfast - thanks

My family couldn't get enough of this one.  I didn't have fresh ginger root so I subbed the spice powder--tasted incredible.  A keeper.

All I can say is WOW. For such an easy recipe, this is awesome. I used a little Taylor dry sherry instead of white wine and just saute'd it until the alcohol smell went away. Also I used condensed milk instead of heavy cream. I also cut down on the ginger by 1/2 to give it a more subtle taste and it blended in great with the other flavors so you don't know if it's ginger or a mixture of other spices.
  I also tried it per the recipe and it's also great!!!!! My haats off to Jeanne.

Great recipe. I had worried that the ginger would be very strong, but it was perfect. I added sliced mushrooms instead of carrots and left out the last 2 tbls of butter. I didn't reduce the sauce as much as it needed so it was more soupy than saucy, but my husband and I planned it that way. We had it in a dish and ate it like soup. Thanks for the recipe.

I can't stand cooked carrots, so I left them out of Jeanne's recipe.

It was a totally melt-in-the-mouth delicious meal.  I had it over rice, and a side of fresh asparagus.

I substituted shallots for the onions, and as suggested previously, I seared the scallops in a separate pan.  I served this dish with pasta shells & portobello mushrooms and it was terrific. A definite keeper.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  Next time I make it my boyfriend wants me to double the recipe to make sure we have more leftovers.  I couldn't find ginger root at the store I was at, so I just used fresh ground ginger, and it tasted fine.  We had it with brown rice, which I thought soaked up a lot of the flavor of the sauce, so I probably won't use that again.  We also had steamed asparagus and poured the sauce and scallops over that and it really brought out the flavor in the dish.  We loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again!!

This was fabulous.  Adding the 2 final tbs of butter seemed like senseless violence so I skipped that.  I seared the scallops, and found the salt and pepper I'd added to the sauce wasn't enough after adding the scallops so be sure to taste the scallops too before serving.

I messed up the recipe with the amount of wine used, so I tried to counter balance it with more cream. It turned out quite soupy and a color that was quite unappealing! Even though they looked unappetizing, they tasted really nice! My boyfriend may have just been being sweet ((valentine's day)) but he said they were one of the best he has had. I'm sure if I had made them closer to the recipe they would have been phenomenal! I also added some flour to thicken the sauce...helped salvage what I messed up in the first place!

Having read previous reviews for this recipe I made it last night and blended sea and bay scallops, but cooked them separately before adding into the sauce.  I also substituted ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh root.  This was delicious, served with brown rice, a salad, and garlic bread.  Jason said I have to make this again.

This recipe is easy and SO delicious! We were blown away by how good it tasted. The ginger and carrots go perfectly together and bring out the best in the scallops.

I made this with scallops and shrimp last evening, but felt that the taste was a little bland and too heavy.  Probably won't make again.

I like the idea of carrots and scallops cooked at the same time but i feel like the dish would be better if the sauce and carrots where cooked in one pan while the scallops where seared in another. Then pour the sauce over top. I would not make this recipe again. Not enough flavor for the amount of fat involved.

Gah, my sauce curdled so I blended it - but then it separated.  I did use half and half instead of full cream so maybe that's what happened.  However, it was still very tasty.

It was ok. The sauce didn't stick or penetrate into the scallops.  It was tasty on the carrots though.  Too much work for what you got out of it.

Fabulous!  easy. I did add a clove of galic.  The carrot adds nice color, and I might put a little parsle for color too. My company went crazy for it and they have the recipe too now!

I loved this dish!  the flavors mix so well together, and is wonderful served over wild rice.  i took advice from other reviews and cooked the scallops slightly before adding to the sauce mixture, and the texture came out very nice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! I seared the scallops first. Then made the sauce then added the scallops in at the end and you don't need the extra butter at the end.

Very good! Like others, I decided to saute the carrots and sear my scallops, make the sauce in the pan seperately and serve it over them. I ended up reducing the sauce quite a bit to get it to a thicker consistency and then added my salt & pepper at the end. I really loved the different flavor of this sauce -  Thanks!

I have this same recipe in my collection for many years now.  First found it in a Better Homes and Garden cookbook that I bought off the discount rack.  Loved it then, and still love it now.  I use more onions and cook the scallops first to give them a nice sear.  I re-add them to the sauce near the end to let the flavors blend.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I really liked the sauce.  However, I could have done a better job rinsing the scallops, so, word to the wise, rinse them well!!

Wonderful! I seared the scallops in a separate saute pan, and added 1/2 teaspoon sugar to cut the tanginess, but the scallop-lover in my house was all over it!

This was very good!  My hubby loved it!  We are on vacation and have been eating out a lot so I decided to cook dinner since we are in a well stocked condo. We love scallops so gave it a try.  Pretty easy except I didn't have a way to mince  the ginger root.  Did the best I could and turned out fine.  The only things I did different was to cook the scallops separate.  Also after reading reviews I add the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  Next time I don't think I will add it.  Severed over angel hair pasta with sautéed green beans!  Yummy

OMG! Lost this recipe, just found it. If you have small scallops this is a great recipe to prepare them. Also a touch of curry is nice with this recipe.

The carrots seem weird, but they are really good.  Use Sea Scallops, they are much better for this recipe

Wow! This was great. I made a few alterations...substituted mushrooms for the carrots, and added coconut milk and some cilantro. Cooked it all up and served over Spaghetti. The whole family loved it, and it was easy!! Will definitely be making this one again!

Excellent!  I was confused by cooking the scallops for only a minute but they were perfect.  Do not cook over 1 minute because they will get chewy by overcooking!

Oh My Goodness!  I was lacking on the quantity of scallops but made the full sauce recipe.  I had made an oriental pork roast, fried rice, and a vegetable stir fry for my family.  I'm the only seafood lover in this family but my non-scallop eaters ate all of the scallops.  When we were cleaning up after dinner I told my husband to save the sauce because I will eat that sauce on plain rice.  It is so good.  I'm going to throw some shrimp in the next time I make it.  Stupid scallop stealing people that I live with...Stole My Dinner. LOL!!!

This recipe was very good, and it was very simple. In making this recipe, I omitted the carrots, and added a clove of garlic for flavor. Also, I grated the ginger instead of mincing; It was easier. I too cooked the scallops first, then cooked the sauce after. One thing I would advise people to use less of is the salt : it throws off the ginger in the dish, and makes the sauce salty. Other than that, the sauce was perfect with the scallops. In all, this was a great dish

We've recently had a new seafood shop open up in town and they get "Digby Scallops" in once a week. Tried this recipe and it was a huge hit.  Only change I made was I did not cook the scallops in the sauce just to avoid overcooking them.  I fried them for a couple of minutes then served them with the sauce on top. Huge Hit !!!

Though the ginger/wine/cream combo was tasty, this was not a favorite. One minute is not long enough to cook the scallops and they drew so much moisture that the sauce was watery. I might try again and would sear the scallops first as suggested by others.

This is an excellent recipe!  The fresh ginger and green onion are refreshing without overpowering the taste of scallop.  It is a wonderful combination.  I served this dish with rice and everyone was praising about it.  I brought sea scallop which are bigger than regular scallop, and I cooked it for about 2 mins on each side.
Thanks!

This was great! I didn't think the scallops would cook enough with just the one minute suggested by the recipe, so I seared them about a minute and 1/2 on both sides before adding them to the sauce. They were still moist and not overdone.

Bravo! I had some Colossal Scallops flown in from Alaska that I felt deserved special treatment.  This recipe exceeded my expectations.  My husband thought I should make it for company and charge a fee at the door ...it was that good!   I tip my hat to you, Miss Jones.

What could go wrong with cream,wine and butter? Well, the mild taste of delicious scallops was lost. Searing them first might have helped like other reviewers suggested.

Delicious!  Following the advice of others I added garlic with the onions, and a pinch of curry with the ginger.  I added a 1/4 c more of wine and cream since the sauce got such rave reviews.  I seared the scallops alone then poured sauce over the top when serving it.  Everyone loved it,  and every plate was cleaned!  Thanks everyone for submitting the recipe and the tweaks.

I loved this recipe, but I agree with most cooks, scallops need to be seared in butter separately rather than steamed in the sauce. I added garlic to the recipe and a bit of lemon juice (but be very conservative with it as it might make your dish too tart) and skipped the carrots. A truly awesome sauce, served with with rice and stir fried green beans. Definitely a keeper!

I just made the recipe and followed some of the suggestions, such as less butter, some minced garlic, some lemon juice, i used sherry since i did not had white wine and also i did sauted the scallops independently and the juice  that was left on the pan, i added it at the last to the sauce. I did not have heavy cream so i used condensed milk as suggested by another review. The carrots were crunchy, and the scallops had a tangy gingery flavor to it. Definetely on my favorites recipes.

I was out of heavy cream and so I had to substitute for half-n-half. I think it would have been better had I used heavy cream. I also think the ginger was a little too strong and overpowered the dish.

I seared the scallops prior to adding  them to the sauce & I also added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. (both recommended in reviews and I'm glad I followed)   We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe but will triple the sauce next time as my husband and I like the tasty things that are not so good for us.  :-)  We served it over angel hair pasta.  Wonderful recipe and so easy to make.  Thank you for the share!

Everyone, including my mother-in-law, who is the main cook in the house, thought this was good. I'm just starting to cook. So I have been collecting and doing recipes all throughout this website. The ginger to this recipe I believe is what makes it work. I didn't even sear the scallops all the way and it didn't overcook once I added it to the sauce. I will make this again. Thanks!

I went and bought scallops at some horrendous price, just to make this.  I tasted it before serving, and like Beth I found it quite insipid.  I read another viewers remark about the lemon, so I added that.  It made the difference and the whole thing turned out quite delicious.  I agree with Doug Matthews that it would be better to fry the scallops before putting them to finish in the sauce.   I must add, that apart from salt, pepper or chillies. I always follow a recipe the first time.
