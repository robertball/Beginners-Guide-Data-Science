Classic pound cake recipe (too bad the title doesn't indicate that).  Standard, tried and true ingredients as well as their measurements, and clear and accurate directions.  I made half a recipe in an 8x4" loaf pan with a few minor modifications since I wanted a lemon pound cake: for half recipe I omitted the vanilla.  I used 2 T. fresh lemon juice and enough milk to equal the 1/2 cup called for.  Rather than split a half egg, I just used 2 eggs.  I also added about 2 tsp. lemon zest and a pinch of salt.  Bake about 50-55 minutes.  Perfect lemon pound cake, with a dense yet tender crumb that's neither too dry nor too greasy (I've tried one of those on this site!).  Good, reliable recipe.

There aren't any reviews, so I thought I would try it and it turned out excellent! Not too sweet, my korean friends devoured it quickly! It was a little dryer than I expected, but it could have been me on any step! I'll make it again!!

I looked online to try and find out if there was a history behind the name of this cake but unfortunately I could not find anything.  Yes, like some of the other reviews have said this is just a pound cake, but a very sweet pound.  I only used 2.5 cups of sugar and it was way too sweet.

I've been using this recipe since 2009 and everyone loves when I make it. I usually do lemon flavoring and vanilla. Add a little more milk and a couple spoons of mayonaise to make it moist. Then after its baked I like to melt butter and milk and add some lemon flavoring and powdered sugar and make a glaze. Delicious!  5 stars!

Wonderful Pound Cake! (it is too bad the tile doesn't call it pound cake) I loved how easy the recipe was and also it's great that I didn't need anything "extra"- this is all stuff I keep in my house all the time. Very flavorful moist, dense cake. I made in a 10" tube pan and turned it out while still cool and added my favorite lemon glaze- 1c sugar 1/3 c lemon juice and brushed it on while still warm. Once cooled it makes the outside a nice crispy texture and adds good flavor. I cannot wait to bake this again! I bought it to my ladies bible study and it was the first cake I've brought that was all gone! Very great recipe!
