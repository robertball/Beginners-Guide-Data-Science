Excellent!  I made a triple recipe.  Fried them up and have them in the freezer for a quick breakfast. (Just pop one right from the freezer into the microwave for 2 min.)  Also, if a few specks of green or red don't bother you, don't bother to peel the apples.  I using the tubes of ground turkey, you might need to add an egg for a better consistency.

My son who hates sausage, loves this recipe!!! The only thing I did different was use wild rice instead of brown.
