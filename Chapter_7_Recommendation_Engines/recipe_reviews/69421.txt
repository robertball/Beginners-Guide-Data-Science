Very nice recipe, but not anything like hot and sour soup - more similar to miso soup if anything.  But highly recommended all the same.

Such a delicious soup!  I may never go out to Chinese food again!  I did make a few modifications based on my personal preferences and what was available.  I added some sesame oil while cooking because I've read that is the secret ingredient to asian foods in general.  I garnished with sesame seeds.  I left out the rice vinegar because I didn't have any (and because I like my soup a little less sour) and subbed lemon juice for citric acid.  I threw in some chopped celery leaves because I like the flavor.  I used the chili garlic paste (rooster on front, green lid), ~1 tbsp, and it was VERY HOT... will probably decrease that next time.  But oh my, was it GOOD!!!

The reviewer before me said that this soup was more like miso and I have to disagree with that.  It's definitely hout and sour soup and I like the fact that all of these ingredients were easy to find (I live in a small town) and the soup was easy to make.  i'm fighting a cold and that's why I chose this recipe.  It definitely got the job done for me.  It's a good "feel-better" hot and sour soup.

Delicious!!  Be sure to add the chili paste and rice vinegar to taste.  I also added miso paste and bits of dried seaweed (there's a better asian name for this) that I didn't know what to do with; not traditional, but great addition.

Very good recipe, and just what the doctor ordered to cure my sore throat!   I didn't have cabbage or mushrooms on hand, so skipped those.  I also wanted to make it a little spicier so i added 1 TBSP Chinese-style Chili Garlic sauce, another 1 TBSP pureed fresh ginger root, and instead of the citric acid, I used 2 TBSP lime juice.  Delicious!

This is a very easy and quick soup recipe but tastes nothing like a traditional hot and sour soup.  I will probably not make again.

This is a good recipe!  I felt quite healthy after eating. I modified it only a little bit.  Instead of silken tofu I used firm, which was fine.  I also thinly sliced two cloves of garlic and threw them in with the green onions.  Drizzled 2 eggs instead of 1.  Used 6 cups of water instead of 4, but only used 4 cups worth of veggie boullion.  Finally, used red Thai curry paste, and low-sodium soy sauce.  I'm unsure where the "sour" comes from - I used double the rice vinegar (love vinegar) and it wasn't really very sour at all.  It was good though, with the extra water added and low-sodium soy, it was nicely balanced and not too salty at all.

Absoutely amazing!  I didn't use the thai chili sauce, as I didn't have any on hand.  Without it this is still absolutely fantastic.  A shame there is so much sodium, perhaps using low sodium broth and soy sauce would remedy that.

I really liked this more than I expected I would.  I added a bit of water because I like a lot of broth in my soups, used extra firm tofu, added 2 extra Tbsp. of Thai chile sauce for heat, and used lemon juice in place of citric acid powder.  All very small changes, and very happy with the results.  Simple and yummy!

This is a hearty soup that will satisfy non-vegetarians.  My guests spooned it over rice and ate it as a sort of casserole.  I didn't have thai curry paste, so I used a small spoonful of Indian curry paste.

great flavor..will make again. It was very salty and I had to alter it to suit our tastes. I did add a few cups of water, doubled the cabbage, mushroom and egg...maybe next time I will add less soy sauce or use reduced sodium soy and broth. Either way it was a great base. THX :)

I couldn't buy rice vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. I used a savory cabbage, which was perfect. Of course I adjusted to my tastes, but it is delightful. I made it for my mom who is sick on Mothers Day. I have a feeling with the vinegar, tofu and broth she will be feeling better soon.

I've never had Cantonese Hot and Sour Soup so I'm not going to compare this recipe with anything else. I doubled the recipe, used extra firm tofu, and yellow onions (because I didn't have any green). At first it was rather bland and not very spicy at all so I ended up adding more soy sauce and chili sauce. I don't care too much for sour so I did not add more vinegar. Turned out very good!

Wow!  This was very good.  I rate this a 4 star because of its simplicity.  I liked how the cabbage was still "crunchy" and not overdone.  I was looking for a low calorie low fat soup and this did the trick. I used low fat firm tofu and fat free chicken stock b/c I didn't have vegetable broth on hand and turned out great!

Very simple and easy to make. It's is tasty, but the flavor lacks the complex, rich flavor of a really good H&S soup. But the description doesn't promise restaurant quality, it promises a good country style soup with little fuss. In that sense, it delivers well.

I give this one five stars just because it is so easy.  My hubby who loves hot and sour soup gives it a 3 1/2.  I thought it was great!

Tasted very close to what you get at a restaurant.  I almost always have all of these ingredients on hand.  Next time I will add some more traditional ingredients like tree ears and bamboo.  Couldn't get enough of this soup, and it gets even better after it sits overnight.

The soup might not look like there is enough liquid, but as the mushrooms cook, their liquid will add plenty to the soup.

I thought this recipe was awesome and it was very similar to the hot and sour soup I get at my favorite local chinese resturant. the only changes I just made two changes: I used sirracha hot sauce because couldnt find the thai chile paste and I used lemon juice instead of citric acid. I'm not sure why some of the reviewers were complaining about the soup not being authentic thai hot and sour soup because the author clearly states that that is not the point of the recipe.

I really liked this one.  I used a very spicy Thai chili sauce, 2 tablespoons vinegar, low-sodium soy sauce, left out the mushrooms, and added in some white onion.

I don't think the soup was authentic hot and sour soup, but i was craving something that reminded me of my moms cooking, so I was pretty happy with the flavors.

The slower you cook this, the better - asian flavors can be delicate and if you add too much thai chili sauce, you can overpower the other flavors. I halved this recipe (cooking for 1-2) and it turned out well. Didn't have thai chili sauce, but had a hot chinese three-pepper sauce that worked as well. I like spicy, but not at the expense of covering up the other ingredients.

This was great and Hubby loves it too! I had to substitute due to lack of a few ingredients on hand.  I used 6 cups water and 1 individual miso cup pack instead of veg broth; small onion thinly sliced (no green ones at home); about 8 shitake mushrooms; plus 1/2 thinly sliced carrot.  I forgot to add the egg.  Since I upped the liquid, I used 2 Tb rice vinegar and 4 Tb tamari soy sauce.  I also threw in a handful of sliced water chestnuts that I had left over from another recipe.  It turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe : )

Fast and easy!  I couldn't find "Thai Chili Sauce" so I used Tobanjan, and garlic paste.
