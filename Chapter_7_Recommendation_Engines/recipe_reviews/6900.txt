Outstanding!  Absolutely outstanding!  My darling hubby has been asking for chicken and dumplings for months.  With the weather turning a bit cooler, I decided to give this recipe a try.  I was not disappointed, and neither was he.  These are absolutely delicious.  I used butter rather than margarine and I used two tablespoons rather than one.  These were light, fluffy and so tender.  I followed the recipe and some of the suggestions by other reviewers.  Mix only until incorporated, add to simmering (not boiling) liquid and put a lid on it!  Leave the pot alone for the full 15 minutes.  This is now our family dumpling recipe.  Thank you Carol's Mom.

I made these to go in "Grandma's Chicken Noodle Soup" and instead of making large dumplings, I made very small ones as requested by my kids, so that they would be bite sized.  The recipe was easy to follow, and the resulting soup was so incredibly good.  It's a definite keeper!

I am traumatized from a childhood of eating Bisquick dumplings. This recipe has healed me! I made a simple chicken soup by boiling the chicken and adding carrots, celery and a few potatoes. The dumplings are so tender, flavorful and comforting, they thickened the soup to a perfect consistancy. My kids love it too! It's a great change from noodles or rice.

I used cooking oil for the fat.  They came out great.  The secret my mom taught me to making "dough boys" as we used to call them is to dip your spoon in the liquid between each dumpling so that the batter doesn't stick to the spoon while scooping.  The dough slides right off the spoon.

Good recipe. One taster said it tasted like a biscuit. The buttermilk dumplings I made at the same time were "voted" better. I've read that melting the butter and adding it with the milk has the same or better result. Just a thought for anyone who wants to try this recipe. Worth making.

I wanted to make the Chicken and Dumplings III, submitted by Melissa, but I didn't have any canned bisquits.  Since it was raining I really didn't want to go to the store so I looked up dumplings and found this recipe.  I'm so glad I did, I just wish I would of made a double batch!!!

Food Processor Version: WOW! This is the first time I ever made homemade dumplings, fluffy, delicious and much healthier than ready made biscuit dough. I made them in a food processor IN SECONDS as following! I added the flour, salt, bp, sugar, and the 1 tbsp of dried parsley and pulsed a few seconds. I think butter is much healthier than margarine and followed some reviews and used 2 tablespoons of cold butter, but don't think the extra Tbsp was really necessary.  I pulsed until incorporated, then added the cold milk and pulsed just until the dough pulled together as a ball - not more. I gathered the ball, cut up in pieces with knife, dropped them in my simmering brothy soup and watched them puff up delightfully!-make sure you have enough liquid and let simmer. Do not remove lid during the process!. They tasted awesome and we all loved them. The ingredient ratios are spot on- Don't change anything! EXCELLENT dumplings Carol!

These dumpling were yummy! One thing that drew me to try them was there was no egg! I love eggs, but not overpowering the flavor of the dumplings. They were easy to make. The only thing if you are a dumpling lover is make the recipe times three. I only doubled it and still had plenty of broth for more. For my family, chicken and dumpling are just that, nothing else.......no veggies, nothing. This recipe is a keeper for us.Thanx!

I believe I figured out why some reviewers found the dumplings in the recipe to be "gummy", the water wasn't hot enough to fully cook the dumplings and it gets all gummy. I remade my batch bc it was just that all gummy and goopy, good thing I cooked them separate from my Chicken Parkiash. 

Make sure your water is a LIGHT boil before you add the dumplings, then reduce to simmer with lid on- (JUST LIKE THE DIRECTIONS INSTRUCT!)so you don't make them tough and chewy. I did just that, plus I don't like the way it changes the texture of the dish when you add directly to the soup/stew-guess it depends on what you were raised on?

Plus to address those ppl who found it bland, perhaps you should try it again only use real butter, cold from fridge and add more salt, pepper, parsley as the option offers and I added 1 t each onion and garlic powder plus some chicken granulated bullion, just like 1/2t to the dry ingredients, this made an AMAZING recipe.

On its own it is quite tasty I only offered the suggestions to those concerns.

This is the exact recipe my Grandma used! These dumplings are soooo tasty! I will have to try them with stews as my Grandma always made these when she made chicken and dumplings. This recipe has gotten lost over the years for me and my recipe box, so thanks for sharing your recipe!
*If anyone has kitchen "helpers" the main thing is to make sure they know NOT to take the lid off for a "looksee". I did that once to my Grandma's dumplings as it smelled so good that I just had to take a "peek". It was disasterous to how her dumplings with the steam escaping and then how her dumplings came out as not the fluffy cloud like dumplings they were supposed to be. I can't stress enough the part of Carol's recipe that says to keep the lid on!

I found that forming the dough into small balls, keeps the dumplings from falling apart.

These are wonderful!  Light and fluffy with a perfect texture in the middle.  I did use the food processor to cut the butter into the flour.  Instead of six large dumplings I made much smaller ones. I recommend making a double batch.  Ours seemed to vanish before dinner so I had to make more. Gee, I can't figure out what happened to them. (OKAY, SO WE ATE A BUNCH OF THEM AS THEY WERE COOKING!)
To the poster whose dumplings disintegrated while cooking.. try lowering the heat.  A gentle simmer and these are perfect!  Thanks, Carol!

Great recipe!  I added a bit more salt because I felt it needed it.  Start at 1 teaspoon and adjust up according to your taste.  I found that bigger spoonfuls (like a tea spoon) made a good size.  If you make them too small they get a bit gooey on the outside and doughy on the inside.  A bigger dollop gives them room to fluff up inside.  They are wonderful fluffy!  I didnt cover them but rather flipped them over because my chicken and dumplings boiled over (twice!) when I covered them to simmer.  Next time I will try adding complimentary spices like fresh parsely and make them all the big fluffy size!

I have used this recipe so many times over the past few months.  I make my own chicken soup from scratch and this is the perfect addition.  First time I've ever made dumplings and this recipe is so straightforward and easy.  I substitute butter for the margarine (and I use a little extra.)  I use cold butter, cut it into small cubes and incorporate it by hand... the technique hasn't failed me yet!  Getting ready to eat another fabulous dinner of chicken and dumplings!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were the best ever! I make a chicken stew with dumplings; we loved the stew but never cared for the dumplings. After reading the reviews on this recipe, I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 Tbsp dried parsley flakes. I didn't think they were going to turn out well because my dough was so sticky. It was sticking to the spoon and my fingers as I tried to get the dumplings onto the boiling stew. But I resisted taking off the lid to check to see if they were turning into a gooey mess, and let them cook covered for 15 minutes. And they were excellent with the stew. Really kind of fluffy on the inside, yet still moist. My husband and I thank you my new go-to recipe for dumplings.

These are phenomenal. I had to do a few minor tweaks, like the 2 tablespoons of butter instead of just one. I cut it in, mixed every so lightly with the milk and then dropped them in. The first batch I accidentally went to 20 minutes and they mushed up but the kids didn't mind.

I ended up making 3 batches so far (pork, sauerkraut and dumplings) and I think I may need another one. If your family is big (and in it for the dumplings) just one batch isn't enough!

These are downright delicious. Tried with parsley one batch and pepper with another. You really can't seem to go wrong if you follow the recipe and keep to 15 minutes with a lid on simmer!

These were incredible! So good! The way I did it was to boil chicken and add seasonings of whatever you'd like (it's the only way I like to make it - it's healthy!) and after the chicken has been cooking to the point where it's almost done, I take some of the seasoned chicken broth water from the chicken pot and used that to cook my dumplings in another pan. It turned out amazing!! GREAT RECIPE! Will use again!

Tasty!  I used half-and-half instead of milk, because I needed to use it up.  My only caution is don't mix too much!  If you stir until just encorporated, then let it sit for a few minutes, the dumplings will be light and fluffy.  The last few I added to my soup turned out a tougher consistency because I scraped them up from the bottom of the bowl.  I added fresh chives and parsley to mine and they were perfect in the "Irish Chicken and Dumplings" from this site.

These turned out exceptionally well. my family adores soups and stews, and they're made all the better by dumplings. This has been my go to recipe for my chicken and dumplings for a while now. And your kitchen sounds a lot like ours.

Absolutely amazing! Would give more stars if possible! These dumplings are what you were waiting for. I used butter (slightly more than 1 tablespoon) and perhaps a tiny bit too much milk, but they still turned out perfect cooked in a slow-cooker beef stew. Mix in milk until just incorporated with dry ingredients, too much mixing will toughen the dough! I can't wait to try these with various herbs and perhaps even mustard powder for a bit of a kick. Seriously, make these tonight!

These dumplings are delicious!! They were sooo easy to make and tasted amazing in our chicken soup. This will be my go-to dumpling recipe now. I did melt the butter and add it with the milk as was suggested in other reviews.

I usually leave out the sugar, but otherwise this is a great base recipe.

Followed exactly.  Made 12 dumplings, I don't know how many this was supposed to make, but they took way longer than 15 minutes to cook.  They taste good, but my texture was a little off.  If I knew what size "spoonful" to drop these from, I may have had better results.  Would add a little salt next time, and possibly some garlic or onion powder to jazz them up a bit.  I'll stick to my "rolled" dumpling recipe from this site.

This is the best dumpling recipe for any kind of stew.  It will thicken your stew as well as make light and fluffy dumplings to enjoy.  If i could reccommend anything, it would to be sure not to over-mix and let the dough rest for a few minutes in the fridge.  Thanks!

Love love love the texure, nice and firm yet fluffy... even better the next day!  Do yourself a favor and make these with buttermilk.  If you find the batter a little too stiff add a little water or regular milk.  Only giving 4 stars though because I thought they were a little bland.  My mom always adds seasonings to hers.. pepper, garlic powder and onion powder... shoulda listened to mom, she's always right! lol

This was my first time making dumplings from scratch. They turned out to be really easy and delicious! I didn't have parsley, so I added some Italian seasoning. That was a great choice. I also used real butter instead of margarine, something I do for everything I make.  This is a great recipe!

they were a hit! my family likes the flat thinner style dumplings...kinda like cracker barrel but smaller...so i dusted the counter with flour and rolled out the dough like a pizza crust and cut into strips. i made sure that i put plenty of flour on the counter to cover both sides of the dough so that they wouldnt stick or be gummy...they turned out perfect!

Perfect!  Don't add too much milk though, (like I did the first time)  because even though the dough is easier to work with, it falls apart too much in the soup/broth/stew..  Stick to what it says.  Yum!

So good. I used 1/2 cup milk and powdered buttermilk to make buttermilk dumplings and they turned out wonderful and my two toddlers and hubby loved them! I usually make dinner rolls with my soups but this is just as good but quicker. I will make these a again, thank you for the great recipe!!

These were good, I made some like the recipe said, my family liked them. I also made them with whole wheat flour, left out the sugar, butter spread, and lowfat milk. They turned out just fine for chicken and dumplings!

These were the best dumplings we have ever had!!!  So wonderful and delicious! We followed the directions exactly, doubled it, and also used a couple of readers tips that really helped, like spray the spoon when putting them in the pan, and only mixing until ingredients are incorporated, and gently simmering.  They were beautiful, didn't fall apart at all, fully cooked in the middle, and not chewy.  Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is EXACTLY how my mum taught us how to make dumplings :) my mum just recently passed away and I miss her so much! I needed an answer today for something in cooking and said mum will know, and then it hit me , I couldn't call her :(  we always had these in beef stew and they are amazing! One little thing I've recently added to them when I made chicken and dumplings, is a few dashes of summer savory . just a little savory flavor for something different. Very tasty! But ratingthe recipe as is...... Ten star all tthe way!!! Nice to know someone had a mum like mine :-)

These were great! I used them to give variety and stretch out some cans of veggie soup that I had on my shelf, and I was glad that it worked so well.  I have also used them in other canned soups, as well as homemade ones.  I love to use this recipe when I just need to mix things up for a change!

I was struggling with how to rate this recipe because I wasn't sure whether it was supposed to taste so much like a biscuit, which I don't care for.  (I realize that's just a personal preference of mine). I did love the texture though!

These were fantastic! I was a little scared of the sugar when I first made the recipe, but I like to try recipes "as is" the first time I try them. BRAVO! BRAVO! The directions and ingredients are just right. I had never tried dumplings as an adult, and this brought back so many wonderful childhood food memories. Thank you!

These turned out great. Next time I will use more liquid...two cups of broth was pushing it. But the dumplings did thicken up the liquid wonderfully and they were light and delicious, thanks for a wonderful egg-free dumpling!

These were exactly the type of dumplings I was looking to make.  I followed the recipe exactly aside from using butter instead of margarin, put dough in fridge until my chicken soup was done, then spooned in dollops of dough... they turned out perfectly, fluffy & tastey.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Solid dumpling recipe! Made according to recipe. Hand kneaded at the end and formed into little balls. Dropped in 4 cups of chicken broth with carrots, peas and corn. Looked just like the dumplings from Kung Fu Panda which is what my kids requested :)

I made Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings by: Janiece Mason, but I didn't have any biscuits so I tried this recipe and used dried parsley and added another tbsp of butter. I rolled the dough out, cut 1" squares and put it in with the chicken about 1 1/2 hours before serving. My family loved it and it was so easy to make. Thank you

I'm not sure what happened, I followed the recipe to a T and they ended up much too gooey and sticky. I could hardly form the dough at all. I made these to use up the last bit of flour I had so I didn't have any more flour to add to the dough to try and thicken it up. What a waste of ingredients- And I was really looking forward to some good dumplings too.

This is the all time best chicken and dumplings I have ever had the pleasure to make.  AND OH, I forgot to put the eggs in the dumplings to, and had to make my own buttermilk, but they still tasted great.

Loved it, and recommend it to all.

I found myself short on time & needed something great to whip up QUICK. This recipe was my lifesaver!   I cooked these simply in water w/a few bouillon cubes & a handful of frozen mixed veggies.  Served it with mashed potatoes & a salad... My hungry fam of 5 loved it!  (Even my extremely picky husband.)

After reading all the great ratings, I am disappointed that these did not turn out well. The dough was very sticky which made it difficult to make decent sized balls. I think melting the butter rather than adding it softened would help a lot. When I added the balls to the stew, they got stuck together and didn't cook all the way in the middle. The inside of the dumplings were crumbly (like a stale biscuit) and the outside did not mesh well with the stew's liquid. Oh well. I shall be looking for another recipe!

Yum!  I had never attempted to make dumplings from scratch before and WOW - was I pleased with the results!!!  I used these in the Chicken and Dumplings III recipe submitted by Melissa.  Awesome and perfect! So light and fluffy!  My husband and I were both super impressed! Excellent!

Finally after failing with other recipes I have found one that is a keeper. They turned out light and fluffy for me. I had to double the batch though. Thanks for a great recipe! We actually got to eat some dough boys (what we call dumplings) that weren't hard and gooey!

This recipe is perfect! Only thing I changed was the amount I made and making very small dumplings. I would suggest doubling the recipe if not more, depending on family size. I used these dumplings with a pot of chicken that had been seasoned and simmered all day long and it was the best chicken and dumplings I have ever made. I have already shared this recipe with several friends and will be using this recipe from now on!

This is almost like my Momma's recipe except she added one egg and rolled out the dough thin but not real thin and cut the dough into 1/2 inch or smaller squares. She put them into boiling broth and covered with a lid for about 5 mins or so then cooked uncovered until the dumplings were done. They were so light and fluffy not to mention yummy!

I made a double batch of the dumplings with stewed chicken and they were indeed delicious.  My family thoroughly enjoyed them to the last bite.  They requested that I make MORE next time!!  I may need to invest in a bigger stew pot.

They haven't finished cooking but I did pull one out and I can tell you THEY ARE AWESOME!! They smell, look and taste the old fashioned way! It thickened up my broth for my chicken and dumplings and made it so much more hearty- just like grandmas!! I CAN NOT live without this recipe!! They are just SO perfect! The only thing I did was double the recipe and add a little bit more butter. Thank you so very very much for sharing this classic!

I made this tonight, super easy and came out fantastic, everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and made a lot of broth to go with it, probably 8-10 cups broth. The broth thickened just right from the flour and the dumplings were to die for. Keeper!

These were easy to make & very delicious! I melted the butter & stirred it in with the milk. Way better than Bisquick (and none of the trans fat)!  I doubled the recipe & used them for my Chicken & Dumplings recipe.  I'll definitely make these again!

These turned to mush in my Chicken Soup.  This might work for a thick stew, but definately not in a broth based soup.

Easy recipe!  Only changed the recipe by adding 1/2 tsp sugar and a tsp of garlic powder. Came out nice and fluffy, with a great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Wow! This is the very first time I have eaten or made dumplings. A-mazing. Delicious. Easy. I put them in a chicken soup I had already made. So great. I registered to allrecipes just to say this. I am very enthusiastic about dumplings.

Update: it's been a year or more since my last review, and I always make dumplings when I make soup now, and I always use this recipe. Great recipe, thank you to Carol who posted it!

I used to make dumplings out of Bisquick... heck, I made everything out of Bisquick, until I discovered just how easy everything it replaces is, and how much tastier it is, and these are no exception!  These are doughy and soft and just a little bit chewy... everything a delicious dumpling should be.  I used it in chicken stew, and substituted basil for parsley, but they were phenomenal, and so easy!

We absolutely love these dumplings!  I put them on hamburger stew, chicken stew, beef stew...  Light and fluffy and super easy to make.  Just DON'T LET THE KIDS LIFT THE LID!  LOL  No changes required other than to double the recipe because you wont have enough.

I made this with Red Mill wheat free flour and it came out great. I mixed some fresh basil with half the mixture and they are amazing. It added a little basil flavor to my beef stew and they made my broth a little more gravy like! YUM. This recipe is simple and easy, thanks so much for a great find!

I must have done something wrong, since this recipe has gotten so many rave reviews...nonetheless - I attempted to make these as stand alone dumplings. The water boiled over and made a mess all over my stove and I was left with a mushy mass of yucky goop. Have to start over with a different recipe. I followed this one to the letter. No go!

I thought I would try something new--what a mistake--ended up going back with my old standby dumpling recipe. This one produced a totally mushy dumpling. Followed recipe to a tee---defintely two thumbs down.

The dumplings came out super-soft and almost gooey. I know that I followed the measurements exactly. I would suggest you add more flour to get a firm dumpling and maybe less baking powder so that they don't puff up too big. I had to fish these out of my soup so it wouldn't get ruined.

These are great dumplings, just like the kind my Mom used to make.  I use them when I have left over meat and gravy. Just throw some mixed vegetables (frozen) in with the meat and gravy, bring to a boil and plop the dumplings on top. I cooked them covered for about 5 minutes and then uncovered until done.  They are also great in soup.

These are absolutely fantastic: my go-to dumpling recipe.  I confess I have attitude about recipes that advise using canned biscuits for dumplings. These take no more time to make and the taste is so superior---I can't imagine why anyone would want those nasty, preservative-laden lumps in their stew!  But I digress:  these dumplings are the business and I never change a thing.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Growing up my mom was not the best cook. All our dumplings came out of a bisquick box. I found this recipe and made turkey and last. The best ever. They don't fall apart while they are steaming. I will definitely be making dumplings a lot more. Thank you for posting this recipe and thanks to your mom.

Made them quickly  to put on top of some thrown together chicken stew while we watched our big football game - loved them - so light and fluffy.  Used butter instead and doubled the recipe and they nicely filled the top of my dutch oven.  Saved this one and will use again!

These are so quick, easy, and great tasting! I had planned on using Bisquick, but at the last minute realized it had gone bad.  Allrecipes to the rescue!  Took just a minute to get them mixed up.  Will never use Bisquick dumplings again!

great basic dumpling recipe. I substituted the margarine for shorting, the milk for buttermilk and I used half all purpose and half semolina flours.I made chicken and dumplings in the slow cooker so I par cooked dumplings in chicken stock just enough to set, then added them to slow cooked 20 min before the chicken was cooked

Great recipe! I used 2 tbs of butter instead of margarine, hazelnut milk and a full teaspoon of salt. The puffed up beautifully, I thought I was making them small but they came out pretty big.

Delicious!

I followed the ingredients in the recipe to the letter (well, I might have used a bit more margarine because I generously guessed at 1 tbsp) and they turned out really well. I cooked them in the slow cooker, on high, placing blobs of dumpling mix on top of a simmering beef stew for approx 20-25 minutes. I figured that a slow cooker would take a bit longer to cook. The left-over dumplings that ended up cooking in the slow cooker for much longer (40+ minutes)and eaten the next day were even tastier! So although the dumplings are ready in 20 minutes, they can stay for longer in the slow cooker and still be yummy.

Excellent! Excellent! I mix it up from time to time. From adding some basil, rosemary, or marjoram! I have even tossed these in the crock pot, and let them cook about 45 min before serving! Beautiful little pillows!!  Thanks for sharing Carol!

Carol, thank you for sharing your Mom's Dumpling Recipe, that little bit of sugar counter balances the salt and does wonders. My mom always added a little bit of dry parsley to her mix it adds some color and a additional bit of flavor. Kate

I followed exactly and added the parsley as suggested.  These are the best dumplings that I've ever made.  Well worth it.

Perfect as written, I use this with my homemade chicken soup.  Kids love dumplings.  Be patient and dont lift that lid, it really makes all the difference and be sure to simmer not boil the dumplings.  Great recipe!

This was really easy and very good. My picky 90 year old dad even ate two! I followed the recipe exactly and dipped the spoon in the hot stew before and between dropping the dough in. Loved it!

Amazing!  So easy and quick.  There is absolutely no way to mess up this easy recipe.  Also I'm gluten-free and I used Pamela's GF Baking Flour and it worked perfectly!  I did notice that it was still a little watery after I mixed it together so I added a little white rice flour.  I also omitted the baking powder because it already comes in the mix.  It's a cold and rainy day here in Germany and I'm so happy to have this wonderful chicken and dumpling soup to warm me up!

I decided to try a new dumpling recipe tonight after making the "bisquick" ones for years....  Only one dumpling turned out fluffy... the rest all fell to the bottom and were solid balls... :( 
The dough was also very sticky & wet and didn't form balls very well... I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to the  mix.

Used buttermilk in place of the milk otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They came together beautifully.  The dumplings were moist and tasty in my chicken and dumplings.

I used this recipe and dropped them in the crockpot (high setting)for the last 20 min on top of my chicken/veggie/soup/mix. They turned out great. Just made sure I left the lid on. I will use this recipe again and maybe add a little more butter or use buttermilk instead of regular milk.

I usually just use Bisquick to make my dumplings but I was out of it and luckily I found this recipe.  They were very easy to make and the flavor was good but they fell apart in the stew that I put them on.  I may give them another try and see if I did something wrong on my first attempt.

I can't believe how easy this was. They came out absolutely perfect in my turkey soup and didn't have the bland taste that cooking with shortening normally has.

These are awesome!  I made them last week and went to find them again to make for my turkey and dumplings a second time because I loved the texture of these so much...it took me 15 minutes to find the recipe again because I didn't add to favorites.  So glad I found them again, thanks! ~Trish

These dumplings were great.  They tasted just like they did when my mom made chicken and dumplings. Might actually add a little spice to the dough to add a little flavor though.

I melted the butter and put it in the milk like someone else suggested. Also used splenda for the sugar. Dumplings made on top of the Angels Beef Stew. Delicious!

With it pouring outside and everyone sniffling in my house I decided to make chicken and dumplings only to realize I didn't have any Bisquick!  And I'm so glad I didn't...  I'll NEVER buy it again.  These were super easy and delish!

Light, Fluffy, Yummy home comfort goodness!  Added 3 TBS fresh parsley and 1 TBS fresh chives.  Increased to 9 servings and used about 3 TBS butter.  Cooked on top of Rachel Ray's Chicken and Dumplings recipe, using a left over rotisserie chicken for the meat and to make the broth the night before.

I always use this dumpling recipe. I don't change up the ingredients or the measurements. However, I do occasionally add spices, herbs, or cheese to it to change up the flavor. I like to have variety. If you are looking for a good  and simple dumpling, this is it.

I've never made dumplings before, but when I had an unexpected guest for dinner I needed to stretch out the chicken stew that I had cooking in the crock pot and found this recipe.

This recipe is SO easy to make and the dumplings turned out so fluffy and yummy!  Will definately use this recipe again and again!

this recipe was so simple and delicous! i have always had trouble with dumplings for some reason but these are so easy you couldn't mess em up. i put mine in some chicken soup i made and they came out perfect! you could probably with just a lil more flower use this recipe for quick and easy bisquits.

I made the parsley version of these dumplings to add to a meatball and sauerkraut soup recipe from this site. Light, delicious and super easy to whip together. They were a great bonus to the yummy soup.   Thanks Carol for posting this recipe.

My family really liked this recipe. I cooked em in a crock pot in a beef stew for alot longer than 15 minutes so they could get nice and dense. Otherwise they were pretty soft and fluffy. I might cut the baking powder in half next time.

and i though bisquick was the only easy way to make dumplings....boy was i wrong...these are easy and incredible...you cannot go wrong - i used butter instead of margarine, doubled the recipe, added a extra table spoon of butter - melted it before i incorporated and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk - fantastic....unbelievable - this site makes me a better cook everyday

One note....I have always made my favorite biscuit recipe for the dumplings...and I roll the dough out thinner than if I were going to cut out biscuits....and then cut strips out of the dough.  then I add the strips (any length you prefer but I do them no more than 2 inches long) and add to my boiling chicken broth "soup".......try not to stir them as this will make them tough....just turn the heat down and allow them to simmer or stew - gently running the spoon through them if you feel you need to.  they are much more uniform this way and so very tasty.  Hope you like my little idea.  Dumplings are a wonderful comfort food on a cool evening.

These are good, but I find I have to simmer for a lot longer than 15 minutes if I don't want the dumplings to be just gooey dough.  Still, this is the recipe I always use for dumplings, and my husband loves them.

I thought this dumpling recipe was perfect - - just the type of thing my mom and her sisters would make. I made "Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings" from this website, but used this dumpling recipe instead of canned biscuits. My family loved it! My slow cooker was on high and the dumplings were ready in exactly 15 minutes. Light, fluffy and yummy. Thanks so much for sharing! :-)

This is the most wonderful recipe for dumplings! Followed the directions exactly- let simmer an extra couple minutes with the lid on just to be sure. Better than the canned kind, and with the soup/broth mixture I used, it totally beat the chicken and gnocchi served at Olive Garden that I came to enjoy. Filling and tasty! I used the parsley flakes as suggested- superb! Never would have thought of that myself. Yum. Filled two dinner bowls perfectly. Thickened my soup as I'd heard it would from another reviewer, which I'm totally thankful for, especially since I didn't have any cream of chicken soup on hand like recipes using biscuits call for. The flavors went so well together. (Btw, I cheap-skated the soup for this: 1 can of chunky chicken noodle soup, picked out the spiral noodles, added 1 cup of chicken broth.) I'm calling my mother to tell her about this recipe right now! Thanks sooo much! I think this is my favorite food of all time now! :)

These were very good and super easy!  I used butter instead of margarine.  When I dropped the dough into my broth I didn't think I had enough b/c it only made 6 dumplings.  However, they cooked up to be 3x their original size and one per person was plenty!

These are just like grandma's. Very tender and have a wonderful flavor. I like to roll mine about a quarter of an inch thick and use a pizza cutter to cut into 1 inch squares.

Fantastic recipe.  I've been using a recipe for years from "Company's Coming - Muffins and More" but thought I'd expand my horizons and checked here, found this recipe and was excited to try it.  I thought I'd compare it to my old one first and to my surprise it's word for word identical :).  I took one viewers advice and doubled the margarine, and they were perfect.  I've never had so many compliments from my whole family even from a student we have visiting from Germany.  Thanks!

I've made Bisquick dumplings for years.  I was out of baking mix, s oI tried this "from scratch" version.  These were almost as easy and were much fluffier.  Even the kids noticed the difference.  The cooking time was shorter, as well.  This will be my new dumpling recipe.

I only gave this 2 stars because the taste was okay. We like our dumplings light and airy and these were far from it.  I made sure to follow the recipe exactly and they turned out so thick and heavy.  Definitely won't be making these again.

YAY!! I can make dumplings!  No more canned biscuit dough for me.  What a difference.  They were delicious.  Added dried parsley and a bit of cracked pepper and needed two tablespoons butter.  I was using the crock pot so I just added the spoonfuls of dough, covered it up and let it cook for about 45 minutes on high.  They came out light and fluffy.  This will be my go to recipe for dumplings from now on.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

I'm a poor college student who lives on soup because it's cheap. These dumplings are so good and so easy--now I have an actual meal! I scale the recipe down to 1.5 servings, and it always turns out.

These were really easy to make and held up really well in the chicken stew that I added them to.  I ommitted the sugar and was glad I did.  It just isn't necessary in my opinion.  Thanks they were great!

I made a double batch of these dumplings by doubling the ingredients and I also made large dumplings instead of a lot of small ones. I used care with the heat level to make sure they simmered and did not boil. It seemed that there was a tendency for the outer surface of the dumpling to seperate and settle back into the liquid. I was not pleased with the texture or the taste. The dough in the center of the large dumplings remained heavy and the taste was a little bitter I thought. Sorry, but I will not use this recope again.

Great!  The easiest and tastiest dumpling recipe I could find.  I can't cook, but this recipe is so easy that anyone can make it.  The only change I made was to make smaller dumplings.  Next time I will double the recipe.

This was far superior to the bisquick recipe I usually use.  I substituted greek seasoning salt for salt and added garlic powder for flavor.  Next time I will double the recipe since my family and friends wanted seconds and I ran out. Julie

Hi! Great recipe and easy. I used butter instead of margarine and also made it a bit ahead of time and left to keep cool in the fridge. 

Easy and delicious. Thank you.

Delicious dumplings.  Perfect for Chicken & Dumplings, Beef Stew,  Goulash or to serve as a side dish of country dumplings in chicken, ham or spicy, bacon gravy.  DO NOT BE TEMPTED to double this recipe and cram all the dumplings into the pot at once.  They need room to cook.  DO NOT BE TEMPTED to stir the dumplings while they are cooking, or they will break up.  For easy chicken and dumplings, poach chicken breasts in 2 cans cream of chicken soup with only a tiny bit of water -- just until cooked and then remove from the pot (so the meat does not get tough).  Add your sauteed carrots and celery and cook them in the soup until tender.  Then add the dumpling batter.  Once the dumplings are cooked, add the chicken (now diced) back to the pot and cook for 5 mins.  Dumplings will help thicken the sauce.  Serve, garnished with fresh parsley.

These dumplings were great! You know its good when its asked for again! Changes made the second go: I added parsley, onion powder and garlic powder (I don't measure, sorry). Also I didn't have any cow's milk and didn't want to try almond milk so I used buttermilk. Fantastic!!! My 14 yr old said she liked the buttermilk better....definitely a staple added to my arsenal! Thank you!

These are great. The trick though, is not to make them too big or they won't cook through. Drop by soup spoonfuls is about as large as you can go, and make sure the stew is bubbling hot. Green onions or chives is also a nice addition.

Made a double batch.  Instead of dropping by spoonfuls, I rolled dough into a log shape and sliced into 10 or so pieces, then cut each of those in half so they were all about the same size. Cooked as directed in turkey stew. Everyone here liked them. Will make again.

These are fantastic dumplings!!  Used them in chicken and dumpling soup.  I dropped them in the soup at a simmer, covered, and cooked for about 15 mins. keeping the soup at a gentle simmer.  This recipe does not make a lot.  I tripled the recipe and it fed 4 hungry people.  Next time I'll quadruple to have leftovers.  So good though and glad I found this recipe!!

This has been my go to dumpling recipe for at least a year now and I only just realized that I hadn't reviewed it!  I use only real butter and we use just a tad more sugar than called for because we like the sweet dumpling against the salty chicken stew.  perfectly light and fluffy every time!!

I was really disappointed with the results.  They were puffed up but doughy and almost raw, even with the 15 mins. of covered cooking.  Definitely will not recommend this recipe.

Was in a hurry, made these as-is and plopped them into my chicken soup for 20 mins. The dumplings came out perfectly: light, melt in your mouth texture and tasted like my soup, not just dough. I should've halved the recipe, as I made enough soup just for 2. What a happy accident!  The broth thickened into creamy goodness that was like a potpie in a bowl ;) Will definitely make these again!

I've made these a couple of times, I follow the directions exactly and they turned out great everytime. I grew up on bisquick dumplings and after making these I'll never eat the bisquick ones again. I did what another reviewer suggested and dipped my spoon in the hot liquid and then in the dumpling mixture, they drop right off the spoon.

I left out the salt because my stew had enough salt- otherwise fantastic dumplings! Do as the recipe says and don't lift that lid-  the tops of the dumplings need to "bake" (steam). This is my go to dumpling recipe. Mmmm...

These dumplings are PERFECT for on top of chicken stew ("chicken & dumpings") So many recipes for chicken & dumplings call for canned biscuit dough, and I just can't get behind that. These are so easy to make (takes 2 minutes!) and a wonderful alternative to heavily processed junk.

I've spent my life telling people about the unachievable dumplins that my grandma made.  They were like yummy clouds on your spoon.  This recipe is IT!  OMGoodness, these are the most awesomest dumplins EVER!   The only thing I change about this recipe is that I double it....cuz 1 ain't enough!

I have a great pie dough recipe. I  have several great cookie go-to recipes, and I can make delicious gravy. But I have never been completely happy with the many, many stew dumplings I've made. As a matter of fact I'd rather given up on stews. But the other day I had the house to myself, it was cold and rainy, and I had some chuck, potatoes and peas -- the fates had decreed a stew must be made. After hours of delicious smelling steam moistening the winter house, I looked up dumpling recipes online. I've found many very good recipes at allrecipes, and this one not only had great ratings but the reviews were by people who'd actually made the recipe, so I decided to try this one.

These dumplings were terrific. Toothsome and light at the same time, with good flavor. I  made six dumplings and had to cook them for 20 minutes. I look forward to making these again and adding different flavors, as suggested.

Thank you very much for this great recipe. Great stew dumplings!

I made these yesterday in my slow cooker for a chicken and dumplings recipe which called for a store biscuit mixture. These were easy and delicious!  I cooked them on high for 15 minutes and they turned out perfect!!  My husband and kids loved them!!

These were tasty but fell apart during cooking.  I will try them one more time before giving up on them--as they did get quite a few reviews.

Easy and very tasty. I tried making dumplings once before and didn't  care for the way they turned out but I think it was from a baking mix. I added the parsley and now I'm trying to figure out what other seasonings I can use and what else I can put them into. Thank you Carol for my new dumpling recipe.

I was raised to think that you had to have the prepared biscuit mix to make dumplings. So not true.  These were easy and hands down 100% better than those made with the mix.

I added parsley and some herbs de provence as I made them with chicken and they were delicious.  Great texture.  Gone forever is the premade mix!

Tried this recipe twice thinking I did something wrong the first time.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Dumplings came out dense and doughy.  Absolutely inedible, I don't recommend this one.

This recipe is easy and delicious. It's a very quick way to go from run-of-the-mill to home cooked happiness. Use these dumplings in soups and stews or with leftover meat or poultry with gravy and vegetables. I had thawed a turkey breast that was left from a roasted turkey. I added the gravy and frozen peas and carrots, warmed that while I mixed up these dumplings and in half an hour I had a delicious, filling and nutritious dinner on the table. I needed to add a little extra milk but flour varies from day to day so use your own judgement. You can't go wrong with these delicious little puffs.

I've used this recipe many times, but I've made a few adjustments. I add some Mccormick's Seasoned Herb Medley to the batter and I cook them in my gravy pot. I just make the gravy a bit thin and it thickens as the dumplings cook.

Made these tonight with a chicken and dumplings recipe.  Instead of using mixes, this was so much better, cheaper and tastier.  I did use a smidgen more milk than the recipe called for but I just added a little bit to get the consistency I wanted.

Had these tonight with a chicken soup.  The guests and husband said they were awesome!  I added the parsley to these.  Was talking that some parmesen cheese would be good to add, a very good starter recipe to make many variations.  Thank you.

Doubled the recipe and made these in homemade chicken broth. ... Ah-mazing! Totally yummy and satisfying to my dumpling craving. I love how simple and easy they were to make (I did add a little more flour to make them not so sticky to form balls by hand). This was my first time making dumplings EVER!

This is a very soft, disintegrate in your mouth dumpling.  I actually like a toothier dumpling with a little chew to it.  That said, these firmed up quite a bit after refridgeration and I enjoyed them much more on day 2.

These dumplings turned my poor college student chicken soup (made using chicken broth made from chicken bouillon as the base and cut up carrots, celery, and cubes of turkey bought from the college salad bar) into something extra special.... These dumplings ad great flavor and texture and really brought my soup to the next level... I will definitely use this recipe again thanks!!

I double this recipe for my family...my wife and kids love it!  It is impossible to have enough dumplings, though...my family would vote for less chicken if that means more dumplings :-).  Also, this is about as easy as it gets!

I wanted to make Chicken and Dumplings using some leftover rotissere chicken we had. I used this recipe for the dumplings (because it sounded so easy) and my picky hubby declared it "a home run"! He went back for thirds. SO simple, easy and tasty, this will be a staple at our household. Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! These were so simple to make and my family absolutely loved them, even the littlest critics.

I added some parsley from the garden and a teaspoon more of the margarine because the flour wasn't "crumbling." DEFINITELY will make this again!!

These were excellent.  I made them bite-sized, so they accompanied my soup rather than dominated it. Looking forward to making/enjoying them again tonight.

Excellent! Very tasty. I, too, added Parsley as another reviewer suggested. My hubby is diabetic so I used Spenda. I don't believe it made any difference in the taste from 'regular' sugar.

Ohhhhh yummmm.  These were so good!  My husband requested "fluffy" dumplings to go with our favorite Chicken & Dumplings recipe from this site.  So much better than the heavy, dense dumplings from that recipe (made from canned biscuits!!)  These  were light and tender and will be our "go-to" recipe!  Can't wait to make them again!

Amazing! super simple and didn't require any eggs. Worked perfectly with what I had available. I did have to water down my milk - ran out- and I converted Crisco shortening- but didn't seem to cause any problem.

I really liked these dumplings.  I was worried that they would fall apart but in 15 minutes they were just right.  Maybe some spices can be added if you like some flare.  I was wondering if the baking powder would be evident but I could not taste it in the final dumplings

Thank you Carol! That's also my way of cooking! We still don't eat anything from packages, but I do cook in my micro. My kids would never eat processed food - besides - it's not good for them anyway. I love dumplings from scratch - thanks for the great recipe! Greetings from Germany!

This is just like my mothers recipe for dumplings the only difference is she added an egg and no salt was added, also only one tsp of baking powder. My childern love these. Especially with pea soup.

Really good and sooo easy! I usually make matzo balls but they take 45 minutes to make so this is so much easier and really add heartiness to chicken broth. Thanks Carol!

I usually make my chicken and dumplings stew with Jiffy Mix dumplings. I didn't have any Jiffy Mix so I figured I'd give this one a try. These were amazingly good. They mixed up really well in my Kitchen Aid mixer. One suggestion, make sure the bitter you use is cold, like right out of the fridge instead of softened. These dumplings are light in flavor and puffed up perfectly. I did not have any problem with them crumbling apart or being terribly gummy like some reviews suggest. They were perfect!

after you fix the amount of  butter  used to 3 tablespoons if flour is sifted, or 4 tablespoons if the flour is just scooped to a level cup of flour. Use butter it works better to get the fine grain when cutting in.

So easy. And it's all ingredients I have already. I usually just drop in packaged biscuit dough for my dumplings but it was a raining so I just decided to try it on my own. I did double the butter like one of the other reviews suggested but that's the only change I made.

Excellent! I have a large crew with teenage boys and a husband who eats like a teenager so I double the recipe.  I also like to roll mine out, but that's just my personal preference.  I like that these are thick and not noodle thin.

My parents always made dumplings with Bisquick - this is SO much better!  And ridiculously easy to make.

not very good dumplings.  Easy to make and dosn't take much time to cook but but the taste was just not very good.  Not worth the time.  Will continue my search for a good dumplings recipe.  Thanks for posting anyway.

These were easy and great.  Definitely put them in when the liquid is bubbling or they get soggy bottoms.  I'm rating these as only a four because the dumplings have no flavour of their own, only the part that was in the cooking liquid had flavour.

This was my first time making dumplings and this recipe made it so easy! I used butter instead of margarine and included some fresh parsley as was recommended. Delish! I threw the dumplings into a pot of boiling chicken paprikash and they came out great! Decided trying home-made dumplings would be better than boiling store-bought noodles.

Super easy, super fast.  I even added them to instant chicken noodle soup for a fast dish.  Not an empty bowl in the house.

I have never had dumplings before but thought I'd add some as a special treat in my vegetable soup. I thought they were ok, but DH kept raving and raving about how delicious they are and that they are the best dumplings he's ever tasted (he grew up on dumplings).

This was a great simple recipe. The only thing I did differently was substitute the margarine with butter. Other than that, I followed everything to a "t" and they came out perfect! :-)

fantastic! The sugar added just a hint of sweet that really worked with the soup! I doubled it, but i shouldnt have. The amount made here would have been perfect. Loved it, thank you. Ill be making these more often. :)

These are GREAT! I followed the suggestion of the first comment and added 2 tbsp of butter instead of 1 tbsp of margarine. My family likes the broth to be thick and creamy so I made one batch and cook down for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile I mix up another batch to have whole. They thickened up the chicken and dumplings perfectly! I HATE using the biscuit dough and constantly look for great dumpling recipes. I finally found it!! Easy, not over seasoned, light.. perfect! I will use this every time!!

Made these for chicken and dumplings in the slow cooker.  For those that can't tolerate dairy, it worked with soy milk instead of regular milk.  You can't tell the difference.

I have been afraid to make dumplings since I got married 31 years ago.  When my mom made them they were always doughy inside.  These were perfect.  After reading the reviews I added a little more butter (1/2 tsp more) and a pinch each of oregano, basil and rosemary.  I didn’t have any parsley.  I dropped them onto a meatless stew of broth, carrots, celery, onion, bay leaf and rice.  I made six from the recipe as suggested so they were pretty big.  They were perfectly cooked inside and out.  My husband loved the dumpling stew, we couldn’t stop eating it. I will definitely make this again.

This was a simple but terrific recipe. I used butter instead of margarine but other than that, no modifications, and I liked that this was made with common things that are easy to find in the pantry/fridge. The dough does puff up a bit as it cooks so keeping the spoonfuls on the small side is fine.   I added them to a soup I had been simmering in our slow cooker - just a homemade stock with chicken, carrots, celery, and onions thrown in (along with seasoning - kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, thyme, parsley, and a little minced garlic). This was the perfect way to finish it off and it went over well!

Won't lie I use to like bisquick dumplings, but now I've seen the light. I had every thing on hand and they came out so light and fluffy. I doubled a batch for a family of five and we only had one dumpling left over.  They also left my 8yr old daughter singing there praises.

Thank you! I'd only ever made Bisquik dumplings for my soup before, and I'm so glad I found a recipe that has liberated me, haha. Recently I made this as a topping for individual chicken-pot-pies (was feeling too lazy to make a proper crust), and it turned out wonderfully!

Great recipe!! My husband likes fluffy, not chewy, dumplings & he is VERY picky. He LOVED these & so do I!! Fluffy & flavorful, not heavy & doughy tasting. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the sugar.

These dumplings are super easy and taste really good. I have a pan of soup and dumplings on the stove right now, can't wait to chow down. They did thicken the soup I made yesterday, but that was good.

This is a great budget stretcher!  The dumplings taste great, are very very easy to make and all from stuff that you already have in your kitchen. I love that you can use the ol' "that looks about right" for the measurements and they still turn out great.

Awsome!!! I have recently lost my grandmothers recipe for dough boys, and this one is as close as I can remember, they came out like biscuits! Almost as good as hers, but really who come close to granny's cooking right? Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe.

This is the recipe that made me join this site!  These are incredibly easy to make.  I make them with butter and add some Italian Seasoning when I make them for Chicken and Dumplings.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

the only change i made was using melted butter instead of cutting the butter into the mix. these came out a little bland. i'm going to play around with some spices next time, a good base recipe though.

The dumplings were good, I used Splenda in place of the sugar & it made the entire soup sweet...next time I will totally omit sugar/sweetner.

This is delicious!  I'm not even much of a soup person either!  I baked chicken thighs in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours covered with 2 cups of water in the pot.  Then, I put the pot in the fridge.  Once the fat settled on the top I skimmed it off and used the rest as stock with a couple of the pieces of chicken deboned and a large carrot.  Then, I made the dumplings right in the homeade soup.  It was like being home again, but even better!  I will omit the salt in the dumplings next time as it was to salty for me.  I like just enough salt to bring out the flavor, but not so much to where I can taste it.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will make it regularly!

These were delicious!  I used these in my chicken and dumplings, and they were just as tasty as my drop dumpling recipe, but with 1/2 the fat!!  My family prefers the flat(slick) dumplings, but when I'm in a rush I make these.  I tripled this recipe to make my normal family sized batch. Only change I made was using butter instead of margarine. (My recipe is 3c flour, 4tsp baking powder, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1 1/2c milk, and 6 TBS butter. no sugar)  These were light and fluffy and we didn't miss the extra fat!  Thanks for the recipe Carol!  It's a keeper :)

delicious!!  I had never had dumplings before but they never looked very appetizing.  I tried these and they were very fluffy, not what i imagined dumplings being.  We agreed that they were a little bland.  I think i will definately keep this recipe and add seasoning to it.  Will make again!!  Also i made the bath and put some in and they fluffed up right away.  I left the leftovers sitting on the counter for about an hour and then boiled the second bath and they didn't puff up at all.

My mother never made dumplings with her chicken soup -- she said they were too much work.  I was really surprised because this is sooo easy!  I doubled the recipe and even added some poultry seasoning to the dough... They turned out nice and light...  My husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven!

Fluffy, soft, biscuit-like dumplings.  (I don't like the doughy, slimy kind, so these were great!)  Cover and boil the full time and they are perfect, even in a thick stew.

Not sure I know what to expect from dumplings, but these weren't bad.  Tried them with whole wheat flour, chives, parsley, and the smallest amount of ginger I could manage-- in the Slow Cooker Chicken & Dumplings recipe.  Filling.

Hubby requested them to go in the beef stew and they turned out great...light and fluffy.  Hubby was happy and I thought they were better than mom's.  Only change I made was to add a touch more butter.

My husband and I both think this recipe is fabulous. I made a few changes: for the liquid I used buttermilk and cream (three parts buttermilk - one part cream), I used butter instead of margarine, and to the dry ingredients I added not only the parsley but also black pepper. This will be my standard dumpling recipe now.

These were really easy to ake and turned out well. (Just don't forget anything -- I forgot the butter once and it turned out very odd, indeed!) Great dumplings.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I found the dumplings to be much too soft and mushy.  I also found that they retained too much of a "floury" texture inside.

These dumplings were too moist for my taste.  They fell apart completely in the chicken and dumplings.  I prefer something that can better hold shape.

I found these to be a bit on the bland side.  The dumplings "firmed up" upon second reheating.  They just seem to be missing something essential.

Excellent! My first stab at dumplings and they were perfect. I don't keep margarine in the house, and butter worked just fine. I also added finely minced sauteed mushrooms and cilantro, which added flavor. If you spray a bit of no-stick coating on the spoon when you drop them in the pot, they'll retain a nice shape.  They were fluffy, light, pasty, blobs of homey tasty goodness!

A great basic dumpling recipe.  My father was an excellent gourmet cook and made an all-star meal of roast pork, Bavarian sauerkraut, and dumplings.  These dumplings were basic compared to his - but for ease of preparation and taste, this is a very good recipe.

If you are cooking for a group of big eaters, better double, triple, or quad the recipe.  I quadrupled the recipe and it worked well.  However, keep in mind that if you do this, you will need a much larger pot to cook in or more cooking time.

Awesome dumplings!  I used to have a great dumpling recipe, but when I moved, I lost it, and now that I've found this recipe, this is better than my old one!  It makes wonderful dumplings, they taste wonderful in chicken & dumplings!  :)
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was a very good recipe. I love Chicken and Dumplings and the dumplings weren't too mushy, but soft enough. Very very good. This will definetly be my "Dumpling Recipe" Just have to find the Chicken part!
Thank you

At first I wasn't really sure how this wa going to turn out.I like dumplings that aren't slimmy and are cooked all the way threw and these met every bit of what I pefer in dumplings. My son didn't like my home made chicken noodle soup until the night after when I added the dumplings. GREAT RECIPE !  K.H.T. in Texas

These dumplings were good, but pretty much just like any other recipe I've made.  They did get much larger after simmering than other recipes I've tried.  Don't double the recipe unless you have a HUGE stockpot.  I will make again, but only because I have no reason not to!

Excellant recipe! The dumplings came out so light and fluffy and flavorful. I was searching for a dumpling recipe made from scratch instead of a mix and was so happy to find this one. I prefer to use butter instead of margarine and they came out great. Thanks for sharing this one.

These are the crowning touch to a wonderful simmering pot of deliciousness. Secret is to NOT lift that lid to peek while they cook. Sometimes I take a large pinch of dried rosemary, crush in my palm & add to the mixture before dropping into a simmering pot of chicken noodles/stew. Just as good reheated the next day.

The only thing I substituted was the margarine for butter. It came out delicious! 
I read from other reviews it was not flavorful enough, well its dumplings! They are like a biscuit are they not supposed to be that way?
I have only had Bisquick dumplings in the past and these are similar, but better. Put them in my beef stew, husband and son loved them!

This is pretty much the same recipe I’ve used for years! Instead of milk I’ve always used the chicken stock from my homemade chicken noodle soup. It gives the dumplings much more flavor!

Delicious! I used these dumplings in the Chicken and Dumplings recipe on this site. I made additions after reading reviews that I thought would suit my tastes. I only made one batch thinking my picky children wouldn't eat them. I was wrong, they ate all the dumplings. I will never buy store bought again!

Yay! Finally, dumplings like my mom used to make. She never taught me and has been gone about 15 years now, but I think she'd be proud.
I did use parsley flakes, but had less than I thought, so added some dried chives too. 
Just terrific, everyone loved them!
Thanks so much!

Made these to go with my Turkey soup I made in the instant pot after Thanksgiving. The only changes I made was to Use Brodie’s self -rising flour , added a extra teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and a bunch of chopped fresh parsley. Mixed the milk it called for and let it sit for 10 min as the instant pot came to simmer on sauté. Dropped by teaspoon into simmering liquid, dipped my teaspoon into hot broth in between dropping the dumplings. Put my clear glass lid on my instant pot and let it simmer 15 min. They where perfect, soft and flavourful. I loved them!!!

If I could give these a million stars I would. I have been looking for a from scratch dumpling recipe like this for years and could never quite get them right but these are perfect, light, fluffy and buttery but not spongy or too soft. The only change I made was I doubled the butter and melted it and mixed it into the cold milk which causes the butter to harden in small bits, then mixed wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until combined. It made six nice sized dumplings and were perfectly cooked after 15 minutes simmering covered. Thank you for this recipe it has made me so happy!

I was looking for a quick dumpling idea one day after work since I was making a rather sub par super basic after work chicken stew. My dinner I was not to excited about serving turned into a big hit when I added these dumplings. They are PERFECT, leaves that soft dumpling exterior while being cooked exactly the way you hope for inside. Not doughy or undercooked, but a perfect dumpling. I’ve made this recipe about 5 times and I always say “  this really is good”.

I followed the recipe and added to the food processor. In addition, I added about a tablespoon of fresh parsley substituted buttermilk for regular milk and added about a teaspoon of granulated garlic. These dumplings turned out fantastic, thanks

Made as directed other than adding a little poultry seasoning. Dumplings came out a bit dry but good flavour. Next time I'd add more butter. Hopefully that will help.

I added garlic/onion powder, pepper and parsley to my dumplings. Huge hit with the family. Just make sure they are the last thing you put into the pot to cook, they disappear quite a bit.

quick, easy, delicious! very dependable recipe and easy to memorize. have used it many times to add to a soup or stew. sometimes i even make a quick "kitchen sink" soup just for the sole purpose of enjoying these dumplings, especially when i'm craving something warm and comforting.

This is my go to dumpling recipe. The only thing I change is butter instead of margarine and sometimes I throw in some dried parsley. These dumplings are light, fluffy and delicious!

Made beef stew in my new OnePot and not sure about how to include dumplings.    Next day decided to try dumplings for the leftovers and found this recipe.  Heated stew to simmering on stove top, substituted 1 tablespoon of oil.   Covered and cooked 15 minutes. Turned out perfect, lght and fluffy.  Will definitely make again. One of my all time favourite comfort meals. Thanks for sharing.

Definitely turned out way better than I expected.  Normally I avoid them because of the past recipes that I have used never seemed to turn out.  This was perfect!

Didn't have regular salt so I used a tad bit less than what recipe called for with kosher salt.  
These dumplings were just amazing!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Best dumplings ever!  I have made this several times exactly as written, and these dumplings are always fluffy pillows of perfection. Light in texture and never doughy, which is just horrible and why many people go with the canned biscuit approach.  I have never been completely satisfied with any of the many dumpling recipes I have tried over the years,.  Although some have been very good, none of them were great...until this one.  Thanks for sharing this family treasure.

Wow! Fantastic! So easy to make; this recipe is "on the list" as a keeper as my husband says. Making dumplings is not daunting like I expected and I'm looking forward to making them again. I used 1 and 2/3 tablespoons of margarine and had a tablespoon of milk left over. I used this recipe to make chicken and dumplings. (Cream of mushroom soup, chicken broth, 2/3 can non-salted veggies, 1 chicken breast cut up and cooked in the stew).

I doubled the recipe and added a tbl spoon of dried Italian seasoning. I used almond milk and butter flavored Crisco do to a milk protein allergy. I put them in my chicken and dumplings. They were delicious!! My husband and my 11 month old loved them!!

I love this recipe for dumplings.  I 4x the recipe for a Dutch oven of chicken, carrots,  onions, celery and chicken stock because we like lots of dumplings. Other than that made the recipe exactly as is.

followed the recipe..but, way to stiff!  added a little more milk; just enough to made them able to be pushed off a spoon.
They immediately began to dissolve.  After the 1st 3, I tried to roll them very lightly into a soft ball.  
THE RESULT, the first few had totally disintegrated, the remainder were about 30-40% 'whole' !!!
....maybe there are tricks that weren't explained?? (& I'm a rather good (from scratch) cook ....???)

Great recipe,  doubled it and it made about 12 nice sized dumplings. I would like to add some garlic to the recipe next time I make them.

Awesome dumplings!  My hubby, the man that vowed to never eat dumplings is a now a dumpling lover!  Thanks to this recipe he ate 5 of the 6 dumplings I made to go with pea soup.
I followed the recipe exactly as stated.   Previous reviews state they made changes to the recipe, I felt it would change the flavor of whatever they were put into.  We're using this recipe to go with chicken and dumplings next week.   By the way its per hubby's request. ?

Added a few additional herbs for a really savoury dumpling, works well even without baking powder - light and fluffy and delicious!  Also suitable for a slow cooker with increased cooking times.

Was the best part of the stew!

I made a 1.5 batch of these, always doubling the butter (Grass-fed Kerry Gold Butter).  They are always SO good.  I'm no chef but I can make these perfectly every time.  My son was even impressed and nothing impresses him.  I have printed off this recipe to add to my recipe book.  I've not found a more foolproof dumpling.

I added sage and thyme.....worst recipe. It ruined  our  entire dinner. We had Turkey stock going all day. I should have gone with the family dumpling recipe but was looking for something less dense. My mistake.

I've made this recipe several times now adding the parsley and doubling the recipe. I also roll these out and then cut into approximately one-inch squares before adding to make simmering stock. My family and I are so happy that we found this recipe. :-)

Fantastic!! I made turkey stew in the Instant Pot (in all of 15 minutes), then removed the lid and added the dumplings, using the sauté feature to simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Dinner was on the table in under an hour and everyone raved about how delicious it was. Its now a regular in our family rotation. Love these dumplings!!

Turns out great easy recipe to follow. I have been looking for a great dumpling recipe for awhile that didn’t include refrigerated biscuits. Definitely keeping the lid on for cooking makes a huge difference otherwise they dissolve mostly into the broth. This time I also tried rolling into balls and coating in flour it seems to have helped also.

The dumplings turned out nice.  I made them for a beef stew. I found that the longer you let them sit in the pot the better they were.  Very good with all the beef gravy.   I think next time I might add a few herbs in it to make it even better.  Like Rosemary.

This dumpling recipe was perfect!  I doubled it and added 1/8 tsp of garlic.  Some folks might want to compensate for the thickening of the liquid in soups/stews/broths due to the addition of the dumplings.  Putting some liquid aside before adding the dumplings, (and then adding it after the dumplings were done) made my soup just right.

I love home cooking and it really is aggravating when you pull up a recipe that calls for can dough so I am thankful for this recipe. Thanks! I have made this recipe three times now and for the basic it is fine but my family likes more flavor  so on try number two I added the parsley flakes, cracked black pepper and some Italian seasoning and it was better. The third time I made them I was a bit ticked because I have my mother-in-law and my husbands brother living with the four of us . I doubled the recipe and my mother-in-law dished out hers and my husbands brothers and took all the dumplings. The brother don't do hot spicy things so added chilly flakes to a the next batch and we loved them. Thank you for sharing this recipe

Good flavor, but just a bit too soft for my taste.  Some of the dumplings fell apart in the broth.

These would be much better if made with matzo flour.  With egg, there would be more flavor as well.

Super delicious and tasty. I did add a couple more spoonfuls of milk to the batter because I found it to be too thick and the results were perfect. I also used a small spoon to scoop them out to yield about 15 dumplings. Light, airy and delicious!

I didn’t have luck with this one. Maybe the soup got too hot, but my dumplings fell apart, were not firm at all. Not my favorite

I made it exactly as the recipe states, and it was absolutely delicious. I cooked them on top of a beef and cabbage stew. I made way to much for one person, but if you were feeding a lot of people the dumplings really tend to extend the meal. Thank you for this great recipe!

These dumplings puffed up prettily even though I put too many and crowded the pot. I followed the recipe exactly. I found them a tad bland so I'll add some seasonings next time. My kid went back into the pot for more.

I only had coconut almond milk on hand to use but even so, I was still skeptical about this recipe. I'm not sure why, maybe because there was no egg in the recipe BUT I have to say I was very happy with the results. Specifically, the texture was EXACTLY what I was looking for!

Made these today exactly per recipe. They were soooo good. Very easy and just really good. I almost added an herb butter i made previously but went with the original recipe first. Will try this next time.  Also, as others did, I made smaller, 2 bite-sized dumplings.

Worked beautifully!! I followed the recipe exactly and used roughly teaspoon sized balls of dough. They turned my beautiful chicken soup into an equally beautiful (and delicious) chicken and dumplings. Even better still, the dumplings (at that size) were slightly light and fluffy in the center and slightly doughy outside, lending the perfect consistency right between a fluffy dumpling and a dense one. Super easy and quick too. Will make again!!

I loved these. I flattened and cut them into strips to make traditional (for me) dumplings, they held their shape and were still chewy and perfect. I doubled the salt and butter.

I made small teaspoon sized dumpling from this recipe. Some dissolved into the soup and added a rich unctuousness to the dish. Next time I will par cook them to keep so many from dissolving, but the flavor was fantastic!

Wow!! I had never made dumplings before, so I was a little nervous. However, this recipe was so simple and gave me delicious, fluffy dumplings.
Since I figured it would match the stew, I added a little basil and garlic salt. Delicious!

Came out way too soft.  Ended up having to scoop the loose bits out.  Good base to start with though, and after a few changes they turned out perfect.

*edit* 

If they're coming out "gooey", it's most likely too much liquid in the beginning.  If it looks like a dry cookie dough before you put them in the soup, it cooks just right.  If its closer to batter, it will turn out very sad.  Also, make sure it's set to simmer and not a boil.  That helped too.

I made these with a gluten-free flour blend and dairy-free milk. I used half the amount of liquid + a few tbsps to consistency. They were FANTASTIC! I made another batch just so we could finish off the pot of chicken and dumplings I’d made. My son said, “Mother, you should make these more often.”

I followed the recipe as shown, but I also added some fresh Oregano, Thyme & Sage that I had in my fridge. Used butter instead of margarine. This was my first attempt at making dumplings & they turned out delicious. Glad I used the fresh herbs, make a big difference in flavor. I'm hooked now on dumplings. Next batch I plan on using gluten-free flour using the same recipe.

The dumplings were very good. I had been using store bought biscuit mix not as good or as healthy. This recipe was easy to make and really absorbed the flavor of the chicken and broth.
Highly recommended. Very simple to make.

Made the recipe as is but doubled it.  Now I know why there is no reason to double it.  The dumplings will suck up all the soup.  These were amazing and I will use this recipe all the time.  Thank you for the recipe.

Just a perfect recipe for airy, light dumplings that truly compliment the chicken, vegetables and broth!  I always make a new recipe exactly as written, and other than doubling it, it was perfect as written.  We finished our meal pleasantly full instead of uncomfortably stuffed by doughy dumplings.  A real winner!

Next time I make these I am reducing the sugar. I made a double batch and there still wasn't enough dumplings for the pot. Lesson learned. I always add some seasoning to my dumplings, mostly parsley flakes and some garlic powder. It adds a little extra yum to them!

This recipe was both easy, and easily modified. I added crushed celery leaves and smoked paprika to the dry ingredients, plus a bit more flour while I was forming the dough, to make the dough consistency one I could roll. I prefer a more square “noodle-like” dumpling to the “dropped biscuit” type as shown in the photo. So, my review gets 4 stars on that aspect because they rolled and held together perfectly.

Oh, and they were delicious, too! Soup was a hit last night!

Grew up on chicken and dumplings made with bisquick, but I wanted something homemade. This recipe is delicious! I doubled the recipe and added granulated chicken broth to the mixture in place of the sugar and  thyme to the simmering  chicken.

I made this using gluten free flour. The only other change was the addition of one egg white to replace the lack of wheat protein. They were tasty but a bit on the dense side which maybe the fault of the gluten free ingredients. They are worth making again to try to tweak this recipe

I'm not a fan.  Too biscuit-like and not much flavor.  I enjoy the heavier dumplings from Cracker Barrel, but can't find an easy recipe.  I am not a chef, by no means...but I am a pretty decent cook.  If you like biscuit-style dumplings, this recipe is right for you.

I have a dairy allergy so I substituted Almond Milk and Margarine, doubled it and everything came out fabulous. 

If it comes out gooey, perhaps you should leave it on about 5 minutes more.

Made it just like it said and rolled little balls and dropped in. Used a very small bowl of vegetable oil  and dipped my fingers and rubbed my hands about every third ball worked very well and fast. And left them in crock pot for 20 minutes.  They were excellent!

I made this just as the recipe stated. These are exactly like mom used to make. I used them in a beef stew and they were  light and tasty... I might use garlic salt next time if I want a different flavor.

I used buttermilk, dehydrated thyme and parsley and formed small tasty balls using my own blend of organic olive oil infused with rosemary and thyme to prevent the balls from sticking to my hands and fingers.

MY BALLS CAME OUT SIMPLY SUBLIME!

I have never been able to make good dumplings and these came out great. I used butter instead of margarine and a little more than was called for. Will definitely keep this recipe.

I wished I used a bigger pot! I usually used pre-made gnocchi for my dumplings because of my busy schedule. I didn't have any on hand and really didn't want to go to the store. I was searching for a light and fluffy dumpling I could easily make with what I had on hand. I will never use anything else but this recipe! They were perfect! I was hesitant on the sugar, but tried it anyway. I also used butter and doubled it as many suggested. Soooo good! Exactly what I was looking for. Because my pot was too small and I overloaded it with dumplings, I left it on for an additional 10 minutes. I'm a dumpling freak, so I made a double batch. I cannot thank you enough for sharing this recipe! It's the dumpling I've always searched for. Thank you!!!!

Wonderful dumplings!  I tried them yesterday for a pork stew & I'm making chicken and dumplings tonight!  My husband loves dumplings and I love that I found a good recipe, not bisquick!  Thank you for sharing your mother's recipe. It's a yummy one!

I have tried several dumpling recipes and this is now my go to recipe!  I eat kosher, so we cannot combine meat and dairy. I don’t use margarine. So I substituted chicken fat for the margarine and chicken stock for the milk. It was amazing!?

Loved this recipe the dumplings came out perfect.  I've been looking for the perfect dumpling recipe for my grandmother's blueberry dumplings and this is it!!!  We all knew how to boil down the blueberries but never got the dumpling just right.  My family all agreed it tastes exactly like how she used to make it, it brought back so many memories!!! Thank you so much!!!

Thumbs down from the kids.  I followed the food processor short cut and made tinier chunks in the soup on the side and it was a soppy mess.  Adding onion powder and the garlic powder along with the parsley made the flavor good with the chicken soup, but the consistency killed it ... and not in a good way

I followed the recipe except for adding more flour as the dough was very  thin, almost runny.  They turned out hard, dense and doughy in the middle - and the outside wasn't much better.  We tried eating the edges but gave up and tossed it.  Although I cook quite a bit from scratch I've never made great dumplings, but truly even the lowly bisquik dumplings were better than these.

I made the dumplings by themselves instead of with a stew of some sort, and instead I simmered them in chicken broth. It was really good, but a  little salty because of the chicken broth! My fault, so still five stars!

Excellent!  So simple and very easy to prepare.  I've always used Bisquick in the past, but not any more!  Thank you for sharing.  I melted the butter and doubled the recipe as a few others suggested.

Prepared with gluten free flour as my mom has celiac disease.  Other than that, stayed true to the recipe.  Have made this 3 times now and it was loved by hubby and mom (and me!)  This will become a staple.

These were good but I think I made mine too big and didn't cook them long enough. I'll make them again, but cook longer. I also didn't have a food processor or pastry knife (out of town at the moment working in a non cooks kitchen).

These are the loveliest dumplings I've ever made.  They're so tender and fluffy!

I used this exact recipe, but I added a few herbs and spices to the dough - garlic, sage, oregano.  I also flattened the dough with my hands and cut into little noodle shapes.   This made them perfectly sized for little mouths, and I prefer them this way myself.

This was good as is using oat flour, but real buttermilk (not  soured milk; store-bought proper buttermilk) is a huge improvement.

Perfect! Did not change a thing. The key to dumplings of old fashion perfection is not to over mix, always drop into a gentle boiling broth base and cover the pot and don't peek. Faith is a wonderful thing!

I took other member's recommendations.  Doubled the recipe, used butter and increased to 3 tablespoons (versus 2), melted the butter and warmed the milked and combined the two, then poured into flour mixture.  Loved the  hint of dipping the spoon into the  stew in between scooping - super easy!

Excellent recipe!! I made this as written and there really are no changes needed. The batter is a bit wetter than the recipe that I usually use but I used two spoons to drop the batter into the stew. A tip for those who found them mushy, drop the batter onto a potato that isn't emerged in the liquid. Thanks for sharing, I'll make these again.

Who knew dumplings were so easy yet delicious.  They are fun to watch as they puff up when you drop them in the soup.  Tried another recipe for dumplings with more seasonings but this is the go-to recipe for me!

Light.  Easy to make, no rolling out dough.  I added a little packaged Creamy Garlic Alfredo for a little extra taste (didn't have any herbs available).  Quite good.

I was making my dumplings using canned biscuits thinking that was the quickest way. I happened to be craving chicken and dumplings and was all out of canned biscuits. On a whim, I made this recipe. It was super easy and the dumplings cooked faster and were super tasty! I'll never use canned biscuits again!

Great recipe - definitely form into balls and place on top of broth, leave room under lid for them to expand as they cook.  Nice and soft texture but they get a little soggy as leftovers (if there are any.)

Couldn't believe I pulled off chicken 'n dumplings! 

This recipe was great! I did add parsley and rosemary to the dry mix for flavor.  

My dough was soft but it was dry (so I dunno how someone would spoon the dough into the stew/soup). I rolled the dough into small balls and plopped them in the soup mixture. I let it simmer for 20 minutes.  I was so anxious about it too, but once I took the top off and saw those big, fluffy, dumplings,  I was really pleased! They were well formed... dry and soft... almost like biscuits. I was really impressed. Definitely will be a staple in my home.

I made these with Pillsbury Gluten Free flour mix. I added an additional 1/4 cup of milk because the gluten free dough was very dry and crumbly before the additional milk. I had to cook about ten more minutes, but they turned out perfect!  This is a new favorite in our house!

These turn out every single time! I used to be a boxed biscuit mix girl... but these are almost as easy and so much better!
If you like your dumplings formed, roll the dough gently in wet hands to make them into balls then drop them in the soup/stew.

super simple and perfect ratios. i hand mix both stages and roll into balls and they came out so right.  
boyfriend challenged me to make my own chicken soup and dumplings and i used this recipe to wow him. i'm using this as a base to have fun with additives like green onions and miso so that they might compare to his mama's.

Loved it! Grew up with Bisquick chicken and dumplings and would rather not pass on that tradition. Getting away from processed and boxed foods. Used them in my homemade chicken stock that simmered all day. Used the fryer chicken carcass (raw, I deboned it fresh) from a meal the night before. I added celery tops, ruff cut carrots, and onion, salt, pepper, and a bay leaf or two. Simmer 4 hrs with lid on. STRAIN. Slow baked 2 large bnls breast, added them shredded to the broth along with fresh chopped carrots,celery and onion. My family loves dumpings! Doubling this was a no brainier. WHY DIDN'T I TRIPLE?????? I strongly suggest as I will be doing this next time I make. Light, fluffy and filling. The added parsley is a nice touch. This is the perfect Sunday dinner to have your house smell amazing the whole day. I will be handing this down to my daughters.

This is the second time I've made these to top turkey rice & noodle soup.  First time I made it,  I used leftover homemade Thanksgiving stuffing and incorporated it into the recipe replacing some of the flour.  Second time I made these, I added food processor ground boxed stuffing mix to the recipe, along with some parsley, & made the dumplings smaller,  bite sized.  Cooked them 15 minutes on simmer/ covered. They are to LIVE FOR!

Came out perfect in the crock pot! I added garlic powder and a tsp of yeast. The got really big and fluffy, we loved em. I like to leave the soup on warm in the crock pot and we eat as we go, but I learned if you leave the dumplings in too long they become mush with the soup.

Delicious. Haven't made dumplings for years and I wanted to put them in the slow cooker. Did just that but cooking time was longer than 20 minutes. Turned out to be about an hour and they were light and fluffy and yummy. Definitely a keeper!

Clear, concise easy recipe that the whole family enjoyed.
Went phenomenally well with this chicken noodle soup recipe.
I made the noodles on the side and cooked the dumplings in the chicken soup.

These were great, just what I was looking for.  I did add the parsley and some cheddar shred cheese to it. Made in slow cooker with beef stew did about 12 min with lid on and about 15 without lid. So good will definitely make this again. Only thing get a little soggy for a left over dish. Keeper for sure, thanks

I have made dumplings for years but it became too laborious.  Found this recipe here and I am ecstatic!  Very easy and very delicious! Looks like I'll be making dumplings more frequently now. I added the parsley and diced onion. Grandchildren are very happy!

Love this dumpling recipe, so simple!!! Only change I made was instead of regular milk I used buttermilk. So tangy and good! My family loved them. But agree with a previous writer, next time I will double the recipe.

Mine came out doughy in the middle but i think it was because my baking poowder is very old. They had excellent flavor though so i will definitely try again. This recipe doesn't make very much so if your cooking for more than 2/3 people keep that in mind. My kids still loved them even with doughy centers.

We really enjoyed our dumplings! There just wasn't enough of them for us. Next time we make them, we'll just have to double the recipe! ;)

Hands down the best dumplings I've ever had!! I did change it by adding buttermilk instead of milk. Just bought a roasted chicken and picked it apart. Threw the skin and bones in low sodium chicken broth and let simmer. Then strained the broth and  the trinity and a bay leaf. Salt and fresh ground pepper and it was amazing. I recommend doubling this recipe if feeding more than three people. And if you run out of dumplings then just boil the soup and make another batch. It's best to make these right before your going to eat. That way they are light and fluffy.

This is the tried and true method for making dumplings. 
I do add a tablespoon of garlic powder and a half teaspoon of finely minced rosemary. When using them in a beef soup or stew.  Try it... you'll love it.  ??

This is my goto recipe for dumplings and they're fantastic!  When I was growing up, my mom (who was the best cook I've ever known) made dumplings that tasted just like these and the consistency was also the same.  I always make sure that they are cooked through and through and not doughy at all.  Sometimes, I add parsley, always add pepper and a little garlic and onion powder.  I sent the recipe to my Dad the other day as he was making stew and didn't know how to make dumplings.  I've also been known to put dumplings on a thick soup as well.  It eliminates the bread for the table.

This will be a staple in our house from now on. It was the first time I had ever made dumplings.  They were super easy and received rave reviews. I added them to chicken soup I was making and it thickened the broth perfectly. ????

My mom use to always make dumplings with beef stew and I loved them. These turned out just how I remember them. I'm so glad I came across this recipe. This was my first time trying to make them so, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. They were light and fluffy just how I like them. I made them in a homemade chicken soup.

We use this recipe in our industrial kitchen [scaled for more portions obviously] and it is a solid addition to soups and stews with wiggle room if your cooks are sloppy with measuring.

Very good and simple. Am trying to avoid dairy so I used broth and water in place of milk. Doubled it and made it in my food processor. Will use this as my staple dumpling recipe from now on. Thank you!

I use this recipe every time I make chicken and dumplings. The only thing I change is the margarine for extra virgin olive oil and add a 1/2 tsp more of sugar, other than that, It's Perfect.!!!

The dumplings came out perfect! The only thing I added was a little pepper and poultry seasoning. As others said, if you have a big pot of broth, l would double the recipe.

These dumplings were love in a bowl.  I doubled the recipe and used an extra Tablespoon of butter following a couple of reviewers.  Its,important to have a wide rimmed pan if you double it.   Made for chicken and dumplings.   FABULOUS dumplings. Can't wait to make again.

This recipe sounds good, will try it tonight. I've made dumplings following several recipes before and I have had the same problem I saw some other people mentioned, about texture and/or gooeyness  and I've found through my experience, mine rise and get fluffy if I simmer them uncovered rather than covered, I remember my dad cooking them uncovered and his were great, that's why I began doing the same even though most recipes say to cover them...not sure if perhaps different altitudes  or humidity could make a difference for some people or "why" they cook better uncovered for me, just a tip for anyone who wants a different texture to try :)

Worked like a charm, I usually have problems cooking dumplings through completely - but I had no problems here. I added some herbs for color and a bit of freshness. Really saved a rather boring soup for me, thanks!

Per my mom "they are the best dumplings I have ever had! They make my heart sing!"  I made a double batch to add to chicken but needed more so I made another double batch, the family demanded it! Only thing I did different was add some pepper and some Parmesan cheese. Not sure if it made much difference but they were great!

Excellent dumpling recipe. I have made chicken and dumplings using this dumpling recipe for my family several times and they can't get enough of them. One suggestion, use butter instead of margarine.

These dumplings were very easy to make, with no rolling dough or cutting. I cooked them the full 15 minutes, but they seam a little doughy. Good taste. Will use this recipe again!

I was making chicken soup and wanted something different other than noodles or rice. These came along and they were a great change. I made as written and dropped them into my simmering soup by a heaping tablespoon. They took 20 minutes to cook properly and quadrupled in size. The cooking time will definitely depend on size of dumpling you're starting with. Next time if I'm adding these in soup, I will boil separately as it made my broth cloudy. Can't wait to try these in a chicken stew,also would like to add a pinch of nutmeg. Thanks for a simple, quick dumpling that's affordable and not canned Biscuits :)

I did not like this recipe and I followed it to a T. The dumplings fell apart for the most part the ones that did not were not the consistency of what a dumpling should be. I would increase the flour and make them a bit denser.

I was looking for dumplings like my mother made when I was a child, This is it, they turned out delicious. It brought back good memories. I followed the recipe, and added salt, chicken bouillon , black pepper, parsley, little ground sage, and poultry seasoning. Cooked it on almost a boil until they expanded, then turned the heat down on low. It was definitely over the top!! Awesome! Thank you so much for posting . BTW   I doubled the recipe.

These are wonderful dumplings!  I have made many dumpling recipes from this site and this is definitely my favorite for drop dumplings.  I did add an extra tablespoon of butter and since I used white whole wheat flour I had to add extra milk to get the dough to the right consistency.  I also used skim milk since that's all I ever have on hand.  My dumplings were small, maybe 2 t, but I let them simmer for 15 minutes, covered, and they were delightfully soft and yummy.  Just perfect!  Thanks so much for sharing your this recipe!

I agree!  Double the amount of dumplings, food processor makes it easy to incorporate cold butter, then milk.  keep the sugar in the dumpings add garlic.

This is the recipe I use for chicken and dumplings.  I increase most of the ingredients by 50-100% but halve the baking powder.   I roll and cut the dough with a pizza cutter to make dumplings like fat noodles.

I made it using butter as I didn't have margarine and I pulsed it in the food processor adding dry ingredients first, then butter, then milk like another reviewer suggested.I rolled it into balls. Yummy and easy.

I substituted a 1/4 cup of the milk with buttermilk and the dumplings were just how I like them a tad bit chewy and full of flavor.

Wow! I wanted a simple dumpling recipe that I had when I was a child. I've tried others and they didn't turn out right. They were too gummy. These turned out fluffy and very satisfying. I've made these 4 times now, my altered version in my slow cooker right now ready for dinner.

To makes these dairy allergy friendly, I subbed in almond milk, used 3/4 c strong white flour and 1/4 c garbanzo bean/chickpea/besan flour, cut the salt to 1/4 tsp, and used sunflower oil instead of butter. 

Oh my! My alternations made them more filling (1/4 c besan has plant protein in it) and they weren't too salty. We are a low salt family and most American recipes call for too much salt for our liking.

Thank you for this recipe. We shall enjoy this many years into the future.

Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I made fairly small balls and they tripled in size and absorbed all the stock so my soup turned into stew. Next time I'll leave some stock on the side to add after. They taste fantastic! I used whole wheat flour. 

Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. Quick and easy. I would double the recipe next time, as it didn't seem to be enough for a large pot of chicken soup.

These are delicious, simple and filling. I use butter instead of margarine and I grind my own spelt and einkorn flour. I also use more butter than this recipe calls for, about twice as much because I love butter. Thickens up the broth perfectly and super easy to whip up!

IMPORTANT : Dumplings more than double in size when cooking and soak up a large amount of liquid from the stew. 
I cook mine separately in water or a light broth, then add to the simmering stew 10mins before serving.
GREAT RECIPE

My husband loves dumplings and I make what I call an egg noodle dumpling. He loves them, but I decided to try these dumplings for him tonight and he was in love. Lighter, tastier for him, easier for me, absolutely perfect. Thanks for a great recipe, and I did not add or subtract a thing.

This was very good -- actually added it to my crock pot supper. So ended up cooking it a bit longer -- but these were tender & flaky.  Did use 2 Tablespoons butter.  Grandson gave very favorable reviews--went back for seconds & thirds.  Husband suggested he liked biscuits better.

My children love these dumplings! Every time I make soup or stew I have to put in dumplings. All I do that is different is add a bit of poultry seasoning (when I make chicken or turkey soup/stew). Also instead of dropping them in by the spoonful I roll them by hand then drop them in. Thank you for sharing.

Made these with parsley and thyme mixed in a crock pot of chicken soup.
It takes about 40 minutes for them to cook in the crock pot instead of on the stove but it was well worth the wait!

Delicious especially for adding to scrap soups, easy to make with what should always be in the kitchen.

Love these dumplin's! I made chicken soup and added these dumplings, first time I've made dumplings, an they were a hit! 
My husband ate 3 servings and declared it his new favorite! Other recipes on AR were more complicated, but these are so easy to make.
In my recipe box to be made again!

These came out perfect.  Light and fluffy on the inside.  Perfect balance of ingredients. I did add just the smallest tad more milk, but anyone with baking experience knows that liquid in recipe such as this the amount of liquid needed depends of moisture content in the flour and how loose or dense the flour is when measured.  And I'm sure it would have been fine otherwise, I just  wanted my mix a little loose.  I used dill and granulated onion instead of parsley for flavor.

I have tried soooooo many dumpling recipes, and they were all fine, but this one is by far the best!  Light and gratifying without the inevitable heaviness of even the best dumplings.  They complement the stew instead of upstaging it. So happy to have found an authentic, time-tested and family-trusted recipe to hand down to my kids.  Thank you, Carol!  I'm old school, like you, and really appreciate that you've shared this little gem!

Made these last night to put over beef stew. Hadn't made steamed dumplings in years; I wonder why I had quit making them after the first bite. Whole family loved them. I doubled the recipe and among the five of us, there were only two left. Soft, steamy, fragrant, and really fast and easy. The snow outside surely made them taste better. I highly recommend this recipe.

Finally got a chance to try these after having the recipe saved for a year:)
Very good...yum,yum,yum!!! We put them on top of a chicken soup to cook...
They will absorb the broth it was still good but turned into a stew...

Didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect!

This is closest to my grandmother's I've ever had. They were fluffy and soaked up the chicken broth flavor. Perfect meal for a sub zero night in Indiana!

I thought I had Bisquick in my pantry, and as usual I turned to All Recipes for help. I'm glad I didn't have any Bisquick!  The dumplings in this recipe were perfect and very easy! I saved it to my recipe box because it will be my go to recipe for dumplings from now on.

I doubled it and threw them in a quick chicken soup (cut up chicken breast, saute, throw in carrots, celery, onion, cook until tender, add two quarts of broth and season to taste...simmer). Delicious! No leftovers! Also super easy to do. Thanks!

I made these dumplings tonight for the first time for my chicken and dumpling recipe and was amazed at how light and fluffy these were.  I have to admit these were the best dumplings I have ever made and I've been making dumplings for 50 years. Glad I found this recipe its a keeper. I did make one small change, instead of using all milk I used half-and-half and milk in equal proportions.

Perfect! This worked great. We made a big pot of chicken noodle soup and doubled this recipe to dollop into the broth. The whole family loved it and my son declared it his new favorite food.

I put these dumplings in the Irish Chicken and dumplings recipe and loved it. Next time I would make 1.5 batches since they were such a hit that they disappeared before the rest of the soup!

Made these for a stew - fabulous!  A new replacement for the boring starches I'm always trying to come up with to balance dinner.  My entire family loves them. Just keep in mind that they will "expand" once you drop them in (think how a biscuit rises while baking in an oven - very similar).

These are AWESOME!! I had made dumplings from another recipe 2 weeks ago and I could taste the baking powder and they were dense. These are light and fluffy and pure deliciousness. I had to add a little bit more milk and I doubled the recipe so I would have LOTS of yummy dumplings! Thank you for the recipe.

I've only tried dumplings a couple times before and failed at each…but this recipe is perfect for my son :)
I didn't try these (I'm vegetarian) but I did make them for my own chicken soup recipe tonight for my son, who has never been a fan of anything 'white' to eat, but he had at least 5 of these in his soup…he actually went for seconds!  Thank you :)
The only thing I did differently was cook them longer because I did a crock pot soup and it wasn't quite simmering so I cooked about twice as long as suggested, and I did add the parsley and a couple pinches of minced garlic (because almost everything we eat needs more garlic around here)
Thanks again for a great recipe.

I am not a dumpling lover therefore I don't usually make dumplings but my husband and two sons LOVE dumplings and requested them with my homemade chicken soup.  I made as the recipe instructed except I used butter instead of margarine (never), added a bunch of chopped fresh parsley to the dry mixture (because I had a lot left over from my soup) and I tripled the recipe (as I have a BIG eaten family :)  I refrigerated the batter for at least 10-15 minutes as I was putting the final touches in my soup.  I just dropped a dollop of batter with a tablespoon into my HUGE stock pot of soup that has been simmering ALL DAY and left the lid on for 15 minutes. I dipped the table spoon into HOT soup between each dropping of batter to ensure a smooth entry.  I had to repeat several times since I tripled the recipe.  Even though I am not a "dumpling" lover, I thought these were very good. (I probably should have simmered mine a bit longer than 15 minutes BUT my family of boys/men LOVED THEM!!  THANK YOU for such a SIMPLE/FAST recipe that doesn't taste SIMPLE/FAST!  Bon Appétit

Light fluffy tasty and easy. I doubled the recipe, used butter (double the amount to get to crumble stage) and a bit more milk. The kids loved them and they are hard to please. These are going to be the new standard in my house.

I am NOT the best cook and this was the first biscuit recipe I did not ruin.  Thanks! Definitely listen to the last review and stir in milk a little at a time. I stirred in half the milk needed and thought mine was probably ok; stirred in the rest- too sticky o_o but just a little flour fixed it. My dumplings turned out amazing! Note: 1 1/2 pieces will fluff into pretty big dumplings

It's my go to recipe for dumplings. I cook it up with 'Stew IV', I vary it up with adding spices and cheese. Whatever I'm in the mood for. Turns out great every time.

I never made dumplings before but wanted to give it a try. I found this recipe about 6 mos. ago and gave it a try, we all loved them and I've made them several times. I have even made them on chicken casserole in the oven covered with foil. I bake for 30 minutes and they are perfect!

First time for me making dumplings.  Loved them.  May try onion and/or garlic powder as suggested in comments but loved them as they are.  Didn't overwork them..very fluffy inside.  I used cooked chicken that I"d cooked in the crockpot (one breast), an onion, few stalks of celery and 5 or 6 carrots, covered with chicken broth and then some, added salt and pepper, and simmered for an hour or so until making the dumplings---increased heat a bit and cooked for 15 minutes.  The broth was thickened by the dumplings and even my husband who is adament that he doesn't like "bready" things in soup liked it.  Will definitely be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out wonderfully - fluffy and light.  I followed the recipe with the only exception being a little less sugar (I only put in a pinch).  Remember to mix only enough to incorporate and leave the lid on.... it makes the difference!

I used these to round out a very simple vegetable soup since we were nearing the end of our grocery supply. I used two teaspoons to kind of scoop the dough back and forth into a little football and plop it in the pot -- very easy, and it made closer to 12 dumplings for me (each roughly plum-sized once they puffed up) so slightly more than the recipe indicated. Fine by me, because they were a huge hit! My boyfriend kept raving about the soup and it was absolutely the SIMPLEST thing and very filling. The flour in the dumplings kind of made the broth slightly creamy, and I really like that these dumplings can be seasoned differently with various spices and such. I added about 1-2 teaspoons each of olive oil and butter to make up for some margarine (we were out of basically everything) and they are very flavourful that way. Because these don't include egg, they can easily be made vegan with non-dairy milk and either all olive oil or a vegan margarine. So many possibilities! I might  try working in some fresh herbs or pesto next time. These are so versatile, I'm definitely adding them to regular rotation for our soups. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Delightful,light and fluffy! I am NO chef and this recipe was easy and tasted wonderful with my own easy weeknight chicken recipe. Kid approved by my 7yr old. I had to look up the term "cut in" and happy I did! No changes just doubled the recipe. Happy Cooking,thanks Carol's mom.

I have never made dumplings before, but these are grand! My slow cooked chicken and dumplings recipe always called for a can on biscuits torn up and thrown in at the end as the dumpings. I had forgotten the can one time when I went shopping so I searched for a dumpling recipe when I found this. It makes my chicken and dumplings solo much better. I tried to double this recipe the second time I made it cause just one batch wasn't enough, but it didn't turn our right. Not sure what went wrong, so the next time I just made 2 batches of it and threw them in and they came out perfect! I will never buy canned biscuits for dumplings again!!! Thank you!

These where amazing in my chicken and dumplings! I had to add a little extra flour and the parsley is a most! It enhances the flavor more than you think it would.

Delicious! I added dried hand crushed rosemary with a few other herbs with the parsley. So yummy! Also, if you cool it for an hour beforehand it allows you to form it into balls very easily

Delicious! The only problem is I wish I made more. I don't normally like dumplings but my husband does and we both loved them in my chicken soup. I used gluten free flour and made them small like some suggested. Thank you!

Great Recipe.  They are light and fluffy. I added about an 1/8 more water to help form the dough. Paired well with my corn meal porridge!

If you try the parsley version try using fresh parsley instead of dried. I thought the parsley flakes were tasteless and you only need about a teaspoon of fresh but the flavor is so much better.

Thanks, Carol for bringing back childhood memories of chicken & dumplings that taste like dumplings ~ and not baking soda bitter, like Bisquick dumplings! I've given it 5 stars for that, but I admit I followed other reviewers' advice and upped the butter (never margarine!!) to 2 TBS. Great recipe, easy to make, perfect directions.

These were super good on top of chicken stew! I used cake flour, and it made such nice, light, fluffy dumplings. I used the trick from a previous reviewer and dunked my spoon in the hot stew between dumplings to keep the dough from sticking. Worked like a charm!

They turned out perfect. I put them in the crock pot with the chicken and left them for 30 minutes. They tasted great. Better than biscuits.

Very simple! Dropped dumplings in simmering pot and put lid on and simmered 15 minutes. Perfection. They puffed out and were moist on outside and biscuit like on inside.  Added nice amount of thickness to the broth.  Did double the recipe.  As it is, recipe makes small batch.  I think this was easier, and it was less time consuming, than the instant dumplings from the freezer.  Also, better for you as there was not a list as long as my arm of artificial ingredients! Will use this recipe from now on! Thanks!

First off, amazing recipe! They turned out perfect! I doubled the recipe, because we really like dumplings,  and I am really glad I did. The only thing I changed was since I doubled it, I added milk until moist. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Super easy recipe! If you want a quick and easy meal, just boil some broth, veggies and throw the dumplings in at the end... ready meal in about 30 minutes! My daughter loves these dumplings and make them when I’m stumped for a dinner idea or if I’m in a hurry.

I made chicken and dumplings using this recipe for the dumplings. I did everything exactly like the recipe except instead of spooning the dough into the soup I formed loose balls with my hands. It was super easy and was good except the dumplings were very bland tasting, like didn't taste like anything at all really. I still gave it 4 stars because they were still good. Maybe next time I will add more salt or something to the dough mixture.

So sad!  I followed the recipe to the tee and the dumplings disintegrated in the soup.  It ended up making a thick broth, which tasted fine, but I may try a different recipe next time.

I cut the recipe in half and completely forgot about the baking powder. They were still very good. Probably not as fluffy as they would have been with the baking powder but still tasty.

I don't think these dumplings were "outstanding" or even "great". I give them okay. More than anything it lacks flavor. I think there needs to be more salt and sugar. I will add more of both the next time I make dumplings.

These were sooo good! I have made chicken & dumplings time after time and they always came out just okay, but I had always used Bisquik or refrigerated dough. The homemade dumplings make all the difference. I was really surprised by how easy these were to make! Like another reviewer, I also used oil in place of margarine. Delicious!

This was super easy to make. I did make some changes though. I added an additional 1/2T. of butter, and a couple(ish) teaspoons of garlic and onion powder! They were delicious. I also chose to flour my fingers and make half dollar sized disks instead of a few huge dumplings. I agree with other posts when they recommend not stirring the mixture after adding the dumplings, just put on the lid, set the timer, and walk away.  I had decided to make a double serving of this (I made a double batch of the leftover turkey and dumpling recipe that was also on this cite) and it was definitely too much. So I with held almost half of the dumplings, added a bit more flour to them and formed them into biscuits. I baked them at 400 for 8 minutes and they also turned out very good.

Quick and simple and they did fluff up.    However, they were dry with a baking powder taste.  I might try it again, but modify it more than I did already.  I used 2 T. of softened butter.

Very tasty but a bit gooey. In the end they really thickened up my soup nicely and tasted great but were a bit wet and gooey for my preference. I will make them again though! :)

Easy& delicious! I have made this twice. Great for a quick meal in a vegetable soup base. I omit the sugar. I make them smaller so they are more dumpling-ish and less biscuit-ish. Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe.  I used my own chicken soup recipe and just added these and as everyone said, they thickened the soup quite nicely. One word of caution for those newby cooks (like myself), if your soup is already simmering, after you drop the dumplings in, turn down your heat to low otherwise as soon as you put on the lid for the 15 minute time frame it will start to boil and your dumplings will be soggy (unless you like them like that).  Happy cooking!

The secret to Grandma's dumplings is adding an egg to hold them together and rolling them thin, then cut in 1/4 stips, and the length of your choice.  I do about 2".

i found this recipie and i have to say me and mine are DIE HARD FANS of them, i make all sorts of stews from scratch all the time and these dumplings are perfect for all of them, be it rabbit or deer or beef or chicken, just great dumplings all around, thou depending on the stew il add thym or rosemary instead of parsley, as well as a pinch of garlic powder or onion powder. other then that it is a perfect super awsome dumpling recipe and i love it!

I doubled the ingredients so I could have a larger batch...not sure if that's the reason why they didn't come out.  My dumplings were super soft and fell apart in the water so all I was left with was a thick soupy mess!  I will try again, but next time I'll use more flour.

I love making these! So simple to make in a food processor and you can really add anything to them to flavor them more. I froze a batch but haven't tried them in a soup from frozen form yet. Will update again after I try it :)

I made these as a last minute addition to some homemade chicken soup at my daughter's request.  This was my first time making dumplings and I thought they turned out well.  My daughter liked them too.  I liked that the recipe was quick, easy to follow and used ingredients I always have at home.  Many recipes I found used a biscuit mix and I don't always have that on hand.  My soup was already quite flavorful so I didn't think the dumplings needed anything extra.  Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy to make and add to almost anything.  The entire family loves these.  Wouldn't use alone as biscuits though.  Not enough flavor on its own.

my son helped make these dumplings to go with our beef stew. He grabbed the self raising flour instead of the AP flour but it worked out fine! Not sure if they were bigger and fluffier because of that, but I loved them and will continue to use self raising flour in my dumplings :)

Delicious, light, fluffy and easy to make. Do not over mix the dough and make sure your liquid is on a low simmer when you add them to the pot-not a high rolling boil. Add the dumplings quickly and cover the pot and let them plump up into tender balls of yumminess for 15 minutes-do not overlook them. Made them last night and the pot is empty. My hubby loved them!

okay...  I had never ever made any type of dumpling in my life...  I've purchased the long flat noodle-looking dumplings in the freezer section (Mary B brand, maybe?), and that's it.  I was craving chicken and dumplings, and already had the chicken, and broth, and vegetable section from a different recipe to try... instead of their dumpling part, I used this recipe, making them smaller, like teaspoonful sized, and they were incredible.  My husband said, 'this is the best chicken and dumplings I've ever had...ever!'  

outstanding...simply outstanding.  Five plus stars....

Tried these today with beef stew as an alternative to my standard baking powder biscuits, and they worked really well.  I made the recipe as stated, but found I didn't the full amount of milk to make a soft dough.  I made 6 large dumplings, and had some dough left over (but no more room in the pot for more, and no time to do it in batches), checked them at 15 mins, then covered for an additional 5 mins.  They came out fluffy and fully cooked, my husband loved them!

I thought that these were pretty good.   My husband however was not to impressed.   They are not like southern dumplings.  I think that was he did not like.  I will make them again.  It was pretty easy to make.

I halved this recipe to use in the little pot of chicken soup I made for myself. They were delicious and this is now my go-to dumpling recipe. Very easy, fast, and wonderful. I couldn't ask for more than that!

I was delighted with the ease of this recipe.  I made it 2 ways because of my gluten sensitivity.  I made one batch as described.  The second I substituted a gluten-free flour blend, used parsley for identification, scant 1/2 tsp. Xanthan gum and used 1 egg+almond milk to equal the 1/2 C. of milk.  The dumplings came out quite light and held up to cooking in the gravy.  This was a win.

These dumplings are as close to my late Mom's as I've come across. I added a pinch of baking soda to make them just a littl lighter. Excellent all around!

EASY, FAST, PERFECT.  I followed the recipe to a T and will never add noodles to soup again.  If you crave dense moist chewy dumplings then look no further.  I made some chicken soup last night and I added dumplings in less time than it would have taken me to cook the noodles.  One word of advice is that these will expand so not only will one batch be enough for about 3 quarts of soup but will also displace additional liquid during cooking. (leave room in the pot)

This was my first ever attempt at dumplings and it was simple and REALLY good.  Family doesn't want noodles anymore in my chicken soup.  Only thing I did different was plop very small spoonfuls into my pot.

Just made it, first time (thought I was messing up because I AM NOT a baker)... however this is not really baking and came out perfect. Thanks so much for the recipe, will make again (I tripled the recipe, used parsley flakes and garlic powder and melted butter into milk for fully incorporated flavor. Also made beforehand, stored in fridge until ready, however being cold, it dropped the temp of the stew and it actually took 30 min to steam). Yummy in my beef stew.

Very good. I used parsley and it tasted like the Bisquick ones I've always made, without the  unnatural ingredients. Guess there's no need to buy Bisquick anymore.

This is my favorite dumpling recipe.  Just enough of the dumpling seems to break down in the soup / broth as it cooks to make it just a little thicker but not so much that they dissolve.  I don't change a single ingredient but I always double the recipe for my hungry brood.  Most often I make it with the Fast Chicken Soup Base (but I add an extra 2 cups of chicken broth for the dumplings to cook in).  I keep meaning to add a photo but I always forget and just dig in!

I love dumplings and had always made them from a baking mix.  Not anymore.  These are by far the best dumplings I have ever had.  My hubby loves them too.  No more box mix for me!

Wonderfully simple and flexable! You can make them plan or add any combination of spices to suit your stew or soup. I make them sometimes in chicken broth as a side dish. Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I've abandoned my previous dumpling recipe in favor of this one.  It cooks up so good, like fluffy, moist, flavorful clouds in the broth.

This is an excellent recipe to begin with; but my mom -- and Dad, when he decided he wanted to cook! -- always added cinnamon and raisins to sweet dumplin's!  Amazing how well they went with savory stews and soups!

They are great
I added Cut up chives or shallots and some fresh thyme. It just assisted to make them so great as I love to cook with fresh thym out of my herb garden.

Made these to top a thick 13 bean soup in the crockpot.  They came out cooked thru, fluffy & delicious.  I did add some parsley for color & about 1/4 c. of shredded reduced fat cheddar (mixed in w/ the dry ingredients), also melted the butter and added to the milk, which was microwaved to room temp.   (Obviously, cold ingredients won't cook as quickly as  room temp ones).  Mixed gently & only just enough to combine & dropped by teaspoonfuls and got 9 dumplings.  My teen was skeptical since she's never had dumplings, but she loved it and ate 2 big bowls full.   This ones a keeper & I'm looking forward to making them again w/ different herbs

I joined allrecipes just so that I may review this recipe.  It is lilke a pastry.  It is so sweet and chewy and perfect.  I made this for my Chicken Paprika dish and we stuffed ourselves silly because the dumplings were so outstanding.  This is so much better than the standard egg, flour, water that I grew up on.

I had some buttermilk in the fridge so I used it rather than regular milk. These were outstanding. My family loves dumplings and said that these were the best ever. I doubled the recipe and they were wiped out.

Yum!!! and Easy. I didn't have quite enough butter in the house (I never use margrine, just don't like the taste) so I used the last bit of butter I had and a capful of corn oil. I was super careful to mix oils thoroughly for an even crumble before the milk and they worked super! I'll use butter next time, and I'll use this recipe for the ret of my life. It is just delicious.

I don't know what I did wrong but these were incredibly mushy on the outside.  The inside was just like I remember my Grandma's tasting, but texture was way off.  In all fairness, I did just boil them in water as opposed to the stew as that's how she did it (and then mixed with butter...yum!).

I'm rating this 4 stars because I'm pretty sure I screwed it up, because the recipe was not clear enough.  The milk should be room temperature, otherwise it clumps up the flour and does not yield and even consistency.  It absorbs flour too quickly.  I then had to mix too much to try to incorporate the rest of the flour, which made the dough tough and super doughy after cooking.  I will try this again and re-rate it then.

OMG - this was so delightfully delicious!!! I actually boiled a chicken breast until tender and falling apart and then made 3 cans chicken broth + 2 cans cream of chicken soup and then shredded the chicken and added the dumplings - very very good!!! Thanks for a recipe that I will be putting together for years to come!

I'm enjoying this as I type!  This is my first time making and tasting these Western dumplings.  Before, I had only been exposed to Chinese dumplings, so I was a bit uncertain about how these would turn out.  Surprisingly, it is great and so easy to make!  Mine turned out soft and melty on the outside, and a bit biscuit-like on the inside.  I ran out of soup stock, so I used a bag of instant ramen chicken seasoning.  It goes very well together!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these dumplings for the Mom's beef stew recipe that I found on here also.  They were YUM-O!  I will definitely make these again!  They were light and fluffy and tasted great!

This have become my go-to recipe for dumplings -Just like my mom used to put on top of her beef stew - yum!  I like to sprinkle some fresh parsley or thyme in the dough sometimes too.    For the person who tried to float these in boiling water to cook isn't getting the concept and shouldn't have put a poor rating!  Dumplings are meant to nestle on top of a stew or soup and cook in it's steam while soaking up yummy juices on the bottom!  :)

I hate when people rate a recipe after modifying it, but I don't think my change could affect it that much: I used 50% whole wheat flour, and .5tsp sugar -with a diabetic in the family I try and squeeze in as much fiber, and reduce the sugar as much as possible to whatever I cook. Otherwise all the same and these were delicious. I've never actually made dumplings before, and I thought I'd drop a couple into my stew last night. These were the perfect addition! One thing that caught me off guard is just how much they expand! There were a couple of two-bite dumplings before I got the hang of it.

These are the only dumplings I'll ever make. I use butter in the place of margarine but that is the only thing I do differently.  Perfect recipe and one to pass on to my daughters.  Love it.

Lovely and light.  I added a 1/2 tsp of garlic and 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese to these (in the dry ingredients) and also melted the butter and used room temp milk. The trick is not to over mix and never lift the lid.  They were wonderful!!!  I would definetly double or triple the recipe if serving more than 3 or 4 ppl.

My mother used to make chicken and rice with dumplings all the time when I was a child. She is no longer with us, and unfortunately her recipe is long gone.  I was craving chicken soup with dumplings, and tried this out, and they were so good!  They honestly transported me back to my childhood.  Absolutely delicious, and my three year old loved them too.  They are a great change from pasta or rice, and they were very tender and sweet.  A great recipe, and very easy to make.

Absolutely delicious. I have never before made dumplings, but for some odd reason I was craving chicken and dumplings last night for dinner. I whipped these up really fast, and they were absolutely scrumptious. Thank you Carol for a wonderful recipe!

Really easy to make. I needed more margarine, but no problem there.  I made these for chicken n dumplins when I didn't have any canned biscuit dough.  They tasted better, were much cheaper and what's best is that I get to say I made it all from scratch!  :-D  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

A perfect dumpling recipe for stew.  I made as directed, but stuck the pot under the broiler for 2 or 3 minutes afterwards to brown the dumplings slightly.  Very fluffy, light, delicious.

Pretty good, but a little heavier than I'm used to, but that's just personal preference. I'd like to try these again with the parsley. Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

I may be doing something wrong but I thought they were too heavy.  I followed the recipe (except used Smart Balance rather than butter) and did not lift the lid on the pan. Overall everyone liked them but I would have liked a lighter, fluffier version!

Good recipe in spite of some missteps on my part!

This is a really solid soup dumpling that is pretty forgiving.   I tried to use my food processor to mix these in 2 batches after I doubled the recipe for a large -pot of soup.   One dough was a little wet and the other a little dry due to an imprecise measuring of flour on my part, so I mixed them together and was pretty concerned that my over-mixing would hurt the dumplings.     No such worry.   The dumplings were delicious and fluffed up well.   I boiled them in broth, thickened the broth and added cream and then added the cooked veggies and chicken back to the crock pot with the dumplings to serve.    I was concerned with the crock pot on warm the dumplings would disintegrate into the mix but they got even more firm and full of broth flavor.    This will be my go-to dumpling base moving forward.

These Dumplings were SOOOOOO good! It's the first time I've made dumplings and you have submitted such a great recipe, Carol, that there's no way it could have turned out bad. I am so glad that I found your recipe to try first. I will never use another! I made the parsley dumplings, doubled the recipe and my WHOLE family LOVED them. THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH for sharing! (Sorry Carol, I saw Heidi's name on top, but now I see that she's the one that submitted the photo.)

I had to review because I have made this recipe several times now and these dumplings are always delicious!  I try not to double the recipe because when I do I end up eating too many 'cause they are so light.  I usually make with creamy chicken soup but tonight i am making them with beef stew :)

This was so easy, and so tasty that I too feel saved now from a childhood of Bisquick dumplings.  I knew not what I was missing!!  The first chilly night we had this year, I used this recipe to put dumplings in my split pea soup.  So much better than a side of bread or garlic toast!!

De-licious!  I made these dumplings to go with stewed plums.  I used whole wheat pastry and soymilk, no other changes. Thanks for the fantastically easy and tasty recipe, Carol!

This reminds me of dumplings my grandmother used to make. Neither my mother nor I got the recipe from her before she passed away, so I was ecstatic when I found it here. I added my dumplings to cream of chicken with rice soup. Thank you so much Carol!

I made these to go with Chicken Paprikash II submitted by SHAELYNUMBER10. I did end up having to add a little extra flour to make the dough " soft " as the recipe stated it should be, instead of sticky. I warmed my milk in the microwave before adding it also. I cut the butter in with the whisk . Then i cooked them in the juice from the paprikash after removing the chicken to be deboned. Added the paprikash sour cream mixture once the dumplings cooked covered for 10 mins. They turned out perfect, first time ive ever had dumplings turn out right. Thank you.

Absolutely fantastic! I loved these dumplings. I added the parsley and dropped them into a pot of chicken stew, and my boyfriend absolutely could not stop eating them. He left the chicken behind and inhaled the dumplings! Thanks so much for an amazing recipe, this is a permanent addition to my recipe book.

These were pretty good. Some turned out more gummy than I would have liked...but the ones that didn't were excellent. I will stick to using bisquick instead, but will keep this recipe around.

When I moved I somehow lost all my cookbooks, and was in need of a dumpling recipe.  This recipe was a great new one that I will use again.  I increased the margarine by a tablespoon and increased the milk by half a cup to make the dough a bit stickier and it turned out perfectly!!

I made this for my beef stew this evening and it was just what I was looking for...it came out nice and light and fluffy.  I added some rosemary, because I didn't have parsley, pepper, and an extra tbsp of butter.  I have been looking for a good dumpling recipe for a long time, and this is it...Thanks for posting it!

I have never made dumplings before because my mom always made little clumps of what she called dumplings, so I was afraid.  My fiance was asking me to try to make some, found this recipe and gave it a whirl.  WE LOVE THEM!!  Definitely a keeper!!

Yum! I made these to go with the slow cooker chicken and dumplings and was surprised at how tasty and easy it was to make dumplings. I added some fresh chopped rosemary and thyme and black pepper; the flavor was outstanding. I did double the butter to 2 T. Will make again!

Very good dumpling recipe.  I haven't had them since I was a kid and my Mom made them... these really reminded me of the ones she would make!  I added dried parsley, ground pepper and fresh basil (about 12 leaves, finely chopped) to the mixture.  I had to use a bit more milk then called for.  Really tasty.

I am just a beginner in the kitchen, so this rating may be more a reflection of my skill than of the recipe. 

 When I cut in the tablespoon of margarine the dry mix was still quite powdery -not crumbly. So I added more until it started to resemble crumbles.

After I added the milk the mixture became very sticky -not exactly what I'd call soft. I see the recipe said it made 6 dumplings, but it seemed to me that they would be HUGE. So I dropped nine large spoonfuls of the dough into my vegetable chowder. After the 15 minutes of simmering without lifting the lid they were still very dense and seemed uncooked in the middle -so I left them another 15 minutes. It didn't make any difference. They seemed reluctant to cook in the middle. They remained dense and moist. I don't know if they were just too big or what I did wrong.

This recipe was GREAT!  I have always been a little nervous about cooking dumplings but they turned out perfect.  The only thing I did differently was add a little pepper to the dough.  I will never use the canned biscuts for dumplings again!  Thanka for sharing!

Wow.  How can something so simple be so good?  These dumplings are the absolute best I've ever had.  They come out light and fluffy, and they make the sauce of your soup or stew thicken a little so it's the perfect consistency.  I did follow the suggestion of several other reviewers and use 2 tablespoons of butter (I never use margerine.)  Wonderful!

I gave it 4 stars because I think it had to much baking powder/soda(my fault if course) so then I added more butter, flour, chicken boullion, parsley, and sugar. It was hit, I have 3 boys, a husband, and a VERY picky 6 year old daughter and they were upset that we ran out of dumplings. I already make the BEST chicken part of the chicken and dumplings and now i have found the best dumpling.

OK, I do not know if I did this wrong or not.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I did however, double the recipe.  The dumplings shrunk down to the size of grapes almost.  It did however make my stock creamy and gravy like, which I did not mind.  But the dumplings turned gummy and dense.  The texture was similar to what you get in restaurant or canned soup chicken & dumplings.  If you prefer a soft fluffy tender dumpling, this is not the dumpling for you.  Also, I would definately reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes at a simmer instead of 15 minutes.

These are very easy, and very good! I had never made dumplings from scratch, so this was my first time. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they came out! I used them on Chicken and Dumplings. A few adjustments, per our tastes: Used 2/3 cup white flour and 1/3 whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/4 tsp salt. This will be my staple dumpling recipe from now on. :)

Really tasty dumplings! My boyfriend raved about these! First time I ever made them and they came out light , fluffy and perfect. I halved the recipe, as I only wanted to make 3 - but ended up with 6 large dumplings! Not complaining though! I added som fresh chopped parsley and a little ground black pepper. Delicious!

Wonderful recipe!! I tried 2 others and they were bitter. I doubled this recipe per others suggestions and added it to a mock chicken soup. Turns out I didn't need to double the recipe. I'm hoping the left over dough will make more dumplings tomorrow because these were delicious!!! Light, fluffy and not bitter in the least! I added parsley and a little dill to the dry ingredients and they were perfect!

This is a really good dumpling recipe. Next time I make it, I'll make the dumplings bigger because they tend to dissolve quite a bit in the stew, and I like big dumplings. The parsley adds lots of color and helps with presentation.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy and light.  I used self rising flour instead of all purpose with salt and baking powder.  If the stew is thick, they stay on top which keeps them from getting gooey.  Mine turned out soft and fluffy.

These are the perfect dumplings. The little bit of sugar in this dumpling recipe compliments any soup. So easy to make. I'm glad that I finally found the perfect dumpling.

I'm giving this a great rating because I think the dumplings would have turned out fine if I had used smaller scoops of dough into my soup. I dropped four spoonfuls of it into the broccoli cheese soup listed in this site. It took more than 15 minutes for them to cook and I'm afraid never cooked dry if you will. They stayed very moist and doughy. It was my first try at them though and I appreciate the quickness and ease of this recipe. Thanks

These dumplings are fluffy in nature. I wound up having to add twice as much milk to make the dough "droppable."
