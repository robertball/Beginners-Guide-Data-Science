Very yummy! My picky picky husband licked his plate clean! Very easy, I served over buttery angel hair pasta and added some peas to the sauce. I also used about 1/3 cup water because the 2 tbsp were not enough, the sauce was too thick

This dish was horrible -.  It tasted bad.....it was like having cream of chciken soup right out the can with no water on top of chicken....and there was almost no lemon flavor.

Over all a quick and easy week night chicken dish.  I did make a few changes.  Someone had mentioned adding more lemon juice, so I, too, used 2 T of lemon juice instead of 1 and I think it could still stand some more if you want the chicken to taste of lemon.  I also cooked the chicken quite a bit longer than the 5 minutes after returning to the sauce to reach the desired temperature, but the chicken itself was good...just not GREAT.  I paired it with a vegetable rice pilaf and thought they went well together.  I haven't decided if I'll make this again (as is) or not.  I may keep looking for that "lemon chicken" recipe.

A fantastic version of the soup/chicken/skillet meal. We made it without peppers but loved the lemon in it.

Entire family including picky 3 yr old loved this. I made as directed with the exception of using vegetable oil as I was out of spray, and just using the juice from the lemon after removing the 4 slices, without measuring it. It might have been 2 TBSP. I also added 1 clove minced garlic to the pan while browning the chicken.  Served over brown rice with steamed 'stir fry blend' veggies.  This will be added to the rotation for sure!

This was delicious and easy.  Next time I will double the sauce. I had three large breasts, and there was barely enough. I served it over brown rice with a ceaser salad. I added more lemon juice because I like it lemony, but my family said it was too much. Husband, mother and 4 yr old son gobbled it up.

This didn't taste bad, but it wasn't good either. I probably won't make it again, but I wouldn't have to go to McDonald's on the way home if someone else served it at a dinner we went to.  :)

Good recipe but needs a little more flavor. I added 1/2 of lemon juice, paprika and cayenne pepper to the sauce. If I hadn't added a LOT more lemon juice to this it would have been flavorless. A great light summer meal!

quick, easy, healthy and really pretty good! great for when you don't have much time. i used dried parsley and yellow pepper instead of fresh parsley and red or green pepper because that 's what i had and it was still really good. i served it over rice and we squeezed lemon over top to make it more lemony!

Used half a lemon instead of 1tbs lemon juice. Added 1/3 cup water and used both red and green peppers. Used minced garlic while browning chicken. Served over egg noodles. Can't imagine how thick and bland the sauce would be without these changes.

UPDATE: I put mixed all the ingredients into the pan and added 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the mix. I then added the raw chicken breasts into the mixture and let it set for about 3 or 4 hours. When my husband was ready for dinner I threw the pan onto the stove and cooked the chicken for 25 minutes flipping it over every 3 minutes so it got cooked evenly. The sauce became very thin but the chicken was amazing and my husband LOVED it this time. He is asking I make it for him again. Much better then the last time I made it. Also, this recipe makes the chicken very juicy. Love it.

This chicken was delicious, and my boyfriend loved it too. I tenderized the chicken breasts first and added lemon slices to the pan while everything was simmering for added lemony goodness.

Good recipe though I made a few adjustments. I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom instead. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and added salt and pepper to taste. Instead of water I used chicken broth and tripled the amount called for. Very easy and yummy.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!! This is an almost weekly meal for us! I serve it over whole grain rice (adds SO much more flavor than white) and it is delicious!
