I made this for my book club friends and did double the chili powder and paprika.  The first time I made it I used regular paprika, but then I made the second batch using it, and I'd highly recommend using the smoked paprika!!  I also didn't quite use all the dressing.  This is delicious, and I'd make it again in a heartbeat!  Thanks for the recipe!

I think the chile powder and paprika need doubled but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. This was excellent and so much easier to eat.
