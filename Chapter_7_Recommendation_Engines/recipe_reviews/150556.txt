Well, I was really really hoping to rate this higher. But it wasn't awesome. You have to really love apples for this. I enjoyed the condensed milk mixture though. The most vague thing about the recipe though is the boiled water. You must start boiling water when you preheat the oven. Water should be listed in the ingredients for the boiling water part. I could definitely see how the other reviewer would use the left overs in rice, and i may try it for mine.

This has potential.  I didn't do the cook water bath thing and may have cooked too long - my sauce sort of curdled.  The flavor was good though.  Very sweet and rich.  The next day I cut up the apples and added the whole mixture to some white rice.  My little ones liked it.

Delicious! I skipped the raisins and served this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Even my husband, who is not an apple lover, enjoyed this dessert.
