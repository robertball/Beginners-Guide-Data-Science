Pretty close to the store bought! I couldn't choose which is better!  One key I would say is to definitely take them out of the oven before recipe time and not after. Let them sit and firm up.   Frosting recipe I substituted half the butter with some cream cheese but that's just my liking.

I don't know what Lofthouse cookies are, but these were pretty good. Since my cake mix was only 15.25 oz (3 oz discrepancy - everything is shrinking but the price!), I added a few extra tblsp of flour, as well as 1/2 tsp salt. I floured my hands as I was rolling them which was a big help (very sticky dough otherwise).  The baking time was correct, and I got just over 2 doz. I did not use the listed frosting (time constraints) but frosted them with a canned butter frosting and sprinkles. I'm taking them to a church event tomorrow. A cake-like cookie that came together quickly. Thank you!

These were great! I used peanut oil instead of soybean, and I'll admit I cheated and used canned frosting.  But the cherry frosting with sprinkles really worked with these cookies.  And they really do taste like the ones from the grocery store - cakey, sweet, so good!  The batter was a weird texture - a little gummy, but they came out great.  I just baked a few and put the rest in the fridge. I'll probably freeze the rest of the dough to make them fresh.  Thanks for a quick and tasty cookie!

AWESOME !!

Substituted Butter instead of Soybean oil, and, used "Melting Chocolates" (the microwaveable kind) as the icing.

Will DEFINITELY be making these again !!  :)
