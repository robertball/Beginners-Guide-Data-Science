LOVED IT! --yes--I read all 200+ reviews before I made it. The issue with the ammount of broth does depend on the kind of bread you use.  Use less for fresh bread and more for store bought hard packaged. I used the packaged and used all the broth.  I think taking the time to mix it thourghly to absorb the liquid is essential also. I also got the feeling it was on edge of being over cooked,  so I skipped the 45 min high setting and I put the crock pot on Low for 4 hours and it was perfect.

I have not made this particular recipe yet but I have made dressing in a slow cooker. As people will be checking here for Thanksgiving ideas I thought I would give some advice.  Just moisten the dressing at first and add the reserved stock as you go to control the moisutre. Check on it after the first couple hours and peek at it hourly after that. Also, I have read that if you put a cloth kitchen towel over the top and then put the lid on, condensation will be absorbed by the towel.  I think the soggy texture people are experiencing is due to adding too much broth at the beginning and the condensation accumulating on the lid and dripping back down. Add less broth at first and try the towel trick.  And at the end...Too dry? Add more broth.  Too soggy? Cook last 40 minutes uncovered. Happy Thanksgiving to All!!

I think the 4 1/2 c. broth is a misprint. I followed the advice of those who have gone before (and the back of the bread cubes package) and used 2 1/2 cups broth. It was still a little moist for my liking, so I recommend starting with 2 cups broth and adding more as needed. I also cooked and added 1 lb. sage-flavored Jimmy Dean sausage and reduced the amount of sage in the recipe to 1/2 tsp. I got rave reviews from the whole family on Christmas, including my extremely fussy stepdaughter, who had seconds! It also freed up precious oven space. This recipe will feed a LOT of people. Don't try to make this in a small 3 1/2 qt crock pot.

I was nervous to try this and take the chance my stuffing wouldn't turn out on Thanksgiving but just had to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  It was perfect and so easy.  I used about 10 cups of dried, cubed bread from Whole Foods and I also bought a fresh loaf of french bread and added about 3 cups of that.  The french bread has a good consistency and you don't have to worry about drying it out ahead.  I omitted the mushrooms but followed the recipe otherwise as written but added about 2 tsp. minced garlic to the onion celery mixture and added the spices into this mixture while it was cooking before pouring over bread.  DON'T ADD ALL 4-1/2 CUPS CHICKEN BROTH.  Just add enough to moisten the bread because you'll be checking on it all day and can add more as needed.   I cooked it on high for 30 minutes then switched to low for another 5 hours till we were ready to eat.  I stirred about once an hour and added more chicken broth as needed.  By the end I had only added about 2-1/2 or 3 cups total.  I will definitely use this method again.  It's so nice to have one less thing to worry about at the end.  When you are mashing potatoes, baking rolls and making gravy the stuffing is sitting in the crock pot ready to go!

Could this BE any easier?  YES!
Prepare it the day before the feast AND line your pot with a cooking bag!
  
To do this, add all ingredients (in a bowl - not the pot) as directed EXCEPT for the eggs!  Cover and chill the mixture until completely cold in the fridge and THEN add the eggs and mix.  Spoon the mixture into the lined crock pot.  Cover and refrigerate until morning.  The next morning put the crock pot on Low heat and let cook all day.

The only problem was that personally we found the stuffing too wet.  Next time I will reduce the amount of broth to 3 cups.  Before serving, I will add more if I feel it's too dry.

Perfect recipe for a slow cooker or those who are counter constrained.  Used 3.5 cups of broth and it was perfect...  HELPFUL HINT:  Laying a dish towel over the top of the crock and then putting the lid on, helps keep extra moisture out of the stuffing.  Thanks Gayle for a nice addtion to my recipe box!

This recipe is so popular and famous in my family that I have to make at least 2 crock pots of it.  One for Thanksgiving and one for left overs.  

This is a pretty moist stuffing as is.  If you like drier (fluffy) stuffing, use only about 1/2 of the chicken broth.  Also, I've made this with both fresh and dried herbs...and fresh is the WAY TO GO with this.  It tastes so awesome.  If you use fresh herbs double the amount given for the dried as fresh herbs are not as pungent as dried.  It is also imperative that  very stale dried bread is used.  It helps soak up all that broth.  If you use fresh bread it will be very, very soggy, even if you cut the amount of broth in half.  This recipe does not need to be cooked for 8 hours.  Make sure mix up the stuffing every so often so the edges don't form a crust...although some people in my family like it kinda crusty.

Also, the size of the bread cubes matters.  My family likes it best when the cubes are about half an inch by half an inch.  I personally like them bigger.  Don;t make them larger than 1 inch by inch though, otherwise it is much harder to mix up the spices and butter and you will end up with pieces of bread that have no real taste to them.

AWESOME!!!  If you use your common sense this will NOT turn out soggy.  The recipe says 4 1/2 cups of broth OR AS NEEDED DEPENDING ON HOW DRY YOUR BREAD IS.  I did in fact use 1/2 of the broth called for & kept it on low for 4 hours... PERFECT!  Just like it was from the bird, the picky family loved it!  Thanks for making my life simple Gayle!!

This recipe RUINED my first Thanksgiving dinner for the inlaws last week.  4 1/2 cups of broth!!??  I added just 2.5 cups before realizing it was already WAY too much.  It calls for 4.5 cups, then says "add enough to moisten."  I ended up with stuffing soup - totally inedible.  It smelled delicious, but....there has to be some sort of mistake.

This was incredibly good!  Like everyone else, I did have a little trouble with the amount of broth to use.  Here is what I think....if you make your own dried bread, you probably won't need but about 2-2.5 cups.  However, if you use the dried bread cubes from the store that are similar to croutons and very dry, you will have to use more.  I measured 12 cups of the dry cubes bought from the store (plain) and I had to use just over 4 cups. Even after that, some of the bread was crunchy.  I made this for our Thanksgiving pitch-in at work and had to go, so I didn't have time to figure out what else to do.  I threw it in the crock pot and put it on low for 30 minutes while I finished getting ready.  Plugged it in at work and after about 2 hours, it was perfect.  Very moist but not soupy and so far, everyone has loved it! Instead of all the seasoning, I used 4 tsp. poultry seasoning since it has everything in it and about a tsp of salt.  Thanks, Gayle!

To die for! I used the entire 4 1/2 cups of broth. Cooked it for about 5 hours, then realized it was too moist (almost soggy). Took the lid off for the last hour, and it was perfect!! Thanks for the recipe!

I have used this recipe for the past 4 years; I've scaled the recipe up to 25 servings for my office holiday luncheon and scaled it down to 8 servings for meals at home. I have had four years to perfect this recipe, so here are some tips.

This stuffing is very, very moist so use the butter and chicken broth sparingly.

1 cup of butter is 2 sticks - I only use 1 stick for 25 servings (two sticks left a butter layer across the top).

Also, I use only enough broth to just moisten the bread - I used the stated amount one year and ended up with stuffing soup (which everyone still said tasted wonderful).

If I use mushrooms, I use canned. I have omitted the mushrooms and added shredded carrots that I cooked with the onions, etc. I also shred the celery.

I omit the marjoram and add rosemary.

Handling such a large amount of bread cubes can be unwieldy, so I put half of the bread directly into the slowcooker, follow the directions in Step 2 using half of all the ingredients, moisten with a just enough broth, and toss lightly.  Then I do the same thing with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl, which I then combine with the other half in the slowcooker.

Like some others, I only needed to cook this about 45 minutes on high and 3-4 hours on low.

All-in-all a very nice recipe that I was able to easily change to fit my tastes. When I take this to my office luncheon, there is never any left to take home!

Excellent recipe!  Only changes I made were that I added all the spices to the onions and butter...mom taught me that many years ago...makes it easier to get the flavours all through the stuffing.  I also finely chopped the mushrooms, so that we had the flavour, but they were disguised for the kids!  Only used 2 cups of broth and cooked for about 5 1/2 hours, stirring three times to prevent sticking.  All raved, thanks!

I make this every year at Thanksgiving.  My family just LOVES it because it doesn't turn out mushy like most stuffing recipes. Because I am so busy on Turkey day I've started to do a "make ahead" version of this.  The night before Thanksgiving I put the bread cubes into a huge mixing bowl then I brown up some pork sausage and throw it on top of the bread cubes.  Then I melt the butter in the same fry pan and cook the onions, celery, mushrooms and parsley.  I put that on top of the bread cubes and mix in all the spices and about a half cup of dried cranberries.  I cover the bowl and keep it cold overnight.  In the morning I grease the crock, chop up an apple and mix it in along with the eggs.  I only use the chicken broth as needed, so it doesn't get too mushy.  Then I put it in the crock on high for an hour and then turn it to low until lunch.  Turns out perfect every time and I don't have to get up super early to cut up and saute the veggies.  We do a deep-fried turkey, so is just a wonderful recipe for us.

Would have added more stars if an option!  Awesome recipe.  Made this last thanksgiving and my father-in-law (a foodie) is still talking about it!  It was wonderful and all the prep work can be done the day before--just open tupperware that morning, add eggs and broth and mix.  Used Baby Bella mushrooms and think it added a wonderful flavor.  Am already assigned stuffing for this Thanksgiving.

For those making this for Thanksgiving 2011...Stir every hour/hour and a half, so the bottom doesn't scorch, and if you are concerned about it getting mushy, put a clean tea towel across the top before putting the lid on, and change it when it gets too damp. Condensation will form on the lid, and drip on top of the stuffing while cooking. If you put the towel on top, it absorbs the moisture! This is a trick I found in one of the reviews!

I tried this recipe last year and it was a big  hit.  The folks who ended up with soupy dressing must be new to cooking or something.  It clearly says to add just enough broth to  moisten at the beginning.  I also think that the consistency may have something to do with the surface area of your slow cooker.  This comes out better when I cook it in my oval cooker, rather than my deeper round one.  I also crack the lid about half way for the llast hour of cooking. I use dried cubes from the bag and it works great every time.  By adding a drizzel of broth as needed throughout the cooking process it turns out perfect every time.  Have made this recipe a dozen times over the last year and it is great every time.  I have modified it with some ingredient changes for the holidays.  We hate mushrooms at my house, so leave them out entirely.  I add a pound of browned sage sausage, and a cup of dried cranberries.  Replace the save witrh two t. poultry seasoning and add about a t. of fresh ground pepper.  I sometimes use vegetable stock instead of chick, but that just depends on what's in the pantry.  Also a wierd addition to some folks, but a standard for years in my WASP household--two cans of water chestnuts- diced fine.  They keep their crunch even after the other veggies have lost theirs.  Try it--they're delicious in this.

I've made my stuffing this way for years.  If you periodically add some drippings from the turkey, this will come out tasting EXACTLY like it was made inside the bird!

This stuffing is REALLY good.  I had to add more bread though because it calls for too much broth...would be gooey.  Next time I'll start with less broth.  Also, I would decrease the salt to one tsp..was a tad too salty.

This was a fantastic alternative to in-the-bird stuffing, and it tasted great! Five stars for saving space in my oven, but just four overall because I thought it needed a couple of adjustments: 

I omitted the eggs entirely. I just didn't think the stuffing needed it, and it tasted and looked perfectly good without. 

I started with about 2 cups of chicken broth, and added some drippings from my turkey as it cooked. Make sure you mix the stuffing thoroughly each time you do this.

For those of you who want to also save time on Turkey Day, I took care of steps 1 and 2 the night before, and put the crock pot into the fridge overnight. Pulled it out and plugged it in mid-afternoon the next day, and it was perfect with our meal after 4 hours on low.

OMG.. This came out AWESOME! Here's what I did... I bought the Pepperidge Farm country style bread crumbs and since that is alredy seasoned I reduced spices in half. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the onions and celery and I used olive oil instead of butter for cooking. I also added one package of cooked Italian breakfast sausage (removed from casings). Other than that everything else was the same... We personally I liked the soggy, sticky type of stuffing so I didn't mind that at all and used all the broth the recipe called for. Next time the only thing different I would do is not to add the salt b/c it was alittle salty but other than that it cooked in the crock pot for 5 hours and it was even starting to get alittle crunchy along the sides so I shut it off, put the towel over the top before I put the lid back on and shut it off and it stayed perfectly warm for over an hour till I was ready to serve it for dinner. Everyone raved about how great it tasted and I LOVED using the crock pot to make this. I'm definatly doing it this way from now on! THANKS!

I made this for Christmas dinner this year, and it was awesome. I made it pretty much as presented here with some minor exceptions. I added a pan of Jiffy cornbread, crumbled. A little cornbread really does contribute to a wonderful texture. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onion/celery mixture for about 30 seconds at the end of the sauteeing process. I omitted the mushrooms because they are not universally accepted in my family. I used the entire amount of broth. I needed it because the bread cubes I used were store bought, and they were brick hard. I also suggest that you omit the salt from the recipe if the chicken broth you use is not the salt-free type. (I couldn't find the no-salt kind.) I suggest you taste the mixture before adding the eggs to see if any of the seasonings need to be corrected.
 
One major thing I did was that I only used 1-1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2. Then 1/2 hour or so before serving, I drizzled some pan drippings from the turkey over the top. That really added a special flavor. I do the same thing to stuffing that I cook in a casserole dish in the oven.

Great!  Finally a stuffing you can make out of the turkey that is moist.  I used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the other stuff and because of the mushroom 'sweat' I used only 1 and 1/4 cans of broth and it was perfect (and my bread cubes were very dry).  I also added three chopped apples about 1 hour before serving and it was great - also only cooked for 4 hrs on low and it was great (added a bit of broth after about 3 hrs to keep the sides from crusting).

GREAT STUFFING.

This was an awesome recipe. This was the first time that I had ever tried to make stuffing that wasn't in a box. I was really nervous because I new I had 30 people showing up for dinner and didn't know if it was going to turn out. The outcome was great, everyone loved it. I doubled it up to 32 servings. I also omitted the mushrooms but added pork sausage. I also used 7 cups of chicken both instead of 9.  I prepared it all the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator over night. The next morning I got up and put it on. However, I do recommend only cooking it for 4 hours instead of 8. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is wanting a stuffing recipe that is great.

AWESOME DRESSING.  It got rave reviews even as leftovers the next day. This was the first time I used this recipe and based on the reviews I made some minor adjustments.  I sautéd the veggies with the butter the night before then refrigerated the mixture.  In the morning I just microwaved it to liquify the butter for about 2 1/2 minutes.  I'm not an onion lover so I only used about 1 cup of onions and I also used fresh sage and thyme and doubled the amounts of both.  I had 4 1/2 cups of broth on hand but only added about 2 1/2 to start then after about an hour I began adding extra to keep it moist with the end total broth used being about 3 1/2 cups.  My slow cooker seemes to be really hot even on low so I didn't do the 45 min on high setting. It took only about 4 1/2 hours to cook so I set my slow cooker to warm for 2 hours until dinner was ready. All in all it was so simple and tasted really great.

What a hit! I had never made stuffing in my life, and decided to do it in my slow cooker so I didn't have to worry about it messing with my turkey cook time (or fitting - we had a tiny turkey). I left out the mushrooms due to family preferences, and "enough broth to just moisten" was only about 2 or 3 cups. I cooked on high for about 30 minutes, then low for about 4-5 hours. The consistency/texture was great, but the bottom of the cooker scorched, so next time I might stir partway through. *EDIT: stirring helps the scorch problem, and this recipe is now REQUIRED for all of my family holiday get-togethers

AWESOME RECIPE! 

I cut back on the broth, too. I merely moistened my stuffing, and added  touches of broth as I went along. I was procrastinating & saved this recipe for the very end.  I wound up putting it in the Crock pot on high for 2 1/2 hours. The end result was moist (but not too mushy) and flavorful--with a slight crust on the bottom, as if it had been in the oven. (BTW- I couldn't imagine it being on low for four hours--way too long, in my opinion. Cut the time in half, as I did.) And stop scratching your heads over the bread cubes..I used 2 bags of Pepperidge Farm preseasoned stuffing , which complimented theherbs & spices in the recipe. 

I got great compliments on this dish, and it tasted better the day after. I will do my stuffing like this from now on. It's a space & time saver. Thanks for sharing.

The best part of the meal! I thought I was making enough for left overs but it was all gone. I made it in the oven like the note on the bottom of the recipe suggested and it turned out fantastic. I did cover with tin foil 'cause I thought it may dry out. I definately recomend this to anyone who loves dressing. Nothing in a box could possibly compare to this.

What a great way to make stuffing. I prepared this the night before and put it on when I woke up the next morning. The stuffing was nice and moist and very flavorful. Everybody couldn't wait to try it! Thanks for the great recipe Gayle!

I'm the only one allowed to make stuffing in our family & for the last few years this is the only stuffing I've been allowed to bring! I buy my french bread loaves on the weekend & cube 'em up & let them dry out for the next few days (I usually use all white). I always use fresh parsely, thyme & sage (triple the amount, I'd use fresh marjoram too if  I had it), & DO NOT add all the broth at once (I use turkey stock I make with the giblets & neck, tastes like stuffing from the bird). Don't forget that condensation will form & baste the stuffing as if it were inside the turkey so, to start just add enough to moisten & keep checking it once in awhile, adding more if needed. (If you accidentally add too much liquid, simply uncover the pot for awhile and/or add some dry bread cubes).
I usually include the neck meat and/or giblets, & I've added sausage, I've added dried cranberries, extra fresh sage, a mixture of white/sourdough or white/wheat - always a hit, not to mention a super time & oven space saver!

This was great!  Am planning to use this recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  I didn't believe a slow cooker could do the job, but apparently it can.  I only used 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter as opposed to an entire cup.  Did not use mushrooms because my family is not a big fan and I only needed 2 cups of broth.  Cooked on high for 45 minutes like stated and then 4 additional hours on low.  For the last hour I removed the lid as one of the reviewers had advised.  I recommend this to everyone who complained about their stuffing being too mushy.  Removing the lid for the last hour allows some of the moisture to evaporate.  I thought it turned out perfect!  And just to note I did use dry bread cubes that I made myself.

This is so easy, to make and to carry along.This is my dish to bring to Holiday dinners.  Not all the family appreciates a good stuffing, but we love it.  It works well when you make it in 1/2 too!!

I found this recipe to be EXCELLENT and a way to make a flavorful stuffing without actually stuffing the turkey with it. After reading many reviews I, too, placed a kitchen towel under the lid to catch the condensation. Totally common sense, people, to use only enough stock to "moisten". I grabbed a handful of the stuffing and squished. If it (barely) held together then I was moist enough to me. I ended up using about 3 cups of broth, I used the stock left after simmering the neck and giblets that my husband likes to snack on. I think that made it taste even more like it came with the bird! My stuffing was done after about 5 hours and I uncovered the cooker and left it on warm while the rest of dinner was finished. Finally, I just could not bring myself to use an entire cup of butter! I reduced it to 1/2 cup with excellent results. My entire family loved it! Thanks for the recipe!PS: I hope the reviewer from 2001 (KRIS&PJ) who said it ruined his/her first Thanksgiving gave it another try after reading more reviews ;)

I have made this twice now. Once in a slowcooker and once in a baking dish. The trick is determining how much liquid you need in ratio to how moist your bread is. I've noticed that once you have standing broth that hasn't been sucked up even though you stirred it than you have too much. You want it just saturated and no more. I've made a lot of different stuffings and I think that it just takes practice. Just remember to add a little at a time. It is easier to add if it is too dry than to take away.

The key to success (delicious success) is to use very dry bread cubes. If they are fresh or just barely dry, this will become a soggy mess in your crockpot. So, either buy the very dry cubed type in a bag OR cube your own bread and let dry out for a couple days on your countertop. (Spread out on some cookie sheets, cover lightly and toss every few hours to distribute the still moist bread cubes with the dry ones. Or place in the oven at a very low temp and let dry out that way for an hour or so.) Then add the liquid using common sense and also taking into consideration your family's preference on the moistness of the stuffing. If they like it very moist, add more, if less moist then add less. Remember, you can always add more as you are cooking this in the crockpot but you can't take it out, so err on the side of too little and then keep checking. I also cook this for 3-4 hours on low and it comes out perfect every time. You can get great results with this recipe if you just use these tips. Also, use the herbs that your family loves if the ones stated don't suit your tastes. :)

I will never make stuffing any other way ever again! It tasted just like it came out of the bird! I used 1 1/2 packages of peperidge farm stuffing (not the cubed kind) and a tad more than half of a 32 oz box of turkey stock. Because I used packaged stuffing I skipped the salt completely. I used fresh sage, thyme, and parsley for my herbs. Everything else I kept the same. I do not recommend skipping the eggs they definitely made a difference. Everyone thinking of trying this recipe must try it. I do agree with everyone else that 4 1/2 cups of stock is too much.

Although other reviewers found this watery, mine was a bit dry, and I used almost the full amount of (veg) broth. It could be because I used only half the fat (butter + olive oil), or because I used very hearty bread (three types: rosemary, rustic farmer's, and rye). Mine burned on the bottom, even though I followed the temp/time directions exactly. I used all fresh herbs, and the flavor was nice. I'll probably try this again next year and tweak it slightly. It's a pity some reviewers found the need to be so snarky. If your Christmas was "ruined" by this stuffing, you've got far bigger problems than just bad food.

Crock pot convenience is a genius idea.  I substituted browned sausage for the mushrooms (my family won't eat them), otherwise made exactly as submitted.  I chopped and sauteed everything ahead of time, travelled with the wet ingredients separate from the bread, combined it all at Grandma's house.  Heeding the advice of another reviewer, I removed the lid for the last hour to reduce the moisture to my liking.  Next time I would: make my own bread cubes instead of using packaged, start with less than the 4 C. Chicken Stock I used this time,  throw in a handful of walunts, and maybe add some chopped apple.  This got a lot of raves.  There will definitely be a 'next time' and I'll definitely stick with the crock pot.

SO good! I was eating it out of the bowl after I had tossed the onions/butter/spices/bread together!  Prepare all the night before and toss in the egg and broth the next morning and turn on the slow cooker! I definitely plan to make this again!

I'm a nervous hostess and am having Thanksgiving at my house this year so I wanted to try out this recipe ahead of time.  I took everyone's advice and only used a little bit of broth, and added as needed.  I made it with Martin's potato bread cubes and left out the mushrooms.  It was SO GOOD!  I halved the recipe b/c I read that it serves a ton of people . . .  I had 3 hungry adults for dinner, and we polished it off (everyone loved it and had huge servings, and seconds).  Also I followed the advice of others that went before me and only cooked it on low for 4 hours, checking periodically to add broth and stir.  I'm glad I did b/c at times it was starting to stick to the sides and I could have seen it burning if I wasn't paying attention.  But great, great, recipe!

I haven't tried this yet (plan to make it for the football game!), but, I just wanted to mention something-everyone says 4 1/2 c. broth is too much. If you will read the recipe-it says '4 1/2 c. OR AS NEEDED'! That means, you can use from a drop to 4 1/2 c. Just wanted to let you all know.

This is a FABULOUS recipe!  I used pre-packaged bread cubes, omitted the sliced mushrooms, and added raisins to the stuffing the last hour of cooking.  I added about two cups of chicken broth initially, and then added about 1/2 cup additional broth about every hour until the stuffing was done.  I ended up using about 4 cups of broth, and the stuffing was perfect - not too mushy, not too dry.  I cooked the stuffing on low for four hours.  My husband and daughter, who do not care for stuffing, LOVED this and had seconds!  This recipe is my Thanksgiving Stuffing recipe from now on!  Thank you!

It's turkey time again and I had to come back for this recipe! It was a hit last year and so convenient to have it tucked away on the counter top and not taking up so much space in the oven. The measurements were good for me. I did take the lid off for the last 30 minutes of cook time to dry out the stuffing a little. Not too moist, not too dry- it was perfect! Added minced garlic as well. This is fabulous!

After reading all the negative reviews on here referring to the amount of broth, I had to post.  I used two bags (which totalled 12 cups) store-bought stuffing -- one cubed white bread and one almost-powdered cornbread.  Even though the stuffing was pre-seasoned, I used the same amount of spices that the recipe called for.  I omitted the mushrooms, because we don't care for them.  I used 5 cups broth, dumped in all at the beginning.  I used a 5 qt. crockpot with a crockpot bag to avoid a messy clean up, and put a paper towel on top of the crockpot under the lid.  I opened the crockpot twice while cooking it on low for 6 hrs., but did not stir.  A few minutes before serving, I ladled about 3/4 cup turkey drippings onto the top of the stuffing while still in the crockpot.  Guests served themselves from the crockpot, and I got nothing but wonderful reviews for the texture, the moistness, and the taste.  It wasn't a mushy paste, it was perfectly spiced, and it did not burn onto the sides of the bag inside the crock.  All in all, it was a wonderful recipe, and I'll be making my stuffing this way every year!  Thanks, Gayle, for freeing up some of my oven space!

Fantastic!  I made my own bread cubes by cutting bread into half-inch squares and baking them in a 300 degree oven for 15 minutes, stirring twice.  I added only 2 cups of broth and added another 1/2 cup while it cooked.  I cooked for 4 hours on low, which was perfect.  Also, I halved the amount of butter called for with no problems.  Finally, I used 1/4 cup dried minced onions since I used my last onion in another dish.  This is a keeper.

I didn't read all the reviews, so this may already be in there somewhere, but this is even easier if you use a cooking bag inside of the crock pot.

I made this stuffing for a group of friends...I put in 3 cups of chicken broth, but could have used another half cup. (I like my stuffing moist)  I also omitted the mushrooms and added a pound of Bob Evans Sage country sausage and cooked it in the crock pot for 6 hours.  The result was fabulous!  My friends ate every bite and are already asking me to cook again. Thanks Gayle!

The idea of making stuffing in the crockpot is a Godsend! I made this for Thanksgiving with "World's Best Turkey" recipe (also on allrecipes.com) and it was wonderful. Used croutons instead of torn bread. I agree that 4.5 cups of broth is too much. I used less and it 
tasted fine. Next time I will only cook it on low 
for 4 hours at the most. I left in on for 6 and 
it stuck to the sides of my crockpot! Loved the recipe, though!

Excellent. I doubled the recipe to serve 16. I used 3 14.5 oz cans of chicken broth, 3 boxes of Mrs. Cubbisons seasoned stuffing and omitted the mushrooms (our choice). If you double this recipe, omit the 1 Tbl. of salt the recipe calls for as this makes the stuffing too salty. My mother who has been making stuffing for over 35 yrs told me this recipe is better than hers. What a compliment! Depending on how long you slow cook this recipe, the sides get golden brown and it was so moist and tasty. I highly recommend this recipe. Using the slow cooker saves oven space and I will not make my stuffing any other way in the future.

This recipe was great for many reasons!  I was cooking for 25 guests for Easter dinner.  It helped because it saved valuable space in the oven.  I got lots of compliments on this stuffing.  A few helpful hints; 1)  Make sure that you grease the crockpot before you put the stuffing in 2)  Stir the stuffing every 30 mins - 1 hour or your stuffing might burn at the bottom 3)  Add just enough broth at the beginning to get the mixture moist and then add small amounts when you check it and stir it.  You want to make sure it doesn't get too soggy.  You can always add broth, but can't take it out;)  One other thing..... My crockpot is a really hot one for some reason, so I just started it on low and cooked it for 4 hours.  Thank you, I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

The first time I saw this recipe I read all the reviews and no you don't need 4 cups of chicken broth. 1 can is plenty. I cooked in the slow cooker exactly as shown and found that it burnt a bit on the sides. Everyone still loved it. I cooked it again on Thanksgiving and didn't cook on high at all. I cooked for about 4 hours on low and stired it about 3 times during cooking. Didn't burn on the sides. This is an awsome recipe. This was the first homemade stuffing recipe I have made and it will be my last.

What a great time saver!!!  I thought this tasted just like it came from the bird.  Again, to reiterate on the amount of broth.  You will not nearly need 4.5 cups unless your bread is like cardboard.  Mine was slightly stale and I started with 2 cups and that was fine, probably could have done a little less.  If you follow the directions it does not say to add the entire 4.5 cups of broth, it has that as a maximum.  I omitted the mushrooms for the sake of those who do not like them, but i did add a little minced garlic to the onion/celery mixture.  Seasoning mixture was great!  I cooked this on low for 4 hours, and for the last half hour we took the lid off to allow the topping to crisp up a bit and to allow the bread to soak up the excess moisture.  This fed 13 people with leftovers and everyone loved it.  I will use this recipe from now on - awesome not to have one more thing to worry about when to put in the oven!  I will follow someone else's advice and mash the potatoes early and put them in another crockpot to keep warm.  The less you do right before dinner, the better!

I've been making this stuffing for a few years now...I like it cause it makes alot and tastes great. I have never had a complaint and am always asked to do the stuffing.
Everyone is commenting on the amount of liquid it calls for. Well I usually mix it all in a large roasting pan then transfer it to the crockpot. After it has been cooking awhile it shrinks down.
If it is then still too moist I add more breadcubes and extra seasonings to suck up the moisture..
This way you end up with a little more stuffing and leftovers are great!

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was the BEST stuffing I have ever had!  A word of caution, if you are making it in the slow cooker, use less liquid, since the slow cooker keeps it very moist and you don't want mushy stuffing.

I have made this stuffing 3 years in a row with excellent results. I make this veggie  friendly by changing the chicken broth to veggie stock, I use a high quality store bought brand. I adjust the amount of stock I use as I cook this dish. I usually add enough to moisten everything and then check it and add more as needed. Every year I have used a different amount of liquid. I buy bread from the bakery and cut it up, usually a wheat and white bread. I leave the cubes out over night to get stale, I put the cut up bread on cookie sheets and leave them in a turned off oven. I cut back on the salt to about 1 tsp. adding more if needed. I cut back on the butter to about 1/2 cup and I omit the mushrooms since not everyone likes them. To save even more time, I buy pre cut bags of onion and celery at the store.

This was a real hit on Thanksgiving!!  It saved so much time, put in the crock pot in the morning and it was done with the turkey.  I thought that the range in time was a bit wide.  I found that 45 ninutes on high and 5 hours on low was just right.  I used prepared, dry, unseasoned bread cubes and added the entire 4.5 cups of liquid.  This turned out perfect.  Much fluffier than the traditional cooking method.  Will definately make again.  Such a time saver.

PERFECT! Okay, I made this last night and it turned out ideal. I used 2 1/2 cups of the chicken broth (the 98% fat free kind). The bread cubes I used came in a bag and were by Home Pride. (I'm sure the type of bread you use will determine the amount of broth you will need). I made this as a trial run before making it agian for a work pot-luck next week. I won't be changing a thing! This one's a keeper! The crock-pot idea is brilliant.

This is truely my grandma's stuffing--only in a crock pot.  I tried for several years to make "grandma's stuffing".  Her recipe was "a bit of this, a bit of that & until it looks like enough".  I remembered how it tasted & just could not find the right one.  After many attempts, I found this exact recipe in a slow cooker recipe book many many years ago.  The 1st time I tried it, my mom took 1 bite & asked me how I got grandma's recipe.  BINGO!  After I heard Julia say that "if you salt the bird in the cavity as much as you should, you could never eat the stuffing."  My kind of cook!.  Hated dealing with the bird & stuffing!  My son-in-law comes in Thanksgiving morning sniffing & says "YES!  It is Thanksgiving!"  But you must use REAL butter & don't skimp.  We only make it once a year, so we just go for it!

this was a disaster.  I thought this would be a great option to take to my company potluck and actually keep the stuffing warm.  i read the reviews prior and made changes per suggestions but it was a total mess.  I left out the mushrooms and cut back on the liquid but it was still mushy on the inside and completely unappetizing to look at from the outside.  I won't waste time trying this one again.

This is a moist, delicious stuffing and it is very helpful using a slow cooker.  I use a mixture of wheat, rye, white and sour dough bread.  I tear up the bread into pieces the night before and let it sit out over night.

I loved this!  I didn't change anything, except I left out the mushrooms (forgot them at the store).  I used Pepperidge Farm Cornbread Stuffing Mix (used two and a half bags), and I did use 4 cups of broth (Swanson Chicken Broth).  I followed the recipe suggestion and cooked for 45 min. on high, then turned it down to low.  It only took mine about 3 to 4 hours total.  Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!!  I LOVE this recipe.  I had never thought to cook stuffing in the crock pot but don't think I will ever do it any other way.  Beware not to over soak the stuffing. You lose very little liquid in the crockpot.  This recipe is also very adaptable depending on your personal taste.  I am already planning on making this again for Easter.  Thanks for the new tradition Gayle!

This is the exact same recipe that is in my little recipe book that came with my crockpot back in 1983 (I still have both pot & book).  The only difference is mine calls for 2 - 2 1/2 c broth & 4oz less mushrooms.  I guess each ingredient would be a personal preference.  I have used this recipe many times over the years and have only received positive feedback so it's worked for me thus far.

This is more for the method of cooking than the actual recipe as my stuffing recipe is NEVER the same twice.  Love cooking stuffing in the crock pot.  I spray the crock well; remember to stir every 1.5 to 2 hours as my crock will get 'hot spots' and will overbrown.  I've made stuffing a day or two ahead of time, put in refrigerator, day of cooking, set out for about an hour and then cook.  Perfect every time!  Enjoy!

Made this for Christmas Dinner and everyone devoured it.  I cooked and added 1# of Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage to the mixture and then left out the Sage Seasoning.  I also only used 2 Cans of the Chicken Broth.  It's the only way I'll serve stuffing from now on.  So easy!

I have made this several times and I LOVE it. You MUST reduce the chicken broth to 2 1/2 cups or until just moistened.

I loved this recipe and I am very particular with my stuffing!  I always hate it when folks add sausage and cornbread type things to stuffing.  This was great-better than the kind in a box.  I must admit I used all kinds of bread from wheat to hot dog buns.  As my guest list grew I added more broth and bread eventually filling a large oval crock pot.  I then transfered to a baking dish and topped off in the oven to give it a crust.  It was so good!  Thanks for sharing.
Updated 2017- this remains our recipe for every Thanksgiving.  Finish in the oven or make into stuffing balls

OHMIGOSH! I'm so happy to have found this recipe. Had 18 people coming for Thanksgiving dinner last week so even with 2 ovens I needed room to spare to heat food. Tried this recipe out on my husband first and he loved it, so made 2 batches for guests. Everyone raved about it on T-Day; compliments are stillcoming in and copies of the recipe are still being handed out. By the way, I hate onions, but this was delicious! Also, I substituted one bag each of ready-made cornbread stuffing cubes and homestyle stuffing bread cubes rather than toasting the bread myself.

This recipe is great!  I brought it to my German In-Law's house for Thanksgiving and they loved it!!  The ingredients are spot on.  I couldn't stay away from it while it was cooking and kept picking at it.  There was almost none left after we all had dinner.  Everybody loves stuffing and this frees up the oven for extra outside the bird!

My Grandma has been making this stuffing for probably the better part of 30 years... It came out of her crock pot recipe book.   She does use less liquid than the recipe calls for... It's really a thing you have to 'feel' for yourself. I've made it once or twice to the same perfection that she does and it's awesome! Can't wait until Thursday... I can already taste it!   THIS is what comfort food is all about!

This is a great stuffing recipe, I've used it the past 2 years and my sister says this is better than my mom's (and that is BIG!).  Just a note, the amount of broth depends on how much bread and what type you use (use less for fresh bread and more for store bought packaged hard bread).  I use a mixture of different types of fresh breads (rye, grainy, sourdough, etc.) that I dry out for a couple days beforehand.  Also, do not add all the broth at once, keep it handly and add it as needed as the stuffing cooks.  I also cook and add 1 lb sage- flavored sausage and then reduce the amt of sage in the recipe by 1/2 or more.  Watch your slow cooker timing too, with my cooker (which tends to cook everything faster than called for) I only need to cook the stuffing on high for 45 min, then low for 2-4 hours.  This is a delicious recipe, you will not be disappointed!  Thanks, Gayle!

This was my first time making any type of stuffing and it turned out awesome!! I'd only used about 2 cups of stock like everyone said and checked it about every hour or so and added more stock if I needed it. But it was done in like 4 hours.

I've made this recipe for the last 2 years for family thanksgiving dinner as a substitute for the "in the bird' stuff we grew up with.  My version follows the recipe scaled down for 9 servings except for these changes: Use 10 cups stuffing mix (about 1 and 2/3  14 oz bags of Pepperidge Farm herb seasoned stuffing mix -blue label bag) and three 10.75 oz cans of Swanson's low salt chicken broth to the mix & add another 1/2 can or so during cooking to get consistency desired. I stir the mix during cooking a few times, maybe hourly. Add 1.5-2 cups each of diced celery and onions, sauteed in butter, to mix. Use 2 large eggs. Mix it all up the night before & refrigerate in covered Pam-sprayed 6 qt slow cooker. Cook on high for 45 min, then 4 hrs on low, then warm for 2-3 hours (it got done faster than I expected, but held well on warm, just got a tiny bit crispier on the very edges). Lovely bits of crusty stuff around the edges that we all liked a lot. It was too salty the first year, so eliminated the salt and went to the low salt broth, which makes it perfect. I use salted butter, which provided enough salt for my taste. Can't wait to try adding in cooked sage sausage and some dried cranberries this year!

Everyone loved this stuffing. I have a smaller slow cooker so I cut the recipe in half. If you do this, one bag of store bought bread cubes works beautifully. I had a 8oz pkg. of mushrooms, and just used them all (as opposed to the 6oz halving it called for). Added broth just till moistened (just like directions say!), and then carefully stirred in more broth, as needed, a couple of times during cooking process. The stuffing was perfect. It was so good I am going to use this method from now on.

This stuffing was to die for. We fried our turkey this year so there was no drippings and no stuffing the bird. It was so moist and tasted better than my mom's stuffing. I did add a pound of sage sausage and then cut the sage in half. I still found that the stuffing had a little too much sage for my taste. Next time I won't add the sage. I only added a little chicken broth and then as needed. I used 6.5 cups torn french bread, 6.5 cups of seasoned croutons and then because I thought the sage was a tad over powering, I used a bag of Stove Top. This is a keeper for sure. I'll make it again for Christmas. We had no left-overs. Thank you thank you for a wonderful Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about the stuffing.

Wow!  I used the driest bread possible (a year old) and the liquid was waaaaaaay too much.  Mine too was a soup.  I tried drying it out in the oven but by that time it was all mush - couldn't tell the difference between the bread and the other ingredients.  I'll stick with my family's trusty recipe and bake my stuffing in the oven.

I will never use another recipe for my stuffing. This was the very best stuffing I have ever made or eaten in all my 50 plus years. I went right by the recipe and it was wonderful. Everyone wanted more and more...Thank you so very much for making this old Native American's life alot easier**********

My daughter said this was her favorite dish at our Thanksgiving dinner this year, and my mother said it made the best leftovers.  I took advantage of the tips offered by previous reviews.  I used one very long loaf of sourdough French bread and one sliced loaf of pumpernickel bread.  I cubed them and left them spread on cookie sheets for 2 days; therefore, I did not need to dry them in the oven before using them.  I added a pound of Jimmy Dean sage sausage and omitted the dried sage.  I sauteed the vegetables and fried the sausage the night before.  On Thanksgiving morning I warmed them in the microwave before assembing the recipe.  I added the broth gradually and ended up using 2 cans (4 cups).  I did cook on high for 45 minutes then on low for 4 hours.  I think my family will require me to make this every Thanksgiving from now on.  If you like the flavor of sage, you will love this recipe.

My family loves stuffing right from the turkey, but we have a couple of friends that are vegetarians so I cook this for them as well. I leave out the eggs so it will be more like the kind out of the turkey and I add more water or vegetable stock as needed when it starts to get dry.

Wow!  This stuffing was great!  I did make a few changes though: added about 1/2 cup of jimmy dean sage sausage, only used 3 cups chicken broth and left out the mushrooms.  Cooked at high for 45 minutes then reduced the temp to low and continued cooking for about 3 to 3-1/2 hours or so.  Since my family enjoys the crispy parts of the stuffing I took a large sized cupcake pan and added a couple of ice cream scoops of the stuffing to each  and baked at 375 degrees for 10-15 minutes (depending on how crispy you like them).  They were a HUGE hit and I will be making them again and again, I've already been instructed to make a double batch for xmas!  Having the oven free was another huge bonus!  We did have a couple of "cups" left over and they reheated beautifully!  Thanks Gayle, definitely a keeper!

This is very good. I cut the recipe in half and there was more than plenty for 4 people. I used seasoned chicken broth. Which by the way I only used maybe 1 and a 1/2 cans. I also didn't have sage, but I'm glad I didn't because that would have made it too sagie. I will definately make this again. Thanks

Have used this recipe for the past 5 Thanksgivings.  Very easy to prepare and everyone has enjoyed it.  I brown a pound of sausage and add it to the bread cubes before putting it into the slow cooker

This is absolutely the best stuffing I have ever made or eaten.  I have never been 
a big fan of stuffing but this was so moist and flavorful that it was my favorite left-
over!  I can't eat onions so I left them out, added more mushrooms and cut down
on the broth a bit.  My Thanksgiving guests said it was the best stuffing they ever
had, and they had no idea that it wasn't in the turkey!  A definate keeper!!!

I have been using this exact recipe for years (minus mushrooms for personal taste, and I do not use a cup of butter.... I use a few Tbls of margarine and some grapeseed oil mixed to be healthier). I love it! As others have said, the amount of broth needed depends on your bread. I always use fresh french bread that I cube the night before and leave out overnight to slightly dry. I probably use about 3-3.5 cups of broth. However, using store bought cubes which are much more dry may need more broth as this recipe calls for. It also depends on how moist you prefer your stuffing to be. This is as close to "in the bird stuffing" as I've ever found because it does remain moist and does not dry out. I have always received compliments on this homemade stuffing. Quite yummy!

Made this for a big Thanksgiving crowd.  The recipe scaled up nicely & I was able to take care of some of it in advance.  I cooked up step one the day before and finished it off the morning of the big meal.  I also used vegetable stock to accommodate a vegetarian friend.
BEWARE, though!  It definitely does NOT need as much broth as called for!  I did a little less than half and it was still a bit soggy after the allotted time.  
Best thing we came up with was to partially uncover the cooker and turn it back up to high (stirring occasionally) until it dried out a bit.  Ultimately, it turned out great, saved me some oven space, and people enjoyed it.  Just beware of too much broth!

This has been my favorite stuffing recipe for several years...ever since I first saw it here.  The first year I made it, it did turn out too soggy because I misjudged the amount of broth but I simply added a little bit of dry Stove Top that I had on hand and, within a few minutes, it was perfect.  I love being able to put it together the night before and then add the eggs and broth in the morning and pop it in the crock pot.  No more stressing about stuffing.

This was such a wonderful, easy stuffing recipe that I made for Thanksgiving. It saved space in my oven for other specialty dishes and the flavor came & moistness came out perfect in the slow cooker! This is now my new way of making great stuffing! Thanks!

I have used a recipe very similar to this for years. It is always a hit! I see that most people have issues with the 4 1/2 cups chicken broth. Mostly I  use 4 cups of it, and it is always a little dry (the way my family likes it). If you like stuffing that is moist (my favorite), DEFINITELY USE ALL 4 1/2 CUPS.  The KEY to this recipe is DRY BREAD CUBES. I usually cut up an entire loaf of bread (not sure how many cups that is) and bake it for 20 minutes or until crisp. Then you add it to all the other ingredients (which have already been mixed in a separate bowl). The bread soaks the 4+ cups of broth perfectly. I have never had soupy stuffing when I do it this way. I have also never sauteed my veggies in butter. Mine soften up within the stuffing as it bakes.Generally, I add my bread last or else the seasonings are not proportionate throughout. Another tip if you don't keep lots of seasonings on hand, buy a box of stuffing mix at the store. This can replace all the seasonings. Just add your bread cubes, onion, celery, broth, and eggs. Overall, it is the perfect recipe just the way it is posted.

Very good!  Followed directions almost to a T.  Amt of broth used depends on the type of  bread cubes you are using and how dry or wet you like your stuffing.

Made this using 1/2 stick of butter, combined 1/2 package of both Pepperidge Farm cornbread and herb seasoned stuffing, 2 cups vegetable broth instead of chicken, and 3 TB fresh sage, finely chopped, and fresh thyme, 2 TB along with other ingredients as listed. Cooked 4 hrs and stirred every 1 1/2 hrs to keep the crust from forming and monitor the liquid. It turned out light and full of flavor.  Loved using the slow cooker which helped free up the oven.  Enjoyed by all.

I made this stuffing for a playgroup Thanksgiving party and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I was looking for something easy to make that would work well in a pot-luck situation and this was just the thing.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I was out of sage so I added a little extra poultry seasoning.  I also finely chopped the mushrooms and onions(in hopes of hiding them from picky kids-as this was made for a PLAYGROUP).  I used the dried breadcubes for stuffing that are usually on the shelf by the Stovetop;) and it took the full ammount of chicken broth suggested-about 4cups.  Yummy-easy-will deff. use this recipe again!  THANX!

This stuffing was great!  I made my own bread cubes with sourdough and dark rye bread & basted with turkey juices to keep it moist, hubby swears it has to be cooked in the bird but sure ate this up!

Great recipe and a great way to free up your oven! This was perfect for Sunday dinner with roasted chicken. I wish I had this recipe during Thanksgiving...it would have saved me a lot of time. It's so moist and it tastes fabulous. My only caution is to only use the amount of broth necessary to moisten not the entire amount the recipe calls for or you'll end up with a soupy mess. Next time I might add in some sauage, apples or cranberries - YUM!

This was AMAZING!  I just starting hosting thanksgiving a few years ago and knew stuffing was something I needed to work on.  I made this stuffing this year and there was NOTHING left... even people who don't like stuffing ate my stuffing, and raved about it.  I mastered my mashed potatoes and candied yams, but never paid much attention to stuffing until this year and so glad I did.  I read a lot of reviews and made very minor changes - buttered crock pot first, added spices to butter mix with onions and celery, used broth as needed, and omitted mushrooms because not all of my family like them.  This was a HUGE hit.  Thank you Gayle for sharing.

My sister found this recipe and I just had to rate it because it was so fabulous and easy.  I loved the fact that it took a side dish away from the oven and created the best, softest, most flavorful dressing (stuffing goes in the bird).  We did make a lot of changes, so I guess my 5 star rating is for the method, not the actual recipe. We cut up 2 loaves of french bread instead of using stuffing mix. We toasted the bread and then added in cooked sausage, two peeled and chopped granny smith apples, cooked celery, onion and all the spices in the recipe as well as the eggs.  We then added about 3 cups of good quality chicken broth.  We put it all in the slow cooker and checked on it about every 30 minutes to 1 hour, adding in additional chicken broth if it started to look dry. We also stirred it each time to make sure it wasn't burning to the bottom of the crock pot. Try this recipe method....its totally worth it.

Loved it.  2nd time around I used half regular bread crumbs and half cornbread crumbs I made myself.  Haven't made it any different way since trying that! Only trouble would be that now I am obligated to make the stuffing for all holiday family gatherings.  O bother!

My family is a bit ....how do I say this nicely? Anyways I told them a little white lie and said I got this from a friend who is a chef in NYC and they thought it was the best stuffing ever! Everyone wanted the recipe...my husband and I laughed. It is that good though!

Excellent recipe, with a few small changes for our family to include a few things that we like in our stuffing. I did add a mess of fresh minced garlic and cut back on the onion and celery just a bit so I could add a cup or so of chopped carrot. I did double the spices and I kept the salt to a minimum. I used organic broth and all organic veggies/dry bread. Because it's tradition, I did add in chopped meat from the giblets and neck that I cooked down for the juice for gravy. Really, REALLY good. Even my husband who's super traditional when it comes to stuffing loved it.

I made this the day before Thanksgiving, and reheated it again the next day Not sure why I hadn't thought of using my Slow cooker before, but from now on, this will be my new tradition. Helps free up the oven for other cooking. Outstanding recipe too.

This is my stuffing recipe from now on. I did use less broth, 3 cups. Also added minced garlic. You have to adjust the broth according to the bread you use and just add part at a time. Everyone loved this and so easy in the slow cooker.

This was yummy! I was worried after reading some reviews it would be soggy, but I think others must not have read directions carefully or used fresh bread cubes or something. It was NOT soupy by any means - but it could also be a preference; some people like drier stuffing. If so, use less broth. I personally like mine moist. It was perfectly seasoned and didn't take hours to make. Two thumbs up, this is a keeper!

The flavor of this is amazing.  I had to stop myself from eating it right after I mixed everything together.  It did seem to be a little soggy, so I took the lid off and let it cook.  It will definitely be my standard stuffing recipe from now on.

Stuffing was a hit on Thanksgiving. This was my first attempt at making stuffing and it came out great. I used just poulty seasoning and sage for the spices as that is what I had on hand and omitted the eggs. I added about a cup of walnuts for extra crunch and added broth over the course of the day as needed. Cooked all day on low and it was great. You do have to watch it as even on low it will burn - just pull from the sides of the crockpot and pour in a little more broth.

This was excellent.  I also added pork sausage. I too would be careful with the liquid. I read someone else's instructions and they recommended not adding the 4 cups of broth right away. I used bakery bread cubes and not the packaged season ones since I added seasoning.

Excellent stuffing. My changes were as follows: 1/2 c. butter, no parsley, no mushrooms, no marjoram, NO salt (it doesn't need it because even with salt reduced broth, there is enough salt), start with 2 c. broth, no eggs.
I stuffed the turkey with the first batch and then made a second batch for the crockpot. I added 2 c. broth to the stuffing for the bird but in the crockpot I found it needed a bit more. Make sure to spray your crockpot with Pam on the bottom and sides to keep it from burning. Also, it was done on low within 5 hours. Great recipe...it will be the stuffing I use from now on.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving in 2006 and everyone loved it!  I skipped the mushrooms because none of the kids like them.  It was really nice not having to squeeze lots of side dishes into the oven all once for a change.  I started this dish first before starting on the turkey and other side dishes.  And it made the kitchen smell so wonderful!  I've shared this recipe with friends and will make it every year.

This was by far the worst recipe I've ever tried.  I followed the directions to a T and ended up with a goopy, gloppy, glob of goo.  It was awful.  I let it cook way beyond the time recommended and still couldn't get it to dry out to a servable consistency. Won't be trying this one again.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner- mixed all but the broth up the night before- added the broth right before cooking.   Followed the recipie exactly except added more broth  and left out the eggs. Everyone loved this stuffing, my mother said it was the best she ever had. It stayed moist  on "warm" ALL DAY in the slow cooker, never dried out. Wonderful taste. Will definitely make again. Thanks.

EXACTLY what I was looking for. We deep fry our turkey, so how do you get moist, tasty stuffing when you cook it outside the bird? A slow cooker! I used cubed stuffing in a bag (unseasoned) and the amount of chicken broth called for in the recipe was perfect, as was the time. I added 1 pound Jimmy Dean sage sausage. My guests raved, and we had plenty of leftovers--which I ate and spent a few weeks dieting away. Oh well! Thanks Gayle!

First let me say I consider myself to be an experienced cook---I made this stuffing for 26 guests this very Thanksgiving day. I would have told you yesterday it was impossible to make a bad stuffing but today I can say that this recipe was nothing more than a gummy mess! I used only 2 1/2 cups broth, clearly 4 cups would have been soup. I took it out of the crock pot after 3 hours (because it looked like glue) and baked it for 40 minutes. I would never recommend this cooking method or make this recipe again. Very disappointing after all that chopping. Fortunatly I made another stuffing recipe that saved the day!

VERY GOOD!  My crockpot unfortunately choose Thanksgiving morning to die and so I ended up putting it in the oven while the turkey cooled and was carved but it was excellent!  I ended up using about 2 1/2 cups of broth and "just because" I threw in about 3 coarsely shredded carrots.  Big hit at our table.

THis is a great recipe! My family has made it for the last several years. We fry our turkey, which is an absolutely fabulous way to fix turkey, but I have always missed that wonderful smell of turkey and stuffing cooking in the house. This smells wonderful while cooking. Also it frees up so much oven space for everything else. It is really mosit - so you don't miss cooking it in the bird.

We took a complete dinner to grandpa's house for Thanksgiving.
This is the stuffing recipe I used and everyone loved it.  It also made
the house smell so good all day long.  Everyone preferred this stuffing
to the stuffing that had been put in the bird.  It's a keeper in my recipe file!

As if this recipe needed yet another five star review!  Made this for our office Thanksgiving potluck, and it was met with rave reviews!  I used all of the liquid, and my advice on that would be use common sense as others have stated.  If you are using cubed stuffing mix like I used, (Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix) you will need all the liquid called for in this recipe.  I tried to moisten all the cubes as I put them in the crock pot, and then periodically checked it to see if it needed more.  Nothing worse than dry as a bone stuffing!  This came out perfect.  I will make this for Thanksgiving, but will add sausage to it because my family prefers it that way.  This is truly fix it and forget it, and I love it!

YUM!  I couldn't find plain bread cubes so I bought some day old ciabatta bread off the discount bakery rack for less than $2 and cut it into cubes and dried it out at 300F for 10-20 min (I looked online how to make bread cubes) I was very impressed!  I threw in some dried cranberries with the vegetables too, I'm ready for fall!

Since I can't edit my first review, I will review it again. Okay, I loved the recipe the first few times, I didn't have a problem with it being soggy as I used stale white bakery buns. I also pre made some cooked white rice and as the day went on I added this to the stuffing. In the end the consistence of the stuffing was perfect as I was able to control how many ingredients I added. At one point, I decided to fry up some bacon bits and added that. The end result was delicious! I do not believe this is a recipe that you throw in the crock pot and ignor, I think it needs tweeking along the way.

The flavor was excellent!  It was very soupy though, but I didn't follow the suggestions to use dry stuffing mix.  I will definitely make this again with the dry stuffing and I bet that will be perfect.

WONDERFUL, flavorful, not your Momma's stuffing (and my Mom's was the talk of the town). Also, my sister in law who doesn't really like stuffing, owns a very successful catering business (where chicken is their special thing), and said Mom's was the only stuffing she'd eat, loved this. I think that says it all.

SO good.  Just as good as in-turkey stuffing and it worked well since we cooked our turkey "deconstructed" (ie not whole) due to limited oven space and speedier cooking.  Next time I'll add stuff like nuts and cranberries.  I used store bought bagged stuffing cubes and the amt of broth called for was just about right.  It'll be on the menu next year for sure.

Made this without the mushrooms, vegetable stock in place of chicken stock and additional sage.  It's the best stuffing I have ever had!

I love this recipe and have now made it for my family 3 years in a row. I don't include the mushrooms because I have a bunch of picky eaters who do not like them. And instead of sage I put in the sage sausage as other reviewers have suggested and it always comes out amazing.

Remember, the recipe says "4 1/2 cups, or as needed".  With a bit over seven cups of dry ingredients, four and a half does seem a tad much. But the enjoinder "or as needed" is the important part.  Have it on hand, add it just before the beaten eggs, about a cup at a time and mixing well after, adding only enough to get the right consistency.  I made it with freshly baked cornbread, which is already rarther moist, and only used about 2 cups of broth.  Dried bread cubes or dried (toasted) cornbread would take rather more.  Perhaps the recipe ought read, "chicken broth as needed, 2-4 cups approximately".  I also add garlic and rosemary, and sometimes a little powdered bay leaf. And if the chicken broth is rather bland, some powdered chicken bouillon as well, adjusting the salt accordingly. (ALWAYS taste the mixture before adding the eggs to adjust for seasoning.) I also like to add sauteed, not raw, mushrooms, or if I have it, Mushrooms Duxelles-- much tastier! This works well with Shiitakes.

Actually came out really good!  No one would have guessed it wasn't made in a turkey.  I could tell a little difference in taste, but the stuffing was very moist and a big hit!

I know there are lots of positive reviews but I did not like this recipe!  No one in my family at their portion.  I made it for Thanksgiving and was hopeful because it was a crockpot recipe.  But we found it mushy and bland.

You have to try this, it is soooo good!  The crock pot idea was a life saver since I volunteered to bring stuffing to a Boy Scout Dinner.  I doubled everything and threw it in the crock put around lunchtime, unplugged for transportation and replugged at our celebration and it was great!

This was easy and good.  I did only use about a cup and a half of broth as other reviewers had suggested.  We don't do mushrooms so I added extra onion and celery.  I stirred right before serving and loved the crusty edges getting mixed in.  It was as if the top had browned in the oven.  Plenty of non-stick spray around the bowl before cooking made clean up easy.

Great Recipe that I've used for years.  Family just loves it!  Key is really to only add enough broth to moisten the mixture....so don't dump all the broth in at one time.  Add it a little at a time.  This can burn in the crockpot, so either check on it a few times or start it out on low setting.  Not all crockpots heat at the same temperatures, even if on a low setting.

This recipe had definite potential, but I think I screwed it up by making my own bread cubes.  I didn't buy store bought bread cubes, instead I used sandwich bread toasted in the oven to harden it and then cubed it.  The flavors were good, but the stuffing turned a dark brown color and didn't look appetizing at all.  I'll make it again, but will buy bread cubes next time.  (I also did not use mushrooms.  Only used about 1/2 of the broth - which was plenty, but then again, I wasn't using the right bread either!)
Updated:  made this again over the weekend.  MUCH better this time.  I used a french loaf from the grocery bakery (you can ask them to run this through the slicer so it's easier on you.  I put the slides on cookie sheets overnight for them to get stale and then cubed them the next day.  Also used mushrooms this time - though I didn't really notice their flavor in particular.  Would definitely make again using my second method.

This recipe is outstanding.  The prep is easy, it's perfect for Thanksgiving when you're trying to save oven space, and the taste is fantastic.  Like most people, I did make some changes.  I chopped the mushrooms very fine as my husband doesn't like them if he can see them.  The night before I made the stuffing I sauteed the onion, celery, and mushroom.  I also added the seasonings so they would be evenly distributed.  Then I cubed an Italian Boule from the bakery and let it sit out overnight to get nice and stale.  I did have to finish the cubes in the oven so they were nice and dry.  The day I assembled I just warmed the onion/celery/mush sautee so it was room temp (the butter gets hard and would be impossible to stir right out of the fridge) and proceeded with the rest of the directions.  

One important note - many, many reviewers complained that there was too much broth.  In the directions it states (caps for emphasis, not shouting) ADD BROTH UNTIL MOISTENED.  Do not add all the broth it calls for!!  I'm assuming the author used the amount of broth as a starting point because the final amount you used would depend on how dry your breadcubes are.  This is a critical step.

Finally, I added a chopped apple and a couple of handfuls of dried cranberries.  I let it cook away in the crockpot and it was awesome.  It does get crusty on the side but in a yummy way - that was my favorite part.  

This will be on our Thanksgiving table for years to come!!

We made this for Thansgiving and it was outstanding. Some tips: you can mix everything but the broth up the night before. We leave out the eggs just because it is our preference.  
A mix of white and dark bread (especially rye) make this even better.  
 A well greased crockpot prevents sticking. 
Add more broth while cooking if needed- we added about 3/4 -1 cup as is cooked.

I am going to make this stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving. I am also making my turkey on the grill using the beer can method. This leaves my oven free for pie and biscuit making. Update. Made this and it was very good and so easy. It's so great that I don't have to tie up oven space making dressing. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this recipe was wonderful!! I added dried cherries to mine and used sliced portabello mushrooms instead of buttons and the whole thing was eaten up that day.

Only tip I have for this recipe is you really need to know how to "eyeball" things. For instance if you take a look at the breadcrumbs and spices and know that 4 1/2 cups of broth is going to be too much don't add all of it. That's why people were coming up with soggy stuffing. I only added a little at a time and it came out to about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of broth and it turned out perfect! 

Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!!

Something went terribly wrong! Flavor delicious but I had soup instead of dressing.  Maybe because I used store brand bread and it didn't hold up in the crock pot?  I will try it again in the future with better bread.

This is by far one of the easiest recipes I have ever made! It is far superior in taste then any other stuffing recipes.  I lilke to add green apples, cranberries and walnuts to mine as well.

I would rate this with 6 stars if I could. Everyone thought this was the best they have ever had, including myself. I used bakery white and wheat bread, cubed it, and let it dry out on sheets overnight. I used about 3 cups of broth and it was perfect.  Next time I will cut down the salt to 1/2-1 tsp., per my preference. Just a fabulous, easy recipe that I will most certainly be making again!

I made this yesterday (Canadian Thanksgiving), turned out great, I Added just enough chicken broth to make the stuffing moist. Like most other reviewers, I cooked it for about 5 hours. It was very convenient, and one less thing to worry about on a busy day!

Taste was excellent, but 4.5 cups of broth is a HUGE mistake. I realized there was a problem after adding only a couple of cups; FAR too late.   If you're after dressing soup, or have HOURS to cook off WAY too much liquid, this recipe is for you.

I'm VERY picky about my dressing and this was great. Thanks for sharing--it also helped with my oven space problem. One important change to suit my taste: I substituted cornbread for all the bread and left out the mushrooms. (If you want good cornbread dressing, make your own cornbread a day or two in advance. You can use the recipe on the cornmeal package but don't add sugar. Do NOT buy those bags of cornbread mix--I tried them once and had to make if over after Thanksgiving because I was so disappointed with the original results.)

Things were kind of hectic around the house on Thanksgiving, so I thought I'd make things as easy as possible, and decided to try this.  I am so glad I did because I don't think I'll ever actually stuff a bird again.  I did make some changes because it was on T-giving morning, and I wasn't going shopping.  Had no mushrooms, so browned and crumbled a 12 oz pkg of Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage, used a large bag of Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing, more like 3 c of broth, then after a while I did add more poultry seasoning, some Lawry's special blend seasoning for poultry, and some McCormick rotisserie chicken seasoning. I don't think it's too important about those exactly, I just wanted it a little more seasoned.  I felt pressed for time, so left it on high quite a bit longer, before going to low for aobut 3 hrs. Awesome.  Everyone loved it.

I've never been able to make stuffing outside the bird but this recipe changed all that! I changed the spices to match my favorite recipe, used 
2 1/2 to 3 cups broth (added more as needed while cooking) and it was great. Stuffing in the bird is still the best but this recipe runs a close second.

Great recipe with the guidance provided by other reviewers. 
1) I only used half the butter;
2) I only used about 3 cups of broth, which I added 1/2 cup at a time over the course of the cooking time because I really did not want mushy stuffing;
3) I turned off the crockpot after about 4 hours -- definitely would have been overcooked at much more than that;
4) I left out the mushrooms because I did not have any;
5) I did use freshly made cubed dried bread (baked myself for 15 mins at 350);
6) I added all the spices to the pan of veggies and butter before putting with the bread in the crockpot.

Everyone loved the stuffing! Thank you!

I have made this for years- I use 2 bags of dry season cubes. I use vegetables w o softening I also use 3 eggs. - I like them fresh and crunchy. You need a huge bowl to mix. I add chicken broth as needed- so it doesn't get too mushy. I also add dried cranberries and sassage. I check on several times adding broth as needed. Everyone loves this stuffing!
 I cook sassage nite before. And cut up celery and onions the nite before.

I've made this recipe a few years in a row now and love that it includes mushrooms, celery, and fresh herbs.  I usually add in my own extra vegetables (zucchini, bell peppers, or spinach) for a little added nutrition.  The tip with placing a towel under the lid works great to keep the top layer of stuffing from becoming soggy.  I also moisten the mixture with broth, and then reserve the extra broth to add later in the cooking process.

This stuffing is delicious! As stated by others do not add all 4.5 cups of broth at one time.  I used the dry packaged cubes and added enough to make it moist.  But I also checked it occasionally as it was cooking and added more broth as it was cooking.

I generally dislike homemade stuffings but found this one to be delightful! I didn't alter any quantities, baked it in the oven following the suggested directions and loved it! (okay, I omited the celery and mushrooms because some of my guests had strong taste preferences, but as far as seasonings and broth goes, I followed it to the letter) I had several people comment that it was the best stuffing that they had ever had. Bravo on a delicious yet simple recipe!

This stuffing recipe has the perfect ratio of moistness and spices!  The only modification I made was the addition of some Chardonnay to the sauteed celery and onion.  I've made this recipe for the last several holidays where turkey was involved.  I even made it for my dad to go with pork roast!  Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!!!!

I made this last Thanksgiving and my family decided that I am in charge of dressing anytime we have a turkey. I love that it frees up the oven. I change it up a bit every time - toasted pine nuts, diced apple, bacon, dried cranberries... This is a basic recipe that can be easily customized. I do recommend using the tea towel under the lid of the slow cooker to keep the dressing from getting soggy. Try it - you won't regret it

Would have given this five stars but the amount of liquid called for is way too much!! Cooked in the slow cookery but then had to put in the oven for a while to dry up the liquid and I didn't even use the amount called for. Everyone said the flavor was great though.

This is my go to recipe EVERY year and it always get rave reviews.  DO NOT use all the broth that the recipe calls for!  For the people that were complaining, it clearly says to use enough broth to MOISTEN the stuffing...You will then be able to add more as the stuffing dries out during cooking....this can be customized to ALL tastes by just adjusting the amount of broth.  I like my stuffing moist but my husband likes it crispier so he will take a scoop from the outside of the stuffing and I will eat from the center.  I also add a couple handful of cranberries to add some sweetness to the bites.  You could add sausage, nuts, raisins, you name it.  This is the perfect "base" recipe if you like your stuffing more complex.

I have made this recipe several times...and, have passed-it on to all my friends! I must say - you need to buy (GOOD) bakery bread.  Cut into cubes then pre-toasting it makes all the difference in the world!I even add my fresh herbs/spices before toasting...this will stop it from being gluey or too wet! Hope this is helpful.

We cannot get enough stuffing in this house so this is a great way to get some extra. I added extra sage but that is just to our tastes.

My family loves this stuffing! It has been requested at all of our holiday dinners!  I think the technique is perfect, but adjust the seasonings to your taste.  I also cut back on some of the butter and you can't tell the difference.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Best stuffing! I was so worried about finding a great stuffing recipe, after my failed attempt last year (it was awful). But this recipe is so fool proof and everyone loved it! As other's have noted, if you are using dried bread crumbs from the baker, 2 cups of broth is likely enough.I think I used about 2 1/4, and it was perfect. Start out with 2 cups, and you can always add as it cooks! Yummm yummmm...I want to make this again! I can't wait until the next holiday. Oh and I cooked it on low for about 4.5 hours, and also mixed everything really well.

Delicious!  Very easy to make and it tastes just like traditional stuffing from the turkey.  Don't use all the liquid, add as needed for moisture.

Never have done my stuffing in a slow cooker before and have never added eggs so was a bit leary but it was wonderful.... superb! Everyone loved it. Omited the mushrooms as a few in our family don't like them but otherwise followed the recipe and it was one of the best stuffings I ever made!! I used 2 - 300 gram bags of dried cubes and 1 litre (or 4 c) of chicken broth, stirred it gently a couple times during the 4 1/2 hour cooking time and it was just the perfect moistness! Definitely a keeper!!

In combination with a slow cooker mashed potato recipe from this site, this recipe made my turkey dinner seem like no work at all. I prepped the day before and kept refrigerated until time to cook. I used the keep warm setting on my slow cooker as it gets quite hot, and cooked for about 7 hours. The stuffing was moist, with nice crisp bits around the outside edges. Very flavorful as well! I made a few slight adjustments to the recipe - using 1/2 the butter and omitting the mushrooms. I only needed to use 3.5 cups of the broth. The mixture was as moist as I typically make my stuffing. I am so happy to be able to streamline a typically work intensive meal. Thanks so much!

Almost perfect stuffing. Next time, the only chane I'd make would be to eliminate the salt. Even though I used low sodium broth, the additional salt was too much for us.  Otherwise this stuffing tasted just like it came from the bird.

The crock pot sounded like a good idea, until I read the recipe.........Where's the cornbread?????. Sorry, but I wouldn't try it. Only cornbread stuffing ( or as southern cooks say, dressing) for me.

This was really good.  I used pre-packaged bread (two boxes of Stove Top), omitted the mushrooms, and added 1/2 lb cooked crumbled sausage, 1 peeled apple and 1/2C dried cherries.  I omitted all the spices except a sprinkle of the poultry seasoning.  I cooked on low for 6 hours, checking and stirring every hour and adding stock as needed (started out with just one cup and ended up using about 3 cups total).

We have made this crockpot stuffing and it is great !  I make sure to spray the crockpot with cooking spray and then the stuffing comes out with the crispy edges that our family loves.  I also cook up the giblets and add another small pkg of giblets and 1 lb of pork sausage with the butter, onion & celery.  MMMMM good !

I've used this recipe for the past 2 Thanksgiving with great reviews.  It makes things so much easier when the oven is tied up with the turkey.  The stuffing in the bird is never enough for everyone so having this recipe makes entertaining so much easier.  I omit mushrooms just for personal preference. I cooked about 5 hrs

I used this last Thanksgiving and forgot to rate it until I started looking for the recipe again to prep for this year's Thanksgiving!  It was SO nice to be able to have moist stuffing like the kind you get out of the bird, but without having to cook it in the bird!  And I could make a big batch, unlike the small amount that is able to cook in the bird.  I just started it in my Crockpot in the morning and could forget about it until it was time to eat!!!  I give it 5 stars because how nice it is to prep and forget it on such a busy day like Thanksgiving.

Turned out really well. I used more liquid than it called for. My sides burnt just a teensy bit, so be sure you stir it often.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly since I didn't measure the cups of bread and used far less butter.  I did use about all the broth, but ended up with not enough sage - getting the right amount of sage is the art of the stuffing.  The stuffing made using this recipe had the consistency of stuffing, not dressing which tends to be drier.  I loved being able to free up the oven.

I got rave reviews on this! I added about 1-1/2 cans chicken broth, and never had to add any more liquid. I started it on high, turned it down to low after 45 mins., then "warm" after about 3 hours. The mushrooms add a nice texture.

I've made this recipe many times now and even though it makes a do-able stuffing never quite tasted as good as when baked in the bird. This year I used the broth from the boiled gizzards inside the turkey along with chicken broth to moisten the bread crumbs...it gave it more of a baked inside the bird taste. Probably used a total amount of three and half cups. I started with 2 1/2 cups and stirred periodically adding more of the broth. If you don't stir it the side get too well done. Also don't cook on high, low for four hours was still making the sides crusty. I did use the towel under the lid and it worked great...thanks for that idea. PS...this makes a ton so use large crock pot or cut down on amount of ingredients.

Disclaimer, I am famous for being a poor cook. I followed the recipe and ended up with a mushy bland mess. Maybe if I tried and tried again I could successfully make slow cooker stuffing but it was such a mess I don't think I will make a second attempt.

I really liked this recipe.  I made this for my christmas dinner.  I followed all the ingredients to a T except the broth.  I just put in enough to moisten it and in addition to the bread cubes I added one box of Stove Top.  I just mixed it all together till it was just moist and cooked about 6 hours.  I expected the worst based on the reviews but it turned out fantastic!  Got alot of compliments on it.  I'd definetely make it again!

Absolutely delicious!  I served it for Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved it.  So easy to make, I used fresh mushroom and sauteed them with the onion and celery.  This will be the only way I fix stuffing from now on.

Not sure how so many got this to work.    Did a test run before Thanksgiving.  Great recipe for the oven but not the crock pot.  Came out like soup, and yes I read reviews and lowered broth.    However to me a good recipe should not need changes to be edible.  DO NOT TRY FOR FIRST TIME ON THANKSGIVING unless of course you have some stove top on hand for back up.

My bread was dry so I used 4 cups of broth. I also added cranberries. I took dried cranberries and boiled them for 10 minutes, drained and then added in after I had the crockpot on high for the initial 30 minutes. YUM!    ETA: IF YOUR STUFFING IS TOO MOIST WHILE COOKING, ADD MORE BREAD CUBES! IF IT'S TOO DRY, ADD MORE STOCK!

The flavor was fine, but the texture was slimy & pudding-like. I followed the recipe exactly but followed the advice of reviewers and only added enough broth to keep it moist. I would like to be in the kitchens of those who ranked this a 5-star: Either they don't know what stuffing should be like or they are fabulous chefs doing something different than I'm doing.

this recipe is AWESOME. i have only made stuffing a handful of times in my life, but this recipe was super simple and quick to throw together. if you use FRESH dried bread cubes, then yeah you probably don't need the whole amount of chicken broth asked for. However...I cut this recipe in half and used croutons. I had to use more than half of the broth asked for because they are a lot drier. I would also recommend that if you are using croutons, to use WAY less seasoning. The taste was wonderful, but powerful because I did add the seasoning too. I will make this again because we wolfed this down.

I make this every holiday, and it's always a big hit. I make it exactly as the recipe states, the only thing I adjust is the amount of broth (which I adjust based on if it looks too dry or not. If it looks too wet, I take the lid off for the last half-hour of cooking to help it evaporate). Sometimes I add apple chunks.

What a delicious and easy way to make stuffing! I stuffed my turkey with it and put the extra in the crock pot. It was great to free up some oven space. Thank you!

I made this for thanksgiving and it was my favorite dish of the day.  SO EASY!  And we all love one less thing to worry about on holidays.  I used the tip from another reviewer and put a kitchen towel under the lid of the crockpot, and that help keep the stuffing from getting too wet with condensation.  Great tip!  Also, you definitely need to use only about half the broth at first, then tinker with it later to get your desired level of moistness.   I used a honey wheat bread and a challah bread together, and I absolutely loved the combined flavors.

Everyone was silent, pushing it around their plate until my son said he doesn't like it. I agreed and everyone burst out laughing at how terrible this was.  I just don't see how this can be adjusted to work.  I told all that at least we will remember this Thanksgiving as the one with the worst stuffing for years to come.

I have been using this recipe for several years, the only difference is mine does not call for marjoram and only calls for 1 can (14 1/2 ounces) chicken broth.  I also do not add the salt, because it tasted too salty with it.  Delicious recipe!!!

I thought this was great - i made it for the office Thanksgiving Potluck today and got rave reviews from everyone. I bought a carton of the Progresso chicken stock and used maybe 3/4 of it. I sauteed everything the night before (as suggested by one reviewer) and combined it with store bought breadcubes and about 1/4 of the chicken stock and refrigerated it. I did not use the eggs, because i was afraid they wouldnt cook through in just 3 hours. Then i plugged in the crockpot and set it to High and let it cook until lunch. I added chicken stock as needed it turned out perfect. Next time i may use less salt than it calls for - but other than that - great!

Not out-of-this-world, but as far as stuffing goes, this is what you'd expect it to taste like.  I made 1.5 times the recipe -- PLENTY for 20+ people -- and used store-bought, bakery bread crumbs and 4 whole cans of chicken broth.  It seemed moist at first, but it all worked out fine.  I did stir it a few times.  By the end of the cooking period, it was a little crusty on the bottom, but we just didn't eat that part.  Definitely a good option and saves valuable space in the oven!  Would make again, and really wouldn't change a thing.  I used the gourmet mushroom pack (shitake, oyster, baby bellas) for a little extra flavor and texture.

My friends loved this. In fact my boyfriend who usually prefers stuffing out of the bird said this his new favorite stuffing. I did add the broth gradually and it did turn an interesting color (not quite gray but a funny brown, that might have been a result of the bread cubes, I used the packaged stuff). It was nice as far as not needing additional oven space also.

Skip the slow cooker part: I made the mistake of being out of the house while it was in the cooker, and when I came home it was BURNT.  Horrible.  I'm sure it would have tasted fine had it not been cooked to a crisp.  Don't make my mistake!

This stuffing came out awesome! I made it even easier to prepare doing the following: I used 2 16 oz. boxes of Bell's original stuffing mix, and I omitted the dry spices/seasonings (they were already in the stuffing mix). I also sauteed my veggies in the butter the night before, and tossed them together with the stuffing mix in a large bowl. I refrigerated that overnight. Thanksgiving morning, I mixed in the eggs and about 4 cups of chicken broth, put everything in the crock pot, and cooked it on low for about 5 hours. It was perfect, and everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and got huge raves on it!!  I did add craisens and 1 can of cream of chicken soup, put it on in the morning and it cooked all day!!!  It was delicious!  One hint I would give, make sure you are using unseasoned bread stuffing cubes.. if you use the seasoned kind.. it a bit of an overkill and takes away from the seasons added!

I have used this recipe for all my holiday dinners.  I find that if you make it the day before you have dinner that the flavours blend together even better.  I leave out the mushrooms and cook up some bacon and throw it in.  Pretty good stuff!!

Great hit at a pot luck.  I did cut the chicken broth down and margerine down by half as suggested.  Also added two packages of sausage meat fried up, cut up and drained.  And about 1 1/2 cups of craisons really added a nice flavor.  Also cut back the cooking time...Start on high like it says and then down to low only for 2-3 hrs  max.

I make my stuffing this way every year now.  I would recommend doing a "test run" prior to see how it turns out so you can adjust ingredients.  I've added cooked sausage to the mix as well & it was good.  It's a real time & space saver to do it in the crockpot, plus it travels well.

This is how I will always cook my stuffing using the crockpot.  It freed up my oven space and was so easy.  I made my own bread crumbs in the oven using sourdough bread the day before and prepared the veggies too.  Then just dumped it all in the day of and it was so much better than my mother-in-laws (which took her forever to make)...he-he:>

I'm not too sure that I should be rating this recipe (I used my own recipe for stuffing) but I'm rating it 5 stars for the cooking method!

My recipe for stuffing is close to this one (seasoning is a tad different) and I also don't use egg-I just couldn't fathom how adding egg to stuffing could help this recipe.  

But I needed the oven space so I tried this for Thanksgiving.

I'm here to tell you that cooking in a slow cooker WORKS!

I just made my big bowl of stuffing and popped in the slow cooker for about 5 hours.  I stirred and checked moisture a few times and if it needed a little more moisture I just tossed in some broth.

It's a keeper. We decided to start cooking the turkey on the bbq so cooking the stuffing in the slow cooker is  perfect.  I had to make two batches so I was able to mix a loaf of multi grain, rye bread and sourdough bread.  I cut them and dried them out in the oven.  I used fresh herbs and double the amount adding the herbs to the vegetables slightly before adding it to the bread.  I ended up using just under two cups of broth and adding two small cans of water chestnuts chopped.

Ugh. When I picked a slow cooker recipe, I hoped it wouldn't need constant attention. You need to be around to add more liquid since as the bread crumbs warm, they suck up the liquid and leave you VERY quickly with a scorched mess. Next time, I'll stick with traditional stuffing since it would be less of a hassle.

I make a similar recipe but I don't use the dry bread.  I prefer just to use whatever bread I buy at the store that week and I don't use any broth.  I also finely chop 2 apples and add it to the dressing.  No thyme or marjoram either.  My family loves this and says I never make enough!
Adding to this...why would you put eggs i nto the dressing?  It's going to come out like bread pudding.  My family likes "chunky" dressing!

Simply awesome.  I was a bit nervous to try stuffing cooked in a slow cooker but I have never received so many compliments on my stuffing as this.  I used a mixture of store bought white breadcrumbs crumbs and added my own homemade whole grain crumbs and cut down on the broth to about half.  Also added pork sausage and grated apple and just kept an eye on it as it cooked.  This is the only way I will cook my stuffing from here on in.

THANK YOU !! This was INCREDIBLE !!  A few minor changes...First of all, when I cook a turkey (about every other month) I make my own turkey stock and skim off all the fat.  Freeze both for later use.  So, I used turkey fat instead of butter and turkey stock instead of chicken broth (also only added the stock 1/2 cup at a time)  I used cubed bread (2 lbs) I cut the night before and left out to "air dry"  which will also affect the amount of liquid used. (Which ended up being only 2 cups)  Don't like mushrooms or eggs so I left them both out.  Cooked in the crock pot for 4 hours and EVERYONE was trying to figure out how I got so much stuffing out of my bird.  Many "grama's" and "great grams" stated this was the BEST stuffing they EVER had.

This was okay. Not exceptional. It was not as good as some stuffing I'v made. I tried making this because it was cooked in the crock pot. I dont think I will make this again.

---I just made this for my 40 person family Christmas.  Everyone LOVED it!  I added 1 whole apple, chopped very fine.  I toasted the bread under broil for a few minutes as well.  It turned out great and I have been volunteered to make it again for Christmas day!  This time I am going to add some pecans!  Awesome recipe!

MMMMMMMMMM....YUMMY! This was an amazing recipe in terms of prep,taste, and cleanup! As a few others had suggested, for the last hour or so, I took the lid off the pot so it would get a little crispy..it worked perfectly! There was an amazing combination of moist and crisp..just wonderful.  Word to the wise..be sure to spray your cooker with nonstick cooking spray, so you don't have a big mess at the end, and you can suck up every last bit of this amazing stuff!

This stuffing was too mushy and visually unappealing.  I reduced the broth and left the lid off the crock-pot as others had suggested.  Will stick to the making stuffing in the oven...

This was a very easy way to make stuffing for someone with a small oven.  I think I might have added too much broth because mine was somewhat "gluey."  I'm not sure if I would make this again.

I did the oven version and it was just like mom used to make. Husband said (3 times!) it was the best stuffing ever.  Can't wait to try the slow cooker method for the next big family dinner.

Absolutely fantastic!  I hesitated using a new recipe for Thanksgiving, but went ahead because of all the great reviews of this recipe.  I left out the mushrooms and ended up using closer to 3 1/2 cups of broth.  With a newer model crock pot, like I used, the cooking time is definitely on the shorter side.  Mine was ready way ahead of time, and sat in the crock on warm for hours, but was still incredibly moist and delicious.  No leftovers!

I am giving this 4 stars rather than 5, only because the recipe calls for a lot more broth than is needed. Otherwise, this is a delicious traditional stuffing that now is the only recipe I will use for Thanksgiving.

It was okay. The cooking time was way over for my slow cooker. I have a Cuisinart and it was pretty much done on low after an hour or so. The stuffing got really dark and wasn't very flavorful.

I made this stuffing for Christmas dinner and my whole family loved it!!!  It is an excellent recipe and you have to try it!  Even my step-dad who hates stuffing absolutely loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up adding 3 cans of chicken broth.  The stuffing was actuallyl ready in only 3 hours in the slow cooker (first 45 mins on high and the remainder on low).  Will definitely cook again!!

This was an excellent tasting stuffing. I had to cut my broth in half and it still came out a little too watery for my taste. And I almost doubled the seasoning.

Ok what did I do wrong here I only added 1 3/4 cups of chicken broth it turned into soup looked to me that with the cover on the crock pot just added a ton of water to the stuffing till it turned to soup 3 hours later.

Awesome!  I have been looking for a recipe like my grandma used to make (she didnt use a written recipe, just made it to taste) this is the closest that I have found.  I didnt add the mushrooms because Grandma didnt, and I also baked it instead of putting it in the slow cooker.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is certainly a five-star recipe.  Why? Because now you can make stuffing in your crock pot that tastes JUST as good as if you baked it!  No, this recipe doesn't add any new, exotic twists on taste, but it does make for a very yummy dish that is hassle free, and a holiday necessity.  Its easy to transport and keep warm too!  I will be using this recipe for my future holiday gatherings.

Very good and easy recipe.  I will make this again.  I toasted my bread and left it out overnight.  I like it better than the store bought bread cubes.

My sister tried this on our family Thanksgiving at our Aunt's house.  It was so delicious!  We kept sampling it before we left the house for the hour drive over!  We cut down on the chicken broth, used bagged bread cubes (didn't want to mess w/toasting bread) and added the sausage.  We only cooked it about half the recommended time, and added some more bread cubes right before we left the house to give the stuffing a little firmer texture.  It was a big hit.  My sister (the one who cooked it) kept complimenting it so much my dad asked her if she was going to break her arm patting herself on the back!  Great recipe!

The secret to making this recipe is to monitor the moisture level frequently.  The recipe calls for a 45 minute "booster" to get the slow cooker up to the right temperature.   So, don't add too much moisture to start.  Add more as you go along.  You can always add... it's tough taking it away.  Also, as you check moisture levels, be sure to use a rubber spatula to turn the stuffing.  That not only helps it cook better, but it keeps it fluffier if you do it right and can prevent the dressing from burning on the sides of the pot.  As you can tell, this isn't like other "fix it and forget it" crock-pot recipes.  Monitor, monitor, monitor.

I prepared this the night before and only added 2 1/2 cups of broth to start. I cooked it the next day and had to add more broth as it cooked. I too omitted the marjoram as I didn't think it went with the other ingredients. I also added some dried cranberries and they added some colour and flavour.

This recipe was a big hit this year at Thanksgiving dinner.  I did double the recipe, there were 17 over for Thanksgiving.  I did read reviews about broth and just added as needed.  I made the dressing the night before all ingredients but egg and broth,covered it in airtight bowl over night and added egg and broth when ready to place in crock pot.  The flavors were amazing just like I remember my Grandmother's stuffing.

Did not like this at all.  I added the liquid slowly as other reviewers suggested, but it still came out sticky and unedible.

This was so good.. I made this perfect by adding the broth as needed.  Turned out nice and crunchy but moist and delicious!  I actually used most of the broth but by adding a bit at a time.

I made this for a work potluck.  Everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  Changes I made were to use only a half cup of butter, half teaspoon of salt, no marjoram (I didn't have any) and reduced sodium broth.  I used fresh french bread that I cubed a few days earlier and left out to dry.  The night before I sauteed the onion, parsley and celery in the butter and added to the bread cubes along with the seasoning.  I left this overnight in the fridge.  In the morning I added the 2 beaten eggs and popped it in the slow cooker.  I took it to work and then added the broth as needed (overall about 2.5 cups), cooking it on high for 45 minutes, then on low for another 3.25 hours or so.  It turned out moist and yummy!  Definitely the closest I've had to stuffing cooked in the bird.

This Thanksgiving, I was looking for dressing recipes. I came across this one and decided to use it due to the high rating. It turns out I had made this same recipe 2 years ago! Excellent flavor and came together quickly. I used roughly 22 cups of dried bread cubes (without the seasoning packet), omitted the mushrooms (due to personal taste), eggs (really didn't miss those at all) and the salt (per previous reviews). I didn't measure the other vegetables, used dried herbs, added one package of sausage, and used 4 (14.5 ounce) cans of chicken broth. This seemed to be an adequate amount of broth (I had read through all the reviews about soupy dressing). Next time I would leave out the sausage as it seemed a bit overwhelming. I also added sunflower seeds and sauteed garlic with the celery and onions. Overall, this is a keeper recipe and one I will turn to each time I host Thanksgiving.

This was great! I made it for a Thanksgiving Recipe Exchange, and love the slow cooker option, since everyone is so pressed for oven space on the holiday. I used almost 2 loaves of cubed French bread that I baked on 200 degrees to get crisp (like the bagged stuffing.) I followed the advice of others and ended up using just under a can of broth, as well as laid a dish towel between the crockpot and the lid, to soak up some of the condensation so it wouldn't become way soggy. The flavor was great, and I loved that I could do all the main prep work the day before, just tossing it all together the day of. I DID add sage sausage (that I browned ahead of time) and did cook for 4 hours maximum. Definitely a keeper!

I have been using this recipe for over 30 years and love it.  Understand, if you like crispy dressing using a crock put is not for you.  Also, crock pots do not cook off liquid they only intensify it.  

I always start with it barely moist and rarely have to add more broth.  I also only use 1/2 the butter and do not cook on high.  If you like oysters in your dressing as I do added 1/2 to 1 cup chopped oysters but make the mixture a little more dry as the oyster 'liquor' will add more moisture.  

For you cornbread dressing lovers this works great.  I make the cornbread the day before and let it dry out a bit and I use use the oven method when using cornbread.  For those who only have 2 to 4 for a holiday it can also be coupled with a turkey roll or roast.  Place the thawed turkey in the center of the cooker and lightly pack the dressing around it.  Cover the top with foil and cook 8 to 10 hours on low.  

Hope this helps folks.

This is a good recipe and very convenient, when you have to cook a big dinner as I did on Easter Sunday. I cut a fresh loaf of bread into cubes and air-dried it for 2 days. It absorbed 1 & 1/2 (14.5 oz) cans of broth without losing form or becoming soggy.However, the next time , I shall omit the mushrooms. I did not like the texture or appearance.

My familt has used this recipe for the last seven - SEVEN - years! Hard to believe it's been that long!

It's a favourite for the following reasons:

1. Crockpot - freeing up room in the oven

2. Can be made vegetarian (substitute veg stock for chicken) because it isn't inside the bird!

I have used both fresh sliced bread and dried bread cubes for this recipe - I find the dried works much better.


I always use this recipe to stuff the turkey as well - always fantastic.

The most important part is getting the stuffing to the perfect moisture level, which is easier and easier each time as you learn how it cooks - just add the stock bit by bit, and don't overdo it! :)

I decided to make this for Thanksgiving, make it the night before, and save some time.  WOW!  I'm so glad I did.  First of all, the flavor is incredible.  As you are adding the broth, just add til moist, then add as it's cooking, if necessary.  I like my stuffing moist, and my husband likes it dry, so I removed the lid the last 45 m. or so, and it was perfect.  I cooked it on high for 45 m. then low for 4 hrs.  Put it all together the night before, added eggs and broth in the morning, and forgot about it!  This is the only way I'll ever make stuffing again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very easy to prepare.  Used the prepared bread cubes from Pepperidge Farms to make things easier.  Only used about 2 cups of chicken broth.  The slow cooker was a brillant idea because the turkey is truly taking over the oven.

Not bad.... While I prefer my MIL's stuffing MUCH better (it's the BOMB!), this is decent enough to serve alongside a weeknight meal. Stove Top brand stuffing is much more flavorful IMHO, but you get what you pay for - it's pre-processed and loaded with a TON of salt (but it's soooo good!). I guess I'm just one of those wierdos who prefer the packaged stuff lol. NOTE #1: Start with HALF the amount of liquid called for. As many reviewers have suggested, the amount of broth you'll need really depends on the type of bread you are using (i.e. fresh, stale or crouton-like sutffing cubes). I used dried cubes (and ommitted the mushrooms called for) and found that ~ 1 3/4 c. liquid (1 1/2 c. added initially and the rest mid-way thru cooking) was spot on. A good dose of common sense is critical to achieve optimal results. For instance, if you add mushrooms, they will RELEASE moisture. You'll likely need LESS broth because of this. If you use a drier bread, you'll need more broth, etc., etc. NOTE #2: The towel trick REALLY works (it prevents condensation on your sc lid from dripping into your stuffing). Al in all, I'm glad to have given your recipe a try but it will never replace my MIL's secret recipe. :( Thanks anyways, Gayle!

OMG I will never make stuffing out of a box again! I've made delicious stuffing from scratch before, but being able to use the slow cooker saves SO much time and counter space.  My husband and I are expats in Germany, and every year we have people from all over the world celebrate Thanksgiving with us.  You never know if people will like our traditional food, but I got compliments from an Italian man, a Chinese woman, a Dutch couple, a German couple, and my husband.  This dish definitely made me proud last Thanksgiving, so vielen dank for that!

Based on other reviews I used less broth; tasted delicious but dried out.  Need to watch how much broth you use and monitor the cooking time accordingly.  Not a crock pot recipe that you can "set and forget".

I tried this recipe for the first time for Christmas this year and was thrilled with the results.  One caution is DO NOT put more than the recommended dry herbs in the mixture.  I thought it seemed a bit bland in the initial form so added a bit more sage and poultry seasoning.  Mistake.  It was not horrible, but certainly would have been better had I stuck with the recommended amounts.  This is my go-to recipe for stuffing from now on.  Thanks Gayle for sharing this awesome and easy  recipe.  Happy New Year 2012!

Made it for Thanksgiving and the family said it was okay.  I liked it but did not love it.  I used about 3 1/2 cups broth so it was not soggy.  I also used pepperidge farm seasoned bread cubes.  I will try another recipe before using this one again.  But in a pinch this will work.

This was awesome!  I made this EXACTLY as the recipe stated, except I omitted mushrooms.  It was wonderful.  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving and I'm making it again for Christmas.  I did not think it was too moist at all (like some said).  This time I will use sage and onion flavored breadcrumbs to give it a little more flavor, but really it was just fine with the herb flavored breadcrumbs I used.  I just like things bold.  This ones a keeper for sure.

I followed the reviews and only added about 1/2 the broth.  I also added 1lb of sausage.  Flavor was great, but it had a weird pillowy texture.  I suspected it might be too soft with the slow cooker, and I was right.  I won't be making it again.

I left out the marjoram and mushrooms and only put enough broth in to moisten the mixture. After cooking for a few hours(as the edges browned), I added a bit more. Total, I used less than two 12 oz. cans of broth. About an hour before we ate, I drained the liquid and cooked uncovered on high. Crispy on the outside, perfect, non-mushy consistency on the inside. This was the first dish gone and people fought over the last piece! I will try a crock pot liner next time for even easier clean-up.

After other dinner is over, my husband removes most of the meat from the carcass, then after removing any remaining stuffing from the crock pot (no need to wash) I add the carcass to the pot, cover with water, add some celery, onion, and a carrot and cook on low all night.  In the morning I have a wonder broth for soup. This idea can be used with any dressing.

I CANNOT tell you how wonderful this recipe is!  I tweaked it just a bit...used 14 cups of DRY bread cubes (let them sit out overnight), and I added craisins and some chopped pecans...oh, and crimini mushrooms rather than regular.  I only put in about 1-1/4 c. broth to moisten it, and it was perfect.  It was in the crockpot from 10:30-5:30. I did, however, have to leave the lid off from 1:00 on, because I was afraid it was too wet.  The lid holds the moisture in...  I'll make this again and again.  Everyone raved about it!

2 cups broth is plenty for us.  One 12 oz loaf of thin sliced white bread (local store brand, square slice) that we diced up on Tuesday, and set out to dry in the plastic lids that came with the foil pans used for other dishes, worked nicely!

This was good and so easy.  I left out the mushrooms and extra seasonings (besides poultry seas. and parsley).  I boiled the giblets in water for an hour or two and used that "broth" plus additional chicken broth to get to the level of moistness we wanted.  It was so nice to be able to plug in the slow cooker instead of trying to juggle so many things in the oven!

We enjoyed this stuffing, but I cut back on the salt and still found it to be a tad too salty.  I only needed 3 cups of chicken broth for the texture stuffing we like.  My slow cooker cooks very hot, (even on low), so my stuffing started to burn after a couple of hours.  Next time I will probably skip cooking it on high and leave it on low for the whole time.

Turned out great using exact recipe, with the exception of leaving on high longer. It shortened up the process.  I would have added a little more sage but everyone loved it.  Never would have thought of using slow cooker for this. Came out moist and delicious .  This recipe is a keeper.

Didn't work at all for me; I made it exactly as written. I won't ever make this again. I checked on it after four hours and it was so, so well done as to appear and taste almost burnt. Maybe if I had checked at 3 hours. Still, this recipe isn't going to happen for me.

This is a great, and delicious, recipe!  I make it every Thanksgiving now.  Using the slow cooker is great, because it frees up the oven and range for the other food, which makes it easier to serve everything hot all at once.

I have been cooking this recipe for three years for Thanksgiving.  After I made it the first year, I have been expected to bring the stuffing each year.  Everyone loves it!  I add a tube of sage sausage to it as well.

Very easy and tasted great. Turned out mushy but that's ok for me. I'm not a texture person. Tasted very much like a boxed stuffing so if you are looking for something more original you should try something else.

First time I made slow cooker stuffing.
Took to a potluck, was so easy/convenient. Will never make anything else from now on. Everyone loved it. One lady said it was the best she had ever tasted! I used the seasoned cubes version.

This is my go to recipe for stuffing during the holidays.  I dont change a a thing except the broth amount.  I sort of eyeball it as I go so it doesnt get too mushy.  Everything else is right on cue!

I used "day old" crusty bakery bread and less broth (since I wasn't using super-dry bagged cubes).  I think there is too much butter.  Or maybe I should have used more bread than called for.  After using the crockpot, I had oven space so I spread it on a roasting pan and baked for about 10 min at 350 to dry it out and crisp some edges.  I'll try it again sometime.  Next time, I'll add some chicken to the slow-cooker and call it a meal.

I did not care too much for this stuffing.  I found the stuffing to be very wet, without much flavor.  Reading the other reviews, I guess I could have tried other things to keep the moisture down, but I wanted a recipe I could put in and forget about while cooking.  I did use less liquid than called for, but it didn't help. If I have to pamper it, it is not really a good slow cooker recipe.

Tasted good. Just as good as stove top I think. Be sure to add broth gradually to the bread mix. Mine turned out really mushy (too much broth) and I had to put it in the oven to dry it out. It was a big hit though and no one believed that it was from scratch.

Tons of flavor!  Using fresh sage made a huge difference in this recipe.  It was also nice being able to make this in the crock pot which freed up space in the oven for all the other Thanksgiving dishes.  This one will be used again next year.

Wow - this was great. So nice not to have something else to put in the oven during Thanksgiving preparations. I watched the amount of broth to be sure it wasn't too soupy even though I do prefer my stuffing moist. Also used half fresh bread and half bagged stuffing.  Definitely making this again.

The taste was great!  But the stuffing really fell apart and crumbled, it was all moist but still crumbled.

Sorry, I just didn't like this.  It was kind of glue-y.  I like stuffing that gets a little more crisp on top, and I think this recipe helped me realize that.  It tasted good, I just didn't like the texture.

This tasted great but mine was mushy. I thought I was being careful to not add too much broth but apparently I did (and I only used 2 cups). Will try again with store bought bread crumbs. I think mine were too fresh. Flavor was wonderful though.

Excellent! I halved this. I did add some cooked Jimmy Dean hot sausage, dried cranberries and chestnuts to the mix and FORGOT to add the egg. It was just fine without it. Due to the warnings, I watched it cook through the day and didn't add all the broth but I did have to add just a tad more part way through.  This is a definite keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving to try and cut back on the oven pandemonium.  I had my doubts and feared it might come out a soggy mess.  I was delighted to find a delightful, tasty dressing with a little crunch on top.  I only used 1 can chicken broth for the moisture and popped my crock in the oven uncovered for 10 minutes before serving.

I agree w/ Need A Little Help.  I only used a 1/2 C of broth and it was still too soggy! After the called for time I put it in the oven for an hour hoping 2 dry it out some and had no luck. Thank god I didn't make this for a crowd.  Maybe too much butter...maybe it only needs 1 egg, but not 4 cups of broth.  I dont't understand how anyone can rate this a 5 Star and excellent!  This would have been soup if I had added all 4 cups of broth, no joke.  Everyone who made this to the T had to of ended up w/ soup.  All I can say is there must b a mistake in the ingredients.

Saved oven space and could put together ahead and stored in fridge for even more time saved on Thanksgiving. Received many compliments. Loved it, thanks for sharing and I will definitely make this again!

Make plenty of this because you will want the leftovers. Its just as good reheated as the first time around. I dried out a loaf of bread which was not completely hard when I cooked it so I only ended up using less than 2 cups of broth.

This would have been much better if it hadn't had a pound of butter to soak in.  I would suggest just using one stick of butter.  If using salted butter, keep in mind that you won't need to add a lot of salt.  I added some giblets to the mix.

This recipe was the reason I joined allrecipes. The stuffing was delicious and not one bite was left after making it for the 1st time yesterday for Thanksgiving. I took the time to read every review and like most, didn't use as much broth, but close to it since my slow cooker tends to run hot. Every person (all 18) went back for seconds and a few even asked for the recipe. Thank you! Wonderful smelling, wonderful tasting!

I love the fact that you can put it together and forget about it, especially around the holidays!  I was making it with my son and he poured in the entire 4 1/2 broth which was way too much liquid.  We added 3 cups more bread cubes and it was perfect.  I did not do the 45min on high setting, I just cooked it for 4 hrs on low and it was great. This says it serves 16 but we served it with 11 people and it was gone!

Fantastic - followed the advice of a couple people on here and added two cloves of garlic.  Also didn't add all the broth it called for.  I used store bought pre-dried cubes and only needed about 2 1/2 cups.  It turned out great, to rave reviews from friends.

WOW.  I would give and extra star for freeing up the oven on Thanksgiving day!  I will never try to rush and cook 4 side dishes while the Turkey is resting again.  After reading this recipe, I wondered how many other things can I cook in the crock pot and was pleased to see mashed potatoes and green bean casserole among them.  This recipe is almost identical to my mom's, except I have never put eggs in my stuffing and we never actually measured when cooking stuffing.  The stuffing came out perfect.  Everyone was worried that it wouldn't get that toasted crust that they love, but the stuffing on the bottom of the crock pot was actually toasted.  I don't know if it was the egg, but the stuffing had a great fluffy texture.  I did not have any problem with the amount of liquid, but I make my own bread cubes and do not know if that is the difference or not.  It must have been destiny to find this recipe because the Turkey took an extra hour and I was glad that all the sides were done.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

So I read these reviews over and over to see if I had missed something, but as far as I can tell, no one else tried toasting the bread. I always make stuffing, in the slow-cooker or not, with toasted bread cubes (or "dried" as this recipe says). Then the bread acts as a sponge for all the yummy broth taste, and still keeps it shape, and is crusty and good. I halved the recipe and probably used about 2 cups of broth. I added it slowly so I would not over do.  I prepped the bread- cubing it and toasting it the night before, then tossed  with with the herbs and stored it in a zip lock. I prepped the veggies the night before and kept them in a tupper in the fridge. The next day, all I had to do was saute, mix, then throw in the crock pot. So easy! I stirred carefully about every 45 mins and added stock as needed. I left lid off the last 45 minutes, which made the top nice and crusty. Just toast the bread cubes and this recipe works great.

It was good, but nothing special.  Mine also burned around the edges and bottom.  I took the lid off near the end because I found it still too wet.

This was a big hit! I used a box of Classic Stuffing from the grocery store plus most of a loaf of French bread which I cubed and let air dry for two days. I did not use mushrooms but added pork sausage and one diced apple. Delicious! Using the crock pot is the way to go. I uncovered it the last hour and it had just the right amount of moisture and crispness (add broth only as needed, as suggested). I can't wait to make this again. I might add another apple next time, and I want to try adding some cornbread. Thanks so much, Gayle!

This was a big hit! I used a box of Classic Stuffing from the grocery store plus most of a loaf of French bread which I cubed and let air dry for two days. I did not use mushrooms but added pork sausage and one diced apple. Delicious! Using the crock pot is the way to go. I uncovered it the last hour and it had just the right amount of moisture and crispness (add broth only as needed, as suggested). I can't wait to make this again. I might add another apple next time, and I want to try adding some cornbread. Thanks so much, Gayle!

I made this according to the directions.  I added about 2 1/2 cups of broth and that was more than enough.  I made my own bread cubes a few days before from a variety of different breads for a variegated color.  I used baby bella mushrooms and they tasted great.  Everyone loved this and I will definitely be adding it to my permanent Thanksgiving menu.  Having the extra space in the oven was wonderful and the stuffing came out so nice and moist - like it had been cooked in the turkey.  At one point, when it was almost done, it did get a little bit of moisture pooling up at the bottom of the pot.  I just took the lid off for about 20 minutes and it evaporated.  The stuffing was perfect.

As with ANY recipe I try here at Allrecipes.com, I keep an eye on the entire process, and modify according to my personal taste/desired results. I am making this stuffing for the 4th year, and I have never gotten a bad review of it. My family likes apples in their stuffing, but half of them don't care for mushrooms. Some like Cubbisons dressing mix, some prefer real dried bread that we collect throughout the year in the freezer. My suggestion is that you WATCH what you are doing. This recipe inspired me to make many things in crock pots during the holidays. I beat my eggs into the broth mixture before pouring over the bread and veggies. Everything is coated nicely, and I don't stir anything. THe moisture spreads during the cooking process.

Not the most appealing stuffing to serve, but the flavor is FANTASTIC!!! I wasn't a big mushroom fan, but tried it with Baby Bella's, and it added a wonderful rich flavor. I use seasoned dryed cubes (bag) and add only poultry seasoning. I prepare it the night before (minus the eggs), and then put it all together in the morning, cook on low and check for moistness every hour. DEFINITELY use the trick with a towel across the top to absorb extra moisture.

I have to start by saying that I come from a family who did not let a holiday pass without Stove Top stuffing.  After trying this recipe out a few years ago, the boxed stuff is now a thing of the past... I never would've believed it!  This is now our family's go-to stuffing recipe... delicious!!  I cut an Italian bread loaf into cubes and toast them in the oven the day before.  The next day I cook everything in the slowcooker, except I leave out the mushrooms (we're not fans) and some of the extra spices besides poultry seasoning & sage.  I use up to 3 full cans of chicken broth (depending on how dry the bread is) and it comes out PERFECT every time!  You can also prep all the veggie's the night before, so when you're busy the next day in the kitchen, this comes together so easily.  If you're looking for the best & easiest stuffing recipe ever, then this is it!

It tasted great! The only problem is, the stuffing comes out a little jello-ie because of all the liquid. Next time I might reduce the amount of liquid.

This stuffing is phenomenal!  You can easily cut the butter in half and still keep the moistness of the dish.  Start with 2 cups of broth and add more if you need it (you probably won't).  I also used fresh herbs.

LOVED IT!!! I read the other comments about the broth... I used only about a cup and a half of the broth and thought I would put more in later if it needed it and it didn't. I also mixed in the stuffing from the turkey.

I agree with others that 4.5 cups of broth seems like a misprint. I used 2 cups. I loved it - very good and so much easier to deal with on Thanksgiving Day.

It was good, but I over cooked it somehow. The edges were burnt. It had a good taste though. Will make again but will really watch it.

Followed others suggestions and used my own bread crumbs (challah bread) and 2-2 1/2 cups broth, and also added sage sausage.  It was mushy (I think it's supposed to be more wet to have that "in the bird" consistency) but it tasted great.  I loved the freed up oven space, but considering I never have cared for stuffing in-the-bird, I think I will use this recipe but bake it next year.  Also, I'd suggest a crock pot liner!

My first stuffing! The broth amount and bread consistency are key to the success of this recipe. We went to a local Oregon bakery and picked up loaves of just baked artisan and multi-grain breads and sliced into cubes then baked at 250 for 25 minutes (checking frequently).  The hearty, chewy texture of the bread was very successful with this recipe as it did not become soggy during the cooking process.  We added 2.5 cups of stock (just enough to moisten) and a pound of crumbled, cooked sage sausage.  I did stir it after the first hour in the pot and then occasionally during the cooking time.  This was necessary as the stuffing becomes very brown on the bottom.  I agree that the high setting may not be needed since all the crock pot process is doing is re-incorporating the bread with the stock and other flavors.  Many of the 17 folks at our dinner were interested in how this recipe would turn out and we were all pleased with the results.

I made this last year- just something to think about: at this time of year deli counters are roasting turkeys for office parties etc.  I bought several large containers of turkey broth, simmered it for a while to reduce and used it in place of the chicken broth... a little change but makes it even more like the old fahioned "in the bird" flavor.  Thanks for this recipe- what an easy way to make great stuffing!!!

This was a simple recipe and worked well for a large group.  I made it for a holiday potluck at work.  I browned sage sausage and the vegetables the night before and cooled overnight in the fridge.  In the morning I mixed everything together and took it to work in my slow cooker.  At lunch I turned it on and by dinner it was perfect.  I will definately make this again.

I have always made box stuffing.  This was my first attempt at "homemade" stuffing and my husband couldn't stop raving about it!
Changes I made were:
*Using bagged stuffing, about 1 &1/2 bags.
*I didn't measure my chicken broth.  I got consistancy I was looking for like when I make boxed stuffing. 
*My seasoning was 2 tsp of poultry seasoning, instead of all the other stuff.
Perfect way to free up some room in your oven!

This was absolutely perfect for our Thanksgiving meal (9 people, half of whom are EXTREMELY picky eaters) this year!  I especially loved having the extra space in my oven!

I definitely made a few tweaks to the recipe to make it more "my own."  I used a mixture of croissants and good Italian white bread that I had cubed and dried in my oven.  Plus, when I melted the butter, I added the dried herbs in with the onion/celery/mushrooms, so that the herbs would eventually be evenly distributed throughout the bread mixture.

Finally, I added the chicken broth only a little at a time.  I didn't need nearly as much broth as the recipe calls for, as my bread was a little more fresh than the original recipe uses.

All in all I highly recommend this recipe, and it will certainly be used again!

The idea of making stuffing in a crockpot and freeing up the oven is brilliant! I would give this recipe a 5 for flavor, but as written only a four. It calls for too much liquid. I started with 2 cups and added one more cup after 45 min and that was all I ever added.

I made this for Easter dinner and received rave reviews.  This filling was a huge hit!!  It is extremely easy to make.  The seasoning tasted wonderful.  Next time I will not add all the broth at once I will space it out.  This will definetly be the only filling I make!

This has got to be my most favorite Thanksgiving recipe!  The only alteration is I usually only add half as much mushrooms as recommended.  I love this recipe because I don't have to use up oven space but mostly because of the awesome taste.  I always toast the bread for this recipe, it adds color to the bread as well as helps the bread hold some of its shape.

I think I will always make my stuffing in the crock pot from now on--the method was wonderful.  I varied the recipe somewhat, however, by using seasoned stuffing cubes (white and cornbread).  I used the poultry seasoning, but did not add the extra herbs since the bread was already seasoned.  I omitted the mushrooms, and did not add eggs.  I also added some cubes of homemade pumpkin bread about 2 hours before I served it.  This was a different touch.  I guess I'm rating the method more than the recipe itself, since I made so many changes, but the method is foolproof!!  Thanks so much!

I make this whenever i make a turkey or chicken dinner.  Its always been a hit and i've been making it for about 4 years.  I omit mushrooms and cut the veggies so tiny you can barely tell they are there.  I also can never tell how much broth i will be using until i'm done cooking it.  Sometimes I only use 2 cups and sometimes i use all of it.  I usually pour 2 cups worth in at the beginning and I check every hour to see how dry it is and I add more and give it a stir.  It prevents the outsides from getting too crusty.  Also since some family members prefer their stuffing drier than others, I'll take out some stuffing early and let the rest cook with the lid off on high for a while.  It works everytime.

For Thanksgiving our family went to the desert and so I could not use the generator in our motorhome all day to do the crockpot way so instead the day before we left I cooked the veggies (omitted mushrooms), used and cooked 1 1lb. of sage flavored sausage, and made a loaf of beer bread (cubed bread and dried out in oven), let all cool and put in plastic baggies. Thanksgiving day I mixed all the pre-made ingredients with the rest of what recipe calls for (minus sage since it was in the sausage) and baked in oven.  I also poured melted butter over the top to give it that great buttery flavor. The only thing I forgot was to add the eggs, I brought them but forgot about em. Every single person that was with us complemented me on how this was the best stuffing they had ever had and it didn't even have the eggs. I am going to make this for Christmas but instead of sage sausage and I going to use linguica like someone else suggested because our family is Portuguese and linguica is Portuguese sausage.

This is a PERFECT way to get all the stuffing people want, without taking up more valuable oven space. This made great stuffing!

Only change I made was to add some linguica sausage for our taste. Excellent and easy. Thanks so much for the recipe and the idea!

The flavor of this was great, and it saves so much hassle being in the slow cooker instead of on the stove.  I'll cut back on the liquid next time because it was just a little too wet for our taste.  I also did half shiitake and half baby portabella mushrooms instead of button mushrooms and used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian suitable.

As others suggested I cut the chicken broth in half. and i forgot to put in the egg.  But it still came out pretty good just a little mushy and i only put it on for four hours.

I made this for a family turkey dinner today and I was very impressed! I did make a few minor changes by adding a tsp of savory and a little extra pepper for taste.  Also, I can see that it would be very easy to overdo the chicken broth. I didn't add very much, just enough to barely moisten the bread and any more would have made it a little too moist.  All of my family have now asked for the recipe!

This is the best.  Due to having some vegetarians at Thanksgiving I used veggie broth in place of chicken broth.  Couldn't tell a difference.  I also omitted the mushrooms.  This will be a regular at Thanksgiving in my house.

I made this just like it said, but instead, made them into suffin' muffins by putting them into muffin tins and then baking them at 350 for 15 min.  Gives them a crunch.  YUM.

I made this for our Thanksgiving celebration last year and it was AWESOME!  I've never made a turkey, let alone stuffing before and this was a big hit.  Mixed it up the night before and put on in the morning for noon lunch...was ready after 4 hours on low.  Didn't use as much broth.  A definate keeper!  Thanks!

AMAZING!!!  i was really nervous about this b/c of the "broth factor" but it ended up PERFECT.  i used several kinds of bread to get different textures - sourdough rolls, everything bagels, and a pecan raisin bread boule.  i let the bread sit out and get stale but then also put them in a warm oven on cookie sheets over night and let them get really crunchy.  i scaled the recipe to 8 (but actually used about 7 c of bread) and used a can of broth - and everything else called for.  i stirred it frequently - every time tasting it, so i almost had no stuffing to share!  really, it was even better than i'd hoped - i can't wait to make it again for christmas!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and was dissapointed.  The flavor was good, but the texture was terrible.  I read the reviews beforehand and used less broth (2 cups), but it still was gummy.  Based on all the great reviews, I may experiment with it again to see what I may have done wrong.

I used 2 cans of chicken stock (a little less than 4 cups) and it was too moist.  I suggest using 1 1/2 cans or 2 1/2 to 3 cups of stock.  However, the flavor is great and everyone loved it.

Other than the fact that this recipe was made in the crock pot, therefore leaving more space in the oven, there was no other upside to it.  I have used the Awesome Apple, Sausage and Cranberry Stuffing off this site for years and this is the first year I attempted to make something different to save me time, etc., but I just didn't think it was all that great...I know everyone has their own aquired taste, this is just not mine.  I did follow other reviewers advice and only added 2 cans of broth but unfortunately, I still ended up with mush (even after I added more bread cubes than what it called for).  Sorry Gayle!

I thought this stuffing was great as did everyone who tried it at Thanksgiving this year. I did use some common sense and only put in about half of the chicken broth and I also added a pound of sausage I precooked and chopped. I cut back on the butter too, it seemed like it could get too greasy with all of that butter, I only cooked it for 4 hours which was plenty! 8 hours and I would have ended up with a black stuffing brick! I just kept it on low and watched it, if I felt it was getting dry I added just a touch more broth and it came out just wonderful, it is definately the best stuffing I have made in my wife/mommy years to date! I highly recommend using this recipe just use some common sense along with it.

This stuffing is fantastic!  My mother made this for Thanksgiving.  It's your standard stuffing recipe but all the ingredients come together to make this an outstanding stuffing recipe.  I'll definitely be making this for myself and other holidays.

This stuffing is so delicious...my husband and I ate it before we could take it to my daughters house for Thanksgiving...We had to make more and take that.  We did eliminate the mushrooms and watch the broth...it can get soggy.  It is wonderful to be able to cook it in the crockpot.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This stuffing was awesome!  The only deviation that I made from the recipe was that I added all of the spices to the melted butter/onion mixture, instead of adding it later.  I figured it would get mixed in better that way.  I only used 2 cups of broth and that seemed to be enough.  This is the only stuffing recipe I will ever use again.  it was great!

This really is the best stuffing!  I don't add quite the suggested amount of broth--it seems to get too mushy if you do.  I add about 2 cups, and it comes out perfect.  It's great because you can make it early in the day before you get too busy, and you don't have to take up space in the much used oven.  It also comes out moist every time, unlike traditional baked stuffings.

This is the first time I used a crock pot to make stuffing but it was definitely a success!!  I ended up using about 2.5 cups of the broth because my family likes stuffing a little more firm/crunchy than the traditional stuffing.  To help it get drier for serving, I just took the lid of the crock pot for about 45 minutes.  My finicky uncle even had seconds!  I will absolutely use this recipe for all my holiday dinners!

This delicious, moist stuffing is great because it's one less pot on the stove!

This was the best stuffing I have ever made!  I had so many compliments, especially from my 89 year old Aunt.  That to me was the highest compliment one could ever receive.

This was really good.  I just used actual bread crumbs and I should have used the packaged bread cubes.  I had to add a lot more water and broth, but it still tasted good.

I was grilling a turkey and decided to try this for a side dish. As someone suggested, I made it the night  before and cooked it the next morning. I also added the chopped giblets and neck meat from the turkey. This was almost as good as my stuffing cooked in the bird. As suggest, I used half the broth and half of the butter.  It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. Six people devoured a recipe made for 16.  Will make again!

Followed the recipe. Mom passed many moons ago and 1st year I tried to make stuffing just from the visual I had in my head and failed. Ten more since then for Christmas I made this and it was pretty tasty compared to my sad affair that first year.  liked how the spices mingled.

This was a great recipe, and very simple. I made it for an office Thanksgiving potluck, and several people said that they enjoyed it. I did make some changes from the original recipe though. Instead of 1 cup of butter (2 sticks), I only used half a cup of butter (1 stick) to cook the vegetables. I also added 1 lb of country sausage, as well as some chopped cranberries to the stuffing mix. For the bread cubes, I used the store bought ones and I did not use the entire recommended 4.5 cups of chicken broth. I added the chicken broth in small amounts as it cooked, and I ended up using a little over 3 cups. I had the dish on high for about 45 minutes, and then it cooked on low for 2.5 hours and it was ready in time for our potluck. The only change I'd make in the future is to cut down the amount of salt in the recipe, especially if adding sausage or using store bought bread cubes.

I read through a lot of the reviews before making this since I was making this for Christmas dinner.  I heeded the advice about the amount of broth.  I used Martin's Cubed Potato Bread (soft, not hard) so I only poured in maybe 2-2.5 cups.  However it was still way too moist, even with the lid off the Crockpot for about 2 hours.  I was surprised that maybe only 1-2 reviewers mentioned that there was too much butter.  This was in fact the problem.  I initially thought the amount was too much but since not many people complained I added the full amount.  Honestly with this amount of butter, you probably do not need any broth!  I ended up scooping out some of the butter in the Crockpot.  The stuffing did firm up some when it cooled.  There were mixed reviews about the burnt parts - some liked it, some didn't.  The taste of the stuffing itself was excellent.  Next time, I will half or even quarter the amount of butter and probably just cook it in the oven. Edit 12-25-2017: Ok, so I accidentally bought the stuffing that was hard- a mistake due to me not being prepared and hurried. I followed this recipe, forgetting that I used the soft stuffing in the past. I needed to add more broth (about 3 cups total) and more butter (than the half I usually do). Came out fine, but really emphasizes what kind of stuffing you use and to check it every 30minutes or so.

Great recipe! Super easy and makes enough to feed a crowd. I have made this the past two Thanksgivings and will be making again this week for T-Day 2015.  I use Pepperidge Farms Seasoned Bread Cubes, then I omit the other seasonings it calls far as the cubes are already seasoned.  This makes it even easier to whip together.  I also add a pound (or two.  Depends if I am on a diet that year or not! ha) of browned sage sausage.   Please keep in mind that those people that say this is too "soupy" did not follow the directions. You add the broth as needed. So, you may not need it all.  The type of bread you use and the dryness of your climate can make a difference on how much liquid is needed. I also followed another suggestion from a reviewer and placed a clean dish towel between the Crockpot and its lid to collect condensation.  Clever idea.  It worked like a charm.  Just prior to serving I added some dried cranberries. Huge hit!  Lots of flavor! I will make this every year and pass the recipe onto my kids.

I don't usually like homemade stuffing, but this was excellent!  The amount of liquid you use will depend on how dry your bread is - hence the "as needed" in the ingredient list and "pour enough broth to moisten" in the directions.  It's your own fault if you ignored those details and used too much broth.  I used the pre-packaged dry bread cubes and ended up using all 4 1/2 cups.  I used 4 cups at first, and added another 1/2 cup towards the end because it looked too dry.  Remove the lid if it looks too wet.

I'm giving it 5 stars for flavour. Only issue is that the bottom really got dry and brown after only 4 hours so I'll advice you to use all the broth it calls for and to stir it once in a while.
Thanks for a great recipe, we'll never run out again.

Just made this on Saturday for a turkey dinner party (9 people) it was UH-MAZING!!! Everybody asked for the recipe. After years of looking for the right stuffing recipe, I've finally found it...definitely a keeper. The only thing I don't agree with is the 4-8 hours in the slow cooker...Ours was done in 2 hours, I left it in 3 just because the recipe called for more time.

start with 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth and and as needed.
If you prefer a dryer stuffing,bake it in a casserole dish on the top rack at 350 for an hour befor serving.
It is delicious!

I debated whether or not to risk trying a new stuffing method since that is one of the favorites on Thanksgiving Day.  So glad I did, and will never make it any other way than the slow cooker!  Used two 1lb. loaves of Italian bread, cubed and dried out for several weeks, about 16 cups. I have a Cuisinart slow cooker that sautes/browns, so sauted chopped onions and celery while mixing my bread cubes with the broth, (about 3 1/2 cups), 1/2 lb. cooked sausage, eggs, and seasonings to taste, no salt was used.  Added the veggies to the bread mixture, and threw it all in the slow cooker.  Cooked on high for 30 minutes, and low until dinner, which was about 5 hours later.  Using the towel under the lid is a necessity, and the stuffing stays so moist that even though I checked it every hour, I used very little, if any additional broth.  I've made the same recipe for 21 years, and I was told this was the best year year ever!

The key to a good dressing is the preparation. Mix all the dry ingredients together with the sautéed vegies and add the chicken broth and add some whole milk/cream to it I use 3 1/2 cup chicken broth with 1 cup whole milk the night before and then cover and put in refrigerator over night. The next day mix up prior to putting into the crock pot. The flavor will be so rich.

One more thing, I take the giblets from the turkey and boil into a broth and use that as my broth (add 1 onion and 3 celery stocks with salt and pepper). the liver I dice up into small pieces and add to dressing when I put it into the crock pot.

I followed recipe exactly.  Bought big bag of dried bread cubes at grocery that they always have for Thanks Giving.  I followed recipe exactly.  Flavor was excellent but dressing was pretty wet/mushy.  Next time I will use less chicken broth.  Maybe 3 cups or less.  I like stuffing moist but a little fluffy too.  Will make again, everyone loved it.  edit:  used 2 cups broth and it was much better!!  Fed 8 people with lots leftover.

i make this almost every Thanksgiving. It is moist and tastes similar to Stove top. sometimes i use preseasoned cubes, other times, plain & add spices in the recipe. either way it's a great way to save oven space on Thanksgiving.

Amazing! Will be making this every year for our Holiday dinners. I used the store bought dried bread cubes and enough broth to soak them and then added as needed. Just be sure check it every half hour or so to see if it has enough broth and doesn't dry out. If you've added too much broth, keep the lid off the last hour and it will be perfect! So good!

I've made this twice now over the last year and honestly I will NEVER make stuffing in the oven again.   This kept it moist and delicious and as close to in-the-bird stuffing as you're going to get.  Like other reviews have stated, don't just dump all the broth in - add it as needed.  I don't think I've ever used the total amount indicated in this recipe.  SOOOO GOOD!!  Thanks!!

With one small change it was perfect! Like the previous reviewers, I also decreased the chicken stock to 2.5 cups. I had to stir the stuffing see real times throughout the day to prevent it from burning on the bottom. I stuck it in the oven for 20 minutes just prior to serving to get a little crispiness on top. Great flavor and perfectly moist with the one ingredient change. Will use this every year from now on!

I have made this exact recipe for the past several years for Thanksgiving feeding about 25-30 people. Since the first time I made it I have been assigned this part of the meal every year. Not sure why other reviewers are having such a hard time with it being soggy, that has never happened to me. I use the hard bread crumbs, if that helps. Now that I moved away and am not hosting Thanksgiving anymore my family is now asking for this recipe to carry on the tradition. Awesome recipe! Been loving it for years1

I was skeptical but it turned out great. It was a life saver to not have to stuff the turkey and still have delicious stuffing. I stuffed the turkey with big chunks of vegetables (garlic, onion, carrots, celery) with a couple of bay leaves. The turkey came out juicier than when I used to stuff it with traditional stuffing.

I like my stuffing crispy.  The flavor of this is wonderful, but it was too moist for me.  Maybe it's because I dumped all of the 4 c of chicken broth in at once.  Next year, I'd like to add it as needed.  I love the taste of celery, onions, and mushrooms as I take bites, but it was all mixed together as one mushy substance.  It sounds like we didn't like it, but it was all eaten by the 6 of us.  It's hard to find stuffing for the crock pot to cook while we're camping.  I know this can be perfected to be less moist.  It takes the longest of our dishes to make, but it's so worth it!

Caution - Way too much liquid - I would cut it in half. I really had to work it to get it to dry out. Flavor good though.

Good, with the addition of a few spices. I added an oregano/garlic blend- perhaps 1 1/2 tsp.

Put in crock pot for a little over 6 hours and I think it was WAY too long. Loved the flavors and recipe, just would only cook 4ish hours when I make it again. I added dried cranberries - a little sweet/tart addition to the savory!

The 4 to 8 hours for cooking time is way too long. The stuffing came out very, very mushy. I would try this again but only cook in crock pot for 3 hours. I also added cranberries. Next time I'll add water chestnuts or apples to help prevent mushiness.

I have made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas the last 3 years in a row and it always turns out awesome! I'm not a big stuffing eater (my Dad is the stuffing guy), but I LOVE this stuffing! I follow the recipe except I don't measure the broth. You have to use your judgement on that. As one reviewer suggested, add a little broth at first and then you have to taste the stuffing and add more as needed. You need to check on it several times throughout the day while it is cooking to adjust the seasonings and the broth to your taste. I don't measure when I cook anyways, just adjust based on your tastes! Also, I don't turn it up to high.. I just put it on low and let it cook while I'm working on other things.

This is my second time making this recipe. There is no reason to make stuffing any other way. It is easy and is absolutely delicious. I changed the herbs in the recipe, based on what I had on hand and it did not make a difference.

great stuffing! I didn;'t have marjoram so omitted it. I also didn't let the bread sit out harden so it was kind of soggy...taste was incredible!!! I also doubled the recipe and still only used about 3 cups of broth....it was wonderful - thanks for the idea! i needed the oven space and prepping everything the night before was easy

This is a great recipe, used it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Please read the recipe folks...it states 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth, or AS NEEDED. I started with 3 cups and added more as I needed. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onion and celery.

this was excellent!  and it sure solved the time coordination and space problem of serving Thanksgiving!  I was afraid of naysayers since there was no stuffing in the birds, but not a single complaint!  I read many of the reviews and played the liquid by ear - did not use all called for.  Used some bread cubes from ends I had saved, filled out with storebought bread cubes. I did use 3 eggs since our eggs were from our friends and smaller than commercial.  One of the kids told her mom the stuffing was "to die for!"

This was great and I'm going to use it as my goto stuffing recipe from now on.  Go easy on the broth like others said and it will turn out perfect.  Parts of it got pretty crispy so I added broth, but them I liked that too because it was really like it had been in the oven. Super easy!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it worked out well...moist and tasty.  I followed the advice of previous posters and used only 2.5 cups of broth instead of the 4.5 cups called for in the recipe.  I added one minced clove of garlic.  I used supermarket  dried bread cubes (one bag was about 6 cups) and one fresh loaf of French bread cut into cubes. I also left out the mushrooms for taste preference. It smells great while cooking and leaves the oven free for other side dishes.

I decided to try this out for Thanksgiving this year and it was so great! So easy to just throw the ingredients together in the crock pot and cook it all day while you work on other dishes. I took the advice of others and added the chicken stock about 1/2 cup at a time (about every hour) and ended up only using just under 3 cups and it came out perfect. An easy recipe to modify as well, we added toasted pecans at the end - this will become my standard dish from now on!

This was great!  I omitted hte mushrooms, garlic, and pepper, and doubled up on sage.  I started out with 1 cup of turkey broth I made from the turkey innards.  I added more as I needed it.  I did one hour on high and then 3-4 on low.  You do have to loosen the edges or they might burn, but the "crispy" part is good, too.  I added the stuffing from inside the birds.

This stuffing is awesome! I left out the mushrooms and added in a package of sage sausage. Did not precook. I just tore into bite size pieces and threw right in the crockpot. I also made a loaf of "French Bread Rolls To Die For" and a loaf of "French Baguettes" a few days in advance. Then the night before I cut up into cubes and toasted in the oven on 350 for about fifteen minutes. I also did not need all the liquid called for. Superb!

From now on my stuffing will be prepared in the crockpot.  I did a slight variation of the receipt.  I added Italian Sausage (1st cooked the sausage and added it to the mixture).

I liked the recipe, and LOVED the ease of using the crock pot.   I did find it a bit bland, will make it again, but will spice it up with more spices and perhaps some sausage.

I decided to use this recipe when I hosted my first Thanksgiving dinner in my small kitchen.  It was nice to have one less dish to make on/in the stove.  And I'm so glad I found this recipe because it was a BIG hit!  It was so moist, almost gooey, and easy to make.  I didn't add eggs as the recipe calls and honestly they are not needed.  I also made it vegetarian by using vegetable broth and veggie bouillon instead of chicken and meat eaters would never know.  It was DELICIOUS and I know the family will call for it every year.

Pretty good. Yes, its moist but it does say just to use the amount of broth neededc.  I used 2 cups and could've done less, but that's ok. I, too, keft the lid off for the last 45 minutes of cooking. Everyone but me seemed to love the mushrooms in it, but I hate mushrooms. This was a great way to make stuffing for us when the oven was completely full of turkey. Thanks for the recipe.

So good and so easy!  Prepped everything the night before, and as one reviewer wrote, I put everything except the egg in a bowl and refridgerated overnight.  The next morning I threw it all in the crockpot and had it on warm all day, added chicken stock as necessary.  It seriously could not have been easier and I got RAVE reviews.

This is the 2nd year I have made this for Thanksgiving and will never make any other recipe.  This is so easy and absolutely delicious.  I only had 3 other people and there was none left.  Plenty of other leftovers, no stuffing.  Need I say more!!

First time I have ever made stuffing that was not in a box. Mine didn't need to cook the entire time, but it was absolutely fabulous! Made with vegetable stock (use sense when adding the amount, 41/2 c may be too much for your bread) since I had 2 vegetarians and it was great. The next time I tried it, I made my own bread cubes because I could not find any that were not pre-seasoned. Has come out great every time. I highly recommend this recipe. I'm sure glad I found it.

I also use this recipe with a few tweeks. I cut the chicken broth to 1 cup and the butter to 3/4 cup; add 1 tsp. of chicken base, 3 T olive oil, and a can each of cream of mushroom & cream of celery soups (98% fat free).  It tastes great!

My husband tried making this yesterday (11/20) for a potluck at work on Monday.  Well to say the least, don't use 4 1/2 cups of broth or your stuffing will be mush.  He made it exactly as the recipe called for.  I felt so sorry for him that I made 2 boxes of scalloped potatoes for him to take.

I have been making this recipe for many years!  I usually make it for all family functions whenever we have turkey.  The recipe does say "just to moisten" I'm not sure how many cups I actually use - but it always turns out great and smells wonderful while cooking.

I'm finally getting around to reviewing this, from Thanksgiving! I just have to start off by saying that I am, wait... was a loyal box stuffing lover. However, this recipe easily replaced those boxes. It was so easy and tasted so amazing. I have a feeling I'll be making this again very soon!

Brilliant!!!  I agree that 4 1/2 cups of broth is a bit too much.  Maybe start with even 2 cups and adjust as needed.

Very good recipe. I started with just enough chicken broth to get the bread moist (about 2 cups), then added a little more each hour and stirred (which preventing me from over staturating). It was very moist without being mushy. Total time was about 5 1/2 hours.

Oh dear! This only needs about 1/2 cup of butter.  It was very very tasty but I had to strain off the butter and put in the oven to try and dry out the stuffing.

This turned out fantastic! I used one loaf of fresh french bread at Whole Foods and it equaled 12 cups exactly. I toasted 1/2 cubes in the oven until they were lightly browned and "crunchy." I also used No-Chicken Broth in lieu of chicken broth. I did not need the full 4 cups of broth, instead only using about 3 and even that was maybe a 1/4 cup too much. Around 3 hours into cooking I removed the lid to allow some of the moisture to evaporate. Perfect!!!! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

The taste was great - but I did have to cook it an additional hour at least for it to dry out a little. I used dry bread cubes and 3 cups of broth was still too much.

Perfect taste and absolutely no fuss. I was able to fix everything else without worrying about the stuffing. I added fresh sage and thyme. I also only used 2 cups chicken broth. I couldn't find bread cubes, so I just bought some baguettes and tore them apart the day before Thanksgiving. This gave the bread some time to dry. It was my first time making stuffing (first time I also made Thanksgiving dinner) and I was impressed!

I use herb flavored croutons instead of the bread, skipping the thyme, sage and dried marjoram since they are flavored already. I don't put all the broth in at first (about 2.5 to 3 cups), and add more as needed. I have made this for Thanksgiving family and work dinners, and never have leftovers. Turns out great everytime!

I read all the reviews and I admit I was nervous to try it for the first time on Thanksgiving Day itself! However, I used my common sense when I added the broth...I didn't add all 4 1/2 c at once. I stirred it in, and since I was in the kitchen all day, I checked it (and stirred in more broth) often. I was using packaged dry bread cubes and I'm sure I wound up using at least 4 1/2 cups of broth, if not a little more. I had a 6 cup box of broth and used almost all, but not all of it. Now that I know how the broth part works, I'll just add a lot more at the beginning to save having to add more as the day goes on. As for the rest of the recipe, the seasoning was perfect and nobody seemed to miss the "baked inside the turkey" taste. I'll be making this again on Christmas and probably next Thanksgiving, too--I put the seasonings in a tupperware the night ahead and chopped the veggies, and putting it all together the next morning was so easy, it felt like cheating!

This stuffing was the best stuffing I ever had! Made it for thanksgiving, just wish I would have listened to the tip about putting the towel between the lid. Didn't think I needed to at first because it wasn't so wet and soupy as others described, it was pretty evenly moist. The condensation from the lid made it mushy. I did follow a tip that said to cook uncovered to harden it up some, and i did that, but it still remained kinda mushy. It was tasty tasty tasty though! Added to my recipe box and will be making again!

This was very tasty. I liked the idea of using the crockpot to free up oven space. I used the very dry (plain) breadcrumbs from the store, and 2 cups of broth. I cooked it for 4 hours on low and it seemed soggy. So I took the lid off for about 1/2 hour and evaporated some of the liquid. Great flavor from the different seasonings. I would definitely make again.

My mother makes an unbelievable sweet and savory bread stuffing with raisins and celery that everyone in my family goes crazy for.  Any other stuffing has very big shoes to fill.  That said, some of the guests we invited for Thanksgiving this year do not like raisins, so I decided to try this recipe rather than just omit the raisins from the regular recipe.  Boy, did this recipe deliver!  I won't say it's better than my mother's stuffing, but it sure was good -- we got a lot of compliments!    I was able to speed up the cooking process by leaving it on high in the slow cooker and then transferring it to a pan and "toasting" the top in the oven.  I think we finished cooking it it in 4 or 5 hours, including prep time.  We pureed the mushrooms in the food processor so we could have the meaty mushroom flavor without the mushroom texture -- my husband can't stand the texture of mushrooms.  Thank you for making the stuffing a big hit!

Very good dressing.  Easy to put together, and I love the idea of cooking it in the slow cooker to save on oven space on busy holidays.  As other reviewers mention, only add broth as needed to moisten.  You can always add more if need be, but you can't take it away once you've added it.  Will use this recipe again.  Thanks.

Came out ok, was a little crispy on the edges although that may have been due to the type of slow cooker. Everyone liked it, even my husbnad who does not care fr stuffing. next time, I think I will add all littl emore bred crumbs and chicken broth to avoid the crispy parts. Was nice to have a thanksgiving stuffing that did not require much effort.

Super easy and yummy.  I added 1 lb sage sausage, ommitted onions and mushrooms (others preferences), and just used about 4 tsp poultry seasoning with a little pepper.    Do to time/travel issues, I actually ended up cooking it for a shorter period of time on high, but was careful to check that it wasn't drying out or burning.    We had a holiday dinner with friends last weekend, and there was not a bite left.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't change a thing, except I used vegetarian broth and added just a bit more than the recipe called for (maybe half a can).  Everyone loved it!

I have used this recipe for the past 4 years, delicious! Everyone loves it.  My boyfriend hates mushrooms, so I make half and half.  I don't change anything else, but I usually err on the side of more chicken broth.  To save stove space, I usually cook before hand and then quickly heat up after the turkey comes out.

I absolutely love the idea of having the stuffing made ahead of time and out of the way of the rest of the cooking. I also despise stuffing the actual bird! So this option sounded like a great one to me.  Luckily I tried it out ahead of time. The color of the stuffing was off (dark). I think this was due to me stirring it frequently to keep it from burning. The flavor was okay, not fabulous however. I used seasoned bread cubes since that is all that they had at the store I went to. I think this would be much better with plain bread cubes. And I will cut way down on the cooking time in the future (like 2-3 hours max). And, like others, I used less than half of the broth. Overall good recipe, just need to adjust it to my preferences. Edit: Made this again for Thanksgiving. This time I stirred it very little. I only cooked it about 3 hours and it was perfect. I added turkey drippings to it right before serving. Yum!

This just didn't work for us.  It had the weirdest "rubbery" texture.  The ingredients seem right, and the flavor was ok, just weird weird texture.  Think I'll have to stick with oven.  Thanks anyway.

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  good!  Added a little more sage (I like it sagey!) and it tasted just as good if not (dare I say it) better than my mom's! Easier too! Even my husband ate it and he HATES traditional stuffing.

People are still begging me to make this stuffing again, which I tried for the first time on Thanksgiving. I used a day old loaf of bread from my bread machine (Bread Machine Challah I on this site), toasted up the cubes in the oven for a few minutes and put it all in the slow cooker. There's no need to dirty a mixing bowl, just do the mixing in the cooker. Who needs more dishes to wash, especially on Thanksgiving? I eyeballed the broth, but probably ended up using about 2 cups. You can always add a little more toward the end if it looks too crunchy, but adding more bread is not as effective, especially if you didn't set any aside. Honestly though, just look at it while you add the broth and stop when it looks like the bread has absorbed a decent amount. Check on it and add broth periodically if you need to. Taste it an hour or so before serving and do the final adjustments. And try not to eat the whole batch.

As previous reviews stated, be very carefull with adding the broth or you will end up with a soupy mess. I added only about a cup of broth and it was more then enough. Used fresh white bread which may have been the difference. Do not overcook & keep stirring the pot occassionally. Everyone raved about the stuffing- great flavour and texture. This recipe is a keeper.

This is the best stuffing. The only change I made was to put all the spices in with the butter and veggies. I also used all the broth since I was putting it in the oven.

This was really good. I made it for Thanksgiving to save on oven room. It was so low maintenance. I started with half of the chicken broth recommended based on other reviews saying it was too moist. However, by the end, I probably added about the amount that the recipe stated and it was perfectly moist. I also used fresh herbs because I had them. And for those afraid of putting mushrooms in like I was, (based on some people not liking mushrooms)...you couldn't even see them in the end...but their flavor helped. The leftovers were even better.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It turned out fantastic!  It was the first time I had made the Thanksgiving dinner so I was really nervous, especially about the stuffing (it's my favorite!).  I will definately make this again.  I used a full box of stock, next time I may leave a little in the box.  The stuffing was a bit wet so I cracked the lid and turned the slow cooker on high.  It dried the stuffing out just enough.  Thank you Gayle for making my first Thanksgiving a success!!!!

Very Good! I made it in the oven according to the foot note, however, the 4 1/2 cups of broth is too much. I had some dry stuffing mix (about 2 cups) in the pantry, so I mixed it into the stuffing to help absorb some of the liquid, then put it back in the over for 15 to 20 minutes. The final product came out great and my family loved (we didn't have any left overs). The next time I make it I will only use about 3 1/2 cups of broth (which is two 14 oz cans of broth). Thanks for submitting this recipe. It brought back memories of when my mom made suffing when I was little.

This recipe is good but I'm very glad I read some of the other reviews. I like stuffing to be moist and 2 1/2 - 3 cups of liquid was just right for me. I cooked on high for the first 45 mins and turned to low for 5 hours, stirring once after 2-3 hours. It seemed overcooked to me. I think next time I'll do 30 mins on high and 3 hours on low. I think with some changes this could be a 4 star recipe. I'm only giving it a 3 as is.

I cooked on high for the first 45 mins and turned to low for 5 hours, stirring once after 2-3 hours. It seemed overcooked to me. I think next time I'll do 30 mins on high and 3 hours on low. I think with some changes this could be a 4 star recipe. I'm only giving it a 3 as is.

Much easier than trying to coordinate the stuffing with the turkey. I use a half cup butter though. A cup seems kind of ridiculous.

Very good! But I agree, too much salt. But I did add some pork sausage in mine. Next time, I will not. And omit the salt all together, IMO. I used 4 cups of chicken broth. I will save this recipe.

This was so easy and freed up my precious oven space.  Be sure to grease or butter the inside of your crockpot first.  My crockpot has 4 settings, 4, 6, 8 & 10 hours.  I used the 4 hour but only needed about 3.  Still came out really good with a crispy bottom.  This will become a regular method from now on!  Thanks for sharing Gayle!!

I love this recipe. Traditional sage stuffing is my favorite on Thanksgiving and this fits the bill.  I made it again today and received many great reviews including my niece whispering to her mom "mom, this is the best stuffing I have ever had!". I would recommend adding the chicken broth only as needed and removing the cover if it is too wet.  Otherwise, we have raised the bar for Thanksgiving stuffing.  Also, cooking this in the slow cooker makes the process so much simpler than traditional preparation.  We had extra room in our oven and it was easy to make double the recipe!

Wow!!  What great stuffing.  I made it just as is.  I did use plain croutons and the amount of broth was just fine!  Thanks so much for sharing, I'll make it over and over again!

The recipe is absolutely delicious (after 4 hrs.), but please do not make the mistake I did.  Because it called for a 4-8 hr. cooking time, I thought I had better cook it for the full time.  When I checked it at about 4 hrs. it looked great and ready to use, but I wasn't sure it had cooked all the way thru, so I did the full 8.  Dried and overcooked!  Will surely make again and only cook 4 hrs. next time.  I added cooked sausage, apples , and craisins to mine and it was wonderful.    Didn't give it 5 stars because the instructions left that big window of time.

This is similar to another recipe on here that I have been using for years....It is fabulous, and a clever way to make use of a portable cooking device. My oven is full of turkey right now, and my stuffing is nestled cozily in the crockpot. I omit mushrooms, and use tart apples in their place. I also beat the egg into cool broth and pour over the veggies and bread mixture. I NEVER stir...just put the lid on top and let it bake.

I love this recipe and have used it for the last two Thanksgiving.  It makes your house just smell like stuffing.  Yum!  My only complaint is that it sometimes gets a little burned on the sides, so you really need to keep an eye on it. But if you just mix it up, it still perfect!

I must admit that I don't think this stuffing "looks" the most appetizing, but it certainly TASTES LIKE HEAVEN! I made a traditional stuffing w/apricots to go inside of the actual turkey, which all of my family and relatives love, but this year they told me that this one is their new favorite so I better make it again each year! I loved that it made so much and I had plenty on hand, which is always a problem with our family of 14+!

Another new hit on our Thanksgiving table!!  Like some other reviewers, I also assembled this the night before.  I used two packages of the store-bought sage and onion dressing, omitted the eggs, sage and mushrooms, added dried cranberries, and ended up using more than the stated amount of broth.  This cooked up perfectly in my slow cooker and everyone went back for seconds.  This will be my standard stuffing recipe from now on.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Very easy to make, I followed the previous ratings' advice and used only 2.5 cups of broth, and put a dish towel under the crock pot lid to curb water from the condensation from getting back into the stuffing.  That said, it still was really moist (almost a tad too moist, but some might say that would give it a more "inside the bird" texture) but tasted great.  A definate make again!

I stumbled across this recipe many years ago when I started deep frying turkeys, and needed an alternative to "in the bird" recipes. I only use 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock, and it still turns out nice and moist. And the aroma that fills the house, well, it's a nice prelude dinner.

I found this stuffing to be OK. My husband loved it though. I would probably make this again; cooking the stuffing in a crock pot was easy as this did not take up precious real estate in the oven on Thanksgiving day! I also used a slow cooker liner (can buy at the grocery store) to make clean up a little easier.

I modified this recipe for my vegetarian brother-in-law by omitting the poultry seasoning and using vegetable broth instead.  I am asked to make this every Thanksgiving and it is usually gone before the stuffing that is from the turkey!  This is a great recipe even without the modifications.  Very moist and delicious.

I have always used my grandma's recipe for stuffing because it was the best I'd ever eaten.  I assumed this stuffing would taste pretty much the same because it had the same basic ingredients.  Well, I was wrong!!  This stuffing was way better than grandma's (sorry, Grandma).  This was even using store-brand stuffing mix instead of homemade cornbread mixed with sliced bread like grandma used.  It was so moist and the flavor was outstanding.  I left out the mushrooms since my husband doesn't like them.  Even he thought it was fantastic!!  This recipe has made me fall in love with my slow cooker again!  Thanks, Gayle!

I made this for Thanksgiving and couldn't have been more pleased. My mother-in-law took frequent tastes as it cooked and absolutely raved over how much it resembled her mom's stuffing.

One word of caution though: watch the last bit of the cooking time. I should have removed this from the crock pot about half an hour earlier than I did and it had gone from perfection to slightly soggy. Still tasted wonderful though!

This is now my go to Holiday recipe. Took the advise of others and decreased the amount of broth but noticed it did taste kind "gummy" second time I made it I used less butter which seemed to help. Both times this was the dish everyone raved about forget 2nd's they went back for 3rd and 4th helpings.

Pretty dang good flavor. Just make sure you have a LONG time to cook it. I planned according to the low end of the recommended cooking time and it was soggy. Everyone still said the flavor was amazing though.

The taste on this was okay, but we really couldn't stand the texture. But what else did I expect from a slow-cooker stuffing...

A very good time-saving concept for stuffing.  It does get soggy if you don't 1) STIR IT (it also gets crusty around the edges) and 2) leave the lid off while cooking for a bit.

This was great stuffing.  I used the packaged bread cubes instead of regular bread and it was very easy to make in the slow cooker.  I buttered the inside and would recommend that.  It made the entire house smell great.

This turned out amazing! I also made mine ahead. The night before I mixed everything including the broth in and let it sit over night. Then in the morning i cooked it for about 5 hours. I stirred it every hour and it turned out awesome! thanks for the recipe!

VERY yummy! I was in a hurry so I omitted the 1st step and part of the second. I just added EVERYTHING to the crock pot and stirred it all together. I then cooked it on HIGH for 4 hrs then on LOW for about 45 mins, and it was PERFECT! 
As far as the chicken broth, I found that about 2 1/4 cups was adequate.

Don't be afraid-give this a try!! What a snap to make and the flavor was great.Another holiday staple has entered the recipe book! I think next time I will leave out the high setting cook time-seemed the stuffing was done in 4 hours and just overcooked after that. I also played with the broth as it's easy to just add more if it's too dry for your tastes. Used baby bella mushrooms and really liked this recipe. As stated earlier- It tasted better after 4-5 hours of cooking instead of 8.

I really like making this stuffing in the slow cooker.  I used half corn bread and half regular store bought bread crumbs.  I omitted the mushrooms.  I added a lb of sausage and 6 oz of craisens.  I did end up using the entire amount of broth, I think because I used store bought stuffing bread crumbs.  It turned out quite tasty

I just tried this tonight after reading the past reviews.  I lowered the chicken broth to about 2 cups and a few hours into the cooking time the stuffing looked great.  I knew that the recipe said to cook longer, so I left the crock pot on and watched a movie.  When I got back upstairs, the stuffing was RUINED!  It was gloppy and burnt and looked like pureed baby food!  I just got back from the store and will try this same recipe tomorrow (THANKSGIVING DAY 2007)since it tasted great in the middle of the cooking process.  I will post an update after Turkey Day to let you know how it turned out. UPDATE NOV 22, 2007:  Tried again today.  Turned out GREAT!  Used just half of the broth, only warmed it up in the crock pot and then let it sit until an hour before dinner and then turned it back on low heat.  It was perfect!  The trick is: don't stir too long, use all the broth or let sit on heat too long and it won't turn to moosh.  Will definately make again next year!

Excellent! I used all fresh herbes (doubled) and this stuffing is the best one I've made yet.  My husband loves it too, and wanted to eat the whole bowl of it.  I added dried cranberries and cooked wild rice to the recipe to give it a little something different.  I liked the additions, but this stuffing would be great as-is.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this many years for Thanksgiving. I even made it with vegetable broth one year for my vegetarian friends. I do not stir mine at all during the cooking process and I like it that way. It really only takes about 5 hours to cook. My mom always wants me to put it into the oven for about a half hour right before serving....but it doesn't need it!! She just likes it crunchy on top.

Excellent! I cubed a loaf of white bread a couple of days ahead and left it on a cookie sheet in the oven to dry out. The day of my dinner, I cooked the vegetables for about ten minutes. I did use 2 packages of sliced mushrooms(16 ounces) but more importantly ONLY 2& 3/4 cups of chicken broth instead of the amount called for in the original recipe. I also accidently left the slow cooker on high for an hour, but we all know how forgiving they are! There was absolutely no need to add any liquid at the end-it was ready to serve at my convenience, after a total of about 6 hours.

Of course I tweeked this to suit my own tastes, but I did use the basic recipe and it was excellent! I will always make the stuffing this way. Easy to make and it doesn't take up stove or oven space. Also, because it's in the cooker there's no specific time that it has to be done; it's ready when you are. My family raved about and didn't know I had done anything different until I told them.

Hubby wanted cornbread stuffing & I wanted the ease of thsi recipe...so we made up six pkgs of cornbread & baked them in 2 jelly roll pans; then I cut them into little cubes & baked at 300 degrees until they were nice & dry. (maybe a bit too dry...we had to add even more than the 4 1/2 cups of broth LOL). Added more broth & "flipped" teh stuffing over when necessary...then took the lid off the crockpot about an hour before we served dinner. I wouldn't say the texture was excellent on this stuffing but it wasn't soggy either. Will make again...thanks Gayle Wagner!

Totally awesome stuffing! I did add: apples, sausage and walnuts. The secret is only adding enough stock at first to moisten the bread, then adding it a little at a time throughout the day. I probably only ended up using 2 cups do to the condesation created by the slow cooker. I will never make stuffing another way!

This was so tasty and easy, and everyone love the flavor.  I followed the recipe as directed except I did not add the mushrooms, or the marjoram.  Just a little tip to avoid the stuffing from sticking to the crockpot spray it down with some pam before adding the stuffing.  It makes clean up so easy!

Everyone loved this - said it was the "stand out" side at Thanksgiving.  Some variations...had no onions, so I used two shallots.  Also added crumbled sausage.  For the broth, used almost two cans of chicken broth (one plain, one roasted garlic).  Added liquid about every 30 minutes during cooking.  Did NOT cook on high - only on low for about 3.5 hours!

Update - made it again for T day and it was just as good as I remembered!!  I used french toast bread cubed and toasted this year w/ corn bread and did not have to add extra broth. This rocked!  I used 1 pan of corn bread, 4 big french rolls (cut into big chunks) that were toasted/stale and some apple chicken sausage.  I reserved 3 cups for the bird and it was much better out of the crock pot.  I mixed it every hour or so and used 1 small can of chicken broth thr. out cooking (which ended up being 7 or so hours).  The stuffing is done earlier than stated but the longer it cooks the more flavor it has and it browns.  I'll never put it in the oven again! I can't forget chestnuts next time. Thank you 8 - )

We loved this!!  Didn't use all of the butter, just what I needed and used a little bacon grease for more flavor when frying veggies.  Baked in oven.

Made this for a crowd of 12.  Used six cups bakery-bought white bread, six cups bakery-bought whole wheat bread, and about 2/3 - 3/4 of the suggested chicken broth.  Everybody liked the end result, and it was a lot lighter and tastier than boxed stuffing.  Recommended!

Wonderful recipe!  What a terrific (and tasty) way to free up some oven space.  It was one of the favorites of the day.  I added about 3/4 a lb of Sage Sausage as suggested by another review.  Thanks so much for this recipe, made my Thanksgiving day go much smoother.

Excellent recipe!  The combination of spices is delightful.  I used a pan of Jiffy corn bread (suggested by another reviewer) and fresh Italian bread dried in the oven.  I also added only about half the broth called for by the recipe.  The texture turned out nice - not too soupy.  Because this recipe is cooked in the crockpot, it is very convenient for a busy Thanksgiving day.

My son thought it was the best stuffing we've ever had for Thanksgiving.  He's a good cook himself and I appreciated the compliment.  A guest also enjoyed it.  I did make a couple of changes though in preparation on Thanksgiving by only using two cans ( 14 oz each ) of chicken broth and  adding one pound of Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage ( which was cooked first ).  I thank your reviewers with these ideas.  Next time though I will either reduce the time in the crockpot ( it seems to get darker the longer it cooks )or try baking it in the oven.  Overall still a tasty recipe although aesthetically there was room for improvement.

This recipe is great! If your a first timer at the whole thanksgiving thing and want moist stuffing this is the way to do it. Instead of getting the bread cubes and seasoning just use a boxed stuffing (Mrs. Cumbensons works great).

This is a staple at holiday dinners now. It isn't much different than the stuffing I used to put in the bird, but I never thought to add egg as a binder or to toss it in the crock pot. It is lovely, because everyone is happy - there is crispy stuffing on the outside for those who like that and moister stuffing inside for the others. I also like to substitute and equal amount of the dried bread crumbs for a crumbled pan of Jiffy corn bread.  I think it adds a little more flavor.

This was great!  I added some bacon to the celery/onion mixture, and mmmmmmmm! was it good!  I did cut down on the chicken broth as others did, and I mixed it every hour so it would not burn on the bottom.  Thanks Gayle for this great recipe!!

I've made this two years in a row for my office party - everyone loves it.  The texture is a little like bread pudding, but the flavor is what everyone loves.  I've found the best bread cubes to use is a mixture of white, wheat, & pumpernickel.  I substitute garlic powder for poultry seasoning and rosemary for marjoram.  Also, I use the broth sparingly.

This was a really convenient way to free up the stove when doing an elaborate meal such as Thanksgiving. I didn't have 12 ounces of mushrooms so I used 7 ounces of Shitake mushrooms. That gave it a great and unique flavor. I also made my own bread cubes by letting fresh cubed bread sit out overnight and then lightly drying them out in the oven for maybe 10-15 mins. Everyone really liked the stuffing a lot. I think 8 hours was too long though, because at the end the stuffing was beginning to slightly burn on the bottom. I would definitely make this dish again.

This is by far the best stuffing I have ever tasted.  It was gobbled up at Thanksgiving and everyone remarked on how great it was.  I will never make any other kind of stuffing again.

This stuffing was edible when mixing the ingredients together before putting it in the crockpot!

This truly is the most flavorful stuffing I've ever tasted.  The flavors blended beautifully - the amount of herbs were just perfect with the right balance.. yum.. VERY tasty! My only "complaint" - would be that although the stuffing is moist, it was a little too moist to the point of that it was mushy. Next time, I'll just add enough broth to cover and gage it as it cooks. It's very simple to make and again, PACKED with flavor.

The recipe was great!  I didn't cook it for nearly as long as the recipe states, though.  About 3 hours total was all it needed.  Any more than that and the edges would have been too dry and hard.

As other reviewers have said, it takes much less chicken broth than the recipe calls for.  Also, I think the butter can be halved.  Wonderful recipe, thanks!

This is the best stuffing I ever made.  I didn't have dried marjoram.  It is a too moist for us, but next time I will cut down on the chicken broth.  I used Pepperidge Farms Stuffing, instead of the dry bread cubes.  This is a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving for the first time because we go to a football game right in the middle of the day and this recipe was so convenient for the timing. It made it so easy, because I chopped everything up the day before and measured my spices so all I had to do before I left for the game was throw it in the crock pot and mix it up. When we got back from the game, the house smelled wonderful! And the taste was awesome! I had added too much broth so I added some Stove Top chicken stuffing to get it to the right consistency. Next time I will make sure I have that on hand again as it is great insurance in case I get too crazy with the broth. This is a tasty and easy recipe. Thanks!

Very moist.  Only used 1/2 of the broth. Only cooked for about 4 hours which was plenty.  Didn't get hard on the side.   Nice flavor.  Great not having to use up the space in the oven.  Will continue to use and pass recipe on.  Thanks

I agree with the last reviewer, you really need to judge the amount of broth as you're mixing up the dressing.  Based on other reviews (which varied from using no broth at all, to using the max amount), I started with none and ended up adding about 3/4 cup.  My crock pot runs hot, too, so I cooked this on low heat for 4 hours.  It was actually done in about 3 hours (maybe earlier), and I should have stirred it occasionally because the edges were a little burned.  But the smell was amazing, and the flavor was beautiful!  I don't like chunks of celery and onions, so I pureed them, with no problems.  This is now my permanent stuffing recipe -- everyone loves it, and with some preparation it only takes 5 minutes to throw together on Thanksgiving morning!

Awesome Recipe! I used a variety of french bread cubes, corn bread, and white loaf bread cubes and added sage sausage.  As with any stuffing recipe, you need to judge the amount of broth needed as you mix it all up.  Mine was the right consistency going into the crock pot and perfect coming out.  I got rave reviews and it was an added bonus to be able to make it the night before, place in refrigerator, pop it in the crock pot first thing in the morning and have my oven available for everything else!  This will be my recipe for now on.  Thank you Gayle!

I made this for Christmas dinner. Since I like my stuffing baked, I ended up taking it from the crockpot after a while and putting it in a pan and baking. It had the best flavor of any I've ever eaten. Everyone complimented me on it. It is a definate keeper for my family. Thanks for sharing.

WE LOVE STUFFING!  So, I liked the concept of freeing up some oven space.  However, I found that the sides burned and it made for some crispy bits.  The middle was delicious, but I wound up throwing out a good portion of it.  Unfortunate.

My family really loved this stuffing.  I scaled the recipe for 12 people and used 3 1/2 cups broth.  It came out just perfect.  I will make this every year.  My husband is actually asking me to make it again this weekend because he never got seconds!!  Thanks Gayle.

Great idea for stuffing!  I loved having the extra space in the oven.  I really don't know how much broth I used, I think it was about 2 cans, just until moist.  I tweaked it a little to try and mimic my mom's.  I used a pound of sage sausage and a couple apples, diced very small.  Everyone, including my mom, really liked it. Thanks!!

This was fantastic and the house smelled great all day!  We always make a Cajun Cornbread Stuffing but last year we had grandparents coming and knew they probably wouldn't care for it...so I needed a recipe that wasn't going to take more space in the oven.  I will be making both again this year!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe in 2001, loved it, used other recipes since and have come back to this one. Look no further. I made it again this year (2009) and my family raved. My kids asked for seconds, my sister-in-law who eats like a bird couldn't stop eating it and my dad said it reminded him of the stuffing that his mom and aunt used to make. What a compliment. The only changes I made were adding about 2 cloves of minced garlic, an additional loaf of white bread that I toasted in the oven and then cut into cubes. Start with around 2 cups of broth and work your way up to your desired consistency. I ended up using about 4.5 cups. I made mine the night before and then set the slow cooker on low for about 4.5 hours. It was perfect. I think this recipe is going to be my yearly standard.

I’ve made this for Thanksgiving dinner several years in a row and it is always a big hit.  Just wish I had a bigger crockpot as everyone seems to want a second helping and we have little leftover.

Needed a recipe for a company pot luck this week.  This is quite similar to my traditional stuffing recipe.  I normally use pork sausage for my family but because we have non pork eaters at work, I omitted it. I added 3 shredded carrots that  I sautéed with the onions.  I added 8 oz jelled cranberry sauce to the mixture. Cut the broth to 3 cups, added 8 oz apple juice.    Used the towel to absorb the condensation.  Great method when you want stuffing but you’re not cooking the turkey!

This was good, and I'll definitely make it again. I'll play around a bit with the seasoning, maybe less sage, but that's just personal preference. I used a little too much broth despite your warning!  Very easy recipe, thanks.

Awesome recipe!   We made it for a friend who was coming to Christmas dinner. We aren’t big stuffing fans and we were a little skeptical about doing it in the slow cooker, however it exceeded our expectations and was the best we’ve ever had. We used very hard crusty bread crumbs cut intolarge cues and then we used only four cups of broth. It turned out perfect!

This is so delicious and easy, used half sourdough and half white italian style bread, made it so tasty and chewy - not mush.  Only used 3.5 cups of stock, cooked about 5 hrs and took the lid off for the last hr to dry out a bit.  Added an apple and dried cranberries, lots of fresh herbs (sage, thyme and rosemary)  rather than dried.

OMG !!!!  This recipe was DELICIOUS and has FINALLY freed up my stove burners for Thanksgiving dinner, as well as makes the stuffing in advance so that I can enjoy the Holidays socializing with my guests drinking a glass of wine before dinner (rather than making last-minute stuffing)!!  I simplified the recipe even more,,,,, I put 1 and 1/2 cubes of butter (6 oz) into a skillet and melted it on low; I added one cup of chopped celery and one cup of diced onions and simmered them until the onions became translucent in color.  Dump the butter, celery, and onions into a greased slow cooker.  Add one 12 oz box of Mrs. Cubbison's Traditional Stuffing Bread Mix into the slow cooker and lightly toss until all of the butter, onions, and celery are mixed and absorbed.  Then add a third of a can of Swanson's Chicken Broth (14.5 oz can) over the mixture and stir until just barely moist (with no liquid standing on the bottom of the crock pot).  Lightly whip 1 - 2 eggs, and pour over stuffing.  Mix until moist.  Cook on low (or "slow cook") for 4 hours, adding a drizzle or so more chicken broth every hour as needed to get the right moist consistency.  This was the HIT of Thanksgiving and everyone went back for seconds and third helpings !!!!  This recipe is a life saver !!!!!!  (I ended up using a total of about 12 oz of the can of 14.5 oz can of chicken broth after adding some each hour of cooking),,,,, just be certain NOT to put the whole can in at the beginning of the recipe because you

It was pretty good! A few more fresh herbs added at the end, and maybe a little bit of fresh minced celery, would add a little bit of fresher flavor and crunch, but I'll definitely make this again. I did omit the mushrooms (on purpose) and the eggs (accidentally). I used the bagged dried-out bread cubes that my grocery store sells, and those were dry enough to need a full 4 cups of liquid. I did layer the cubes, butter/onion/celery/herb mix, and stock so that they didn't need as much mixing to come together. It's also important to note that if you're cooking this for more than 4 hours, you'll want to scrape down the sides periodically or they will burn. Ah - and also butter the *heck* out of the crock pot, to make the sides scrape down easier.

I didn't include mushrooms and added sausage. I doubled the recipe and used 2 pounds of sage sausage. Like others -- watch out for the broth. I used only 2 cups of broth at the beginning. I actually cooked my veggies the night before to save time. I cooked in an 8-qt crock pot for 45 minutes on high and then 5 hours on low. About every half-hour, I stirred and added a few tablespoons of broth. The stuffing was amazing!

This was delicious and my family loved it, especially my husband. I excluded the mushrooms because some in the family won’t eat them, but I added preshredded (then I chopped) carrots which added texture and color. 
I used crouton style bread cubes to which I added about 3 cups total broth, starting out with 2 cups, then added some after  45 minutes on high. 
The stuffing was actually ready after 2 hours on low so I’m not sure why it states 4 -8 hours. Maybe my low setting on my Crock Pot  is hotter than others. I kept it on keep warm until dinner was served.

I used another reviewer’s suggestion and added the spices to the veggies while they cooked to get an even distribution throughout the stuffing. Great idea! This was my first time making stuffing outside the bird and I was very nervous it would be dry, but it was awesome! I used the dry cubes and used all of the broth and it was very moist! I used only 1/2 cup of butter and it was plenty. I stirred every hour to make sure I didn’t need more broth and I did not. I’m going to try another reviewer’s suggestion next time and reduce the egg to one, although I’m not sure it’s even needed at all. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!

I have made this every year and it is always a big hit. I will caution you to use the broth SPARINGLY! The first time I tried it, I was pouring on the broth and realized it was too much. I now just mix everything without it, then put in crockpot and pour about 1/2 cup of broth and stir. Add in more broth as needed and during the cooking to keep it the moisture level you prefer.

I’ve made this stuffing for years now with very few changes. It is fantastic and is always my favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner. I use fresh Italian bread that I have cube day the bakery then dry in my oven (200 degrees for 20ish minutes). The changes I have made are as follows: no mushrooms- picky eaters, add herbs to the onion/ celery/ parsley/ butter mixture, only add 1/2 broth at the beginning and more as it cooks if needed, use a liner, and prep it the night before. I currently have the stuffing all ready to

Excellent nosh! I’ve never been a lover of stuffing but the hubby is so I wanted to make the effort to make him something amazing not just the boxed variety. With my prime rib in the oven I needed a slow cooker recipe and this worked beautifully! Here’s the tips ans trickes that worked for me:

Follow the recipe exactly. It says ADD BROTH UNTIL MOIST. Don’t just go all gung hoe on it. I used the Peppridge Farm cubes (2 bags) and I used 2 cups of broth. The bread cubes turned out perfectly moist and fluffy!! So instead of blaming your failed cooking on the recipe remember this tip: it’s always easier to add than take away!

FIRST:  For all those claiming this ruined their holiday meal, READ the directions!  It clearly says that the amount of broth should be to wet the mixture and NOT using the whole amount.

MOST IMPORTANT:  The flavor is amazing!  I did put too much broth in myself, but added some bread and soaked out some juice while it was cooking.  My mom usually makes her homemade, Southern recipe.  She was SUPER impressed with the flavor.  And, my picky eaters that don't like mushrooms ate it and enjoyed it as well!  We're making again for the holidays!!!

This was a hit.  It was nice to not have mess with the stuffing thanksgiving morning.  Like other reviewers have noted, be mindful of the liquid you add.  I used store bought bread cubes, which are really dry. I used all the liquid called for in the recipe, and I turned out perfectly.

This was the best stuffing I've ever had outside of a turkey.  If you want you could use the turkey giblets to make a turkey stock instead of chicken broth.  I didn't, but it's an idea.  I may try it next year.  I think I used 3 cups of broth, when it started to build up liquid around the edges I stopped pouring.  The key is the type of bread.  Plain white bread isn't going to work well.  Use French or Italian bread.  Our grocery store sells bags of stale bread cubes for stuffing.  This stuffing doesn't look like Stove Top with nice little cubes, it's more of a mush style like you'd find in the turkey.  I'll make it every year and if the family ever wants stuffing randomly throughout the year, this is the recipe I'll turn to!

This recipe is great.

Every year for the juiciest turkey, I spatchcock it. If you have never tried that before, I highly recommend. Unfortunately, butterflying one's turkey isn't in the cavity stuffing friendly.

I simmer the spine along with the neck and any other bits I have cut from my bird. This makes a nice low salt broth to make my crockpot stuffing. It also allows you to take advantage of some of the rendered turkey fat which is what has always made in the bird stuffing so delicious. When assembled, I put those meaty pieces in the crockpot with the stuffing as well. Leaving them on top so not to worry about leaving bits of bone in the final product. 

Use your judgement on salt. If you are using a high sodium pre-packaged broth and complain it's salty, leave your complaints at the door. That's right, it's your own fault.  

Different types of bread, cut differently and packaged bread cubes will require different amounts of moisture. Add a bit, stir, let it absorb for a while and adjust accordingly.  You won't have bread soup if you are paying attention. If you are using pre-seasoned stuffing omit the seasoning and use the recipe on the package as a guide on how much moisture you will require. As with most recipes, look at it as a general guide accepting there will always be local product variables to afford a little tweaking. Additionally, slow cookers do vary, if you managed to burn it perhaps yours cooks hotter than most. Keep an eye on your food, especially when tr

Made it precisely according to the instructions and it was wonderful. I made a second batch to stuff the bird where I reduced the broth to one cup and it was just as lovely. Many of my guests preferred the crockpot batch just slightly more because of the nice crusty bits that formed along the edges of the pot. Either way, I liked them both just fine.

I have made this recipe 2 years in a row for Christmas dinner. I love, love, love it! Easy and delicious! The broth amount will depend on the type of bread crumbs you use. Mix until wet and add more if needed. I check it after about 2 hours and then every hour after.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  I never seem to have enough stuffing so I thought I'd give this a try even though I was skeptical. It was delicious! I only gave it 4 stars as I thought the seasoning was a little on the light side so I did add more.  I hate when people tweak a recipe and then give it a 5 star.  Anyway, I added just enough chicken stock to moisten then added a bit throughout the day.  For the people that complained that their dinner was ruined because it was too much broth.......just read the  recipe!  It gives you an amount to have at the ready but CLEARLY  says add enough broth to moisten!  It's really common sense to not soak it in broth.  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised how well this turned out and will do this again for extra stuffing!  Really wish I had a liner though, tough to clean the crock after making this.

I tried this  because we were having a large group of friends for Christmas lunch and limited oven space.  It is easy to prepare.  I cooked it for four hours on low after the initial 45 minutes on high.  As not all of our friends like mushrooms, I left those out.

This stuffing cooks up  light and fluffy, not at all heavy and squidgy.   Our guests gave it rave reviews - the best stuffing ever, one said.  ;)

Based on other  comments, I used barely 2 cups of broth. I also browned some sausage and added that .  I used fresh bread which I cut into cubes. While the bread was still soft I added all the seasonings, then spread them across cookie sheets and put them in the 225 degree oven about 10-15 minutes. I didn't let them completely brown as I did not want them as dry as the packaged stuffing mixes. I also did this the night before. This recipe turned out  great!

Don't add all the liquid at first. Gradually add it throughout the cooking process to adjust to your preference and to keep it moist. Recommend stirring about every 30-60 min to keep the edges from burning.

This was great.  No more waking up hours early to stuff the turkey.  Next time I will add some extra sage.  I even forgot about it during the presidential election so I cooked it longer than eight hours but it was still delicious and I had a generous amount for 14 guests and leftovers.  Just heated it up while the turkey was resting.

Delicious and it's one less thing to worry about when cooking for 25 people! We have used this recipe at Thanksgiving 3 years in a row now and everyone loves it. Fresher bread will use less water so you have to use your intuition when deciding how much water to add.

I've made this stuffing two years in a row now, and it's gotten nothing but rave reviews from everyone - even those who claim they "hate" stuffing. I love how using the crockpot will free up precious oven space for other dishes! 

I've followed the recipe very closely both times. I usually prep everything in the crockpot the night before EXCEPT the broth and eggs. In the morning, I add the beaten eggs and broth (and yes, please listen to all the reviews that say to ADD IT SLOWLY, cup at a time, until it's well moistened - some may not need the entire 4 cups, although I certainly did!), and with plastic gloves on, I work all the liquid through the breadcrumbs and veggies. 

Cook on low for 4 hours and you've got perfectly moistened, perfectly seasoned stuffing with minimal work. THANK YOU for a fabulous keeper of a recipe!!

I must say I was skeptical making stuffing in a crock pot especially for my first time ever making stuffing.  But with a 32 lb turkey in the oven, I just didn't want to use my oven so I went for it.  I was feeding about 25 people so I tripled this recipe.  I used the bagged  Pepperidge Farms bread cubes and I did use all the broth per the recipe.  I also put a clean dishtowel under the lid of the crock pot to absorb the extra moisture per other reviewers.  It came out PERFECT!  Everyone raved about it. lt was very flavorful and the perfect texture.  One thing I did omit was mushrooms...

This was good! I used packaged bread cubes and a 32oz. carton of chicken broth, and I had to add even more broth twice while cooking. As suggested, I placed a towel under the lid of the slow cooker. Next time, I will cook it for about 4-5 hours on low (the edges were pretty "well done" after 6 hours on low.)

I made this for the first time while hosting my first Thanksgiving.  I made sure to read a LOT of reviews and started off light on the broth as suggested.  I was super nervous, but it turned out great!  Everybody loved it and said it has as much flavor as the boxed stuff, which everybody normally prefers including myself.  And it was so easy making it in the crock pot - didn't take up any space.  Just go lighter on the broth and add as needed and it'll turn out great!  I will be making this recipe every time.  Thanks for the share!

I made this in the oven and use the oven directions provided below. When I made it, I only used two cups of chicken broth, and it was plenty. I always use one and a half loaves of white bread that I toast in the oven to make the dressing. It tastes even better in the oven than it does from the crockpot! No other changes are necessary.

My wife made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE hit!  Like everyone else, she toned back the broth at first to make sure it wasn't runny.  She did end up using almost as much as it asked for though as it thickened.

I tried the recipeand I'll have to make some changes. It had too much butter in it for me. The butter flavor was a little over powering, just couldn't taste anything else in the dressing. -- David B

This was the first year hosting Thanksgiving for my family so I was nervous about making a recipe I had not yet tried. I'm so glad I went with this recipe. It was very moist and delicious. As most other reviews said l, you don't need all of the chicken stock. Only use what you need and it will come out great.

This was quite good!  I used veggie broth so I could eat it too (vegetarian) and added garlic to the sauté.  Did not add all the broth, started slowly just to moisten and added as I checked throughout the cook.  I did not start on high, due to other reviews, rather cooked from 11:30 till about 4:00 on low and it cooked a bit much for my taste, so next time I will start it later.  I used Pepperidge Farm boxed stuffing mix and added a few sprigs of chopped fresh poultry herbs to the mix.  Also, as I added the broth, I did as others suggested and placed a clean dish towel under the crock lid to soak up extra moisture.  Thank you so much for the recipe and all the previous reviews, combined with my own very minor tweaks, this was a great stuffing that left open the oven and stovetop!

Crowd pleaser.  Don't forget to put the dish towel under the lid for condensation.  Also, much less chicken broth than it calls for - I used 2 C.

Tasty traditional dressing. We freeze nice leftover breads throughout the year so our dressing includes white, wheat, grain, rye, etc.  I also save plenty of turkey stock so we use that in place of chicken. Before serving we put ours in a foil pan under the broiler for several minutes to get a crusty top. Very good stuff!!

I just made this and it is slow cooking. I make this recipe every Thanksgiving and am always so happy to find it every time I Google it. I wrote a review years ago but not sure where it is. This dish is hands down the favorite dish of ALL dishes on the table. Mashed potatoes and homemade gravy comes in second. First I would like to say that I am surprised the author has not adjusted the chicken broth measurement. In my opinion it is clearly way off. I adjusted it to 2 cups to start and then I watch and drizzle as needed. I peek and stir every 30 minutes or so. I like mushrooms but NOT in stuffing so I leave them out. I use an entire loaf of sliced sourdough bread. I put the slices on a huge platter, cover with paper towels and put in the oven with the oven OFF overnight. In the morning I tear all the slices into small/med pieces. I do start the slow cooker on high to get it going and then turn it down to low. I personally like it on the tender/soggy side. It tastes like it came out of the bird with none of the hassle and potential danger of baking the stuffing in the bird. This recipe is a keeper. I bought a portable GE slow cooker (the cord coils in and disappears) which is awesome. And the lid locks for travel.  You will need a large slow cooker for this recipe. I wish I had this recipe decades ago. You can whip this out very quickly the morning of Thanksgiving. And the best part is that it is delicious. And of course that it does not require an oven to bake!  Thanks!

I htink this recipe calls for wayyyy too much broth. I added two cups and it became somewhat mushy. Add only one cup to start off. Use your judgement as it keeps cookin if you need to add more. If you do so, slowly add a tiny bit at a time. If it becomes mushy here is how it can be saved. Keep off crockpot lid for about an hour to give juices time to evaporate. Sprinkle in bread crumbs until it gets back to a good consistency.

This is amazing!!! Made it for Christmas 2013. I have always done a store bought brand and added extras which everyone else was ok with. My husband the "food critic" LOVED this too.  I will ALWAYS use this recipe.

Great with my changes ;) me and my family like a sweet corn tasting stuffing. Made 5 changes.
1) used betty crocker cornbread packets (2) adding 4tbsp of sugar, for the bread once baked addef to croc pot crumbled.
2) adjusted the recipe to half.
3) added 1/2 cup of frozrn corn
4) added only 1 cup of water no chicken broth
5) did not add egg
Sauteeted veggies add spices a plenty and kept on warm did not really need to cook to much plus my croc gets very hot.

This was a major hit at Thanksgiving!! I got many compliments! If your stuffing is too soggy you are adding too much broth, be sure to only mix the broth as needed till bread crumbs are "moistened". I used prepackaged bread crumbs and corn bread crumbs and it was fantastic! Always do a trial run of any recipe before serving it for a big shindig so that you know what to do next time you make it :)

This is my go-to recipe for stuffing. Super easy and fool proof. I like to add a little sausage to it sometimes. The reviewers are right. You have to use your common sense and pay attention to the consistency of the stuffing as you're making it.

Simply fantastic!  Make sure to be very careful when adding the chicken broth to just add enough to dampen the bread and other ingredients.  This is important because juices from the celery and other ingredients will come out during cooking.  So delicious!!!

This Thanksgiving I volunteered to make the stuffing.  It was the first time for me.  I followed the recipe exactly and I did the 8 hour take.   Came out very moist and everyone said it was great (and I didn't have to ask first).  The friends we had over all asked if they could take some of the stuffing home ... a great compliment to the recipe.  Intend to do it again for Christmas.

First off I used half of the butter. It was plenty. I omitted the herbs and spices in lieu of already seasoned bread crumbs. I used 2 cans of chicken broth, (about 4 C.)and cooked it as directed, on high for 45 min. low 4 hrs. (I didn't open it once!) I was skeptical, but this was fantastic! Moist, but not soggy. I will most definitely be making this again at Christmas. OH! And next year I'll be sure to make it veggie broth so the vegetarians can eat it!!

This was so good but I added some things too it.  I browned up pork sage sausage, added 2 apples and about 3/4c of dried cranberries.   It was moist and I used all of the chx stock.  The only thing I would caution people about is that you can't leave it in the crockpot on low all day, the bottom scorched.  Otherwise, an excellent basic recipe!

Perfect slow cooker recipe, great to make early and serve 5 hrs later.  Everyone liked this, and was all eaten.  thanks.  Also used 2 cups chicken broth, I thinks 4.5 is to much.  enjoy

I would give 2.5 stars if I could. 

The taste of the recipe seems to be good. However, this recipe turned out quite soggy and mushy. Furthermore, the amounts listed do not yield 16 servings...unless each person takes a tablespoon of stuffing. After 8 hours in my slow cooker, what looked like a decent amount of stuffing for my company potluck (we have about 50 people in my office) reduced down to serve MAYBE a family of 5-6 people. I had to supplement our entree order with stuffing to make sure people actually get to enjoy some with our Thanksgiving-themed potluck.

I think that this may have turned out better if I had cooked it on low for only 4 hours and was able to babysit and stir it often. To be able to bring it to our company potluck, I threw everything in for the night so it was unattended most of the 8 hours of low cooking time. This resulted in it being mostly mushy and soggy, but also scorched on the sides and bottom. 

Oh, and as for my adjustments: I didn't use the full amount of broth (I followed the instructions and I don't understand why so many people couldn't read that it states to use just enough to moisten) and skipped on the mushrooms.

Been a stove top family for years.  One try of this, well, no, two actually, and we are hooked.  The first time I didn't follow the suggestions of less liquid and I regretted it, I had stuffing soup.  Tried it again, using half the butter and only once cup of broth and PERFECT!  you can always add more liquid, removing it proved challenging.  It's flavorful and fantastic.  totally frees up oven and microwave space for Thanksgiving day.  You can easily make it the night before and have it on overnight or prepare first thing in the morning for dinner.  It's great!

Made this last Thanksgiving and it turned out great. I did reduce the amount of broth by adding only half of it intially and then more as needed. I also added some sage sausage since my family loves sausage in their stuffing. Turned out great and was nice to free up the oven for other things.

Omg this was the best stuffing ever! I had no problems with the ingredients whatsoever. I used store bought hard bread cubes and used the recommended amt of broth. I didn't add mushrooms and instead put raisins. To.die.for.

As others have noted, DON'T ADD ALL 4-1/2 CUPS CHICKEN BROTH initially. While the recipe does read "pour in enough broth to moisten," it doesn't make it clear that the cook should be prepared to add broth as the slow cooker dries out the mixture over the cooking time. There was a full two cups of leftover chicken broth when I prepared this dressing. The volume of chicken broth required will vary depending on the type of bread used, and the length of actual cooking time. My version was still a little moist (though my wife said she prefers dressing like that). I prefer dressing that is not so moist. The cook can--of course--control the moisture content by adding the volume of chicken broth that suits their preferences.

I made this recipe as-is and it came out really yummy!  Like other reviewers said, make sure you DO NOT add all four cups of chicken broth at once. I ended up only needing about 2 cups in all.  I also didn't do the 45 minute high setting, just cooked on low. I do have to say it wasn't all that appealing to look at, but it was super tasty and I will definitely be making this every Thanksgiving!

I made this twice, mainly because my oven was broken over Christmas.  Too much moisture in the recipe.  The first time I got a soupy mess.  The second time I only added broth until just moistened.  It still turned out kind of wet, but more edible than the first attempt.

This had the taste and texture of being cooked inside the bird! (moist and gooey, in a good way) I started with 2 boxes of Mrs. Cubbison's Herb Seasoned stuffing (16 cups). I omitted the poultry seasoning and salt. Added 4 cups of broth, then when the turkey had drippings, I added 1/2 cup of said drippings. This made it a little too moist, but an additional 1/4 box of stuffing remedied that. I followed the rest of the recipe as is, including the cooking on high then low. This seemed to work fine - it cooked for a total of about 5 hours.

the easiest way to make a large amount and is very delicious.  It is also very moist.  I cooked 45 minutes on high and 4.5 hours on low.   I had to modify the spices as my husband is allergic to sage.

This was terrific! I read the other reviews and I used less broth (I actually used stock) when I first mixed it and added more as necessary. I will definitely be making this for Christmas!

I thought that the dressing was very tasty.  The only problem that I encountered was the heat of the crock pot.  It burned portions of it and dried out the dressing around the pot itself.  Next time I make it, and I will definitely make it again, I will cook as directed, but then lower the heat to Warm, instead of Low. I left out the mushrooms this time around, but will add them next time.  Great recipe :)

Used this recipe for our Thanksgiving stuffing recipe - worked perfectly!  I followed another reviewers advice and cooked some sage sausage to add, then just added a sprinkle of sage to the mix.  I was nervous about the chicken broth so I decided to follow previous reviews and add slowly, as needed.  I ended up using a little over 4 cups.  I agree that the chicken broth amount has to do with the type of breadcrumbs used.  I used the original dried stuffing cubes, and added 2 cups at a time, mixing as I added.  For the crockpot, after the 45 minutes on high, I had on low for about 6 hours- it turned out great!  Stuffing was moist and fluffy, but not too much.  Plus the sausage added the perfect little kick that it needed.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe for next Thanksgiving!

My familys favorite! I omit the eggs and make this the night before. Yesterday I re-moistened with some chicken broth and transferred to my slow cooker....started on low and turned to warm stirring every so often to ensure no sticking. I also spray my insert with a little non cooking spray to also ensure no sticking. Its a perfect tasting recipe and the slow cooker method to keeping it hot and moist .....well for me there is no other way. Second year in a row making this and will continue to do so...one less dish to re-heat in the oven. Thanks!

This is a simple recipe that worked perfectly. As may reviewers suggested, I added just enough chicken broth to moisten the bread, then just checked it periodically. I used very dry Pepperidge farm bread crumbs and used slightly less broth than the recipe called for. 

I'm making it twice more this week for Thanksgiving dinners!

This was my first time using the crock pot for stuffing, up until this year always tried to juggle the oven. I too cut back on the broth, omitted the mushrooms but added my standard apples, walnuts and dried cranberries to the mix....How Easy!!

Terrific! My husband said it was the best I'd ever made. I used only 2.5 cups of broth & used the rest from the 32 oz. container with the gravy package that came with the Jenny-O turkey instead of water. I eliminated the poultry season, salt and pepper as I could only find pre-seasoned bread cubes. I cooked it about 5 hours and took the lid off for the last 30 minutes. The little bit of crusty stuffing around the outside was just right with the moist stuffing in the center! Spraying the crock with cooking spray before cooking made cleanup a breeze. Highlly recommend the Rosemary Roasted Turkey, too!

This was excellent stuffing.  I made french bread the day before, cut it up and stored it in the oven, cubed it and followed the directions in the recipe, minus the egg.  I was leary of the liquid amount so I started with half and added as it cooked.  I think I probably used the full amount.  I had to take some stuffing out and put it in a bowl then put it back in to shuffle it around while it cooked so it was cooked evenly.  I got many compliments on it at Thanksgiving.  It's a much easier way to cook stuffing.  There are even crispy crusty spots on the sides and bottom if you cook it long enough.

I have made a lot of turkey dressing over the years with mixed results.  I assembled this recipe as written and it was very good.   A little more moist than I am accustom but the folks at the table this past Thanksgiving had only good things to say about it.  I made one batch with oysters which I had to add a small amount of extra bread to off set the addition of the liquor from the oysters.  But again it was very good.  Try it, you will like it.

I have made this stuffing for many years.  It truly is a life-saver for a family that likes lots of dressing and it clears the stove/oven for other uses.  Be careful of the amount of broth as it gets much moister than it does in the oven.

This turned out great! I used 12 cups of the dry bread cubes-started out with 2 cups of chicken broth and added as needed, probably ended up using about 3 for those who are giving it a shot and worried about the consistency...so nice to have an extra dish out of the way on the holiday! Thanks!

This is a SUPER EASY, Great tasting recipe.  I was looking for a very moist, sticky consistancy recipe for stuffing.  This was perfect!  I used approximately 4 cups of broth and it was great.  My recommendation would be to add the broth slowly...how much you need is a personal preference.  We left the mushrooms out for the picky eaters in the family and it was great.  Ours sat in the crock pot for a good 7 hours, but it was ready to go after about 4.5 hours.  This is a keeper!

I love stuffing and this recipe turned out great.  Everyone loved it as well.  I did decrease the amount of broth used like others had suggested.  I ended up using about 2.5 cups of broth.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Not so great for me.  I did not add the eggs because I do not tolerate them, so I may have messed it up myself.  The stuffing came out mostly mush.  Still tasted good, but mostly mush.

I have been making this stuffing every Thanksgiving for the last 5 yrs. It is in the crockpot as I type. Love it obviously. As far as the broth issue. The directions say add enough to moisten, not dump the whole 4 1/2 cups in.

This year I was disappointed to find that they only had the sage and onion seasoned bread crumbs left. I omitted the sage and salt and am crossing my fingers that it still tastes as good as as year.

Served it today for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. My wife said it was the best stuffing she ever had. She likes meat in stuffing, so I added 1/2 pound of cooked ground round. My slow cooker runs hot, and this was finished after only 2+ hours.

I made this for Thanksgiving today and it was a big hit.  I did make a few changes just to suit our preferences.  1) I halved the recipe to fit in our medium sized crockpot.  2) I added browned sausage and sauteed the veggies in the drippings 3) I omitted the seasoning since the pepperidge farm corn bread stuffing I used  was already seasoned (I did add about 1 tsp black pepper and 1 tsp creole seasoning) 4) I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth.  I started the crockpot out on high as directed for the first 45 minutes.  It then cooked an additional 5 hours.   I did notice the stuffing was looking a little soggy, so I took the lid off for the last 45 minutes of cook time and it was perfect.  Will DEFINITELY be making this again.....

I've used this recipe for several years, since I started brining my turkey.  I've tried making stuffing in the oven, but it always comes out dry.  This comes out perfect, and it's so easy to make in the slow cooker.

I've made this recipe for years and just made it again :) Happy Thanksgiving! I thought I'd share my modifications. Make sure you use a really dense bread like ciabatta bread and make sure it's really dry. I like to add a 1/2 cup of currants to it and about 2 cups of cooked sausage with sage. I never need as much chicken broth as it calls for, so add it slowly-not all at once. This is a great recipe and frees up your oven of other things on turkey day!

I've made this a few times with different results. I'ts yummy each time, just have to watch the mosture. One year I scooped it out to put in muffin tins to crisp. I use this for each thanksgiving to cook the 2 hour bird without stuffing in it. Will use each year from now on!

As to the broth, I have only added it when I was cooking in a dish and not the bird, and then only about 1/2 cup. I use fresh bread, which wouldn't need as much broth. I saute the onions in butter and that gives it the moisture. Think I will add some of the turkey drippings to it as well.

We used less then the amount a chicken broth asked for.  It was all mush.  So disappointing.  The flavor was good but the texture not so much.  We might try again though and see if we can improve it!

Great! As far of the issue of how much broth to use, I started with about a cup, then added two more over the cooking time. It definitely was moist enough without the remaining cup.

I followed the direction almost exactly. I used one bag of Orowheat dry corn bread cubes and almost all of the broth the recipe calls for. This came out much better than expected. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent stuffing, the best I've had!  These ingredients really do make it perfect.  Note: if you don't have dry bread subes, it's easy to make them!  Just take bread and cut it into small cubes and bake in the oven at 250° until crispy!

Delicious!  Made this for our thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it!  Added 1 can cream of corn and omitted mushrooms.  Used only 1 can of chicken broth to our preference.  This was wonderful and it was just so great to save some oven space!  Thank you!

This is awesome!!!!  Would recommend using the liner to make the clean up easier. I used 32 oz. of chicken broth and it was a little to moist so I let cook on high uncovered for the last half an hour and it was perfect. I also added crumbled bacon at the end just before serving.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving and turned out wonderful...Of course I followed the advice of others and used my chicken broth sparingly. I also used homemade cornbread rather than bread crumbs and added 1lb of sage sausage. I didnt need to cook it for as long as required either, not sure if it was b/c of the cornbread or not. It was fantastic everyone loved it and I was able to bake pies at the same time this was cooking...OH, I put it in the fridge overnight and then back on the slow cooker in the morning very low very warming. Fabulous...

Tasty and a nice way to free up the oven. I had to halve the recipe though because there was no way 12 cups of stuffing would fit in my slow cooker!! I also added italian sausage.

I made this recipe Gluten Free. Made my own bread cubes with Udi's Gluten Free Multi Grain & White breads, then followed the recipe + added some garlic to the saute mixture. The flavor was very good. The ease of using the crock pot was amazing. I wasn't thrilled with the consistency of the gluten free bread tho. I don't think this had anything to do with this recipe...just the gluten free bread part. It still worked tho, and all my non gluten free eaters ate plenty of the stuffing.

Wow this went over great at the Thanksgiving potluck I attended and everyone asked for the recipe.  The best part was that while everyone was fighting for oven space, the stuffing just cooked in the crockpot on the counter!  I used dried bread cubes from a local bakery and 4 C of veggie broth was perfect.  Thanks for an amazing recipe.  Will do this every year!!!!

This was an easy recipe to prep the day before. In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving I started buying stale loaves of herb bread from the grocery store's "Reduced for Quick Sale" rack.  I stored the bread in the freezer and took them out 2 days ahead to thaw/dry out.  I followed the recipe pretty well for the most part (I added chopped carrots for added veggies), and found the amount of broth to be just right for my mixture.  I pretty much filled the entire crock pot with bread...then as it cooked midway through, I dumped the rest of the bread in (I had enough broth to ad-lib if I needed to).    The stuffing tasted wonderful!  It is moist, just like we like it.  It went well with our turkey gravy.  It is even better the day after (and after)!  My husband says the flavors are better than the boxed stuffing.  This is definitely a keeper in my family.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it works out great.  Flavor is really nice, and it's so moist.  Not having it in the bird, makes the bird cook faster, and no worries about bacteria.  Great idea.

This was very good.  I actually adjusted it to make it lower calorie. Instead of butter i used 2 tbsp garlic canola oil and about 1 cup vegetable broth.  I did not use fresh parsley or mushrooms, but I did use dried parsley.  I used a combo of country white bread, sourdough, and multi grain.  I actually used closer to 15 cups of bread crumbs, which fit in my slow cooker fine.  I probably did use close to the 4 cups of broth.  I just added enough to moisten the bread, and checked and added more about every hour.  I cooked on low for about 4 hours.  It would have been very good with something sweet- apples or cranberries.  It was really good anyways.  Great and easy recipe!

I read multiple reviews but none saying they used cornbread vs. bread.  I prefer cornbread, so decided to go ahead and make my own cornbread like I usually do and then go with the remainng ingredients because I thought the spices and other ingredients sounded like a great combination.  I was not disappointed - the flavor combo was awesome. My hubby doesn't "like" mushrooms, so I chopped them up small and he never even knew they were in there, but they added wonderful flavor.  Also, I opted to cook in the oven as an alternative.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  I will make it again.

Very Good stuffing, however I ended up cooking in my oven rather than the slow cooker.  I used a combination of bread cubes (day old, peppridge farms, & off brand of large dried cubes).  I used all 4 cups of chicken broth and should have used more....i can see how the different type (size) of bread cubes used would determine how much chicken stock is needed.  I omit the eggs, family perference.  Looking forward to trying this in a crockpot.

This is our new Thanksgiving tradition!  Absolutely fabulous!  I used 2 loaves of fresh wheat bread, cut it up into chunks and let it sit overnight.  I only used about 2 1/2 cups of broth and it was perfect!

I used the crouton-like bread crumbs and only needed one can of chicken broth (about 2 cups). Put in slow cooker on high for 30 minutes, then turned to low for 4 hours. Delicious!

Never thought of using the crockpot for dressing before.  What a great idea!  Used only 2 cups broth and it all turned out wonderful.

really helped saved oven space!! It was absolutely excellent. I used French Bread cubes that I'd let dry out for two days and also added some grated carrot. I also used fresh sage. I just added a bit of broth as I went along and it turned out great. Also, I did not do the 45 minutes on high, just kept it on low for about 4 hours....GORGEOUS!! :)

Oh my gosh I'm with the few reviewers who wonder what went wrong.  It was totally unedible!  I followed everything except omitting mushrooms and the taste was bitter...and it was a mess of mush.  And no I didn't add too much liquid - I added just enough to wet the dry bread cubes that I used.  The bottom burned to the pot (crock pot) and the top was MUSH.  It was disgusting and I'm totally bummed out since this was for Thanksgiving.  If anyone has tips or ideas on what went wrong, please tell me!

This was a hit with my family.  I added 1/2 pound cooked sausage.  Took the top off a little at the end so it wasn't to moist.

I have made this stuffing now for the past three or four years, it has become a favorite with hubbies family. I used the full amount of broth but I baked mine, turns out perfect. I also added a pound of breakfast sausage and the giblets. I use the bagged bread cubes so I know the broth will get soaked up. YUMMY!

Oh my goodness this recipe was sooooo good.  I only cooked mine for 4 hours and it was pretty wet, so I will either cut down on the broth because the onion and the celery put out a lot of liquid or just add more bread cubes.  SOOOOOOO yummy!  I left out the mushrooms and the parsley as well.  This is a fantastic way to make dressing and it saves oven space!

Delicious stuffing! However I made two batches one INSIDE THE TURKEY and one in the slow cooker and the turkey batch was AWESOME ,I only added enough broth to slightly moisten the dressing and it turned out perfect.The slow cooker batch was not great at all it was mushy even though I was watching my broth usage throughout the day. I loved the turkey batch soo much that I will use it now every year..thanks so much for the recipe ..it will be enjoyed in our family for many years to come :)

I didn't prefer this method of making stuffing -- too mushy for my taste.  I'll stick to baking mine in the oven.

Great recipe. Loved the slow cooker angle...I left it on high after it was done, so it burned a bit at the bottom, but even THAT tasted good!  My additions were a pound of Jimmy Dean sage sausage, fried, broken into chunks and drained, and about a cup of dried cranberries. Everyone loved it. And it left me more oven space!

At Christmas I checked this 1/2 way through the cooking time and it's luck I did. It was goopy so I threw it into a casserole dish and baked it in the oven uncovered to dry out.  It had a nice flavour but I won't use the crock pot method again.

THE BEST STUFFING EVER!!!!  I am really picky and usually hate any stuffing not made in the bird but since 2 of us were pregnant this year I had to make it outside the bird.  This was AMAZING!  In fact I am wanting to make another turkey just to make this stuffing again.

This was my first time making this, but it was GREAT.  Followed the recipe to the tee and used all the broth.  I think next time I might sautee some oysters with the onion mix and add those, I imagine that would be good as well  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

This was a great recipe!!  It was the star of my families "crock pot" Thanksgiving dinner.  My mother forgot her roaster for the turkey so we had to compromise for loss of oven space.  The only complaint I have is that it didn't quite make enough and there weren't hardly any leftovers.  I followed the recipe except for using poultry seasoning instead of the individual spices and not as much broth as the recipe called for as recommended by other reviewers.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  Thanks so much for posting!!

I don't usually do stuffing in the slow cooker as it becomes rubbery and dry. This is the exception!  I did stir it once in awhile, though and watched carefully to turn off before it started getting too dry.

I left out the mushrooms and used 4 cups of broth.  Turned out perfect!

this was exceptional!!  After being married for 8 years this was my first year cooking the whole christmas dinner and I was eager to succeed!  This was super easy and tasted like stove top instand stuffing but better!  I followed other reviewers tips and added less water but otherwise I didn't change anything.  the flavor was wonderful!!!

Due to my husband's dislike of celery and my mother in law's mushroom allergy, I left out both.  Doubled the onion.  Added spices to cooked onions before spooning onto dried bread.  I only used about half the broth called for, more would have made a mushy mess.  SO GOOD!

It's not a good recipe if you have to read all the reviews to find out that one of the amounts is completely wrong.  Not only far too much broth, but too much butter as well.

great taste, BUT: does NOT need to cook for the full time listed. 4 hours was almost too much for mine: started to get very soggy.

Fortunately I made double the recipe on this.  Half went in the crockpot, half in the oven.  The oven-cooked stuffing was a very good texture, if just a little heavy on seasoning.  The crock pot stuffing was a total failure.  It turned into a soupy, soggy, wet mess.

I have served this stuffing at the last 3 Thanksgivings that I have hosted. Its a fantastic way to make stuffing and not take up any more stove space. I do add some sage sausage, I give the sliced mushrooms a rough chop and like the other reviews I cut the chicken broth in half. I start with just adding 2 cups, if its still really dry I add a bit more and after cooking half way I take a quick taste and maybe add more if needed. My crock pot cooks really fast so I cook it on low for 2 hours.

This turned out so great.  I was a little concerned about doing it in the crock pot but I didn't have any other option since my oven was being used by a ton of other things.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't usually like stuffing, liked this one.  I ended up using a loaf of french bread and cutting it into cube and letting it sit out for a couple of days.  I used about 3 cups of the broth.  I will definitely make this again for next Thanksgiving.

Stuffing came out great.  I put it in the oven at 350 for about half an hour when it was done cooking just to get some color.  Great idea to slow cook the stuffing!

I was told by many that this was the best stuffing they've ever had.   Didn't need as much broth and forgot the parsley... used a whole loaf of french bread.  Awesome, will make again and again and...

Hummmm! De-lish!!! Easy! I used seasoned bread cubes and was able to skip the spices, I also skipped the mushrooms. And it was soo good easy and freed up some space in the oven for all the other good stuff! I got 5 stars at the Thanksgiving dinner!!! It's a keeper and will now become a tradition!

I was very pleased with how this turned out. I am usually put off by stuffing because the flavor is always so intense and overpowering. This stuffing, however, had a very nice flavor that was not overpowering at all. I followed the recipe exactly except used chopped carrots instead of mushrooms otherwise my family wouldn't have touched it!! Great recipe! Thanks!

This was some of the best stuffing I've ever had.  Really easy, and cooking it in the crock pot is a nice touch with a big dinner since it frees up oven/counter space.

Four stars for method, five stars for flavor. Keeping this in a crock pot is a good idea, but does NOT need more than an hour to cook. I had mine in for four hours on low, and it was mushy. This would've been perfect in the oven instead, great flavor!

RAVE REVIEWS FOR THIS STUFFING.  I FOLLOWED RECEIPE, BUT USED SEASONED BREAD CUBES, SO ELIMINATED THE SEASONINGS.  STUFFING WAS MOIST AND TASTY, AND FREED UP MY TIME AND SPACE IN THE OVEN.  AFTER IT WAS DONE, PLACED IT IN A PAN SPRAYED WITH COOKING SPRAY AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN ON WARM, UNTIL MY TURKEY WAS DONE, WHICH I ALSO COOKED IN THE SLOW COOKER.  THIS IS A KEEPER

I made this stuffing for the first time.  I added some to the turkey and cooked the rest in the slow cooker.  Everyone loved it.  The slow cooker method tasted every bit as wonderful as the stuffing that I put in the bird.  This is my new favorite recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you for this post.

Loved this one, especially b/c I could plug it in and set it aside until everything else was ready.  The flavor from the seasonings was very good and everyone loved it.

This is my go-to recipe. I've made it multiple times, and it's turned out great each time. I leave off the poultry seasoning & mushrooms because I hate both of those things (besides, the sage, thyme, and marjoram are basically poultry seasoning) and substitute vegetable stock for the chicken (have a few veg heads in my acquaintance). I cook it in the oven in a 9x13 pan with the full quantity of broth with no problems.

I didn't have any marjoram and could not find any in the grocery store near my house.  I don't know what it tastes like but I just threw some celery seed in just to have another seasoning. Everyone liked it.

Good flavor.  I used one loaf of bread and cut it up into cubes and baked them lightly to dry them out.  Used 2 1/2 cups of broth and that was a little too much.  Next time will use 1 1/2 then add more if needed.  Was a little too soggy with 2 1/2 so I put it in a 9x13 and baked it at 350.  It helped.

The idea is great but you really have to watch this stuffing.  I have a rival smart pot crock pot.  I put it on high for 45 mins and then on low but my stuffing was burnt around the edges in 2 hours.  The middle part tasted great.  Next time I think I'll just put it on low the entire time.

This is so good!  I used fairly fresh bread, so I didn't need anywhere near the amount of broth the recipe called for and then I stuffed the turkey with part of it and baked the rest in a greased dish and both were so good that it is now the day after Thanksgiving and I am making a second batch because the family ate it all.  I love the thought of doing it in the crock pot, I just didn't need to do that - it worked out great.  I will use this recipe from now on..thank you for the recipe.

The flavor was excellent, however, it was way too mushy and wet (and I used very little chicken broth).  The stuffing burned onto the sides of the slow cooker and after having used 12 cups of bread, I think we got about 6 regular sized servings of stuffing after throwing out the burned part.  I will make this again, however, it will be made on the stove top and baked in the oven.  The slow cooker thing just didn't work for me!

Well. I halved the recipe and used a bag of store-bought wheat bread, and 2 cups of broth. One cup added right away, and the second after the 45 minutes on high. After 5 hours, I ended up leaving the lid off and turning the slow cooker back on high to attempt to boil off the excess liquid. The stuffing tasted quite good, but looked pretty gross. I will probably try this again since so many other people sound like it was more successful. I'm guessing the photo was taken prior to cooking...

MMMMM.  We bought some fresh 7 grain bread from the store and made our own bread crumbs in the oven for this.  It has a great flavor, and sure beats the stuff out of the box!

I just finished making this and tasted it - awesome!  The flavor was so good.  In the past the stuffings I've made have been bland.  I used two 10 oz boxes of stuffing - they say it's 16 cups.  I made giblet stuffing so I boiled the giblets and chopped them up and used the liquid for the broth, it was about 4 cups.  I added the entire amount because it was just moist and I used the paper towel trick.  I remove the paper towel just before I turned the crockpot to warm because it might start to dry out.  My 8 year old daughter tasted it and said she was in heaven.

I didnt totally follow the recipie, but I must tell you it turned out great. Instead of buying all of the seasonings I got a pepperidge farm preseasoned bag to put in. I took out the mushrooms and added sausage. I only used 2 cups of chicken broth and I must say this stuffing is awesome!!!!

I halved the recipe and it totally filled my crock pot to the brim.  This was okay, and I love the concept of doing it in the crock pot because the turkey took up the whole oven, but I think next time I will try adding some other things to the stuffing mixture.

In my crock I used 2 cups of broth, 1/2 cup butter, fresh herbs and omitted the marjoram.  I cooked on low for 4 hours and removed the lid for the last 30 min.  This is a great recipe, but you must use stale bread!  I have tried this in the oven and was dissappointed; it was soggy throughout and never set.

You don't need to hesitate just because this says "slow cooker" stuffing. It is truly one of the best stuffing recipes we have ever used. Plus it frees up the oven. Everyone loved it. It was gone before the potatoes and gravy -- and that says something because our family LOVES potatoes and gravy.

This turned out super dry for me, but the flavor was so nice, it was still good. We just drenched it in gravy. I'll make it again and try using more liquid...

Dry out the bread (12 cups = 1 loaf, I used 1/2 brown & 1/2 cinammon rasin) for at lease 3 days. Cooked down the celery & onion in LOTS of butter.  It looks like too much butter - but you'll use less chicken stock.  I used less than half the required chicken stock and still found it too wet.  Cooked without the lid on for the entire time and it was a little less wet by the time I served it.  Mom & mom-in-law both LOVED it.  They've both asked for the recipe!  SCORE!

This stuffing was really good and easy. I used one bag of seasoned stuffing and also seasoned it with the ingredients listed. Next time, i will omit the salt when using seasoned stuffing bread crumbs. Inspite of this it was still good.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was great!  Frees up room in the oven and is simple.  I read all the reviews before making it and was a little nervous that it wouldn't turn out right.  Depending on how you like your stuffing, use the broth sparingly.  My family likes stuffing a little on the dry side, so I only used about 2 cups and it was still pretty moist.  I plan to try it again and maybe add some oysters too.  Thanks!

I don't like stuffing. I made this because my husband likes stuffing. I ended up actually having seconds of this stuff! Changes made... first we halved the recipe, and for the chicken broth we only used about a cup.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was the best stuffing ever.  It was moist and so flavorful.  I did omit the mushrooms and I took a short cut by buying dressing mix (chopped onion, celery, and parsley) from the food store. This will be the recipe I use every Thanksgiving, it was that good!

I was looking for a nice recipe for dressing to take to a work luncheon this week.  I tested it over the weekend and am I glad I did.  This dressing was swimming in butter.  It had a gummy, mushy, and sticky consistency.  I followed the directions and only changed the amount of broth at the advice of reviews to be sure I didn't use too much. 

The taste wasn't bad but I would never serve this to anyone.  I was really disappointed.  I WANTED to love this.

I was looking for a nice recipe for dressing to take to a work luncheon this week.  I tested it over the weekend and am I glad I did.  This dressing was swimming in butter.  It had a gummy, mushy, and sticky consistency.  I followed the directions and only changed the amount of broth at the advice of reviews to be sure I didn't use too much. 

The taste wasn't bad but I would never serve this to anyone.  I was really disappointed.  I WANTED to love this.

I offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner this year for my family, which was my first attempt ever at a meal so large.  This recipe for stuffing turned out great and it was the hit of the dinner.  I left out the mushrooms and used about half the chicken stock.. I think this will become a staple in our family for years to come.

I followed the recipe closely: I douled the mushrooms and used 2 1/2 cups broth.  It came out a little soggy so I put it in the oven on high right before serving to crisp-up the top.  It still was a bit soggy, but everyone raved about how good it was.  Thumbs up.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was extremely helpful that you can assemble the ingredients and throw it in the crockpot.  The only downfall was that I had used herb-seasoned bread cubes so when I had added all the seasonings from the recipe to the bread, it came out extremely salty.  I had to add more bread cubes and then use water not chicken stock to cut all the saltiness. That was my fault though! So just keep that in mind when using already seasoned bread! Other than that, the stuffing came out moist but not to moist at all.  In fact, the stuffing that was on the bottom and sides of the crockpot was crispy.  Loved it though!

This was my first year making Thanksgiving dinner, and I will continue to make this recipe every year.  My family loved it saying it was the best they'd ever had.  Cooking time was only about 4 hrs and 45 min.  I used fresh herbs and only 2.5 cups broth.  Two large loafs of bread made just enough bread cubes.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I used 3 bags of the M. Cubisons seasoned stuffing, I substituted chopped carrots for the mushrooms (preference), substituted 1 cup of orange juice for broth and omitted the marjoram (after reading other comments) kept everything else the same- slow cooked low for about 3 1/2 hrs then upped it to high for 1 hour. This is a "wet" stuffing- I like "wet" but most of my friends like a more crusty fluffy stuffing. Next time I will use a little less broth, or add the 4th bag of stuffing cubes and fluff the stuffing a little more.  I will make this again- easier to use the crock pot for sure!!!

We enjoyed the flavor of this stuffing, but even thought I cut back on the broth, we still felt it was too wet. I will probably not make this again in the crockpot.

Wonderful idea that I'll use every year from now on! So nice to not have the stuffing to worry about. My only problem was that I didn't read the reviews (I was rushing around too much I guess :)) Anyway, IMO it doesn't need the high heat setting for the first 45 min. Mine ended up being very dark brown, basically burnt, along the outside, and that was after just 4 hours. The inside stuffing was perfect, thankfully. Next time I'll just keep the crockpot set at low the whole time. Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that if you're using the commercial stuffing cubes, like Peppridge Farm, you'll need more chicken stock. Fresh bread cubes need less liquid. I used Peppridge Farm and ended up adding about 3 c. of stock. Again, thanks so much for this keeper!

My dad was so upset that I wasn't going to stuff my bird.  After this was done, however, he decided it was 'pretty good' (everyone else thought it was great, but a pretty good from my dad is a high compliment)

I didn't end up using all the liquid, just added until moist like the recipe said.

I left out the mushrooms.  My sister really liked it.  The stuffing was very moist like when it's cooked inside the turkey but you don't have to worry about food poisoning.

Worked great. The only change we made was no mushrooms. Excellent to save the space. We did need to take the lid off for the last 20 min or so of cooking to get a less mushy texture.

Good recipe.  I think I will cut back just a smidge on the spices next time.  A bit overpowering.  Overall, good and very easy to prepare.

okay, I've made this two years in a row for Thanksgiving Day and both times it has been a hit!  This year however, I forgot to add the egg before it started cooking but no worries!  It was fixed by just adding more broth...in fact, I didn't even realize I had forgotten the egg until the next day when I was putting the recipe copy away!  I let it cook for about 3.5-4 hours...no more time is needed.  Next time I make it I will add raisins and maybe some chestnuts...this recipe is a keeper! Who doesn't love saving oven space, not to mention time, on such a busy day!?

AWESOME.  I read the reviews first and made for first time this Thanksgiving.  Left out eggs.  High 45 min first hour lid off, cooked 2 hours and high with lid on, last hour lid off.  My mother in law said she thought her mother's dressing was the best until now.  Nice seasoning.  You would have thought this came from the bird.  With deep frying the bird, the only thing left in the oven was the veggies.  I of course mash potatoes early and put in crock pot as well to keep warm.  Keep the kitchen picked up beforehand so nobody has to slave over the sink.

EXCELLENT FLAVOR but beware of how much broth to use.  The recipe calls for 4.5C of chicken broth but the directions say pour broth over stuffing mixture until moist.  You could use 2C and be just fine.  You can always add more near the end if you need to but I'd find it hard to believe that you would.  Also, the condensation from the lid on the crockpot adds moisture.  The flavor is awesome, the recipe is easy.  I will make this every year but use 2C of broth or less.

I fixed this recipe for Thanksgiving yesterday (started at 5:00 AM) and I learned two things: 1) never commit to any dish that takes over 9 hours to fix, and 2) no one (my wife, my two sons nor I) like the stuffing-dressing. All of my family thought it was too gluey, sticky and tasteless.

This is the only recipe I make for stuffing.  My mother made this when I was little (she got the recipe from a crockpot cookbook that came with her crockpot).  Using fresh mushrooms is key in yumminess!  Everyone always raves about the stuffing when done this way.

This was just terrific.  I didn't add the mushrooms, and I didn't find that this was too wet. I am thinking maybe some of the problems other reviewers had with the stuffing being too wet (and thus having to add less broth) might be because of all the extra liquid the mushrooms would add.  I did the recipe exactly as written with the exception of not adding mushrooms.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 8 hours; I could've served it much sooner however because it was 'done' at probably 4-5 hours - those extra few hours just allowed it to get deeper in color, maybe a little mushier and the edges crisped up a bit.  Good stuff, would definitely do this again, absolutely.

OMG this is the best stuffing. I fried up sausage and used the drippings instead of butter. I halved the recipe because we didn't need that much and it still made at least 10 servings. It was delicious and SO easy to do in the crockpot.

I think I've finally nailed this recipe after making it for the 4th time:  DOUBLE the amount of bread (get 2 large French loaves & measure out 24 cups); use 3 eggs; skip the separate spices and just use 3 T. of poultry seasoning; DON'T USE MORE THAN 2 CUPS of broth (start w/ 1 1/2 cups); keep amounts of butter, onion, celery, parsley & black pepper the same; omit the salt entirely; DON'T COOK ON HIGH FIRST or the bottom will get hard and crusty (we actually ate this part because it tasted good but it's not really what you want) and the middle will be mushy.  This will not take 8 hours to cook; give it about 2.  Leftovers are very tasty.

My husband and I enjoyed this.  I didn't have sage or marjoram, so I upped the poultry seasoning.  I also halved the recipe and needed all the chicken broth called for.

Very good stuffing recipe ... the best part is that you make it and forget about it.  It is ready when you are without using up precious oven space.  I served it with Christmas dinner and no one was the wiser that it was cooked outside the bird.  It was definately the favorite of the children at dinner.

This was my favorite of the recipes I made for my Christmas dinner this year.  I loved the mushrooms in the crock pot and it was neccessary that I save the room in my oven.  I will make this again for sure!!  

I used fresh bread and about 1/2 the stock called for.

Wow!  What a great way to make stuffing.  Very easy and no messy turkey cleanup after.  Had to make this over the objections of significant other who really wanted traditional stuffing.  But once he tasted it, he apologized profusely and said it was better than usual.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent! Great flavor and texture with ease of cooking. This is a fail proof recipe in my book. I followed the recipe with the exception of using packaged unseasoned croutons and omitted the mushrooms. This will be the only stuffing I will make from now on.

Talk about a fantastic recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I used homemade cornbread for half the bread and the other half I used biscuits.  I also cut the butter in half and it was still very good and very moist.  I will never make cornbread the conventional way again!

This came out too mushy for us and that was even after having the top off for the last 45 minutes hoping it would dry up somewhat.  It went down the disposal after Thanksgiving Dinner.  I had hoped it would eliminate one thing from the oven.  Back to my old recipe!

This is a very flavorful stuffing. I put about 3 to 3.5 cups of broth and I would add a little every hour. I also added chicken soup base for more flavor. When it was done I popped it in the oven to bake for 30 minutes. It actually turned out perfect and everyone raved about it.

This is now my one and only stuffing! Not only is it delicious, but not having to put yet another thing in the  overfilled Thanksgiving oven is a major plus! I used 1/2 cornbread and 1/2 herb seasoned bread cubes. Also added pecans and apples. Used 2 cups of broth, and it turned out absolutely perfect.

Great recipe.  I used considerably less liquid than called for (about 2 to 2-1/2 cups) and threw in 1 lb. of mild bulk sausage.  The dressing was very moist and flavorful--but best of all, it didn't take up the oven and I didn't have to think about it!  This recipe is a winner.

This is the best stuffing recipe ever.  Once it's in the crock pot it's one less thing to worry about.  It turns out moist and wonderful.  I do add cubed potatoes and about a 1/2 cup more broth than whats called for(this is my second year making this) and it's perfect!! Thanks so much

I will make it again and again and again. It was so tasty and since I have a small oven it was nice to use my slow cooker.  I used dried bread cubes from my local bakery and use all the liquid.  It was nice and moist, but you could still dicern the individual bread cubes.  Make it, you will like it.

Great recipe!  It got rave reviews from family members who have never had stuffing made outside the bird!!  And it was so easy to make.  I threw the bread, (I used French Bread) sauted onions, celery, parsley, and seasonings together the night before in a large bowl (did not use mushrooms).  Then the next morning I put everything in the crock pot.  I added about 2 cups broth and that was plenty.  I omitted the eggs....After about 2 hours cooking on low, it was done. It was wet, but not  mushy so I just kept the lid off for a while.  Using French bread definately helped it keep shape better.  Everyone was asking for the recipe!  This is a keeper.

This is a wonderful recipe! The only addition I made was adding cranraisins and a chopped apple but I wouldn't change the spices, they were right on.  I only added 3 1/2 to 4 cups of turkey stock and that was perfect. Stiring every hour was a real help, well folding it, unless you like mush that is.  Taking off the lid the last 1 to 2 to dry out the stuffing really worked well.  Infact we served 14 guest and there were no leftovers! No complaints and a favorite of many.
This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it, I will never do stuffing any other way and this was my first time using the  crock pot for stuffing.

I made this last year, and had never made stuffing in my life. Everyone loved it, and it was so easy! I use the hard store bought bread crumbs, and start out with less than 4 cups of chicken broth. You can always add more as you're cooking. I cut up the onion and celery the night before and put in fridge so the next morning all I have to do is mix the ingredients and put in the crockpot. Definitely a time saver when you need the oven for everything else. I came back for the recipe this year. Both times I have not had to cook more than 4 hours before it is ready.

This turned out just so so for me. The flavor was great, but the texture was just too mushy for us.  It looked more like bread pudding than stuffing to me. I should have reduced the broth...live and learn!

I liked the idea of cooking the stuffing in the crock pot to free up oven space, but I thought the taste was just okay. An hour or so into cooking I checked and saw it was getting pretty crisp on the bottom, so I added some of the turkey juices, and that helped keep it moist until it was done cooking.

So easy and so delicious, I chose this for our Thanksgiving dressing this year and it was loved by all. 4-5 hours was plenty for a whole crock pot full of dressing, if you leave it cook to long it will get crispy edges.

Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Pretty much followed the recipe, except I added 1 lb. Jimmy Deans sausage and a 4 oz.can of green chile. Next time I'll use 2 cans of green chile, since I couldn't even tell it was in there. But here in New Mexico, we use green chile in everything :)

This was good, and nice because it took care of the stuffing without the use of the oven.  I used 1 cube salted, one cube unsalted butter and low-sodium broth.  I omitted the salt, but later tasted it and added a few sprinkles.  I also omitted the mushrooms and eggs.  I only used 1 cup of broth.  That was plenty for me.  I was worried it would be soggy but it wasn't- use 1 cup of broth and then go from there- you may not need anymore.  The texture of this stuffing is pretty moist; similar to that of stuffing that is cooked inside a turkey as opposed to just in a dish in the oven.    I used a mix of wheat bread and sourdough; let it dry out overnight.  I think it could use a little more of the herbs- season to taste.

Delicious stuffing!  I added extra bread and less broth.  The first time I made it I followed exact directions and it was too soggy.  I had to add bread and bake in the oven 30 minutes.

GREAT receipe! It was my first time making stuffing the "hard" way and this recipe is easy to understand and VERY good! I did add some diced apples to it too, just to give a twist to it. It really did help to do this in the slow cooker and free up the oven!

My husband likes his stuffing very moist and he said this is the best I have ever made - we have been married over 40 years!!  The only spices I used were sage and poultry seasoning and no mushrooms.  I started with 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth (14 oz. size) and added the rest gradually when I stirred the stuffing every hour or so. Started it on high for 45 min. and then 4 hours was perfect.  It was a big hit, and I will definitely use it again.  I also liked the convenience of preparation in the crockpot.  Thanks.

Awesome Stuffing Recipie!!!  This was the first time I made a "Home Made" stuffing and not from the box it was EXCEPTIONALLY good!!!  The flavoring was superb!!!  The only thing i would change is either HALF the brooth or DOUBLE the bread cubes because i only used 2 cans of the 3 needed and it was VERY VERY moist, almost TOO moist but still quite YUMMY!!! LOTS of prep work envolved and i would say takes closer to 45 min. to cut vegies/bread if your doing alone but well worth the work!!!  YUM YUM!!!

Interesting dish. 
I was confused on how to do the bread cubes- but I got a loaf of white bread, toasted and then let it sit out for 45 mins. Then I pinched off pieces into a big bowl. When I put the veggies on top of the bread- I put in all the butter. I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to go, but the final dressing was very buttery. Omit to taste. I only used a can and a half of broth (prob. b/c of butter). And put it in the crock pot. It seemed to be done sooner and then transfered over to a dish and put it in the oven til dinner time.
It turned out really good- and everyone raved about it... even my sister who doesn't like dressing. I, however, have smelled it all day, so I wasn't very hungry for it. 
Good dish, and will be a classic from now on. Thanks

This was passable, but certainly not 5 star in my opinion. We added the neck from the turkey, hoping to get more turkey flavor into the stuffing, but it was still a little bland, and the texture was too mushy for my liking.

I found this recipe a few years ago and it has become a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas in our house.  I never use as much broth as it calls for, and every time I make it I use different types of bread each with great success.  Thanks for the recipe!

I will just get in line behind the other wonderful reviews. I use Pepperidge Farm stuffing instead of bread crumbs, omit the mushrooms but add some garlic and a bit more onion. On the broth, it depends on how long I need this to reside (if we are eating early or late) in the crock pot as to how much broth I use. Great way to free up the oven which is always appreciated!

i made this for xmas dinner and it was a hit!!  it was so moist! the best part was that it freed up my oven!  i used brownberry's herb-seasoned bread cubes and because the bread cubes were already slightly seasoned, i dramatically reduced the amount of seasonings that the recipe called for and it turned out great!  it's a keeper!!

This tasted so good.  For my first time cooking the holiday dinner I was extremely nervous, but I always have luck with the slow cooker.  This was so helpful for freeing up the stovetop, and it tasted better than any stuffing I've had.  My guests were impressed.  I was able to start this the night before Christmas and it cooked for a total of about 12-14 hours, it was extremely wet, so I had to add quite a bit more bread crumbs, but the flavor was excellent!  Thanks!

Great recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving last year and it was so wonderful that I made it for Christmas too. This has become our staple holiday stuffing. It's a bonus that it frees up oven space. I typically use a couple of large baguettes for the bread. Very tasty and easy to make.

This was great.  And so nice to not have to worry about another thing needing cooking time in the oven.  I left out the mushrooms and then put about 50% more onions & celery and next time may do a little bit more.  Also made my own bread crumbs with french bread.  Only thing I will change next time is not add the salt, it tasted a bit too salty.

Absolutely the BEST stuffing I have ever had!  EVER!  It was delicious...like the other posters, I did halve the liquid amount as well as the cooking time and only cooked it for about 4 hours.  Started with about 45 minutes on high and put it on low for the remainder of the time.  Incredible recipe!

I made this recipe last year with the dry bread cubes and it was really good, but, I love homemade cornbread dressing.  This year I made the Easy Corn Bread recipe, on the back of the Quaker yellow corn meal cannister, the night before.  The next day I mixed everything together adding a little extra poultry seasoning and 1 1/2 cups broth. Later I added the rest of the broth from the can because I didn't want to waste it. I cooked on low about 5 hrs, leaving the lid off at times so it would cook quicker.  Great flavor!  Thanks!

Made this at thanksgiving to save space in the oven.  Great taste! Reminded me of my grandmother's..although in the crockpot it didn't get as "crunchy?" on the top from baking.  Would definately make again!

Excellent!  I toasted and tore up two loaves of plain white bread instead of using bread cubes and I omitted the mushrooms, but other than that, followed the recipe as written.  I followed other reviewers' advice and started with 2 cups of broth. I ended up adding maybe another 1/2 cup.  This was almost identical to the stuffing I make, but using the crockpot was awesome!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I did not think this recipe was any better than Stove Top.  I halved the recipe, but you cannot cut the cooking time in half.  Cooking it for 3 hours on low was too long and about a third of the way through the stuffing began to burn and stick to the sides of the slow cooker.  I substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and left out the mushrooms. The only good thing about this recipe is you don't have to use up oven space.

This was very good!  I used about 2-2 1/2 cups of broth.  I substituted red pepper for the mushrooms and used 1/3 cornbread crumbs and 2/3 bread cubes.  I think the red pepper gave it a nice color.  I cooked about 6-7 hours.  I made a "backup" stuffing in the oven just in case this one didn't work out.  Next year, I won't need to . . . I'll just make it in the crockpot!

Great recipe! I made 1/2 of the recipe in a 3.5 slow cooker for Thanksgiving.  I did watch the amount of broth after reading all the reviews, and I was glad I did.  I ended up using a little under 2 cups of broth and had to add a little more spices midway through.

I made this for a "practice run" yesterday and I'm glad I did.  Don't Like the marjoram at all, and it was too moist(only used 1 1/2 cans of broth).  I think it would have been ready to eat at 4 hrs. and I got a crust all around to crock pot.  I think I will try it again with ammendments.  No mushroom, marjoram less broth and less cook time.

It's been said by so many other reviewers, but- this is great!!!  I love that this cooks in the crockpot, leaving your stove top free for all those other side dishes you are preparing on Thanksgiving.  I added crumbled sage sausage to mine, and only used about 3 cups of broth.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is.  Sad to say, my family has always loved Stovetop stuffing for Thanksgiving, and didn't even want to try anything else.  I finally just went ahead and made this last year and dared them to give it a shot.  They loved it!! Now they realize what they were missing by sticking to boxed stuffing for so long.

This really turned out great.  I did add more seasoning and spices.  I added the chicken broth, as it cooked, to get the consistancy we like.  I will do this again.

Very good - but you can get away with adding less butter with same results - I have made this at least 5 times, its great.

Wow!  This is the best stuffing that I've ever made from scratch.  My only comment is that it certainly didn't take as long to cook as the recipe calls for, and I had to tend to the dish once in awhile to add more broth in order to keep it moist.  That was a bad thing because I kept sampling the stuffing by the spoonful each time! :0)  Thanks for the recipe Gayle -- it's a keeper!

Oh yeah - this was the bomb! Even better the next day. Even made a turkey pot pie with it as the crust. Great idea to put it in the crockpot as I've never liked to stuff my turkey. First time I've ever made my own that wasn't out of a box! Everyone liked it. It's a keeper!

This recipe was just fabulous!I will never cook it the traditional way again. It is a simple,easy-to-find ingredients, you throw it all in the crockpot and VOILA! Heavenly stuffing-seasoned just perfect! And the best part(besides the eating)is that it frees up precious space in your oven-while that turkey/chicken is cooking. 
I did make a small change,however. I used half the butter and every few hours I'd throw in a half-cup more chicken broth to keep it moist. And even though I put this puppy to cook at 8:30 AM, it was still deliciously moist when we served supper at 5:PM. I'm going to make this often, scaling down the recipe for our single family size-it reheats fine the next day too!

This stuffing was great. I was nervous about using a new recipe for Thanksgiving dinner, but since my oven was occupied with 22lbs of Turkey, I took a chance and will use this recipe again. The stuffing was moist, flavorful, and GONE.

This recipe was very easy to prepare, wonderful aroma, but as with a few of the other reviews, mine came out totally mushy. I wish I knew what I did wrong...

This is a great idea to prepare dressing!I took other suggestions and started with 2 cups of broth, then added as I needed. I sauted extra mushrooms and a smaller amount of onion. I got 1lb of Sage Sausage and cooked it and then added it in. The flavors were great together! My husband did not like it as much as I did, he likes very dry dressing! I think dry is boring, so that is why I loved this dressing!

My family loves the stuffing the most so this is great for Thanksgiving dinner.  I omit the egg, substitute sauted sausage for the mushrooms, stuff the turkey (making extra stuffing of course) then put the extra in the crock pot on low.  I add chicken broth to keep from drying out.
Excellent idea!

This had wonderful aroma!  I believe that I should have cut back on the broth...even though I used only 2 cups.  The texture was not appealing at all...I am sure it had something to do with the amount of broth.  I prefer a stuffing with more crunch.  Tasted wonderful.....if I could get over the texture.  Will try again because of the ease of the recipes and the fact that it saved me on stove/oven space.

The only thing missing from this recipe is the awesome crispy crust you get from baking stuffing in the oven.  Other than that, if I could give it 6 stars, I would!  Thanks Gayle!  My kitchen actually stayed cool this year!  I'll never go back to cooking it in the oven (except maybe to "crisp" it up a bit).  Serve with the Greatest Grilled Turkey recipe on this site, and you have the easiest Thanksgiving dinner ever!

This stuffing came out just right texture and tasted great. I made my own bread cubes and probably used just about the entire 4 cups of broth. From reading other reviews, it seems that if you use the dehydrated pre-made bread cubes, you probably need less broth. Anyway, I started out by adding about 2 1/2 cups of broth and added additional broth at times to keep it moist but not mushy. Be SURE to stir it at least every hour or so to keep it from sticking to the sides of the crock pot.

Imagine the joy when I discovered a Thanksgiving staple that practically cooked itself! Since we're frying our turkey this year, there had to be an alternative to the usual stuffing method. With the tight rotation scheduled for the oven, I was pleased to find this recipe. As I was cooking the initial ingredients, I could tell this one was going to tasty.  And since I put it in at 3am, I awoke to the most divine aroma that so appropriately ushered in the holiday. I've been a bit concerned that my crockpot cooks pretty hot even on low and this experience confirmed it. 8 hours in my crock was far too long as all the edges browned and hardened.  I should have probably cut that in half. Also, while the flavor was incredible, the consistency left a lot to be desired.  It was mushy...very mushy; the bread cubes having lost all their form and just melded together in a vaguely glue-like fashion. Yuck! Ergo, I believe next time I will reduce the broth by at least half and (as others have suggested) add broth during the cooking process as needed.  So, I give this recipe 4 stars for wonderful flavor and ease of preparation, but deduct a star for recipe amounts and directions. I do recommend this recipe, although with the above caveats.

I just made this recipe for Thanksgiving today )11/27/03) and it was very good.  I don't really agree with the other reviews that the amount of broth or stock is too much - the reason it calls for so much is because it's supposed to cook for almost 8 hours!  If you didn't have all that moisture, by the end of 8 hours, it would be too dry.  And if this came out burned like someone said, then the crockpot must not have been turned down to the low setting, or they didn't put enough stock in.  The only complaint I have is that mine came out a little salty, and I think that it was from the broth that I used.  Be careful with store bought chicken stock - you never really know how salty it is, because it varies from container to container.  Overall, a pretty good recipe.

I made this for my husband's thanksgiving luncheon at work and so I only had a small taste.  I thought it was wonderful.  Hubby agreed.  I left out the mushrooms and used a little over 3 cups of the chicken broth.

I found this recipe to be amazing.  Smells good, looks good, cooks good, easy easy easy to make in a crockpot.  I used it for a potluck and most complimented it - others couldn't talk because they were busy stuffing their face with it!  Everyone wanted the recipe and it was the HIT of the potluck!

We had fried turkey for Thanksgiving which is great, but you can't stuff it so therefore I got online and looked for an alternative when I ran across this recipe. I thought what a great idea using the crock pot, since the stove and oven are always in such high demand during thanksgiving cooking. This stuffing turned out GREAT! Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe. I used Italian bread instead of white bread but other then that I followed the recipe to the tea. I highly recommend it!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I omitted the mushrooms though.  I used just about one can of broth and that worked out well.  Will me making this recipe from now on instead of the boxed kind...very easy and super good!

I made this for Thanksgiving and we absolutely LOVED IT!!!  It was so easy.  I used 1 1/2 loaves of crusty white bakery bread at .99 each and cut them into slices, then let them air out for a few hours before cutting into cubes.  Then I decreased the broth to about 2 - 2 1/2 cups.  I forgot to add the mushrooms, but it was still divine...the buttery crust added to the yumminess!  I will definitely make this again...and again, and again...

This is great.  I needed a large amount of stuffing for Thanksgiving and this fit the bill.  I enjoyed it so much that I used the same recipe two days later (adding pork sausage) as a stuffing for a crown rib roast.  Rave reviews!

Amazing!!  I thought that this wouldn't work but it tasted better than the identical recipe baked in the oven. The seasonings were infused into every bite.  It also made a tasty browned and moist crust that everyone fought over.  2 1/2 cups broth were just the right amount of liquid with very dry bread to make a perfect texture! Thanks!!

Wonderful recipie, tastes as good as "in the turkey".  Used the large crockpot and followed the suggestion of others to use 3 boxes of Mrs. Cubbisons cube stuffing with three cans of broth.

My husband was very skeptical about this.  He normally makes the stuffing but I wanted to try something different since some of my family members do not like soggy stuffing or from the turkey.  It turned out wonderful!  I did not need the entire amount of broth.  I used a packaged stuffing mix and cooked it for about 2 hours.  Every half hour I would add about a 1/2 cup of stuffing mix plus a tablespoon of liguid so it would not be soggy or too firm.  My stepfather who hates stuffing actually went back for a second helping.

If you can't cook it in the bird..this is the way to do it!  Very moist and delicious. I added a half pound of sausage 'cause my boyfriend loves it, and left out the fungus (I HATE mushrooms!) otherwise this was just GREAT!

I tried this to make my thanksgiving day a little easier.  Boy did it ever!! I omitted the mushrooms, and added the broth until it was very moist.  I don't know how much I used, but the end result was fabulous.  Everyone loved it and this has officially become the new "family stuffing".  Thank you!!

This was my first time making homemade stuffing and I thought it was simple and easy, the best part of the whole thing was it did not take up any space on my stovetop while I was cooking all the other Thanksgiving dinner side dishes. I Will continue with this recipe for years to come.

I had some trouble with this one. 4-1/2 cups of broth is WAY to much liquid. The instrux say to pour in enough broth to moisten, but mine was already moist. I used 4 cups anyway and it ended up a soppy, gloppy mess. The taste was okay, but nothing special. The main virtue is freeing up the oven, which was nice.

This was good. I usually cook my stuffing inside the bird so this alternative when not cooking the whole bird. I started this before work and let it go the full 8 hours. I don't think that you need to put it on high at the beginning if you plan on the longer cooking time. I did cook up pound of Jimmy Dean sausage and added it too. I also added 2 tsp of garlic to the vegetable mixture. I also agree with other reviewers concerning the amount of broth depending on the type of bread cubes that you use. I used packed very dry bread cubes so I did need all of the broth. We love mushrooms so I may increase the amount next time.

I am giving this 5 stars because I think the basic recipe and concept deserve it.  However, I think preparing it as directed was a mistake.

Having read several of the reviews, I paid attention to type of bread and the amount of chicken stock used.  I had a drier-style sourdough bread, and the amount of stock was appropriate for it.

My slow cooker tends to cook somewhat hot, even on the Low setting, and this may have skewed the results somewhat.  I cooked it for 4 hours on Low, without a starting High setting phase, and it came out rather over-cooked (to the point where the bread was breaking down--dissolving is too strong a term, but you get my meaning).  I was checking /stirring every hour, and about the 2 hour point would have been perfect.

All this having been said, the balance of flavors was excellent, and with the adjustments I think are needed, will make an excellent dish.

This was super easy, the key is to check it to make sure its not too dry or if too wet, to vent the top of the cooker. I always add lots of onion and mushrooms, my family loves this dressing.

I read quite a few reviews and took the advice of not using as much broth. I actually didn't measure the broth but added throughout the cooking as needed.  Also, I used a tea towel to absorb the condensation so the stuffing didn't  get to mushy.  I stirred the stuffing and switched out the tea towel every hour.  (only used two towels as one dried while the other was absorbing).  I dried my own bread crumbs for a few days, which I think makes a difference.  You really can tweak this recipes to your own liking.  By adding ingredients or omitting to suit your own tastes.  I used less poultry seasoning and added pork sausage, shredded carrots and turkey drippings.  Everyone loved it!!

This is sooo good. I’ve made it in the camper and every time it comes out perfect.  As everyone noted, only add enough liquid to wet the mixture, watch it closely and add more as needed. I use the seasoned, dried bread crumbs (Mrs. Cubbisons) so add less of the fresh herbs.  Also, make sure you turn it down after 45 mins or it will dry up and burn. Love this recipe!

I made this according to the recipe, but skipped the mushrooms as we have haters in the family. An unintentional alteration was using half regular bread and half 'turkey ready' bread as no bread cubes were available. I was afraid adding the turkey- ready would be too much as I'd already added the herbs to the vegetables, but we really liked it.

Super easy way to make stuffing, especially when you have so many other things to cook for a holiday meal!  Be very aware of how much you are making because that significantly impacts cooking time and the amount of moisture you need.  I also used this recipe with prepackaged corn bread stuffing and it was just as good!

Great solution for cooking Thanksgiving without needing to use the oven.  I used chicken sausage due to guests who don't eat pork, but I think it would be much tastier with Italian pork sausage.  Hot tip from other reviewers:  Go light on the liquid and put a clean cotton towel on top of the stuffing, then put the lid on the slow cooker.  This keeps it from getting to moist from the condensation.

This would not have been edible had I not removed it from the crock pot and cooked it in the oven to finish it off.  I would definitely cut the butter quantity in half as it was really greasy (and that was impossible to cook out in the oven).   I used a little less chicken broth than it called for and it was too wet after several hours in the crock pot and some of it got too brown on the bottom in the crock pot.   I would try again but use a lot less butter and less spices and plan for time to finish in the oven.

It’s a great way to make stuffing and I will definitely do it this way again. I took the suggestion of the towel under the lid, which makes sense because you don’t want that extra liquid dripping into your stuffing. I could only find the hard seasoned cubed bread crumbs, so I cut back on the sage, thyme and salt. I took the suggestions of only starting with half the broth. I checked it after two hours to stir and added more broth as needed. After that I checked hourly,  stirring and adding more broth the longer it cooked. Mine was perfect after  4-5 hours. I wouldn’t recommend cooking it longer, it  will just make it cook down and intensify your seasoning.  I found this out the hard way after having to keep it warm for an additional 2 hours  unexpectedly.  Overall great recipe.

Made it according to the reviews using half the broth at first. It was still too soupy. I took it out after several hours & placed it in a casserole dish in the oven. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. It was much better as far as moisture, & the taste is fabulous. I think I'll just make it in the oven next time.

Delicious! Adjust broth to 2 1/2 cups broth and add more only if needed. Based on another review I added sausage and also increased seasonings from teaspoons to tablespoons.  Everyone loved it! Super easy cooking in crockpot.

good recipe and used this to give me time to do all the rest of the menu - i was warned not to add the 4 1/2 cups of broth so i just dribbled as much as i thought to just moisten the bread knowing it was easy to add more but not to take it away - i think it was about 1/2 cup  to a full cup - i started on high and went to low for only about 2 1/2 hours and it came out fine - not to dry or wet - it was just right

Wow, this was so easy, convenient to use a crockpot, and very tasty!  I omitted the mushrooms just because some in our group don’t like them.  Also cooked on high for 3 hours since I got a late start making it.  Turned out perfectly and everyone raved over it!

My guests raved about this! Did as another reviewer recommended and only started with 2 cups of stock and it was perfect. Only recommendation I’d make is in my case it was in the crockpot quite awhile and did have some burning on the bottom despite stirring frequently. Some people actually really liked that part, but next time I notice it sticking at the bottom I’ll add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of broth an hour before serving. Great recipe!

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and it is a HUGE Hit!  The only time I have altered the recipe is if I purchase herbed bread cubes instead of plain and then I just cut some of the spices in half, but otherwise it really is pretty great just the way it is.

This is good and a good way to make it if you can't use your oven. This is the same recipe as the online book club lady's.  Thanks for posting!

This is my go-to stuffing recipe for the past 4 years of Thanksgiving.  Everyone loves it...including the kids!  My only tweak is to add 1 lb of ground sage sausage.  Killer!

I made it for a work pot-luck - it was great! I was curious how it would work. I added, dried 1/2 cup dried cranberries,  (1 lb of COOKED sage sausage and 1 cup walnuts....including recipies the celery and onion and mushrooms. I also added spices sage, rosemary, and thyme, salt and pepper.  I also used a mix of cornbread and seasoned bread crumbs by pepperidge farm.  BEST ADVICE add the stock 1.5 cups ONLY and after 2 hrs and right before serving add more only as needed. This method of cooking, free's you from using the oven, but you still have to WATCH IT. The 45 minutes on high, is so you achieve SOME of that oven TOASTED effect, so I suggest you DONT SKIP this 1st step, or do it at least half of the time suggested, if possible.  But just know, you should be checking this once an hour.

Only add 1 can of chicken broth. Nowhere near 4c of broth like the recipe calls for.
I cooked on High for 1hr (and maybe more) and the bottom layer started to overcook. So stir and no more than 45 min .
I also only cooked it for about 2 hrs, not the 4-8hr

Awesome recipe! I ended up making it the day before in the oven. And just popped it back in the oven to heat up beside the turkey as it cooked. The only change was that I only used 4 cups of broth and that was plenty.

I used shredded carrots instead of mushrooms. I used only enough broth to moisten as in other reviews and the stuffing turned out perfectly. I will definitely be using this recipe again!! My family loved it !!

I left out the mushrooms but this turned out so delicious! Like others have said, depending on the bread you use add the broth as needed you won’t need all of it and keep and eye on it towards then end if it’s seems a little dry you can add more to moisten to how you want it! Definitely will be my go to!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner 2018.  It was great not having to take up oven space!   Only used about half the chicken broth to start with and then added some as it cooked.  For the bread I cubed a loaf of French bread and also baked a small (8X8 pan) of cornbread-not Jiffy mix because of added sugar and cubed that as well.  I probably used half bread and half cornbread and was careful not to stir too vigorously so it wouldn't get to pasty.  Tasted wonderful!

This was a hit with one complaint and it was my fault. I forgot the fresh mushrooms and used canned instead and I don’t recommend that. Just leave out if you don’t use fresh. The spices were a little powerful for my liking but everyone else loved it except for the mushrooms. Lol

The only change that I made was leaving out the thyme because I did not have any.  I also left out the mushrooms because no one in my family eats mushrooms. With that said, everything else was great.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and will make it again.

This was a total fail.  I wish I had read more of the comments, but I also wish people wouldn't give 5 stars for a recipe that they completely alter, it is misleading.  The recipe as is, complete failure unless you like soup with mushy bread and vegetables for stuffing.  I transferred it to the oven to try to cook off the liquid, even tried to broil to harden the bread.  Nope. Adjust the butter and chicken broth amounts and it may be a good dish.  Unfortunately, it will have to be tested on another holiday.

Have to be very careful with the amount of stock you use. I went on the low side of quantity and still baked it off in the oven for 30 mins. Absolutely delicious though, some of the best stuffing I have had.

My whole family loves this recipe. I had to make two batches because some like it soft and others like it with a little crunch.so I put the batch to get crunchy spread out on cookie sheet and just before it was about to start getting too brown. (300 degrees for 25 Mins) it was perfect!  then they drowned it in gravy on their plates.  Not a spoonful was left!  Great recipe.  I will definitely use this as .a go-to dish

This recipe had great flavor but was way too moist.  Perhaps if cooked in a open pan in the oven it would have been better.

Used 1/2 the broth, doubled the bread, and Still turned out pure mush! We has no stuffing this Thanksgiving, btw.

If I could give this a zero I would. First time I’ve ever had a bad experience with something on all recipes. I highly do not recommend this.

Terrible recipe. The first time was in the slow cooker and it turned to mush. The second time I added WAY less water and baked it and it was still mushy.

This recipe is fantastic, added Italian sausage and cooked on low for 4 hours in my slow cooker. Skipped the 15 minuets on high, saw the tip from a previous review. Perfect!!!

This was a huge hit for Thanksgiving.  The only thing I changed was I used celery and carrots instead of onions and mushrooms.  I only used 2 cups of broth and put a cloth over the cover to help with condensation.  I used Sara Lee Artesano golden wheat bread.  I used almost one loaf and the bread is a very thick sliced bread and it worked wonderfully.  I don't like my stuffing soft and mushy so I stayed away from white bread.

Excellent recipe and loved that it didn't take up valuable oven space on Thanksgiving.  Following the recipe closely, I only added enough broth to moisten the bread cubes then I checked on the stuffing every hour and added more broth if needed.  One thing---even on low this recipe took only about 3.5 hours to cook so watch for burning if you plan to cook longer.

My wife was under the weather for Thanksgiving, so the prep and cooking was on me this year... I made this recipe because the oven, toaster oven, & stove were all spoken for so the slow cooker was my last  option!  I'm pleased to say, the stuffing came out great and was a big hit... I only made a half recipe since it was only we two dining, but we still have plenty of leftovers...  :-)

Loved it!  This was my third time making it for Thanksgiving.  I make my own bread cubes and used 3 cups low sodium veggie broth and that was enough.  41/2 cups would have made it too mushy.  I think it depends on how dry your bread is.   Also I added some fresh herbs at the end - Basil and parsley.  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed directions to a T.  Awful!! It was soupy, runny, looked just awful. Taste was good, but I couldn't serve it due to the fact just how the texture was.  Waste of time totally. Thankfully had back up Stove Top

I’ve been hosting thanksgiving for years, and my dear mother raised me well, teaching me all the tricks of prepping such meals. But using this recipe as my main model earned me serious kudos this year. As in, “This was the best thanksgiving meal I’ve ever had” kudos. From my picky husband of 17 years. 

So, it’s  a keeper.  Skip the mushrooms. YUCK. Add another couple cups of chopped apples for sweetness and go easy on the broth, adding as needed. And if you’re in a rush, use the packet of seasoning in the breadcrumb package. 

And this isn’t stuffing. It’s dressing.

I used white bread crumbs that I left out for a couple of days and two cups of chicken broth and it was perfect.  My husband doesn't  like stuffing....or so he thought...but he loved this.  I also used a towel in between the lid and crock pot like other users posted and it  was a great idea! I'll definitely
Make this next year!

Great traditional stuffing  (aka dressing) recipe. I didn't change a thing and found that I did need all of that broth. The amount of liquid you use will depend on how toasted or dry your bread is, so add it gradually until you get the desired amount of moisture. I actually make this the day before so it is ready to cook on Thanksgiving.

At first I was skeptical but read all the reviews and I can honestly say it will be the only way to make dressing now!  So tasty and simple to make while freeing up the oven.  I followed the recipe accordingly and what I did was spray the crock pot with a non-stick cooking spray and cut back half the liquid and it still turned out perfect!  Definitely a keeper!

Crock pot dressing is a life saver on Thanksgiving Day.  I am giving this recipe  4 stars because I haven't made it yet, but have had this type of dressing.  Place a towel over the top of the crock pot, THEN the lid.  This will prevent the moisture from being absorbed by the dressing. I also use the crock pot liners which make for easy clean up.

I've made this for our big  family Thanksgiving the past 2 years and have gotten the request to make it again this year. I like to get 2-3 different types of bread (pumpernickel, rye, etc) and dry the cubes out the day before.

Definitely a new staple. So easy and tastes great. I did, like others, not use the amount of broth called for and used fresh herbs. Lift out the mushrooms because...ewww, not in stuffing.

Otherwise this is a sure winner. I may not stuff a bird again!!

This was wonderful with the turkey at Thanksgiving. We also enjoy it with pork chops.  I mix up  a half batch put it in the slow cooker then top with 2-3 pork chops and cook for 7-8 hours on low.  I usually reduce the chicken broth by about 1/3 of a cup then add in more if needed.

This worked quite well and definitely needs all of the chicken stock.  I used my usual ingredients (celery, onion, brown sugerr, etc)..The stuffing was done after 3.5 hours on medium (the first 45 on high) ....so don't overcook.  it was tasty but the brown sugar flavouring was lost.

Made this for Christmas Dinner per the ingredients and directions above and had it come out perfect. Although I would suggest a little added seasoning.

I made this or Christmas dinner because I was having about 20 people over. I used 2 bags of prepackaged Pepperidge Farm stuffing cubes to save time. The stuffing was a hit! I definitely needed all of the broth for this recipe. If I had used fresh bread I probably wouldn't have needed as much broth. This recipe will be used repeatedly in my house:)

I cooked some onions, celery and raisins with some margarine first to have this not to crunchy.  I then added it to the rest of this mixture.  Will make this again.  Great way to have stuffing without "stuffing" the bird.

Love that this frees up the oven! We don't use mushrooms to please everyone, but still fantastic! Made this for about 5 Thanksgiving in a row, and don't see anything changing about that. Great seasoning!

Loved this! I read through a lot of the comments below and found a technique that made this the easiest side dish for any holiday occasion. 

First off, I used dried French bread from my local bakery. it was not very hard therefore I only used about 2 cups of chicken broth. Secondly, I made this the night before and let it sit overnight. then as I put the turkey in the oven, I put the stuffing on low for about 4 hours. I did not add the mushrooms. I did however add breakfast sausage the morning of. thirdly, I would stir the stuffing every 25 minutes as well as basting the turkey. Kept it nice and fluffy. I did however notice it was getting a tad soggy due to the steam, therefore I opened the cover for the last hour. It turned out beautifully.

This was great. We don't put mushrooms in stuffing & I had to adjust the seasonings because our bread cubes were safe &  onion flavored. Also, I put it in the oven. Very tasty! Will make it again. Update: I will add less safe next time as I keep finding the bread cubes that are seasoned some. But it was terrific. Added maybe 3/4 of tge broth. Very good.

Delicious! I was scared to put stuffing in the crockpot but I was brave and did so anyways. What a difference it made in my time! I'm usually cutting and chopping veggies for stuffing late in the day when I'm about to stick the stuffing in the oven. Because I had to do everything early for the crock pot, it made my life so much easier! Alleviated space in the oven and I actually sat with my family for the first time in a decade because I had the stuffing and the green bean casserole in crock pots! Yippee!

It was delicious!  I used Romano Cheese Croutons.  I will for sure make this again.  It was the hit of the potlock.  I used all four cups of broth, BTW.  It was just right & I cooked it on high for 30 minutes because I ran out of time before leaving the house and then turning it to low or 4 hours.  It ended up just a little bit brothy at that time, but after setting on warm for about 30 minutes while everything else finished cooking, it was perfect.

I left out the mushrooms and used a slow cooker liner. Love this recipe and will definitely make it again. I used two 14 oz packages of unseasoned croutons and 4 cups of no salt chicken broth. Everyone loved it. I did get it too done on the bottom so quite crusty but some in the family liked that part too.

This makes a LOT.  That being said, it is delicious and so much better than the boxed stuffing.  Easy to prep the night before and then mix everything together in the crock pot and let cook for 4-6 hours.  Smells amazing and everyone loved it.  A great time saver!   Served with the make-ahead potatoes and Chef John's turkey.  P.S.  I intended to make half a recipe but only was able to fit about 30 ounces of bread cubes in my oval crock pot.  Still delicious!

I used the process for a simple bread stuffing I make for every Thanksgiving.  What a wonderful idea!  The slow cooker liner was a necessity.  And the stuffing was moister than I would have liked but I put it in a low profile casserole dish in the oven to dry it out a bit.  Saves oven space and produces a wonderful product!

Perfect stuffing every year for Thanksgiving! Love the method of using the slow cooker because it saves me space in the oven for other dishes. I omit the mushrooms only because my husband hates them. Sometimes I use vegetable broth or turkey broth in place of chicken broth. Just follow the recipe steps. Only add enough broth in the beginning to moisten the mixture, and then add additional broth as needed during the rest of the cooking. I check and stir the stuffing about every hour, adding additional broth if I need to.

Just made this for Thanksgiving. Used white and wheat bread that I left out to dry for 3 days. Followed recipe exactly for seasoning. Added just enough broth to moisten and cooked with a towel under the lid to keep water from dripping in as it cooked. I stirred every hour and added more broth as needed. After four hours stuffing was ready. Whole family raved about it. Will use this recipe from now on. SO EASY!

Made this for thanksgiving this year. Loved that it freed up space in my oven. Start with less broth to moisten then add more if needed. I ended up needing about 3.5 cups and it was great. Got a little crispy on the tops and edges but soft throughout with great flavor.

The taste was okay, but it was way too mushy.  I only used 4 cups broth (instead of the recommended 4 1/2), and I left the top off the cooker the last hour or so, and it was still mush.  You could not even tell there were bread cubes in it since they all merged into a gooey mess.  I'll stick with the oven from now on.  I was hoping this was a great alternative to having too many Thanksgiving items which required the oven, but it wasn't.

This is a very satisfying, easy dressing recipe.  I used local store brand stuffing (about 15 oz - a bag and a half).  It took all of the broth and could have used 1/2-1 c. more I think.  Leftovers were pretty dry.  I don't really understand putting it on high for 45 minutes.  Next time I will just keep it on low for 4 hours, stirring every hour.  Also, if I used just one bag of stuffing, then I would decrease the vegetables by 1/2 cup, but leave the herbs the same.  I used a small can of mushroom pieces and stems and that was plenty.  Overall a great recipe, just needs tweaking per personal preference.  I will make it again!

I have made this recipe multiple times.  I have learned a couple of things.  First, my family likes herb-y dressing and I have started using packaged herb-flavored stuffing along with the prescribed seasoning instead of plain stuffing.  It is perfect for us.  I also cut back on the initial chicken  broth and added it to mix as the day went along.  Finally, once the eggs are cooked, this can be moved to "warm" and stirred occasionally.  It is a forgiving recipe.

Big hit on Thanksgiving - even with those not crazy about stuffing! I made it day before as others suggested except for the egg which I added next day. Also added only 2-2  1/2cups of broth on first day - just enough to moisten. Next day added more broth - just enough to get desired moisture. I did place towel on top after cooking for awhile as suggested. I halved the recipe with no problems. Delicious.

I have made this stuffing for the last three thanksgivings in a row. Everyone raves about it every year and I make it exactly as the recipe says. For the people saying there is to much broth, the directions say to add enough broth to moisten, not dump it all in. If you follow the directions as written it will be absolutely perfect :)

I make this stuffing recipe every Thanksgiving as it is easy to prepare and keep warm in the crock pot.  As many have already stated, you need to eyeball the amount of broth.  If in doubt, err on the side of dry (about 2-2.5 cups) and you can add more broth as you go along.  Check on it frequently.  The flavor is amazing....my family asks for it every year.

I make this at every T-giving and Christmas. delicious.

 the only downsides: It takes awhile to prep and cook.  I also have to add lots more bread, as the day goes on.

This one is a keeper! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made sure to read all the reviews first and was sure to use the tea towel under the lid;  intermittently add enough broth to moisten it (4 cups); stirred frequently. Note: My mom has Celiac so I used Gluten Free Herb & Garlic croutons. It turned out great but was rather expensive. Next time I'll buy the GF bread and give it  a few days to dry out.

The flavors are there, but the consistency after the slow cooker was too mushy.  I was careful to not add too much liquid, but  the overall appearance was not very appetizing... to me.  You can kind of hide that with a ladle of gravy.

I’ve been relying on this recipe for the last few years. It’s relatively easy and tastes delicious. I don’t use all of the liquid and only add little by little.

Greatest invention since sliced bread. Next time I will do Chef John's make ahead turkey gravy, and use the meat from the turkey wings to add to the slow cooker stuffing. The only reason I used to make a whole turkey was for the stuffing, and the wing meat. Now that the slow cooker stuffing is so good, I will only make the turkey breast. Some things in life get easier, but it takes half a lifetime to figure them out!  Glad to have this one.

Great recipe, it turned out wonderfully and everyone loved it!

I used store-bought dried bread and 4 cups of broth instead of 4.5. It was still a tad  too moist at the end, but I just left the lid off the slow cooker while I finished the rest of my preparations and it ended up being perfect.

I used veggie stock for this recipe and skipped the poultry seasoning, so that my vegetarian wife would be able to eat it. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone!

Made this twice now, once for thanksgiving and once for Christmas. First was tasty but I bit mushy. Second was - well all gone! SOOO tasty. I had some non-mushroom fans complaining about the smell while it cooled away, but ate two helpings ?? the hubbs is asking for it to be the permanent stuffing recipe. A winner.

As we do not care much for mushrooms here, we left those out. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was fantastic! I expected there to be leftovers, but the pot was cleaned out! This recipe has such a great flavor, and its so easy to prepare! I have saved this for future use-plan on eating this again and again!!

This was excellent and my family is picky about their stuffing. I had one bag of Pepperidge Farm seasoned stuffing, not cubed and halved everything, no mushrooms and less than one carton of chicken stock. Put the towel under the lid and cooked it on medium for about five hours. Came out perfect. Will use this Receipe everyThanksgiving! Thank you

I Love this recipe! Will make this every year. I like no meat stuffing and i even left out the mushrooms and fresh parsley. I used fresh bread purchased a few days ahead. It was a pre-seasoned "holiday" bread so it was perfect. I still used all the additional dried seasonings listed and it was perfect. Hopefully I can find the same bread every year. Also only ended up needing about 2.5 cups of broth. Delicious!

It was delicious! I used all 4 1/2 cups of broth but also gave it the full 8 hrs on low. Next time I might use a little less sage. Mushrooms were a great addition, I used baby portobellos

Simple and so stinking good that I'll not use any other recipe from now on! Also makes decisions easier on the menu.  I don't like mushrooms in my dressing and I didn't have marjarom so there were two changes.  
Tip.........stir occasionally to avoid over cooking  around sides and bottom. 
Perfect flavor and texture for our group of fifteen.

The flavor was great, but I did the oven version of the recipe where it tells you to use all of the broth (4 1/2 cups) and it was way too much.  Knowing that now, I will keep the recipe and make note to use less next time.

I tried this out for the first time on Thanksgiving (such a rebellious move)! So easy and so so delicious. I omitted mushrooms just because I loathe them, monitored the  liquid throughout the day (in the end using less than 2 cups) and cooked uncovered the last hour to the right consistency. Thanks so much!

This was a big hit at a Thanksgiving for 40 people. I made it with whole wheat bread I allowed to dry until it was hard as brick and I used real butter.

I'm going to try this recipe again, because I think it has great potential, but I'll make some major changes.  One, the bread cubes.  I used real bread and cubed it.  I'll lay the bread out on a flat surface the night before to allow it to thoroughly dry out.  I'll also cut the butter down to 1/4 cup.  One cup of butter for this recipe is way too much.  I don't know how much broth I'll end up using.  When I used 1 cup of butter, I didn't use any broth, and it still came out too moist and mushy.  It tasted good (how can anything taste bad with that much butter!), but it looked disgusting.

Any recipe with high ratings and popularity has to be good. This was no exception. Read the reviews and adjust the chicken stock and cook time as necessary. Killer stuffing will result.

This stuffing is good, one thing though that I didn't see in the other reviews is that you need to stir the stuffing every hour or so.  Otherwise the stuffing that touches the sides of the slow cooker dries out and gets crusty.  Maybe that's obvious to everyone else but I didn't stir it and the sides kind of burnt.

Everyone loved it.  I used the following suggestions: I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter; didn't use marjoram as poultry seasoning had some and I didn't want to spend another $4; used 2 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken stock initially and didn't add more; put a kitchen towel under lid to catch extra condensation. 
 It was perfect. Oh and I used Pepperidge Farm unseasoned cubes and slow cooker liner.

Made this yesterday for the first time.  Omitted the mushrooms and added a pound of sage pork sausage.  Also sprayed the crock pot with Pam before transferring to the crockpot. Checked it about every hour, added some broth as needed and stirred.  Used most of the chicken broth over the course of cooking time.  Turned out much better than the stuffing I baked last year probably because other side dishes required different oven temps.  Made ours in a larger slow cooker and was ready in 4 1/2 to 5 hours.  Was so nice not to have a crowded oven!  Husband said to print that recipe!  A definite keeper!

I was really nervous to try this for Thanksgiving with a house full but after reading many reviews I felt I had enough information to give it a shot. I was so glad I did! I followed the advice of adding just enough broth at first to moisten and adding a little at a time throughout the cooking process.  I did not turn it on high for the first hour as  the recipe said. It cooked for appx. 4.5 - 5 hrs on low, stirring every hour and adding a little broth. I used a total of 2.5 cups of broth. The only change I made was add 6 oz  of cooked chestnuts and a tablespoon of sage and thyme. I didn't have poultry seasoning but the dried bread cubes were already seasoned. It turned out great and everyone loved it. It was so easy and  I will now do this every year. Loved having the extra room in the oven!

We loved this stuffing recipe!  In fact, everyone wanted the recipe.  I didn't change a single thing.  I used the Pepperidge Farms unseasoned stuffing, which is pretty hard and dry, so the amount of broth called for turned out to be perfect.

The flavors are amazing!  I used about 3.5 cups of broth and it was too wet -- fresh bread is the culprit is my guess.

But, it didn't matter.  It was way too tasty!

This came out PERFECT! I used almost 2 bags of the Pepperidge Farm dry bread for stuffing. I also browned some sausage and added it. I did not cook it on high at all and did what previous reviewers had suggested and put a towel over it before closing the lid so it wouldn't be mushy. I added enough broth to moisten in the beginning and then added as needed while it cooked. Next time I would pour some in the bottom before adding the stuffing because the bottom burnt a little. Will be making this every year!

I won't make this again. The flavor is very good but the consistency was way too wet and turned the stuffing into more of a bread pudding. I only used 1 cup of broth and with the slow cooker it was still too much. I guess some things just shouldn't be made in the slow cooker.

This was done in 1.5 hours! on low.  I used a 14 oz bag of bread cubes, 2 cups broth and added sausage.  Next time I'll cut back on salt (because of the sausage).  Great recipe, easy and fast!

My family asks me to make extra crockpots of stuffing for them to take home because they know there will never  be any 'leftovers' if I don't.  It's the 1 dish I NEVER sweat over and know will be perfect everytime.

This is my family's favorite  and I make it every year but do not use the amount of chicken broth as stated! I use enough to only moisten (approx. 1 cup)  the mixture & I add 1 pk of Jimmy Dean or Bob Evans  sausage,  browned & drained .  I also use the seasoned bread cubes (not soft) slow cook until sides start to get brown (appox 6 hrs) turn off & leave covered to stay warm. Everyone raves!

I've never made or liked stuffing before. But I was hosting a friendsgiving and knew I had to make it or else my dinner would be incomplete. This stuff is AMAZING. I was intimidating at first by all the spices because I didn't have most of them so I had to go and buy them. I'm glad I did!! The spices definitely made the taste. I followed the recipe almost to a tee with even weighing out the amount of mushrooms. What I did slightly differently was that I used $2 baguette bread from the store (so I didn't have to worry about drying out  my own white bread) and I used, at most, 1.5 cups of chicken broth for 8 servings. I probably could have done less too. Maybe 1.25 cups. Also listened to what other reviewers said and skipped the 45min on high and just did 4 hr on low. It was delicious.

After inviting family and friends for Canadian Thanksgiving on the second Monday in October I began thinking about Thanksgiving dinners from my childhood. In the last few years my sister has hosted this event and it is her way or the highway on cooking the turkey and making the dressing. As I was channelling the scents and flavours of my late mother's dinners I checked out the online recipes and found this one for a slow cooker dressing. The ingredients were familiar and comfortable, the method simple if it worked. Thanks to the hundreds of reviews I read I began to see the possible difficulties and used many of the reviewers suggestions to good effect. I want to thank everyone for submitting their reviews. They were most helpful and I was entranced by the peek into so many interesting Thanksgiving experiences.
 I decided to make twice the recipe as leftovers and care packages for the guests were an important consideration. I began with 4 loaves of artisan Levain bread with a heavy crust which has a strong sourdough texture, but not taste, for holding up in a dressing. I added two loaves of a white French sourdough. I air dried them for 4 days with the crusts cut off.  They were hand pulled into chunks for 3 of the 4 days then into torn into dressing size pieces for the final day before assembling. The bread was dry but not hard like commercial bread cubes or croutons. 
On preparing the onions, celery, parsley and mushrooms I used my Cuisinart to chop fine but not puree each

This has become my go-to base recipe for stuffing. It's easy to add different things to it to change the flavour slightly. Examples I use are craisins, crispy bacon, cut up leftover meat. It's always a crowd pleaser!!

Very good and easy, too. Prepped and cooked the celery and onion days before then froze until ready to assemble the dressing. I left out the mushrooms.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  The only change I made was to add breakfast sausage.  I ended up only needing 2 cups of broth.  I loved using the Whole Foods bread cubes for stuffing. That saved me a ton of time.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and we all loved it! I only used 1 tsp of salt, and I followed ChefNan's review, and I just set the crock pot on low for 4 hours (skipped the HIGH setting part). The sides were a little well done for our liking at 4 hours, but the majority of it was great! The spices and vegetable amounts were perfect! One of my little nieces is gluten-sensitive, so I made a gluten-free version, using a combination of GF bread cubes that I found at Whole Foods (in the freezer case), and some toasted bread cubes from some GF cornbread that I had previously made. I used the whole 4 1/2 cups broth, and added 1/2 cup more broth, because we like a more moist stuffing. It was so nice not to have to think about this side, but just to let it do its thing! This was great, and it would probably be awesome with sausage in it, I'll have to try that next year. I am saving it as my go-to stuffing recipe (GF or not)! Thank you!

This recipe is great and no, the amount of broth isn't a misprint. I definitely agree that it probably depends on the breadcrumbs you're using. I used two boxes of the Mrs. Cubbison's bread crumbs and that works out fine with the 4 cups of broth. I found that laying a dish towel on top of the stuffing under the lid is necessary. I also took another reviewer's suggestion of stirring every hour. This is a wonderful recipe. **
**Made this again for Thanksgiving this year. This time I made my own breadcrumbs and definitely didn't use as much broth. Just added enough until the breadcrumbs were moistened and stirred every 1/2 hour or so.

This was surprisingly delicious. I was very skeptical about making it in the slow cooker, but it browned so nicely!  I listened to many of the other reviews and only added enough broth to moisten it - maybe half the amount called for in the recipe and it was perfect. My only complaint was that I found it to be a bit too salty for my taste. I will reduce the amount of salt next time.

This was great! It tasted like we had stuffed it in the turkey. Very moist and the flavors melded excellently!

I made it with canned mushrooms and store bought bread cubes. Turned out too salty and mushy. I will re-try it but I will either use more bread or less chicken broth. I'll try it again and see if it gets better.

Tried this today.  Followed advice of others and added broth a bit at a time.  Sprayed the crock-pot first to keep it from sticking.  Just low -sodium broth to start, then later on added turkey broth from cooking the gizzard and neck.  Chopped up the gizzard and liver and stirred it into the stuffing and added a handful of chopped walnuts per another reviewer. Stirred it several times and kept adding broth to my preference.   It was delicious and the smell was out of this world when you took the top off.  A definite keeper!

Excellent recipe. I ended up having to divide it into two 5 qt. crockpots. It cooked perfectly. I used packaged stuffing mix, one cubed and the other was normal stuffing mix. I ended up adding almost 4 cups of broth. The flavors are excellent and my family really loved it. I will definitely be making this at Christmas.

I made it exactly as written except for the marjoram (didn't have any) and used about 3 1/2-4 cups of chicken broth and 3 bags of Pepperidge Farms seasoned cubed stuffing. It was perfect. If you use homemade bread cubes I can see how you would need less broth but the bagged cubes need more moisture. The reviewers that had problems were probably using softer bread. I'll be making this every Thanksgiving :)

This was by far the best stuffing I have ever eaten!! I didn't have marjoram and chose not to add tyme because I don't care for it. I also omitted the mushrooms because hubby won't eat them. I did add a pound of sage sausage and didn't add the extra sage. You don't have to use a lot of broth. It stayed moist and fluffy the entire time I cooked it. I used strohman fresh cubed bread (stuffing). Will never make any other stuffing. Thanks for sharing!!

This was not a successful recipe for me. Want to add that I did revise the recipe & added only 2.5 cups of broth...still turned out soggy. It looked sooo unappetizing....very disappointing. I will stick with oven baked stuffing from now on.

This is the first time that I made dressing that didn't come from a box. The recipe was very easy and delicious. I did add the broth in gradually, and while I didn't use all of it, I did add too much. I just chalk this up to a learning experience. This will definitely become a go-to recipe in the future.

Good and easy. Adjusted amount of liquid to 2 cups and it sadly over-dried after warming up in the slow cooker for an hour. I'd bring more liquid when warming it up.

Made this for our Christmas Family Dinner.  It was exceptional.  There was very little left over to enjoy on Boxing Day.  I will certainly be making it again.  I stirred it regularly, and added chicken broth as needed. Used store bought bread cubes.

I made a few changes due to taste (leeks instead of celery) and  lack of ingredients (no marjoram) and less broth as recommended (about 2 cups total) and it was the best stuffing I've ever had! I bet those who like celery and have the appropriate herbs on hand would find this recipe a hit as well.

We ran out of oven and stove space on Thanksgiving. I suggested to my daughter that we take her most excellent stuffing recipe and pop it into the slow cooker. And weren't we both a bit shocked when her recipe showed up as THIS recipe in a slow cooker. NO changes, came out excellent.

Really yummy.  I did use fresh herbs and my breadcrumbs we large and really dry so i did use all of the stock, but as the recipe states: monitor how much you need.  So easy for my novice  cooking as well.  This will be on my table more than just at holidays!  Ty!

I could only find herb flavored bread cubes, but was fine.  I started out with 2.5 cups of broth and added another 1/2 cup during cooking.  It was in the crockpot for 5 hours when everything else was ready & it was perfect.  Did the saute the night before & dumped it in the day of.  Super simple.  Lots of compliments.

This was pretty good and extremely easy.  I made one batch in my slow cooker and cooked a second batch in the oven for 45 minutes (to which I added craisins and chopped apple).  I have to say the one I cooked in the oven was much better.  And I agree with others, you do not need 4 1/2 cups of broth.

I mixed cornbread and herb dry stuffing; using almost 48 ounces of low sodium chicken broth to keep it from drying out.  I also did stir at least every 60-90 minutes and only cooked on high for four hours.  Within an hour of dinner service I lined a pan with cranberry sauce placed the stuffing on top and left it in the oven on 350 degrees.  The next time I make it, I'll be more experimental leaving out the mushrooms, adding raisins or nuts and not adding any extra sodium since the chicken broth has salt in it as well.

Great way to free up oven space on Thanksgiving. I have used this recipe for 2 years now and have found the amount of broth is really best to eyeball it. I start it with 2 cups then check it a couple times throughout cooking and add when needed. Generally use about 2.5-3.5 cups. Only giving 4 stars because I think this recipe as is, is a great base recipe but could use additional ingredients to kick it up to 5 stars. I will try adding sausage and more variety of seasonings next time.

This was very easy! Listen to the other reviews and don't add all the broth! I'd suggest 1/2 cup at a time until just moistened. You can always add more!

Excellent and so easy!  I used Pepperidge Farm preseasoned stuffing and added some pepper, salt, dried sage and thyme.  I eventually ended up using almost an entire box of organic low-sodium Chicken broth.  It was a bit too moist in the end, but I'll know next time to add the broth more gradually.

This was good.  I found the broth to be the right amount for 4 hours in the crock pot.  I used store bagged bread pieces that were hard.  It was mushy and not very pretty though.  I loved the crock pot part, not as much the taste.

So easy! I did not cook anything on the stove top, just threw it all in the slow cooker. I used about 3 cups of broth and did the trick with a dish towel under the lid.

I really liked how this stuffing turned out.  It was easy and saved us from an over crowded oven.  I did not use the eggs.  I did not do the 45 minutes on high.  I took the advice of other reviewers and just moistened the stuffing with broth when I mixed it and then kept moistening it as it cooked. The stuffing was kind of fluffy and very moist.  If you want a drier dressing I would do the 45 minutes on high and add less broth as you go.  The flavor was great.

I halved the recipe and left out the mushrooms. I used Pepperidge Farms herb stuffing. I didn't add all of the broth, but kinda close. I had a 6 qt slow cooker, and the edges burned despite stirring every hour or so. (30 min on high, 4 hours on low) I wasn't too impressed though everyone else liked it. I liked the use of the crockpot to save oven space, but wouldn't make it again.

Followed the advice of others by prepping ahead, using less broth and putting a paper towel over the top to absorb the moisture.  This recipe was FANTASTIC and a big hit at dinner.  My husband passed up his beloved mashed potatoes for another helping of this stuffing.... What???  That is unheard of, and my Dad raved about it as well and usually doesn't eat stuffing.   This will be a repeat recipe throughout the year.

This stuffing turned out really good.  I used vegetable stock instead of chicken since i'm a vegetarian, and also omitted the egg due to my nephews food allergies.  I used dried bread cubes and around 3 cups of stock total.  Just one word of caution, I kept an eye on the stuffing, stirring every hour or so to bring the wet ingredients to the top.  But then I had to go out for about 2 hours, and when I came back, the stuffing had really cooked down and turned dark brown.  Still tasted good, but I would have probably turned the cooker off sooner had I been watching it.  Overall a keeper recipe!

I think 4 hours was a bit too long to cook the stuffing. Had I trusted my instincts and stopped at 3 hours then I'm sure I would have loved it and graded it with 5 stars, but I stuck to my rule of never tweaking a recipe on the first try. It tasted a bit overcooked and the bread crumbs turned into mush even though I only used not even half of the broth this recipe called for. I'll try again next time and cook it for less time and hopefully it'll be a hit.

Full disclosure - I didn't follow this to the tee. I did do the basic gist of it and it turned out GREAT! Everyone loved it and I'll be doing this again. So nice that it doesn't take up the oven. Highly recommend using a slow cooker bag for easy clean-up.
Modifications: I used about 2 1/3 cups of broth, forgot to buy fresh parsley so skipped that, did the herb pack that came with my bread cubes instead (just easier). Just use as much broth as needed to moisten it all nicely.

Made this stuffing for the first time and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly but cooked the stuffing in the oven rather than a slow cooker. I did use a lot less broth than the 4 1/2 cups the recipe calls for  (i used about 1 1/2 cups) and the stuffing was perfect. Thanks!

Really liked the idea of freeing up oven space.  I used only 2 cups of the broth and cooked on high for 1 hour then 3 hours on low.  Whole family liked it and the mushrooms are a plus...vitamin D.

I used this recipe mainly to free up the oven and was surprised at how delicious it was! I was leary of the mushrooms but they added great flavor. As previous reviewers suggested, do not use as much stock as the recipe calls for. I used two cans with 12 cups of Peppridge Farm Country Cube bread cubes. I also added a chopped up apple and a cup of dried cranberries for extra flavor. Great recipe!

It was really good.  Nice to have the oven freed up from the stuffing.  I'll be making stuffing this way from now on.  You can add to the recipe and tweak it to you and your family's taste.

Was delicious! Made it for a potluck at work & I'm making it again this Thanksgiving. I did add 3 extra cups of breadcrumbs last time and did use the 4 cups off broth...they were still moist but that's the way I like them! I might hold back a little bit on the broth this next time but it really depends on the breadcrumbs on the amount of liquid. Still a great recipe!

The flavor is wonderful, but the texture is gross.  Blobs of wet bread (with only 3 cups broth).  I have had it in the oven at 350 to fix it for 40 mins. Looks like it will need to go another 30 mins. Our family Thanksgiving is in 1 hour.  
I gave it a 4 because if you read the reviews/directions I probably put too much broth.  Anyway, next year we will have a regular oven recipe.  Especially since we went to the oven anyway. (P.S. the eggs need to be omitted)

I think you could skip the cooking on high step & just cook on low for 2 hours. Mine cooked too long and starting getting too dark. Otherwise, it was a great recipe. I liked how it freed up space in the oven & stayed warm throughout dinner too.

Worked Great!  This was a hit at my office potluck.  We had 25 eaters, and though not everyone ate stuffing, I had a tiny bit leftover after making 24 servings.  I used 1.5 tubes of Jimmy Dean Sage sausage (had it in the fridge) and only a small amount of actual sage.  Also, I got a loaf of White Mountain Bread and a loaf of French, and it worked beautifully.  The bread completely filled my 6q crock pot so the early stages of cooking was a little dicey but it cooked down nicely.  I ended up using about 2 3/4 C of chicken broth.

This is it!  Stuffing is my favorite part of Thanksgiving, and I made this recipe last year just to save valuable oven space for other things.  I was not disappointed -- it was just as good (or better) than the best stuffing I've ever made.  I can't wait to make it again this year.  Delicious!

I've made this recipe for the past 3 Thankgivings. You'll want to play with the amount of chicken broth. It's usually 3-3.5 cups that I use. It is so delicious and everyone loves it. I also add 2 cups of very finely chopped carrots in mine.

This recipe was amazing!! Easy and oh so yummy!! I used two loaves of gluten free bread from Schar. I put it in my food processor to chop it up and it worked like a charm. I used about two cups of gluten free reduced sodium chicken broth and I put a towel under the lid to absorb the moisture. I cooked it on low for six hours. I will never make stuffing any other way now that I have been spoiled with this recipe!! I left out the mushrooms as the kiddos are not a fan. Try this recipe... it will not disappoint!!!

The taste was fantastic.  Unfortunately, even after reading the reviews I added too much broth - I didn't anticipate two cups broth to be too much.  Add broth slowly; moistening takes very little broth, especially with homemade bread cubes.  I will definitely make this again. As a bonus, it worked well to prepare everything the night before with the exception of the broth and eggs.

I made this for a family Christmas supper. My Mother always added brown sugar to her stuffing and I have been trying to duplicate the flavour that everyone in my family grew up with and misses since my Mom passed away. This recipe was close to hers so I omitted the mushrooms, thyme, and marjoram and added about a 1/4 cup brown sugar to the cooked vegetables and let it cook down. My siblings and my mom's grandchildren all loved the taste and said that it reminded them of Mom/Grandma. I found it was way too much broth and so it was gummy and today when I make it I will use way less. I am going to try stuffing my chicken with it today so wish me luck!! Thanx for the memory evoking recipe.

This was easy and delicious. It was moist and best of all didn't need to stuff the bird or try to fit another dish into the oven. I will add this to my holiday menu again and again

I made this recipe for the first time on Christmas Day. Everyone loved it! It was so easy to prepare and the flavor was exceptional! I agree with the other reviews to cut down on the amount of broth. I added a little more than half of what the recipe called for, and it was still very moist. Next time I'll cut it back a little more, but I definitely plan to make it again - and soon! My husband asked me if he had to wait until I was making turkey again to have this dressing. That's a NO, honey!

I read the other reviews and did what they said and it turned out delish...with some modifications:
2 1/2 cups of turkey broth
4 hours in crock
Finished off with 1/2 hour in pan in the oven 
Plus I added a diced red pepper

2 main points: I did not cook it on high for 45 minutes and I prepared the mix (minus the beaten eggs and the broth) the night before, which I enjoyed. I had to work on TG day at 7am and cooked it in my crock pot at work.  
 I woke up and added the beaten eggs and enough broth to moisten the mixture before I left the house and brought extra broth to moisten as needed.  I only ended up adding a few splashes of broth while cooking but I did need to stir it frequently.  I noticed that although it LOOKED like it might be soggy, it was actually very fluffy and a great texture.  I only gave 4 stars because I had to stir it so frequently to prevent it from burning, and I only cooked it on low for less than 4 hours.  Everyone said it was great1

This stuffing was tasty but 4.5 cups of stock is way to much. I used 3.5 cups which was still too much it was a bit mushy, 2.5 is plenty!

I loved this because of the butter flavor.  Also, The better left it so moist I didn't even need chicken broth.  I think next time I make it I'll reduce the butter to 1/4 cup.

Everyone loved it.  Definitely don't need more than about 2 cups of broth and can be done in 2hrs...just depends how 'mushy' you like it.

This is an AMAZING stuffing recipe.  However, I would definitely half the liquid and add more if you need it later.  Other than that, a huge hit with my crowd from husband to small kiddos.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving with Udi's gluten free bread cubes and it turned out wonderful!  I didn't really measure the chicken stock, I just mixed in enough to make the cubes moist and added a little to the crock pot after a few hours so it didn't dry out.  I also tossed in a handful of cranberries for a little sweetness to go with the savory and it was dee-lish! (I may add some diced granny apples next time too)   Thank you for this recipe!

Best stuffing ever! I have been cooking Thanksgiving meals for 16 years now. Every year I try a new stuffing recipe because I had yet to find one that I had liked. My search is over!! Simple to make , love that it was done in the crockpot so as to free up oven time!! I used fresh rolls of French bread and wheat bread. Cut them in slices and dried out in oven til crunchy. This recipe got rave reviews from my family, will never try another stuffing recipe!! Thanks so much for sharing!!

This recipe was great, you just have to tailor it to match what type of bread you are using (per other people's suggestions).  I used the store bought dried stuffing mix and used less than 4 cups of broth; just pour in enough to moisten the bread, no more.  I actually substituted veggie broth to make it vegetarian.  If you buy the seasoned stuffing, you probably don't need to add all of the spices, just be aware so you stuffing isnt over seasoned.  I cooked the celery, onion, and thyme in the butter then just mixed everything in the slow cooker and turned it on low for ~5 hours.  I added diced green apples and a splash of broth every so often, stirring it.  Came out perfect!

Made for Thanksgiving, minus the mushrooms. Used exaclty 4 cups of chicken stock. The only thing is that it cooked faster than 4 hours, was ready before then, not sure if its my crockpot, but overall, was really good. Will make again.

I tried this for our Thanksgiving meal...keeping my fingers crossed that it would be as good as the reviews said. It was a hit.  I did add 1lb of Bob Evans sage sausage, and made the night before (with the exception of the egg and chicken broth). It was great! I think I ended up using 3 cups of broth. My husband said it was the best stuffing he has ever had!

I used the recipe as a base. I didn't have all the herbs, so I modified that. I also did sausage and fresh cranberries. I left out the celery because I don't like it. I used the bagged stuffing. I wanted this recipe because it was crock pot based, and it and the reviews gave me guidance to make it perfect. I added just enough liquid to moisten, and then I checked it as it cooked, and added as I went along. It was perfect stuffing and it save me room in my oven!!

Just made this again today, and it was utterly delicious!!  Instead of the dried seasonings/herbs, I used fresh minced thyme and sage (those plastic clamshell fresh herbs available in every grocery store), and substituted granulated chicken bouillon for the salt.  I prepared it all yesterday, stored it in the crockpot in the fridge and then cooked it today on "high" for 2 hours before serving -- perfection.  My family ADORES this recipe (heck, they ask for it in July)!

Definitely convenient especially if you need the oven space.  The flavor was just ok for me.  I tasted it after a couple hours and added some more herbs.  I halfed the broth and it was still very moist.

I make this every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's fabulous! Just add your broth slowly over the entire cooking time.

Excellent for thanksgiving. The entire family was crazy for it last year. I started with a quarter of the broth and added more as it was cooking. AMAZING

Question for anyone who has made this - I bought Pepperidge Farm cubed stuffing that says it already has herbs and spices. Do you know if I still add all of the spices to it that the recipe calls for, or are the recipe's spices assuming people are starting with unspiced bread/stuffing to begin with? Thanks for any input previous users can provide!

Delicious!  I always add a roll of Jimmy Dean sausage and up the seasonings a bit.  I have had the bottom scorch in the slow cooker before, so I may have been too conservative with the broth. I now make sure to monitor/stir as needed towards the 4 hour mark.

My mom and I both made this last Thanksgiving and had the same results:  OK flavor but NOT a time saver!  You have to stir it every half hour or so, and you'll check it much more often than that. We both decided it was done [different slow cookers and elevations] at 6 hours which may help those who would like a tighter window than "4-8 hours" when planning their cooking timeline. Regular stuffing/dressing cooked in a casserole dish just goes into the oven, and out again in under an hour.  A slow cooker cannot produce the evenly crispy brown loveliness on top and solid warmth throughout you get from baking dressing in the oven; some parts charred, some parts were a little gooey, despite our attentive babysitting.

I would have given 5 stars but was a little too moist for our liking.  Next time I will add less chicken broth. Good recipe, I did add sausage that I saute with onion and celery, added a nice flavour.

This will be my third Thanksgiving using this stuffing. Everybody loves it! Freeing up the oven and not having to check on it makes it just perfect. As many others have already noted, the liquid to add is a very subjective amount. It will depend on the bread you use, I've just learned to start out small and be ready to add. Yum!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this turned out inedible.  It was insanely bland, but the flavor it had was bad.  I may try it again sometime just because I can't believe anyone gave this 5 stars...I must have done something wrong!

This was pretty good stuffing for being so easy.  We used the amount of liquid called for on the side of the bread cube box and it turned out a teeny bit dry being made in the crock pot, but that was good for us!  Will probably make again next time I need to save oven space at a holiday meal.

Gayle, I'm sorry....I just can't give this a great rating because there is something not quite right with this recipie.   Pro's-taste is phenomenal!!!! That is why I gave this recipie two stars instead of one.  Con's-I followed this recipie to the LETTER and it does not come out like the picture (pretty, colorful, chunky dressing).  After cooking this at high and low temperatures as instructed....the colors and texture blends together into one, mushy brownish pile (think of thick mousse).  Not to mention there was a little grease floating on top due to having two whole sticks of sticks of butter in it.

Everyone raved about this at Thanksgiving. It was delicious and I'll be making it every year. I added sausage and only used enough broth to moisten the bread, approx. 2c. Thanks!

This was sooo good.  I only made a couple of small changes and used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I am vegetarian and I did use 2 bags of cornbread stuffing bread cubes.  It was so moist and yummy and seasoned perfectly.  My kids loved it also.  I never thought to make stuffing in the crock pot, but so glad I found this recipe.  It was great!!  Thanks for the great recipe that I will use every Thanksgiving!!

I decided to try this out for Thanksgiving this year.  It was my first year to make stuffing so I gave this one a try.  All I can say is WOW.  I can not bring myself to EVER buy another box of Stove Top.  I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I didn't add all of the chicken broth as suggested by other reviewers.  This turned out incredible and was a hit with the family.  Will make again!

THIS IS EXCELLENT!!!  I followed the recipe to a T, taking note that the chicken broth is a variant ingredient.  I had two 32 oz boxes of broth and wound up using only about half of one box (2 C) if not a little less.  I used a slightly moister bread cube (not like a crouton dry type) and  I cooked mine for aprox 4 hrs, left the lid off for about the last 20 min and it was perfect.  I think if you use a more dry bread cube you will need more chicken broth, regardless add a little at a time as it is easier to add liquid than take it away.  I also had extra bread cubes on hand so if it was too moist i could add some more bread as this would help "take away" some liquid.  I had people who don't generally eat stuffing trying this at our Thanksgiving dinner and LOVING it!  I even got requested to make it for Christmas dinner.  The only complaint i have about this stuffing is that there wasn't any left over.

I read almost every review on this site before making this stuffing. I was a little nervous but needed all the room I could get in the oven so making this dish in the crockpot seemed like a great option.    The reviews were all dead on...this recipe is basically fool proof. As long as you limit the amount of broth used (I only used one can!), you can't mess this up. I will defintely make it again.

This recipe is incredible--I've made stuffing for many years, but this is the best ever. This will be my permanent recipe from now on! I love making it in the crock pot, as it makes one less thing to worry about at dinner time and frees up the oven!

Wish i had stopped to read all the reviews before making this stuffing. It was a horrible soggy mess. Huge disapointment not sure why it has so many stars when you can't go by the reciepe. I might try again but with a lot LESS of the liquid.

Made this over the weekend to test it before Christmas. We loved it. I think that I would stir it part way through as the middle was a bit soggy and the outside cooked harder. Mixing it should even that out a little. Mine was easily done in 4 hours, so I turned the crock pot to "warm" and it was ready when we were! Highly recommend this as an easy way to serve this wonderful side!

This stuffing turned out really well.  I followed the advice of others- added a kitchen towel just under the lid of the crock pot; and started out with 2 cups of broth- and added the rest slowly as needed.  My husband said this was the best dressing I've made.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and it was great - the family loved it. However, prior to making, I read many reviews and made the following tweaks to the recipe: added garlic, apples and carrots, added chicken broth as needed and cooked it on high for 1.5 hours and on low for 1.5 hours.

Great flavor but WAY too much butter -- next time I will halve the butter and not add the eggs... will just monitor for texture and add more broth if needed for moisture (used about 2.5 cups with 2 day old bread left out to dry)

I've never rated a recipe so low before! I tried this recipe because I really didn't want to worry about the stuffing at all on Thanksgiving. Instead, I fretted all day long that the stuffing was too wet--which it was entirely! I only used 1 14.5 oz can of broth and even added a little extra dried bread cubes. In the end I pulled the stuffing out and tossed in the oven to dry out-and it came out ok. The amount of seasoning called for is too little--I tripled the amount! Never again!

EXCELLENT!!  Kept on low for 8 hours-just added broth as needed.  My son loves dry stuffing-he ate around the edges and my father likes "wet" stuffing, so everyone was happy.  Will use this recipe and technique next Thanksgiving.

Made this on Thanksgiving everyone just raved about it!!! A few people don't care for mushrooms so I left those out but would leave them in if I were just making at home. I read the prior reviews and started off with about 2 cups broth and during the cooking process added another 1-1 1/2 cups. Flavorfull and moist!

i halved the recipe because we were only 7 adults.  i was very impressed with this recipe.  it tasted just as good (if not better!) than the box stuff. ;)  i actually used my rice cooker rather than the slow cooker because my slow cooker was holding the turkey.  i have to say, it was tasty AND fast in the rice cooker!  two thumbs up.

Thank you, Gayle! I grew up with and LOVED my Grandma's basic dressing/stuffing recipe. However, since she cooked by memory, we wrote down the ingredients but not the measurements. However....and thankfully so....your recipe was very much like hers, complete with measurements. And I made the "oven version". THANK YOU....my dressing turned out just like my Grandma's! :) :)

ps...I've tinkered with the recipe, since then. I cut down on the celery (about 2 stalks), the sage, and just dried-out then ripped up one loaf of white bread. However, I'm still VERY grateful to you Gayle because this recipe (which I bake, BTW) is just like my Grandma's.  Thank you for reviving the wonderful memories. :)

Perfect first time on Thanksgiving!  I omitted the mushrooms and substituted about 1/4 cup raisins (both at my mother's suggestion).  I had left my bread open in a bowl on the counter for 2 days, but it was still soft in places.  Therefore, I needed only about 2 cups of broth.  I added broth and stirred until each piece of bread was moist, but not soaked.  I cooked it on high for 1/2 hour, then on low for 4 hours, stirring about 3 times total.  I suggest using a quality crock pot.  It had a wonderful flavor, texture, and color.  My husband repeated that he doesn't like stuffing but he really likes this!

My familys reply when I told them I was making Thanksgiving stuffing/dressing in the slow cooker, REALLY!? During the cooking process everyone said,"Smells so good but, not sure about getting that crust though." When it was time to eat everybody had seconds and told me I had to make it again. I added more fresh mushrooms than the recipe called for so less broth was required. The sides and bottom had abeautiful crust like everyone wanted. Highly recomended when oven space is an issue.

I've made this for two Thanksgiving meals and everyone enjoys. Great flavor and very easy to make. I don't use mushrooms b/c husband dislikes and still comes out tasty. Permanent addition to our Thanksgiving meal!

Loved this stuffing.  I used low sodium chicken stock and ended up adding all the salt back in, FYI!  Needed more pepper than suggested as well.  Use FRESH herbs- it makes all the difference! Rated it four stars instead of 5 because with only 4 cups of chicken stock, the stuffing became soggy in the crock pot so I transferred the stuffing into a 9 x 13 pan and baked uncovered for 30 minutes to dry it out, a bit.  (Kind of defeats the purpose of a crock pot recipe.)  But I will definitely make again, just because it is SO EASY!

I am giving it 5 stars because when all was said and done, it got rave reviews. I made it ahead as suggested by another reviewer. I added the broth little by little until I got the consistancy I wanted before adding all to the slow cooker. I checked after and few hours and it was turning into a soggy mess when I stirred it. I tried covering the top with foil, but that did not seem to help. I saved it by putting the lid on cross-ways and letting alot of air into it, stirring often. It dried out perfectly and was a hit. In the future, I will start out with the lid askew and adjust as needed. The flavors were great! Having limited oven and counter space, I had the crockpot in the laundry room out of the way and it worked perfectly. I will fix my stuffing this way from now on.

Loved this stuffing....I did increase the spices to our liking....and loved the mushrooms in this. The key to this recipe is to keep stirring and "fluffing" this stuffing every hour or so. Ours was perfect, not gummy or solid like other reviewers had said. I also added the chicken broth as needed, so it was not over mushy. Perfect and stayed nice and hot and loved the whole crockpot aspect. Will most def. make again! Delicious!

Very soggy.  I thought the slow cooker would free up some oven space however I needed to put it in the oven for a better consistency.

I doubled the recipe and split it up between the bird and the crock pot. Loved the flavor. I accidently picked up preseasoned bread cubes so I changed up the seasoning a little and I always reduce the salt. I must have put to much broth in my crock pot it was a little mushy so I mixed with the stuffing form the bird. Everyone loved it. I love that this gives my more oven space! I will make this every year.

A good starting place, like many others I made a few changes, I have a small cooker, so I started out with 1 C liquid, but slowly added more later.  It worked out well, because I also have a small kitchen.

Would give this more stars if I could.  Would have eaten the entire bowl if I could.  This stuffing is the BOMB!  As mentioned by others, cut the broth in half.  Will look for reasons other than Thanksgiving to make this stuffing again.

Just served this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! Loved the fact that it freed up space in the oven. Also, since I didn't stuff the turkey, it cooked faster and the meal was done in no time.  I also agree with the "too much liquid" comments. I started with 2C of broth, and added as I went along. At one point (about 4C's) the stuffing was a little too moist, so I just added a few more handfuls of stuffing mix and cooked it for the last hour with the lid off. PERFECT!

I've made this a couple of times & both times had the dressing get hard and crusty along the sides & bottom of the crockpot even though the setting was on low, broth was added and time frame was correct.

This is the first time I had to make dressing and I was a little nervous...but it turned out YUMMY!!  My husband, kiddos and my dad loved it.  I did make a couple of changes: 1) I added 6 cups cornbread and 6 cups bread (mix of wheat biscuits and stale french loaf) 2) added garlic to onions & celery.  Since we are southern I think I will add more cornbread next time, but it was still fabulous and I had some big shoes to fill.

Loved this old-fashioned stuffing recipe. It has been years since I have made dressing like this and it was my favorite part of Thanksgiving. I only used 1/2 c. of butter, 3 c. ck broth, no mushrooms. I added 2 peeled & diced apples to the celery/onions and 3/4 c. of raisins to the stuffing. I had left over homemade bun in the freezer that I used for the bread cubes and it worked nice.  I doubled the seasoning but not the salt. It was perfect.  No leftovers though. The crock pot worked perfect and nice not to need more oven space.  It was moist and not dry. Yum.

Loved this recipe- so EASY and it made extra room in the kitchen AND kept the stuffing warm all through dinner. I used about 2 1/2 cups of broth, it was perfect. Just moisten with the broth till all the bread cubes are moist and then stop pouring the broth in and you will be good. Excellent recipe!

I was a little hesitant about making stuffing in a  crockpot, so I read several of the reviews.  It was delicious, tasted as if it came straight from the turkey. I took it to a Thanksgiving pitch in at work, and everyone wanted to know how I made the dressing.  I did not add the mushrooms, omitted the thyme and marjoram, started with 2 cups of broth.  I also baked a turkey, and added about 1/2 cup of drippings.  This was delicious! Thanks for sharing.

I stuffed the turkey with this instead of slow cooking.  Half of the amount of chicken broth was plenty.  I also added one peeled/chopped up apple then baked for about 20 min to half an hour after unstuffing from the turkey.  I typically don't love homemade stuffing, but this was the exception - it turned out to be moist and extremely flavorful.   I'll definitely use this recipe in the future.

This recipe sounds amazing and I really want to try it this Thanksgiving, but I can't see anywhere on my slow cooker what size it is.  I was wondering does anybody know if I halved the recipe would I halve the cooking time (that may not be a good question but i'm still learning).  Any help would be much appreciated!!  Lexi x

Finally an easy and delicious stuffing recipe!  When I melted the butter and added the onion and celery I also added all of the seasonings - then poured over the bread cubes.  I also only added 2 cups of chicken broth and baked it in a casserole dish instead of using the crockpot.  I LOVE this stuffing recipe!!!

Great for when you are running short on oven space. I'd use a little more liquid next time.

This was good.  I like the idea of not having another item in the stove.  I just put enough broth to moisten my fresh bread crumbs, and it was perfect.  I think next time I will add a little sausage and dried cranberries.

FANTASTIC and it freed up space in my oven.  I added a bit more broth, but also kept my eye on it to make sure the consistency was right.  Easy to make and a hit for sure.  I omitted mushrooms, eggs and parsley, because I do not usually put them in stuffing and it still was perfect.  Will make my "outta the bird" stuffing this way from now on

Everyone loved it and said I have to make it every year.  I really didnt think it would turn our because while it was cooking it has so much liquid.  But  I let it sit for a little while before serving and it was nice.  It was also burned around the outside, some people liked the burned part better.

I read all the reviews before making this dressing and made sure to only use enough broth to moisten the mixture. The dressing was delicious and very flavorful. I can't wait to make it again!

This was an awesome recipe. I had only made stuffing two other times and it was my grandfathers recipe that my grandmother did not quite remember right....this was great. My husband, uncle and mother especially loved it. I would agree to only put in very minimum chicken broth and add as needed. I only ended up using 1 1/2 cups or so and then about 30-40 minutes before serving, I left the lid up on the crock-pot to absorb some of the moisture. Will definitely use again!

Excellent. I'm not a stuffing fan and I love this. My family raved. It was good and moist, which I liked, but mine came out just a touch too soggy. I used all the broth and cooked for 6 hours. Maybe next time I'll use a cup less broth or cook it for 8 hours or use a denser bread.

I didn't use this exact recipe but used our recipe and put the stuffing in the crockpot that didn't fit in the turkey.   It came out much more moist and flavorful than it did coming out of a casserole in the oven.

I served this for thanksgiving without ever having made it before. It was awesome and my father has been asking for it ever since. I will be making this again. I do recommend reading the other reviews on it, it can become soggy if you don't watch how much broth you are putting in.

Wonderful recipe! My family absolutely loved it. And it was so nice to be able to cook it in my slow cooker and not the oven! I left out the mushrooms and only used about 2 cans of broth, as other reviewers suggested. It turned out perfectly. Will definitely be making it again next Thanksgiving!

Awesome!!!!!! So easy to make....I did however use the bread crumbs already seasoned in sage and then didn't put the 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried sage.  Great flavor, Will for sure use next year at thanksgiving!!!

I have really come to trust the ratings of everyone here and thought this recipe would be perfect.  I only gave this one 3 stars because this really seemed to have flavor potential when I initially tasted it but when I opened the lid on the cooker - the stuffing was a big mushy mess with liquid in the bottom of the cooker. I'm not sure what I did wrong with this one.  I don't think I'll try this again.

Yikes. I really messed this one up. I didn't even add 2 cups of broth, and my stuffing came out mushed. We put it the oven to try and dry it out, but to no avail. Despite it being severly moist (it looked like mashed potatoes) it was tasty.

This stuffing was excellent.  I used the liquid from boiling the turkey gizzards and stuff (about 2 cups) because I was out of chicken broth in my freezer and cannot used canned.  For the extra liquid I poured some of the liquid from the turkey.  I got rave reviews from friends and family.

So great and easy.  I added all of the chicken broth.  BUt I should say I live in a higher elevation.  I didn't add the seasoning except poultry seasing becaouse I bought seasoned bread crumbs.  I liked that it freed up my time to consentrate on other things.

This stuffing was amazing.  I only added 2 1/2 c. of chicken broth and it was still a bit too much.  Will only add 1 c. to start next time and add more as it cooks.  Flavor was perfect!

Give this one a test run before the big Turkey Day meal.  The first time I made it, it was too mushy (DO NOT use 4 1/2 cups broth), the second time, I used less broth but it didn't bind as well.  The third time, on Thanksgiving, it came out perfect!

The taste was great but it was hard to measure the stock accurately.  The edges of my stuffing got burned...luckily some people like it that way!

My family who is very picky about their stuffing loved this recipe. I only used about 3 cups of broth and added italian sausage for some extra kick. Using the slow cooker really did free up my oven and was very useful.

It was really delicious and saved me room in the oven by cooking it in the crock pot. I used cornbread crumbs for the stuffing and it took a lot of broth to get it the right consistency.  I used 4 1/2 cups of broth just like the recipe says. Make sure that you stir the stuffing every hour or so. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Good flavor but I used about 1/2 the amount of chicken broth and it was still too mushy.. Next time will try with even less broth :)

Was pretty good.  My oven is small so I like to have some alternative cooking methods on Thanksgiving.  Used about 3 cups of chicken broth and left on low setting the whole time - works for me!

I was looking for a new stuffing this year instead of the normal sausage type. I just wish that I had read this entire recipe before I started. The serving size is 16, I was only feeding 6. I had measured, cut and cooked all the ingredients up to the bread crumbs and then realized I didn't have enough crumbs. I went ahead with the recipe cutting back on the final ingredients. It came out wonderful, everyone loved it. I also took it out of the crock and baked it for about 30 minutes in the oven just to give it a little crunch. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent.Please watch the salt content on this dish, as for me I have high blood pressure the added salt was way too much, because of the salt also in the chicken broth, I will save this recipe to make again, but with less salt I rated it a 5 slower cooker option is always great in my house, the flavors blend nice the mushrooms add moisture as well.  Thank you

It's good, I don't think it's the best in the world.  I took one reviewer's advice  and only added the amount of liquid needed to moisten it and still I got that weird puddle at the bottom of the slow cooker hours later, which I drained.   I had to cook it for the 8 hours in order for the consistency to become normal as it was pasty for the first 7.   My advice to people is to really watch how much liquid you use.

Rave reviews were received when I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner.  It was delicious. So nice to have more room in my oven for everything else. I followed others suggestion of not using all the broth at the beginning and added it as needed. I did not use all the broth even though I did use prepared stuffing mix, stuffing was very moist.

This was good, however I used just under 4 cups of broth and it was a bit mushy.  I used dried bread cubes and cooked it for about 7 hours.  Next time I might only use 3 cups of broth.  Excellent flavor.

This stuffing was really good, but the last star is honestly for the addition of the crockpot!  As a vegetarian, we have our stuffing without the turkey, and figuring out how to keep it warm was always an issue - problem solved!  I didn't have to start it at the last minute, and yet I brought it to the table piping hot!  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!

Very good flavor and the taste/texture is just like stuffing out of the bird.  I added more sage to our liking and next time will use a little less liquid since mine turned out too moist. The convenience of the slow cooker is great.  Will make again.

I've tried this recipe twice now, each with decreasing amounts of water and it still turns out too soggy.  It's such a great idea - stuffing made in a slow cooker, but this recipe doesn't get me there.  Sorry.

This is great recipe.  I have also made it with only 1/3 cup of butter and it worked out just fine with brown bread.  I do not like it with white bread since I think it is a gooey mess (but that is just my opinion of white bread).

Easy and good.  I added a little juice from the turkey at the end of cooking.  Mine only cooked on low for 1 hour past the first 45 on high. Keep checking depending on your slow cooker

This is a keeper. I was so nervous about this since it was my first time cooking a holiday dinner for the whole family, but this was wonderful. I started with 2 cups of broth and added 1 more cup while it was in the crockpot. I also only used 1 egg and left my lid off the last 30 minutes. I will never bake stuffing again!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner. It was a last minute decision so I ended up baking it in the oven at 350 for 40min. I used just enough broth to moisten the bread (I used half french bread half wheat bread). The texture was fluffy and just the right amount of moisture. (I don't like mushy stuffing.) This stuffing is the best! Thank you Gayle for the great recipe. Next time I will try making it in the crockpot.

Great recipe if you are dealing with kitchen/cooking and timing conflict... perfect example: Thanksgiving - something in the oven, stovetop full, etc. Tastes fabulous. The mushrooms really add to it. I want to make it again.

I followed the directions for making it in the oven and cut the recipe in half.  It had good flavor, but there was WAY too much butter for the sauteing part and that ruined it for me.  I should have just eyeballed the butter like I normally would with sauteing.  Next time I will not add so much butter on that step and try it in the crockpot.

This was great to be able to cook in the slow cooker. It's hard to be able to cook stuffing in the oven when you have a turkey in it.

It tasted very good but didn't look so good. I read most of the reviews before I made the stuffing. I used about 2 cans of broth and I also added 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken.I think next time I will cook it in the oven.

I think I did something wrong; mine shrunk to about a quarter crock full. I  had to add a package of stove top to stretch it out but the flavor was fantastic.

i don't think i will make this recipe again despite the fact that it saved room in my oven.  i have mixed feelings about it though because people said it was delish.  it stuck to the outside and burned (even though i sprayed it) then i scooped out the unburned part and put it back in the slow cooker.  this time it became soggy.  i cooked it the last hour and a half just to get the juices soaked up.

Loved this stuffing! So did the big group I had for Thanksgiving dinner.  I used 2 loaves of bread that I dried out first.  I didn't use mushrooms.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth as I have vegetarians in my family and they much appreciated that they could enjoy the stuffing. It tasted great! I also used egg beaters instead of real eggs.  Use just enough broth to moisten as the recipe states and it turns out great!  This recipe will be holiday tradition.

Great idea!  Best to use low sodium broth for our taste.  We added cooked pork sausage and it turned out just great!  I love that you can watch it all day to see if it needs more broth or if you need to keep the lid off too get rid of some of the liquid.  Will always cook it this way!

This the best stuffing I've ever had!!!  I've made it two years in a row now, the first year in the crockpot and this year in the oven because my family requested i make a double batch to ensure there was going to be plenty of leftovers.  when i made it in the crockpot it was a bit soggy using the amount of broth the recipe calls for, however when I made it in the oven it required a small amount more.  the best thing to do is to add until you think it is moist enough, because you can always add more, but you can't take it out.

The flavor of this was excellent, but it was too moist for my tastes.  That may have been my own fault for just blindly following the recipe amounts and not using independent judgment.  I will definitely make this again with just less liquid.

Fantastic stuffing recipe! Our guest that was bringing the stuffing this year begged off at the last minute, and I was in a quandry on when I would make the stuffing. This recipe came to the rescue! I cut and prepped the veggies the night before, and cubed up some French bread loves to dry overnight. Thanksgiving morning, the bread cubes got a bit of oven warming/cooling time between the pumpkin pie, which crisped them up great. I only used the 2 c. of chicken broth, which was plenty. But do stir the stuffing at least once an hour. I also took the lid off for the last 30 minutes (cooked it for the 45 min. on high and about 4.5 hr on low). And don't leave out the mushrooms, they really add to the recipe (and easy enough to pick out/eat around if someone doesn't like 'em).

Super wonderful. Made it on Thanksgiving Day for my first time hosting the family. It's a mix in the family--meat-eaters, vegetarian, and vegan. We made this vegan. Just substituted vegan buttery sticks and used egg replacer. Used vegetable broth. We did put a bit too much broth in--took the lid off for a while in the midst of the day to let some of the moisture steam off. It was a little mushy (me and my vegan sis like it that way) but turned out great. Very flavorful. Made the house smell great right from the go. My sister is going to replace her vegan mushroom dressing with this recipe. Awesome.

My husband and his family LOVED this stuffing.  I added a cup of craisins and used only 2.5 cups of the chicken broth and it came out perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.

The idea is terrific but what I ended up with was only passible.  I was very disappointed.  I was very careful not to over-moist the stuffing and it was still too wet.

I'm still trying to figure out where I went wrong with this recipe.  I did not use store bought bread cubes, but instead opted to make my own (sat out several days before hand to dry out).  An hour before we were supposed to eat, I tasted it and was horrified to find out that it was warm soggy bread (no resemblance to stuffing whatsoever).  I tried to remedy the situation by placing it in the oven uncovered for 30 minutes, but it just turned out to be a mess.  Sorry, but I'll resort to stuffing the bird as usual next year.  Lesson learned.

Great taste, I used about 3 1/2 cups of the broth.  I think the secret is to stir it in slowly.  whole family loved it and helped save time and space useing the crock pot

This is real similiar to what we usually make for Thanksgiving dinner only we usually cook it in the oven - which is usually full of other stuff! Next time I think we will cut down on some of the butter and put the mushrooms in it (made it without because we didn't have any on hand). Good old fashioned stuffing recipe.

Delicious! Got rave reviews from everyone. I agree with other reviewers to add broth as needed. I used loaves of french bread that I toasted right before use. I added a little extra sage and some garlic to give it a little more flavor. This one is a keeper!!

I mixed this up the night before minus the eggs.  I used a bag of croutons, I chopped up some rosemary, sage and thyme.  I used a teaspoon of poultry season.  I used only 2 cups of broth for overnight.  The rest was the same.  Then the day of I mixed in the eggs and two more cups broth.  I had to add a little more broth during cooking.  It was perfect.  I did cook the gizzards and heart of the turkey with the stuffing, but it was oh so good!

I had to search for this recipe so I could make it tomorrow.  My Grandma has been making this stuffing for over 40 years and it is a family favorite.  I cannot imagine Thanksgiving without it.  She uses store bought bread crumbs in a bag, so it in neccessary to use at least 3 cups of broth.  I can see that if your bread is not extremely dry the broth would be overdone.  This is the best stuffing in the world!!

I've made this stuffing many times and I always get raves. They want to know did I really make it in the slow cooker and I tell them YES and how easy it is.I don't make it any other way now.

After reading so many reviews saying the recipe called for too much liquid I started with about 2 cups... and it was too dry! Luckily, I was able to just add more broth toward the end, and it tasted fine. Fresh sage adds a really lovely depth of flavor to this. Will definitely make again for future Thanksgivings. Thanks for freeing up more oven space!

This turned out super dry and wasn't very good.  I think if I cooked it on the stove it would have tasted great.  The ingredients smelled wonderful when I threw them together.  I also cooked ground sausage and mixed it.

This recipe is a tradition in my family! About an hour before finished we throw in about 1pound fresh shucked ousters and it is to die for! ( not every one likes ousters so often we take half out and finish cooking in oven)

Success on my first homemade stuffing attempt!!

I made this for my first time hosting family Christmas. Everyone loved it! I made the full recipe and filled two crock-pots!  
I made two loaves of homemade white bread in my bread machine. I dried it out a couple days before in my oven.I figured I got about 6 cups of cubes per loaf.
I followed the recipe and used the vegetables & spices recommended.  I used Campbell's chicken stock in the tetra pack. I think there was just shy of 4 cups in it. I added the whole thing, but did so throughout the cooking time so it was never sitting in a lot of liquid. This helped the bread from becoming too soggy. I noticed that there were a few crusty pieces in the mix, but no one complained about it. The presentation was nice & the parsley was a great touch! The flavour was excellent, and I much prefer this recipe to the Stove-Top messy mush. I will definitely make again, but probably customize it a bit to suit whatever I'm serving.

A definite keeper!

Cooking the stuffing in the slow cooker really was the best part.  The only thing that i changed was the amount of broth that i used. I followed others advice and only used 2 cups, and it was still nice and moist.  I will be using this recipe for the next holiday.

The flavors were very good, but my bread was too fresh and got REALLY mushy.  I reduced the broth quite a bit but still ended up with soggy bread.  We mixed in some additional bread cubes at the end and it helped a bit.  Everyone still liked it even though the appearance was offputting.  Will definitely make it again, but will be sure to use really stale bread.

I tried this recipe out for my Christmas dinner.  I didn't notice that you needed to cook it 8-9 hrs and only had about 2 hrs until dinner was supposed to be served.  I used all the same ingredients, but baked in the oven instead of the slow cooker, it came out delicious.  Please note- I did use less chicken broth than the recommended amount.  This is definately better than the boxed stuffing mixes.

I made this stuffing this past Thanksgiving, and it was AWESOME!!  My extremely picky spouse complained the entire morning, that I wasn't shoving the dressing into the turkey (like I did every previous year), and he couldn't get enough of it. This is a perfect 10!!!!

I tried, I really did.  I was very careful with the amount of liquid I put in and added much less than the recipe called for.  It started out great and I was really hopeful, but after 2 hours in the crockpot, I had mush.  The consistancy was really nasty, but it tasted fine.  I knew it was a failure when nobody (out of 20 people) wanted to take home stuffing leftovers.  I'll make it again, but I won't cook it in the crockpot again.

This recipe is greatfor many reasons! I adjusted the liquid to 2 14oz cans of stock plus 1 cup.  Logical because some like it dry and some like it more moist.  You can adjust the herbs as you like, dry or fresh.  But most importantly it doesn't need the oven!
It was delicious!

I rarely post reviews to the receipes I get on this site.  However, this one was such a success that I had to.  My husband (very very picky)said this was "the best" stuffing he has ever had.  Regarding the broth, I just added 1/2 and then added as needed, watching as the stuffing cooked. I made it for Thanksgiving and left my guests wanting more.  It's Sunday after Thansgiving and I'm making it for dinner again.  EXCELLENT!

This was good, but I tried it in the oven. I agree with the others who said there is way too much liquid in this. It tasted great but was way too mushy for my taste, which was unappetizing. If I had known, I would've added another 3 cups of bread. I would try it again though--great flavor.

Well I tried this recipe and added sliced waterchestnuts.  I put have in the bird and the other half into the crockpot and they both came out moist and delicious.  This is the best stuffing recipe that I have ever tried.  It's a keeper!

Very good.  I agree with the other reviewers that you won't need that much chicken broth, or the stuffing will be to soggy.

This was a great way to prepare stuffing! My DH said that it started out smelling like Stove Top (after all the time my little hands spent chopping and measuring, that was NOT the right thing to say! LOL) - but retracted his previous statement when he tasted it.. He said it was wonderful, and I had lots of compliments from it! A friend that was over for Turkey Day asked for the recipe! And for it to be cooking on it's own in the crockpot (and away from my main workspace) was especially nice! Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was so good!!  It did seem to cook a long time, but the outside got crunchy, which my brother loves.  My family was pleasantly surprised by this recipe..

This was a very tasty recipe, even my husband liked it a lot and he does not really like stuffing. I used one of the crock pot liner bags which was a good thing because before I knew it, it start to stick to the bag and I absolutely hate cleaning the crock pot. I did use extra broth at the end and added more salt. I'm not a saltaholic but I just thought it tasted better that way. I will be making this recipe whenever I want stuffing during the year.

I always make chestnut stuffing, so added chestnuts to the recipe instead of the mushrooms.  I added more spices than called for as well.  The taste was good, but I'm not sure about the consistency.  I missed not having it in the turkey!  I did not turn the crockpot to high - which was a good thing, as the outside edges of the stuffing were somewhat burnt.  Just kept it on low for 4 hours.  I would make it again, but experiment with different types of breads maybe, and work on amount of liquid as well.

I made this for about 30 people yesterday and it rocked!  It was the highlight of the meal.  I added a full package of crispy chopped bacon (and a bit of the bacon grease).  I used about half of the suggested broth and it still seemed a bit watery/soggy, so I took the cover off and  put the crock in the broiler to brown the top and dry it out. It turned out perfect!!!

I was making a lot of things for Thanksgiving so I needed to make some ahead of time items or I would have gone crazy. This recipe was excellent.  I pre-cooked everything the night before.  All I had to do on Thanksgiving day was toss in bread crumbs, chicken stock (I used half chicken stock/ half water b/c the prepped mix was too salty), and eggs, and put it in the slow cooker.  I also cooked some sausage with the sautee mix.  Overall, a great recipe.  I think it would have benefited from a handful of cranberries (poached in orange juice), but my husband is not a fan.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic!  I halved the recipe (except for the herbs) because I was making it for only 4 people.  I used store bought whole-grain bread, about 1 pound, that I cut up into cubes and dried out in my oven.  I left out the mushrooms, because I didn't have any.  I added diced apple, and cashews.  I would have liked to add some pork sausage -- definitely will next time.  I used a full 14 oz. can of broth at the beginning, and during the cooking added about 1/2 of a second can.  I think I will also increase the amount of poultry seasoning and other herbs next time, as the whole-grain bread has a stronger taste that overshadowed the other flavors.  This made for such an easy dinner prep!  I loved having the extra oven space!

It was my first time making stuffing (*ahem* dressing), and I was pretty nervous. I found this and made it because of how many great reviews it got. I left out the mushrooms, as my hubby hates 'em, and had to use a little bit of extra powdered chicken stock as my "poultry seasoning". I only ended up using about 1 1/2 cups of the broth and it came out with some crusty and some mushy pieces... Just as it should be! I stirred it about once an hour and only cooked it on low for 3 hours. Then I turned it off until we took the Turkey out to rest at which time I put it on "keep warm". It was AWESOME! Everyone raved about it!

After making this stuffing in the crock pot it will be the only way I make it now!  Came out GREAT - and my guests were asking for the recipe.  I did use less broth then it called otherwise I think it would of been too soggy. Next time I need to make more because we only ended up with alittle for left overs.

wow.  this was the first year we didn't stuff the turkey, and this stuffing came through like a champ.  so easy, the taste was fabulous, and since the crock pot kept all the moisture in, the texture was the same as if it had been in the bird.  thanks!

The oven in my apartment only has one rack and I needed to bake a lot of things, so I was going to skip the stuffing until I saw this recipe.  I left out the celery because we don't like it, used half the butter and cut up 12 cups worth of bread cubes a few days ago.  Note: the bread shrinks as it dries so you'll need more than you think!  Anyway, I thought this had a really good flavor, but next time I'm going to use three eggs and only a cup and a half or so of broth, as well as half the salt and even less butter.

This was excellent.  I have picky eaters so I didnt add celery or onion but what I did add was onion and celery salt.  It was so easy to make and with the seasonings it almost tasted like authentic stuffing from inside a turkey.

I cooked this in the oven. Only needed 14 oz. of broth. Added bulk pork sausage and left out the marjoram (just because I never use it and didn't feel like buying it). It turned out excellent. So much flavor. I will be using it as my "regular" for stuffing.

Excellent.  I have made this stuffing for the past 2 years at Thanksgiving and Christmas time.  There are never any leftovers.  The only modification I make is to add less broth.  BTW I make my own pepper and onion bread for use in this recipe which adds extra fabulous flavor!

Delish!  I don't use mushrooms since my fater-in-law has problems with them.  I also don't use the full amount of broth because I like stuffing a little drier.  I double the batch and put 1/2 in the turkey and 1/2 in the crock.  Makes the house smell heavenly and I got lots of compliments.

Yummy and so easy!  I loved not tying up the oven or stove.  I followed directions to add enough broth to moisten then added more as needed.  I didn't need the whole 4 1/2 c.  Everyone loved it.

I made this for Christmas dinner, it was terrible!  It was extremely soggy and mushy.  I put it in the over for 40 minutes, that did not help.  I was embarassed to serve it.  I'm not sure how it got such good reviews.  Usually 4 or 5 stars means the recipe is really good.  This is the first time that was way off.

This will the the fourth year that i have made this recipe. It is by far the best. If you are worried about the amount of broth to use, just put in half, and add more as the time goes on. it is really fool proof. i have never added the mushroom to this tho. BEST STUFFING EVER! MAKE IT THIS YEAR, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED, I PROMISE!

It was great to be able to fix this in the crockpot instead of the oven. Very moist, tasty and versatile as to the vegetables you may want to add.

This is a phenominal stuffing.  My mother in law thought I stole her secret recipe.  I did add in 1.5 lbs of Jimmy Dean Sage sausage to spice it up a bit!  FABULOUS!

I have tried to imitate my grandmother's stuffing for years. This is almost identical to the taste of her stuffing. It was moist, just like it had been in the bird.  A huge hit with the 30 people we served it to at Thanksgiving.  I only had to use 1 box of chicken broth to keep it nice and moist. Will definitely make again. It was easy enough to make every time my family wants stuffing!

I loved the flavor of this stuffing! So tasty, the way I would expect stuffing to taste.  Only thing is...I think if you use all the broth, it is too soggy for my taste. I should of just slowly added it until I noticed it was to my liking or maybe I might just pop it in the oven too.  But, I will definitely be using the actual recipe as my stuffing from now on...awesome flavor!!!

Too soggy for me.  I thought I screwed up and I may still have, but I read the other reviews and don't feel so bad I wasn't the only one....cause I didn't want to make as much as the recipe called for, so I tried to 1/2 it.  I probably used too much chicken broth still.  My husband loved this though.  I myself wasn't crazy about the spices.  But like I said, I "1/2'd" the recipe and I don't ever measure my spices, so I still may have used to much.  Glad I only made 1/2, there was way too much left over.
I think this recipe would be great with your own tweaking and preferences so I won't give up on it yet.  It was too easy.  LOL

Just finished eating Thanksgiving dinner and this was the best stuffing we've ever eaten!  I made my own bread cubes from fresh bread by toasting them but otherwise followed the recipe.  This is now my official stuffing recipe!

We baked this in the oven and used french bread, omitted the mushrooms, and used way less chicken broth - about 2 and half cups -(as other reviewers suggested) and it was wonderful!  We'll definitely be making this again!!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving dinner, and I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it was super soggy. The texture turned everyone off, and we had a lot of leftovers that we had to throw away. I was disappointed because normally, stuffing is my favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner. Maybe if you added less chicken broth?

I never would have thought to make stuffing in the crockpot (I'm not very imaginative), but this was great!  The taste was great, it wasn't too hard to make and I LOVE the slow cooker idea!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this for Christmas and it was REALLY WELL RECEIVED! Everyone loved it.
Changes I made: I Used Knorr Chicken Boullion-used 2 with required water. I also only had Portobello Mushrooms in my fridge--and the flavour from these were awesome! I cut the Butter down to half. 
This recipe was enough for 10 Adults and kids too. The BEST--I will make again!

I found this to be greasy and I probably didn't need to have added any of the chicken broth. I skipped the mushrooms and added a few cloves of minced garlic. This recipe gets five stars from me though because it was so good!

Some members of my family do not like mushrooms so I left those out.  I put the melted butter, spices and vegetables in the refrigerator overnight so I only had to add the cornbread/bread crumbs the next morning.  I also used chicken bullion instead of stock.  Everyone one loved it.

I've made this a few times now - once it turned out perfect. The other two times - moosh. The flavor is excellent, but the consistency is off. I even added more bread both times.

This gets better each time we reheat for another serving!  I had to cook for approx 10mins extra (using oven recipe and not slow cooker recipe), or it was soggy.  
Also made it with gluten-free bread and no one could tell the difference!!

This had really good flavor.  I used fresh bread which may have causes it to be soggy.  I ended up adding about 1 & 1/2 cups of store bought bread cubes.  Also, this works well with fresh herbs.

I'm not sure that I should review this recipe as I changed a lot - but since we did use the base I guess I will.  We used the butter, onion, parsley, bread crumbs, broth and egg.  To this we added a 1/4 c. dried cranberries, 1/4 c. diced (cooked) pork tenderloin, 1/4 c. raw cashews, 1/4 c. roasted almonds and 1 t. each Emeril's Essence, Montreal chicken seasoning, celery salt, marjoram and onion powder.  I used a mix of homemade cornbread and homemade whole wheat bread for the bread cubes.  Really, really exceptional!  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, although it tasted like a box mix. To save time I used Pepperidge Farms bread crumbs and added chicken to make it a one-dish meal.

I loved it!  The non picky eaters also did!  I was also asked for the recipe.  However my husband and sister who only like the kinds in a box didn't like it...you really can't teach an old dog new tricks!

I have never made dressing from scratch and needed extra room to cook a big dinner.  This was the best tasting dressing and so easy to make for a beginner.  Even my mother-in-law complimented it..WOW!  Two Thumbs UP ;-)

This was my first attempt ever at making stuffing and we really liked this (it was so easy)! I had seasonsed croutons on hand so I used those and left out all the spices except the parsley and pepper.  Instead of the crockpot I baked this in the oven for 4 hours at 250º with the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style recipe from this website. Along with the gravy made from the drippings, everything went together really well.

This stuffing is moist and delicious.  Its especially good that you make it in the crock pot and free up your oven on holidays.  Its one of the best stuffings I have prepared.  I added some dried cranberries and a bit fresh apple, chopped.

This stuffing was ok but not the best. I reduced the liquid and cut the cooktime and the temp but it still came out dark and crusty on the sides. I was not that impressed

This was excellent and so easy - I used french bread and also added  some stove-top stuffing b/c I was afraid I did not have enough bread.  I took this to a potluck dinner and was perfect b/c it freed up oven space.  Thank you so much

I love this recipe.  They stuffing was so moist and tasty.  I didn't any poultry seasoning so I had to modify a little.  Everyone couldn't get enough.  Definately a keeper

Very good.  I loved that my stuffing was done at dinner time and I hadn't even had to think about it.  Flavor was very nice--milder than StoveTop but certainly delicious and much healthier!  I halved the butter and increased the mushrooms 'cause we love them.  My guests all thought the dressing was yummy and so did I!

This recipe is so easy and tastes so wonderful! I made it last Thanksgiving and Christmas, and will use it again this year. Even members of my family who normally do not like stuffing enjoy this recipe. It is very easy to modify this and make it healthier or making it low-carb by using low carb bread instead of regular bread cubes or stuffing. It is great to be able to pop this in the crockpot in the morning and not worry about it again until dinner time. Good going, Gayle!

I made slow cooker stuffing last Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful.  It got cooked while the oven was busy with other things.  We don't stuff our turkey, so this freed up the oven.

This was good and a great way to make stuffing. I used about 3/4 of a 14oz can of chicken broth. My got alittle gummy so I just took the lid off for about 1 1/2 hours and that fixed the problem. I will leave out the 1 1/2 tsp. of salt next time. Will make again.

Wonderful!  I used a bisquick biscuit and cornbread muffin combination rather than the bread cubes, and checked on the edges every now and then to pour a little extra broth on them so they wouldn't be too dry and crispy...it turned out great!  I brought it to a holiday meal, and my mother-in-law was thrilled to see a recipe for stuffing in the crock pot!

I tried this recipe at Thanksgiving after almost 10 years of searching for the perfect dressing, and this is it.  My entire family loved it and we all want to have it again.  It has a great buttery flavor.  I used less chicken broth as suggested and added 1/2 pound of cooked sage sausage.  Excellent.  I can't wait to make this again, and only haven't yet because we can't stop eating it!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. Everybody loved it!! I was asked to make it again for Christmas. I ended up not having enough. I am don't eat white flour so I used whole-wheat low-carb bread instead. It was a huge hit!! I will make this recipe everytime our meals call for stuffing.

This was the best stuffing I have ever had.  I did end up adding an additional can of broth just because I let it cook the entire time.  I basically just worked with it throughout the day adding a little more broth and a little more bread.  It came out excellent!! I will never make stuffing any other way.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Everyone loved it.

I cooked mine too long. 8 hours in the crock pot is way too long. I tasted them at about four hours, and they were perfect. I wouldn't recommend cooking them so long because they were definitely overdone. I will cook them again because the seasoning was outstanding.

I made this recipe for Thanksgviving.  It was definately a hit!  I put too much chicken broth in for our liking.  It was much too mushy.  Fixed that by adding more bread crumbs.  Yummy!  Will definately make again.  It freed my oven up for other items.

This had a super taste!  I eyeballed the broth measurement.  If it ends up too wet, you can always add more bread cubes (I did half way through).

Delicious and incredibly easy to make.  I love that you don't need the oven to make this.  My family loved this stuffing.  Thanks so much...

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner this year!  Nice that I could make it in advance and free up the oven space.  I needed to cook it a little longer because I didn't saute the onion/celery mixture long enough in the first place.  It is nothing out of the ordinary, but tasted like the stuffing my grandma always made!  There were lots of compliments and no leftovers!

Stop the presses!  I HATE stuffing, but made this for my guests and wound up eating most of it myself!  I cut the liquids by half (as others had recommended) and cooked on low heat stirring occasionally.  Worked like a charm.  This will NOT be one of those dry crumbly stuffings, but rather kind of mushy.  I prefer mushy and the flavor is OUT OF THIS WORLD!

Never would have been able to make this without this recipe.  Like everyone else, I thought the flavor was awesome.  I used 3 cups of broth, will probably do 2 cups next time.  I added a lot more mushrooms than the recipe called for, and it made the stuffing a dark grey color, which was unappealling.  I think next time, I'll add the mushrooms later in the cooking time, and hopefully that won't happen so much.  Otherwise, AWESOME!!!

My very picky niece asked for 3rds on this and told me 2 days later that she wished it was Thanksgiving again so she could have more.  All the leftovers are gone and everyone raved about this stuffin.  I left out the sage and used sage sausage instead.  Very easy to make and it was great to have the oven space.

Used fresh bread and let it stale overnight.  Skipped the mushrooms, (daughter doesnt like)but otherwise followed recipe.  Was very moist, and loved not having to put it in the oven!  Forgot to turn crockpot off until clean up time, and  a small amount around edges got a little dry, but was still good the next day.

This came out really wonderful.  I will never make stuffing the old way anymore. I don't like cooking the stuffing in the bird (various reasons) and this way it was so moist and the flavors so well combined that it tasted like it had been. I don't even like mushrooms but in this they were great.  It also was so nice not to have to worry about it.  Just put it all in there and forget about it until dinner.  Thanks.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit!  I like the convenience of preparing it early and leaving it in the crock pot until dinner's ready.  It gave us more room on the stove top to prepare other dishes.

Great recipe. I agree with the 5 hours. I started it too early and 7 hours was too much, but the stuffing was great anyway. Thanks.

This was pretty good.  I only used 6oz of fresh sliced mushrooms because we're not a huge fan...and next time I think I'll leave them out altogether.  If you like mushrooms, you'll probably love them in this, though (something about the texture bothers me...).  And also, 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth was DEFINITLEY too much for me...as it was, I only used about 3 and it was very soggy!  I let it air dry for about an hour while the turkey finished, and it was better...I like firmer stuffing though, so next time I won't add so much.  Very easy, though, and great flavor!!

This was really moist and flavorful.  I fixed it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I didn't put in as much sage as it called for though.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  Everyone raved about this dish at our Thanksgiving meal.  I only wish I made more.  It was so easy to prepare, and even if it took extra time and effort, the flavor of the stuffing would make up for it.  The stuffing itself took only 20-minutes to prepare, and that included cutting and sauteing the vegetables!  I also saved much needed space in the oven, and I didn't have to babysit the dish since it was in the crockpot all day.  I added exactly 2 1/4 cups of broth (as called for in the recipe) and didn't alter any of the seasonings.  The stuffing was perfect!  I plan to make this more often than just for a holiday meal.

This is great and easy stuffing!  I cut the recipe in half (small group), which had me finished in about 1/2 the time with about 2 1/2 cups of broth.  I used one box of store-bought bread cubes, omitted the mushrooms, and was pretty heavy handed with the herb seasonings.  My only issue today was that it was REALLY salty in my opinion, but I think that was because of my quick and easy use of canned store-bought broth.  I would definitely buy low sodium broth next time AND leave out the salt from the recipe.  My family, however, didn't know what I was talking about it and ate almost all of it!
Thanks for this easy way to take care of one dish.

we added a little more spices than called, used sage sausage and added some garlic.  turned out Great! we doubled the recipe so cooked on high for 2 hrs then on low for about 2-1/2 then for the last 20 or so minutes put in over to kinda crisp it up.  as far as the ingrediants..we used 4 cans of broth for a double batch..turned out alittle mushy but it was fine for us...everyone thought it was delicious and gobbled it up for thanksgiving!  will never use stovetop again!

It was great having the stuffing out of the way
and cooking all on its own.  I used about half of
the broth called for and it would have been 'soup' with more; cooked for 4 hours on low. I used homemade bread cubes (l/2 wheat and l/2 white).  Excellent flavor.

This stuffing is so good and I loved using the crock pot and freeing up the oven.  The only change I made was using beef broth instead of chicken. I am extremely allergic to poultry.  I used less than half the broth the recipe called for.  It was not soggy at all.  Thank you for the recipe!

Recipe is fine except for the amount of broth...4 1/2 cups is way too much.  Don't know what they were thinking.  Use 1 can, which is about two cups, and it's fine.  You could use even less. Also, maybe less butter.  The two blocks is a bit much.

I made this for a pot luck; some people liked it and some didn't. The flavor was great, but it was really wet and almost congealed in texture. Maybe I didn't do something right? I definitely prefer a more bread-like stuffing. Oh, and as some others mentioned, there was a fair amount that was overcooked (burnt and hard) so I threw it out. I'd make it again, but bake it--which of course defeats the whole purpose of slow cooker stuffing!

Excellent seasonings!!!! Stuffing had great flavor. Per other reviews, I did use less broth (3 1/2 cups). Next time I would use even less. I think I would also cut back on the butter. I did use packaged unseasoned bread cubes. Next time I would use my own homemade ones, made from bakery bread. My stuffing always tastes better with homemade bread cubes. However, this recipe has the nicest combination of flavors. A real keeper for me.

I didn't have a good experience with this recipe, however it's probably my own fault. I have a small slow cooker so I had to cut the recipe in half. I left it in for just over 8 hours and when I took it out, the outer edges had gotten hard and crunchy and a burnt smell had gone through to the rest of the stuffing. I think it would have tasted ok if I'd cooked it for 4 hours at the most but still not as good as when I cook it in the turkey.

I never thought of using my slow cooker for stuffing. What a great way to make the extra dressing.  I made Oyster dressing in theslow cooker it stayed so moist I was very pleased.

Excellent! I changed my bread crumbs to cornbread and it was a huge success. this is a definite keeper.  Keep your slow cooker on low for best results.

Being a novice at cooking, I used cubbison's boxed dressing and the stuffing was burnt and mushy.  I did not make dry bread cubes and could not find any in the supermarket.  I threw it all away and made the box recipe.  I was disappointed that it didn't turn out.

My husbands family likes stuffing with sausage, my family does not. I tried this and then put the sausage stuffing in the turkey. Everyone was happy and we did'nt have a lot left over.

Great recipe!  My Dad has always been the cook in the family and is particular, and he even wanted to take some home!  Delicious and easy. I added some ground sausage as well.

I make both "bread" dressing & cornbread dressing to satisfy all my family.  This one is definitely a keeper.

This was a little moister than I like, but overall a good stuffing and so much easier to deal with, thanks!
