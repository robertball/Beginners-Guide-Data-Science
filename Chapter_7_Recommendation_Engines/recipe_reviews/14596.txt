Well, this is just fair but strays too far from a true Belgian stew - we are going back to our old recipe.  Carbonnade should have belgian or similar ale and vinegar - not  lemon juice.  

Take lean stew beef, dredged in flour - brown and deglaze pan with broth, set aside.

Thick slices of regular onions (1.5 pounds) and 6 cloves of garlic crushed - brown on low heat until onions are caramelized - very dark and sweet.  Add 2 cans beef broth, 2 tsp thyme, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsps red wine vinegar and 16-24 ozs beer like Bass Ale.

Cook 2 hours at 325, take lid off for the last hour to thicken.  Add 2 - 3 more tsp red wine vinegar and season with salt and pepper - serve over egg noodles.

I added lots more garlic and used Guinness as the beer.  Everything was great until I added the lemon juice at the end, which drowned out all the other flavors and was really over-the-top.  I'll try the recipe again (and again with more garlic and with Guinness); I'll definitely leave out the lemon juice, though.

This is the BEST beef stew recipe I've ever made!  I don't know what it was, the beer,the lemon juice, the bacon that gave this stew such a wonderful flavor, but it really was wonderful. I did the prep on the stove and then cooked it in the crock-pot. A keeper.

Having no idea what Belgium Beef Stew would turn out to be, everyone was pleasantly surprised in the depth of the flavor.  Very easy and yet flavorful, definitely will make again.

Really unusual but excellent dish.  I mean, beer and lemon juice?  With beef and bacon???  Something about the combination of flavors just makes for a fantastic, memorable stew.  I would serve this to company.

I recently used this recipe for a beer-themed party.  Though it takes 2 hours to cook, it definitely has a great flavor.  It tastes great with beer bread.  I substituted ground beef chuck and it looked a little less classy than it could've, but everyone enjoyed it.  My only problem was the large amounts of fatty bacon in the stew, and also that it was much soupier than I'd thought it would be.  I think if I make it again, I might use a bit less bacon and a little more flour.  I definitely loved the lemon taste mixed with the beer--and I don't even like beer!

This is a tasty, rather decadent stew.  Another similar recipe suggested topping it with Dijon-smeared pieces of french bread, which was yummy and might offset the "soupy" concern some have.

Too much bacon for our taste. It gave the beef a strong smoky flavor.

Very rich warming stew, although most British and Irish beef stews also use beer or stout in preperation.

For a real Belgian stew, add some essential herbs and spices: cloves, bay laurel leaves and a thyme sprig. Also we don't put flour, but a slice or two of dark bread, spread with mustard to thicken the sauce. Don't put lemon either, nor bacon. And per kilo of meat, you need two really large onions.  And the most important, we serve it with French fries, essential. Bake the fries twice to make them less greasy and more crispy. Enjoy!

Great recipe.  I used a bottle of Chimay red (a Belgian Trappist ale) and also added a twig of rosemary and thyme.

HAS to be Belgian beer, nothing else. I tried this recipe with ordinary dark beer - not the same  It must be the herbs in the Belgian beer !!

Beef was very tender & flavorful until the end when the lemon juice was added.  I normally really like lemon, but it was just too much for this dish.  Next time I would start with maybe half that amount of lemon juice, and/or do part lemon juice & part vinegar.

I was pretty excited to try out this recipe, as I live in Belgium and have had many delicious stews in restaurants & cafes here.  But after I made this I was kind of disappointed.  I followed the original recipe exactly.  The hosue smelled very good while everything was cooking, but the stew itself seemed to lack alot of flavor, and the flavors that were mixed together didn't seem to go very well, definitely not like any of the stews I've had here.  I noticed some of the other reviewers made alot of changes to the orig. recipe, maybe next time I will try some of their suggestions.

It tasted very sweet, like it had sugar in it.  I made it for myself & my children and we did not enjoy it.

Not what I was expecting but good.  I used fresh spinach because I had some on hand instead of parsley.  The family seemed to like it.  It was lighter than I expected.  I used Blue Moon Wheat Ale but next time, I'm going with a Hardcastle Dark to see if it "beefs" it up.

Excellent recipe will definitely make it again. Dark beer gives it a different depth of flavor. Served it over egg noodles to a group with great reviews.

DELICIOUS. I didn't change a thing, used an oatmeal stout for the beer, and served over egg noodles. We adored this stew!
