Have made this multiple times and it is so good! Make sure to top with parmesan cheese. I used double the amount of chicken broth which still gives you a thick soup but keeps it from drying out especially when eating leftovers. Also I doubled the amount of garlic italian seasoning garlic powder and salt for a little more flavor and used dry parsley instead of fresh.

Let me start by saying that this "dish" has great flavor. I don't think that I would call it a "soup". The pasta absorbed the broth. I will make this again and will try using 3 cans of chicken broth and fresh peas instead of canned.

Ohhh this is comfort food for me. My Mother's version is similar to this one. I top it with a nice helping of pecorino romano and sometimes make a little garlic toast with it.

I thought this was only so-so. Simple to make and comforting but I didn't think it had a lot of flavor.

I really enjoyed this one. All of the broth cooked out before the pasta was done and I had to add extra liquid just to keep it from burning. After reading the reviews I guess it's supposed to be kinda like that but I'd still add more liquid.

My family thought this recipe was just OK - nobody complained but nobody raved either. Even with the different seasonings I tasted only canned peas. We don't have a strong need to make it again.

Adding italian grated cheese of your choice makes a big difference. Use good quality canned peas is key for flavor.
