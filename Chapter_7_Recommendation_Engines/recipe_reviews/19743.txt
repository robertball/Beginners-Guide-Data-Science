Eh, this was ok. It reminded me a lot of the rub we use on our deep fryer turkeys. Nothing special in my book, so maybe others would want to halve the recipe the first time they make it so as to not have a lot of spices go to waste if you don't really enjoy it.

I left out the mace and lemon peel and halved tit he savory.  I substituted smoked paprika for the paprika and this made  an excellent seasoning for grilled burgers.
