I had a half a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic that I wanted to use up, so I found this recipe.  I made the tomato mixture ahead of time and let it sit covered at room temperature.  When it was time to assemble, I brushed my baguette slices with a little olive oil on both sides, popped under the broiler and lightly toasted both sides.  Then topped with cheese (I used a shredded mozzarella/provolone blend) and continued to broil until the cheese had just melted.  After removing from the broiler, I topped them off with the tomato mixture and it was really yummy!  I thought the balsamic/tomato combination was perfect!  This was a great little crostini that I served as a side to our soup and salad dinner!  You bet, Iâ€™ll make this one again!!

Absolutely delicious and very quick and easy.  I added finely chopped fresh basil to the tomato mixture in place of parsley.  Added a bit of garden fresh taste and the was a nice touch of color to the finished appetizers.  Yum!

A delicious appetizer! I used small ciabatta rolls cut in half and then I used a reduced balsamic as a glaze to drizzle on top right before serving. It was a hit with my friends! I also used gruyere cheese only because my store didn't have fontina. It was delicious with the gruyere but I am looking forward to trying it with the fontina cheese.

This was incredible!  I did have to make a couple small changes based on what I had on hand though.  I used regular diced tomatoes and added some garlic, dried basil, and dried oregano.  I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried.  I subbed provolone for the fontina as well.  I can't wait to make this again!

Loved it! Very easy, but delicious!  I used a multi-grain ciabatta bread which got very, very crispy when baked, but the juices from the tomato mixture softened it up a bit.  I used plain diced tomatoes and seasoned them with oregano, basil, pepper and added a clove of minced garlic.  Very simple, but unique.  The olives add a nice touch and I love the use of fontina cheese.  Provolone or mozzarella would works nicely, too!

Pretty tasty.  Hubby commented that he liked the  cheese on the bottom (instead of on top like I do with my usual bruschetta recipe) because it helped the topping to stay on the bread. Used provolone only because I forgot the recipe calls for fontina.

Ok this was really probably more like a 2.5 but I will give it credit for originality and ease of making. Having said that your putting raw tomatoes on toasted bread with some cheese and thats about it. But what I loved about it is that there seemed to be something here. I could taste things that inspired me. I think there is more to this recipe then is here right now. For starters mabye cooking the tomatoes or baking them and deffinately adding some stuff. I think that you could make a killer something out of this with not too much work or effort and keep the intent of the original idea. But the original by itself I would never repeat for sure. It would have to be seriously reworked. But it does have that pottential to make you want to do it.
