Instead of chocolate chunks, I like to use a whole package of mini chocolate chips. Halfway through baking, I take a piece of foil and cover the cake so that the top does not burn. My family loves this bundt cake--I like to serve it with either a dollop of Cool Whip or a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

Nothing special. Given all of the calories, it's especially disappointing and bad.  Guess I'm used to fresh, real ingredients and expected too much from a cake mix and boxed pudding.  I wouldn't bother with this again.

I made this cake exactly like the recipe.  I was delicious!!   I did decide to glaze it using the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze recipe from AllRecipes.  This was a fabulous combo!!  I only used half of the glaze and hope to make chocolate covered cherries with the leftover half.   Highly recommend.

Really delicious and moist.  Note that it must be a typo that the cake mix is stated as being 18.25 ounces -- it should be 15.25 oz.  I also used a pkg. (11.5 oz.) of milk chocolate chips instead of the chocolate chunks mentioned.  Bittersweet or milk chocolate, your choice.  I would suggest reading up on hints as to how to get the cake out of the pan successfully if you're not familiar with using Bundt pans.  Excellent recipe.

I had a chocolate cake mix I was needing to use when I came across this recipe.  DH is the chocolate cake eater in our house and he thought it was just ok.  A lot of good ingredients in this, but it just didn't wow.

I spent over an hour in three different stores looking for an 18.5 ounce cake mix.  I ended up using a bundt in a box mix.

Delicious.  This recipe calls for an 18.25 oz cake mix.  Can't find that size.
I bought the 15 oz and didn't adjust anything else.  I figured I would make adjustments next time if needed.  It was still very good.  At first I thought the batter might be too thin considering the difference in the cake mix size.  I would definitely make this again with no changes except for only being able to find 15 oz mix

This is an excellent cake recipe!  My dad is diabetic, so I changed it to accommodate his sweet tooth.
I bought a Pillsbury sugar free Devil's Food cake mix, used 1/2 a bag of Hershey's sugar free chocolate chips, small box of Jello fat free/sugar free pudding mix, light sour cream, and then all the other ingredients.  After baking, while waiting for the cake to cool, I microwaved 1/2 a container of Pillsbury sugar free Chocolate Fudge frosting for about 30 seconds, stirred until slightly melted, then drizzled it over the warm cake.  This cake was a HUGE hit with my entire family...I've made it 3 Sundays in a row!

Made this cake for a Christmas Eve party last night and it was a HUGE hit! The batter was so thick that I thought I made a mistake, but it came out perfect. I couldn't find a 18.25 oz box of cake mix - darn those manufacturers for shrinking everything! - so I actually bought a second box and added additional mix so that I got to the correct amount. The cake didn't look like anything special but it was so moist and chocolately, people were amazed. I dusted it with confectioners sugar at the end just to make it look a little prettier. Will definitely be making this again!!

Followed the recipe except I used chocolate chips instead of chunks and it was great.  So moist.  I bought ingredients for a glaze but never made it.  This cake doesn't need it.  Will definitely make this again.
