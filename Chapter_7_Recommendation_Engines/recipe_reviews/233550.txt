This dish was unexpectedly wonderful!    I was so pleasantly surprised with how creamy the sauce was I had to share it with my neighbors even before dinner was served. They were so impressed as well I had to share the recipe on the spot. So few ingredients and so simple makes it a fantastic weeknight busy family dinner.     My husband and kids LOVED it and came back for seconds!     I followed the recipe exactly as written but am looking forward to trying new versions in the future (ie. broccoli, chicken, mini- meatballs, red pepper).    Yum!

This was really good!  I did change a few things.  I doubled the recipe, except the broth, added 2 chicken breasts and added garlic salt.  I cooked the chicken breasts in the broth first for about 3-4 hours, then added the cream cheese, mushrooms and tortellini and cooked for another 2 hours.  I added the spinach just before serving.  I will definitely make this again.  Super easy and my baby and toddler even liked it!

We all enjoyed it.  I think the next time I make it I will add the spinach closer to the middle or end of the total cooking time.

I couldn't find my slow cooker so I made this over the stove. I cooked on medium until the cream cheese was part of the sauce. Then I cooked on medium-high and added the ravioli when it started boiling. Cooked uncovered for 5 minutes (read the instructions on your ravioli for the appropriate cooking time!) By the time the dish was done, most of the water had evaporated and I was left with a nice thick sauce. Bf loved it! Sauce was delicious and reminded me of cream-of-mushroom soup :)

Thanks to everyone's comments on this recipe I couldn't wait to make it and I totally loved it!  Also, it was super cheap to make.  I'm not a big fan of vege broth so instead I substituted a can of tomato soup.  Yum, yum, yummy!

It was way to liquidity. I followed directions completely. Next time I will not use as much vegetable broth. The taste was great although I'm sure in its full creamy state it would be really tasty.

When I opened my slow cooker the dish looked disgusting and it didn't taste too great either. The spinach sat on top, the cream cheese clumped, and the totrellini got mushy.

Very easy meal to make. However, if you're using refrigerated tortellini, 1.5 hours on low is plenty. Be sure to give everything a stir a couple of times when cooking. Next time I'd add the spinach at the end so that it will wilt, yet retain its color.

The only thing I changed was using frozen spinach instead of fresh. Loved it! Next time I will add more mushrooms because they tasted so good.

This was so easy to make. I did need to thicken it a bit and I threw some garlic and black pepper in it. My 24 year old vegetarian college student gave me the thumbs up!!! I'm learning!!!

I put this in the slow cooker before work so it was cooking for around 8hrs, thus I used frozen tortellini and frozen spinach instead of what recipe called for.  I love how creamy it was, but the tortellini did turn out a bit mushy.  I suspect if made as directed it would be just right.  I'm looking forward to trying some variations, such as adding seasonings and maybe different veggies.  Good recipe.

This dish was wonderful! So creamy and delicious and the best part is that it was super easy! I added a little bit of turkey burger to mine and it was great with it. A must try

I was a little nervous based on the negative review. And while it was cooking I thought for sure that it was too much broth. BUT it thickened nicely and was really good. Both my toddler and my husband really liked it. I was on the hunt for a quick and easy recipe b/c I was feeling under the weather. It certainly fit the bill because it was easy, cheap and healthy. I'll definitely make this again. The only thing I would change is the cooking time if you're using fresh tortellini- after 4 hours it became a bit mushy.

Was trying to find a meatless meal to make.  Made this according to directions,and it was not a hit.  Maybe meat and tomatoes would make it better, but that would defeat the vegetarian idea.

I halved the recipe, except for full cup of mushrooms. I used bone broth and fresh chard from my garden, added 2 cloves of garlic. I also used mushroom tortellini from the refrigerated dept. and cooked it in my Instant Pot for 20 min at high pressure. Delicious!

So, following this recipe, what you will end up with is a paste that may be used as a gorilla glue substitute. Make sure you double the Vegetable broth is you want a soup.

This was so easy and delish!  Definitely something you can throw in the crockpot and leave alone for hours and it will come out perfect.

Super easy recipe and delicious! I didn't add all of the specified amount of veggie broth (I didn't want it to be soupy and I didn't have the full amount on hand) and I think next time I'll use cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream cheese.  I did add sliced black olives and a little bit of sweet potato just because I like them. I might also add some garlic for a more robust flavor. All in all, I'm glad I tried this recipe!

I only give this recipe 2 stars because it was very easy and vegetarian. Its flavor was lacking and my SO and I found it difficult to eat because it was so bland.

This is really good and easy to make. I'm going to shorten the cook time. The tortellini got a little too soft for my taste.

Did not care for this.  Mine turned out watery (not creamy) and had very little flavor.  I followed recipe exactly.

I did not like this at all. It comes out a mushy, unappealing, brown dish that doesn’t have much flavor. I’m not even going to try to mess with it. I’m just not going to make this one again.

I really wanted this to be good, but we ended up throwing it out without even trying it because it was like soup, even though I followed the recipe exactly. I have never given any recipe on this site just one star, but I want to be honest and let people know that it didn't work. Sorry.

I did not enjoy this very much. It was much too watery even though I didn't use all the broth that was required in recipe. It needs to be thickened and seasoned.

This dish was excellent! I cooked it according to directions, with a couple of exceptions:
I used fresh tortellini instead of frozen, and I added some garlic powder. 
 I *might* have added a bit more than a cup of mushrooms, as I love them...and I didn't bother measuring the amount. 
Cooked it for 4 hours on low and added the spinach during the final half hour. It was super easy to prepare, the tortellini didn't get mushy at all (as another reviewer found had happened) and the flavour was extremely good.

We didn’t add mushrooms and used frozen spinach.  I also added cooked crumbled sausage, and it was a hit!  My kids were begging for more. I’ll have to triple it next time!

Not sure if my changes qualify as a new recipe but: I made half this recipe, starting with a 9-ounce package of fresh refrigerated (not frozen) tortellini. Added spinach and mushrooms at the beginning. Major change was not making the sauce given here but using a 14-oz jar of garlic Alfredo sauce with a bit of water to rinse out the jar. I have a pretty fast slow-cooker so it was done in about 2 hours on low. Sprinkled some Parmesan on when serving. Terrific! Will definitely make again. Serves 2-3.

I made this and it was disgusting. It doesn't take 5-6 hrs in the slow cooker. It was done in like 3 hrs. I would have used less spinach if I ever made it again. It had no flavor and sauce was so thick and blah..

Did not care much for the flavor. Needed salt and pepper for sure.

Doesn't taste as good as leftovers and noodle were a little too mushy, but the adult kids loved it!

Super easy!! Thanks to this and "Wild Rice Cassarole 1" on this site, I deceived my hubs into discovering he likes mushrooms! Made the recipe as is except used 1.5 cans spinach and cooked on high 3 hours. Came out wonderful- needed salt to my taste but hubs just added pepper. Thanks for the great recipe. Its a keeper!

The tortellini all clumped together into a big, mushy, indigestible mess.  We were unable to eat it.
