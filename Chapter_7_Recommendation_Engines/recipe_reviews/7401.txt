My parents have a hallmark fruitcake made in Texas, the memory of which I was working against in making this recipe at my father's request.  Given that there are only three of us sharing Christmas, I halved the recipe and took some liberties because of what we had in the kitchen, as well as trying to match the Empress Fruitcake of Yore.  I added dried apricots and some withered blueberries, because of what we had on hand, and omitted the sultanas and currents, going heavier on dates.  I also substituted pecans for almonds.  My father also wanted the taste of burbon so I soaked the raisins in burbon for a few days, drained them well and used the burbon-raisin juice instead of coffee and grape juice.

I suggest that you read the recipe carefully for the myriad of steps -- beaten egg whites, beaten egg yolks and the flour mixtures all in separate bowls that converge quite quickly.  It makes for a BIG project and heavy clean up.

The recipe also calls for three differently sized "Christmas cake" pans, the like of which I've never seen and do not see the reason for -- it's not a stacked cake, after all.  I used loaf pans and baked the minimum 2 1/2 hours.  I used two layers of greased brown paper but only on the bottom of the pans; after running a sharp knife around the greased edges, the cakes dropped out easily.

The next time I make this (and I think I will -- it did, essentially, match that acme of fruitcakes from my childhood) -- I won't chop the fruit and nuts as small as I

This fruitcake is delicious but costs a fortune to make - definitely a once a year item!

I soaked dried cranberries in rum (instead of currants) and used half white sugar and half brown sugar - other than that followed recipe.

I made a couple of cupcake size ones to taste and the big one is wrapped and in the freezer for the holidays.

The cupcakes tasted superb.......

I 1/3 the recipe and baked the cake for 2 and a half hours.The cake is moist and has a nice flavour. I didn't like dates so i replaced them with cashewnuts instead. I didn't change anything else. Good recipe.

This is a good fruitcake, but it's nothing like I expected.  My grandmother made a DARK fruitcake.  This one is not very dark at all.  I searched my dad's house for her recipe and found a really old cookbook that had a similar recipe to this one.  The difference is it calls for 4oz. of dark unsweetened chocolate squares.  When I told my dad he remembered her putting bakers chocolate in her cake.  Her cake never lasted until new years.  The book also used Mace in the spices.

I always use this recipe because the proportions work well for a lot of cakes.  I modify it a little bit, using as much fruit and nuts as will fill a kitchen-aid mixer bowl, and I like to add chocolate chips.  And I sometimes use coffee and orange juice or just orange juice, instead of grape juice and coffee.  I usually pour it out into 10 mini loaf pans, and usually have enough batter left over for one large loaf pan as well.  And I soak them in some combination of whiskey, rum, citrus brandy, and Frangelico.

This is just like my Mom's,  sometimes she would change the fruit.  Mom would say just add the dried fruit you like.  It was always delicious.  My family likes to serve it with cheese.

This cake is a lot of work but it is worth it. I cooked it using several loaf pans. It took under 2 hours to bake. I followed the rceipe except I did soak the raisins in 1 1/2 cups of dark rum overnight. Then later I added a 1/2cup rum instead of coffee. My husband said this receipe was better than his mother's!  Will definitely make it again.
