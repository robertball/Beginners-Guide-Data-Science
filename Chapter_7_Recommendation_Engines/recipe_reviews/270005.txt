jsandeen.... Why would you rate something you haven't even tried? I'm aware that I too am doing so, hoping that this 5 star will offset your 3 star. The amount of fat rendered from one pound of bacon can very greatly depending on the bacon you buy. I've been cooking with bacon fat for 40 years so I have some experience to back up that statement. If it looks like too much fat pour some off but keep it in reserve, just in case.

We enjoyed this. I made 2 small changes. I used sliced turkey instead of bacon, and I added mushrooms. I never would have thought of cooking eggs in with hash browns. It was good.

I haven't made this yet, but can't imagine leaving all the grease from a pound of bacon in it!  Surely that's not right?
