I made some changes to this receipe, because of the reviews I didn't want it to be blah. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic salt and italian seasoning. I added alot more macaroni. 1 chopped onion sauted in olive oil, 1 eight ounce can of mushrooms sauted in butter.I put 1/4 cup manonnaise and 1/4 cup sour cream. I Topped casserole with crispy fried onions and popped in the oven, Once cooked I topped with a mixture of cheeces (montery jack and sharp cheedar) turned out very well  easy dish.

This was a good recipe.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and added cheddar cheese on top.  It was really good.  I think the sour cream made the difference.  I also added some salt and pepper.  I used bow tie pasta because that is what I had on hand and it worked great.  I think you could also use the canned chicken chunks which would cut down on the cooking time of the chicken breast.
I will definitely cook this again.

I made changes after reading the other reviews.  Added broccoli, used cream of broccoli soup and added a little cheese.  Whole family loved it!  I also used sour cream with a little mayo--it was yummy!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Being a single girl, new to the whole cooking scene, I was looking for something easy that would work with the limited ingredients I currently have on hand. This recipe was so easy! Even I was able to figure out a couple of additions (a handful of frozen peas, a half a green onion, a pinch of garlic powder, some shredded cheese on top). While I was defrosting the chicken breasts in the microwave, I cooked the pasta, and as I was waiting for the oven to preheat (because I forgot about that part), I chopped the onion and grated the cheese. Thanks again for the ideas.

Good base recipe. I was a little scared of the mayo, but because I didn't have any sour cream in the house I used the mayo and the cream of chicken soup. I cooked my chicken in olive oil and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper.  After I cooked the chicken, I cooked a few strips of bacon and some onions and added that to the mixture. I also added a 3 cheese blend of romano, parm and asiago. Mixed in a liitle milk, some more salt, pepper and garlic and it was absolutely great. My 2 and 4 year olds gobbled it up! Not the most healthy way to go, but a great hearty meal!

Excellent quick and easy recipe.  Great for days when you need to just throw something together.  I used canned chicken to cut down on prep time.  Worked great!

I doubled the recipe (except the mayo...still only used 1/2c miracle whip for zip).  I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  Also, added a jar of diced pimentos, 3 stalks of celery/chopped and 1/2c fresh sliced mushrooms. 5 minutes before it was done, I sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese overall to melt.  VERY GOOD! We really enjoyed this.  The addition of some veggies gives it added taste and tecture enhancement.  This makes for a great dinner on those busy nights! Way to go Gloria!!

This was SO GOOD and EASY!!!  I doubled the recipe and used a smaller deeper dish to bake it in.  I also added a small amount of milk, broccoli, and topped it with cheddar cheese.  When I cooked the chicken I used olive oil, garlic poweder, and season salt.  This turned out great and I was a skeptic at first.  My husband loved it and had 3 servings!!!

I made this with some modifications. I used Cream of Celery soup, some mayo and some sour cream. Did use elbow macaroni and added some cooked broccoli. Before I put in the oven, I sprinkled some crushed up croutons over the top. All in all, very good dish and I would make it again.

I used cream of mushroom soup instead, added broccoli and plenty of garlic and basil, and this recipe was an instant hit with my husband and myself. We will definitely be adding this to the weekly rotation.

This was great!!! I cooked this for a ladies luncheon.  I added steamed broccoli, celery and green onions and cheddar.  I topped it with garlic buttered bread crumbs and more cheddar.  They loved it!!!!  This is a great basic recipe and can be changed to suit your family's tastes.

My picky eaters loved this. I made a few changes. I doubled the recipe and used canned chicken (not my first choice but it is what I had on hand), 1/4 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, added sharp cheddar to the top and seasoned with onion powder, nature's seasoning, and old bay. I served it with green beans and EVERYONE ate!!!! That almost never happens.

Our big family of 9 loves this meal. We use a big box of macaroni and have enough for 2 full dinners! Also I like to add a little Cayenne and chili powder to give a little zip. Also I add some sort of veggie so that it is a whole meal for the family.

Pretty basic and easy to dash up to your own liking. While I cooked my chicken I added seasoned salt and pepper on it. I also used rice instead of macaroni, since I didnt have any macaroni. Next I added canned veggies of my liking and one chicken boullin cube that I melted in 1/2 cup of water to add some more flavor to the mix. Topped it with some crushed crackers and mozzarella cheese

only gave it 4 stars cause I tweaked it.  Used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of broccoli and 1 can cream of mushroom.  Seasoned chicken breast with salt free chicken grill mate seasoning, pepper and freeze dried basil - eyed it - used quite a bit of each - sauted chicken in butter and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic w/ juice from the jar.  used 1 bag shredded reduced fat mild cheddar - mixed 3/4 in with casserole, put 1/4 on top.  Used whole bag of frozen broccoli, cooked.  Husband and I were pleasantly surprised - casserole's with this much cream of XX soups usually are to heavy and sit funny in our tummies - this, though, tasted great and was very satisfying.  Will definitely be our go to casserole when we need something for leftovers!

This is a good recipe if you want to stretch a dollar.  I only had 2 large chicken breasts and had to make a dinner for 4.  There was plenty casserole, plus enough for my husband to take lunch tomorrow.  I made the following changes:  First, I cut the raw chicken into chunks, seasoned with poultry seasoning and garlic salt, then sauteed in butter and olive oil.  I used 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 cup mayo mixture.  Added about a cup of shredded swiss cheese, and two cups of cooked broccoli.  And I increased the amount of noodles (I cooked 1 1/2 cup raw).  I would definitely recommend adding more noodles, it was my kids favorite part and we could have used more.  Finally, I topped with crushed ritz crackers.  Not bad...

I REALLY altered this recipe, it was a good base to start from. I added double the noodles, and a can of cheese and broccoli condensed soup. I also added some broccoli and corn. Then topped with cheese and bread crumbs. Husband LOVED it and so did I.

This was a hit with my family.  I wish I would of read some of the other reviews.  I did put some cheese on the top for the last 10 minutes.  I sprinkled some Lawry's garlic salt with parsley on it and it was great.  Next time I will use it on the chicken when I cook it and add some canned mushrooms to it too.  I also used the 3 minute macaroni and that sped up the prep time too.

Delicious!! I used a leftover rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, mixed in 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and sprinkled the top with plain bread crumbs. I don't know why someone said this had no flavor- it was great, esp. for such an easy dinner!  Note: I tried this recipe again, but used cream of broccoli soup and chunks of steamed broccoli along with cheese- it was delicious!

It was pretty bland, but as it states, very easy- and easy to alter by adding vegetables, sour cream and cheese. I also topped with a mixture Italian breadcrumbs and grated cheddar.

This is a versatile, simple recipe that our family has been using since we found it online a few years ago. We usually add to it whatever we have on hand - onions, shredded cheese, bread crumbs on top, etc.

I make this quite a bit for my boys as a quick dinner. Only thing I do different is add shredded swiss cheese and a little milk. Sometimes, I'll use drained, canned tuna in place of the chicken. It never fails to disappear off the table at dinner time.

I made this tonight and my family really enjoyed it - literally EVERYONE had seconds (or thirds) and that rarely happens - so a recipe ranks high with those odds! I did add/change a bit. First off, I added almost a soup can of milk to make it more creamy then I threw in some cheese - american and swiss and added some seasonings - few dashes of garlic salt, paprika, and some pepper. It was  really quite good! Nice recipe so quick and simple and very tasty at that!!!

I loved this recipe! Very easy.My husband loved it and my picky 7 year old loved it. My 4 year old had two helpings. I used 2 cups of elbows and sour cream instead of mayo. I also used cream of mushroom soup and added broccoli. And I topped it off with Pecorino Romano sprinkled on top. Will make this again and again.

I loved this recipe because I already had all of the ingredients in my pantry.  I took the other reviewers advice and modified the recipe.  I used cream of broccoli soup instead of creme of chicken.  I used twice the amount of pasta, added garlic powder, minced onion, salt, pepper, sour cream instead of mayo, and a sprinkle of Italian blend cheese.  I topped it off with some more cheese and french fried onions on top.

I shred the chicken instead of cubing it. I added more noodles and more cream of chicken soup and garlic powder. A good amount of black pepper, too. It ended up being fairly quick to make and pretty good eats! Not fancy by any means, but creamy and yummy.

Very good and easy to make. I used cream of mushroom instead and added cheddar cheese and crumbled cheeze-it crackers on the top. It's the same recipe for a broccoli casserole I make and love. Will make again!!! Thank you.

This is a great base recipe. I added whole wheat penne instead of macaroni, sour cream along with mayo, canned mixed veggies and topped it with marble shredded cheese. Delicious! Also, I heavily seasoned my chicken while I cooked it and I feel that made a huge difference. I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it and said he would have it again. Next time I make this I want to add water chestnuts and maybe some crushed Ritz crackers n the top. Oh, and its super easy to make. The hardest part is cooking the chickecn and thats not reallyhard, just time consuming. This would be perfect for a pot luck.

With a few adjustments this recipe was great! First I cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic, I switched the mayo for sour cream, added broccoli and cream of broccoli soup and towards the end added some cheese to the top. Everyone loved it and went back for more! Definitely something I will make again, very easy for those busy days.

This was a great base recipe. I used Canola oil and added Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder, minced onion, sage, and parsley to the cubed chicken. That sure got rid of the bland taste.  I boiled fresh brocoli with the pasta.  I used mini shells instead of elbow.  I combined a can of cream of chicken and cream of brocoli soup with Miracle whip.  After I combined the chicken with the soups I cubed up velvetta and added it to the mixture.  Spreaded it into a 9x13 pan and cooked it at 375 degrees.  It melted the cheese very nicely and gave it a thicker texture.  There was no leftovers!!!!!  Will make again for sure.  Thanks.

This was good!  I used the sour cream instead of the mayo and sprinkled shredded cheese over the whole dish before baking, thanks to previous reviews.  My 5 year old ate his whole serving!  I have enough left to take to work tommorrow too!

We found this to be rather bland, even after trying to jazz it up.  I cooked the chicken with a diced onion in garlic powder and Italian seasoning, added chopped broccoli to the mixture and sprinkled shredded mozzarella over top.  It was OK but probably not worth a repeat.  Thanks anyway!

The first time I made this recipe, it was good, but bland.  The second time I decided to spice it up with some vegetables, and ruined it! Stick with the recipe for something simple and good.

This was pretty tasty! I used miracle whip because thats what I had, and I topped with a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese. Also I did add about a tablespoon of milk because after I mixed the ingredients together it looked a bit dry. Also I think next time I may add some frozen peas in the mix.

I used a bit more pasta, light sour cream, and added some milk.  I also mixed in some broccoli and seasoned salt, pepper, garlic, minced onion, and sprinkled parm. and a mex. chz. blend on top.  It was a tasty, quick recipe.  I don't think it would have enough flavor without the sour cream and spices.  Thanks for the idea.  It was just what I needed since my fridge is pretty bare!

Another great basic recipe!!  Here are the changes/additions I made.
1) Substituted cream of mushroom for chicken since I didn't have any chicken.
2) Add garlic and vegetables to make a complete meal.
3) Substituted sour cream for mayo like some of the others.
4) Added salt and pepper.
5) Because I had to make the chicken to prepare this dish, I only browned the chicken instead of fully cooking it.  The 40 minute cooking time was enough to fully cook the chicken.
I like this dish because its basic and  can be changed to suit a variety of tastes, so that's why I gave it a five!!

We liked this recipe.  It's a lot like a hot chicken salad but with pasta instead of rice.  It was really easy to make since I had some leftover roasted chicken.  Next time I would add broccoli or peas just to round it out a little more.

THIS WAS GREAT. THE KIDS ALL HAD SECONDS. I DID CHANGE IT A BIT THOUGH. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND I ADDED 2 CANS OF CHEDDAR CHEESE SOUP, SOME GREEN ONIONS, GARLIC POWDER, SALT AND PEPPER AND INSTEAD OF MAYO PUT IN SOUR CREAM LIKE A PREVIOUS VIEWER DID.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. Even my fussy two year old ate it up! We all thought it tasted wonderful!!  The prep time took me a little longer because I had to cook the chicken. I used a cream of chicken dijon soup.  Gave it a great flavor with the mayo. We will be making this again.

My kids Loved it!! I did tweak it a bit, I added a jar of alfredo sauce along with a handful of fresh grated parmesan cheese to amp it up, my kids eat a lot and there are 5 people in my family. I tossed sliced fresh broccoli n baby carrots to the pasta right before the pasta was done. It was getting late so I used packaged cooked chicken strips. Super good n Fast!! So sorry Gloria that its taken SO LONG to give this yummy dinner a face:) Keeper!! MMMMMMMM

My hubby and myself loved this casserole.  I tweaked a bit by using noodles and more than a cupful.  Also added 1/2 can Campbells Chicken broth to the soup & mayo mix. Added frozen sweet peas also and for chicken I shredded some leftover rotisserie chicken to the mix.  For topping I crushed about 15 ritz crackers  in a ziploc bag & added 1/4 cup grated Parmesan. I sprinkled it on top of casserole and baked it. It was delicious. Used leftovers as frozen  TV dinners. Thanx for sharing

I was concerned when I heard taste was blah. That would be okay for our kids, but not us. Used what was on hand.... sauted chopped onion and plum tomatoes in oil, added chicken pieces and red wine. Let it cook down and then added cream of mushroom soup.  Added this mixture to cooked macaroni and mixed in baking dish. Topped with bread crumbs and baked.  Lekker!! (

I agree, a bit bland, but great for a quick and easy meal. This is a lot like tuna casserole.

Delicious! i made a lot of modifications to this recipe. it was a great base recipe. Per to many recommendations, i used 1/4c mayo and 1/4c sour cream. i added a chopped red bell pepper, several green onions, and a bowl of fresh mushrooms. i sauteed the mushrooms in butter and cooked the red bell pepper in the drippings from the chicken. i added a bit of milk into the mixture to make it a bit more creamy. i poured it all in a 9x13 dish and it fit just perfectly. i topped it with cheddar cheese and french fried onions. It was delicious ;)
edit: i forgot to add that i also used mini shells pasta in this dish. worked great! any type of small pasta would work. :)

Quick and easy if you have the chicken and noddles cooked already.  My Kids loved it, My husband and I thought it was good.  I added a bit of cajun seasoning on top and some mozzarella and used a bit more noodles.

Good recipie...added onions and green peppers to one half of it.  The top didn't turn out like I thought it would...I thought the eggs would be fluffier, instead it was more brownish.  Need to cook less, though, as mine turned out a bit hard on the bottom.  But I will DEFINITELY serve this for some Sunday breakfast, and my husband, who doesn't eat breakfast, said he'd definitely eat it!  Thanks for sharing!

My whole family loved it!  It was simple to prepare.  My eight year old daughter is very picky but she asked for seconds.  Great for a busy mother who wants to feed her family well without a lot of fuss.  Just add a salad, bread and dessert and you have a wonderful meal.  Thanks!

I had some chicken breast w/ peppers and onion frozen. I cooked the 1/2 box of elbow noodles . Meanwhile in a frying pan w 1 tbs butter,cooked the frozen chicken ,peppers,and onion on low heat with I stalk broccoli crowns in smaller pieces covered. Cubed up chicken breast ,back into pan. Drained noodles and added into same frying pan. Added the sour cream and 2 cans cream chicken soup ,and about 1/2 cup milk to thin out sauce a little . Stir and simmer on low till all ingredients blend together. Simmer on low. Since all ingredients are cooked already you are done. Add some shredded cheese on top and let melt on top if desired.

This is a great base recipe for beginners, and easily allows for substitutions and additions.   I made it with a group of 9 & 10 year old girls for our church "Activity Days" (they each made their own to take home and serve their family)  They had a great time and their mommies were happy not to have to make dinner that night.
It needs a little more seasonings and I doubled it to serve a family, plus at least double the macaroni in the original.

My family really liked this recipe! I was actually surprised by how much I liked it. I chose it because it was simple and these days I need simple. I made very few changes. First, I doubled the recipe. Next, due to cost, I used chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper while it was cooking. I used 98% fat free soup and lite mayo. Baked it for 40 minutes, then topped with reduced fat cheese. It was very yummy, and resulted in no leftovers.

Five stars for a great starting point for chicken noodle casserole. I added 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. One jar 12 oz. turkey gravy. I used 18oz. Of egg noodles and increased the mayo to 1 cup, using 4 large boneless chicken breasts. I also mixed in one can of peas. Yes, for all those who are saying I changed the recipe entirely.. Yes I did. You see, I didn't have a starting point when I ran across this one and I had to make a meal out of the chicken breast I had out thawing already and had no clue what to do with it. So this recipe ( the posters) gave me just the start I needed so hands down a 5 star rating! Thank you!

Very easy to make. Only adjustment I made was to add pepper to casserole. Based on reveiws I was afraid it might be too bland, but didnt want to let that stop me. My suggestion, USE SEASONING.

The mayo overpowered this recipe.  I wasn't a fan, even with the modifications.  My dh who is of the "I'll eat anything as long as it doesn't eat me first" school of thought, didn't care for it, either.  It's getting a 3 star because it was easy, not good.

I have made this recipe several times and love it the way it is.  I have never used the 9 x 13 pan as I saw the first time I made it that it was too thin to cook that way.  (I use an 8 x 8).  I also never have regular mayo so I use the Miracle Whip variety.  My husband found it bland so I looked through the reviews and will use some of the suggestions I found there to spice it up a bit.

Not horrible ~ but not great.  It was pretty dry ~ I'll try again substituting sour cream for mayo as others suggested, and maybe using a smaller pan.  The noodles and chicken pieces that were at the top got pretty hard and dry with it spread out in a 9x13 pan.

This was a great tasting and easy dinner to make!  I used miracle whip instead of mayo and seasoned my chicken while cooking it in olive oil. The only problem I had was that it doesn't make enough!

My husband had 4 helpings, and that never happens. He told me I have to make this again. I also really enjoyed this. I did not change one thing. My husband said it was simple. I will have to say the prep time is way off. You can not cook chicken and boil noodles in 5 minites.
