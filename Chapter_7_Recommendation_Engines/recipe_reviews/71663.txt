These were NOT my thing.  The pairing of tomato with the texture of baked beans did not appeal to anyone.  I should have known that when I read the ingredients, but it received such a high rating, I made it anyway.  If you REALLY liked baked beans, this will probably be a hit at your house.  Not the case in mine.

I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe and found it easy to make. I did make a couple of changes: 1) Added sun-dried tomatoes that were packed in oil instead of tomatoes not packed in oil.  2) I broiled it (with rack on a mid-level shelf) instead of grilling (I don't have a grill)
