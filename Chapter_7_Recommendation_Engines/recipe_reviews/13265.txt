I personally had the urge to add more onion and I just had to add garlic. I couldn't see adding the corn as I'm not very much of a corn lover. It's a great recipe.

MMM! This was very good and unique! I made the following changes: canned corn, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, petite salad shrimp, and omitted bay leaf and chile pepper.  I did add red pepper for the spice! This was very good! Thanks!

Disappointing. The vegetables were still cruncy - try cooking for 20 minutes before adding the shrimp. The flavors were a little uninteresting - probably could have used some garlic. I used canned corn, a large can of diced tomatoes, and more okra than the recipe called for, plus some red pepper flakes for some more heat.

Okra, shrimp and corn - what could be better!  This definitely has to have garlic in it, at least at my house.  I used stewed tomatoes with chilis instead of fresh and threw in a little white wine because I liked the idea.  The only thing wrong with the instructions was the part about "chill before serving".  It tasted too good to wait that long!

We love this recipe!  I change a few things though.  We add summer sausage and chicken instead of shrimp.  I also dice up a jalapeno or two and toss in the mix.  I use onions instead of shallots and add an extra red bell pepper.  After cooking it all up we serve it over rice...very tasty!

Very tastey.  I added red pepper flakes for some real heat, and some leftover chicken breast.

Excellent!  I used canned tomatoes and that saved a lot of time.  Garlic is a must.  Enjoy!

This is a phenomenal base to make your own - but I wouldn't have liked it nearly as much if I'd just followed directions. I sauteed the onion and pepper in the soup pot with olive oil for about 10 - 15 minutes to get them lightly browned and tender, then dumped in 5 diced roma tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups okra, and a cup mixed veggies (in place of corn, since that's what I had open). I also added a healthy dash of tomato sauce (probably about 1/3 cup). I added the thyme and covered with a lid and let it simmer on low for about 15 minutes before seasoning with salt and pepper, a little more lime juice, a couple dashes of hot sauce, and about a TBS canned diced mild chiles in place of the called for green chile. Served over rice. I wouldn't call it stew - it was pretty thick without much excess liquid but so delicious. We were fighting over leftovers.

Awesome stuff, I changed it to mine but the main part is great.
