I made this for New Years Eve last night.  I got away with using only 5 Tbsp. of butter when browning the bread with the garlic.  I grated the Monterey Jack because I felt it would melt easier when baking.  I used just one can of artichokes which I thought was plenty.  Make sure you cut up the artichokes before adding them into the cheese mixture.  I mixed the cheddar cheese and green onions directly into the mixture instead of sprinkling on top and added a bit of seasoning salt.  I mixed the bread in last and then stored the bread mixture in a bowl in my fridge.  When I was ready to bake it later that night I let  the cheese/bread mixture sit out to soften a bit before I spread it into the hollowed out bread.  Definitely cook it at 350 for about 30 minutes for a great result.  After cooling for a couple of minutes, I sliced it into chunks for appetizers.  It's very rich but very tasty.  Just one note about a previous reviewer saying something about this being "bad artichoke dip".  I've made artichoke dip tons of times and this obviously intended to be a different type of recipe.

I wanted to make this recipe for a dinner party but was alittle concerned by the directions (or lack of some key info).  I made a few cooking adjustments and it really turned out great.  Everyone enjoyed it!  Here is what I did:
1.  Be sure to use a long "larger diameter" loaf of bread, like the artisan kind.  I don't think this will work without a hefy loaf of bread.
2. You only need to use about 2/3 of the required "stuffing ingredients" (i.e. Monterey Jack cheese on down).  That will be plenty to fill your loaf.  I made the full recipe and had lots left over that I couldn't use for this.
3. As others mentioned "broiling for 10 min." would never work.  I baked (without adding the cheddar cheese and green onions) for 20 - 25 min. in a 350% oven.  I then added the cheddar cheese and green onions and broiled for 5 min. until bubbly.
4.  To serve:  I sliced each loaf half down the long way and then came back and sliced each quarter length into 1 1/2 inches easy to eat portions.
Everyone loved it!

Excellant.  Always a big hit.  My suggestion would be to cook it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  jfg

This was absolutely fantastic!  Added just a bit of chopped pepperoni for an extra bite and followed the other suggestion of cooking it at 350 for 30 minutes (those big cubes of monterrey jack take a bit to melt).  My family absolutely Loved it.  Will definitely be making it for the next party I attend.

I've been making this loaf for 10 years, but had lost the actual recipe - I was ecstatic to find it here so I can pass it on to friends.  It's ALWAYS a hit, even for people who swear they don't like artichokes!!

I used french bread because I don't enjoy the taste of sourdough, and forgot to top with my green onions (oops). But regardless of these changes, this was fantastic. It flew everyone loved it, and I got tons of compliments, I almost felt guilty because of how easy it was to make :).

I believe there is way too much filling for a one pound loaf of bread.  I cut the bread in half and hollowed out and stuffed both sides (even though the recipe does not indicated to do so) and I still had way too much filling.  This results in a finished product that looks great, but once you try slicing it, as the recipe states, it is nearly impossible to get nice, even serving pieces.  While I like all the ingredients listed, I thought the end flavor was a bit too rich, even in very small doses.  If I were to make this again I would definitely cut the filling ingredients in half.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Rebecca Swift!

We made this as appetizers and bread for the meal. We sliced the bread and spread the mix on it before broiling. Nobody could get enough of it it was soooooooo good!

My guests all love this did, but I did have to make some changes to the cooking times, as the dip was not warmed through cooking as directed.  Next time I will cook for 15-20 minutes at 350 to be sure the dip is warmed through, and then broil for 5, as that made the dip present beautifully.  Also, maybe I cut the bread too small, but the pieces really got lost in the dip and we ended up eating it on crackers.  Next time I will omit adding the bread back into the recipe.  This will definitely be a "staple" recipe for gatherings.

This was fantastic!  By the way, this in NOT an artichoke dip, as one negative reviewer mistakenly states.  This is a yummy, cheesy loaf of tasty goodness.

This was bad.  I have never made an artichoke dip before and this dip does not sell me on artichokes.
