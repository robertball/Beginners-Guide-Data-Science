This was really good, I used left over bbq sauce that I made for another recipe, and mixed it in with the hamburger, I think the crust needed something though. Next time I will add cheese or maybe some green chilies to the crust to make it better. Thanks for the great recipe! I will be using this recipe again next time I have left over bbq sauce.

Very Tasty, but next time I will use a sweeter BBQ sauce. Also, be sure to bake for 35 minutes not 25.

I agree with the other reviewers . . . WAY too much topping.  I would make it again but would increase the filling by 1.5.

This recipe turned out fantastic for our family.  I did make several changes, however, after reading the prior reviews.  I skipped the cheese and dumped the beef and onion mix into an 8x8 pan.  Initially, I tried the 9x13 dish but the mix didn't quite cover the bottom enough for my personal liking.  I added a cup of frozen crinkle coin carrots and a cup of frozen corn to the baking pan and tossed everything in our favorite hickory bbq sauce.  Since others seemed to have issues with both the volume and the taste of the batter, I cut the batter portion in half and added 1tsp onion powder, 1tsp garlic powder, and ground a little rosemary over it.  I wanted the topping to taste like biscuits rather than pancakes, and I thought this would be more suited to what I was aiming for.   We baked for the 35 minutes others suggested, and we were very pleased with the results.  I will definitely be making this again, and I really appreciate a recipe using ground beef and Bisquick in such a non-traditional way.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This was surprisingly good, for a simple, comfort food-y dish. I made it exactly as written, using 85% lean ground beef and mild cheddar cheese. The recipe didn't say whether to drain the fat from the browned beef-and-onion mixture, but I opted to do so. The "6 servings" were pretty decently-sized portions, and I enjoyed them over 4 or 5 days. I do slightly agree with the reviewers who complained about there being too much topping and not enough of the rest. The topping was quite tasty, though - just perhaps a bit too much. I just might make this again soon - it's easy, economical and quite filling.

A quick easy and inexpensive meal to make. My family thought it was really good. Don't change anything. It's great the way it is. As a tip, use two boxes of Jiffy Corn Bread Mix. Even simpler and tastier.

Nothing to it and it tastes like it. You end up with a little bit of beef and a whole lot of dough.

I found this to be very bland and had to much biscuit. I will try again with more flavor and a reduction to the biscuit.

Easy and tasty!  Used a honey-based bbq sauce.  I'll try adding some more veggies next time (corn, beans, green peppers...)

I tried this recipe last week using Hunt's Manwich, ground buffalo meat, and took the advice of other reviewers.  I decreased the topping (I used Bisquick) and added garlic and onion powder to the topping.  It was very tasty and my husband really liked it.  I will defintely make this again.  Oh, before I forget, I did not add cheese as I thought it would be too much with the Manwich sauce.

With modifications, this can be very good. Other reviewers complained of it being too bready so I cut the biscuit mix to 3/4 cup of biscuit mix & 1/4 cup of cornmeal. I also cooked up a 1/2 pound of bacon & added it. I cooked this in a 9" square pan & the filling still seemed insufficient. Next time I'll cut the biscuit mix AND double the filling. But as much as a cheese lover as I am, I think 2 cups of shredded cheese is enough. I also added 1t of McCormick's BBQ seasoning, which I highly recommend. I use it in all my BBQ casseroles.
