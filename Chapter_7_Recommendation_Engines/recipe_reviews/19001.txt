I had my doubts that this recipe was going to make a decent ice cream.  The taste and texture were great!  It was a bit on the sweet side so next time I will either leave out the sugar or at least cut it in half.  My biggest problem with this recipe was the fact that I could not get it to freeze in my ice cream maker.  I finally gave up and put the whole thing in the freezer and after about five hours, it was finally done.  It may just be my ice cream maker, but since I was able to get it frozen by just using my home freezer, this would be great for someone that does not actually have an ice cream maker.  The first time I made it, I was not able to add the full two cups of milk.  This resulted in a great taste, but the texture was like marshmallow fluff.  The second time I was able to fix that problem I added the full two cups of milk and stired it into the whipped topping/condensed milk mixture before I poured it into the freezer.  I made a peanut butter cup version for my husband by using ony 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and a 10 pack of the individually wrapped Reses Peanut Butter Cups cut into small pieces. He said it was better than the stuff you get at the store or ice cream parlour.

I really like this recipe because you can make it totally fat free without it tasting fat free; just use fat free whipped cream, fat free condensed milk and skim milk, then throw in frozen fruit instead of candy.  I also leave out the cup of sugar because I think it's sweet enough without it.  Even my husband likes it!

This is one of the best ice cream recipes out there!  I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and substituted half the sugar for peanut butter and it was fantastic!! Also, Fat-Free Sweetened Condensed Milk works fine and you can even use Fat-Free Half & Half in a pinch...although the consistancy ends up being a little more icy...but delicious all the same!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated. The ice cream wouldn't freeze in my Kitchen-Aid Ice Cream Maker which was okay. I just mixed it well and then put it into the freezer. I like that the ice cream stays soft instead of hardening. I think the name of this ice cream should be changed to Sweet Cream because this is very sweet. It tastes like cold marshmallow fluff. I would recommend reducing the white sugar in the recipe. I stirred peanut butter and chopped Reeses's and chocolate syrup into my bowl of ice cream and that helped to mask the high sweetness. If you are going to make this, reduce the sugar and then add peanut butter and Reese's for sure.

This was excellent! We ate it straight from the ice cream maker and my husband said it was like a Blizzard. The next day, after freezing a while longer, it was a creamy frozen consistency, more like traditional hard ice cream. Both days it was wonderful!

I like the basic ingredients for this recipe, and I modified it to make peanut butter ice cream.  Use the whipped topping, sweetened condensed milk, and regular milk, and add 3/4 cup of peanut butter.  That's it!  It keeps its' creamy texture even when frozen hard.  Try it!

YUM!  Very tasty.  Made this with chopped mini peanut butter cups and a half of a cup of creamy peanut butter.  Perfect recipe for creating your favorite candy ice cream concoction.  The texture was creamy and fluffy.  I look forward to making this again with brownies and someday with chocolate creme filled cookies.  The possibilites are endless.

So, I saw this and had to try it! Background:I went to undergrad at West Virginia University- Go Mountaineers!!!!!!!!!!! and they had their own dairy. At the ice cream shop in the student center they sold York Peppermint Patty Ice Cream. So good. So using nonfat sweetened condensed milk, whipped topping and 1% milk, I made this in a 2 quart container- I added less milk than called for. I also only added 1/2 x. of sugar. I used half of a bag of peppermint patties cut into small pieces. Its wonderful!!! Next time I will use a whole bag and will leave the peppermint patties in big chunks. Very easy without an ice cream maker but I will have my maker set up next time to try this again. Cheaper than buying Breyers and Im sure healthier. Thank you!!!

This is an excellent ice cream recipe!  The ingredient list is so short, I thought it would turn out bad, but I was so wrong.  I used this recipe on my first attempt at using my ice cream maker and it was a hit.  I did slightly modify the recipe by using both chopped candy bars and about 15 Oreo cookies.  All I can say is...MMM!

I have made this 3 times in the past week-it is amazing every time. I didn't use ANY sugar, though.  Sweet enough with the Eagle Brand.  So easy and doesn't set up like a rock in the freezer.  Stays 'scoopable'. Especially good with Reese's PB Cups chopped up.  Best home made ice cream I've ever made.

Super good!  Read other reviews, and left out the sugar.  Added oreos instead of candy.  Turned out great, and everyone who tried it enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this idea!  I did it with the neighborhood kids and they thought it was great too.  It took longer than suggested to actually freeze up enough to scoop, but the kids didn't seem to mind.  The icecream was really good too.  A definite keeper for me as well as the other Mothers in the neighborhood!

I don't have an ice cream maker and this recipie turned out really good.  I think next time I would use 1/2 the sugar or no sugar at all because it is very sweet.  I'm going to make it all the time!  Thanks!

This sounded better than it came out. It was too sweet for most of our tastes, even the sugar addict (our son). We used the little M&M's (candy coated chocolate) and the colored shells quickly melted into the ice cream, making everything a light brown. It came out like an ice-milk using 1% milk. If I were to make it again, I'd definitely reduce the sugar...

This is very good. My family loved it.  I did not use the sugar, I used low fat whip and sweetened milk and used soya milk vanilla and mexican vanilla.  My family said it tasted better than store bought.  Great and easy recipe.  I even missed stirring it a couple of times and it turned out.  I did not use an icecream maker.

this was, surprisingly, quite good. made this as a fun project with my kids. we left out the candy pieces and used a few kid-sized handfuls of rainbow sprinkles instead. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet for us.

This ice cream was some of the best ice cream I've ever tasted. I made 1 1/2x the original recipe (using 1 1/2 cans sweetened condensed milk, 1 1/2 cups sugar, etc.) I also added about 3/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and added chopped up peanut butter cups. It was sooooo soooooo good and easy!! Thanks!

Made it with the peanut butter like other reviewers suggested and it was awesome. Also cut WAY back on the sugar -totally unnecessary with the sweetened condensed milk.

I have used this site for years but never reviewed a recipe, until now!!  This is great ice cream.  I was a bit nervous as I only had fat free cool whip in the house and it usually makes my recipes flop, but not this one!!  I don't know why I would try regular cool whip as it took some of the guilt out of this recipe.  I also used 1% milk and only a half cup of sugar but may even reduce that to 1/4 cup next time.  Added Oreos and it was perfect!!  I love the fact that there is no eggs in this recipe as I have small children so taking the time to cook the ice cream is out of the question, and feeding the kids raw eggs makes me nervous.  Thanks again for a GREAT recipe!!

Phew... I omitted some of the sugar and this recipe was still SOOO sweet.  Even my boyfriend with Candy for teeth still thought it was too sweet.  I don't recommend.

Super ice cream!  I halved the sugar and it was still too sweet for my liking.  I will leave out next time.  Also, my ice cream machine instructions suggests using an electric mixer to increase the volume (for recipes that don't require cooking)  I did this and almost did not have room for the milk!  Stirred in oreo cookies towards the end.  Threw it in the freezer and hope no one finds it until our get together!  Love this recipe.

This is wonderful ice cream and super easy (a big plus in my book). I used this recipe for an ice cream social where, like another contributor, I added chunks of York peppermint patties instead of candy coated chocolate. It turned out great, the ice cream had a hint of peppermint flavor with the bonus of candy chunks. I also tried with crushed Butterfingers and it was fabulous. I think that this is a great base ice cream with endless possibilities. Please note that the recipe says the prep time is 3 hours and 5 minutes...using my ice cream freezer there was 5 minutes of prep (if even that) and 45 minutes of freezing...so it is quick, too. This is definately a keeper.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  I use light whipped topping and skim milk.  Even creamier with half-and-half.  We have used this basic recipe to make strawberry, chocolate chip, and peanutbutter/chocolate swirl ice cream.  YUM!

This was the first time i have made ice cream and it was a hit! I made butterfinger and andies mint ice cream.  I did only use 1/2 c. of sugar and I just poured the milk till it hit the fill line  in out maker.  Definitly make again.

This recipe was amazing and exactly what I was looking for. I stopped it in the ice cream maker before it got too hard, since I prefer a soft serve ice cream. I did like other members suggested and only used 1/2 cup of sugar. It is light, fluffy, and easy to make. Thanks for this recipe! I will definitely use it again.

Original recipe makes a very very sweet ice cream! Unless its really frozen solid then you won't taste that much sugar. Use less sugar or condensed milk preferably. Great recipe nonetheless!

This icecream was a huge hit.  I gave it 4 stars because I modified it a little--didn't use the sugar (it's sweet enough as it is!) and used candy canes for my candy.  Fantastic, easy-to-make icecream!

This ice cream was way too sweet and I only used 1/2 cup sugar. I can't imagine using a whole cup!
I don't think any additional sugar is needed as the Cool Whip and sweetened condensed milk are already very sweet.

Great recipe!  I substituted oreo cookie pieces for M&Ms and got great results.  This recipe made more than my ice cream maker could handle, so I kept 1/2 the mixture in the frige until I was ready to use it.  Both batches turned out great! Will definitely make again!

I decided to heed the advice of the other commenters and simply left out the sugar all together.  I must have been tired when I made this, because I accidentally used an 8 oz tub of cool whip and totally forgot to put in the vanilla or candy bits!  But nevertheless, it has come out very tasty.  It's not super soft, but it's also not going to bend your spoon when you scoop it out.  And it's really rich and delicious!  Next time I'm going to try adding peanut butter.

I love this recipe mostly because it uses very simple ingredients that I think most of us have on hand!

I do not make ice cream because it seems labor intensive BUT NOT THIS ONE. It's easy and so good. I used 2 small bags of coconut m&ms and 1 coconut twix bar.

This was the best and easiest ice cream recipe.  I added crushed Butterfinger candy bars to mind.  It was a big hit at our church ice cream fellowship.  It did not seem to sweet but I have a large ice cream freezer so more milk was added.  I will definitely use this recipe many times.

Tastes Like Fresh Soft serve ice cream. Very Good & Easy!. Did half sugar as suggested. I hate marshmallow, & this does not at all taste like marshmallow as previously suggested, Possibly their eyes controlled taste.

I'm sorry, this was way too rich for us. It was like eating soft marshmallows. I made it without the candy. Can't imagine what it would be like with it. Must be 1000 calories a scoop.

Wow, this was great!!  Tried a few ice cream recipes but this is the best.  Used snickers in one and strawberries in the other both were excellent.  Use only 1/2 cup of sugar.

This was a wonderful recipe. I made it w/ crushed oreos instead of candy pieces. I also halved the sugar, as some reviews suggested and it was still a little too sweet. Next time I will leave out the sugar completely. The texture of the ice cream was what made it so amazing though!! Very light and fluffy and delicious!!

This is an awesome base for a lot of ice cream flavors.  I have used a lot of different candy, including chocolate chips, candy bars, and cookies.  I also use low fat or fat free ingredients (besides the candy, of course)and it tastes great.

I made a lot of changes since I was looking for chocolate peanut butter icecream.  My M-I-L always made CPBIC but never wrote down the recipe. So after reading a lot of reviews I thought this recipe would work.  This is what I did: 2-8oz containers Cool Whip, 1-14oz can FF sweetened condensed milk, 1 1/2t vanilla,pinch of salt, 2 C whipping cream, 2-14oz cans evaporated milk, 1 C peanut butter, 1 can Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Combine whipped topping, sweetened cond. milk, vanilla, peanut butter and chocolate syrup in a large bowl. Using a whisk, whip until peanut butter is incorporated into the liquid.  Pour into freezer container- insert paddle. Add cream & evap milk to 2"from the top and freeze in ice cream maker.  Ours didn't harden so we put it into the freezer  and it was very tasty.  It was very hard for me to scoop but DH had not problem. I'm sure we'll make this again!

This ice cream is wonderful! So easy to make (a big plus). I only used 1/4 cup sugar and used 2 bags of Heath Bar chips. GREAT ICE CREAM! Will be making again (& again...).
