This was a very good cake.  A rich and decadent dessert any chocoholic would love!  I did make some changes--I used unsweetened Godiva chocolate, I used 5 yolks so I didn't have them left over.  I used 1/2 c Splenda in the yolks and 1/4 c of Agave Nectar so overall I added less sweetener.  I served it with an all fruit raspberry spread that I warmed and topped with whipped cream.  Next time I may use 3/4c Agave nectar in the yolks and a bit more butter in the chocolate because the cake would have been dry without the spread and whipped cream.  Also I didn't bother with the water bath and I used a greased spring form pan (no parchment).  Maybe would have been more moist with the water bath?  I'll make it again!
