Was kinda bland. Very good, once couple small changes made.  I used half- half and half and half heavy whipping cream for a slightly thicker and creamier consistancy, also you HAVE to salt (a good amt) and pepper to taste.

This is pretty good! I don't know why some people said this soup was too thin. The amount of cornstarch was perfect. Like with all recipes, salt and pepper should be added so I think with that addition, it amped up the taste. Very good! Will be making this again. Edit: fianc√© really wasn't feeling it. He thought it was good but thought the combination of cheese and beer as a soup was strange.

My dad wanted this beer cheese soup and so I tried this recipe.... It was terrible, very bland, almost no texture, and the beer was overpowering. Even when I added extra cheese and salt and pepper it was still bland. My dad and I were very disappointed!!!!

I used flour instead of cornstarch because if you use cornstarch the soup will become watery if you reheat the soup. The soup was very good.
