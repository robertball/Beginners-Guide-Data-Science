The first time I made this, my husband said it was way too oily.  The second time, I put the veggies in a bowl, poured just a little olive oil on top & mixed them with my hands to coat them.  Then I used only 1/4 cup olive oil & half of the seasonings for the dressing.  I substituted pourable Splenda for the sugar & just added some salt & ppper instead of the hot sauce & salad seasoning mix.  I used chopped pecans the 2nd time, which I preferred to the almonds.  Also adding some red peppers to the yellow adds to the presentation.  I'd suggest checking the asparagus after 10 minutes to see how al dente or roasted you'd like them.  I took another reviewer's suggestion & baked them for 18 minutes (9 minutes a side).  Two other suggestions...  If you want leftovers, I'd suggest doubling this recipe.  Also if you refrigerate the dish, you should take it it out ahead of time as the olive oil solidifies in the frig.

Oh wow! The mustard lime vinaigrette in this salad is wonderful! I was worried that it might be kind of "weird" but I loved it! I'm not a big garlic fan so I only used one clove. I also put a bit of the lime zest into the dressing. I cut the bell peppers into strips rather than dice, I wanted bigger chunks. I roasted the onions along with the asparagus and peppers to mellow the onion flavor as well. I poured half the dressing on the warm vegetables, then set the salad aside while the rest of my meal cooked and then added the rest just before serving along with the almonds and parmesan. I don't know what "salad seasoning mix" is but the dish tastes great without it. It came out great and I had plenty of compliments from my guests. I'll make it again!

I just made this for the second time and it has gone over fabulously with all of my dinner guests.  I love that it can be made ahead of time.  My family raved about it at Easter and last night I served it to 14 of my husband's co-workers.  It was great!
My only change was to hold back a little of the hot sauce in fear that perhaps some of my guests did not like things quite so spicy/hot.  It is a fabulous dish to make ahead of time for a party and reserve a few toasted almonds to sprinkle on the top just before serving.  I also used both red and yellow peppers to add additional color.  If it hadn't been raining I would have grilled the vegetables outside instead of oven roasting for additional flavor.  This is definitely a "keeper", and even worth paying a little extra for asparagus when not in season.

This is fast becoming one of my favorite salads!  A few changes I've made are: slivered almonds instead of sliced (more "substance" there), shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated (the grated cheese kind of "clumped up" when you mixed it in), a longer cooking time (about 18 minutes total) to get the veggies tender AND I cut the dressing recipe in half since it doesn't take much, especially since the veggies are already covered with olive oil.  This salad takes some great ingredients and combines them in a way that makes them all BETTER!

I made this for my family's July 4th dinner.  Everyone liked it very much.  I personally thought it was delicious, although I may try a little less dijon mustard next time, as I thought it dominated the flavor of the dressing.  Following the advice of some of the other reviews, I used both red and yellow peppers and substituted pecans (toasted) for the almonds.  It was delicious this way and added more color.  I did use a bit less onion because my family doesn't like heavy onion flavor.  I didn't know what "salad seasoning mix" was either, so I used about a teaspoon of Good Seasons Roasted Garlic salad dressing mix.  It was good, but I didn't think it was really necessary because the dressing tasted really flavorful before adding the seasoning.  It was a really good recipe and I will definitely use it again.

Wow, there are a lot of flavors going on in this dish!  The vegetable mix with the cheese and almonds is great on its own, but I thought the dressing was a tad strong--definitely go easy on it.  I think the salad dressing mix (does that mean italian?) can be left out totally, and the lime juice taste was overpowered by the mustard. I may use red wine vinegar next time.  Also a teaspoon is a lot of hot sauce, which I like, but most people can't handle.  The roasting really flavors the veggies nicely.  I will be making this again.

I really liked this, but my wife thought it was too spicy.  She did ask me to make it again without the hot sauce.

I received ***** ratings from everyone at my dinner party.  All 9 guests were attempting to tell me what was in this salad that made it so good...few discovered the secret ingredients of the dressing.  I used red, yellow and green peppers and toasted pecans.  In the dressing I used a some fresh chopped cilantro when adding to the salad.  Everyone wanted a copy of the recipe.  I will use again and again this summer.

I've made the dressing part of this (1/2 cup olive oil thru salad seasoning) several times for different salads and it's always a big hit!

Excellent.  Did roast longer - 18 minutes - 
Everone loved it at picnic.  Even better next day.  My husband heated his the next day and loved it that way too.  Will definitely make again.

If less than one star was available, I would give it !  I love every ingredient in this recipe but the Red Onion ruined it.  It overwhelmed it.  I should have roasted the onion like someone suggested but I was afraid that the salad would be too limp.  I would suggest using a Vidalia instead of a Red Onion.  I made the salad exactly as written (minus the salad seasoning..I didn't know what that was either).  The dressing was great.... This was my first disappointing recipe of all the zillions that I have tried!!

Absolutely AMAZING, my husband loved it as well.  The salad seasoning is not needed at all, even tho I have no idea what it is, I think more flavors could have ruined the dressing.  Instead of almonds I chopped and lightly caramelized walnuts, gave the dish a little more flavor and warm.  I also used cayenne pepper in place of hot sauce for a more subtle spice and it was PERFECT.  Mix in some grilled chicken and its a whole meal.  Great new recipe for asparagus!!!!!

My family loves onions, but this recipe called for a bit too much.  If you don't want to smell like onions for days, reduce to 1/4 to 1/2 onion.

Put the veggies all in a ziplock. Drizzle in some olive oil, sprinkle in some salt and pepper and roast. So good on it's own, didn't even need the dressing even though I had already made some.

I had to cut the oil in 1/2 for both parts of the recipe and it was still plenty oily. I also didn't quite use all the dressing. Other than that it was AMAZING!!!! I used a red and yellow pepper and thinner asaparagus. Because of that the pepper needed a about 4 mins longer in the oven. I also roasted the onion with the other veggies.

This is super good!  Used red pepper instead of yellow, chopped nuts instead of slices, but was fabulous and tasted like it came from a fancy deli.  The dressing, though high in fat, is delicious.  Could probably cut down on the amount of oil to reduce fat content.  Will definitely make again.

Made this past weekend for a bbq with family.  We all really liked it.  Served with green salad, salmon & flank steak.  Would make again without using all of the dressing.  Didn't care for it the second day though, much better fresh on the first day.

Cut back a little bit on the dijon but not by much. Followed the recipe to the letter except my asparagus and yellow peppers roasted for a little while longer. What a delicious and beautiful salad. This is a winner and I cannot wait to make this for friends.

Follow all the advice about the dressing:  only use 1/2 as much as called for & cut way back on mustard & garlic.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon of italian dressing mix (for 1/2 the dressing recipe), because that's what was laying around, but any seasoning salt would probably do.  If you don't use "salad seasoning mix" (whatever that is)or some other similar item, you will need to add some salt & pepper.  Otherwise, I agree with all the previous reviewers; this is a colorful, delicious, and different salad--a winner all around.

Really liked the idea but I modified it a bit and really enjoyed it. As others suggested I tossed the cut asparagus and red and yellow peppers in olive oil and threw them in my grill basket. Used about 1/4 of a large red onion.  Made only about half the dressing and added couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar.  Cut back on the mustard and hot sauce too. Still had a lot of flavor and the grill flavor really helped too.  Will do again. Thanks for the starting place for a yummy healthy salad.

This was so delicious! I didn't make a cold salad with it, though--I had it right out of the oven (I roasted the onions too) and drizzled the sauce over it. I omitted the almonds, just because it would have been too hard to eat with the whole pieces of asparagus (I didn't cut it). I started with half the amount of olive oil and added about another tablespoon until it seemed the right consistency. Plus, I used stevia instead of sugar. I'll try this as a cold salad, but I love it hot!

This recipe is delicious!  We made it often on the barbecue this summer and it was so delicious, we didn't even add a dressing.  It keeps nicely in the fridge for a day or two assuming there's any left after dinner!

Made this for dinner tomorrow, and I keep sneaking bites! YUM! Having made this a couple of times, I do cut the Olive Oil & Dijon in half, and I also roast all of the veggies (including the onion-helps cut down the bite), individually, to get the cooking time right. Instead of sprinkling the olive oil on the veg's, I throw them into a plastic bag, add oil, shake to coat and dump into the pan for roasting. This and the "Winter Fruit Salad with Poppyseed Dressing" from this site are the BEST SALADS EVER.

I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out. I usually like these things in theory, but when I make them they never taste very good. I am happy to report that this was great! I couldn't locate my salad seasoning, but the dressing was fine without it!  This is a fabulous side dish. We served it along with some fish. This turned out to the the stand out!

Do what the original recipe says and roast for only 8-10 minutes.  I thought the vinaigrette was boring...not sure what I missed because it should have been great with all the ingredients.

I didn't use near the amount of asparagus called for, just enough for about 2 people.  I drastically cut down on the dressing ingredients, just kind of eyeballed it all.  I loved it!!  Very flavorful!

This is my new favorite summer salad. I used red bell peppers instead of yellow (they were on sale for .67 @ ) and it was spectacular!!

Great dish! I brought this to our Summer Cookout at work and everyone raved over the dish asking for the recipes! I added orange peppers to give it more color as well. I would even add red ones to!

I made this for a church potluck and it was totally gone.  Think someone may have licked the bowl.  I normally don't appreciate reviews when the reviewers details all of the changes they made but I will mention that I omitted the nuts because of serving to a large group and instead added a few crushed croutons and it turned out great.

This recipe is excellent. It is very tangy and full of different flavors. The alterations I made to the recipe was I replaced the dijon mustard with extra lime juice, used about half the amount of parmesan cheese, and served it hot instead of cold.

This was off-the-hook delicious! We grilled the asparagus instead of broil it, and wow, it was so good. After initially eating this, we saved the rest of it in the fridge for about a week.  When we took it out, it was just as good, if not better as the first time around.  Thanks for a tasty and different recipe, Kim!

The combination of flavors was pleasant, the only problem I had was that there was just too much oil.  I don't love the taste of olive oil and would cut back as the whole salad ended up with a greasy texture.  Very simple though and had a nice flavor.

WOW!  What a nice surprise.  When I served it, dear hubby thought it was warm but was pleasantly surprised that it was a cold salad.  I used roasted pine nuts instead of almonds and that gave it a nice flavour.  Also took the advice from a past review and used 2 TBSP Dijon Mustard insted of 3 and added Epicures Herb and Garlic Dip Mix (1tsp) to the dressing mix! Yummy!   Roasted veggies for 18 minutes- they needed longer to soften and roast. Very good salad, have already told a friend about it!!

I also roasted the onions with the asparagus and peppers (I used yellow and red) and used pine nuts.  I doubled the recipe, but could easily have halved the dressing.  Delicious, different and very easy.

My husband and I both loved this salad.  I roasted the onion with the other vegetables, and I used toasted pecans because it's what I had.  I served it tossed with green leaf lettuce to make a very unusual salad.  I only needed half of all that dressing though!

I roasted other vegetables too, and mixed everything with the dressing.  Dressing was kind of spicy!  Maybe I used more than a teaspoon of hot sauce?  Very good, though.

I used a bit too much olive oil when roasting and too much dressing, so my salad was a little oily.  Next time I will be more carfeul.  However, the flavors are wonderful and this will be a new staple in my recipe collection!

I've made this recipe probably 10 times now & I don't think I've ever made it the same twice. I love that it's flexible & guests ALWAYS love it & comment on how pretty it is. I always make it at Thanksgiving w/ 1 yellow & 1 orange bell pepper & at Christmad w/ 2 red. Also, the bell peppers should be sliced, in my opinion. Also, I roast the asparagus & bell peppers seperately, as the peppers are mush by the time the asparagus is done. About 20 min on the asparagus w/ only a couple tbl. Olive oil, turning once 1/2 way through. Then, remove asparagus from pan, add peppers & a drizzle more oil. Roast 10 min, turning once. I add the oil/juice liquid left in the bottom of the pan to the dressing as well. I'm always changing the dressing & it's always been good, so feel free to play w/ the ingrediants. Also, you can buy pre-packaged Honey-roasted sliced almonds & they are a fab sub for plain sliced. When serving a lg crowd, I will often double the asparagus, w/o doubling the rest of the ingrediants & the proportions actually seem to be better that way & there'll be enough for 15 ppl to have small portions.

I wish I had listened to LoosenUp & stuck w/ the original roasting time but I cooked them a little longer than called for ... Yep, they were overdone. Still tasty but no longer al dente. I used a red pepper becasue that's what I had & I sliced it imto strips instead of chopping it. I used a vidalia onion, thinly sliced (I did not roast the onion) & I cut wayyy back on the oil in the vinaigrette. I did add more lime juice & also decreased the mustard some. Very nice cold salad! the roasting really brought out the flavor in the veggies. I served thsi w/ Amy's Garlic Egg Chicken (from this site)

Great new way to eat asparagus.  I grilled the asparagus and yellow pepper on the grill, which added some great char flavor to the salad.  I also toasted the almonds in a pan with some butter.  I didn't measure out the dressing ingredients, but I added less mustard (I don't like mustard) and probably a little more lime juice than stated in the recipe.

Very Good. Like previous reviews, I found that this recipe had too much oil. Next time I would use only half as much. I also used jalapeno peppers instead of the hot sauce. It was excellent. I would definitely make this again.

This is my first review of a recipe on this site.  I read other reviews and roasted the red onions along with the asparagus, red and yellow peppers.  It was awesome.  My husband and 3 year old daughter loved it.  I will try to grill the veggies next time.  The dressing was yummy- only a few dashes of hot sauce so my daughter could enjoy it as well.  Will use the dressing for a regular salad as well.

This is so good. I would make the dressing just to eat on salads. I did cut all the oil way down. I just gently misted the asparagus and yellow peppers before roasting them. I also only used 1/8 cup of oil instead of the 1/2 cup it called for. We loved all the different flavors and hot sauce was just enough heat for us. It does make a LOT of dressing, for the amount of asparagus and peppers called for, so next time I would only make 1/2 the amount of dressing or double up on my veggies.

I surprised my pot luck friends by bringing this salad to our Memorial Day gathering other than my usual carbohydrate laden dishes.  It went over well.  I tweaked it a bit as did those in the other reviews.  Less olive oil, roasted the onion with the asparagus & peppers (used a red & yellow) and went easy on the hot sauce. I will make this again for family as it is quick, easy and tasty.  I wish I would have taken a picture, it is a beautiful dish.

What a fantastic salad! Thank you. Roasted the almonds in the oven for 9 minutes while the asparagus and peppers baked for 18 minutes total time. Husband raved about this salad and he doesn't usually like asparagus or bell peppers. He absolutely LOVED this salad and ate leftovers the next day. Great recipe. It's a must try and really easy.
