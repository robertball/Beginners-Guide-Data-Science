These were very rich and decadent. I used espresso powder instead of instant coffee, and that flavor definitely came through. I got lots of compliments on how pretty the swirl looked, and everyone went back for seconds because they tasted great! They're not difficult to make but they do dirty a lot of bowls, so there is some cleanup involved...but I'll make them again!
