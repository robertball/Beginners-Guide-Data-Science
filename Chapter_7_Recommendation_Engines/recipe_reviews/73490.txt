I love this and eat it all the time...I scale this down for myself - 1/2 cup cottage cheese, 1 med. tomato, 1/2-1/3 cucumber, salt and pepper to taste - sometimes I add avocado.

MMMMMMM...this is WONDERFUL!!!  It's light, refreshing, and can be adapted in an infinite number of ways.  I like it as is, however (which is very unusual) and so if I could, I would give this simple, easy, why-didn't-I-think-of-this-before recipe 10 stars!!!

I really loved this as my lunch today. I did add garlic and onion powders and a good splash of lemon juice. Lots of black cracked pepper made it just perfect. A very refreshing salad for a hot and humid day. Thanks Randi!!

To avoid a sloppy and unpleasant consistency, I always deseed both the tomatoes and cucumber. I also use English cucumbers, and keep the skin on for a bit of extra crunch. Thanks!

This is tough to rate because I just realized I'm not even sure if I've ever had/like cottage cheese.  I made this as a simple dinner side and while we both ate it, I'm not sure it's something I'll make again.  That being said, it IS a nice change of pace light (I used fat free cottage cheese) side.  It's a pretty *naked* palate, open to adding whatever herbs/spices/seasoning you prefer to up the flavor a notch.  THANKS for a nice change of pace side, Randi!

I did not have green onions so left them out, but this was a hit.  Very summery with good flavored tomatoes - and my 22 month old asked for thirds!!

Yum!! Loved this...I just saw it recommended on the Recipe Exchange and had all the ingredients on hand, so I made it for my lunch. I love all the ingredients, so it figures I love the salad! I added about a tablespoon of Red Italian Dressing (from this site) and it's to die for. This is my new go-to summer snack/lunch when I don't have any leftovers. Thanks!!!

Made this in the morning to eat for a healthy lunch and was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  It needed something and I can figure out what. I love tomatoes, cucumbers and cottage cheese, but it need some zip.

I did not like this at all.  I think it was the green onions to be honest, they were too overpowering!  And I like just about anything lol.

This recipe is wonderful, I substituted the salt and pepper for a package of dry ranch dressing mix. And I dont put onions in it.  Absolutely yummy.

I used a 24 oz cont and just eye-balled the ingredients.  As others suggested I added a pepper (yellow) and made sure all the veggies were not watery.  I dabbed them with a paper towel before tossing in!   AWESOME!   A nice healthy lunch!

I cut the cottage cheese back to a half container and used lowfat. I let it sit most of the day until I couldn't stand it anymore. I did pepper it real good.  Filling salad. Very good.

Used 24 oz. container of cottage cheese, one large seeded cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and omitted the salt. Very creamy and delicious. Let it chill overnight for better flavor.

Literally only takes 5 minutes. Amazing! I threw some fresh parsley in for kicks; I'm totally making this on the next spaghetti night.

The recipe as it is would not be four star, but with the following additions it was delicious and very healthy and will go into my regular rotation: basil, garlic powder, radishes, shredded carrot and herb salt. I would also use half the amount of green onions as it's a bit too onion-y.

This is a great basis, but it is missing a few ingredients for me.  I mixed in a teaspoon of fresh chopped basil in with the cheese, added chopped celery and a bit of grated carrots, which gave me a 3-colour salad.  It is great anytime of the day and healthy, too!  Also, unlike other salads, I find this one satisfies my appetite.

Followed the recipe exactly. Found that it tasted like green onions and not much else. I wondered if full fat cottage cheese would make a difference. I used 1%. I love all the ingredients, but something was missing. Husband felt the same. Won't make again.

This is delicious, and so easy to make! The only substitution I made was using garlic pepper as opposed to regular pepper b/c I'm obsessed w/garlic! :)  Thanks for a great, healthy recipe!

First time using cottage cheese in a salad. Was surprised that the family, including 3 teens loved it and all went for seconds. I added chopped celery, Kraft Zesty Italian, and some hot sauce. Will make it again! (have to it's all gone)

I just now realized I never added the cucumber to this (slap upside head) Anyway, even w/o the cucumbers this was amazingly good. I deseeded the tomatoes as well.

I have made a Cottage Cheese salad for many years. The more ingredients the better. I put chopped black olives, sweet and/or dill pickles, grated carrot along with tomatoes and chopped green onion.

Surprisingly Good! I was looking for a recipe that is "Gout" friendly, and all the ingrediants passed in this one.  Usually, I don't really like tomatoes or cottage cheese but I really do like this salad!!

Loved It! Used all the same ingredients but didn't measure anything. The flavors go well together so any proportion that one finds pleasing will work well. Used freshly ground salt & pepper. Healthy, easy and tasty.

I made as stated with the exception of  using grape tomatoes and not romas. I tasted the result and thought it was really good. Then I did the mistake of adding salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and some lemon juice. NO GO! I liked the original recipe as is and will make it that way next time.

Quite refreshing and filling, I did think it was a bit bland (but a few herbs and spices to taste quickly fixed that).

I did this with onion, carrots, broccoli, raisins, and sunflower seeds. It was okay - next time if I have the suggested ingredients in the recipe, I try that.

Wow...what a great tasting recipe!  I would have never thought to put onions/tomatoes/cucumbers with cottage cheese. I've always eaten it alone or with pineapple.  It was truly refreshing but SO tasty!  I took it to work and shared it with a friend who also loved it and immediately asked for the recipe.  I've tried several recipes from this site but this is the first one that was I've reviewed because it was just so good I had to share my opinion.

This was really good but only after I took the advice of other reviews. I added the lemon and garlic salt, I also added about a table spoon of sour cream. Very healthy and refreshing!

This recipe was good, but the salad was really wet by the time I served it.  I even seeded, salted, rinsed and drained the cucumbers to reduce the liquid they exude.  I also seeded the tomatoes for the same reason, and the salad was still sitting in a pool of liquid.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and added diced radishes, garlic powder, a squirt of lemon juice and lots of pepper. The flavor was good, but I couldn't get past the wetness of of it. After the meal, I placed the leftover salad in a sieve to drain it, and got more than 1/2 cup of milky fluid out of it.  I'll make it again, but will drain the cottage cheese before making the salad.

Love this!  Brings me back to my childhood-my mom made this as well and put radishes if we had them.  Serve with some tortilla chips and it becomes a nice dip for a snack.

Really quick and easy to make depending on how fast you can chop.  :)  I only used 2 Roma tomatoes and added half of an orange bell pepper.  Also, 2 large green onions was more than plenty.

I've just been told by my doctor that I must go on a serious no cholesterol diet. I've always put fresh fruit on cottage cheese and never tried a savory salad with it. Today I found this recipe and
I made this today. I added a famous no salt substitute,  dill and a Tbsp acv. I ate the entire bowl before I thought to take a picture.

I've been making this for years, had never seen a recipe for it that I know of and I'm not sure when or where I got this from.  Gotta say it's one of my favorite salads/snacks just as written and is how I usually eat it.  Sometimes though I'll pour in a little Italian dressing or add either Dijon mustard or horseradish if I'm in the mood.  Easy recipe to scale down for one person.  Great recipe, thanks!

I really like this just as written.  I am also experimenting with lime juice and garlic powder, because I always dink around with recipes, but have to say the original is great. I agree with other comments-to avoid runny salad, consider sticking to roma tomatoes and de-seed yours if they are juicy. Also, English cukes have less liquid, and no seeds.

Very refreshing summer salad.  Can make a lunch out of this salad alone. Thanks for a yummy recipe!! ***UPDATE*** Try adding a little salad dressing to the mixture for a different taste. Ranch and Zesty Italian are both good in this salad.

I did not care for this recipe. I only used half of the amount of the vegetables and all it turned out to be is a whole lot of vegetables and a very tiny bit of cottage cheese!!  Won't waste the expensive ingredients again!!

This recipe is really good after adding some radish. To my mind, there's also something acidic missing in the flavor... Probably adding lemon juice would solve the problem ;)

I love this salad and eat it all the time. I find it very refreshing and filling at the same time.
