These are absolutely delicious-- the ground almonds and lemon zest are a refreshing addition to a basic shortbread recipe.  We couldn't keep our hands off them even BEFORE they were dipped in chocolate.  I sent most of the finished cookies to work with my husband, where they received rave reviews.

I thought the cookies were okay. They were a little sweet, so next time, I would put in less sugar. And, I added some crisco to the chocolate, because it was too thick and the cookes kept breaking in it when i tried dipping them.  Also, the thinner these cookies are, the better.
