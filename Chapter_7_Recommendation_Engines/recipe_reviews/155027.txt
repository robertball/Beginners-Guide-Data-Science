So easy, so delish! I used prepared nog which tasted very nutmeggy already, so instead of using nutmeg, I sifted on a layer of cinnamon.  Love this overall, could have eaten the whole thing by myself, but...it's not very eggnoggy.  It simply tastes like a delicious vanilla custard.  Next time I'll use the nutmeg instead and see if that ups the eggnog flavor.  Overall, love it, will make it again.

This is a perfect custard recipe!  I have been making custards my whole adult life and this recipe is among the best and easiest!  I cannot for the life of me figure out what other reviewers are doing wrong with this recipe.  It is fail-proof! Check your ovens!

I was very disappointed in this custard.  It took an hour and 45 minutes to bake, and when the toothpick finally came out clean, the tops were so brown it almost looked like they were burnt--though, luckily, they weren't.  While the taste was pretty good, the consistency was almost disgusting, eggy curds and watery on the bottom.  Not recommended if you like real custards.

It was so rich that I could only eat a little. It was so simple to make though and the leftovers were gone the next day.

I am NOT a custard fan but...this was terrific.  I think it would work as a Cream Brule (??) it was so rich and creamy.

Pretty good. Tastes like eggnog flan but without the sugar syrup (which would be a nice addition). Nothing too exciting or special, but a nice way to use up eggnog after the holidays.

I had the same problem as wildwing - very curdy like and loads of liquid in the bottom.  Although the taste was good, the texture was nothing like custard.  So disappointing...

I saw this recipe in a slow cooker cook book so I increased the serving size and put half in the ramekins in a slow cooker (3 1/2 hours on low)and half the ramekins in the oven. I topped them with broken ginger snaps that made a nice crust on the top, (at least the oven ones did). I then chilled in the fridge for a few hours. I forgot to put on sugar. I also used egg beaters in hoping that it would all blend better. As for the flavor it was just ok for me. I am not a huge custard/brule/flan fan and the texture was really close to that. The oven ones were definitely better. The slow cooker ones had a more seperated look, lumpy texture and there was fluid on the bottom. Interesting to try but sad I wasted holiday eggnog on it.

It was kinda confusing, simply because I had two choices: one small custard cup, when inserted into the pan, was covered by the water; the other cup held both servings too easily. Just adjust it so you have enough to fit in your cup, I guess! :) Otherwise, it was very good.

Super easy to make! I was looking for an easy eggnog custard recipe and this was just right.  I combined the ingredients using a blender and added a little extra cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and half the sugar.  Topped with cinnamon sugar and nutmeg and cooked for the full 45 minutes.

Made this three times already. Absolutely great. I used an electric blender to make sure everything was mixed well together. I also drained through a strainer to get rid of the bubbles. Baked it in 2 small ramekins in the oven as directed, left them on the counter to cool, cover them with plastic wrap, then refrigerated them for a day. They turned out very creamy and have an almost mousse-like consistency! So yummy! After the second time making these, I omitted the sugar and nutmeg; thought it was already flavorful enough.

Foolproof.  Even when I allowed water to enter the custard (by mistake) it turned out nicely.

Excellent!!! I omitted the sugar the second time I made this as I find the eggnog is already sweet enough and adding more was a bit too much in my opinion. But this could not be easier or more delicious! If you follow the directions, you will not have a "curdly" texture as some have mentioned. Just blend your ingredients very well and use the water bath when baking your custard and you will have a creamy, silken, decadent dessert to enjoy. :)

I’ve made this recipe twice so far with no changes. Great both times. The first time was just as custard, second time As creme brûlée. I’m not sure of criticisms, but I beat my eggs in electric mixer, then added sugar & beat. It had nice thickness, then I beat in the eggnog. I did add nutmeg while beating to spread flavor. Flavor & texture were great.  I do tend to over cook, Incase it doesn’t set up or my oven acts up. In this case you can cover with foil after 30 min, but I’m getting the timing down. Next time I will play with adding extracts or rum. Very easy, very tasty. I would be confident to serve the Brûlée for a dinner party.

Easy peasy and yummy, I suspect the result has a lot to do with the quality of the egg nog itself. A keeper.

Always whip up my own nog for the holidays, and thought I'd try something with the leftover. This recipe pointed me in the right direction. You must bake in a water bath as instructed. Otherwise, you'll end up with scrambled eggs and whey, as apparently happened with one reviewer. The same proportions work for French toast, which I did with leftover dinner rolls, pan rolls in this case. Just cut off top and bottom crusts, sliced the remaining in half or thirds according to the height of the roll, and I was in business.

This was my first time making custard and it was an easy first time recipe.  It turned out perfect. It was a very mild eggnog taste and my husband really liked it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Perfectly smooth and creamy. Delicious. Worked exactly as the submitter said. Mixture fit perfectly in two 8-9oz ramekins, which fit perfectly in the 8" pan with the water bath. So easy. I was a bit short on eggnog (only had 3/4 cup) so I made up the difference with some whole milk. I added a couple drops of vanilla (suppose rum may have been better?) and kept everything else the same-grating fresh nutmeg on top (the best way to get great, fresh nutmeg flavor and super easy). I didn't think the sugar was too much,  maybe because I didn't use a full cup of sweet eggnog, though it was guide sweet and I'd probably reduce it if I had the full cup off eggnog.  I actually really liked it this way and would do it again because the eggnog flavor (prairie farms) was still very dominant.  I mixed everything quickly and easily in a two cup liquid measuring cup with a fork (I see no need for a blender here- really), hardly any clean up. I wonder about those who had problems- I noticed one reviewer mentioned waiting for a toothpick to come out clean- but the recipe says to cook until set, nothing at all about a toothpick. Overcooking would definitely be bad for the egg as it will continue to cook out of the stove- and firm as it cools. I did add 5 extra minutes-so a total of 50. This recipe is really hard to mess up if you follow the directions. The water bath is very important.

I added a tiny amount of vanilla and some brandy.  I didn't time mine, but came out just fine in under 1 hour.  I sprinkled the top with brown sugar and brulee'd them.  This was a fantastic recipe that made 2 1/2 ramekins full which was perfect for me and hubby :)

Love this custard! It was so easy to make. It did take longer than the recipe states though - I baked it for about an hour, and it was perfect. 

It was on the sweet side (the eggnog was already pretty sweet), so I might try a little less sugar next time. 

All in all though, my new go-to custard recipe.

I made this two ways, in the oven and I put some in a pot and cooked out the egg. Then put it on the freezer to set. I did have a few eggy peices but that was my fault for not mixing the egg correctly, but over all it the flavor was there. This was my first time making custard and the consistency was a little weird not like custard. Flavor was there. I think there is a step missing in the recipe but I did enjoy it

I couldn't believe how easy this was! I doubled the recipe and filled 6 regular sized ramekins. The eggnog I used was very nutmeggy, so the custard was delicious. I won't buy a boxed mix ever again!

Wow. Followed this recipe exactly and use a small medium ceramic oval baking dish and a much smaller circular bowl and this turned out amazing! Never made custard in my life and this  turned out great. I love it more than eggnog alone. Also... Added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the top of each and I think the entire thing was perfect

Super easy with little to clean up! Turned out amazing with no alterations to the recipe. The custatd melts in your mouth and for me and my family it was perfectly sweet and eggnogy. I used horizon organic eggnog, not sure if the brand of eggnog makes a whole lot of diiference or not but worked great for me!

I really liked this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, put my pan of water in the oven while it was preheating and ended up baking for the full 45 minutes.  Lovely texture and flavour and too easy to make; I kept checking the recipe to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything as it's so simple.  I grated fresh nutmeg on top and it browned up almost like creme caramel.  Thanks!
