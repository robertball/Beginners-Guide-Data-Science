I'm not reviewing, I'm just clarifying: the recipe calls for cheesecake flavored pudding, but the description says chocolate is used. Which one? This sounds soooo delicious, but I don't want to make it wrong. :)

Wow, wow, wow!!!! This should be called "Paradise in Your Mouth"!! Really, if you like coconut, this is the treat for you. I used Vanilla flavor pudding, used melted chocolate chips to drizzle between layers and on top (with toasted coconut), and made my own crust using Nila wafers, coconut, and butter. And oh, like another reviewer, I also used regular flaked coconut, which I put in the fridge while I was working on the crust. 
I mean, really, how can you go wrong with anything with cream of coconut in the ingredients?!!

Rather decadent.  Will make again, though I'll likely use real whipped cream next time instead of Cool Whip.

VERY, VERY GOOD.   Tasted like an Almond Joy bar!!!  However, I couldn't ever finish a whole slice of it it--tasted rich!  Not complaining--just next time I may cut the cream cheese and pudding down a tad?!

This is a wonderful recipe; a hit with the family, that I will make again! Very thick and rich, so yes, a half slice is enough. I did use french vanilla pudding mix instead of cheesecake, because the store didn't have it.

A word of caution, however: DON'T TRY MAKING THIS IN ONE STORE BOUGHT OREO PIE CRUST. It simply won't fit as the recipe is written. 

The recipe calls for half of the thick pudding layer, a layer of chocolate, then the 2nd half of the pudding layer. (This looked really nice when we cut into it, btw.) But the pie pan is already very full by this point, and you simply can't fit the next layer of coconut whipped topping over this.

I ended up stopping at that point and drizzling another layer of chocolate on top and some sliced almonds, which looked nice. The topping hardened in the freezer, making it easier to transport. I served the pie with the 2nd container of whipped topping on the side, and just ate the delicious candies. If you have a larger pie pan, or a baking dish and make your own crust, I'm sure you could follow the recipe exactly. That's what I'll do next time.

This is one of those desserts that it's almost a rule that you need to share your slice with a friend.  It's absolutely delicious, but very very rich.

Oh gosh, this was a hit, both in appearance and taste! Rather than using chocolate ice cream topping, I made a simple ganache by pouring 1 cup of simmering cream over 1 cup of chocolate chips, stirring until smooth, and cooling in refrigerator.  I like Almond Joys, so between each layer, I poured not only the chocolate ganache, but some chopped almonds and some of the toasted coconut.  I topped the whole thing with more chocolate, almonds and coconut as well (I've posted a photo).  It was delicious, but even better the next day, served frozen.  I think that next time, however, I will make this in a 9x13 pan - the pie was mile-high and difficult to slice in small enough pieces as it is extremely rich.  We got 12 slices out of the pie; I'm sure that we would get 16 out of a 9x13 pan.

Oh so rich!  Half a piece is plenty :)
If you love coconut, try this.  I made it in a 9x13 pan with an Oreo crust (Oreos and butter) and it was perfect. The rest of the ingredients I kept as written. BTW, you will find Cream of Coconut by the drink mixers . I think I will leave off the Almond Joy candy bars next time.  They are pretty on top but you don't need them to add to the flavor of the dessert.  This will easily make enough for a crowd of 12+ using a 9x13 size and making the pieces smaller because seriously, you don't want more than a bit at a time.  Great recipe!
