I was torn between 2 and 3 stars on this one, but decided on 3 because some tweaks can be made to improve it. First off, this was way too salty and I'm a big salt fan.  As I was mixing together the spice blend, I was thinking it was making an awful lot and that there was a ton of salt since lemon pepper seasoning is already salty as is...but I went with it.  On the two chicken breasts, I only used 1/4 of the seasoning I had mixed up because there was so much of it, and it still came out too salty.  The amount of seasoning as written would be enough for about 8 breasts.  I highly recommend you only make a half batch at most, and leave out the salt - only sprinkle some on at the end if needed.  I used 8oz breasts and they were done at 10 minutes. The onions were starting to burn, so keep an eye on things. I do like broiling chicken though, as they tend to come out juicy (assuming you don't overcook them!).

At first, I wasn't sure of the lemon pepper with paprika, but this turned out to be a great recipe with just a couple of revisions. I ended up squeezing a 1/2 lemon and marinated for a couple of hours. After marinating, I seared the chicken, then placed on the onion and marinade and baked at 350 degrees until complete. Very tasty indeed!

This was so flavorful!  I didnâ€™t use garlic, oil or onion, but I also made it on the grill.

It's easy and quick to make, but nothing to write home about.
