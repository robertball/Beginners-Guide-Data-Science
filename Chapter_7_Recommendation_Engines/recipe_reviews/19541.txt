This came out wonderfully!  I added an onion and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil... and cooked until well done.. I will be making this often!

These are really, really good!  I liked that they were different from the usual cinnamon flavor you find in most sweet potato recipes.  I used EVOO instead of veg oil and lowered the oven temp to 400.  No problems with burned onions...just perfectly cooked yummy potatoes.  Thanks Jessica!

I scaled the recipe down for 1 sweet potato...I used about a third of the packet of soup mix. I lined my pan with foil, and tossed the potato chunks, the oil and the soup mix in the pan to save on clean-up. I stirred about every ten minutes. I didn't have any problem with sticking, but like some other reviewers mentioned, many of the onion falkes burned pretty badly. The result still tasted OK, I picked out the most charred pieces...but I definately wouldn't serve this to anyone I love!

I only used half as much soup mix as called for, after reading the reviews...  This recipe is a good start but it needs some tweaking.  The first time I cooked it at 425 in a shallow pan and they still got a little burned.  When I made this again and I combined the soup mix and oil a few hours ahead of time so the onions would soften.  I baked it in a smaller pan covered with foil for 45 minutes at 350 (I was also making a pork roast).  Then took off the foil for another 30 minutes til the roast was done... they came out much better, nicely caramelized and the onion flavor wasn't overpowering :)

Excellent recipe that's a welcome change from all the typical sugary sweet potato recipes! I cut the recipe in half and used olive oil vs. veg. oil. I also left the skin on the potatoes. This was so easy, yet so tasty!  I cut back on the cooking time - more like 30 minutes and tossed this a couple of times during cooking. I would definitly make this again and perhaps do a combination of russet and sweet potaotes.

These didn't need the full cooking time and i took them out after about 25 minutes so they didn't burn. They were lovely, a great side dish

I've done this same recipe using red potatoes, the soup mix gives it an awesome flavor.  Good recipe.  I may try the boxed vegetable soup mix and oil on cut up russet potatoes now too. Endless.

So simple and so good!  I used hot and sour soup mix instead of onion for an extra kick and it turned out great!  I will definitely be using this recipe again  for a quick-to-prepare sidedish.

This was so yummy! I turned the heat down to 425 degrees as others had stated that their onions burned. I baked for 40 minutes and it turned out perfectly. (Oh, I also halved the recipe, cause I was only cooking for 2 . . . used about 3 large sweet potatoes and 1 pkg. onion soup). I would definately make this again, the potatoes were tender but a little crispy and delicious!

I have been making this for years.  I use only one package of onion soup mix. I also add chopped red pepper. The crispy taste of the potatoes and the roasted red pepper is just great. It goes well with roast pork, turkey and chicken. I get raves everytime I serve it.

Actually good, and I don't even really care for sweet potatoes. Instead of the onion soup mix I used two small yellow onions diced finely for three medium to large sweet potatoes, also diced. I spread them out onto a greased cookie pan, sprinkled them with a pinch of kosher salt and cracked black pepper, added a couple splashes of good balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, stirred everything together and let it roast for about 30 minutes. I was aiming for and achieved caramelized onions, which imparted a really nice flavor to the dish. My husband loved it.

Love this recipe! I have made it so many times of the last two years. I actually use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Since I usually serve warm rolls with honey butter with these, I drizzle some of the honey butter over the potatoes the last five minutes of baking. YUM! I also microwave the potatoes until tender before peeling. If you let them cool the peeling comes right off and they don't have to bake as long in the oven..just a couple modifications I've made over the last year or so.

Super easy - I mixed all ingredients in a 9"x13" pan, and a delicious side dish was ready in 30 minutes.  Healthy, too!  I used less oil, less than 1 onion soup envelope and 1 chopped onion.

This recipe was surprisingly good and easy. I'm a student so I just used half of a large sweet potato added 2 teaspoons of the onion soup mix, a bit of olive oil, and a handful of green beans then baked it at 400 for about 18 minutes. I'll definitely be using it again.  EDIT: I've been making these potatoes regularly for the past 3 years. Thanks!

This was very good and oh-so-simple.  I used a combination of sweet potatoes and reds.  I also used a dill flavored olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I think the cooking time is a bit off.  I cut my potatoes about 1/4 inch thick so my cooking time was only about 25 minutes.  Served these with the Beef Tenderloin with Roasted shallots - nice complement!

Hands down the very best side dish I've ever made.  I made this for 4 servings, so I used two good sized sweet potatoes, 1 packet of soup mix, and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  I made a packet out of foil with everything inside and baked for about 45 minutes.  Simply amazing.  So good I could cry!

I thought that this recipe turned out very well, and it is something I will make again. The only change I made was lining the baking sheet with foil (easy clean-up and the potatoes didn't stick). Next time, I would probably broil the potatoes the last 5-7 minutes to make them more crispy. Otherwise, I really liked this recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. For those having issues with burnt onion flakes cover loosely with aluminum foil halfway through. Cooking times will vary depending on the size of your chunks, test with fork until desired doneness.

My fiance and I loved this dish.  I used only one packet of the onion soup mix because that's all I had on hand.  (I don't think I would have liked it as well with the two packets it calls for . . . it would have been too salty and oniony.)  The sweet potatoes carmelized and the onions soup mix gave it a savory flavor that complimented the sweet potatoes.  Try it, you'll like it!

Great recipe!  I stuck with the directions and it was great but will try some fun additions next time.  Maybe some thin sliced onions to add or some garlic/rosemary for fun.... and of course drizzle with butter at the end!  I made two large s.potatoes and it fed about 4 nice servings!  THEY DO SHRINK THOUGH... so it will make less than it looks like when it's raw so keep that in mind when you decide how many potatoes to cut up.  Great change though from the traditional sweet with brown sugar.

Yummy!  We make sweet potatoes at home all the time, but we bake them.  This was fantastic!  Since there is only 2 of us, I had to scale it down a bit.  I used 2 potatoes, drizzled them with EVOO and only used 3 tablespoons of the dry onion soup mix.  I set the oven to 400 and roasted for only 20 to 30 minutes, stirring twice.  DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe exactly as written with no changes or substitutions.  This is by far one of the best 10 recipes I have obtained from AllRecipes.com since this website went up on the Internet!  This dish is TRULY a dream for a cook!  Minimal work, inexpensive to make, and absolutely delicious.  My niece told me she didn't like sweet potatoes and even she loved them.  I recommend changing the terminology of the recipe to "cubed" sweet potatoes.  There is a difference between diced and cubed.  Thankfully, I didn't dice the sweet potatoes; they would have been way-over-cooked.  I cubed them (which, with the hardness of sweet potatotes, - that is certainly the most difficult part of the recipe).  GREAT RECIPE!  You can't screw this up!

Great recipe for my family. As always, I'm always trying to make it low fat so I used the fat free olive oil pam spray and sprayed the sweet potatoes before coating them in the mixture. Very tasty!

FANTASTIC! Did not peel the sweet potatoes and I baked at a lower temp for a bit longer. Wonderful! I make a sweet glazed ham with pineapple for Christmas and decided the traditional sweet potatoes were just too much sweet in one meal and replaced them with these. Was not disappointed!

Good but cook time is too long at least at the size I cut my potatoes as they got a bit burned.  I'd probably lower the temp and think like 35-40min

Different, and will probably try different mix of spices made on my own in the future (maybe thyme, salt, pepper?). As per other reviews, baked only at 400 degrees to prevent burningof onion pieces, and also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I stirred up every 10minutes. My husband did not like very much - he didn't think onion went well with sweet potato. Husband also prefers a cripy outside to sweet potato pieces from the oven which I always have difficulty obtaining.

These do not disappoint!  I didn't add the whole soup mix seasoning, instead only added half and the result was great.  Aso I didn't use as much oil as the recipe stated, only a couple of tablespoons to 3 potatoes. The potatoes have great flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

Made this for a family dinner and it rocks.  I didn't have onion soup mix, but made my own soup mix from scratch (you can get the recipe online).  Also added fresh sliced sweet onion and used grape seed oil.  A great change from "sweet" sweet potato dishes.

I combined yams, sweet pototoes & white pototoes & parboiled them until the water just boiled. Combined the onion mix with the oil & then mixed it all together & roasted. The dish was a hit. Thank you.  I might try it with root vegetables next time.

I made these as fries with olive oil - one batch at 350 another at 400.  My guests loved them!  The ones at 400 turned out better.  I had to micro the potatoes for a minute so I could push them through the slicer.  Baked them around 30 minutes.  A packet of seasoning to 3 potatoes is about right.  I would recommend flipping them every 10 minutes to keep them from sticking.  I thought they were yummy with ranch dressing!

DELISH.  For caramelization, add 2 T lightly packed brown sugar.  I used olive oil, 1/2 onion soup packet and cooked for 40 minutes.  Don't stir.

These were ok in my opinion. Definitly stir them up a couple times while cooking because I had trouble with them sticking to the pan. Greasing the pan REALLY well is also another option. My guests didn't complain and several them actually said they were very good. I ate them and they are definitly different from most sweet potatoe recipes.

Excellent flavor! Cooked at 400 for 40 min and stirred once while baking per other suggestions, and they came  out golden and caramelized. I made my own dry onion soup mix (1once= 8Tbls dried onion flakes, 4 tea bouillon granules, 1 tea onion or garlic powder, 1/4 tea seasoned pepper). Also, I substituted half of the sweet potatoes with cauliflower, and I had some green scallions from my garden that I chopped and added to the mixture before baking. This gave a nice contrast of color and texture. Fair warning: Don't make this if you are worried about onion breath :)...at least not the way I did it

I didn't have onion mix on hand so I diced up actual onion and tossed that with the sweet potatoes. Turned out great! I did add a tablespoon of maple syrup at the end because I just couldn't resist!

I did a little tweaking and it came out perfect!  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and I microwaved the diced potatoes first to cut down on cooking time.  I baked at 375 for 30 minutes and they are perfect and no burnt onion pieces.  I also caramelized an onion while the potatoes were in the oven and when I pulled them out, stirred the caramelized onion into the finished potatoes... soooo yummy!

Awesome! Used olive oil instead of veggie oil, and soaked the onion dip in it for about an hour ahead of time. Baked at 400 degrees for 35 mins. Perfectly tener, nothing burned, was delicious! Game day favorite now!

450 is way too hot for this.  The onions burned before the potatoes began to cook.  Next time will put the oven on 350 and see what happens.

I just made these tonight and they're delish! I cut my potatoes in to 1" cubes and it only took about 35 minutes at 400. I used 1 package of soup mix because that's all I had and only used about 1/4 cup of olive oil. Next time I'm going to try this with a home made soup mix.

A fantastic way to do sweet potatoes. I did keep the soup mix to a minimum. I used about half of what the recipe called for and used olive oil.

I found this dish pretty bland. But, then again, I really like sweet potatoes w/brown sugar so maybe this was just the wrong flavor combination for my taste.

I made this recipe for our large family last year at Thanksgiving.  I have never liked sweet potatoes, mostly because my Mom always made the marshmallow, overly sweet ones.  After making this recipe, to my surprise, I do like sweet potatoes.  My sister, the true lover of sweet potatoes, proclaimed them "the best she ever ate".  So while I plan my 2011 Thanksgiving dinner menu, I had to revisit this recipe and . . . give THANKS.  Happy Thanksgiving and God Bless!

I've made these for Thanksgiving for the last 3 years. (I don't like the super sweet candied yams. ICK!) This is a very easy recipe and very tasty! The sweet from the potatoes and the savory from the onion soup mix go really well together.

Added some garlic powder and pepper. Put it on 425 for 40 mins(top rack) And you got yourself an outstanding side dish!:)

I loved the idea.  It's a great idea to use soup mix of one kind or another for a different flavor.  
What I do to prevent the onion bits from burning, is pre-steam the sweet potatos but not all the way through.  Just enough that the cooking time is cut down, then cut them up and mix them and bake them...  Yay...  It's awesome.

Yummy! To avoid the burned onion soup mix taste, I precooked the sweet potatoes with the skin on and pierced for 7 minutes in the microwave. I then followed the rest of the recipe as directed and baked them for only 30 minutes.

The flavor of these is outstanding, BUT 40 to 50 minutes of baking time is way too long. If the sweet potatoes are "diced," they will probably be done in 10 to 15 minutes. I checked mine at 20 min., and they were already burned. Also, I recommend greasing the pan, even though the potatoes themselves are oiled. Then again, if you stir the potatoes a few times during baking, they would be less prone to sticking to the pan.

This now makes a regular appearance on my dinner table.  Doesn't need the full cooking time, and turning down the heat helps to prevent the onions from burning.  Thanks!

Excellent dish.  Took the advice of one rater.  Put all ingredients in a gallon plastic bag, sealed it and let it sit until ready for use..  The onions become soft and did not burn. Also, I cooked at 350 degrees and it worked out fine.

Great recipe!  We love it!  I have made them 3 times in the last two weeks...only change is I cook them in microwave for 3 minutes and then marinate them in the onion soup/evoo for a few hours before baking!  Thank you Jessica!  Sweet potatoes are very good for you!

My brother proclaimed, "I don't even eat yams and I can't stop eating these!", so that should speak for how delicious these were!  I followed the recipe verbatim, just chopping half a small onion and throwing into the baking dish with the potatoes and mix.  Thanks! =)

Waaaaay too salty, overwhelming "onion mix" flavor.  I am going right back to slicing my sweet potatoes, mixing them with olive oil, sea salt and black pepper and cooking for about 40 minutes on 400.  Much tastier and much more of the potato taste than this recipe offers.

Delicious! I love sweet potatoes and am always looking for different recipes. I have prepared this one many times using gold potatoes (it's on the Lipton Onion Soup box) but never thought about using sweet potatoes! I substituted olive oil as suggested, used one envelope of the onion soup with 2 large sweet potatoes, and also added 2T. brown sugar for carmelization. The potatoes were done in 30 minutes, actually a bit overdone even cooking at 400 degrees. Suggest checking at 25 - 30 minutes. This was great, easy and definitely worth making it again.

My husband loves sweet potatoes, but I hate  them and have been searching for a recipe to make them palatable to me.  This is it! I ate every last bite. This yields a savory  flavor combination of sweet and salty.  I only had to bake them for 30 minutes.

It was edible but I will not make again.  It had a salty/processed/chemical flavor. I did cook at a lower temp.  Just didn't care for it.  Maybe too much onion packet.

Great alternate sweet potato recipe. The flavor is good - make sure to take the advice of previous reviewers; lower the oven temp or they will burn quickly.

I, like others, mixed with russet potato.  I had one of each.  I used a glass 9x13-inch pan.  It worked beautifully.  There were no burnt onions or anything.  I also greased the pan with a olive oil spray. Baked at 425 degrees and it took only about 30 minutes.  I had it cooking along with 4 chicken legs and 4 thighs.  Just put the potatoes in 10 minutes after the chicken.  I stirred the potato/onion mixture 3 times during the cooking process.  I did use the whole packet of onion mix (Lipton's) and it was fine and we didn't feel it was too much even with just these two potatoes and one medium onion.  Will definitely make again.  I also like the health benefits that sweet potatoes provide.

I have made this recipe a few times and our family really enjoys it.  My husband is not a big sweet potato fan but likes this.  I didn't use two packages of the soup mix but I might try two next time.  Also, I cut down on the vegetable oil - for us it was just too much.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

At the last minute on Thanksgiving, I ran to the store for sweet potatoes and made this.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  What a great quick, delicious side dish! I used 4 lbs of sweet potatoes but didn't change the amount of soup mix or oil and they were perfect.

Made it for another side last night for family Thanksgiving (Canadian) and they all loved it - nice change from the casserole I usually make.  Added 1 quartered onion and a few strips of red bell pepper for colour and extra flavour.  Had no trouble with anything burning because I had it in the oven on the top shelf above the turkey, so it was really long and slow, just stirred it all up once in a while.

Very good recipe if you like sweet potatoes. However, I added bacon bits to mine before baking. You wouldn't expect the onion and salt taste to combine so nicely with the sweetness. I will definitely be making this again!

Great Change. Read some of the reviews and did use olive oil, just one package of soup mix, added a small diced fresh onion along with garlic powder and fresh ground pepper, baked at 450 for 20 min and lowered it to 400 for another 20-22 min. Thanks for the recipe and helpful reviews!

Good lord. When I serve this, you would think that it's the last meal everyone is going to eat! It disappears super quickly. Even the picky teens love it. Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I tried this with a combination of sweet potatoes and white potatoes and it was far better with the sweet potatoes.

Also works great on carrots, white potatoes and cauliflower; my favorite is a mix of all of the above.

Very tasty alternative to sweet potatoes.  I did pull them out of the oven at 30-minutes and kept picking at them while the rest of the meal cooked. I had to force myself to leave some for dinner :).  Thank you for a great recipe!

I just made and served this for supper - I reduced the recipe to make just one sweet potato and I love it! You still get the sweet of the potatoes, but with the savoury of the onion soup mix - delicious. My soup mix was a Knorr Lipton Onion Roasted Garlic. 
My only note is that my potatoes were just a smidgen over done at 30 minutes so if you make this, make sure you check them at the 20 to 25 mark.

This is an easy, yummy recipe! I added a dash of chipotle pepper and garlic powder as we like a bit of 'zip'.  I would have given it the extra star, except I followed the baking instructions for 450F - set my timer for 40 mins to be on the cautious side and burned nearly all of it.  What wasn't burnt was very tasty!  Will definitely try this again.

Not too bad...definitely will reduce the amount of oil next time (I used EVOO) and cut the baking time to 30 minutes. Will make again - was really easy.

Delicious! Although I highly recommend cooking for 30 minutes and checking them from there. I did 40 minutes at 450 degrees and they burned. Make sure you don't make the diced pieces too small!

A nice twist on the traditional cinnamon flavored sweet potatoes. I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and kept the oven at 375. Keep an eye on it and make adjustments on time and temp as needed (40-50 minutes is way too long). Don't forget to flip your potatoes half way through and you'll have a delicious side dish.

Excellent alternative to candied sweet potatoes.  I added string beans, as one reviewer suggested, and it really provided an incredible blend! I thought I had onions onhand, but I was WRONG! I added the crispy fried onion toppers and it provided an incredilble crunch! I only used 1 package of onion mix to make it healthier (theres ALOT of sodium in those mixes- one was just fine). Baked at 450 covered for 15 minutes, then lowered to 350 uncovered bc I was cooking a turkey meatloaf.  After a total of 35 minutes, they were done. Thanks for this great easy recipe! Will be using in the future !

Delicious and my husband loved them too! I followed the recipe exactly. The trick to getting them done properly without burning the onion bits is to make sure that you have diced the potatoes small enough so that they can cook quickly...I diced mine just a shade bigger than frozen hash browns.  Also, olive oil has a lower smoking point than vegetable oil, so if you use olive oil your dish will burn faster than if you use canola or another vegetable oil. I also stirred them twice during the cooking process. My husband said it was all he could do to save some for me, since I made them ahead and he got home first!

I sliced the sweet potatoes very thin and ended up charring some of them a bit.  This recipe isn't awful, but I would have preferred just salt, pepper, and evoo, and a slightly thicker sweet potato.

I really liked this! It's nice to have sweet potatoes without brown sugar. The kids really liked them also, my husband not so much but he doesn't really like sweet potatoes to begin with. I also lowered the oven temp to 400 and stired the potatoes a few times, the 1st time I made these the onions from the soup mix burned a little over 20 minutes into the cooking and had to he thrown in the trash.

Wow, these were really good.  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and only baked for 35 minutes at 400...it really just depends on how large your pieces are...  Hubby can't wait to have these again.

Unfortunately I cut the pieces too small and ended up burning my first batch. Once they were bigger it all came out beautifully. Great alternative for regular potatoes.

These were so delicious. They tasted great and I can't believe how simple it was to prepare this dish. Everyone enjoyed and thought I did an excellent job....haha,it was so simple. I will be making these again.  They are a nice break from sugary yams or sweet potatoes.

I was so thrilled with this recipe! It was such a celebration of fall flavor on my Thanksgiving table! The roasted sweetness of the potatoes combined with the crunchy, savory bits of onion were delicious and really heightened the sweet flavor of the potatoes rather than hide it with sugary marshmallows. This was a hit! I also roasted some brussels sprouts and just did both at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.   I used 4 medium to large sweet potatoes and 1 packet of onion soup (don't remember the size). They were perfect!

This sounds awesome. I will be making this for Thanksgiving this year. I will use the suggestion to cut the temp down to 400. I also think for those of you that have issues with burning the onions, maybe try cutting the potatoes smaller so they will cook faster and you wont need to cook them for the full amount of time. I love sweet potatoes, but I've never liked the traditional recipes that always add sugar. I never saw the point in adding sugar to something that is already sweet. Guess I just don't have a giant sweet tooth.

This was a great option instead of the southern sweet potatoes I'm used to with loads of butter and brown sugar.  Of course my kids were not as pleased, but we adults liked it well.  I put the potatoes in covered stoneware and cooked in the microwave for 16 minutes.  My oven was taken over by the turkey, so the microwave made a quick alternative.

These are Deeee-licious!! We eat a lot of sweet potatoes and I'm always looking for different ways to fix them.  I cubed a  giant sweet potato.  I put a few tablespoons of olive oil in a food storage bag, added the entire envelope of onion soup mix and then tossed in the potatoes and shook it up until the potatoes were well coated.  I baked at 400 for 30 minutes, stirring them a bit halfway through.  Really, really, really good!!

I am just getting on the Sweet Potato Wagon, but I don't like the T-giving Pies, as they are too sweet -- this is Super Simple and Fantastic-aly Tasty !!   If anyone says "I don't like Sweet Potatoes" then make these... better than Fried Sweet Potato Fries !!!!

This was tasty, but for us it was way too salty (and we even had more sweet potatoes than the recipe called for).  I would make again with half the onion soup mix.

Easy and pleasing.  I made these for a small dinner party I had with Salmon as a main course.  I added a sweet onion and used olive oil instead of vege.  Turned out wonderful and I received many compliments on this exquisite yet easy to make side!

Sounds good.  To prevent burning, I'd turn the heat down to 425 and cover it for 1st 30 min or so.  Saw that on another recipe here and it worked good.

I made these for Thanksgiving for my fiancee.  He hates onions, but he LOVED this recipe.  He kept saying that this recipe is a keeper and how good they were.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I cooked the potatos at a lower temp because they needed to share the oven with the green bean casserole and turkey.  However, I did brush them with a small bit of olive oil and turned the oven temp up to 425 at the end in order to brown them up.  Great recipe!

I made these for thanksgiving.  Very easy and almost no prep time.  I just peeled, diced and threw the pieces in a gallon baggie with the onion soup mix and the olive oil.  I let it sit for a few hours and marinate and then used a foil lined 9x13 casserole dish.  I changed the temp to 350 degrees and baked for about 50-60 min (until tender -  I used a toothpick to test if it was inserted with low resistance).  Everyone loved these!  I will definitely make these again.  We got a box of sweet potatoes/yams from Costco along with the Lipton onion soup mix and they worked great with this recipe.

I really only made these so I'd have two potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner - I'm kinda tired of the overly sweet br. sugar/pecan recipe----they kind of take away from the pies!  Well - now I have a new sweet potatoe to make year round!!  These are just fantastic! I cut mine in round slices about 1/2" or so thick - dunked them in a small bowl of olive oil and made sure they were totally covered - then dunked them in a small bowl of onion soup mix - put them in a casserole dish and baked. I didn't use a cookie sheet because I didn't have the room in my oven with all the other food. My family loved them - didn't miss their old favorite sweet potatoes at all.  They plan to try them  - and cut them thinner and place on a cookie sheet  - more french fry type.  LOVE THOSE SIMPLE & HEALTHY RECIPES!! Bless you Jessica

My family loved these. I was looking for a sweet potato side dish that was savory rather than the typical marshmallow topped.   Based on other revewiers suggestions I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked them for about 30 minutes.  A definite "do again" recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made it for dinner one night for a good friend and mysef. I followed the recipe exactly and we ended up eating the whole pan of them! so delicious. The only thing I did differently was i baked them in a lage baking pan, and cooked at 375 instead of 450 ( i was making game hens at the same time). turned out amazing. will be making alot!

Great as written we really enjoyed.  Last time I added 2 Tbs of brown sugar to the recipe double wrapped in foil and cooked on top rack of BBQ until tender about 40 minutes.  Should work in oven too.  Virtually no clean up and very very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe

Without question, one of my favorite sweet potato preparations!  I don't care how traditional the marshmallow mess is, I can't deal:)  I find that the soup mix does crisp quite a bit, but I like the texture.  Can also be avoided by taking extra care during the mixing step.

Scrumptious!!! The whole family loved this and it was easy!  I cooked it part way in the microwave because I didn't have enough time for it to stay in the oven for an hour, I popped it in the oven for about 15 min when the micro was done and it crisped up wonderfully.  Thank you, I never in a million years would have thought to put onion soup & sweet potato together.... YUM!

They smell really good while cooking in the oven.  I also found that they only took 20 minutes with the oven on 400F.  I have just tasted one, seem like it will be a good side dish.  So easy to make!

I thought these were really good.  I used a packet of Good Seasons Zesty Italian Dressing and 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder instead of the onion soup mix.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I baked them on a silicone baking mat for almost an hour, stirring a few times.  They were a little crispy on the outside and soggy in the middle (which was expected).

Very easy and tasty.  I soaked the soup mix in the oil (extra virgin olive oil) for several hours while I was preparing Thanksgiving meal.  I had to do something when I prepped the potatoes too early, so I poured the soup/oil mixture on the potatoes and put it all onto the pan I was going to roast them on.  Covered the pan with foil and set aside until it was time to put them into the oven.  I kept them covered with the foil while roasting them.  They turned out very good.  There was no problem with the onions being dry or burnt.  The sweet/savory flavor works!

I would actually give this a 3.5 stars - it was slightly better than good but not quite "great." One little problem - the dried onions that come in the onion soup mix were still pretty hard though the potatoes were soft. Since I stired the dry soup mix with the oil and let sit in a bowl while I cubed potatoes - they had opportunity to soften but didn't.  I also cooked in a 9x13 dish covered in foil so I don't think its that they dried out either.  So every now and then - we'd get a bite of a "dry onion flake."  I might try again because I'm combing two favorite ingredients: sweet potatoes and dry onion soup mix - perhaps I'll let sit longer in the oil mix?  Perhaps add some addition chopped veggies (brocoli/carrots/mushrooms?) We'll see...thanks Jessica.

Delish! I mixed in a few regular potatoes, but next time I'll go just with sweet potatoes. I used olive oil and tossed in cut up onion. My husband loved these and my daughter said they were good! I will make this easy recipe again.

Delicious and so easy to do.

I did cut down the amount of time to about 30 minutes, since I had cut my sweet potatoes into smaller bites, and also turn the oven to 400 F.

This was great. I goofed and diced the potatoes pretty small so they ended up getting done much faster (which may be a good thing - it cut the cooking time by about 15 minutes), but the next time I'll try to get them closer to the picture. And there WILL be a next time!

I've always said I did not like sweet potatoes (probably because I had only tried them 'candied' in the past).  This recipe has totally changed my mind - prepared like this they're great. Thanks for a great recipe!

I only used one pouch of onion soup mix and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't have any trouble with the onion flakes burning either.  I cooked it in the toaster oven for about 20 minutes!

I like the concept, but I thought this dish was way too salty. I made half a recipe and turned the oven on 400. I noticed the browning getting pronounced about 20 min. into cooking and turned down the heat to 300 for the last 10 min. I've had the version with white potatoes and thought it was good--I don't know why this tasted so salty.

Be careful.  Mine started to burn after 10 minutes in the oven.  Potatoes were soft after 15 minutes.  Think 450 is too hot and 55 minutes too long for this recipe.

This recipe is a keeper!  And this comes from a family who thought they would never enjoy sweet potatoes.  This is a great, savory alternative to the more common ultra-sweet recipes.  Friends have already made this dish at their home after enjoying it at ours. Try it!

I loved the sweet potatoes because they weren't smothered in brown sugar or syrup. My adult family also loved them and I had to give out the recipe a few times. The recipe was very easy with only 3 ingredients.

Was looking for a sweet potato recipe to go with steak, tried this one and it was great!  Will definitely make these again. Just keep an eye on the little onions so they don't burn, toss them every now and then.

I was looking for a sweet potato dish that didn't rely on a lot of sweetness, but I wasn't impressed with this recipe. It lacked flavor and the sweet potatoes were overcooked. I won't be making this again.

I absolutely love this savory-sweet sweet potato recipe over the crazy sweet marshmallow and pineapple versions.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It is the simplest of all my sides and all my guests rave about it every Thanksgiving.  I plan to make more than the scaled to guest serving suggestion next year. I never have any left overs and my family wants them!

I think this is fantastic.  The only change I will make to it is to reduce the amount of oil.  My husband who was not sure about it absolutely loved it.

Great dish! After reading the reviews I used a a gallon zip lock and put the oil and dried soup mix in it for about a half hour to soften the onions then added the potatoes and a little kosher salt and let that marinade for another half hour. Emptied the bag onto a cookie sheet put them in the oven at 350 for 1 about an hour. Perfect! Even my 2 teenage grandsons loved them.

Great alternative to overly sweet potatoes! I did use 1/4 cup olive oil instead of the recommended 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, though. Delish!!

I followed the suggestions of a few others. I let the soup mix soak in the oil for at least 30 minutes. I also covered the potatoes and baked them at 450°F for 20 covered. Uncovered and stirred every 10 minutes for the next 20 minutes. They were soft and not burnt. I probably could have done 15 covered and 25 uncovered for a crispier skin. Overall, nice flavour.

Only the person who doesn't like sweet potatoes no  matter how they are prepared did not like this recipe. So, that means 3/4 of us did! We usually prep as directed, but we use olive oil & add steamed chicken breasts or tenderloins also coated with the onion soup mixture. Because the chicken is already cooked through, the baking time doesn't increase beyond an hour at 400.

I like this recipe, but my boyfriend never leaves well enough alone...We now chop an onion into 1/2-1" pieces and add mushrooms-either sliced or quartered to make a nice side dish.  I'm also roasting them with chicken and a 1/2 cup of chicken stock to make the mixing easier.

I don't like sweet potatoes, but I thought this was delicious!  My family (except one picky guy) agreed.  Only cooked for about 30 minutes after reading others' reviews - burnt the smaller cubes.  =O  I'll be making this again!

I make this dish for Thanksgiving each year in the morning. When it is 3/4 of the way done, I place the potatoes in my crockpot to free up oven space and time for other preparations.  They are always a big hit and a nice change from the ooey-gooey marshmallow, brown sugar and cinnamon version.  I also try to find real sweet potatoes ( yellow) and not the orange yams that most grocery stores carry.  I use only enough olive oil to coat them and only one package of onion soup mix.  Sweet and savory !

Could use 1/2 the onion soup mix. My son liked it as is. Adjusted recipe for 1 3/4 pounds of sweet potatoes. Diced the potato to about 3/4 inch chunks. Arranged in glass rectangular dish. I followed Brook's suggestion and covered with the dish tin foil and baked at 325. I was surprised it was done in an hour.

Nice twist on regular baked sweet potato, unfortunately the little onion bits burned before the potatoes were tender.

I had a couple of sweet potatoes in my pantry that I needed to use.  I was looking for a "not so sweet" way to cook them.  This was really good - we just kept picking at the pan like it was popcorn! I cut back on the onion soup mix somewhat as we are trying to cut back on the salt.  I will definitely make this again.

Really delicious, easy side dish. I do this with regular potatoes to rave reviews also. I baked the potatoes at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes and they were perfect.

Everyone LOVED it! Typically, we have the sweet version of sweet potatoes (either the canned baked with marshmallows and brown sugar or slightly friend with corn flakes). I wanted to do something different. I used 4 sweet potatoes and 1 pack of soup mix (because that is what I had) and it turned out great. Great flavor, soft sweet potatoes (baked at 400 for about an hour).

Yum Yum Yum!!!  These were incredibly tasty.  I mixed the oil and soup mix in a large freezer bag and tossed the potatoes in the bag until well coated.  I spread them out over two cookie pans.  I flipped them every 15 minutes or so.  After about 30 minutes there was some burning of the onions.  I reduced the heat for the remaining 15 minutes.  If the onions didn't burn, I would have rated this a 5!  Regardless, I will be making these again... and again... and again!!!

This was delicious. I made a 1/2 recipe and cooked it at 425 for about 15 minutes before it started burning. The potatoes were plenty soft. Perhaps I diced them too small.

Wow, are these potatoes good!!  I didn't have time to bake these in the oven, so I cooked my potatoes in the micro and then cut them into cubes.  I sprinkled some onion soup mix atop the lightly oiled cubes and put the potatoes in a lightly oiled pan on the stove to carmelize and brown.  My husband and I couldn't believe just how good this turned out.  The mix almost seemed to enhance the sweetness of the sweet potato, and the added saltiness was a welcome surprise.  We will definitely be making this again!

The onion overpowered the sweet potatoes to me. I would rather just toss them in olive oil & maybe a little rosemary for a lighter taste.

I really loved the taste and texture of these. And I always love a recipe that hardly requires any work at all. I was a bit disappointed that some of my potatoes burned at 30 minutes into cooking. Most of them made it out okay, and they were wonderful. I will be making this again.

My husband is not fond of sweet potatoes, I love the traditional version. We both absolutely loved these. Our children loved them too and they are terribly picky. My little brother was over for dinner and nobody can get that man to eat his veggies...He loved them...Notice a pattern here. I changed the temp to 400 and baked for 40 min as was mentioned buy another reviewer. They were perfect, soft and flavorful... I am adding this to my monthly recipe book...

MMM so yummy!  I love the sweet and savory mix. I was looking for a recipe like this without sugar that I could use more as a side, not a dessert.  Thanks for this, was too easy.   BTW I only cooked for about 25 mins and they were perfect.  No burnt onion pieces.

thanks god for sweet potato recipes that aren't sweetened! i loved this dish, and though there was no added sugar, it still came out sweet. yum.  i cooked mine in a toaster oven and if you do this i would suggest stirring once or twice just to keep the tops from burning.

We loved the taste of these.  I cut back on the onion soup, due to the saltiness, and it was perfect.  You do have to keep an eye on them, I did flip them, and some still burned.  I think the easier way to do this is to roast the sweet potatoes, then make it into a mash with the other ingredients.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it ws the only leftover that I actually looked forward to eating. 2 weeks later I was hankering for it again so I made it last night. My boyfriend and 8 year old daughter were literally fighting over the bowl of them, that's how much they love this recipe. This is especially noteworthy because my boyfriend previously claimed to dislike sweet potatoes. Easy and healthy! Thanks!

We always want to have sweet potato at our thanksgiving table and were stock with the same old "casserole" wich is always too sweet and muchy for our taste.  this thanks giving I used this recipe and it was the biggest hit at the table after the turkey. everyone loved it. it makes a very tasty and much healthier side , that in my opinion could even replace french fries .

Made for Thanksgiving meal and it was a pleasant change from the sweet versions we've all grown up with!  It went well with the other flavors of our Thanksgiving plates.  Thank you for posting this!  Will use again.

I have spent my whole life saying I hate sweet potatoes, this recipe made me a convert! SO good! The cook time does seem to be off though, mine just started to burn at around 20 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

A very good alternative to the sweet recipes for sweet potatoes. Thought the dry onion soup mix was a bit strong so may use a little less next time & substitute a little onion powder or other seasoning. Also added black pepper. Way I prepared to hasten timing: Precooked the potatoes in the Microwave on Hight for 5 minutes. Then mixed & cooked in oven only 20 minutes. This way should solve the complaints of some that the onions were too crisp or burned. Husband liked better than the sweet recipes.

I am always looking for savory sweet potato recipes.  This one looked promising.  I tried it twice.  The first time I thought the onion soup mix was a little overwhelming so on the 2nd try I cut it in half.  It still seemed a little overwhelming.  Maybe this one just isn't for me.

I found these alright.  It's a good base but overall I found the flavor a little bland.  I used a mixture of olive oil and canola.  Had issues with potatoes sticking for some reason.  I also added an onion and cooked at 400 to reduce charing of onion pieces which were two great suggestions by others.    I'll try this one again but will likely add some rosemary, garlic powder, Kosher salt, a bit of pepper or maybe just less potatoes as I think the onion mixture didn't add the kind of flavor I was looking for.  Happy Cooking!

Every year my mom brings me a case of Louisiana sweet potatoes and I end up giving so many of them away bc I do not eat anything covered in so much butter and sugar. my husband does, so he turned his nose up to these but WOW!  we both love them.  If you've never likes sweet potatoes before, give this a try!  (this recipe doesn't work with white potatoes or red potatoes)

These potatoes were very good! Be advised, I did a large dice on mine, and they were soft and ready to come out of the oven in just 15 minutes. Like others, I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.

This was a good recipe, and I will repeat it, but I really should have read more of the reviews.  45 - 50 minutes is far too long and they ended up rather dark and crunchy.

My mother-in-law wants this recipe!  I tried to make this before and found I didn't have the soup mix.  So better prepared, I made this last night and it was a hit.  I added sliced vidalia onions and used canola oil.  Thank you for sharing.

These are so good and easy to make. I adjusted the temperature slightly to 400 and just cooked them a little longer. At 450 the corners were browning too quickly.

I honestly have never had a "sweet" sweet potato dish.  These beauties are way to good to throw sugar on.  I've never done the onion soup method so I added 1/2 of one packet along with olive oil and parsley.  The cooking time was only 30 minutes.  Loved it!

I think maybe the oven temp. it's right in this recipe or maybe it was just my oven but these got burnt around the edges after only cooking for 30 mins. I will definately make these again because we've made golden potatoes like this and they were fabulous so I assume with a little temp. and time adjustment these will be great as well.

Awesome!  My husband turned up his nose at first, then I persuaded him to at least take a bite - he ate almost all of them, leaving very little for me!

These were good, but I thought the soup mix gave them a rather artificial taste.  They reminded me of the flavor on store bought onion potato chips.  My guest really loved them though.

Nice looking and tasty.  I personally prefer my sweet potatoes served sweet so I only gave it 4 stars.  But, my husband, whom normally doesn't eat sweet potatoes, liked them prepared this way.

These were good but I thought they did need a little more flavor then just the packet alone. I also didn't use 1/3 cup oil or near it, 2 Tbsp. was all I needed.

The recipe has to be wrong!! I prepared exactly as recipe directed and had very badly burnt onions at the end of 35 minutes. It would have been worse if I hadn't opened the oven and checked after 30 minutes. 450deg is much too high. If I ever try this again I will lower temperature to at least 400 deg and reduce cooking time a little. I will try 375Deg for 40 min. the next time as a start.

The temperature in this recipe needs to be lowered and or the time shortened. I followed the recipe exactly and after 50 minutes half of the potatoes were burnt. They were still good, but we had to pick them up with our fingers and eat around the burnt parts. Watch carefully while cooking!

So UMMM and so easy!!  I decided to make this the other night along with cutting up a few yukon gold potatoes, since I do not like sweet potatoes.  What great surprise as I actually liked the sweet potatoes more than the yukon gold.  Everyone raved on how good they were.  I had made a lot so the next night I placed them in the oven again on broil and they were just as good as the first night.

I only had beefy dry onion mix and I realized it after I started makig it!  I thought the worst would be that it was a strange combo but it was really good!!  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I will be making this again!

I can't really rate this recipe since I haven't tried it yet, but I've often made it with white potatoes, and it's one of my husband's favorites.  I will definitely give this a try.  Should be great!

Nice twist on a classic favorite.  May try with a little cayenne next time for a surprise kick.

The 10yo ate piles and piles of this.  I found the onion soup mix a bit off-putting, but that's because it tastes like a mix.  A great easy way to serve sweet potatoes.  And it doesn't take so long to make them if you cut them smaller and put on the top rack.  I had to turn it down because they cooked too fast.

Very good I used 2 white potatoes and 3 sweet potatoes and I added 1 diced onion. Much better than I expected. Next time I may add a little less oil just to make it healthier. I really recommend this it's mmm mmmm tasty!

Very good!  Tastes like regular potatoes.  A nice change from the usual super-sweet sweet potatoes.

My fiancee and I loved this dish. It's definitely a change from the cinnamon taste that usually goes along with Sweet Potatoes. I used the onion mix, but I also added some sauteed onions. I substituted veg. oil with olive oil.

The powder/dried onion didn't come out well. Made me wish I had just cut up a fresh onion instead.

These were delicious!  I cut my potatoes into much smaller chunks so I only had to leave them in the over for about 20-25 minutes.  These taste great and were so simple, I will definitely make them again.

This was my first time trying to cook sweet potatoes b/c I didn't like them as a kid.  These are great but a little salty.  Next time I'll reduce the onion soup mix a little.

These potatoes were exactly what I was looking for. I have a 3 year old and he has become very picky. This is something new that he just loves. I cut the sweet potatoes to look like french fries instead of dicing them. Turned out great.

This is an excellent side dish -- especially with something like pork tenderloin. I only gave it 4 stars because my husband didn't care for it at all. But I loved it!

They were good, but the stuck to the bottom of the pan even after I greased it.  They weren't anything special.  I'd probally make them again.

This is the first time a five star recipe didn't work for me.  The potatoes BURNED TO A CRIPS in just 30 minutes!
