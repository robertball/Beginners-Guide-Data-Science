Modified this based on what I had in the house and it turned out great! I didn't have any picante sauce, so I used half a can of southwest tomatoes (diced tomatoes, green chilies, lime and cilantro), fat free sour cream, dry ranch seasoning and a couple packets each of Taco Bell chipotle sauce and fire sauce.

This dressing is amazing!! I used fat free sour cream and light ranch with taco sauce instead of Picante sauce. This was delicious and only counted up to 64 calories with a tsp of milk to thin it down a little. Thanks so much for this great recipe

Found this a bit bland, so will add Sriracha sauce next time.  On the other hand, a good dipping sauce without a strong onion after taste was a good change.  Once doctored with added Russian dressing and Sriracha ace it was a great salad dressing OR chip dip.

Delicious dressing - that will be made again!  It worked well served over 'Lazy Katie's Taco Salad' from AR.  I had homemade ranch dressing that I used in the recipe.  I mixed everything up in the morning and gave it a quick stir before serving.  My hubby and I both enjoyed this.  Thanks, Emily for sharing.

Made this dressing to go on my husband's taco salad that he took to work...he loved it.  In fact, he called me right after he ate to say how much he enjoyed the salad, and he specifically mentioned that the dressing was the best part.  Thanks for the quick, tasty recipe!

My go-to taco salad dressing! Thanks, Emily. I just vary the picante sauce to salsa sometimes based on what's in the fridge.

I felt like the addition of the sour cream made the dressing rather bland. I usually just use ranch dressing and salsa on my taco salad, which I feel has more flavor. Some people really liked  Emily's dressing, so give it a try for yourself.

Don't usually have dressing on our taco salad, but decided to give this a try on the recommendation of a friend.  Instead of picante sauce, I used a salsa with white beans and corn that I had on hand.  Hubs liked this a lot so 'm thinking it will be a regular addition to our taco salads from now on.  Thanks Weegie for your suggestion.  :)

This was okay.  Had to doctor a bit to fit our tastes, and we like spicy.  I appreciate the base being sour cream.  Thank you.

This was really good.  I left out the chili powder because I didn't feel that it needed it with the picante sauce.  Everyone loved it!  Served with taco salads in a bowl, with a choice of taco meat or fiesta chicken.  Was equally good on both!

Just made this for the kids to put on their taco salads tonight. I used reduced fat sour cream, mild pace picante and home made ranch. Its really good. To kick it up for my husband later I will add some rooster sauce.

I’ve always thought taco salad needed some dressing on it other than salsa. This recipe is GREAT! Very simple to make and we all loved  it, including my picky eater gentleman friend! Thanks for this one!

I was looking for a dressing for our Taco Salad and came across this one. I didn’t have picante sauce but I starined some of the juice off my salsa which worked just fine. Thanks for a versatile recipe.

I never know what kind of dressing to use for taco salad. This was great. I omitted the chili powder. I was concerned the sour cream would make it too heavy, but the ranch really helped the texture, making it like a creamy salsa ranch. My 8 year old thought it would make a great dip for tortilla chips.

Really good !  We used Tostito's chunky salsa, it doesn't water down the dressing.  Poured it over our taco salads for dinner tonight, it was the best yet.

Fabulous.  Often I'll check out how others may have adjusted the recipe and I might incorporate some of their suggestions but I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out wonderful.   It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it.

I didn't have any ranch dressing as I make all my own so used an organic all natural mayo and olive oil with sour cream, then just added hot sauce and my own taco seasoning, turned out delicious and much healthier too :-)

Had no piquant sauce so I found a recipe for one online that was fairly basic and modified it to use Cajun seasoning. Turned out quite nice.

This sauce is a fun addition to our taco night.  I didn't have sour cream so I subbed mayo and it was very good.  Next time I will try sour cream but won't hesitate to make it using the mayo again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have picante sauce so used taco sauce and this was delicious! Exactly what I was looking for.

Yummy! I have some picky eaters in my household but the whole family loved this.  Like someone already said, the leftover dressing makes a great dip for nacho chips or veggies later.

This dressing is the best taco salad dressing I have tried. It really tastes great. I highly recommend without making any major changes. I did use light sour cream and light ranch and it still tasted amazing.

I made a Mexican inspired meal today. I was making a salad and wanted a dressing to go with it. This wasn't bad, but for some reason tasted so much like bottled dressing. Only change I made was using low fat dairy and I mixed up some ranch using a packet of ranch powder. I was hoping for something that tasted a little more fresh or had stronger flavors, so not something I would make again. However, it worked fine for tonight. ty

I made this with Costco's mango peach salsa.  It was really yummy.  Nex time I'll add a little red pepper and kick up the heat a bit.  Thanks Emily!
