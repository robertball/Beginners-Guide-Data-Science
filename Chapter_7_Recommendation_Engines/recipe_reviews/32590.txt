The description says it all: Deeeeeelicious!!!! Very quick and easy to make. I found this recipe, and ten minutes later, I'm writing a review and sipping my Orange Jewel! I used unsweetened orange concentrate, 1% milk, and Breyer's double churned vanilla ice cream. It turned out perfectly. The only things that I changed was that I used about 12 ice cubes, because I prefer a thicker drink, and I found that I only needed a tablespoon of sugar, the ice cream and orange concentrate were very sweet to begin with, and I'd rather not have an over-sugary shake. Thanks for sharing!

For a healthy twist on this, replace the milk and half of the water with coconut milk (good for those who are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy), then replace the other half of water with soy French vanilla creamer, then replace the sugar with 1/2 that amount of agave nectar (because it is low-glycemic) and use French vanilla extract in place of regular vanilla. For the ice cream, you can use either soy or coconut yogurt OR soy or coconut ice cream. This may not end up quite as tasty as when it is made with cow breast secretions (milk), but it is still good enough that my kids love it and they are very picky, generally only liking things with lots of refined fats and/or sugars, wheat & dairy (everything that makes people sick).

Delicious although a bit too sweet.  We cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup and it was still a bit too sweet for us.  Perhaps only a tbsp or two for us next time.

pretty good, I didn't add the sugar per the other reviewers and I'm glad I didn't. Next time I might even buy unsweetened orange juice.

Made as is except for vanilla frozen yogurt instead of ice cream.  This is pretty good and very easy. Although it does not need the sugar and I would not use that again.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use 1/4 cup of sugar and used fat free ice cream (even though I really like sweet things!). It was so good and still pretty sweet. Will definitely make this again.

Good taste, although my ice cubes still stayed pretty chunky, so it was more like an icee drink. Not quite what I was looking for.

This was not to my liking, I couldn't even drink the whole thing. Maybe it was the brand of OJ concentrate that I bought that made it taste so bitter?

Delious! The sugur was WAY to much, though. I used only 1 tablespoon of the 1/2 cup it called for, yet it still seemed slightly too sweet. Probably just leave out the sugur all together next time. But great recipe!!!!
Would give 6 stars if could. :) Thanks Kate for the recipe!

Great tasting base! I made substitutions to make it healthier. I used 3 large fresh oranges, 1 cup lowfat milk, 1 1/2 cups nonfat plain yogurt and 2-3 T of agave nectar. The recipe doesn't specify the amount of vanilla extract. I used 1 tsp.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but wanted to provide info about nother ways to make this drink. I used liquid orange juice instead of frozen concentrate and didn't add any sugar. It tasted REALLY yummy.
