I made this for a brunch and it was a hit. I used Italian mixed greens and baby spinach and added mandarin oranges, dried cranberries and sunflower kernels. I chose to serve the dressing separately so I used more pineapple juice & for a pourable consistency.

We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this salad! I used a 20oz. can of pineapple tidbits and eye-balled the cheese. SO YUMMY! It was so refreshing, that I could totally see this as a summer salad staple in my house. This would be excellent with bbq. I will be making this salad A LOT, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent salad. I served this at our lastHawaiian potluck dinner. The salad dressing made the salad. I will serve this again.

Great idea. Served it at a Hawaiian themed party. However, the dressing was too runny and tasted like slaw dressing. It wasn't bad but next time I'll just buy a bottle of slaw dressing.

This was completely delicious! Next time I'll probably add more pineapple cause I only got a few bites with pineapple before it was all gone. Thanks so much Lisa!

The only reason the dressing was too watery for people is they washed the lettuce and didn't let it dry very well to remove extra water.  And using no fat mayonnaise will make things watery too.  This is one of my 3 favorite recipes here on AR!  Serve it with what you know it will go well with in the spring or summertime; chicken, shrimp or anything that goes well complimenting with pineapple.

So sorry for the low rating but the dressing was not for my household. The salad part was good. Thanks for sharing because I may make the salad again but use a different dressing.

I made this salad. It was just ok. The pineapple juice and mayonnaise made the salad greens to soggy for me. My family ate some of it but did not go back for seconds. I had to keep pouring the juice off. We don't really like soggy salad greens. But the taste was different. I will make it again but I will tweak it some. Put the salad greens on the plate then put the rest of the ingredients on top of the greens. That way it won't be so runny and mess up the greens. Blend just a small amount of the pineapple juice and mayo together. Drink the rest of the pineapple juice(lol)Then you are good to go. Thanks.
