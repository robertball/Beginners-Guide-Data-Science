This was so easy compared to normal risotto recipes. The only thing different I did was reduce the amount of  black pepper.  It definitely needed the extra cup of water after baking.  Will definitely make this again.

This was easy to do, & tasted great except for WAY too much pepper. I will make it again , but I will cut the pepper at least in hail(1/2 tsp) or maybe even less you can always ad more at the end.

I got to host a Reynolds Make Meals Magic Party.  This was one of the recipes they sent.  It was fabulous.  I would never have tried it on my own, but we all loved it.

So easy and delicious! My husband and parents loved it. Definitely add extra water when it comes out of the oven.

Excellent dish and so easy! I've never had any success with risotto until now. Definitely putting it in the rotation. I agree with other reviewers who said the black pepper was overpowering. Will reduce it next time.
