My husband and I thought this was delicious.  I had no garlic salt so I used a teaspoon of salt and added a clove of fresh garlic.  Also only 3 lbs of chopped tomatoes.  I took someone's suggestion and only drizzled a teaspoon or so of oil on the top instead of the quarter cup.  Using chilled ingredients helped.  Have already added this to my "frequently used" menus.

I didn't have any garlic salt, so I substituted 2 teaspoons of regular salt and about 2 tablespoons of garlic. I also think I used more basil than the recipe calls for. It was delicious! My roommates loved it so much that they told me I definitely need to make it again!

I had high hopes for this soup, but it did not meet my expectations.  It tasted a little too acidic, and maybe even a little bitter.  Not a do-over.

I was surprised how good this was for limited ingredients and effort. I was looking for a good way to use up the tomatoes and basil in the garden and this was great on a hot summer night with a fresh baguette. FRESH BASIL is a MUST. Don't even bother with this recipe if you don't have it. I also cut back on the oil.

I enjoyed this soup when first made, the next day as leftovers it had turned acidic. It was easy to make, which is always a perk. Next time I want to try it with less oil, not sure it needed that much, and maybe blend in a roasted red pepper just for kicks.  Great use of the last of my tomatos in the garden. Next time will skin and remove the seeds from the tomatos. A good crusty bread to compliment is a must.

This soup is OK. Something is missing though. I'm going to keep searching for a recipe I love.
