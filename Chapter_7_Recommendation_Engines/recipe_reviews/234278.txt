This was my first attempt at making enchiladas and they were great!  Super easy to make and they were a hit!  I will definitely make these again.  I am also guessing that you could make these ahead and freeze for a future meal.  I am actually excited to eat my leftovers at work!

I needed an enchilada recipe that was TASTY, VERY SIMPLE, and different from the other enchiladas I usually make and this was exactly that. I like to serve it with rice and on a bed of shredded lettuce.  It's also good with sour cream and salsa over the top.

Made this exactly as directed with the substitution of taco seasoning as I didn't have fajita seasoning.  The kids loved it.  Served with sour cream, green onions, tomatoes and cilantro.  Was asked to put on dinner rotation!  Absolutely delicious!!

Not sure if old el paso has a mild red enchilada sauce, but I could only find medium, so I added in a small can of tomato sauce to tone it down so my family could eat this.   
The first time I made it as written, it was to spicy for the kids palates, but the adults liked it. 
Both times, I let the cream cheese come to room temperature and mixed it with the enchilada sauce using a hand held blender for a more even flavor and consistency throughout the enchiladas.  I knew chunks of cream cheese would not have been tolerated by the kids....  The overall flavor is good.
 :-)

This recipe is delicious, and I've made it twice, exactly as written, once a complete success and the other a near failure.   The near failure resulted from making it ahead, and refrigerating to pop in the oven later.  After baking, the tortillas could not be pried from the pan and I suspect it was because the tortillas absorbed the enchilada sauce and then burned when baked.  Flavor was still wonderful, and I'm giving it 5 stars because that was an error on my part, but the presentation was lacking. Both times I made the Spanish Rice II, also found on this site, as a side dish.  Outstanding!!

I put the chicken mix in the crock pot for the day to cook - came home and assembled in a casserole dish with the sauce and more cheese - baked for 30 minutes.  Delicious and beautiful on the table!  Used taco seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning because it's what I had - added black beans with the chicken and a can of green chiles for some spice.  Shout out to Selina, my sous-chef who assembled and baked these for us!  :)  The only hitch we had in the dish was forgetting to put sauce in the pan before the tortillas - the bottom layer was baked on pretty hard - still looked and tasted delicious and we will make again!

Awesome! But I used half a jar of mild salsa instead of seasoning mix.  Great flavor.

I used taco seasoning instead of fajita seasoning. Turned out delicious! Forgot the cilantro. Made corn bread muffins to go with it.

I made a lot of changes but this recipe gave me the confidence to make enchiladas for the first time.  I used hatch green enchilada sauce because I like it better with chicken than red sauce and I used corn tortillas because I like them better than flour tortillas.  I had leftover baked chicken so I shredded it instead of buying a rotisserie chicken.  Also, I didn't see the footnote about freezing the cream cheese so I melted it into my green sauce when I couldn't get it to cooperate - ha!  I will definitely make this again!

I didn't have cream cheese, so I used ricotta cheese which was in the fridge. A bog of Frontera red chile enchilada sauce was not as hot as Old Elpaso mild red enchilada sauce and was better suited to my family's taste buds. I will make this again!

I really liked the fajita flavor. Enchilada sauce was too hot for me so I will use a packet mix next time which tends to be more mild. Not sure if it needed more cream cheese or if I used too much chicken as I would have liked it creamier. I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe the only thing I ever change up is adding a little more sauce and switch between red and green enchilada sauce.

It was good.  I added a 4 ounce can of chopped green chilies to the chicken mixture. Fajita seasoning mix too salty!  Will try my own combination next time.

Was very good but I made it for 10 enchiladas and added 16 oz of cream cheese like it called for. It turned out more like a chip dip which wasn't to bad. All and all it was a delicious recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I added some canned black beans (rinsed) and about 1/2 cup salsa (pico de gallo) to the chicken mixture. After baking the enchiladas in the oven, I topped them off with some cilantro and a small dollop of sour cream before serving. I have made this several times and every time it gets great reviews from everyone. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this recipe! Adjusted a few things- when you are rolling the mix in the tortilla shell you can squeeze it together and form it into a log. the mix won’t fall out of the shell. I used a larger glass dish -10 x 15 to hold all of the shells- the 9x 13 was too small. The 6” shells seemed small but they can hold a lot of the chicken mixture. Observed it with Zararans

The outcome was not bad. I had to add some extra things. I poured a can of mild Rotel before backing on the first round..I added much more enchilada sauce what was originally stated. I used  2  of the 19oz old elapse enchilada sauce. It smells super delicious. I hope it tastes that good too.

I made the recipe as written. I would make it again. Next time I would put less cream cheese, cut up smaller to melt better. 10oz sauce was a little short. I served it with corn that could have been put into the mix instead of on the side.

I wanted something different so I made these. I did not buy cooked chicken so I cooked about 10 chicken tenders with 1T cumin, 1 can of mild Rotel, salt, pepper and 1T of minced garlic until the chicken was done.  I shredded it and added the cheese, cream cheese, and  a little taco seasoning, I  didn't want to over season the mixture.  Prepared them as directed.  They were a hit.  I will be making them again.

It was delicious but next time I will add more cream cheese because I had so much chicken. Very simple to make! The bf loved it and we have plenty of leftovers.

Filling is a bit mushy, but delicious.
I defrosted chicken tenderloins (10-12),  then cooked them in my slow cooker with a taco seasoning packet and 1 can of chicken broth, on high for 5 hours.
Scooped chicken out of broth and shredded. 
Added to ROOM TEMPERATURE 8 oz cream cheese and diced scallions (saved some green parts for top with sliced black olives). 
Rolled inside 10 corn tortillas, covered with enchilada sauce, and 8 oz. shredded sharp cheddar, scallions and sliced black olives.

So my husband LOVED this!!! So yay! I, however, can’t do the globs of cream cheese in random bites. So next time I will try to use room temperature/softened cream cheese to spread on the tortillas. I used a whole package of taco seasoning instead of fajita or directed amount and that was good. Will be making again for sure with modifications. BUT SO SO easy!

Absolutely delicious! My fiancé won’t get enchiladas at the local Mexican restaurants because he likes these better. No substitutions needed, but I did decrease the uncovered cook time by 5 minutes To keep the top from getting too crispy. Heed the note to cube the cream cheese; it makes it a lot easier to mix the filling. Great recipe!

I made this for the second time over the weekend and everyone in the family loved it!  I parboiled 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and shredded them, added a can of well-drained black beans and a can of tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel) in with the cheeses, and used the taco seasoning as mentioned. Topped with chopped green onions and sour cream, served with some tortilla chips for a little crunch.  Mucho good!!!

Love this recipe! It was my first time to make enchiladas. I was cooking rice as a side. After I made the rice I mixed in some of the enchilada sauce. Then layered it on the bottom of my sprayed pan. Then I decided to add fresh chopped spinach to the chicken mixture bc I was trying to use up what I had before it went bad. I had extra filling left over so I put it on top with the enchilada sauce and cheese. It turned out great! My family loved it! I will be making this again in the future!

This is an excellent recipe! I am sure it is the way it is written, but we made some changes. We used 8" tortillas, used a little more chicken and added refried beans. I am sure we messed up the nutrition value, but it sure was good!

This was perfect ! My first time actually making enchiladas and the rotisserie chicken was such a good idea instead of the time it takes to cook and season it myself. The store I was at didn't have canned green chiles but they had diced tomatoes with green chiles so I used that and it still came out excellent.

I just made this recipe for the first time tonight. Only thing different I did was cream the fajita spices with the cream cheese and added the enchilada sauce to it. Turned out perfect! Definitely going into my recipe rotation.

A big hit in my house. I substituted the Enchilada sauce for medium salsa and the Fajita seasoning for Taco seasoning. I will make it again and may use hot salsa or add in some jalapenos for an extra kick.

This has made it into my recipe book.

Excellent enchiladas-rich and creamy.  Only change I made was to  mix  8 oz can of tomato sauce with enchilada sauce to cover enchiladas.  Will definitely make this recipe again!

Even though I would add a little less cream cheese next time,  I think this recipe is really yummy! Great with rice and a bed of lettuce.  Plenty enough  for leftovers/freezer meals. Will make again.

I have made these before using the Costco rotisserie chicken and the described recipe ingredients.  It is fast and easy and the kids, who are finicky enough, actually enjoy them and beg for more.  I used Fronterra mild enchilada red sauce this time, but have used El Paso and Las Palmas and have found I prefer the Fronterra sauce the best.  Add a little chopped onion, red and green peppers sprinkled with minced garlic and topped off with some some sour cream and you have a the makings of a delish Mexican dish!

We all loved it! And so easy. I hate to cook but my kids hate fast food. Typically I make seven meals on Sunday (eat one and freeze the rest) so that are freezer is always full of homemade dinner. This will definitely be making it into the rotation!

I used a baked chicken breast instead of the rotisserie chicken. Other than that I went right by the recipe. Be sure to freeze the cream cheese for a bit before you cut it into cubes. Simple and delicious.

Stuck to the pan even though I had sprayed liberally with Pam.  Thinking of using a different tortilla next time.

This recipe is so awesome and easy.   Especially great way to use leftover chicken.  I had corn tortillas so I used those instead of flour.  It was great.   I topped with sour cream and lettuce.   I think I might add corn for a little more crunch.

I modify a little. I add mild green chilies to the chicken mixture, and only use a LITTLE bit of enchilada sauce brushed on top because My husband doesn't like it. But they are sooo good this way!!!

Sooo good! I substituted the chicken with Morning Star vegetarian "chicken" patties which I cut up into cubes before mixing with the cheddar and cream. ??????? Everything still came out perfect even with the change.

It was good, I just used the taco powder and the enchilada sauce, instead of the cream cheese.  Pretty basic, and turned out just as tasty!

Our 12 year old made this with only some help.  It turned out really good!  We are all in food coma mode.  I like how simple it is, great for those just starting to cook on their own.  We baked 2 (flattened) chicken breasts at 400 for 28 min instead of using rotisserie chicken.

This is a keeper. I had lots of time so I cooked 4 large skinless chicken breasts in a slow cooker with 8oz can of diced tomato, a medium white onion (diced), and a quarter of a small red onion (diced) together in a slow cooker on low for 6 hours. Shredded the chicken and added the resulting salsa to the mixture along with half of the taco seasoning mix.
The rest was exactly as specified in the recipe.
Delicious! Everyone loved it.

this was my first time making enchiladas, but the recipe turned out great and the family loved it! the only changes i made was that couldn't find enchiladas sauce so i used taco sauce and i used a nacho cheese blend which gave the enchiladas a little more of a spicier kick. which i loved!

I loved this recipe! I substituted leftover gravy for the flour & broth and it turned out wonderful! I had sauce leftover after assembling the recipe so I added salsa to it & served it as dipping sauce. I give this recipe 5 stars!

I thought the cream cheese was not a tasteful ingredient.  Maybe refried beans could be substituted for it.  In any case, I won't make this recipe again.  A very heavy, unpalatable dish.  Sorry.

I like this recipe.  I used my own taco seasoning and also used corn tortillas for half of the enchiladas.  I prefer the corn tortilla enchilada.  Overall, this was a good recipe.

I tweaked this:  I cooked 1lb lean ground beef and strain, then cooked 1 lg chicken breast chopped with 1/2 onion and 1/2 bell pepper chopped until chicken was cooked through.  Added 1/2lb of shrimp and cooked to pink, then added the beef back in with the fajita mix and cheese (the wife and I don't like sour cream so I left it out).  Heated that until cheese was melted.  Stuffed White Corn tortillas instead of flour.  I also doubled the enchilada sauce (1 mild and 1 medium).  We loved it!

It's a hit with my 7 yr old! That says it all! Made a few changes which just worked better for me :) I baked my chicken then heated it in a pan with taco seasoning. Then added about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese (that's all I had) then I mixed in the cheese. Straight from my pan to the tortilla. Filled em up layed em on the enchillada sauce poured some on top then sprinkled with cheese and popped em in the oven °375 15-20 minutes. No foil.  Thank you! Great recipe! I only tweaked it because I didn't have enough cream cheese, no fajita mix or foil. Lol.. still worked! I think fajita mix would of bn too overpowering for our liking anyhow.

My wife and I are on a gluten free diet, so I substituted corn tortillas instead of flour and doubled the sauce to make sure they didn't dry out. Topped with sour cream and cilantro. Will definitely be making these again as they were AMAZING!

I added some sour cream (about 1/2 cup) to the filling mixture just because I needed to use it up. This recipe was absolutely delicious.

I'm not the world's best cook and these were fantastic!  My husband is tough to please since his mom was so good in the kitchen.  He looked forward to eating the leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly, but add a little diced onion.  I topped with shredded lettuce, diced tomato, and sour cream.  It looked and tasted like something we would order from our favorite Mexican restaurant.  I will 100% make this again.

I love this recipe. I also spread a thin layer of refried beans on the tortilla-perfection!

Mine turned out good but way too salty, even though I really like salt. I followed the recipe but next time I'll try others' suggestions to use taco seasoning or add my own seasonings. The fajita seasoning that I was able to find must have had more salt than what was originally used in this recipe. I think I'll add green chili and pico in my next attempt as well.

Made with taco seasoning because that's what we had on hand. Really good! Kids voted it 5 stars, which almost never happens!

This stuff was awesome. It was my first time making enchiladas and it was super simple. I paired it with some homemade pico de gallo and Spanish rice.
