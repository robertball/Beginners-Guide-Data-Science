LOVED 'EM!! I was looking for a different way to make peanut butter cookies and found this recipe. They are great! The dough is very fluffy and light. I took them to work for a pot luck and they were a big hit! The only thing I did different was to cook the cookies with the jelly in them. You have to make the impressions pretty deep to do this - but it taste better in my opinion..

If ever there was a cookie that turns out EXACTLY as it's supposed to, this is it.  I used a 1 T. cookie scoop to measure out the dough, so each was the perfect and perfectly-matched size.  The rounded 1/2 tsp. measuring spoon I used to fill the indentations with is the same spoon I used to make the indentations and that worked perfectly, just as the recipe instructed, two minutes out of the oven.  I made these using my favorite (Skippy...) peanut butter and, for contrast, used both blackberry and peach preserves.  For Peanut Blossom lovers, for classic peanut butter cookie lovers, or for peanut butter and jelly sandwich lovers,  this cookie will suit all of you. Delicious and very, very cute.

These just maybe my favorite cookies!  My only recommendation: use preserves and add to the cookies before you bake them.  They turned out sooo good I will definitely be making them again for the holidays and parties.

These cookies are incredibly addicting.  I just made a batch last night for my husband's work.  Mine don't look like the picture because I substituted real butter for the shortening.  So they are flatter but still pretty.  I will upload a picture later.  I also substituted coffee mate's vanilla nut creamer in place of the milk, and used red raspberry jelly.  The cookie is so delicious that I will use the dough recipe from now on as my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe. You gotta make these cookies; they are to die for. **on edit** If you do make these cookies with butter; DO NOT try to cook them with the jelly already in them.  The underpart of the cookie doesn't get done and they just don't taste the same.  This dough is a lot easier to work with if you refrigerate it for a while.  Lastly, you need to work quickly once you remove these cookies from the oven because they flatten out right away.  I just open the oven and pull out the sheet and start making indentations (this is, of course if you use butter instead of shortening)

I made these cookies for my peanut butter loving husband and he devoured them. I used a heart shaped cookie cutter and drizzled the cookies with peanut butter. They were too cute!

Great cookies, I did some with Chocolate Kisses, and some with homemade rapberry jam.   I sprinkled the tops with powered sugar.   A keeper!

Great recipe!  I think I made mine too large, I would recomend making them fairly small.  I used several different kinds of jelly with one bath of cookies.  It made them very colorful and gave us a nice variety.  This will go in the recipe book for sure!

I made these cookies tonight and they are very good.  I used a cookie scoop so the batch I made actually made about 5 dozen.  So if you are looking to make a small batch I would suggest cutting the ingredinents to half.

Great cookie! Very rich, well like by all who I shared with! I used Grape Jelly and Strawberry too. I tried it with Strawberry pie filling but it was too heavy, tasted good but they fell apart the next day. I did make them smaller and took them out of the oven a minute or two early to be sure they didnt harden!

Wonderful, peanut buttery cookies.  I am not a huge fan of just plain peanut butter cookies, but the addition of the sweet jelly makes these cookies so good I couldn't keep from eating a few.  I made half a batch that yielded me 32 cookies.  I filled 1/2 with blackberry jam (my daughter's favorite) and 1/2 with apricot jam (my favorite).  I prefer the apricot because of the tartness in contrast with the sweet cookie.  Either way, these are definitely a new family favorite that will be made often and with many different flavors of jam.

Very good! I decided to put the indentations in the cookie balls before baking and add the jam, but with one inch balls, that's just about impossible. So after some trial and error, I used a tbsp to measure out the portions, and then used the end of a wooden spoon to make enough room for the 1/2 tsp of jelly. Some came out a wee bit messy, but all came out tasty. After they were all baked, I added a little more jelly to each one. Melting the jelly for 10-20 seconds in the microwave makes it super easy to work with. Since we didn't have regular jam, I ended up using Polaner All Fruit, Blackberry with Fiber. Delicious!

Made these almost exactly as the directions described. I used Rasberry jam and cooked it along with the cookies as other have suggested.   I made one other twist....i made one tray with mini snicker on top instead of jam.  The peanut butter cookies were amazing and i made no changes to the base recipie.

The best peanut butter cookie recipe I've found.  Not too dry, not too hard, not too sweet and easy to make.  I used coconut milk because I found out someone had finished the milk without telling anyone and they were still perfect! I used the spiced strawberry jam from this site, it added that extra something that makes something special.  Thanks for sharing...I recommend this site, not only for the recipes but for the tips and ideas.  What a great resource.

These are great, and so pretty!  I did make some adjustments though:  I used half a cup butter instead of the Crisco, and one-and-a-half cups of peanut butter.  I used half teaspoon of salt.   They taste wonderful and very peanut-buttery!  I will make these again and again, especially for events that require a fancier look.

Very yummy! I couldn't decide whether to fill the cookies with jam after baking, or follow some of the reviewers' advice and fill them before. The cookies look much better if they are filled after baking (plus you can get more jam in them).

These were delicious. My family gobbled them right up. My only comment is that it would be best not to make more than will be eaten that day, because storage is tricky and they shouldn't be left out overnight.

These turned out as adverstised. Chewy and full of peanut flavor. I used raspberry and peach jams on top. Peach was not right, but ok. I also used only butter, not shortening. They turned out fine.

Excellent! Amazing! I can't say enough great things about these cookies... I had four different jellies on hand so the variety really added to the overall appearance and quality of the cookies. Yums, I will definitely be making these again!

Fabulous. I should have followed other reviewers' recommendation to make the cookies smaller than the one-inch balls as instructed in the recipe. The cookies wound up being rather large. Other than that, I have no complaints. The flavor and texture are amazing!

After running out of jelly for the last dozen or so cookies, I used chocolate Nutella to fill the thumbprints.  I found I preferred the Nutella to the jelly, but using both of the toppings makes a nice variety.

This recipe made a LOT of tasty peanut butter cookies.  I finished up with a little over 100 cookies; I was using a 1 inch cookie scoop.  Without any filling, these cookies were delicious, light and fluffy, with a mild to moderate peanut butter flavor.  They baked up beautifully in both a regular over and a convection oven.  

However, these cookies are not just plain cookies.  They involve jelly, too.  That's the part where this recipe falls from five stars to four.  Filling the cookie with jam after it has baked yields a weird combination of cooked and uncooked textures.  The uncooked jam runs when you bite into the cookie, and makes them impossible to store without making a mess of every cookie in the container.  

So I did what many reviewers did, I baked the jam in the cookie.  If you make the perfect indentation and fill with the perfect amount of jam, these turn out ok (at best).  If the indentation is too deep, the jam bakes through the bottom of the cookie and it is difficult to move.  If the indentation is too shallow, the jams runs off while baking.  Too narrow doesn't allow for enough jam, while too wide causes the cookie to spread like mad.  I used both Smucker's Strawberry and Bonne Maman's raspberry jams.

So, all in all, this is a good peanut butter cookie base.  But I really wanted peanut butter and jelly cookies.  I'll keep looking.  These could be quite good, but I don't have time for any more experimentation with them.  I won't make this recipe again.

I cut the recipe in half and easily got 3 dozen small thumbprint cookies. I used butter instead of shortening and the cookies are plenty sweet without rolling the dough in sugar. I tried three different jams and put them on before baking. Jams that are firmer to begin with work better. If your jam is runny, it will run off the cookie. I tried strawberry, raspberry, and apricot. A very small drop of jam is really all you need - as I said, the cookies are plenty sweet. But, I suppose it depends on how you like your pb&j sandwiches... I've always preferred more pb than j. Just a preference. The kids thought these were fun.

The peanut butter taste is subtle, which is nice with the jelly so it's not overpowering. Don't change the thing in the recipe - it's perfect the way it is :)

Oh my goodness these are so cute and delicious! A different twist on regular ole' peanut butter cookies. This was so fun to make. I used Skippy peanut butter, not Jif and followed the rest of the ingredients and instructions to a "T". I ended up with 40 good size cookies. The baking time was approximate. I took the back of a Tablespoon measuring spoon and used it to make the indentation into the cookies while it was still warm. I filled the center with Strawberry Jam, Guava Jelly and Orange Marmalade. I cooled all the cookies completely. I tell you these did NOT last very long, all were gone in no time! I definitely will be making these again!

These cookies floated out a lot more than I thought they would and I was not able to make indentations for jelly. I made them the size directed by the recipe and came out with exactly 5 dozen as the recipe stated.

That said, the recipe did make delicious peanut butter cookies! Moist and chewy.

I love this recipe. I did some changes to it due to availability of ingredients and just to tweak it a bit. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the shortening. I didn't have any shortening, and the half cup reduction was an error in measurement; 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour & 2 C white APF; and used grape jelly instead. I tried doing it both ways: baking it with and without the jelly. If you intend to eat it right away, you can put jelly after baking, if not, it is better to bake it with the jelly but both looked aesthetically pleasing either way. I tried baking in batches. Baked some for 10 mins and it was ok, light and fluffy; baked some for 11 mins and it was crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. I used my thumb to make a pretty good depression & to avoid letting the dough stick on my thumb, I dipped it on sugar first.

I use butter instead of shortening. Otherwise, I make no subs. 
They are very sweet, and can have less sugar (I personally like reduced sugar pb or natural pb to try and balance them out), but many people like the full sugar too. I usually try different kinds of jelly too.
I'm hoping not a lot of people come across this recipe, because I call them "My world famous PB&J cookies"! :)

The jelly seeped through the bottom of my cookies, so next time I'll make the cookie part thicker, and not press down so far to make the indent. Tasty though.

I went with a suggestion that I will stick with forever. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cup of peanut butter. My picky adult nephew lived them! Enough said!

Kind of time consuming, but this recipe makes ALOT of cookies! Didn't realize what I was getting myself into!
