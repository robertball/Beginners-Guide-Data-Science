This was amazing!   My BF is German and he said it's every bit as good as his Oma made.  I couldn't find juniper berries so used gin (which is made from the berries...interesting). jThe gravy was to die for!

This is absolutely delicious. My short ribs were fall apart tender and absolutely perfect. I did make a couple of minor changes though. I could not find juniper berries so I threw in a shot of gin to try to make up for it :)  I did not discard the vegetables at the end because I didn't wan't to lose the amazing flavor of the carmelized vegetables. Instead I used my immersion blender to puree the vegis right into the gravy. I also doubled the crushed ginger snaps because we love that ginger flavor. Sprinkled the completed dish with a few more crushed gingersnaps and wow! Make this....you won't be sorry! Thanks for sharing this amazing dish Chef John! UPDATE: I decided to try this with a chuck pot roast and it turned out delicious. I followed everything except I put the roast in a covered dutch oven and baked at 275 for five hours. Delish and fall apart pot roast!

We used thick chunks of stew meat for this recipe and it turned out perfect -- just a little more work to separate the meat from the vegetables/broth!   If you like German foods, this recipe will put a smile on your face.  Thank you Chef John!

Amazing!  Very tender beef.  I also used a shot of gin instead of juniper berries.  I do not usually eat gravy, but this  was awesome.  Served with cooked red cabbage and spaetzle.

Holy poop this is so good. I'm just getting into cooking German food and I was reticent to go get the juniper, etc. that I didn't have just to try this recipe but I am so glad I did. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out amazingly good. My wife was super impressed and we both agree that this one is worth the work. Will make again!

Amazing!  A Frankenmuth, MI restaurant had an amazing sauerbraten and this recipe is as good or better! I will recommend this to all my friends and family and cannot wait to make it again. I followed exactly except I used chuck roast and I was unable to find the juniper. Thank you Chef John!

Chef John, you are my new favorite chef.  Thank you for everything you do.  I made this for a dinner party, and have never even attempted sauerbraten before, or even tasted it.  Something about this recipe was calling to me, so I decided to make it. 

I used a chuck roast because they were on sale for crazy cheap ($2.49 a pound!) and the ribs were about a $1.50 more a pound.  I cooked the sauerbraten in a dutch oven at 275 degrees just shy of four hours.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.

[Side note:  I found the gingersnaps at a local Dollar Tree discount store for a buck!  This dinner was not only amazing, but very easy on the wallet to create!]

I served the sauerbraten with mashed potatoes made with herbed butter, and sweet and sour cabbage.  My dinner guests and I were in awe.  Can I just say, I have a new favorite winter recipe?!?!  The meat was just falling apart and the gravy was to die for.  Those mashed potatoes soaked up the gravy perfectly, and created a memorable, comforting meal.

This will be something I will look forward to making every year when it starts to get cold.  Thanks again, Chef John, for such a delicious, interesting, and heirloom-worthy recipe!

Excellent!  I made the sauce exactly as written (and was surprised to find juniper berries at our grocery store - for anyone in the northeast U.S., I found them at Wegmans).  The only change I made was using a tip roast instead of short ribs, and I baked it in a slow oven for about 5 hours.  Fall-apart tender, and very flavorful.  Served it with noodles and sweet and sour red cabbage.

Served for Christmas Dinner.  This turned out really well and was not too hard to make at all.  I really like the videos for help and guidance .  I ended up marinating for 2 days due to timing .  #3 was fine for our group of 6 with kids and grandparents, but I'd recommend a bit more  meat if you have adult eaters with heartier appetites.  Another Chef John hit in our house!

This recipe is very close to how my MIL made Sauerbraten and she was from Germany.  Next time I make it, I am going to use a round roast and marinate it for a couple more days. I served this with homemade Spaetzle and red cabbage. My husband loved it !!!!!

Relatively easy to do. Cooked with herbed spaetzle. 
Make sure you have good ventilation in your kitchen as the vinegar in the beginning can be a little strong as it begins to boil. There is a little pre-planning and cooking involved but easy to finish the rest of the dish the day of with about a brief 15 minutes to reduce the sauce. Turned out great for a holiday meal for a German American dinner that the family loved.
