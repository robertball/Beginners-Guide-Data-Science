I was bored today so I made 4 different recipes for deviled eggs at the same time and had neighbors & friends do a taste test. This one came in 2nd. It was okay, but a little dry and plain. If I had deviated from the recipe it would have been better but it was still just a plain base recipe. The other recipes in my taste test were "Cajun Deviled Eggs" by Denyse, "Deviled Eggs" by Barbara, and "Deviled Eggs" by Margaret Sanders. Margaret's were the unanimous winner.

These were excellent and easy to make!!!  If using fresh eggs, put lots of salt in the boiling water to make it easier to remove the shells.

The amount of vinegar in this recipe has been updated from 3 tablespoons to 1 teaspoon. We suggest adjusting the amount to taste.

Super recipe, and here are the modifications that I made:
2 Tablespoons of mayo.
1/2 teaspoon of mustard
1 Tablespoon of chopped sweet pickle relish
Left out paprika (doesn't work for us)
No lettuce, we don't make a big presentation, we just want to eat it.

I'd been searching for a GOOD deviled egg recipe for a long time.  I knew SOME of what my folks use to put in theirs, this recipe worked with the above additions.  With tons of appetizers out there, the eggs were gone within the first hour - high praise indeed.

I LOVE deviled eggs and this is a good basic recipe. I added more mayo, as I like the consistancy creamier. I also seasoned with a little garlic and onion powder and a bit of cayenne for an added kick. Because I was taking this to a dinner party I put the mixture into a pastry bag and piped with a star tip. I served the eggs on a bed of baby spinach leaves. Thanks for a great recipe Mary!

I love deviled eggs - they're a classic that just screams summer!  I use white wine vinegar vs. plain white vinegar because it's a little milder. I also use dijon mustard and add sour cream along with the mayo to make them creamier plus a dash of hot sauce for good measure.  These go quick at BBQ's so be sure to make a lot!

I definietly had to tinker with this one a bit!  The vinegar was a nice little kick...But I had to add more mayo because the filling was very dry.  Then I had to add more mustard because the extra mayo began to overpower the flavor of the mustard.  Not a bad recipe, but I'll continue searching for a better one.

This is a good recipe, however we like our filling creamier. I liked the flavor the vinegar imparted, so I added a touch more of the vinegar and more mustard, mayo and a bit of prepared horseradish sauce. Yum! Thanks Mary.

Simple recipe for deviled eggs but sometimes, the most simple tastes are the the best. This is really a great base recipe as well for those who like to play with their food and make it more personal.

I love deviled eggs and these went over well.  I did have to add more mayo because it was somewhat dry, but other than that, good.  I garnished with chopped pickles.  Thanks Mary!

This was very good. Just use the mayo and paprika as a guideline - Add enough mayo to make it the right consistancy for you, and sprinkle enough paprika to make you happy. I should have made twice as many for the party - they disappeared so fast!

Easy and tasty!! I didn't use vinegar.  Didn't have white and didn't want to use red wine, so I just omitted.  It still tasted GREAT!  I used a pastry bag to pipe the filling back into the egg white shells.  Have made them twice since Easter because EVERYONE asks me to bring "my" Deviled Eggs!  ;)

i agree with more mayo being needed, but this is the base combination of ingredients that is perfect.  I added a dash of sriacha and topped with paprika. I used a pastry bag to dispense the egg mix.. fancy and delish!!   i would give 5 stars but  i changed it slightly...

Don't hate me.  If you break up the egg white, then combine that in with the egg yolk mixture and then put that between two slices of bread you get "OMG" the best egg salad sandwich known to man.

I have been making Deviled Eggs without a recipe for many years. I decided to look at other recipes to find a change of pace. This one is very similar to mine but I found that there was WAY too much vinigar and paprika and not enough mayo. It was dry and the tartness was overpowering. I had to cook 3 more eggs and add them in with more mayo to make it edible.

I wasn't crazy about the filling- maybe it was because I doubled the recipe. But they were definitely delicious and not too hard to put together!

This is my favorite way to make deviled eggs.  It is how my grandma and mom always made the eggs, with also adding about 1 teaspoon of sugar.  I've tried other versions, but this is what I come back to.  Thanks Mary.

I did double the vinegar, mayo, & mustard. I also added about 1 tbls of minced onion & 1/4 tsp. of celery seeds. Skipped the lettuce since just for decortion & would be wasted anyway. Very good.

I changed the recipe quite a bit, or I would have given it a 5 star rating.  I used more mustard, mayo and vinegar.  Also a touch of celery salt.

Generally I hate deviled eggs and I'm not sure if no one else knows how to make them or what.  I made these and they were delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly, ate 4 on my own, can't wait to make for other people.  Thanks!

Good basic recipe. I added more mayo to give a creamy texture; used just a dash of vinegar, and added granulated garlic.  The family enjoyed this dish with these changes.

So easy to make and so delicious! Hubby won't share with me, he says they're too good. :)
I added half a chopped pickle, which made for a nice crunch.
This one's a keeper!

I used dijon mustard, low fat mayo and added spicy brown mustard after it was mixed. I think that's the true key to good deviled eggs!

Doubled all of the seasonings and saved the paprika for the top of the eggs. I added an extra yolk. I put the yolk mixture in a ziplock bag overnight and piped into the eggs the next morning and sprinkled with paprika, delicious!

This is a solid traditional picnic recipe.  I thought the vinegar might be weird; but, it really works in this recipe.  I used 8 eggs and increased the mayo to 3tbs and used a heaping 1/4 of mustard.

It's easier to leave out the vinegar, just use Miracle Whip, prepared mustard to taste and salt and pepper.  You have the same taste without chancing ruining it with too much vinegar.  Sprinkle lightly with paprica and serve.  Delicious.

Good devilled eggs, but maybe not the best I've ever had...I did like the "zip" that the vinegar gave to them though...I often add relish and I think I like that better so next time I'll do this recipe but add some relish...also I added quite a bit more mayo because I like it creamy. Good recipe though and super easy!

Perfect.  I added a little Dijon Mustard (about 1/8 teaspoon) and it was excellent. My husband never eats deviled eggs and I think this time I had one out of 8.  :)

Good recipe. I added sweet pickle relish (1 generous tbls.) and Tabasco sauce. In addition to the paprika, I sprinkled dried parsley on top of the eggs. I used a cake decorating tip and a pastry bag to pipe the filling into the eggs.

Definitely a good way to use leftover Easter eggs.  I increase the mayo and mustard, as I like a creamier filling.  I also like to add a dash or two of Tabasco.

If you like prepared mustard on eggs, this is for you. Otherwise, this recipe runs a very poor second to Di's Delicious Deluxe Deviled Eggs. It gets its kicks from a dash of hot sauce.

These are really good deviled eggs - I think the vinegar definitely makes them delicious, and I used dijon mustard instead of yellow.  They turned out wonderfully, and were the first ones to be finished at our potluck.  Thanks!

My whole family loved these! I ended up adding more mayo, mustard and extra vinegar. They were very good!

I added three Tablespoons of mayo and a small amount of sweet relish. Dijon mustard is much better than yellow in this recipe.

There's no way 3 Tbs. vinegar could be right.  I only used 2 thinking that was A LOT.  It was still way too vinegary and almost a liquid consistency.

These were a little dry. I added another tsp of white vinegar, used dijon mustard and increased amount to 1 tsp, added 2 tsp of sweet relish, and 1 tbsp of real bacon bits. A good base recipe to make your own. Thanks!

Although I haven't made these I wanted to give an extra idea. I started years ago using old bay seasoning in place of paprica. I also cut up sweet pickles and add to the yoke mixture then sprinkle with the old bay.Everyone loves them!

Deviled eggs are always what is requested of me when we have family gatherings. I make mine exactly as Ms. Brotherton does..Except.. BACON! I fry up a pound of crispy bacon, drain it, even pat it down with paper towels, then crunch it to fine bits. Add THAT to your yellow egg mix and watch the smiles!

This recipe was excellent...I did add a little sugar though...my husband doesn't like mustard so I needed to mask it a little. Great and easy recipe. I used 12 eggs so i had to double the rest of the ingredients.

I would absolutely eat it again.
the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because It needs a little more salt and it felt dry in my mouth...
other than that.. it's AMAZING!

This is a good basic recipe but I like mine with a few modifications.  I increased the mayo - A LOT, I added a little onion powder, and little white sugar.  Always the first item to go on a potluck table!  YUM!

What can I say?  As far as deviled eggs go, these were fantastic and a cinch to make.  They were served at a dinner gathering alongside my mom's deviled eggs (made with Miracle Whip), and mine disappeared twice as quickly as hers.  I'll definitely stick with this simple, proven recipe in the future.

This is a good start, but in the South we also add sugar (to taste), and sweet relish for the best deviled eggs ever. I've been making them for 40 yrs.

Been looking for Mom's deviled eggs and here it was.  We like ours creamy and sweet, so I added a little more mayo and 1 teaspoon of sugar.  Awesome!

This is almost the exact recipe that my mother used when I was growing up and the one that I use now.  The only change (very necessary) is to add 1 tsp yellow mustard.  Don't use the mustard recommended in the recipe and make sure to use 1 tsp and you'll be very happy!!  Up the mayo too if desired.  Dry isn't good. Enjoy!!  You'll get rave reviews!

Pretty good deviled eggs. Seemed like something was missing as far as flavor? I usually make the recipe sent in by Margaret Sanders, and this one just can't quite compare.

This is the classic recipe my mom has always made! She has to make extra, because once they're served, they don't stay on the plate for long. I like to put a cocktail shrimp or olive slice on top.

Very tasty with the white vinegar...although I too like a creamier filling, so for 6 eggs, I almost doubled all the other ingredients.  Also, I think dijon mustard tastes better in this recipe.  Very good for the most part!

I just tried this recipe tonight and had to add about 3 additional TBSPS. mayo to get the right consistency. Other than that, this is a very simple, quick recipe that I will use again with the adjustment.

I tried this recipe and for me, there was waaaay too much paprika and not enough mayonnaise.  I found that it was to dry so I increased the mayonnaise to three table spoon and decreased the paprika to half a teaspoon.

We have tried deviled eggs w/ ranch dressing and a recipe w/ curry. We wanted to return to a classic recipe. We had to add a lot of extra mayo and mustard. I found them bland, but my daughter liked them better than the "fancier" recipes. The yolk blend did not look nice after being squirted back into the egg even using a pastry bag and nozzle.

Really liked the flavor of this, made with apple cider vinegar instead of white and just a little seasoned salt, but it took more than twice the amount of mayo to get anywhere near being able to fill the egg white halves, and it was still pretty dry.  We also sprinkled extra fresh-ground pepper on top with the paprika.

FAR too salty - with a backup of 'hello onion'.  Perhaps my onion was quite strong (seems I have gotten a strong batch this go 'round) but it is the only thing I could 'kind of' taste other than salt.  I may try again, with only a pinch of salt, but had to toss this batch as the eggs could not be salvaged.

A classic; my favorite way to make deviled eggs. For 6 large eggs, I think you need 3 Tbsp of mayo; with only one it was still crumbly. I like to substitute juice from a jar of hot pickled okra for the vinegar.

Near perfect recipe in my opinon.  I added a dash of hot sauce since I don't consider the eggs "deviled" unless they are a little bit spicy.

I added a table spoon of Bacon mayo, 1/4 tsp.regular creamy mustard, 1 tsp,white vinegar, and a large tablespoon of low fat  sour cream.My daughter doesn't like spicey. I think with the hint of bacon it will go over great. Good basic recipe. :0)

If you want to spice it up use S&B's Oriental Hot Mustard instead of prepared mustard. adjust to taste never any left overs.

This is a good recipe, with all the classic ingredients.  I did make some changes.  I preferred the egg yolk mixture less dry, so I ended up adding 4 Tbsp. mayo and 1/2 tsp. mustard.  The 1 tsp. vinegar was just right.  This, to me, resulted in the perfect consistency and flavor for deviled eggs.

These were the first deviled eggs I've made.   I followed the recipe and also added a small amount of finely chopped celery and green onion. I really enjoyed these eggs but had one comment that they needed to be a little tangier.

I've never made devilled eggs before but these were really easy and good! I added a little bit extra mayo like others did but I liked it creamier and it was easy to manage when filling the shells.  I will definitely make things again, I made extra to pack for lunch, too!

This was excellent!!! I made them for a family cook out, and it was gone!!! Everytime someone make deviled eggs, no one eats them up so fast. But these were a hit, and I loved them!! Thanks for sharing.

A good classic recipe.  I did add more mayo to make it easier to squirt, but then again I made 5 dozen eggs.

I do not eat these, but made them for my husband. He gave them a "3" stating they were good & he'd eat them again, but he's had better! He said this is a good basic deviled egg.

This was a good base recipe to start with. I used more mayonnaise and mustard, omitted the vinegar and instead added a little pickle juice!

The amount of paprika was way to much and the amount of mayo was not nearly enough. I couldn't even stir it. I ended up adding more eggs and 1/4 cup of mayo.

This is a great basic recipe, but for the sweet tooths in your group, try a little brown sugar in the mix.  It will dissolve easier than white sugar and everyone seems to love it!

The recipe is a good base -- but as is, its not as delicious.  The mayon is WAY too little--as well as the vinegar.  I think most people like deviled eggs creamy and when I used the ingredients it was very dry.  I had to add more mayo, vinegar--and for flavor I added some minced onion and spicy brown mustard, and a bit extra of pepper.  After that it was GREAT!

I followed other's advice and increased mayo to 2 Tbsp. and added a 1/4 tsp. onion powder and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. Definitely taste the mix before adding salt or it may end up too salty.  I think the vinegar adds a salty taste and you may need only a tiny sprinkle of salt.  Taste as you go and they'll be great!

These eggs were very dry. I added more mayo and still they had that dry taste. I should have kept adding I guess. I was a little disappointed with this recipe.

Good, but like other reviewers, found these to be dry. I added more mayo. The taste of these is somewhat "classic" and appeals to most people. Thank you.

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer but tripled the recipe. (Big family.) They came out so good and were the first appetizer gone.  My 3 and 1 year old boys were licking the bowl clean of the mixture.  I added a bit more mayo as suggested.

This is just what I was looking for. Traditional-style deviled eggs with less mayo than most recipes call for. I don't like the runny gooey texture of most deviled eggs. I mixed up the filling in my small food processor and it came out light and fluffy. I piped the filling out of my decorator bag for a nice clean look. I also put a slice of olive on top instead of the paprika and parsley.

Excellent - I had never made these before and they tasted great and were very easy to make.  Scooping the finished mixture into the eggs did not make them as attractive as I would have liked.  Need to bu the proper tools for next time - and there definitely WILL be a next time for this recipe!

I woke up in the mood for deviled eggs but I was looking for a different way to do deviled eggs other  than my usual way.  I saw this and was intrigued by the addition of vinegar.  My husband made breakfast today and I was still sleep but there was leftover bacon (if you can believe that) so I decided to add some chopped up bacon and a sprinkling of garlic and onion powder. Delicious!!

The best way to make easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs with pure yellow centers is to place the eggs in a pot of cold water and add a teaspoon of salt. Place the pot on the stove and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and remove from heat and let sit for 13 minutes. Drain the eggs and immediately place in an ice bath until completely cooled. Drain and enjoy your perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. Works every time and no ugly green yolk.

I made these little gems for a Halloween party I had. I mixed in some green food coloring and topped them with black olives so they looked like eye balls. They were a hit! The only difference was that I had to add quite a bit more mustard, mayo, and vinegar to get the consistency where I wanted it. Much too dry, otherwise great!

Good basic recipe. Got me experimenting.  I doubled the amounts of ingredients except eggs.  Used Tarragon vinegar, Tabasco mustard, and sweet spanish paprika.  Adjusted mayonnaise to a creamy texture. If you like a zingy deviled egg, you might like this verison

These deviled eggs were alright, but I felt that the white vinegar was extremely overpowering. I also needed to add some more mayonnaise in the end because the mixture seemed pretty dry. Next time I will definitely do without the vinegar.

Really good! I added some extra mayo to make the filling creamier, but ended up wishing I hadn't because it slightly overpowered the filling. I'm not a big fan of mayo though, so maybe that's just me. 

I added a dash of cayenne pepper to each to give it a little more pep; other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great "normal" deviled egg. It really needed the vinegar doubled to wet it down and ad some more bite.  We also added jalapeno dices to the top for garnish.  Very tasty!

Excellent and simple.  My kids love boiled eggs but I am always throwing away the yolks.  They all loved these!

any time i've made deviled eggs, they never turn out...but with the help of this recipe , they turned out great.  this is a good base but needed some doctoring.  I added more mayo to make it creamy, added about twice the mustard & added sugar to taste

My friends RAVE about these eggs and beg me to make them for all our parties.  They taste great!  If you like a bit more tang, add a little more vinegar and mustard.

These were pretty good.  I will make them again, but next time I will add more mayo to make them a little creamier.  Otherwise, these were great!

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. No tweaking or modifications needed here. Taste was dead on. This is a cheap crowd pleaser. I'm only sorry that I didn't double the recipe. I don't time how long the eggs have been boiling to determine doneness. I lift an egg out of the boiling water with a spoon and observe how quickly the water evaporates on the surface of the shell. When the water on the shells evaporates within 2 seconds, I submerge them in cold water for easier handling.

This was my first attempt at making deviled eggs and they came out quite good.  I asked around the party and the only suggestion I received was to add a bit of lemon juice which I will do next time I make these.  I also added a little bit of horseradish which was a great addition.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is the basic recipe I have always used. I sometimes will substitute red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar for the white. I have never measured the mayo- but we like it creamier, so I use more mayo until it is the right consistency for us. My deviled eggs are always the first to go at any family function.

This is a good recipe to use as a general idea. I added dijon mustard, white balsamic vinegar, and a dash of tabasco. My boyfriend said he didn't like deviled eggs, Then he proceeded to eat eight halves and said they were to best deviled eggs he'd eaten!

I liked this recipe along with the hints on making it a little better.  I followed this recipe with these exceptions (It has a little kick but these were gone in two minutes on Superbowl);

6 eggs
3 1/2 tbl Mayo.
1 tsp. Dijon Mustard (Grey Poupon)
1 Tsp dill relish (pressed on paper towel)
1 Tsp. horseradish
garnished with paprika.

Good recipe. Very simple, predicable deviled eggs. Perhaps 'traditional' is a better word. These are like the deviled eggs your grandma made.

This is close to the recipe my granny and momma always used - both true southern cooks.  These are not true "deviled" eggs - it takes hot sauce, such as Tabasco, to get that fine distinction.
One thing I do differently is use Tarragon vinegar which adds just that extra touch.  Any function I take these to ... my batch always disappears first.

Love these with the vinegar!  Added a shake of garlic salt and used more mustard and miracle whip than it called for. Yum!!!

no, it was an easy recipe to do and they were delicious.  I took them to carry in dinner at church and mine was the first to be eaten all up.  Thanks for the recipe!

The only change I made was to use Honey Mustard in the mix, I didn't even get one egg, they were gone in a flash.

I was looking for a simple recipe with few ingredients and this is it! Just like I remember. I used seasoning salt and probably put in more mayo than it called for (I added it before looking up any recipe). Delicious!

1 tsp is a lot of paprika. I accidentally mixed in 1/2 tsp and then sprinkled the rest on top as indicated.  Honestly this didn't really taste like anything but paprika and eggs to me, but you will probably love it if you love paprika.  I prefer my deviled eggs with a bit more of a kick.

Very good recipe had I not messed up my egg boiling! I don't know what I did but the egg white got dry and rubbery! Yuck. I could eat the yolk mixture plain though, it tasted so good!

Very good recipe. I used Dijon mustard and wish I hadn't though. But I'm not that big a fan of diijon. Next time I think I'll use either Australian or American mustard in place. 

I also used a piping kit to put the filling back in the eggs - like in the picture - and it looked so pretty. Thanks for a good recipe!

Used smoked paprika, which may have spoiled it this time. I think next time, no paprika in the eggs, maybe just a slight dusting on top

Mmm.. great appetizer for guests! Great for BBQs as well. I add more mayo, b/c I like the smoother texture (vs. the yolky texture). Sometimes, if I have left over bacon, I'll crumble and add that... so good! Thanks!

I love this recipe!!  My husband and step son loved these and they are very honest with me.  I added a Tbs. of butter because my mom always put butter on our hard boiled eggs.  Whether you do or don't, this is an easy and tasty recipe.   Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe that you can adjust to your own taste. I have been making it for over a year now and every time I go to a get-together I get asked if I am bringing my eggs!

I do add more mayo so the mixture isn't as dry and more vinegar for flavor, but otherwise this is great! Thanks!

Never added vinegar before - very good! Used Nature's Made Seasoned Salt and these were fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great basic recipe like I had in my 4-H book as a child. I sometimes add a little dill to add a special touch.

I made these for superbowl sunday and they were a hit. I added more mayo as suggested by other reviewers, as it was a bit dry. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of finely chopped green onion. Next time I will increase the amount of mustard per hubbies request. A good basic recipe made even better with a few adjustments. Thanks Mary!

Very good traditional recipe. Family loves it! I added a tablespoon of butter for creaminess.  The taste and balance of ingredients is very good.  My compliments to the cook who posted!! Thanks for sharing.

Rather dry, and they tasted like they were lacking "something." We prefer creamier deviled eggs. I think I'm going to keep looking...

I've never made deviled eggs before - and this was so simple!  It was a little dry, so I added about another 1/2 tablespoon of mayo - I think I'll add relish next time...YUM!

Excellent! I add a few dashes of Tabasco, some sweet pickle relish and about 20% more mustard (which helps with the dryness, but this is a fabulous recipe as written! Fluffy and light!

Since some other reviews I read said the yolk filling tended to be a bit on the dry side, I increased the vinegar to 1 1/2 tsp.  I also love using flavored vinegars and used a garlic flavored red wine vinegar.  Absolutely delicious.

I agree with some users this is a great base recipe if you are not sure how to make deviled eggs.  I used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  I also added several teaspoons of sweet relish to make this.  It will turn out dry if you don't add enough mayo.

I triple this recipe each time I make it, and I only have to store about 9-10 eggs, because they get eaten as they're put together! And the stored ones disappear within an hour!

I followed the exact recipe and found the mixture very, very bland.  I added a good amount of spicy-ish horseradish mustard to give it a little kick, but then it ended up to thin too hold it's shape coming out of the pastry bag.

I made these for my Thanksgiving dinner and they didn't go over too well, in fact I don't think anyone ate more than one.  They weren't bad, they just kind of needed an extra kick... I might try miracle whip instead of mayonaise for an extra tang, and maybe a dash of tabasco next time.

These were ok.  Not very creamy though.  I ended up adding alot more mayo.
