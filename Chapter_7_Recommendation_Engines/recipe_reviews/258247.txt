My store was out of broccoli slaw so I had to do my best at making my own. The bigger pieces didn't bother us because we like our veggies crunchy so it didn't matter that they were less done. I added a handful of snap peas that I had leftover from another recipe and those were a nice addition. The one thing I did not like about the recipe was the treatment of the bean sprouts. Fresh would have been 10 times better but if using can you can not add them in so early or they will turn to mush. Good recipe but I recommend using fresh bean sprouts if available. if not, wait to add them at the end.
