I discovered hatch chilies this year and had a great time trying a bunch of new recipes.  I used this to a drizzle over Caribbean inspired chicken tacos with a pineapple/ hatch chili salsa.  Really enjoyed how the ranch/sour cream combo both tamed the heat and played up the smokey char factor.  We also really had cilantro, but I have to admit it worked very well in this dressing

I used this as a dressing for salad as the recipe submitter mentioned. It was excellent and perfect as written!
