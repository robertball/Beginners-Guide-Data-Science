Excellent.  I made mine the night before.  I baked the cresent dough for 10 min at 425, and then poured the sausage/egg mixture over it and refrigerated.  I baked the next morning at 425 for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  Served it with homemade sausage gravy.  Yum!  Even the kids loved it.

I've made this casserole several times and everyone loves it!  The guys in my family especially like it.  I would highly recommend it for company!  It's a hearty breakfast/brunch that is easy to put together and sure to please!  I have found that I need to bake the casserole almost twice as long as the recipe calls for otherwise the eggs don't set up and the center is runny and pretty disgusting.  Bake it till the eggs set in the middle and the edges are lightly browned.  Then I let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes before serving and you are in for a devine breakfast.  I serve with a fresh fruit salad and OJ.  YUM-YUM-YUM!!!!

Took this for a MOPS meeting recently everyone loved it!!  I did change a few things though.  I used ham instead of sausage and used a cheddar-jack blend cheese.  Mixed the egg mixture night before and stored it in the fridge.  The next morning I baked the crescent rolls for about 5 minutes before pouring on egg mixture.  Turned out perfect!  Thanks for such an easy, delicious recipe!

This recipe was really great.  The eggs came out really light and fluffy and the taste was good.  However, the crescent roll dough at the bottom was still uncooked when the rest of the dish was fully cooked.  My father suggested cooking the crescent rolls at the bottom of the pan first and then adding the rest of the ingredients and baking again.

This was great.  I wanted more egg and less sausage so I used 8 eggs, 1 1/2 c. milk, 1 lb. of sausage.  I had cheddar cheese so I used that (still 2 c.).  I added fresh chopped chives, diced red pepper, about 1/2 t. dry mustard, a dash of paprika and a sprinkle of dried parsley. It took about 25 min. to cook.  I baked it at 425 for 5 min. then turned it down to 400 for the rest of the time. I took it to a mom's group meeting and it was gone so fast.  I even had ladies asking for the recipe!  This one is a winner.

I followed the suggestions of others and cut the sausage back to 1 pound, and used one less egg to help it set up. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I still enjoy this recipe--I simply substitute a pound of "Gimme Lean" brand vegetarian "sausage" instead. It still turns out great, and even my non-vegetarian friends and family give it rave reviews! (It cuts a lot of the fat out, as well.)

So easy and so delicious.  I added onions and some more pepper like suggested.  I also put the crescent rolls in for about 5 minutes before adding the egg mixture.  It turned out great and everyone loved!

This is very good and easy.  I used 1 lb hot breakfast sausage and 1/2 lb mild.  Next time, I'll go with 50/50.  It did take a bit longer to cook 20-25 minutes.  **UPDATE**I've made this several times and the last one was the best.  While the sausage is cooking, mix the eggs, milk, and cheese together and let it sit.  The cheese seems to "absorb" quite a bit of the liquid so that when you pour the whole mixture over the crescents, it's thick.

Delicious and easy.  I used the Jimmy Dean Maple sausage - 1 pound definitely enough - and received many compliments.  I cooked the crescent crust the night before, made it so easy for me to bake and take to work in the morning.  This will definitely be a standard - and I can see future substitutions of veggies, bacon or whatever.

Very good recipe and well liked by my whole family. I used breakfast turkey sausage patties, yolkless eggs from the carton and cheddar cheese. I took the advice from another reviewer and baked the dough for about ten minutes before adding the other ingredients. I found that the bake time seemed a little off. It took my eggs about thirty minutes to set up. Very filling!

Try adding some sauted green peppers,onions and some bacon thats been cut up and fried! It adds more flavor. I also used half mozzerella half cheddar on the cheeses.

This was good - very picky son espec. liked it. Only giving it 4 stars since I changed it after reading reviews. Used 6 eggs, only 1/2 lb sausage and 1 C milk. Baked cresc. roll crust at 425 deg. for 5 mins. as others suggested, then turned down the temp to 400. Baked casserole for 25 mins. Crust was perfect. Could have prob. cooked for a few mins. less, but was good. Pretty easy and provided lots of leftovers for quick bkfst before school/work.

Took this into work along with a Blueberry Breakfast Casserole and they were both great hits!  I did bake the crescent rolls for 10 minutes at 350 to cook first.  Doubled the recipe and used 2 cups cheddar and 2 cups mozzarella cheese.  Also added some sauteed onions.  Mmmmmm!

My husband said to rate this 4.5 stars. I settled for 4. It was great! I took the advice of others and pre-cooked (for about 5 minutes) the rolls. For my oven, it took about 20 minutes for the dish to cook through. Nothing was soggy or overdone. Perfect! The other changes I made was I added a sprinkling of onions to the browning sausage, and cut down on the amount of salt. No added salt is really needed with this recipe. The cheese has plenty. This is a recipe that is easy, quick, and it can be tweaked to suit your tastes. Add cilantro, serve with salsa. Use hamburger instead of sausage and cheddar cheese, or leftover pork, roast, or chicken. Season sausage with a bit of sage or rosemary or thyme. For the garlic lovers, add garlic. Whatever your family likes. The reason it didn't get five stars is, the crescent rolls were quite salty. Next time, I'm going to try puff pastry or Filo dough for the crust. This made a wonderful supper dish, served with a green salad, on a cool spring evening.

My family loves cheese and this recipe is such a change from the one that I used to use!  This recipe is fast and easy to put together and it eliminates the step of making it the night before that I have found with other breakfast casseroles I have made.      We truly enjoyed it:)

This is an great recipe.  I decided to cut the recipe in half and use an 8 X 8 pan.  I used half the crescent rolls on the bottom, layered the sausage and egg on top of them and then covered the eff with the other half of the crescent rolls.  Out daughter really enjoyed this and kept going back for more.  Be careful with the salt since the sausage already adds a salt to the dish.

Have made this several times and is delicious.  I add diced green peppers and mushrooms when I brown the sausage.  Also place sliced tomatoes on top before baking.

Be sure to cook the crescent rolls in the dish for 10 minutes before adding other ingredients.  Great recipe and everyone enjoyed it.

Great recipe, very easy and delicious.  I cut the leftovers into squares and froze them and took them to work for lunch.  Used less sausage but the same eggs and cooked a little longer than listed here.  Great for supper as well as brunch or breakfast!

I took this recipe to a church breakfast.  I substited ham for the sausage, used 6 eggs instead of 4, used 1 1/4 cups milk instead of 3/4 cup.  I also added 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the recipe.  Baked almost 30 minutes.  I had several people ask for the recipe so I always consider that a compliment!

We love this recipe! It has become my go to breakfast whenever we have people staying with us. Like others I have to tweek it a little; I use 1 pound sausage, 5 eggs, 1/3 cup milk, and 2 cups of whatever cheese I have on hand. I also put the cresent rolls in the oven for about 5-6 minutes before I top with everything else. All of these tweeks were just because it would take forever to get everything to cook all the way through with how the recipe is written.

ehhhh... it was ok. I added a few more eggs to give it alittle more substance. Had to cook much longer than the recipe calls for. I also baked the cresent rolls for 6 minutes before adding the egg/sausage/cheese mixture. This was ok. My kids didn't care for it. I needed ketchup ontop mine to give it flavor.

GREAT recipe. My teenage boys never leave any when I make this. They request this at least 3 times per week. I like to make and leave in fridge for a quick reheat for snacking.

This is very good! I, too, pre-baked the crescent rolls and used spicy breakfast sausage.  I also threw in a can of diced jalapenos for extra spice. Will definitely make again!

I made two casseroles New Year's Morning to cure everyone's hang-overs.  One I made exactly as the recipe states and the second one I made with diced ham, green onions and Jack cheese.  The sausage version is ALWAYS a huge hit!  Suprisingly the ham and cheese casserole was just as delicious if not better!!!  Next time I make this casserole I think I'll try it with swiss cheese, cooked crumbled bacon, and then top it with some thinly sliced tomatoes, I'm thinking a kinda BLT version.  Maybe sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on top?  The variations on this could be endless...sauteed Mushrooms with smoked Gouda?  How about diced Red Bell Pepper with Ham and a creamy Havarti cheese?  YUM-YUM-YUM!!!

This was an excellent breakfast casserole.  My boyfriends parents were in town and his dad even had seconds.  Like other reviewers I cooked the rolls for about 5 minutes before topping with the egg and cheese mixture.  I also used cheddar cheese instead just because of personal preference.

A BIG hit with my family! It was very delicious,I made a few changes though. I added 1 c mozzarella & 1 c cheddar cheese. I would have loved to add onions and green peppers,but I have a picky family. GREAT RECIPE!

Very good!  In my opinion the original recipe calls for way too much sausage.  I halved the recipe using a can of four crescent rolls, baked in an 8x8 pan, used less than a half pound of sausage, and sharp cheddar cheese.  My dh gives this a five star rating~ I'm slightly pickier so I give it a four.

Had the whole family in for a graduation and they all loved it! Baked the croissants first like others had recommended and added garlic and onion powder for some extra flavor and everyone raved about it!

I made this recipe to serve at a brunch for some out-of-town guests last weekend.  It was a tremendous hit!  Everyone thought it was a complicated recipe.  I just smiled :)    I did cut back on the sausage to 1lb, and cut back on the cheese as well (I used about 1 cup of cheddar/mozz/jack mixed).  I also spiced it up a bit with some sage and thyme, and a bit of parsley for color.  It was delicious!   My only caveat is - don't put it on the bottom rack -- the rolls turned very dark brown.  (Still edible, but not pretty.)

Very good. I added an extra egg and used 1 pound of sausage instead of 1 1/2. If you're a cheese lover, try 3 cups. It makes a big difference!

Our whole family loved this simple and quick recipe.  Even the four kids! It's great for a nice hot after church family brunch.  We've made it four times since I found it.. once for dinner as I needed to pull something together quickly. We've only ever used one pound of the sausage, but otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Thanks for submitting this Jennifer. :)

Per a mixture of prior reviews, I doubled the amount of eggs, used 1 ¼ cp milk, 1 cp cheddar, 1 cp mozzarella, and baked the crescent rolls for 10 min @350 in oven prior to adding the egg/cheese/sausage mix.
It came out so tasteful! I served it for brunch for my in-laws and they loved it. I loved it too and hubby loved it! I will definitely make this again.  Perhaps using bacon or pork roll in place of sausage.  Great recipe!

I precooked the dough at 350 for until it was set but not browned. Then I made as directed, cutting the sausage back to 1 pound. and refrigerated to bake the next morning. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was even though it sat in the fridge overnight!

Per others suggestions- I baked the crescent rolls for 5 min first at 350, used 5 eggs, and added red peppers and onions with the sausage! Also added cheddar and cheddar Jack cheese! It was a hit for my holiday brunch! Will definitely make again!

I made this for a Boss's Day potluck breakfast.  It was a big hit with my co-workers, and I got a lot of compliments.  Since I made such a big dish of it, there was some leftover.  With a dozen people each making something different, I wasn't surprised.  I carried it home and it made a nice supper for me and my husband.  This is a can't miss dish for a brunch.

This is more like a quiche, made a few changes:  6 eggs, 1 lb sausage, 1 1/2 Tbs dried chopped chives, baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Cooled slightly and cut into small squares for a buffet.  Will use this recipe again & again!

Very easy to make and very good.  I did make some changes based on some of the reviews I read.  I actually used mozarella and cheddar but would like to continue to experiment with different cheeses.  I used only 1 lb of sausage, 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk.  The only other change I would probably do is the type of sausage.  I mixed regular pork sausage and maple sausage.  I would like a little more of a zing so next time I will use spicy (or zesty) sausage and mix with maple sausage.  My mouth is watering in anticipation.

This came out really good!  I had sausage links, so I just sliced them and scattered them over the crescent roll dough.  Then I scattered the cheese over that and poured the egg/milk mixture over the top.  Came out perfect!  Thanks for a quick and easy  (not to mention delicious) brunch recipe!

This was very good. I added one egg, a splash more milk, only used 1 lb. lean sausage, and I cooked (lower fat) crust for 7 minutes before topping. I turned down the heat to 350, used a 12x8 glass pan, and cooked for about 20 minutes based on other reviewers' comments about edges browning. We ate with maple syrup and hot sauce (think McGriddle). Yum!

This is so easy and so yummy!  I make it on weekends, Christmas morning, or even use Crescent roll triangles pressed into muffin cups.  Then you pour the egg mixture in and you have teeny tiny quiches.

This recipe was really excellent!  I took others advice & baked the cresent for ~7 mins first.  I also added mushrooms, onion, & pepper to the sausage while cooking (only used 1 lb of sausage).  I used additional cheese (mix of mozzarella & cheddar) and I also used one additional egg.  Turned out great!

This recipe received rave reviews at a Mother's Day brunch I held today, even by my biggest critic (The Mother-In-Law).  As suggested by others I baked the crescent roll crust the night before, and added chopped red pepper and green onions, as well as an aditional egg.  It took slightly longer to bake than the recommended time.  Loved it!

I used the "50% less fat" sausage, and the casserole was still delicious.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  It was a hit with my co-workers!

I used cheddar cheese.  Crust came out great in my 13x9 stoneware baker. My kids asked for seconds.  Thanks.

Tasted great- easy to prepare.  Would be better if it fixed more.  I even used 5 eggs.  It would probably work with 6+ eggs to provide more servings.

I made this dish for my roommate and myself on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  It was wickedly easy and tastes great.  I only used 1 pound of sausage and probably could have only used a half pound to still be delicious.  I also substituted in Cheddar Jack cheese.  This would be a great dish to take to work and share with my coworkers!

This was Wonderful!!!!!! And got so many compliments!!! I made it twice the first time I used 1 1/2 lbs mild italian saugage. It was good but I found it over whelming. Today I just used 1 lb. and it was better - great!! I mixed all of the ingredients (eggs,saugage,etc) the night before and then in the morning I put it all in the pan. It cooked a little longer, but it was great!!! This is a KEEPER and great for overnight guests

I added a layer of leftover grilled asparagus to the top of it. pretty good but a little bland- my fault should have added some spices. There were no leftovers even so.

Precooked crust for 10 min at 425 like everyone said and then baked 30 min at 400. My slight variations were egg beaters, jimmy dean turkey sausage crumbles and taco blend cheese for some pizzazz! It was yummy as seen in my photo!

I made this and my family LOVED it! We used 6 eggs, instead of the 4. And 1/2 pound of hot sausage, and 1 pound medium sausage. We also added an extra 1/2 cup or so of mozerella and probably 1/2 of chedder. To make it our own, we added olives as well. We are making this again tonight!

I served this with fresh fruit for a quick weeknight dinner.  Super easy and tastes great!!!  I used what I had on-hand: 1/2 lb of country pork sausage, a mix of cheeses (cheddar, Mexican blend, and mozzarella) and a small can (4oz) of crescent rolls.  Baked in a smaller pyrex dish (8"x11.5").  No salt or pepper added and I didn't think it needed it at the table.  I prebaked the crescent roll crust until light brown, and I did have to bake the casserole about 7-10 minutes past the stated 15 minutes, but my baking dish was a bit smaller than called for so that could account for the difference.  Bottom line is it was easy to make and we all enjoyed it very much. UPDATE: I have made this *many* times and no longer prebake the crust.  It is an amazing dish as written.  We all love it and there are never any leftovers!

Tried this recipe this morning...and it was a big hit especially with my two year old son who usually doesn't eat eggs. Since I am a vegetarian I didn't get a chance to taste the meal myself however the men in my household loved it. This will definitely become a regular item on our breakfast menu.

Just made this! i had to halve the serving size due to baking dish constraints. I used about 14 links, 2 eggs and 1/4 cup and 2 Tblspns of milk. I cooked it for about 18 minutes.  Turned out fantastic. Did have to let it cook longer than the recipe said though.

KIDS LOVED IT! I followed the other suggestions of baking the crescent rolls for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I did not use 2 cups of cheese because I did not want it too cheesy, but next time I will.  I also did not use 1 1/2 lbs. of sausage.  I think that I will use either 6 or 8 eggs next time.  This is sooo EASY to make.

i made this in home ec when i was in highschool and my husband (high school sweetheart) never forgot how wonderful it was. 12 years later he still asks for this.  the only different thing i use is english muffins instead of crescent dough.  a little less calories that way.  love this dish!

There is no way could this recipe feed the no. of people claimed. For 12 it called for 4 eggs for 20 -7 eggs, no way, even for small eaters, that's not even 1 egg each.I made the one for 20 to feed 18 & I doubled the eggs & it was still no where enough food. I will use 2 1/2 doz next time. The recipe is very good & easy too & I will use it again but I will adjust the amounts. Also you don't need as much sausage as called for & forget the salt. I added chopped onion & a jalepeno & topped with salsa & I did prebake the dough in sprayed glass pans & it came out just fine never stuck..

Great base recipe, I switched a few ingredients up to accommodate what I had on hand & to reduce calories a little.  I used smoked chicken sausage sliced into half circles (this also saves time since you don't have to cook meat), sharp cheddar cheese (only 1 cup), 2 whole eggs + 2 egg whites, added chopped red pepper & red onion.  I layered the meat, veggies & cheese onto the rolls, sprinkled with garlic powder & smoked paprika then poured the egg mixture over.  I pre-cooked the crescent rolls for 5 min, & cooked the whole thing for 20 (but I think 20 min was too long, the crescents were a little burnt).  I definitely think veggies are needed, I think it would have been bland without.

I made this for a brunch and people raved about it. It was super easy and it was gobbled up as soon as it came out. People said it tasted like a sausage and egg sandwhich from McDonalds. I have also made it with sausage links (cut up into chunks) and bacon and my kids asked for 2nd helpings. Even the two who don't like eggs ate it! Now that is sucess! Great recipe.

I love this recipe. I quit using the rolls on the bottom and you barely notice unless you are really into your bread. We use monteray jack cheese instead of mozzerella and it turns out great. My kids even eat this and we add a lot of vegetables to it too.

I used lowfat Grands biscuits, low fat sharp cheddar, egg beaters (1 cup), skim milk and veggie sausage and this came out awesome. I baked the biscuits for 12 minutes on 350 before I added the rest of the ingredients and turned the temp up. It cooked about 17-19 minutes before it was done. I found it didn't need much salt in the eggs because of the other ingredients! We'll make this one again!

this has become a staple every Christmas morning for me to make at the in-laws.  I do pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes as others have suggested and I also add in some scallions for color.  Otherwise - I follow it exactly!  So easy and even the pickiest kids love it.

Delish! I prebaked the crust for 10 minutes and then baked the entire thing at 350 for addtl. 25 minutes. Simple and hearty. My kids like it that it doesn't have mushrooms, onions broccoli etc! haha! Thanks!

This turned out quite well. I baked the dough for a while first, did one pound of sausage, and used cheddar instead. Tasted really good with the hot breakfast sausage! It did take mine longer to cook than the 15 minutes instructed.

Very good and easy recipe.  Followed suggestions to bake crescents 8-10 minutes before adding other ingredients.

Very, very good.  I would not recommend pre-baking the crescent rolls.  I believe they are supposed to soak up some of the egg mixture, like other egg casseroles that use bread.  Still makes a nice pastry crust without prebaking.  I used a glass pan - maybe the type of pan used explains some of the issues mentioned in previous posts. I threw in some frozen chopped spinach (I would think you could use fresh, too) for color and nutrition.  Could barely taste it.  I used only 1 lb of sausage as that is all I had.  It seemed to be plenty.  Also used only four eggs as the recipe called for, though I was tempted to use more.  It turned out great!  Good recipe for when you don't have a lot of eggs on hand!  :-)

Everyone loved this one! The reason for the four stars is this: the baking time (15 minutes) is WAY off. Mine took at least 35 minutes to bake. I am still looking forward to making this again and experimenting with different meat/ veggie/cheese combinations!

I baked the crescent rolls for about 12 minutes before pouring the egg mixture in. I also added two more eggs to the recipe.

This was so easy and delicious! I will definately be making this again. I used a blend of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses and followed the suggestion to bake crust for 5 minutes and then to bake for 15 minutes with the remaining ingredients. Turned out very well. Thought it needed a litle more spice. Maybe serve with salsa or add some hot sauce to egg mixture next time.

I used 12oz. of sausage and omitted the salt, and the casserole still turned out quite salty! Also, I am not sure what went wrong but the consistency was a lot denser/tougher than I had expected!!

I made this for Christmas brunch. I added cilantro and green onions, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I also used six eggs and the full pound and a half of sausage. 
With the cheese on top it was hard to tell if the eggs were set, it looked completely cooked after about twenty minutes, the biscuit layer was golden brown and the cheese was completely melted, but the eggs were still runny so I cooked it another ten minutes, but really it need maybe fifteen more. It was delicious, though, I made a white gravy to go on the side. Next time I will use fewer eggs and also skip the salt, the sausage is salty enough. But I will definitely make it again, it was a big hit!

Served this for my parents for brunch...they loved it! I pre-baked the crescent rolls as suggested by other reviewers, used a combination of mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and used 5 eggs instead of 4.  I baked it in a 13x9 inch casserole dish and felt that it might have been better in maybe an 8x8 casserole so it would be thicker. Not sure how much that would affect cooking time though.  Overall it was great, would make it again.

I made 6 pans of this for a church brunch ~ primarily for 8 year olds.  It was a very easy casserole to make.  I used half cheddar and half mozzarella cheese, as well as half regular sausage and half hot sausage to give it a kick. I also used an extra egg as was suggested. It was a huge hit.  Adding to my list of favorites.

I've made this recipe for the past year.  I add 5 eggs instead of 4.  Everyone I know begs me to make this.  My stepfather asks me to make 2 pans so he can eat one and take the leftovers for lunch during the week.  My picky 8 year old nephew begged me to give the recipe to his mother.  This one is a keeper!

This was delicious! So much better with the crescent rolls than the bread. I've had trouble in the past with breakfast casseroles not being done in the middle to I cooked it about 30 minutes on 350. Thanks so much!

Think it would taste better without the crescent rolls on the bottom. Pre-cooked the crescent rolls for a few minutes, then added the egg / sausage mixture. The crescent rolls tasted hard and burnt.

This is so easy and so good!  Our work group served this to guys that were dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Wilma and they scarfed it!  They raved about the "breakfast pizza"!  You can use 2 lbs of sausage instead of 3 and it is still great.

How much easier can it get? I wanted more of an egg casserole, so I made it with 12 eggs and the right equivalent of milk. It baked for 30 minutes instead of 15(make sure you watch it, it browns fast once the eggs are done). I also used 2 cups of crumbled bacon and 2 cups of cheddar, since that's what I had on hand. Everybody wanted the recipe! :)

Very good.  QUICK AND EASY AND NEARLY FOOLPROOF!  Should use just one pound of quality sausage but no need to use crescent rolls (any roll will work)or limit yourself to just mozzarella.  I added a can of drained Rotel for tailgating at a Chiefs game and it was just right!  GO CHIEFS!!

Delicious! I made this for my family one Christmas and they all raved over how great it was.  I found it is useful to use only Pillsbury crescent roll dough.  Generic brands let the eggs leak underneath the dough, giving it a totally different taste.

Another 5-star rating here! The only change was using sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozz cheese and it was great. I imagine just about any cheese would be wonderful and would be a fun way to change up the recipe. Thanks for posting!

Wonderful and easy to make.  I used a cheddar monterey blend of cheese.  Also only used one pound of sausage.  That was plenty.  Baked in a stone baking dish and it came out perfect.  Next time I will add some peppers and onions as others have suggested just for a change.

This was so fast and simple.  I substituted six pieces of white bread (minus the crust) for the crescent rolls and I used 10 pieces of american cheese singles cut up into small squares for the mozzarella.  It was wonderful.

This was awesome! The only thing I added was diced tomatoes, green peppers and onions.  I too baked the crescent rolls approx 5 - 7 min. before adding egg mixture.
This will definitely be in our "Family Favorites"!
Thanks!

My company loved this dish!  No leftovers!  I substituted Cheddar and Monterey mix for the Mozzarella, and took the advise of another and added sautéed red and green bell peppers and a scallion.  I served with optional hot sauce and salsa.

Too much sausage and cheese!  Would make again, but like the other reviews, would cut the sausage down to 1 pound, and maybe cut down on the amount of cheese as well.  Will try with cheddar next time, and add an extra egg.  I really liked the cresent roll crust vs. other recipes that call for bread cubes.

This really was disappointing to me, but it could be the sausage I used.  I only used one pound which was more than enough, but it was Jimmy Dean hot flavor and was just too much.  Wouldn't try it again though.

We had this over the Christmas holiday and everyone loved it!  I only used about a pound of sausage.  It took a little longer to cook--the eggs weren't done, but it was well worth it.  A new favorite!!

What a delicious, quick and easy recipe.  I prepared this in advance, which worked quite nicely.  I used brown and serve sausage cut in chunks instead of the ground sausage.  I found it needed much more cooking time - about 1/2 hour.  However that could have been because I took it right out of the fridge.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was great. Very quick and easy to make and I didn't have to buy the whole store to make it. Next time I would decrease the amount of sausage. I think one pound would do it.

This was VERY good. My picky husband loved it too. I used a little less sausage than the recipe called for and I used cheddar instead of mozarella. Something a little different for breakfast. Thanks!

Everyone loved this casserole. I will definately be making it for my next book club brunch! My only complaint was the crescent roll didn't cook as well in the middle. I'm going to try cooking the rolls a bit first then adding the egg and see what happens.

Thanks for the recipe Jennifer!  I'm always looking for breakfast casseroles that don't involve grits (my husband is a "Yankee" and has never adjusted to their texture).  This recipe was easy and the results were delicious.

We loved this recipe. It was quick, easy, and delicious. My son, usually finicky, enjoyed it immensely. I have searched for the perfect brunch casserole recipe that didn't result in soggy bread. This was perfect. I would like to try it with ham sometime. Thanks!

Very good recipe!  Made it for teenager home from college and he ate every bit!!  Just need to make sure the rolls are completely done though.  Used only 2 egg yolks with the four egg whites and low fat cheese and milk.

I made this the other night and my fiance really enjoyed it. The only changes I made was I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and I also cover the top with another package of crescent rolls. It resembled a quickie pie and turned out quite nice. Great for a quickie meal or a freezer meal if you do that kind of thing.

Added two extra eggs, some seasoning to the sausage, and precooked the crescent rolls for a few minutes before adding egg mixture. Pretty good!

This was such an easy recipe. I followed the tips of the many other reviewer‘s. I used six eggs  and I c of milk and baked my crescent rolls for 10 minutes at 425° first. I baked it an additional 30 minutes at 425 and it was perfect just like the picture.  I used a combination of cheddar and Swiss since that is what I had on hand and I used the pre-cooked Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles.

I tried this recipe and it was pretty good.  I made a few changes to the original.  
I used a cup of cheddar and a cup of mozzarella/parmesan blend, 6 eggs, a bit of diced pickled jalapeno, a cup of milk and only 1lb of breakfast sausage.  My can of crescent rolls was 12oz and I baked them for six minutes at 350 before adding the egg mixture.  I baked it for 25 minutes at 425.  It was a bit dry and the crescent rolls are too thick, so next time I would probably roll them thin and cook them for a bit less before adding the mixture.  I would also add onions and peppers and more jalapeno, maybe even some bacon or ham.   I think this is a good base recipe to add to and tweak - I'll make it again for sure.

To be fair, I did not use sausage with this, as I had some leftover ham. I used a cooking spray for the pan and extended the cooking time for about 25 minutes, per some of the other reviews. The bottom of the crescent rolls burned a bit, as I was waiting for the eggs to fully cook. I found the balance between not burning the bottom pastry and cooking the egg all the way through to be a delicate balance. Next time I think I'll use an actual oil/fat to grease the pan and pre-bake the pastry a bit (even though it wasn't soggy in mine), just to see if it makes any difference. And I'll actually try it with sausage.

Flavor was spot on, though. Everyone enjoyed it and we only have 3 little slivers of the casserole left. I'm thinking about making little crescent rolls cups for a quick heat up breakkie and using some Tony Chachere's for a little kick.

Like many other reviewers mentioned, I pre-baked the roll dough for 5 minutes at 350 and then I also doubled the eggs and milk to give it more substance.  I did have to bake it longer, but it came out wonderful!

With the holidays coming up I wanted to try a new breakfast casserole and I always do a trial run. As written this is so bland and nothing I can look forward to in the holiday morning. With many changes it has potential to be fantastic but that's not this recipe. Oh and why doesn't anyone on this site rate the actual recipe anymore? I see lots of people giving 4-5 stars after a bunch of changes. Anyway, this recipe needs something other than false 5 star reviews. Flavor is one. Start with some dry mustard.

I followed this recipe as written and it was  kind of bland in mine and my family's opinion.  It wasn't bad.  We did end up putting a little salsa on top of the left overs and that helped give it a little more flavor.

I thought this was just OK. I've had much better breakfast casseroles. It could be better if you spiced it up with additional ingredients and seasonings.

Delicious! I used 4 low-fat crescent rolls in an 8x8 pan (there were only 3 of us eating it), and used 3 eggs and cheddar cheese. I too baked the crescent rolls for 5 minutes on 425 before addding the toppings. The best modification I made was using Jimmy Dean Fully Cooked Turkey Sausage Crumbles. It was so quick, easy, no mess, 60% less fat than pork sausage, and it tasted great!

This was an awesome base recipe. You can tweak it to your tastes and likes. As others suggested baked the crescent crust for about 10 minutes before adding egg mixture. Used 10 eggs, 1 pound of Jimmy Dean sausage, 1 cup of cheddar jack cheese and 3/4 cup of milk. Kids are already requesting ingredients to go in the next one!

Turned out really good.  I put half of the rolls on bottom and cooked then added other ingredients then topped with remaining rolls. I also only used 1/2 lb of sausage and I added green onion to my sausage as it was cooking.  I only used 1/2 cup of milk.  Next time I will bake until almost done then add the rolls on top.

This was a somewhat simple recipe, in a large genre, but I nevertheless liked it lot. So many breakfast things like this use cheddar cheese, and I was nicely surprised by the use of mozzarella here. I like both, but the mozzarella melted well and tasted great. One minor note: after 15 minutes there was still some runniness on the top of the dish, so I baked 3 more minutes. Even then there was still a little. Maybe I didn't stir things well enough before putting it in the oven? No big deal, though. I enjoyed this for a number of breakfasts in a row.

Quick & easy. Just a couple of tweaks based on previous reviews. . I pre baked the crust for 5 minutes and added cayenne pepper and italian seasonings to the salt & pepper. I also used a combination of cheddar & mozzarella cheeses and served it with salsa.  It was a big hit.

One of my co-workers brought it in to work for our monthly birthday celebration; It was excellent.  I could not get enough.  Anyway I made it Saturday morning for my son; I sprayed the aluminum pan with Pam but the crescent rolls stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I will make again but this time I will use a glass casserole dish.  I will give it a little more spice with some saute onions and red peppers.  A friend of mine suggested that instead of the crescent rolls to use hash browns.  She said to make sure they are thawed, drain any excess water and place them on the bottom as you would the crescent rolls.  Yum, yum!!

This is a brunch/breakfast must. I have made this many times, sometimes doing less sausage and sometimes more. Either way it is always great.

Very good! I, too, had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. Maybe next time I will rinse the sausage also. It was pretty greasy while cooking. I was happy to see that the amount of grease lessened as it cooled.

I tried this one out and have to say it is good, but maybe not great.  Considering all the great reviews, perhaps I was having an off day and not the recipe.  I do know I will try it again though.

I made this dish for Sunday brunch.   It was GREAT!!  I reduced the sausage to 1 pound and while making it realized I WAS OUT OF MILK... but I had some butter milk on hand and dediced to take a chance and use it.  The flavor was GREAT.  I prebaked the dough as may other people stated in their reviews. I love recipe it's simple and flexable.

Maybe use ham instead or make very small pieces of sausage.  Needs to cook longer than 15 minutes to set up center.

Ok this recipe is a great starter, but you need to make the changes that others suggest to make it great. Cook the cresent rolls  about 5-7 min before you add the other ingred, also you may need to add a few more eggs. Also I added tea of mustard powder. Everyone loved it and had my mom asking for the rescipe. :)

I baked it in a stone dish, therefore omiting greasing the pan.

I REALLY LIKED THIS!  USED PILLSBURY ROLLS, AND THEY GIVE A SLIGHTLY SWEET TASTE.  TOOK ADVICE OF OTHERS, AND BAKED ROLLS FOR 5 MINUTES BEFORE ADDING OTHER INGREDIENTS.  USED 1 LB MILD SAUSAGE, AND 1/2 LB MAPLE SAUSAGE.  THUMBS UP TO YOU JENNIFER!!!!

This had a wonderful taste. I'll definitely make it again. I also baked my crescent dough for 5 minutes beforehand. The only slight problem I noticed was that the bottom crust was a little crispy. Maybe if cooked on 400 instead, it would work a little better.

This is wonderful! All that ate it up (quickly) raved about it and asked for the recipe. Actually asked me to bring it in another day, as well! I put the crescents in the pan first for only 5 minutes to start the baking on them and they were beautiful in my Demarle pan as they were just popped out of the pan and stood up on it's own like a cake! Very nice presentation....wonderful eattin'....thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!!  I've made it twice now with just a few changes.  I used light sausage, reduced fat crescent rolls and skim milk.  I followed others suggestions to bake the crescent rolls for 10 minutes before pouring everything else in.  I added a few chopped green onions and some cajun seasoning (I've found this is good on almost anything!).  I also used 6 eggs and about 1+ cup of milk to make it fluffier.  Out of the oven, I sprinkled with cheese and let cool a little.  It was easy to pick up and eat like this because the crust was crispy!  My boyfriend loves it and has requested it again soon.  Great recipe!  :-)

I made this for my husband but ended up loving it myself to.  He rarely says somethings "great" but this time he loved it.  It's even good as a left over.

My husband made a face when I told him we were having this, but after one bite he said this is AWESOME.  Very quick and easy to put together, and was a hit.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good and very easy.  I actually added another egg to the mixture, thinking it didn't look like enough when I poured it into the dish, but I imagine it would have been fine like it was written.  I also added a touch of garlic powder and a little parsley/italian seasonings.  My kids loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made a similar recipe before. This one was liked better by my family. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Enjoyed very much!

Great for High School Graduation Brunch!  I added green onions and used cheddar cheese instead of the mozzarella cheese.  I also used only one pound of sausage.  My daughter and her friends just loved it!!

This was pretty good, but if I make it again I would use less sausage, add green onion and mushrooms.

I made this for Mother's day brunch. It sounded good, and I followed other suggestions about baking the dough for 5 minutes ahead. I also added more eggs, because it seemed like a lot of sausage and I was feeding more people. It ended up with hard crust on the bottom. People just scraped the eggs off the crust and ate that part. I would go with one of the regular bread recipes for this kind of dish. It would make a good Atkins diet dish if you left out the crescent rolls...Thanks anyway

This was quick and easy!  Rather than sausage, I tore up a few pieces of bacon (already cooked) and added those to the egg mixture.  It turned out great!  I was also pleasantly surprised that this made a great left over to heat up in a hurry.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I made it as directed and my son said, "Mom, this just tastes like sausage." I'll probably try again since I love make-ahead recipes and experiment with different kinds and amounts of sausage.
