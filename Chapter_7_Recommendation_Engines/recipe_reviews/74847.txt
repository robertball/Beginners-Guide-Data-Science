Green beans pick up a "tinney" from the can.  Avoid this by opening the can, draining the water, rinse the beans still in the can,  put a tablespoon of A&H baking soda in the can and add water.  Let this soak while you do other things, then rinse the beans in the can, and continue your preparation.   This works for other canned vegetables.

I made this tonight and was not very pleased. We are olive lovers, but found this tasted like salty canned green beans. Pretty lackluster results...

This was tasty. I marinated for about an hour, used some cocktail onions I had in the fridge instead of the red onions, and added some fresh minced garlic. You def need to really like olives for this recipe, I do, we thought it was AWESOME!!
