Great tasting and easy dinner. I use regular spaghetti sauce and add cream, rather than use jarred Alfredo. Also I use chicken cutlets to make them nice and thin. Definitely a keeper!

This was a quick and easy dish.  My kids loved it!  I omitted mushrooms because we dont like them.  It is great family meal as well as a dish you can serve to guests!

This was absolutely delicious!! It tasted like something you would order at Olive Garden! I only made a few tweaks to the recipe. I lightly seasoned the chicken with Accent and seasoning salt before dipping it in the egg batter. Also, for the two jars of alfredo sauce, I used one classic and one roasted garlic. I also added italian seasoning to the sauce mixture. The changes I made were small but overall this is a very tasty dish.

I tweaked the recipe and it was a hit.  I had cooked chicken on hand so I  got water for the pasta going and started with step #9.  I didn't use the egg whites, tomato sauce, or crust the chicken in Parmesan cheese.  I used only 1 jar of Alfredo sauce plus added an Alfredo jar of milk. Each person added their desired amount of freshly grated Parmesan at the table.

This was one of the best recipes I have found on this website! The sauce was incredibly delicious and the Italian Style Tomatoes were perfect.  I'll be making this again for sure!

I have no idea why this had so many good reviews. I thought it was awful and it makes about 10 times the amount of sauce you need. Total waste.

I made this recipe last night, and used the adjustment to feed four people.  Our family (including two teens) LOVED it!!  Rave reviews from my hubby too.  I followed the recipe as it is, and it was delicious.  Will definitely be making again...soon!!

This was delicious but I did not use store-bought jarred Alfredo sauce because the stuff is just awful in my opinion. I don't know why anyone buys it when the real thing is so easy to make at home. I followed the recipe but made my own parmesan white sauce, then added the other ingredients to it. The sauce turned out sooo good! Its our new favorite and we make it all the time to have with pasta. Next time I'll probably chop the spinach to avoid the large clumps I got. This one's going in our recipe binder!

I made the recipe exactly as it was written, and I thought it was very good! Just a warning, this recipe could feed an army!! 4 of us ate and there is easily enough leftover for 2 more meals.  Not a bad thing, I just wasn't prepared for that.

WOW! So yummy. I made a homemade alfredo sauce (6 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 minced shallot, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper). I would recommend slicing the chicken breast before coating and using portabello mushrooms. I sauteed the fresh spinach in a little olive oil. ENJOY!

This was wonderful- everybody in the family loved it. I did make 2 very small revisions. I sauteed the mushrooms and spinach in a little olive oil with garlic. I also substituted a can of rotel tomatoes for the italian and cut back on the red pepper. Will add this to our regular rotation!!

This was excellent, a perfect dinner for a busy worknight.  I made it for two, so I cut back on several ingredients.  Served with a ceasar salad and a crusty bread, it was perfect!

Made it for the 22 of us at Engine 42's firehouse in downtown Chicago.  It's hard to get all 22 on the same page when it comes to food but this one was a hit!

I tweaked the recipe and it was a hit. I had brined the chicken 3hrs. Made for a really tasty and tender chicken..
Rinse after brining and pat chicken dry. Then onto dipping chicken into egg whites..

This is a really good dish. The only difference i made the 2nd time around was to use thin spagetti and I actually like it better that way now.

We will be making it again. It was delicious! 

Made some alterations to this to keep cost down and save time. Did not coat chicken in egg whites and parmesan cheese. Just lightly sprinkled it with parmesan cheese and baked in oven. Did not buy parmesan cheese to grate, just used the Kraft stuff and added to our own serving not the whole dish. Added a pinch of onion powder, thyme, oregano, and basil. I think we added more mushrooms and chicken than recipe called for. And used bowtie noodles bc we didn't have penne.

I love this recipe! The only thing I did differently is I fried the chicken very lightly before placing it to bake. By doing so, it helped the cheese stick to the chicken and it gave the outer layer of the chicken a nice texture and color.

While this dish was very tasty, it wasn't what I was looking for. It didn't taste like Noodle & Co's penne rosa, but was still tasty nonetheless. Also, this recipe as written is enough for more than 10 ppl. I halved it and still managed to have 5-6 servings.

Very tasty and easy!  Took another reader's suggestion and made homemade alfredo (super easy) and added red pepper with the mushrooms and spinach.   Did not have any eggs, so I dipped the chicken breasts in mayo, then the parm cheese.  Everyone loved it! Nice bit of spice!  Will def make again!

This was a great quick to make recipe.  I used whole wheat penne pasta and instead of diced tomatoes I sliced cherry tomatoes in half and used those.  I also only used a single jar of alfredo sauce which turned out to cover the pasta nicely.  Family and kid loved it.

Pretty close to the real thing but needs more spice in the sauce next time.  Also, two full jars of alfredo seems like overkill - recipe makes way too much sauce. Otherwise,  not bad and not difficult. I live in an area where I no longer have Noodles & Co so this hits the spot when the cravings set in.

Excellent! I switched it up just a bit by taking out the mushrooms and spinach (family not a fan) and added a side of green beans. So very good and simple.

Covered the chicken in all the 2 cups of parmesan, thickened up the sauce, & used ½ teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead & loved it! (might be too spicy for mom though) Also, make sure to completely drain the diced tomatoes, otherwise it’ll take longer for the sauce to thicken up.

My family really liked this recipe and I appreciated how easy it was to prep by using a jar of Alfredo. I did marinate the chicken for a few hours ahead of time and pounded it so it would cook more evenly.

Really delicious! The only thing I changed was that I substituted the parmesan for asiago (much cheaper with similar flavor profile) and added a full tsp of red pepper flakes.

This recipe made A LOT more sauce then what was necessary though. I recommend either doubling the pasta or halving the sauce.

Great dish did the chicken as instructed i only added garlic salt before and after the egg dip. And instead of the tomatoes spinach and red flakes i added bacon. Turned it into a Chicken Alfredo with Parmesan Chicken ??

This recipe was a perfect, spring of the moment dish to put together for my company. Instead of jarred Alfredo I used heavy cream, a touch of chicken broth, and homemade tomato sauce with flour to thicken up the sauce. I substituted cauliflower, 3 tomatoes, 1 jalapeño and haberno instead of mushrooms. Also used bread crumbs and parmesean for the baked chicken! With following those tweaks, it was delicious!

a little note- I fried up zuchinni and made a fruit salad to pair!

Best Penne Rose I've ever eaten.  It does make a lot, so I froze the remaining sauce to use later!

This is absolutely amazing! Italian restaurant taste without the cost! I put basil and oregano in the mix since I had plain diced tomatoes on hand.

To make it healthier, I did two cans of tomato sauce with spices added and 1 jar of light alfredo sauce. It tastes just as good and is more than half the calories! I also added minced garlic and did not add parmesan cheese in the sauce. I just sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top onto an individual serving.

I thought this recipe was great! I've tried making penne rosa before, but it never turned out the way I wanted. I decided to season the chicken breasts with a little salt and pepper before dipping them into the egg whites. I also used a little olive oil, salt and pepper when cooking the mushrooms and spinach. Overall, a delicious outcome!

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I only used 1 jar of alfredo and 1 jar of tomato sauce and omitted the can of diced tomatoes. I also sprinkled adobo on the chicken before dipping in the egg whites and sauteed the vegetables in garlic. I also doubled the amount of red pepper because my husband and I love it. Great and easy recipe!

Great recipe, very easy to make and tasty!  I halved the recipe and still had enough for 3 large portions. I amped up the pepper flakes to suit our tastes, but made no other changes.

This is delicious.  Very easy to make.  Made it ahead of time and put everything into the crock pot set on low to serve to guests several hours later.  I cooked a sliced red bell pepper with the mushrooms/spinach and it complimented the taste very well.

Yum!  This was really good, although I might make chicken parmesan the traditional way and pan fry it with the egg wash and bread crumbs next time.  Hubby loved this!

I think I would like the sauce a little thicker, and we added more mushrooms.  Maybe a little more italian seasoning of some kind.  Very good - kids loved it!!

This was a quick, fantastic recipe! It was fast and easy. The spice was perfect with the red pepper.
