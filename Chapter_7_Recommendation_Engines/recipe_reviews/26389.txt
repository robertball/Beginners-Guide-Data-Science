I thought this was really good chili. It's sweet and mild which is what I like. This tastes very similar to my mom's chili recipe. I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and scaled the amount of meat way back I used only a half pound of ground chuck and thought that was plenty. I will make this again. It was simple enough and tasty enough.

I thought this wonderful and My husband loved it too!! I didn't have any french onion soup and the weather was too nasty to go out so I chopped an onion and used beef broth instead. Also add a can of tomatoes. We will sure have this again!!

I made this last week and Hubby & I both love it. The only thing I changed was I added 2 cans of crush tomatoes 28oz cans. We just can't eat as spicy of foods as we used to.. It is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing. Jazzie..

Fantastic chili! It's fast and easy and ready once it's heated up. I made it twice last week with cornbread. I used a little more chili powder and cocoa than the recipe calls for the second time around. Letting it simmer for an hour improves the flavor even more and I found that it actually tasted better the second day heated up in the microwave.

I used deer meat in this recipe instead of beef. It was delicious! And very easy to make. The most appealing ingredient of this recipe is the liquified onion soup it added a awesome flavor.

Yuk! I was disappointed in this recipe. It was bland bland bland. I added sooo much more chili powder and cumin. Heck I even added some brown sugar. It just was not what I was expecting.

This is a great recipe to have if you're looking for something slightly different than your original chili. It tastes great! I always turn to this recipe now!

I did have to thicken it up with some cornmeal but that's because I only used one pound of hamburger.

I loved it! The Cocoa and cola really add great flavor and depth to this dish. Now I did add a jalapeno bell pepper and a cup of beef broth as I let it cook for a while longer than stated. Something came up. Great recipe!
