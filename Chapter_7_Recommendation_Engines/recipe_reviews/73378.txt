Slightly healthier? Actually it is slightly more unhealthy. IT has 506 calories, 217mg of cholesterol  1774 mg of sodium,  and 67 grams of carbs.   The name should have been slightly tastier ramen noodles.

this is a great start.  We omit the water and seasoning packet and replace with a low sodium broth...flavor of choice.  Super easy for the teenagers and better than plaine old ramen noodles.  Enjoy

Add a cheese slice. In Korea they call it, "Chesseh Ramen." It also takes away some of the spiciness of traditional Ramen. Delicious!

Really good! I used frozen vegetables (peas and green beans), which cut another five minutes off the already incredibly short prep time. I also added a dash of sesame oil and ~teaspoon of minced garlic, which added a ton of flavor.

I thought the addition of the small amount of milk at the end changed the broth from tasting like just "plain" ramen noodle soup into a well seasoned, tastier soup.  Perhaps a garnish of green onion would be a nice touch?

Much better than plain old ramen noodles. I omitted the milk and added some chopped spinach. Thanks for the post.

this is so good, we make it all the time and sometimes add other veggies. it's easy and good, i like to add the seasoning a little later though because other ways you can't really taste it.

I've made ramen this way for a long time but also use other veggies sometimes (i.e. sliced napa cabbage, zucchini, chopped green onions (added after the egg), store bought kimchi).  Still very full of yummy sodium (lol) but much healthier with all the veggies and eggs added :)
