This recipe turned out great! I'll submit a photo if the picture turns out as well... Altered the recipe a bit though after reading the other reviews: Used butter flavored shortening (and a little extra) instead of plain ol' shortening; put in a little over a Tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons... I think that the butter flavored shortening helped tone down any extra floury taste.  I also had to cook it a little longer than suggested.  Was a hit at work and at home... Even with the adjustments, would recommend eating with a favorite beverage on hand (mine turned out a tad bit dry the first time... second time, though, PERFECT!)  Thank you!

I took this to a pot luck gathering and it was a hit! I doubled the recipe to make thicker slices and used a 9x13 glass pan. I baked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect timing.

This recipe is tasty but a bit on the dry side.  I doubled the cake ingredients to get a thicker cake and used chopped walnuts in place of pecan.  When doubling I used 1/4 c shortening and 1/4 cup margarine.  I also cooked it for 35 mins since I doubled.  Think I will try 30 mins next time and all margarine instead of shortening.   UPDATE: Doubled recipe again but used 1/2 cup margarine (no shortening) and 1 tsp vanilla and baked it for 35 minutes.  Came out less dry this time.

This was easy to make! I realized that I forgot the cinnamon so that's why it tasted different. I baked it 5 minutes longer to make sure it was done and the bottom got a little tough. Will make this again.

If you eat this cake straight out of the oven you probably won't have any leftover.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this so very much.

Just like mom use to make! I also left the cake in the oven for 2 minutes more and it was too long. The timing is perfect. I would just use a smaller pan so the cake will be thicker. This is the coffee cake that I had been looking for. Thank you!

Since the contributor stated that it was an old recipe and  several comments mentioned it turned out dry, I made sure to sift the flour.  I also used all butter for the shortening and put pecan halves on top.  It was a hit at our German Potluck.  One person said it was just like his mother used to make. Delicious and a keeper.

This is so good and it is easy to hold in your hand. I put whipped topping on it and it made everything better. It does taste like flour if you have a little crumb, but overall, it was really easy to make and my family loved it. We ate half the pan before I could take a photo!( I had no idea what this was before i made it and I and surely gonna save the recipie and make it again!)

I didn't have crisp so used vegetable oil.  Not dry.  I would prefer more pecans, but overall very good.

My family LOVES this! Our new son-in-law says it's the best dessert he's ever had! After reading the reviews, I doubled the recipe, used real butter (no shortening), added 2 tsp. vanilla and cooked almost 30 minutes. The first time I made it, I didn't have any white sugar...I substituted brown sugar and it was delicious! Had almost a shortbread taste to it.

I added fresh chopped pears from the tree to the top of the cake and then added the streusel.  I mixed the pears with some flour, cinnamon, and vanilla sugar ( something we have here in Germany).  This cake is delicious.

Everyone loved this at Easter. I did not add the pecans though. I had to experiment with the topping to get the right consistency I was looking for that would be similar to the kuchen we used to get from a local bakery.
