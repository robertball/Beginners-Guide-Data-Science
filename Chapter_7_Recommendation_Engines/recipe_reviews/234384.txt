This really was a quick, easy, & light dessert.  It is perfect for last minute guests or a weeknight dessert when you are craving something sweet but don't want to go to overboard on the calories.  I used light lemon yogurt & light cool-whip.  I am sure it would be even more wonderful with a homeade angel food cake, but, the ease of using a good store bought cake is what makes this such a simple dessert to make.  The "icing" is light and fluffy and reminds me of a fruit dip. It would be very easy to switch the flavor of the icing using different flavors of yogurt.  I think next time instead of icing I would just top the sliced cake with the fluff and some fresh fruit. Thanks, Perri!

Made this for a quick dessert for a family get together.  Used    strawberry yogurt.  Decorated the cake with a quart of strawberries, cut in half & put around the top & bottom of the cake!  Very light & delicious dessert with minimal kitchen time.  My kind of recipe!!!

Fantastic , super easy, and substitutions work great!  Didn't have vanilla pudding so I used lemon and only had lemon cream pie yogurt not plain lemon.  Family loved it!

Love this easy cake. I changed the lemon yogurt to vanilla and added chocolate drizzle with fresh raspberries. It's a light and yummy dessert and not overly sweet.

I made this exactly as directed.  It looked lovely, but I really didn’t like the frosting -  it was very thick and sweet.  Don’t think it comes anywhere a 5 rating.   I would never make this again.
