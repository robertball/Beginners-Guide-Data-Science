I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka and homemade irish cream in this drink. Though this is sweet, I enjoyed it. This really is more of a dessert cocktail as in skip dessert and enjoy this.

I like this drink.  It reminded me of a B52 with a hint of mint.  I didn't have half and half so I used half whipping cream and half 2% milk.  Tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Hands down our new summer favorite beverage.  I've made this five different nights over a month, often at the request of DH!  Looks pretty too.  Thanks Bethany!

Pretty good drink.  Reminded me of a Shamrock shake.  Probably wouldn't make it other than St. Pattys day.
