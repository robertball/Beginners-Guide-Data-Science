I love this recipe because its healthy and I had most of the ingredients. I made a few changes though. I oiled the pan with olive oil which I was glad about because the slices were a little  sticky to pan. I simply sliced the eggplant , dipped them in egg then parmesan cheese and seasoned with garlic. Then baked til golden brown then topped with sauce and more parmesan cheese. I love this simple recipe. The meal was sooo yummy. Ill definitely use this recipe again. Thank you so much.

Yum! I used Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs instead of the wheat germ. Delish.

This was really a hit...DH who prefers a meal with meat, even said it was good enough as a main dish! I have been making eggplant parmesan for years and love it, but it is a lot of work and time consuming. This was just as good and so much quicker & easier to prepare! Loved the crispy coating and the spicy sauce! I did cover my baking pan with tin foil and sprayed w/ olive oil to prevent sticking. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe....will be making this a lot!!!

I followed the steps for the eggplant slices, baked the eggplant for 5 minutes on each side and then layered the ingredients in a pan. I baked for 35 minutes. It was delicious! My husband thought the eggplant was fried and complimented me on such a nice job. My 22 month old twins even ate it - minus the cayenne pepper, of course.

This was very good. The wheat germ was a nice coating. I also made it into a casserole dish and served over spaghetti.

I've never tried making anything like Eggplant Parm. before but liked that this was baked not fried and came out great. I think I used a mix of wheat germ and ground flax seed as the breading - it gave the dish a slightly nutty taste, which I liked - kudos -  good and healthy recipe!

I thought this was pretty good & super easy. I will make again. It doesn't really compare with fried eggplant parm but it's a great alternative for a lighter meal.

The family ate it and that says a lot because usually they will only eat eggplant fried in a TON of grease and breadcrumbs.

This was very good!  I was looking for a healthy eggplant recipe for items I had on hand and this completely worked.  I did have more egg mixture and parm cheese mixture than I needed, but maybe I just had a smaller eggplant.  I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting my own spaghetti sauce.  We served with spaghetti on the side, and my son and husband argued with me that it was fried!  We will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe!!! I told my husband this was Eggplant Parmesan and he LOVED it! We both loved it! The only thing I did differently (and let me reiterate, it is great exactly as the recipe states) was that I took the sauce and covered the egg plant with it and then topped it with provolone cheese and cooked it for an additional 15 minutes. Either way... GOOD STUFF!!! The wheat germ is a GREAT idea!!! Thanks so much!

Very good!  I was surprised how good the wheat germ breading tasted!  Used my own spaghetti sauce.  Served over whole wheat noodes.  My husband loved it...and he is not a fan of eggplant.  I would suggest brushing the cookie sheet with olive oil...they tend to stick (even to my non-stick pan).

I was surprised that the wheat germ actually worked well as breading.I also added 1 skinless/boneless chicken breast for added protein and since there was still a bunch of wheat breading left,I figured I'd might as well use it up. I was also too much egg,even after the chicken was coated.I made my own marinara sauce for this dish and it was great!

Yum! The cayenne pepper was a bit much, but if you like spicy you will love this. I had to keep a small amount of tomato sauce on side without the cayenne for my 5 yr old son.  For him, I added a little tarragon to his wheat germ and chz and the tomato sauce.  It was yummy too.  I served over a bed of Basmati rice (cooked with a few cracked cardamom pods).  My husband and I loved it.  We ended up finishing it all off the next day for lunch.

I love this recipe and make it just as the recipe calls for the eggplant. I use a homemade sauce instead of the jar stuff. This is one my entire family will eat. Yummy!
UPDATE: I have started making this recipe healthier by using flax eggs instead of chicken eggs and I use nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan  cheese, I am dairy free so I don't use any cheese now. Now I use an oil free jar sauce as well. It is still very much a favorite in my house!

This was DELICIOUS!
The only change I made was to make my own pasta sauce (with the addition of cayene). This is so good and I think it would be tasty to make the eggplant, then serve the eggplant with toothpicks and pasta/cayene as dipping sauce for an appetizer at a party.
Will definitely make again!
Thanks for a great, healthy recipe.

This was awesome. I baked my egplant on a rack on a cookie sheet and they were crispy on both sides. I'll definitely make this again, if not weekly ;)

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  Not a big eggplant fan, but I had 3 small eggplants about to go bad in my fridge, so I tried this... and am SOOOOO glad I did!  My kids yummed it up, my husband (notoriously picky eater), said he could have just eaten them straight like chips and I thought the same.  Served it tonight with pasta and P.N's "Sockarooni" sauce (minus added spice) and will definitely be making this again and again.  And again. *grin*  Thanks so much!

This is delicious!!!  My husband and I loved it :)
I used olive oil to grease the baking sheet as others suggested, and used Ragu Light No Sugar Added Tomato and Basil sauce, and added chopped up veggies to the sauce.  Great recipe!

This was a bit bland.  I tried to revive it by pouring the sauce over the eggplant and melting the cheese in the broiler.  Served over angel hair.

This was so fast and easy to make.  A little spicy though... I would probably add a little less red pepper.  But I passed this recipe on to friends and family and everyone has loved it.  I thought it was great as the main dish and served it with steamed veggies.  I am definitely making this again.

Tasty, cripsy and hearty enough to stand alone as a meal!  I used 1 tbsp crushed red pepper instead of 1 tsp cayenne and it still gave some kick.  Awesome recipe!

I really liked this. I'm a giant fan of eggplant parmesan, and this is a healthy alternative. I will admit that I used some sauce that my mom made, and she is a legit chef. But next time, without my mom's help, I will find a marinara recipe online. Just say no to Prego!

Selected this recipe for a healthier way of oven baking the eggplant rather than frying it. Scaled up ingredients using 3 lbs. eggplant (3 medium) and doubling everything else related to preparing the eggplant. Added 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning to the 2 cups of Parmesan cheese/wheat germ breading. Lightly misted each breaded side with olive oil. Baked 13 minutes on one side, and flipped over for another 10 minutes. They were crispy, nicely browned on each side, and the cheese/wheat germ breading was tasty. Will use this oven method in future but may try other breading mixes simply for variety. Rather than top each eggplant slice with sauce and cheese, made a 9" x 13" casserole similar to “Eggplant Parmesan with Fresh Basil and Smoked Mozzarella” on this site. This produced the best of both recipes with crispy, tasty, and not greasy eggplant slices in a very yummy tomato basil sauce topped with smoky cheese.

Delicious and totally easy. I used a sweet basil pasta sauce and added garlic, oregano, chopped onion and a dash of thyme. I served it with spaghetti. I LOVED it, and will definitely make it again. I also added a little extra shredded parmesan cheese on top of the breaded eggplant right before putting it in the oven. So good.

I love this recipe...the first time I made it exactly as written and really enjoyed it. For my taste, I was looking for more of a finger food type of recipe so this time I did 3 eggplants, I increased the ratio of Parmesean to wheat germ, added some garlic powder and cayennne. This is perfect for me, I will omit the sauce this time, but I may add a side of Bill's Seasoned Ketchup (recipe on here) for dipping.Also, if you can, buy your wheat germ in bulk, I only paid a fraction of the regular store price!

Fantastic.  I cut the cayenne pepper amount in half so it would be milder for my children:)

Yum, yum, yum!  I'll admit that I did not use wheat germ, I used panko crumbs instead and I definitely did not measure my spices, but this is a great base recipe and we loved it over some pasta with a salad and bottle of wine :)

This is my new favorite way to prepare eggplant. It's fast, easy, and healthy. I made my own sauce and added the cayenne to get the right heat. I didn't have wheat germ, so I used half ground flax and half chickpea flour. This recipe is better than eggplant parmesan I've ordered in many different restaurants.

My 21 year old granddaughter made this for dinner tonight.  She didn't have any wheat germ and use bread crumbs.  It was delicious.  She is becoming quite the cook.

Made as directed only substituting egg whites for the egg and milk. Best baked eggplant method I've found so far. The breading adhered outstandingly well and did not become soggy even when cooled. This would also be great dipped into tzatziki or for baked zucchini fries.

Very healthy way to make eggplant. I used panko bread crumbs because I did not have any wheat germ. To the bread crumbs I also added Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder.  I made some slices extra thin for dipping in sauce like fried zucchini and other thicker to serve with motz cheese and past sauce. Tip: To get the eggplant extra crispy, spray the baking sheet and the tops with olive oil.  You can even put in the broiler with the sauce and cheese to melt.

This was fabulous. My family was fighting over the 3 leftovers the next day.  It was a little spicey. I'll cut back on the cayenne pepper using 3/4 tsp next time.  Makes a great appetizer.

This will become a staple at our house. I didn't have wheat germ so I used plain bread crumbs and seasoned with basil, parsley, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes. My husband RAVED about it and my 3 year old even ate it!

Delicious and easy little baked eggplant recipe. Using the wheat germ and parmesan mix surprisingly made for a wonderful and nutritious breadcrumb coating. I loved the way that the cayenne pepper brought warmness to the sauce. Loved it!

I can't review the exact recipe as listed, but I will say that it helped me figure out what to do with the eggplant I got in a CSA basket one week. I am a "novice" cook and this was really easy. I followed all the directions but swapped out the wheat germ for bread crumbs, the eggs and milk for plain greek yogurt, the mozzarella for fresh grated cheddar, and cut the cayenne pepper in half. Although altered from the original, I thought they were great!! Reminded me of mini eggplant pizzas.

I followed the recipe except used two of the other comments...Used bread crumbs instead of wheat germ and turned the baked eggplant after five minutes and made individual casseroles for the family instead of one big casserole...actually probably put in too much cayenne pepper and cut it with just a touch of sugar...Fabulous and healthy!!  Major fav at my house..

This was a great recipe and so easy to make! (My first experience with egg plant) I skipped the salting step and used my homemade spaghetti sauce which is spicy and it was a great mix. My husband loved it and asked me to make it again:)

This was really good, and very crispy.  My wheat germ had gone bad so I used panko crumbs, but I can't wait to try it per the recipe.

I do a lot of cooking, but eggplant has always stumped me.  Well, I found this recipe and tried and I can say with certainty I will be making this for years to come.  The only thing I did was change mozzarella to goat cheese as it is easier to get where I live.  Fantastic recipe!

I didn't have mozzarella so I shredded some mild cheddar. Still came out fantastic! Everyone loved it.
