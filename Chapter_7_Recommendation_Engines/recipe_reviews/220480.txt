Absolutely delicious, addictive, and easy  to make! Batter is thick but bakes up light with great texture. My fiancee actually found this recipe and started it- i hesitated because of the lack of reviews. I am SO glad he convinced me to make this. We have made it 3 times in 3 days adding brown sugar, raisins, and walnuts. You will not be disappointed!

All I can say is wow.  It had a great taste and was very simple to make.  The only precaution I would add is to make sure you have a strong mixer for this recipe.  The batter is pretty thick and mine was having a bit of trouble blending the ingredients.

Very delicious!  I just made the cake and couldn't wait to try it.  My husband loved it also.  My cake came out moist but dense.  I actually beat the oil, sugar and eggs together first, then added all the other ingredients.  I am going to try this recipe again as suggested and just mix everything all at once.  I wonder if that will make the difference.  Anyways, Adam, this is a wonderful cake and I will continue to make it on a regualr basis.  Thanks again for a delicious recipe!

For the apples, I used 2 granny smith and 2 macintosh, coarsely chopped. The batter was thick and sticky. At times, I wished I had a electric mixer. I baked some in a big muffin pan and the rest in a souffle dish. Baked time was 45-50 minutes. Both turned out well. The only difference was that muffins had chunks of apples on the top. Thanks for sharing, Adam. I'm going to use this recipe to make it a Thank-You gift for baby shower.

Just baked this cake late yesterday.  Followed the recipe except, while I was peeling and coring the apples, I poured some pasteurized orange juice (not from concentrate if that matters) over the cut apples (2 large Gala and 3 small Rome) to keep them from browning (about 3/4 to a cup) while I finished preparing the rest of the apples.  Once finished with the apples, started mixing the dry and wet ingredients. The batter came out very crumbly, so I poured some of the juice from the prepared apples into the batter to make it come together (MUCH better).  Folded in the rest of the juicy apples and poured into glass baking dish (9x13) sprayed with baker's joy.  Used a silicon spatula to push any protruding apples down into the batter and put in the oven for one hour.  I AM NOT a baker normally, but this cake is AWESOME!!!  The hardest part is preparing the apples but it's DEFINITELY worth the effort.  I'll be making this again and again!  Thanks to the poster and all the previous reviewers. This cake tastes like the Jewish apple cake my late mother used to make...thanks for the fond memories!

Amazing!!! I did make a few changes to make it more moist though. I added 4 TBL of sour cream and used 5 apples. **** It only needed 50 minutes of cooking time for me***

Such an amazing cake! If I didn't bake it myself I would of thought it was professionally made in a bakery somewhere. I had to make a little alteration to the recipe stated above. My "batter" was just all powder after I finished mixing it. I added 3/4 - 1 Cup of applesauce and about 1/4 cup of milk to make my batter a cake batter. The moisture and sweetness was just perfect!

This cake was MUCH better after freezing. When I first took it out of the oven and let it cool and cut myself a piece, it was very dry, so maybe an ingredient was left out.

I made this because I wanted to make a dessert with apples that was not my signature apple pie. I was not disappointed. I made the cake exactly as written (except I added a 1/2 cup of milk because the batter was so dry it was crumbly) and topped it with a cream cheese icing consisting of 8 oz cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a splash of milk. Next time I'll add a couple tablespoons of butter to the icing, but not change a thing about the cake. My son declared he wants this cake for his 18th birthday cake. I will definitely make this again and again and again.

I can't give this a 5 star because I needed to make a few things different but it was still a great recipe that I would make again. First, I used half the sugar and added apple sauce instead of oil, giving the cake a heather and more apple-ie taste. I only used two apples, one red and one green. This could be because my apples were bigger, there was no size. Last, I had to put it in the oven longer then the recipe said, perhaps because I used apple sauce instead of oil. Anyways, thanks for sharing the recipe :D

Adam, Your video and recipe were great. My Grandmother had a version of this too.  She used homemade apple sauce for part of the liquid, a dash of nutmeg plus a little instant coffee.  It was a hit too. Thanks for sharing  leiaj

I would say it's really 4.5 stars. I used half brown sugar and butter rather than oil. No electric mixer is necessary. I melted the butter, stirred in sugar, let it cool a minute then stirred in eggs and dry ingredients, followed by apples. It's a breeze to make with the pre-sliced apples from the produce section. An hour was way too long for mine to bake. Probably 40 min. at the max. Might benefit from a glaze or streusel.

I just made this apple cake yesterday, but it turned out very dry and not as fluffy as I expected. The batter was also dry when I mixed all the ingredients, therefore I added a cup of apple sauce. I did not used the white sugar, replaced with brown sugar. It only took about 45 minutes to bake the cake since that is the time when I checked the cake. So, I am assuming that the heat in my oven is much higher even though I set at 350F. Can anyone else give me some tips on this ? thank you, I may have to try another time.

Okay... in short this turned out delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I used butter instead of oil and consequently had to add about 1/2 a cup of milk - and nutmeg. I loooove nutmeg. My batter looked NOTHING like Adam's in the video. It was incredibly sticky and after cutting up only 3 avg sized apples, the bowl was more apple than batter... uh oh. Then I realize there is no 9X13 pan where I'm staying. 9X7?? Yikes. It's all I have; let's try it! 
After a good 70 minutes it was cooked through, 3 inches high, beautifully browned, and dense (more a bread than a cake, which I liked). I will make this again and again, and I truly don't think I'd make it any differently! I loved it! My husband loved it! (That said, I'm sitting here thinking I'd add some cranberries or raspberries for some 'bite'. Yum!) 

* At about the half hour mark I added a brown sugar and cinnamon topping and did cover the cake with foil for the last 20+ minutes of cooking.

I absolutely recommend this cake! Don't compare yours to the video! (Was it the oil substitution that did it? Not sure...).

Note: I am irked by ppl who rate things 5 stars yet have made several alterations to a recipe. I'm giving 5 because I "loved it", it's true, and I feel my modifications were because I had to work with what I had - a 9X7 pan - and I try never to use vegetable oil in anything.

my husband and son went crazy over this cake--they couldn't eat it fast enough. I did add an extra apple as mine were small. the batter is VERY think but I dotted a few skimpy pieces of butter over the top before I put in the oven. this is scrumptious and worth ten stars. after prep of the apples, it was simple. also I have a convection oven and it was done in about 50 minutes. allrecipes never fails me when I use any of their recipes and this definitely din not disaappoint. this will be made again I am sure

Delicious. Batter was super thick and didn't come out at all like the video, lol. I would not add as much sugar next time, a little on the sweet side, especially is you want to eat it a la mode.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was dry and hard but I will say it had good flavor. As for the batter it came out as a crumble crust texture.I have to wonder if there is a missing ingredient.

OMG, one of the best apple cakes ever.  Nice and crunchy on top and then super moist inside.  As some of the other reviewers noted, the batter was very thick, but after I added in the chopped apples it got more moist.  The apples add some extra sweet flavoring, so keep that in mind when measuring out the sugar. I used less sugar than what the recipe called for.  Also, I think the apples add extra moistness to the cake.  I had chopped mine up to small pieces.  I will definitely be making this again.  Totally yummy.

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups sugar but it was still too sweet. Anyway, it was delicious! Next time I'll switch it to brown sugar and use a lot less. Thanks, Adam!

I baked this cake late yesterday.  This morning it went well with my morning coffee.  I did make some changes.  First I greased and floured my cake pan instead of using cooking spray. It called for 4 apples.  I pared and chopped 4 small apples but only used half of them.  I added some whole milk to make the batter more like a cake batter than cookie dough.  I also added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  Since the recipe did not say how long to bake it I went by what other cake recipes recommend and baked it 50 minutes.  I don't know if I will bake this recipe again or not but if I do I will probably add more oil to make it moister.  It does make a pretty good coffee cake.

The dough is way too sticky & doesn't mix well with the apple pieces & after baking it was very dry. The taste was alright.

Delicious!  Followed recipe except used half white sugar and half brown sugar (just because I love brown sugar).  I mixed all the ingredients together with a KitchenAid mixer. First I tossed the apples with the cinnamon.  My family loved it and it was simple to make.

This had a good flavor but it wasn't as moist as I was hoping it would be- though that may be due to the type of apples used. I have an apple tree in the backyard but the apples themselves are on the "dry" side - when making applesauce with them apple juice has to be added or it ends up as thick as glue. I will try this again maybe with different apples next time.

This was interesting. It's not a cake nor a cookie or coffee cake, it's in a class of its own. I liked it, my husband had his with vanilla ice cream & liked it. The batter is...well, more like an oily shortbread mix. I cut my apples into chunks, I think a dice would be better. I thought 2 cups of sugar was a lot, but it wasn't, it was perfect. I'll make this again.

Made this apple coffee cake this morning.  The basic recipe was very good.  I did change some ingredients to make the cake more diet friendly.  Instead of 3/4 cup of oil, I used 1/3 cup oil and 1/2 cup chunky applesauce to lessen the fat content. Also, I used 3/4 cup Egg Beaters instead of 3 eggs.  I substituted one of the cups of white sugar with Splenda.  The spice amounts were good.  I baked the cake for 48 minutes.  My husband ate 2 pieces of it before it barely cooled!

I have made this cake about 5 times and each time has been wonderful. I always add too many apples. Perfect.  Today I made it with pears.  I had some oranges that I needed to use to I soaked the cut up pears in orange juice and a bunch of zest.  I put some crumble on top. Super.

the cake is very good but i could not finish mixing the flour with the oil and eggs,  it was too thick should there not have been a little milk in the recipe?, so I added a little milk just enough to finish mixing and it turned out o.k.

Delicious and moist cake that is so easy to make!  I made it exactly to the written directions, using the 1 1/4 cup of oil as directed, not the 3/4 cup listed in the video.  Perhaps this difference is why some reviewers said their cake was dry.  The batter is going to be thick and crumbly before you add the apples.  The moisture in the apples will change the consistency of the batter as you mix them in.  I baked for 40-45 minutes until a toothpick came out clean.  You won't be disappointed if you make this cake!

This cake is delicious!! I have friends who have sensitive food allergies and I have made it with gluten free flour and/or white rice flower. I have also made it using apple sauce instead of the eggs. Making it gluten free, egg free and of course dairy free, for anyone who know someone with sensitive allergies or wants to try. If you do make it with the gluten free stuff after you are done mixing it all together spread it out in the baking dish and let it sit for about 5 minutes, the juices from the apples kind of help it settle.  I always get a request for more!!

Very good! Moist cake. I added 1/4 cup of milk in the batter because I was afraid it will turn out dry. It turned out really good.  I mixed everything using the electric mixer and then I added the apples. Very good to eat  still warm just few minutes out of the oven. Thanks .

I've made this recipe with young children every time, the recipe is simple, simple amount of ingredients. The end result has been very moist and a big hit of anyone we were cooking for, even ourselves. In fact every time we have made this we have had 2 different people asking where we got the recipe. The first cake actually "disappeared" one day it was so good, others were swiping it! Awesome recipe

Delicious cake but I'll do better next time after learning how to avoid pitfalls my first time.  Batter was impossible to mix apples without adding a few tbsp. of milk.  Some things I did different.  Used Gala apples with skin on.  Didn't use lemon or orange to keep them from browning. Used Splenda and brown sugar half and half in place of white.  Added chopped pecans and split recipe into two smaller loaf pans.

Tasty and easy.  I did add about 1/2c of applesauce prior to baking it.  Everyone loved it, even my picky 2 year old.  I think it will also work as a breakfast pastry.

Just finished making this cake. It is delicious. I read the problem other reviewers had with their mixers and this batter. I had no problem. I have a heavy duty kitchen aid, and it handled it with no problem. I watched the video and saw that the apples were added to the bowl and  stirred using the mixer. This gave more moisture to the batter, but the integrity of the apples remained in tact. It was a big hit with family and friends. I definitely will make this again.

A suggestion that I tried that really made this moist was to whip the oil and eggs together first until they combined, then add the other liquid ingredients to that mixture.  Mix all of the dry ingredients together before adding it to the wet. Add apples last and my family likes to add chopped walnuts. Great with coffee!

So the batter is extremely thick and it wasn't blending well, as per previous comments. So what I did was I added some milk... About 1 cup of milk while blending the mix.. you don't want it too liquidy. Also I added 2 table spoons of vanilla extract! And the apples I blended them in a blender for smaller pieces and easier to mix

A simple, fairly quick recipe.  Good flavors and there's so much sugar in this that the top kind of caramelizes into a thin, crispy layer.  I'll make this again.

I found it to be dry.  I will try it again, as my wife loves apple desserts, but I am going to add in1c of applesauce to try to increase the moisture of it.

This is a great apple cake and easy to make.  I've done with half brown sugar and half white, just because I like the flavor of brown sugar.  Doesn't matter because I'd make it either way.  :-) I've also cut the recipe in half and used in an 8x8 pan.  Any negative reviews are a mystery to me, but to each his own. I've already saved this as a favorite and will certainly make it again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I added some honey on the top of it before I put it in the oven so it had a nice crusty sweet surface when it came out. Otherwise it was such a good cake! Thanks to the recipe of course!

I wanted to use up some apples and came across this recipe.  After reading the suggestions I decided to go with the original recipe after watching the video.  The only thing I changed was to bake the cake in a 10" spring-form pan because I don't have a 9 x 13.  I dumped everything in my stand mixer, including the apples.  I left the peel on the apple because I see no reason to remove it for a cake.  I let the stand mixer do all the work and waited until the mix appeared moist/sticky.  I think allowing the stand mixer beat the apples releases moisture from the apples which prevents the dryness that some people experienced.  Baked exactly 1 hour on 350 as recommended and done.  This is a very good, not overly sweet, apple cake and I will make it again.

Made this recipe as written and found it too sweet. The batter was also greasy and the resulting baked cake was kind of oily, dense, and had a slightly crumbly texture although not dry. It did produce nice crunchy edge pieces and I found that the amount of apples to be sufficient. I'll make it again but use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce or buttermilk, and reduce the sugar a bit to see if that helps with the issues that I had. I don't normally make dessert recipes healthier but I feel that it would improve it in this case, for my preference anyway.

Super easy to make, super yummy to eat. (ended up with 2 round cakes)

We added a cinnamon glaze to one and a maple glaze to the other.  Both were delicious!

I make this cake every year for all of my friends during apple season and they absolutely love it (it never lasts more than 2 days)! Made exactly as directed with different apples and it turns out perfect every time! Have also made it in a regular sized cupcake and mini-sized cupcakes.  Would highly recommend!!

Recipe error. Should be 1 3/4 cup oil NOT 3/4 cup. I have another recipe, identical and it calls for 2 cups of oil and its moist and delicious. Correct this and people will see its a delicious cake. Even in the video, you can see that the batter is more liquid.

My apples were small, so I used six; this amounted to 3 cups, and seemed to be okay. I prepared the apples first, and squeezed lemon juice on them. This extra juice was enough to make the batter work, but I think next time, I may add another tablespoon of some liquid, or maybe just reduce the sugar by half a cup.  Even with just the small amount of extra liquid, the cake is moist and delicious. Yum!

Awesome taste and such a nice alternative to apple crisp!  
Followed the recipe to a "T".  Not enough wetness to batter so I have found adding 1 C of milk each time I made this so far (twice) made it perfect and smooth batter.  Did not take longer to bake.

My daughter asked if we could bake a cake and when we decided on apple cake this was the recipe I thought we should try. This cake was delicious! My batter was a little dry probably because I didn't sift the flour, so I added a splash of milk. It  turned out perfectly. Will definitely make this one again! I'm happy to see other reviewers say it freezes well, I could see having this in my freezer to pull out for company.

Edit: my youngest asked for apple cupcakes for his birthday so I used this recipe again. So good! I still added the splash of milk but it probably wasn't necessary.

Peeled and cored Apple's, used one granny Smith and the rest gala and let them sit in fresh lemon until added to batter. The lemon gave an added depth. To batter instead of 3 cups of regular flour I added 2 3/4cups regular flour and 1/4 cup self rising. Results were very good. I was surprised

I followed the recipe and reviews. Batter was very thick even after increasing oil to 1 cup, and adding 1/4 cup buttermilk. I used 5 small gala apples. I made 2 at exactly the same time, baked at the same time, and one was done in 45 minutes, while the other one took the full hour to pass the toothpick test. The difference is that a metal pan cooks faster than a glass one! :) I also added a streusal topping of  2/3 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I didn’t feel like icing it. LOL!  Smells amazing here

This is an excellent basic recipe but, as many others have mentioned, the batter is INCREDIBLY thick when made as instructed. So much so that I carefully went back through the recipe to see if I'd done something wrong. (How relieved was I when I read the comments and saw many others saying the same?!) The batter was SO thick that I couldn't manage to mix in the apples. To rectify this I added 3-4 tbs (I just scooped it out of the tub) of sour cream...adding enough to make the batter back into batter rather than the dough it had become. Followed the rest of the recipe and instuctions . Absolutely delicious. I think this a great base that could be added to in many ways to make all sorts of things. Will be making again for sure.

I love this cake!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  The only thing I did differently was add a bit of applesauce to make the batter a little less thick.  I covered the cake with confectioner's sugar.  This is one of my favorite desserts now!

Great use of minimal ingredients and little work. Batter is quite thick before the apples are added but works out in the end. I will make again but might sprinkle a cinnamon sugar mix on top prior to baking.

I made this for the first time and took over my sisters for a function she was having. It was wonderful...reminds  me a merryfield applecake same consistency and same ingredients except for in the merryfield applecake you add walnuts or pecans.

Really a great recepie! I was looking for something easy and fast to bake and came to this recepie. Love that he is using oil instead of butter. I added some soy milk, raisins, walnuts, and half a lemon. It smells fantastic! Thank you Adam! keep on posting more recepies!

Good recipe but next time I would reduce the sugar as it's rather sweet... will definitely make again as it's quite easy.

I did add 1/2 cup of applesauce after reading the other reviews, but left everything else the same. Brought it to work and got rave reviews.

I was worried when I saw the batter (which didn't really look like batter until the apples get added). This was absolutely fabulous. It is moist and very tasty and so easy to make. Definitely will become a family favourite.

It was good, but it wasn't great. I added 1/2 C milk to the batter to loosen it up a bit.

This was awesome. I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and only baked it for 40 min and it turned out awesome. I also had some left over cream cheese icing witch I drizzled over the top. This is now my go to cake.

Wow was this good! I followed the tip from others and added some applesauce to the batter (one cup) and it was perfect! Incredibly easy to make and loved by all!

Made a few small changes because of my oven/wanted more cinnamon/wanted to use some applesauce my mother in law gave us, but it was and is amazingly delicious. this makes a LOT of cake, though. Next time I'm going to split it between 2 pans and layer them with some caramel sauce in the middle. Will make again!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter, it was good but a little dry.  I think with all the dry ingredients it needed a little more liquid.  The second time I made it I added 1/3 cup of vanilla soy milk and sprinkled the top with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking.  It came out moist airy, and really tasty.  Great job Adam!

I tried it the mix was very thick and did not look like the batter on the video. The one on the video appears nice and creamy, I followed the recipe exactly and it looked like apple crisp as it baked. I will try it again but right now I think my Kitchen Aid with the thick dough.

This cake was very good but a little on the sweet side. Took it to work and they really enjoyed it. It is moist but a very dense cake.

I made this cake over the weekend and it was a great hit with my family.  I did add 1/2 c. milk to the extremely thick batter but changed nothing else.  It was wonderful.

So simple and delicious. I use coconut oil and 5 small apples and sometimes a 1/4 ts of nutmeg. It freezes beautifully. Going to bake up a few and save in the freezer for company. I also added nuts a couple times. It always comes out great and is excellent just the way Adam makes it!

My family loved this, along with everyone else I made try it =). I did do half brown sugar, and only 2 1/2 apples. Baked 45 minutes and melted cinnamon butter on top when I removed it from the oven and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Tasted great!

Very easy to make. Only used 3 apples and it was plenty!! Four would have been too much. Very heavy dense cake, but tasted ok. Hubby not happy with such a heavy cake. Won't make again.
