Believe the hype-- these were fantastic! I don't have a grill so for the grill part, I just put them in the oven at 350 degrees, basting frequently. As recommended, I made double the sauce and didn't leave it over for dipping--- I just slathered the whole amount on there throughout basting! The first time, I didn't listen to others advice and only made the standard amount of sauce. Big mistake! Make double!The sauce was finger-licking good (I mean literally) and I was so pleased that I made my own sauce. No more store-bought-- this one's a keeper! As other people mentioned, I also added a bit of chili pepper flakes for some heat, and it was the perfect balance. Thanks for the recipe for these tender, delicious ribs!

Wow, these ribs are definitely 5 star.  Changed a couple of things on the 2nd round of making these to fit the family's preference.  Instead of 1 tbsp of white sugar in the rub, I subbed 3/4 tbsp of white sugar and 3/4 tbsp of brown sugar.  Added 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the sauce, used dried minced onions vs fresh diced onion and added 1/4 tsp of dried red pepper flakes to balance the sweet sauce.  Perfect mixture of sweet and spicy.  Took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and am so very glad I did!  Thanks Gail for a GREAT recipe!

These ribs were excellent; quite tender and full of flavor. Although they require some pre-planning, they are extremely easy and so delicious. 
A tip: After roasting the ribs for 2-2 1/2 hours, the garlic slices will be soft; smash them and rub them on the ribs before sprinkling with the rub spices.

Ribs as good or better than most restaurants! I added 1/4 cup molasses, 1/2 t liquid smoke, and cut vinegar to 1/4c for a more full bodied, smokey taste to our ribs.I do all my ribs under the broiler. Brush slabs on top with sauce and turn and brush bottoms. I do this three times on each side for 5 mins. The sauce reduces down and seems to be soaked up by the ribs. Yummy! Thanks Gail!

This is the ULTIMATE rib recipe. WE make it for all BBQ's and friends and family often comment on how these are the best ribs they have ever had. They rave on how tender they are too. Its a good fake out recipe for beginner grillers. I do have a few suggestions though.  First, Beware the spice rub. I slathered it on the first time and it was WAY too much.  I'm a little more careful with it now and i put some on the meaty side, and very little on the bone side.  Second, Double the sauce recipe and put extra on the ribs and completely forgo the dipping sauce.  These are tender enough you can eat them right off the bone without a hassle.  The sauce isn't that yummy by itself, but the spice rub totally brings the flavor out.

This is the best rib recipe EVER!!!!  My family and friends will no longer order ribs when we go out to eat now!!  They will only eat these!!  I'm having a huge Mother's Day party and guess what was requested?? hmmmm RIBS!!  I do not change one item on the recipe, it's perfect the way it is.  My 13 year old niece (who weighs 70 pds) has been known to eat a whole rack of these ribs.  THANK YOU GAIL for such a great recipe!

These ribs are awesome.  I used boneless pork ribs.  I didn't have the exact ingredients, so I substituted minced garlic, light brown sugar and white distilled vinegar.  I think next time I might cut down on the chili powder and the cumin in the rub, but that's just a personal preference.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  These ribs are the best!

Not worth the effort.  I wasn't a huge fan of the combo of spices in the rub.  Also, I might have used the wrong type of chili sauce, but the original result was so spicy that it overpowered everything.  I spent an hour trying anything I could to reduce the spice, using any technique google could teach me.  It still ended up too spicy...and my husband and I both like spicy food.  He could barely eat it, and he eats everything.  I will not make this recipe as is again.  It needs a lot of tweaking

Made just as the recipe called for.  My husband doesnt like ribs much . He loved this recipe as did I. Made in the winter and in the midwest I am not going out to BBQ on the grill.   So I broiled them On my top rack.  Brushed them with the sauce 3 times both sides.  About every 3 minutes.  They were fantastic.  This is something I will make for many years to come.  Thank you for posting it.

I served these ribs to some friends who LOVE ribs & they raved about them ... even requested the recipe!  The only changes I would recommend are: cut black pepper in rub to 1 teaspoon, cut brown sugar in sauce to 1/4 cup.  I always add extra garlic (in baking & sauce).  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I also feel like I'm just repeating what everyone else has said. I've been searching for a great rib recipe for a while now and I think the search is over. Made it exactly as the recipe said and had nothing but raves! Tender, moist, and wonderful flavors in the BBQ sauce.

Made these for Labor Day weekend.  These were absolutley the best BBQ ribs EVER!!!  The ribs were so tender and the sauce was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!  What I liked most about these ribs is, the sauce isn't your typical BBQ sauce, not sticky and messy.  These literally can be eaten with your fingers and you don't need wipes!!  Kudos to the chef  ;)

This is the best rib recipe I have tried and I used venison instead.  My parent-in-laws were frustrated by their limited options with a fat free diet.  I made this for them and they asked me to do it again and again.   Thank you!

I am accustomed to ribs slow cooked on a smoker but this recipe has made me a convert!  My husband does not like ribs and has asked me to make them 3 weeks in a row.  Followed the recipe exactly (well, I did cheat abd used dried onion flakes instead of chopping an onion).  We served these on our camping trip last weekend - so easy as they were already cooked and we just had to heat them with the sauce on the grill.  Thanks from a BBQ lover for such a great recipe!

I've foil wrapped ribs in the past that were good, but never put them on a rack in a pan and then wrapped them-makes all the difference.  I'm VERY picky when it comes to food, but this works!  I applied my own rub for the initial cooking and let them cool but not overnight.  Applied my own sauce although this one looks excellent then bbq'd as indicated.  The strength of this recipe is execution from the start.  Perfect heat vs steam yet not braising in juice.  Sacrifices a little flavor from smoking in a pit but just as juicy if not more so than smoking.  WOW!

Made these tonight and they were great.  I did one thing a little differently.. put the rub on the ribs before baking.. wrapped in foil and baked at 300 for 2 hours.. then opened the foil and after straining off some of the fat, basted with sauce, turned up the heat to 350 for about 12-15 minutes.  I was a bit rushed for time or I would have grilled them..  They came out moist, fall off the bone,  cut with a fork tender.  The flavor was to die for.. Got home at 3:30pm.. Had an amazing meal on the table before 6:00pm... Didn't know a man and a teenager could eat a whole rack that large, along with salad, beans and rolls...  Where do they put it???

As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." My wife and I, through a joint effort, have perfected a tried and true method for preparing ribs, but it's still fun to occasionally try something different.  The sauce and rub were okay, but our main complaint was that they were neither as juicy nor as tender as they should be.  Disappointing.

These were so good!!  I did use boneless country pork ribs, and followed the recipe exactly as written, with only a couple minor changes.  I used dehydrated onions in the sauce, and garlic powder, instead of the fresh garlic, I also added a splash of liquid smoke.  I did the last step in the oven, instead of the grill.  Will definitely be using this recipe over and over again!!  Thanks Gail!!

I made this with chicken thighs rather than ribs, as we are not huge fans of ribs, and it was delicious.  The dipping sauce/ marinade is great: spicy, sweet and sour all at the same time.

AWESOME!!! I did what another person suggested and schmeared the roasted garlic all over the ribs and then did the dry rub...the BBQ sauce is NOT so important here, if you have a favorite, use it...the method of covered, slow roasting and the rub is the MOST important step....PLEASE DO NOT BOIL THE FLAVOR FROM YOUR RIBS

My husband said these may be the best ribs he's ever had. We're making them again and he's willing to brave the cold to finish them on the grill, so he must mean it!

These are great.  I love the oven slow cooked method, but I rub the meat before, not after.  Then I let them cool a bit and slather on the barbecue sauce before grilling.  I've also done baked and basted in a 500 degree oven for 15 -20 minutes instead of grilling.  Either way... yum.

These ribs are to die for. I brought these to a party where 4 people made ribs and these were by FAR the best. I did make a few alterations. Instead of the chili sauce I added an extra 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 tsp allspice and an extra 1/4 c ketchup. I also added 2 tbsp WHISKEY and reduced down (next time I will use 3 tbsp whiskey). After baking in oven and then rubbing the spices over (I thought this odd to do it after they were cooked but it worked). I let them sit overnight in the fridge. We then lit the charcoal grill and basted them with this yummy sauce. Out of this world!

Next time I omit the cumin - then it will be perfect for a small slab of baby backs. I don't care for taco-tasting ribs.

I've been making this recipe for 3 years and it's always a hit!  I double the recipe using 3 full meaty racks (8-9 lbs) and my large roasting pan.  The only tweak I make to the sauce is halving the regular chili sauce and adding a couple tablespoons of hot thai chili sauce (srirachi)   The sauce becomes the perfect blend of spicy sweet. Tip:  Cook the sauce earlier in the day before guests arrive.  It's REALLY strong smelling while it's cooking.

This recipe is worth every star. I am not a sauce person, and I almost left it off. It would've been a huge mistake. I had people at the party ask for the sauce recipe. It's amazing. I cut the cayenne in half, because of spice-sensitive people I knew would be there.

This is an excellent recipe. I read the previous ratings/comments on the ribs and took the advice of doubling the sauce. I also used chinese chili sauce and stayed with the initial 1/4 cup of the recipe.  I was hoping to have some leftovers for the next day to take to lunch however there were none. Highly recommend the recipe.

Excellent.  Used ingredients exactly as writted.  First time I have ever made barbequed ribs and they were fall of the bone, PERFECT.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested but was a little too much sauce. That's OK, though, will be good on my chicken tomorrow.  Will def make again and again.

The ribs are awesome!!!!!  It sound like a lot of work but you just need to plan ahead.  Doing the cooking the night before you can enjoy your guests instead of standing in the kitchen all day.

In one word......AWESOME!!!  Made this for Memorial Day weekend.  Absolutely will be making this again.  Although I did make some changes to the sauce recipe....too much vinegar for our tastes.  Ribs, however, were falling from the bone and TASTY.  This is a keeper.  Thanks Gail!!!

excepional! i almost followed the directions, but i hate ketchup, so i swicthed the amounts of ketchup and chili sauce. i also used elephant garlic instead of regular garlic. i did not cook sauce prior to making, i marinaded the baby backs all night in the sauce and then basted the ribs about every 5 minutes after baking covered at 325 degrees. raining here, so grill was out. a lot of trouble to make the sauce but i made it the day before and will save for next time. nothing on the market compares to the sauce. i bet it would be terrific on chicken! a great recipe. oops i baked @ 30 minutes covered and then started basting @ every 5 minutes

This recipe was perfect. The ribs were so tender after roasting. The only thing we did differently was eat them the same day. Instead of leaving the dry rub on overnight, I let the ribs cool a bit on the counter with the dry rub on them (maybe an hour). Then I grilled them while basting with the sauce.  Ribs can be so hard to cook. I don't have the option of a smoker since I live in a condo, so I have tried every other method (crock pot, boiled in beer, slow cooked on the grill) and this method is by far the best. My boyfriend gets ribs at most restaurants if they are on the menu, and he decided these were better! Try this recipe and impress your friends and family!!

Delicious!  Made this for Father's Day and it was a hit, especially with the men.  It was a rainy day so I baked the ribs (instead of grilling) for approximately 45 minuntes at 300 degrees.

This is a really great tasting sauce. I didn't follow the directions completely, I mixed all ingredients together and simmered over low heat for about 2 hours and I added a little bit more garlic and chili. On the ribs I cut up thin slices of garlic and spread all over the ribs sprinkled with black pepper. Then I saran wrapped the ribs tightly and foil wrapped them and cooked in the oven for 325 for 2 1/2 hours. Very moist, fall of the bone ribs and tasty too!

These ribs are suburb.  At first I was concerned about the amount of pepper.  Tasted the rub and I went ahead anyway with the rest of the recipe and they were outstanding.  The only changes I made was to double the sauce & used 1/4 cup of vinegar.  Very, very good, thanks to you.

By far, the best ribs I have tasted. I read the reviews about adding molasses and reducing the vinegar but I decided to try the recipe as is first. I'm glad that I did. These ribs were perfect, juicy, falling off the bone and the sauce and rub are amazing...I could go on and on. I can't wait to make them again! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever had. Did these up for a b-day party, they were a big hit. I made a couple of little changes, I cooked the sauce for almost 2 hours until it was nice and thick. Also I used a lot more garlic and I didn't have any cumin.

An absolute hit with everyone.  I prepared 2 large racks of ribs for a party and they were gone within 20 minutes!  I have made them several times and have passed around this recipe.  Definitely worth the effort.

Excellent!! My Husband raved for days. These are just spicy enough without being so hot you can't taste the ribs. I used pork and beef ribs, It was equally good on both. The ribs were tender and moist. I have tried a lot of rib recipes over the years and this is one of the best.

Love this recipe! I couldn't find chili sauce in the store so I subbed ketchup w/ tabasco, didn't have dark brown sugar, subbed light brown sugar w/a Tbsp. of molasses.  They were wonderful, tender an flavorful!  A keeper for sure!

Hey!  When I like my own cooking, you know it is an excellent recipe.  This makes an excellent choice for dinner after a long day of skiing.  Served with salad. I cooked under the broiler for the 2nd stage of cooking (don't have a grill).  They still tasted excellent and will be making them again this weekend.  We are always tired after a day on the slopes.  Dinner was a snap with a minimal amount of fuss because all the prep was done the day before.

We actually had friends comment that these were the best ribs they'd ever had!  A little too much vinegar for my taste, so I added a little molasses to cut the tartness.  They were great and just fell off the bone!  Defintely worth the 2 day effort.

Note: I modified the recipe to semi-homemade.
Followed the rub and use a bottle of BBQ for browned and glazed.

I used boneless pork ribs. I followed the dry rub (directions #2). I let it marinated overnight.

I took the meat out from the refrigerator prior to baking 2 hours so it can be at room temperature. I added 1 cup of water on the bottom rack (it brings moisture to the meat so it does not dry out while baking) and 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic in the water.

Place the pork on the rack, cover it with foil and bake it at 325 'F for 1.5 hours.

Once done, I took it out so I coated the ribs completely with BBQ sauce.  Do not cover the ribs, let it broil in the oven low for 10 mins so it can be browned and glazed.

Then coat the ribs with BBQ sauce and serve.

Pork meat should be tender and juicy! Delicious!

These came out AMAZING... Followed the recipe to a T, and it was so delicious.. The first time I ever tried to make BBQ ribs, they came out really dry.... These were tender and the sauce was awesome! Will make over & over again.

These were by far the best ribs I have ever had.  The rest of the family felt the same way.

This recipes deserves a 10!!!!!  Made it last night for company and EVERYONE thought they were the best.  Followed it to a "T" - no deletions or additions.  By far the best.  Will print out extra copies so I don't lose it and will pass it along to others.  I used country style ribs and baked them the same amount and grilled them the same time.  OOOOOOOHHHHHH  SOOOOO DELISH!!!!

I made no changes to the recipe and these were the best ribs I have ever had.  The rub, the sauce etc was absolutely delicious.  Prepare the day before and then just grill with the work behind you.  Thanks for a definite keeper.

These ribs were great. I left the slab wrapped in foil and put it in the top basket of the grill. It warmed through without drying out while the rest of the meal was cooking. I brought it down over direct heat to baste and finish.

I made these ribs for Father's Day.  Even though the recipe had several steps it was still pretty easy.  The ribs came out tender and juicy.  The sauce was a bit tangy so I did half the ribs with sauce and half with just the rub.  My dad preferred the ribs with the rub alone.  He also suggested wrapping the ribs completely in foil to grill.  I will definitely try this one again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Unbelievable.  Double the sauce.  They will fall off the bone and your guests will ne wowed.  Sounds complicated but is really simple.  Added pinch of cayenne to dry rub.  Added 1/2 tsp. molasses to sauce b/c I used light brown sugar.  EDIT: Made several times.  These are foolproof, but FOLLOW recipe.  Husband, family says best ribs ever.

I wish that I could give these ribs more stars.  We have made these ribs many times and passed the recipe on to many people.  These ribs are even great without barbecue sauce.

I used this recipe for a party this weekend and it was a big hit! As other reviewers commented, I was worried about using so much vinegar in the sauce. I made the sauce according to the recipe, and as it cooked, the strong smell of vinegar only became stronger! I had a bottle of bbq sauce from the store on stand-by and decided to test the homemade sauce on the first rack of ribs. It was delicious! I guess the spices in the dry rub enhance the flavor of the sauce as the meat cooks on the grill. Needless to say, I didn't need the bottled sauce after all! I used the homemade sauce on all of the ribs and everyone raved about how great they were! I'll definitely use this flavorful recipe again!

Made these ribs for our annual Holiday dinner - as last year, made standing rib roast and was consumed in the kitchen, unable to enjoy the party.  Started Thursday with the baking and the rub - and meant to BBQ Sat. afternoon.  It rained all day and so went to plan B, to broil/baste to get the ribs heated through.  Halfway through broiling, the power went out - but we continued until all 6 racks were completed.  10 of us ate ribs & a bunch of BBQ sides ("Mom's Coleslaw" from this site) and the reactions were "Amazing", "Best I've ever had", "Slammin' Ribs!" and requests for the recipe.  This is perfect for a crowd in summer & winter, daylight or candlelight!  Will most definitely make again.

The ribs turned out great.  They were tender and pretty juicy.
However, the rub powder for the ribs is pretty hot if you put too much on.  
But if you enjoy spicy ribs then this is a great recipe.  I made them for a Super Bowl 
Sunday party and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  The majority of my family
enjoys spicy foods so this was great.  I will definitely try this recipe again, but
I will ease up on the rub powder.

One of the meats made for X-Mas dinner and the whole family (15 people) loved this and went back for more. Personally, I prefer good old BBQ sauce so I wasn't "in love" with them but the masses were so that's good enough for me! The slow cooking in the oven and the rub were really good & I would have enjoyed this without the sauce even more. They did come out overtly tender so they must rest or they will break apart.

Amazing!  A little too spicy so I went easy on the rub and cut the chili sauce by 25%; plus, I added 1/4 cup dark beer and cut the cider vinegar to 1/4 cup.  The result was the PERFECT blend of sweet and spicy with an added complexity from the beer.  It was so good, I doubled the sauce recipe the 3rd time.

Cooking the ribs the day before with just a brief stint on the grill before serving makes these ribs the perfect recipe for summertime entertaining!  I made the rub as directed with the exception of using half smoked and half sweet paprika.  The cumin flavor was a little too prevalent for my taste, and next time I will cut back a bit.  Even the person at our barbeque who proclaimed himself “not a lover of ribs” went back for seconds.  5 star plus recipe for flavor and convenience!

Ok... definitely not in love.  Texture -- needs a bit more moisture and time... flavor --- a bit too sweet.  Overall...can't think I'd make them again...  Again... not bad, but somewhat under the radar.

My first time making baby backs and I have to say this was just SUPERB!  I measure by eyeball and I think I overdid the cumin...next time I'll be careful.
The sauce..KICKED BUTT!  The meat just fell off the bone and was still very very moist!
If I had another hand I'd give you THREE THUMBS UP!

I feel like I'm just repeating what everyone else has said, but just had to add my own praise for this one.  We've been hunting for a great rib recipe for a while now - trying many on this site as well as others - and I think the search is over.  Made it exactly as the recipe said and had nothing but raves! Tender, moist, and wonderful flavors in the BBQ sauce.

The rub for this recipe is the best I've tried, and I've tried a lot! The sauce is very good as well, but a few changes as others have stated. Less vinegar, add molasses & liquid smoke. I triple the rub for 3 slabs and feed 5 people with no leftovers. I do all the cooking on the grill. I put the rub on, then wrap in heavy foil and refrigerate overnight. Low heat 250-275 on the grill for 2-2 1/2 hours in foil. Remove from foil and cook for another 30 minutes, basting with sauce every 5-10 minutes. Everyone that has tried them, says they're the best they've ever had!

These are OUTSTANDING!!! I have been searching for years for a GREAT rib recipe! I made these several times over the summer with outsanding results! Have a Convection Oven so I roasted on 275 for the 2.5 hours and it was perfect; so tender but not falling apart. The rub is just wonderful! Thank you, thank you!

Wow...I wasn't so sure about this...but the bbq sauce is wonderful (with the seasonings on the meat)! I misread the recipe and didn't cover the pork. I used boneless ribs. To rehydrate them, when I reheated them in the microwave the next day, I put a tiny bit of water on the plate, but the dry side of the meat on the bottom, and covered them with a domed plate. SO TASTY! I'm going to make bbq turkey now...:)

We really enjoyed these ribs.  The cooking method takes awhile, but it creates a very moist and tender rib.  I would reduce the amount of chile powder next time as the flavor was a little strong.  The sauce was delicious.  I added 2 T. molasses to give it a little more sweetness.

I made these ribs exactly as directed for Father's Day.  I was very disappointed that they were not at all tender and, in fact, were difficult to eat.  I will not use this recipe again.

Love this dish.  My very picky son loved it also only suggestion was to trim more of the fat before cooking.  I did add 1 TBS of Jack Daniels whiskey to the sauce.  I will be making this time and time again.  The neighbors loved it also.

These were better than any you could get in a restaurant! Definitely double the sauce recipe. I didn't have chili sauce and I did add 2 Tbsp more of the brown sugar, and 2 Tbsp molasses because we like a sweeter sauce. The rub alone made the ribs taste fantastic, but the sauce is what makes them perfect. They're worth the extra prep time it takes before grilling. My family is still talking about them 3 days later, and we're planning on making them again this weekend.

I was worried the ribs would dry out while I baked them initially, so I put about half a cup of cider vineager and 1.5 cups of water in the bottom of the baking dish to keep them moist.  I only let them marinate for 6 hours in the rub, but they were yummy!

I have to admit I cheated a bit on this recipe.  I am rating this based on the initial cook and the rub overnight marinade.  I used bottled bbq sauce for the grilling.  Even though there was quite a bit of chili pepper in these, my six year old (who's insanely picky) gobbled his up.  My husband, who notoriously HATES anything with bbq sauce on it, said it was wonderful, and I should definitely make them again.  I think the hardest part was sitting in the house all morning, smelling the garlic roasting on the ribs in the oven and knowing I couldn't eat them until the next day!  Great recipe if you plan in advance.  Thanks!

All I can say is wow! I had no idea what to expect as I have never cooked ribs before. I followed the recipe nearly exactly and they turned out as good as any ribs I have ever had..period. I must admit the ribs did not look appetizing after they were baked, nor did the sauce smell or look particularly good. But when they are basted and grilled, somehow they magically transform into melt in your mouth, delectable, professional quality ribs! I cannot recommend this recipe enough.

Wow!  These are by far the best ribs I've ever made or anyone else for that matter!  Thanks for this great recipe!  It does require some dedication as you are doing stuff for a day or two, but well worth it!  I followed the recipe exactly -- you should double the sauce (ran a bit short).  Everything else was perfect!

Strange, I followed the directions pretty throughly, but just wasn't that impressed.  The taste and tenderness were alright, but I've had and made better (in my opinion).

I made slight changes but only for time and meat preference.  I used spare ribs, put the rub on the raw meat, refrigerated overnight, threw them in a covered Pyrex at 300 degrees as I ran out the door.  Came home 3 hours later and lifted them out of the grease into the crockpot.  Made the sauce, poured it over them, and left them 5 hours on low, and they were delicious.  My husband said maybe less vinegar next time, but otherwise GREAT!!  My picky eater son kept dipping French fries in the sauce it was so good!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I will continue to cook my ribs using this method because it really produced tender ribs.  My only complaint is that the rub I made was very spicy.  I love spicy foods but this was too spicy.  It really depends on what type of chili powder you use.  I will cut back on it next time.

I like spicy foods but these ribs were too spicy and not as tender as I would like.  I would try again with less worcestershire sauce.

Wow, this recipe made my wife who can't really handle meat off the bone turn into a carnivore.  Her plate looked like a T-Rex den after dinner.  Delicious sauce, next time I'll make about 1.5 times the amount, and I only used about 1/3 of the dry rub to keep it from being too spicy.  You must try this recipe if you're into BBQs.

These ribs are phenomenal! My boyfriend has made them on three separate occasions now, they just keep getting better. The recipe is easily versatile, we've made ribs for the two of us and for larger groups... Equally delicious. We added a little extra garlic and cayenne to the sauce (we're from the South). AMAZING!!

The best ribs ever!  I had to reprint this recipe because I could barely read my original copy from 2007!   I make them exactly as the recipe states. My family refuses to order ribs out any longer because none compare to these.  The key is to start with quality baby back rib meat. They will fall off of the bone!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was absolutely fabulous!!!  Everyone loved it, even my 5 year old who is the world's pickiest eater when it comes to meat and my husband who hates trying new foods.  It was better then anything I have ever had eating out.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!  I followed everything to a T, except, I did substitute the chili sauce for Frank's hot sauce.  That was just a personal choice though :D

My initial response after taking the first bite of theese ribs was that you could just use a jug of Cattlemans brand BBQ sauce and get similar results without all the time, effort & ingreedients, Wrong! By the time I finished my first rib I had realized that the flavor combination of the spice rub and the sauce together was unique and awsome! Not the same as BBQ sauce. I did not double the sauce (as others recomended) and wished that I had, my 12 year old son thought they were perfect just the way they were and said they were the best ribs he ever had, Neither of us could stop eating them till' we were miserably stuffed! Don't worry about left-overs.....if there are any, they are most excellent the next day.

These are fantastic! If you are going to make them - make extra of the rub to save yourself some time on round 2. Because there will be a round 2 :)

Best ribs I've ever had, hands down!  My brother-in-law said this may have been one of the best dinners he's ever eaten.  I served with pasta salad and corn on the cob.  The recipe for the barbeque sauce I incredible.  I think it may replace any other barbeque I ever use.

Excellent ribs! I don't like them quite so spicy, so I half the rub. Sauce is excellent as is, but it is very tangy. Cut the vinegar and add liquid smoke for a mellower flavor, and be sure to double it.

Wow!  I made this with baby backs on my Traeger.  I smoked for 2 1/2 hours at 300 and then after the dry rub wait time, I smoked them with the sauce on for 45 min.  This is a keeper!

The sauce wasn't spectacular and I think the slow roasting should have crated a more tender rib.

I just made this and it was very nice, i used pork shoulder instead of ribs and found that the sauce was nice but a bit too spicy so i added a few tsp of honey.

My family loved these ribs. These were requested by my husband for his birthday dinner and he thought they were great. Although they take some time to make, they are by no means difficult, and most of the time is unsupervised. Thanks so much!

UPDATE!!  September 5, 2010 - I made these again this weekend.  I usually don't make the same food so close together. But this was a special request from my husband who usually just eats what is put before him and I didn't think even knew what he was eating!  Again, thanks for this one.
July 27, 2010  WOW!!  These were the best ribs I ever ever made.  Thank you for making me look so good to my family and guests.  I "owe" you one.

WOW! WOW! WOW! We made these ribs for our Fourth of July celebration and my husband and I were just amazed how good these were!  Falling off the bone tender, and the sauce is just to die for! I'm not kidding you when I tell you they are better than any resteraunt ribs we've ever had! Just AMAZING!!! As a matter of fact I have my husband making more of  the dipping sauce right now so we can marinate some pork chops! Bravo to who ever created this most delicious recipe!!!

I used about half the rub and half the sauce on 3.75 lbs of ribs.  Taste was incredible.  Meat was moist and came right off the bone.  Will be making these plenty over this summer for sure.

This is the best recipe for ribs I've ever had!  I'm not a big rib fan, but I love this recipe!  It is not at all difficult, but does take some planning to allow enough time for the different steps.  Wonderful recipe--tender, tasy ribs the whole family loves.  Thank you!

I agree-I tried refrigerating for only a few hours and did not have the same success as the first time in which I followed the recipe to the T-I have bottled the rub and use it on everything from chicken to popcorn-such a versatile sauce too, I add a splash or 3 of Frank's Red Hot to kick it up a bit now.

This recipe rocks.  Everyone loves the ribs - and using this recipe was the first time I had ever made ribs.  I have made them several times without disappointment!  I bake them at a lower temp for less time - that's the only change I've made.  Highly recommended!

I have a phobia of eating meat "on the bone" but I don't have a problem cooking with it.  I made these for my husband.  He finally got me to have a taste and the flavor was fantastic!  He said they were the best ribs he has ever had.  When making the sauce part of the recipe, at first all I could smell when it started cooking was worcestershire sauce and though it was going to be too prominent.  As the cooking time went on that smell decreased but the vinegar smell was almost overwhelming.  I decided to leave it alone and finish cooking the full hour.  I'm so glad I did!  The flavors melded perfectly into a wonderful sauce!  We thank you for a great recipe!

Tried this yesterday and they were delicious - my son couldn't get enough.  I didn't have time to let them refrigerate after rubbing overnight - but even with only 6 hours, the flavour was lovely.  (Next time, I'll know to start these a day ahead).  Also, we made them with 'normal' back ribs (not baby back).

One thing to note:  to remove the membrane from the back of the ribs before you start

The best part about this recipe is the preparation (baking). That is a great tip. The rub and bbq sauce are killer too! (didn't use all the rub, more than enough plus some)

This recipe is now my go-to for ribs! I just put the rub on the raw meat and refrigerate it overnight. The following day I bake them per the recipe (but wrapped in a foil packet) and may or may not actually grill them. When I'm not going to grill them, I just put the ribs in a foil packet with the unsimmered sauce and bake as usual. They come out amazingly tender, and the sugar in the sauce actually chars a little to make it almost taste like it was on the BBQ!

The rub is what makes the ribs. And it even tastes great on chicken!

This recipe was a hit at a BBQ I hosted last week!  We all loved it.  The only change I did was to sweeten the BBQ sauce a little bit with more brown sugar.  The rub was so fantastic that I use it all the time now on everything I BBQ!  Lots of ingredients but I think it's worth all the effort!!!

OK, I didn't care for the sauce, as is.  Maybe it was just me?  I thought the vinegar flavor was to strong so I ended up adding some molasses, celery salt, black pepper, salt, and a little more ketchup to come to a flavor I liked.  I would like to remind everyone that when you taste the sauce don't forget it will be getting basted over the other spices rubbed on the meat so don't be tempted to add a lot of heat to the sauce, unless you like it this way :) With my changes to the sauce and the recipes cooking times and rub my  husband thought theses were the best ribs he had ever tasted!  They went FAST!!  It was my first time making ribs and I was darn proud of them.

Congratulations Gail! You made the hubby very happy  with this recipe and he doesn't have to take me to my favorite restraunt for ribs anymore. This recipe by far beat their flavor. What an awesome blend of spices and your sauce is to die for. I didn't have much time and didn't let them sit overnight (only 3 hours) and mine came out a little tough. I will make sure it sits overnight from now on. No need to tinker with this recipe for it is perfect. Thanks sooooo much!

These were perfect! I followed the ingredients exactly, but instead of cooking them in the oven the night before, I used the spice rub on them overnight and the next day I put them in the crockpot for 2 1/2 hours and grilled and basted them. I knew if I cooked them the night before, the smell would make me want to eat them!

These ribs are AWESOME!!  My husband is a big ribs fan and he said these are some of the best he's ever had.  It takes a while to make, but the time is so worth it.  I will absolutely make this recipe again.  The only change I will make is that I will use a bit less of the brown sugar in the sauce because I like my sauce a little tangier.

I need help.  I made the sauce while the ribs were cooking and I'm glad I made it ahead of time.  Mine was way too hot.  What type of "Chili Sauce" should be used?  I used HOKAN Chili Sauce, and even adding more sugar couldn't bring it back.  I know I've messed up.  Please help.

These ribs were amazing! I had to alter the timing and do it all in one day - they were in the fridge 2-3 hours instead of overnight and they were still incredible.  Very flavorful and falling off the bone tender. My guests unanimously pronounced them the best ribs they had ever had.

This is worth the time - I thought the rub would be so spicy, but it adds just enough "zip".  I gave the barbeque sauce - neatly packaged - as a father's day gift!  side note: I used country style ribs - less cooking time in the oven.

Absolutely incredible - my boyfriend fell out of his chair when he ate these and made me promise never to make another sauce.  I cooked the ribs while making dinner the night before - needs a bit of planning, but it is well worth it.

Gail must be getting a big head by now but I'll add to it. By leaps and bounds this is the best rib recipe in the world. I know I've not tried them all, but I'd be hard pressed to think there is one better. I have friends who a year or two still beg for them. My change is a make twice the sauce and use it all to slather on there. Makes for wet, dirty get sauce all over your shirt, mouth, and hands ribs but that's a great thing. Cooked mine in the oven. The 2nd day did 240 degrees basting each 10 minutes for 30 - 40 minutes, then 350 uncovered for maybe 15. Last variation is used sweet chili sauce from the asian market. Made it more tangy. Great job Gail!!!

We loved this recipe!  Easy and very tasty.  Use Sriracha for a nice spicy rib!  Have made it twice and both times was "finger lickin' good"!  :)

These are fabulous, requested frequently at my house.  The only changes I make: double the sauce, and because we like heat in our sauce, is to sub 1/8 c. - scant 1/4 c. siracha for the chili sauce.  Lick-your-plate-clean awesome.

These were excellent!  My rating is based on the method and the spice rub.  I did not use the sauce in this recipe, as I opted for my local BBQ joint's sauce that they sell by the bottle.  These ribs were absolute perfection and everyone at our Easter table raved about them.  We used the rub on some BLSL chicken breasts and grilled and they were absolutely fabulous!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Gail!  Better than the restaurant's!

I like this recipe, but for those who don't Like cumin, this may not be for you. I think next time I'm either going to reduce the amount of cumin, or eliminate it all together because. My family Wasn't a fan

Made as directed. Cooking directions are spot on for ribs. Rub and sauce was good, just not my preference. Probably a regional thing for me. I will use a different rub.

FINALLY found a rib recipe that is awesome!  Thank you! Only thing I did differently was to the sauce I had to use white vinegar, ran out of apple cider vinegar, and I also used garlic and onion powder instead of crushed garlic and chopped onions to the sauce

The sauce was amazing, definitely a keeper. The oven time is too long at that high temp, the ribs were overcooked and dry. Next time I will cook them at a lower temp.

These ribs are awesome!  We made these for a football cookout.  Everyone loved them!  The rub is a great combination of spices; and the sauce is the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.  We love ribs, but have never made our own before.  They are just as good, if not better than ones you get at a famous rib restaurant.  So glad we decided to try this recipe!

I thought the BBQ sauce was way too sweet.  I like a more savory hickory sauce so I just added about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  PERFECT!!!1

These were wonderful.  I added liquid smoke because, let's face it, liquid smoke makes everything better.

These are amazing ribs. I have used this recipe a few times. Because I have little kids, I cut back quite a bit on the spices the second time and it was still intense for them. Because of this, I now make them their own ribs and make these for my husband and I. These are super spicy. If you have a weak tongue for spicy food, definitely cut back on the spices.

These were absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Only change I made was to rub the cooked garlic into the ribs before I put the rub on.  Everyone raved about them.

These ribs were delicious!  Followed the recipe, but didn't bbq due to the rain!  Took 2 days to make, but well worth it.  Baked in the oven second day and they were "fall-off-the-bone" fantastic!  Will definitely make again.

My family really liked this.  I cut the time in half by doing the rub first and then baking.  I refrigerated it for 3-4 hrs and did the rest in time for dinner.  So tasty by itself the dipping sauce wasn't needed.

We have made these ribs many times. Loved by all that have tasted them. Only works with the rub and sauce provided in the reciept. When feeling lazy I have tried bought rubs and sauces. Not as good as following the reciept.

I added this recipe to my box 6 weeks ago and have already made them 4 times! Infact, I have some in the oven right now. The ONLY drawback is the time involved. Although, it is not difficult at all, you need to plan ahead. But, boy are they worth the wait!!! This batch was at the request of my husband for his birthday dinner tomorrow.  The smell of the sauce cooking on the stove is pure heaven and there is no better sauce! Try them...you will LOVE them.

I would actually give this a 4.5. Very easy, followed instructions & ingredients to a "t", except I doubled the sauce. I had 3 racks of ribs(about 4 1/2 lbs).The sauce was a little too sweet & vinegary for our taste-we prefer smoky, but they were very good. Thank you!

By far the best ribs we've ever had. I didn't get to let them sit over night but they did sit for 7 hours. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Vinegar smells so strong I was afraid it might ruin it but I was wrong. Once all cooked the flavor was fabulous!! We used smoked wood chips in the grill and that worked out great too giving the ribs just a small hint of smoke flavor. I can't wait to make these again.

This recipe is a keeper.  It is a great recipe to use if you are having people over.. because there is no last minute worries about the ribs being "done" or good! We have made them 6 or 7 times and they've been great each time. Slam dunk! We don't use the sauce in the recipe... I just add a bit of water to our bottled sauce and "mop" it on the ribs as they are on the grill. (I haven't tried the one on the recipe.) I also use 1/2 the amount of cumin... but I'm not a big cumin fan, so consider that! Thanks!

This is always a crowd pleaser.  I followed the suggestions of others to double the sauce recipe, added 1t of liquid smoke and 1/4 c molasses.  Finger lickin' good. Thanks for a terrific recipe.

My husband dislikes ribs but we had some in the freezer so I had to make them.  They were so good and he asked if we could have them again sometime.  A true sign of a great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe which got rave reviews from my husband and kids.  It is very flavorful.  I took the advice of another reviewer and only used the rub on the meat side of the ribs and not the bone side.  I used all of the sauce for basting rather than save some for dipping.  Tender & delicious!  I think I will try boneless ribs next time for a comparison.  My only regret is that I didn't have more ribs for leftovers!

I am only rating the BBQ sauce because I used a different rub.  I loved this sauce.  I made the sauce as written above and cooked my ribs in the sauce, half way through the cooking time.  I did double this amount of sauce because we like alot of sauce.  I could eat this on anything.  I was very happy that it turns out to be a thick, stick the meat sauce.  I cant wait to eat this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

We've made this a couple of times, first time using homemade sauce in the recipe and the 2nd time with bottled sauce and itg was DELICIOUS both times. Rave reviews from everyone! Very moist and flavorful ribs. Planning on making them for Thanksgiving this year with the turkey. They're that good!

I didn't hate this recipe but didn't love it either. I didn't have time to cook ribs in oven ahead of time so I just used the rub and let them sit overnight in the fridge. The next night I went to cook them on the BBQ and realized that I was out of propane! I ended up cooking them in the oven (I hate using the oven in the summer) on 350 for about 1 1/2 hours. The family didn't care for the sauce, way to much vinegar. I ended up using a bottle brand of BBQ sauce and basted the ribs in the oven for the last 20 minutes or so. The ribs were "falling off the bone" tender and tastey but sorry to say not the best ribs I've had.

OK, so I cook ribs a lot.  My family enjoys them and I have used many different recipes.  Here are my thoughts on the ribs.  First, I put mine in the oven first thing this morning.  Took them out put the rub on and refrigerated them all day.  I think this is the same as doing them over night and personally I didn't want to cook 2 meals in one day.  They were fine that way.  I thought the sauce had way to much vinegar in it (and I'm a HUGE fan of vinegar)  I also thought it a little on the sweet side (also love the sugar)  I just couldn't figure out what all the hype was on these.  I'll stick to my old family recipe.  It just might be a matter of personal taste, but I just didn't think they were all that.  I'm not sure I would make these again, but I think that with recipes it is a personal choice to flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a 5 Plus.  My guy said they were the best ribs I've ever cooked - and I cook ribs alot!  Most reviewers made no changes and if they did they were insignificant.  The only change I made was in the cooking time.  I did 300 degrees for 1 hour and 250 for another hour.  More than that and my ribs would have been dry - but that is an individual call depending on the size of the baby backs.  Thank you so much submitter.

Best ribs I ever had!  Hubby also gave them a 10!
I followed another's suggestion and did the oven at 250 degrees for 2 hours only - was enough.  (used jarred garlic to rub on them).
Also, for the sauce I used Heinz Kicker Ketchup (hotter) instead of regular.  Added to the Chili Sauce, these were VERY HOT, but still had a sweet flavour.  We love em that way.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - it was definitely worth the work!

Are you kidding me?  I have to admit that I'm not usually a fan of pork.  In fact, my husband had to talk me into trying just one bite.  But once I did, I just couldn't stop!  I doubled the sauce recipe and used it all to baste the ribs, as suggested, and it turned out perfect.  I'm already looking forward to showing off this crowd-pleasing recipe at our next party.

Excellent recipe!!  The ribs were FULL OF FLAVOR.  It's time consuming but it's relatively easy.  I reduced the black pepper and chilli powder to half so it would not be too spicy for my kids--they still think it was too spicy but it's fine for me and my husband.  I didn't boil the sauce for a whole hour because after 30 minutes, you can see that the liquid has reduced and I was afraid that I wouldn't have enough sauce.  It thickened to a deep cranberry color and it clinged to the ribs very well.  I didn't give it 5 stars because, and this could be a personal preference, I think it should be just a "tad" sweeter.  For people who don't like their meat real sweet, this would be perfect.  I would definitely do this recipe again but I would increase the brown sugar--just a little bit.  I would also reduce the pepper and chilli powder even more.  My kids still prefer the maple syrup ribs (also very good, sweeter but not spicy) on this site and now I don't know if I should do the maple syrup ribs for the kids or just please me and my husband with this recipe!  Definitely try it--it's a keeper!

Worth the work. I did reduce the vingear because of others suggestion & also salt & pepper because we don't use much in cooking. I will make a change next time though because we used spareribs & the thinner ends got a little dry. I'll bake around 225 degrees for 2 hours. If we use country ribs I'd bake at 225 also, but maybe 2 1/2 hours then or 3. My husband & I think we'd also like to put them on the smoker instead of the grill just for the "smoke" flavor. I like the sweet sauce, but also the smokey kind also. I don't know why a couple of the reviews had a problem with the  ribs being tough because mine weren't.

I don't eat ribs but I asked my family to rate it - I said on a scale from 1 to 5; they said 10!!!!  Comments were the tenderness of the meat and the flavor of the sauce.  Will make again!

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago, the only change I made was adding a little Cajun seasoning. I used almost 7 lbs of ribs so I upped the ingredients a little. My kids couldn't eat enough, in fact my oldest ate almost as much as I did. Unbelievable recipe, will use again!!!

First of all -- Thank You Gail for this tremendous recipe.  These ribs are worth every minute of effort.  Because of the comments of several other reviewers about too much of a vinegar taste, I added about 3 extra tablespoons of brown sugar, as well as some tarragon and rosemary.  Otherwise, I left 'em alone. I fixed these for my wife for a birthday dinner -- she loved them.  So did the kids.  I have never cooked ribs before, but with these, everyone will think you're an expert.  Thanks again Gail!

We've made these ribs three times now and they are PERFECT!  The only thing, and I mean the ONLY thing we did differently, was add a bit more heat to the sauce.  Other than that, we have not changed a thing from the original recipe.

did on country style boneless ribs. My husband and I were not pleased with the flavor. It was WAY too vinegary for our tastes...and I cut the vinegar in half to begin with.....

Fabulous! I initially thought the rub would be too spicy and the sauce would have too much vinegar, but that wasn't the case at all. Here's what I did: I used the rub on raw T-bone steaks and refrigerated them overnight. I then made the sauce, adding a shot of Tabasco and a drizzle of honey, in which I briefly marinated the steaks. After 10 minutes on the BBQ, they were perfect! Can't wait to make these again, this time for guests.

I've made this several times now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. My boys loved them and requested often.  But it takes planning to make it. I decided to bake, rub then freeze them. When needed all I had to do was to baste and grill.   It wasn't as good. 

One day I accidentally I rubbed the ribs first. I then baked and chilled them. The next day I basted and grilled them according to recipe. The ribs tasted so good. Even better then the original. The spices had infused and fused  into the meat during baking. 

Since then I've been doing the rub, bake, chill and grill routine. Try it. You'll taste the difference. Don't need to bake with garlic first. Rub with spices and garlic then bake. After baking, don't open the parcel. Leave it to chill till needed the next day. Baste generously and frequently while grilling. Took 10 mins to have a glistening and inviting rack of ribs ready.

Tip: to save electricity, I bake for 1 and 1/2 hours, switche off the oven and leave the ribs to continue cooking (do not open oven door) till oven is cool. Then I just stash ribs in the fridge. The ribs were very tender and only needed 90 mins of baking.

I made it true to recipe, except I broiled ribs instead of grilling. They had great flavor and were very tender. I will make them again.

very tasty! Meat just about fell off the bone and very juicy! I liked the cider vinegar & lemon juice, gave it a little zing. The only thing I changed was I added some cayenne to the rub, I like it spicy.

I made these ribs multiple times last summer. My father, whole is a rib fanatic, raved about them to all of his friends from the first time that I made them. I'm so pumped that spring is here and it's time to pull out the charcoal grill! The rub and sauce are equally as amazing on chicken as well, so I triple the recipe and use it frequently. Be sure to make plenty of extra sauce because it's a million times better than anything you could buy in a bottle at the grocery store.

I use the dry rub, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit for the day.  Then I grill it on our Primo Grill low and slow for a few hours and baste it at the end with the sauce.   Thank you for the wonderful recipie!

Great ribs! Super tender - falling off the bone. The sauce was SPICY though. Not terribly bad, but not the sweet tangy bbq sauce we love. We will try it again with little or no chili sauce (I used sriracha) next time. Thanks for the good recipe.

I followed the instructions and even considered the majority from the reviews. The half teaspoon of liquid smoke was a great add-on for those that couldn't grill it, but you definitely won't need to double the sauce recipe. I excluded the chili sauce and just added another quarter cup of ketchup and dark brown sugar. The red pepper flake suggestion was on-point, though. The recipe was a little on the sweeter side. They were also really tender even though the membrane was left on. Overall, a fantastic recipe, especially if ribs aren't your forte.

We don't like anything hot so I didn't use the chili powder or cumin in the rub. Everything else I followed and they were delish. It takes some planning cause you need about 2 days to make them.

I think this is very good, fall off the bone. The blend of the rub makes these ribs. I followed everything exactly as mentioned, next time will cut back just a bit on the vinegar and some of the rub as found it a bit overpowering. The flavor was liked by all my in house critics, so will definitely make again. thanks for sharing

My first real attempt at ribs and they came out so well. By the time I removed them from the oven I could already tell that they were very tender. I don't think I would make ribs any other way.

The only ribs I will ever cook again. I've made them with only letting them sit for a few hours and over night. They are amazing either way but the extra time is better. You will want to double your sauce if not more.

I used 5lbs of pork country style ribs with the bone in, I sprinkled garlic powder instead of using fresh garlic sparingly over the ribs & cooked them in the oven on 300 for 2.5 hrs. They were a bit greasy, so after they cooled, I wiped them w paper towels & added the rub. I'm not really into really spicy food, so I opted to use 1 tsp of chili powder instead of 2. I tasted a small piece of the rib after I applied the rub... DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!! I

These ribs were awesome! I made them exactly as the recipe is posted at first but then added about a cup extra of ketchup and brown sugar to the sauce just to tone down the spice a little for the kids and all 4 kids gobble them up. I made the sauce the night before for convenience sake and baking the meat wrapped in foil made all the difference in tenderness.  These ribs were falling off of the bone. The sauce is the closest thing that I have found to the Jack Daniels sauce at TGI Fridays. I will be making this again and again for chicken, shrimp and pork.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

This recipe is worth the work and the only way I will make ribs now!! The sauce smells very strongly of vinegar, but once it is on the ribs, they are wonderful and so tender!

These were awesome!! I will be making these again for sure. Like many reviews suggested, I doubled the sauce and I used up nearly all of it. I also didn't add as much chili powder and cumin to the rub or as much chili sauce to the sauce (didn't want it too spicy as I was making it for kids too).

OmG, amazing!!! I made a short cut method and just put all the spices on the ribs while I baked them for 2 1/2 hours then used my favorite bbq sauce on the grill, no joke, these were the best ribs I've ever eaten or made!

I'm a long time subscriber of All Recipes and rarely review a recipe, although I admit I should do more.  I did take the time to review this one however, probably based on the reputation ribs and steaks have.  If someone is going to put their name out there for a rib/steak recipe I would hope it would be worth the time/money others would be putting into it to make it.

I took the chance on this recipe and I consider myself an intermediate working towards chef status cook.  This recipe went wrong for me on many different levels.  The first being the high level of vinegar and it went down from there.  The  cooking time for these ribs is also off the mark.  Again, I rarely rate recipes but felt I needed to take the time to write this review as there are so many rib recipes out there.  If you are going to put your name to something and people are going to spend their hard earned money preparing such a 'chefs like' dinner, please make it worth peoples time.  I appreciate the recipe, but it just wasn't worth the time, money and embarassment I felt after psyching my family up for bbqd ribs and serving this

These are the BEST ribs I have ever eaten. They were juicy and fell right off the bone. I doubled the sauce recipe so that we would have lots of sauce. I only had the ribs in the refrigerator for about 4 hours and they still came out perfect.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this meat did not fall off the bone like the other reviewers said.    I think it would need to be baked a whole lot longer to make that happen.  Family thought it was just OK.

These ribs are amazing.  My family ate every morsal and asked when we could have them again.  I'm planning to invite some friends for a barbeque so that I can treat them to this great recipe.

Great recipe and great cooking technique. I think I got the most out of the technique because I used my own rub and *gasp* bottled barbeque sauce. The sauce was from Montgomery Inn in Cincy, OH, so I knew it would be ok. :) With this recipe, BBQ ribs are easy to make and not as daunting as I thought!

Delicious! I cut the vinegar in half because it was too strong for me. I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime. I added a few shakes of hot pepper flakes to the sauce, be careful not to add too much because there's chili powder in the rub.

This is the only rib recipe that I use. My son absolutely loves ribs, now he prefers that I make them instead of going out for them. I'm not a rib fan, but these have made a believer out of me. The meat was falling off the bone, very flavorful. Yum!

This sauce is a wonderful base.  But any recipe I make I always change things a bit.  I did double the sauce and added ½ cup molasses,1 T spicy brown mustard, 1 tsp celery seed, ½ tsp red pepper flakes and ¼ cup dry red wine.  It was wonderful.

This is a fantastic recipe. We've made it twice and neither time were we able to refrigerate overnight with the rub so we just let it sit on there a few hours. We also ended up with quite a bit of leftover sauce even though we put it out for extra on the side. No worries though cuz it was so good we used it for pulled pork sandwiches a few days later.

Used most of the sauce on the ribs though think I should have left some for the dipping part. Next time I may double the sauce. I felt it was missing something to the flavor but not sure what it was. Served with tater tots and steamed broccoli with bacon bits.

Happy 4th!!! I have never made baby back ribs before, have always relied on others to do it. We just finished our barbecue and I had to rate this recipe as outstanding! I followed it to a T, except I only let them sit with the rub for 4 hours after baking them this morning. SO tender, and hubby who always like to slather everything with extra barbecue sauce was happy with the ribs as is. My kids loved them too. Served with Southern Potato Salad from this site...and a fresh fruit salad.   Thank you for taking the fear of baby backs away! Off to see the fireworks!

These were tasty, and the sauce was great, but I don't know what I did wrong- they were not as tender as I would have liked.  I'll definitely attempt again.  I've used slow-cooker rib recipes that fall off the bone, so this was a little disappointing.

These were the BEST Ribs I ever had.  My husband was very skeptical about this recipe...well, he isn't anymore!  We tossed a coin to see who would get the last bone.  Worth the extra work and absolutely finger-lickin' GOOD!!!

I have made these ribs for the past 2 years. I can't count the times I have been asked for the recipe. I always make way more that should be necessary because people eat so much.

These were excellent!  So moist and tender - well worth the amount of time it took to prepare them in advance.  I used a bottled barbecue sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) instead of making the one in the recipe, just because we already had that on hand and knew that we liked that flavor.  I will definitely use this method for preparing baby back ribs again!

I had to cook the ribs for about 3 hours to make them really tender.  Came out great.  Highly recommend.   I sauced them overnight as well.

I've been a rib lover for years and have tried many different recipes and this one is by far and away the best one I've tried.
Mandassil's advise about continuing cooking in the oven works great. 
Anybody who doesn't have a smoker and doesn't use this recipe is just wasting their rack of ribs.

So good. We make these ribs for special occasions and there is never left overs. A lot of this recipe is made ahead of time except for the grilling. So it frees us up to enjoy the people we are entertaining !!

I am rating this a 2-star based solely on the sauce part of the recipe. First of all, I had a new jar of rub that I had purchased so I just used that to rub the ribs with instead of the collection of spices in the recipe. So this rating does not cover the first day one of the process. But, the sauce, however, was not. First of all, the whole house smelled like vinegar - strong vinegar - while it was simmering. Then, just before dousing the ribs, I decided to taste the sauce. OMG, it was sooooo HOT. Perhaps I used the wrong kind of chili sauce. I don't know, but there was no way my family could have eaten the ribs with that sauce on it. I discarded the double batch and just opted for bottled barbecue sauce. Sorry about that but it had to be said!

My go to method for cooking ribs. I never have time to make the rub or allow the ribs to sit overnight, I just rub the ribs with Famous Dave's and follow the cooking instructions. Always turn out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this today, followed the instructions to a T except for letting them sit overnight. I cooked them in the oven, let cool for about an hour then rubbed them with the dry rub. (At this point the meat was already falling off the bone)  Then straight to the grill basting while grilling them. They were delicious, got compliments from my guests, it's a definable winner that I will make again. I took the advice of previous reviews and doubled the sauce recipe and have a jar in the fridge for the rest of this week.

Fabulous- huge hit with everyone. Took the recommendation to  double the recipe and used molasses in place of half the vinegar. Used sweet chili sauce in the sauce and also smoked paprika in the rub.

Amazing and so easy!! I followed the recipe exactly except for two small steps. After I baked the ribs I followed the advice of another reviewer and rubbed the garlic cloves into the meat before I added the rub. They are like butter after baking for 2.5 hours! And I made a double batch of sauce.  I am already craving them! Too bad there weren't any leftovers!

The best ribs, I've ever made! This will be my go to when it comes to ribs. 
I baked them in the oven, instead of on BBQ. Fall of the bone & with lots of flavour.

Been making this recipe for about 5 years now and thought the poster deserved some recognition because this is by far the best rib recipe I have ever tried and I'm very picky when it comes to ribs, restaurants rarely live up to expectations . Cooking time vary wildly depending on your oven, I have made these in many ovens all with different cook times so best to keep checking them. Watch out for the chili sauce, they don't mean hot sauce, I do use hot sauce but adjust for spice level. Every single person I have made these for thinks they are amazing  and wants the recipe

These ribs totally rocked our house.  This is our second go around with this recipe.  The 2-3 hours on low in oven, followed by the rub and the overnight marinating time, really makes the difference.  My husband likes to grill so he enjoys taking over the last step.   Family enjoys it!

FANTASTIC!  I had almost 6 lbs of ribs and there was plenty of rub.  I did increase the sauce though and added about 1-2 Tbl of apricot jam.  So simple and very tasty.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

Fantastic!  Don't be afraid of the rub. Seems like a lot of cumin, but pairs very well with the BBQ sauce. Savory and sweet. I left them in the rub for two days and I think the one day longer longer is probably better. Yum.

It has been many years since I have done ribs and this was a big hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. I will definitely use this recipe the next time ribs are on the menu. It does take 36 hours, since the ribs have to be slow cooked 2 1/2 hours the night before, but the sauce is what really makes this.

My first attempt at grilling ribs.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Forgot to roast them the night before so did them the next morning for 2 1/2 hours, rubbed with the dry spices and let them marinate refrigerated for about 4 hours.  Still the best ribs I ever tasted!  Fall-off-the-bone amazing!!!!  Will definitely repeat this recipe!

Made these for the first time for a graduation party and followed the recipe exactly. They were a huge hit and people loved the sauce! I was a little worried about the sauce as it seems a little runny after cooking for an hour. But it thickened more after removing it from heat. Loved these and will definitely make again. However, next time I will put them in the over before 9PM - should have looked at the cooking time more closely earlier in the day!

Savory,  Would make again.  I don't think it's 5 star worthy, but it might be because I'm not used to the cumin flavors.  It's different, and good, so it stays on the recipe list.  If you give it a try, you might like it.  I won't make it too frequent however due to the amount of sugar used in the recipe.

Delicious. Loved the fact that they could be cooked the day before. Made for way quicker supper. Won't do it any other way from now on. Sauce was good too. Might like it a bit spicier but still tasty. Ribs were tender yet not over cooked. Perfect.

I didn't have time so I made BBQ sauce as shown on recipe and marinated overnight without pre-grill(but add those spices in the sauce except garlic)....wow...still came out fantastic!! when I made sauce I felt its a bit too spicy but when you bake/grill it, the sauce came out much milder with meat. We used pressure oven to cook.
I honestly overwhelmed all those spices to buy as I don't have any (i dobt cook much) but I did it only because I saw lots of great ratings/reviews and I am glad I did that overwhelming spice/sauce shopping because its really worth it...never thought we can make rib this good at home!! Thank you for sharing wonderful recipe!!

Made these tonight and my mom said to make this recipe every time for bbq ribs.  I baked them at 300 for 2.5 hours, did the rub for overnight rest.  I broiled them and basted 3 times for each side.  Wonderful.

When I started baking the ribs I thought I'd be home to turn off the oven but I had to make up a tennis match and then golf so I put the oven on timer and left it to sit for an additional 4 hours before I got home.  It was still warm!  I then put the rub and placed it in the refrig.  After grilling these ribs with the sauce, they were soooo tender and juicy.  It was perfect and I'll make this again, for sure.

I made this with one small change. I was out of chili powder, so I used one quarter the amount of cayenne. It was great. made it for a Labour day pay and everyone said the ribs were great. a little kick, but still get the sweetness of the sauce. definitely my go to recipe for ribs.

These ribs are fantastic! The only thing I changed was to cut the cumin in half, and added a couple teaspoons of liquid smoke to the sauce. A-ok!! We love them! Very tender and flavorful!

Absolutely delicious.  Baked the ribs in foil packs. Left the sliced garlic on once cooked. Made the rub as is except substituted 1/2  T chipotle chili for regular chili. For the sauce I added a tsp liquid smoke as another reviewer recommended.  Good call. Also I accidentally put an entire lemon in so added about 1/8 cup molasses

Outstanding sauce! I made this for the first time and took the advice and made twice the amount of sauce, and now I'm sorry I didn't make ten times the amount as you can bottle it up and keep it in your fridge right? Nevertheless lip smacking sauce and I will never ever buy BBQ sauce from the store again. And if you make the sauce neither will you. Thanks for sharing awesome awesome recipe! Boom!

Used this recipe over the weekend for a big family BBQ. Everyone raved about these ribs being the best they have ever had! Only change I made was because i did not have chili sauce, so I added some chili powder and some cayenne hot sauce.

I followed the directions exactly, and they were perfect. Baking them first then marinading them overnight with the rub created a delicious, fall of the bone rib. I used purchased BBQ sauce, but used the exact ingredients and measures for the rub. Perfect spicy for me and my husband, but a bit much for our son. Maybe next time I'll use less of the rub on a section of the slab for him. What a great recipe!!

I followed other reviewers and double the recipe for the BBQ Sauce and basted continuously while on the BBQ.  Didn't really need the dipping sauce.  Did exactly as the recipe is written.  Absolutely FABULOUS! Will make again and again...in the winter...ill pop in the oven!  Thanks so much for sharing Gail!

Finger licking GOOD!!!!! Sauce was amazing. Only thing I changed was added liquid smoke to the sauce. Everyone absolutely LOVED them. The sauce was superb and not much work needed on the second day. Just heat your grill and baste with sauce. We'll worth the effort!!!!!

Outstanding recipe. Double the sauce for sure. Sauce was very sweet and good for those of low-spice tolerance.  Kids ate it up.  Totally worth the effort.

Delicious! Took a couple of tips from other reviewers by doubling the amount, adding red pepper flakes, brown sugar, liquid smoke, and mashing the garlic the ribs were baked with before adding the rub. Excellent rib recipe. Thank you!!

Absolutely great recipe!!!!
The seasonings were perfect!!!
My husband and I had a cook-off to see who could make better ribs, and I won hands down!!
Next time will precook the ribs for 2 hrs @300 instead of 2 1/2 hrs they were already falling off the bone.
I had never made homemade BBQ sauce before until this recipe it turned out great and very easy the only it had to much of an cider vinegar flavor next i will use a 1/2 of a cup. Since the vinegar was so over powering i add more of the other ingredients to calm it down and i also added a dash of liquid smoke it come out perfect!!! I will definitely use this recipe again!!

I followed most of the instructions. The only exceptions I made were to double the sauce (in retrospect it wasn't necessary for us) and I added a quarter tsp of liquid smoke. We enjoyed these ribs but decided that in the future we would make a couple modifications. We like more of a sweet sauce and It seems the chili sauce overpowered the sauce. Next time we will cut the amount of chili sauce and perhaps increase the brown sugar.

This version of ribs is very much like a recipe a native Aruban gave me on one of our trips, exact same technique, slightly different rub and sauce, so now I have two and I really can't say which I like best, they are both excellent.  I love the fact that they are so incredibly easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was pretty much spot on!  I've made a lot of ribs, and this recipe is great.  I made some small changes (some suggested by others).  I used brown sugar instead of white, 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar the sauce instead of a half cup.  I used Thai Chili Sauce and it was just the right heat.  I also added 1/2 tsp of liquid hickory smoke to the sauce.  One prep change I would suggest is to do them in a pressure cooker for 45min to 1hr instead of the oven (if you like them moister).  People who find them too dry should check their ACTUAL oven temp, and also keep a close eye on the BBQ cooking process.  My BBQ tends to be hot, so I cooked them with the lid up.

The sauce was very, very good and the rub added excellent flavor. However after baking the ribs for 2 1/2 hours they still were not tender enough for my family's liking. I wanted them to be fall off the bone tender and they were not even close. Next time I will cook them in the crock pot before grilling.

For a meal that took 2 days to make, this was just ok. The rub and/or sauce (I couldn't tell which one) was very heavy with chili/paprika taste. Mine also came out a little overdone but I think that's because my oven tends to run hot. So if I make this again, I'll only cook it for 2 hours. I took the other reviewer's advice and smashed the roasted garlic into the ribs just before the rub--not that we could taste it. I had used the Sweet Coleslaw recipe from this site as well as some garlic bread. The hubs and kids were happy, although we all knew this wasn't anything spectacular.

ABSOLUTE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!  My family does like too much spice so we omitted all pepper/spice ingredients with the exception of a dash of chili powder.  I also doubled the lemon juice which gave it a nice tangy flavor.  These are our most FAVORITE summer BBQ meal of all time!!!  I get compliments ALL the time and am asked for the recipe every time!!!! One word....AMAZING!!!!!

These ribs turned out great!!They were so tender we had to each them with a fork! The meat fell right off the bone. I did add an extra tsp of garlic in the first step. I thought I had chili sauce - but when i dug it out of the pantry it was cocktail sauce! I googled substitutes and ended up using 1/4 c extra ketchup 1 tsp cinnimin and a dash of all spice with a squirt of spicy brown mustard.... sounded gross to me but it really did add the same sort of flavor that chili sauce does. I also used minced dried onion instead of fresh. The sauce came out terrific! We will have these again soon!

Was a little skeptical that the ribs would dry out and then be even drier when grilled but they were incredible. Definitely my favorite rib recipe i've ever made & will be used continually going forward. My family loved them and there were no leftovers...

I had nothing but problems with this recipe from the beginning.  (not anyone's fault but my own).  I screwed up the chili sauce though they should be more specific about what kind of chili sauce in this recipe.  Then I messed up the spices, trying to double everything since I'd added too much of the chili sauce.  Even doubling everything, it tasted way to vineragy (spelling?), and I'd left the vinegar amount half of the original calling for it.  I baked in oven as specified, it came out so dry and I wasn't sure then it would turn out, but continued.  Then today I put it on the grill and it was not pretty.  As in, flames.  Charcoal and flames greeted me when I went to check on it after five minutes.  I will not be trying this recipe again.  At least not unless my husband can be here to help me.  I give it 1 star since I couldn't eat it as the star indicates "Couldn't eat it" as the rating.

I love this recipe!! Every one who trys them wants the recipe! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. The only thing I do different is I don't put them on a rack in my roaster and I cook them longer as they aren't that tender after the 2 1/2 hrs.

Like others have said, believe the hype. These ribs were amazing. I made some without the sauce for my niece who's really picky and the rest with the sauce. Both were delicious but yes, the sauce is unbelievable. Time consuming yes, but oh so worth it!!!

These were delicious.  My husband will eat ribs, but is not a huge fan. He said "You can make these any time!".  Because we wanted to have them same day, I sprinkled (generously) the rub after 1 hr  in the oven, covered them with foil and left them in for almost 3 hours total with a little water in the bottom of the pans.  The flavour baked into the meat and we didn't have to wait for it to cool.  I made the sauce, and put it on while the ribs were still hot, then put on them BBQ.  These will be a regular treat in our house from now on.

I added 1 t. each of liquid smoke and molasses. Made one full recipe for one rack (appx 2 lb)  I kept tasting and thinking it was a lil too much vinegar so I added a bit more ketchup.  Still a bit dubious but as has been said, great once on the meat. Mixed and just lightly sprinkled with rub.  I deviated a bit in cooking, too lazy the day before to mess with it.  Used my stove top smoker and let it go for the full time.  Ater the chips burn up it becomes like an oven.  Let it cool down then sauced and reheated in oven then under the broiler a bit.  Definitely a do again.

Great recipe!  I didn't have chili sauce so I used chili powder and a little extra ketchup and it still turned out fabulous!  Our guests immediately asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
