These no-bake cheesecakes were a hit. Believe it or not, this is not an overly sweet desert and the ganache toping adds just enough sweetness.
Modifications & Method:
I upped the cookie crumbs to accommodate a batch of 12, to fill the muffin pan (1 1/3c. crumbs + 1/3c. butter). When portioning the peanut butter & cream cheese mixture I didn’t make them “level”, I made a dip in the centre to hold the ganache. I also did not whip the toping as I love the shiny & silky appearance of ganache.

My favourite combo!
I make these whenever I want to totally indulge.  For added indulgence I add mini peanut butter cups on top, and sometimes even a bit of chocolate drizzle!

I thought this recipe was great!  I used gluten-free sandwich cookie crumbs (from which I removed the cream) and baked them in the oven first as I was worried they'd get soggy (7 minutes at 350). There was definitely enough peanut butter/cream cheese mixture to make two more cakes, so next time I'll increase the cookie amount a little to accommodate.  I also didn't whip the ganache at the end and just poured it on when it had cooled a bit.  It made a nice, shiny top that I stuck half of a peanut butter cup in.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  They are the perfect size and I love the fact that they are frozen.  Great for unexpected company.

These were so easy! I was able to get 12 out of a batch and each still had plenty of filling. Only thing I did different was used chocolate Graham cracker crumbs. Perfect recipe to satisfy your sweet tooth!

I will use a little less peanut butter next time as the cream cheese taste got lost.  But very tasty!

to describe it as a rich is an understatement. It was super easy to make and my son loved it but honestly you could make them like Reese's peanut butter cup size that would be just fine. I did not have dark chocolate flakes so I just used dark chocolate morsels and melted them before I mix them in with the whipping cream.
I also couldn't find the recommended cookies so I used chocolate grahams, crushed them up with some butter and they worked fine.

I found these to be super rich. I ended up cutting them in quarters for smaller portions. I also took the suggestion on the footnote and used Baileys instead of cream so I don't think the ganache set up like it would have using just the straight cream. I sent them to work with my husband.
