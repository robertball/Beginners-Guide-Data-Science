Great recipe, excellent flavour.  
In my opinion it doesn't need the browning sauce. And there was no measurement for a seasoning sauce - didn't know what it was, so didn't use that either. 
I did substitute some of the broth with left over roast beef gravy for better flavour. Plus I just didn't want to waste anything.

From that point I just put everything in the crockpot except for potatoes - it's quite hearty enough without them - and cooked on low for about 8 hours. 

Makes a ton of soup which suits me well as I try to have as many meals in the freezer as possible to suit my busy life. 

Just as a postscript - I think the importance of sautéing vegetables for any soup is sometimes under-rated. It's a step that imparts so much flavour, and really doesn't take that much time.

A fantastic soup.  I found that 3/4 c of barley made it very thick.  I would cut it down next time to 1/2 to 2/3 c.  The wine difinitely gives it a nice flavour.

This soup was quite hearty, so I increased the beef stock to 12 cups from 10.  Also, the recipe ingredients did not list the Bay Leaf, although the instructions do.  Also, the instructions don't tell you when to use the garlic that is listed in the ingredients, so I sauteed it with the celery, onions and carrots.  I used Campbell's Beef Broth (Low Sodium a must!) in the boxes, NOT the cans...I didn't want the tinny taste that usually stems from a can.

Was a good soup, but I imagine that it will be much more flavourful the next day.

This is a wonderful, easy, hearty soup.  I tried it once w/o the wine and got raves when I shared it with an ailing friend.  The second time with the wine it was even better! A great use for leftover beef. Great with crusty french bread and a salad.  Next day even better!

Love the cabbage and red wine in this recipe! I also added one can of petite diced tomatoes (undrained), and I doubled all of the veggies except potato (which I actually halved & used red potato). Used dried italian herb mix instead of thyme, increased broth by a few cups, and did not use browning sauce. Oops! Bought regular pearlized barley instead of quick-cooking... had to simmer extra half-hour, but it was excellent nonetheless! I used Xmas dinner's left-over prime rib for the beef, ooooh yummy.

Great recipe, although some proofreading from the submitter would have been a good idea. The ingredients list is missing the BAY LEAF and the directions is missing the GARLIC. I forgot the garlic and it tasted fine. I would recommend a bit more beef stock since the soup turns out very chunky. You don't really need to add salt if you get regular not low-sodium beef broth. Overall great classic recipe.

I loved this recipe, but, I did modify, only slightly. I took about six cups of water , and dissolved two packets of SODIUM FREE HERBOX Instant Broth Seasoning, Beef Flavor, no MSG, no Gluten, made by Hormel Foods.  I also pressure cooked some stew beef and used that, and the liquid from that, to add to my huge pot.  I doubled everything, and did not add the barley until everything else was in there.  Oh, and instead of wine, I used a really dark double dunken beer, one bottle.  Made enough for an army, so I froze some for later!  Hearty soup, didn't miss the sodium at all!

We both loved this soup. It was hearty, very flavourful and very filling. I did make a few changes due to personal taste. I didn't add the potatoes or the cabbage but did add a package of sliced cremini mushrooms. I cut the barley back to 1/2 cup after reading the reviews and it was still very thick. I didn't add browning sauce, couldn't find any in our area so I added a cap full of Bovril. There was no fresh thyme to be found so after googling it I added 1tsp of dried. This is my new favourite soup from this site and I will be making it again and again. Thanks so much for sharing  BarbCA.

So delicious! The only change I made was by using lentils instead as I was out of barley. My hubby loved it! Next time I'll be sure to have the barley on hand.

Really good!  I made this during the Superbowl for my best friend.  It was simple enough that I could pay attention to the game easily and he and I absolutely loved the beefy flavor and the barley.

This was a great recipe!  I did make a couple of changes.  First, I used mushrooms (baby bella) instead of potatoes, since I figured they would taste very good with the soup and since barley already provides enough starch.  Secondly, I used raw sirloin.  After sauteeing the vegetables, I added the cabbage and sauteed it with them.  Then, I removed the vegetables from the pan and added just the meat.  I browned the meat and added the mushrooms, then I deglazed the pan with the wine.  After that, I added the vegetables back to the soup, and finally added the broth and the barley.  This soup was amazingly good, and I will definitely make it again and again!

Delicious, and I haven't even added the wine! It was hard to stop tasting the broth!
I had some tough beef round leftover that seemed a shame to throw out. Sliced it thin and in small pieces and it worked out just fine. I thought I had barley after starting this creation but had to substitute lentils. I did not have any dried or fresh thyme. I used 64 oz of lower sodium beef broth, a few more chopped vegetables than stated, some left over canned diced tomatoes and I don't feel like I have to add too much more to enhance the flavor. I did not add the potatoes or browning sauce. Because I added more vegetables and 2 Cups less broth, the soup is a thicker vegetable soup. Healthy and delicious!

This recipe is a very good base for someone making soup for the first time.  I used leftover brisket and added the drippings, a handful of peppercorns, and whole garlic cloves.  Perfect for those blustery nights.

This recipe was great. I made it two weeks ago and am making it again tonight. I made it with a diced up sirloin steak. I doubled the wine to 1 cup  and added garlic and mushrooms. Tonight I am going to try it with the 'Dumplings' recipe also from this site.

I have made this so many times over the years.  I just discovered that I haven't reviewed it.  It is absolutely delicious and a winter favorite in our house.  The only change I make is using hamburger instead of the beef roast.  I usually make it on the stove top, but I've made it in the crock pot for events and it turns out great.  I'm sure you will enjoy this recipe.

I made it more as a slow cooker meal. So I didn't cook meat before hand, so no oil. Also I didn't add the cabbage, but added fresh basil, cilantro, and dried bay leafs. Overall good meal, and great to freeze for later.

This was an excellent recipe!  Very flavorful.  I cooked my roast in a slow cooker, then used the broth in the soup (and added more broth to it.)  I loved the addition of the cabbage.

I don't make soup often because of all the chopping.  However, this one is worth it.  It is very flavorful.
 
Made it again 3/2006.  I used sirloin and didn't use the cabbage.  I also added a can of chopped tomatoes.

Fantastic!  Great way to use leftovers.  Had a leftover pot roast with potatoes, carrots and onions.  Cut all that up finely, added some extra fresh carrots, celery, garlic and onions as well as soy sauce.  Omitted wine and cabbage as I didn't have any on hand.  Simmered entire pot for about 30 minutes total.  The house smelled wonderful!  Soup thickened upon cooling as barley absorbed the liquids. Made a huge pot of thick comforting soup.

Good but I would have like a little more spice or herbs.  I used left over brisket which worked great.  Loved all the vegies!  Wish I had had the browning sauce but I didn't.  Good recipe!

I halved the recipe & made it with leftover london broil. I ommited the celery (don't like it) & the browning sauce (don't have any). I bought quick cooking barley & added it during the last 15 mins of cooking ( you can find barley by the rice, I got mine at King Soopers). Make sure you take the bay leaf out at the end, the directions do not say to. It was good but lacking flavor. Thanks.

I have made this a few times for my family. My daughter loves all the veggies in it. I love to make a large pot on a Sunday, this way we have it for the week.

This was excellent!! There are only 3 of us in my family and we can never eat a whole london broil. I do not like reheated red meat.  This was a great way to use the leftovers.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks.

Used Napa instead of cabbage and it was very good. Threw in some cooked green beans as well because I had them! Definitely make again.

Great Soup, i followed the recipe to a T and served it at a party and most people liked it. Turned out to be a little salty, I used beef base instead of bullion or broth so i am not sure if that made the difference. I think next time i will try it with bullion instead, or low sodium broth. I also did not add the seasoning salt or the browning sauce.

This is a great soup I had made similar before, this time I used leftover Corned Beef and the resulting water(diluted by 50% water) also I didnt add salt due to the stock that's why I cut with water. I didn't brown the corned beef as it would ruin the coned beef's texture, I just fork pulled it like pulled pork. I also added more barley. This was an excellent use of both leftover CB as well as a great way to use the fragrant stock!

Didn't have any potatoes but it was still good. i agree that the barley should be cut down - I used 2/3 cup and found it too thick. Also, I ended up adding water to thin out the soup. But ease of cooking, flavor - can't be beat.

We all enjoyed this recipe. I cut the recipe in half to feed the three of us, and I still have leftovers. I first made "Kathy's Roast and Vegetables" (also on this site), and then used some of the leftover meat in this soup. I would agree that adding more beef broth than called for would help--it is pretty chock full of ingredients. I try that next time.

Made it exactly to the recipe. Kind of bland at the end. Added a can of beans and a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Much better. Actually, the next time I make this soup I’ll add more celery, carrots and cabbage. May substitute spinach for cabbage.

Made this tonight for the family.  Omitted the browning sauce.  Added rosemary, oregano with the bay leaf and thyme. Cooking time was about an hour for the barley. Staggered the addition of the potatoes to the last 20/30 minutes. Cabbage last 10/15. Then at the very end, the hubs hit it with a little balsamic. Was very good.

This seemed like a really great recipe when I read it online, but  the directions to use "leftover potroast" wasn't a good thing, as we were using raw stew meat. 

PLUS, pearl barley, which is all that is availavle here, takes TONS longer to cook and has to go through a couple of steps before it can be added to the mix. 

SO. I would say that if you are starting with raw meat instead of leftovers, and don't have 'regular' barley, that you need to allow about 3-4 hours to make this recipe. 

Or find a different one, which is what I should have done.

Excellent hearty soup!  Didn't substitute a thing, made it exactly as directed and was very happy with the end result!  Next time I might try the Italian herb mix instead of the thyme as I love basil and oregano.  Definitely a keeper!

"stick -to-your-ribs" GOOD! I used everything except celery and browning sauce. I had made a round roast that was too tough to eat, so I cut it up in cubes and put it in the slow cooker with the soup. in a couple of hours it was melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS!

We enjoyed this recipe, but it was too bland for our tastes.  So I recommend adding a can of diced tomatoes (do not drain), and additional spices, such as basil and/or oregano. I used a slow cooker as well.

Great soup - used a portion of a left over beef roast /broth from the slow cooker.  Left out the potatoes but added some frozen vegetables.  For liquid, I used 32oz beef broth with the existing broth / meat that I saved prior.  I used 1 cup of the barley.

Awesome soup for a cold dreary night!  We had ours with drop biscuits!  I used ground beef and not one complaint, only complements!  My son even asked if I kept the recipe.  He asked that I not change a thing.  I told him I left out the cabbage and he said it wasn't necessary. I would have to agree.  This is a keeper.

The spices used in this recipe really make it good.   I didn't add any extra salt, but was generous with the pepper to make the soup a little more bold (but not spicy hot).   I added extra liquid as others suggested (12 cups instead of 10).   At first, I thought it was too much and started to regret that decision, but after an hour or more of a slow simmer, the soup did thicken.   I added some frozen (previously blanched) tomatoes that I had on hand.   I did not back off on the barley (as some suggested), and since I added more liquid, I then added a little more barley.   Maybe I just like the extra barley.   I will definitely make this time and again.

Delicious soup! Hearty and satisfying during these cold winter days. Left out potatoes and cabbage. Next time will do potatoes and leave out barley and cabbage. Very versatile recipe. Found the browning sauce and seasoning and it gives it good color and flavor.

Very good.  Made it with chicken stock because I couldn't find low sodium beef broth.  Also used dry thyme vs fresh.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Felt it needed a little bit more flavour perhaps due to the lack of salt, but served it with a dollop of  horseradish and that was a success!

I am making it for the 2nd time. The 1st time, I made my broth with a left over roast.  I am in the process of making it and again I am unclear when it says to cook the barley until soft but not mushy -roughly how long that takes???.  I have never cooked barley and find myself checking it every few minutes. I can't remember how long it took from the first run!  It is a very tasty, hearty soup. Perfect for a cold, rainy November day!

I used leftover pot roast, i.e. cooked potatoes, carrots and onions.  I also used a non-alcoholic red wine blend.  I is the best beef and barley soup I've ever made.  Wonderful.

Had some leftover prime rib and this seemed like a good way to use it. Followed recipe exactly. It was delicious, although seemed a little flat. I am going to try adding a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste while cooking the vegetables.

I followed this recipe exactly as was written and it was absolutely awesome.  I belong to Weight Watchers so I had to figure out the points (4).  This will be a staple in my house.  No need to change anything!

As others suggested I added a can of diced tomatoes with juice, no cabbage, two cups extra broth.  This was an excellent hearty soup! Thanks!

This is awesome soup! I threw it all together in the crock pot. I decreased the amount of stock (water plus beef bullion) to 8 cups. I followed some of the reviews and only used 1/2 cup barley. I like barley so next time I will add the whole amount. I took some to a friend who is recovering from pneumonia. She said who needs pills when you have this soup? I will definitely make this again.

Would definitely make this again.  I used 10 cups water and 8 beef cubes due to the fact that the beef in the Dominican Republic has NO flavour.  I browned the beef with onions, added the water and beef cubes.  Once the beef was starting to get tender, I added the barley (we can actually get barley here now!).  When that was almost cooked, I added the rest of the ingredients minus the cabbage as I don't eat it.  Soup turned out great.  Oh, and I didn't add the red wine because if I opened the bottle, well......let's just leave it at that ;)  Otherwise, great soup!

Used homemade beef bone broth for this and upped the amounts of spices...got great reviews from the family!
