For the flakiest scones use frozen butter grated on the coarse side of a box grater. The little flakes of butter mix in so, well no need to use a pastry blender. 
I too used all AP flour for light delicate scones.

I read the reviews first before making this recipe. I followed everyone's advice and used all purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour. They are really good. Moist and flavourful in the middle. I brushed them with a milk wash on top so they wouldnt dry out and they tasted amazing. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

Uses all purpose flour instead of wheat.  Scones did not rise like I expected so they were dense.  Flavor was good.

These were absolutely amazing! I made Carmel and sugar sauce to go with! I highly recommend you do the same! Carmel sauce: Melt 2 tbs butter, add 1+1/2 cup of sugar semis a lot but it goes a long way, melt together. Add 2-3 tbs of milk. Enjoy warm. And sugar sauce is just powder sugar and milk stored together! Enjoy!

I used all AP flour and whole milk. These went fast. I immediately made a second batch. So good.

I used this recipe since it didn't call for eggs and I was out. I made several other change though too - greek yogurt instead of sour cream, milk instead of half & half, and almond extract instead of vanilla. I also added a cup of fresh mulberries. They are super moist and have a great flavor. I'll make them again for sure!

yum! I was out of eggs and had some sour cream to use up, so this was perfect. I used all-purpose flour instead of the whole wheat.  I used skim milk instead of half-and-half, because that's all I had. I also added a smidgeon of nutmeg. Delicious! Light, fluffy, moist, and slightly sweet. :)

425 was too high next time maybe 400 for 15 minutes to start. They were more work then I thought and had to add more cream because couldn't work dough too much flour. Did 2 1/2 cups AP flour no whole wheat flour. Maybe 2 cups enough.

The only change I made was to grate the butter and place in the freezer while I was getting all the rest of ingredients ready. All four of my grandsons  loved them , as I did, with my coffee.

Delicious taste but extremely crumbly. Moist and flavourful in the middle. Followed other reviewers advice and used all purpose in lieu of whole wheat flour.
