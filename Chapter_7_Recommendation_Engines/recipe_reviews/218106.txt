Wow!  This is a keeper!  I made it true to the recipe - great taste and the hubby gave this 10 stars.  I have more marinating in the refrigerator and am going to do a stir fry with it tomorrow.  I am sure it will be great.  I did skewers of chicken and skewers of vegetables and rice.  Perfect dinner for us.  Thank you!

This is my recipe. It tastes like the chicken wings you would get at a Chinese buffet. The only thing different that I sometimes do is add a heaping teaspoon of Ground Ginger instead of fresh. Both are great! Enjoy!

Wow - what a great recipe!  I only used this for the marinade:  I used boneless chicken thighs (my husband's favorite cut of the chicken), and marinated them about 10 hours; anything more would have been too much, in my opinion.  I was afraid they would be too salty (we cook with very little salt), but happily I was wrong.  I didn't have enough green onion so used about 1/4 tsp onion powder in the marinade, and used the green onion I had as a garnish.  I thought about adding a small (1/2 - 1 tsp) of sesame oil, but I think it would gave "muddied" the flavors.  We grilled the thighs whole, instead of as kebabs, as my experience with kebabs is that it is very difficult to not overcook so that the meat is too dry.  Served this with white rice, steamed broccoli, and an Asian carrot and cucumber slaw (I'll post the recipe) - husband said 10 stars.  Thanks for a great recipe!  (My husband said I should have boiled the left-over marinade, and used it over the rice.)

My husband really enjoyed these! My husband made the full amount of the marinade using 3 large breast and diced them in 1 in. sizes. I wasn't sure about adding the sesame oil since I'm not a huge fan of it so we omitted that. I get to finally use the five-spice that I've had for a long time and would like to find other recipes using it.
