This is what I call Blender Pear Salad...only I don't like lime jello in it at all. I use raspberry jello 9 times out of 10 although you can use any kind you like.
This is a staple at all get togethers in my family.

This is a great recipe that I've been making for years. The only thing I do differently is save the juice and add water to equal 1 cup and microwave it. I don't blend the pears in with the cream cheese. I cut up the pears and add them into the mold. It gives it more texture and is really very good!!

I love this recipe and make it at le4ast once a week. I love it with strawberry gelatin and also raspberry gelatin. Also tried it with orange gelatin and it tasted like an orangesicle. I like to add a handful or two of marshmallows, which need to be stirred in when the gelatin is getting firm, otherwise they stay at the top. Yum!

I use the fat version but I want to recommend it to everyone who loves a light dessert.  It can be made with other flavors and other fruits and makes a wonderful "take to the cookout party" recipe.  Everyone I have ever brought it to loves it.  Beverly

My mother-in-law was the Jello Queen!  This is my husband's favorite jello that his mom made when he was growing up.  The only changes would be to use the whole 8oz of neufchatel cheese and maybe a Tbsp or so of milk to help the cream cheese whip up better.  Also sometimes I heat up the juice from the can of pears and use instead of water.  Really adds flavor!

I took other reviewer's suggestions and tried this with raspberry jello instead of lime jello. I also poured it into small tupperware containers as to easier portion control. Oh my goodness, is this GOOD! The kids and I absolutely LOVED it.

Made this with raspberry gelatin instead of lime. Everyone enjoyed it. The pears did give it an almost gritty texture, tho. Will try again with peaches.

I made this and it was amazingly delicious and so easy to do. Its the perfect light summer dessert. I used strawberry jello because I didnt have lime and I also used full fat cream cheese (probably a little more like 6 ounces, not 3) and this was so tasty. Mine was set and ready to eat after 2 and a half hours. This is definitely a new favorite for its great taste and easy prep.

I originally received this recipe from my sister-in-law about 30 years ago. I converted it to fat and sugar-free.  This "Green Jello", as my kids refer to it, is requested at all special occassions and holidays.  My grandkids love it also.

I'm giving this 5 stars before I even make this (I'm THAT much a molded salad "expert")...but for Christmas, I'm going to make the recipe in lime, and another in raspberry, and I want to try a red/green layered mold.  I hope to make two molds (one for each family gathering I'm attending).  I'll post photos later in the week!

I loved this and finished it off myself--which was a lot of jello because no one else would eat it.  Go figure.

This was a good jello salad.  Kids enjoyed it and didn't even realize it was low-fat sugar-free ingredients.  I used raspberry jello.  Will save this recipe to make again. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I added a little mint extract for some extra kick.  I think next time I will add a little more;-) but good over all.  Very quick and easy, too.

I was looking for something to replace our traditional lime jello with cottage cheese and pineapple ( new DIL hates cottage cheese).  This was great and loved by all.  I replaced the water with the drained pear juice and used my food processor instead of the blender.  I added a can of drained mandarin oranges to make it a little more substantial.  I think we've found a new tradition.

This is absolutely fantastic, and so easy to make. The longest amount of time it takes is letting it chill, which is a must! Great all around easy dessert, I call that a win.

I love this recipe and always forget how good it is until my mom makes it again.  I came across this on here recently and decided to try it with orange jello - a dreamsicle, indeed!  Can't wait to try more jello flavors!

This was good.  My only problem was that you couldn't taste the pears.  I couldn't even tell they were in there.  Probably won't make again.

My family loves this all time favorite.  It's an old recipe which we always make around the holiday.  So easy to make, but I will warn you - you might have to coax the children to try it... once they do, they will love the taste...

Made the recipe as written--except cut all ingredients in half for the 3 of us.  Then made changing flavors/Fruit.  It is the only way I can get my 97 year old mom to get fruit.  She loves this!

Was a hit at family get-togethers this past summer.  Will make and serve over the upcoming holidays.

In my family, we have affectionately named this "Green Death". I make a double batch each year. It gets gobbled up.

I was given this recipe by my mother in law 40 years ago and it is still one of my favorites.  Great at holidays, light  and tasty.  It's very easy to make.
