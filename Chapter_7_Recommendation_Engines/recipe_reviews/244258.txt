Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using CraisinsÂ® instead of raisins.  I liked the tartness the dried cranberries added to this sweet granola bar.  I hate dry granola bars that crunch and crumble when you bite into them.  I loved the moistness of these bars, but they were a little bit on the soft side, difficult to hold without falling apart. Have to wonder if a little more flour would take care of that??  But they have great flavor, we enjoyed them, and I'd make again!

Very good. I added about 1/3 cups of flax seeds. Also after I took it out of the oven, I put it in the fridge for 1 hour to cool and sort of harden, so that kept them together pretty well. Overall, very yummy and nutritious!

Even though I cut out half the brown sugar, and omitted the corn syrup, I thought these came out too sweet. Also, based on other reviewers, I increased the baking time, hoping to get more firm  bars. Even with baking 20 minutes, they came out a little gooey. I don't think I will make them again. I suggest Granola Bars III from this site instead.

Wonderful recipe, thank you! I made minor modifications based on preference and other reviewers. Omitted corn syrup. Used only 2 tbsp of cane sugar, instead of the brown sugar as written. Omitted corn syrup. Added craisins and shredded coconut. Baked for 25 mins at 350F. Cooled for 20 mins, cut into bars and put them on a rack to continue cooling overnight. The bar held together well and the texture was similar to the oat bar at Starbucks (very chewy!) I like how there was no oil in this recipe.

I really liked these bars!  They kind of taste like a nutritious cookie.  I read the reviews about them being too soft, so I baked them for 25 minutes instead of 15 and they were perfect!  I made them with pecans instead of raisins, but followed the recipe exactly besides that.  Best of all, my daughter loves them!

The taste was good.  I used dried strawberries, blueberries, and cherries but wow, were they soft.  Just a big gooey mess.
