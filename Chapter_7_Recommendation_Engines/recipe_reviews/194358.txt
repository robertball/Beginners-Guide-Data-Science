I have made this cake three times now, all to rave reviews. I would recommend that you use French vanilla pudding versus plain vanilla as it makes a big difference. Also use 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk for a little thicker filling.

I made this for a baby shower recently, and everybody was asking for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out beautifully and is really easy to make!  This is one of my family's new favorite desserts now.

Very tasty, and very easy! The kind of recipe you can make with a 16 month old running around! The filling was delish - got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe. One tip: cut the cake in half with a piece of thread or unflavored dental floss - so much easier than trying to cut it!

This is my husbands favorite so I made it for his birthday. He loved it. I used heavy cream instead of milk just to make sure the cream was thick. Followed all other directions and everyone loved it! Thanks!

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious! Everyone at my poker table was totally impressed -- the whole thing was gone in one sitting.   I used Betty Crocker SuperMoist yellow cake mix, and generics on the pudding and whipped topping (sorry Kraft, it's just what I had at hand!)   Along those lines, since I didn't have the baker's chocolate, I improvised by melting about 1/4 a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips together with 2 Tbsps of margarine (use low heat on the stove, NOT the microwave) and then spreading that on top of the cake. Worked great!

I made this for my sisters birthday and everyone loved it, she said it was the best Boston Cream she has ever had. It was easy to make and travled well (I wrapped the sides with plastic wrap) to her house an hour away. Thanks for sharing, I am sure I will make this again.

Absolutely outstanding!!! The only thing I did differently is bake two 9" rounds instead of hasseling with trying to cut one round into twos. It was unbelievable and anyone can make this recipe!

So delicious! My husband said, "i cannot believe this was made in our kitchen and not in a bakery." I'm planning on making this for a rehearsal dinner. I have no doubt everyone will love it. Thank you!*Update: Everyone raves about this now. I've made it several times and even played around with different puddings and cake mixes. My husband loves it with butterscotch. Thanks again!

This recipe was great!  Bostom Cream Pie is one of my dad's and brother's favorite desserts and they said this was the best they'd ever had.  I made a boxed yellow cake mix and doubled the filling and frosting portion of this recipe to make two pies.

This was really good and easy to make! I used sugar-free pudding mix, skim milk, and light cool whip to cut back on the sugar a bit. Also made the cake with one less egg than called for on the box and applesauce instead of oil. Even with these cutbacks, this was such a great dessert! Even my husband, who "hates" cake managed to eat several helpings.

Super simple.  I didn't have any yellow cake mix on hand, so I used butter cream and it still tasted so great!  Will make many, many more times!

I have always made my Boston Cream Pie from scratch.  I was in a hurry and decided to give this a try.  Everyone LOVED it.  I now make two 9" cakes and double the filling.  It is tall and impressive looking and is gone in a snap.  Will never make one from scratch again.

Soooooooooooo good.  Having made it about 5 times already I found I like Betty Crocker cake mix the best.  I used French vanilla pudding, half milk, half cream.  Yum!

I made this recipe using the suggestions of the French Vanilla Pudding and with whipping cream.   I made mine into filled cupcakes for my husbands work party. I used 1 cake mix and made 24 cupcakes. I used an orange juicer to hole out the cupcakes and then filled with the filling. Then resealed them with the very tops of the holes. Frosted with a fudge frosting. They were a huge hit at my husbands work. I continue to make them for many events. Always a favorite at our house!

This was very good.  I used a cake mix and made two 9 in. round cakes, so this actually makes two cakes if you double the filling.  I also put a tub of chocolated frosting in the microwave for 35 secs. and poured half on the top of each.  It was a very sweet and delicious cake and sure to satisfy.

Easy, delicious, but I'm just not a fan of this flavor of cake.  The kids LOVED it, so my 3 stars is basically just because of my PERSONAL tastes.

I used homemade whipped cream with the pudding! PHENOMENAL!!! the filling should definitely be made with French Vanilla jello instant pudding, flavors are out of this world :) i used a chocolate fudge frosting from duncan hines, much better than a glaze :)

Great recipe. Although I probably didn't need to, I subbed half-and-half for the milk in the pudding mixture. I'll definitely serve this to company.

My granddaughter LOVES Boston Cream Pie so much that she asked for it instead of birthday cake. I used this recipe with a couple of changes. I made two 9" cake layers (added 1 egg to regular boxed yellow cakemix) and made the 3 oz. instant pudding with half whipping cream and half 2% milk. The results were amazing, and everyone gave rave reviews. I will make this again and again. So easy!

So yummy and easy to make. I ended up doubling the icing and using 1.5 of it to cover the cake.  Took the advice of others and used french vanilla pudding and substituted 1/2 C of heavy cream for milk.  Came out perfect.

This cake is AWESOME! i made it as a birthday cake for a friend and everyone loved it! people were hoping there was more but we cut up the cake just right so everyone could have one. The only minor thing i changed is when i bought the yellow cake mix i added two measurements more than the 3/4 cup of vegetable oil.

Used the sweetened whip cream recipe from Taste of Home Test Kitchen instead of Kool Whip.
