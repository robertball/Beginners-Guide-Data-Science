I made alterations to this recipe based on the reviews on all of the Green Tomato Pie Recipes.   My pie was delicious and a big hit with my family.  Even the ones that were only going to 'taste' it and were sure they weren't going to like it.  I proved them wrong.   To prevent some of the 'runny filling' issues, I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the filling mixture. Then I melted some butter in a pan, added the filling and cooked it until it was thick. I let it cool before putting in the pie crust.  For my version, I sliced the tomatoes quite thin, maybe an 1/8 inch.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.  For my next pie, I would use more than 4 cups of sliced tomatoes...just to have more filling in the pie.  The more tomatoes added, also add more sugar.

I've got so many green tomatoes, I figured I might as well try this. The flavor is different, not in a bad way, just undescribable.  The only really bad thing about this pie is the chewy texture.  Still got lots more tomatoes, so I'll maybe try it with the tomatoes shredded, not just sliced.

wow. i was a little skeptical when i first came across this but decided to try it, i took a reviewers advise and thickened the filling before putting it in the pie shell with 3tbsp cornstarch i also added about a cup of canned pie filling i had on hand. it was a amazing i think it didn't even need the extra pie filling. my husband didn't even know it wasn't apple pie. im really impressed with this recipe and will make it again

I made it with green cherry tomatoes, and it came out a little runny.  Next time I might cook down the tomatoes a bit, or add a bit more flour.  But!  It was delicious and very easy to assemble.  I will make it again.

Amazing! I modified as mentioned in the other reviews. 3 tbsp of cornstarch and heat to reduce. Was so so so great and really popular with my whole family including kids!
