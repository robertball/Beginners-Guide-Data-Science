This was prepared as written and I couldn't taste anything but common brussells sprouts.  No improvment at all.

Store bought, prepared brussel sprouts are hit and miss, mostly miss. Tried this recipe and it's now our go to favorite! Definitely looking forward to trying different herb and spice combos.

I only had enough to make half recipe but I trimmed and cut the sprouts in half and I think it helped them to absorb salt better. I then mixed oil wth balsamic vinegar  and a little minced garlic and sprinkled with bacon bits after roasting. The balsamic and pancetta was suggested by one cook. BEST Brussels sprouts I ever had!   Thanks for sharing your ideas!

Followed all instructions. Taste was plain and leaving them in for 35 minutes will burn them.....
