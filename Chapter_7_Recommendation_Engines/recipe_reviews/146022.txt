These are great!! I tried something that may be helpful to other potential makers...I cut the pita bread in half and peeled each side apart, then cut into bite-sized pieces. I put the pieces, the oil, and the spices into a Ziploc freezer bag and just mixed everything up together and spread them out onto a non stick cookie sheet. Never have to spend so much money on store-bought chips again!!  P.S. I also added some parmasan cheese!

Delicious! In fact they're so good, it's hard to eat just one! I added a little Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese to the seasoning mix and WOW they were awesome! You could eat them all by themselves but we dipped them in "Extra Easy Hummus" from this site which took them over the top. My only caution is watch your baking time as they can burn easily. Overall, a definite keeper!

Being that I never made these I decided to follow this recipe, but I was worried about too much salt and I don't like garlic, so I only used the kosher salt.  I used spray instead of brushing olive oil because that is what I had and they turned out perfect and yummy. What a simple healthy snack! I found it very easy to cut the pita with sicsors instead of with a knife or pizza cutter.

I found them way too salty.....my second batch...I just brushed with olive oil and sprinkled a bit of kosher salt and garlic powder and they were much better.

I used whole wheat pita pockets I grabbed off the clearance rack. This did need a little more oil and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, only because I didn't want them too salty. I only had a piece (I'm watching my carbs) but the kids absolutely loved them--we had a "dippable dinner" night with tzatziki sauce and greek meatballs. I'll make them again only I think I'll use fresh garlic next time.

I used to buy the "Naked" pita chips because my Dr told me to cut back on my salt intake, once you start eating that way everything seems to be so salty!!! I wanted to make my own pita chips to go with the home made roasted red pepper hummus....I used just a sprinkle of sea salt and parmesan cheese but no garlic. Yummy! Then I made a sweet treat for hubby and the kids using cinnamon sugar with a slight brush of butter, we use the to scoop vanilla ice cream....talk about happy campers!!! Thanks

These were super easy and can be tweaked to whatever flavor profile you're looking for.  I used a variety of pitas (whole grain, light, whole wheat, etc) and they all turned out well.  My guests really enjoyed these w/home made hummus. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were great! I cut them with a pizza cutter which was a lot faster. Also, be sure to put the leftovers in an air tight container so they remain crispy. My first batch got soggy after about a day when I had placed them a simple ziploc bag.

You can buy spray olive oil which works alot better and is so much quicker.  I used all seasoning and garlic salt on mine.

Pretty good. I only sprinkled sea salt and garlic powder, plus a little bit of paprika on them. I'm glad I only made 3 pita pockets because I couldn't stop eating them!

These are great chips.  A little too thick for us, so here is what I did.... I used the tip of a very sharp knife to poke the pita around the edges.  I then peeled the pita into 2 thin rounds.  I brushed the insides with oil and seasoned with kosher salt (and whatever seasonings you choose).  Then I flipped the rounds over and brushed the outsides.  I was able to get 4 rounds (2 whole pita breads) per cookie sheet.  I baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, turned over and baked for another 7 minutes.  I have insulated cookies sheet, so it always takes longer to bake things.  I will make these again!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These were good and very easy to make.  Next time I think I will eliminate the garlic salt and maybe add some parmesan cheese.  Since I split my pitas through the pocket first (made them thinner)I had to decrease the amount of bake time considerably (to approx 7 mins)and I did have to watch them closely, as they do burn quickly.  Very crispy and delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

OMG ~ these are great, and so simple to make.  I was completely fed up with the store-bought ones...always broken into tiny pieces too small for dipping or anything else.  These are so fresh too...I won't be buying store-bought again.  Followed directions exactly, only omitting the garlic powder since I was already serving with roasted garlic hummus.  Next time will try the garlic powder, Parmesan and/or herbs which I'm sure are wonderful too.  Separated the fronts and backs before brushing both with olive oil, cut into sixths, then put on large baking sheets.  Only took 15 minutes in my oven...would have burned otherwise.  Thanks ~ a real keeper!

Excellent!  I did not use the garlic salt as I am on a low sodium diet.  Otherwise, I followed it as written.  I love this recipe because it has so many other possibilities in terms of spice combinations.  Can't wait to try more!  Thanks Tarryn! :)

These turned out great.  I only used kosher salt, garlic powder and paprika and didn't find the need to add garlic salt as well.  15 minutes was the perfect time for them to be crispy in my oven.

Decided pita was too expensive! Tried this with corn tortillas. You get corn chips for about 50 cents/pound and they don't have MSG on them. Way good!

1st batch I cut up in to 16 pieces (took the pita into to pieces and cut into 8ths) the covered both sides with oil/garlic/Salt (I made a mix)& use a pasty brush. They were good but too oily. Next Batch I cut into smaller bite and only greased 1 side :O) Perfect I love this recipe for $1.00 from the Dollar Store I was able to create a great snack that we can add different spices etc for quick nibbling.

These turned out well.  However, I really don't think, at least for our tatses that the garlic salt was needed.  The kosher salt and garlic powder were plenty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I needed chips for 2 dips I was making and I decided to try these. Why not make my own? Brilliant and oh so easy!  I had made the Smokey Salmon Cat Food from this site along with spinach artichoke dip, strong flavors and I wanted a mild tasting chip. I used whole wheat pitas, Pam and garlic salt. That's it! Cut them into triangles and baked em up in no time. Watch very closely, easily go from perfect to trash in 0.6 seconds. LOL My Supervisor Loved them!  Just right for any kind of dips or even stews/soups/chilli . Thank you Tarryn I will keep these and mind next time I need a chip for my dip!

Very tasty, crispy. I like that I can choose whole wheat or flour pitas and I know exactly what is on my chip. I found I needed more olive oil than called for. I did split the pitas in half to make them go farther and reduced the baking time to 11-12 minutes.

Nice, crisp, salty and delicious.  I made these to go with 'BLT Dip' from AR.  I took them to card club and everyone enjoyed them.  I liked how simple they were to make, and much cheaper than buying a bag of them.  There is a lot less preservatives in a plain package of pita shells than there is a bag of pita chips.  I will be making this recipe again.

When I saw the 1 Tbsp, of garlic powder I thought that it would be way to much, but as I always make the recipe exactly as it says the first time to give it a proper review I went with it. They were pretty good. Not too much garlic powder at all.

A bit salty but still really good. I cut the pita into 6 triangle pieces and then pulled them apart to make thin chips. Watch them carefully in the oven so they don't burn!

These were very good! I just sprayed them with cooking spray (to make them healthier) and only used the garlic powder and cracked sea salt. These went great with our hummus...YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These turned out great the only reason not 5 stars is because I left out the garlic salt origionally specified and they were still soooo salty. Second time I cut salt in half and LIGHTLY covered in the garlic powder and they were perfect. We use the whole grain flax pita its soo good and we have played with seasonings and they always come out great but we like them plain the best. Great with spin dip or hummus drizzled w/evoo

I made these just as the recipe said, and they were fantastic. Next time I think I may try what another review said, tossing everything in a large ziploc bag, as I think that would be easier, and I'll add some parmesan cheese as well.

These were perfect and easy to make! I had some pita pockets to use up a few weeks ago that my husband was tired of consuming on his own as I can't have them. The only change I made was omitting the garlic salt as I didn't have any on hand. He enjoyed the chips with Baba Ghanoush and hummus I wanted to use up and said much better than store bought pita chips. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I are trying to go "low cholesterol" and I made these for a snack. Overbaked my first sheet, but the second was just right. Salt, garlic powder, pepper and a little olive oil spray to make them stick!

Delicious! I added 1 tablespoon  of parmesan cheese, so no extra salt was needed. It will be fun to play with different flavors in the future. Great, easy recipe.

Instead of brushing the oil and seasonings on, I put them in a zip bag and just poured it over them, shook the bag and the proceeded with the rest of the recipe.

I wasn't sure about adding garlic salt after already putting in garlic powder and kosher salt so I substituted Italian seasoning.  Gave them a nice flavor.

Yummy pita chips! I brushed half with regular olive oil, and for the other half, I used garlic-infused olive oil, and those were especially delicious! I don't use garlic salt --- just  sea salt and garlic powder, not measuring, just sprinkling lightly. I took these out at 12 min because they were turning quite  brown (maybe due the multi-grain?). You really have to keep an eye on these. They make a very healthy snack or to go  with hummus or taboule salad. Thanks for the recipe!

3.12.18  Just one recommendation...watch your time.  Recipe says to bake 15-20 minutes, I checked at 12, and they were completely overdone, some burnt which I had to throw away.  I did add some Italian seasoning and sprinkle of hatch chili pepper seasoning, and the flavor was good, but putting it mildly, they were more than “crunchy.”  I had no other pitas left, but I will try this recipe again and check for doneness at 9 minutes.

Excellent recipe just the way it is written. I used the basic recipes, then Parmesan, then Italian seasoned. All turned out perfectly. I baked them for the initial 10 minutes, going the full 15 for the basic, a total of 13for the Parmesan and the full 15 for the Italian seasoned.

These  were super yummy!  I accidentally bought Greek flat bread instead of pita bread but it still worked.  I cut them into 1/8 pieces,  then brushed each piece with olive oil and sprinkled with kosher salt and garlic powder.  I baked at 335 degrees until lightly browned, then turned them over, brushed the other side with olive oil and baked until well toasted.  Served with spinach dip!

These are sooo easy and tasty!  So far I've made them with Moroccan seasoning,  and  garlic+Italian herbs.  I used whole wheat pita bread and cut them using kitchen shears.  Both are absolutely delicious with hummus or Greek yogurt dip.  I plan on trying them with cumin and chili powder to go with bean dip next.  Also, barbecue seasoning would be awesome!  The possibilities are endless!  Thanks!

I chose to put less spices (the salts and that) and it was amazingly good! I recommend it to people like me who enjoys pita bread with hummus. It adds a twist to the original pita/hummus combo.

I made these without the garlic salt because we didn't have any. Everyone is saying that with the garlic salt it was too salty. So, I lucked out not having it. Thanks, I loved your recipe!

This paired nicely with my homemade tatziki. I took the suggestions of some others and split the pita to make it thinner,I got 6 triangles from every half . I didn't find it too salty, but that's maybe perhaps I enjoy salt. Used whole wheat pitas! Such a great different idea to entertain with.

These are wonderful. I used the whole wheat pita bread recipe from allrecipes. From a whole pita, I cut it in half, then cut the two sides apart, so that each pita made for half-circles. Brushed with the oil, sprinkled with salt, cut each piece into four pieces  and baked as directed. Another review said they were tough and chewy the next day, so at the 15 minute mark I turned off the oven and just left them in there until the oven cooled down.  They were SO Crunchy!! I let them cool completely, then put them in a ziploc. Five hours later they are still totally crisp, so I think the trick is to let them dry out in the oven. Thank you for a wonderful recipe, can't wait to try it with all kinds of different toppings; sweet and savory.

I have made these twice and each time, I received a ton of compliments. Everyone wanted to know how I made them and where I got the recipe. I served them with tzatziki, hummus and fresh vegetables (cucumber slices and halved cherry tomatoes).  I will be making these for a long time to come.

Such a great idea and lets me limit the number of ingredients (i.e., I get pita bread that's just whole wheat bread) and amount of oil or salt in the pita chips.  Brilliant!

To make this really healthy and guilt free I used whole wheat pitas. I don't use any oil. Simply separate the pockets and cut into whatever size chips you like. Sometimes I sprinkle with a  little dill weed. Bake for just a few minutes until they are crisp but not brown. Watch carefully and test as they bake to achieve that perfect chip crunch. They keep great in sealed containers. This is then a five star chip!

I see a few reviews that mention cutting back on salt and resorting to making their own chips. I am in that same boat and I love this recipe for that. Soooo simple and so versatile. Thanks for posting this!

Good, easy and perfect with my cream cheese/pesto spread.  I baked them for about 8-10 minutes.

My picky brother ate these without realizing I had made them.  He said he preferred this "brand" better.  So easy to make.

Wonderful but if you are serving them with a salty spead or dip just spray them with oil and bake.  I made tapenade (this site) and it was too much salt. Anchovies and olives had more than enough. Five stars for sure.

Excellent tasting and so easy to make. Don't forget to cut them before you put them in the oven. It's a pain afterward!

These are very good.  Nice and crunchy.  I also would cut the salt back as they are too salty.  Put everything in a ziploc bag to mix.  I added parm cheese as well and they turned out great!!

I only used the garlic powder. NO salt at all. I served along with Crab Dip. Yummy!

Very good! Since others said it was too salty, I reduced the salt by half. Next time I'll leave it out altogether, and it will be just right.
