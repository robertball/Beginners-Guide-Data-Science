YUMMY! I made this for two Holiday get togethers last year (2001) and just spent the last 20 min. finding it here because I was ask to make it again this year!  I kept it warm by setting it on a warming table.

I made this for Christmas this year and it was great!!  I added 1/2 a cup of shredded cheddar and 1/2 cup mozzarella AND in half the batch, I added 2 teaspoons of horseradish - for that little extra zing!  I'd make this again in an instant.  My family all raved about it.

I've had better (see: Warm Crab Parmasean Dip). . . And for some reason I can't really enjoy a dip/spread of seafood proportions without including such preferrences as Worcestershire, lemon, tobasco, extra garlic, and some pepper. . . Just a few things that no seafood dish should be without in my eyes. . .

I made the dip without the wine and used OldBay instead of the salt. It turned out great. Nice and creamy. It could have used some onions or horseraddish to give it a little more kick.

No one was interested in this after the first bite.  This was not cheap to make either.  It had absolutley NO crab taste, despite using 2 cans of good quality crab meat.  Will delete this immediatley from my recipe box.

I made this one according to the recipe, it was bland and tasted just like MAYO in a bowl.  Then, I doctored it with additional spices and cheeses, a little at a time. Eventually, it was edible, but that is the best I can say for this dip.  Will not make again.

This was good.  I think next time I will add some minced onion to it though, it just seemed to be lacking something.

Good, but a little lacking on flavor with all that cream cheese...

Been making this for several years.  It doesn't even have time to cool down before it is gone!
