Omelettes are a great Sunday morning breakfast - however, I must agree that the amount of oil called for is a bit much. I have a non-stick pan so I opted for just a little butter to fry the onions and potatoes adding a little minced garlic and salt to the mix.  I then added the ham and tomatoes and poured the egg mixture over top. I served it spinkled with light Cheddar cheese and sliced green onion along with whole grain toast and a glass of OJ!

As written, I think it calls for too much oil.  Starting with as little oil as possible (in a non-stick pan), cook the potatoes, onions, green onions and garlic until the potatoes are almost tender.  Add the ham and saute until it's heated through and the potatoes are done.  Continue with the recipe and when adding the vegetables to the eggs, sprinkle the tomatoes along with the cheddar cheese and complete as written.  This should cut the fat and calories considerably while keeping the tomatoes intact.

The proportions of this recipe are off.  As mentioned by other reviewers, 1/4 cup of oil is way too much.  I approached this by using one large potato diced and cooked it in a cast iron pan with just a bit of oil (maybe 1+ Tablespoons) when the potatoes were tender I added the onion and cooked until the potatoes were starting to crisp then added just one clove of minced garlic.  1 cup of diced ham is a lot for one 3 egg omelette - I reduced that to about 1/4 cup.  We  don't care for cooked tomatoes so I added those to the filling of the omelette.  I had extra potatoes that wouldn't easily fit into the omelette so I served those on the side.
