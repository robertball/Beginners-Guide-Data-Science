I subbed cauliflower for the broccoli. I guess I like "crunch" in a salad, so next time I might add some chopped onion.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the recipe in half because it looked like it made way too many servings for me. Followed the directions exactly, all good. I saw that one reviewer said it was bland, so I added 1/2 tsp of smoked salt. That did the trick. Itâ€™s perfectly neutral, but delicious & filling. I would make this as a side for any meat or fish, and would even be a great meatless lunch option.

This was so terribly bland, and it made so much.  I kept trying to add different things to it later while forcing down the left overs.  I did find that chopped avocado did make it much better.  I will not be making it again.

It tastes great! I substituted the chili pepper cayenne powder with garlic powder though.

I love this salad. I added multi-colored cauliflower. I ended up quadrupling the chili powder and cayenne just because we like things spicy, but as is, this salad is addictive. It makes a lot, so be ready for leftovers or adjust the amount. Thank you for sharing.
