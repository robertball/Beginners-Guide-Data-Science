Ok people, I see some of my reviews are complaining about my queso not being spicy enough or too thin.  My family is a bunch of wussies so I had to tone this way down, for myself and my friends I will actually add chopped jalapeno's and/or hot salsa.  Also, if its too thin you can add a bit more cheese since I estimated the amounts.  Also, make sure its not too hot because that will make it runny (will thicken as it cools a bit) and I usually keep it in slow cooker to keep it warm and to keep it from hardening.  I almost never follow this recipe to the "T" and I'm always playing around with it, so I encourage you to do the same.  Enjoy! ~Jeff

This is the best Chili Con Queso I've ever had, plus it was SUPER easy to make. 

Following the advice from some other reviews I used Velveeta Mexican cheese.

I used Tillamook's Medium cheese, I feel that Tillamooks has a much smoother texture that store brand cheeses.

I also used about 10 ounces of salsa, instead of only 7.

Let's see, I used the whole can of chili, put about 2 teaspoons of chili powder and 3 dashes of Trappy's Louisiana Hot Sauce.

It turned out wonderfully and had a bit of a kick from the extra salsa, chili powder, and hot sauce. 

I highly recommend this recipe, Jeffo here really knows his stuff.

Great recipe!  It tastes exactly like many of the con queso recipes served at popular Mexican restaurants.  For my cheese, I used a 16oz portion of Velveeta Mexican cheese.  It turned out perfectly.  Thanks~

This recipe was a BIG HIT!!! There was not a drop left!!! I followed it as written and it was great. I was concerned at the beginning because the cheeses didn't seem to melt well. I  used slices of American and cubed mild cheddar. However, I finally decided to add the other ingredients and it blended very well and tasted awesome. Thanks, Jeff, for a wonderful recipe!!!

This was good, but next time I will put 1/2 cup of sour cream and a little more velveta. Tastes just like chili cheese and would be great with fries or on top of hot dogs. It tastes better the longer the flavors warm together. I had it in a crock pot and everyone thought it was better an hour later.

Thanks Jeff!  This is a snack that can eat like a meal.  You need a good hearty tortilla chip, and I used Tostidos new Gold chips.  I spooned the sauce over the chips and topped with jalepeno slices.  A keeper!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  It had no kick to it.I even used Velveeta Mexican cheese, added a second can of Mormel chili and tobasco sauce.  Too runny too.  Not a keeper for me.

Love this one.  It is always a top request at parties.  I use Mexican Velveeta rather than American Cheese.  Very close to Chili's queso!

This is a great Queso. I made this for the SuperBowl and we really enjoyed. The next day I used the remaining sauce to make Chicken Enchiladas and they were awesome. Thanks, Jeff.

I love this queso. I am a vegetarian so I did leave the meat out. I also made in the microwave which gave perfect results. The sour cream really keeps the cheese from being overwhelming and gives it just a little tartness. Thanks for the recipe!

I used half the amount of processed cheese AND sour cream and I used a full can of chili. The boys loved it. They seriously inhaled it.

Loved it and it will now be a new staple at parties for me! I didn't melt the cheese in a saucepan before adding it to the crockpot. Just did it all together and turned out great!

This queso recipe is just ok. I was hoping for something like Chili's Queso, but this one didn't really have much flavor or spice to it at all. I won't be making this again.

My first time making queso! It was easier than I thought... I omitted the chili (personal preferance), added a handful of mexican blend cheeses and about 1/4 cup hot sauce. The hot sauce really added flavor and wasn't too spicy at all! I had to turn up the heat and stir often to avoid sticking to the pan but turned out great. Was a bit hit for an appetizer at a mini dinner party last night. Thank you Jeff :)

My husband and I love Chili Con Queso! This was a super easy recipe and it turned out great for being so quick. After making this recipe with canned chili I realized I prefer hommade. It makes all the difference. Still this recipie is great in a pinch! Thanks

Did I miss something?  Should "velveeta" be used instead of American cheese?  They are two different cheeses. American and cheddar make a grainy consistency.  In fact despite the low temperature and constant stirring, the sauce broke.  Don't know that I'd make it again with processed cheese food, but that must be the difference.

Instead of the cheese listed, use a pkg of queso velveeta, and 2 cans of chili (I use one hot and one regular chili), then use packet of taco seasoning (or bill echol's taco seasoning recipe from this site). Can of rotel with chilis and like 1/3 c sour cream is all else u need! (can make this hotter by adding hotter spices)

I altered this to make it pretty spicy. Instead of regular sour cream I used the Santa Fe blend cooking cream, also used the medium spice chili starter and added some rotel. Velveeta spicy cheese and added a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce too. Served with artisan fire roasted chipotle chips.  

My boyfriend and I both love it. Great football watching treat!

I followed the recipe as written, except that I added some hot italian sausage to it to make it a bit heartier.  To add sausage, remove the casing from one italian sausage and brown the meat while breaking it up into chunks.  Then add the meat to the rest of the mixture.  I also added a few chopped jalepeno slices to spice it up.

OK, this is the first time that I made this recipe. It is still in the crock pot as I write this. I will be taking it to my sister's dinner party this evening. I made some major changes to it. I used 2% Velveeta instead of the American/Cheddar. I used Wolf Brand Turkey chili, Joe T. Garcia's mild salsa, and Lite Sour Cream. I doubled the recipe. I just dipped a few chips and have to say that I love the flavor of this queso. It is a tiny bit runny, and I may put some more cheese in it to thicken it, but the lite version that I made is really, really good and I expect that it will be hit this evening. I'm not going to tell anyone that it's a lite version of queso until I know that they all like it, but I think they'll be surprised when they find out.... and pleased!

I give this a 3 1/2 *.....I love queso and I was a bit disappointed with this one.  I was expecting a nice smooth cheesey queso and this was not it.  This was alomst a little grainy to me.  It was really rich with the sour cream in it.  I would prefer a cheesey queso.

This is quite good.  I really wanted something that had the texture of a velveta based queso dip, but the flavor of cheddar.  I did spice it up a bit to fit my tasted.

Okay, so I made this queso for a football party this evening and it was a hit, people wouldn't shut up about it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it's not the best queso I've ever had (but then again, I wasn't expecting that it would be), but  it was TASTY!!!!!  Instead of using 7 ounces of chunky salsa, I used 4 oz of salsa verde by Herdez and then 4 ounces of chunky salsa; I think that added great heat to it.

I love this recipe its absolutely awesome, I just had a question, I'm the only person in my home that eats this, I was wondering if I could store the left overs in a jar or something. I don't want to ruin the taste of it though.

I like the flavor, but the grittiness kills it for me.  I'm thinking it's the cheddar maybe?  I might try with just american next time... I also think it's too runny due to the amount of salsa and sour cream, so I'd maybe take that ratio down.

Pretty good stuff! Used the whole can of chili- was out of salsa, so pulsed a can of Rotel & measured out a cup. I also added some water as it was thicker than I like queso to be.

We were definitely underwhelmed.  The cheese was gritty and rather tasteless even though we used mexican velveeta and added onion, garlic and cumin for flavor.  We won't be making this again...thanks anyway.

I used cream cheese instead of American cheese and I used the whole can of chili. YUM! I also made it in my crock pot. It's impossible to eat just one bite. I'm going to make this for every party I ever have!

I made this dip for a party yesterday.  After reading other people's comments about it not being spicy enough I substituted chipotle jack cheese for the mild cheddar and also used medium salsa instead of mild.  Overall the dip came out well, I kept hearing from people how addictive it was.  My only complaint was that 8 ounces of sour cream made it WAY too thin.  I'm sure I'll make this again but I will definitely cut the sour cream in half because when the dip is too thin all the chunks sink to the bottom.

I heavily edited this recipe based on other reviewers' suggestions, but it was a really helpful base to start from. I used a jar of plain queso from the store (15oz), about 1/4 c cubed colby cheese, and I substituted a can of tomatoes with chiles for the salsa. I also added chopped jalapenos, and a couple dashes more of Tabasco. I use the entire can of chili as well. I just put all the ingredients in a bowl and stuck it in the microwave. It turned out really great though, and I'll use this recipe every time in the future.

Excellent dip - I think the mini-crock pot was even licked clean.  I used 16 oz. Velveeta Mexican, as another reviewer suggested, a can of Rotel, turkey chili w/beans, and used shredded cheddar instead of cubed.  Absolutely wonderful, will definitely make again.

good flavors...I spiced it up a little more than the recipe called for, but I would suggest using just velveeta. I really didn't think the cheddar melted too smoothly. It was just a strange texture for me.

Tasty, but something about the texture with the mixture of the two cheeses was odd.  I prefer a cheese blend with a smoother consistency and would use cream cheese next time.

This Con Queso has an excellent flavor and is definitely a recipe that I will make again and again.  I did make a few modifications.  I don't know that the were necessarily needed but it's still yummy with them.   I used the whole can of chili.  I used 1 Tbs of chili powder.  I also chopped up 10-15 pickled jalapenos and added to this sauce plus about 1/4 cup of the jalapeno juice.  I added 4 oz of canned chilies.  I had also just minced some fresh garlic for another recipe and had about one clove left over so I just threw it in too.    I like spicy so I would probably spice it up a little more for just me, but I'm taking it to a family dinner tomorrow and can't get carried away.  A+ in my opinion.  These ingredients together create a very tasty dip!

I serve as "make your own nachos." Dip is in a crockpot; place corn chips, jalapenos and stirofoam bowls on the side and everyone makes their own nachos. Everyone loves doing this and they consume all of it.

WOW ~ Super Chili Con Queso ~ I followed the directions to a "T" and it turned out perfect.  I made this for an appetizer for Christmas Eve ~ I usually do the Velveeta/Rotel recipe, but this one surpasses it by far.  There were a lot of yummy appetisers on the table, but my hubby said this one was the best.  A KEEPER ~

This recipe is amazing!  I've made it twice now and everyone gathered around it until it was gone...after reading the other reviews, I made the following changes to the recipe which worked very well: Instead of using different cheeses, I just used a 16oz container of Velveeta, an entire 16 oz jar of medium chunky salsa, and about 10 dashes of Tabasco sauce.  Deliscious!

Great adaptable chili con queso recipe.  With little kids I actually made two different batches.  One bowl I used the velveeta MX mix and just threw everything in it to melt.  The second pot I used a Hot Salsa and added jalapenos.  My kids were happy and so were me and my hubby.  5 stars!!!

This came out fine, but I learned my family prefers Queso without chili.  This had a strong chili flavor and they wanted the cheese dip associated with restaurants.

It tastes very similar to a recipe that has been in our family for years, but our recipe is a lot easier to make. Ours calls for 1 lb of Velveeta Mild Mexican, cut up in cubes, one can of chili w/ no beans, and a can of diced green chilis (optional). Put all ingredients in a microwave safe dish and microwave in 2 minute intervals, stopping to stir, until melted. Total microwave time is usually 5 minutes. Enjoy!

Very good.  I added the whole can of chili (I mean...c'mon....what are you going to do with the remaining 1/4 can??!!), 2 tbsp. chopped sliced pickled jalapenos and one small can sliced black olives.  Also, for the American cheese, I used Velveeta.  

Took it to a poker game last night and the guys flipped over it.

Jeff, this stuff is great!  I can actually feel my arteries constricting as it goes down.  My only suggestion is to dice up some jalapenos, as you suggested, and substitute the mild salsa with some habanero salsa.  Five Stars!

Excellent. I followed your recipe exactly. Comparible to Chilli's Skillet Queso. I will probably try medium salsa next time for a little more spice. Overall it was very good!!! Thanks

I make this for every party and it is always one of the first things to disappear!  Everyone loves it and I always get a ton of compliments.  I use turkey chili and medium salsa but those are the only changes.  Thanks Jeff!

Good tasting dip. No problem with it at all. Only thing different I did with it was chop up a few jalapenos without seeds to give it a little more chunky texture. Anyone complaining about this one either has no taste, is jealous or too lazy to spice it up themselves.

I brought this to a SuperBowl party, and it was a huge hit! The only change I made was adding a second can of chili, to make it more hearty. Will make it again.

Huge hit, I doubled the cheese and salsa increased the chili and sour cream. I also added hot Italian sausage, used hot salsa, jalapeno cheese, jalapenos and hot sauce.  So about 4 pounds of cheese, 2 pounds of hot Italian sausage and Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. 20 people and not a drop left, thanks Jeff you gave me a great base to start with and they LOVED IT.

I used the white velveeta and used less  salsa to keep it from being too runny. I added a fresh chopped jalapeño as well for a little more kick. Everyone enjoyed the dip, even the kiddos. I'll definitely make it again!

The recipe was easy to follow and the dip tasted good. I used all organic/local ingredients so that spiked the overall cost to make. Next time I'll add jalapeno or look for a spicier recipe.

I was hesitant to try this recipe because the idea of canned chili makes my stomach turn. (Just look at my reviews or saved recipes...I make a lot of chili). But...sometimes, in the interest of time, we take shortcuts. I bought a can of Wolf-brand, no-beans, basic chili. Followed the recipe  (sans the hot sauce) and kept this bad boy warm in a fondue thingy to serve with fajitas and tortilla chips, and man...was it a hit. We had a small group of  3 adults and 3 kids and there was hardly any left.  It's easy, cheesy, and crowd-pleasing. Thanks Jeff!

This was delicious! I substituted all the cheese for 16 oz of velveeta, used about 8 shakes of Tabasco and a few ounces extra of medium salsa. Like everyone else says it is not too spicy and I even used medium salsa. My family does like like spicy and they loved it. To heat it up I diced up fresh jalapeño and covered with them. Excellent dish!

I made this but took the advice of other reviewers and substituted the Mexican variety processed cheese instead of the regular kind and I only ever buy medium salsa so that is what I used.  I also added the whole can of chili as I just didn't see the point of throwing that little bit away.  While cooking I had to keep stirring because the regular block cheddar cheese didn't want to melt as easily.  Overall the dip went over okay but I thought the dip had a strange texture because of the mixture of cheeses.  I also find that recipes that use processed cheese taste mostly like processed cheese and nothing else, but that was expected.

Jeff's recipe is spot on but I change this up for NM fire eaters (what I learned living in the SW). I do not add the canned chili, and instead I add a couple Tbsp.chopped green chile. I add a bit of milk if too thick. I agree with other reviewers, Velveeta works best.

Thank you for the great recipie to point me in the right direction.  The only things I did different was that I used 16oz of velveta instead of 8 and I used a full can of skyline chili.  It was good.

Instead of so much cheese, i would recommend more chili. To spice it up more, I used pepper jack cheese, red pepper flakes (instead of hot sauce),  full can (15 oz) of jalapeño chili, medium salsa. I used half the sour cream.  For the cheese, I used organic sharp white cheddar and Tillamook pepper jack.

Perfect!!  I used less cheese due to personal preference only, I like dip that is not real thick. Took some to my neighbors, they texted me before I even got back across the yard asking for the recipe.

We made this for our superbowl party today. OUTSTANDING. Didn't change a single thing. Nothing left. Going to make this again for a dinner party this week for friends. Loved it. Logged on just to write this review! Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe. On a spicy scale for those wondering 0-5 its a 0. If you want spicy add some jalapeno's. Happy Dipping!

This chili con queso dip of Jeff's is the best con queso dip I have ever had. Even better than some of the restaurants I have been to. I have made this recipe 3 times now and every single time I make it, the bowl ends up getting emptied. I have even doubled the recipe and still all has been eaten. What I like best about this recipe is that you can tweak it different ways. I try and strain the salsa a little so it doesn't end up watering the dip down too much and add in a couple extra dashes of cholula to give a little more zing. The dip is never too spicy and has that great Velveeta taste with the American and mild cheddar to compliment. I'm making again for Super Bowl. All my friends keep asking me if I am making it and no better time to have it that Super Bowl. I think I better triple the recipe this time so there is enough to go around. This recipe also goes great on Carne Asada. Thanks for the recipe Jeff.

instead of the two-cheese-blend, I used Velveeta like some other users. I also used homemade chili instead of canned, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. We loved it! In the future, we'd add more hot sauce.

It's always gone at the end of the night.  I added Sriracha (hot  sauce) to make it a bit spicier and instead of canned chili, I added hot pork sausage.  The cheeses melted well together though, and that's always a trick, so I was very pleased.

This was a tasty very basic chili con queso.  I used velveeta mexican, velveeta pepperjack, and white cheddar.  The cheese didn't melt well in a saucepan, I think it would do better on low in the crockpot.  I'd like to try it with sausage next time in place of the chili.

Have been making this for 40 years with chili with beans which gives great texture. Usually add a little garlic powder and hot sauce. Always asked to bring to gatherings. Just used a chafing dish with candle after blending all ingredients in double boiler...pre crockpots!

Oh my, oh my, this is outstanding queso!  It was devoured by my guests and all raved about how good it was.  I took other reviewers advice and used the mexican velveeta and also the whole can of no bean chili.  Delish!

It was pretty good.  Other comments have said restaurant style....I'm not sure about that.  It was a nice change from our usual velveeta, rotel, and sausage.  I added a can of chilis to spice it up a bit.  And I really liked the sour cream.

This dip is awesome! I used 2% American cheese slices, 2% Sharp Cheddar, shredded and Turkey Chili to lower the fat and calories.  It still tasted like it came from a restaurant! Not too spicy, which was perfect for my 8 yr and 4 yr old kids.  It still had great flavor. We will definitely be making this one again!!

Super good! A little processed for my tastes but our guests have all LOVED it. I'll make a 4 qt crockpot full for a large party and it's always the first thing to be gobbled up. It's very versatile as far as spice is concerned. You can add jalapenos or spicier salsa. I also use the full can of chili.

Jeff, you are my hero.

Every year when football season rolls around, my husband and I say things like, "I need some Jeff's."

Sometimes, I add cream cheese, too.

This was good. Instead of chili, I added chorizo. For some reason, mine turned out a little gritty though. It may have been the chorizo.

This was such a hit at our Cinco de Mayo party.  I made a double batch and put it in a crock pot on the table to keep it warm.  People stood around the table and ate the whole thing!  I couldn't believe it!  So much better than a jar of queso with some chili!!!

This was really good. Made it Christmas eve for the family and everyone loved it. This will be replacing my regular Rotel Queso I have made for years! I was a litle worried because at first because as all the cheese is melting it does not look very appealing (I cooked it in the slow cooker) but the end result was great!!

I have been wanting to make Chili con Queso for a long time and this looked like a good recipe. It really was easy and delicious. My guests LOVED it.
I went ahead and added the whole can of chili (why waste that little leftover?)and only added 1/3 of the sour cream.....It was great! Thx for this recipe(I also sent the recipe home with my guest).

I made this in a slow cooker and it turned out great!  Not too spicy but not bland either, and the addition of real cheese with the Velveeta made it even better.

AWESOME! Made it one weekend for a birthday party. It was such a huge hit that I made it again the next weekend for another party but had to double the recipe.

Very good! I would omit the chili...only because I don't care for it too much. My husband likes chili so he loved this dip. Even though I don't care for chili that much it was still good! I bet it would be good with homemade chili instead of canned chili.

Made this for Superbowl Sunday and everyone loved it! I thought the cheddar would make it greasy but it just added some really good flavor. Much better than just processed cheese food. Really good!

This was excellent!  I omitted the hot sauce and added medium chunky salsa.  It came out perfect, and even the picky kids loved it.  Also, I cooked it in the crock pot to save time.

This was my first try at fondue since I got a fondue set for Christmas.  I took it to our family's New Year's party and it was gone before anything else.  I used American cheese singles since that's what I had on hand.  I also left out the chili powder and pepper sauce since I have young ones and it still was awesome.  Thanks for sharing this one Jeff.  Will definitely make again and next time I'll make 2 batches.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Very easy to make and it tastes just like the restaurant version.
