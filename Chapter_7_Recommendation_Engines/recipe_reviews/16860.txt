MMM MMM GOOD!
STRATEGY:
Use a rubber spatula to stir the ingredients.  Then, using the spatula, cut into the dough and form into small-medium balls.

VARIATIONS:   
Pillsbury Moist Supreme Strawberry cake mix plus a tablespoon of berry jam.  -SO TASTY!!!  I made them for a party and they were loved by all (a younger favorite).

Betty Crocker's Carrot Cake mix plus one cup of rolled oats...   EVEN BETTER!!!  It makes a ginger cookie look-alike that has a lovely spice taste and is very very good (an older favorite).  Next time I will also add raisins for a sweet touch.

I baked the cookies 12-14 minutes and made 44 medium, perfectly round cookies (for BOTH variations)

The only area where I would rate this recipe high is in the quickness of preparation. Other than that, nothing remarkable. The batter comes out immensely greasy and the vanilla flavoring of the cake mix is rather overpowering. Won't make it again.

I've been making these for years to rave reviews but have never tried adding baking powder.  This worked well!  I found that 1/3 cup oil as suggested by others, wasn't enough to stir the dough.  I used chocolate cake mix (ALWAYS Duncan Hines) and added chocolate chips.  I split the dough, added nuts to half and sprinkled those with nuts with powdered sugar after baking, so people could tell the difference.  All were yummy.  This is a great last minute recipe and people never guess it's made of cake mix.

These are the best easy cookies you'll ever make!  Keep some cake mixes and mix-ins on hand and you'll always be prepared.  They take no time to make and bake.  It's also fun to try different combinations.  We liked spice cake mix and raisins the best...they taste like the best oatmeal-raisin cookies you've ever had, minus the grittiness of the oatmeal.  We also like golden cake mix with cinnamon chips.  Chocolate cake mix with coconut wasn't that great - it would probably be better if the coconut was sprinkled on top (we mixed it in).  For the kids, I've used vanilla mix with m&ms and they loved it!  You really don't need too much of the mix-ins...if you put in too much, the dough breaks apart a little.  Try these...you'll love them!

Great cookies! I used duncan hines devils food cake mix and added milk choc. chips and walnuts. They were so moist and good. I can't wait to try them with peanut butter chips. As far as the ingredients go , I feel they are perfectly accurate. Especially if you use duncan hines brand. I do not know how the yellow cake mix will turn out, but I'm not worried. Although these cookies are a close second to my favorite choc. peanut butter cup cookies on this site, I will probably make these more because they're faster, easier and just as good. But we all know there's nothing like the goodness baking from scratch.

Very moist, chewy, soft cookie and stays fresh for days in an airtight container.  Use 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) in place of the oil for a richer, more homemade taste.  I'ave also made Cranberry White Chocolate Oatmeal cookies using this as the base.  (1 cup each of cranberry, white chocolate and 2/3 cups rolled oats)But for choclate chip cookies, I always add 1 cup chopped walnuts for more flavor/texture and always get great reviews no matter what combo I use.  Great to make with kids since there's not too many ingredients.  Also try Devil's Food cake mix & walnuts- it's sublime.  Definitely an 8 MINUTE cookie if you want it moist & chewy.  It will look a little underdone coming out, but will set wonderfully. Awesome, quick cookie and if you don't tell, people can't tell it's not from scratch. (Just a review from a life-time baker - hey,  sometimes we cheat too!)

A quick and wonderful recipe for those who need options in their dessert.  My husband is allergic to chocolate and sugar cookies get old.  I halfed the batter put chocolate chips in one half for my kids and put oatmeal, walnuts and cinnamon in the other half for my husband.  Turned out great.  My only modification was a tablespoon of water to the oat mixture to help with the stiffness.  A winner in my house!

After reading all the rave reviews, I was excited to try these cookies.  They were very easy to make, and my kids enjoyed making them with me, but they just didn't taste all that great.  They tasted more like packaged cake mix than does a cake made from packaged cake mix!  I won't make these again -- I prefer Toll House, or the Award Winning Chocolate Chip Cookies on this site that use the pudding mix.  Now those are some COOKIES!

This is THE recipe if you're in a hurry and want cookies now!  I've made them 5x in the past 2 weeks.  They do taste like cake mix, though, I have to say.  But if those you're making them for are nondiscriminating in their tastes,  you've got a hit.  Tried it with choc chips & p'nut butter chips.  Yum!!

I have made these cookies several times and thought I'd share my tips with you:
1) Don't use a stand mixer to mix, it will overbeat the dough and the oil separates, making the texture not that great; 2) When using harder add-ins like toffee chips, it has a tendency to break up the dough, so use less than 1 cup; 3) The combination that goes over the best with a crowd (in my experience) is Devil's Food with milk choc chips, and 4) If using Pampered Chef, bake the full 10 minutes.  These cookies definitely aren't gourmet but they whip up fast.  Finally, don't taste one until they are completely cooled, not a cookie you want to eat warm.  Hope these help!

I omited the oil and added a stick of butter.  The cookies were not greasy at all.  I also added Ande's mint chips and they turned out great. I cooked them for 10 minutes and they still looked a little undercooked but I took them out anyway.  They turned into a nice soft, chewy cookie.

This recipe was very good and most importantly very easy!  My husband loves M&M cookies so I used mini M&M's for my mix-in. I used Duncan Hines Supermoist Yellow cake mix as another reviewer suggested and 1/3 cup of oil like other suggestions.  They turned out great although I needed to bake them longer than 10 minutes; it was about 13 minutes.  Great recipe!

These are delicious and sooooo simple. I did a yellow sugar-free cake mix with chocolate chips. A friend of mine used to make "ying-yang" cookies-half white and half chocolate- and they were so so yummy!

As others have said, this recipe is very easy to make. For those worried about the cake-like taste of the cookie can add a little bit of extra flour. Well I looked at different recipes for cookies and cakes, I noticed that the cookies always had a significantly greater amount of flour in comparison to the other items. With the extra flour, the cookies definitely tasted more like cookies. My brother, who usually NEVER eats anything I bake, finished an entire cookie sheet of the cookies.

These cookies are wonderful.  My son devoured three and wanted more.  A friend stopped by and had five.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding one teaspoon salt.  I used the yellow cake mix, added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to half the batch, and topped the remainder with sprinkles (similar to sugar cookies).  Very, very good cookies that look great out of the oven.

Great cookies = power!  My roommates have begged for these cookies numerous times and enjoyed them thoroughly.  The recipe calls for too much oil, and the cookies themselves are a bit dry.  I will try tweaking the amounts next time for better results.

These cookies rated 5 stars in all categories. Sooo easy and sooo good. Kids loved them. Added mini m&ms to add color . Rolled the dough into balls and pressed down lightly. Found the 8-10 min baking time to be right on. Definately a keeper!

when i first made these cookies last night, i didn't really care for them, they have a strong cake flavor. but the next day they tasted a lot better and i kept grabbing for more. they remind me of cookie cakes/cookie you buy at the mall. i used Pillsbury yellow cake mix and a mixed cup of chocolate chips, toffee bits, & walnuts. i think next time i will use white cake mix for a more mild cake taste. just an fyi, it is normal for the cake batter to feel greasy while scooping onto baking pan. i was worried about the texture before baking, but they turned out fine.

I searched this out to make for a district meeting we had to make 3 dozen cookies.  I had cake mixes I wanted to use up and made vanilla (confetti cake mix) and walnut cookies, chocolate mint chip and chocolate peanut butter chip chookies.  I forgot to add the baking powder to the vanilla cookies and they did not come out as thick as the others but tasty.  Had 9 dozen cookies baked and on platters in about 45 minutes!! I think the add ins are a must to make a decent cookie although my teens liked the cookie part also.

Reduced sugar cake mix (Pillsbury) made this possible for me because I am diabetic. I used this recipe because of the baking powder. Glad I did. Got nice round pillowy, chewy cookies. I made them into small balls and slightly flattened them. 8 min baking was perfect. I only had chocolate cake mix and they were scrumptious. My last batch I added a little peanut butter...YUMMY!!

Better with 1/3 c. oil.  I had to bake mine much longer, and I like chewy/not so baked cookies.  The edges were very flat and darkened faster, but the rest of the cookie looked great.  There are so many combinations!

I completly forgot about my daughter's Brownie cookie swap for the holidays.  I had heard of cake mix cookies, but this sounded too easy.  IT WAS EASY!!  Like others I used a stick of butter instead of oil.  I used white cake mix and added in Christmas sprinkles and chocolate chips.  It only took a few minutes to mix it all up.  Then to make a lot I used a melon baller scoop to measure them out.  (This also made them even.)  I yeilded 3 dozen.  I am not a cookie person and I thought these were awesome.  I will be makiing these again, and hopefully looking like the baking queen!  :)

This recipe was very easy to make, but the taste was nothing special. Much too sweet for my taste.

I like to try odd things.  I used Red Velvet cake mix and frosted the cookies with the traditional white frosting.  They were way too sweet for my taste, but our customers loved them.  Thanks, Angela.

I made these using devil's food cake mix and peanut butter chips. I found that the ingredient amounts were accurate, but I ended up adding a few tsp. of water to make this dough more manageable. 
Baking for about 10 minutes, then letting them sit on the cookie sheet for an add'l five minutes produced a delicious chewy cookie. This a great "quicky" recipe when you don't have time to mess with a ton of ingredients. I'm excited to experiment with this recipe--thanks!

With chocolate-lovers in the house, we decided to use milk chocolate cake mix with milk chocolate chips.  We also rounded the spoonfuls and rolled them in powdered sugar before baking.  Very yummy!!

Is it a brownie? Is it a cookie? It's the best of both worlds!! One of those rare occasions where the first attempt surpassed my expectations... We tried Devil's Food cake w/ White chocolate chips. Using 1/3 cup oil should definately suffice as long as you grease the pan. Try adding 1/4 tsp. vanilla & bake for 10 minutes. Yum, yum. NO cookie dough on hand ~ NO PROBLEM!!

These are a definite keeper, excellent flavor. I really enjoyed these cookies and they were a big hit when I took them to a Church Cookie Exchange. I added Almond Toffee Chips and Milk Chocolate to Fudge Marble Cake Mix, YUMM! However, I was glad had made them that morning. I am not too crazy about the texture the next day. Next time I will either add a slice of white bread to my cookie tin or try as others have said for this recipe and add a spritz of water to the cookies after they have sat a day or so.

I made this recipe just as written (with a yellow cake mix) and was very disappointed.  It tasted really bad.  It was like an undercooked yellow cake with chocolate chips. It was easy but, that doesn't matter if the end product isn't good. Maybe it was the cake mix I used. I decided to try again with a devil's food cake mix and it was much better.

These cookies are so easy to make.  My 1 1/2 year old helped me!  We made 2 batches, 1 with yellow cake & 1 with chocolate cake.  We added toffee, chocolate chips, and walnuts.  Adjusting the baking time will make for a chewier or crispier cookie.  The chocolate cooked faster than the yellow did in my oven.

Very good but does taste like cake mix.  However if someone didn't know it was cake mix they may not suspect.  1 c. chips is not quite enough.  Next time I'll use 1 1/2 c.  My husband is enjoying them.  I used a 1 T cookie scoop and got about 46 cookies avg.-size.

Great recipe to change up to suit your tastes. I added 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts and a little more than 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips with french vanilla cake mix. Next time I will try them with applesauce instead of oil to try to cut some calories :-)

Super chewy and soft.  I took them out before they began to brown (after 7-8 minutes) and let them sit on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes.  I added chocolate chips and tofee bits!!  Sooo yummy!!  Great recipe and VERY easy to make! :)

This recipe is great!  I made some today using a chocolate cake mix that had chocolate chips already in the mix.  These are wonderful!  Can't wait to try some more. I'll post a picture of what I made I got over 4 doz. cookies out of my mix.  I like smaller cookies.  These are about 1 inch in diameter.  I have a melon baller that has two sizes on it.  I used the larger size end... for me it is perfect.  Take a look at the picture and see.  It has a red gingham tablecloth as a backgound :o)
Thanks for the recipe, it is one I will use from now on!

They were very good. I took the advice of others and used a stick of butter melted instead of oil. I used triple choc. cake mix and then split it in half and add coconut and chopped pecans to one and dried sweet cherries and semi sweet choco. chips to the other.They sold fast at the bake sale and they could not have been any easier to make. I did not give it 4 stars because they did not taste as good to me as scratch but kids and adults told me they were great.

This cookie is soft, chewy and delicious! I followed suggestion from others and used 1 stick of soft butter and 1 scant T. oil instead of 1/2 cup oil.  Used a milk chocolate cake mix and added 3/4 cup Health milk chocolate toffee bits.  Baked for 9 min.  Easy and wonderful - will definitely make this again.

If you want a semi-sweet cookie, this is not for you. If you want something rich, chewy and sweet, it doesn't get much better than this. I used yellow mix, leftover butterscotch and vanilla baking chips, and butter as suggested by other cooks. I also tossed in a handful of chopped pecans. I made the cookies larger (approx 1 1/2 tbls).I can't wait to try these again with different flavor combinations.
Thanks for such an easy recipe.

Perfect quick fix cookies! I used 1/2tsp of baking powder instead because I didn't want my cookies to be too puffy and cake like. I also used 2 egg whites so they would be healthier. Excellent results! If you decide to use egg whites, you must eat these fast (within the same day of baking) because the cookies will get very hard the next day.

These turned out so good,love them.  They don't spread and get thin, they are puffy and look nice, just how I like my cookies to turn out.  I used Pillsbury Devil's Food Cake mix and followed the recipe.  Will definetly make again!

I have tried several cake mix cookie recipes in an attempt to find the one I like the best.  This one is definately at the top of the list.  The baking power makes the cookies puff slightly and I like that.

Very good!! The only thing I added to this recipe was 1 tsp. of cinnamon. These cookies were very tasty. I then made ice cream sandwiches with them and used butter pecan ice cream. Excellent.....the cinnamon complemented the butter pecan ice cream. Thanks for an adaptable cookie recipe!

Wonderful!  I used yellow cake, chocolate chips and copped pecans.  I was able to get 41 good sized cookies out of this, thus reducing the calories per cookie.  =)

I've been using this recipe for about 6 mos. every Thurs. night for our Bible Quizers.  I make 3 boxes (2 doz each) and make different kinds every week.  I've used every kind of cake mix and never had a prob.  One of my secrets was given to me from my mother-in-law, bake cookies til just light brown around the bottom, take them out and let them finish baking on the sheet.  ALWAYS WORKS FOR ME, haven't had a complaint yet.  Followed the instructions and used a cookie scoop.

This recipe is sooo easy to do and was a great hit with my family. I used the Duncan H french vanilla Ultra moist recipe and added the chocolate chips. I also used only 1/3c. oil and put a piece of bread in the jar with them. and found that i had to bake them for 13 min instead of the 8 to 10 but no biggy. I just loved this and will use it more often in the future. It is quick and easy. I give a huge thumbs up for this recipe.

Thankfully, I put a piece of bread in my cookie jar - otherwise these would have been hard almost immediately!  They actually turned out to be quite yummy.  I made a white icing and put it between the cookies and made little cookie sandwiches - which I'm sure also helped to keep them moist.  Definately keep in mind they these will/may get hard almost as soon as they exit the oven.

I used devil's food with mini chocolate chips and they turned out great.  Some cake cookies spread out too much while cooking but these look perfect!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

good for using up extra cake mix!!
I found that a chocolate cake mix is better than yellow or white. Very chewy cookies.
They taste excellent, but definitely use 1/3 cup oil rather than 1/2 cup.

Last night I made chocolate cookies with peanut butter morsals and regular chocolate chip.  I did find the batter to be very greasy (your palms are covered with grease when you roll them into balls) but they did turn out to be excellent tasting and a really nicely shaped (thick not flat) cookies overall.  I also found that the batter yielded 3 dozen cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very moist like brownies.  I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and it worked out really well.  Used chocolate cake mix and added chocolate chips.  Very dark and rich.  Would love to try this with other cake mixes and other add-ins.  My co-workers really liked the cookies.

I love this recipe!  I always add about 1/4 c cocoa powder and chocolate chips.  They are always a hit, and nobody can ever tell that they are from cake mix.  Since I am a new mom I am always looking for easy and fast recipes.  This one is great!

I've made these twice in a week and used previous recommendations of using less oil, I used 1/3 cup oil and they turned out great. I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and put mint chocolate chips in it. I also made it with peanut butter chips, both were good but I prefer the mint chips and will make it again. I look forward to trying it with the yellow cake mix too.

The cookies were very easy to make, but they seemed to cook a lot faster than regular chocolate chip cookies because I managed to burn the bottoms with them only baking for about 6 min.

They were all right, nothing too spectacular. I think I'll stick to my normal yellow cake cookie recipe. I just don't think you can taste the cakeness in this one. My friends and family were shocked this was a yellow cake cookie; since the general consensus was, "it's an ok chocolate chip cookie."

This was my first time making cookies with cake mix. I substituted the 1/2c veg oil for 1/3c apple sauce and 1tbl spoon veg oil (to cut out some of the fat). They came out great! I will make again for a quick cookie fix or even for the kids.

I needed to make a quick batch of cookies and this recipe fit the bill.  I had only a box of Duncan Hines white cake mix and no goodies to throw in.  They were wonderful!  I was wishing I had put a few sprinkles on them before baking to dress them up, but will do so the next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The addition of baking powder makes these cookies turn out better than cake mix cookies without baking powder . . . thanks for posting this recipe!!!

Definitely 5 Stars.  I used moist chocolate triple fudge and reduced the oil to 1/4 (but then it looked slightly dry so I added just a slight more) rolled it in powdered sugar.  Absolutely perfect, not too sickeningly sweet and just gorgeous overall.  My recipe only made a dozen normal sized cookies but still I'm keeping this one for life!

Wonderful and very quick! Because I have a favorite chocolate chip recipe, instead of adding chocolate chips, I added coconut and a little orange powder. It was delicious.

WAY, too much oil!!! My cookie dough was dripping and had to add extra flour just to ba able to roll out.  I would suggest reducing amount of oil to 1/4 cup.

This recipe is quite easy to make and the cookies are good, basic cookies. Like another reviewer mentioned, the dough is fairly oily, but that does bake off nicely. I used a store brand "moist" mix and got good results. I like the fact that this recipe is quite adaptable.

These are really great, easy cookies.  I've made several variations on them in the past, and they've all been great.  Our favorites are to use yellow cake mix and 3 snickers bars, or yellow cake mix and 3-4 toffee bars broken up.  They are really awesome, but they disappear very quickly!!  I plan to try peppermint pieces and chocolate chips for Christmas.

I wanted to bake cookies but was running low on ingredients. I decided to try a cake mix cookie for a change... I only had white cake mix on hand so i used that. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract and used mini m&m's. They turned out great, soft and delicious!

Very Easy. I love to cook fancy desserts but I find with kids around they would rather have simple cookies. These bake perfectly if you use a cookie scoop. I used a Funfetti cake mix and icing with sprinkles. They were gone fast. Tasted just like birthday cake without the mess of cutting and serving.

I did like the quickness of the recipe, but I did not like the taste.  Just as the reviews said, it was too "cake"-like, but in a bad way.  Too greasy (and I used 1/3 c oil as recommended). It just didn't taste right.

I used @ 1/4 cup oil and I felt this was enough.  I think the baking soda gave the cookies extra body.  Will make again!

Great and simple cookies! My husband can't stay away from them! My spin on these was to add in 8oz. cream cheese, then top with a little bit of icing after they cooled off. I would describe them as "cupcake tops". I'll be making these again!

Easy and perfect!!  I accidently added 3 eggs and they were still great.  Really easy to make with kids.  I was worried about the taste after reading other reviews but I used butter as someone else had suggested and they tasted better than my scratch choco. chip cookie recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

i just made these cookies tonight. i used funfetti cake mix and mini m&ms. i used 1/3 cup oil and baked for about 8-9 minutes each batch. i got 40 average sized cookies out of the batter. the cookies are very soft and look undone when you take them out of the oven, but set perfectly.

This is a a really good recipe, but like some others I have modified it.  I use Devil's food cake mix, add in about a tablespoon or two of softened butter, I use 1/2 chocolate chips 1/2 white chocoloate and chopped pecans or walnuts whatever I may have at the time and then roll the cookies in powdered sugar before I put them in the oven.  I bake them until right before they are done so that they stay soft for days!

YUM and so easy! I used chocolate cake mix with chocolate chips, and baked the cookies for 10 minutes and let them cool on the pan for an additional 5 minutes. Great! My boyfriend gave them 7 out of 10 stars. Thanks for the easy recipe!

VERY GOOD!  Wanted something quick to make with my daughter...these were PERFECT.  We added 1/2 CUP of QUICK COOKING OATS for texture and used 2 squares of chopped semi-sweet chocolate. Perfect consistancy to use a small scoop so they looked beautiful too! And the oats helped make them not too sweet. Thanks!

I could tell when I got the dough together that there was too much oil.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  I used a devil's food mix.  Added a mixture of semi-sweet chips, M&M's, and peanutbutter/choc. swirl chips.  They do taste like fudgey little brownies and the flavor was good.  There are other cake mix recipes I like better on here.  They taste great out of the oven but if not going to consume right away, I would suggest a slice of bread...with all that oil, i'm afraid they will dry out quickly.  Great for kids who don't have a very discriminating pallate.  Also a great recipe to have if wanting a quick cookie fix without the fuss.

I made my cookies with brickle chips.  I thought they were VERY sweet.  I don't know that I would make again.  They weren't bad, just a little too sweet for me and I LOVE sweets.  I did get more than two dozen cookies out of mine.  I used a 1 tbsp. cookie scoop and they made pretty good sized cookies ( I am guessing about 48).

I used a milk chocolate cake mix with peanut butter chips and a few walnut pieces. They were just WONDERFUL! My husband raved and didn't really believe they were from a cake mix!

Easy to make and good too! My mom was surprised when I told her how easy these cookies were to make. I used white cake mix because it was what I had on hand and it turned out fine.

Having a cold and not being in the mood to bake, I looked for the quickest cookie recipe I could find. I used a confetti cake mix that had been long forgotten in the back of the pantry and 2 cups of swirl chips with 1/2 cup of pecans. I also left out the baking powder because I couldn't find it at the time. These came out surprisingly well! Actually a very tasty cookie. Made them yesterday and they're still soft this morning. I think this will be an excellent recipe for my grandaughter's first "by herself" cookies to bake.

Very Good Cookie if you need something quick.
I used lemon cake mix Yum, carrot cake with raisns & Walnuts, Chocolate with maracino cherries was good also, I think I might try, Cherry chip with maracino cherries, it is a fun recipe to let your imagination run wild.

This cookie just didn't do anything for me.  I used Duncan Hines yellow cake, as others suggested, and it tasted just like yellow cake mix.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  I even tried adding some oatmeal to the second half of the batch, it didn't do much.  I think this probably would be much better with a chocolate mix, but I definitely won't make it again with a yellow.

These cookies are OK, they do taste like they were from a cake mix. Perfect for throwing something quick together for a gathering or school function. They're easy and there isn't really any prep work.

Excellent recipe! Try them and be amazed how tasty and beautiful they turn out. I added Macadamia nuts, white chocolate chunks and Heath bar bits to a vanilla cake mix. Everyone wonders what my "secret" is!

Thank you a million times over for this recipe. It is absolutely the best cookie recipe I have tried (and I've made LOTS).  I made it the way your recipe suggests except I cut down on the oil a tad.  I cant way to make it with different kinds of cake mixes and different flavored chips.

I made these for a church event and they were a hit! I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used red, white and blue star sprinkles right when I took them out of the oven! They tasted great! Can't wait to try them with chocolate chips! Thanks Angela!

I made these with one yellow and one spice mixand doubled except oil. I used 1/2 C. oil and 1/2 C. chunky unsweetened applesauce. It looked a little wet so I added 1/3 C. of flour. Still looked wet, but tasted great. I also added 3/4 C. each of walnuts, raisins, and cinnamon bits. Yummmmmmmmm

these were really good and quick! I also used only 1/3 cup of oil per suggestions and the cookies were perfect. While I reccomend the yellow cake and chocolate cake cookies, my family didn't care for the spice ones at all. Matter of taste I guess, but worth playing around with!

This was so simple and they tasted so great!!  I used a yellow cake mix with mini M&M's
that were leftover from Halloween candy that I had in the freezer, too easy!!  I used some of
the other reviews and used a little less oil.  We have a local store that has left over funfetti cake
mixes 4/$1 and what a great way to make cookies for $.25.  I just bought a spice cake mix and can't wait to 
try that.  Thanks, for making this busy mom's baking easier!

You'd better like super-sweet cookies if you're going to make these!  :)  Althought I found them way too sweet, most people who tried them said they liked them.  They are really fast and easy to make, though, since they don't require measuring out a whole lot of dry ingredients or creaming together sugar and butter, like most cookie recipes do. The two combinations I tried were: spice cake mix with butterscotch morsels & vanilla cake mix with Heath bits and macadamia nuts.

I made this for my church's women's Bible study for a cookie exchange, and they loved it!  I used raspberry chocolate chips for the candy, and it was a hit!  I think it was a bit on the oily side, but then again, I use REAL butter in all my cooking, and that may have added to it.  I don't know.  It was easy, great-tasting, and kids loved it!

My boyfriend said these were the best cookies i have ever made for him in 10 years!  I used DH moist yellow cake, chocolate chips and pecans.  I used coconut oil  and i think that added to the delicate taste of the cookies.

Made these cookies at a spur of the moment time and had tons of cake mix in the cupboards. I used Betty Crocker super moist yellow cake mix, and I added mini chocolate chips in it (but not too much to drown it in chocolate(; ). And I also switched the vegetable oil for warmed up coconut oil. They turned out GREAT! Perfectly crispy on the bottom (I left them in the oven for about 14 minutes) with a moist center. And they weren't super oily! Definitely going to use this one again!

Awesome cookies!!! I used Duncan Hines Caramel Cake Mix with 1/2 cup each of peanut butter chips and semisweet chocolate chips. 3 dozen cookies made and only 15 left for tomorrow after my kids and husband got their hands on them. I would like to try them with butter instead of the oil to give it an extra little zip! I also do not use the baking powder. Completely unnecessary step.

I was excited to try this with the baking powder added to the recipe. I usually use a recipe w/o baking powder and with only 1/3 cup oil.  Unfortunately, I was unhappy with the results of this recipe.  The cookies were very very flat.

This is THE EASIEST cookie recipe! I made three batches of it. I tried it with white/yellow/chocolate. All of them came out tasty and perfect. I'm very tempted to think that the "sugar cookie mix" in the bag you can get at the store is simply cake mix. Wow! I did forgo a mixer and used a wooden spoon and used a small cookie scoop. Each batch made exactly 4 dozen cookies! This is now a staple in my baking repertoire.

These were super easy to make.  We made half with chocolate chips and half with some peanut butter candies.  Perfect for letting my almost three year old help out with making.

These were very tasty. I don't think the are as good as the real thing, but they work for a quick cookie recipe. They are softer then a regular cookie, so these are great for little ones.

I made these for a party and they were a hit with the kids. The rest of the deserts were left untouched but the cookies were gone before I got to try one. They were so easy and a great way to get rid of leftover cake mix.

These were fast, easy, and delicious! I made them at the spur of the moment while waiting on dinner to cook. I used Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme cake mix (which was left over from the holidays), and half a bag of coconut. I did not have any cooking oil, so l usd melted butter. When they were done, I sprinkled them wih powdered sugar. The kids loved them; and I will definetely be trying these again soon!

I used devil's food cake mix, added peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Pretty good for some fast PB cookies.  They are a little crumbly as someone else stated, but for something in a hurry, it's not bad.

Soft and cakey.  Delicious!  Easy to make.  I used cherry chip flavored cake mix and topped with pink icing.  I also tried a batch using white cake mix flavored with lemon juice and topped with yellow icing.  They were a big hit at the wedding shower I took them to.

These cookies were super simple to make, inexpensive and pretty tasty to boot.  They don't beat out my go-to from scratch chocolate chip cookie recipe by any means, but if you're short on time or just feeling lazy like I was they're worth making.  As a lot of people have said, they definitely taste like cake mix, but what's wrong with that?  Cake is good right?  They're a little bit crunch and a little bit chewy/soft in the middle.    I'll definitely try using other cake mix flavors the next go round.

Easy, Easy recipe to use as a base for lots of combination's of ingredients! I substituted 1 stick of butter for the oil, used a spice cake mix, to which I added 1/2 c. of quick cooking oats and 1/2 c. butterscotch chips. Kids loved it. Next time, I may use finely chopped nuts instead of chips. Will be trying someones' suggestion for the strawberry cake w/ fruit next.

I like that these were so easy to make.  No mixer required, which has given me a break from creaming butter and sugar.  However, they do have a bit of a weird taste being they are from cake mix.  By weird I mean something along the lines of playdough comes to mind.  I used yellow cake mix, so perhaps a different flavor might taste better.

FRUIT CAKE COOKIES!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used vanilla super-moist cake mix, and for my cup of 'goodies' I used candied fruit bits and chopped walnuts.  I sprinkled them with green sugar crystals and they made the most delicious holiday cookies.  Colorful, soft, sweet and oh so good!!!

All 3 of my children thought they were delicious!  My 16 year old thought they tasted like chocolate chip sugar cookies.  It is such a simple recipe, you can't go wrong.  Just an update to my original review:  I just made a batch and added 2/3 cup oats and 1/4 cup chopped nuts with mini chocolate chips-- great. I added grated lemon zest and poppyseed to a third batch (no choc. chips) and they were fabulous.

I was craving cookies but didn't have any brown sugar, so using cake mix worked out well.  I used Duncan Hines extra moist in devils food cake and it turned out fine (not fabulous, but I was satisfied).  These cookies really spread out on your cookie sheet, so make sure to place them far apart.

These cookies were very greasy as I had to add a little more oil to mix the dough. My husband put them in the frig and said they were much better.

I just made this recipe with a Devil's Food cake mix (I had one on hand), 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup pecans.  Next time I will use fewer chocolate chips becasue 1 cup is too many to mix into the batter fully.  All-in-all, a good easy, pull it out of the cupboard recipe.

These cookies turned out really good. I used applesauce instead of oil and egg substitute instead of eggs. The combinations of cake mix and add in's is endless. One combo I liked is strawberry cake mix with mini milk chocolate, chocolate chips(reminds me of a chocolate cover strawberry).

I'm giving these cookies a 5 star rating because they are soooo easy to make and the ingrediants are almost always on hand. They taste like gooey butter cookies to me because I left out the chocolate chips but did sprinkle them with powdered sugar. Yummy and easy.

My boyfriend isnt abig fan of chocolate, i personally cant go a day without it. I decided to try these to satisfy his sweet tooth.. DELICIOUS! The batter is a little greasy and crumbles a bit when placed on the baking sheet. I just add sprinkles to make them look a bit more colorful...  Overall, very good! Definitely making again.

Excellent recipe. I made 3 batches. One with yellow cake mix and chocolate chip cookies(they were good, but i would use a regular choco chip recipe if i had the time) 

The second batch was with Chocolate cake mix with chocolate chips/coconut as the mix in. They came out great.And some how the chocolate cake mix actually left the cookies baked more round instead of flat.

 And the third batch I use yellow cake mix added a dash of immitation almond extract then  split the batter in half. One half I took and dipped in colored sugar- good but next time would mix regular sugar into the dough  before dipping it in. 

The second half of the batch I mixed in rainbow sprinkles- came out great. Definately a great universal cookie mix. Next time

Maybe it was that I didn't bake them long enough but I just am not crazy about the texture of these cookies.  My son loved them so that is a plus - also means I will be making them again.  Nice and easy.

Might be one of my favorite cookie recipes - they're ridiculously easy to make, and if you like yellow cake, you'll love these. 
I substituted 1 stick of butter for the oil as previous reviewers had suggested and used Moist cake mix, and they came out beautifully. Definitely cook on a silpat.

I used spice cake instead of the yellow cake mix and chopped peanuts instead of the chocolate. My dad and all my friends loved them. Can't wait to do some more experimenting with this recipe. Thank you so much!

I was a little concerned the oil was too much since the batter literally had oil pooled at the bottom of the bowl.  But once they are baked, they are not greasy at all.  And they are soooooo good!  As good as my favorite choc chip cookie recipe but 1/4 of the work!  I'll be making these again and seeing what creations I can come up with.  I baked for 11 minutes on my SilPat and ended up with 3 dozen.

I found these cookies to be best with a Devil's food cake mix.  I think the yellow mix gives the cookies a funny taste, but this recipe does allow for versatility.

These are great for school lunches. I also use this recipe when I teach a Kids Cooking School for my local school district.   I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the yellow cake mix has an odd flavor.  However using a chocolate cake mix is a real winner!

These are great cookies!!  My 2 daughters love them and can't wait to make them themselves.  Like others, we used 1/3 cup oil.  That is the only change.  We made them yesterday and today they are still soft and chewy.  Thanks so much!

YUMMY. I used a chocolate cake mix with peanut butter chips.  Our 4 year old daughter loved them and thought they tasted like brownies.  My husband and father also enjoyed them.  Cannot wait to try other variations.

Simple and tasty. I made these cookies with chocolate cake & added almonds.  They were so simple, yet looked great - like bake shop cookies.

These were fantastic, I used a carrot cake mix and Hershey's Cinnamon Chips. The whole family loved them and they were so easy to make, I am making more for a bake sale tomorrow.Thanks for the great recipe

My 9 year old son, Chris Morris, made these cookies last week and they were great.  He wanted me to put his last name in case a friend were to come across this.  Had a little trouble mixing but all I have is a little hand mixer.  pl

Excellent and versatile! German chocolate mix w/ toffee bits is the bomb, according to my kids...my hubby loves a butter pecan mix with extra pecans.I can make 2 dozen of each in no time, without a bunch of measuring to do! Thanks!

I found Allrecipes last night and already I have used two different recipes.  These were great. With 6 kids, cookies are always on demand and these are quick and easy.  I used a white cake mix with chocolate chips.  They were really good and I had to hide them to keep the kids from eating them all.  I will be trying other combinations of mixes and chips also.

Really quick & easy to do. Taste better with chocolate cake mix.
