I did my first loaf after reading all the reviews and my husband loves it. I'd like to suggest letting the loaf sit for 15 minutes before cutting, this will prevent oozing of the cheese. 
When I made it the second time, I dicovered a way to simplify the rolling process and had great success.
I divided my meat mixture into 3 batches and cheese into 2 batches (like a lasagne).  Fill the bottom of a 9x13 dish with the 1st batch, then sprinkle cheese on top, avoiding the edges.
I then pat the 2nd batch on top, taking a little care to seal the edges with a spatula.  Cheese on top of that.
Finally, the 3rd batch of meat on top of that, sealing the edges again.
I then sprinkled ketchup and mustard overall.  It came out tasting the same as the recipe indicated, but saves much time and effort.

This is a great recipe!  I only gave it 4 stars because I found the "jelly-roll" effect to be more trouble than it was worth.  Instead, I just half the meat mixture and make a channel for the cheese down the center and then top with the remaining meat mixture. It is much more simple and it isn't as messy!  Tastes fantastic as is or is easy to jazz up too!

Delicious!  Here are a few of my suggestions - to avoid the grease problem - use super lean beef - I used 95% lean, it wasn't greasy at all... also, I used mozzarella in the middle (part-skim).  It was perfect!  And, for those of you watching calories/fat, it's pretty friendly, only 3 WW points per slice!

We loved this, I did add some Montreal steak seasoning and worcestershire to it and topped it with barbecue sauce. I didn't have any wax paper, and parchment made it really easy to roll up. There was one spot where I didn't seal it well, so the cheese goozed out. I also baked it in a loaf pan and periodically drained the grease and let it sit for 15 minutes to ease in slicing it. Thanks Douglas, this was a winner in our house! :)

I was very glad I'd read the reviews on this recipe beforehand or I might have throw up my hands at the rolling it up stage. It's tricky, but doable with some patience. I used foil instead of wax paper.

Very good meatloaf recipe. I added 1/4 cup of worchester sauce, and 1/2 cup bell pepper to the mix for alittle more flavor. Also I subsituted the shredded chedder with Sargentos mexican cheese blend. The guys at work LOVED it.

I am not a meatloaf fan but this was very good. Didn't taste like meatloaf. The taste was very good. I had a hard time rolling it like a jelly roll. I will make it again.

Wow! Even my 5 yr old liked it. It really reminds of a MacDonalds' cheeseburger. I thought it was good and will make it again. I halved the recipe & used very lean ground beef, american cheese slices, and 1 tablespoon worchestshire.

I scaled this recipe down to 2, left out the egg and it still came out good.  I did have a little "oozing of the cheese" and it was a little greasy, so next time I will use sirloin & fat free cheese.  I did add a little thyme & a dash of crushed rosemary to the loaf.  Good change from the normal meatloaf as well as burger.  Thanks Douglas!

Excellent!! Tasted exactly like a cheeseburger. Could be used for potluck. Great with barbeque sauce on top.

Used this recipe for a meatloaf cook-off that I organized for my Boss's birthday (his favorite food). I  used 1/2 cup of crushed salinities in substitution of the bread crumbs. I also glazed the top of the meatloaf with a glaze made up of ketchup, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar. I was also going to put bacon on top of that but forgot to get some at the store. Will make again and it got great reviews. We did roll it and the cheese did leak out a little bit during baking but not very much. It was delicious. Will definitely make over and over again.

Easy recipe to follow, traditional meatloaf with a fun twist.Here are some tips:

To prevent your meatloaf from breaking up at the bottom or being greasy, add 1 solid layer of foil at the bottom of the baking pan, then add another layer of foil on top of that, but poke small holes in the top layer. The grease from the beef drips through the holes and stays away from beef and the bottom foil catches it for easy clean up after cooking!

Also, to make the jelly roll effect easier, try flattening the beef onto a large piece of foil, add cheese, then lift the edges of the foil to manipulate the beef instead of your hands. I found this to be easier and less messy.

I added worchestershire sauce and diced vadalia onion (no minced onions) to the beef mix - put half of the (lean) beef mixture in a meatloaf pan then put thick slices of cheese on - then topped with rest of beef mixture and tucked it in. About 10 minutes before it was done I mixed brown sugar, ketchup and mustard together and topped it. YUMMY !!!!

The way I jelly-roll this is I take a baking sheet and line with wax paper a little longer than the pan and spread the meat mixture out the full length of the pan, its about 3/4 of the way up the sides, spread shredded cheddar cheese all the way around keeping an inch or two from the sides and end then pulling up on the wax paper I start to roll, roll a little pull the wax paper, keep it fairly tight, roll a little and pull the paper till the end. I spray a little cooking spray onto the pan turn the roll sideways and voila - fold the  ends down and form a good "seel" at the ends and bake. Be sure to let set for 10min or so so the cheese doesnt ooze all over. Enjoy - I like to top it with Ketchup the last 15min of cooking as well.

This is very good.  I have made this many times.  I use turkey meat because I prefer it.  I divide it in half and layer pepper jack cheese and fresh chopped broccoli then put the other half of meat mixture on top and seal the edges.  Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Very good!!

I love the idea of this meatloaf but it was so salty I threw out the leftovers.  I put less than the amount of salt it called for.  Did anyone else have this problem?

Family approved...5 stars...easy and they loved the cheesey filling. I also made a glaze of ketchup, worsteshire sauce, brown sugar and a little dry mustard to top half of the meatloaf since hubby likes the sweet ketchup-y glaze. Served with broccoli and Darn Good Mashed Taters! from this site. Thanks!

This is really a great meatloaf recipe and I did it as it said to do except I added one other ingredient and that was a can of pizza sauce. Mix half of it in with the meat mixture and use the other half to cover the loaf... Cover with foil and cook as directed. Just adds a little more flavor, in my opinion.  GLD

This is good and adds a neat twist to plain, old, Monday night meatloaf.  I used ground chicken and it was quite tasty. I added a few more spices, (garlic powder, Creole seasoning, Adobo All Purpose seasoning). I also followed the suggestion to skip the pinwheel method and just halved the meat mixture and layered the cheese between the halves and formed into a loaf.  I'm sure this made my life much easier and I thank all who suggested it! :-)

No leftovers! My family loved it. I added minced celery and bell pepper and garlic powder. Instead of the jelly roll. I did as the recipe states, but I folded it into thirds by pulling one side slightly over center, then pulled the other side slightly over that and sealed it. Make sure to seal the ends well or you will lose a lot of cheese. Thanks for recipe.

Pretty good.  It was easy to roll up with the wax paper.  I overlooked the step that said to fold the ends, so some of the cheese oozed out - but it at least made good cheese crusties on the edge of the pan!  I used 80% lean ground chuck because it was on sale - I wasn't sure what kind of ground beef to use since I never make meatloaf.  Anyway, quick and easy!

Uber yummy!  I used 3/4 turkey 1/4 ground sirloin (it's what I had). And velveeta cheese.  Who's idea was it for molten lava meatloaf?!? Brilliant!  I did stripes of mustard and ketchup on top before baking insteadvpf traditional tomato sauce.  Served with pickle chips-you can have your hamburger.  I'll take this instead:)

This was great. We're a household of 2 so I cut the recipe back, there was still a little too much cheese/meat ratio but it was still great. Truly, this is going to be in our rotation for meals. It's a little bit of work, but if you were to prep it the night before you would have a great meal to cook the next day.

Read tips from readers and applied them for easier rolling techniques. Everyone who ate it like it in my family. Next time I think I might make 2 separate ones and freeze one for a later date

I thought the recipe sounded good, but I thought I would kick it up by adding some bacon.  I partially cooked 1/2 pound of bacon and mixed most of it with the ground beef before I formed the meatloaf.  I used the rest as garnish-delish!

Great recipe!the whole family loved it. I doubled the quantity, used an extra cup of bread crumbs , this made the rolling easier. Brushed it with mustard and ketchup.I put a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. A croud pleaser.

I doubled the recipe to make a 4 lb. meatloaf (family of 5 and we like leftovers) which went just fine. My family LOVED it, said it was the best meatloaf ever. I chose to do as others suggested and put a layer of meat down, then cheese and then seal with top layer of meat. All went well until final 30 minutes of baking (doubled recipe had to bake 90 minutes) when a leak sprang and some of the cheese leaked out. Next time I'll try to make sure there aren't any thin places. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it with us!

Best meatloaf I've ever had in my life. Modified it slightly, added cayanne pepper, paprika, rosemary.  Ate it on flatbread with ketchup and vegetables.    Taste restaurant quality. Amazing. Wish I could give more stars. If a tomato sauce is added at top, this might be the greatest thing ever

I invested in a two part meatloaf pan and can't say enough about it.  I put my meat mixture in the top pan which fits inside the 2nd pan.  As the loaf cooks, all the fat runs out into the bottom pan.  I have never had a dry meatloaf, even when using low fat meats like ground turkey, but the fat is reduced. It is nonstick and cleans up like a dream. You could also use a diposable foil pan to hold the mixture and poke several holes in the bottom.  Set it in your regular meatloaf pan and the fat will drain out as above.

This was amazing!!  I did change it a bit because I only had 1lb of meat (this caused me to have to reduce the cooking time to 40 min), so I used the 2 eggs it called for and the amount of bread crumbs this recipe called for.  I used less onion and added green pepper cubes and a squirt of ketchup and mustard, also I was out of ground black pepper so I used 1 tsp of ground white pepper, this gave it a tasty kick!  Lastly I put 2 pieces of American cheese on top at the end of cooking.  It was incredible!! No leftovers with this one!!

Made this tonight. The only change I made was to add a bit more salt and I used Monterey Jack cheese. I added a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar, dry mustard and Worchester as others suggested. I thought it was very good. I did have trouble rolling it and I am used to making cakes in jelly roll pans. No problem though, stuffed it back togeher. My husband liked it as did I. It was easy to make and was a nice change from my normal way of making meatloaf.

This was delicious!  The only problem is the cheese runs out after the first slice.  Regardless, I will make this again and again.

This was a very good recipe.  I cut the recipe in half for just two and cut the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  The only issue that i ran into is that with only one pound of beef, it was thin and the cheese melted out.

This was good.  I followed advice others and did two layers meat mixture with cheese between.  Also added 1/4 cup worchestshire sauce.  Had a problem with the cheese oozing out while cooking, but great flavor!

This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe! Very easy & so good! Just like a big cheesburger! Instead of rolling it jelly style I just divided the meat and placed one loaf down & sprinkled the cheese on top then placed the second loaf on top and closed the edges.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing except I didn't jelly roll it. I took someone else's suggestion and put half the meat in a loafpan, made a channel for the cheese, and then put the rest of the meat on top making sure to pinch it closed. It turned out excellant and my husband and mother-in-law have both requested that I make it often. It was also delicious as meatloaf sandwich the next day!

this was very good...i used italian blend cheese for a filling with some garlic and tabasco in the meatloaf but otherwise followed the recipe...keep the meat mixture at least 2 inches thick when you spread it out on the foil before rolling (don't use waxed paper...it gets wet...and spray the foil first with oil)...don't try and spread it too thin....the cheese will spurt out where it can...don't touch the meat...use the foil to roll the loaf using a spatula to encourage anything sticking to the foil...then when it is all sealed up (seam and ends) just roll it into the loaf pan off the foil...also make sure to drain this a couple of times during baking...i covered with foil til the last 20 mn then browned and it worked out nice....served with hot corn from this site and fried potatoes...num num

Wow.  I made this recipe because all I had in freezer was hamburger meat.  My husband hates meatloaf, but he loved this one.  My 5 year old autistic son who usually doesn't eat much ate all of his portion and asked for more.  Even my 2 year old loved it.  I patted meat into rectangle like it said but couldn't roll it so I just folded it over (the chesse was mixed in with the meat.)  and covered it and it was great.  Loved it with ketchup.  Thank you so much.  This will probably be the only meatloaf I cook for my family.

I made it with ground turkey and mozarella cheese.  It was terrific and even better as leftovers.  I was proud to serve a piece to a friend a couple days after making it.  She loved it too.

I used my ninja processer and minced a whole onion and 4 cloves garlic and one egg, so no chunks. . Used half cup breadcrumbs and whole cup toll house butter crackers and added 2 tbs ms dash garlic blend and 1 tsp sage. Used 3 tbsp sourcream instead of milk and 1/3 c steak sauce. Topped with mix of ketchup mustard and brown sugar sauce last 15 min.was outstanding

Not "easy to prepare" as listed (rolling it up), but easy to prepare if you put half the meat in the pan, a cheese layer (need not be shredded with this method), and the rest of the meat layer on top.
Then it is easy, and yummy!

The jelly roll thing for this was easy for me (had never tried it before) but may have been an accident lol Basically I picked up the end of the wax paper and started lifting, like I was gonna tip off the burger / fold it using the paper. Well, right as the first side started to roll over, I peeled the paper back and with one hand UNDER the edge of it, I just lifted the burger with my off hand (the one UNDER the wax paper), and peeled back the paper with  my main hand. Basically just rolling it, while peeling off the paper. I put the end of the paper on the cookie sheet and just rolled it right on. 

Other tweaks to list later: I added pickle juice to the meat. Added minced garlic. Replaced the reg salt & pepper with a combo of Lawry's and Celery salt, TINY amount of black pepper (for flavor, not heat) and Worcestershire.

Painted the loaf with drizzled olive oil And BBQ sauce. (non home made... Lazy :P).

After taking it out I moved it to ANOTHER cookie sheet due to the amount of grease. I had a POOL of it. So moving it over made me feel better then seeing it bathe in oil.

Tasted AMAZING and the pickle juice added a much more authentic burger taste. And Lawry's always brings out the taste of burger.

Gave it a 4 just because I could improve it still :P

Made this twice for my son and husband. They loved it! Didn't roll it up, just easier to add layers of beef and cheese. Tastes great, but I thought it was too oily/greasy. I will make again, just have to use very lean beef and will cut down on the amount of cheese used. We top ours with BBQ sauce and serve over mashed potatoes. It is very good.

Love this recipe! It has become a new favorite in our home - my husband craves it weekly! One trick I use is to use roll it up (because it really is better rolled as apposed to  layered) is to sprinkle a little bit of lowery's seasoning on the wax paper.

Very, Very Yummy! Easy to make..I added spices that my family enjoys and topped with my favorite meatloaf sauce (yellow mustard, brown sugar, catsup, and a smidge of bbq sauce) for the last fifteen minutes of bake time.  I paired this Cream Peas, and Mashed potatoes. Very hearty and satisfying dinner with plenty of leftovers.

This is awesome. We decided to slice up onions and add ketchup in the middle along with the cheese.

Great flavor and simple to make.  I added a spread that was just BBQ sauce, ketchup, a little yellow mustard and sugar.

This is yummy! I would also recommend letting it sit before cutting it open to keep the cheese from seeping out but the flavour is delicious!

We had this last night and we didn't care for it at all.  We like meatloaf and this was very tasteless.  There is no real seasoning in this recipe and that should have been the clue.  However I wanted to try it as is to be fair. We will go back to our old recipe or try something else.

My family loved this....they love chedder.  I think next time I will try and make this "lower in calories" if that's possible (That's the reason I gave it 3 1/2 stars).

Very good. Quick and somple. I added Bacon bits on top of the ketchup 1/2 way through cooking!!! A lot of variety in this recipe since you could basically stuff it and top it with hundreds of items! Will keep handy.

I am yet undecided with this recipe (I say this, but I've also made this more than once now, so maybe I like it more than I think I do?) First of all, the taste of cheddar and the flavor of red meat doesn't work with me. I've started using American cheese instead. Plus, to make things easier, I've used the suggestion of others to mold the meat into a bowl like shape, add the cheese, and then add the top half. This technique works, but I think it would taste better to make it as a jelly roll liked stated in the recipe. The cheese would be better distributed throughout. And perhaps because I haven't made it this way yet, the bake time is very off. I always have to bake it for so much longer, and it's still not as dry and cooked as I think meatloaf should be. I also don't put ketchup on the top out of preference.

Delicous! I really liked this - down to the last bite. Not the easiest meatloaf you will ever make but the result is worth it. Not too hard, just more work than most loafs I have ever made. Rolling the load like a jelly roll takes some practice and patients. Give this a try if you love a moist meatloaf dripping in cheese. Oh I do...

Tasty but not exceptional - it was just OK. My husband and I prefer my basic 'old faithful' meatloaf recipe. Even though I let it sit for at least 15 minutes after it was done, the cheese filling still oozed out when I cut it. I most likely won't make it again.

After reading the reviews, I thought the rolling might be difficult, but I found it to be a cinch.  I used the wax paper to help me roll it rather than touching the meatloaf with my hands.  It rolled right up - perfection.  When I went to get the cheese out of the frig, I noticed some string cheese, so I started my roll with those.  Then rather than pinching the ends, I sort of stuffed them shut with the hamburger.  It stayed together beautifully.  I did wait maybe 10 minutes before cutting it, and could have waited a few more but it didn't ooze too badly.  This was very good and is going in the rotation.  Thank you for sharing.

Although I had read all the rave reviews, I was still surprised this was so good. The meatloaf was very moist and flavorful and went wonderfully with roasted new potatoes. I would however, suggest that everyone take heed use and one of the alternate methods to "pinwheeling" the meat around the cheese as described in the recipe. I thought I had been successful in rolling the meat around the cheese, till about 1/3 of the cheese bailed. I followed the recipe faithfully, except in the cheeseburger tradition added mustard and ketchup as a glaze. BTW: It really might be nice to mix this recipe with CaraMeg's Dill Pickle Meatloaf, which is also very good. Thanks for sharing, Douglass.

I made this tonight for dinner.  IT'S AWESOME.  I am the only female in the house and my boys and hubby can get fussy.  The kids really enjoyed it so I know hubby will when he gets home from work.  I did make a few small changes and they worked out.  I didn't have ant bread crumbs, so I used 3/4 cup Dare Vinta Crackers crush up.  Instead of fresh onion, I used 1 package of Lipton Roasted Garlic Soup Mix.  I actually forgot to put in the pepper and only used one egg.  I used Kraft Tex Mex Shredded Cheese instead of just plain cheddar cheese.   I greased a loaf pan took half of the ground beef mixture on the bottom making a slight well all the way around.  Placed cheese on that layer, then covered the cheese layer with remaining ground beef and pressed it down firmly in order for all the sides to seal.  Covered it with foil and baked as indicated.  With this recipe you could do so many different things  Thank you for posting it.

You're right, it tastes like a big 'ol cheeseburger. I topped it off with some Stubbs BBQ sauce. Delicious and easy. I used the lasagna/stacking method instead of the roll-up method.

Added a little Montreal steak seasoning, Did not roll it up. I put 1/2 in the loaf pan made a well, added cheese and topped it with the rest of the meat. Everyone liked it. Son-in-law said it needed bacon. Cooked crumbled bacon added on top near the end of cooking or even layered with the cheese might be a good option.

Excellent!  Even my 3 and 5 year old picky kids wanted seconds.  I made a few changes though combining this recipe and one I was given from a relative.  I mixed 1/2 cup ketchup, the eggs, seasoned bread crumbs, 1/4 cup minced onion, some onion salt and pepper together before adding the ground beef.  I sprayed foil with non-stick spray and flattened the meat out over it.  I spread 1/4-1/2 cup ketchup over the meat and I did not have shredded cheese so I used 4 slices of American and placed it over the meat.  I used the foil to help roll the meat up (rolling from the long side).  I then transferred the roll and the foil to a jelly roll pan (easier cleanup!).  After cooking for 50-60 minutes I used 3 more slices of cheese (cut diagonally) and layed them on top and put it back in the oven for 5-7 more minutes.  (The American cheese part was from the other recipe I had.  I would like to try the shredded cheese part but I really liked the American Cheese melted on top.  Gave a nice presentation and tasted great!)
***UPDATE: The second time I made this I tried it with the shredded cheese (2-3 cups) on the inside and it was much better than the sliced cheese.  I still used the slices on top for presentation purposes and this was a huge hit with everyone!

Made it as directed and it was incredible.  I did make one small change.  I layered the pan with bacon and wrapped the outside of the loaf with it completely.  Added 10 minutes to baking time and once cooked completely, removed from pan immediately to get it out of the bacon grease.  I go rave reviews for my bacon cheeseburger meatloaf!!!

The guys in the family said that this is "the bomb!" I did make some changes. This is what I did: 2lbs ground beef, 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 2 cups shredded cheese, the salt & pepper and added 1 tsp garlic powder. I mixed it all together and put it in an 8x8 loaf pan lined with foil. I also topped it with sliced bacon. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. It was very good!

This is an awesome meatloaf - and this is from someone that HATES meatloaf!  I love that the recipe is so flexible.  Have made it several different ways - loaded bacon cheeseburger, mushroom and swiss, pepperjack ranch, just to name a few.  Thanks for a great recipe that my whole family enjoys!

Good old fashioned comfort food!  I used a very lean ground beef, and jazzed it up a bit with Worcestershire sauce, A1 Steak sauce, and garlic powder.  I stuffed it with sauteed onions and mushrooms, and topped it with some crispy bacon.  It tasted just like a bacon, mushroom, cheeseburger!

If you had trouble rolling your meat into a loaf shape, pat out your hamburger on a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, then simply lift one end and roll up the meat and cheese, it won't stick to the paper or wrap and it is easy to handle.

A great recipe, especially if you have kids to feed, and will make again. I did tweak it a little. I added another cup of cheese, especially at the ends since they were pretty dry the first time, green peppers instead of onions and cut back on the salt to 1/2 a tsp.

I tried this recipe, I found it OK , but way too peppery! I used some advice I read in the reviews. I cut way back on the salt, and sandwiched the cheese between the halved mixture ( making a channel to put the cheese in in the bottom half). Oh, and I also added 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, per a reviewers' suggestion . Mine was a little dry! But I used extra lean ground beef.
I think I'll try it again with much less pepper, and perhaps some garlic powder instead.

This on the regular rotation at our house. I use swiss cheese and mushrooms in the middle. Instead of doing all this extra work, just lay out a piece of parchment paper. Flatten your meat out leaving the edges a bit higher. Add your toppings in the middle and roll up, pulling paper back as you go. Pinch ends, put in meatloaf pan. I usually leave mine in for 90minutes at 350, then let sit for 15 or 20 so its not lava hot... Comes out perfect every time.

I make mine very similar to this, my family prefers their meatloaf cheesy. I solve the grease problem with a very nifty meatloaf pan with a raised bottom to hold it above the grease while it's cooking. Makes getting it out of the pan easy too. (I had to buy two, one loaf is never enough!)

Made this with mushrooms and swiss cheese in the middle instead of just chedder cheese. Also add 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce. Made a ketchup and dijon mustard glaze for the top. Added it last 10 mins of cooking. Also didn't even try to roll it...baked in casserole dish. Very good...will make again.

I made this as written but with Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage instead of ground beef. It was pretty tasty and my kids loved the oozy gooey cheese in the middle. I did use the jelly roll method and had no issues making the loaf. Now cutting it was a different story. Even after allowing to sit for 15 minutes or so the cheese still oozed when cut. Especially the center of the loaf. It was greasy but I think that is to be expected with sausage.

For the simple ease of preparation, I halved the cheese and mixed it right into the meat. I always make meatloaf in a lightly greased 9x5 loaf pan as well. Seemed like it'd be too bland for our tastes, so I did add extra seasonings into the meat (garlic & onion powders, steak seasoning, worchestershire sauce and a handful of bacon bits and crushed french fried onions). My oven runs hot, so an hour was a little too long and produced a drier meatloaf than I prefer. Next time, 45 minutes will be sufficient. DH liked it better than my usual meatloaf (Brown Sugar Meatloaf, from AR). I brushed a mixture of ketchup, mustard and bbq sauce on top the last 1/2 hour of baking. Served with mashed potatoes and peas, it was a tasty Sunday night dinner.

Delicious – I only gave 4 stars because I made a few changes. I added 1 glove fresh minced garlic and some steak spice and added a ¼ cup shredded cheese to the beef mixture.
I used a banana bread pan sprayed with cooking spray and put ¾’s of the beef mixture in it, then smushed it around to create a “canoe” I then added the cheese and used the rest of the beef mixture on the top and pressed the sides together to seal in the cheese. With my changes I definatelt give this 5 stars!

Meatloaf is not one of my favorite things, but this was great! Nice flavor. I added 1 T worcestershire sauce to the beef, and mixed ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard for a topping.

I've made this one by mixing chopped onion, green relish, mustard, ketchup and cheese and it was always a hit even for those that don't normally put some of the ingredients on their burgers.  Very moist and pleasing to look at.

Awesome meatloaf. I used half ground pork and half ground beef. Left out the onion and added in a few tablespoons of worchestire. I used a little over a cup of cheddar and then put two slices of swiss on top. I topped the loaf with ketchup. I didn't have a problem rolling up. Looked and tasted great.

This was very easy and tasty!  Tasted like meatloaf but better somehow!  The only thing I did was add a little touch of Worcestershire sauce to the mix when I was mixing up all the ingredients.  Hubby said 5 stars.

Husband did not like the "cheese tunnel". Added Worcestershire to the mix and used very lean ground beef. Thought overall was good, will make again, but add the cheese to the meat mix.

awesome... instead of rolling the cheez in, i put half the mixture in the loaf pan, made a well, put cheeze in it then topped it off... also, bacon strips on the top of the loaf added extra flavor. 
the last 15 min, i put the ketchup topping!

This was good but nothing special.  A little bland actually, and I even added a little Worcestershire.  I did halve the recipe and that worked well.  I'm still searching for a meatloaf recipe that pleases my DH as much as his moms.

It was OK. Because cheddar is greasy, I will definitely reduce the amount of cheese by about half if I make this again. Also, it's oddly bland. Something is missing, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Great idea, just needs some tweaking.

This was good, although strangely enough I found it was lacking flavor. Maybe I didn't put enough of something in. Still good, may have to try again.

It was so easy! I am teaching my sons' to cook and this recipe was perfect for a beginner and the whole family loved it...the only down side was the grease. Using a leaner hamburger would reduce that but it still was yummy and there were no leftovers! I serious plus!

Loved this! I used ground sirloin and there was still quite a bit of grease I'm assuming from the cheese. Did not roll up jelly roll style put instead put 1/2 the beef down made a well in the middle and added the cheese (colby jack because that's what I had). Delicious may be the only recipe I ever use for meatloaf. Thanks!

Yummy. I added chopped up peppers, onions and mushroom so I could get my veggies serving. However, it made it spicy which I enjoyed but my husband not so much. Instead of rolling I put a layer meat mix on the bottom of the pan, then a layer of cheese, the the rest of the meat mix. Easier this way.

I think this is great and so did all of my family.  I do however, think that it could do just as well with just 2 cups of cheese because it was super cheesy.  Great taste.

I have made something like this but without bread crumbs or eggs, and I've patted it out like COOKINGMUM has. Just rereading your recipe makes me want to make it again.

My mom has made her meatloaf like this for the past 40 years.  Only difference is that she uses American cheese instead of shredded cheddar.  Melts and tastes better to me.

I wasn't crazy about the overloaded taste of minced onion.  I definitely would not use 1/2 cup again.

Just tried this tonight and really liked it!  I meant to cook this meal but got a little carried away with shopping so my boyfriend cooked it for us.  He substituted low fat mozarella instead of the cheddar.  It was still really good.  I got home just in time to put a little ketchup on top.  Everything else was as the recipe was written.  He said he really liked it and it was easy to make.  I also enjoyed it, and it is so easy to modify.  Next time we may use cheddar or swiss with mushrooms.  We're keeping this recipe, thank you for it!

Thought this was a delicious recipe.  I changed it a little.  I divided the meat in half, pressed one half down in the pan, covered that with 2 cups of reduced fat cheese blend and ketchup, then pressed the remaining meat mixture over that.  Cooked for an hour and while it was cooling, I spread more ketchup on the top.  It was delicious!  I think the recipe as posted turns out a little bland, that's why I added the ketchup.

For starters I halved the recipe, which worked well other than it was still a lot of cheese.  Then I followed another reviewers suggestion of layering the meat and cheese instead of rolling it.  Since I was doing half a recipe I used a glass 8x8 dish, put half the meat down, then the cheese, then the rest of the meat. I topped it with a mixture of ketcup, musturd and worchestershire sauce.   My bake time was more like 40 minutes since it was a smaller portion.  This was a good variation on standard meatloaf!

Yum!! My family loved this recipe. I followed the suggestion to layer meat/cheese/meat/cheese/meat and drizzled the top with ketchup before baking. I substituted 1 cap full of Tastefully Simple© Onion Onion in place of the diced onion and reduced the cheese to 2 c. I also poured off the grease and let the meatloaf sit for 15 minutes before slicing.

I thought this was a fun twist to the typical meatloaf recipe, but gave it 4 stars since I had to come up a creative rolling technique and also thought the recipe could use a cheese sauce to top it since most of the cheese oozed out regardless that I sealed it well.  My brilliant rolling technique is to use an asian bamboo sushi wrap to roll it up.  It worked really well!  Be sure to cover the entire bamboo with syran wrap so you don't ruin your bamboo before rolling.  Spread the beefmix on the entire bamboo area, flat and even.  Spread the cheese on top and roll. Enclose the ends when finished rolling. To drain, I put a cooling rack over a serving platter and covered it to keep it warm before cutting.  Next time I will make this with mozzarella cheese, ground turkey, rosemary, and italian sausage & spices served with pasta and tomato sauce.  There are many ways this recipe can be modified, but the basic concept is a great idea! Thanks for sharing...

WOW O WOW!!!!!  This was crazy good! I followed the recipe to a T. To ease the stuffing of the cheese, I too layered it like a lasagna.  Beef mix, cheese, beefmix, cheese, beef mix.  Make sure the sides are all pinched together. I topped mine with ketchup and BBQ sauce before putting it in the oven. MY FAV meatloaf by far!

This turned out really well, and it was very tasty. I followed the recipe as written, except I topped the meatloaf with ketchup before baking, which really was a finishing touch to the "cheeseburger" flavor. I didn't have any problems rolling this up, I used a sheet of waxed paper in a sided cookie sheet, and firmly pressed the meat mixture into the pan. I then added the cheese and it rolled up perfectly, and edges sealed nicely too! Be sure to let this rest for about 15-20 minutes while covered before cutting, or the cheese will all spill out. Sliced dill pickles is a nice little garnish for this, because it really does taste like acheeseburger! Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will use again (:

Fan-fugu-tastic!

This tastes EXACTLY like a cheeseburger - without all the hassle of the grill.

I even added a dash of Liquid Smoke to make it even MORE "authentic"!

This one will DEFINITELY go into the regular rotation ;);)

This is great!  I add sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Overload it, it makes it taste even better.  Just make sure you place it on parchment paper in a shallow baking pan to avoid mess.  Soaking the grease off of it by placing it on about 6 pieces of bread per another reviewer, and it's fantastic.  Served with whipped mashed potatoes from this site.

When I finally decided to make this dish. I didn't have much time. So instead of making a 'roll' out of the meat, I just put half the meat into my loaf pan, added the cheese on top, then uased the rest of the meat on top. My husband ate nearly the whole pan by himself!!

This recipe is one of the best that I've tried. I've made my meatloaf for years out of ground beef (85lean-15fat), ground veal and ground pork...pretty much equal parts of each, and that was not changed.The only changes I made to this recipe was to use Quaker Oats instead of bread crumbs and used colby-jack cheese, because that's what I had on hand. And I made a glaze which I topped the meatloaf out of ketchup,mustard, brown sugar and steak sauce. This meatloaf came out very juicy and flavorfull. I'll make this again.....

I rolled this up with the Cheddar cheese, added bacon pieces, and topped it with Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  Really, really good and a very nice change from boring old everyday meatloaf.  I served it with extra BBQ sauce, onion rings, and steamed broccoli.  There isn't a single piece left over!

I reduced the amount of cheese to about a cup of shredded cheddar jack and added a couple of slices of american cheese.  I also used Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt instead of regular salt and added a dash of garlic powder. I swapped out crushed crackers for the bread crumbs.  I used one of Paula Deen's tricks to soak up the grease: You place the rolled up loaf on a few slices of bread.  Like some of the others, I thought it needed a glaze and used my mother's old stand-by: Heinz ketchup.  It did need a touch more than the 1 hour baking time, though.  Would make this one again, though.

This was very easy to make.  I made individual loaves and instead of rolling, I made a "well" down the middle of a loaf, added the shredded cheese, then covered with more beef mixture.  It turned out somewhat greasy with all the fat, but not too worry -- I just placed them on a wire rack over some napkins to drain off the excess grease.  Overall it tasted, well...like a cheeseburger!  Thanks for sharing!

What an easy to make meatloaf.  I hate cooking so I'm always looking for something really quick and really simple.  I have a tip for those who thought it was too messy and it wouldn't roll i rolled the meat with the wax paper, it kept it together nicely as i rolled i pulled the wax paper away.  To put it into the loaf pan i picked up the roll with the wax paper and rolled it in.  It worked perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh!!  My husband whose the meat eater not me, loved it!

This was a great wonderful yummy recipe. My 4yo finally ate my meatloaf and meat. This is defintely a keeper in our family everyone that can rate which is 5 out of 6 of us rated it a star. It was so good there were no leftovers. If you have a big family though like we do you might want to use 2lbs or more of meat though. :-)

This recipe is great! I've always thought my meatloaf was a little "boring", who would have thought to add cheese?! I have a 6 yr old and 2 yr old with plain taste buds and they both love this. The whole family loves it, friends are forever asking me for this recipe. Quick to prepare and great tasting!

So good! I added Worcestershire and used Montreal steak spice instead of salt and pepper, and added chopped peppers and mushrooms. I also split it in half and made a little boat to put the cheese in, then formed the other half on top instead of rolling.

Not a fan of meatloaf and neither is my boyfriend but we decided to try it. I put it in a casserole dish and made it more like a lasagna (layered) instead. My boyfriend absolutely loved it! Used rice instead of bread crumbs and it was awesome.

I made this recipe with 1lb of ground beef. I used parchment paper to roll it up like sushi. It came out great. Very tasty and delicious. Easy to make.

I love this meatloaf!  I did layer it like lasagna and also added cooked chopped bacon to make bacon cheese burger meatloaf.   I also coat the top of the meatloaf with ketchup prior to cooking.

I love this recipe, I've made a few tweaks and it's even better. I add Worcester (sp?) Sauce to the mix and I mix the cheese into the meat loaf. I found the cheese in the middle to be just a blog of hot mess. But mixing it still brought in the wonderful cheese favor and the cheese mixed in it keeps the meat moist. I also use the (as seen on TV) meatloaf pan and it helps separate the grease. Which made it a but better on my stomach. My picky kids ask for this often.

Loved this recipe. I made one small addition to it since my girlfriend and I love bacon cheeseburgers. after I spread the cheese on the meat I put strips of bacon across the cheese to make bacon cheeseburger meatloaf.

I substituted oats instead of bread crumbs. I added one egg instead of two and added about 1/2 cup of honey barbque sauce to the meat mixture. I didn't roll this out either but made a little "dip" in the middle as suggested by another review and filled with shredded chedder. Topped with ketchup during last 10 min of cooking. Family loved it! Will make again.

It was nice and filling but the cheese sort of melted into the meat and it wasn't very cheesy. It was flavorful but not as cheesy as expected. What I would change is maybe use more cheese the next time, but other than that, it was good.

Made this exactly as directed, only I used the tricks about the rolling (covered a large sheet pan with parchment paper, laying out the meat mixture, pressing down, adding the cheese, and then rolling).  I still had a little bit of cheese loss, but this was AMAZING.  Such a great recipe!  Certainly not one to feed the kids more than once every few months, but a treat, nonetheless!

Told the boyfriend that I was making meatloaf, and the epitome of picky eaters replied "I don't like meatloaf, it's gross". Something I hear nearly daily. I made this and topped it with a mixture of ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar, (and smothered my own in ketchup), and he asked for seconds! Juicy and delicious!

I give only 4 stars because I didn't like to cheese and the rolling, and I found the cook time to be inaccurate. The cheese ended up just kind of melting out and creating a layer of cheesy liquid in the bottom of the pan. I will not be adding the cheese part in the future.

As for cook time, one hour and it was still pink in the middle. Did 1.5 hours and it was perfect!

I also made a basting sauce with olive oil, white wine vinegar, ketchup, spicy mustard, juice from bottled hot peppers, onion, garlic, and S&P.
brushed the mix on the meat before adding the cheese, then when it is taken out to rest, brush more on! it was awesome!!

Very very good, and really seems decadent!  Like previous reviewers, I made it non-jelly-roll style.  I found it a little challenging to come up with two layers of meat out of the two pounds, so i might go for 2-1/2 lbs next time.

Was a huge hit. Definitely will be making this again! It was a bit "easier" then other stuffed meatloafs we have tried. I added a packet of french onion soup mix & it was excellent.

Now my family wants me to get rid of my old recipe!  They've already suggested 2 modifications for different kinds of cheeseburgers.  It was a bit difficult to keep the beef together-it kept wanting to break open.

Everyone seemed to like this meatloaf. I did not have any problems making the meatloaf into a jelly roll. On the other hand, I did have a problem with the cheese finding its way out of the meatloaf even though I sealed it as best as possible. Served with PW's Crash Hot Potatoes and Bacon Wrapped Green Beans.

I honestly have to say that this was a hit for all my picky eaters in this house (that's everyone, but me) and I will come back to this when we get our yearly deer and see how it turns-out with ground venison. Wurd!

VERY good!!  I followed the advice to wrap it in bacon and add mushrooms, then smothered the top with Sweet Baby Ray bbq sauce during the last 30 minutes.  I didn't have lean ground beef, so I sucked out the grease about every 20 min during cook time, but that wasn't a big deal.  I think this one is a keeper!

In the past i used The 'Rempel Family Meatloaf' Recipe off this site and it is a very good recipe, but i wanted to try something a little different. When this recipe was sent in a daily email i receive from allrecipes.com, i decided to try it because i love cheese and it had great reviews. Boy am i happy i gave this recipe a chance...i did not change a thing and baked it for the specified time and this turned out to be soooo good with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans as sides...this will definitely replace all meatloaf recipes from the past and be made at least twice a month!!! Go ahead and try it, you won't be disappointed!!! I will add that i have NEVER  really liked meatloaf but my family does so that alone should tell you A LOT!!!

Disappointed after all the high reviews. I will stick with the ever favorite Brown Sugar Meatloaf that is always a hit.

Very good recipe. I did not roll it, but trenched and layered as others suggested. I only used 2c. cheese and it was very cheesy. I left out the breadcrumbs to make it very low carb. Worked great!

This was pretty good.  I made this thinking it would be something my 8 and 6 yr old boys would devour as I don't cook much using ground beef and they do love burgers!  The 8 yr old didn't love it and the 6 yr old ended up sick so didn't eat dinner!  I hadn't added much spice to it except for what the recipe called for as my one son does not like anything remotely 'spiced', used lean ground beef and toasted (dried) onion.  Scaled the recipe down to 1/2 pound.  Wasn't too fond of the jelly roll style, a bit finicky to work with, but love the concept of the 'hidden' cheese!  Thanks for the twist, great recipe concept!

It was just ok to me. The jelly role thing did not work out. It split on the top while cooking. The flavor was pretty good but but I felt like it could have been better.

This was delicious!!! Husband says we have to have it again! I'm going to try different prep methods. The only thing we did different was we added a packet of Ranch dressing mix as we do to our hamburgers and it turned out incredible!!!

very good. I added a bit of worchestershire sauce just because I like it in beef dishes. Next time I think I will add some fried crumbled bacon to make Bacon cheeseburger meatloaf! My husband really liked it too. thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Loved this recipe! It's quick and easy to make, and my family of guys loved it too! I substituted the minced onion with onion soup mix and spread some Diana BBQ sauce on top. Served it with hashbrown casserole (another family favorite). Nice meal!

This was very good, altho mine did split open on top & the cheese started to ooze out. Very simple to make. I topped it with a double dose of the topping from "Dill Pickle Meatloaf" on AR. Loved it!!

I followed the directions but added 1 minced clove of garlic and 1/2 t. salt. I did 3 layers of cheese to evenly distribute it. I also added a topping sauce that I've always used: bbq sauce, ketchup, & honey mustard. Placed 2 slices of bread on the bottom then foil on top then placed the meatloaf on top the foil to soak up the grease. It tasted good, but it was lacking some more spices. I'd probably make my regular meatloaf and layer the cheese again.

This version of meatloaf was a nice change from my usual.  I did switch it up a bit by making it into "muffins" - I made small patties and sandwiched the cheese between two patties and shaped it into a large meatball.  I then baked them in a well-greased muffin tin.  They got kind of oozy, but it made for a nice crust on each.  Thanks for another decent meatloaf recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  I had to use what I had on hand. I used ground buffalo and ground lamb. Vermont white cheddar, sharp cheddar and mozzarella.   Threw in teaspoon of Italian herb blend. Spread meat onto wax paper, placed cheese down the middle and it was a snap to roll up. Sealed ends well and placed bacon over roll.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Family loved it!! Used heavy duty foil to roll it up and didn't have any trouble at all.  The foil is heavier than wax paper and keeps it in place.

Quick, easy and delicious! I read the reviews and used parchment paper which made the rolling process quite easy. I also cooked the meatloaf covered surrounded by carrots. Turned out great. I will be making this again...

Very good!  I added garlic powder, worchesershire, steak seasoning, and a little BBQ sauce to the meat.  It was very easy to roll up the cheese.... although I thought I did a good job sealing the edges of the meatloaf and still SO much cheese was oozing out of it when it was done.   I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again.

Very good flavor!  I took advice from others and layered the meat and cheese.  However, I didn't "seal" in the cheese and I should have.  Will definitely make this again, but will use half the meat and make a wide channel down the middle, add the cheese and then top with the other half of the meat and "seal" the edges so that the cheese stays in.  The only reason I did not give this five stars was, I can't imagine having to "roll" this meat loaf.

I made a profile just to put in my two cents. This recipe is a perfect balance of beef, bread, onion and egg. The cheese is just bonus. I didn't use nearly as much cheese as the recipe called for...3 cups is a whole package of shredded cheese, which looks like WAY too much cheese when the ingredients are all sitting on the counter.  That being said, one weekend I think I might try the "jelly roll" technique and 3 cups of cheddar just to see...

I've made this several times. Once you get the trick of rolling this up and keeping all the cheese inside, you get a really nice meatloaf.

This meat loaf was very good. I will be making it again. My husband also liked it. I did add some whorshire sauce to this and it add so much great flavor to it. I would just add it to your taste. I did not roll this as I did not have the time I just divided the burger and made a tunnel down the center and then put the other half on top making sure the sides and ends were sealed and it came out great. Yummy! Thanks.

Husband said this was "ok" - more of a novelty idea I think. I think this would be great with kids who like cheeseburgers, but for adults there are probably better recipes out there. I couldn't get the cheese to stay inside (like so many others), but I think it turned out ok.

I was a bit disapointed, but it was edible. It seemed really greasy and bland. I doubt I will try this recipe again, thanks for posting.

Wow! I used 95% lean beef and habanero cheese for a real crowd pleaser. I think it wouldn't have been nearly as good had I used a cheese that wasn't so spicy. Had I used hamburger with a higher fat content I think it would have been waaaaay to greasy. Thanks for a GREAT recipe, this will be something I fix monthly (we try not to eat too much red meat)

I thought this dish was fantastic...as did my family. I would cut back on the salt next time though.  Instead of rolling it, I put it in a loaf pan and made "troughs" for the cheese (about three of them). No cheese drips. and i smothered the top with a mixture of ketchup and A1 sauce with about a teaspoon of worchestershire. FANTASTIC!!!!

Hmm, it was good and like I've been told by a family member, 'It's different' and I did do some things different than the recipe, I added fiesta cheese in stead, and I put bacon on top. But for it to be a truly cheeseburger meatloaf, a person should add tomato of type,like a diced tomato and maybe a few other things, this is a good recipe, I'm just not the meatloaf type.

This was easy to make and my family liked it (except for my younger daughter who informed me after dinner that she doesn't like any meatloaf!). Some of the cheese leaked out, but there was still a layer in the middle. Used 12 grain bread for the breadcrumbs, because that's what we had and the recipe didn't specify. Thanks!

Of the two meatloaf recipes I regularily make, this is my favorite because it reminds me of being a little girl and eating my moms'. I season exactly as specified: using only the onions, salt, and pepper keep this traditional and delicious. My other recipe has a fancy sauce and lots more seasonings for when I'm feeling adventerous. The cheese part isn't traditional but my love for cheese got the best of me and I think the pairing is perfect. I do take the time to pat it out and roll, I make it just wide enough to fit in a loaf pan which keeps the cheese (mostly) in check. I find I need 95% lean beef in meatloaf recipes to not get a greasy mess, this one is no exception. Thanks very much for sharing :)

I'm giving this recipe 4 1/2 stars because of how easy and delicious it was. It was a very good meatloaf and I just threw it together, following all the ingredients including fresh breadcrumbs and didn't roll the meat, but just put in a layer of meat, then cheese, repeat until a meat layer is on top. I spread some tomato and worcestershire mixed over the top and it was incredibly yummy. Reminds me of a veal and cheese I used to eat as a kid. Well worth keeping, thankyou.

I loved this meatloaf.  The cheese oozing out was such a good taste.  Used a sharp cheddar cheese. Also, I sprayed the wax paper with cooking spray before putting meat on it.  Then worked quickly and rolled the meatloaf up, lifting the waxpaper to roll the meat as I went, instead of trying to roll the meat by itself.

This was a good recipe... i think the conversion from 8 to 4 servings is a bit off though as it asked for only 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs...which wouldn't be 1/2 of the original amount. I added more breadcrumbs and only put in 1 cup of cheese instead of the 1 1/2... and it was still a bit too cheesy. I think it would still be just as good with even less cheese.

This was GREAT!  I actually just mixed the shredded cheese into the meat mixture.  It was really good...there was cheese all thru-out!  I also put BBQ sauce all over the top.  This was an amazingly easy, yummy dinner!  Thanks!!!

This is an excellent recipe that leaves you with the ability to change as you please to suit your family's tastes.

Last time I made it I used american cheese slices and mostly cooked bacon during the rolling process, and I finely chopped mushrooms and added them to the beef mixture. Delicious!

Also, adding worcestershire, garlic poweder and/or BBQ sauce to the mixture before rolling is also recommended.

Great base recipe. thanks!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I tweek it everytime I make it. I currently fry up about 1/2 an onion and some bacon and mix that in with the meat.  I also put a ketchup/mustard mixture on top before going in the oven.  I wasn't a big fan of meatloaf before I found this recipe, now I make it once every couple of weeks!

This was pretty good. I added a bit of worcestshire sauce as suggested by another user. I served with spaghetti sauce on top (no ketchup in the house). I will probably make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe, and my husband loved it too. My mom used to make something similar to this when I was little. The only problem I had was keeping the cheese contained within the loaf. It oozed out while it was baking...other than that FANTASTIC! Thanks for a great recipe Doug!

Husband loved this dish! I used american cheese slices down the middle, mixed mustard and ketchup together and spread on top. Cheese only oozed out after I cut it. Added extra diced onions on my slice and it tasted just like a cheeseburger! Thanks for a keeper!

I make this a lot because my family loves it. I did make a change though... Instead of putting the cheese in jellyroll style, I just mix in shredded cheese of any kind  with the meat. To help with the grease problem, I place the loaf on oven broiling pan and the excess grease drips off.

This was the first time in my meatloaf history that there weren't any leftovers to enjoy the next day for lunch! As I always do, I used ground turkey and Douglas, I took your advice and stuffed the meatloaf with sauteed mushooms, shredded swiss and also added onions and crumbled cooked bacon. I glazed the top with barbeque sauce along with a couple of strips of bacon. My kids flipped over this and my younger daughter said that this was the best meatloaf I've ever made. Thanks Douglas!

This recipe is excellent and easy.  It is the only type of meatloaf I make anymore.  The oils from the cheese soak into the meat while it is baking and keeps the meat very moist.

I thought this was very good.  It does have a lot of grease that comes off of it, but that's good because then you aren't eating it!  Also, make sure you roll it tight because if not, the cheese will seep out.  Mine did, but even so it was good and would definitely make again!

I'd have to say that this is a good start to jazzing up an old style recipe but I feel that there's room for play.  Season to taste.  I added some Worcestershire and barbecue sauce as recommended by previous reviewers and found this helpful with adding flavor.

I have to admit that I don't normally care for "meatloaf".  Meatloaf normally refers to a dry, cardboard tasting slab that is topped with baked ketchup.  Yeck!  This recipe, however, makes a marvelous dish that I am proud to serve to even the pickiest members of my family.  If you're lucky enough to have leftovers the next day, you'll find that a slice of this meatloaf makes for a wonderful sandwich.

Too greasy and not enough flavor.  Even my cheese and grease-loving husband did not like it and would not eat the leftovers.

I've made this a few times now.  We all really enjoy it, even the picky two and four year olds.  Never have figured out how to keep the cheese in it, but I just scoop the stuff that oozes out and spread it on top of the meatloaf when it's done.

The recipe is a good idea, but needs a bit of improvement, as it came out quite bland.  The cheese in the middle did make it moist, but also much greasier.  Next time, rather than using all ground beef, I'll replace 1/2 of it with sausage.  More seasonings should help out too.

I made this recipe this week for my family and it was the best meatloaf I have ever made!  It was very moist and cheesy.  My 21 month old really liked it too!  I will definitely make this again!

Sensational! I will make this again, and again. You should know that wether you roll it up or mix it into the meat, the cheese will seperate from the meat in cooking. It's the natural oils in the cheese that cause this. I top the meatloaf with ketchup at the start of cooking. I lay 3 slices of American cheese over the top about 15 minutes before it's done cooking. It really jazzes up the presentaton. Loved it! My whole family loves it!

This was absolutely the best ever meat loaf recipe!  I added some liquid smoke flavor and used Jack cheese and my family devoured it!!  My folks came to town and I shared the recipe with them, now they are making it as well.  I can't say thank you enough!

Wow!! This recipe is the greatest!! Not only did my finiky eater just love this Meat Loaf, My husband who said if I ever made him a meatloaf for dinner he would divorce me, wanted seconds that night at dinner, asked if i would make that beef "roll" again tomorrow!!  The second meatloaf I made the next night, I substituted 1 1/2 cups(or 1-12oz package) of American Cheese for the Sharp Cheese the recipe calls for, and my family just loved it!!  We eat this Meat Loaf 3 times during the week and sometimes on the weekend!!! It's definetly a must try recipe!!!

Delicious!  We loved it!  Will definitely make again.  I halved the recipe and had great results.  Here's a tip though, if you had problems rolling it up:  use the wax paper (or foil) to help you roll it.  Roll the paper forward, sealing any "breaks" in the loaf and pull the paper back each time until completely rolled. I am sure this was the intention for using wax paper.  It's really easy this way.  I love the little pinwheels I got when I cut into it.  Great for kids of all ages. (:

This is a delicious meatloaf.  My kid (who only likes one ingredient, no lumps, no wierd stuff dishes) asked for seconds!  My husband (who generally hates meatloaf) had thirds!  The jellyroll technique takes a little practice, but is fun to do and not a big deal if imperfect.  I have made three at a time and frozen the extra cooked loaves with excellent results.

I have made this 3 times now and it looks like it is one of those "don't loose that" recipes! Nothing I make from a recipe ever get done exactly the same way and this meat loaf is the same, however I did stick closer to this than I do most!

We loved this recipe.  I did make some changes.  I used a package of onion soup mix instead of an onion, used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and added about 3/4 cup of salsa.  We loved the cheese in the middle.  We will be making it again!

yes I changed to pink Himalayan salt and added 1 cup low sodium v-8 juice and I shredded my own sharp cheddar cheese. I will make it again.  I am making again right now so when it comes out of the oven I will make a photo of it.

Very good!  I made a deep "well" in the middle instead of rolling and it turned out great.  I made sure the sides we closed tightly.   I have a meatloaf pan so all the meat grease went to the bottom so no issues.  Only adjustments I used onion powder because I didn't have onions.  Put some Worcestershire sauce over the top before baking.   Hubby loved it, will make again.

My husband and I loved this!  He typically doesn't like meatloaf but already requested that I make this again.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger!  I halved the recipe since it is only the 2 of us.  I really didn't have a problem rolling it, and only a small amount of cheese oozed out at the end.  I do suggest waiting about 10 or 15 minutes to cut it.  The only thing I did differently was add a little garlic powder to the meat and cut the salt...it seemed like way too much.  I typically like the ketchup and brown sugar glaze on top, but since cheeseburgers don't typically have a sweet sauce, I used plain old ketchup lol.

Followed the advice of others and made a "glaze". 1/4 C each yellow mustard and brown sugar and 1/2 C ketchup. Mixed and poured on top before cooking.  I served with dill pickle slices and tater tots!

This is an excellent 'starter' recipe, as there are any number of variations that can be done from the building block provided.  It is simple and easy, but as is, basic and really only tastes of cooked meat.  I made it again using 1 pound beef and 1 pound pork, a mix of Velveeta and sharp cheddar, and glazed with a 50/50 mix of ketchup and honey barbeque sauce.  I then served it with a heaping helping of caramelized onions.  My family raved it was the best ever.  So I'll rate it 5 stars as an excellent starting point that leaves it very open to modification.  Great job!

Updated Aug 17 - nearly a year from original review:  I have made this several times now and it continues to be a hit.  I have mixed lean beef with ground turkey, ground sausage etc.  I have tried different cheeses, adding our favorite BBQ sauce, using a little bacon etc, etc.  I think the key is to not overwork it and to layit out on parchment and use that to "roll up".                                     
                               
              
Original review Oct 16:Delicious!  I followed basic instructions but sauteed mushroom and onions as part of the "filling" and reduced the cheese a bit.  I forgot to put anything on top and it was still wonderful.  Will make it again and try different flavor combinations.

I pressed the meat mixture out on a piece of baking parchment paper.  That paper helped me as I rolled it up and it was quite easy and stayed pretty firm.  Mine didn't slice as nicely as the photo but that is probably because we didn't let it cool for 15 minutes.  

Served with roasted vegetables and made a great dinner.

My husband LOVES meatloaf...and the whole family is burned out on the brown sugar meatloaf recipe.  Great recipe, but needed a change.  This nailed it...delicious!!  A very picky 4 year old, a 5 year old, and my husband all wolfed it down.  And, I followed suit.  I didn't change anything (on purpose) but had added about 1 tbsp. of Worcestershire before I realized it actually did not call for it.  The only thing I did do different was place regular sliced bread in the bottom of the pan, then placed the meatloaf roll on foil that had small pricks to help drain the grease away from the loaf.  A suggestion from a review & it worked great.  After spreading the cheese, it rolled surprisingly easy, but only pulled away small lengths from the wax paper.  It seemed to roll tighter & had less holes to allow cheese to escape.  I saved 2 small meatball sized pieces of that mixture to help seal the ends.  Getting the 4 people in my house to all actually like a dish is rare.  Thank you Douglas!!  You just gave my family a new favorite meatloaf recipe (and to be honest, I thought I would never say that sentence in my life!)

This was really good! I made mine in a loaf pan and just made a space in the middle for the cheese. I used Havarti and then topped the loaf with ketchup and bacon. I baked half an hour covered and then the other half uncovered to let the bacon brown up. I also drained grease out twice while it was cooking. Came out delish, will make this one again!

I read a lot of reviews complaining about the jelly roll style. If you use one hand to pull up the wax paper and the other hand keeping the meat in place it roles just fine. We used sliced American cheese inside (split in half) and topped it with a light sprinkle of shredded Colby Jack while it rested. Our family of 6 loved it!

Great! I used 97% lean beef; if using lower I'd recommend putting a piece of bread under to soak up the grease. 

I halved the recipe and used about 10 tiny pickle slices inside with the cheese and it was delicious! Put ketchup on the side for the full experience :)

Made it as is except I only added 2 cups of cheese. 3 seemed way too much. 2 was even too much. Not too much flavor either.

I used oatmeal as a substitute for the breadcrumbs and it tasted awesome! Didn't have that meatloaf flavor. There was not much left. My kids actually ate it, even the one who said she didn't like meatloaf.

It is very simple to mix & the only thing extra I added was 3/4 cups green bell pepper.

Made per directions, other than using fresh minced onion--which I saute browned in melted butter, along w/ a whisper of minced garlic. Good measure of eggs to bread crumbs--and patience makes the "jellyroll effect" worth it; just make sure you seal meat good so it doesn't leak ( and so what if it does, eh?). Foil lined baking pan coated down w/ non-stick cooking spray is worth doing; don't worry about putting bread under the loaf. About 40 min in oven--took out and covered loaf w/ favorite BBQ sauce, letting it ride another 10 min made sure there were NO left-overs.

Used foil to roll up...wet counter, lay down foil, spray foil with cooking spray,  press out meatloaf mixture on foil, put cheese on and use foil to help roll up meat...used food processor to crush up pretzels in place of bread crumbs added some garlic salt(didn't use any reg. salt)and Worcester sauce also Colby Jack cheese...cant wait for it to come out of the oven.

My daughter LOVED this recipe. My husband liked it, but likes my regular meatloaf recipe better. I had no trouble rolling the meatloaf using parchment paper. Perhaps because my meat was still quite cold, and did not stick as much as warmer meat might have. Topped with mix of 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tbsp. brown sugar and 1 tsp. worchestershire.

I made it with a few changes. I reduced the salt to a 1/2 tsp. added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and a 1/4 c of fresh chopped green pepper. I use pepper jack cheese to stuff the center. Very pleased with the outcome, it was very moist.

This is a good basic recipe, but there is plenty of room for jazzing it up.  Next time I will add sweet pepper, garlic, and a few other spices.  I didn't have any problem making the jelly roll.  Once I had the meat spread out on the wax paper and the cheese spread over the meat, I slipped one hand under the wax paper and used the paper to help me roll the meat.  As it began rolling, I peeled back the paper until the meat was all rolled up.  Then I pinched the outer edges closed and smoothed over the end of the roll so it wouldn't separate during baking.  Because some people mentioned having problems with too much grease, I placed my rolled up loaf on a piece of foil which I had spread over a baking rack.  I put the rack in my pan and used a fork to poke drain holes in the foil. All the fat drained into the pan and away from the loaf.  I used a meat thermometer and baked it to 155 degrees and then let it sit for 15 minutes. It reached 160 degrees as it sat.  After 15 minutes, it sliced perfectly.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Super simple and very good! I had no problem rolling it up using the wax paper to help mold it. I used ground elk which is very lean so no oily problems. Lots of onion flavor and I like that.

My husband liked this more than I did. I made it like a lasagna as suggested by another review, but after an hour it still was pink in the middle. I cut it in half, cranked up the temperature a little, and cooked it for about 15 more minutes. It was still pink in spots. I topped it with a ketchup and mustard glaze with pickles.

I made this for the first time about a month ago. My man, who doesn't like meatloaf has requested it 3 times. :) I added Bacon bits and BBQ sauce to the recipe and the topped it with BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.

Taste just like a cheeseburger, minus the bread and other fixins! Very good and moist! I would recommend using very lean meat in order to avoid all the excess oil that the ground meat lets out.

( Im giving this 4 stars based off of majority vote and the fact I have not made this version and will be tweaking to my liking. ) I make meatloaf here and there it always comes out great (not to toot my own horn) but mainly an Italian version with half beef and half sweet italian sausage and fresh veggies/ peppers. I came across this version and decided on making this tonight for dinner except using bbq sauce on the top, and adding in green peppers into my meat and toping it when its out of the oven with fresh made crispy bacon bits can't wait to eat this we love burgers so this is perfect for our family of 3 thanks for the recipe

I wanted to try making a meatloaf for the first time and this recipe sounded really good so i tried it. Me my husband and kids absolutely loved it!!! it was juicy and tasted great! The only thing i did different was instead of rolling it up i put half the meatloaf in a 8x8 dish put the 3 cups of cheese( i used colby and monterey jack cheese) on top and used the other half to cover the cheese and went around the ended to put together the halves so the cheese didnt melt out while it cooked.

Love this recipe. My family doesn't like regular meatloaf but scarfs this. I didn't find it hard to roll up jelly roll style, I do, however, find it hard not to have the cheese leak out the ends. But I am pretty certain it is my issue, I most likely leave too little of a border and add more cheese then called for. I am going to try adding swiss and sauteed mushrooms tonight.

Was okay. I halved the recipe because it was just my husband and I, and we still had a few pieces left over. The only issue we had was with the cheese. It was more congealed than it was melted. It was likely the brand of cheddar we used. I'll make it again, but with a few revisions. Less onion and a different brand of cheese.

I made this with 1 lb. 93/7 beef and 1 lb. turkey. I substituted onion soup mix for the minced onions. I also split the meat into 2 halves and put the cheese in the middle and baked in a loaf pan. It turned out a little dry for my taste.

This is a wonderful take on traditional meatloaf. In order to achieve the jelly roll method I used 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of 3/4. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp. I also added 3 strips of raw bacon,cut into pieces along with 1 Tbls of Worstestershire sauce and a capful of liquid smoke to capture the taste of BBQ cheeseburgers. My family and friends love this. If you happen to have any leftovers, warm up the sliced meatloaf and put on hamburger buns.

My family loved this.  Since we are in the Southwest, I added some roasted Hatch green chile.  I also added bacon because bacon makes everything better! Yum!

Tasted great and I had no problem rolling it but 3/4 of the cheese came out of the meatloaf when it was cooking.  I used medium cheddar... maybe a different cheese would have worked better.

Definitely good.  I had no problems doing the jelly roll thing.  You just have to use the wax paper, or whatever, to lift up the mixture and roll it over onto the rest, and then use the wax paper to keep rolling it up, until it's done.  Yum.  Yum.

LOVED IT!!  I did what others suggested and divided the meat in half then made well smooshed all the cheese into into it and topped it off with the remaining meat.  I also had added Worchestershire to the meat.  After assembled, I added catsup on top with sauted chopped onions and peppers.  I baked it for an hour.  Turned out GREAT.  My husband and his coworker loved it!!

Good, but too unhealthy for an everyday meatloaf.  Tastes very similar to a cheeseburger.  Made like a lasgna, with layers in 9x13.

This is the best and easiest meatloaf recipe I have found. My husband "doesn't like meat loaf" and he LOVED this, my kids loved it too. I would recommend rolling it up as stated in the recipe though, it really does make it taste better. It is quick an easy to roll it, just lift up the paper as you roll, then put your pan over it and flip!

I HATE MEATLOAF!!!  Actually, my entire family does.  But we LOVED this!!!  SO good!  I changed the serving size to 3 pounds of beef and went with the adjusted recipe.  Seperated the meat mixture in half and pressed into a 9x13 glass pan, sprinkled about 2 cups of shredded cheddar on top and then pressed the other half of the meat on top.  I mixed ketchup and brown sugar and spread it on top.  SSOOO  good!!

I did this recipe exactly as instructed and it was pretty darn good. Nothing spectacular but still a recipe Id do again and again. Rolling the meat into a jelly roll I found much easier than people seemed to write about. Just lifting the wax paper and using it to roll it over helped. I would love to try other variations of this recipe. Especially with dill pickle chips or the mushroom swiss one!

Maybe I'm the Don Quixote of meatloaf. I have never liked meatloaf, but think I should so I search out recipe after recipe. I try the recipe and I realize it's just hamburger with various items added to it. I tried this recipe thinking I'd found my new-true-love and I have to say, it was just hamburger with cheese in it (but not in the yummy cheeseburger-on-the-grill way!) I'm not rating it lower because it's bad, but just because it's not spectacular. I figure the one meatloaf that takes my breath away will be the one to get a 5-star rating. This one isn't horrible, just not amazing.

great recipe. I am not a huge meatloaf fan but this is fantastic. Added green peppers for added flavor and topped with ketchup. Followed others recommendations and separated the meat mixture. Put the first half in the pan and then topped with cheese. Cover that w/ remaining meat-taking care to seal the edges so the cheese would not leak out from the two layers. Also cooked a broiler pan to allow the greese to drainm from the meatloaf as it cooks. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Good, not great.  Was expecting more based upon what the reviews were.  Our youngest, who is 8, gave it 5 out of 5 stars, while the rest of the family gave it 3.  It's a good recipe for simple palates.

Made this one time and it was very good. However I felt guilty eating it because of all the grease and fat but the flavor was really really good.

My kids loved this! I used american cheese, and topped with mustard and ketchup! This will replace all other meatloaf recipes that I have. Thanks!

This was super easy and quite good! My husband really loved the cheese surprise!  It was a really attractive looking meatloaf as well.  I had no problems rolling it. It even took just a matter of seconds.  My hamburger was a little cold still so perhaps that helped? Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

we loved this. i have 4 pretty picky boys and they loved it! I did not do the "jelly roll" thing.  I just put 1/2 in the pan topped w/ the cheese and put remaining meat on top of that, but it was delicious.  will definitely make again! thanks!

Good change of pace.  The rolling is not really that bad, you just can't get in a hurry and an extra set of hands would help.

Not as good as I hoped.  The regular recipe which, other than the cheese, is very similer to mine is preferable to me.  Then I can use the cheese on a side dish instead.

Of all the meals that are my family's favorites, meatloaf is my very least favorite UNTIL I made this recipe. More simply put together, I put half the meat in the pan, sprinkled it with a tad of mozzarella  I had left over and added a layer of cheddar. then I covered it with the remaining meat and ketchup to bake. wow! the texture the mozzarella gave it was wonderful. It was the first meatloaf I ever actually enjoyed. The whole family loved this as a nice change from the same ole same ole.

My fiance and I love this recipe. Instead of cheddar we put colby/jack (personal preference) and we just split the meat in two so the center is all cheese. I also top with a ketchup, yellow mustard, brown sugar, and dash of Worcestershire sauce topping. SO good. We also add rolled oats and flax instead of all bread crumbs. This is a very good recipe!

I didn't roll it and opted to split the beef mixture in half, make a well in the bottom and fill it with cheese, then add the top and seal all around.  Didn't use all the cheese and added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce.  I should have paid attention to the other reviews about letting it sit for a few minutes so the cheese doesn't goo right out.  Can't wait to make again and experiment with different fillings.

My mom never made meatloaf when I was younger so I tried this on a whim and it was fantastic! the perfect kind of meal for a college student, it made lots of great leftovers.  The only problem I had was that I didn't seal the ends well enough but I'll just work more at in next time I make it.

This was great... I never cared for meatloaf, then i saw this recipe and decided to try it, because my husband wanted meatloaf. wow, it was delicious. will make again. easy to roll. I spread it on foil, then put the cheese in the middle (shredded cheddar was the best), folded one end of the foil over peeled back foil, folded the other end over, peeled back foil, and pinched sides, and I had a perfect roll. very easy.. did add some of my own spices for flavor.

Extremely good... I don't usually add salt to anything, next time I will add salt, I did add ketsup on the top... I will also experiment some more and trying adding different spices. Next time I'm adding some chopped hot peppers...

This was good.  We're not big on meatloaf but had 2 lbs. of ground beef that needed using so I came across this recipe.  I didn't have wax paper so I used the method I read in many of the reviews and most of the cheese oozed out.  Next time I will definitely attempt to roll it the way it says in the recipe so I don't loose the yummy cheesiness!

VERY good!!  I dropped the serving size to four, and used Barbeque sauce instead of ketchup.  Also added jalapenos, onion powder, and garlic powder.

Really good idea with the cheese center! I cooked it for my family and my little bro loved it! I substituted bread crumbs with oatmeal, and instead of rolling the cheese in like the recipe, I just but half the mixute on the bottom and hollowed a space out for the cheese then filled the rest in on top and on the sides. it worked really well.

I used the method in the recipe and used what I had on hand.  I only had 1 lb of beef so I used that and 1 pound of ground turkey, Seasoned bread crumbs and Mozzarella cheese.  I make meat loaf in a 8 x8 dish.  I put 1/2 the meat in, a layer of the cheese and the rest of the meat.  This was really good.  Didn't need any topping as far as I am concerned.

Yum! I did make a few changes, but this is a solid recipe. I chopped up fresh mushrooms, then sauteed in butter and garlic, and added those to the cheese layer. I also only used 2 cups of cheese and that was plenty. I topped it with a glaze of steak sauce, ketchup, and brown sugar. Very good, will make again. Thanks!

This was really good. I wasn't sure how to roll it so I just made a thin meatloaf spread the cheese and put another thin meatloaf ontop and topped with ketchup. I used saltine crackers instead of the breadcrumbs because that's how I grew up eating meatloaf. Thanks a nice change from my usual meatloaf.

This was really good. The whole family loved it. I did add a little worcestershire (sp?) sauce, some season salt, and a little garlic powder. I also only used 1 1/2 lb ground beef and it needed longer than 1 hour to cook. I served this with some corn on the cob and some fried pickles. Awesome :)

This was sensational.  I got a little crazy after reading the reviews and put ketchup and dill relish inside the meatloaf on top of the cheese.  DH and I loved it but my mother and sister thought the pickle was a bit weird.  I do want to try it with some grilled onions and mushrooms, maybe bacon.  Excellent recipe though, both as is and with modifications.

Great comfort food!  The whole family loved it, including my increasingly picky 2-yr-old.  Easy to roll with waxed paper.  Delicious with some chopped mushroom and Italian seasoning added to the meat, and a mix of american, mozz and grated romano cheeses.  I used turkey instead of beef and it was still moist and tender.  Also looks impressive when you slice it!

Making it for the second time in six days... 'nuf said!

My only changes were a little garlic powder and some dried herbs to my taste I and flattened and rolled it on foil and then put loaf and the foil on my pan.  Easier cleanup...  If you're a meatloaf fan, you'll enjoy this one!

I use velveta instead of cheddar. I love this recipe topped with bbq sauce.
As for rolling it, I just take half of the meat and form it and then add the ChEEsE and the the top half...no problem still just as yummy!!

Since it's usually only my boyfriend and I eating, I make 2 small loaves - cook one and freeze the other.  Bake frozen loaf for an hour and a half at 350. Yum!!!

This was really good, my hubby and kids loved it.  I was worried about it being dry without any sauce but it was very juicy and good. I used red onion for a little bit of a sweet flavor.  The only thing I may change next time is adding a couple of cloves of chopped garlic or maybe some garlic salt. 

I used parchment paper for rolling and rolled it exactly like I would sushi and it was very easy.

This one is definitely a keeper!

Okay, kind of bland even after adding garlic salt and extra seasonings, tasted exactly like the recipe states, a Cheeseburger meatloaf.  Way too much cheese, I did 2 cups and felt that was overkill.  Wonder if American would work better....next time will def. add some dill relish to the mix and top with ketchup/mustard glaze, easy to roll with foil, thanks for the suggestion will use that again!  Be prepared to doctor recipe to your personal tastes, but a great base recipe, thx for sharing!

This recipe has become a family favorite for sure.  My son asks for it all the time.  I like to add olives and Italian seasonings to the meat mixture before rolling, as well as using pepper jack cheese instead of the cheddar just because it's a favorite of ours.  Either way, it's delicious and I never have leftovers.

My husband and I enjoyed this meatloaf immensely. I followed the ideas of other reviewers and, instead of rolling the meat, I took half and patted it into an 8x8 pan, sprinkled the cheese and some bacon on it, and then patted the other half of the meatloaf on top and pinched the sides closed. I used ground turkey, so there wasn't any grease to drain. The taste was terrific and we talked about putting some sauteed mushrooms and onions in the middle next time! Yum, Yum.

We ate this meatloaf right up.  I did add worchestershire and a dash of liquid smoke instead of salt and pepper.  I mixed one cup of extra sharp cheddar into the meat mixture along with some diced onion and minced garlic.  I topped it off with a slice of cheese right before it came out of the oven for good presentation and it turned out beautifully.  Next time I might glaze it with a ketchup/ mustard mixture.

My family told me this meatloaf was good but......they miss my regular meatloaf. I agree, this meatloaf is good, and a nice change of pace, but there are much tastier recipes for meatloaf out there. But, this is what it is, a cheesburger meatloaf. And if a cheesburger tasting meatloaf is what you want, then this one fits the bill!

I made this for my family (husband is Mr. Meat & Potato), and they loved it!  
I used oats instead of the bread crumbs and drizzled ketchup over the top of the meatloaf during the last 20-30 minutes to make a crust.

My 5 yr. old daughter who is "Miss Picky" acutally asked me for a 2nd helping!

Husband loved this receipe.  Said "it did what it was supposed to do perfectly." I added worcestershire sauce in the burger mix.  I also coated the top of the meatloaf with a barbeque, catsup, mustard mix.  I'm not a big fan of meatloaf but this was very tasty.

This is the first meatloaf I've ever had, and it was wonderful.  I used flavored breadcrumbs, omitted the minced onion, and added 2 packages of Onion Soup Mix.  Instead of forming the jelly roll, I just mixed everything together and formed a loaf.  I will make this recipe over and over again!

Great Meatloaf!  Just a couple of additions that I thought helped; I added 1/2 cup worchestershire sauce and used Garlic Salt instead of the regular salt.  My 8 and 10 yr. olds were all set to hate it and the look of surprise on their faces when they first tried it was hilarious!

This was a great recipe. My whole family loved it and we love cheese, so I added a lot more! I used 1/4 cup italian breadcrumbs instead, and it turned out perfect! I Have already made it twice! Will be a recipe I make for years to come. Thanks for sharing it!

This was my first meatloaf, and it turned out great!  My husband loved it!  I did one thing different, instead of doing a jelly roll style, I put one layer of meat down, then cheese, and then a top layer of meat.  This was so easy with great results!

I decided to make my first meatloaf last night and chose this recipe.  I rather enjoyed it being that meatloaf is not one of my favorites.  I did modify it slightly.  I mixed in the grated cheese instead of layering and rolling it.  I used onion soup mix instead of an onion.  Then baked in a loaf pan.  It turned out great and my 6 year old ate her entire plate (which is rare!).  Although nex time I would omit the extra salt as the onion soup mix is quite salty itself.  Thanks for a delicious dinner.

This was great!  Haven't made meatloaf in a long time.  I made modifications, instead of using minced onion, I used a package of beefy onion soup mix.  And instead of rolling jelly roll style, I just mixed the cheese into the meat mixture.  Served this with Mashed potato casserole also from this website.  Boyfriend had seconds and is not one for meatloaf and he liked this alot!  Looking forward to leftovers!

I just made these tonight,they turned out great.I changed it slighty by using half a package of lipton dry onion soup instead of raw onions.It really added to the flavor.I made them into indivdual mini meatloafs and the chesse mostly stayed inside.I'll be making these again!

I'm not a meatloaf fan, but this one is good. The cheese makes it very moist. I usually have to get my baster out to remove lots of grease that collects around the edges of the loaf during cooking, though. I've never bothered with the jelly roll method - I just mix the cheese all in. Next time I'll try the suggested variation of swiss cheese and mushroom.

Great meatloaf.  Event he kids ate it.  I added an extra egg, some onion soup mix and used american cheese instead of cheddar.  Cut back on the salt if using the onion soup.  It was a bit too much for me.  I look forward to making this again.

This was a nice change from regular meatloaf. I was afraid the cheese would all ooze out because the loaf mixture didn't completely stick together when rolled and some cheese was "peeking" out, but baked up okay. My 9 year old son told me this was the best meatloaf I've ever made. This is also good made with thinly sliced deli ham and swiss cheese.

This is such an awsome and easy way to make meat loaf. I basted it with ketchup when I put it in the oven, gave it a little more flavor. Also it's a great recipe for those on the Atkins diet, just leave out the bread crumbs!

This is my second day of cooking, ever, I am a 42 year old man and this recipe although it needs tweaking for everyones taste was a hit with my family.  I like some of the ideas in the reviews and will try the bacon, BBQ sauce, and the worctershire(sp) sauce.

I've made a few changes to this, but I still love it. I really had trouble rolling it, so I just combine all the ingredients together and shape it as a meatloaf. Also, I added a can of flavored diced tomatoes-I tried salsa but it makes the meat dry. The tomatoes give it great flavor.  I also tried this with ground turkey, but it was awful.  Thanks for this-it's a family favorite!!

Tasted good, but I had trouble keeping the cheese inside the meatloaf (actually, anything I've cooked with cheese inside, the cheese always oozes out).

My husband loves this recipe!  I've just been adding a slice of cheese inbetween layers of the meatloaf instead of mixing the cheese into the loaf.  The cheese really makes the meat moist when it melts.  This is our favorite meatloaf recipe.

This was a hit!
I added bacon to to the cheese layer and served it with ketchup, mustard and pickles.
I found it easy to roll up using wax paper---just by pulling up the corners of one end of the wax paper to help it along---i will definitely make this again.

my man (who absolutely hates onions) said this was the worst meatloaf he ever tasted but my 4-year old (who hates red meat) asked for more and called it delicious. I personally loved it but next time I'll skip the jellyroll part and just layer it like lasagna because it was way too complicated for me. I tried so hard and it was still so messy. I even tried wrapping it in foil but that just made it take extra long to cook and still made a yummy cheesy mess.

This basic recipe is excellent, though 1 hour cooking time is way too long.  I also cut the recipe in half.  You could add almost anything to the cheese center, or replace the cheese altogether.  I can't believe this isn't a Top 10.  Thanks Douglas!

This is such a great idea.  I used American cheese and wrapped the meatloaf in bacon.  It tasted like a bacon cheeseburger!  You do need to make sure you seal the ends well ot the cheese will melt out.  The second time I tried this I just kept some of the meat mixture aside and added it to the ends once I rolled it to make a really good seal.

Since there are only 2 of us and I did not want to eat it for a week - I cut the recipe in half and did it in a small baking dish. Baked for only 40 min. Also I did it in layers.  When I reheated it I sliced it cold and laid it on it's side and put somemore cheese on top.  Reheated wonderfully.

This meatloaf was absolutely DELICIOUS! I don't like meatloaf with a sugary/tomato sauce, so I definitely wanted to try this one. The only problem was rolling it jelly-roll style - it kept falling apart. But that didn't affect the taste at all, and I know I will make this meatloaf again soon.

Pretty good for a change from regular meatloaf.  I would mix the cheese in with the meat mixture though.  It all spilled out as soon as you cut the meatloaf.  I also only put in about 2c of cheese and that was more than enough.

This recipe went over big at the fire hall.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of fresh, I also put a layer of tomato sauce between the cheese and beef and spread ketchup on top.  Very good meal, easy to fix.

Very good taste, but due to poor pinching, most of the cheese came out.  Great for meatloaf lovers and leftover sandwiches.

This recipe is one of the best that I have come across in the last few years.  There are so many variations one can use to prepare a moist and flavorful meatloaf.  I've used this recipe three times now and all I get is rave reviews from the table.

Very good simple meat loaf!  I had no problems rolling the loaf, using wax paper to help me along.  The only problem I had was I didn't seal the end of the roll well enough and had some cheese escape!

My family really liked the addition of cheese stuffing to their standard meatloaf! I can't give it 5 stars, simply because I used my family meatloaf recipe (which includes tomato soup or paste, oats, and a special seasoning blend). But the stuffing concept is definitely worth the 4 stars! Thanks for the idea and technique!

I made no changes. However loaf was so big I may 1/2 it next time. Very moist and great taste. Not your momma’s heavy, door stop loaf. This is wonderful.

We used Almond flour instead of the bread crumbs. It held together great. We added seasoning salt and should have left that out as, for us it was too salty. Otherwise it tasted great!!

My family loves this meatloaf! I season my meat with garlic salt, pepper, and Alpine touch, along with a squeeze of ketchup and mustard. Lay half my meat mixture in the loaf pan, add slices of cheddar cheese, and top with the rest of the meat mixture. I also weave bacon across the top. I have found that the microwave bacon works much better than regular bacon. I also periodically check to see if any grease needs to be drained throughout the cooking time.

We loved this!
I added a bacon weave lattice and BBQ sauce on top, but followed the actual loaf recipe exactly.
Definitely going in the dinner rotation here!

I didn't have any trouble rolling it.
Patted it out on sprayed parchment paper,  and used the paper to aid in rolling. Left it rolled tightly, and refrigerated for 1 hour before baking.

Every year for my fiance's birthday I make him a meatloaf cake. This year I decided to bring it up a notch. Since he isn't a fan of a ketchup top I use bbq sauce instead which turns this into a bbq bacon cheeseburger meatloaf! Top with mashed potatoes for an "icing" effect! He was a very happy man!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had. I made meatloaf sandwiches on roasted garlic ciabatta bread with hamburger pickles, ketchup and mustard. There was some oozing of the cheese, but next time I will try layering meat and then cheese a couple of times like some one else had mentioned. I can't wait to make it again!!

It was a decent starter recipe. 
I sauteed 1 onion and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic.  I added 1/2 tsp garlic power, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teas. dried parsley, 1 tabl. ketchup, and 1 tabl. of A1 sauce.  It was marvelous.

Yummy! I made a half recipe and checked it at 50 min. It was way over 160degF. So, if I made this small version again, I'd check it a lot earlier. For the half amount, I used an 8x4 loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray, placing half the meat, then a layer of Mexican blend cheese (a little less than specified and leaving room at the edges) and then the rest of the meat. I topped it with a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. I also added a little Worcestershire sauce and garlic and onion powders to the meat. Thanks Douglas....very good recipe!

Ya'll know I made some changes. First off I used turkey instead of beef. A full cup of bread crumbs. A whole white onion, minced. A cup of mushrooms, minced. Three eggs. No salt, no pepper. Only one cup of cheese maybe a cup and a quarter.

When working with the mixture, wash your hands and rebutter your hands every time you work with it. I've made this three times it gets better every time. Don't be afraid to and the salt and pepper to taste. I just can't take it.


First wisk the eggs. Then ad the onion and mushroom. Next bread crumbs and turkey. Mix that very thoroughly. Spray cooking oil on to a cookie sheet with a side wall of one inch. Push the mixture into the cookie sheet, try to make even. Then spread your cheese on the mixture. with the use of a spatula start to roll the mixture into a jell roll type roll. Rolling all the cheese inside. Do not try to pick it up. Simply slide the roll on the cookie sheet lengthwise to cook. An hour at 375-400. Cover for first 45 minutes with foil. Then uncover and finish cooking.

            Bon appetit!!!

I made this today, assembling it in the morning and refrigerating it until about an hour before I wanted to serve dinner. I had no problem with rolling the meatloaf because I put the meat mixture on a wax paper-lined countertop and used the paper to do the hard work. The cheese we had on hand was sharp cheddar cheese; I don't recommend it for this recipe for two reasons: it was just too sharp and it didn't melt appropriately. The meatloaf itself was better than many I've made in the past, but it wasn't as spectacular as I had hoped. I'm really hoping that the cold meatloaf sandwiches will be everything that I could possibly want tomorrow.

This was so good.  I layered instead of rolled, like the others have mentioned.  However, I not only used Cheese, but I also added onions, Jalapeños, and dill pickle slices to the center.  I also used the idea to glaze the top with BBQ sauce.  This will be on our regular scheduled meal rotation.

I love this recipe! I usually add a little pepper and mushroom too. For a fun twist, I made mini loads in a muffin tin for my kids and they loved their personal loafs! This is a monthly menu item for sure!

Yes, I will make again.  It had a wonderful flavor and yes I took the time to roll it.  I used parchment  paper and that helped me with the wrapping.  For the onions I used red ones. I didn't have enough cheddar so I opted to use some Sargento Southwestern slices.  This worked well with the red onions I used.  I stuck with the recipe except for the varieties of cheese and onion .  Even though I thought I did a great job of rolling and tucking some of the cheese still escaped. Still good though and don't forget to let it sit the 15 mins after cooking, this helped.

This was a bit more work than I like , however this was worth all the work.  This was a great meal.  Made great left overs.   I recommend this for a dinner meal.

Very easy to make.  Combinations are endless.  I only had one pound of ground beef, so I added a pound of spinach Italian sausage.  American cheese was used.  Placed a few strips of bacon on the top before baking.

HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED!!!

I loved this. But I didn't roll it. I did put it in a pan and made a depression in the center an put the cheese in the center.  This is also makes a great cold sandwich.

Dry, bland, and even after an hour and half in the oven, the center isn’t cooked. Really disappointing after seeing all the positive reviews. But then again, they all added tons of extra stuff to make it palatable.

Delicious and easy!  Wanted bacon cheeseburger so I added 1/2 cup of real bacon bits to the cheese and used saltines instead of bread.  Made it the night before and used the layering method of assembly in a loaf pan.   Refrigerate overnight and turn out onto a roasting pan before baking.  AB does this to eliminate the dreaded soggy bottom.  Topped with ketchup,  mustard and brown sugar glaze.   served with fried dill pickle chips,  French fries and a garden salad with 1000 island for the full burger effect.

Definitely needed a little less fatty of ground beef and a little less cheese. Came out real greasy. I used a whole onion, came out great though.

This is a winner because it has so much flavor and also is very moist.  After one makes it once (to learn how to roll it up), it can be halved and the rolling process will still work.  The original recipe is large and would easily feed 10 people.

Back in the day,  1961,  I was a service wife. so you had to make do with what you could afford.    I loved this recipe, although I used a cast iron skillet for baking it.  I was young and inexperienced.  Using my imagination, I  patted the first layer out . I put  onlons, sliced thin, ketchup, mustard and cheese.   Following with the top,  already patted in a round circle, sealing the edges.  Simple, but it came out  sooo good.   I was proud.  Thank you Douglas for sharing this recipe with everyone.

I adapted the recipe for what I had on hand (1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey and 1.5 cups of American, 1/5 cups cheddar cheese). Definitely needs additional seasoning. I'll be making it again with garlic powder and maybe some parsley or another herb.

This was a big hit, I'm retired and my wife is still working, so I  make dinner more often. This recipe was a success ( rare for me, I hate to cook ). I used ground turkey since we are trying  to cut WAY back on red meat. I'm looking forward to trying different cheeses in the middle the next time.

This was really good! I used turkey meat, italian seasoned breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and used only 2 cups of cheese.  I took another reviewer's advice and halved the meat, added the cheese, and then put the rest of the meat mixture on top of the cheese and also smeared mustard and ketchup on the top.  I tried to seal the edges but some of the cheese oozed out.  It didn't matter because it was still delicious!

Family loved it! Two tweeks: First one, I divided meat in half. Flattened half meat into baking dish, sprinkled the cheese on it, then used the remaining meat to cover the cheese.
Second tweek: When meatloaf reached 170degrees, I took it out of oven and poured the excess grease out of the pan., waited ten minutes before serving.

Very dry, baked hard, all the cheese drained out, even though I sealed all the edges. The meat, flattened as directed, was too thin to keep the cheese inside the loaf.

I've been making a very similar meatloaf (without the toppings) for about 40 years. It originally appeared in a little brochure put out by the Hunt's tomato people that included the lasagna recipe I always make. I've used ground beef and ground chicken as the meat for the meatloaf, with either grated cheddar or mozzarella cheeses for the filling, and baked the rolled-up loaf on a rimmed baking sheet. Both options are a hit but I've never thought of this meatloaf as a cheeseburger with typical cheeseburger toppings. I think leaving them to the various eaters is better, as different people like different toppings.

If we have any leftovers we usually make meatloaf sandwiches. With this recipe I just bought some nice ciabatta rolls and served meatloaf burgers for dinner. Such an easy and tasty recipe. I can serve it with any homemade salad, macaroni, potato or coleslaw. Family loves it. I did follow some suggestions like very lean beef and layering instead of rolling. 
Thank you so much for one of this families favorites.

I live in Turkey and added a meatball spice that is indigenous to Turkey. No need to add salt or pepper. Plus I added fresh parsley into the mix with deli sliced Turkey meat and cheese. I then coated it with olive oil and covered it with aluminium foil. After cooking for one hour, I spread ketchup over and cooked again for 10 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes. Delicious

Tasted fine as made, Family had multiple servings so it was a big hit. 
I used the base recipe to start with. Instead of cheddar I used Cheddar Colby mix. 
And instead of rolling pinwheel style. I carried on the burger them in the shape. 
Next time I make this I plan on adding the seasonings I use when I make burgers. And adding some extra moisture to it, or reducing the breadcrumbs.

To make rolling easier, lay long sheets of plastic wrap on the counter and spray with cooking spray.  Press the beef into a flat rectangle about 1/2 in. thick, or a little more, cover with cheese, and roll holding the plastic wrap as your guide (of course, discard the plastic when done).  If the meat is too thin the cheese will likely leak out once the beef starts cooking down.  Although that burnt cheese at the bottom of the pan is a treat in and of itself!  IMO, SHARP cheddar gives it the best flavor.

I reduced the salt and pepper and included diced green and red peppers in the meatloaf.   Salt intake in my house it watched and this recipe called for to much salt and pepper.  and instead of using the breadcrumbs I use saltless crackers.

I like how you roll up the cheese inside jelly roll fashion.  I make a version of this using rolled oats instead of bread crumbs and chunks of Velveeta cheese and cook it in a 8 x 8 glass pan.  I also use 1/2 a can of tomato sauce in the meat and the other half spread on top then lay bacon strips oover it. Cook covered for 30 minutes then uncover for the final 30 minutes to get the bacon crisp.  Makes great sandwiches the next day also.

I did as others suggested and instead of rolling just created a divot for the cheese between a top and bottom layer.  Other than that I followed the directions except I don't ever add salt to anything.  The meatloaf was dry, and still needed to be cooked longer.  Also, the cheese made it over overwhelmingly salty, even for me, who loves salt, and loves cheese.

I made the recipe as written.  I used extra sharp cheddar which adds flavor to the beef.  To handle the grease I used lean ground beef and put slices of bread under the meatloaf.  They soak up the grease so that your meatloaf isn't greasy.  I rolled the meatloaf on non-stick (or sprayed) tinfoil.  Then slip the bread under and lift the loaf into the pan on the tinfoil to make for easy clean up.

Why choose between burger night and meat loaf night? You can so have both! I fused this recipe with the one for Brown Sugar meatloaf that is also popular on here. Turned out PERFECTLY. Can safely say it's better than my mothers, and no one's is!!

This recipe is fantastic! I followed the recipe as is but cut it in half because I made it for myself. I LOVED it. I also had to freeze some and it was wonderfully moist after freezing and thawing. Yum!
I am definitely going to make this again, but am going to add sliced ham and mozzarella. Thanks! 
Side note: I almost forgot that I only had sliced White Cheddar, but it was still awesome.

Best meatloaf EVER!! You can not be disappointed with this meatloaf. It's a safe bet for a family dinner and you will be glad you made it! This is incredible! My family raved over it and we pass on this recipe all the time. We have tried other cheeseburger meatloaf recipes before but this one is the best, by a LONG shot! Rolling the meatloaf definitely makes the recipe! Such a great find! Thanks for sharing!!

Very tasty! Used ground elk since that is usually whats on hand in my household. Other than that, the only changes I made was to add a bit of Worcestershire and I used a mozz/cheddar blend. The rolling up part was a bit tedious but I only had one minor cheese blow out during baking.

This was great! I used ground turkey and quick oats instead of beef and bread crumbs and it was too mushy to roll, so I just squished it all together. It was great that way, no need to take the time to roll it. I baked it in a 9x13 flat.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. The only change I made was to wrap the meatloaf in bacon before cooking. It was delicious and I don't even like meatloaf! I will be making this one again.

Very tasty, especially after kicking it up with bacon!!  Only thing we'll do different next time is divide the meat and make a channel for the cheese and cover with the remaining meat.

We loved this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe.  I did add more chopped onions (as we love them).  The rolling process was not hard at all.   I used parchment paper and was able to roll the meat by pulling the paper upwards and over so that the meat would basically roll on it's own.  Not hard at all like others had said in their reviews.   I put it on foil in a baking pan and added some ketchup across the top.  After it finished cooking, I did let it sit for at least 10 minutes (I would recommend longer because it was still oozing).  Of course, as the picture shows, we ate it with pickle chips.  Absolutely delicious and I will make it again.

I am always looking for a new meatloaf recipe and thought I would give this a try.   I added a little ketchup & worcestershire sauce to the mix.   I did not have any problem rolling up the meatloaf as some people did.  I used my wax paper to roll the beef and it worked great.  That being said, I really don't think it needs to be rolled like a pinwheel.  Once it is cut, it is difficult to keep it together.  I think it would work better to just put a layer of meat down, fill with cheese, & top with a second layer.   In the end, we thought this was just ok with not a lot of flavor, so, I probably won't make again.

I love cheese but I might use 2 cups instead of three.  I also used a 1.5qt deep dish and cooked for 65 minutes.  It's easier to drain the grease.  I also dropped the salt and used a few tablespoons of kinder original marinade instead of Worcestershire sauce and some ketchup.  It came out great!

Scanned through all the recommendations on this recipe and made some changes. I used 95% lean ground beef , added 6 cloves of garlic to the mixture, used ground club crackers instead of bread crumbs. I took Amanda's tip to split the mixture in half and laid out one half in the baking dish, added my cheese mix of shredded 4 cheese Mexican and jalapeno jack.Then covered with the remaining meat mixture and tamped down the edges . Call it a Mexican cheeseburger meatloaf if you like but it was very tasty !!! May have to add sliced Jalapeno to the next one ... bon appetit !

I don't even like meatloaf, and this is good stuff!  Warning:  there will be some cheese leakage.  In spite of my best efforts to seal it off, it leaked a bit anyway.  Was still delicious.  I added a bit of beef base and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce for a kick of flavor, sauced it with ketchup only and my family loved it.  Home fried potatoes and green beans made this iconic dish a mashup of weeknight dinner and Friday night out.  Will definitely make this again!  And again, and again...

Came out perfect! I covered it the first hour, then uncovered it after that. Took mine about 90 minutes or so. Just keep your meet thermometer handy. So incredibly easy to make!

This will be the family favorite now. We used the Montreal steak seasoning. We did not shred the cheese, rather left it in block form. We have 22x16 cooking sheets that I used to flatten and roll the loaf. As it was done, I just put more shredded cheese on top and let everyone season to taste on their plates.
Seeing how sushi is rolled, I do like the suggestion of using the foil or wax paper to assist in rolling.

Used Italian flavored breadcrumbs and the hubby LOVED it. Very similar to the Mock Filet recipe here in terms of flavor (though that recipe has the edge b/c of the bacon). Made a ketchup, mustard and brown sugar glaze on top.  Made 2 smaller loaves (though not really successfully) and only needed 2 cups of cheese. If I had a bigger loaf pan, I would have made a full sized meatloaf.

What can I say?  WOW!!  Following the suggestion of other reviewers, I did not attempt to roll it as the author has done, but rather made it in two layers in a casserole dish.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly except for using more cheese (family preference).  This meatloaf was a super hit with the entire family!  Thank you Douglas.

I made this exactly as stated with the exception of cooking it in a loaf pan.  I have never written a review before, but my husband of 50 years went on and on about how this was the most delicious meatloaf I have ever made and I have made countless meatloafs in the 50 years we have been married.  It's also the easiest one I've ever made.  So enjoy and thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Yummy, 18-yr old son loved it.  Made as directed except had only 1.5 lbs of beef so cut back accordingly. (One egg.) Cheese oozed out while baking but those almost-crunchy parts are tasty! Will make again, probably won't try to roll it though. Thanks!

The only change I made was, mixing mozzarella with Mexican cheddar mix.  Did add ketchup  with pickle juice  & glazed the top.  My husband loved it.  Also I did use 80/20 lean beef, hardly 
not grease.  Very moist, even as leftovers.Rose

Good meatloaf recipe. I added some Huckleberry BBQ sauce to the top to sweeten it up and also just added the cheese in the pan and then put the next layer on top and just sealed it. Easier than spreading the whole thing out on paper. I think next time though I will try Swiss cheese instead of the Cheddar. I also sautéed the onions before I put them in the mixture as I do not like the way onions cook in meatloaf or meatballs if you don't. I also suggest letting it sit for a bit before cutting into it.

Great recipe. My contribution to this easy meal is to add some red pepper flakes to spice things up a bit. Other than this nothing to improve on. Made a great meal and even better leftovers.

Very good.  I halved the recipe and used less salt as recommended .  I used a four cheddar cheese blend.  Parchment paper worked great, although I didn't pack it tight enough so it leaked.  No loss, after it rested; I spooned the cheese over it.  Definitely is a favorite.

I switched out the  Salt and pepper with grill mates hamburger seasoning and it was excellent. I also added some onion rings to the top of the meatloaf right before serving.  I will definitely be serving this dish again!

I made this recipe but altered it a little. I added a package of dry ranch dressing  and I also added pickles. I chopped the pickles up in a food processor and drained the extra liquid on a paper towel. Layered the pickles on the bottom half then added the cheese. I too didn't roll but layered. It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again. 

I also used ground turkey for less fat. 
My husband said it tasted like a Big Mac

Made this tonight and added cooked bacon pieces to it. Amazing! I didn't do the jelly roll step. Instead I patted 1/2 the meat into the bottom of the loaf pan, covered it with cheese and bacon, and then added the top layer of meat. Baked as directed and topped with ketchup and mustard. It was awesome!! Kids loved it and I have no leftovers!

Look advice from another and made it in a 9x13 pan and layered it like a lasagna; It was fabulous!!!! I didn't add the full about of salt and pepper.

Layers:
1. Thin layer of meat
2. 1/2 of Cheese
3. Meat
4. Rest of Cheese
5. Rest of Meat

Cooked at 350 for about 50ish minutes. Family loved it and would like it again :)

This was kind of "bland" for me. I put Onions, Green pepper, a good squirt of Sweet & Tangy Steak sauce, cheddar cheese, eggs & a sleeve of crushed Ritz Crackers in mine.

I loved this recipe, little difficult to roll but a bit of patience was well worth it. I used a meatloaf pan so all the grease goes in the bottom of the pan..will definitely make this again, huge hit

SALT:  Cheese is salty, and 1 1/2 tsp salt is too much. No added salt to mixture used.
Made for the family members that can eat beef. Each could add salt as desired.

So much more fun than just 'meat loaf'. Using parchment or foil for the rolling is a much better choice.  Also take time to form the roll before removing the paper and transferring to baking pan. And since it is called Cheeseburger -cheese would be the filling but I have made with other types of fillings.  A favorite is sauteed mushrooms, spinach, onion and tomatoes.  Another is butternut squash cubes (partially pre cooked).  A cheese topping can finish either of these.

I have been making this meatloaf recipe for years -  my family loves it .  I don't go through all the work of rolling the loaf - I simply add the cheese to the recipe and put in a loaf pan.  I also add mustard & ketchup right into the mixture for a great added flavor.

I really enjoyed this. I didn't have bread crumbs, so I toasted whole wheat bread in a 170 degree oven for 2 hours and then put in a food processor to make the crumbs. I used 93/7 beef and a silicon mat to roll the loaf. I sprayed the mat with cooking spray before patting out meat mixture onto the mat. I spread a thin layer of worcestershire on the meat before adding the cheese. Then, after rolling up the loaf, I added a thin layer of mustard and ketchup to the top. Baked 50 min on a cookie cooling rack placed in a jelly pan to a temperature of 155 (which raised to 159 upon sitting 5 minutes). Next time, I will try 85/15 beef. Good recipe. Thank you!

Interesting technique.  I enjoyed the cheese in the middle; mine leaked out and made a yummy "cheese skirt" around the loaf, which was actually really tasty.  I modified this recipe enough to have no real business rating it.  I used some ketchup andmustard in the beef, and cut back the salt as many suggested; I also used mozzerella cheese as that's what I had on hand.  The family enjoyed it fairly well.

Love this recipe!   If you adjust the serving to 4 instead of 8 it comes out perfect. I also add cut up cooked bacon in with hamburger. About 3 or 4 pieces. I also add garlic powder, Italian seasoning and a bit of basil. I use a glass dish rather than metal and lay strips of uncooked bacon on top. Check it after 40 min add more time if needed. Its a favorite in my house.

Made this tonight for dinner, but did as others suggested and made it a loaf instead of a roll. Worked well. The meatloaf (made with turkey) was moist and flavorful. I did add Worcestershire sauce to the mix because I love it, and made a glaze with ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, garlic and Worcestershire sauce. It was really good. I think it'll make a great sandwich tomorrow!

Delicious! I used a combination of Asiago and mozzarella cheeses in the center and covered it with a blend of tomato paste, brown sugar, and Worcestershire (I also added a splash of Worcestershire to the meatloaf).

I feel most meatloaf's are created equal so it's fun to try a little something new and i like it:) I skipped the rolling part (per many reviews) and assembled more like a lasagna with the meat being the 'noodles' and then layered the cheese, meat, another cheese layer and meat to top and just pinched the openings. Also went with the leaner meat as suggested which helped keep it nice and tight.

I added Worcestershire sauce in with the meat. I used Velveeta shredded cheese. This recipe came out amazing. I followed another recommendation to make "layers" with the meatloaf. Next time I will roll as directions say. While the idea of burger-cheese-burger layering sounds easy,  it's a challenge to pinch the sides of the meat.  I also added caramelized onions on the top.

Decent meatloaf. Didn't really taste any different then any other meatloaf Ive eaten though thats why I only gave it 3 stars. Most of the cheese managed to ooze its way out as well. Decent meatloaf but Ive had better on here. Could use some tomato sauce as well as it wasn't very moist.

Absolutely loved this recipe! My boyfriend made this when I had first met him while having dinner with his family. Needless to say it was outstanding! I've never had meatloaf before and we always come back to this recipe when we crave some meatloaf! We're making some more tonight with his family again. :)

Tasted pretty decent; I am new to cooking, and my version of this looked absolutely ugly!

Pros: Very easy to make, and taste exactly how it is described (like a cheeseburger)

Cons: Gets very greasy, and breaks up too easy. I would suggest to the person that made this recipe to  give us a better idea of how THICK the rectangle of ground beef needs to be as opposed to what the dimensions should be. 

I ended up cutting this in to cubes with toothpicks so they could be dipped in to various sauces as opposed to slicing it up since it fell apart so easily. May make again, but not any time soon

This was a huge hit!! My boys devoured it!! The only changes I made were adding a sauteed shallot to the loaf and smothering the top with mustard and ketchup and layering it instead of using the jelly loaf method.  It came out perfect and the kids are already asking me to make it again!!

Wanted to try something different with meatloaf.  Not a great idea.  Apparently, I just like good old fashion "regular" meatloaf.

As I am a fan of garlic...I added a teaspoon of minced garlic as well as a tsp of Rosemary.....Per other's suggestions I added Montreal Steak seasoning and the worchester sauce and toppped the meatloaf with honey BBQ sauce.  This recipe made enough loaves for me to freeze for future use.  I simply cut the loaves in halves or thirds as there is only 2 of us. I found spraying my waxed paper with a little bit of olive oil spray took care of the "jelly roll" problem.  Bon appetite!!!

I patted my meat mixture out on a piece of aluminum foil and used that to help roll it up jelly roll fashion. Also used a combination of ground bison, turkey and pork for my meat mixture. Best meatloaf ever.

Excellent! i used 1/2 cup garlic/onion croutons and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to add flavor and added some ginger. I also tooks everyones reccommendations with the salt and only used about 1/2 tsp. Ive never done a jelly roll before but found that rolling it with my hand under the wax paper with the wax paper doing the rolling as a previous reviewer suggested was a huge success. had it on my first try! added sauce on top about 15 min before it was done (Ketchup, brown sugar and worchester sauce). best meatloaf ever!

I'm not sure what everyone else did to make this be a 5-star recipe, but I thought it was awful.  The meat was dry, and the onion... oh dear lord the onion... I won't be able to eat anything with onions for a month.   Just awful.

This recipe is in the oven as I type this.  Super easy to make, I multiplied the recipe x1.5 (we have 5 kids & I love leftovers :)).  The jelly roll effect is easy to accomplish if you start the roll the slab up using the wax paper instead of trying to lift the meat itself.  It smells great, hope it tastes the same!

I loved this! I tweaked it a bit more to what was on hand. I omitted the salt and pepper, and had to used dried minced onion. I also added about a tablespoon of rolled oats in addition to the bread crumbs. Instead of shredded cheddar, I shredded Buffalo Wing style cheese I bought in Wisconsin at Mouse Haus cheese house, and then topped the meat with "What a Jerk" caribbean style jerk sauce. Oh my, what flavor! M absolutely LOVED it! He wouldn't stop raving about it. I'll definitely be doing this again (with my additions as well), but I loved this recipe with the cheese incorporation; what inspiration to use as a springboard to a great meal. Thanks, Douglas!

I come here all the time, but I created a profile so I could review this!  As others have said, I also used lean beef so that it would cut down on the grease. I used a Colby-Jack blend of pre-shredded cheese as well. My onion was actually a frozen blend I had stuck in the freezer that I thought might sound good with this that has green and red pepper and celery with it. The rolling was a cinch, but I can see where it could get messy for some. It sealed nicely, so I didn't have any spillage. I also topped it with tomato sauce. It turned out great! My 17 month old liked it, so that says something! Kudos, and I love the roll! I don't know why I never did it before!

Found it quite bland (even after adding some garlic salt and oregano). My husband said he didn't mind it, but I didn't like it, so I won't make again.

This was ok.  I think because the meat loaf part of it is thinner after rolling the cheese in it that it comes out too dry.  I'll stick with my traditional meat loaf and top with cheese.  Hubby wasn't thrilled, either and he's a cheeseburger nut.

Hmm, not so good for us...hubby liked it okay, actually he said B-, but son and I weren't so generous. It was pretty dry, I thought, and even with less than 2 cups of cheese, it was too much for us.  Can't really recommend this recipe, sorry.

I have made this recipe about three times now.  It is the only meatloaf my children will eat.  My son now calls it a favorite of his.  The only thing to keep in mind is that it takes a good while to cook through.  With my last attempt it was still very rare in the center even though the cheese was oozing out.  I think in the future I will go with 1lb of ground beef instead of two.  It will be quicker to cook and there won't be so much left over.  Great though!

This came out perfect. I mixed half of the cheese in the mixture, then I followed other reviewers suggestions by splitting the mixture into 2 layers and sandwiched the remaining cheese in between. I also made a wide shallow well on the top layer, and poured a (1/4 cup each) mixture of ketchup and brown sugar with a few drops of Worcestershire sauce blended in the mixture as a top glaze.

I made this for a large group of children for a community center program in our town and it was a HUGE hit.  They gobbled every bit of it. Made with lean ground beef and paired with "oven" fries and fresh green beans, it was pretty healthy as well.  I followed previous advice and rather than do the jelly roll, pressed half the meat into the bottom of a 13x9 pan, then used 2 cups of cheese (3 seemed too much?).  I then pressed the remaining meat into a rectangle on wax paper and turned it on top of the cheese making sure to seal edges.  Because I was baking three pans at once, I still baked it for a little over an hour, but wonder if when baking one pan less time would be required.

I cut the recipe in half and did two layers of meat with the cheese in the middle.  It was delicious! I topped it with mushrooms, ketsup and mustard.  Definitely going to make this again!

Really good. A little hard to roll but, will try a different ways next time. Husband and kids loved it. Really good with Ketchup.

I made it lasagna style too. Here are my changes: Mix in electric mixer with bread hook, then roll out each third between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Also, use mozzarella cheese for one layer and top with tomato sauce.

We didn't really care for this. I tried it with bacon once and once without. The meatloaf part tastes good, but it was just way too much cheese. Going to stick with regular meatloaf!!!

I used this recipe to make my first meatloaf, and it was GREAT! I read the other ratings/reviews, and modified this a bit. 
I used a loaf pan. And instead of rolling it, and did three different layers as you would with a lasgna.
DELICIOUS

This was my first meatloaf ever - and boy did sure end up looking like my first meatloaf too. Despite the terrible look of it (my fault), the taste was an absolute 10.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I absolutely HATE meatloaf, but this one is so good! I made this about a week ago, and am making it again tonight! I didn't have wax paper, so I used parchment and it worked perfectly!! Our 14 month old loved it too!

This was pretty good but the only thing i couldn't get over was all the grease. Plus, when I cut it the cheese would go everywhere before I could get it to the plate. I suggest waiting for it to cool a bit before cutting. Good though. Might make again to see if I can improve.

AWESOME meatloaf. This is great as is, but what makes it even better is that you can customize it with any fillings you like. Just make sure it's rolled very tight, or your cheese will seep out.

Pretty good meatloaf for a change of pace.  The cheese does add moisture but not much flavor.  Have yet to find that killer meatloaf recipe (is there such a thing?).

Instead of rolling this, I mixed everything together and put it in a bread pan. I used velveeta, which I diced into very small pieces, for half of the cheese. The 3-year-old who helped me make it said it was "the best meatloaf in town" and my 50-year-old mom liked it, but I prefer regular meatloaf. Will probably make again, though.

Loved it!  Didn't mess with rolling it up--just layered it, and squeezed a layer of ketchup on top.  Great and easy meat loaf recipe.

This was sooo good, outstanding!  I made a couple of changes...I did not roll the meat, I mixed the ingredients together, topped with bacon.  I mixed up some ketchup with brown sugar to pour over the bacon as it baked and this made it taste amazing.  The only problem I had was that it was a little too peppery.  So, next time I will use a little less pepper.  Thanks for the great recipe, it has been added to my favorites for sure!

I, like another reviewer, didn't bother with the rolling.  I put half the beef mixture in the pan, added the bacon and cheese, and topped with the other half of the beef.

Very good taste but as my husband said; "doesn't taste much different than any other meat loaf"

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was outstanding!  I did make some changes.  I used cheez it crackers instead of bread crumbs, and mexi blend cheese instead of the cheddar.  Instead of rolling it into a pinwheel, I layered the cheese, along with some sauteed onions, in the actual loaf, which turned out great.  I also put a few strips of bacon on top while it cooked.  It was mouthwatering good!

I made this for my crew on the boat, and they loved it!  Everyone on the boat ate it!!  I found it really easy to roll the meatloaf up like a "jelly roll" i put tin foil on a cutting board and put the meatloaf on it and filled it then rolled it, it didn't stick to much.....I RECOMEND PUTTING TIN FOIL ON THE PAN YOU COOK THIS IN!!

I made this just a few nights ago and my husband and I both loved it...okay well I didn't actually make this...I took the oringinal recipe, substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers, added some minced garlic, and just mixed it all together and put it in the pan.  Put BBQ sauce over the top.  My husband says it's his new favorite so I will be making this more often I'm sure.  It's a great base recipe for meatloaf, just tweak it the way you think your family would like it and go from there.

I mixed all the ingredients together, reduced cheese to one and three quarter cups and baked for an hour at 375.  It was delicious.  Even my Mom, who is not a meatloaf lover, liked it very much.

Despite my best efforts rolling it and pinching it closed, I still failed and the cheese ended up at the bottom of the dish. Also, it does need to bake longer than 1 hr, mine was in the oven for 1 1/2 hr. All in all, not the worst, but not what I expected. I won't make again.

This meatloaf was pretty good.  I don't know that it's a 5-star, but it's good.  I liked it because it's a good low-carb option for meatloaf, which isn't easy to find.  The best meatloaf I think I've had is http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Brown-Sugar-Meatloaf/Detail.aspx.  That one actually starts to taste better as a leftover.  

If you're looking for a low-carb recipe though, this is a decent tasting meatloaf for that.  Otherwise, there is better out there.

My fiance ate this with no complaints.  He's not a meatloaf lover so I consider it a good effort!  I'm still looking for the "perfect" meatloaf but in the meantime this one will do nicely.  A suggestion, though ... he insisted that I use American cheese slices.  I'd recommend that anyone use SHREDDED cheese and NOT sliced because the slices kept sliding along on the meat and didn't get rolled up inside.  That was a big reason for a lot of the leakage.  I have a feeling that would not have happened if I'd used the shredded cheese like I planned.

I wasn't sure how this was gonna come out.  I'm used to making my moms meatloaf.  This was really easy and yummy.  I liked that it looks like a jelly roll.  I drizzled some ketchup on top, that's what I do with meatloaf.And this is the quickest my son's ate meat in awhile.

This was just okay.  I liked it more than my husband did.  Seemed like it just needed something else.  I may make it again but try it with barbeque sauce on top or something to liven it up.  Also, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef since it is leaner and this is already a high-fat dish.

All in All I very Good recipe!! Its easily adaptable. I added some bacon bits and just mixed the cheese up inside (i was feeling lazy) and it tasted exactly like a cheeseburger! I mixed up a ketchup glaze with a touch of mustard in it  and it was quite tasty.  The 2nd time i did the pinwheel affect and my cheese oozed everywhere.  I'm not doing that again.  I'll definately make it again again because I always have the ingredients for this on hand for a quick dinner.

After seeing the reviews on this one, I decided to give this recipe a try....FANTASTIC!!  I made if for my family the other night and knowing how critical my dad and brothers can be, they loved it.  I used extra lean ground beef, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and as others suggested, sauteed onions and mushrooms, bacon on top with bbq sauce, it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definately make this again.

An all American classic with a pleasant twist. Added three cloves of crushed garlic and a dash of Worcestershire. My boyfriend says it's like a "cheese-meat twinky." Definitely a keeper.

I have to say that this recipe turned out better than I anticipated. One major complaint, though, LOTS of grease! Yuck! I did make a few minor changes ~ instead of cheddar cheese, I used american cheese. I also used Lipton onion soup mix in the meatloaf. Meatloaf isn't meatloaf without a glaze, in my opinion. So, I placed a mixture of brown sugar, ketchup, mustard, and honey on top of it while it baked. Yum! Even my daughter who isn't a big fan of meatloaf really enjoyed this. Oh, my husband and I took it a step further and dipped ours in *fry sauce* (recipe on the site that is a mix of mayo and ketchup) ~ wowzers, just like a cheeseburger. Served this meatloaf up with corn on the cob and baked french fries III (also from this site)! :o)

This was a bust.  It was incredibly greasy, and I didn't even use as much cheese as the recipe called for because I thought it looked like a lot.  Pass on this one.

Made this for my parents and they loved it! My dad couldn't stop saying how good it was, even had seconds. Took some of the advice and added some rosemary and thyme.  I also layered the meat then cheese and so on, and it turned out perfect!  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  The work that goes into it is given back in the taste.  The only thing I would change is the cooking time.  Had it in for the required time but the center was still not cooked.  Had to cook for an additional 35 minutes at 350.  Will be making this years to come.

I've made this meatloaf twice.  The first time I baked it in a baking dish as per the recipe, however when the it was done, the cheese had oozed out of both ends.  This time I put it in a meatloaf (bread) pan and it all stayed intact!  Very good recipe.   Mahalo!

I make this meatloaf five at a time. I cook one and freeze the other four. My family will insist this AT LEAST once a week if they know I have some in the freezer.  This meatloaf is also great for my low carb diet.

This is the first meatloaf I have ever made and it was really good. The only I would do different next time would be to add tomatoes and bell pepper. The cheese inside was great. I will definitely make this again!

A very good recipe although I made a couple of changes.  I added onion soup mix instead of the salt and pepper.  Also, I stirred in cubed fontina cheese instead of cheddar, which I find rather greasy.  This meatloaf is great the next day in sandwiches.

This was pretty good.  I wanted to make it easier so instead of rolling, I stuffed the loaf the cheese.  There was not much cheese left intact after the baking process.  Next time I will probably just add the cheese in and change the recipe a bit to add even more flavor.  It was moist though, and not too greasy.

This was excellent.  I did alter the ingredients a little.  I added cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and also some green pepper.  I only used 2 1/2 cups cheese and it turned out great.  Did put bacon on top.  I also baked it in a loaf pan and it turned out perfect. Will make again and again.

Excellent!!  This meatloaf came out great.  Very tasty.  I did follow other sugestions and top the meatloaf with ketchup and bacon.  I will make this recipe again.

This was really good--even with the ground deer I used instead of hamburger.  We're not big meatloaf eaters but the cheese helped.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have wax paper so instead I dusted a cutting board with flour to flatten the meat on-I had absolutely no trouble rolling the meat. I also pinched off the ends to prevent cheese oozing. I used Kraft american cheese slices and sliced red onion for the filling. I braised the roll lightly with ketchup.  Yummmmmm!!

We liked this meatloaf! Still haven't found a way to keep all the cheese in but using the wait time, sugggested in previous reviews, seemed to help.  I'll try a few of the variations to jazz it up a bit next time. I put a bit of brown sugar, ketchup and bacon on top before baking.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

I am not a meatloaf fan, but this recipe seemed unique and different, and I thought it might change my mind.  It didn't.  I'm sure it's a great meatloaf recipe, I'm just not a fan of meatloaf in the first place, and this tasted like meatloaf with cheese in it.  I was expecting more of a burger taste.  Thanks for giving me something new to try, though!

Good alternative to regular meatloaf.  Just have to figure out how to keep the cheese in when cutting it!!  I let it sit for about 15 mins before cutting, maybe I'll try a little longer next time.

The meatloaf has great flavor. My family loved it. The only complaint I have is that after I rolled the meatloaf up and then tried to set it in my baking dish it fell completely apart. I just made the best of it and cook it anyway.

This was an ok recipe.  I would say it is average, next time I hae to seal my ends better though and let it sit longer as the cheese likes to run.

I did not like this recipe- why go through all the trouble when you can just make yourself a cheeseburger? My husband, however, did enjoy it! I'm used to using a variety of meats in a meatloaf.

I think there was too much cheese.  I guess I just prefer regular meatloaf.

Great twist to an old favorite Doug . It is easy on the pocketbook for making.
I added some jalepanos to the cheese filling for a little spice. It was great.

this is a great rcipe.  i jazzed it up a little with some galic and cayenne and my husband and daughter loved it.  using the wax paper to roll up the meat made it quite easy to do so.

This recipe is awesome! My family lovedddd it...even the pickiest eater asked for seconds! And the smile on my husband's face let me know he's gonna expect this recipe on a regular basis!

Also it's great the next day, as well as for sandwiches.  

This recipe has already become a family favorite.

This is a really neat idea but you've got to get the roll just right or it will open up and all the cheese will melt out.  Other than that my family really enjoyed this meal.

A good meatloaf when you are in the mood for something a little differnt!!  However, I found that rolling the whole thing up was a little tricky, it helps to have another set of hands around to help!!

This is really yummy! I've tried it with cheddar & ketchup filling, and also with thinly sliced ham and swiss cheese, and both were big hits with my husband and my kids.

I followed everyone's suggestions, however, I still had some cheese run out- I would suggest not rolling it too snug.  It was a really eye appealing dish and my husband loved it.  He said it was a little dry though so next time I may cover it with foil while it is cooking or not cook it a full hour.

As usual, I can't follow a recipe to the T. I didn't like the jellyroll effect so I mixed the cheese in with the meat. I did roll it though in foil and kept the ends loose. I actually cooked it in the foil. This helped keep a round shape. I lost very little cheese and it tasted GREAT! Kids love it.

tasted just like a cheeseburger. 1 hour was  a little too long for my convection oven,
so the outside was just a little overcooked. i'm sure kids would love this recipe. next
time, i might try adding tomato sauce and less cheese.

This was very yummy. I cut the onions too big and cheese seeped out around them. The second time I made it, I didn't seal it well enough. Make sore to close it up good and mince your onions.

Wicked good.  Really simple to throw together and pretty impressive--even for meatloaf!
