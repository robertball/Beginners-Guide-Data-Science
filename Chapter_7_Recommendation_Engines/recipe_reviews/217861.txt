Quick and easy - perfect for a weeknight meal! Plus, they're a great way to use up leftover steak.  The salad kit made it very simple and the flavor combination was very tasty!

YUMMMM!  We loved these, and they were fairly easy to make.  The flavors complement each other very well.  Steak & salad inside of a portable wrap--these would be great for lunch.  I'll definitely make them again!
