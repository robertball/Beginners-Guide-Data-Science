This is the ORIGINAL Oyakodon recipe! If you can't find dashi, try putting fish stock instead of chicken. Dashi are little dryed fish turned into powder...!  By the way, did you know that "Oyako" means "Parents and Children" (in this case, chicken and eggs); don is just the word used for "rice bowl" ;)

Real crowd-pleaser here. My kids loved it. Easy to make.   To those who say that replacing the dashi with chicken stock, I feel you're missing the Japanese essence of this dish. I heartily recommend seeking out either dashi powder or, if you're feeling a little adventurous, try making your own. It's really quite easy. There are numerous recipes for dashi on this site.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I couldn't find dashi powder, so I substituted veggie stock, which worked just fine. Simple and very tasty.

Great recipe -- thank you!  If you want to be truly authentic, please use Japanese medium or short grain rice, not jasmine rice, and leave the egg slightly runny.  The texture really is quite different, both with the runnier egg and with the Japanese rice.  

Also, dashi is a light, delicious broth made from kombu (kelp) and katsuobushi (flakes of dried bonito).  It's very easy to make. You can get the ingredients, or dashi powder, at any Asian market or in the international aisle of high-end grocery stores. Dashi is NOT powdered little dried fish!

Oyakodon is one of my favorite Japanese recipe and I have tried it multiple times in an authentic Japanese restaurants in the States and Japan. Compared to those recipes provided by native Japanese home cooks on allrecipes.jp, this is a pretty nice recipe. I'd like to share how my Oyakodon turned out for those of who do not have all the ingredients written here. I used 6 pieces of chicken breast tenders, 1/2 onion, 2cups chicken stock, 1/4cup soy sauce, 3 tbsp red wine, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 4 eggs. The sauce wasn't thick enough, and I thought it was too much soy sauce. Wish I had Mirin. Although I didn't like it much, my American boyfriend loved it. I'd love to try this again with the original ingredients and also with breaded chicken cutlet (Chicken Katsudon)

in order for it to be traditional substitute jasmine rice for japonica, jasmine is long grain rice usually used in Thailand, japonica is short grain and much stickier and usually comes from Japan or Korea. 

Aside from that, this recipe is amazing and tastes almost like my grand mother used to make me

This is a good recipe for Oyakodon.  However, if you really want to make it authentic Japanese, you will have to use Japanese short grain rice.  We never use Jasmine rice in Japanese dishes because the texture is not right and the aroma doesn't mix with the flavors of other ingredients well.  Other than that, the recipe is a good solid one!

This is a delicious rice bowl.   This is not soup as it may appear if you skim read the recipe which I am often guilty of.  It was a wonderful Japanese dish of jasmine rice topped with chicken and egg.  The final addition of the broth brings it together which such a wonderful flavour.  I didn't have dashi powder so I used chicken broth as the other reviewers suggested.  I also did not have Japanese rice wine so I substituted the rice wine vinegar I had on hand.

This is a great recipe!  I substituted chicken with beef (called Tanindon - "Tanin" means "unrelated" because egg and beef are not related to each other!). I also added spinach and mushroom.

This dish was such a success! I HIGHLY recommend finding the dashi powder. It's what gives this dish it's authentic flavor and if you're not using it you are missing out. I don't keep wine in the house so I  used rice wine vinegar instead. Soooo tasty! I can't wait to make this for friends.

Awesome! Looks kind of goofy in the pan but tastest heavenly. It is perfect as is - however if you are pressed for time / ingredients, consider making the broth with packets of veggies and soy out of packaged udon soup. It has a pretty good flavor too, and you can eat the oyakodon over the udon!

1st let me say there are three ingredients that I do not eat as is: 1) tomatoes 2) mushroom 3) eggs, and it's the eggs that make this recipe so special to me.

I made this dish tonight for my girlfriend who lived in Japan and told me this was one of her favorite dishes.

I got thumbs up not only from her, I got thumbs up for the pic from her friends in Japan.....even our children ate it and this is not the norm!

I made a few adjustments:
I used 3 eggs instead of four
I used 6 chicken thighs instead of four
I made my own dashi stock using dried seaweed and bonito flakes (chicken stock just wont do).
...and I added snap pees for color.

I made according to recipe, ordering the hard to find ingredients online. But it came out too sweet for my taste. If I make it again, I will reduced the brown sugar to half. I also prefer a dish with more veggies.

Delicious! Dashi is not expensive and totally makes this dish. Worth searching for. This recipe is a keeper, especially since my daughter can make it. When your kids cook for you, it tastes even better!

Fascinating combination of flavors. I loved it and will make it again. It sounded so good reading the recipe I just had to get real Dashi to make this. I had to order it via the internet....and I got plenty!!! This stuff is potent and a little goes a long way. After tasting the plain Dashi stock I am convinced there is NO substitute. I'm also sure there are MANY other good uses for Dashi and am searching.

In any case I suggest making this exactly as the recipe calls for, at least the first time.

I almost always tweak recipes, but this one is brilliant exactly as written.  Very authentic. The dashi stock is an absolute MUST as there just is no substitute flavor-wise; I can't stress this point strongly enough!!  A few thinly shaved scallions on top and one last touch of salt/soy sauce to taste finishes this dish off perfectly.  The jasmine rice works, but I do still prefer the more traditional short grain.  Thank you for this recipe!  Delicious!

Great recipe, except for the Jasmine rice. Use Calrose instead. When we make this, we rehydrate dried shiitake mushrooms and use the soaking water for part of the dashi. It gives it a boost of flavor. Then slice the shiitakes (discarding the stems) along with some bamboo shoots and add with the onions when cooking. My mom was born and raised in Japan. As a child, this was one of my favorite dishes. I still enjoy it today.

The real deal!  A friend who grew up in japan recently made this for me.  This recipe tasted excactly like his! I personally like it more soupy, so i doubled everything except for the chicken, onion, and egg.

I've always been a fan of oyakodon at Japanese resturants around town. Its good to know that its so easy to make! I was short on eggs at the moment, so I added about 1/4 cup milk to the egg mixture and it turned out very nice and fluffy! Again, I did not have dashi stock, so I simply used chicken stock. I also added a bit of garlic into the mix for added taste. Overall, this recipe is great and an awesome before or after workout meal!

The recipe did not explain how to make the dashi stock so   I made it using one packet of bonito flavored seasoning from   Shimaya.  Came out just like the restaurants!

It's delicious. However, If you want to go for spectacular, I suggest you don't scramble the eggs. Instead when your dish is almost done add in 4 eggs unscrambled and let it cook or poach for two more minutes. 
Serve it over white rice and pop the yolk when you're going to eat it. The egg yolk added to the dashi makes it taste so good, so rich, and so slap ya mama good as carla hall would say.

Currently making this and it smells delicious! Didn't have chicken or dashi so substituted with paddlefish (hubby and I caught and froze 3 weeks ago) and chicken stock. Can't wait to try it!

I made this as the recipe stated assuming the dashi to water ratio is one tsp per cup and it tasted kind of bland.  I also thought it had too much rice.  Next time I'll use one cup of rice, double the dashi ratio and add some japanese curry powder.

Exactly what I wanted! Thanks!
I used cubed leftover chicken and leftover chicken stock, had no wine but red so I used a splash of grape juice. Probably not what the original tastes like at all, but it was great for a starter idea for our supper.

This is one of my favorite Japanese dishes and it tasted just like the real thing, even without dashi. I've never eaten this with jasmine rice so I went with short grain brown rice and it was perfect.

Very good and deceptively easy!  Nice savory and slightly sweet flavour.  The Jasmine rice is a real plus to this.  I will definitely make this again!

I used Japanese sticky rice instead of jasmine rice and added sliced mushrooms with an aloha pepper for added veggies. Japanese cuisine does rely on veggies so the added ingredients do a great job making it a filling meal.

This came out perfectly the first time we made it! I've tried making it since then, substituting chicken breast for the thigh. I don't recommend doing that, however, because the result was much blander and less juicy. I recommend sticking with the thighs as the recipe calls for. We looked up substitutions for mirin. We used cooking sherry in this recipe. Outstanding meal and highly recommended!

This is fairly authentic. I have all the Japanese ingredients but concur with other reviewers who say use short grained japonica rice. Most grocery stores carry it these days. Also keep the eggs runny (makes it creamier & eggs cook a bit after adding to hot rice), but not all like that. Good recipe for children as is since it's a bit bland, but can be flavored up. Fish stock can be over powering. Personal preference: I don't care for a sweet broth and pre-packaged dashi already is a tad sweet so I omit the sugar.  You should taste test the broth for your liking. I use shrimp and delicate vegetables too, green onion on top. Dashi IS dried bonito ( a type of tuna) flakes mixed with kelp and powdered, so those with seafood allergies might have a problem. Trace amounts, but still. Glad to see this recipe as I haven't made it in a long time. Thanks!

Thanks for the recipe. It turned out great. I added a little more soy sauce and less brown sugar because I prefer a slightly more savory taste. I also added chopped shiitake mushrooms and flavored the eggs with curry powder for more flavor punch. Lastly, I topped it with a pinch of furikake. Itadakemasu!

This dish is so good! I love making Japanese food. The first one I’ve tried was tanin don. This is probably THE best Japanese dish I’ve ever made! It’s definitely comparable to some Japanese restaurants. The hubby is so picky when it comes to any sort of Asian food, but he absolutely loves this dish!

Prepared as written and was very tasty. Next time,  I'll follow the advice of others to use Japenese short rice.

My only critique is that I wish it had a little heat to go with the sweetness. I'm Texan; so everything needs a little heat.

This is such a bomb recipe! My family and I came back from a month long trip to Japan recently and we were missing the food like crazy! But due to construction going on at the house we didn't have full access to the kitchen so we looked up an easy Japanese recipe and found this. Super delicious!

The first time I followed the instructions exactly as they were written. The second time I set the yolks off to the side instead of mixing them with the whites, and I cut up some green onions for garnish. It tasted it even better!

This is definitely a recipe that I'll be coming back to time and time again. Amazing flavor and super easy to make.
Thanks!!

Delicious and easy (though time consuming). I made dashi stock from scratch because I couldn't find it locally. I followed the recipe almost exactly and the results are awesome. It took almost 10 minutes to cook most of the pink from the chicken, but then you saute it with the onions and then the stock for 15 minutes so undercooking the chicken isn't likely. Following another reviewer's suggestion, I only cooked the egg for 3 minutes so it stayed creamy and fluffy.

Found this recipe here about a year ago and been using it regularly since. Family favorite and easy to put together when you need a quick meal. If no dashi or chicken stock, can use Miso. Just add a bit of Miso paste to the water. :) Thanks for a delicious recipe!!!

This was delicious and easy to make, though next time I will double the broth as most of it seemed to evaporate while simmering as my stove-top has a high-heat simmer. I suggest adding a vegetable like sauteed carrots, and seasoning it with garlic or curry powder. I had to substitute in chicken stock for the dashi as my family is allergic to seafood and white wine instead of mirin (it was all I had) but it was still wonderful and I will definitely make this again.

We eat this dish quite often. It is simple, nourishing and filling.  I always use real dashi stock but sometimes add a small piece of konbu for extra flavor.  I also use baked tofu instead of ham due to family dietary habits, but it is equally tasty either way.

This is wonderful, and is in regular rotation at our house. I pair it with a simple green veggie, like roasted broccoli, peas, or cucumbers tossed with seasoned rice vinegar.

I've made this dish now 3 times. It's very simple. easy to follow. Best of all one of my Japanese friends told me it tasted amazingly authentic-even better than some restaurants she's been to. This is a recipe I'll be using for years to come!

Quick and easy recipe.  I used 1 tablespoon of sugar only and it was still sweet.  Great flavors and the kids loved it.

This was incredible, and I didn't even have any dashi.  Normally I have some miso or dashi miso on hand, but I had to use chicken broth this time.  I halved the brown sugar, as my mirin is pretty sweet already.  For soy sauce, I only ever use Tamari, unless the recipe specifically calls for light shoyu or some other weird variety.  I also used Tsuru Mai brown rice instead of the jasmine, made in the rice cooker.  

After it was dished up, the people that like spicy food sprinkled some Nanami Togarashi on it for a little kick.

My guess is that this might actually freeze quite well after being dished up.  If so, it would be great for quick lunches/dinners.

very nice recipe!  very simple and straightforward to make... it just tasted a tad bit sweet so maybe i'll put less brown sugar and a dash of salt next time round.

I made this for an international fellowship that I attend (cooking for 120, on a regular basis!)...one of the Japanese attendees said "it tasted like home".  If that is not a great review of this recipe...what is????  It is really very  easy, even for a crowd!  LOVE IT!!!!!

This was super easy to make and totally tastes like the real deal! You can garnish with scallions, or shredded nori or even fish cake (kamaboko).  I bought my hondashi from the Asian market in granule form.  The jar lasts forever and you only need 1/2 tsp per cup of water.

I didn't have dashi stock, so I used chicken stock instead (it was all I had). Turned out really salty-flavored. Eggs were also a disturbing mush of grey color, but pretty sure that's unavoidable given you toss them into the mixture to cook. Husband liked it. I thought the chicken ended up tasting like fish somehow and was a bit weirded out by it. Usually love Japanese foods, so I'm assuming I did something wrong (aside from using the chicken stock).

Tastes great, but it's much too sweet and personally it was too much soup as it doesn't really reduce.  I'd cut back to 1tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 cup dashi stock (used half a tbsp dashi powder for it), and it's perfect.  I also pan fried the chicken pieces with some salt and white pepper for a bit more flavour.  Top with some green onions and serve.

Yum! I added some zucchini and had to use chicken stock and a little hoi sin instead of dashi. Super easy and turns out great!

Very simple and authentic dish (aside from the type of rice, use Japanase short grain).  Dahsi is pretty key to the flavor but if you can't find it chicken bouillon would do, chicken broth would be too light.  
It does run a bit sweet but still very good and will make again without modifications.

i thought i'd try this because it sounded good and we like Japanese food. I'm not Japanese and rarely attempt to the cook the food. But this came out delicious -and quickly became on of our favorites. i now make it every time I have leftover chicken and need something quick. It's sort of a Japanese comfort food and easy to make. Made it for guests one day and they raved over it. Once you purchase
the ingredients for your pantry, this recipe is a whiz to put together.

It was pretty close to what I ate all the time in Japan and since it was my favorite food then, it's still available to me as my favorite food now.

This was very quick and easy! I substituted Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base for the Dashi Power (because I couldn't make it to the Asian market and it was not at the local grocery) and I also substituted Bragg's Liquid Amino for the soy sauce because it tastes the same and has MUCH less sodium. I look forward to making it again using the dashi powder.

This is a great recipe. I follow it exactly as written, occasionally omitting the onion if I don't have on hand. The ultimate comfort food, my kids request it during finals time!

This was good, flavor spot on!  As written works but you really can cut a few steps out, chicken ends up being cooked twice as long as  needed.  I love this dish!  The ultimate, grey day I don't feel good meal, better then chicken soup!
