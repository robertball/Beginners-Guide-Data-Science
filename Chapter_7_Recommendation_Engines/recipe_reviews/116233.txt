My husband and I love this recipe.  It's extremely easy and very tasty.  I didn't include the jalapeno because I don't like them and it tasted great.  I definitely recommend this one.

The salsa really makes this recipe. Even my hubbie, who typically likes his meat unaccompanied, thoroughly enjoyed it. The sauce made a nice glaze for the pork and flavorwise, was a great tie in for the salsa. If it's too hot to turn your oven on for this one, get your bbq to temperature using an oven thermometer and roast it on the top rack with the lid down. Turned out great. Overall a very good recipe and one we will make again.

Really liked the glaze and pork was good and tender, I just didn't like the salsa with it. Will make again but with pork chops using the mustard, ginger and brown sugar in the slow cooker. Thanks.

This was very delicious and pretty on the plate with the yellow pineapple and red peppers. I just wish I would have followed the instructions on foil lining the baking pan first. Baked in a glass baking dish without foil, and am still soaking and scraping my baking dish two days later :)

This could not have turned out better.  What an incredible dish.  Trying not to eat all the Pineapple Salsa before the meat was done was a feat in itself.  The mustard/brown sugar and ginger mixture adds a delicious "coating" to the meat.  I have to stop and get more pork this weekend...

Quick, Easy, Awesome!  Sometimes I just use glaze on thee pork with no salsa.  One of the best glazes ever!

I served this to a large party of 35 and everyone loved it. I have the pork and pineapple salsas before I found this recipe on here but the glaze on top tied it all together!

Excellent. I added just a touch of rice wine vinegar to the salsa though to counter the sweetness of the pineapple, red pepper and brown sugar.

One of the best meats/dinners I've fixed from AR.  This tenderloin was delicious on the grill with the brown sugar, dijon mustard and fresh ginger.  The pineapple salsa just help put it over the top in our house.  We had friends over for dinner and he said if he had to choose a "last meal" that he would want me to cook this for him!  Guess that means he liked it too.  The rest of his family liked it too, just not as much as their dad and husband.  Thanks Pat for sharing this recipe.  It will be made a time or two again while it's still grilling season and look forward to trying in the oven this winter.

I am going to use this recipe for some nice dolphin filets I have, "Mahi" to some of you who have never lived or fished for dolphin the fish.
Think it will be an excellent combo, just love this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

We love this recipe!!!  My hubby is not too fond of sweet salsas but he enjoys this one.  For those of you who forgot the foil....simply place pan to soak with 1 or 2 automatic dishwasher detergent squirts or tablets & a little water.  Leave over night & the baked on mess will come right off next day.

I did not use the basting sauce for the meat with this, but instead grilled the pork tenderloin and then basted it with teriyaki sauce during the last couple minutes.  I did, however, make the salsa, and it was soooooooo good!  I will be making the salsa again and again, both with pork and just for a light summer snack.  I know, I know, I gave it 5 stars and didn't follow the recipe exactly (and that drives everyone on here crazy), but this salsa is too good to pass up, and served over pork it was amazing!

I made and served this to guests and it was an instant hit!  The salsa was delicious, even though I omitted the jalapeno peppers and opted for a pinch of cayenne. I will definitely be making this again...and again - provided that I don't eat all the salsa beforehand.

This was very good, especially the salsa.  I omitted the cilantro, as I didnâ€™t have any, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We grilled this outside and brushed the glaze on during the last ten minutes.  Pork pairs beautifully with pineapple so I knew we were going to like this and the presentation is beautiful.

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have a tenderloin, just some tenderloin cutlets so I used those.  I was afraid the glaze was going to be way too sweet, but the ginger and dijon spiced it up so nice.  I even made an extra batch to "dip" the meat in.  For the last five minutes, I put the meat under the broiler and flipped it halfway through.  Leave the oven door open a crack so the meat doesn't overcook.  I made the "salsa" as a small fruit/veggie salad.  My husband said this recipe is definitely a "keeper".

Wow!! I will definitely put this in my regular meal rotation!  Made the recipe as written, and I wouldn't change a thing.  My daughter, who will probably grow up to be a food critic said "this is the best pork tenderloin you've ever made!"  I made some homemade tortilla chips to scoop up more of that yummy salsa, which was also a big hit.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was wonderful!  I love fresh ginger, so I used more than was called for.  I did think it needed a sauce of some sort, especially since I served it with rice - that's probably easy to find though.  Thanks for the recipe!

good recipe. The marinade on the pork is subtle. Salsa is fresh, I didn't have green onions, so I subbed with red and I didn't have red pepper so I added Mango, it was still tasty.

I have made this twice now.  Everyone has loved it.  My husband and I could live on the salsa.  It's such a great combo of fresh ingredients.  I served it over rice and it was great that way.

I loved this recipe. I skipped the jalapeno and added yellow and orange peppers with the red. The combination of brown sugar, peppers and pineapple was great!

My 15 year old son and I made this yesterday for our family. I had to separate some of the salsa to make sure we had some left for supper - it was great with tortilla chips! We LOVED both the pork and the salsa. It was so simple to make, in fact my son made the salsa himself. I cooked the tenderloin on the BBQ and used the glaze during the last 10 minutes so it wouldn't flare up on the grill. Looking forward to doing this in the oven during the winter!

This will be a regular meal in our house from now on. Thanks for posting a simple but delicious recipe!

just had to rave about this recipe!  Even my kids ate it and kept asking for more-had to leave out the cilantro, added parsley instead for them.  Thanks!

Tasty, but nothing to rave over. I probably won't make it again. I liked the pork better without the salsa actually. Though i really liked the salsa, just preferred it on its own with a spoon!

Family thought this was ok but not a 'keeper'.Didn't feel the glaze stayed with the pork after baking. Salsa was good, (I've made a similar one for grilled tilapia.)

My oven is on the fritz at the moment, so I diced the pork, marinated it in the mustard/sugar/ginger for a couple of hours, threaded it onto skewers, and cooked them on the Foreman grill. The only other change I made was to up the amount of cilantro. Good stuff. Thanks, Pat!

Delish! In my salsa I substituted  red onion for the green onion, parsley for cilantro and added 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar.

Delicious! The contrasting flavors between the pork tenderloin and the brown sugar and the mustard with just a hint of ginger, combined with the sweetness and heat of the pineapple salsa, was fantastic. So many different flavors!

GREAT recipe. I changed the salsa a bit - I added mangoes and kiwis but chickened out of the jalapeno (my boyfriend and I are wimps about spicy food!). The red pepper was enough to offset the sweetness and make the salsa a great pair for the tenderloin.

The pork tenderloin recipe was exceptional.  Loved how it browned on the top slightly but stayed nice and moist.  I really liked the idea of the pineapple salsa but felt exactly the same as another reviewer - it detracted from the flavors of the pork and seemed to be a mismatch.  I may try the salsa again but I will try it with a fresh mango vs. pineapple.  The pork is a keeper and I will make that again and again.  My husband loved it!

Excellent, loved the pork.  I seared the pork on all sides first then topped with the sauce before putting in the oven.   Added pressed garlic and juice of a lime to the salsa and omitted the brown sugar in the salsa. I will make this again.

Love this recipe!  My 9 year old son loved it, also.  Hubby told me I knocked it out of the park.  I put it on the grill. Made the salsa to go with it.  It's good, but next time I think I will just grill up some pineapple instead of the salsa.

I made the PINEAPPLE SALSA and LOVED IT! I actually paired it with pork tenderloin seasoned with a chili powder, cumin, salt & pepper then spread with apple jelly. Oh my it was great!

This was fabulous! I actually served the salsa as a side dish with the tenderloin. I made the salsa ahead of time and put in the refrigerator. I did not want to put cold salsa on the pork. It was great on the side. The meat was so flavorful it did not need anything on top! This is a keeper!
