Easy Soup. I didn't want to toss out all the yummy veggies so I left them in.. used fat free cream cheese as that was in fridge. I used a salt that had thyme lemon and bay in it, fresh cracked rainbow peppercorns and added some garlic. Nice soup. Kept rice separate so leftovers wouldn't soak up the broth

We had this for dinner tonight.  Wonderful! Added onions, carrots, celery. Followed recipe and loved the results., especially on a snowy Chicago evening.   Cream cheese was a nice surprise finish.

This recipe is pretty classic, but when I made it I left out the cream cheese, used wild rice, added 2 medium diced tomatoes, and some curry powder and it was pretty fantastic. Turned out like gumbo. I also put all my vegetables in at once and just left everything in the pot, took out and sliced the boiled chicken, and threw it back in. Great stuff:)

This is my recipe. The original calls for adding the carrots and turnip with the green beans and rice (discarding only the celery and onion from the broth). But as others have stated, you can leave them in if you chop them first.

I made this recipe for a friend who is undergoing chemotherapy so I added extra vegetables (celery, carrots, and extra green beans) and kept it bland per her request. It was really good, the cream cheese makes this soup different and we really enjoyed it (after adding additional seasonings to our portion).

Loved this soup, but changed the cooking directions slightly. Cut the chicken into pieces, saut√©ed them in olive oil. Then I added all the veggies, cooking for about 5 minutes before adding water and then a couple Tablespoons of chicken better than Bullion. Used uncle bens pre cooked brown rice. So yummy. Even my picky kids loved it. Will make this again.

i used this recipe to clean out the half bags of vegetables in my freezer and the left-over chicken from a Whole Foods roasted chicken.  Oh, and a bag of Trader Joe's frozen brown rice so it went together really quickly.  Adding the cream cheese is a nice touch and a taste change.  Not too creamy - just a bit more substantial.   Will make it again...

Tastes great, and it's very easy - especially when you cheat!  I chopped the onion and celery and then didn't strain it out after cooking the chicken.  Omitted the turnip, as I didn't have one.  Added 2 cups of thawed frozen mixed veggies (carrots and peas) when adding the chopped chicken back into the mixture, and used 1 1/2 cups of leftover cooked brown rice instead of the instant rice (note - I don't think cooked white would hold up to being recooked).  Yum!

So easy and delicious!  We just use whatever veggies we have on hand.  Tonight I had pattypan squash, zucchini, yellow squash, and onion.  In the past it has been carrot, onion celery.  You really can use whatever you have, this will always be good!  We've made it with the cream cheese and thought it was too rich so we replaced the cheese with cream of chicken soup.  So great for fall cooking!

SO good!  I always go rogue with spices and this was no exception, but it is a great recipe no matter how you spice it up!  Love the creaminess!

I've made this recipe with or without the cream cheese.  Tasty either way!
