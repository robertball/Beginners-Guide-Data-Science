A little different from our usual chicken dishes and flavorful I thought it was very good but my husband just thought it was ok. I cut the chicken breast into half pounded them to a uniform thickness to quicken cooking time brined them and lightly floured before saut√©ing in the butter.

This has been a staple for my boys growing up. You can also use chicken cut "nugget" size. I often served over rice. A healthy substitute is using plain greek yoghurt in place of the sour cream. When making to serve over rice you may want to thin it a little with milk.:-)

Added some red pepper and it made it a prettier color with the onions!

Delicious!! I seasoned the chicken with some seasoned salt and black pepper before adding the wine. It came out perfect. My daughter doesn't like sauces so she ate the chicken without the sour cream sauce and she said it was delicious and that I should cook chicken like this more often.

I tried it as indicated. Cream curdled and the taste of the onions was overpowering.

Very good and simple to make. Suggest adding mushrooms and serving with noodles.

This will now be a staple in our kitchen. I will have to keep white wine on hand not my favorite but it is very well worth it. Yummy way to make chicken!

Very Keto diet friendly. We used chicken thighs for more fat.
