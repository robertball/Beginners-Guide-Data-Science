This salad is a favorite with everyone.  I've even added cheese and sunflower seeds to it and there's never enough left at the bottom of the bowl for lunch the next day!  Absolutely wonderful and simple.

This dressing is wonderful. After tasting the salad made as the recipe suggests, I added red onion, celery and red grapes. This more closely resembled the flavors in my Red Broccoli salad posted on this site. Very good Marsha!

This is good for a side dish salad, but not for the whole meal. I've seen variations of this which always include more ingredients. This could use something more.

Needs something else like cheddar cheese, cherry tomatoes. Liked it just need some other veggies. Used real bacon bits to speed things up.

This is best if you add some cubed sharp cheddar cheese, and maybe a little chopped red onion.  :)

This is a tasty salad and very quick to throw together. I chose this recipe as part of a soup and salad supper, mostly because I had all the ingredients on hand (I don't usually have iceberg lettuce around, but may buy it more often just to make this salad.) The dressing was a little sweet for my taste, but that may have been my vinegar, which was white wine vinegar. I added a little extra vinegar and some salt and pepper. I loved the crispy bacon with the sweetness of the dressing. I might add some matchstick carrots next time for some added crunch and color. Thanks for a very tasty recipe!

I have not tried this particular salad, but I have made the dressing to use in other salads.  To this one I would add some radishes cut into bite size pieces.  I am not a radish fan, but have found I really like them using this salad.  As for too many calories -- moderation is always the key.  Thanks for the recipe.

excellent.  used splenda and reduced fat mayo for the dressing and it was still fantastic.  also used a bag and a half of iceberg lettuce instead of messing around with washing and tearing an actual head of lettuce.

Since I have access to a refrigerator at work, this is a frequent lunch choice.  So good and easy!  Would also be good for potlucks as it's a bit different.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Fiance said this was one of the best salads he’s ever had & he doesn’t like mayonnaise much. I did use Miracle Whip in place of the mayonnaise though. Served this with Balsamic-Glazed pork tenderloin & Rice-a-Roni long grain & wild rice.

No matter how much vinegar and sugar I added, the mayonnaise taste never left.  I followed the recipe verbatim so I'm not sure what the others did to make it get such a high rating.

excellent - we loved the crunch of broccoli  with lettuce--  I added sliced carrotts,red onion and sunflower seeds. I cut this down and  made it  for 2. I only used 1 sliced of bacon and it gave  the salad  plenty of flavor ..I will make again for sure

This is my favorite salad.  sometimes I add red onion if I have one.  Better if it sits in the fridge over night.

I've made this salad before, making only half the dressing along with a splash of milk to thin it just a bit.  I also halve the bacon, who needs an entire pound of bacon in their salads?!?  Doing this will cut the fat and calories, but retain all the flavors that make this salad so yummy.  Adding some red onion, peppers, cukes, tomaotes, etc. is also delicious.

My family is from Pennslyvania and I ate this salad for Sunday dinner for many years, usually with a beef roast and mashed potatoes.  My mom called it just Slaw without the broccoli.  It has that sweet and sour taste typical of the Amish.  It never was a favorite but seeing it brings back good memories of Sunday dinners.

Great dressing and such a simple salad... didn't have enough bacon for a full pound and I used green leaf lettuce instead of iceberg. I sprinkled bacon onto the individual salads and drizzled the dressing on. Wonderful flavor - great way to eat your veggies!

I made this recipe recently and it was delicious. I made a few modifications based on other reviews. I used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. I also used real salad bacon bits to save time and added in some shredded cheese.  This salad would be good with cashews or sunflower seeds, craisins, and red onion. My teenage son even toiled the salad and he NEVER eats salad.

Great recipe because the dressing works with whatever vegetables you chose and because you can vary it with fruit and seeds/nuts.  I've had this dish at almost every summer gathering and always wondered how to make the dressing - Thank you!

This salad is amazing!  I used liquid stevia instead of sugar. I also added shredded cheese and diced tomato. It tasted a lot like a BLT.
