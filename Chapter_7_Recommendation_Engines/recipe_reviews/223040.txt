This recipe rocks!  I've had the flu for a few days now and made this recipe earlier today.  It is so good, and the ginger is great for the tummy problems.  I doubled the recipe and made it with a whole chicken instead of breasts, I think it gives much better flavor to the broth.
Besides that, I only added more celery because I love it.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great tasting soup, especially when one has a cold. Every time one of my kids has a cold, I make chicken soup. Saw this one while browsing today and thought it would be a perfect cold-buster. Not only did both of my kids (sick) love it and eat multiple helpings, my husband and I (healthy) thought it was awesome too. I did scale back the ginger and garlic by not adding it at the end because I figured my daughter wouldn't appreciate it - she did say it was a little ginger strong - but I thought a bit more would have been a perfect finish. One thing I changed was I used 2/3 chicken "Better than Bullion" and 1/3 beef "Better than Bullion" because it was what I had on hand. Still was quite tasty and will make it again.

Absolutely loved this soup! I added shredded cabbage, thighs instead of breasts and four kaffir lime leaves. If I had cold symptoms, they're gone now.

As far as chicken soup goes, this is one of the best I've ever tasted. Normally I feel like chicken soup is either much too bland and watery, or way too salty. This one isn't salty at all but instead has a nice, fairly powerful ginger and rosemary flavor. The recipe as written makes a huge batch of soup. My husband and I each had a bowl for dinner, my baby had a baby-sized bowl, I froze half of the remaining batch in ice cube trays to serve my son for lunch in the future, and there is still plenty for at least a day or two of lunches for me and my husband.

Made this for my sick husband who absolutely loved it. I used a rotisserie chicken instead starting with raw chicken breasts, but everything else was the same as the recipe. He said his cold symptoms seemed to subside enough to be able to fall asleep. He had some for breakfast the next day and said it tasted even better than the day before. I highly recommend for the sick and the healthy. Very tasty soup!

I liked the flavor the ginger added and the soup in general felt healthy (I'm currently battling a cold). I did find the soup had a bit too much lemon, so I might cut that down next time. That said, I've never put lemon in soup and did like what it added to the soup. Would definitely make this again. I made the following changes: I halved the recipe, used chicken thighs (with bones as my mom says the bones add flavor to the soup) instead of breasts, used black pepper instead of peppercorns, omitted the celery, kohlrabi, herbs, and noodles, added paprika and cumin, didn't remove the garlic (I did slice it before adding to the soup), and let it simmer for about 2 hours total.

The wine, lemon, and probably the ginger too, is just too overpowering. I couldn't taste anything else.

This soup is awesome!  My entire family loved it!  I made only a few changes: did not use kohlrabi as my grocer did not carry it, used Demerara sugar in place of white sugar, and I substituted Chicken Broth for the bouillon and water.  I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe!!! I  loved it!!!The only modification I made is i did not use olive oil, in my opinion it ruins the taste of the chicken soup. I used a small amount of chicken broth instead or butter. I also cook the noodles separate and add them as I serve the soup, otherwise the noodles soak up a lot of liquid. 
Some times instead of noodles I add matzo balls, which I cook in advance, using matzo ball package instructions.

A rare, beautiful, perfect-as-is recipe.  I use raw honey in place of sugar and greatly increase the amount of ginger and garlic added at the end, but those are personal preferences, not necessities.

Truly phenomenal tasting soup. I use chicken thighs and strain the whole thing after the chicken is done, before adding in the final vegetables. Perfection! The best medicine you'll ever taste!

This is a 5-star recipe as written - very comforting during a cold!  I cut the recipe back to 6 servings when I made it and added a tablespoon of honey, which I thought complimented the other ingredients really nicely :)

I had trouble finding the kohlrabi so I substituted it with parsnips. Nevertheless, everything else was the same and it came out great! Me and my boyfriend have been battling a cold all week, it instantly brought some color back to our faces! AWESOME!!

Awesome, flavorful and definitely works. I leave out the wine and sugar because those aren't good for colds. I leave out the kohlrabi too because it's hard to find. And I use organic chicken broth in stead of water and add extra garlic cause it's yummy : ) Make it every time I'm sick and it knocks out and cold/flu symptoms lickety split!

Perfect! I didn't add the celery, not a big fan. I also doubled the chicken and used roasted minced garlic!! The ginger is perfect and not at all overwhelming, doubling the chicken and the noodles made this a hearty main dish!!

I have made this several times and like this version of it best: cut the lemon juice in half, use chicken broth vs. the water/bouillon combo. I omit the kohlrabi just b/c I usually don't have one.  It really works to help with a cold but great any time!

I don't know if I did something wrong but my mother didn't like it. Decided to make cause she had a cold. And I drained the first set of ingredients and added potatoes at the end. She said it had a rubbery taste to it. She just drank the liquid.

Made if for my sick son. It’s delicious. The recipe ask for maybe a bit much lemon juice as it was a tiny bit too sour. Also prep time with all the fresh ingredients and herbs took much longer than it shows. The prep pretty much took me close to an hour. It is however worth it

This soup was very good.  Of course as we all know, changes were made. I used chicken stock instead of water n chicken cubes. Added some Worcestershire sauce, added rashes, and didn’t add sugar. I also put in quite a few chicken necks n bone in thighs with some chicken tenders instead of breasts. I used butter for browning instead of oil. I chopped the garlic up and left it in the pot with chopped onions in the beginning with the chicken browning for flavor. Added salt half way through, pulled out the meat, cut it up and put it all back in while discarding the thigh bones. Left the necks in for flavor/ hubby likes to suck the meat out of them. Added little more salt towards the end after tasting. I used half a cup of lemon juice. Put carrots, parsley in as well. Left the whole pot high simmering for about three hours to blend all the flavors. Definitely could smell/ taste the ginger but we like ginger so it was fine by us. Used a enamel cast iron Dutch oven for cooking. Very pleased with its turn out. Also CAST IRON IS THE WAY TO GO ??

Was really looking forward to eating this soup.  I followed the recipe and it was overwhelmed with sour.   I think the wine snd lemon was a mistake.  The ginger disappeared, in fact everything disappeared in the sour taste.  Very disappointing!  Wish there was a way to salvage it.

My first attempt at homemade chicken soup and it was a HIT. Thanks for the recipie! I used 4 split chicken breasts and removed the skin and bones after simmering for a while, and then shredded and chopped the meat before adding back to the pot. I wonder how this affects thr nutritional info since I'm logging everything that goes down the hatch.  Also wonder what the serving size actually is..1, 2 or 3 cups...

Wonderful when you're sick or not. Since we're all sick in this house I thought I'd try it. Definitely worth it!

My daughter woke up sick with a cold, so I came across this recipe and decided to give it a go after reading the reviews.  I do agree with folks that said it was too lemony. I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion.   Also, I used 4 skinless chicken thighs instead of the breasts, and returned the bones to simmer along with the veggies.  I used white rice instead of noodles. My husband would not eat it (and he is not a picky eater normally), but my daughter LOVED it.  I will definitely make this again, but I will cut the fresh lemon juice to 1/4 cup.

Great soup, and it really is good when you're sick. My favorite way to make it is to use a whole chicken and make fresh broth, but I've also used chicken breast and chicken base or canned broth and it still comes out good. I always substitute radishes for the kohlrabi because I can never find that at the store, and I cut down the broth to about 10 cups because I just prefer less broth. Last time I made it, I didn't have fresh ginger or herbs (used powdered and dried) or peppercorns (used ground black pepper) or egg noodles (used macaroni). It wasn't as good as usual without the fresh ingredients, but still good. A definite keeper I'll make again and again.

Great recipe as we love ginger!  I will make this again but next time will reduce the amount of lemon juice - it was a bit overpowering.  Also the kohlrabi did not add  any value - I will skip this next time too.  They are too hard to peal off the outer shell - plan to double check the nutritional value to see if this is worth the effort. I also did not brown the chicken breasts, remove them & put them back in - this seemed like a waste of time & effort.  I usually use thighs as they have more flavor - simply baked them in the oven while I chopped & mixed everything else - I added the chicken before the carrots, celery, etc.  Looking forward to this soup warmed up again tonight!

Rosemary, thyme and cinnamon should never been a part of this.  I have made many recipes from this website with great success and this id the first time that I have made a negative comment.

Just made this soup. It's awesome! I used half of a large rotisserie chicken. Hope it knocks out this cold!

So delicious! Used about 5 cubes and then used a soup mix as well for more flavor.  Added hot sauce too. 5 stars!

Definitely one of the most delicious soups I've ever prepared!  I left out the kohlrabi, but stuck to the recipe other than tweaking the spices to my preference. Love this!

This was better the first time I made it; but this time it was too lemony.  I will reduce the lemon next time!

Did not particularly care for the combination of ginger with thyme and rosemary. Will not make again.
