This is one recipe where it really pays to read peoples reviews. As so many other people said, it's entirely too much salt. I used only a pinch of sea salt. I also used a sharp cheddar cheese in addition to the American. I found Ritz crackers were tastier than the croutons, and adding a 1/4 cup of half-and-half to the soup and cheese mix made it a bit creamier. Overall, a very good casserole, just remember a small pinch of salt is all it needs. Enjoy!

Very good.  I've tried 2 other broccoli casserole recipes from this website and this one is by far the best.  Unlike the other recipes, this once calls for fresh broccoli, which by far is much tastier than the frozen kind, which comes mostly in chopped up little stems.  I used cream of celery and mushroom, and prefer the celery- which has a lighter flavor.  And 1 cup of cheddar was plenty of cheese.  I followed another reviewer's tip and use just a pinch of salt and 1/2 of the pepper, which is much better.  Overall, a great, fresh tasting dish and not too salty or rich.  I used buttered Ritz crackers instead of croutons-- much tastier.  This one is a keeper.  My 4 and 1 yr. loved it- and that's all that matters!

I made this for a 25th wedding anniversary party and it turned out awesome!!! Not a word or a lie, every female at the party was begging me for the recipe.  It was gobbled up in minutes.  I made a lot of changes though, so heres what I did.  I used just half a tsp of salt instead of one and a half, added a can of cream of chicken soup as well as used cream of mushroom and garlic instead of regular cream of mushroom.  I added a cup and a half of fresh mushrooms, sliced and a pound of crispy bacon, crumbled.  For the topping, I used crushed Ritz crackers and a quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese instead of the croutons.  Oh, and I used 3 cups of cheddar cheese instead of 8 ounces of american.  Absolutely to die for!!! will definately be making this again.

This is the first thing to disappear at family dinners! I add 1/4 cup half and half to the soup and cheese mixture so there is a little more sauce. I use Ritz crackers instead of croutons, and add some cheddar to the American cheese for extra zip. I have also used half broccoli and half cauliflower. Thanks Kaylee!!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!  Let me explain something here...I am one of the most pick eaters in the world, but this this was really good!  I did alter it just a bit though.  I boiled my broccoli with butter and garlic.  Next, instead of the American cheese, I used cheddar and I also used the ritzs crackers.  Oh yeah, I added a little (and I mean little) bit of garlic powder and about 1/4 cup milk.(The mix of soup and cheese seemed to thick for me)IT TURNED OUT VERY CREAMY AND THE TASTE OF FRESH CRACKED PEPPER.....YUMMY :o)  

I am attending a X-mas dinner party on the 24th and this is the vegetable dish that I will be bringing!

I made this dish yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was delicious.  I followed many of the suggestions from previous posts.  I added a half cup of milk to the soup, used only a sprinkle of salt and pepper and baked it in a deeper&smaller casserole dish instead of a 9x13 pan.  I covered it in crushed stuffing instead of crutons.  It was not too salty and was moist without being soupy.  Thanks for all the suggestions!

Yumm! This was awesome. I made it for my husband and I for dinner. This was wonderful and so easy to make. Good enough to sit down and eat a large bowl of this for dinner and nothing else. I did not have the croutons, therefore left them out. However, I did add 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms to the sauce. It was delicious. I would cut the pepper amount in half next time. It was a little warm. Other than that it was great. Next time I may add some penne pasta and bite size chicken pieces. Would make a great pasta! Thanks for the recipe.

This would get 4 1/2 stars if I could do that.  Eat it up the first day because it is mush when reheated.

This had way too much pepper for my taste.  It seemed that was the only dominant flavor.  I would make it again, but with much less pepper.

Made this Christmas Day. Had to bring a vegetable side dish.  Was really good! Even had a, "This was really good, how did you make it?"       I used the suggestions of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, 3 cups of cheddar cheese and used 1/2 cup to a cup of half n half when mixing the cheese together with the creams.     I used another suggestion of adding crumbled bacon to the topping. I used the drippings from the bacon and from another suggestion, sauted the finely chopped onions and finely chopped mushrooms, 3 or 4 mushrooms, not to much.     Then from another suggestion, threw in two sleeves of the crushed Ritz Crackers and sauteed that with onions and mushrooms and added the 4 tablespoons of butter.     Most of the work was after steaming the four heads of broccoli. The chopping and peeling off the layer of skin was a bit of work but, worth it.      Thanks to ALL for your suggestions, LOL! It was a hit! P.S used only a little bit of pepper, yes..from another suggestion. LOL!

This was really really yummy and easy!  I did steam my broccoli and let it cool.  I didn't heat the soup and cheese together.  I just mixed the soup and cheese (used mozerella cheese, which is all I had on hand) with black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and some sea salt (everything to taste). Then, just mixed everything with the broccoli and spread in dish and put cracker crumbs on top.  I needed this for later on in the day for my mother-in-laws surprise party. Once we were ready, I placed in the oven for 30 min on 350F.  Came out so yummy and cheesy and delicious!  Will be making again!

I was very disappointed.  The recipe had WAY to much salt and pepper.  Made for xmas dinner, and people actually commented about how bad it was.  Will not try this again.

Made this for a Christmas dinner side along with turkey breast and ham. Very tasty, very easy with rave reviews from guests. The pictures do not do this recipe justice, mine looked much more appetizing upon serving and guest were asking for seconds and the recipe. And added bonus........ Kid Approved! Will be on rotation for holidays again........... Up for round 3 & 4 for these Holidays............. BY SPECIAL REQUEST from last years guest!

Made some changes, because I didn't want to go out to the store, and I loved it! Cream of Chicken soup, mild cheddar instead of sharp, a splash of whole milk, less salt, whole wheat bread crumbs & parm instead of croutons. Came out delicious! I started getting fresh organic produced delivered and got more broccoli than I knew what to do with, so I searched for broccoli recipes and this one came up. So glad I tried it!

A great casserole!  I made this alot while being pregnant and it became a regular side dish. I have used cream of celery soup and is sooo good as well, NOTE: I hardly ever use the amount of salt called for in any recipe and I don't in this one, and is still very flavorful, thanks for sharing :)

Terrific. So glad this called for fresh broccoli. I only used 1 cup of Cheddar which was enough for us. I didn't add the salt. I used crushed garlic croutons and it was perfect. I don't normally like the crunch but it really added some flavor as well. My 1 year old couldn't get enough of this.

I had to double this recipe and add half a cup of milk to counteract the saltiness of the original recipe.  After that it was good.

I followed some of the recommendations made and this turned out very good.  I used cream of celery soup, sharp cheddar, and ritz crackers.  Also added NO salt.  I would make it exactly the same way next time.

This was very, very good - although I did alter the recipe based on other reviews.  I used cream of celery instead of mushroom, I used about 1 cup of white cheddar in place of the American cheese and I used crushed Ritz crackers mixed with melted butter for the topping.  The end result was delicous and my 4 year old ate it - which is a very good sign.  We will make this again for sure - thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was a HIT at a party last night. Every bit was eaten and everyone commented on how good it was and asked for the recipe. The fresh broccoli is key. I didn't put any salt in it and halved the pepper. I added half a container of sour cream to the soup mixture and a splash of milk, and of course, I added extra cheese (cheddar, not American).   For the topping, I used a stick of melted butter and a sleeve of crushed ritz crackers. You have to try this kind! :)

Well loved by the adults and children alike. I should note that I halved the topping (Used butter crackers instead of croutons too) and I think next time I will add a little garlic. 

I will probably make this as a side for holiday dinners!

This was a good recipe.  However, I did follow a few suggestions and I used cream of celery soup in place of mushroom.  I also used extra sharp cheddar cheese - just a preference thing.  It was delicious --- for more sauce I doubled the soup and cheese. Topped with Texas Toast sesaoned croutons.  DELICIOUS!

Made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  I used ritz crackers instead of the croutons because that is what I had in the pantry.

Tried this for the first time for Christmas Eve dinner and it was supper yummy. I did make some changes based on other reviews. I used Cream of Celery soup and added about 1/4-1/2 c. of half and half to the mixture as well as substituted shredded cheddar cheese instead of American. I also substituted Ritz crackers for croutons. As far as the salt and pepper, I just seasoned the sauce to taste (taking into consideration that the Ritz are salty to begin with. Very very good. This is an excellent alternative to green bean casserole for a holiday dinner. I love that it uses fresh brocolli rather than frozen. I will definitley make this again!

This recipe is delicious! Wonderful flavor of broccoli and cheese. The topping really added to the flavor of the dish. Will be making this again!

I love broccolli but this one was waaay to salty for me (I did follow the recipe exactly) and I was unsure if I should add a cup of water with the condensed soup (so I didnt) and the mixture just seemed to thick and not enough to coat. I will make this again but use no salt and more cheese and I think that will make it perfect. Thank you for sharing your recipe :)

I used slices of Kraft singles American cheese. about 8 of them. and I added some sliced mushrooms. Instead of the topping, I crumbled cooked turkey bacon over the top. If you boil or steam the broccoli a little longer, you don't have to cook it as long. I baked mine for 15 minutes so the mushrooms could soften, but since everything is cooked and then added to the same dish, you really don't have to bake it if you don't want to.

This was great!  I wish I'd read the other suggestions first though - I found it too salty with the added salt.  I used a 10oz box of frozen broccoli, and also added some vegetarian chicken.  Used cheddar cheese.  Served it with rice and enjoyed it thoroughly!  Thank you!

So good.  Made for Thanksgiving instead of Green Bean Casserole. We all agreed it was much better. I did use crushed Ritz Crackers just because I had them on hand. Plan on making this for Christmas dinner again. It would even be good to throw in cooked chicken or ham and have it as the main course. Yum Yum

I made this recipe as stated..Did not change a thing. Way too much pepper, to the point it was not edible!! and Way too much salt. I usually read the reviews and sometimes I make adjustments....I should have read the reviews...It has great potential but making this as stated...FORGET IT! What a disappointment for Thanksgiving Day!

With recipe as written I give it 3 stars due to WAY too much pepper and a little too much salt. I honestly think 1/2 tsp pepper would be enough for this dish. Unfortunately I forgot to re-read the reviews right before making the dish. My judgement told me to put less pepper in, but then I followed the recipe because I don't like to make any alterations the first time around. As soon as I stirred it in I knew it was a mistake as the whole sauce turned from orangey-yellow to a greyish color. It was very salty as well, but I can deal with that. Changing the pepper to 1/2-1 tsp and the salt to maybe 1 tsp would make this a 5-star dish!

Really easy.  I used 2 cups sharp cheddar, 1/2 sauteed onion, and 1/2 cup low fat sour cream.  Did not add salt, as recommended by others.  This was delicious!

So good - but WAY too much salt!  I didn't read the reviews before making this, but wish I had.  It is not necessary to include the extra salt, as the soup and cheese have enough salt to make this recipe perfect.  Enjoy!

I love this dish! Its so simple but so good! I make as a sidedish or maindish. I replace the crutons with crushed cheese crackers. Try adding pre-cookes chicken for a yummy and quick maindish.

This is a great recipe, the only thing that destroyed it was all the pepper. I used the 2 tsp and it burnt your eyes and nose to eat. But if you cut the pepper maybe in half it would be GREAT!

Great recipe.  I skipped the salt since condensed soup is already salty.  Then added 2/3 C milk to the soup/cheese mixture, used Cheddar instead of American, and added a couple cups of cooked brown rice.  Topped with cracker crumbs instead of croutons.

This recipes as is is simply not very good!  If you read a few of the reviews you will see that most people liked it AFTER they changed alot of things.  I would highly recommend that you watch the broccoli closely (don't want to overcook), tone down BOTH the salt & pepper (I thought the pepper would be o.k., but NO), the cheese should not be american & lastly change the topping to buttered saltines/Ritz -anything that you like (NOT croutons)

Just made this for a large group - it was a hit. No left overs -

I bought the bagged Broccoli florets from Sam's club - and because of the soup and croûtons I did not add ANY more salt ... 

I will MAKE this again.

I would have actually given this recipe 4 1/2 stores if i could have.  I added just a touch of pepper and no salt.  Also, i added 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 1/2, with an additional half a cup on top.  Also I added an additional 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, along with the cream of mushroom.  I didn't use the bread crumbs... just substituted with ritz crackers.  I took this to thanksgiving dinner with the family.  They were a big hit.  my boyfriend actually complained that there were none left when we went home.  I wouldn't reccomend this for a main dish really, but it (with the few changes) was pretty good.

Very good ! I will definately make this again.But I will add half a soupcan of milk to make it a little creamier and try it without the crumb topping. It had just the right amount of cheese for us. Chopping it up made it a lot easier for the youngest ones to eat. Anything that the grandchildren will eat I will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this recipe but instead of using croutons, I used a cup of bread crumbs.  Also, I didn't add the salt & pepper the second time I made it because it was too overpowering the first time tried it.  Also, I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of American.  Next time I will try the suggestion of adding the half a cup of milk to it.

This was a quick and easy casserole.  I did add milk to the soup mixture, as previously recommended.  I also added a little more soup than was stated.  It was very creamy.  I sprinkled french fried onions on top instead of the croutons.  It was wonderful!

This casserole is really yummy!  I am not a big fan of broccoli but my husband is and we both loved it!  I can't wait to make it again!  One suggestion - hold back just a tad on the salt and it will be perfect!

Yummy!  I've brought this to two family gatherings this summer and it was devoured each time.  Everyone asks for the recipe and I almost hate to give it!  If you bring this to a potluck dont expect to bring home any leftovers!  I sub cheddar and ritz, add a 1/4 c milk, and use less pepper and salt.  I love it with the full amt. of seasonings, but some guests may not.

WINNER! My family raved over this at Thanksgiving dinner when there were alot of other side dishes it competed with. So it was a definite stand out! I did as other members suggested and added the half & half (used fat free) And I used a mixture of American & sharp cheddar for the best cheese flavor. But NO SALT!! You can salt if you wish, but with canned soup which has a ton of sodium and processed cheese also having a bunch I didn't feel the need for extra salt and it was fine.

Our family (including the 3 and 1 year old) really liked this recipe. One thing I'll do next time is sprinkle an extra cup or so of cheese to spread over the top of the broccoli & cheese mixture, then put the croutons (Ritz) on top of that. I think it will keep the breading from getting soggy upon reheating.

I added one small onion one cup of mushrooms 1/4 cup milk only used about 1 tsp salt and cheddar cheese. This recipe was
Good but I felt it was lacking something. The topping I didn't like I think 3 tbs of butter is too much maybe not even use any butter.

Good recipe. A little too much salt and pepper for me, so I toned those down a notch. But otherwise wonderful. Made this with cream of chicken soup also once. Substituted Velveeta cheese in one occasion too. Still turned out well. Great base with room to play.

This is so good.. I love broccoli and this recipe made it even better. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup the second time making this so I used cream of chicken which turned out so good.. I prefer the cream of chicken soup better. I did lower the salt both times and glad I did the soups have a salt taste which gives it enough. The 2nd try I added 1 tsp. italian seasoning to my bread crumb mixture. I will add the extra seasonings from now on it gave it that ump I thought it was missing.. Very good recipe.

After reading a couple of reviews and using the advice, this dish came out very well.  I added the half and half to make it creamier, used Ritz crackers instead of the croutons and way more cheese.  Really was a simple but excellent tasting recipe.  May experiment next time and add garlic, onions and/or cauliflower but great recipe as is.

This is basically the same recipe my family has used for years.  With a few changes.  Just use a pinch of salt.  For the topping we saute a small onion in a couple tablespoons of butter, when onion is soft add crushed ritz or saltine crackers and toast lightly.  Then put that on top it really makes it better.

This was really good.  I  however, changed a few things I used one can of mushroom soup and one can of celery soup, I used cheddar instead of american cheese and I use Ritz Crackers, I barely tasted it at church it was gone faster then I could get in on the table good. I used salt and pepper but very little theres alot of salt in the cheese and crackers so it was really a hit and I wll be making it for Thanksgivin.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was so much more delicious than I had even hoped. I followed the recipe exactly. It was really easy to make (which is important when you have a million other dishes to prepare), and was a hit with everyone at dinner. I'll make this one a tradition!

This was a great side dish for my Thanksgiving feast. I also tweaked the recipe according to the many comments I read -- just a pinch of salt and pepper. I also planned to use cream of celery, but when I got to the grocery store I noticed a can of Campbell's broccoli cheese soup right next to it, and I thought "why not? how bad can it be?" Well it was FANTASTIC. I hardly had to use any additional cheese because the flavor of the soup was so cheesy already. Just about 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar, and a little milk to thin out the soup. I also used Reduced Fat Ritz crackers. It was fantastic! I found myself devouring this first, even before the turkey. This dish was the first one to go -- NO leftovers--which made me a little sad, but I will definitely be making this again soon. So simple and a total crowd pleaser!

This recipe id soooo delicious! You just have to watch how long you cook the broccoli for....it can get mushy! Instead of croutons on top, I mixed some bread crumbs with some melted butter and shredded sharp chedder. It came out perfect!

Great base of a recipe. I change things up a bit.  Per others suggestion, I added cooked rice to the mixture (I don't measure, just eye-ball how much I want) and substituted Cheddar for American cheese.  Before I made the cream sauce, I sauted roughly chopped onions in some garlic in a sauce pan, then add the cream sauce ingredients when the onions were ready.  The last time I made this, I put fried onions on top.  My husband loved it that way.  It reminded him of a green bean casserole.  He suggested putting the fried onions in the casserole.  Will try it that way next time.

This is excellent just as it is (except I cut down on the pepper and used only 1/2 tsp), but I had a bumper crop of zucchini this summer and added some shredded zucchini to the mix and it made it even better!  It also gave it m ore green since I leave the peel on mine if tender.  You gotta try this trick to use up some of that zucchini.

I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner this year and it got huge hits.  I used fat free cheddar instead of American cheese, and I used fat free mushroom soup and omitted the salt.  Everyone loved it - thanks!

Very easy, very yummy!  I used cheddar cheese instead of american, and a smaller baking dish, but that's all I changed.  I've been emailing friends w/ this recipe.  A keeper.

I have been looking for a good broccoli casserole recipe and this is it! I used French's cheddar onions instead of the croutons-- fabulous taste. I agree with others who say to use half the pepper.

If I could give this an extra star I would. My husband goes absolutely crazy when we have this for dinner. I only had cheddar cheese croutons on hand the second time I made it and they are great for this dish. I used half of the pepper, because the first time was little too spicy for me. (although my husband liked it.) A great broccoli recipe!

Maybe my broccoli was bad? It didn't look bad but it tasted really funny in this dish. We threw out almost the entire pan after 1 bite. However, it was also bland. I'm giving this 3-stars b/c it might not be entirely the recipe's fault. I plan to try this again, but add some sauted onions maybe or some onion/garlic powders and use sharp cheddar cheese. If it tastes better next time, I'll change my review...

I made this dish for a large gathering and it went over very well - not a bite left. I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of american, used some milk to mix in soup, added sprinkle of lemon juice, very little lemon pepper and added pecans which I received a lot of compliments on...yum!

Very Good...I wasn't sure about it. But it has so much flavor. I did use the suggestions of the rest of the reviews and stayed away from the Salt and Pepper. I think I added I dash..but that's it. 
Thank you!

This was my very first time making a Casserole dish and I loved it! I cooked it for everyone in my family and they also enjoyed it as well.  This is a wonderful recipe, But I have altered it some over the times I have made it.  Cut back on the salt and pepper slightly.  If you think its not creamy enough, *add some honey mustard over the broccoli and croutons* It tastes wonderful! Also, be sure to mix milk into the soup. It was great served over wild rice and a chicken breast! YUM!

This was a good side dish; only slightly different than the infamous green bean casserole. I didn't use as much broccoli, skipped the salt, cut down on the pepper, also used Ritz Crackers and added a bit of milk to the soup and cheese mixture to make it creamier.

My review may not be fair as I changed a few things. I used one cup of cottage cheese and half a cup of cheese whiz. Also, I used cream of onion soup. And I halved the topping. 198 cal. For an eighth, pretty good!

I followed other reviewers and added an extra can of cream of chicken, plus about 1/4 c of milk.  I also tossed in a handful of crumbled bacon, and used Ritz crackers plus shaved Parmesan for the topping.  This is a great comfort food.

This was incredible. I did make some changes. I used cheddar, mozzarella, and colbyjack cheeses just because I happened to have them on hand. I used New York Texas Seasoned croutons and they were so good on it. So good. There were a lot of reviews that did not like the amount of salt and pepper, but I found it tasty. If you know you don't care for a lot of salt and pepper, just don't put as much in. Trust yourself.

Very easy and pretty good.  I used the cheese I had, sharp and coby.  I used Ritz instead of crutons, because that is what we had.  I also added a little cheese to the top.  Turned out great.  Next time I will add more broc and maybe mushrooms.  Thanks for shareing!

No offense to Aunt Millie, but I was hoping this would be like the dish we used to have at all our family dinners when I was growing up, but it wasn't.  Not 'bad', but will keep searching.  Was too salty in my opinion and could use rice mixed in. Was too close to just melted cheese over broccoli, but thank you for submitting just the same!  To each his own!  :)

Definitely not low-fat, but it does get the kiddos to eat their veggies!  Similar to others, I used "real" cheese instead of processed, and I successfully used a mish-mash of random spare vegetables from the fridge and freezer

I made this to take to our family Rosh Hashanah dinner--OMG! Everyone just loved this dish. I left out the salt and pepper because the soup and cheese had enough salt of their own and Hub's tum can't tolerate black pepper. Also, the croutons I used were very well seasoned, so for our family, the salt and pepper weren't used. And honestly, I don't think they were needed. I used mostly American cheese and added in whatever I had left in the coldcut drawer--there was some cheddar with horseradish, some swiss and some shredded cheese blend.    This was just totally awesome and sooooo easy to make. I can't give ten stars but I would if I could. Bravo!  (As an afterthought--I think I would like to try this again using reduced fat cheese and cut down on the butter too. I think it would also be good, perhaps just seven stars instead of ten, but still quite yum.)

I decided to mix half broccoli with half cauliflower.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and it turned out great!  Very cheesy!

I made this for Christmas last year and it was fabulous! Even the kids loved it. My only recommendation is to add crumbled bacon.

Followed other reviewers and added no salt, just a few dashes of pepper, added some milk to thin the sauce out, and used Ritz crackers on the top instead of croutons. I also used a mixture of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup.  It was absolutely delicious!  My hubby loved it!  I will definitely be making this again!

Served this for Easter- there was no leftovers. I will definitely make this again. The  changes I made were to add 1/2 c milk  to the soup and cheese mixture,and I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of croutons. I only used a sprinkle of pepper, and no salt was necessary.

Delicious. My changes: two cups of sharp cheddar (instead of American), at least a half cup of milk to make it creamier, no salt added, and Ritz instead of croutons. People always ask me to bring this to parties and there is never any left.

I'm rating this recipe based on how I made it, which was based on the reviews of others.  I used only 1/4 tsp. of salt, used ritz crackers instead of the croutons, and used cream of celery instead of mushroom.  It is a solid recipe and definitely one to keep.  My hubby gave it two thumbs up.  I would agree, although to give it five stars, it needs just a little something to put it over-the-top.  I might try adding a bit of Worcestershire Sauce next time.

This was good! NO NEED TO ADD SALT THOUGH! I didn't and it was FINE. 
I used sharp cheddar AND American cheese, a sprinkle of onion powder, basil and I used town house butter crackers instead of bread crumbs.
I used cream of chicken soup cuz its all I had and it came out good. I'll make this again from time to time for something different

Great way to prepare broccoli!  I did make a couple subs- I used cream of celery soup, and I added about a 1/4 of a vidalia onion. I also topped with crushed ritz crackers (no butter added).  Very tasty!

This is my first review, though, I have tried many on the site. I really liked this  method of cooking broccoli. I substituted Panko instead of crutons on crackers and it was magic. And the less salt and pepper was correct. Good work reviewers! Five star.

Calls for way too much salt. I wish I had read the reviews before making. It was good though. Next time I will omit all extra salt. Also, mine didn't fit in a 9x13. I had to go a size down. And I used cheddar cheese instead of American. Was yummy!

Definetley a keeper!!!  Chopping the broccoli is well worth the effort, as the taste of the fresh broccoli is what makes this dish a step above other broccoli casseroles.  I used 1/2 cup more cheese (cheddar) than was called for and twice as many crutons and butter ( what can I say, I like empty calories!)  I served this for Mother's Day dinner and had requests for the recipe.

Wow!  My husband couldn't say enough about this creamy, flavorful casserole!  He's never enthused about broccoli, but he loved this!  Really fast and easy too.  I omitted the salt altogether, and reduced the pepper to 1 tsp.  I added about a TBS. of dried minced onion.  I was out of croutons, so I just topped this with French Fried Onion Rings (from a can) instead.  Wonderful!

I've made this with and without the croutons (I prefer it with) and I omit the salt because I don't feel it needs it. I also use cheddar cheese and frozen chopped broccoli. Thanks Kaylee!

I made this for a holiday dinner this year to rave reviews.  It was a nice change from traditional vegetable dishes, and very easy.  The only change I made was to add a little parmesean cheese to the crushed crouton topping.

This is a great dish and my family loves it.  After reading most of the reviews, I felt the need to comment.  Most people do not read labels and they should.  The canned mushroom soup and mega salt in it and adding more salt is throwing it over the edge.  Omit the salt and the recipe is delicious.  Also pepper is an individual taste and starting on the low side will allow everyone to season the dish to their own tastes.  The milk is a great idea or adding another can of soup also works. A great alternative to green bean casserole.

Great recipe!  Just made this for Thanksgiving & it was all gone in a matter of minutes!  I took everyone's advice & added about 1/2 cup milk, I also used mild cheddar cheese and for the topping I used Herb seasoned stuffing mix.  Oh, yeah, I didn't add any salt at all and only about 1/2tsp pepper.  My son's B-day party is Saturday & I'll definitely be making this as one of my dishes!  Super!

I made this dish for a large gathering and it went over very well - not a bite left. I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of american,  and adding a 1/2 cup of half-and-half to the soup and cheese mix made it a bit creamier. Overall, a very good casserole, just remember a small pinch of salt is all it needs, if that much. Enjoy!

Very easy recipe and fairly quick to make. Quite tasty although some changes were necessary. Definitely leave out the salt - I did and my husband still said it was too salty. Also, I felt it needed to be more substantial and added cooked pasta shells. My husband and I agreed we wouldn't have liked it without this added ingredient.

Everyone ate their broccoli!  No on in our family likes brocoli, but they'll eat anything that is covered and smothered I guess.  I used 2 heads of broccoli because that's all I had, will use 2 next time too because it was very moist.  I used cheddar cheese and added 2 Tbls milk.

Really yummy side dish, although I think next time I will smash the croutons more finely (I used chunks and it was a little too crunchy). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe at Thanksgiving, but I unfortunately only had 2heads of brocolli. Of course, everyone wanted more and we ran out.  It was a huge hit.  I wont be making green bean casserole anymore, this will replace it!  Thanks

I want you to know how much I love this recipe.  I made this as the vegetable dish for Thanksgiving dinner. It was extremely quick and easy to make and it was so tasty.  Everyone loved it and asked me to copy the recipe for them before they left my house.  Thank you for sharing it!!

wonderful! Used only 2 heads of broccoli, added some milk to the soup along with 2 cloves of pressed garlic. Omitted the butter and added paprika instead. Husband couldn't some commenting about how good it was! He took the leftovers for lunch!

I felt like the flavors competed with each other and didn't really mesh well.  The topping was unnecessary in my opinion.  The broccoli was cooked perfectly, but it could have done without the pepper and about half of the cheese.  I might make again with radical changes.

This was very good, I made with brocolli and cauliflower.  Cut back to 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper and add 1/2 tsp each of garlic and onion powder plus several good shakes of tabasco - just our preference for seasoning.  I still felt like it was missing something so I sauted 1/2 of a chopped onion and added that. Used 1/2 american cheese slices and half sharp chedder.  I needed to add 1/4 cup of milk to get everything to combine - zapped it all in the mircrowave right in the casserole dish while the brocolli was steaming.  Topped with crushed cheese crackers because thats all I had.  I will use this modified version from now on - it was really good!!

This is good! I used two bags of frozen chopped broccoli and added a half cup of milk to the sauce mix. No need for salt because the soup is full of it. Black and red pepper to taste and a little garlic salt. I used cheese its for my topping since that is what I had on hand and it turned out good!

I used frozen broccoli. The result was very tasty but a little salty. They sometimes add salts to frozen or prepackages veggies, so this is probably the case. I also used crushed veggie crisps instead of the butter/crouton topping.

Awesome Casserole. I steamed the broccoli instead of boiling it and used Cheddar Jack cheese instead of American. I also added a half cup of cooked rice. Seasoning I eye-measured myself, some people prefer more salt some less, so I always just go by what feels right for me. I loved the seasoned croutons. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing

I make a slightly different variation of this recipe - I don't precook the broccoli, so it's nice and firm after its been baked, I add a layer of mushrooms and onions that have been fried on top of the broccoli, cover it with mushroom soup and then add cheese - I make two layers and then bake it until the cheese has melted and bubbly - has been a family favourite of ours for years.

I love that this uses fresh broccoli!  Per other reviews, I didn't add the salt and thought it was perfect.  Also, I used cheddar and parmesan because that's what I had on hand.  I would imagine you could use any cheese and have this be delicious!

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe I must say.  Way too much salt and pepper....it probably should only have 1/2 tsp of both.  The casserole was also very thin in a 9X13 pan.  It probably needed more soup.  Amount of broccoli and bread crumbs seemed good.

Give it a try but use a smaller pan if you like a deeper dish.  I loved it and tried it once without a recipe and what a disaster that was.  Also I thought and bought fresh mushrooms to put inside of it but forgot. Dont know how it would have turned out but give it a go.  Easy as pie to make!

I saw this casserole had lots of 5 star ratings and wanted to give it a try. I almost followed the recipe exactly except omitted the salt and used what cheese I had on hand, which was colby. The croutons were great, the ones I used were garlic and herb. It was a great dish that my family loved! What a great way to get the kids to eat some veggies :)

Very yummy!  I love that it uses fresh broccoli and the sauce was very creamy.  I've also made it before with added chicken breast pieces and served it over whole grain rice and that was very good, too.  With applesauce or a side salad it makes a perfect meal!

My husband is the world's pickiest eater when it comes to holiday veggies! He loves this and it has been a holiday hit for about 2yrs now, this started as my comprimise to not having green bean casserole and now it's a must have. The only adjustment we make since we both don't like mushrooms is we either use Cream of Broccoli or Cream of Celery soup.
Thanks for posting this recipe!

We didn't care for this recipe. I didn't add any salt to it and my husband kept saying it was too salty. My 1 year old gobbled it down, but then again he eats everything including paper.

I used cheddar cheese and added a little Pappy's seasoning and it was great! I too used the ritz crackers for the topping, but could see how the dressing on top could be probably just as good!

Based on other reviews, I tried this dish for Thanksgiving instead of the family recipe we traditionally served every year.  My family loved it!  The only changes I made were to use cream of celery soup, and stuffing mix for the topping, as those were the ingredients I had on hand.  Personally, I think I'd prefer the cracker topping, but my family insists I don't change a thing next year!

I used cheddar instead of american cheese.

Instead of using the butter to coat the croutons, I mixed it in with the melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup.

I didn't boil the broccoli in saltwater.

They way I did it was excellent and everybody  liked it at Thanksgiving.

I have made this recipe a bunch of times and every time I make it I add less and less pepper.  Use around a 1/4 of a tsp. Otherwise it's a great recipe.

I love this! I did make a few flavor changes 
here you go... you have to try Progresso's new Italian Panko bread crumbs.  Oh My.... I was licking the spoon 
For the cheese, add a little parmesan in to replace some of the salt, the cheese and soup have enough
For your broccoli, add a little chicken broth and garlic salt to the water for extra flavor 
I added a splash of milk when melting my cheese which was a cheddar and mozzarella mix 
add an extra cup of cheese on top before bread crumbs
with an extra tablespoon of melted butter
Enjoy :)

What a great way to eat broccoli!  I used a two 12 oz. bags of fresh Dole broccoli (no chopping needed).  Instead of boiling broccoli I steamed it for a minute.  I also added about 1/4 cup half & half.  Decided like others to use ritz crackers in stead of bread crumbs.  First thing my hubby said was mmmm--it's hard to get much out of him & he's a tough critic, so that meant he really liked it.

This recipe is simple and yummy.
I did 2 things differently. First, I ran out of cheddar, so I used Velveeta. Second, I didn't add any salt.  The dish turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.

Good stuff. I substituted ritz crackers for the croutons. This is definitely a keeper, especially if you love steamed brocolli and cheese.

My husband said this was the best casserole dish ever. This really was excellent but only after I made a few changes. I used cream of celery soup, a little milk, cheddar cheese and a package of Uncle Ben's 90-second steamed rice. I didn't like the sound of crushed croutons so I replaced them with Ritz crackers and melted butter. Yum!

My family loved this Broccoli casserole. It was easy to make and turn out really good. I used fat free mush. soup, low fat cheese, and on the topping I just lightly covered it with Italian style bread crumbs. I also add 1lb of extra lean ground beef, so with a serving of mashed potato I had a meal. Thank you

We loved this!  Didn't change a thing, with the exception of using regular cheddar cheese instead of American.  Our college-aged daughter was home and commented several times on how delicious the broccoli casserole was.  I even think I saw her eating it cold!

I read all the of highest rated broccoli casserole recipes on this site, and decided to take some ingredients from all, using this one as a base recipe. I added 1/2 cup mayo and sauteed onion and garlic (3 cloves) in butter, which I stirred into the soup (I used cream of mushroon with roasted garlic). I think that using fresh broccoli really improved the consistency as opposed to frozen. I used colby jack cheese and I also used Ritz crackers and melted butter as a topping. Everyone really loved this as a side dish at Christmas dinner.

I brought this to a picnic and my friend's mother said that she liked it and didn't even like broccoli - always the sign of a winning recipe.  I made this incorporating other's suggestions like using cheddar instead of American Cheese, reduced pepper to 1T, omited salt, used Ritz crackers instead of croutons, and I used cream of potato soup just because it's what I had.  Also, I too chopped the broccoli - and important step if kids (at least my kids) are going to be eating it.  This was good and I will make it again.

This vanished at Thanksgiving and my husband is so sad that there aren't leftovers! It was very yummy. I used cream of broccoli soup instead of mushroom and sharp cheddar instead of American cheese. Next time I will reduce the pepper for our tastes. Thanks for a great recipe!

I make this recipe fairly often and it is always a hit.  I do not add any extra salt to it though.  (The soup and croutons add enough.)  It does have a strong pepper taste....but we happen to like that in this case.

This was an o.k. recipe.  From the reviews, I expected it to be a lot better.  The only thing that I changed was I used crushed ritz crackers as the topping.  It just wasn't cheesy enough for us.

This is pretty good.  I followed other reviews by using less salt and pepper and added a 1/4 cup of half and half.
I also used italian bread crumbs instead of croutons and frozen brocolli floretts instead of fresh. It's just me and my husband so the amount of brocolli I use is probably less than 4 heads. I really dislike American cheese, so I used marbled Cheddar.

I actually serve this as a main dish by serving it over egg noodles.

This was good, but I had to cut the salt & pepper, and it was still too much.  I will only use 3/4 tsp. of each next time.  I also used 3 packages of thawed frozen chopped broccoli instead of fresh.  I cooked the broccoli before adding it to the cheese mixture like the recipe called for.  I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese instead of 1 1/2.  Next time I will try to add a small container of light sour cream.  I used fat free soup and light cheese & it still tasted good.

This is a good standard side dish, but needs some changes.  Next time I make it, I will not add any salt (the seasoned croutons are salty enough) and I will use only 1/4 of the pepper suggested.  
I made this with cheddar instead of American cheese, which tasted great.

This was excellent. I made it for the veggie side dish this Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. VARIATION: Used original Stove Top stuffing for the topping. I think next time I will make it in an 8x8 inch baking pan rather than the 9x13 as listed in this recipe. It would have been better just a little deeper on the veggies & cheese!

I made this with half broccoli and half baby carrots. I also added some garlic to the sauce before combining it all together. Served it with crushed ritz crackers rather than the suggested croutons. It turned out great.

After reading all the rave reviews, I chose to cook this for Thanksgiving at the in-laws.  Ii was a hit (except with my broccoli hating husband).  I easily threw it together that morning, and everyone LOVED it.  An important note: I followed the suggestions people gave in their reviews, which was a big help.  I left out the salt and pepper, and used Ritz crackers on top.  I also used frozen broccoli to save time, and EXTRA cheese.  I'm cooking this every year!!

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving.  My guests loved it and so did my family!
I liked the crunchiness of the croutons along with the moistness of the broccoli. My guests even asked for the recipe!
I'm sure I'll be making this dish regularly and not just for Thanksgiving!

This recipe was really great! I think it would be better with about half of the amount of pepper. The overall taste of it was really good though! One of the people at my Christmas dinner liked it so much he asked for the rest of it to take home. Since it is so easy to make I told him sure. I can make more!

Am I the only one who thought this recipe had too much pepper??  I thought it was really tasty - but 2 teaspoons of pepper... Oh it was sooo hot!  I will be making this again but I'm going to try it with 3/4 teaspoon of pepper next time.

I make this casserole every time I'm wanting comfort food. I have had it exactly as written without the croutons. Usually I make a combination of this casserole and paula deens broccoli casserole which the addition is mayo, and eggs,  and ritz instead of croutons. Paula Deens is a little more decadent, I can whip this one up so quickly and throw it in the oven with anything. I also don't bother with fresh broccoli. I use chopped frozen broccoli. It's delicious.

AHmazing! I followed some other users suggestions and used the Ritz crackers... Fantastic! Also subbed the cream of mushroom for cream of celery... So delicious. Every time I make this, it's a hit! It's devoured. Never leftovers unless I'm just making it for myself ;)

It would be unbearably salty as written; I added sprinkle of salt, and I wish I hadn't added any. That aside, the recipe is good - using fresh broccoli makes the texture much better than it would be with frozen.

This is so delicious!  I am just learning how to cook, and had no problem with this. I love the pepper in it, it gives it a pop.  I am not advanced enough yet to tweek recipes, but this one is great as is.  I'm sure I will make this many more times.

Aunt Millie, I think you burnt your taste buds.  I really like this recipe and will do it again but bring the pepper and salt down to 1/4 tsp each.  Just a little is good with seasoned croutons.  I used my first broccoli harvest from my own garden.

I have to admit that I wasn't terribly impressed.  I like a creamier sauce for broccoli casseroles and I thought there was way too much topping.  I gave it 4 stars because my husband really liked it.

I made this because I had a 3lb bad of broccoli that was about to go bad. We LOVE broccoli so I thought we couldn't go wrong with anything we tried.  I used extra sharp cheddar & 2% milk cheddar for the cheese. I used low sodium low fat cream of mush. I didn't add any salt because I couldn't see needing it with all the sodium in the cream of mush. I also added bacon for the carnivore that is my husband. This was pretty good but I felt terrible for eating it. It's a good way to trick your kids into eating their veggies but I just assume not lead my kids to believe that all veggies need tons of cheese, dressing and gravy to be good. We'll stick with our steamed broccoli with sea salt. I give it 3 stars because it was good tasting - but I just can't feel good about eating it. This would be a good dish for holidays, but def not a regular dish.

This recipe is exquisite!  I prepared it and it was a surprise for my husband when he came home.  I served it with Beef and vegetable Kebabs. Just unique for a nice dinner or if you have people coming over.
Thanks to the original submitter.

This is awesome- I did it with the extra milk to put rice in but forgot the rice. It was creamy and saucy- loved it. Doesn't need rice but I had a taste for it. This is a keeper- thanks Aunt Millie.
I used cheddar instead of American though.

Super easy and everyone loved it.

I used cream of mushroom w/ garlic soup and I used the Kraft combo of American and Cheddar shredded cheese, and I used Ritz crackers instead of croutons.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used the large bag of cut, fresh broccoli from Sam's Club, 3 cups of cheese, bacon pieces and Ritz crackers on top.  This was a big hit with our Supper Club group.

Just like everyone else, I substituted according to what I had on hand and what my family likes!  I doubled the recipe for a large Thanksgiving dinner.  I used one can cream of celery and one can cream of mushroom.  I also substituted Velveeta cheese for shredded cheese and left out all the salt.  Plus, I used frozen broccoli and Ritz crackers in place of croutons.  It was a huge hit and requested for another dinner on Sunday!

Four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly and I have some modifications.  I used half of a 2 pound bag of fresh cut broccoli, so approximately one pound; a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup (Campbell's healthy request); extra sharp white cheddar cheese and half of the pepper.  I made the mistake of adding milk to the soup mixture, this made it too soupy.  I want the broccoli to have a little something sticking to it, not swimming in it.  I also used a cracker mixture on top, but used a butter alternative spread to make it healthier.  This will be made again and I may try cream of celery for a milder flavor and for the cheese taste to come through.

I have been making this for quite awhile, and I love it.  My whole family enjoys it.  I have made it with a bit of cream to make it creamier and without.  Either way, it's excellent.  I have made it with the crouton topping and with a whole wheat Ritz cracker topping and again, either way it was amazing.  You've got to try this!

This is delicious!  The only change I made was to use cream of broccoli soup instead of mushroom because I don't care for it.  This is so cheesy and yummy.  Definitely a crowd-pleaser.

As recommended in other reviews, I increased the cream of mushroom soup, added milk, used cheddar instead of American, didn't add any extra salt, and used bread crumbs with extra butter for the topping.  Super easy to make, and it is one of those recipes where you can just ball-park the ingredients until it looks right.  I may try the french fried onions as the topping next time!

I thought this was alright and would have given three stars, but since everyone else who had it loved it I gave it 4.  I added one cup of sauteed mushrooms and used 2 cups of cheese.  Other people didn't like the crouton topping, however I thought it was great and completed the dish quite well.  I will probably make this again.

This was really good.  I thought 4 heads of broccoli would be too many but it ended up just right.  I added some milk to the cheese sauce to thin it out a bit, I also reduced the salt and only put about 3/4 a tsp of black pepper in it.  Thanks, I can see why this is a holiday favorite!

This was ok, we didn't really see what the fuss was all about, it's cheese and broccoli, however, we did like crouton topping - gave nice flavor. Might make again...not sure.

Holy pepper! All I could taste in this was the pepper and it ruined it for me. Without it, I would have really enjoyed this meal. I used light old cheddar for the cheese and low fat soup and added a tsp of mustard powder. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8 inch square pan. Will try it again but omit the pepper.

This recipe could have been very good, but it uses too much pepper.  I think either using unseasoned croutons or cutting the amount of pepper would have made it better.

Had this last night for dinner and it was very good. I too used Cheddar cheese instead of American and I also added just a touch of milk. I used Marie Callendar's seasoned croutons (which I crushed)as the topping. Very tasty

As my brother said this was Kickin.   I made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone had a good comment on it.    I did add the half a cup of milk, and I didn't have american cheese, so I used sharp cheddar, it was great.   I will make this a tradition and make it every year.

Delicious!!  I didn't add the salt or pepper, rather let everyone due so to their tastes.  Also added a half cup a milk as previously suggested.  Next time I will cook the broccoli longer so it is more tender, it was a little tough for my family's tastes, so we liked it better reheated.

This recipe was a surprise hit with my husband.  I wanted a quick and easy dish that utilized some leftover broccoli and tried Aunt Millie's Broccoli Casserole.  I love recipes that require you to mixed up all the ingredients, throw it in the oven and forget about it 'til it's done.  This is one of those.  Not only is it incredibly labour-free, but also it turns out fabulous each time I make it.  It's just one of those great comfort sidedishes that you can enjoy with very little effort.

I've made this three times since discovering it. Definitely a "keeper," but I agree it calls for way too much salt and pepper. I cut the salt down and figured the 2 tsp of pepper must have been a typo, so used 1/4 tsp. Used crackers on top the first time and toasted, seasoned bread crumbs the next 2 times.

Way, way, way too salty and too much pepper! Quarter the amount of pepper, and don't add any salt. I used crackers for the top (unsalted!) and if the seasonings would have been right, it would have been perfect and delicious!

This was very good.  I reduced the broccoli to three heads after reading the other reviews and used Ritz crackers instead of croutons.  I was expecting to have some for leftovers, but it went fast!  Thanks!

When I make it again, I will use less salt as there is quite a bit of salt in the croutons.  Also, I don't think I needed so many croutons on the topping.  But overall, my guests absolutely loved it.

Great recipe. However, next time I'll lightly sprinkle bread crumbs or crushed club crackers for the topping instead of the Pepperidge Farm stuffing as suggested by others...This recipe is great without all the extras.

With the great reviews, I thought it would turn out better. If I were to make it again I would reduce the amount of black pepper, which was overpowering. The crouton topping was good, but two cups was a lot for this dish. Maybe I should have increased the amount of broccoli and used a larger casserole dish?

I try to stay true to a recipe but I altered this recipe a lot.  I cut the recipe in half and used two heads of broccoli, used sharp cheddar instead of american cheese, used cream of celery soup because that's what I had on hand, added a pinch of salt, used 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and used one cup of crushed Ritz crackers for the topping.

Either my four heads of broccoli were a lot bigger than most or the ratio between soup and broccoli is way off...one can just is not enough...it was still good tho, I will make it again, I will just cut back on the broccoli or use two cans of soup.  I use sharp cheddar because I dont really care for American cheese and I left off the topping altogether...figured I would save myself the calories.

A quick and easy recipe. I made it for my vegetarian daughter for thanksgiving, (while we had turkey) and she loved it!  The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle Parmesan cheese (just the powdered kind) on top before I baked it.

Made this today for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic! Almost everyone's favorite side dish and my husband ate a ton of it.

I did just a couple minor changes. I can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. 14 cups of broccoli heads. Added garlic and minced onion in the soups and cheese. Did 4 cups of cheese and used extra sharp shredded cheddar. 2 sleeves of Ritz crackers and extra butter instead of croutons. I also did an additional layer of cheese on top, under the crackers and baked a little longer than recommended. 

It has already been requested for Christmas dinner and for next year.

Made it exactly as the recipes States like I usually do the first time and it was way too salty and peppery.  Next time I will add only a pinch of salt and pepper and add some milk and cheddar cheese to the sauce.  I would probably add in some garlic as well.

I did not add the salt or pepper because I never do add salt for health reasons.  There is enough salt in everything we eat.  Other than that, I followed the recipe religiously, although I had to halve it.  It was delicious.  My husband hates broccoli and he loved it!

Great recipe. I used Ritz instead of croutons and sprinkled parmesan on top. Salt and pepper to taste. The broccoli cooks down so make sure you use all 4 heads. I would definitely make it again.

The changes I made make this spectacular and easy.   I cut this down to serve 5-6. I steamed 4 cups chopped broccoli. Then I stirred 1 cup sharp cheddar, 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/3 cup half and half,together and heated it. Used no salt Believe it is plenty salty, and dash pepper,
 THE BEST THING I DID WAS CRUSH CHEEZITS FOR THE TOP instead of croutons. I drizzled 2 T. melted butter over the Cheezits, put this in an 8x8 glass dish.  Baked at 375 15 minutes The husband thought it was great, had 2 helpings. So good with grilled salmon, chicken, etc.

Lots of potential.  The flavor was great but there was not much sauce.  Next time I will try adding a bit of milk.  If that makes it soupy, I'll use more soup or less broccoli.

Very good.  I used broccolli & cauliflower and substituted cheddar for the American cheese.  I was very careful with the salt after reading reviews but still felt it was a little salty.  Next time I will only use salt in the water I blanch the veggies in.  I did use crushed Ritz also as my family loves them.

Awesome recipe. I used a combo of american and mild cheddar, then added 1/2 cup milk and one cup cooked instant rice for an amazing broccoli & rice casserole. Everyone ate it up, even my 7 yr old who hates broccoli. Thanks!

Way too much pepper!  I was in a hurry so I didn't read the reviews as I normally do.  It was so peppery, though, my boyfriend, who will eat ANYTHING couldn't eat more than a bite.  The seasoned croutons made the salt in the recipe overkill.  If I made it again, I would leave out the salt and pepper.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of American, as I try to avoid eating products that refer to themselves as "cheese food."

I like to make everything from scratch, but I've never made broccoli casserole, nor tasted it.  I made it for a party, and it was a big hit.  Thanks for sharing.

I skipped the salt and pepper and used shredded cheddar cheese, as suggested by others.  This was just too much "fatty sauce" and not enough broccoli for me- though my kids liked it.  Would be easy enough to remedy by increasing the amount of broccoli, but I'm not sure this is any better, really, than the simply broccoli in cheese sauce at the grocery store from Green Giant!

I came across this when I was in search of a simple broccoli casserole with the ingredients I had on hand. 
I used cream of celery soup, and sharp cheddar cheese instead. Sprinkled with cheese mixture with garlic powder, and topped with leftover crushed ceasar salad flavored croutons. 
It was very good !
My four boys loved it !

We all thought this was bland, sorry.  Too much pepper, which I did not use, and there really isn't any other flavor.  I sauteed onions and garlic but that wasn't enough to save it.  Won't be making it again, but thanks for letting me try.

Excellent dish, just too much pepper. I'd cut the amount of pepper in half! Used cream of celery soup, cheddar cheese and wheat crackers. Yummy!

according to my family/taste testers, this was the best part of thanksgiving dinner, despite of the fact that i messed up more than once and had to try to fix my mistakes. There was a little more effort needed than the plain and simple green bean casserole, but the flavor from the cheese was great. I will definitely be making this again.

My husband (a broccoli fan) loved this casserole.   I substituted cheddar cheese for the American, and used garden herb croutons.  The combination of the cheese and salty croutons was perfect.

Ehh, just ok for me. 
I followed Jackie Mac's and others' suggestions to use more cheese (3 C cheddar) and more soup (adding 1 can mushroom & garlic instead of just mushroom), crisp crumbled bacon, some fresh mushrooms, and a ritz and grated parmasean crumb topping, and less salt. It sounded in theory like it would be awesome. It was ok, but nothing special. Like others have said for some reason there was just "something missing." Even with all my extra add-ins. I'm thinking this recipe needs either mayo or sour cream to round it out, but I'm not bothering with it anymore.
This recipe is more work than the Awesome Broccoli Casserole on here (where you just basically dump, stir and cook), and IMO, not worth the extra effort. 
I tried this one for Thanksgiving, and it was sampled, but not devoured. Nothing bad about it, just kind of blah.
BTW I'm glad I doubled the soup, can't imagine the mixture covering all that broccoli otherwise.
I originally rated this 3 stars, but am switching to 2, because honestly, a real recipe should not need so much tweaking. Otherwise it's not really a recipe, it's just an idea.

Didn't care for it. Used cream of celery soup since I had guests that don't care for mushrooms. Used Ritz crackers and   a blend of cheddar cheese but it was still missing "something". I won't be making this one again

This was bitter tasting for us.  Not sure if it's because I made it the night before or not.  I used frozen broccoli that I slightly cooked first, shredded cheddar and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I ate my serving as did my husband, but my kids, who love broccoli, didn't eat one bit.  We threw what was left out. I won't make it again.

tasted good, got raves from the family.  Used it for thanksgiving and it did not hold well in my opinion(while I finished up with other dishes), got dry and stuck to the pan.  Either needs to be served immediately or I need to find a similar recipe that can be held warm longer.

This isn't my favourite broccoli dish, but since everyone else in my family loved it, I had to give it 4 stars!  Simple to prepare and unique with the addition of croutons.  I found the cooking time made the broccoli a bit too soft, so you may wish to adjust to your preference.

This was good, but I've seen other casseroles since that I think I will try before making this again.  Made it at Christmas...I received compliments on it, but would like something a little easier as well.

Good, but very peppery, adds spice to this dish.  I used half cauliflower.  Would try another recipe before making this again!

All in all a good recipe although I found the croutons a little too overpowering in flavor.  It detracted too much away from the delicious broccoli and cheese flavor.

I used cheddar cheese instead of American.  The recipie actually served about 12 and I heard no complaints from the crowd!  I gave it 4 stars because the broccoli wasn't as firm as I would have liked it to be, it was a little to mushy.

I modified this recipe by reducing the amount of cheese and not topping with the croutons. It was very good and I will probably do it again.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted good. My husband and I enjoyed it but the kids didn't even though they like broccoli. I would reccomend this only as a side dish, we made the mistake of using it as a main entree.

Good recipe, but I think 4 heads of broccoli would have been too much.  I used 2 and found it very moist.  I actually liked the level of pepper but I cut back on the amount of salt and used half garlic salt.  I also added paprika.  I'm not sure what american cheese is, so I used Farmers.  Good recipe - quick and easy

Very yummy!  I used campbell's 'healthy request' condensed cream of mushroom - low fat and reduced sodium.  The dish was not too salty.  Great with crushed ritz crackers!  Thank you.

This was an excellent recipe. I made it for Christmas dinner using the suggestions.(substituting ritz crackers& cutting down the salt and pepper. It was wonderful. Even the broccoli haters went back for seconds. This will permanently replace green bean casserole around the holidays. Thanks Kaylee!

This is a great recipe that is a simple accompaniment to a nice meal.  I used white cheddar cheese instead, and that dressed it up more for my holiday meal. I also used less salt and Ritz crackers for topping.

!!DO NOT PUT ANYMORE SALT IN THIS RECIPE!! I used reduced fat cheese and low fat soup and this recipe still turned out too salty. It's a great dish, but I strongly recommend omitting the salt.

Overall, it was a good dish.  I altered the recipe with some of the suggestions listed.  I used ritz crackers instead of the croutons, and since I do like black pepper (but decided to cut back a little bit on it since I just wasn't making it for myself), I used 1 and a half teaspoons of pepper. It turned out great.  Although the kids didn't like it too well, my adult guests enjoyed it.  But most found the black pepper flavor to be too much.  I would suggest cutting back the pepper to your taste.  I did not find the dish to be over salty as some other reviews noted. A very easy dish to make, and clean up was a cinch because the casserole dish was empty.

Took this to the Inlaw's for Thanksgiving.  It was a hit.  I did reduce the pepper to 3/4 tsp and the salt to 3/4 tsp.  Turned out perfect.

This vegetable casserole was great for Thanksgiving this year. My husband isn't fond of broccoli, but he ate this dish right up!

I found this recipe way too salty and my nephews disliked the over abundance of pepper.  To make it more kid-friendly, use about half the amount of pepper called for and you can omit the salt altogether.

I also used Ritz crackers instead of croutons and this was AMAZING!  Great way to get non-veggie eaters to eat their vegetables.

This recipe was delicious!  I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom & I crushed Ritz crackers instead of the seasoned croutons.  It was a BIG hit, and I got many compliments on this dish.  Even a broccoli hater ate this dish.

I had tons of fresh homegrown broccoli that I needed to use and was so glad when I found this recipie.  I changed a few things and wasn't sure if it would work but my husbands face when he took his first bite said it all.  He LOVED it, and so did I. It was super fast, easy and delicious.  I didn't have croutons in the house so I used Pepperidge farm herb seasoned stuffing mix.  Also, instead of cooking the broccoli in water I first sauted it in a tiny bit of olive oil with some garlic for about 2 minutes.  Then I steamed it in a tiny bit of water.  I didn't measure the pepper but I did put a lot less than 2 teaspoons--that seems like a bit much.  Definitely one for the recipie box!  Enjoy!

I wanted to add a little something to a plain broccoli dish - and this worked out wonderful!! I had all these ingredients already, except I used frozen broccoli.  It was excellent!

My hubby is a vegetarian (not vegan) and thought this was the greatest. FYI Total Cooking from broccoli chopping to final product is about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes.
