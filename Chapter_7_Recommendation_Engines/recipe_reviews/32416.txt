Refreshing! My husband used a half cup of this and a half cup of cold Sun Tea and he said it was one of the best cold drinks he'd had in a long time.

This was a nice change from the norm. Great for a quick drink for lunch to help cool down in the heat. I did cut the sugar way down. Only stirred in a 1/4, but I don't like very sugary drinks. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for something different than the usual lemonade, to use up the millions of lemons from the tree. This was good! The kids approved.
