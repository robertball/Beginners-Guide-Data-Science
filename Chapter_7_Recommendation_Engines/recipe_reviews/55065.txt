I usually don't use recipes that aren't rated, but I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did.  These were great!  I did use the shortening, though I was tempted to use oil.  I don't know if it makes a difference or not, but they were good.  I was a little afraid the batter was too thin, but the final product proved me wrong.  It had the best texture of any waffles I've made and it had a good flavor. It was not super light and airy if that's what you want, nor was it super dense.  It had a nice blend of chewiness and substance.  My husband (who's very much a food critic) liked these very much also. I've tried over 10+ waffle recipes, and so far this is the winner.

I make these waffles all the time, I love them!  I do make them with butter and a little more sugar than the recipe calls for.

My waffle iron broke and I used this recipe for pancakes instead. My family went nuts...said that these were the most light and flavorful pancakes that they had ever had. I found a winner and a keeper!

These are excellent light and crisp waffles. We used non-salted butter instead of shortening and soymilk instead of milk.

I needed a quick recipe for Belgian waffles that didn't require 45 minutes to an hour rise time. This was perfect! Great taste and fantastic light texture. I've used egg beaters and whole eggs, it's great either way. I usually use unsalted butter melted instead of the shortening, but I've made them both ways depending on what's on hand.  I'll use this again and again for our Belgian waffles as it was exactly what I was looking for.

This was a perfectly good waffle recipe once the syrup was on. The plain waffle itself doesn't have much flavor. Definitely not a dessert waffle. Fairly bland, but again it works well with syrup. I think I'll stick to my recipe in the future. For those of you who substituted butter for the shortening, you should not be rating this recipe as that completely changes it. So does coating them with powdered sugar. My rating is for this recipe made as is, and as is, it does not have butter flavor and is not very sweet.

This is a great sweet waffle recipe.   I added only a pinch of salt and did beat egg white + sugar to stiff first.  Folding this mixture  in with everything at the last minute made the batter less runny. I also used butter instead of shortening.

As a result of having a very basic waffle maker, it did not come out super fluffy, but it did turn out great.  Tender, beautifully golden with wonderful aroma.  It has just the right amount of egg and milk for it to be wholesome.  I agree that it needs a little dusting of powdered sugar on top and goes great with fruit.  In my opinion, this is probably more of a dessert waffle recipe.

Update:  I made it several times more by now. :)  With the waffle iron preheated at medium high, it came out even better than before.  Just a tiny bit of golden brown/nice and crispy on the outside with inside still moist and wonderful.  1/2 milk and half water probably helped on this as well. Loving it as a late night snack hehe.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe for those who, like me, don't have time to make the traditional belgian waffle recipe.  Those recipes always call for yeast and sitting for an hour. Who has time for that??  So this morning when my twin 2 year olds were asking for "wapples" for breakfast, I mixed this up in a flash and made delicious waffles for the whole family. I have a Waring Professional waffle maker (the kind that you fill and turn) and this recipe made 4 giant waffles.  Plenty enough to freeze for another day.  I used the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect.

This recipe received rave reviews from my family!
Crispy on the outside, and sweet and fluffy on the inside.  The perfect waffle! For an autumn dish, serve with cooked sliced apples and caramel sauce. Yummy!!

I make a big homemade breakfast for my family every weekend and I think I can make this recipe in my sleep now!  It is the #1 requested breakfast in our house.  I will make a double batch and freeze the leftovers for my husband and son during the week.  I have tried other waffle recipes but this is definitely the best we have had.  They almost taste like waffle cone waffles.  A definite treat for my family, easy to make and absolutely delicious!

These waffles smelled great while cooking and had great flavor, but weren't dense enough for me.  If all that's being put on them is syrup they could hold up, but fruit is too heavy for them.

This is a wonderful recipe. My children ask for these a couple times a week. The only thing I change is the amount of salt. If you make these with the full teaspoon, you definately get a salty waffle. I cut it in half.

Really good!  I like whole wheat, so I substituted a 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  The batter was really thin so the next time I made it, I cut down the milk to 1 1/2 cup.  It's still pretty runny still so pour less batter than you think you need.  I think I would cut the salt down a bit as well.

I followed the recipe to a 'T'.  The batter was very thin and kept overflowing out of the sides of my waffle maker.  Even though I melted the shortening completely it hardened back up in the batter into hard little balls.  My family wasn't impressed with the taste.  Won't make these again.

These were very good waffles.  I did only use 1 1/2 cups milk and used butter instead of shortening.  I normally use Bisquick waffles, but was out so needed to make from scratch. These were delicious.  I added blueberries to the mix.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were delightful, and I cannot accurately describe the delicious vanilla aroma that filled the house :)  I was a little worried about how thin the batter was, but they turned out great!

1 1/2 cup of flour gives you a watery batter.  also melted shortening mixed with cold milk produces chunks. warm the milk

Made a vegan version of this recipe, using egg substitute and soy milk and it worked out great!  Also used a lactose free margarine (melted) instead of the shortening.  Loved the spongy and light texture of these waffles!

Wow!  This has to be the best waffle recipe I have tried.  I didn't do anything different to it.  Just had to make sure I beat the eggs/sugar real well.  My family will be asking for these every day for a while now!!! YUM YUM!!!

I tried this recipe and my boyfriend really enjoyed eating the waffles! I added just a bit more flour so the batter wasn't quite so thin. I prefer a little heavier of a waffle but these smelled and tasted great. This was a very easy recipe to follow and make and the outcome was tasty. I will be making them again.

Yum, these were good.  I used butter instead of shortening, and added a little bit extra sugar and a little bit extra flour.  Oh, yeah, and I used buttermilk instead of regular.

Very very good.  I have another recipe that I usually use, but wanted something faster.  I was worried that the liquid content would be too much, but they were very moist and had a slightly eggy texture.  I disagree with the other poster who said that they were only good with syrup on them, I felt the plain flavor was great and could eat them without sauce.  I used 1 cup ap flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat, and used butter instead of shortening.

I thought these were very good. Usually I use a baking mix, but these were much better and worth the little bit of extra time. It's going in the keeper file/pile.

This is not a bad recipe.  I needed to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour because it is way too thin.  Everyone enjoyed them but, I will go back to my old recipe next time.

Light, fluffy, delicious waffles.  I used melted butter instead of the shortening.  These were perfect with fresh berries and a little powdered sugar. And... so easy to make!

This tasted great. We made a vegan version using egg replacer and almond milk. We added about a 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour to bulk it up a bit for our Belgian waffle iron, and to add a little whole grain. We had some problems with the batter sticking to the waffle iron (not sure why; we've been making vegan waffles for over a year with this waffle iron; I have no idea why this batter would be any more sticky than the rest...) We added some walnuts toward the end for the last couple waffles. Served the waffles with maple syrup and blueberries. Delicious!

Very good, not too sweet waffle.  I especially like that you don't have to separate the eggs.

Quick, easy, and amazing!  We typically add about 1 tbsp of cinnamon to the batter and cook them in a deep waffle cooker.  I like to mix the batter the night before, keep in the refrig and then breakfast is as simple as warming up the waffle iron and pouring in the batter!!  Thanks for sharing this one - it's outstanding!

If we could rate this 6 stars, we would!  I don't like waffles and I usually make them for our daughter, so I decided to try a new one this morning. Before I was done making the second batch, she had already finished her plate! My husband said these were the best waffles he's ever had. These are so delicious I cannot rave about them enough.  We will continue to use the recipe but will throw in bananas, blueberries, etc. if we want to.  I had to make a couple of changes - used 1/2 & 1/2 as well as milk, oil instead of shortening because but it still turned out great.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Very good.  Nothing special.  The second time I added 1/2 a cup of strawberry fruit spread and !WOW!  I also put 1/2 a cup more flour because looks too watery.

The first time I made this recipe, the waffles came out very crispy with fluffy inside.  Very good.  However, the 2nd and 3rd time not so much.  I think it's because I used a hand mixer on the first time, and whisk for the other times.

My mother made these for us often. She was born in Norway and this is great finding the recipe. Although as I remember the origional or traditional recipe contained cardamon. Being 1/2 Norwegian this is a great tradition to carry on for my family

I had made this recipe, for waffles for the first time - it was crisp and wholesome. And the batter was as easy as making pancakes.

but in my opinion it needed fruit with it It's a light serving item that would be good on a saturday .

I was pretty impressed with these.  I halfed the ingredients and used Splenda Baking sugar instead of regular sugar.  They hold up well, have a wonderful aroma, and met my expectations of a good waffle.  Next time I'll add a little whip cream for fun!

These waffles were very tasty.  I baked them in my Belgian waffle iron.  The dough is very airy and suites that type of iron well.

Light, crispy and delicious!  My husband hates heavy, dense waffles and most of the recipes I try come out that way.  These were different.  They will now be my go-to recipe.  I did use butter instead of shortening, but the rest was the same.  Yum :)

I liked it because it's simple and quick to make. I swapped out the all purpose flour for whole wheat pastry flour / all purpose combo (60:40).  Not too sweet so you could adapt it to your taste.

I think this is a very good recipe. The waffles are lite and very crispy on the edges. The first time I made this recipe I put berries on the waffles with syrup and it was OUTSTANDING!!!!! The berry juice made it better!!

Very simple, tasty recipe. I did add a quarter of cocoa powder and reduced the amount of flour to accommodate for the cocoa powder. I also added white chocolate chips and it tasted amazing.One tip for someone who never used a waffle maker (like myself) is if you can't lift the waffle up with ease, don't attempt to take it out. I usually rotate it after I realize it's not done.

Best waffles I ever made.  The kids request them at least once a week.  Easy enough to make on a school day.  I get a bit lazy and don't beat the eggs& sugar, and they are still fabulous.

We have a new waffle iron so I'm trying out recipes to find one that tastes good and works with our Cuisinart Classic Waffle Maker.    The one that is in the manual works good, but doesn't taste very good.   

I decided to try this one out because it uses less shortening, butter, oil than most of the others I've seen.

I found the taste very good.   I tried one of the waffles plain for a taste test.   The flavor was nicely balanced and you could really taste the vanilla in it.

The only slight change I made was to use 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon.   We use a finely ground sea salt and it has a stronger salt flavor.

I did knock off one star because the first waffle I cooked exactly to instructions came out over-cooked.  It was dry and too brown.   After playing with the settings I found that on our waffle maker 4 1/2 works really well.

Just what we were looking for!  My husband and I made these waffles this morning and they met all of our qualifications:  they were crispy, toasted brown on the outside and fluffy but chewy and substantial on the inside.  They were just the right balance of sweet too, perfection with a smear of butter and a drizzle of maple syrup.  I resisted the urge to change anything and I am so glad I followed the recipe, it is just right.  Also, it made exactly 4 waffles, as promised. Finally, the perfect waffle, quick to make and AMAZING to eat! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, it is now our family favorite.

Just what I was looking for... crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, ingredients that I normally have on hand, easy to substitute to make lactose-free (just had to use lactose free milk instead of regular).  I will keep coming back to this recipe since it is quick and easy too.

Wonderful! I was a little leery of using shortening, as it solidified pretty quickly, and the batter was pretty thin. But these waffle have great texture and flavor. Will be using this recipe many times in the future! I did add 1T sugar after the first 2 waffles made, to add a little more flavor. The batter made 8 waffles.

It looked a little runny then the ones that I have been making for years that came down from my family. But this recipe is better by far. This is the recipe I'm handing down to my kids.

The batter was definitely thinner than I expected, but I followed the recipe exactly, and both times they came out amazing.  They were light and fluffy, with just a touch of vanilla flavor.  Out of both batches I made we had no leftovers.

OK, not spectacular. I needed to set my waffle iron to a dark setting, otherwise they turned out too soft and doughy.

These were very good, though I think I still like Emma's Belgian waffles best.  I liked these ones best in my big thick belgian waffle iron, in the thin little scandanavian iron there just wasn't enough to them.  Normally I like the thin ones best!

Great recipe!  Sprinkle some powdered sugar on them and they taste just like a funnel cake from the fair.  I added 1 more T of sugar than the recipe called for and used melted butter instead of shortening.  My family loved them so much I'll have to double the recipe next time!

I was in Norway last summer.  These waffles were a popular snack that you could get from street vendors or cafes.  They were served with raspberry(?) jam and powdered sugar.  I just bought a waffle iron and tried this recipe out.  Spot on!

Light and fluffy waffles. I used 3x the sugar, and used oil instead of melted shortening. These are crisp only if you freeze them, then toast to reheat. Having taken cooking classes, I know that the ratio of milk to flour should be 1:1, so I used 1 and 1/2 cups of milk instead.

Amazingly crisp yet not dry!  I sub'd in for the flour - 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup corn meal.  Served with honey and some fresh strawberries - great.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is the only waffle recipe that has worked for me so far!  I never made waffles until my husband got a waffle maker for his birthday 2 years ago. I have tried a few recipes, but they never turned out.  These were crispy and had enough substance to chew, instead of some that feel like you're biting into air.  I sprayed the waffle maker with cooking spray and they came out of the waffle maker very easy. My husband loves waffles and I will make these again!

This recipe was great!  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I became a little nervous for a second after I mixed the dry ingredients with the wet that it was going to be too runny.  But quickly, my anxiety dissolved as the batter thickened up.  I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  They were fluffy and tender and slightly crispy on the outside.  I used melted butter instead.  I reserved about 1/3 cup of milk because I found the batter very very wet.  I did however let it stand for 15 mins(set the table, started the sausages etc) then the batter thickened up quite well.  Would like to try with less vanilla next time.

This recipe is wonderful!  Its very quick to make and I really like the fact that you don't have to seperate the egss like you do with some waffle recipes.  I needed to make this dairy-free, so for the 1 3/4 cups of milk I substituted 1 cup of unsweetened soymilk and 3/4 cup of soy creamer and this worked well. At first I was concerned that the batter was a little runny, but after letting it sit for about 5 minutes while my waffle iron heated up the batter thickend a little bit and was fine.

these were good but i was really looking forward to a german dessert waffle. as some of the other reviewers said it was sweet but it was no where sweet enough to be a german dessert waffle. i also had a really hard time getting the shortning to mix once i added the milk.  the waffle still turned out good

Cut back on the salt a little.  The batter is runny, so I added just a bit more flour, and I separated the eggs to fold in stiff whites.  Be careful how you mix it or you'll end up with lots of lumps!  Very good and the aroma is heavenly.

I followed the recipe to a "T" but these just didn't turn out to be anything spectaculer. Or even really thatt good. I have a great waffle iron which i use often and they stuck pretty well. They were neither bad or good looking on the outside, and the flavor was rather bland with a faint aftertaste of baking powder. I would only use these when topping with whipped cream and fruit.

I only put in 1 egg because that is all I had but the batter was very runny.  I prefer it to be a little more thicker.  I also like a more crispier waffle.  These do work in a pinch if I run out of Bisquick.

Heavenly good waffles. I just didn't know at what temperature to set my waffle maker, since it's got that facility, but after trying out a bit, the waffles came out really great! Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Perfect!

These " vafler " taste just like the ones my Norwegian high school buddy's mom used to make when they had me over. I love waffles, and couldn't quite remember just what was so good about hers. Until now.  Five stars. Only (sort of) change: I used coconut oil for the shortening.

This is the best waffle recipe I have ever made!! I used butter and only 2 teaspoons of baking powder (as I thought it sounded like a lot). The batter is thin compared to most other waffle batters I've made. It also cooks faster. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!

This recipe will replace another one I've been using for years since this one doesn't require separating  the egg yolk from the  white and and beating them separately.  One change and one addition:  I used melted organic lard in place of the shortening (as I don't use shortening anymore).  The addition -  after I poured the batter onto the waffle maker I added a handful of lightly chopped pecans on top.  The nuts add flavor, texture and health benefits!

I make waffles frequently but these are, hands down, the best.  Not having shortening I used melted butter as suggested by others.  I also used a whisk instead of my electric mixer because I just didn't feel like pulling out a device (plus whisking is great for the biceps lol).

So, this is not a recipe for traditional “Belgian waffles” that we in the US are used to, so if your waffle maker has the deep grooves, this won’t really work very well. The batter is going to be thin like pancake batter, but because it has all the baking powder, it puffs up pretty quickly in the iron. That being said, I own a Danish made stovetop waffle maker and this is a great recipe. I actually usually use butter when I make these, but I was out, so I used olive oil. They actually are pretty tasty. I’m eating them right now with some lingonberry preserves and a nice cup of coffee. 

I also added cardamom and nutmeg, but that’s just how my bestamor apparently would make them for my dad, so when I started cooking, I did.

I have one child that eats everything no questions asked, and one that complains about everything. I made these today with no changes and absolutely no complaints! The leftovers are in the freezer to be enjoyed before our upcoming beach trip! I want to try these with butter instead of shortening next time.

I love the fact that the waffles aren't too sweet. Just the mild sweetness - exactly like it should be. Wonderful combination with strawberries and raspberry - passionfruit sauce. Breakfast highlight.

I used coconut milk because that's what we use. My vanilla use is a little heavy.  They were light and fluffy good.  I'll use this recipe again.

OK, so I tried it exactly as written, but I didn't have shortening, only coconut oil.  I used the coconut oil and it gave it a delicious, light coconut flavor.  Oh...I did add one thing:  I sprinkled pearl sugar on the waffles after I poured the batter in the iron.  They were amazing!!

So why am I only giving this 3 stars?  Because I can still taste the baking powder and I finished my last waffle 10 minutes ago...

Delicious!  I couldn't make them fast enough.  I used butter instead of shortening, but other than that - great recipe!  Reminds me of making vafler with my Bestemor in Norway.

I swear I don't usually make tons of substitutions, but this time I doubled the recipe and did this: two cups white flour, 1 cup whole wheat; and, no eggs so used egg whites from a carton (3 tbsp = 1 large egg). Wow! Super fluffy and crisp on the outside - and no one noticed the whole wheat! ??

We used Smart Balance instead of shortening.  I think we will used less salt next time and maybe add things like fruit and nuts.  This was a great easy breakfast for our 4 person family. Very filling!  Oh we also used 1 C all purpose flour and 1/2 C wheat flour.  Thanks.

This is now my go-to recipe for making waffles at home. We use melted butter instead of the shortening and they come out delicious! There's just something about the butter and vanilla combo that makes this recipe amazing.

I received a new Belgian waffle maker for Christmas and this was the first recipe I tried. It worked out slick and made four beautiful, golden round waffles. They weren't super flavorful, which is just fine. They are a good basic waffle that will do well with any topping of your choice!

By far my family's favorite waffles.  I do use butter rather than shortening and go with only 1 1/2C milk to thicken it a little.  Also good with a 1/4t ground cardamom added to the batter.

Very good. I may play with the recipe next time. They had a nice mild vanilla taste. Trying melted butter in stead of shortening may be the trick. I will be making this again, if low on time exactly as is, if not I'm going to play a little with ingredients. A keeper. TFS

These were really good. I used melted butter instead of shortening and only used 1/2 tsp salt. The batter is VERY thin, but after reading other reviews that they turn out I didn't change anything else. My waffle maker only held 1/3C of batter at a time.

This is not a recipe you want to try if you like fluffy waffles.  These came out flat and heavy.  Could not get them to rise in the waffle maker.  They pretty much tasted like egg.

A delicious, sweet treat.  Super Awesome!  Totally Rad!  If waffles were guitar players, these ones would be Jimi Hendrix.  I chose this recipe because it is so simple, and I have all the ingredients.  The fact that it makes a great part of a meal is rather nice too.

Hands down best waffles i've made so far. They are similar to a waffle cone recipe that I used to bake ice cream cones in a specialized press - thin batter, sweet taste, great consistency. I used butter instead of shortening though, but they still turned out great.

This recipe was very runny.  I had to add about a cup of flour and another teaspoon of baking powder to make this cook right.  Also, the melted shortening gets lumpy and I had to heat the whole mixture up to get the shortening melted and mixed  into the batter.It did tatse good after these changes.

Very easy Very fast and nice eggy texture. I prepared with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white and subbed margarine for the shortening. My kids gave them a huge thumbs up.  Thanks!

Great waffles!  i did reduce the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. and they were still a bit on the salty side...I'll use 1/4 tsp. next time.  Great texture and taste!

I loved the flavor of these, but they weren't as fluffy as I hoped for.  That might be since my baking powder is a bit "aged" so to speak.  I'm going to try again with fresh baking powder.

Very fluffy pancakes!  I substituted margarine for shortening without any problems.

Wow these were really good. I was skeptical when I saw how thin the batter was but they turned out great and the smell while they were cooking was amazing.

This was not very good.  Even though the batter is runny, it still puffs up during cooking.  Still the batter was  very plain.  We sprinkled banana slices on the iron first which really saved it.  But the batter itself is plain and doesn't have much of a crunch on the outside.

I was a bit concerned at first, with how runny the batter came out, but these waffles are fantastic! They've ousted our previous waffle recipe of four years. I used 1/2 c of oat flour for part of the flour, added a sprinkle of ground cloves and a sprinkle of ground nutmeg, as well as some ground up pecans. They were a hit and will be a (frequent) repeat!

These were wonderful!  They were so light and fluffy and very flavorful.  All 6 of my children loved them!
