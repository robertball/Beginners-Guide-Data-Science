This recipe has been used in my family for generations with a slightly different variation. We use either shortening or butter and add one (1) addtional cup of oatmeal. We also roll the dough into "logs" (about 2" x 6") then chill for about 1 hour. Then slice into 1/4" thick cookies.  Either way, an absolute winning recipe.

These were absolutely delicious Darlene! Because some reviewers complained about their cookies coming out flat, I used heaping teaspoons of the baking soda and baking powder. I added chocolate chips to the mix and made rather large cookies that took about thirteen minutes to bake. Like others stated, even if the cookies don't appear to be done, take them out anyway and let them set up. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

These cookies ROCK! This is an awesome recipe and you can mix it up a bit if you want! I added Chocolate Chips, Butterscotch Chips for more flavor. Be careful not to overbake - it's easily done.. I have made these twice in two weeks, once family came over a devoured them ALL! These are going on my Christmas cookie list. :)

This cookie is so DELICIOUS!!!  I did make a few changes to the original recipe based on the other reviews.  I sustituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the shortening and reduced the white and brown sugars to 2/3 cup each.  Also  increased the amts for baking soda and baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp each.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and approx 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp cream of tarter.  Also my "cups" for the oats and coconut were heaping. The dough was quite wet so I chilled it for about an hour.  Once chilled I rolled it into balls (heaping TBSP size) and baked for 9-10 minutes until just turning golden.  Let cool for a few minutes on pan and then removed.  These cookies turned out chewy and perfect!  They turned out the perfect shape and I had no problems with then being too flat!  These are a new family favorite and will definately make again!!  Next time I might add raisins or butterscotch chips, which would be very yummy as well!!

This recipe was so easy that I was able to make it with baby on hip. I halved the recipe and made four minor changes:

* I used only butter (no shortening on hand).

* I added a little extra oatmeal as previous reviewers suggested.

* I mixed all the ingredients together in my Kitchenaid (I didn't separate wet and dry).

* I shortened the cooking time until the cookies appeared baked on the sides and still moist in the middle.

The end result was wonderful. The buttery coconut taste was warm and exotic. The coconut and oatmeal added a nice texture. The cookies were a little flatter than most recipes I have made, but undercooking them allowed them to remain moist. I will definitely make this recipe again.

WAY too sweet.  I can't believe other reviewers are adding sugar by rolling the dough in it.  Makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it.  I followed the recipe except that I added cinnamon per others' suggestions and added semi-sweet chocolate chips to half the dough. I was a little disappointed, but this recipe still has merit in that the buttery coconut flavor went very nicely with the oatmeal.  Next time I will reduce the sugar, add nuts (personal preference), and use all butter.  I may even add some more oatmeal and coconut so that the cookie has more substance.  In my opinion, this is a great base for you to make alterations until it suits your taste.

These cookies are fantastic!!! I made balls about 3/4" in diameter and got 5 dozen delicious thin, crispy cookies. I added chocolate chips to some of them and raisins to some others, and they came out great!!! My family especially liked the ones with raisins. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Just made these cookies 10 minutes ago and they are great! I did add all the suggestions listed-pinch of cinnamon,salt, and cream of tartar. I was out of vanilla so experimenting used a dash of vanilla flavored coffee and they turned out fine. But a strong hand is needed when mixing the ingred. at the end. Also watch the timing as suggested-very important. Thanks for your great recipe!

This cookies are AWESOME - I added a tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt to the dry ingreidients. I also used 'cream of tartar' instead of baking powder my cookies were not flat at all. I refridgerated for about an hour, and rolled them in powdered sugar, rolled them into balls on the cookie sheets than pressed like a peanut butter cookie. They are just great.

Incredible recipe.  I wasn't sure how the coconut would taste with oatmeal...but it was wonderful.  It keeps the cookies extremely moist.  I also added some pecans and the cookies came amazing.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe! :)

great cookies.  Make really big cookies for 2 dozen.  Had to bake a little longer but not too long so they don't get hard (per recipe).

My cookies came out perfect. I don't care for too sweet of a cookie so I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening. I also added craisins to half my batch and my family went nuts! Thanks for the great recipe!

These are delicious!  I just pulled a batch out of the oven and they taste fabulous when they're warm.  My only change is that I baked them on parchment rather than greasing the sheet and they came out perfect.  I agree with the reviewers who said to take them out before they look all the way cooked.  Mine were barely turning brown around the edges and still looked raw in the middle, but after they cooled for a few mintues, they were just wonderful. Thanks for this recipe, I'll definitely be making them again.

I like these cookies, they just didn't have much flavor without tweaking the recipe, and they were too sweet for my taste. I used sweetened coconut cause I couldn't find unsweetened (darn you, podunk grocery stores), and cut the white sugar to half a cup. Next time I will use unsweetened coconut AND cut the sugar.  I also threw in some dark chocolate chips (which were good), but next time I will use white because I think the flavor will be more complementary. I didn't have problems with flattening, mine came out soft and pillow-y. I made the balls a heaping tsp, and baked for 8min 30sec to 9 minutes. My oven timer goes by minute increments only so the 8 min 30 sec chained me to the kitchen in perpetual count-down mode. But leaving the kitchen with cookies in the oven gives me separation anxiety anyway, so it worked out fine!

I have this recipe in an old receipe book but it calls for just butter.  I made these excactly as the recipe calls for except used heaping spoonfulls of the baking soda and powder and they were better than my old receipe.  They look like the picture soft and puffy.  Just delicious, thank you for the recipe Darlene.

Very good.  The coconut and oatmeal blend together well.  I used butter rather than shortening. Will make again.

These are fantastic cookies-- I halved the recipe but still used the full cup of coconut, and added chopped pecans and bittersweet chocolate chunks at the end. They smelled incredible while baking, and turned out nice and chewy. Just be sure to take them out just as they start to set, still very soft-- don't wait until they look done, or they'll end up too hard!

AWESOME cookies!! I subbed in my gluten free all purpose blend which worked wonderfully. I also added a cup of raisins and subbed in lemon extract instead of vanilla. I used two teaspoons, instead of one for lemon extract and they were perfect. Everyone raved about them. A perfect, sweet and yet tart cookies!

These are the most amazing cookies better than my mother in law's. I also added more oatmeal 3/4 cups more and used shortening and butter. Allow them to cool on a tea towel and they'll come out chewy and soft.

fantastic. did tweek some.added a lil cinnamon and walnuts. used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and used butter instead of shortening. also to keep your cookies from spreading thin, don't grease the cookie sheets. there is enough butter/shortening in the recipe to keep them from sticking.

These were amazing!  I made them for a friend who said her grandma made her oatmeal coconut cookies. The only change I made was to use heaping teaspoons of the baking soda and powder, based off another reco. that otherwise the cookies come out flat. I may experiment next time with more coconut- based on my friend's feedback. Also, I may cut both sugars back by a 1/4 c. each. They were really sweet. Funnily enough, once they cooled, they didn't seem as sweet as they did right out of the oven. Delicious!

Made the recipe exactly as written, no changes.  Made sure not to overcook, and the texture is soft and chewy.  Not a fancy cookie, but it tastes pretty darn good.

WOW.  Best oatmeal cookie yet!  But I made some changes, for my own notes: Used all butter and no shortening, an extra cup of oats, heaping teaspoons of baking powder and soda, no coconut, and I used wheat flour.  I measured each cookie out at 1 ounce and baked for 10 minutes.  Again... WOW.

YUMMY!    These are as good as the  coconut white choc chip nut cookie I get at my favorite cafe! Now I can make them.   I cut recipe to 1/2 for 2 of  us.   I did add 1/4 t. salt--along with some white choc chips and chopped walnuts - they  bake perfectly on parchment lined cookie pans, for  10 min  at 350. I  let them  sit on pan  for 2 min.,  then I remove to rack to cool.  They are  crisp and chewy!!  thanks for posting this recipe -it will be a new favorite of mine!

Delicious cookies!! I made 3/4 the full recipe which yielded 35 full sized cookies.  I read other reviews before baking these cookies and made some modifications that definitely improved on the original recipe: (a) I added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon; (b) I added just a dash of cream of tartar; (c) I added about a half a cup of chocolate chips; (d) I added just a dash of salt.  I recommend that you keep an eye on the cooking of these cookies because I think if you allow them to cook too much that they will get too hard.  I pulled them out when they looked slightly underdone and were just starting to turn golden - that was the right amount of time for them to cook because they firmed up to being chewy after cooling.  So great - thanks for the recipe!

Quite possibly the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made!  I added craisins and an extra cup of oats as suggested by a previous review.  Excellent recipe.

I did use the 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt that some members recommended.  I wasn't sure how much cream of tartar to use since I couldn't find an exact amt. so I didn't add this. I baked only the 10 min. and they were perfect and golden each time.  Soft inside with a little crunch to the outside.  Just to see I added raisins to a couple and pecans to a couple.  Like them better without these but I am sure it is just a matter of taste!  Thanks!  Great cookies!

I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon cloves, 1 teaspoon cream of tartar, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Wow!  Sweet and spicey and crispy chewy.  Wonderful. 4.5 stars.

I didn't find anything great about these cookies. They we're either baked to much and that made them crunchie or they were raw. You couldn't get them in between. I also like puffy cookies and these were flat.
I will not do these again

These cookies were great right out of the oven but were a little sweet for my tastes.... However, if you don't mind sweet cookies, these are a great snack.  The oatmeal and coconut compliment eachother and now I have requests for a second batch!

This recipe is the way I have always wanted them to taste. The only thing I tweeked based on the reviews is that I  added a 1/2 cup more oats for substance a 1/2 tsp. salt and for my own flair used butter flavored Crisco. I also topped each one with a half pecan.  Its a tasty and decorative touch. These are a keeper!

These cookies are delicious!  hubby ate them all day long.  followed recipe exactly, bake 10 min exactly for sure. could only bake 1 sheet at time otherwise bottom rack did not bake all the way.  While my cookies are delicious they don't look nearly as good as the ones in the picture, mine were very flat :-(

Delicious and chewy cookies. I did add 1/2 tsp salt as I don't like cookies without salt. I also added nuts and chocolate chips. A little cinnamon might be good.

these are delicious!  I followed the suggestions of others and added extra oatmeal and coconut, threw in a pinch of salt and added some vinegar to the baking soda (i didn't have tartar).  I also reduced both sugars to 3/4 C.  I threw them in the fridge for a while and then rolled into balls that i flattened slightly.  I baked for 12 minutes and they were perfectly baked and not at all flat.  Then i topped them with a  coconut flavored glaze.  They were great plain but glazed they are AMAZING!

3.7.  I had serious doubts about these cookies.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used all butter and added an extra cup of oatmeal.  I also toasted the oatmeal before mixing into the batter.  What I had doubts with was the batter.  Since I added that extra cup of oatmeal, the batter ended up being very thick.  I also didn't mix the dry and wet ingredients separately on account of time.  So...wow, it still turned out good.  These cookies are definitely crispier than I generally make...but  it would have been a lot crispier and flatter had I not frozen the dough.  i also used a melon scooper to make things easier.  Pretty solid recipe.  i do wonder what the shortening would've added to the cookies.

I love these cookies-a quick addition to a classic oatmeal cookie. I wish I had raisins on hand, but I didn't, so following a different recipe on this site, I chopped a few maraschino cherries and added them to half the dough. Yummy! I also added orange peel, which went great with the coconut. I added extra baking powder/soda because of the other reviews (and also because if there's someone that can ruin a cookie recipe, it's me!) My cookies turned out great, but still sort of flat, so next time I'll add cream of tarter per some of the other reviewers. All in all, a great recipe to tweak and make your own!

Ok, do the heaping tsp. of soda and powder..... with the exact recipe and it turns out great.  BUT, before you use the last of the batter... try one batch by rolling the balls of dough in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar... OMG...... it is wayyyyyyy better.

Loved these cookies!  I halved the recipe and still made 24.  Used all butter.  Baked for 11 minutes and they were still a little too soft for me (even after sitting) so I might bake another 30 seconds or so.  Definitely not as puffy as in the photo.  But flavor is right on!

Not bad, but a bit too sweet for my taste.  There wasn't really anything special about these cookies, even though I LOVE coconut and I LOVE oatmeal cookies... I'm not sure what it is but they just tasted bleh to me. Will not make again.

I just had one of these warm out of the oven and YUM!! So good! I was worried about the dough being so wet/sticky when putting on the cookie sheet, but it didn't make any difference. My 2 year old son ate one too and came back for more!!

Just finished baking these cookies.  Changed the recipe a little by adding 3/4 cup white chocolate chips to the dry ingredients.  Since the recipe didn't specify what size spoon to use I made them a rounded Tablespoon size, and got 36 cookies in the batch.  Smelled wonderful, tasted even better.  The recipe instructions could be a little more precise (which is why I only gave this recipe 4 stars) .  But the cookies are wonderful , will definately add these to my recipe box to make again.

Yum! These are my new favorite cookie! I made these to send to my husband in Iraq and couldn't help but to snag a few. They are exceedingly chewy and have a great light coconut flavor. I made a full batch which made about 2 dozen large cookies. I substituted butter for the shortening. Great.

AMAZING cookies! However, I made a few adjustments to the recipe: I didnt have shortening and put in 1 cup of butter instead and I added 1tsp of cinnamon for some added flavor. Also I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup due to coconuts natural sweetness. They now have the perfect amount of sweetness and they are incredibly moist!!

Freezing cold outside.  Wife out of town.  Just me and the dog.  I decided to try this recipe but only used the directions as a guide. First of all I used whole wheat flour and all butter.  I used turbinado sugar instead of white. Cut sugars to two thirds cup each then added 2 tbls of blackstrap molasses.  I added another cup of oatmeal.  Also added cream of tarter, nutmeg & cinnamon.  Then I added a cup of raisins, a cup of chocolate chips and finally put a whole almond on top before baking.  I like harder cookies so I baked them 13 min.  First batch turned out very good.  Second batch is smaller for more crunch.

Great recipe just as written. After making it a few times, I have made a few alterations to suit our taste. I substitute applesauce for the shortening and use 1/2tsp of almond extract & 1/2tsp vanilla. These have become a family favorite.

Had a sweet craving the other night and this fit the bill wonderfully. I reduced the sugar and subbed applesauce for the shortening. The cookies were cakey and moist and delicious. What a great way to mix a love of oatmeal and coconut! Thanks!

deffinitly a great choice. never heard of it before but I am glad I tried it. i thought they were not going to turn out cause the dough was hard with all the oats but they were a little crunchy and chewey. if they get hard just put a piece of bread in the jar with them and they will be soft again.

These cookies were very sweet!  I really enjoyed the flavor combination of coconut and oats.  Next time, I'll probably add some spices, such as cinnamon, or semi-sweet chocolate chips to give the cookies a bit more flavor.  I was able to get about three dozen cookies from this recipe.

Wonderful recipe. Added some "apple pie spices" and vanilla. Will dip them in melted chocolate next time. Thanks for the advice on pulling them from the oven immediately. These cookies were picture perfect, not flat at all. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are just delicious!  I did use canola oil instead of the shortening and egg substitute (we're trying to be healthier in 2006), and we all loved them!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made these cookies with my 3 year old and 1 year old.  So easy and SO good.  After reading reviews I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt. I also used butter flavor crisco, which I think probably enhanced the flavor. I only baked for 10 min, and removed even if they didn't look all the way done, they set up nicely and are an awesome crisp outside, chewy inside texture.  I think next time I'll try some white chocolate chips and craisens added in.  THANKS!

I loved these cookies. I made a few minor changes though. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 bag of dark chocolate chocolate chips. I used a large size scoop (3 tbsp) and baked for 12 minutes. They came out PERFECT. It's true - even if they don't look done, take them out. They will be perfect ... Thanks for the great recipe

I made these cookies for a youth center celebration- lots of food... they were a hit! I added cinnamon, as one reader suggested and used a sugar/non sugar blend in place of the white sugar. I followed the baking directions, taking them out while they still looked a bit underdone.. they were perfect! I used a cookie scoop for measuring so they were all the same size. I'll be handing this recipe to a lot of parents and counselors. Thank you Darlene, for submitting this recipe... Darleena

I HATE COCONUT, except in this recipe.  I added toffee candy bar pieces to mine and people couldn't leave them alone.  Some of the negative ratings said the spread too much,add more flour, it could be your butter or flour.  I always bake a test cookie to check how they will come.

Excellent recipe! I watched the cookies closely to be sure not to overbake, like others mentioned they didn't look exactly done but pulled them out to set up. I made some without chips, then with butterscotch chips & chocolate chips as well. I have darker pans so I decreased the temp on the oven about 10 degrees, turned out great! Thanks for this recipe, it is now a family favorite in our home! :)

Dry and much too sweet even with cutting back on the quantity of sugar. I thought my cookies were too dense - the bottoms were browned nicely but the tops looked undercooked.

I made these cookies to bring to a friends BBQ and were they ever a hit!!!! Everyone loved them! They are easy to make as well. Like the other reviewers, I halved the sugar (I put 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white) and I also used coconut oil instead of shortening. This is a great substitute that keeps the cookies healthier! I also threw some white chocolate chips in for an extra kick. Definitely worth a try!

This cookies are awesome!I shared some with family members and they couldn't stop raving about them! My only changes were 1/2 butter 1/2 coconut oil, reduced the sugar a bit and added a little extra oatmeal and coconut. Simply perfect! Thanks for sharing Darlene.

These cookies are delicious! I balled the cookies before I made them to ensure perfectly round circles, and since I made small cookies they flattened just a bit to a perfect looking morsel! I also experimented by adding raisins and chocolate chips to some of the cookies. These cookies have a dough that is very well balanced and you can add little things and it won't change the consistency much! I would consider adding some cocoa powder next time or maybe cinnamon chips!

Incredible.
I added nutmeg, milk (1 cup) & honey (2 oz), then glazed them with honey & returned them to the oven for further crisping. Oh, I used Splenda (white & brown) instead of real sugar.

I agree with Noochie - these were way too sweet. And 10 min at 350 degrees gave me really thin cookies that fell apart. I used a double layered baking sheet for most except for 1 dark non-stick pan...the cookies on the dark pan out better, didn't spread as much and held together like a cookie should.

Everyone loved these cookies. Be sure to read hints from other reviews.
Use natural saturated fat instead of shortening.

Very tasty!  I halved the fat and the sugar, using lactose-free margarine and brown sugar.  My coconut was sweetened.  I will make this again!

Very tasty.  Tried the applesauce substitution suggested in the comments.  They turned out like little mini cookie-cake-muffins!  So glad they were for a gathering so they didn't temp me very long! :)

OMG..... Best cookie ever, and I have baked A LOT of cookies in my time!  I added cinnamon and walnuts and prepared my cookie sheets with virgin coconut oil. Texture is not crunchy and not chewy....just right.

I've never understood people altering the recipe as it's written the first time they try it. I made this recipe as written and it's fabulous! A caterer that I've used at work had this cookie on a platter of assorted cookies... he called them Cowboy Cookies. This recipe IS that cookie! Took some to a neighbor as a thank you gift and they loved them too!

wonderful flavor and texture. Even the ones I over baked made a pretty awesome bread pudding. Top with a little pineapple-rum sauce (easy on any extra sugar, though). MMMMMMMMMMM

Made as directed (I might have been a little generous with the coconut) and it turned out fine.  First batch was a little hard, so I adjusted the timing and the rest came out softer.  Nothing spectacular, but it was a nice change of pace from the standard oatmeal cookie.  I'll definitely make these again at some point.

These were tasty cookies! Mine were very flat and spread a ton. I'm an experienced baker, so I know my method was correct. I used all butter and that does affect spread, but I hate using shortening! These turned out crunchy, but good.

Used all butter, 1.5c whole wheat flour + 0.5c almond meal, decreased sugar to 3/4c white, 3/4c brown, increased baking powder to 2t, 1c rolled oats + 2c old fashioned, added 0.5t almond extract, and a handful of walnuts. Delicious, puffy, chewy, maybe slightly too sweet still. Next time will decrease to 1c sugar total.

I think the serving size of 2 dozen is way off. My batch yielded 44 medium to large cookies and they were raw in the middle at 10 minutes. If I would have made 24, they would have been the size of a saucer and taken considerably longer to cook. I left mine on the cookie sheet after cooking about 11-12 minutes. They are very soft coming straight from the oven but continue to cook and harden. The next day they were a good consistency. They taste really good.

I have made these cookies twice, and they are simply delicious!  I, however, amended the recipe every so slightly: I used 1/4 cup of organic shortening and 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup of white sugar and a TB of brown sugar.  I also used old fashioned oats, and added a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon and 1/4 ts of cream of tartar.  My cookies were chewy in the middle, and crispy around the edges, and I indulged way more than I should have, so I will have to limit these cookies to when I have company over :)

So easy, so good! Definately will make again and pass on recipe!  Followed recipe exactly and cookies were not flat.  May add more oatmeal next time, just for my own personal preference. Baked for about 15 minutes and cookies were still chewy, jsut the way I like them!  Was worried that they'd be doughy, but were just great!  Added choc chips to some for the kids- terrific.  Thank you!!!

Take a look at the 4 photos (as of 1/25/10).  They are all different.  When I made these cookies, they came out wide and spread out and flat.  When my friend made them, no nuts or chocolate chips,  they looked more like photo 1; round and high.  I don't know what she used for shortening, or if she used butter too, but I used Smart Balance and butter and added nuts and chocolate chips.  The first 3 test cookies came out flat, unattrative and I couldn't really taste the coconut.  So I added another cup.  Still, the taste was mostly chocolate chip.  I didn't see the reason for making a cookie with coconut if it was only going to taste like a chocolate chip cookie.  If I ever make these again, I would only add nuts and I would try Crisco instead of Smart Balance to see if I could get away from that flat, deflated look.  A prime example of one recipe, several different results as you can see by those photos.

Wonderful cookies! I just used margarine, no shortening... and some advice from previous reviews and they turned out great! Cooked to a very nice shape and will definitely be a regular to my cookie jar!  Thanks for the recipe.

Nice cookie recipe but a little too sweet and bland for me.  If I were to make it again I would reduce the sugar and maybe add some raisins and/or nuts.

Was a tad too sweet, next time will cut back the sugars to 2/3 cup. Did make the following changes:

1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup walnuts
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 tsp cinnamon.

Otherwise the cookie was pretty good.

Good cookies!  I added an extra 1/3 c. of coconut and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon along with a few shakes of nutmeg.  I imagine they'd be even better with white and/or milk chocolate chips.

I think this is as close as it gets to a perfect cookie!!  Totally awesome recipe.  My cookies came out flat on the first run, so I tried the second batch in the oven after the dough had been refrigerated, still flat but less so.  On the third run, I rolled them in sugar, and these came out fine.  I think the biggest problem is that I didn't have shortening and used butter in place.  Excellent and very decadent!!

I made these cookies last night and they were delicious if you follow the recipe alone.  However, if you add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of crushed heath bars to the dough, they are fabulous and merit 4.5 stars.  This is a perfect recipe to add your favorite cookie extras to.

So delicious!  Had no trouble with hard cookies.  I did add a quarter teaspoon of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out wonderfully.

Ok, this is a very good cookie, but it isn't the PERFECT oatmeal cookie recipe I have been searching for.  I've eaten the perfect cookie only once and it is at Paradise Bakery in Portland, Oregon.  They have a oatmeal raisin coconut cookie that is to die for!  Anyway, I made this recipe as it was except that I added 1 cup of golden raisins.  I like my cookies a little crispier and almost had to double the time so they weren't soggy inside.  I also added 1 tsp of cinammon.  Still...the cookie wasn't that flavorful.  I guess my search is still on.  However, this is probably the best recipe I've found so far....if that helps anyone!  Plus, my picky husband who hates coconut enjoyed the cookie. (That is what pushed me to 4 stars instead of 3!)

It is a very tasty cookie.  So nice and chewy!  My husband loves it.  The only change I made was that I added about 1/2 tsp. of ground cinnamon to it.

These cookies are AMAZING!!!  They are not too sweet; just perfect.  I recently had to fly accross the country and I wanted to bring a snack to eat on the plane so I wouldn't get sick.  I made these cookies and they did the trick wonderfully.  I ended up sharing them with other people on the plane, and two different women asked for the recipe.  Next time I won't be so generouse, I ended up giving most of them away to strangers!!

Was so looking forward to these with fresh coconut, but they were a DISASTER.  They spread in a huge way on the baking sheet, and I found I had to let them sit for a bit before removing them from the sheet or else they turned in to a gooey, crumbly blob.  Tried chilling the dough to see if that would help, but it didn't.  Upped the baking time to 11 minutes and it was a tad better, but still very difficult to get them off the sheet. By the way, this makes about 5 to 6 dozen.  I used butter Crisco and Land O Lakes light butter.  Could the light butter have done this?  I would recommend not using it.  These cookies have a great flavor, but I'm traumatized enough that trying them again is out of the question.

I used all butter instead of shortening and I might have needed more flour because my cookies spread out really thin, but they are delicious! I think next time I would cut back on the sugar just a bit because with the sweetened coconut they are plenty sweet. Will make again.

These are very good! I subbed applesauce for shortening, cut the sugar by half, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Next time I will not make them so thick. I had to cook them way longer which made me anxious about them hardening inside, but other than that, a very good recipe!

I added white chocolate chips.  I used both butter and Crisco as recipe calls for.  I had to put in refrigerator for about an hour due to an emergency and when I baked them they came out great.  I was a little confused as recipe didn't specify to use a teaspoon or tablespoon; I used teaspoon because I thought tablespoon would not bake thoroughly and I was correct.

The recipe is perfect as is.  Even friends that don't like coconut (must be crazy) LOVE these cookies when they try them.  I did end up using butter rather than shortening with future bakes.

I followed other tips and used rounded teaspoons of baking powder and soda and then added chia seeds, flax and brewers yeast to make these lactation friendly. Will definitely make these again!

I have my own recipe of coconut oatmeal cookies that was passed down to me from my mother-in-law. She found it on a 5lb bag of C & H sugar about 30 yrs ago! Its everyone's favorite! Her recipe requires butter instead of shortening. I tried this one because I didn't have any butter in stock. It turned out great with the shortening.

These cookies were great!  Definitely going to bake them again.  I did cut back on the sugar and used only 1/2 cup of white sugar.  They were still very sweet, so I may cut back on the brown sugar next time.  Also, I used coconut oil instead of the shortening.

Sorry I tried to like this cookie but it was too bland for me. I added a pinch of salt, but something was missing. I added chocolate chips and that's why I gave it 3 stars.

Vey good!  DH likes them-that's all that matters!  I used half amounts of sugar and brown sugar and added 1/2 cup honey.  Added wheat germ and generous amount of ground flax.  Used half white and half wheat flour. Threw some raisins in to.

These were super delicious! So, as other reviews were concerned their cookies were flat, I too used heaping spoonfuls of baking soda and powder. I also used 1/2 cup ripe mashed bananas in place of the 1/2 cup of shortening and added 1-2 cups of raisins. I chilled the  dough for 1 hour then rolled dough into nickel size balls and slightly pressed them down on a silpat. Baked 350° for 9 minutes, turn cookie sheet after 5 minutes; remove after the remaining 4minutes to ensure soft cookies. "These are hubby and husky approved, lol!"

These were really tasty. I only had sweetened coconut flakes in the pantry which worked out just fine. Toast them first for a sweet coconut flavor.

Tried this recipe for the first time tonite, we love them! Here are the changes I made: I left out the shortening, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, in replace of the eggs I used 3/4 cup of my homemade chunky applesauce ( which also added a nice hint of cinnamon) for the coconut I added a half cup of the sweetened flaked,  and half a cup of unsweetened coconut to give it a tender crunch in the cookie. Even with the sugar changes I still found them a little sweet, this is definitely a keeper recipe. Half the batch I added some dried cranberries. Also I must add, this is the first oatmeal cookie I've made that didn't turn out flat! Thank you for a wonderful recipe :)

I just made this cookies,they came out really nice. Although they took more than 10 min in the oven,I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat,I'm not sure if that would have had something to do  with taking longer to bake but they're delicious,thanks for sharing the recipe!

The taste of these was very good. I think I would cut back a bit on the shortening next time, the cookies got at bit too flat for my taste, and I hope a little less shortening will keep them from that. 10 min. in the oven were just perfekt for my batch :)

These cookies were great!!!!  They are different and yummy.  They would be great with Macadamia Nut or white chocolate chips I think.  I will still make them without due to food allergies in the family.

These were very easy to make.  I added 1 t. Cinnamon, and 1/2 t. salt.  I baked them longer then suggested, but I made bigger cookies. I think they would have been fairly bland without the cinnamon, and salt additions.  Next time I'll toss in some butterscotch chips.

These were very good. Different taste from the usual oatmeal cookie. I enjoyed them.
