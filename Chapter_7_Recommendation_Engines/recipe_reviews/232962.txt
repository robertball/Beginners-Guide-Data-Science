my go to hummus recipe. I simply love hummus. I cannot find tahini anywhere in my area, no surprise, so I searched a substitute and went with tablespoon full of peanut butter. I love it with a peanut butter

Great recipe! Although, if you are a garlic lover don't be stingy! I added 3 cloves and it was just the right amount for flavor and not too over powering!

My hubby went nuts!  Made this in about 5 minutes with my Bullet. I doubled the olive oil AND THE LEMON and left out the sesame oil and only used about 2 tbsp of the garbanzo bean liquid.  Wonderful, fresh and YUMMY!!!!

Okay, I know this annoys people, but I made this with changes, upon which this review is based. I was watching a show about snacks for the big game, and I suddenly HAD to have hummus, and I had no garbanzo beans, so I wound up using black beans. I added only about half the oil, and I didn't have to add much bean liquid at all to get a good consistency. I added a little turmeric (just cause it's good for you), a little more cumin and garlic, and about 1-2 T chopped cilantro to go with the more Latin flavor. It's resting in the fridge now, but it was very tasty immediately after I made it. It doesn't look the most appealing, so I think if I were to serve it for guests, I'd garnish it with minced tomatoes and cilantro for color. I plan to use this as a dip, but I think this would also make a great vegetarian filling for quesadillas.

So Super Easy!and we made it tonight. He was looking at a different recipe and drained the liquid from the beans down the sink! Just a little was left in the can. Had to use a little water and used about 1/4 cup EVOO, which was fine by us as we love it. We also added a lot more garlic as that is our preference. We held back a few whole beans to put on top and drizzled on a bit more olive oil after putting in a container. Tastes great but putting in the fridge overnight to meld the flavors. We will definitely be making this again, maybe we'll try cooking the dry beans and make a double portion. Just wondering, can this be frozen?

So easy,and tasty.  I like mine with a smoother texture, so I take an extra step and peel the garbanzo beans.  Just place in a bowl of warm water, rub very gently between your hands.  Then run water over flowing to separate the skins.

Wow.  So easy to make and so delicious.  I love that I have control over what I put in it vs store bought.  Definitely better than store bought.  I drizzled in a little more than a couple of drops for the sesame oil and added in an extra clove of garlic (I like it garlicky).  I had to make myself stop eating it long enough to chill it.

This is a good hummus and appropriately named.  I garnished with a sprinkle of cumin, a drizzle of olive oil, and some chopped parsley.

After it's made, I put paprika on top with tiny bit of olive oil . That is how my Lebanese friend made it, and it adds a beautiful flavour to it.

Perfect!  As is, or a starting place to tinker w your own fresh options.  I added finely chopped broccoli stems, and parsley.  And as said above, best after refrigerated a while, but good to go even on the run. Def, keeper.

Great recipe to start off with and then adjust according to personal taste. Mine is:
less cumin, more olive oil, pepper, paprika powder, sambal, more salt, more lemon juice, more garlic

Adding part of the bean liquid is brilliant as it keeps the hummus light (so you can eat more, yummie).

I have only tried Hummus a couple of times before and liked it. My husband has had to go on a Healthy Heart diet so I have been looking for easy recipes for the both of us to try. I made this one without using sesame oil and it was great. I did add a bit of black pepper to it. We will be eating this one again.

I made a few changes ... I didn't have lemon juice and so used lime; I didn't have fresh garlic and so used 1/2 teaspoon of granulated garlic (and cut back on the salt to 1/4 teaspoon); I didn't use sesame oil, I used 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds instead.  I used about half of the reserved liquid.  I think it turned out really well -- quite yummy!  Would absolutely recommend ... ;o)

My container of garbanzo beans was a couple of oz short but I  used the measurements of all the spices the same. I did not put in sesame oil and used about half of my reserved liquid. I used an immersion blender her and it worked great . This is the first hummus that I've actually liked!

This is so good I almost ate it all with a spoon. Could. Not. Believe. How. Easy. And. Delicious. 

I’m a hummus snob and this reminded me of the super quality dips I get in Australia from their Turkish shop that makes everything from scratch. The sesame oil is an amazing touch IMO - I did extra of that and no lemon juice since I didn’t have any. Was still amazing. 20/10 will make again.

Folks. You do NOT want to reserve the water from the can. It will give u gas. Bad. Always rinse garabanzos and discard the water. Same with any beans or canned goods. Rinse and never use the water from the can!!!

This was a very quick recipe; easy to make with ingredients we normally keep on hand, and easy on the pocketbook, compared with the price of store-bought.   I did end up tracking down tahini paste, because this didn't quite satisfy my taste-testers.  Once that was added, it was a huge hit!  I don't believe I need to pay four dollars for a little plastic tub at the grocery store anymore!

Great basic hummus recipe, exactly what I was looking for.  I used it to make a cucumber appetizer with the hummus being the main star.  I did use the 2 drops of sesame oil and not quite half of the bean juice to get the consistency I was looking for.  Thanks Chelsey, for sharing your recipe.

Turned out fantastic. Way better than I thought. Didn't miss the Tahini one bit. Added some roasted red peppers and more olive oil. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Love this! This recipe is perfect for me, especially since you can alter it for your preference. I typically add some more lemon juice, because I just love lemon, but it's still a really solid base! Also, I don't own a food processor, but throwing it in the blender works fine too

I kept looking for a delicious hummus recipe and getting complex so so recipes in return. Finally decided to search for a simple, easy hummus recipe and found this. Yay!  Served it on homemade whole wheat chapati with oil free grilled orange bell pepper, red onion, and eggplant, topped with fresh organic grape tomatoes, and slices of avocado and my non vegan friends went nuts over it.  So good!

This was the best hummus I've ever made!  Used my food processor and added a tad more salt and a tad more sesame oil.  When it was finished, I put in a bowl, swirled it just a bit, and drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil and sprinkled a little cayenne pepper - it looked just like I get at a Mediterranean restaurant here!  I doubled the batch, used some for chicken wraps and the rest was gone in just a few days!  I will make it over and over again!

To get anyone afraid of hummus to try it, try this:
Cook up a lb of taco meat, add quartered grape tomatoes, and sliced almonds. Make sure there is a decent amount of grease, but not too much. 

In a dipping bowl, spread a healthy amount of hummus inside the bowl, like a bowl made out of hummus. Add the taco meat on top of the hummus, there may be extra.

Serve with Pita chips or quartered pita bread.

I really love that this recipe uses sesame oil rather than tahini as I always have sesame oil on hand.  I don't think I'll ever buy hummus again since this is so easy to make and it's way less expensive than buying it, plus tastes great!  I'm looking forward to trying a few flavor twists as well, but this is a great basic hummus recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

This is my go-to hummus recipe. If you're going to double it, maybe only add 5 cloves of garlic instead of six. Or not.

I reduced the cumin to 1/4 tsp. to start with and found that just right. We're garlicaholics so I tossed in and extra small clove.  Sesame oil is the perfect sub for tahini.  Around here you have to buy big jars of it and it goes to waste.  The oil is just the right flavor to replace it. I used a bit more than the two drops.

Absolutely delicious easy and quick hummus receipe. I added 2 garlic cloves instead of one bc i like it more garlicky. Add enough liquid from the can of garbanzo beans so that the hummus is not to thick and yet not too thin. Gage it. Do not skip sesame oil. It just  adds another dimension and brings this hummus to the next level! I also top the hummus at the finish with additional olive oil, toasted sesame, paprika, cayenne pepper, and chopped cilantro. Very pretty pesentation! My husband can’t get  enough of this!

The sesame oil is a great substitute for the tahini often called for. I used a lot of garlic and several drops of sesame oil. I thinned the mixture with olive oil as well as the leftover liquid from the beans.

The only change I made to the recipe was that I put 1/3 cup homemade tahini in it.  Also put a little extra garlic in.  Awesome taste, I will make this recipe again.

This is a good basic recipe, but is too thin for us as written.  Tahini paste if you have it really adds more complexity.  Chilling overnight definitely is the way to go if time allows.  If you like this as written, don't hesitate to add other flavors.  We love added roasted red pepper.  One thing that I've been doing for years is cooking (micro works) the garbanzo beans first.  It breaks down the bean and makes hummus much smoother.

This is good, but too much cumin and not enough lemon and garlic for my taste. Made a second batch with no cumin, more lemon juice and garlic. Mixed the two batches together and it was better. Good recipe and easy to adjust to taste.

After reading the other reviews, I left out the cumin. I added extra garlic and Tahini paste.  Tahini is very easy to make (I found a receipe) I should have used more of the liquid since it came out a little thicker then I wanted, but it tasted great. I also used organic canned  garbanzo beans. I drizzled olive oil on top and garnished it with chopped parsley and pine nuts.

I can't find Tahini. Using Sesame Oil is Awesome, fast, and I cannot tell the difference.  This is a good base for what ever your style of hummus is. I like Roasted Red Pepper. Most times? It's this Basic Hummus with Tortilla Chips or Basil Pita chips. So Good!

This is a great recipe and so easy. I did make two changes. We love garlic so I roasted a head and added it. Before serving I made a well and placed finely diced jalapeños (from my small food processor) in the center. (You add olive oil while processing). A sprinkle of paprika on top and small amount of olive oil. It adds a great flavor and went over very well.

Great base recipe!  I added roasted garlic and roasted red pepper and pan fried all the ingredients.  Then I used my pureed machine, adding the lemon and juice from the beans.  Love the one pan fixins!

I have spent a lot of time in Israel, where hummous is served with everything.  This recipe is simple and quick.  I'm not really into hummous, but my daughter had a school project that included making this and serving it with laffa bread.  I found that I liked this hummous way more than the Sabra ones.  I guess I like hummous after all!

Better than store bought. But I've been looking for a recipe that's as good as the middle eastern restaurants I've been to. I do recommend tripple the garlic. I may use this for a base to make a spicy hummus by adding serrano peppers.

This is a good basic recipe. That’s what I like. I only used 1/2 can of the reserved liquid. I will definitely be adding more garlic next time. It’s just a personal preference. Thanks for sharing.

Very simple and I had everything on hand. I added extra garlic because I enjoy garlic hummus. This could be made with many different flavors. I made it in the morning, so it could enjoy it for lunch.

Easy and Yummy.
The 1st time around I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfect.
The 2nd time I took some reviewers suggestion and added extra clove of garlic, because I like garlic.  But I preferred the exact recipe than the extra garlic one.

It's easier to get dried chickpeas in my country compared to tinned ones so I got a pack to make two chickpea recipes. So this is what I've learned with dried chickpeas:

- 15oz does not refer to the weight of the chickpeas. I thought I outsmarted the calculation by putting less than half of the weight in dried chickpeas so that by the time it soaked overnight, it would double. It almost did at over 12 oz. Again, this 15oz does NOT refer to the weight of the chickpeas in this recipe.
- Dried chickpeas have this skin which, when I used for another recipe, didn't look so nice. I peeled them off for this recipe to get a smoother blend.

I now have a large tubful of hummus in my fridge after using plenty more olive oil, water, lemon juice and everything else to get it to what I think it should be. 

I left out garlic because I don't want to be anti-social at the office as I plan to eat this for breakfast but I think it still tastes fine.

Simple and delicious. I added a few extra cloves of garlic to keep the vampires away. And instead of sesame oil, I tossed some raw sunflower seeds in and blended everything together. Divine!

Doubled the lemon juice and olive oil, could have gone even higher on the EVOO. Two cloves garlic, a few shakes of sesame oil and paprika. Rest as above. Made in in the Ninja bullet.

I always hesitated eating hummus.  It was always tasteless and depended on whatever was put on top to give it flavor.  I took a chance on this recipe because I love garlic and olive oil, and was desperate for a good source of protein that was not tofu.  This recipe is easy to whip up, and is the best hummus I've ever tasted.  BTW, this is the first time making my own hummus.   Followed the recipe exactly.

Simple, quick, and tasty! I normally add about 1 tsp of sesame oil and follow the rest perfectly to get a perfect hummus!
I will make this for any meal that feels like it needs something.

Super easy and super economical.
My cumin powder was old so I used tangy seasoned salt which was yummy.  I saw another reviewer threw in some red pepper.  I thought...hmmm...good idea.  I added in 1/2 a diced red pepper.  Very tasty.

Great easy recipe. I've never made hummus before and chose to start with dried chickpeas (cooked in slow cooker). I followed the recipe exactly with a few changes. I doubled the recipe because I was expecting guests and didn't want to run short. I used a total of 4 garlic cloves.  I also pureed in a whole avocado (minus pit & skins of course) then sprinkled in a little chipotle chili pepper . It turned out excellent and tasted exactly like the organic avocado hummus I have purchased at Costco. Everyone loved it. This will be my only hummus recipe, yum

I've got to give it a 5 star. I doubled the recipe because I had a 29 ounce can of Chick peas.  I like it though a  bit garlicky. I love garlic but I wanted to share with a friend and she's not as big a fan. Anyway, I think I should have added more of the residual liquid so it would have been creamier. Kudos on the sesame oil. Nice touch. I used my toasted oil instead of the Virgin one I have. Mmmmmmmm..... nice level of flavor.  Thank you for the recipe.

 P.S. thank you for excluding taihini. I  buy it, use it sparingly then have to eventially toss it.  So nice to not have to get it again.  Thanks.

I have made this 3x in the past month. 
We just love it. I use warmed pita bread cut up like pie sections and serve with sliced peppers, celery, cukes, carrots, tomatoes, kalamata olives and feta! It's a great meal on a hot summer eve!  Especially flavorful when you let sit in fridge for hours before serving !

This was good. I ended up using 2 tbsp of the reserved chick pea liquid. Also used 3 tbsp of olive oil to get the texture I prefer. After tasting I added another large garlic clove and a few turns of cracked black pepper. 
Served with vegetables and some avocado chips.

So quick and simple to make. I also used 3 cloves of garlic and doubled the amount of lemon. Next time I plan to add some sun-dried tomatoes. I didn't have any in my pantry this time. I plan to use this recipe often for quick, delicious hummus.

This recipe was great, although I did decide to make a few changes.  I accidentally put in too much liquid from the garbanzo beans, so I added another can of beans with no liquid.  I also added a bit of dried onion flakes, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.  I didn't have sesame oil, so I used tahini.  Really easy and immediately ready to eat!

Yummy! Thank-you. Can't wait to try the peanut butter someone suggested. Didn't have tahini, still delicious!

Awesome and so easy, but next time I will use less drained water and more olive oil or sesame oil. I also ended up doubling lemon and garlic and the flavors were great.

I used basil-flavored olive oil and topped with micro greens.  Left out the sesame.  Perfect proportions of ingredients.  Will definitely make again.

This is so delicious! I made tahini from scratch (on this website) and added 1 tbsp instead of olive oil. Also added Sriracha! Yummy!

As stated many times previously, this is really easy. The cumin gives it a nice flavor as does the sesame oil and you don't have to hunt down tahini.

I didn't know making hummus was so easy! This recipe can be tweaked to how you like it too---more lemon, more cumin, less salt,  more garlic.  I will never buy it at the store again!

Just made this bad boy! It was super easy to make and super yummy. After I followed the recipient I tasee tested it, super yummy, but I wanted to add my own flair, this recipe allows you to personalize it to your hearts desire. Just saying, a bit of parmesean, cilantro, and mustard is amazing in it!

Great job.  I had actually bought tahini and didn't realize the recipe was a way around using tahini.  Instead of sesame oil, I used about 1/3 cup of tahini.  
Also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  
Added some crushed red pepper and ground cayenne pepper for a small bit of heat.  Great base recipe to make a hummus you can do alot with! Thanks!

Quick and easy. My family loves  hummus so I quadrupled the recipe and added one roasted red bell pepper. I also left out the sesame oil just because I didn't have it. Next time I will add 2 peppers to add more of that flavor. YUM!!

This was just as easy as outlined but when it came to the flavor, forget the garlic as directed. It's just waaaay too much. And I love heavy garlic. I recommend you make it with very little garlic (or none) and add flavoring as needed. Chickpeas take on flavor from whatever is added as they're very neutral on their own. Go with smaller amounts and work your way up. Also, forget the blender. Doesn't work well at all unless you want it runny. Stick with the processor. It's perfect!

I really like this basic recipe! I did add more cumin due to personal preference. I also used 1 TBSP of Tahini, red bell pepper, and cayenne pepper. What an easy recipe for awesomeness!! The 1st batch I mad got eaten by my husband and Bichon (don't ask). The 2nd batch, I am eating!

Delicious and very easy.  I have needed to control the amount of garlic in my food as I've gotten older and I couldn't find a packaged hummus without garlic.  So I decided to make my own hummus without it.  This tasted great without garlic, and the addition of  the sesame oil was perfect for more flavor!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I feel like the garlic was a little overpowering. I love garlic, but not when it sits in your mouth for hours after you've eaten. Be sure to very slowly add the bean juice because a little goes a long way. This is definitely a keeper.

Tasted great but way too less oil.  End product looked like a dry bread dough. A little more oil and it looked smooth and moist. But flavor was there, enough lemon , spice, and salt to do it.

Super easy and much better than the store variety.  My son is extremely allergic to sesame/tahini so I never add it to any of my hummus recipes and no one misses it.  I like to add lemon olive oil and garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley and pine nuts. This will be my go to recipe when I'm not making edamame hummus.
