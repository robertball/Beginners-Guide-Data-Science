This was fantastic and may be my new favorite recipe for left over turkey (I deep fry 6 - 8 turkeys a year). I pretty much made it as written, except I cut all amounts in half. The servings recommendation seems off as I made half a recipe and there was more than enough for four, maybe even six, servings.

I found the spices to be heavy. If I make it again, I would use far less chili powder. Loved the cumin flavor.

This is an awesome, cold snowy day dish!  I decreased the chili powder by half and my husband wishes I put even less in.  I loved it!

Everyone loved this recipe! I did decrease the chili  powder and cumin each by 1T as I was worried it would be too spicy, it was fantastic! I would definitely make this again. I would have submitted a photo but we ate it so fast that I forgot!!
