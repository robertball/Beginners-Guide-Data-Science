Just really hard to beat a tasty glass of freshly-squeezed lemonade (any time of the year) with only 5 calories.  This is so easy that it makes no sense to me to use frozen lemonade concentrate which is loaded with sugar.  One lemon gives you 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice which yields two servings.  I always put my lemons in the microwave and heat on high for 20 seconds which maximizes the juice.  I used only 1 Tbsp of Truvia, and it was plenty sweet for us.  I recently starting cooking with Truvia, and I really like the fact that you get no aftertaste as you do with some other artificial sweeteners.

This was a good recipe to use trying stevia instead of sugar, but it was not lemony or sweet enough, although we drank the whole pitcher. (I did not have any Truvia because I found it not to be sweet enough when using it previously, so I substituted Stevia in the Raw.) When making a second pitcher, I took the zest off one lemon and added it to some stevia to enhance the flavor. Then I used a full cup of the lemon-infused stevia, dissolving it in a cup of warm water before adding the lemon juice and cold water. First taste is more to our liking.

I thought this was good. It took 2 lemons for me.  I like the idea of 10 calories total:)

I tried this with limes since we had way too many! I halved the truvia and kept everything the same. It was tart but delicious. I think the water/lime ratio was perfect! And then just adjust the sweetener to your preference. I'm sure most people would prefer more but I don't eat a lot of sweets lately.

I made a large pitcher so I simply multiplied the recipe by 4.
