I love that it calls for honey instead of sugar, along with the garlic & rosemary! Made this to drizzle over caprese avocado halves for our yearly, primitive, camping trip, OMG what a treat! This takes it up a notch!

Made this and yes its delish, but I should have cooked on little higher heat to thicken it up a little more. Also should state in here that it will thicken more once it's cooled.  Also  buy cheap balsamic, no need for an expensive one here once it reduces it will be just as good as a high priced balsamic is

This was my first time making a balsamic glaze.  I used 1 C cherry balsamic and 1 C regular balsamic (I was afraid that the Cherry would be too intense).  I also used 2Tbs. honey.  I followed the cooking instructions, but the glaze didn't reduce by half; which is ok by me, because it is so yummy.  More glaze for me!!  I used it on a spinach salad with pecans and gorgonzola.
I want to try it with other flavored balsamics.

I added way more honey to cut down on the vinegar taste.

This didn't turn out for me at all. Twice. The first batch was intended to go with a pork tenderloin. The sauce never thickened and the garlic burned. I read on another review that they used this to drizzle over a salad. Attempt #2 I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic to prevent the burning. After 40 minutes the sauce still hadn't thickened. At the 50 minute mark it was barely starting to thicken and then at the 53 minute mark it had the consistency of tar. Sorry but I will not be trying this again.
