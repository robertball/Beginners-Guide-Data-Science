I followed other suggestions and added old bay seasoning and regular shrimp and I love cilantro so I was very disappointed with the results, we all tried it but ended up throwing it out....

Great dip!  I love the flavor of the cilantro.   I accidentally confused this recipe with another and added a packet of italian dressing mix.  It sounds funny- I thought it sounded funny, but I did it anyway.  Surprisingly they go quite well together and I think I'll keep making it like this.  I've made four shrimp dips today and this (with modification) is the best by far!

This was so-so.  My guests and I really didn't care for it that much - not that flavorful or interesting.  I used 12oz thawed frozen shrimp.  I didn't puree it, but chopped the shrimp & cilantro finely.  Maybe pureeing it makes it better.

It's good- nothing extremely spectacular- I love cilantro but didn't find that it made a major impression here- I added old bay and that added some flavor- an easy quick dip but nothing super exciting or different

I'd suggest more cream cheese - it was a little looser than what I had anticipated. Even with that, it was a huge hit - incredibly tasty!

Amazing!  I made and brought this to a friend's house and everyone loved it.  I used frozen shrimp without tails and boiled it first, then put in a mini chopper.  I did the same with all the ingredients.  I cannot remember now if I added some onion, but I'm thinking I did.  I also think I added more cilantro and garlic then was called for, because I really like those flavors.  I will definitely be making this again!  This went great with whole wheat crackers, and also on Garlic Bread!  YUM!
