I thought this was great. We have been eating steak salads for a long time and the dressing is the only thing so far that actually tastes good with all the other flavors. I did make some changes to it though. First I omitted the walnuts and mushrooms, my wife will not eat them, I also added onion, we love onion, and then to the dressing I added, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, 2 large cloves of garlic and best of all about a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper, it made the dressing like a light chimchurri it was delicious. Enjoy

WOW, Rebecca! Great salad for a hot summer night, or any other night for that matter. My family loved this! I grilled the steak and cut into 1/2"X1" strips. This made for a pretty presentation. I used approx 1 cup of red leaf lettuce for more color, and toasted the walnuts for a more flavor. The dressing was amazing and added extra culinary excitement with the smokey, piquant flavor.I served homemade guacamole on the side, which my family said really enhanced the great flavors of this salad.Thanks for sharing.This is our new favorite summertime meal.

Fabulous salad, it was a delicious and filling main course meal!  I added some chopped purple onion to the salad, and I substituted extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil.

Nice quick meal.  My husband & I both thought the dressing had to much of a vinegar taste, so will cut back on the red wine vinegar a touch.

I guess I have different taste from most people. The salad ingredients are really great. I just recommend having a back-up bottle of dressing, just in case your family doesn't care for the one here. We really scrimped on a small bottle of blue cheese to make it go around. I like all of the ingredients in the dressing; it's just not something we could eat mixed together. Try dipping some lettuce in the mixture, first, before risking the whole salad. I'm sure I must have a little pickiness, though. It was something different to try.

This was very easy to make, but it wasn't anything special. Eveyone in the family had the same feeling. The dressing was flavorful, but again nothing to rave over.  Just ok, and I probably wouldn't make it again.

So yummy, easy, and filling!  I used a leftover NY strip from the night before.  I didn't measure anything, just sprinkled it on to my liking.  I made the dressing in a bottle and plan to use more of it tonight on a salad with chicken.  I really liked the dressing, just don't douse it on.  I love the way this recipe looks and if you have leftover steak, it can be made in less than five minutes.  I will definitely have this again.

Used leftover grilled ribeye for the meat. Loved all the ingredients -- colors were pretty. Used regular bagged spring mix. I don't like liquid smoke so I didn't make the dressing -- topped with a champagne dressing. Tasted fine.

This salad is excellent. I added guacamole on top and increased the broil time a little for the steak, but besides that didn't change a thing. I will definately make again.

Great summer salad...I didn't add the liquid smoke to the dressing but I did add 1 clove garlic minced and 1/4 tspn red pepper flakes as per others suggestions.  I grilled the steak after marinating it in equal parts olive oil and balsamic vinegar, dried marjoram, oregano, slivered garlic and s/p.  I added extra veggies I had to use up in addition to the ones listed. I will definately make again Rebecca.  :)

We grilled sirlion tips after marinating them for an hour in the dressing and the combo was incredible. I prepped the salad and popped it in the fridge as the meat soaked so it was nice and colld when the beed was cooked. The textures, the flavors, combined with the temperature made it so yummy. Serve with fresh unsalted tortilla chips for even more dimension. This is a favorite now!

We love this steak salad. We don't use the dressing in the recipe, instead we use a  balsamic vinaigrette adding some blue cheese dressing to it (to taste) mixed together, very good.

My husband and I liked this.  I will make it for our big Easter gathering.  I did not use the liquid smoke or tomatoes.  This salad is nice for diabetics and low-carb dieters as there is no sugar in the dressing and no dried fruit in the salad.

Made this for 2 guests and they loved it!  I marinated the meat in the dressing mixture (minus the oil) before broiling.  Also added avacado, zucchini and boiled egg.  I will make this again.

I loved this! It was simple and delicious. I served mine in warm pita bread. The blue cheese and walnut combine with the beef to give this an incredibly decadent flavor. I've made this also with grilled shrimp and it was divine!Thanks for a great recipe!

This was one of the best salads I've ever made and it was very simple.  The one thing I did differently though was that I sauteed the mushrooms a bit.

I DID NOT make this with all of the ingredients because I never have them on hand - the walnuts mushrooms or crumbled blue cheese - so I left those out and added some diced green pepper and sliced green onion. I used blue cheese salad dressing to make up for no crumbled blue cheese. I made the dressing replacing some leftover steak sauce (from this site) in place of the liquid smoke. Great way to use up leftover steak.

Great and very filling, even for my husband.  I did make a few changes.  I added a can of mandarin oranges and then toasted the walnuts with a 1/2 package ramen noodles in butter for the top.

I am sure the recipe must really be pretty good, but the idea of watching 4 people, ("I just made this for lunch for some friends and it was fantastic-the plate was licked clean.") sitting at the table licking their plates. . .!!  Eeew!

We enjoyed this salad and thought the dressing was fabulous! Vinaigrette with a smoky touch - perfect. My husband didn't like the steak "cold", but the rest of us thought it was very good. I used feta for those who don't appreciate blue cheese.

I made this salad on several occasions and it is divine. I followed the vinaigrette recipe to the letter but mixed the salad with whatever I had on hand for vegetables. I grilled the steak with La Grille  Montreal steak spice from Club House, great combination. The liquid smoke makes this dish. thanks for the recipe.

EXCELLENT! Unfortunately Publix dissapointed me in there meat choice. tenderness of this meat is vital! Easy to make, slice meat thin. dont cut yourself short on flavor use exact tomatoes, lettuce, meat, cheese, etc.each one of these particular  items, have a small minute unique flavor....worth it!

Tasty salad but I found I could only taste the vinegar in the dressing.  And I *love* vinegar.  I did leave the mixture overnight as dinner got pushed off that night, so I don't know if that allowed the vinegar to steal the show?

The steak could have used some marinating as well as others here have done.  My own mistakes included using dry feta in a bag--I hadn't tried it before and it does not have HALF the flavor of real wet feta in brine.

This is a keeper.  The salty taste of the blue cheese contrasted by the vinegary taste of the dressing and the crunchiness of the walnuts makes this recipe a keeper.

YUMM!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty. My girlfriend loved it. I found the steak too chewy but that is my fault as I over-broiled it because she doesn't like it undercooked.

This is a great recipe to serve to guests on a nice summer night.  I usually double the dressing to make sure we have enough.

We loved this recipe.  I changed it by adding some yellow peppers and red onions.  I also used a bagged spring mix for the greens.  Super easy.  I left out the smoke flavoring - I don't like it.  The blue cheese and walnuts worked well wih the steak.

Great dinner salad. I personally like it with a little goat cheese instead. Also, adding the crushed red pepper, garlic and parsley like the other reviewers suggest is a great idea. Great dressing for a quick and easy meal!

Yum!  Healthy and filling too! We used flank steak instead (cheaper!?!?), and had hard boiled eggs as well...my husband felt it was one of the only filling salads he's had!

Delicious. I used a cheap cut of steak so I cannot imagine just how much better it would be with a great cut of steak. Ended up using pecans instead of walnuts and the nuts really add to this. I did leave out the liquid smoke and I don't think I would have missed it since I marinaded my steak with a smoky marinade. I sauteed the mushrooms as they were going bad and I think I would like it better than raw mushrooms. I have leftors since I just made it  myself. I will also try the dressing on it's own, very tasty and simple.

This is a very good recipe.  I did change the dressing somewhat to cool down the vinegar.  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and lime juice instead of lemon as I realized too late I was out of lemon!  I also added another teaspoon of worcestershire, increased the liquid smoke to 1/4 teaspoon, added 1T of honey and 1T of Splenda.  Lastly I added about 3/4 shakes of sesame oil.  We will definitely be making this again.

I'd like to know where you came up with this recipe Rebecca because it was deliciously different! Lots of different taste sensations going on here which complimented one another beautifully. I wouldn't cook a steak specifically for this dish, but leftovers work wonderfully. Hubby had the steak and I used chicken for my salad. Thank you for your wonderful post!

This is delicious, easy and relatively quick.  A wonderful main dish salad.  We served it with warm steak which provided a wonderful mix of warm and cool. We also substituted garlic and herb feta cheese for the blue cheese since one of our daughters doesn't like blue cheese.

Hmmm...Mixed reviews here.  I really liked my salad, minus the meat with added guacamole.  My husband did not care for the dressing, which I unfortunately marinated the steak in as well.  Loved the salad portion of it all though and look forward to trying another dressing with it.

This is a great salad. The dressing is the best. Absolutely makes the salad! I used Gorgonzola cheese instead of the blue cheese. I would make the dressing and keep for other salad recipes!

this is an incredible salad. Very pretty layered in a glass bowl. Great for Easter dinner.
