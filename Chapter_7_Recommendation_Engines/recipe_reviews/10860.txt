I was wondering why no-one had posted a picture of this, and now I know why.  It isn't the most attractive recipe.  I think it would look better baked in a pan and cut into bars.  Very tasty though.  Mine were finished before I remembered that I had wanted to post a picture!

My Husband and I both enjoyed these cookies and so did the men in his office. Many wanted the recipe for their own use. I did add a couple of things when I made them a little vanilla extract and a touch of salt, and a little more sugar. I did try icing a few with a cream cheese, brown sugar icing and that was wonderful too. They bake up very soft and yummy! Wonderful!

This recipe was exactly what I wanted! A soft, slightly moist cookie with a good banana flavor that wasn't too overpowering. I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and an extra 1/2 cup of oats, and they turned out fantastic! Plus, to cut down on clean up, I used the old trick of baking on parchment paper. For busy moms, this is almost a must. Thanks, Shawn, for a simple, yummy recipe.

I am also attending university and was looking for a snack to munch on while studying. This met all my expectations.  I followed the advice of another review and added some vanilla extract and a little more flour. I also omitted about 1/4 cup of butter. I didn't have enough walnuts or any raisins but I didn't feel they detracted from the overall taste.  Cooking them a little longer (10-15 minutes) would make a more cookie like texture but I enjoyed the soft dough-like texture more. I actually enjoyed these so much I began to eat them as a quick breakfast and for dessert.

Wow! These are surprisingly tasty! I was pretty skeptical of this recipe, but since I had some bananas that needed used up, I thought I'd make these for my marathon-running husband to snack on after his training runs. However, now that I've tried one, I just hope he gets home quickly or there won't be any left for him! These are really, *really* good!!! I think this just became my new go-to recipe for using up bananas.

My changes: I upped the flour to 3 cups and substituted wheat flour for half of that, I changed the sugar ratio to 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (in hopes that the brown sugar would help "disguise" the wheat flour since I don't usually like the taste of wheat). Next time, I might try using all wheat flour and just 1 cup of brown sugar - no white sugar at all. I also added 1 ts of vanilla and 1 ts of sea salt. I don't like raisins very much, so I split the dough and added about 1-1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to half. I ended up adding about 3/4-1 cup of chocolate chips to the raisin half too because I ran out of raisins.

Very good.  Omitted the nuts, and the nice soft texture was perfect for kids with braces.  I added almost 1/2 cup more flour to get a good "cookie" texture.  Every one loved them, even a picky eater who refuses to eat anything with oatmeal.

I took another reviewers suggestion and spread the mixture in a baking dish to make bars.  I didn't have nuts or raisins so I added half a bag of frozen raspberries.  My kids like them a lot and I like the recipe better than standard banana bread.

The banana flavor in these is terrific.. the texture is quite soft. if you think if this as little banana bread bites rather than a cookie you'll get it..next time will add a pinch of salt and some vanilla extract

I used 1/2 C. white and 1/2 C. brown sugar, threw in an additional 1/2 C. semisweet chocolate chips, cooked for 30 minutes in the 9x13 and voila! Banana bread. Because that's what this is.

Very good cookie.  I used four small, very ripe bananas, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of white flour.  And in half of the cookies, I added a generous handful of mini chocolate chips.  Thanks for the recipe!

They turned out to have more of a cake texture than a cookie but the taste was nice. They needed to cook 12 - 15 minutes to cook properly.

I love this versatile recipe. No raisins and no walnuts; replaced with semi sweet chocolate chips. Replaced rolled oats with steel cut oats - gives a nice bite. Added ground flax seed too. Extra cinnamon. I am an anything goes cook. No stress just lots of options to try.

Needs a bit more brown sugar and another banana for moisture but pretty good.

I cut back the sugar as on all cookies I make.  I really didn't cut back much, but these could have used ALL the sugar.  They were very dense and filing as a study snack should be. (Good Name)

This was a great recipe.  I ran out of oatmeal and had a total post-it note moment( wasn't my initial intention, but it turned out great). I found some little single sere oatmeal packets that had apples and cranberries in it.  A slightly expensive but convenient for the time fix that worked great with the banana.       My only complaint was the texture. It was quite bready. (This could just be my oven being a jerk) But when I tried to make it in a bread pan, it started burning on the bottom and was still extremely doughy(not in a good way) in the majority of the middle.

This is a very simple recipe.  I did, however, decrease the flour to 2 cups and increased the oats to 2 cups. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I made them into bars instead of cookies.  I know I will enjoy them with coffee in the morning.  Thank you Shawn Doctor for a versatile recipe.

Tasty and not too sweet.  A nice alternative to use up bananas instead of bread.  I imagine you could substitute raisins and nuts with choc chips but I baked recipe as is and was delish!

Thank you for sharing!  I have been looking for a high-energy snack, and most of them taste disgusting...  Your recipe is delicious!  Our favorite!  I spread it out on a jelly-roll pan & cut bars with a pizza cutter. It took longer to bake, but worked well too.

The cookies were okay...they seem to have a personality disorder though...they can't decide if they want to be a cookie or a bread.  The consistency and texture are not quite that of a normal cookie...Interesting flavor though...i did leave out the nuts and added mini chocolate chips to mine...but BF liked them better with just raisins.

Wow, what a quick, tasty cookie recipe! I added slivered almonds since I didn't have any walnuts, and upped the raisins to a full cup. These cookies taste like slices of banana bread! Really good. Will make again!
