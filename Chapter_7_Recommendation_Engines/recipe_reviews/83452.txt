You always know when you find a recipe by Marzetti, it's going to be a keeper!  For a little bit of crunch, I added pignoila (pine nuts).  This recipe is a good starter base for a Summer Sandwich Wrap!

This is a tasty and very easy recipe. I used the pre-shredded/cut cabbage with carrots already in it that comes in the bag; all I had to do was chop some peppers and onions. I liked munching on this with blue tortilla chips. Thanks.

We loved it! Used homemade dressing (my variation of the recipe from Hellmann's mayonnaise) as I find prepared cole slaw dressings much too sweet. Added Bulls Eye brand bbq sauce and chipotle powder instead of Tabasco since I thought that touch of smokiness would enhance the mixture. I soaked the thinly sliced onion (used an adjustable Kyocera ceramic mandoline for all the veggies, varying the thickness) in cold water while I prepped the other veggies, then drained them well before incorporating into the mixture, this reduces the sulfur compounds that bother my tummy. Definitely a keeper!

I prepared the veggies and then stored it, as this recipe makes a lot.  I then mixed equal parts of barbeque sauce and coleslaw dressing and dressed only the amount of salad that I needed.  Absolutely delicious!!!

This was very good.  I used homemade slaw dressing (cheaper than buying) and I didn't have any tabasco sauce.  It was just fine without it.  The next day, I tried it with some left-over grilled chicken in a tortilla wrap.  YUMMY!!

I recently served this at a large family gathering (I doubled the recipe) and it was raved about.  I served 10 different dishes and this is the one that several people asked the recipe for.  Only thing I did differently was used 2 bags of coleslaw mix in place of the cabbages and carrots.  I will make it again, because it has already been requested for summer barbecues!!

Everyone in my family loved this twist on coleslaw, 8 yr old and teen boys, too! I didn't use onions, used bagged coleslaw greens with carrots and added very thinly sliced red peppers.  I only wish there were a low-fat or lite Marzetti's (or other) type slaw dressing available.  I went very light with it, though.  Excellent!!

this was fab!  My boyfriend who doesn't even like coleslaw enjoyed this.  Made for a BBQ party, everyone liked it, I added poppy seeds to it.

I made this today, and I am pleasantly surprised with the results. I can see myself making this tasty dish again.
