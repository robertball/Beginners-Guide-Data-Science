For a fun presentation, consider serving this sundae in a "tortilla bowl".  [Make bowls by floating a 6" corn tortilla in deep hot oil.  Press down in the center with a ladle.  Hold until bowl is formed and becomes crisp.  Sprinkle with the sugar & cinnamon mixture.]

I added this with the mexican themed couple's wedding shower. The salsa was wonderful. It was very easy to make and gets better the longer it chills. It also looks great! My mom said this was the best fruit salsa she ever had!

This wasn't a hit with the kids, although they did like the cinnamon-sugar tortillas.  The minted mango salsa was not their thing. Just to pass on...  We tried with both flour and corn tortillas.  Stick to the corn tortillas as the recipe directs.  They were better than the flour.

Some of the nine year olds in my class made this recipe and it was a hit with the all the kids.  We used the suggestion to fry the tortillas in a deep fryer while holding them down with a ladle.  It created a nice sundae bowl.  The kids didn't peel the mango so that was a little weird but user error not the recipe.  Yummy!!

This recipe is an absolute new favourite!  The flavours are unique with the mint and ginger but it's the entire combination that just works. I did not deep fry the tortillas...I brushed them with oil, sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar, and baked them at 400 for about 12 minutes. Less mess, less fuss, less fat.  I served it with Del Monte Peach Frozen Yogurt with Pineapple.  All I can say is WOW!  I will be making this at my Tupperware parties all summer long!

Refreshing and light just in time for summer.  I wasn't sure about the texture of the salsa at first- its kind of slimy?  But,  the taste is great,  and I loved the idea of the tortilla strips. We used the leftover strips with chocolate ice cream for a nice taste.
