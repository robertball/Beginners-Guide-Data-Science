My family and I loved this recipe.  I used skinless chicken breast and the chicken came out so moist.  The smell of it cooking was a temptation for the taste to come.  It was a very easy recipe.  ******

this was awesome!!! I mixed the butter together with the herbs - added lemon pepper and thyme - and then put a good sized dollop of the herbed butter on each breast. Also, a note on the cooking time - if you raise the temp to 375 and cover the dish with foil, it lowers the cooking time to 30-35 minutes and the chicken comes out cooked through but SOOOO juicy and tender!! thanks!!

Wonderful recipe. Everything was excellent and very easy to make. I followed some of the recommendations and mixed the butter and seasonings together prior to baking. I also added some lemon juice in the bottom of the pan. I think the lemon juice added the finishing touch!! Husband loved it and says it's a definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy!  I melted the butter and mixed the spices in with it and then brushed that over skinless chicken breasts.  I was worried it would be too much basil but it was actually perfect!  Mine was done in about 55 minutes.

I am a cooking idiot. I chose this as the first recipe to make for my girlfriend (ever) as a surprise. She walked into the house after work and said "...IT SMELLS _AWESOME_ IN HERE!" The chicken turned out great, I scored many points. Thank you.

My hubby absolutely LOVES just your normal roasted chicken pieces. He could eat it once a week. Never used butter with this dish before, but it was certainly a treat Nora! I did, as others, add a lot more seasonings which made the chicken even better. Of course you can use whatever herbs or spices you like. I found this recipe from "Taylor's" reviews and I must say that it was so nice to read reviews from someone who is obviously a very sweet and caring person. As I was reading I felt the same as when a stranger passes you on the street and smiles at you for no reason! Taylor, you made my day! (almost named my daughter Taylor, but only a month before, decided on Tyler. Thanks so much Nora!

Just made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great!!!  I can't understand why some people said it was dry, they must have over-cooked it because it was extremely tender & juicy. All it needed was a little kosher salt and pepper before you put it in the oven. Will definitely make this again!

made this tonight for the second time and i used chicken thighs both times because it happened that they were on sale really cheap. i removed the skin on half of them (made ten), was worried that they would be over done and tough, but they tasted great.  this was a pretty high fat dinner, made the three cheese garlic scalloped potatoes from this site both times, but cut the cream by half and used fat free half and half.  this is a nice combo.  lightened it up with steamed broccoli and a veggie loaded salad.  this is a really easy, good chicken recipe.  thanks for sharing.

I softened my butter and mixed the spices in it and spread under and over the skin.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  An instant read thermometer would help those who had problems with dry chicken.  I checked mine at 45 minutes and it read 138.  In six minutes it read 160.  Remember to let it rest a few minutes before cutting.  This is not an exciting dish, but basic and tasty.

For everyone who says this is too dry, its probably because you use boneless skinless chicken breast.  The recipe calls for whole breast which is why the temp and time are higher than would be for boneless skinless.  If you are using boneless skinless decrease the time to 25-35 min PLEASE, and stop rating dry when you didnt use the correct recipe.

Delicious and moist - one of the few times I've cooked chicken breasts and they didn't come out dry.  As 1 reviewer suggested, I added some lemon juice to the bottom of the pan before cooking and also found my four good sized chicken breasts were done in about 40 to 45 minutes.  The two left were just as good heated up (covered) the next night in the microwave.

Boneless skinless ck is great for this, I cooked only two (ck breasts) last night with the following changes. My boyfriend and I both loved it.  1)I cooked @ 375-400 for 30mins (my oven runs hot, but was set @ 375).  2)Cooked in 1/2 can ck broth and couple tbsp lemon juice, with sliced onions added over top (in addition to the basil & garlic salt).  3)Used other half can of broth to add flavor to Whole Grain Minute Rice, cooked on stove top. *** I think the highlight was how the added onions turned out, picked up the garlic & lemon flavor and were great w/ the ck, add my intention was just to add flavor to the chicken! Yumm!

To be honest, the chicken came out REALLY dry. I don't think I'll be making this dish anytime soon. Sorry.

This was delicious. Like one or two reviewers before me, I added a little thyme to the mix, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. Thank you for sharing!

SIMPLY amazing--chicken came out perfect. Definitely use bone-in chicken. I prefer bone-in with skin--it keeps the chicken's juices in the chicken so it comes out perfectly tender and moist. make sure not to pierce the skin while cooking, juices will run out.

I made this with boneless chicken breasts smothered in herbed butter (softened butter mixed with dried basil and thyme). One hour in 350 oven, covered in foil. Amazingly moist and full of flavor. Have to try it to believe it. Superb.

I put way too much basil and garlic salt on because...I don't know, I had a brain fart.  But it was still absolutely excellent.

I used skinless chicken breast, next time I may brown the chicken first, I was out of basil and used what I had on hand, plus fresh garlic, I squeezed fresh lemon juice on the chicken before I seasoned it . Very good

So tender and flavorful!  First melted the butter in the microwave and and mixed in some Montery Chicken seasoning by McCiormick (instead of the basil/salt). Poured all over and brushed over chicken leg quarters.  Cooked in the oven on convection roast at 350 for about 45 minutes.

Followed advice below to add lemon juice, white wine, and mix herbs with softened butter.  I don't think it would have turned out as well if I had followed the recipe exactly.

This was delicious! I softened the butter then mixed all the herbs in and placed it on the chicken. I also lightly buttered the baking dish and poured white wine on the bottom. I repeatedly basted the chicken. The best part about this was the "sauce" that came from the herbs and white wine in the bottom of the pan. I couldn't get enough

Simple and delicious. Just like mom made. I finally found a bone-in Chicken recepie that is user friendly and tasty without going over the top.

This recipe IS simple however, it doesn't taste like it is.  I was a little nervous about the butter to spice ratio but I shouldn't have been. Love this recipe!  It will become a "usual" in our house.  Thank you so much for sharing :)

This was a great start but I do it a bit differently. I mix the basil and garlic salt and whatever else parsley, a garlic clove in a large zip lock bag with a table spoon of oil and put the chicken in the bag while I prep the rest of dinner like an hour , in the fridge. I then soften the butter. Remove the chicken from the bag and pour the left over spices from the bag into the butter then smear the chicken with that. It is a few extra steps but it turned out yummy!

This recipe is just what it says "super simple". We liked it, but mine was a tad bit dry. Next time I'll start checking at 45-50 minutes. I should have made gravy out of the drippings, they looked yummy. I'm not a huge dried basil fan, and hubbie can't have salt so I liberally sprinkled with my homemade all purpose seasoning. Thanks for the recipe!

Super simple and super tasty. We enjoyed this. It is very simple and I like that sometimes. Just a few simple seasonings, but great taste. I added salt and pepper and used garlic powder. My chicken was HUGE so I think I cooked it almost a total two hours.

The only thing I changed was what one reviewer suggested-- I melt the butter with the basil and garlic salt and brush it over boneless chicken breasts, reducing baking time to about 40 minutes. This is a huge hit in my house, with everybody. I love that it's so quick to prepare and the house smells delicious while it's baking. My new "go to" when my brain is too tired to think. Put the brown rice on the stove before you start the chicken, add a vegetable and you're done. Nice.

Made as written, this isn't the most flavorful chicken ever, but it's great if you're looking for something a little healthier. And it really doesn't get much easier. Thanks!

This was a great dish! I had 4 very large bone-in chicken breast so I used a whole stick of butter and doubled the spices. I mixed the spices with room temperature butter and added 2 teaspoons of lemon pepper seasoning and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. I then rubbed the breast all over and under the skin with the butter mixture. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking.

I normally prefer boneless, skinless chicken breasts - but this was DELICIOUS!!! So moist and flavorful. I actually just used salt, pepper, and butter, but it would obviously work great with garlic or any other herb.

Pretty darn good! I used this recipe today to prepare the chicken that will go into some chicken pot pies that I'm making. I too added a little lemon juice to the pan. I also softened the butter and mixed the spices in before spreading on the chicken. It turned out delicious and I know that it's going to add some GREAT flavor to my chicken pot pies.

My husband thought this was "awesome."  I added lemon juice to the bottom of the pan and mixed the butter with the basil, garlic powder and salt (I didn't have garlic salt).  I used skinless chicken cutlets and cooked them for 25 min and they came out delicious. Thanks for a new recipe to add to our rotation.

This was so delicious and moist!  We accidentally used whole chicken breasts, rather than halves (we didn't notice 'til it was already in the oven)....so we cooked it a little longer & it still turned out great!  Cooking does not come natural to us; we are very inexperienced!  This is also one of the first meals we have ever cooked, & we are so proud to have made something yummy!  Our very picky toddler even gobbled hers up!

I thought this was pretty good! It wasn't dry at all, but I only cooked it for about 55 minutes. I always check  chicken BEFORE the recipe says it's done, because everybody's ovens are different.

This smells great while cooking.  I loved the sauce/pan drippings with italian bread.  The chicken, however, was only pretty good.  I'll have to use the topping ingredients for rice or pasta.

I added parsley, pepper and lots of paprika.  When I tasted it I thought it needed more little salt, but I did use unsalted butter.  I used half chicken breasts and they did not have many bones in them so I took them out after baking uncovered for about 45 minutes.

I melted the butter, mixed in the spices and  added a splash of lemon juice.  I used thinner chicken so it only took about 30 minutes.

Simple!  I like it.  I was very generous with the garlic salt.  I used fresh basil chopped instead and (LOL) I didn't have lemon juice or a lemon, but an orange instead so I squeezed the juice out of the orange.  Turned out better than I thought!  And of course, pepper to top it off.

This was an awesome starter recipe. I had all these bone-in breasts that were on sale, and no clue what to do with them! I didn't have lemon, so I splashed a bit of white wine on the bottom, and since I had provencal seasoning already made up I just used that. Smelled awesome as it was cooking! Using the leftovers for broth today...can't wait!

Reviewers are right, this smells wonderful while baking. I didn't have any lemon but that sounded like a nice addition so I did add some lemon pepper along with the garlic salt. I also added a little extra butter and spooned it back over the chicken when it was finished. As long as you know how to improvise and add spices, this is a good starter recipe.

Excellent flavor! Used Basil, thyme and rosemary, garlic, s&p - don't forget to season with salt & pepper. Rubbed butter mixture under skin, then melted remaining and poured it over the top. My 3 yr old non-meat eater gobbled this up! Made for 25 people and they loved it. So easy. Baked for 50 minutes and the meat was perfectly cooked. Forgot the lemon juice that others recommended but will try next time.

I melted the butter and added two cubes of garlic and two cubes of basil (available in your grocer's veg/freezer section :)) and boneless chicken breast. The aroma was VERY overpowering, so I wasn't expecting much from the meal, but it was the best chicken I've had in ages! VERY simple, and soooo delicious.   The recommendation for Pino Grigio is an excellent one -- by chance, we had that to accompany us, and they were perfect complements.   That, with a bit of broccoli and balsamic rice, and we had the perfect meal.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  I used boneless chicken breasts, on olive oil and lemon juice, baked 40 minutes and broiled a bit at the end to brown the meat a bit.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

nervous about the 'dry' thing, I attempted to combat this by using a smaller dish to roast in (just barely big enough for the 2 breasts I made), covered with tin foil except for the last 10 minutes and baked on 325 for 20 min, then 350 for 20 min, then uncovered at 400 for 10 min.

I liked this dish without any sauce at all but not everyone in my family liked it. I melted the butter and stirred the spices into it then brushed the mixture onto the chicken. Next, I sprinkled the breasts with Montreal Chicken Seasoning by McCormick (didn't measure). The basil was a little strong probably b/c I had rather small pieces of chicken, but they had TONS of flavor and were super moist; I liked it a lot but not everyone did, like I said... So, 3*. Thanks for posting this very easy and versatile recipe; I'm going to try it with different spices and seasonings until I find some everyone WILL like lol:)

Eh, this was OK...it was a little dry. I did use chicken breasts. Thought it might be better if I made holes in the chicken for the butter to seep in.

I ended up in a pinch for dinner tonight and all I had was frozen skinless chicken breasts.  I looked for an easy recipe with ingredients I had on hand and I found this recipe.  I will make again.  Something was missing, so next time I will use a few more spices or more garlic.  I cooked it for about 55 min or so and it was perfect(not dry at all)- melted in our mouths!  My picky husband and 2-year-old inhaled it.  Thanks

Great recipe.  Took in some of the other suggestions to melt butter and mix with herbs.  I also added in fresh pepper to the mix and lined the bottom of the pan with olive oil, lime (or lemon), and pepper as well.

Okay...This was just not good. The temp time is way off, I only needed 45 minutes. Also...I was expecting this delicious buttery taste, and instead it was very bland! The buttery flavor got watered down by the chicken juices, and I couldn't even taste the basil. Nothing at all had any flavor.

Really tasty and simple. We just had this for dinner tonight and while it isn't super exciting, it is a perfect go-to dish when you don't feel like doing much work.  Just season the chicken and pop it in the oven. I tucked the butter under the skin and put the seasonings on top, basted a couple of times with the melted butter, and checked the internal temp. after 45 minutes. It needed 10 more minutes and was great. Thanks for the recipe.

I am single and live alone. So after adjusting the recipe for (2) servings,  and taking some suggestions into consideration, I made this chicken for dinner. It was DELICIOUS! I decreased the basil by 1/3, only using 1 teaspoon. I don't use garlic salt, but love garlic, so I used 1 teaspoon garlic powder. I added 1/2 teaspoon salt (which I will probably reduce next time to about 1/4 teaspoon or just a smidge more), and 2 tablespoons butter. I mixed it all together and put on top of (2) skinned bone-in chicken breasts. I put 2 tablespoons lemon juice in the bottom of the pan and cooked uncovered for 1 hour. I loved it! It was moist and had a lot of favor. It was very simple and easy to make and I WILL be using this recipe again. It was DELICIOUS!!!

Just tried this recipe tonight and it was simple and delicious!  Like others have said the aroma wafting from the oven was very appetizing.  I think when I do it again I will cover it with foil for the last 20 minutes though because one person who ate it tonight thought it was a bit dry.  I thought it was great though, really tender and delicious.  Such a simple combo of ingredients and prep with yummy results!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe right up until I got to temperature and time in the oven. I adjusted to 375 degrees for 35 minutes. It came out juicy, had OK flavor (kinda bland), didn't fill my house with wonderful aromas. I'm thinking it had to be the temp/time adjustment. I did put the softened butter on the chicken and put the mixed together seasonings on that. It seemed like that was the best way to do it. I will try it again.

I've been making this for years.  I also make this with dried Oregano which I like even better than  basil.    I don't measure, but shake on because more is better.  A couple of reviewers said the chicken was dry.  I tried it once with skinless chicken breasts beause that was all what I had on hand and it was too dry for my taste.  This is one dish that needs to be made with bone-in chicken breasts with skin (you can discard the skin if you don't want the extra calories, but it is the best part).  A little melted butter is also good otherwise the herbs don't stick and adds a nice taste.

I used boneless skinless. I followed other reviewers in melting the butter then mixing in the herbs. Added some lemon pepper but also split garlic salt with garlic powder.. 1/2 t garlic salt 1/2 t garlic powder. I added a hint of white wine (maybe 1t or 1 1/2t..i usually eye ball my ingredients). I basted the chicken then on 350 till it was no longer pink. Was tasty!!

We'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars if we could.  It was good, but nothing to knock your socks off.  I would cook it again, simply because it was so easy and it's something different.  I did add a little lemon dill seasoning at the end.  I used boneless chicken breasts.

Really moist!  Worked well with boneless chicken breast cooked for 45 minutes.  I did have to add more spices (garlic pepper and Cavender's salt free greek seasoning) to make it more flavorful. However, wow! what an easy recipe with pretty great results.  I will definitely experiment with other seasonings.

Not dry at all but sadly, not much flavor either.  I think it will be good with extra seasonings...I'm sorry but it was bland as-is.

A very boring recipe. There was little flavour. The 1st time I try a new recipe I follow it exactly as given. With some additional herbs and spices this could be a block buster church offering. Be sue to marinate the chicken breasts/thigh fillets in a nice white wine. When marinating with wine NEVER use anything you wouldn't drink.

This is a good recipe, but nothing special.  However, it was a change from the everyday chicken.  I followed the recipe to the tee, my family just likes a little more flavor and spice.

I givet his 3 1/2 stars.  I made as is, but added a little lemon juice as other suggested.  It was good and tasty, a nice change for baked chicken...but it wasn't exciting enough to make again.  I'm glad I tried it though!  Thanks for recipe!

This was good.  I added too many extra seasonings to mention, but what I liked was that it was tasty and not too filling.  For health reasons, we're trying to avoid the cream of whatever soups, and this filled the bill.

We did not like this recipe.  We did use boneless skinless chicken breasts but did not change anything else, and we thought there was just too much basil in this recipe.  Might try again with half the spices, but not anytime soon.

A definite hit!! I needed to prepare a quick chicken dish and it was definitely that!! Loved the taste and that it was so easy to prepare. I used skinless chicken breasts and eliminated greasing the pan. The butter and fat from the chicken is sufficient to prevent the chicken from sticking. It was still great!!

This recipe is, in fact, super simple and very good! I usually use poultry seasoning in addition to the basil. This is okay for boneless, skinless breasts too.

Thanks for an easy, tender, moist chicken dish that my whole family loved!  I don't give out "5's" very often--only if my whole family likes the dish, including my picky young children--but this got a well-deserved "5"!  I substituted Benecol for the butter because my husband has high cholesterol, & it was delicious!

This was very good but we don't eat the chicken skin and that is where all the seasoning is.  I wonder if it would be good lifting the skin and seasoning underneath it.  I know the skin helps to keep the chicken moist and it was very moist.

Where I got flavoring it was very good, just didn't get quite enough.  Mostly just moist chicken.

We love this recipe. We season it more/different because the recipe calls for less than we like but the butter is an awesome idea! My husband and our son LOVE this chicken. We will actually be making it for his first birthday party! Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe. It's very easy and delicious. I used breast tenders and baked at 425 degrees for about 30 minutes using a shallow quiche dish. I hesitated when adding the basil and garlic because I thought it was too much, but I'm glad I didn't because it came out perfect.

I did used olive oil for the pan and cracked some sea salt over it then placed the chicken on and seasoned with the garlic salt, butter, and squeezed half lime over it. The chicken turned out very dry for me as well as others. Perhaps it was because I used skinless boneless breasts. The butter sauce made up for it and i ate it anyway. If it wasn't so dry i would have gave it a 5. But apparently it was something i did wrong, still good though

This wasnt very flavorful and somewhat bland. I even added some savory and a bit of salt and pepper. It was good mixed in together with some garlic & herb wild rice pilaf tho. Next time I will stick with my usual of adding more spices & herbs!

It wasn't quite good for my taste. So I changed the recipe. I melt the butter, put in basil, pepper, garlic powder and i saute in it the chicken. When ready I remove chicken into a lightly greaed oven pan. I toss in the remaining butter salt, pepper, basil and garlic powder again, cheese, and add two or three drop of cooking cream and lemon juice. Then I our it over the chicken, cover it with sheredded cheese, and bake untill cheese melted, and browned a little. 
Now my mom loves it. Thanks for the recipe, it's a good basic recipe.

This is a great family recipe! Easy to make and I've made it several times and it always turns out good. The only thing I changed was the seasonings.

Not bad.  My husband and I liked this because it was a change from our usual chicken dishes.  Will most likely make again!

i needed something quick and easy and this was it! what a fantastic chicken dish that took little or no effort to prepare. i cut the butter in half (2 Tbs. instead of 4) and would/will use a little bit less basil and garlic salt next time. it was a bit on the salty side for me. all in all a winner, thank you for an excellent recipe!

This chicken was so good!  The only thing that I would change is putting some of the butter, basil and salt under the skin...I'm not a fan of eating the skin of the chicken so it lost alot of the flavor when I took that off. But it was perfectly done and delicious!  My 7 year old ate a whole breast...cleaned the bone!  And that is the best compliment around here!!!

Chicken was definitely moist, but I didn't find the flavor to be anything spectacular.  I don't think I will make this again.
