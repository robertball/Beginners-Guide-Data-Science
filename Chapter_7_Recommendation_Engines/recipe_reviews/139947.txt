Great tasting! I also tried it a little "lighter" by baking the chicken instead of breading and frying it.

Excellent meal!  We had this for lunch though I boiled/baked fresh artichokes that needed to be used up.  In the future I will probably get the jarred kind from the store--the amount of time it takes to prep artichoke is far too much work for a simple lunch.  An excellent way to use up extra spaghetti sauce.  We used mozzarella sticks and Prego sauce.  Everyone enjoyed it, including my 3-year-old.  Definitely recommend this one!

This was an AWESOME sandwich! It totally reminded me of a chicken parmesan sanwich, except kicked up. I did saute 8oz. sliced mushrooms with the onion because they needed to be used up, and they ended up being a great addition. I used marinated artichokes, which provided an exrta layer of flavor and yumminess and added more cheese than called for. This is a VERY filling sandwich, but one I will most certainly be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty good. However, there is not nearly enough sauce to cover all six sandwiches. I would suggest doubling the sauce.

These were ok.  The sauce and the artichoke hearts weren't that great.
