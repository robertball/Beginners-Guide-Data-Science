This was good, although a little spicy for my kids. I used fresh ginger instead of powdered, and added red and yellow peppers because I like veggies in my stir fry. I am still looking for a really awesome stir fry recipe. This is worth making, but it won't knock your socks off. Be sure to use good quality beef so it is tender.

I made this recipe according to directions, but added some pea pods & a few green onion pieces for color.  While it was very tasty, it was much too soupy for my liking.  The sauce never thickened. I think the 1 cup of beef broth is way too much for a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken.  If I make this again, I'll cut way down on the broth, maybe even eliminating it.

we didn't care for this - the beef was not tender and the flavor was off.

I received this with cooknik, which had a side of colorful bellpeppers and pineapples.  When you use the recommended meat, it turns out SO tender and delicious.  I used a minimal amount of red pepper flakes due to having kids eat this meal.  Will definitely serve again.
