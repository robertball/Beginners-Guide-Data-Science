These have such a marvelous flavor.  They look very plain, but so what?  Be sure to take them out of the oven before they are overdone, or else they will get hard when they cool.

I think that these were not really my families taste more than anything, but we found the texture to be too chewy (not really crisp and not really soft).  I liked the taste of the nutmeg and thought they complemented a cup of coffee nicely, the rest of the family didn't think they had enough flavor.

I don't like to give unfavourable reviews, but this recipe just didn't have enough flavour for me.  I made the 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg a very rounded one, but the cookies still just weren't spicy enough for me.  I won't be making these again.

These were good cookies. They turned out almost cake-like for me. I halved the recipe but next time will make the whole recipe. Very flavorful.

Great texture and flavor.  They taste better the next day (though there was question as to whether or not any would last that long!).  Very easy to make.

These were nice.  Next time I'll bump up the nutmeg...and over baking is not a good thing for these cookies.. agreed

I made these at Christmas. They are delicious.  I added  a full teaspoon extra of nutmeg.  The flavor and crispy texture was perfect.

These are delicious.  I baked them for a cookie exchange and they were a big hit.
