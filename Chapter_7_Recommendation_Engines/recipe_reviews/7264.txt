This is a very special recipe I've made for years. I have a hint to offer...I only use 1 ounce of red food coloring, then I fill the bottle with water and add that to the mixture for the additional ounce of liquid. The color of the cake does not change and I save about $2.50 each time I omit one bottle of red food coloring.

This is nearly word for word the recipe I got from my grandma. She used to make this for our birthdays. It is one of my favorites. It is sooooo hard to find one withOUT the cream cheese frosting, that stuff is good on carrot cake, but horrible on red cake. The frosting here (although my grandma made it with 2T cornstarch instead of 5T flour, she also used 'oleo' instead of butter) is much closer to the real thing. Red Cake is only good with the right frosting.

My mother also makes this cake. We called it Red Velvet Cake. It is to die for. Remember the grooms cake from Steel Magnolias? Same cake. You can make it into an Armadello or not. :)

Pure heaven... and sin. The frosting can be a little tricky, but worth it. (Think cream cheese frosting for carrot cake, it just isn't good without it.)

Make this cake once and you will HAVE to make it again. Save it for special occasions so you only have to go through all of that food coloring once or twice a year or so. Great for Birthday cakes and Valentine's Day.

The reason some reviewers are coming up short with a single batch of frosting is because the recipe, as originally developed, called for frosting between the cake layers only, NOT the sides. 

The classic way to frost this cake is to leave the sides unfrosted and a thick spread of frosting between each layer.

I'm also surprised at the amount of cocoa and vinegar in some of these recipes. My grandmother's recipe (consistant blue ribbon winner at fairs) calls for only 1 tsp of vinegar and 2 1/2 tsps cocoa. Too much cocoa ruins the bright red color of the cake, it comes out too brown, plus that might be what caused a "heavy, floury taste" that one reviewer complained about.

This is such a great recipe. I love the frosting. It's much better if it sits overnight in the fridge and served the next day.

I have a copy of a Waldorf Astoria's recipe for Red Velvet cake and I've made it often (just last week was the lates)  Do yourself a favor sub the shortening with canola oil.  You'll be amazed at the difference in moistness. In a bind (if you don't have buttermilk) add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to enough milk to make one cup and let sit atleast 5 minutes.  Although many Southerners would faint, switch to a cream cheese frosting.  The tang of the cream cheese frosting complements this cake very well.

I  can help here. My mother got the recipie for this cake from the chef at the Astoria and paid 250 dollars for it many years ago.  Then they shared the recipie out because he charged so much for it! In the original I have, there are these differences...Use 2 1/2 cups cake flour, 1 tsp salt, 2tsp cocoa, 1 tsp white vinegar and in the frosting only 3 TBS of flour....it will make a huge difference!!

I made 2 8 inch layers and frosted between the two layers instead of cutting the cake into four layers. I also increased the cooking time to 35 minutes.  It came out moist and delicious.
I can't say enough good things about the icing.  It tastes like custard and it's very hard not to eat it all before frosting the cake.
Since my icing was soft I didn't ice the outside until I got the cake to work.  It was a big hit and I'd definitely make it again and use the frosting on other cakes too.

Just made this for my sweetie for Valentine's Day.  It turned out perfectly, but I decided I'm more of a fan of regular, sweeter cake. As for the frosting, I followed other reviewer's advice to double the frosting, and I ended up with enough frosting for two cakes (funny how that works, huh?).  Although, I simply stacked one cake on top of the other, so there were only two layers, not 4, so maybe that's why I had so much frosting left over!  Good quality recipe, though!

This cake is divine.  It is not "sweet" and the frosting is the best part.  I agree with everyone else that says creams cheese frosting absolutely ruins this cake.  This is not an easy cake though.  I make this for my son's birthday, who will be 30 this year and still to this day, sometimes it turns out wonderful and sometimes I am throwing it away and starting over.  I have not ever had a problem using the tablespoon portions of cocoa and vinegar.  The cake still turns out a deep rich red with just a slight hint of chocolate.  It is beautiful and delicious.

This is the same recipe I remember from my childhood with the only exception being my recipe used granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar. Powdered sugar changes the taste a bit. Don't worry, if you cream the butter and the granulated sugar until it is light and fluffy, it actually dissolves and you don't get a gritty texture. Also, I add the cooled flour mixture to the butter.sugar mixture, a bit at a time with the mixer running.

This is the same cake my mother made for my birthday every year! My b'day is on valentines day, so it was always heart shaped. I have had this with cream cheese, but it is NOT the same. Not even worth eating if you ask me! The frosting is the key! Very time consuming but worth EVERY minute! Enjoy

Delish. This is the same name and recipe that my grandma used to make. It took me years to get it to turn out, for me the key is to dump everything in the mixer and then turn it on. Presto, I sometimes make it into cupcakes or cook it in a bundt pan. It's beautiful as purple too. Frosting is to die for, I like mine lumpy. Yum Yum!

This cake was delicious and everyone enjoyed it.  I made it for Chirstmas Day and then another Family get together with different family members several days after Christmas.  The only caveat I recommend is to make twice the frosting.  The second time I made it I used twice the frosting and it was even better than the first time I made it.  The single frosting recipe was too skimpy for the 4 layer cake.

Wonderful recipe!!! I followed directions exactly, except I used green food coloring instead of red so I can take to our St Patrick's Party tomorrow. Also  for fun I put a few drop of the green food colorin in a sandwich bag with about 1/2 cup of sugar, and used that to garnish the top. Beautiful and tasty!

I made this for valentines day and the cake was amazing! The only bad thing was that I made it into cupcakes, which turned out pretty bad. They tasted great but crumbled and fell apart and they were so messy when people tried to unwrap them! The icing was weird by itself but tasted perfect when paired with the cake. This recipe is best done as a cake and not cupcakes!

This cake is THE BEST!!!!!  The frosting is what is the difference between it and the others! Only make this cake when you are taking it where others will eat it, or you will find out that you CAN eat the WHOLE cake!!

I could probably given this all 5 stars, except...  I poured the batter evenly into two 8-inch cake pans and while baking, it completely overflowed both pans lending that oh-so-lovely acrid, burnt, smokey smell to our home on what was supposed to be a romantic Valentine's Day dinner.  I searched all the previous reviews, and evidently I am the only baker to have had this experience.  (Lucky me!)  So now, I hope to find my original recipe file box and see what might be different.
Otherwise my children have loved this cake for all occasions, and I did discover that once the butter & sugar (I always used granulated) were creamed, adding in the cooled milk/flour mixture and using the whip attachment made the frosting seem almost like fantastical whipped cream!
If anyone can respond to the pan size conundrum, I would appreciate it!      = )

This recipe is a BIG family favorite.  I usually reserve it for birthdays as it is rather fussy to make, but absolutely worth it.  A couple of suggestions:1-cool the flour/milk mixture for the frosting absolutely completely. I suggest beating it over a bowl of ice.  Your frosting can curdle if you don't.  2- mix the vinegar and baking soda together and add to the rest of the cake mixture.  3-sprinkle the entire cake with coconut.  The flavor combination is unbelievable.

I baked this for our senior's valentine dinner at church.  I made 2 9" cakes and then cut them in half - 4 layers.  It was a hit!  One gentleman asked if he could take a piece home and I said, "Of course."  Then his wife who was standing behind me said, "Do I get to take a piece home too?"  So I put them on plates for them to take home.  I fortunately cut them into small pieces and so had 22 pieces instead of 20 (wasn't sure how many would be coming) and fortunately had a couple to take home.  I find putting the cake in a cool place makes the frosting firmer and it tastes even better. when chilled  Thanks for a great recipe.

This cake fell for some reason. Also the froasting was relatively tasteless. I would make traditional whipped frosting instead to compliment the type of cake.  Also, the cake was a bit spongy and not sweet enough.

This is exactly the recipe my mom has been using for my birthday cakes for decades.  I went looking for her copy (clipped from the newspaper in the 70s), and found it only partially legible - so this is quite the find for me.   This cake can be a little challenging and time consuming, but SOOOO worth it. The frosting is what really makes this the best - don't shortcut it.

I made the cake on one occasion and the icing on several occasions.  The icing is an excellent old fashioned white icing that is not too sweet and has the smooth texture of whipped cream.  The cake which is what I am really rating here is just ok.  The texture is wonderful and moist and the color is a beautiful deep red.  The flavor is what I am unhappy with.  It's....blah.  I followed the directions exactly but it's missing something.  Maybe I should have substituted the shortening with butter?  Maybe add more vanilla extract?  Without any icing, the cake is not sweet enough or tasty enough.  The icing makes it enjoyable.  I think you can find another better red velvet recipe.  But this icing recipe is excellent.

My mother made this also when I was young.  I've made two before at Christmas time.  One with red food coloring and one with green food coloring.  Then put a red and a green layer on each cake.

My boys don't normally like cake.  It's usually too sweet and it's rare if we finish half of one.  This cake, however, is a new family favorite.  My boys eat a piece whenever they can and it doesn't last long around here.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it is better if you double the icing.

What can I say..best cake ever!! A family friend has talked about this cake for years, and always maintained that no one outside his family knew the recipe. He sure was surprised when I made it for my husbands birthday. And he had to admit this one was even better.  Thanks v monte!!

this is the same recipe handed down thru the generations that I have used.  It is fabulous!  Use these ingredients and don't try to make sugar free or fat free.  You will love this recipe!

I have made this cake any times and love it. My recipe is slightly different. 1 tsp soda, 1 1/2 Tbsp coca, bake in three 9" pans. And you have to use the frosting recipe, cream cheese frosting is  no go. I do make into cupcakes because I make this for valentines day so I can divide and give to my kids. They turn our perfect.
My favorite cake!

The cake sunk in, reasons found: ingredients should be at room temp and do not grease sides of pans so cake while baking doesn't pull away.
Lastly, too much baking soda. 

These steps I find are vital and should be written in with the recipe.

Simply divine. Awesome flavor. However we only used 1 oz of food coloring, we thought 2 ozs was over kill.

Deliciosa!  However, i used cake flour instead of all-purpose.. and sifted all dry ingredients...   Rises just perfectly--- be careful not to overdo in oven else will lose some of its moist-ness. :)

I had high expectations and was disappointed. Interestingly, I had commented to my friend that the cake was heavy and had a strong flour, salt/vinegar taste. I've noticed a few similar comments here.  I was a little relieved to hear that it wasn't just me.

This cake wasn't nearly sweet enough. I found the same thing to be true that PYGMALION had said. I could taste the salt/flour combination. I did like the frosting though and would use it again- but the cake least you wondering "What is this aftertaste and how can i fix it." There are so many wonderful cake recipes out there that I wouldn't waste my time on this one.

This cake tasted ... strange to say the least.  With the frosting, at least, it came close to tasting cake-like -but without- there was that bitter/vinegar/baking soda taste, and it was horrible.  I'm relatively sure I made no mistakes with the recipe, so I really can't call it good.  Part of this was probably due to the fact that the frosting didn't quite cover every frostable surface, and without the frosting, the cake was a little dry.  In the end, it came out tasting like rather bland chocolate cake, but despite the taste, it was very moist and light.

I am not much for red velvet cake but was asked to make one for a Valentine Luncheon.  I chose this one because of the rave reviews it received.  I guess I didn't let the flour and milk mixture cool enough because the frosting was a little on the runny side.  So I followed another suggestion and used cream cheese frosting instead and topped it with chopped pecans.  The cake itself was a little on the heavy side and I am wondering if using cake flour would make a difference.  My ladies liked it and that is what is most important to me. I will try this one again and make some adjustments.  Thanks v monte!

chart.
