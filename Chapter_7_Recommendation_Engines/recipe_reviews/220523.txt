I have made homemade Irish cream before and the recipes that I have do not call for eggs. So I left them out of this recipe also. I think if I used heavy whipping cream in place of the evaporated milk it would take it way over-the-top, replacing the creaminess the eggs would have given it. Overall a good recipe for Irish cream. Update: just made a similar recipe with heavy whipping cream, much better and creamier.
