I am a pretty inexperienced cook & have always been a bit intimidated with trying to "bread" things.  This was simple, quick, and the fish was so tasty!  It's a basic start, easy to embelish.

Really liked this recipe.  At first I thought It was a joke because I don't usually fry fish in olive oil nor use flour for batter, but it worked!  Really outstanding.  Using 1/2 the flour with the same amount of spice, but no salt.  Great!

This is delicious and so quick to prepare! I have never been a big fan of halibut but this recipe changed my mind. Funny I have never thought to combine Old Bay and hers de Provence before, they blend so nicely. And the cooking directions here were spot on, though I did cook my husband's piece for about 5 minutes at 400 because he likes his fish more well done than I do. Recommend!

Delicious!  To make this healthier, I browned the halibut in oil to get the color and crust set, and then roasted in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes, since I like my fish well done.  We really enjoyed this dish.

The whole family LOVED this recipe.  The best halibut since our visit to Alaska a couple of years ago.  There was a lot of extra flour mixture left over.  Next time I will use half the flour and spices, as it didn't take much to coat 1 lb of halibut.  Cooking time was just right, don't expect the fish to brown as much as the photo though.

Flavor was good but i didn't like how the crust became soggy. I think it's because of the egg. I usually cover with flour only. Also, i find that 1 cup of flour is too much. For one pound of fish sliced in fingers, i hardly used half of it.

Very easy to make, no mess from deep frying.  Variation on the spices as I had already seasoned the fish. I used garlic and parsley from Badia and a little Badia Sason.

6/16 I didn't have any Herbs de Provence, so I used a garlic and French herbs mix instead. I couldn't really taste the herbs but wonder if I didn't add enough. I used one cup of flour and doubled everything else for about 3 pounds of fish. I didn't have quite enough flour. It just tasted like regular fried fish... that DH caught in Alaska ??

8/18 I had 2 big fillets and halved the flour, worked great, but fried too long and was dry.

Excellent recipe for halibut cheeks! Just reduce the frying times. Also I found a cup of flour is a waste for a pound of halibut. I cut the amount of flour by a third to one-half.

I haven't much experience cooking fish, but this recipe, with a couple of modifications, was excellent. I used a gluten free flour, Bragg's seasoning, and cooked it in coconut oil. Loved it!
