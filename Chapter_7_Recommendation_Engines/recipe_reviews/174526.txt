It was definitely a good recipe. I added a little butter to the pasta so it would not be sticky and such. I also added a dash of red pepper to the "marinade" and it was absolutely wonderful!

After reading the reviews I was very excited to try this recipe, but my husband and I were disappointed.  The chicken was very bland.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was just missing something.  Any suggestions to make it taste more flavorful would be appreciated.  I would like to try making it again.

I used the light alfredo and sprinkled italian bread crumbs on top before baking.  My husband ate every bite and my 1 year old loved it.

This chicken is perfect ofr fettuchine recipes. Don't change a things. It turned out so moist and tender. The seasoning is easy and simple and tastes great. It complements alfredo sauce really nicely.

this recipe was great! I doubled the marinade because I was short on time and was worried that it wouldn't have enough flavor, boy was I wrong! This made the chicken so tender and juicy! I cooked the breasts whole, then cut them into bite sized pieces and let them sit in the baking dish in the drippings while the pasta was cooking to give them even more flavor. I used bow tie pasta with melted butter,garlic powder and grated parmesan cheese and then tossed the chicken pieces in to make a one dish meal. everyone loved this! In fact this simple marinade gave the chicken so much flavor, that I am using it again today to cook some chicken ahead and freeze to have on hand for a quick meal. Thanks this recipe is wonderful!

This was great! Juicy chicken! I drizzled alfredo sauce over the chicken and pasta and served peas with it. Was a hit for my picky eaters!

Pretty simple and delicious! Served with any kind of pasta is a good way to round out this meal.

Delicious! I used 1/2 c. fresh basil and couple big shakes dry thyme, & 3 bulbs garlic, instead of basic Italian & 1 bulb. Absolutely delicious! Also poured leftover marinade over when cooking. Didn't serve extra marinade at end, but VERY MOIST and delicous. Husband loved! However, don't use the alfredo recipe (by search) here. Not good! Used regular instead of fresh parmesan, could have made the difference, but WAY too much fat, and not a great taste for all the butter, cheese used.

This recipe was much better than I expected with so few ingredients.  It is one of those you can prepare in the morning and pop into the oven when you get home from work.  Very good!
