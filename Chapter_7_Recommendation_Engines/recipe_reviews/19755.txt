I did not like this recipe very much at all. It messed up my whole kitchen with all the bowls and saucepans. Did not like the cinnamon at all, seemed too much. Kids would not eat it. Very disappointed.

This was a lot of work for a very dry, bland dish.  There was not enough white sauce or egg mixture to thoroughly cover the noodles.  More meat would have helped, too.

This is almost the same recipe that has been in my family for decades! Our recipe didn't call for bread cubes, however. As someone already mentioned, it IS an acquired taste, but our family added our own little "fixin's" for pizazz. I like mozzarella cheese on top. My mother enjoyed paprika on hers. My father liked black and green olives on his.

This is the same recipe that I have and believe me, it is time consuming, but well worth it. Unfortunately it is an acquired taste, and if you expect mac and cheese you will be dissappointed. OUr family enjoys this at special times of the year and it is something EVERYONE requests! I find that if you use an electric mixer when you are thickening the crema (cheese sauce) it works better.

This had no taste to it.  It was very dry and bland.  I wish I would have read through the reviews before I made it.  I could not find my recipe from my friend so I tried this one. There was not enough seasoning or sauce; the bread ended up absorbing the sauce.

This recipe would have gotten four stars if it didn't take so long for what it turned out to be. Reheated was better then straight out of the oven.
