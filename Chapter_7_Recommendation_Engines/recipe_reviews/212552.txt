I would have given this 5 stars but 7 hours in the slow cooker was WAY TOO LONG! The rice ended up really mushy :( I also added seasoned salt, garlic salt and pepper for a little more flavor because it was a little bland.. A good tip: When I tasted it after it had been cooking for 5 hours, the rice was fully cooked and so was the chicken. i wouldn't cook it for 7 hours. Luckily my husband is Samoan and not a picky eater at all so we ate it and loved it regardless :)

YUM! I added a bit of garlic powder. I used frozen chicken breasts, and shredded the chicken right before we ate. I also put sour cream in the wrap. So good, so easy. Five frozen breasts cooked just fine in my cooker in 6.75 hours on low.

I made this for a mexican lunch party at work. It was really good. I cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours. It was not spicey or anything. I'm not a spicey fan. It was not too mushy either, but I used extra long grain rice.

A fantastic throw everything in the pot meal. We added shredded cheese, black olive, avocado and sour cream to each wrap. My son put his in a hard taco shell and loved it!

I took the other reviews to heart and added some spices and kept an eye on the cooking time. I ended up cooking it on low for 5 hours, then put it on warm till it was dinnertime. We loved it, definitely will make it again.

I'm reluctant to review this recipe as I did not following the recipe as written.  But the concept is great! I had most of the ingredients but no time for the slow cooker. So I cooked the rice per the package and boiled then cubed the chicken. Then I mixed the cheese soup, rice, chicken and a can of rotel tomatoes and the spooned into a tortilla.  Topped with sour cream these were pretty good.  Thanks for a great starter recipe!

Fantastic quick meal. I used Pace mild salsa and used pretty much the entire jar in the crock pot, as we like that flavor. I also didn't have cheddar cheese soup on hand, but did have the Southwestern Pepper Jack from Campbell's so I used that instead. When we were ready to eat, we added sour cream and some more salsa to the wraps. Delicious...I'll be making these again.

These turned out pretty good.  I pre-cooked my chicken and rice (the recipe doesn't state to do either).  But I had a hard time putting raw meat into the slow cooker, I just felt like it wouldn't cook proper & I was afraid if I didn't cook the rice it might not cook all the way in the crock pot and it might come out cruncy.  So I precooked the rice & chicken.  Mixed everything together in the crockpot and put in the refrigerator overnight (so I could just turn the crockpot on in the morning as I walked out the door to work!).  I'm not a big fan of pace picante sauce, used it anyways and still liked the outcome.  The cheddar cheese soup at the grocery store was completely sold out!  UGH. I used broccoli cheese soup instead. I think this changed the taste of the meal a little but overall I was really happy with the way this turned out.  VERY filling, simple, inexpensive and easy to make.  I also threw in a can of black beans to the slow cooker. Yum.

I wanted to review this exactly as written, however the only soup I had on hand was Fiesta Cheese soup.  Honestly, even with this addition, it was really bland and the rice didn't cook, it was still crunchy.  I had to take it out of the crock pot and cook on the stove to finish cooking the rice.  Overall, kids thought it was ok...but I wouldn't make this again without some serious additions to the flavor.  It needs some rotel or salsa to spice it up a bit.  I really wanted to like it, good concept...it just fell flat for us.

Halved this recipe.- cooked on low for 4 hrs. Great base, but very bland -as is- even with a small can of green chillies added.

I make this all the time it's delicious!!! My husband absolutely loves it! Ive made a few minor changes. I use 2 bottles ragu cheese sauce, rice sides Mexican rice and enchilada sauce. I cook the rice on the stove top as add it to the meat just before preparing the wraps I put them together in a casserole dish add enchilada sauce and cheese to the too and bake until cheese is melted!  So very good! Even my 2 year old daughter loves these! Of course she's into spicy foods!

I found that there was too much liquid after cooking for 7.5 hours on low and - like many other readers - the rice was mushy. To be fair, I didn't make this recipe "as-is." I used a 16 oz can of red enchilada sauce. (I thought I had picante but I didn't.) Also, I used one can of Cheddar Cheese soup and one can of Cream of Chicken. I also added a little bit of cumin, a pinch of Adobo seasoning, and a small can of green chiles (drained) because I like spicy Mexican food. Also the chicken seemed a little over-cooked and not as juicy as some of the other slow cooker chicken meals I have tried. Although I didn't have the time, perhaps I could have shredded the chicken when I got home and simmered in a skillet to cook off some of the liquid. The flavor was the one redeeming part of this dish. Not sure if I'll make this one again.

I made the recipe as is. Others said that it was bland but I didn't think so. I thought that it had good flavor. If anything you could add garlic or chili powder or something. Rice got a little mushy from being in the crockpot too long...but next time i'll just have to have it in there less time. (It only cooked for 5 hours.) But it was delicious wrapped in the tortillia with some sour cream!

This recipe is easy to make when you don't have time to do a lot of prep work.  I threw frozen chicken breasts into the crockpot and then shredded them just before serving.  The recipe as written seems to be missing that kick.  I used a medium chunky salsa but the spicy flavors got lost in the rice.  I would make this again with less rice and possibly add a hotter salsa along with black beans.

This recipe was fairly good. It had lots of flavour and was really easy to put together. It could even be eaten on its own, without the tortillas.

This came out well for me.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used the nacho cheese soup instead of cheddar.  I also used my favorite salsa rather than the Pace sauce.  I cooked everything on low for 7 hours and everything came out fine.  A couple pieces of rice actually seemed undercooked.  I'll definitely make this again.  It was good alone or with tortillas.

I substituted cheddar cheese soup for cream of chicken and used instant rice. I only needed to cook for 2hrs on low. I also have a smaller than usual slow cooker, so I think you could make even more of this in a regular size, large cooker. tastes great. I think I'll add a little pepper and salt, but if I had used the cheddar cheese soup, I wouldn't need to.

I add whole boneless skinless chicken breats then shred towards end of cooking.  Also substituted mild salsa for picante sause - kids preference.  Added can of rinsed black beans after shredding chicken - just time enough to warm beans.  May try adding corn and chopped sweet red peppers next time.  I cooked on high 6 hours - may reduce cooking time next time as rice was a bit mushy. Kids ate without complaints!  A keeper!

Don't make this if you're looking for something spectacular, but if you're looking for something easy this is pretty good. It was a little bland, but putting some pepper sauce on it when serving really helps. I think next time I will add some diced tomatoes and green chilies and some black beans. This is also good without the shell.

I made this recipe without reading reviews till I had it all in the crock pot, then I noticed them and seen so much negativity I was worried, but it turned out great and delicious. I altered the cooking process a bit, low for 2 hours then high for 2 hours and it was cooked, just turned it back down to low for about an hour when it was dinner time . Everyone else in the house enjoyed them as well, I was the only one that had to add hot sauce to the final tortilla

The family loved this recipe! Based on other reviews, I added one package of taco seasoning to give it some added kick. I also added a can of corn and a can of sliced black olives. I used frozen chicken tenders and shredded it after it was cooked. It is extremely versatile recipe to use as a taco filler or for nachos.
