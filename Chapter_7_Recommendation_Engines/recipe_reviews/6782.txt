Really good - fluffy and light, very delicious. I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil instead of 1/3 cup and greased the pan the second time I made them, which (I thought) really improved the flavor and made them easier to handle. Definitely try if you have sourdough starter around.

When I took these out of the oven, my boyfriend thought they were cookies not biscuits. They are more like a soft cookie than a biscuit, but, they are pretty tasty and good with butter spread on top.

These biscuits were really light and fluffy.  They needed a little more taste, next time I will add a little more salt and a little butter in the dough.  I used a little extra baking soda to make them more fluffy and less like scones.

I used a sweet starter and they turned out more like scones.  I would never make this recipe as biscuts but I will use it to make scones again and again.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I don't think these can accurately be called "biscuits" - they really are almost like a sourdough cookie.  They didn't rise and were dense.

Easy to make.  The kids love it.  I add about 1tbs of sugar to sweeten it.  I start out with a basic starter.  I am lucky if I get one.

Good starting point.  I went a little wild adding flavoring to the mix.  Two teaspoons of peppermint oil or vanillia made for great treats!

This was my first recipe with my sourdough starter, and they came out quite well.  I agree that they are better a bit larger--I made mine double the recommended tablespoon.  Mine didn't rise too much while baking, so what you drop is what you've got, basically.

I made the recipe as stated, no changes or additions. With my starter, the biscuits where light and fluffy, so fluffy that I could not butter them. But that was fine as they were planed to go with sausage gravy. It is a perfect pairing, a match made in heaven. I will use these biscuits every time I plan on having sausage gravy.

The idea of this recipe sounded great, but the end result was disappointing. I made it 2 times, once using the suggestion of using a little sugar, and one without. Both times they just lacked good flavor and a nice consistency. I use the sourdough starter II and the bread made with it always comes out great, just didn't care for this recipe much, sorry.

Recipie is very easy.  I did add 1/2 cup more flour and 2 tbsp. of sugar.  They came out with a mild sweet sour flavor.  They were more cakey than biscuit style.  Veery good, I will make again.

Biscuits were dense, not light and fluffy.  Good, edible but not remarkable.  I was looking for a way to use some sourdough starter so this was a reasonable way to use it.

I couldn't get these to brown even the slightest without cooking for another 5 minutes.  I'm a fan of larger biscuits so I only yielded 8 from the recipe as is.  Good base though to add your spin!

Every body starter thickness is different. I had to add about another cup of flour to make a nice soft stiff dough which I could then scoop up with a spoon. I did add garlic we love garlic put it in everything. The biscuits came out light and fluffy. A keeper for me.

I added 2tbls of applesauce for the baking soda (there is not enough acid in the recipe otherwise).  They came out great; light and fluffy.  I'll have to double the recipe next time.

it's a quick, easy and smart way to use your surplus starter to make scones: nothing to write home about, but interesting and unbelievably friendly. In a few minutes and with 3 basic ingredients you make something that a lot of people wouldn't dream to be able to produce... I added sugar and dried cranberries and no baking powder or soda, as my starter is quite powerful

This worked out wonderfully! We used butter instead of oil and these were to die for, melt in your mouth, delicious. This will definitely be our "Oops, we need bread fast!" recipe. Thank you!

These biscuits turn out great with a few adjustments: I use 1 tsp of baking soda, 1/4 cup of oil plus 1-2 TBS butter, and I add one 1 TBS sugar. I get 9-10 biscuits.

I added 2 tablespoons of apple sauce for acidity (and a touch more flour to keep the consistency), like someone else suggested, and these came out fluffy and delicious. I also used very slightly warmed virgin coconut oil (solid at room temp) instead of vegetable oil, and I felt like that helped with consistency (since normal biscuits often use oil that is solid at room temp and coconut oil is a tasty and healthy alternative). They are a little sweet, at least with my sourdough start, and they didn't hold together super well (I made breakfast sandwiches with my first batch and we needed forks), but they are really tasty - and the recipe also makes really fantastic scones with a tiny bit of added sugar and whatever ingredients you want (so far I've made apple cinnamon).

These weren't too bad.  We had them with a chicken stew.  I'm at an elevation of 4300 ft/1350 mt and they turned out!  I used whole wheat flour for my sourdough starter, so when I made these I used 1c WW and 2 cups white flour. I think my starter was ready enough.  Others have mentioned using this recipe for scones.  I'm going to try that and see how they work out.  As I had the pan sitting waiting to go into the oven, my husband excitedly remarked " OH COOKIES!".  I recall another saying that her's had done the same!  I recipe would make about 6 nice scones.

I'm not sure it is fair for me to rate or review this recipe because I've never had sourdough biscuits before. I did not care for them. The texture was pretty good, they cooked up nicely (I used slightly less oil) and were not too thin or runny. But the flavor seemed to lack something, though they certainly had the "sourdough" taste. I think I'm just used to buttermilk biscuits.

I guess I would not call them biscuits.  I don't know what you would call them.  At our house we just call them YUMMY!!  They are so delicous as a breakfast, snack, or dessert.  They remind me more of shortcakes and would be fabulous with fruit and whipped cream, except there aren't any left at my house!  It is a great way to use some starter really fast with very little effort.

Inedible!  I don't know if the baking soda in the recipe should read baking powder, but the biscuits were bitter and the texture was mushy.

These turned out very good, but I changed a few things to make them more biscuit-like. I used 1/2 cup cold coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. I also upped the salt to 1/2 tsp, and mixed in dried blueberries. I cooked them on a pizza stone, and my whole family loved them!

Just came out of the oven! I think this recipe is adaptable.  Can make sour or sweet as desired. This is the first time I made this. I increased the baking soda to 1 tsp for my batch. Greased my pan with butter flavored Pam. This is a keeper. Yum!

Ok, so I suppose the outcome of this recipe will depend hugely on your starter, my starter is quite mature and these turned out like a cross between scones & cookies - absolutely nothing like biscuits (which are hard & crunchy)

This is a good base recipie for a lot of fun scone options. Definatly not a biscuit, but still tasty. I added 1 Tablespoon sugar. I think they would be amazing with about 1/2 c. dried cranberrys and 1 tsp orange zest added it. Or 1/2 blueberries and 1 tsp lemon zest. Both my favorite scone flavors.

I am giving 2 stars for flavor.  The taste was great, but these are definately not biscuits.  Hubby thought they were pancakes; kids thought they were cookies.  I added about a 1/2 c extra flour and still didn't get a biscuit consistancy.

I made these to round out a quick supper. I used a sweet starter, and the biscuits were quite tasty. Tender, moist, slightly sweet, and very good with a little apricot jam (my favorite) Spread on top. The rest of my family liked them too. Will defenetly make again, though I might make them a bit bigger next time. They are a bit on the small side. Maybe even twice as big would be good.

I made these biscuits once as written and they were terrible. I tried it again today,  altering the recipe by adding sugar and frozen berries  and topping with demerara to make a scone. Turned out great. I think this is just a tricky, unpredictable recipe that behaves differently depending on the hydration level and activity of your starter, the climate in your area and whether you follow the recipe as instructed.

For the ease of this recipe and the outcome of my baked goods I would give it over 5 stars. I got to use up excess sourdough starter & extra fruit that was going to go bad (blueberries). Used 1/4 C melted butter & 1 T of sugar to make a sweet version. I dusted them with powdered sugar once cooled and voila! They were fluffy & delightful. It's such a versatile recipe. I can't wait to make more varieties.

I made these like someone else did in one of the pictures: I made divots in the dropped dough and filled it with blueberry jam. I also used melted butter instead of oil. They turned out very yummy. My kids devoured them happily. The only reason that I give it a lower rating is that they really don't say biscuit to me. They're not a scone either... something in between.

My family loved these biscuits. I did oil the cookie sheet.  I also used them  for dumplings.  They were great as well!

Made these with whole wheat instead of white flour. They had a very light, pleasing texture, but I'll add more salt (and maybe other spices) next time. Overall, a quick, easy way to use some sourdough starter.

meh, these really lack something. I can't quite put my finger on it, but they are just OK. I won't be using this recipe again. I made it as is, no changes. I also think they could have baked a tiny bit more but my oven is new to me so that could be an oven issue.

I weighed the dough at 2.2 ounces per biscuit, I got 7 biscuits a couple were 2.4 ounces. They are crumbly, they poofed a bit, but they are just really lack luster. The only thing I did different, is my sourdough starter is fed with whole wheat flour. If I were you, 
 I'd try a different recipe these aren't great.

This was a very tasty, quick and easy recipe to make, and very moist for a biscuit. I will definitely be using it again. I recommend cutting back the oil to 1/4 cup and hand-kneading if necessary to work it in.

Method Notes: I made them with the listed ingredients, besides cutting back the oil a bit as another reviewer suggested; I used a touch over 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil for a 1.5 recipe rather than the 1/3 cup for 1 recipe (so about 1/4 for a single recipe), and it required a bit of hand kneading to work it in evenly. I think I would opt for 1/2 coconut oil, 1/2 EVO next time, as they were a little too olive-y for my tastes--butter would be even better, I'm sure, but I tend to try to healthify things and don't have access to raw, grass-fed butter. Maybe it was cutting back the oil, but they definitely turned out as biscuits for me, rather than cookie-like as some reviewers mentioned. I used standard, unsweetened sourdough starter and did not add any sweetening agent. I divided the dough into 18 (so a dozen per recipe-worth of dough) hand-shaped balls, rather than just dropping by spoonfuls, and they turned out lovely and light and delicious.
