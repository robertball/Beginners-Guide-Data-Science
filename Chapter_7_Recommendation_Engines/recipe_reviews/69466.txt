I pulsed the chicken in a food processor instead of shredding it and added an egg to the mixture to make it hold together better. I also didn't have tartar sauce so I just subbed more mayo. Could have made it a bit spicier. It turned out great! My 9 month old loved it. I will definately make again.

I found this because I had leftover already cooked chicken from making quesadillas the night before. It's a fresh idea for left over chicken. I chopped the chicken breast in my food processor until it was pretty fine. This is key. I mixed it with egg mayonnaise garlic salt paprika and tarragon. I dipped the patties in egg and coated them in panko breading. pan fried in a non stick rachel ray small frying pan lightly sprayed with olive oil. I felt inspired to then put them on a baking sheet cover them in marinara sauce sprinkle each one with mozzerella and broil until the cheese was browned. They were good that night and they were good as leftovers.

I LOVED this! Before serving I squeezed fresh lemon juice over the cakes. This was excellent.

Recipe was outstanding! I used leftover rotisserie chicken and substituted Dijon mustard for Tarter Sauce to give it a little flavor.

This was just ok. I made 2 batches: one with chopped chicken but the cakes fell apart while cooking and one with all the ingredients in a food processor. The second batch held together and looked more like crab cakes but they definately did not taste like crab cakes. Just sort of plain. Will not make them again.

What a fabulous recipe! Both my husband and I don't like seafood so these are a tasty alternative and a great way to use up leftover chicken. A squeeze of lemon on top before eating makes all the difference. Will be making these again for sure!!

I started to make this recipe and realized (after I shredded the chicken) that I didn't have any of the ingredients other than chicken and crackers. So I added grated parm cheese and enough tomato soup to form patties and then cooked them as directed in this recipe. My family loved it so much I made a second batch 1/2 way through dinner!

These were so good. Make sure that you shred the chicken well and you can hardly tell they are not crab. These will be a staple in our menu.

A pretty good recipe. A lot cheaper then using fresh crab. I used a rotesserie chicken from Costo and shredded really well like Jpillar suggested. Next time I will use a little least tartar sauce. Thank you Italian_Man.

Very good recipe. I printed it out quite a while ago but never seemed to get around to making it. I followed the recipe except for using 1 tablespoon fresh parsley and using plain bread crumbs seasoned with 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I had no trouble with them falling apart. I just waited until they were nicely browned on one side before gently turning them over.

I absolutely love this idea! Although I did modify the recipe just a tad after reading other reviews. I added a touch of grainy mustard with horseradish, a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and a little cayenne pepper. I actually combined some leftover chicken salad that had celery in it as well as some leftover chicken and omitted the onion only because I didn't have any... absolutely fantastic. Another suggestion is to take a little mayo, the same mustard and a little s&p and put just a dab on top. You have to try this!!!!

These were awesome! My husband had made chicken on the grill and we had 2 bone-in breasts left over the next day. Not about to waste those so I looked up "leftover chicken recipes" and stumbled upon this recipe. I took the advice from some of the previous reviews and I used a processor to get the chicken as broken down as possible. This turned out perfectly since then I didn't need to use an egg to hold it together. The mayonnaise does a good job of that. I didn't have hot sauce so just used a tablespoon of hot Pace Picante sauce. I also substituted spicy mustard in place of the tartar sauce. For the breading I used panko bread crumbs and I baked the cakes in the oven at 375 degrees for 15 minutes each side on a parchment-lined baking sheet. They ended up perfect with a fantastic crunch! I ate them plain while my husband had his on hamburger buns with a bit of bbq sauce topping. Definitely will make these again!

These tasted good like a tuna melt without the cheese but they would not stay in a patty at all. We ended up with lumps of half-breaded chicken salad. Not sure what I could have done to keep the patties together. Only taste change I might make would be to add some chopped celery for more crunch. We have some leftovers; I'll probably throw some cheddar cheese on melt in the oven and throw on a bun for lunch.

My entire family really enjoyed these. I didn't have any crackers so I used some italian bread crumbs in their place. I had cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot with some baby carrots so I mashed them into the cakes too I also used a little extra mayo (even in place of the tarter sauce) to get them good and stuck together but that was just from the other reviews. It was a great choice we loved them!

These were delicious! Fried them up for a dinner guest and we all went back for more then our guest even ate the crumbles left on the serving plate. I would double this recipe next time! We didn't have cracker crumbs so we used panko crumbs instead. This is a keeper.

Extremely good! Good flavor. Good use of leftover meat. Followed recipe exact exept for 1 thing and it only made 5 lacrosse sized ball patties if they were round.(Per other reviewers - I used Panko bread crumbs instead of crackers. I had them on hand.) My spouse said they were breaking up some. I didn't see it. There were ALOT of bread crumbs left over

This is very excellent! It tastes so good! I cut the recipe in half because I didn't have enough chicken. It made three patties. I'm buying more chicken and making more of these crabless chicken cakes!

I had left over chicken and someone reccomended this recipe. I am glad they did. I liked it alot. My kids were a little weary of eatting it. One of them did not like it. Therefore I can only give it 4 stars. I will say that I think I bought the WORST tarter sauce in history so make sure you use GOOD tarter sauce because it DOES make a difference.

This recipe was delicious!!! I finely chopped the chicken and added the egg to keep it together but i didn't put breadcrumbs and it was perfect without it. I also added cilantro for more flavor and i made the dipping sauce that was mentioned below super amazing. Best non-crabcakes ever.

These were a big hit at my house. My husband is allergic to mayo so I substituted the mayo and tartar sauce for cream cheese and ricotta and it made them really great. I also added some garlic powder and seasoned salt for a little more flavor

I made these as an appetizer for a Christmas party. I made them small and got about 30 pieces. I served them with the Remoulade sauce recipe on here. They were a big hit and disappeared quickly. I plan to make them again for dinner with larger cakes.

I completely screwed up this recipe and it was still yummy. I didn't check the pantry before I started so my cracker crumbs and bread crumbs ended up being a mixture of ritz crackers saltines and panko crumbs. I thought I had hot sauce and tarter sauce. I didn't. In the end I added Old Bay Seasoning and red pepper. I did have regular onions but used green onions just because I like them more. In any case I really liked this in it's 'raw' form and as a cooked cake. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold together well but that's not too big of a deal.

This was a very good very easy recipe; I would call them "Kosher Crab Cakes" - the addition of the tarter sauce IN the cake is what I think makes them taste like crab. I used the suggestion of the egg and I also chilled them an hour and they stayed together well. I used French's Fried Onions instead of crackers added a little green can parm cheese and fried them in peanut oil - all "out of my pantry" items served them with rice. They were moist and so very good. Highest ratings for this recipe!

This is an excellent way to use up leftover chicken. I often go to the grocery store (Publix) and get their chicken wings just to make this recipe. I brought them into work one day and now others rave about this recipe and make it also. I add more mayo rather than tartar sauce I add more hot sauce and plain bread crumbs that I season with whatever is on hand. ADD THE EGG too it holds everything together nicely. I also use fresh parsley if on hand. I serve with black eye peas and a salad. My toddler loves them.

I needed to use up some leftover crock-pot chicken and this recipe fit the bill. The flavor and texture was indeed similar to the bready type of crab cakes but without that actual crab yumminess.

This is a tasty way of using up leftovers. I HATE cassaroles! I used turkey and subbed a shake of ground red pepper instead of the hot sauce. I let the mixture sit for a few minutes so that the cracker crumbs would get moist enough to form into patties. My turkey was in big hunks and it held together fine. I popped a tablespoon of butter with the olive oil for a bit more flavor.

I had high hopes for this recipes based on the other good reviews. Sadly it was just OK. I gave it 3 stars because it was easy and a great way to use left over chicken. But there wasn't much flavor. It tasted like plain breaded chicken. I can't put my finger on what it needs maybe old bay? maybe lemon? or maybe just an awesome dipping sauce? I followed the recipe exactly.

Steamed blue crabs are my all time favorite food but it's not always crab season and I can't stand the texture of fake crab meat. You can't slap Old Bay on a chicken breast and call it crab so I was skeptical when I saw this and even more skeptical when I saw that Old Bay wasn't an ingredient. I made it because there is literally no way to get the real thing right now and I changed it a bit to reflect the crab cakes I usually make with crab so it would be a little healthier. I used Panko instead of breadcrumbs used less tartar and mayonnaise than advised added dill relish and added a few dashes of Old Bay. Despite not tasting anything like crab it held together surprisingly well and tasted amazing. It tasted so awesome that I think I'm even going to add chicken into my crab cakes during crab season so I don't have to pay for and pick quite so many crabs. I also feel like it's something I can cook for my mother who hates seafood which is definitely a plus =)

Great recipe things I did different because I didn t want to go out I used only bread crumbs instead of crackers I used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and I backed them instead of frying to reduce some calories. Overall great flavor texture and looks.

This meal turned out great! We had a crockpot chicken the night before and I used the leftovers for the cakes. I followed the recipe except I used additional mayo in place for tartar sauce and nixed the hot sauce. My bread crumbs were also Italian crumbs with some extra spice already included. Delicious!

Pretty good. I processed the chicken in my food processor so it was a good consistency. I also baked them.
