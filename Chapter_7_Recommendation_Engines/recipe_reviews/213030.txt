I could not stop eating this - it was SO good!  Left out the green onions due to personal taste and cut the amount of oil to make it a little healthier. I've never heard of "shoepeg" corn before and I found it with the other regular canned corn. I think using regular yellow corn would change the taste so find shoepeg if possible!  This might be my new "go-to" party appetizer.  LOVED it!!!! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I couldn't find black eyed peas, so I substituted black beans. I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll spice it up with with some jalapenos or chili peppers to add some heat for us.

Very healthy and delicious. Loaded with fiber and protein, but tastes wonderful. I did not have the required vinegar, so I used white wine and a little bit of white vinegar. I also doubled the spices because I'm a spice nut. Cut down Olive Oil by a little more than half. The recipe didn't need to be changed, I just did to acclimate it to our dietary needs. Simply wonderful!

I substituted basil for the cilantro, cutting it down to 1/4 cup due to personal preference. You can't understand how good this was unless you could see how distended my belly is :)

This was really good - I usually hate black eyed peas, but we've always had to eat them on NY so this year I found a way to make them go down easier!  I couldn't find shoepeg corn, so I just used regular and it worked fine.

Made according to recipe.  Was very good.  We had it as a salad for New years, and then used the leftovers as a salsa on some tacos.  Everyone liked it!

I made this for New Years and thought it was a great way to incorporate black eyed peas in a new and tasty way. It was a hit with everyone - I think I'll make this a tradition each year!

Absolutely delicious and filled with lots of flavor and healthy ingredients. I did add a can of black beans and 2 jalapeno peppers. I serve it with scoops. Will definitely be making this throughout the year! Thanks, wusz for sharing your recipe!

Good but I wanted a more avocado-y salad so next time I will double the avocados.  Also I think the spices need to be AT LEAST doubled.

I just made this and it is delicious!! I'm having a hard time waiting for the hour for it to chill to dig in! Next time I may not add quite all the dressing to be a little lighter.

Didn't use cilantro because people in the house don't like it. The only way I love black eyed peas is in this salsa! It was great! Everyone liked it even though no one looks forward to black eyed peas on New Years.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. The only change I made was I used black beans instead of black-eyed peas. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it. I would highly recommend trying this recipe!

I've made similar salsas but this was my first time using black eyed peas. I amped up the spice with a chopped Serrano pepper. This is a winner!

This was da bomb! You have to try it! Only thing I would do next time is add more cilantro and avocados.  I may even try to add some jalapenos.

I love this!  I served it as a main-dish salad for dinner, and it was a hit.  I omitted the cilantro, as we don't like it.  I think I'll add some diced jalapeno peppers next time to spice it up a bit more, and maybe some chopped cucumber. But it was delicious as is, too.

I too had never heard of shoepeg corn, but now I wouldn't want anything else, unless of course I was strapped, it'd still be good with other types of corn.  You could really substitute any bean or veggie, the red wine vinegar dressing is where it's at! This will be my third new years making this, not to mention other time throughout! Enjoy

Great recipe. First dish to be devoured at our NYE party. Shoepeg corn is just a smaller kernel, white sweet corn.  
My grocer doesn't stock shoepeg, so  I chose Del Monte Gold & White Super Sweet canned corn as a substitute.

Love this.  Add some minced jalepeno for a little more kick and I double the recipe because it's gone so quickly.  Great for NY for the black eyed pea haters.  Being vegan too is always a bonus :)

Love how different this is from any other salsa out there, and everyone at the party raved so it's a definite keeper!  I did omit green onion, reduce cilantro and olive oil based on personal preferences, but I don't think it changed the overall idea of the salsa.

This is an amazing, flavorful, delicious dish, and after the first couple of bites, I discarded my chips and dug in with a fork. SOOOO good.

Made this for New Year's Day Party as it is a tradition in my husband's family to have black eyed peas on new year's.  So good!  Everyone loved it.  Will probably use this every New Years going forward & a few times during the year too!

This has become a favorite in our household. I found it because I was looking for a good black eyed pea recipe for the New Year (black-eyed peas for good luck).  Its great. We take it to Super Bowl parties. Its a great side with a spicy chili because its more cooling but very flavorful

I've made this so many times since New Year's - it's fabulous!  Even my mother (who's always choked down her teaspoon of black-eyed peas on New Year's Day loves this).  The only changes I makes are halving the liquids.

Delish!  This is a great recipe & you  can make it your own by adding your favorite spices and veggie /bean combos.  I omitted the oil, added diced jalapeno, red onion, chili powder, fresh minced garlic & the juice of 1/2 lime.  I always let my set up for 24 hours.

This was excellent, and I don't really like black eye peas.  I couldn't find shoe peg corn so I substitute yellow corn.  It was really good.  I'm going to try this recipe with black beans the next time.

I made this for a New Year's Eve Party. I was surprised how much there was. It all was eaten. Everybody loved it and I was asked to bring it to our next gathering! The only change I made was I used organic frozen corn. (It needs to be organic to avoid GMOs) and I added half a jalapeno.

Used less cilantro and added small yellow, red and orange peppers.  Loved it along with others who I shared New Years Day dinner.  I doubled recipe and it was devoured by the 7 of us.

This is an awesome recipe! I have made it exactly as is multiple times and every time people rave about it and it is always all gone (even if I double the recipe)!! It also keeps very well overnight so can make ahead.  It is not spicy at all but for those who would rather have spice you could easily add some fresh jalapeño for that extra kick.

Finally found a way to eat black eyed peas for New Year's Day  that I actually enjoyed!  Very tasty as written but may add something (jalapeños maybe)  to spice it up a little next time.

Great recipe! Made this for New Years and daughter and husband love it. I added a extra can of black eye peas that I drained and rinsed. I used 1 small lemon on the cut  avocado. Since we do not like cilantro I substituted fresh parsley. Served with Scoops! Yummy!

I've made this at least ten times!  Delicious. This recipe stands alone, but I did make some changes.  Added a can of black beans and two tablespoons lime juice.  I also used Rice Wine instead of the Red Wine.  I added northern beans once and it was also delicious.  Can't go wrong with this salsa - on chicken, on scoops, on a spoon………..

Great summer recipe. It was a wee bit bland for my taste, so I doubled the cumin and garlic and added some chipotle for a little heat. Next time I think I'll use lime juice instead of vinegar.

We made it for the Super Bowl Party and everybody loved it.
We too, thought it needed a bit more spice so we added a minced Chipotle Pepper that we happened to have for the Chipotle Mayo we were making for Salmon Sliders.

I'm not a big fan of cilantro so used only a small amount.  I coked my own black eyed peas.  This recipe is really, really good.

This is amazing. I will use this again.   It was tasty before I put the liquid dressing on it .
