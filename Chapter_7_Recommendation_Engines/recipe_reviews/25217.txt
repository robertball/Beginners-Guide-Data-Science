These are delicious, cake-like waffles.  They didn't get crisp for me until they cooled off and sat for a few minutes.  I substituted 6 tablespoons cocoa and 2 tablespoons oil for the two squares of chocolate since I didn't have any on hand.  A great recipe for dessert waffles!

The sugar and butter listed as ingredients do not appear to have been needed afterall in the recipe.  I was looking forward to having these this morning, but was not able to determine at what point I was to have added either.

You know those foods that aren't really good for you but they taste good?  This is one of them! These aren't your grandma's waffles! These waffles were SO different I knew I had to try them. I actually used semi sweet mini chocolate chips b/c they would melt quicker.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe - but please note they will NOT get crisp from the waffle iron, but once they are plated they will. This recipe has great potential if you're the type to play w/ recipes ;) A quick swap to white chocolate chips, and some fresh raspberries, or if you want 60% cacao chips and mandarin oranges - the combinations are endless :)  Thanks to allrecipes for correcting the info ;)

way to soft of a batter.  It's like making a cake in your wafflemaker and is really messy.

Made them as a special breakfast for the kids. None of them liked the chocolate and begged me to make my regular recipe. I tried one and I have to agree. They are okay but nothing really yummy.

I think I changed this recipe so much that it's not the same, but I substituted sour cream for half the butter, used a tbsp of cocoa instead of melting the chocolate, used 1/2 cup of sugar (and should have used less), and ended up using 1 c flour with closer to 3/4 c milk.  The result was delicious, but could have been fluffier.  I served it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.

This is not a good waffle batter. I would say go with a regular waffle batter and just add some extra butter and chocolate. I would ever recommend using this recipe.

It was great! I used half the butter with better results.
