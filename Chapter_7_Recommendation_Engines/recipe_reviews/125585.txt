VERY easy and very good!  I used white wine vinegar since I couldn't find white balsamic, and it was still great.  I would love to try it with the balsamic next time.  This recipe gives you LOTS of cheese and pecans- I will probably not use quite as much next time.  You'll also have plenty of leftover dressing.  I received several compliments on this pretty and yummy salad!

Excellent Salad. I took it to a potluck where it was a huge it.  Now, all my friends are asking me when I'll be serving my "Restaurant" salad again!  I don't like Swiss or Feta, so I substituted crumbled cheddar and shredded colby jack cheeses.  I found the white balsamic vinegar near all the salad dressings in my grocery store. :)

This salad was amazing! I made it for Easter dinner for 15 people and everyone ate it and thoroughly enjoyed!! I switched out the cubed Swiss for cubed Monterey Jack and added a little bit of sugar to the dressing just to tone down the slight bitterness. The salad came out perfect, was super easy, and a super hit.

The large amount of dressing this recipe makes is not an issue, you just don't add it all to the salad at once! After I tossed the salad, I added just enough dressing to coat lightly and refridgerated the rest for the next day! I would not decrease the spices at all, it was fine the way it was. Delicious salad!

I really enjoyed this, my mom loved it! However, I did make some changes which is why I gave it 4 stars. Like others, I agree the dressing proportions were off. I cut the pepper down alot and only made half the dressing, which was the perfect amount. Subbed Monteray Jack for swiss, because thats what I had. Also added some thinly sliced red onion and green apple. YUM! Quick and refreshing. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Great salad.  Very tasty and refreshing.  I didn't have feta so I used blue cheese and it was wonderful!  Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty. Even my husband ate all of his. And he is a meat and potatoes man, not much into other veggies or salad. He even said it was "pretty good".  I used green leaf lettuce, and only had dark balsamic vinegar. The cheese tended to stay at the bottom of the bowl due to gravity and didn't really "mix" with the lettuce pieces. Nice dressing, but was more than enough and I could have gotten by with less. Thanks for the great recipe. I will fix this again. It was good.

GREAT SALAD!  I do a meal once a quarter for our church.  I made this salad and served it with Bacon Wrapped Chicken.  The MEN were coming into the kitchen and telling me what a good salad it was.  Whatever you do don't leave out the pecans.  They make the salad.

Delish!  I used pine nuts instead of pecans.  Very versatile salad.  It would be great with chicken or the addition of apples or dried cranberries.

We liked this one!  I realize the title of this recipe indicates that this is a “green” salad, however I had some little grape tomatoes that I needed to use up, so I threw them in.  I thought they added great color and complimented the other ingredients nicely.  I also thought the amount of cheese was excessive, so I cut back to about two tablespoons of each.  The dressing was ok, but I think there are better balsamic dressings out there.  I’d make this again, but use a different dressing.

I made this last night to go with some steaks we cooked on the grill. I used sliced swiss cheese which I cut into small pieces. I also used red balsamic vinegar, since I did not have white. The response from my husband was "This is one of the best salads you have made. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making this again!

This has great potential but, imo, the proportions are way off - way too much dressing for a start, and one tbsp of pepper? One tbsp of Italian seasoning? Seriously? I cut way back, and it turned out great! I loved the contrast of the sweet white balsamic with the salty tangy Feta. Next time I'll add some red onion. Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  When I first read it I thought "what's the big deal?" but when we ate it it was terrific.  I used good feta and fresh parmesan and substituted colby/jack for the swiss.  My mom was eating it without the dressing and asked me what kind of dressing it was because it was great.  I used regular good balsamic because I didn't have any white balsamic.  Served it with Firecracker Salmon for Father's Day and it went over great!

Great salad. My company just loved it and finished off the whole bowl. I used a bag of crumbled cheddar, colby, and monteray jack cheese. Delicious!!!!!! I will definitely make this again and again.

This was so good! I loved it! I could not find white balsamic vinegar at my grocery store, so used dark. While not as pretty, it was still very tasty. I think I'd like to experiment with this a little and try using half fresh spinach and half lettuce. The dressing as is was a little too tart for my taste, so I added about 2 tsp of sugar. Perfect. I also had to use different cheese. We don't like swiss so I used monteray jack, our finances do not call for feta right now (which I'm sure is excellent because I LOVE feta) so I crumbled up some cheddar, and I couldn't find shredded parmesan so I used an Italian cheese blend.

Wow! Excellent way to spruce up a boring old salad! I made this salad for a adult birthday party and I didn't have a lot of time to prepare.  It was fast, easy, and very tasty.  Everyone raved about the combination of cheeses.  Thanks!!

Great easy party salad! Very versatile and you can use so many different greens, cheeses and salad dressings. I like white citrus or cilantro avocado drizzled on it. I added cherry tomatoes and also used bourbon vanilla pecans once and they were a hit. Have served with pretzel crisps or sesame sticks.

I made this but must admit to having used my lemon olive oil and some lemon balsamic vinegar.  I thought it was very good with all the ingredients called for, but it would even be better with some added tomatoes and onion.  I have a little dressing left over, and that's just fine with me!  The thing I love about recipes like this is that you can add or subtract anything but it's always the dressing that makes the salad.  I gave this a 4 because I do think that my olive oil and lemon balsamic vinegar added a lot to the dressing.  I really appreciate this recipe!

The salad was good but the dressing was to tart or sour.  I used balsamic vinegar as the recipe said.  If I made it again I would try another vinegar or use less of it in the recipe.

I substitued munster cheese for the swiss cheese, otherwise made the same as the recipe.  It seemed that the pepper (1T) was way too much for the dressing.  That is all I could taste in the dressing, and I like pepper normally but it was too much for me.  The dressing could also be cut down dramatically, there was a lot left over and too much peper to enjoy at another time.
