I have to admit, I blindly made this recipe, going only on the reviews and wondering what such an odd pairing of ingredients would bring.  I am so glad I did!  These meatballs were delicious and I got a number of, "Can I get this recipe?" requests from my party guests!

I found this recipe before I catered an event for 300 people.  I tried it on my family first and they loved it.  So I made it for the event.  They were a hit!  Everyone loved them.  They were easy to make and increasing the quantity was easy.  I have already given this recipe out to tons of people who have asked for it.  I would recommend it to anyone.

These are excellent!  Humorously enough, I got it mixed up when I was at the store, and bought grape jelly and apple juice.  I thought, what the heck and gave it a try.  It was very good!  And less costly, because I can get store brands of each of those.  I made a double recipe, and it was just enough for my 4 quart crock pot full of Costco meatballs.  I also added several shakes of cayenne (tabasco type) sauce.  It gave it just a bit of spice, which mixed wonderfully with the sweet of the sauce, and the vinegar in the pepper sauce added just a bit of tang.  This recipe is a keeper!

I used the concept of this recipe and made it my own. Used apricot pineapple preserves, 18oz. found at Walmart Supercenters, also great for meatloaf. Used peach juice. Used 2 cans of the tomato sauce with seasonings. Added ketchup and worcestershire sauce. Cooked on high for 4 plus hours. Will make again as I am sure it will be asked for!

Made these for a superbowl party LIKE 8 MONTHS AGO...made them again for a party last weekend and before people even started eating them, they said "OH MY GOD, ARE THESE THE SAME MEATBALLS YOU MADE FOR THE SUPERBOWL PARTY??!!"  It felt pretty good that they remembered the meatballs from 8 months ago!! :)

This is a good recipe, but I also add 1 1/14 cup of worcestershire sauce also.  When I made it as is the recipe was too sweet.  After the worcestershire sauce I got so many more compliments and they go really fast.

Really easy to make. The 1st time I made it I followed the directions as stated. The taste of the sauce is okay as the recipe goes, but I added a few things to mine the 2nd time I made it. I included about 3/4 cup Worcester sauce, a couple dashes of Tabasco, and about a 1/3 of a cup of regular bbq sauce. We enjoyed the flavor of the sauce with my additions.

Simply AWESOME.  I made these for a culture fair, and I was representing Italy, and I didn't have the time or money to make my mothers meatballs and sauce, so I tried these.  They're not authentic Italian...But they still disappeared just the same.  I had 5 lbs of meatballs, so I added half a cup more of everything, and it was superb.  Thanks for sharing!

great - I made for a party and I thought I had way too many meatballs but every last one went.  I did had a few dashes of hot pepper sauce when I was boiling on the stove.

Really Great, made the first time with mamalade and apple juice, not having the grape juice or apple jelly.  Made the 2nd time with the grape juice, and marmalade, (still forgot to buy the apple jelly!), rest of the ingredients the same.  I served as a dinner over linguine or fettucini, so would go further.  Third time, made exactly like the recipe says, and PLANNED to serve over rice, but my Grown Son came over and kept eating them out of the crock pot before I could get the rice made! They are SO awesome, and just as good each time, which helps when you aren't organized to be able to follow exactly.  Some time I will have to try them as appetizers for a potluck, I'm sure they'll go just as fast as everyone says.  Thanks for a really big keeper Recipe!!

Eh. I have an even better recipe with only 3 ingredients. Equal parts grape jelly and barbeque sauce with pre-made meatballs. I never have any left at gatherings, Superbowl parties, etc. DELICIOUS and couldn't be faser/eaiser.

Loved this recipe and it went over big at the party I took them to.  It's quick, easy and delicious!  It's also interchangeable as I did not have apple jelly on hand.  The Polaner's all fruit apricot flavor that I used worked great.  I know I already said it's QUICK & EASY but I want to emphasize that again!.....especially since I skipped step one.  I DID NOT heat the sauce in a pan first.  I just threw it all in the crock pot.  Thanks so much Janet!!

Yummy.  I used apricot preserves in lieu of apple jelly.  So good at the party, and then on meatball sandwiches the next day.  And easy, too!

These weren't bad at all!  I used grape jelly and apple juice since I couldn't find apple jelly.  I was very hesitant to try this recipe because all the ingredients are a very ODD pairing, but the taste is delightful.  For our family of 4, I used one 2 pound bag of Foster Farms Homestyle Turkey Meatballs (from Super Wal-Mart).  I still used the original measurements for the other ingredients because I wanted to make sure I had lots of sauce to cover the meatballs and there was more than enough.  This will be a great potluck recipe.  For that, I will use two bags of the turkey meatballs and double the other ingredients.  I like this recipe better than the regular BBQ meatballs that some folks make.  It's a nice change.  Thanks!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  The only thing I did differently was to add everything in the crockpot without boiling first and I added a little more of each liquid so that the sauce would cover the meatballs in my crock pot.  These are for today's superbowl party at my house and now I wish I had made more just so I can be sure to have leftovers for tomorrow.

These were good.  I felt like they could have been a little better.  I will make them again and maybe add something else or more of something.  I served them as "eyeballs" at our Halloween party.  We did have several left over so I'm not sure if people thought the same way I did about them.  There weren't much leftovers of the other foods we had.

Awesome! Made just like my grandma did back when I was growing up. Took them to two different events around Christmas, and they were gone within 15 minutes! My crock pot was too small so I did this on the stove, and they turned out great. Just heated them over low heat until the meatballs were heated through. DELICIOUS!

Made these for a Christmas party based strictly on the high reviews. The combination for the sauce sounded weird to me.  They turned out great.  Everybody loved them!  This will definitely be a party staple from now on.

Made these for a pot luck and they were gone in no time. SUPER easy ingredients...wish the sauce was a bit thicker so more would stick to the balls, but fun easy great crowd pleasing taste.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe! I actually got it out of one of Taste of Home's cookbooks. Every time I make these they disappear before I can even get one! I'm almost embarrassed to tell people how easy they are. The only change I make is using apricot jelly instead of apple, but that's only b/c I can't find apple jelly at the store by my house. HIGHLY recommend using the Italian style meatballs from Costco!

Made these to bring to a pot luck holiday party - HUGE hit.  They were super easy to make up, I stuck them on a platter with a container of toothpicks, and all that was left to do at the end was to grab the dirty platter - not one left!

I made these meatballs for a Thanksgiving appetizer and they were a huge hit!  I did add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce as others suggested.  My mom, who doesn't typically like meatballs, raved about them.  She told me I have a new responsibility for Christmas dinner!  I am a vegetarian, so it can be difficult to make meat dishes, as I can't taste them before I serve them to make sure it's ok, but this was very easy and a big hit in my house!

Nothing special.  I gave it 4 stars because it is easy and because everyone liked it. There wasn't a "wow" factor so couldn't give 5.  Will probably make again because all ingredietns are very easy to have on hand.

Wowee!  These were SO yummy.  I had to make a few tiny changes-I had grape jelly on hand already, so I just bought some apple juice, and I don't think it really changed the taste too much I'm sure.  I did everything else exactly the same (except made the proportions much less to feed my little family).  Me and my hubby are dieting, but I just had to break mine and have seconds of this!  We had it over rice, and the sauce over the rice was just divine.  I HIGHLY recommend putting this over rice.  My 3yo and 11 mo old gobbled these meatballs up!  I lost count how many each of them ate!  Thanks for the wonderful (and very easy!) recipe!  Oh I forgot I did add a tiny bit of hot sauce, but I'm not sure if it was enough to alter the taste a whole lot-I was afraid to put too much in and have the kids not like it, haha.

This recipe was surprisingly good.  I thought the combination of flavors would be quite weird but this had just the right amount of sweet and savory.  I tried them out at home before serving them to 20 people at Christmas.  I am definitely going to have them on my buffet table this year.

I wanted to make these, but didn't have all of the ingredients so I improvised.  They turned out fantastic and everyone loved them!  I used apple juice instead of grape juice and peach preserves instead of apple jelly.  As long as you are substituting a fruit for a fruit, I doubt you can go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks so much for an absolutely amazing recipe!

These were easy and tasty. My guests and my husband LOVED them. I used frozen Mama Mia Italian meatballs for the recipe. Because my supermarket did not carry apple jelly (can you believe that?!?) I used grape jelly and apple juice. I have a hunch they would have been even better using apple jelly and grape juice, as the grape juice would have added intensity. These were great the next day as meatball sandwiches on rolls! The sauce is similar to a sweet BBQ sauce.

These meatballs were a big hit a Xmas!  Easy to make, made my own meatballs as I am not a fan of frozen ones.  Used grape jelly and apple juice as one of the other reviews advised and it turned out great and much easier to find in the store.  Thanks for sharing

I bought a double crock pot a while ago and have been dying to use it. Finally got my chance this weekend at my sister's baby shower.  I made these meatballs and they were a hit! The ingredients were a little odd but they mesh together well. Will make them again.....and again. Now one of my favorites.

This is super easy and super good.  My meatballs are always the first thing gone at a potluck.  Make a double batch and refrigerate it for next time.  If you need this to be done quicker, thaw the meatballs in the microwave then simmer in the sauce as long as possible - the longer you simmer, the more the sauce soaks in.  However, I find that more than 3-4 hours in the crockpot (as one reviewer did) makes the meatballs soggy.

I loved this recipe, but had to make additional sauce so all of the meatballs in the crock pot would be covered in liquid while cooking.  A lot depends on the meatballs.  The 1st time I used pre-made frozen ones and the 2nd time I used my own meatballs.  What a difference hand made meatballs made!

I LOVE this recipe!  I made it for my twins first birthday party and it was a true hit!  The recipe makes lots so I had enough for the next day which I served over rice.  No one asked me for the recipe because I was too busy reciting it to everyone who was trying them!  The flavour is really good too - and the ingredients were super easy to find!

This is my go to party recipe. I have made it several times and never had leftovers. Everyone loves this. I have added Worstershire before and that gives it a little more kick, but it is fine without too.

This recipe got rave reviews and my Christmas party this weekend.  4 lbs of meatballs gone by the end of the night.  I used a little barbeque sauce and some cayenne pepper to spice it up a little bit but it's a hit either way.  This was my second time making it.

I made this recipe for a birthday party and everyone enjoyed the meatballs. I will definately make again, but I will not use frozen meatballs. The frozen meatballs ended up too soggy for my taste.

Every time I make this, my guests always comment about how AMAZING these are!  I love how easy they are to make with ingredients you would usually have on hand.  The only change I make is that I use apple juice and grape jelly vs. apple jelly and grape juice because those ingredients are easier to find.

This was a HUGE hit at the party.   I doubled the recipe (got frozen meatballs on sale) and all of it disappeared.  Next time, though, I'll make the meatballs myself to save on the salt content.  Flavors were outstanding, but the sodium content was pretty high.

These meatballs were good but not great.  I thought they were a little too sweet.  My BF didn't really care for them at all but he does prefer gravy than a BBQ-y type sauce.  I don't know if I would make these again.

I made these Meatballs for my daughter's Graduation Party and they were a big hit. I used grape jelly and apple juice. This is going to be a recipe I will use time and time again.

I made this recipe last night to try it out.  It was very easily put together.  I didn't change anything but lowered the serving size for my just over 1lb of meatballs I had in my freezer.  It came out delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I love anything I can throw in a crock-pot.

Brought these to a work potluck for about 50 people and they all went. I took the recommendation of another member and added some red cayenne powder and that definitely added a great spice/flavor to it. I also recommend using the lowest fat meatballs you can find or turkey meatballs.  The first time I made them with turkey meatballs and the sauce was perfect. The second time I used regular frozen italian meatballs and the sauce became very thin and had a layer of fat/oil on it. But they were still awesome!

I must admit I was skeptical about these at first.  I wanted a meatball recipe for my daughters' graduation open house, so I decided this would have to do.  AMAZING!!  These were a HUGE hit, and everyone was asking for the recipe!  (You should have seen the eyebrows raise when they heard what was in them.)  This truly is a stroke of genius!

These were really yummy and people were really surprised when they asked what was in them and I told them.  Strangely some people thought I added chili pepper to them because something in the sauce brought out some kick in the Costco meatballs I used but not really spicy, just a little kick.  I did not have to throw any away and they were gobbled up.

Instead of ketchup, I use a mix of half BBQ sauce and half chili sauce. I also omit the tomato sauce. This is even better with your own homemade meatballs.

This is a very easy recipe and does well for a large crowd. We also added a few shakes of "Texas Pete's" hot pepper sauce which definitely added some punch (and is a little less powerful than Tobasco).  Without that addition, these would have been a little too basic, but otherwise it's a great recipe!

This recipe was ok.  The sauce on it's own was too sweet for my taste.  I added a cup of hot and spicy bbq sauce and red pepper flakes.  The meatballs were delicious after I added these ingredients.

I don't think I'll be making this one again.  It was okay but not a big hit, as seemed to be lacking some sort of 'zest'.  Other reviewers added ingredients to jazz this up, such as barbeque sauce or hot pepper sauce... I think this recipe is lacking that one ingredient to spice it up.
