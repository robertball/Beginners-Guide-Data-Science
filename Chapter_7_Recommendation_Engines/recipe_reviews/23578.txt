This was a hit at Christmas!  I didn't want to steam a plum pudding for hours, so I went this recipe and it turned out like a French toast casserole. I put in dried cherries and chopped up some dried apricots because currants weren't available and I drizzled a hard sauce over each serving.  EVeryone had seconds and there was none left at the end of the night... always a good sign.

This was fantastic! We doubled the recipe because we had a big group and put it into a 9x13 and it worked perfectly, baked it for 40 minutes and it was done.  I also forgot to buy the currants, so we used 3 cups of golden raisins and it was a nice amount. I think what really made it though was the bread.  I bought a loaf of a dense European style (harder crust, denser middle) French bread and then tore it by hand instead of cutting regular bread into cubes.  A number of us decided that the choice of bread had a large impact.  We served it with a vanilla sauce and there was none left at all. One of my friends described it as "it's like bread pudding, but it's so much better than bread pudding". Will make again. Thanks!
