Good recipe.  I used only all-purpose flour, as I didn't have wheat flour, and it turned out fine.  Baked mini-loaves instead of two regular sized.  If you do that, you'll need to cut baking time from 70 minutes to about 40 minutes or so.  Keep checking frequently once you've hit 35 minutes to make sure the sides don't burn.

We LOVE this bread. I didn't use whole wheat flour, because I didn't have any, and I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used a 1/2 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of applesauce--and it turned out great. So moist and apple-y. Next time I will add a 1/2 tsp or so of allspice to make it taste even more like apple pie. And I may toast the walnuts, too.

We loved this bread & it didn't last very long. Although I would suggest chopping the apples not too fine.

Excellent bread and healthy. Used also 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup of oil. Decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cup and the salt to 3/4 teaspoon. All my friends wanted the recipe! Thank you.

This bread is moist, apply, nutty, and yummy.  It improved a lot after a day or two.  I followed the suggestions to use half whole wheat and half white flour, and half oil and half applesauce. My cooking time was 60 minutes at 300 degrees.  A recipe worth saving, thanks!

This was very good; but I baked it at 350 (I've never baked a quick bread at 300)and the baking time was much less than stated - more like 50-55 min. - Oh and I also used 1/2 cup applesauce and modified the oil accordingly. Everybody loved it.

I took the suggestion to go 1/2 & 1/2 on the oil and applesauce and I used all-purpose white flour only.  It took 70 minutes to cook.  

This came out so moist & yummy.  I am making more to give as Chirstmas gifts at the office.

Great recipe!  I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil instead of the other way around.  Also I added 2 tsps of flax seed meal for extra fiber.  Absolutely delicious!

This was a fantastic bread. It was so good, and it did not last a full day in our house.  The changes I made were the following: I used spelt flour instead of whole wheat. I used equal parts oil and applesauce. I chopped the apples into chunks and used a heaping cup of walnuts.  This is a keeper - so simple and very delicious.

Pretty good bread- I liked how it included whole wheat flour.  Like a lot of reviewers, I used 1/2 cup applesauce adn 1/2 cup oil.  Used McIntosh apples.  Added a little extra cinnamon.  I baked it for less time than stated.  Drizzled with a glaze made from a few TBS. cream and 1 cup powdered sugar.

lovely bread; very moist.  Had to make some modifications because as I was making this, realized only had 1 large gala apple so also chopped up carrots and added half a tangerine peel.  Threw the apple, carrot, and peel into my food processor and that made it extra easy.  Left the skin on the apple, as I like the red bits of color.  Omitted nuts and used a 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup choc. chips (choc. complimented the tangerine flavor well).  Made 1 8 in loaf and 3 mini loaves. Used 1 cup white and 3/4 brown sugar for a darker richer loaf. Added 1/2 tsp. each nutmeg and cardamom.  Also used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  *May need to add a little extra spice if you don't like things too bland.  The spice additions were not overpowering but complimented the other flavors nicely.  Great way for me to clean out my refrigerator crisper!!  Baked for 50 minutes in my oven.  A keeper recipe and because it makes a thicker batter, nuts or raisins, or the chips won't sink to the bottom.

I thought that the Apple Walnut Bread was delicious!  It was moist and I loved the walnut in it.  The only thing that I did different from the recipe was that I did half and half with the applesauce and oil.  I used a half cup of oil and half cup of applesauce.  Came out great!  Thought 1 cup of oil was too much, would have made it oily.

This bread is soooo good! A new favorite in my family! I used pecans because I didn't have any walnuts,  and 3/4 cups apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the other way around, to make it a bit healthier, very moist and sweet!

Followed the directions as a base. Used half and half applesauce and oil, doubled the cinnamon, added 1/3 teaspoon of cloves and some fresh grated nutmeg, and the zest and juice of 2 tangerines. Baked for 50 minutes at 350. Makes 2 loaves and it was delicious. We have 18 apple trees, this recipe is going to be a keeper! Took a loaf to a friend's house and the 6 of us ate the entire loaf with lunch, LOL.

I used to think that only experienced grandmothers and bakers could make cakes and breads... but I'm doing just fine despite my youthful perceptions, thanks. This is marvelous. I used granny apples because I wanted a bit more tartness since my Apple Coffee Cake. The recipe directions were spot on which is so sweet.. this is a delicious apple walnut bread

This bread is so Yummy!! 2 loaves don't last a day in my house!! The last time I made it, I used 1/2 cup each of canola oil and applesauce, 1 1/2 cups each of the all purpose flour and whole wheat flour, and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla. Came out perfect!

I also tried this recipe omitting the walnuts and substituting blueberries for the apples, very, very yummy!!!

Amazing & so simple.  I used 1/2 c of oil & 1/2 c of apple sauce, and all purpose flour, and it came out great!  I made four small loaves in my Pampered Chef stoneware and baked it for 55 min. @ 300 degrees.  Very moist!

This bread is great.  I chose canola oil myself and omitted the applesauce (b/c I didn't have any) and it turned out just fine.  Baked in 8x8 cake pan for 40 mins @ 350 - just felt like it!

This was really great bread. The only complaint I have is the cooking time. Luckily I read the reviews before following this recipe and thanks to Nansters and Carolina, I cooked it for 40 minutes. Wendy must have a really cool oven because any longer and mine would have become hard and burned.

I liked this recipe. I didn't use wheat flour because I didn't have any, so I substituted it for all-purpose. I added fresh nutmeg and instead of using 3/4 cups of oil I used 1/4 cups and replaced it with the applesauce! Very moist. However, if I were to make it again I would try shredding the apples instead of chopping them, just for aesthetic purposes.

Yum yum.  I made the recipe in a 10 inch tube pan and had to bake mine an extra 10 minutes.  It doesn't rise much and the batter was pretty thick too.  My apples didn't disappear in the bread because I left them chunky.  I only added a little nutmeg in with the cinnamon.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Loved this recipe. I made it using the 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce ration mentioned in previous reviews. I made this bread to take with the family on a camping trip. The extra bread that we came home with I used to make French Toast ... so yummy.

This was excellent! Could not stop eating it! I used honey crisp apples, so I cut back on the sugar. I also used a rose shaped bunt pan and it came out great!

Excellent bread! Following past reviews, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce (convenient because I used a lunch pack of applesauce, which is 1/2 cup). Also added about 1/2 tsp allspice. It got rave reviews.

I have been making this for years.  As many other reviewers have suggested, I use 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 applesauce.    I also use pecans instead of walnuts because that's usually what I have around.  Everything else I do as recipe indicates. Always turns out very moist.   I always get raving compliments wherever I take it.

This is just what I was looking for, yum! I think it uses a good ratio of AP to WW flour, to get some texture and substance (and health boost) from the WW without being dry or too dense.
Used 3 good sized Granny Smith apples, I like their tartness! Used 1/2c melted butter and 1/2c apple butter instead of the oil and applesauce. The apple butter had added sugar, so I cut down the white sugar in the recipe. It also added some extra spice and flavor that I think was great. On top of that, I added some extra cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. Not quite enough to call it an apple spice cake, but enough to make it interesting.
The batter is super thick, and it was a bit of a job to fold all the apples and nuts in, but don't be deterred, it came out great!

Everyone loved this recipe so much, I ended up having to make 8 loaves to satisfy the demand! I also cut the oil back to 1/2 cup and increased the applesauce to 1/2 and it was perfect.

I love this recipe! I have made this a couple times and didn't have apple sauce either time, so added fruit juice to the apple mixture with a 1/4 tsp extra cinnamon, then added all of the liquid stuff to that before adding the flour mixture. This time I used 1/2 cup juice from canned mandarin oranges, last time I think it was canned peach juice and I added it to the batter at the end so I'd know how much liquid it needed. Made walnuts optional. I made a dozen muffins from the batter first, which needed to be baked about 30-40 minutes at 325-350, depending on oven accuracy. The rest of the batter went into a bread pan and baked about 70 minutes.

I had to log in this morning to rate this because it is SO GOOD. It's got an amazing crust on all sides--nice and crackly. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and probably more apples because I have so many to use up, but other than that stuck to the recipe. So good.

Good bread. I can't eat walnuts, so instead i added about a cup of fresh blueberries. I also used all apple sauce, and no oil, and didn't use wheat flour because I don't have any. I also used about 1/2 the amount of cinnamon and 1/2 ground nutmeg. Overall, it was very good and I"ll add it to my recipe book. One complaint, and this might be a personal preference because it seems all my breads come out this way, it was a bit too sticky and moist for me. I like breads I dont have to remove the sticky residue from my finger each time I touch it.

This was a great way to use up a bunch of apples I had in the fridge.  I followed others' suggestions of cutting back on the oil and increasing the apple sauce.  I also substituted half of the sugar for splenda.  I baked it at 350 and it took 50 minutes.  It turned out very well.

This is awesome! I reversed the amounts of oil and applesauce, and used homemade applesauce. It was very moist and delicious! I made a double batch, so I added some dried cranberries and made muffins with the extra batter.

I LOVE this recipe! It's moist and flavorful.  I used no oil and baked as mini loaves for a gift basket.  Smelled like heaven when baking, so I could barely contain myself when they came out of the oven. So worth peeling all those apples!!

Very moist bread which got even better the next day.  I made a regular size loaf and 7 mini loaves.  I like baking the mini loaves better due to the decreased baking time (30 minutes).  While they were cooking, my mom kept asking if they were done (a big compliment to me)!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written and the bread was amazing! With the second batch I made some changes even though this recipe is fantastic as written. I fried the apple chunks and dried pineapple chunks in butter and sugar until slightly caramelized; I soaked raisins in warm apple cider until soft; added more cinnamon and a 1/2 cup of homemade buttermilk. I baked the batter in a Bundt pan for 60 min. While still warm I cut several slices and slathered them with soft butter and topped that with sprinkles of turbinado sugar. Lol, I know this defeats the purpose of eating this healthy bread but we're all a bunch of pigs here at my house...oink.

I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used white flour.  Cooking time was 70 minutes.  The flavor was just ok.  It needed at least triple the spices, b/c I had already doubled them, and added apple pie spice too.  I'm not sure I liked the texture, it wasn't very bread-like.  It was extremely dense.  I also used 1/4C of oil and 3/4C of applesauce.  While I know I didn't go EXACTLY to recipe, the gist of it was not overly impressive.  My husband's mother makes an EXTREMELY similar recipe, so I used this one instead and the reviewers' tips.  I will probably try to find something a bit more impressive.

A great recipe. I make several batches when apples are in season and freeze them. Very moist and a nice flavor.

I was really looking forward to this great-sounding bread.  I did add more cinnamon and nutmeg and added raisins.  I found the taste was very good, but the bread was dry.  I'm sure my oven probably bakes faster, because every other review claimed a moist bread.  I will tent with foil next time.

Decreased oil to 2/3 cup. Increased apple sauce to 1/2 cup. Decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Used 3 apples vs 3 cups of apples. Great!

A tasty, healthy alternative. Very moist.  Not so "attractive" to set out for guests though.

This tastes much better the next day, when the flavours have had a chance to mingle a bit.  I didn't think this was very appley, but I used an apple I didn't really care for to begin with.

I've made this several times and much of those for my daughter's Montessorri class.  We have some food allergies so I leave out the nuts and use Ener-G egg replacer and this is just fabulous!! thanks!
