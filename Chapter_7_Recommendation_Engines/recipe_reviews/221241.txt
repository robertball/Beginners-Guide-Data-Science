Made half of this recipe so it would fit into my Cuisinart ice cream machine. Twenty-five minutes later I had creamy almond-flavored ice cream with perfect texture. I might cut back just a little next time on the almond extract but that's a personal taste preference. Thanks for sharing enjoyed this ice cream.

I used this in my cuisinart 2 quart ice cream maker. Liquid ingredients first used stevia instead of sugar. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup almond slivers in the last 5 minutes of freezing. Yum Yummy!

Wonderful all by itself but even better with a smashed up Butterfinger in it:-) I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 3 cups of half and half instead of the cream and milk. Came out wonderfully delicious!
