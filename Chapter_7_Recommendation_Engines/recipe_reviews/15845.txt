I scaled this recipe down to 2/3 since I only had 6.5 oz cans of mushrooms.  Furthermore, instead of garlic and seasoning salts I used salt, garlic powder, onion powder, dried ground thyme, dried dill weed, celery ceed, and mustard - each about 1/8 teaspoon, but more of the salt.  I feel that using seasoning salt, which contains msg and unhealthy preservatives is defeating the point of marinating something myself.  I would have given the recipe 5 stars otherwise.

After making and trying these, I have to tell you this is nothing more than a salt delivery device.  Now if eating liquid salt is your thing, then this recipe is for you, otherwise, I would pass on it as they were really quite bad.  These rate no stars at all, but you have to give them at least one to write the review, so I gave it the one out of no choice of my own.

This was a great and easy recipe, which allows for variations. I used balsamic vinegar, because it adds a nice color and doesn't have such a strong bite like white vinegar. Also, I added fresh pressed garlic and basil, and simmered the whole mixture for a few minutes to infuse the flavors before I set aside. Also, I only marinated these for 12 hours, not over night.

DID NOT LIKE THEM AT ALL.  Too salty, too much vinegar.  Not good!

I LOVED these mushrooms! I had to laugh at the huge range of opinions on these.  Personally, I couldn't even wait to let these marinate - I ate most of them right after making them!  I can see these being a bit salty if you use both garlic salt and seasoning salt.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and they were perfect.  Such a quick way to kick up a boring old can of mushrooms!

Easy. Next time Iâ€™ll use fresh versus canned mushrooms, perhaps a variety and cut the salt a bit and reduce the vinegar, but this makes a quick appetizer for toothpick food.
