Although tender, my turkey turned out terribly dry.  Thank you so much for this great gravy recipe that saved the day!  So simple and quick to make, they didn't notice as they were to busy complimenting how great the gravy was!!!  Satisfied my picky eaters which is a major accomplishment!!!!

This gravy has a great flavor.  I only removed one star because despite NOT adding any of the optional extra liquid, the gravy was runnier than expected.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I typically struggle making gravy but this one worked okay for me. The one thing I didn't like was the color. Once the broth is added it  made it real light in color.  It gets thick quick and the more broth you add to thin it down the lighter it gets. If I made this again I would start with less flour to see if that would help maintain the darker color it starts out as.
