I needed a quick recipe for a "progressive" dinner, and although I wasn't sure about this recipe, I decided to give it a shot.  Not liking mints, I omitted those altogether.  I sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the punch, and with the dollops of whipped cream, it made a pretty presentation.  The punch was a huge hit, and the punchbowl was drained twice!  The carbonated beverage gives the punch a very light flavor.  Even people who don't like eggnog will like this drink.  If you like a little pizzazz, add a touch of brandy.
