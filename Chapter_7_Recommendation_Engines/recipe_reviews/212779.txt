Wow, these are so flavorful!  Nutmeg is quite strong but makes these so good.  It is not peach season but when I saved this recipe, I just couldnt wait to make them.  So I used canned peaches instead and drained them.  Make sure to put the nutmeg in the cottage cheese mixture because the description does not instruct you to do so.  I almost missed it...it makes a huge difference in flavor.  I got a little lazy with the stacking and just started eating them like regular pancakes lol.  Very good, thanks for the post. By the way, this makes tons of filling.

So tasty!  I am not a cottage cheese fan, yet the mixture and other flavours were enough to blend together perfectly!

Instead of 1 star, I gave this two because I had to use canned peaches (not in season where I live).  I thought everything was fine with the blintzes and the topping.  The filling tasted off to me...just a weird mixture of flavors.

I had 2 crepes to fill and had cottage cheese and chopped peaches in the fridge.  Used Jennifer's recipe for the first filling and it was delicious. Would never have thought to add nutmeg!  Looking forward to making the  whole recipe soon.
