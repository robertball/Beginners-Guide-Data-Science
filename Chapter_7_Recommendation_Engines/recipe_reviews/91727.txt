I made this for my family on Thanksgiving and it was a big hit!  Next time, I think I'll forget the apple topping and pour home-made caramel sauce over the pie!  It's wonderfully creamy, reminding me of an apple cheesecake.  Very easy and fast, too!

This pie was a big hit at my last party.  The consistency was strange though, perhaps because I've never made custard before?  The apple topping and glaze were so good I may make them as ice cream toppings.

I had a lot of trouble with the glaze, the first time I followed the recipe exactly, but it came out congealed and lumpy.  I searched and found this same recipe on another site, but with different quantities for the glaze, 1 tsp cornstarch and 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 c concentrate, and it was better.  But when I tried to get it on it would not drizzle, which is attractive, as opposed to plop, which is not. The glaze tastes ok, but is not much to look at.  To salvage the mess, I microwaved some good caramel sauce, and poured it over the top, as some other reviewers recommended. It covers the lumps, and is quite tasty.
