I gave this 4 stars because the sauce as is needed some changes. I added more heavy cream and some parmesan cheese to thicken it up. With those additions, it was great.

I USED THIS RECIPE AS A BASE, I USED CHICKEN STOCK INSTEAD OF MAKING THE SHRIMP SAUCE, OMITTED THE SHRIMP, USED 1 CUP OF CREAM AND ADDED THYME AND GARLIC POWDER, THEN I THICKENED IT WITH A BIT OF CORN STARCH, IT WAS WONDERFUL, JUST LIKE YOU WOULD GET AT A RESTAURANT.

Well, I don't know what to say, this recipe is simply delicious. I was in a pinch because I was out of ravioli, I made it myself-using 2 cups sifted flour, mixed with 1 egg, pinch of salt and 1 tbsp olive oli-->rolled into dough, with filling inside set on top of one another:  fried mackerel(with olive oil, chopped parsley, dill, black pepper and salt), slices of fried aubergine, mozarella cheese and tomatoes. Then I followed this recipe as stated although I made a lot of changes, eg substitute celery with spring onions and celery seeds, I didn't have thyme so I omitted, I actually boiled my raviolis for 3 minutes in the strained shrimp stock, before making the sauce..added more dill to the sauce(love how the dills gave this dish a flavorful smell), substitute canned tomatoes with cherry tomatoes, white wine with white grape juice and 2 tbsp cider vinegar. My sauce turned out thin but really it was perfect when teamed up with the ravioli. I didn't have heavy cream so I omitted and use whipped cream in a can and spray on top of my dish. This was the first time I learn what is ravioli and how to make them I was surprised myself it turns out soo juicy and tasty. I am impossible you can try it your way but overall this recipe is so hearty and delicious I love it!

This is a SAUCE recipe not a Lobster Ravioli recipe. However, the sauce was delicious and is rated based upon this recipe with changes. Still looking for a Lobster Rav recipe though.  Will keep making this sauce in hopes I can pair them. Thank you!!

I did not do the shrimp stock. The sauce itself is incredible and does not need it. For the sauce I used nonfat milk and some cornstarch instead of heavy cream. I used a cheese ravioli instead of lobster ravioli. Then added some mushrooms. So very good and will definitely make again. Restaurant quality.

I used the sauce recipe for another homemade ravioli and it was a hit with the family.

It is a very good recipe.  I basically wanted the sauce recipe to go with ravioli from Costco.  Since I didn't have any shrimp, I used chicken broth.  It was delicious and didn't overwhelm the taste of the lobster ravioli, but rather complimented it.  My only criticism is that the sauce is very thin, even with time spent trying to reduce it.  My husband loved it though, so I'll be making it again- with the shrimp next time!

Any recipe that calls for diced tomatoes, I automatically substitute "fire roasted " and then added some cherry tomatoes from the garden (10 halved) and simmered them half way through, while the wine and shrimp juice were cooking down for good measure.The cream wine sauce was light and delicious next to the rich ravioli.

I followed every single solitary detail of this recipe. What ruined this recipe? The insane amount of lemon. One whole lemon cut in half, and squeezing it's juice into the stock, was a HUGE mistake. Compound this by later adding in 2 tspn of lemon zest. Ugh! Horrible!! This was BITTER. Not to mention 1 tspn of Kosher salt was way too much salt as well. And yes, I do like lemon, but in this dish it was overkill.

If you want this recipe to go well, here is what I recommendâ€¦.Use half a lemon in the stock, and don't squeeze the juice out at all, just let the stock absorb it. And because you already have the lemon, completely skip using the lemon zest, period. Zest is bitter! Use 1/4 tspn of salt. If that's not enough, add it to your OWN plate later! Also, too much parsley - 1/4 cup would have been enough. Don't use Diced Petite Tomatoes. Go with Italian plum, and shred them up. This sauce needs a little bit of sweetness to kill the bitterness of the lemon.

I ended up having to add some sugar to kill the bitter flavor of this sauce.
