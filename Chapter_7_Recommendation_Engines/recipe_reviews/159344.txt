What a great creation and you don't have to wait until summer to enjoy it.  I had a bunch of lemons and limes, so I made my own sweet and sour mix. Heat 1 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 cup water until sugar is dissolved. Once cooled, add 1 cup lemon juice and 1 cup lime juice.

This is great! I switched the sweet and sour and orange juice amounts as I don't love sweet and sour mix.
