It was wonderful, even though I Made a booboo. I added the Mayo and zest in the stuffing. So I did make the topping for  the rolled filet of sole and sprinkled the top with a little nacho spice. If hearing the guests say mmm, mmm all through the meal was any indication was any indication, I'd say it was a hit!

Who needs Red Lobster when you can make this at home? Other than omitting the pablano pepper and using Basa instead of Sole, I followed the recipe as written - and WOW!!! My husband doesn't like crab (let alone IMITATION crab), but he gobbled this right up! And my 3-yr-old could have eaten just the stuffing by itself :) I added some of the mayonnaise mixture to the crab to bind it all together, and used lots of lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper! 5/5

This was really quick and easy to make and turned out delicious.  I used canned cocktail shrimp because I didn't have crab meat and I always use cornflake crumbs in place of panko or breadcrumbs.  I also added a wee bit of the sauce to the mixture to make it a bit creamy. Loved the results and will make this a regular. Looking forward to trying it with crab next time. Thanks Chef John!

I saw this recipe and just had to try it.  I'm always looking for new seafood recipes and this one turned out very good.

I couldn't find any sole, so I bought 12 oz of flounder.  My fillets were maybe a bit bigger than sole, so it made 4 nice sized rolls.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but I used normal italian bread crumbs because I didn't have any panko.  Also, I used canned crab, which I hated to do, but it worked out fine.  Because my rolls were a bit larger, I cooked them for around 25 mins.

The seasonings for this recipe was delicious.  I was afraid of mixing fish, poblano peppers, and cayanne pepper but it tasted great.  Just a tiny bit of heat, but certainly not too much.  The mayo mixture kept the fish very moist.

Next time I'll do everything the same, but will try to find fresh crabmeat.

Liked this a lot but felt it was missing something.I love to play with recipes so the next time I made it,I added chopped spinach to the stuffing.If using frozen,squeeze it very dry.Also tried it using hollaindaise instead of the mayo on top.It came out luscious.

Made this recipe last night and WOW! the result was a company worthy dish and although it's quite rich tasting, really the only sinful part is the mayo.  I used minced red bell pepper in place of the plobano, because it's what I had on hand.  I skipped the last step of piping the mayo mixture on top to save time and just lightly doppled it on.  Those were the only changes.  We are trying to eat more fish these days and need new and different ways to eat it.  If you are lucky enough to live near a Trader Joe's, they stock Dover Sole in the freezer section.  I do imagine that this recipe would work with other fish as well.  Watching Chef John's video was helpful.  As always, Chef John scores another hit.  Loved it!

This was quick and easy fix for me. I wanted some stuffed flounder and didn't want to go out for it, so I lookup this recipe and it did the trick. I loved it and I couldn't have gotten any better by going out for it.

I loved this recipe and made it last night for my Christmas Eve guests and everyone loved it. I didn't change a thing except that I didn't have any Poblano peppers and used marinated jalapenos instead. It added an extra dimension of heat due to the fact that the peppers were marinated and were thus stronger, so if you like less heat, use the fresh Poblanos. I doubled the recipe so the cook time needed to be about 5 or so minutes longer. I recommend to keep checking it towards the end to make sure they are not drying out. Enjoy!

This was very good, and very easy.  Suitable for company.
I had a larger container of lump crab meat so ended up at least doubling the stuffing recipe and added a bit of mayo and lemon zest to hold the stuffing together.  Other than that I followed the original recipe.  I cut thin rings of the leftover poblano pepper and baked them on top as a garnish.  We always enjoy Chef John's recipes and find the videos so entertaining and helpful!

I found it to be a bit dry and kind of bland but I liked the overall recipe. Next time I will add more seasoning & something to moisten the stuffing - perhaps 2 or 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise. And as for the mayonnaise, I just couldn't bring myself to slather mayonnaise over the fish so I covered it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Looking forward to trying it again with these adjustments.

I went to the grocer, of coarse they didn’t have sole or lump crab so I substituted with cod and fresh shrimp.

I made this recipe as stated using whitefish fillets that were not sole (I don't remember the fish but it was large fillets.) My family and I all very much enjoyed the meal. I will make this again with any large whitefish fillets. I did use canned crab meat, but it was one we buy from an on-line store that is actual crab meat and not much like that you normally get at the store.

I made this dish as directed with the following alterations:

Haddock instead of sole (whole fillet - huge portions, imagine sole would be more reasonable);

Used the stuffing recipe in the Crab Stuffed Haddock recipe (link below);

I live in a fishing community and had both fresh snow crab and haddock.  The lemon zest mayo added some incredible flavour without overpowering, and the stuffing is nice and light.

Will definitely be making again.  Note that I had enough stuffing left over after having stuffed 6 fillets to make about a half dozen crab-stuffed mushroom caps (they freeze very well).

Will definitely make again.

Not very flavorful. Next time add more spice, more onion and more pepper. Used Old Bay seasoning, but it needed more of that as well.

I found this to be quite dry and flavorless. I’m going to attempt this again by incorporating a béchamel sauce , with a bit of Parmesan , along all listed ingredients, into the crab mixture.

Loved it!  I did not roll the filets, wrapped them around a mound of stuffing.  I think rolling them would be best-my version was a bit too heavy on stuffing to filet ratio for my taste.

This was a great recipe!   We couldn't find sole so we used cod.    I also added Parmesan cheese to the crab mix.   My husband loved this!

I made recipe as written except using frozen sole and canned crab.  The crab was tasteless, so I added shrimp, else made as written.  These were rather bland.  Trick with frozen fish is to thaw in refrigerator then place on paper towels to soak up excess water.  If I were going to make again I would use fresh ingredients.  I think it would be better with haddock.  We cannot buy dungeness crab here on the east coast of Canada, but snow crab is probably a good substitute.  We also have access to Alaskan crab meat so that might work as well.

I find this recipe hit or miss depending a few things. Made this several times because I had to figure out what went wrong the second time. Let me say this recipe is really great when it turns out right. Firstly dont overcrowd them in the baking dish. make sure they do not touch eachother, as tjey will end us cooking in the juices making the stuffing turn to mush. I also found they turn out better in a convection oven. I also find the frozen sole was more firm than the fresh and expelled less moisture when cooking (ofcourse i tried and laid both in paper towels to soak up as much water as possible). I like this but find it hard to make consistantly.

These are delicious I made a mistake and added the mayo to the crab mix and it still turned out great! Inexpensive and delicious. I have a large mixed family and everyone cleaned their plates and were talking about it for weeks. A great choice for dinner!

This was absolutely delicious!  I also put the mayo with the crab ( like someone else did) and only had sweet white onion. We loved the bit of crunch with the onion.  We cracked our own crab and served home grown green beans in sweet garlic sauce and green salad!

Very easy to make this meal. It looks more difficult to make than it is, and my husband and mother-in-law said, "I would make this again" and "I need to eat more fish," respectively.

This was very good.  I used a jalapeno pepper, as that's what I had on hand, and also added a little cream cheese to the filling, otherwise made as written.  It turned out great.  Very moist, creamy, just plain delicious.  I'll be making this again.

I thought it was amazing. I wish there wad a mayo based with some zip, dipping sauce to go with or to drizzle on the plates  before serving. 
Whynot turn it up a knotch!
Thank you for the amazing recipe?

I made this dish and my friends and I loved it. I forgot to check the recipe and added mayonnaise to the stuffing; a little rich but sooo good:):). I also did it the right way and still was good.

Make sure you completely debone the fish and use fresh steamed crab and shell it yourself. I used preprepaired crab from the seafood section to cut down on time - big mistake. It was fishy tasting and gross, threw out the whole lot.

This was amazing! I used flounder instead because sole wasn't available, but it still turned out great. My husband and I felt fancy eating this dish at home because it's usually something we would eat if we were out somewhere special. Definitely a recipe to try!
