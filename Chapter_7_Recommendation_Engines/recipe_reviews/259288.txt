We substituted Sweet potato tots in for regular, they needed to bake a bit longer to be crisp but over all this was a huge hit, and a great way to use up ham.   We opted for it as a breakfast side, but would make a great side to soup or dinner as well

I gave this 5 stars because if made as is, it would work. But, I chose to use left-over mashed potatoes. Baked in Muffin cups.
The filling can be made with cubed ham, leftovers. I pretty much stayed with your recipe. I prebaked the filling, slightly. Then added to "cups" Topped with cheese, baked till melted.
Watch closely!
