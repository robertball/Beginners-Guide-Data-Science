This recipe was so quick to put together and great being able to cook the fish in foil packets on the grill.  It is a great summer recipe.  I added the red pepper flakes to the butter when it was still hot, so, it was really infused with the red pepper.   If you don't like it too spicy - wait for your butter to slightly cool or use less red pepper flakes.  I also used light butter.  It worked perfectly and the flavor was great.  I used fresh dill instead of dry because I had some to use up before it went bad and the fresh herbs were a great compliment to the fish.

Substituted swordfish for the haddock, and added 1 minute more each side. Paired with grilled asparagus, and a New Zealand Chardonnay (Wild South). Perfect!

Excellent blend of flavors. Love the heat from the red peppers. Had it with haddock fillet. Yum.

We used tilapia and salmon.  Skipped red pepper because we don't like spicy but still delicious.  It was very quick to prep, cook and clean up and even our toddlers ate it!

This was an excellent recipe.  The dill and lime juice added an interesting flavor to the dish.  I didn't add as much red pepper flakes as it called for but still used enough for that kick.  I used walleye fillets from the great Missouri River.  In all most of my reviews I have to mention that I have a very, as in really very, picky husband and he thought this was great.  I saved this to my favorite recipes and will make again.  You won't be disappointed.

Great recipe. I used frozen white/ pan fish, did the recipe just as suggested but added a spread made of sour cream, avocado and chopped tomatoes to the fish before sealing it in foil. The flavors came together perfectly!

I used fresh Cod, fresh Dill, left out the Red Pepper and no added Salt. My wife who does not like fish or spicy stuff loved it. I loved it as well on a sodium restricted diet.

I used basa fillets which I've never used before so when I found this to be rather tasteless tonight, I wasn't sure if was the fish or the recipe to blame. Hubby liked it well enough but he pretty much likes anything to do with fish. I may try this again with the fish called for or perhaps a different type of fish that I've used before.

Very good - needed a little extra zip.  Might try a dash of Worcestershire Sauce and some garlic next time.
