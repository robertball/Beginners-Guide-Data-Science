These were good, I used peach preserves. I think that the peanut butter chips overwhelmed the jelly taste.  I think next time that I will double the jelly or use strawberry, although I did like the peach flavor in this.  Thanks!

These are divine.  My only complaint would be that according to me, they are perhaps a bit too sweet with all those chips on top, so I usually just cut down on the amount.  Other than that, they are excellent, and always disappear in a flash.  You can even make them with butterscotch chips, which I have done, if you don't have the PB ones, and they still turn out fantabulous.

These were unbelievable.  Boyfriend devoured them with glass of milk.  If you like pb and j you have to try them...they're too easy not too.

These were a fun change from plain peanut butter, or peanut butter and chocolate cookies.  Be careful not to let the peanut butter chips brown--if they do they don't taste very good.  People generally seemed to like them, and the idea of peanut butter and jelly in a cookie.

These were just kind of "okay"- my husband didn't like them, and my 2 year old sort of picked at one and left it alone. I may try them again to tweak a little. I used marionberry jam because I had tons of it- and it just tasted too strong. I needed either more peanut butter flavor or less jam. They ended up really sweet, too. The peanut butter chips are pretty sugary- I might try again with just regular peanut butter and see if we like it better that way.

Have made these several times and always come out great!  I usually make mine with Huckleberry Jelly, as that is my customers' favorite.  Thank you for a great keeper!  :-))))))) A+++++++

I loved this dish.  It's fantastic!  It makes you feel just like a little kid again.  Hey, pass the milk!  The hubby and the kids loved it too.  Of course you can use any jelly you like, but I do prefer the grape.  Happy eating.

I changed the recipe slightly.  I used two eggs, and one cup of strawberry jam.  However, they turned out really well, taste just like the sandwich but better, and my family loved them!

These were pretty good.  Maybe I'm just a strawberry jelly kind of person, I'd try it again with that kind.  My 2 1/2 year old loved them, too.

These were fantastic.  They tasted an awful lot like a pb & j sandwich.  Brought them to a party and everyone loved them.

They are my favorite bar cookies.  When I make them, I can't stop eating them.
