Spicy, hot & delish. Mostly followed the ingredients but changed up some measurements. Used 1 lb. 99% fat-free ground turkey breasts; 10 oz. diced tomatoes w/ habanero peppers (only use habanero option if you want to spike the heat); lite coconut milk. Eliminated the sesame oil and sautéed turkey, onion & garlic in Better Than Bouillon, Chicken Base. These changes eliminated some fat making it an even healthier version, and it’s still great tasting.

The recipe as written seems to have more turkey than necessary so you may want to decrease the amount or, if using the 2 lbs., at least up the garbanzo beans as others have suggested. Thank you Marcia for a fantastic recipe!  UPDATE: This has become a repeat winner for us. I now add 1 cup of jumbo mixed raisins when stirring in the garbanzo beans. If you prefer firmer raisins, add during last 5 minutes of cooking time.

Delicious. I forgot to use the garlic and it didn't matter. I also left the turkey out. This dish tastes amazing and is so quick to make.

This is a keeper!  Yummm...makes my mouth hum.  I followed other's tips.  Made my own 1/2 c sweet chili sauce (ketchup, honey & Sriracha); used 2 cans garbanzo (1 might have been fine) and 1 cup lite coconut milk.  Did it all in my electric skillet. Put over rice.  Fast, delicious, one-of-a-kind.

This is so delicious. I have been searching for a beautiful saucey curry dish like this to make at home. My husband and I love these flavors and I am so pleased with how it turned out. I served over jasmine rice and I used the remaining coconut milk in the rice...great combo!! Thanks!

May have been because I used madras curry, but I didn't care for this recipe. Also it was too sweet for my tastes.

Awesome recipe but I did make lots of changes as follows: 0) used bacon grease to cook up onion 
1) did not use turkey - didn't have 
2) used a whole can of coconut milk plus at least one cup of chicken broth 
3) threw in 1 cup rice and cooked it in sauce 
4) did not use chili sauce - didn't have 
5) added peas at end

Great recipe !! I changed the canned tomatoes for real ones, added curry paste instead of plain powder, and added cubes of tofu instead of the meat.  It was really great !!

This was a delicious recipe. I served it over curried sweet potatoes. The flavors of the two dishes melded together wonderfully. The only change I made was that instead of the sweet chili sauce, I used garlic chili sauce (and much less of it). 

The meal was great the first day, but even better as leftovers as the flavors had more time to meld together.

I used 1 lb of turkey, 2 cans of chickpeas, and 3/4 c of coconut milk. Couldn't find sweet chili sauce,so I had to improvise with a mix of chili garlic sauce and hoisin sauce, which was still quite good.

WOW I'm so impressed!  I would order this in a restaurant and can't believe that now I can actually MAKE it!  Thanks for a wonderful add to my recipe box.  All I did different was add 2 diced peppers- always trying to sneak in extra veggies.  Yummy!

A hit at  my dinner party! I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans and a whole can of lite coconut milk with a 20 oz. package of ground turkey. Everyone raved about how sweet/spicy it was (I was pretty liberal with the red chili flakes).

My husband loved it more than me... but I did modify slightly. I did not have an onion so I used granulated onion. I also used a suggestion for homemade sweet chili sauce and made mine with ketchup, soy sauce, sriracha, and sugar. I also used almond milk since I didn't have any coconut milk - this was surprisingly effective! :) All in all it was pretty good. We had a jar of mango ginger chutney from Trader Joe's that my husband used on top of the curry to enhance the flavor even more. This is a good base recipe. I will try it again and make some more modifications. Thank you for posting!

Loved this! Followed another reviewer's recipe for making their own sweet chili sauce (ketchup, sriracha, honey and soy), added more honey and sriracha to taste as it simmered as we like it spicy and used lite coconut milk. Also, did not wait until the end to add the salt, pepper and red pepper flakes (added halfway through). Served with wild rice and just loved it. Excellent recipe!!

This is a very tasty recipe but I felt there needed a few changes.  I  felt there werent enough tomatoes so I added some chunky crushed  tomatoes (about a cup)  I added more chick peas(about another half can) and it turned out perfect. I also only used one package of turkey meat.

Super easy, quick and tasty!  Nice spice amount.  I didn't have sweet chili sauce, so I improvised with just under 1/2 cup ketchup, approx. 1 Tbs. honey, 1 Tbs. sriracha and 1 Tbs soy sauce (I guestimated).

Great recipe - quick, easy and relatively healthy.  I've made it twice and changed it a little the second time - only used one pound of ground turkey and doubled the chickpeas and tomatoes. Also, I eat it plain instead of over rice, so it's more like a stew - yummy!

This has totally become one of my go to recipes. It’s quick, easy and delicious! Absolutely a crowd pleaser! I halved the meat but kept all other ingredients the same with increased red pepper flakes. Perfect!

I didn't have chili sauce and did not miss it.  I added a hand full of raisins and that worked well.  I used the whole can of coconut milk and it was just the right amount .   I like that the dish was quick to make, healthy, inexpensive, and tasted great.

i made this for bf and his daughter and they both enjoyed it.. i subbed 19 oz of tofu (that i pan fried ahead of time) for the turkey and used 1/2 red curry paste and 1/2 yellow curry powder for all the curry powder.. i also added a can of straw mushrooms and think some roasted red peppers would have gone  great in this.. i thought there was going to be more of a sauce and would have added more coconut milk in the beginning if i would have thought of it, but it was still good over brown rice.. bf added sriracha and his daughter added soy sauce.. i wouldn't call this authentic by any means but it was a fast, easy dinner and i always appreciate that.. ty for the recipe

Quick and easy to make and my husband - who would happily eat curry at every meal - loved it.  I made it exactly as written and I've already made it twice since finding the recipe last week!

This is amazing! We used diced chicken instead of the turkey. It is a total 5 and gives our favorite Indian restaurant a run for its money. And, as a working Mom - it is fast and easy!

It was good. We go through a lot of healthy recipes and quite a few don't make the edible category. I used ground breast meat turkey, salt free diced tomatoes, (rinsed) 50% sodium garbanzo beans and lower fat coconut milk. I wouldn't call it spicy, nor would I exactly call it curry, but it has a nice flavor and I'll definitely make it again.

I do add a 2nd can of chickpeas if using the 2lbs of meat....the time I only made it w/1lb was a big mistake,as I can't stand not having leftovers of this dish.I have always used the Thai style sweet chili  sauce,as that's what I thought was being called for,but based on comments,I wonder if I was supposed to b using the very different Heinz ketchupy chili sauce (doesn't matter because I'll never change it now) Like others suggest,I use the remainder coconut milk when cooking up jasmine rice to serve this with. I also like to top it w/a lil cilantro & chopped peanuts,if handy. The brands of (reg)curry powder out there,I found out,vary greatly in heat factor,some not spicy at all....I didn't know this,& the type I use here is spicy compared to what I've bought before....that's ok,the flavour is so good,& the heat is balanced by the addition (I guiltily added to recipe) of some raisins & diced mango.... Despite the heat,my kids always ask for 2nds(not to step on toes,but the addition of the fruit is Wonderful!) so forgive me if I did add my own spin,but thank u SO much for what has become one of my most favourite dishes(& this from a gal who IS NOT a ground turkey fan)

I made this last night for dinner but used chicken thighs instead. Delicious! Quick, easy and tremendous flavor. I used one of the other poster's suggestion and used the extra coconut milk in the Jasmine rice that accompanied this dish so well. I not only made it last night, but am making it again tonight- a double batch this time!

Used 2.5 cups leftover Thanksgiving turkey, finely shredded; was lucky to find sweet chili sauce at Krogers. Added about 2/3 cup raisins, increased coconut milk to 2/3 cup, and used the rest in the rice.  Served with mango chutney.  It was a lively and interesting dish, and a great way to use up leftover turkey.  Very tasty.  Will I make it again?  Probably not.  Too many other recipes to try, but I do highly recommend trying this.  It may turn out to be one your favorites.

Followed the recipe except only used 1 lb of turkey and added a little bit of cumin.  Flavor profile was alright, but seemed to be lacking something, and wasn't as complex as other curries I've made from this site.  It did come together quickly, which is nice for a weeknight dinner, and worked well over rice, as it was a bit soupy. 

Tasted better the next day and even the day after that - I guess a couple of days let the flavors marinade awhile, and I thought it was better than fresh!

Even after reading the good reviews, I was skeptical about this recipe as it looked a bit of an odd combination. 
Anyway, it turned out delicious - the whole family devoured it. It was easy to make too.
I added some chopped fresh red pepper and served over rice.

This is a crowd favorite! I make small changes, like varying the types of curry I use, but overall, I do it exactly as written. I’ve had this in regular rotation for years now.
