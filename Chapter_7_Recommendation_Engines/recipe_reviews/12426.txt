This is a great pie!  For extra flavor, I added 1/4 cup tequila to the filling - very tasty.  I found that chilling in the freezer was the only way to get this firm enough to keep its shape for serving, and it makes it even more refreshing.  Also, I used a 10" pie plate and still had leftover crust (enough to make a miniature pie for the kids with no tequila). To make (2) 9x13 pies, triple the filling and only double the crust. Garnish w/salted lime slices (1/4 rounds) and a little dollop of extra CoolWhip. So pretty! Be sure to NOT just dump the pretzels into the food processor - you could end up with ALL the loose salt from the bottom of the bag! You want salty, but not THAT salty! Learned that one the hard way. :)

Excellent pie!  Great combo of flavors. I read all the reviews and learned the pie could be loose, so I added a 1/2 package of softened cream cheese and cut back on the Cool Whip.  I didn't have any fresh limes on hand, so I used conentrated lime juice and a dash of Rose's Sweetened lime juice. I kept adding lime and orange to a taste that I liked - probably a bit more than the recipe called for.  I put the pie in the freezer for 45 minutes and it set up beautifully and cut very well. With the cream cheese, the pie is probably a little heavier, but has a great consistency. I also kept the pretzel pieces a little bigger to give some texture. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Prepared this for the July 4th weekend and it was a "hit". The margarita flavor isn't overpowering, very smooth taste. 

Don't let the title "Margarita" limit what food you serve the pie with. The flavor of the pie is very versatile. YUMMY! The only problem with this recipe is: you will have to grab a piece fast. 

Note: wouldn't recommended freezing unless it is thawed for 12 hours before serving.

Not the kind of pie kids would be eating but very impressive for adults.  The dish is a very refreshing after-dinner treat.  Really a fabulous recipe.

I loved the pretzel crust and my guests were surprised to learn what it was.  I only used about 3/4 of the container of whipped topping and if I made it again I would cut back a little more to make the lime/orange flavor even more predominant.  Some have said that the filling didn't set well, and reducing the whipped topping may help that problem as mine held its shape perfectly.

This was just ok for us - my rating is 3 1/2 stars.  I really liked the pretzel crust in contrast to the (VERY!) sweet filling, but mine never set right.  I have what's left of it in the freezer now to see if a frozen or semi-frozen version would be better, but as written the filling was very runny even after chilling for an hour and a half in the refrigerator.  I'll probably give this one another try, but I'd use less whipped topping - maybe even just half a container.  It has very good flavor, so I think it has potential, but I was hoping for a firmer pie.  ***UPDATE***  After freezing overnight, the texture was much better - like a soft ice cream.  Four stars as a frozen dessert - but I would still like to try reducing the amount of whipped topping next time.

LOVE this pie. I have made this forever and felt I should review. I have squeezed an orange and then zested it in place of the orange juice and have also added orange liqueur..yum. GREAT served with fresh strawberries. I love this pie after a heavy Mexican meal b/c it's light and refreshing but keeps with the theme...

Everyone loved this pie.  Men who I thought wouldn't touch dessert ate it up! One said it reminded him of his mother's lemon box pie.

This recipe is so simple and very delish!! Some say that is was runny but mine held it's shape perfectly. Just make sure you mix all wet ingredients together well before folding in the whipped topping.

Excellent recipe!  I added 4 tsp of tequila and 1 tsp of triple sec to give the pie a little kick.  My guests loved the pie... I will be making this again.

I've made this three times in under a month. My boyfriend (who doesn't love chocolate the way I do) really enjoys it!  Most recently I made it on a trip home and it did not turn out as well. I'd been using large, thick old-fashioned pretzels but this time my mom had leftover skinny stick pretzels for me to use. I crushed them right in the bag. It turned out terribly salty! I think it was a combination of the smaller, less "doughy" pretzels and extra salt at the bottom of the bag. So I suggest always using the thicker pretzels. I had raved to my family about how great the pretzel crust is - how the touch of salt is refreshing - but it was too much for everyone and embarassing. Other than that, a hit!

This really is a great version of key lime pie.  I put it in a tart pan and garnished it with limes and whipped cream.  Everyone loved it - I really like the salty crust - after having it, I much prefer it to the regular graham cracker crust.

I made this into a trifle, but the 4 stars are for the filling.  Really liked the flavor, it was very refreshing.  I used crushed pretzels and sliced strawberries in my trifle, and the salt from the pretzels went really well with the filling, while the strawberries cut the tartness a bit.  I'm going to keep tinkering with this, but thank you for such a cool idea to play with!

This pie was fantastic! I made it special for some friends coming over for dinner, and we were all scraping our plates clean. What little was left over became my breakfast and lunch the next day. I will absolutely be making this again, many more times!

Great recipe!  I wanted to take a dessert to our office Cinco de Mayo potluck, and decided to try this.  It was light and refreshing, perfect after eating all the other food.  I doubled it and made it in a 9x13 dish.  After reading comments about it melting, I tried adding a packet of unflavored gelatin, and the pie held up fine.  I also added 2 drops of green food coloring.  Thanks for sharing an awesome recipe!

This pie was good-It had a bit much whipped topping it it, so it never chilled to the right consistency.  When cut, it "spread" out on the plate.  Still tasted good:)  The crust is fantastic!!  I would recommend cutting back on the lime zest.  Add just a little, not the zest of 2 limes as recipe states.  Overall, great pie for hot summer day-Will make again, but cut back on whipped topping and possibly add more lime juice for more lime taste.  We LOVE lime anything!

Great! This was very refreshing and easy. I would never had made a recipe like this if I hadn't been searching for a way to use up pretzels without buying a lot of extra ingredients. By the way, once I juiced the limes, I had well over 1/2 cup of juice when combined with the OJ. I'm not sure how much exactly, but probably close to 3/4 cup of orange and lime juices. Use a whisk, and it will eventually all incorporate nicely with the sweetened condensed milk.

Wow!  A lot of flavour is packed into this pie!  Refreshing after a heavy mexican meal.  I made it for my Canadian in-laws who didn't even know how to build a taco and it was an amazing hit!

I enjoyed this recipe so much!  It was a big hit at work AND at my Bible study at church. The only thing I did different, though, was that I didn't use the lime zest.  And sometime I would like to try adding a little green food coloring to it to see how it looks with a little more green color.

This dessert is awsome.  My husband wanted me to use crushed ginger snap cookies instead of the pretzels so I did.  I would make a double batch for the crust.  It was fabulous.

Granted I rushed the prep time but I found this pie to be terribly sweet. The only redeming part was the pretzel crust, which I will definately use in the future.

My husband rates this recipe an almost 4 stars.  He really liked the pretzel crust.  I give it 3 stars since I'm a "if it isn't chocolate, why bother" kind of dessert person.  I followed the recipe exactly except I froze it.  I can't imagine how you could eat it otherwise since the filling would be rather goopey if you didn't.

Very good pie, similar to key lime but with a salty pretzel crust and fluffier filling due to the cool whip.  I like the idea of freezing it like another reviewer suggested--Good Idea I will have to try this!  Kids loved it without the tequila.

This recipe is delicious.  I would have never thought prezels and sugar would be so great together.  If you are looking to impress without spending a lot of time in the kitchen, this is an easy and refreshing dessert.  Even my husband liked it and he doesn't even like citrus. Thanks!

A friend reommended this pie and the recipe sounds the same. It was good, but I don't really get the whole Margarita name. I thought it could have used more kick. I used fresh limes and maybe should have done 3 or used concentrate. I also wonder what a margarita mixer would do... may try that next time. Still, was very yummy and the crust quite unique- FYI... the measument is after you crush them... a food chopper from Pampered Chef works great! Great "chillin'" recipe!

I've made this several times, and it's always a hit.  I detest Cool Whip, so I always use fresh whipped cream.  So good!

Crushed Pretzel crust really made this pie what it is! It was good tasting but very runny, possibly because I used low-fat ingredients when available, next time I will try the good stuff!

Wonderful crust! I was hesitant about it but it was really great! Everyone liked this dish... You have to like Key Lime obviously, but still very refreshing and tart! I wasnt crazy about the taste but I dont really like lime. I will make this again!!

Loved this and will definitely make again. I was a little concerned about the pretzels getting soggy so after I crushed them, I toasted them in the oven.  Came out really well, even though I used a little too many pretzels.  I'll make a less thick crust next time.  Bonus for this one.... It's Gluten Free!

With all the reviews, I decided to make this untested for a work party that had a mexican food theme.   Someone at work said it was too sweet and just wasn't good.  :(    I tried it and couldn't disagree.   I was disappointed that it wasn't great.. not sure what happened.

This is always a hit, but I never add the sugar to the pretzel crust.  I made it like that by accident and we all like it much better.

This pie  is good and extremely easy, but I can't give it 5 stars.  the pretzels give it a twist  on taste but it is similar to many other recipes I have tried. It is worth making and my family liked it.  It just didn't "knock our socks off"
