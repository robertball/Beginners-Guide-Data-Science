I thought  this was a very good drink, and it was super easy and fast to put together. Not to mention a pretty drink to look at while you're sipping.

I love vodka being true to my Russian heritage and I am always looking for different way to spice up this potent drink.  I am so glad to have found something as different as this was. It was simple and very refreshing on a hot summer day.  I love the way the tangyness of the pink lemonade adds and yet compliments the vodka's taste.  Thanks!

This was pretty good but it was a little too strong for me, next time I'll try it with just 1 1/2 ounces vodka.
