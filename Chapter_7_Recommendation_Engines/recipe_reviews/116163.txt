A very refreshing side dish. I made this dish exactly according to recipe. I would use less lemon juice.

It was very good. We didn't add the lemon juice though(didn't have any). We love fresh green beans. We mainly used the garlic, sugar, and butter. I steamed the green beans while heating up the butter sauce (butter, sugar and garlic). After the green beans were tender, I poured the butter over the beans, mixed well, then added salt and pepper. It was a HUGE hit in out house.

Great recipe!  I used a steam in bag of green beans, less sugar and a mixture of olive oil and butter.  The lemon juice gives the beans a very nice flavor.

Nothing dramatic in terms of seasonings here, but just a few, simple, fresh ingredients are often the characteristic and signature of great dishes.  I don't have a steamer basket, so just dropped the beans in boiling water for about five minutes until crisp-tender.  The sugar didn't appeal to me so I just left it out, and I loved the addition of the lemon, something I don't always think to do.  Delicious.

Perfect! I don't have a steamer basket so I just boiled the beans, drained, then mixed in with the garlic butter. Thanks for sharing! :)

For us, it was too much lemon juice. Next time, I'd cut the lemon juice in half (or use lemon pepper seasoning). I'd like to try this with EVOO next time.

Very good.  I only used a few spashes of lemon juice instead of the amount listed.  I also added some bacon bits at the end.

I won't have my green beans any other way now.  When I try them without the lemon, they taste dull and flat.  Tailor the amount to your liking, as with every recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I do not believe any other words could describe the taste my family and I had with this lovely side dish. I did change a couple of things to the recipe, not saying that it was a must, but just from prior experiences. I doubled the amount of butter also added 2 TBS of Garlic Salt! Our family will definately have this side dish over and over again! A+++

An excellent basic recipe for green beans. I was looking for a recipe to approximate the green beans I had recently in a restaurant, and which my 4-year-old daughter loved, and this is very close. I cooked them for about 10 minutes because the ones from the restaurant were a little more well done than crisp-tender. I doubled the amount of butter; in our house, we like butter. I also used one teaspoon of lemon juice rather than two, and that tasted like the right amount to me. Left out the sugar because we didn't have any (strange, I know). My daughter ate these beans up. This recipe will now be part of the regular dinner rotation in my house.

Mmmmm these were good! This is going to be my "go to green bean recipe" from now on. I made a few adjustments based on our tastes and what we had around olive oil instead of butter, frozen haricot verts instead of fresh green beans, two garlic cloves instead of one and the juice of a Meyer lemon instead of regular lemon juice.

I was very disappointed by this recipe.  I picked beans out of the garden and steamed them minutes later.  The beans were great right up to the time I put the sauce on them.  My husband and 2 kids - who love fresh veggies out of the garden - all did not care for this.

A good basic recipe. I left out the sugar and reduced the lemon juice just a bit. Mu daughter and husband gobbled this up. It's so quick and simple there's no doubt I will make this again. Thankyou Erika.

What a great recipe!!  I paired it with Chicken Piccata because of the lemon in it.  It was a great compliment to the lemon & wine in the chicken as well as the rice. Thanks for the submission, this one is a keeper.

Did not care for this recipe. The flavor of the lemon juice did not compliment the green beans well and the garlic flavor was not strong enough. Will not make again.

My kids didn't like it at all. Too bland, no flavor at all.

Pretty good but I think they would be better without the lemon.  I used my rice cooker to steam fresh green beans which worked great.  I did the butter mixture in a tiny cast iron skillet.  Don't use cast iron, my garlic turned a bluish-green.  I think there was a reaction between the iron and the acid in the lemon juice.

Sadly the recipe didn't go over well at our family dinner, even with my veggie lovers...  I think if you decreased the lemon juice A LOT it might be better!
