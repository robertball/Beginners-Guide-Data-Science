I made this for dinner last night and it was really good.  I made a few changes though, so hence only 4 stars.  1- I scaled down the recipe to fit in a 8x8 pan.  2- I added some cumin and S&P to the egg mixture.  3- I made my enchilada sauce mixed with a can of cream of mushroom soup-  try it, it's SO good.  4- I used 1/2 onion, 1/2 green pepper, & 1/2 yellow pepper for veggies.  5- Next time, I'll fry the corn tortillas before laying them in the pan.  

Overall, this recipe is a really nice mexican dish.  Easy, fast, and tasty!  Will definitely make again.

We  also used bacon cooked and diced up and used sharp chedder and pepperjack cheese.  This was really good, but hubby added some hot sauce to his.  Will make again.

Okay. We made it exactly as the recipe stated but for us it just seemed to be missing something. It was super easy to throw together though so it may be a recipe that we will work with and see if it can be jazzed up a bit. Maybe some more cheese and a few other spices with the eggs.

This gets 3.5 stars for taste, but because of the ease of preparation, and also the 'uses things I usually have on hand' factor, I give it 4. I added a little ground cumin to the sauce - it was a little bit bland.

This recipe was great, but the cooking time was much different.  I'd say about 50-60 mins minimum to get this recipe to brown on top and for the eggs to solidify.  Otherwise great recipe.

this didn't have the flavor I was looking for and in comparison to similar dishes was too eggy tasting.

I really enjoyed this. I did make a few changes though and layered two lots of tortilla and egg, then had two another layer of tortillas over the top and spread the sauce over that for the last ten minutes. I added the mushrooms to the egg mix rather than the sauce.

This was amazing. Followed the recipe pretty much as it's written. I only used some roasted New Mexico Hatch green chilies. They were HOT - too hot for the kids, but the family raved about it for days after. Simple and easy! Thanks!!

I served this recipe at Sunday Brunch and all my guests loved it.  Great vegetarian egg bake. Be sure to get enchilada sauce that does not have "beef renderings" if you have vegetarian guests at your occasion!

To be fair, I really did intend to stick to the recipe this time, but I never fail to not follow the rules. First I used egg starts intead of real eggs, then I added green onion, crab and feta to the eggs. I baked it at 375 for 50-60 minutes to get the eggs to set. For the sauce I used LaVicortia's enchilada sauce and added chopped tomato and dicarded the mushrooms. It was a huge hit!

I took this to work for a going away brunch and everyone loved it. We brought along extra heated sauce in case someone wanted more. Very good.

Added cumin. Didn't use green or red peppers used orange and yellow.  Sauted some onion in microwave and added.  I didn't add mushrooms because it was a social function will add for my family!

Not bad.  I tossed some leftover stuff I was trying to use up into the eggs:  chopped turkey lunch meat and chopped avocado, and I really liked the avocado in this.  It was a cool complement to the spicy enchilada sauce.  I also put in some cumin, salt and pepper and parsley.  Hubs doesn't really like peppers, and I am not a fan of mushrooms, so I just did half mushroom and half pepper topping.  Worked out well.  Hubs told me he wasn't so sure about the texture of this, nor is he apparently a fan of the enchilada sauce, but otherwise he thought it was fine.  I thought it was an interesting take on a breakfast casserole, but I think I prefer others.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a good recipe.  I did change it up a bit to use what I had in the house.
I used red/orange peppers (no green peppers).  I added in sun dried tomatoes and ham (instead of mushrooms).
I added in a teaspoon each of cumin, oregano and dried mustard, used 1/4 cup of medium salsa (no enchilada sauce, but wanted some of that flavor).
Thought the corn tortillas on the bottom was a great idea.

Easy to make the night before and re-heats very well! Good for a quick breakfast through the week.

I really liked the eggs. The sauce was too much if you used it all. Next time the sauce definitely goes on the side instead of poured on top.

I liked this.. really tasty. I subbed cottage cheese for part of the regular cheese and use crushed red pepper in the egg instead of red bell. Topped it with the sauce, shrooms and some of the diced green chilis and a bit of sour cream. I also added some canadian bacon to the mix.. I like "stuff" in my egg bakes
