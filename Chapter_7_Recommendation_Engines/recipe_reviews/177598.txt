The first time I made this, found it to be a little plain. Made it again today but chopped up 1 large red onion and some fresh garlic (were big on both, but anyone could suit it to taste). Browned it slightly with just a splash of olive oil than added ground beef and some seasoning. Overall good recipe!

I thought the recipe was good start but I always add extra stuff to mine. I chopped up onion and fresh garlic and waiters with beef, then with store bought sauce I always add my own stuff, I put some fresh garlic, itlian seasoing and parmesan cheese in the sauce before mixing it with everything else. Came out soooooo delicious my husband loved it and my older daughter hates peppers but loves this

These were super easy and tasted good...but i agree with the rest.  A bit bland.  I added S&P, some onion, and 2 garlic cloves when browning the meat as well as some chili powder and some hot sauce.  Then topped with a mix of cheddar and motz cheese.  Very good...but still a bit bland.  Next time i might try a roasted garlic sauce or something...or just kick up the mixture with some more chili powder, cayanne, and a bit of cumin.

These turned out wonderful!  I skipped the rice and threw in a half coup of oats, also I added two cups of shredded cheddar in the meat mix along with garlic salt.  I topped them with at the beginning of the baking with mozzarella and Parmesan.  Even my 3 year old loved them!

Very tasty!  I used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella, otherwise I think it would have been a bit bland.

I added some spice.  Cooked ground turkey in minced garlic and chili powder.  Then added a dash of hot sauce and red cayenne pepper to the sauce. It was not overpowering, but delicious!

These were delicious! My husband absolutely loved them and proclaimed this recipe a keeper. The only thing I did differently was to add about 3 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic into the ground beef after browning, as we love garlic. I also used red bell peppers because I couldn't find enough green ones at our local produce stand and my husband prefers the red to the green peppers anyway due to their sweeter flavor. And, I used a combination of sharp cheddar and a mexican blend of cheeses that I had on hand. The peppers smelled so good while baking. I will be making these again soon.

Good starter dish, but very bland. Needs a lot of tweeking....a lot. Will make it again, but will change it up.
