This is a  very good recipe, minus the aspartame. I used 1/4 cup of agave nectar sweetner instead of aspartame. Aspartame has been found to cause brain cancer, and other types of cancers. Please try and always use natural sweeteners like honey, maple syrup, or agave nectar to replace sugar. Agave nectar registers the lowest on the glycemic index chart, and it has a very sweet taste, so less agave nectar used in recipes give your desserts a sweet taste, and it replaces the sugar nicely, and the taste is wonderful!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

With the holidays coming around, my diabetic sister was getting a bit forlorn as she loves Pumpkin Pie. I decided to try this recipe - and I made a low-fat whole wheat crust myself - and it was pretty good for a sugar-free dessert. I found that it had an odd aftertaste, but it was delicious anyway. And my sister thought so too, but of course she doesn't have the privilege of indulging often. The only changes I made - aside from making the crust myself - was that I used egg beaters to cut some extra fat. I also used granulated splenda, as that's what I have (1 packet of artificial sweetener = 2 tsp granulated splenda) With that, and using skim evaporated milk, I was able to come up with a pie that totaled about 133 calories, 4 grams of fat, 8 grams of sugar, 18 grams of Carbohydrate, and healthy vitamins out the wazoo! I may try another recipe, or tinker with this one to see if I can get rid of the aftertaste.

Wow!  I was a bit dubious about this recipe because it's a no-bake.  The texture turned out to be like any other pumpkin pie!!  I'm completely surprised how good this pie is... Because it's no bake, there is no real bitterness from the sweetener.  I used splenda.  After I added the splenda, the filling had a tiny bitter after-taste... not too detectable.  However, once it set, the bitterness was gone.  Next time, I will wait until the filling is at room temp to add the splenda.  I used a store bought graham cracker crust... so 1/8 of pie only had 27 carbs total... very satisfying, too!!  Wonderful!! Thank you so much for the recipe!

The pumpkin filling texture felt greasy in the mouth. The mixture setup fine  but the greasy film it left in the mouth was disgusting.
