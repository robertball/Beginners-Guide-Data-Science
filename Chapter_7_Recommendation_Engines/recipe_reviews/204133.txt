Hi - I'm the recipe submitter. I just noticed that a reviewer says you should squeeze out the moisture from the potatoes and onions. While most potatoes kugels include this step, one of this recipe's secrets is that you keep the moisture in - it makes for an exceptionally moist kugel. So leave it all in, even it the mixture looks watery.

It can't get much easier than this, and delicious too! Shredded onions, then potatoes in processor with fine shredder. Changed to the blade, added everything else, a few pulses and WAH-LAH it was done.  I did however bake it in an oiled 9x13 that was heated first, before putting the mixture in a 400 deg. oven for 1 hour. Tasted it as soon as it came out of the oven & it was TDF, with a very crispy brown top and a creamy inside. Had to go to another room before I would eat it all. Thanks so much for sharing.

My mother-in-law made the best potato kugel I ever ate.  She would NOT share her recipe with anyone. My husband and sons loved it, and I tried over the years to duplicate it without success.  This recipe comes closest. One trick she had that I do know is to broil the kugel for 5 to 7 minutes before baking.  I broil it with the plan close to the broiler element, then lower the heat and move the pan down to the middle rack.  Give a beautiful top and bottom crust with a creamy inside.

This is great! I made this for Passover and substituted some celery root so it was about 50/50 with the potatoes. It helps cut down the glycemic index and also adds vitamin K, not to mention some great flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and it was a hit!

I used this recipe as a base for a kugel that was so easy to prepare & came out excellent.  In the REFRIGERATED section of the supermarket I bought 2 bags of Crystal Farms Simply Potatoes, Shredded Hash Browns (no excess water, no excess work). Used a very large Spanish Onion and I used peanut oil in lieu of vegetable oil. Because a 9x13 pan would have made too much for just me and my husband, I used 2 disposable alumiminum 9" round pans greased very well with the p. oil. One for now & one for later. Grated onion in food processor then added eggs (beaten)oil, salt, pepper and one bag of potatoes. Pulsed 'till mixed NOT OVERMIXED. Transfered to a large bowl & added 2nd bag of potatoes as is, mixed by hand until all ingredients incorporated. Divided in the two pans.Fluffed top with a fork so shredded potatoes could crisp up.  Placed on cookie sheet. Placed in preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, then lowered to 350 for 1 hour until nicely browned and crisp on top. May need additional 20-30 minutes depending on your oven. My husband couldn't wait to eat it because it smelled fabulous while baking.  He ate it hot out of the oven.  Tasted better to me when cooled.  Crisp on top and softer in the middle.  REALLY DELICIOUS and so very easy to prepare.  I have no alternative to suggest if you can't find the refrigerated shredded potatoes except to do it from scratch.

My old family recipe agrees with the submitter's version, don't drain the liquid because it adds so much flavor and the additional potato starch makes a real difference.  I made one kugel exactly per the recipe and a second with the addition of one third cup of matzo meal, both were excellent wit the second being a tad drier.  The drier version worked well with brisket and the creamier version was perfect on its own.  Thanks for a great trip down memory lane.  Bravo!

In order to keep the potatoes white, alternate potatoes and onion when shredding in the food processor. It does the trick! Mine came out creamy colored and delicious.

I followed some of the other suggestions that were made in other reviews and the kugel came out fabulous.  I soaked the potatoes in cold water prior to cutting and shredding and rotated them with the shredding of the onions.  This kept the kugel very white.  I also broiled the top for the first 10 minutes and then baked the rest of the way as stated in the recipe.  However, an hour into baking, I realized that I never added the vegetable oil to the egg mixture!  The kugel came out great - super tasty and with less fat!!

Made this for Passover and it reminded a friend of her grandmother's; it made her teary!  Everyone enjoyed it.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed.

Good standard kugel recipe.  Make sure you squeeze out the moisture from the shredded potatoes and onions before adding the eggs and oil.

All I can say is OMG!!!  Potato Kugel is one of the few recipes I didn't get from my grandmother before she passed away.  This tastes just like it!  I did add some matzo meal - about 3/4 cup - just to help bind it and it was perfect.  And BTW, when I make potato latkes, I don't drain the potato/onion liquid either.  They're more moist and flavorful.

This recipe turned out great, just like my mother made 60 years ago. She was a cook for Jewish families and learned the recipe from them. Combining the grating of the onions with the potatoes kept the potatoes white. Thanks for the tip.

Delicious.  Because I kept the potatoes in water while they were waiting to be grated, I poured off about half a cup of liquid before baking, but it still came out wonderfully moist.

I have made this several times and each time it is a hit.  Just today I made it for a brunch instead of having to mess with home fries and there was none left.  I don't change anything except I usually pulse the onion until it is chopped very fine rather than grate it.

Yep - potato kugel! I only had one onion to grate so I added some onion powder to compensate. I also added garlic powder - I think a tspn of each. I strained the spuds and onion just a bit (not as much as when making latkes). Baked at 400* for an hour made it pretty dark on top. Good basic recipe!

It was just wonderful.  I changed the recipe a bit.  I shredded the potatoes and onions in my food processor.  They looked like hash brown potatoes.  Also I used my convection oven.  The oven temp I lowered to 325.  It only took 40 minutes to cook.  Crispey and moist.  Would make it again.  Thanks so much

Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly, and was so pleased.  The result is creamy and well-balanced.  The top was a little grey (as someone had mentioned), but really, who cares?  This stuff is YUM.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to follow.  I added four large carrots (shredded) to add a bit of color and flavor.  I cooked for 90 minutes (at 325) with a turkey breast and 30 minutes (at 375) without the turkey.  The kugel came out just perfect, including a slightly browned top.  And, it was wonderful to eat it cold the next day, too.

This is my family's recipe too!  It's the same recipe I use for Chanukah latkes.  If you have extra batter, try baking some in a muffin tin (spray or oil first) - we always loved that as kids.

This is how I make my potato kugel, but I don't add oil to the mixture. I usually add as many eggs as potatoes instead. Grated potatoes and onions with salt, pepper and eggs always turns out great. Add garlic for extra flavor.

I have been making this recipe for years now and I love it. One thing that has always bothered me is what size potatoes? every time I make it, it is slightly different,  this time I weighed the potatoes and will adjust next time based on how it comes out.Then in the future I will know how many pounds I need.

Scaled this down to one egg since I was cooking for myself. This made for a good side dish with pork steak. Used red onion because that's what I had, and three little potatoes. Really good. Definitely will make again. Since I made so little, it spread over the bottom of the pan in a thin layer, and I folded it into three like how you would an omelette for a pretty presentation.

I thought this was really, really good.  It got some mixed reviews, but it may be because I used two very large onions.  I thought it resembled a creamy latke.

I made this last night as a trial for Rosh Hashannah. Does not taste like a proper kugel...more like hash browns. The onions are overpowering. If you make this, I strongly recommend draining the potatos & onions and even more strongly recommend you don't make this recipe.

I thought this was pretty decent, but lacked a little in flavor. Went very well though with the Slow Cooker Salibury Steak from this site. I cut this down to 5 servings for my husband and I. Thanks for the recipe!

While my dish came out of the oven looking yummy, I was very disappointed by how bland it tasted. Some reviewers felt the same while others found it too salty!  I used the recommended amount of salt, but I used regular table salt. My hunch is the ones who found it to be too salty used kosher or rock salt. I may be making it again this afternoon and if I do, I will definitely be spicing it up!

It is much better when you use a strainer to get rid of liquids. Also, Baking covered for 1:15, then 45 uncovered +5 minutes broil seems to bring out the deep smoky flavoured a good kugel has.

perfect!!   followed the recipe exactly, and it got rave reviews.  i should have read the recipe ahead of time, because i was surprised by the long cooking time.  would have been easier to manage my dinner party by making this ahead.

April 30/16 - I made the Kugel for the very first time for our second Sedar.  If you want the potatoes to be kept white, you should put them in the sink in cold water.  The only ingredient I cut in half was the black pepper.   My family were very impressed, especially me!!   My husband suggested that the next time I make it, not to peel the skin from the potatoes.  I will try his suggestion and let you all know.  My daughter-in-law suggested that this recipe can be made anytime during the year.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  It certainly made a big hit.  Debbie Ross

I made it exactly as described, peeling and grating potatoes last.  This does keep the mixture a creamy white.  So delicious!

I brought this dish to a Seder last night and it received rave reviews.  There were also no leftovers which is always a good sign that everyone enjoyed it.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used the bagged hash brown potatoes and it was so simple to make.  I will definitely make this again

This recipe was awesome! I found that it was to much salt, so instead of two teaspoons use 1 But otherwise it was great! Thank you!

This was good, but it a little greasy.  It also had little bit of a weird flavor. However. It does have potential.

This is a delicious potato kugel recipe. Not squeezing the liquid out of the grated potatoes is genius. I hand blendered the onion and cuisinart grated the potatoes. Love me some of this potato kugel!!!

Texture was perfect and tastes very close to perfect as well! It was a tad bit onion-y though, so I would just recommend using just 1 onion instead. Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe and baked it in a pie plate.  Next time I will use a bit less onion.  Very easy to make and the family enjoyed it (even WITH a bit of a heavy onion flavour).  I am looking forward to making it again with my adjustments.

I used the Vitamix to shred the potatoes and onions - worked perfectly and super fast!! Did potatoes as a wet chop (started on 1 and went to 2/3 for about 5 seconds total - did about 2 potatoes (quartered) at a time. Onions did as dry chop went up to about 3, about 5 seconds total. Super fast and easy and came out perfect.

Absolutely delicious and even better the next day. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and these seem to work well because of their moisture content. I actually will double the salt and onions next time but I think it's just a matter of differing taste buds. I had sour cream on the side as suggested by the author and yum! I love this as a main dish because of the eggs! Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was a very good and very easy recipe.  I have never made a potato kugel before but this was delicious.  That being said, I have to say it was the most unattractive recipe I ever made.  I do not need my food to be pretty but it should at least look appealing.  The potatoes turned grey from oxidization, obviously this is no fault to anyone except the potato ;o)  A friend told me that I should soak the grated potatoes in milk to prevent them from changing color.  I am going to try that next time.
