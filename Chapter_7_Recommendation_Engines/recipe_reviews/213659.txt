Quick, easy, and delicious - perfect for a weeknight meal! I did use minced garlic vs. garlic powder and decided to make homemade guacamole vs. just mashing the avocados.  I used "Pico de Gallo" by Rachel Love from this site and reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese. Great recipe and while I'm used to "Mexican-style" tacos, these were a really nice change. Thanks for a great recipe Chefbound!

We eat at least one version of this weekly. One of the few meals I don't get complaints from the kids. Instead shouts of "Yea! taco night."

Very simple but sometimes the most simple ingredients combined together turn out the best foods. I made my own pico de gallo. I ate my dinner early because I had to work and I really enjoyed it. The only change I made was used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I think me making homemade pico de gallo was what made it so good. Simple and delicious!

This was great! I made a few adjustments though. I put the sour cream and avocado on the side. I stirred in some fat-free vegetarian re fried beans to the turkey for extra flavor. Also added black olives as an optional side. Hubby loved it and had 4 huge tacos full!

These were perfect for what I needed tonight. While I typically prefer a more seasoned and spicy taco, my surprise guests like it way more mild. I was already planning on turkey tacos, "my way", but had to change my plans quickly. So, I put away the hot peppers, and tried this recipe. I tried one to make sure I thought everyone would be happy. In the end those of us who like spicy will be able to add hot sauce, and everyone at the table is happy!

This is a great recipe!  My husband came home to dinner almost done and he thought we were having just bland turkey tacos, He was quite surprised by the flavor!  We all were.  Definitely a keeper

I basically used this receipt as a guide so my hubby could get the ingredients from the store.  I added tons of cumin.  After the meat browned, I added fresh lemon juice and fresh cilantro chopped.

These were good, but I didn't have any pico de gallo which probably would've made it great. If I make these again, I'd make guacamole instead of just mashing the avocados. It was a big hit around here!
