For some reason, I did not have high hopes for this recipe. But I was wrong! This is simple, QUICK, delicious, and CHEAP! All things that I love!!
I followed the recipe exactly as-is. I used Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix. MMMM!
It does not have to set very long for the flavors to marry. I was worried that the green onions would make it too oniony. They did not! In fact I wished I'd added more. They're great chopped in big pieces. I put it all in a pumpernickel round, and served it with the cut up pieces of pumpernickel, as well as some sliced french bread that I drizzled olive oil over, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and toasted in the oven very lightly. I also served it with tortilla chips. It was all delicious, and this is something I'm DEFINITELY adopting as my new never-fail. So cool! 
Edit 3-5-08: I started doubling the spinach, and like it even more that way! Makes it more of the typical consistency I was used to. Also, I tried it with the Knorr Leek Soup instead of their vegetable, and didn't care for it, so it may be an acquired taste. I'm going to stick w/the vegetable.

Love this recipe!!  One of the few that I leave as is.  It's been a Christmas tradition in my house for as long as I can remember.  We also serve it in a hollowed out king's hawaiian bread.  The bread's sweet flavors work well with the dip.  One hint so you don't end up with soggy bread is to hollow out the bread so that it perfectly fits a paper or plastic bowl and then stick the bowl in the bread and fill with dip.  This way you'll be able to save the dip and the bread when the party is over.

Very easy!  BUT I would certainly reduce the mayo and sour cream.  I used about half of what was called for and it was plenty creamy!!

Spinach dip has been a long time family favorite at our house.  Not everyone here likes water chesnuts though so I leave them out.  The dip tastes just as great!  Also, we used regular chopped yellow onions...just as good!  Another hint, you don't just want to drain the spinach, it works best if you actually "squeeze" the excess water out of it as well.

The recipe is wonderful!  AND by the way, you can replace the chestnut with Jicama!  Wonderful taste with the same crunch and feel as chestnuts with a better taste, or at least to me...and I reduced the sour cream down to 8 oz./1cup to be the same amount as the mayo...OPTIONAL --- Add 3 pounds of chopped cooked (we use grilled) chicken breast and two handfuls of chopped dried cranberries and you will have some of the best chicken salad EVER!

This is my favorite appetizer recipe! I prefer to make it with the Leek soup mix instead of the Vegetable mix and also add a minced garlic clove. For best results I make it the night before and refrigerate overnight to help the flavors meld. Everyone is always asking me to bring it to parties and it disappears every time. I usually buy sliced sour dough bread and cut it into bite-size pieces to eat it with and serve it in a sour dough bread bowl.

I have made this for years.  Key is to squeeze out the spinach until it screams. The tradition in this region is to hollow out a loaf of sweet Hawian bread, put the dip in the hollow; slice the bread you removed into small rectangles and use as dippers. mmmmmmm....scrumptious.

I use the same recipe except I use the Knorr Leek soup mix, much better and more flavor in my opinion that the vegetable one.

I used reduced fat sour cream/mayonnaise. I made no other changes or substitutions. For me, I thought it had a little too much sour cream/mayonnaise. I'd like to make this again but I'd increase the spinach and water chestnuts. I think I'd add some garlic powder next time, too.

This is amazing!  I have been making this recipe for quite some time now, and everyone makes sure that I make it for potlucks and parties (I usually have to quadruple the recipe to make enough for everyone).  The best veggie soup mix I have foud, is Lipton Recipe Secrets (I originally found the recipe for spinach dip on the back of their package, excluding the green onions).  One thing that I learned from Rachel Ray - instead of just draining the spinach, wring it out in a clean kitchen towel over the sink to get as much liquid out of it as possible.

I make this prob. 4 times a month. Don't use as much mayo (a little over 1/2 a cup is enough). I like to add more green onions. I make a lighter version with lite sour cream and lite mayo and no one can tell the difference. DO NOT USE FAT FREE MAYO OR SOUR CREAM. I did that once and it looked like it was curdeling. I had to throw it out! Best on the second day to let the soup mix soak into the other ingredients. I like to eat with fresh vienna loaves! mmmm, gonna make another batch for this weekend. Friends always ask for this

This recipe is very similar to one in my cookbooks, and I bring it to every one of our big family gatherings. Usually we substitute green onions for shallots and serve in a hollowed out pumpernickel loaf. Makes a lot, and is SO good. Try grating some fresh parmesan over the top.

WOW! This stuff is GOOD! I made no alterations to the ingredients other than use fat-free sour cream and low-fat Hellman's mayonnaise. I will definitely be using this over store bought ANY day! Thanks for the recipe!

This has got to be one of my all-time favorite appetizers.  I serve mine in a bread bowl (rye if I can get it/make it) otherwise French bread works well too.

Always a favorite at family gatherings. On occasion I have added bacon bits (2/3 cup), and if you are desperate and don't have water chestnuts, you can dice up celery in it's place (1 cup cut fine). Celery adds the nice little crunch that is decidedly delicious!

Good but you definitely need to make it ahead of time and let the flavors meld in the fridge for a few hours.  Over night is even better.  Otherwise all you taste is the dry soup mix.

I think the green onions make this dip really good.  I usually make it the day before and leave it in a strainer over another bowl in the fridge for a while.  I have used onion soup mix and leek soup mix when all out of vegetable and that turns out just as good.

This is my favorite spinach dip, it's the one from the Knorr vegetable soup package, anyway I always use 1 (16oz.) bag of chopped spinach and no green onion.
The best!

Hawaian bread and vegetables surround this dip at our parties.  Hubby says he doesn't like water chestnuts (I didn't tell him they were included) and he loves this dip anyway.

This recipe is just AWESOME. It's a quick and easy fix for those office potlucks. I served mine with crackers and people here at work INHALED it. I also used low-fat sour cream and low-fat mayo and no one could tell the difference.

Although it might sound simple to dump stuff together to make dip, a couple of tips to anyone interested.  The vegetable soup can have some rather large dehydrated flakes of veggies, so best to crunch those up first, before mixing everything together.  THe large chunks are not too appetizing when they rehydrate!  I also like to chop my chopped spinach after it's thawed and drained and squeezed to make sure the pieces are tiny enough that no one gets a blob of spinach!

This is one of my favorites. I've had it at many potlucks. This was my first time making it. The first time I had lots of time and made sure the spinach was completely thawed and squeezed completely dry and it turned out perfect. The second time I was trying to hurry and didn't get all of the water out. The dip was a little runny. Definitely key to get as much water out of the spinach as possible. Other recipes say to heat the spinach to make it easier to drain. I haven't tried that but might next time.

I use this recipe often,  BUT I don't use dry vegetable soup mix, I use Dry Ranch Dressing.  I also use light sour cream.  And I don't use mayonnaise, but use Miracle Whip.  I serve this with Amish Bread, it's a good combination.

Made this recipe exactly and served with Wheat Thins and Triscuits. It was a hit with our company. I took the left overs to the office and they were gone in less than an hour.

I have been making this recipe for about 12 years, and these are the changes/additions I 've made: To the existing recipe I add a 250 g brick of (only) Philly cream cheese, light, 2 - 3 cloves of garlic and about 1/2 cup of toasted slivered almonds. It's delish and always gets rave reviews!

This dip is always a hit! Only 12 ounces of sour cream is needed. Make sure to chill at least four hours before serving for the flavors to combine. I always make it the night before because it's so convenient!!

Great recipe! Perfect as-is, I guess that's why it's a "Classic"! I made this over the 4th of July.  I hollowed out pumpernickel bread and placed the dip inside. Everyone loved it! There wasn't much left over even though it makes a ton of dip.  It was absolutely delicious!

I've been making this dip for several years. I use 1 cup mayo and 8oz. of sour cream, (16oz. of sour cream seems a bit much.) I also use Knorr's powdered leek soup, and have never used the green onions. You can carve out the middle of a small, round french bread loaf and place the dip within the loaf.  Cut the bread that was taken out of the loaf into cubes and serve with the dip so nothing is wasted.  It is delicious; there's usually nothing left over but the crumbs!

I make all the time.  But there is a secret..  most people do not squeeze their spinach dry. Mine is "squeeky" dry. That is what make's it a success.  How many "runny" spinach dips have you endured. People ask me to make and I tell them they can make, but want me to make... The only diffence I make is if some people are onion intolerable.  I use fresh or dried chives.

I use Knorrs Leek soup and it makes it better. When I changed to that soup everyone started begging me to make it or for the recipe.  Try it - you will love it!

A friend of mine used to make this using an envelope of Knorr Garden Dill Dip (which looks to be a discontinued product), so I'll be trying to tweak it with my own dill mix since it was sooo good that way.  This is actually a Knorr recipe...

Best dip recipe ever! For a change, use Knott's Leek Soup Mix. I also sometimes make it with low cal sour cream and Miracle Whip.

Yummo!  This is easy and delicious and always a crowd favorite.  Next time I'll add more dried soup mix for a little more flavor OR cut down the amount of sour cream a little bit- I needed a little more FLAVOR (but I'm a spicy girl- I like a full explosion of flavor!)  We served this with chunks of bread and baby carrots for a party yesterday and I had some as an after school snack today.  This is a can't miss!!

I absolutely love this recipe!! Unfortunately, I can't get the vegetable soup (without vermicelli) in The Netherlands. What ingredients can I use to replace the soup mix? That would make me and a lot of friends extremely happy!

I have used this exact recipe, with the Knorr brand soup mix, and L O V E it!!!  Note:  don't usually like spinach, sour cream or mayo very much on their own, but together??  I could stick my whole face in the bowl, it's that good!!  If you are thinking of trying this recipe, DO IT!!!

I used "Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix" and only 1 1/2c sour cream. Very good! I too cut up a loaf of Hawaiian Bread for dipping and the entire thing was devoured. This was soooo easy to make (with great results) that I will make this again!

This is so easy and the water chestnuts add a lovely crunch. I love spinach some I have doubled the spinach and left the other ingredients the same and it still came out great.

I made this for thanksgiving dinner to hold my family over unitl dinner was ready.  It was a very big hit.  Almost too much so, everyone was getting full before the dinner was on the table.  Will make again and I didn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe. Those using RANCH are following a totally different rec.  The only thing I do different after all the years I've been making this is I only use a little more than a 1/2 cup of mayo, I find the spinach flavor comes out more. And I don't care for water chesnuts.

A classic recipe!  I have two recommendations.  First is to be sure to drain the spinach really well.  Squeezing between paper towels works great.  Second, use Hellmann's mayo, not Miracle Whip.  It's beautiful served in a hollowed-out round bread, with the bread served to dip in it.

I like the water chestnuts for the extra crunch.  This is the 'traditional' recipe that you remember!  Get the spinach very dry - otherwise, it'll make the dip stringy and soupy.

Very Yummy. I tasted this right after I made it and It was not very good, but after hanging out in the fridge for a few hours it was awesome! I usually add crushed red pepper, black pepper, seasoning salt and fresh garlic and I didn't have green onions so I used red. Delish

Definately double the spinach or else it will come out too creamy.  I keep everything else the same except I add 1/2 cup SHREDDED parmesan cheese and make it the night before so that it sits for about eight hours, not two.  Really, the extra time improves the flavor.  And do use all the water chestnuts called for--they impact the flavor very little but add a terrific texture.  Also, the best way to drain the spinach is to place (thawed) spinach between two large dinner plates and squeeze them together over the sink.  The liquid drains, leaving the spinach neat and dry.  I find this much less messy than actually "squeezing" the spinach.  I make this for all family events.  Everyone who tries this loves it!

Great recipe- my husband and family loved this. The only changes I made was using less mayo and adding about 3 oz of cream cheese and a couple squirts of ranch dressing.  Do be sure to follow other reviewers suggestions regarding squeezing out the spinach very well after thawing and letting the dip sit overnight if possible to soften the dried vegetables in the soup mix. Just before serving, it was a little too stiff for dipping crackers without breaking so I stirred in a little half-n-half to soften it up a bit.  Also great as a spread on bagels the next day.  Even if this is the recipe from the back of the Knorr package, I don't read recipes while grocery shopping so I appreciate the posting of this recipe.

I made a double batch of this for a party I just had and everyone raved about it.  I was hoping for some leftovers but it was all gone!  I served it in a bread bowl.  This is the best recipe I have found for spinach dip.

Made exactly as the recipe says and it turned out great!  This recipe is very similar, if not the exact same, to the one on the back of Knorr's Vegetable Soup mix...

My mother has been making this recipe for years and I used to hate it when I was little, but she brought it over for Thanksgiving last year and for some reason it tasted really, really good to me. I now make a batch every week or two and keep it in the fridge to snack on with club crackers or cucumbers slices. I use 1/3 cup of finely chopped yellow onion instead of green onions, and I reduce the mayo and sour cream by almost half. I have also added feta crumbles which is awesome. I made it once without water chesnuts because I was out - it tasted the same, but I do like the crunch that they add. Definitely use the Knorrs veggie soup mix.

I followed the recipe as written though doubled the receipe as it was going to be taken to a large gathering. Taste was good, texture was good as well, though next time I may add more waterchestnuts.

I've been making this forever. I use a packet of Ranch dressing powder mix instead of the dry veg. mix. Also- use one cup of sour cream instead of 16 ounces. It Tastes delicious, and is a family favorite.  I usually get two loafs of bread one to cut up, and one to hollow out for the dip. My favorite bread to use is a Garlic Tuscan bread.

Awesome! We actually made the night and chilled all night before an afternoon party. Added another spoon of sour cream to whip up, then bring to room temp to serve.  Put out veggies and bagel crips and there was none left!  thanks fro the keeper.

This was really good and I was asked for the recipe by 3 different people.  I did make a few variations.  I made it without water chestnuts and green onions, only because I didn't have any.  I will experiment with that another time.  I did use Knorr Vegetable Soup mix and I added 1/2 pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  Excellent dip!

I've used this recipe for years, and it's always a hit. I use yogurt instead of sour cream, and just add maybe 1/2 cup of mayo to cut the sour bite of the yogurt. When I have made this dip with sour cream, I've found the mayo completely unnecessary. But I'd never omit the water chestnuts - they make this dip addictive.

I have made this many times and it is always a hit.  I have always used the Knorr vegetable soup mix.  Good with those little slices of party rye bread.  I'm thinking of using a hollowed out round loaf of rye bread next time.

Great recipe. No changes are needed, as the recipe is fine as is. However, I felt like something a little different and so I added some finely chopped sundried tomatoes and garlic and it turned out wonderful ! A huge success!

I have used this recipe many times. I also use Knorr's Vegetable Soup Mix. It is especially nummy when you add a cup of either shredded or finely shredded cheddar cheese. I hollow out a round sourdough bread bowl and use the bread for dipping.  Delicious!

This recipe is one of the best as far as spinach dips go.  The water chestnuts add to the texture making this dip a great crowd pleaser.

I love the Knorrs veggie dip!!  I am so glad a friend told me about this recipe.  The crunch of the veggies and chestnuts is wonderful.  I used fresh spinach, about a 10 oz bag.  I think the mayo is too strong so next time I will be using plain Greek yogurt and sour cream.  Healthier, too, anyway.  Yummy!!!

I love this recipe. I got it from a friend about 20 years ago but lost it in my last move. I was so happy to find it here.
Don't let the water chestnuts scare you. They just dd a nice crunch and freshness to the dip. I never have any leftover when I put this one out.

I brought this dip to a friend's house last night for an appetizer and everyone loved it, including my husband and I!  I have never made a spinach dip and it was such an easy and delicious recipe. I thought the water chesnuts really made it.  I served it in a hollowed out round pumpernickle bread.  I cut another pumpernickle bread for dipping.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I made this for Superbowl, and I didn't have any soup mix, so I used two (7 oz) dry Italian dressing packets.  I also doubled the spinach.  It was really good, and a big hit, but I will try it how it was meant to be made and compare.  But, it was wonderful in a pinch!!  I also made it with the spinach still frozen and it was fine...kept it extra cold for traveling to the party...

This is my go-to recipe for spinach dip; I decrease the mayonnaise by 1/2 but use full fat sour cream and mayo since it tastes better.  I skipped the green onion since my sour cream had chives in it.  we couldn't wait the two hours because it was too good! :)

I recently had a spinach dip that Costco sells that was delicious, so I searched for a similar recipe.  This one was GREAT!  My only suggestion is to chop your chopped spinach even more.  The spinach was still a little stringy.

Love it!  Served with tortilla strips the first time, and the second time i had some with Hawaiian bread and LOVED it, so I think I will continue serving with Hawaiian bread!  I also left out the water chesnuts the first time and the dip was a hit either way.  The second time i made this, I made a few changes: I added Jicama instead of the water chestnuts and decided its just better without and i used half low fat mayo and half regular... couldn't tell the difference really.

Simple and effective.  For a twist, I took out the vegetable soup mix and water chestnuts, and added feta cheese and roasted red pepper.  I served the dip with homemade pita chips (pita bread cut into triangles, tossed with coarse salt and olive oil, and baked in a 350F oven for about 10 minutes), and it was a huge hit!

I added one more green onion than called for because mine were pretty small. Turned out perfectly. Make sure to squeeze out the spinach thoroughly.

Made this, as stated in recipe, but used low-fat mayo.  Came out just fine.  I served this w/plain water crackers, after chilling the dip for at least 2 hours.

This is the dip in the back of the Knorr Veggie Soup Mix envelope!!!  It is not great - not gross or inedible, but not good either.  The dry soup mix pieces stayed crunchy and the spinach had an earthy flavor that was not tasty.  I will not make this again.

Not the best I have had. I would reduce the mayo and sour cream like other reviews have suggested. I used about half of what was called for and it was plenty creamy, and made it a lot better and more flavorful.

This was fantastic. Instead of the soup mix, because I didn't have any on hand, I substituted a tiny bit of the mayo and sour cream for ranch dressing, and I threw in a few pinches of a hodge podge of spices. For something healthier, I recommend subbing the sour cream for nonfat plain yogurt, which has about the same texture and a flavor that will be just as overpowered by the other flavors of the dip. This one's a keeper!

Excellent recipe and very easy to make. This is much tastier than the kind that you can purchase pre-made at the store.  The Hawaiian bread is a must-serve with this dip.

Easy to make, and excellent flavors.  Served it in a pumpernickel round and there were no leftovers.  Used the idea from another post to put the dip in a bowl and cut the hole in the bread to accommodate the bowl.  Will definitely make again.

I always use Knorr brand when I make this recipe.  I chop and add both the white and green part of the green onions.  The EASIEST way to squeeze your spinach dry is to defrost it in a bowl in the microwave (or on the counter if you have a lot of time) and place the spinach in a clean dish towel and ring out the liquid.  I hollow out a loaf of sweet Hawaiian bread and put the dip inside the bread bowl just before serving.  I cube up another loaf for extra dipping bread and put out onion flavored crackers as well.  Update:  The store was sold out of Knorr brand so I used Lipton.  I picked out the freeze dried peas and added salt.  It tasted pretty close to the Knorr brand and could be used in a pinch.  :)

I Love this recipe. I did't have Mayonnaise this time so I used Miracle Whip, and I definitley don't reccomend it. I'm going to try to salvage it and make ham pinwheels in the morning with it I will let you know how that turns out. UPDATE: I ended up adding an additional cup of sour cream and about 2 more oz. of spinach, and it turned out great. Everyone said that they loved it.

SOOOOOO GOOD. I definitely make it as-is, but I do add a little bit of minced garlic. I also prefer to refrigerate overnight and the flavors meld very well. This is just the best dip ever!!! Goes well with just about anything.

I used only 1/4 cup of light mayo and completed with fat free plain yogurt, it tasted very good. Next time I will use only 1/2 envelope of dry vegetable soup in order to reduce sodium and because I thought that was too strong. Other than that this was great, a keeper.

This stuff ROCKS!  I served it with crackers at a baby shower and some of the guests said it was the best spinach dip they'd ever had.  I gave it four stars because I felt that 1/2 cup was entirely too much mayo.  I instead added 1/2 package of cream cheese, which I think helped give it a flavor boost.

Spinach dip is one of my favorites, and this was my first time making it!  Used 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup cream cheese.  Because it was just me and my BF, I decided to make open faced bagel sandwiches with Everything bagels, melted Cooper Sharp cheese, a layer of spinach dip, sliced Roma tomatoes, and a sprinkling of fresh ground pepper.  So yummy!

This is a good base recipe - there's one similar on the back of the Lipton Vegetable Soup Mix packet. I changed it up a little. I skipped the green onions (but added a little minced garlic), cut the mayo in half and replaced it with cream cheese. I think I also added a little parmesean and a squirt of lemon juice. It was a big hit at the company luncheon! Make sure you drain the spinach well and don't skip the water chestnuts. Serve with Wheat Thins.

I have made this over & over again and everyone raves about it.  It's easy made.  You must drain the spinach really well before using it.  When it's watery, well needless to say, it's not as good.  I have let mine set 2 hours in the frig before serving and it's just fine but longer is better.

I've made this twice now and people are so impressed. I leave out the water chestnuts because I can't find them at the shop. I'm thinking next time I will add some cut up artichoke hearts just to make it different.

This was easy and very tasty! I substituted the veggie dip mix with onion dip mix and it came out just as good. I also let the water chestnuts soak a bit prior to putting them in to get the "canned" taste out of them. Easy and great with veggies or crackers!

LOVE this recipe!  I've been making it for years and it's a family favorite.  We think it tastes best with Hawaiian bread, but good whole wheat crackers work well too.

I gave it four stars because although I appreciate the water chestnuts (gives it texture), I believe it tastes better with Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix instead of the one suggested. Also, I use fresh spinach, hollow out a 2 lb. round sourdough to serve it in and cut up a few baguettes instead of crackers, which only adds more salt (and it's already pretty salty). Classy and quick.

My friend just introduced me to this recipe last night...it was delicious.  She adds her own twist to it by using fat free sour cream, and light salad dressing instead of mayonaise.  It gives it an extra zip. I believe she told me she uses twice the spinach so that it's thicker.  Also, in addition to the water chestnuts, she adds lump crab meat (not imitation).  I plan on making it myself this week!

I thought this was just OK.  It was a little too "mayonnaise" tasting in my opinion.  I might like it better with the Leek Soup mix as others recommended but I couldn't find that at my grocery store.

I've been making this for years!! I put it in a bread bowl and serve it with the torn up bread. I haven't tried the green onions in it but they sound good. Everyone loves it and scrapes the bowl clean! I usually use Korrs dry veggie dip mix because my mom alawys said it was the best! Yum

this is just one change away from the best spinach dip you will ever have, I PROMISE!  Switch the veggie soup mix to the LEEK soup mix, both are put out by Knor.  I haven't tried putting green onions in because leeks are so similar.  Let it sit overnight for best rehydration of the soup mix.  I do not care for the veggie (it makes it taste like it's from the deli)I have been making this recipe for 10 years now and my large family crowds around it until devoured at every function/get~together!

Old standard...I never measure exactly, but make sure to have more sour cream than mayo as it gives a better flavour. The water chesnuts add crunch.

This recipe is SO DARN GOOD.  I've made this for many pot lucks and parties, and everyone always asks me what did I do differently.  I guess the main difference is that some people use leek soup mix (that's what my mother used to use), but the vegetable soup mix is really the way to go!

Yummy!  I used about 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup mayo, and one bunch of fresh spinach, wilted and chopped.  I didn't have green onions, but I used 1/2 pkg onion soup mix and some dehydrated vegetable flakes.  Delicious with Ryvita crackers.  Will definitely make again.

Yum. My absoloute favorite spinach dip. My only problem was I thought it looked too mayo-ey so I added extra spinach. After setting for a few hours it was too thick to dip. That was my error though, and it was still yummy.

This dip was delicious! I used light sour cream and some chopped scalions in place of the green onions (which I forgot to buy).  I took it to work for an appetizer party along with cubed bread for dipping...the bowl was scraped clean long before the end of the party. This will be my standard spinach dip recipe from now on.

I served this in a hollwed out bread bowl and sliced the bread that I scooped out with an electric knife for a nice presentation for the dippers. I also add 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese from the grocery store, since that kind of cheese tends to be firmer than the kind you shred at home. I never have leftovers when I take this to a party.

Very good! Rinse the water chestnuts, it makes a difference.  Remember to stir again before serving, to make sure it's all blended.  I serve it in a hollowed loaf of Hawaiian bread with raw veggies as well as the bread AND crackers.

We make this dip, but we use a package of Ranch Dip mix instead of the soup mix.  Also add 1/4 cup finely chopped sweet red pepper.  We also serve the dip in a hollowed out pumpernickel bread, using the bread for dipping!  Can be served with raw veggies too.

I love this recipe. So quick, cheap and delicious. Tastes gourmet. I double the spinach, sour cream, seasoning and green onions and add 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper and salt. It is thicker and tastier and great for a group. I also chop the diced water chestnuts up more finely. The trick is to drain spinach in a fine colander then I smash with my hand and then smash using paper towels. This ensures a maximum water extraction. I have used Korr Veg dry seasoning and ranch seasoning as well. Both were great and I buy what is cheaper!

Excellent base recipe. Does need more spinach to sour-cream/mayo ratio though. That is why I only give it 4 stars. I cut back to 10 - 12 ounces sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo and this was plenty. Could have actually cut back more or used more spinach even at this lower ratio.

This was so delicious and I loved how the water chestnuts added that bit of crunch. The scallions were a nice addition too that gave the dip a bit of a bite. Yum! This was an Easter appy and I served it in the hollowed out tummy of a bunny bread I made. Everyone raved over this one and thank you!!

Since this is just like the recipe on the dry vegetable soup mix packet and it had such great reviews, I gave it a try for my first attempt at making spinach dip... Although it's absolutely perfect as-is, no need to change a thing, I used low fat sour cream and mayo, and 16 oz. of spinach because I prefer it that way. The flavor was so great that no one even noticed that I used low fat ingredients! I'll never buy pre-made spinach dip at the store again!

Not one time that I have made this have I had any to take home with me. I leave out the water chestnuts just because I can't stand the texture of them but other than that I leave everything else the same. Make this a few hours ahead so that your dry soup will soak up the moisture. I serve mine with King's Hawiian bread. Awesome.

I love spinach dip--I talked by hubby into trying this recipe by assuring him he wouldnt even know he was eating spinach.  I chopped my spinach again by hand before adding to the dip, but unfortunately still found the pieces were too big and it made the dip stringy.  I would run the spinach thru a food processor nex time to really get the pieces tiny.

I love this recipe! Very good! I made a few modifications though: I used a 16 ounce bag of spinach instead of 10 ounce bag (it's plenty creamy enough!), I used light sour cream and light mayo and reduced the amount of mayo to 1/2 cup, I substituted dry onion soup/dip mix for the vegetable soup mix (didn't have any vegetable soup mix  on hand), and I left out the green onions. Then I used a cheese grater to grate up about 12-15 baby carrots and added them to the dip. These changes made the recipe healthier, but still very yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this forever and I love it. I never add water chestnuts but it tastes great anyway. The recipe is in the back of Knorr Vegetable Soup mix.

This was fantastic. I forgot what a good combination of ingredients this is. I did follow another reviewers advice and put the dip in a small bowl in the center of the bread so it could be taken out and used again later without wasting the bread round.

I know this is the same recipe that's on the back of the Knorr soup mix, but I just had to leave a review because it's SO good and couldn't possibly be easier! Whenever I want that traditional spinach dip taste I grew up with I always whip up this recipe.

delish!! I made this for thanksgiving dinner and everyone said this is what you will be bringing every year! and I'm making it today for our family Christmas party. This recipe is also the one on the back of the Knorr's veggie soup packet. I made it exactly the same as directed except no green onions and I didn't miss them at all!

Love this dip! It is the same as the Knorr recipe! I always check for negative reviews and since i knew i loved this one i was astonished it only had 4 and a half stars. I can't believe there were some many people who don't approve. Picky i suppose. We love it and i always take it to church events.

Great concept, completly wrong proportions.  I doubled the spinach (2 - 10oz containers) and only used 3/4 cup mayonaise.  It still tasted to sweet even after these alterations so I squeezed in the juice of one lemon.

Made this today and it is very good. As this is the exact recipe off of the package of soup mix for spinach dip I would not subtract anything from it. It's perfect the way it is. Thx for posting for those of us who might not be able to get that brand of soup mix =))

Superb ! I used less mayo. Just about 3/4 or less of a cup. Soo easy and wonderful tasting. Dipped carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, and italian bread in it. Big hit with guests.

This stuff is so expensive to buy in the store.  I made a huge batch of this for a party we hosted.  It tasted just the the store-bought version only better because I used organic spinach.  And it only cost one fifth of the price.  So happy to have found this recipe!!

This dip is always a hit when served! I serve mine in a hollowed out round country rye but insert a small bowl so I don't deal with soggy bread. This recipe is a keeper & a crowd pleaser!

This was delicious and so easy.  I used Lipton Veggie mix (has peas in it so I picked them out).  I'm going to try Knorr next time as suggested.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

Very delicious. I used two 10 oz boxes of frozen spinach, drained really well as other suggested. I added 1/2 cup more sour cream and used Lipton's veggie soup mix and it was really good!!

This dip was so good. I read some other reviews and did increase the spinach amount to 16 ounces. I also used the Knorr Leek Dry soup mix and I decided to chop two cans of water chestnuts. I substituted the sour cream and mayo with the light versions. This was still incredibly yummy and was much lower in fat. Nobody would ever know. It was a big hit at the party.

This recipe was the talk of my dinner party.  Everyone loved it!  I didn't add the water chestnuts, didn't really care for them.  However, I did reduce the sour cream to about half to 3/4 of the amount it calls for.  I also added fresh diced tomatoes.  IT was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!  =o)

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out GREAT! I was taste testing it before bringing it to the Superbowl party and I ended up eating a lot of it on my own. I served it with Ritz- vegetable flavored crackers. The flavored cracker seemed to overpower the dip so I would go for plain Ritz crackers next time or just bread cubes. Definitely would make again!

Had a larger bag of spinach than the recipe called for (not quite double) but followed the recipe for the rest.  Was very good, but next time will try the -cream cheese instead of mayo- suggestion of another reviewer...

I've made this recipe many times with one variation.  Replacing the mayo with an 8 ounce block of cream cheese really enhances the flavor and texture of the dip. This dip goes best with either pumpernickel or marbled rye bread.

This is the classic spinach dip (also available on the Knor Vegetable mix package). I made this for a Christmas Eve party last year and made it again for a football party last weekend.  It was a huge hit both times.  I served it with tortilla chips and French bread.

This is super yummy!  I used a Lipton Recipe Secrets vegetable soup mix.  It had a similar recipe on the box that called for only 8 ounces of sour cream.  I combined the two recipes, using less sour cream and mayonnaise than this recipe calls for, yet more than the Lipton recipe.  It is delicious!  Vary the amounts to get the consistency you like.

The bowl was scrapped clean! I made this for a big family meal and people could not keep their hands off of it. I did double the amount of spinach, as suggested by other reviews, and it was perfect. Very easy and a great appetizer that can be made the day before!

I love this dip!  it's great with bread and crackers.  My absolute FAVORITE thing to do with this dip is add chopped up chicken breast, dried cranberries, and maybe some nuts, and it's the BEST chicken salad you've ever tasted!

This was good.  People asked for the recipe.  Don't expect it to be like a warm, cheezy spinach dip.  It's more like a ranch dip with spinach in it.  But, great on veggies.

I dont get the 5 star rating here. The dip was really just ok. I added extra seasoning... otherwise would not have liked at all. It's an okay dip for the not-so-adventurous, but not that special. I used Knorr veggie soup/dip mix; this recipe is identical to the one on the back, by the way.  I did like the chopped spinach--a really nice texture/flavor.  I let it sit overnight...you cant serve it right after making or the dry soup is crunchy.  Definately needs more OOMPH.  I added garlic and seasoning salt.  Use your imagination, and give it that extra something.  At least it was EASY, and made a lot. My inlaws will not eat anything exciting or adventurous; they ate this dip :)

This is similar to a recipe that I have used for years.  Only differfence is 1 cup of sour cream and Knorr's Leek Soup instead of veggie soup mix.  It is an all time hit at parties piled into a round rye bread mold.  Ummm, I'm hungry just thinking about it.

OMG - NO ONE at my party didn't NOT like this dip.  They were eating it with veggies, with the Hawaiian bread chunks I tore up and the pita triangles I set out for the hummus!  It was a hit to say the least.

Good Stuff Maynard!! I always use Lite Sour Cream and Light Mayonaise(Best Foods Brand) and it comes out great. Can't taste the difference. I'm going to try the LEEK Soup mix next time. May even reduce the amount of mayonaise called for.

This was so delicious. Although I will try some other suggestions on the soup mix, I used the knorrs veggie mix and I found that even though it sat in the fridge for 3 hours before serving, some of the dehidrated veggies were a little crunchie. So next time I will try the leek soup mix instead. But besides that it was still super good!

After buying a terrible store brand spinach dip, I decided I needed to make my own.  This recipe was wonderful!  The only changes I made were; I used about 1/2 a cup of mayo, and about 3/4's of the 16oz sour cream.  I used low fat sour cream, leek soup mix, and I added some dried onions instead of the green onions.  So good!  By using a little less of the mayo and sour cream I saved some calories and also I like the thicker consistancy of the dip.  Thank you for sharing!

VERY good spinach dip! I did use leek soup mix as suggested by another reviewer, but otherwise made it as posted. I will say that I don't think you'd have to use all of the sour cream it calls for, but then, it doesn't hurt it to do so either. I will most definitely be keeping this recipe around, as it is an excellent spinach dip to serve at parties.

I made this and thought it was great, but I followed the directions exactly and it was a little watery.  Next time I will put in less mayo and sour cream, as recommended.  It was still pretty good though, just not the consistancy I wanted.

This is so good!  My mom has made this dip for as long as I can remember.  The only difference is she uses 1 c. sr. cream, 1 c. mayonnaise, one envelope Knorr leek recipe mix (makes a big difference), spinach, green onion and water chestnuts.  She bakes a round loaf, 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white flour and serves the dip in the hollowed out bread.... it's the bomb!!

one of my favorites! I like to serve it with sour dough, sometimes in a bread bowl. Kraft olive oil mayo is a great healthy variation and fat free sour cream. It is still wonderful.

Wow! How delicious and simple!
I think the quantities of mayo and sr. cream are just right seeing as I had just under the specified amounts and I wish it was a little creamier! But 5 stars none the less! yummm!!!!

My favorite spinach dip! I serve it in a pumpernickel bread bowl -- nice contrast of color -- and then buy and cube a second loaf for dipping pieces. (I also use the pieces from hollowing out the bowl, but just that amount runs out before the dip is gone.) Also very tasty with fresh veggies, especially celery and quartered mushrooms. Leftovers make a good sandwich spread the next day, toasted ala grilled cheese.

I am very disappointed in this recipe. It had almost no flavor and just didn't sit well on the tongue. My husband and I both tried it and decided that we couldn't possibly bring this to a potluck.

Great recipe, but I agree with previous comment. Use less mayo! Best combo after testing was one full container sour cream and one heaping tablespoon mayo. Yum!!!

I am no chef, but I made this for a party a few weeks ago, and it was a hit.  I was asked for the recipe a number of times.  The leek soup was difficult to find, but well worth the search.  I think it made all the difference.

This is a GREAT recipe. You can also find it on the back of the Knorr's vegetable soup mix box. I usually leave out the green onions and prepare it with fat-free sour cream and lowfat mayo, and you really can't tell it's low-fat.

I always make this but I use less mayo, I cut it from 1 cup to 3 tablespoons.  I also, use my food processor to mince up the water chestnuts -- much easier than chopping it up by hand.  And besides, cutting out a portion of the hawaiian bread bowl, I also grab a package of the hawaiian sweet rolls and cut those up to serve because the part I cut out is never enough.  I usually chill the spinach dip overnight as well.  Oh, and make sure you squeeze out all the excess water in the spinach -- I usually place it in paper towels and squeeze; that way you don't lose too much spinach down the drain when you just use your hands to squeeze it out.

Made this for a Christmas Day appetizer last year.  It wasn't bad, but I think I prefer a hot spinach dip.  I usually love water chestnuts in dishes, but didn't like them in this dip.

Yes, excellent recipe but don't you think in all fairness the recipe should read "1 envelope Knorr vegetable soup mix"? After all, it's their original recipe and you're plugging your product with it. Give them ad time too. LOL

Really tasty recipe!  I made a healthier version by using only 8oz of low fat sour cream and substituting nonfat plain yogurt for the mayo.  I've made this recipe with and without the mayo and can't tell the difference between the healthy and high calorie version.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. Next time I might add a little garlic powder for extra flavor. I served it with multigrain crackers. This would be good in a bread bowl, using the bread chunks instead of crackers.

It is very good & the amount of ingredients called for is perfect so I would not tinker with it.  Whenever I make this everyone loves it.

A classic, very easy and delicious. Much better homemade than from the deli.
I went a little lighter on the sour cream and mayo but didn't reduce by 1/2 as others suggested.
I used my food processer to mix and would suggest if you do the same to be careful not to over process.
Another hint, I used my mini salad spinner to drain my spinach, works wonderfully if you have one.

This is the best tasting spinach dip I've made. I used chives and didn't have any water chestnuts. I did make this a day ahead so it would have time for the flavor to develop. Very very delicious and a huge hit here!

I always buy a couple loafs of fresh french bread and then rip it in to small pieces.  It is good in a sour dough bread bowl as well.  Soooooooooo good, I make this all the time!!

This is my favorite recipe for this dip also , but I use Leek soup/dip mix instead of vegetable.  Doesn't have that dried garden taste.

I love this recipe - I have also made the spinach dip with dry leek soup which is also great; but, I actually prefer this one.

I make this one with 1 C. mayo, vegetable packet, 1 16 oz. container sourcream, and 1 fozen block of spinach (thawed and drained in salad spiiner).

Great, easy spinach dip!  Disappeared at our party.  Very creamy -- I used lowfat mayo and sour cream.  You could cut back on both to save calories and it would still taste good.

This is THE best spinach dip! I have always liked spinach dip but I never knew how to make it. This is so quick and easy to make and so so yummy! If I need the ingredients while at the store, I can just look on the back of the Knorr Vegetable soup mix. Thanks,I wouldn't have thought to look at that mix to find the recipe!

My Mom has made this recipe during the holidays forEVER and it is fantastic...hers is slightly different though. She omits the green onion and adds sugar(to taste, she doesn't measure) to make it slightly sweet and serves it with hawaiian bread and crackers. Once I was on my own, I had to make it at my house too. It's great!!!

I made this to bring to a party yesterday and while I agree it is excellent and got rave reviews, it IS the exact recipe that is on the back of the Knorr's package.  Thanks, though - I will definately add this to he keeper file.

We really liked this one. It's nice to serve it in a hollowed out bread bowl. We use King's Hawaiian Bread, and it's a great combo. We'll definitely make this one again. We used Knorr brand for the dried soup mix. Great for a party and very easy to make.

I first tasted this recipe when my sister-in-laws boyfriend made it and he never gives out recipes. Every recipe I tried just wasn't it, after he passed away I figured I'd never get a good recipe, this was THE RECIPE exactly like his, except we use Miracle Whip instead of Mayonaisse. Even my picky 3 year-old loves this dip. Thank you for the help

Exactly what my mom makes!  Instead of using the traditional pumpernickle bread, I slice flatbread into wedges.  Amazing with fresh flatbread!

Sometimes I add 1/2 cup shredded mozeralla cheese and mix it in, and top it with 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, and bake for approx 15 mins. Delish!

FABULOUS!!! I've made this a zillion times with Knorr Veggie soup mix and a hollowed-out round loaf of Hawaiian bread (try this, and you'll never go back, I promise!) To add some festive color for a Christmas table, I've often added a few Tbsp roasted red peppers from the jar, chopped...IRRESISTIBLE!

I'll admit, I wasn't sure what I'd get with a spinach-waterchestnuts-veggie-soup mixture... BUT IT WAS EXCELLENT! I forgot to take the spinach out, so I nuked it for maybe 3 minutes and then I wrapped it in a tea towel and squeezed all the water out. I used more like 1 1/4 cups of sour cream, maybe 2/3 cup of mayo, and 4 ounces of softened Neufchatel cheese (almost identical to cream cheese but with less fat). I bought the veggie soup mix in the bulk foods section, so I put maybe 2 or 3 TBS of it in, digging in the bag to get some of the seasoning out of the bottom. :) I only used two onions as my husband isn't too keen on them. We ate them with Wheat Thins... Ohhh, yum, yum! I think you could even use pretzels as dippers. What a great way to change a spinach dip. Thanks for sharing, Joyce!

This is always how I make it and it turns out great. Most people love how the chestnuts add a little crunch, I serve this dip with sourdough bread chunks. this recipe can use leek soup mix or vegetable I have used both. The mayo can be omitted or you can add as much as you prefere. This is an easy crowd pleaser.

Restaurant quality.  I prepared this for my mother's birthday party and received many compliments.  It's a terrific base to build from.  I didn't add a thing because it's great "as is," but look forward to experimenting with spices, garlic, and other ingredients down the road.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My mom used to make this for parties when I was a kid and I have made it myself for 20 years. This is always a hit, even with those folks that hate spinach. I usually buy a round loaf of bread, hollow it out, and place the spinach dip inside. Then I cube the bread and serve with the dip. Also, make sure that you use very sturdy crackers with this. Yummy!

I've been making this for years and its ALWAYS a big hit.  I serve it in a hollowed out round Hawaiian bread loaf with chunks of the bread and tortilla chips for dipping.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

This recipe is very good when put inside of the Hawaiian bread that has the middle removed to make a bread bowl.  Slice up the excess bread for the dippers.

To die for!  I suggest going all out, and using the regular sour cream and mayonnaise.  I have made this with the light versions of both, and it's just not as creamy.  It's a crowd pleaser!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite potluck dish.  Its easy and people LOVE it.  I make mine without the green onions and serve it in a pumpernickel bread bowl with the inside bread for dipping. YUMMY!  Also great with crackers or veggies.

Great recipe but made a few modifications.  I used a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach, cut down the sour cream a little, and used a package of zesty italian salad dressing instead of the vegetable soup.

It's okay. The Knoor leeks mix is better. My concern is  the 48 SERVINGS. That's ONE dip a person. People, be honest.

A good dip, but not exceptional. I would definitely recommend reducing the mayo content....a cup is way too much and would be all you can taste. I added extra sour cream and only a hearty squeeze of mayo. Sour cream provides both tanginess and creaminess, so the mayo just provides extra fat in this case. This is wonderful chilled and is a good way to sneak some spinach and dairy in. I used the Knorr's vegetable soup because it contained more natural ingredients and less preservatives than the leek mix as some reviewers suggested. This dip is certainly fit to serve to guests and bring to parties, but please cut down on the mayo!

Ok, I never do any recipe as it is written and I never review, because I don't believe that one should change up recipes and then not give 5 stars. I did modify. I used some cream cheese instead of mayo, but ended up adding in a little mayo. Love mayo on sandwiches, not so much in dips. My guess is that the proportion of creamy stuff to veges is pretty good if you really get that water out of the spinach. I used the 2 plate method and still wrung out more than a cup of water after that. I added roasted garlic, salt, and seasoned pepper. I used approximations from the recipe, but I can't tell you proportions, because, I am a to-taste cook (which is why I don't bake). I think I came pretty close to the recipe on the sour cream. I made a double batch for a party tomorrow and I am munching on some of it now even though the soup mix hasn't softened yet. I don't care if they like it, I'll eat what they don't. I am serving it in a pumpernickle bread bowl, with the hollowed out on the side, rye bread pieces and fresh Everything Bagel (good ones with salt) rounds. I don't care if it is a Knorr recipe. I wouldn't know about it if it hadn't been posted. I don't use Miracle Whip or lite or fat-free anything, ever. I love water chestnuts in general and especially in this. I would like to try it with the Hawaiian Bread - didn't read that until after I shopped. Thanks for posting this recipe. I can't wait to try it in the morning after it rests.

This was so easy to make and it is my favorite appetizer/dip. I bought sweet Hawaiian bread and it was amazing! I also added extra water chestnuts, but that is because I loved the added crunch since the bread was so soft.

Yum!  I could sit & eat this whole thing by myself so I'm glad I made it to take to a birthday party.  The only changes I made were using low-fat mayo & fresh chives from the garden.  I would usually use fat-free sour cream but after reading a review that said it looked like it was curdling, I decided to go with the full fat stuff -thick & creamy!  Make sure you completely ring out the spinach so all the liquid is gone & make it the day before you need it for the best flavor.  Don't skip the water chestnuts -they add a fabulous crunch & it just isn't the same without those little suckers!

So yummy! I even make this during the week sometimes when i'm dieting. If you double the spinach and use low fat sour cream and mayo it's actually fairly healthy as a vegetable dip.. and still declicious!

I added another 5 -6 oz. of spinach as others suggested and was happy that I did.  That seems to make the perfect balance of creaminess and spinach. Served in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  Great dip!

This dip was not what I was looking for at all. I didn't add the water chestnuts because I'm not fond of the taste, but it seemed off. I think it was the mayo. Anyways, won't be making this again, but thank you for sharing.

Wonderful! Left out the onions but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I used light sour cream and light mayo to cut down on the calories some and could not tell a difference. I took it to a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe. Really easy and really good!

I brought this to a party last night and it was a HIT! Everyone asked for the recipe. The only adjustment I made, was by adding an 8 ounce tub of cream cheese. It adds a really creamy texture and extra richness to the dish. Everyone loved it!

I made mine without water chestnuts and with onion mix rather than vegetable dip, but it still came out delicious. I also doubled the spinach, which I think was a nice touch. I served with tore hamburger buns, which were surprisingly tasty with it.

I made this for a super bowl party in a makeshift bread bowl. I took the advice of other reviewers and lined the bread with a real bowl and got nothing but complaints! Apparently, people LOVE the "soggy bread," so be sure you feel out your crowd first. Otherwise, a perfect dip--great with bread, chips or celery sticks.

I have never made this before but have always loved it when people brought it to parties.  I decided to give it a try and WOW!!!!!  I brought what was left to work the next day and the girls in the office tore it up!  One girl said she normally hates spinach dip but this was awesome!  I will definately make this again!

I was making this for a shower and realized I had mistakenly bought a ranch dressing mix instead of the veggie soup mix.  So I used it because it’s all I had and it came out great!  I had two gals that love spinach dip ask me for the recipe because they loved it as it was a bit different.  I told them what I did and they couldn’t believe it was a mistake.  I’m sure it’s great with the soup mix called for too.

A huge hit at the superbowl party. I used miracle whip instead of mayo and used only about half the amount, and it was plenty.  I am toying with the idea of using some fat free plain yogurt next time to supplement some of the sourcream/mayo.

This receipe is awesome. It's pretty much like the receipe on the back of Knorr Vegetable mix. I doubled the batch and it still didn't last long! I used a 10oz bag of fresh baby spinach finely chopped as well as one package of the frozen. Finely chopped six green onions and also added a small package of cream cheese. Can't ever have too creamy... and served with small sourdough baguettes brushed lightly with the olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly toasted.... YUMMY!

My family has been making this spinach dip since I can remember, and it is just wonderful!! I look forward to it for every holiday! We use 1 cup each of sour cream and mayonnaise and 1/4 tsp of grated onion. I will have to try it with the green onion. Recipes don't get simpler than this!

This is delicious! I just finished making it with the Knorr Leek Mix and added fresh chopped garlic. Put it in a hollowed out sour dough loaf. Taking it to a party tonight and I'm sure it will be devoured quickly.

Excellent. The only change I made was to use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because I had run out of the latter. It went very quickly.

YINGA! This is some dangerously good bread dip.  I used 2 packages of Aldi's dry dip mix (cheaper than Knorr's [even for 2 vs. 1 pkg] but smaller packages) and served it at a housewarming party with pumpernickel cubes and French bread slices.  Some tips:    Your spinach can be defrosted quickly in the microwave, wring it out in a green kitchen towel lined with 2 layers of paper towels.  Let your hubby twist and squeeze the heck out of it until it looks like algae;) I used 20 oz and it was tasty and a wonderful texture.  Lots of "spinach-haters" really inhaled it!    You can easily make this healthier by subbing olive oil style mayo and low fat sour cream - still outrageously good!    You can sub reg. white onions for the green - I used one small onion - apprx. 3/4 c. chopped.    Finally, I skipped the water chestnuts (dumb store nearby didn't have them) and it wasn't lacking at all - the onions added perfect crunch.    MMMmmm now back to my prized leftovers:)

This recipe is superb!!! If you can't locate this recipe, it is the same as the recipe on the bag of "Knorr" vegetable soup mix. I did make mine lower in fat, by using light sour cream and light mayonaise!

I've had this recipe in my box for awhile and am so glad I finally had the opportunity to try it. I just made some for a new year's party I'm going to tomorrow night. It is so good, I can't wait until the flavours meld more overnight. Only changes that were made was onion soup mix instead of vegetable soup mix (that's what I had on hand), reduced the sour cream to a cup and added an extra green onion. I thought it would be too onion-y because of the soup mix and extra green onion, but its perfect. Definitely making this one over and over again!

I made this dip for my 30th birthday party and it was an absolute hit!  People who had never tasted spinach dip and thought they never would raved about this awesome recipe.  I did use 1/2 pack of leek soup mix and chopped the water chestnuts really small.  This dish is fabulous!  I'm definitely keeping this on file for special ocassions.  New favorite for our family!

I love this recipe and so does everyone else I serve it to. The water chestnuts add a perfect light crunch. I always serve it in the hollowed out the center of a sour dough loaf with a sliced whole wheat baguette on the side. Delicious!

I've used Leek mix in the past and I think I liked that better, but EVERYONE at our family gathering gave this five stars when I made it as the recipe reads. I think it is better the next day, although there was barely any left the next day!! Delish!!

This recipe is on the back of the Knor vegetable mix package, but it is a winner! I actually put a lot less miracle whip (about 1/4 cup instead of a cup of mayo) and used a little less sour cream. This was veggie heavy but that's the way I like it.

This is the best spinach dip recipe that's not baked. Very good, but I believe it's the same as printed on the back of the soup mix.. Kind of a cheat. :) Anyhow, you could add more spinach if you wanted a thicker consistency. But flavor is great as is. My aunt always makes this with leek soup mix, and the one I made was BETTER, so DO NOT USE LEEK SOUP. It has weird pieces that almost break your teeth. Don't change a thing unless you prefer a bit more spinach, but leave everything else alone! :)

YUM, without the water chestnuts.  I did put water chestnuts in it once when I made it and didn't like it but I made it another time without and loved it.  I also served it with hawaiian sweet bread.  It was wonderful!

This recipe is perfect as written. I usually serve it in a sourdough bread bowl with wheat thins. Everyone loves this dip!

Followed directions exactly except used low fat mayo and low fat sour cream, nobody noticed.Thought I had made way too much for a bbq we were hosting, but it wound up being such a hit not a drop of it was left. Will definitely make again.

Let me preface my review with the fact that I had no idea dry vegetable soup mix had actual dry vegetables. I know it seems like a no brainer, but I thought it was more of a season thing.  While the flavor was good, the fact that the freeze dried carrots never really softened was bothersome.  I will make this again, BUT I will try an onion soup mix instead of the vegetable.

Well, I love cooking from scratch, but I have to say that this recipe wasn't what I was looking for.  The store-bought stuff is much better.

This is the best dip ever! The water chesnuts give it an amazing crunch! It's been a family favorite for years and my mother always makes it at our Christmas Eve party! I love it with rippled potato chips. It's even good as a spread on sandwiches and wraps. I make it when I need a taste of home!

I add a decent amount of green onions (2-3 stalks) and 50 % more spinach (1.5 frozen boxes).  I also use light mayo.  I have tried both light mayo and light sour cream, but that leaves the dip bland.  Also, lemon juice is a must!  CHEEERS!!!

Served this at my last book club meeting - everyone was pleasantly surprised to see this old standard back in the appetizer line-up! I've been getting requests for it ever since, and it's so easy to make that I'm always happy to bring it.

I love this recipe! My family has a tradtition of making this as an apetizer for Thanksgiving dinner. We serve it with a marble rye bread, We carve the loaf into a bowl, cut up the remainder bread and put the dip in the bowl. Always a favorite!

I definitely suggest using the best quality dry vegetable or leek soup mix you can, to that end, I always use Knorr brand. Also, for those of you who are not a fan of water chestnuts, try substituting shredded jicama which will provide the texture contrast the water chestnuts do, but also lend an apple-like sweetness that is very nice. I also recommend simply serving the dip in a wide shallow bowl and cubing whole loaves of Hawaiian pineapple bread (no waste) along side.

The best that I have found, so I now make this for all major holidays and any pary I go to.  I serve it in a bread bowl and everytime the bread bowl is gone, and people will actuallt just scoop the dip on to their plates and continue to eat it alone!  Yes it really is that good!!  Kids love it too.

Spinach dip is a long time favorite of mine.  I used to serve it in a round scooped out sour dough bread crust.  The bread that was scooped out was torn into dipping size chunks and placed around the crusty round.  I like texture in dips and unlike some of the reviewers I left the recipe alone and used the water chestnuts and topped with toasted pine nuts.  Nice to see this old fav on here

My co-worker gave me the exact recipe a long time ago, and I lost it.  I stumpled upon this recipe and was thrilled!  This is the BEST spinach dip ever, and I would not change a thing!  Only thing that may be slightly different is that I always just have Hellmanns' Light Mayo on hand and just use that.  I don't notice a difference!  My family, friends, and I love this recipe!

Omg! Love this dip.  This was my first time making any kind of dip and I wasn't sure about it.  I left out the water chestnuts n accidentally got lipton onion recipe soup mix instead of veg soup mix so I only used half the packet cause its a little strong.  As in the other reviews I didn't use quite as much mayo and it was the perfect amount.  Everyone loved it ill def make   It again!

Easy, cheap, (and for my sake) hard to mess up.  I like my spinach dip more... spinachy and less creamy.  I doubled the spinach and used about half the amount of sour cream and mayo specified by the recipe.

This dip is addictive. I wanted a dip I could take to work to share and it made a LOT. There was some left over (somebody else brought storebought dip so it had some competition) so I brought it home and it made a GREAT snack til it was gone.

I had modest hopes for this recipe but I was still disappointed.  It was 2-star grade until trying it again the following day.  The flavors blend together notably better by day 2.  The flavors are quite bland and non-distinct.  The flavors of my favorite salsas, cheese dips, and spinach/artichoke dips are far superior to this dip.

Really loved this recipe. Made it for Christmas and for a Bday party. Everyone loved it. Only problem I had was it was runny. I "squeezed" the spinach like others suggested, maybe it wasn't enough. Or maybe I need to cut down on the Mayo/sour cream. I did however add some sugar. I made it according to the recipe and had my mom and bro try it and at the same time they said it needed sugar. So I added some, and served with Ritz crackers. Devoured in no time!

This is an old favorite of ours. I too used the Knorr's brand soup mix, but Lipton or Mrs. Grass is OK too.  The recipe is printed on the package.

This is a great recipe, the water chestnuts are the star ingredient here.  They add the perfect crunch to a great tasting dip.  Have made several times and get rave reviews.  Thanks!

Wonderful - I don't use the chestnuts, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. It is always a hit.  Can't say enough about what a phenomenal quick recipe this is.  I usually serve it with rosemary triscuits.

I did not have the required amount of spinach on hand, so I did with what I had.  It was delightful! I plan on trying it again for the next party, but this time with the right amount.

Everyone I make this for just raves over it. I prefer to have my spinach dip hot so I bake it at 400 for 20 minutes. I have made this as the recipe stated and I also have made it with my own variation. I like to add some artichoke hearts, pimentos and garlic then top it with some grated parmesan. Delicious!!

Easiest thing I made for Christmas dinner, and by far the most popular!  Everyone liked it.  I wasn't sure if "3 green onions" meant 3 of the green tubes, or 3 entire bunches, so I used about 5-6 green tubes.  It was delicious.

You can't go wrong with this stuff.  It's so quick to throw together (literally) and presents well in a hollowed out bread bowl.  I used the hollowed out bread for dipping pieces.

This is a really tasty recipe. I made a few changes by using light mayo and fat free sour cream. I also added more spinach which gave it more texture and flavor. My whole family loved it and no one noticed it wasn't made with "real" mayo and sour cream.

Excellent dip even using low fat variation. I'm not a water chestnut lover but I can handle and appreciate them in this dip. Adds the needed crunch and makes it stand out. I also reduce the sour cream 1/4-1/2 cup, add a little salt and garlic powder for more flavor. When I don't have green onions I just add a bit of onion powder. Thanks for a great recipe.

Tasted pretty good, just a little too much mayo for me.  I think next time I will increase the sour cream and reduce the amount of mayo in there.

This is what traditional spinach dip should taste like.  In order to have enough spinach you need to double the amount listed though.  It's also nice and thick, which is a plus.

THANKS FOR SHARING.  You saved my bacon!I prepared this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner appetizers and it was a huge hit!  EASY! EASY! EASY!  I followed the original recipe and took the advise of preparing the evening before.  I tried to use only 3/4 cup mayo but ended up adding more the next morning (didn't affect the flavor a bit, just made it a little more creamy).  I also "shredded" the spinach before I added it to the blend.    I will be taking this to the Civil War party this Saturday (GO BEAVS). Served with vegtables, chips or bread this dip is a winner!  Thanks for sharing!

I was short on water chestnuts and green onions so I subbed diced purple onion. It was perfect, had the onion flavor with the water chestnut type texture.  My picky 7 year old loved it on cheese crackers.

Pretty good, the only thing I did differently was use minced onion.  I thought at first it might be a little too creamy with not enough spinach, but it ended up being fine.

Delicious! Here is a tip: If you're buying bread from your grocery store's bakery to go with the dip, ask the baker behind the counter to slice it for you. It takes 5 seconds to put a loaf of French bread through their sandwich slicer, and you will get perfect bite-size pieces every time. It does not cost you anything extra, and it will save you time when you get home. :) The slices are great in a basket beside the dip.

Definitely use mayo and not Miracle Whip.  I also prefer to use Knorr's Leek Recipe mix in lieu of the vegetable soup mix and then omit the green onions.  I prefer to make the dip a day prior to my event so the flavors can mix overnight.  The water chestnuts provide a nice crunch to the dip and is low-cal and filling.  Delicious!

We love this simple and easy recipe. The first time out I followed the recipe to a T, then I started to modify. I've reduced both Sour Cream and Mayo - too dry so now I reduce only the may, maybe 3/4 C. vs. 1 C. I also make sure it is very well chilled prior to serving.

This was great! I made this for a party and everyone commented on it. I asked if anyone wanted to take any home, and half of the guests said they did. I used just half the mayo and no water chestnuts, put it in a bread bowl and it was wonderful

This dip was very good.  I used a hollowed out loaf of sourdough to hold the dip and cubed the bread and used that for dipping.  Delicious!

This has been my all time favorite party dip for years. I like to make it the night before and serve it in a Kings Hawaiian bread bowl, with crackers and chopped up "crouton" pieces of the scooped out Hawaiian bread. I make this at every group occasion and I'm always asked for the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful. We use it now at all get togethers. We usually use a sourdough bread bowl and pieces to dip. Also, if you mix things up the night before they are just a bit more flavorful! You'll have everyone asking for more.

Great recipe.  I use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup ranch dressing.  Seems to add a bit of zip to the flavor.

I don't know what happenned, but I thought it called for cream cheese instead of sour cream and that's how I made it.  It was great!  I used the Knorrs leek dry soup mix.  The water chestnuts definately add a great touch!  I'll make it again, my hubby won't even eat spinach and liked it.

I made this for a party and it was hardly touched...  I was rather disappointed, because the water chestnuts did little for me.  I love spinach dip, but I'll follow a different recipe next time...  Thanks for the idea though!

Great Dip to take to Parties!  The only thing I did differently was to use leek soup instead of vegetable and added some hot sauce to the mix. I placed the dip in a bread bowl.  Hit of the party!

I have been making this for years and it is hands down the best. I always use Knorrs brand vegetable soup mix, this recipe is on the back of their box.lol.. I always get a hawaiian bread bowl and a bag of hawaiian bread rolls, trust me it will all disappear!

I think letting it sit longer is key... 2 hours really isn't enough for the flavors to meld.  I added green Tabasco sauce (a lot, actually) and I really liked the added flavor.  Overall a crowd pleaser, just let it sit overnight, or make the morning of.

we used very sweet onions and lactose-free sour cream (but no one noticed the change in sour cream). also, i only used one 8-oz container of sour cream, and i REALLY recommend not using 16 ounces. that would have been way too much. it went over very, very well at a recent dinner party. i put it all in a rosemary-sourdough bread bowl. we had very little left!

I've made this recipe many times over the last few years. I leave out the water chestnuts and green onions, because my husband doesn't care for them. It's great with tortilla chips.

This is a very, very good recipe. I made my own mayonnaise for this recipe, and substituted a crushed vegetable bullion cube instead of dry vegetable soup mix. It seemed a bit bland, but with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste, it was perfect!

I made this for Chrismas and was asked to make it again for New Years.  Definitely use the Hawaiian bread/bowl, as it is just a great combination.

A perfect spinach dip.  I served this in a sourdough bread bowl for a Christmas appetizer and there was none left.  ETA:  I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup.

Easy and everyone always likes this.  I prefer to pulse in the food processor as the spinach gets too clumpy for my taste, but non one else seems to mind.  I definitely prefer the vegetable soup mix as opposed to the leek.

Yum! This stuff is fantastic! It's just a tad too salty for my taste, though, which is why I'm only giving it four stars. Next time I make it, I think I'll just use 1/2 or 3/4 of a pack of vegetable soup mix. Other than that, it's great.

I leave out the chestnuts but other than that this is my favorite recipe. Just a note . I use cut up bagel slices for dipping. They hold their form better than bread chunks and the chewy outside crust adds a very nice texture.

Awesome, this is a staple at all our celebrations.  I reduce the mayo and use light sour cream and replace the amounts with plain yogurt.  It's still great!

In a pinch when I don't have water chestnuts I have chopped a cucumber (deseeded) and used it. I like it just as much. Yes, a tad bit more sour cream than mayo and refrig overnight. Alwats a hit with my family. We like the potato rolls with it or Ritz crackers

This is a good standard recipe. I dislike mayo and onions so I leave them out and it tastes great.  I have lots of requests at potlucks for the "no mayo" version of this recipe.  I also add about two teaspoons of minced garlic to the spinach while it's cooking. Use high quality no sauce spinach for best results.

Everyone loved this. Even my bf tried it (he hates water chestnuts for some unknown reason). It was a hit. I only wish now that I had put it in the fridge before I crashed. -_-' It's way too good.

This is a great party recipe.  I recently made it and left out the mayo so I didn't have to make another trip to the grocery.  I still received numerous compliments.  I often serve it as a bread dowl using a round sourdoug load.  Works well with veggies too.

I used miracle whip instead of mayo, and I didn't really like the flavour it gave.  This was a bit too mayo for my liking, I didn't even use the whole amount it called for. I think next time I will try and use plain mayo and see if it's any better.  I liked the crunchy water chesnut bits though. I will try it again and see how it goes..

This is great - and I've always been one who hasn't liked the non-cheese spinach dips.  However - add a little crumbled bacon on top for the perfect touch!  Yum!

An all-time favorite!  It would not be a family get together without this dip, served with garlic-cheese toasts and crackers.  Wouldn't change a thing from the original!

Good recipe! I like to serve it with Hawaiian Bread. It adds a nice sweetness to it.
