My family really enjoy the short ribs.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  1 bag of carrots.  4 potatoes.  I did not add green onion, water chestnuts or mushroom. I will definitely make this again and pass the recipe on to my friends and family.

Really good recipe!  Easy and simple.  Very sweet and salty.  The only thing I recommend is adding an extra cup of water to the sauce.

I must have used the incorrect Soy Sauce, because 1 1/2 cups made the sauce inedible because it was too  salty........I never even added the extra salt that the recipe called for.  Since the sauce was so overpowering with salt I have no idea what the real flavor was..........

This recipe is very yummy.  I will totaly make this again.  The only problem I had was that the meat felt like it had tiny little slivers of bone all through it.  I have never cooked spare ribs before so I have no idea what this problem is. The flavor was great though.  I would use this recipe again perhaps with a different kind of meat.  Thanks!

Don't be put off by all the ingredients - these ribs are amazing! I omitted the kiwi and the shiitake mushrooms (forgot to buy them) and could probably have done without the water chestnuts. My only minor complaint is that everything turned out rather salty (and I love salt!). Other than that, we couldn't get enough. Thanks, I'll be making these again!

This was really sumptuous ! The beef was so tender, and the flavor was just enough sweet and salty.  I added 1 sweet potatoes as well, butternut squash would be good too :) One thing I did was I used few chunks of caneloupe, and few chunks for honey dew in replace of the pear and kiwi. Why not, it was leftover from a fruit salad. The substitution did not change flavor in the dish. The sauce was so good over rice. If you think it's not garlicky enough, then add some more garlic powder as I do to any dish anyways... and lots of cracked black pepper. YUM !!!

This recipe is now a family favorite! We really enjoyed making it, an authentic aroma filled the house. Simple, tasty, messy but fun. At some point I will try different flavors like extra garlic or a spicy element. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Too salty and not sweet or garlicky enough. I added almost another whole cup of sugar and a pound of vegetables to balance the flavors.

Very yummy. Given the high sodium from the soy sauce, I added 3/4 cup of water near the end to minimize the salty taste. Not a recipe I would make weekly, especially since I monitor my sodium intake. One serving gives me 2 days worth.

This was really, really delicious!  Everyone in my family loved it; it has universal appeal.  I did mess up the recipe quite a bit, and it still turned out fabulous.  I created the marinade (minus the water and the kiwi), soaked the ribs for an hour in cool water, then marinaded the meat for 3 hours.  I then shook off the marinade, boiled the meat in fresh water for 30 minutes, then took the meat out, dumped out the water and added the meat plus marinade plus 3 cups of water.  It seemed like a lot of extra steps but it all worked out in the end.  After cooking for an hour, I added the carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, and chestnuts and cooked for another 30 minutes.  I served it all over rice, and aside from my daughter complaining about the fattiness of the meat, we enjoyed it very much.  My husband asked me to add this to my regular rotation, so I know he loved it.  The house smelled divine while these were cooking!  So I probably over complicated this dish, but the results were so well worth it.  I wouldn't leave out any ingredient.  I didn't have a kiwi, but I did use an entire large Asian pear, but I'll make it with the kiwi next time to see if there's an improvement.  Try this recipe!!

Made as written this would be really salty. I omitted the salt entirely. Instead of black pepper I used garlic chili paste like my Asian neighbors do. If all you have around the house is black pepper, I'm sure that will work fine.

Toasted sesame seeds make a nice garnish.
