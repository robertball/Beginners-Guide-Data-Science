Made this for Thanksgiving and put cranberry sauce instead of the dried cranberries it called for. It was great!

I made this and added fresh mushrooms. It was delicious. I found it took longer than 30 minutes to cook however I may not have had package sealed tight enough. Very easy clean up.

I liked this recipe for the tart cranberry. I would like to try making it again and reserving drippings and blending into a sauce instead of whole.

Good flavor! I only used 1/2 cup broth. It took longer to cook than directed though. Roasted at 375 for almost 40 minutes. Meat thermometer read 145 when I pulled it out. Perfectly cooked juicy and flavorful.
