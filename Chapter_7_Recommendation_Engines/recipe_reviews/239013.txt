This was a pretty and tasty supper. I didn't have frozen pineapple so I used canned. I also left out the nuts and the cheese. There seemed to be too much liquid. I used half the teriyaki sauce and half the broth called for and that was perfect. Great over rice.

This is a five star all the way.  (and I don't give them out willy-nilly.)  Two small changes tho...since I didn't have frozen pineapple I used canned chunks.  Also since the sauce seemed a little thin for my taste I made an easy fix with a little corn starch and cold water.  No big deal there.  Without a doubt, we will be having this again.

Excellent! This will be my go-to stir-fry recipe. I did make some changes to make this real-food friendly: I used frozen organic bell pepper slices home made teriyaki sauce fresh cut pineapple and raw cashews. When it came time to add the liquid I did not use chicken broth as I saw no need for it. I would recommend not using it at all. I let the teriyaki reduce slightly and it was perfect. I did not add the cheese as I found it unnecessary. The Sriracha really kicks it up a bit. We served over a bed of brown rice. Very good will make again!

Liked this very much but even though I simmered it well over 20 minutes the sauce seemed a little thin. I also did not put swiss cheese on it at the end. Sorry. Couldn't do it. It was delicious without.I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs.

I omitted the chicken and added toasted sesame seeds to accomodate my vegetarian daughter. Absolutely delicious. The extra simmer time is definitely key to a lovely sticky dish.

I thought this was tasty but it was way too high in sodium. I read the earlier reviews before making this and adapted after hearing their comments. I only added 3/4 cup of teriyaki sauce and 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I added more veggies such as fresh green beans for added color. I used fresh pineapple not the suggested frozen pineapple. Lastly I mixed 1 1/2 teaspoons of corn starch with a little cold water and blended it into the sauce so it wasn't so runny.

I tried this recipe last night and would give it 5 stars except that I need to modify the next time. I added a lot more veggies since we love them and I had left over from the previous night - so besides the peppers and onions we had yellow squash and asparagus. Yum! I felt the sauce was too salty for my taste so next time I will drop the chicken stock and use water - and make sure the temperature stays high enough to reduce in 15-20 minutes.

More chicken, less teriyaki
