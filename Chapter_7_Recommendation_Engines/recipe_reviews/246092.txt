I liked the idea of this recipe and felt it had good textures and mix of ingredients - the egg, the cashew crunch, the tofu, the veggies and noodles - but found it a bit lacking in flavor, as in they all kind of blended and not one thing stood out. Maybe increasing tahini or seasoning veggies in some way, so something pops out? I liked that it included all ingredients I had on hand, would be easy to modify, and was relatively quick to put together. I will definitely try this again, with some tweaks.

Used peas instead of the beans.  used all coconut milk rather than mix with soya milk. I think the sauce needs something but have no suggestions. The meal was well received by the family- even the tofu.

This was delicious!  I pretty much made it as written but I could easily see changing up the veggies to use what you have handy.  I really liked the tahini flavor but might use a bit more next time. The one change I made was to use all coconut milk instead of soy + coconut.  The cashews offer a great crunch and the sauce isn't too overpowering.  Plus it's great cold.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very tasty.. I didnt  have any soy milk, only vanilla almond so I used all coconut milk in this.. ,, I would have liked even more coconut flavor so I thin next time, I'd reduce the edamame and maybe add some toasted coconut
