I love these cookies.  They remind me of my grandmother's cookies from Germany.  I make the recipe exactly as is BUT after I pull them from the oven I put them in a bag of powdered sugar and coat them.  Then I let them sit for 3 - 5 days.  Sometimes I coat them again with powdered sugar before serving.

My favorite of the Pfeffernusse recipes... it tastes like the ones my grandmother makes. I did both a normal batch, and following another reviewer's suggestion, a batch with double the spices (except pepper). I like it better with the stronger spices and flavors.

Nice crunchy cookie, great for the holidays.  I did double the spices (except the pepper) and was still wishing for more spiced flavor, so I'd probably triple them next time.  I also cut the sugar down to 1 c. and it was still just the right amount of sweetness.

I am a firm believer in trying the original recipe before making modifications, unless of course there is an obvious error in the ingredients.
I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed the flavor of these cookies.  I didn't add the almonds because I'm not a big fan of nuts in desserts.  If you are not a fan of cardamom, you probably won't like these cookies.  The cardamom flavor was definitely present, but not overpowering.  
Definitely follow the instructions and only add 1/2 cup of the flour mixture at a time.  The last 1/2 cup to Cup of flour you will probably want to knead the dough by hand.  
Don't expect a very big cookie.  They don't grow much bigger than the inch ball you originally rolled them into.  
My children and my husband really liked the cookies.  It was a very easy recipe and one that I will be making again.

Very unusual flavor for a cookie- very spicy and not especially sweet.  I enjoyed them for breakfast with a cup of tea.

These cookies are fabulous! Not a sweet treat, but a wonderful spicy cookie. My husband loves Pfeffernusse, and I had never made them. He raved about them. Warn the readers that the dough is dry and crumbly. I was afraid I had put too much flour in, and made a second batch! But they came out great. Took the second dough and froze it to bake them off for when my adult kids come for a visit.

I was looking for a recipe that had a different unique taste to it.  These sounded good so I made them according to the recipe, adding in the optional almonds.  (I toasted them first in the oven before I added them and it made a wonderful difference) ~ This recipe was GREAT.   I didn't want to give any of them away!  If you like exotic different flavors with a little pinch of spice, you will love these.  AWESOME!

I loved these! I ran out of cardamom, so I used some nutmeg and cloves in place. I also added vanilla and about 1 tablespoon of honey. These are great with black coffee! I later thought adding in orange or lemon zest would be a lovely variation. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are unlike any I've ever had before. The flavor takes some getting used to. They are not sweet but they're loaded with flavor. Don't make these if you don't like Cardamom, that's what I thought dominated the cookies.

I made this recipe without the cardamom and almonds.  I used black pepper instead of white pepper. Over all I really liked the cookie.  I also added a power sugar icing to the top of the cookies.  This icing made the cookies even better

These cookies are very similar to the recipe I've used for the last 50 years. It's much easier to chill the dough and then roll into long "worms", and then cut into one inch pieces to bake.  It's just faster....who has time to spare at the holidays!

I love these cookies! This is my first time baking them and I loved them just as the recipe is.  I just love the spiciness of dough and they are so easy to just pop into your mouth. I'll definitely keep these in my regular repertoire.

Great recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies.  I added about 2 T of cocoa powder and 2 tsp vanilla extract.  Didn't have cardamom so I used nutmeg instead.  I also doubled the spices as many people have suggested.  Once they cooled, I rolled them in powdered sugar.  I also tried rolling out some dough and made gingerbread man cutouts. They turned out great. Much easier to dunk that way. :)

I lost my recipe this year.  I couldn't remember if I got it out of a cookbook or this website.  But I distinctly remember it being all splotched up, so this is it.  For those Germans who have grown up with pfeffernusse, this recipe is a killer!  I have friends and relatives who only remember this cookie from growing up.  I know my Oma made them. This recipe truly rocks as is, and makes a ton.  Eat them yourself or give them away.  Tasty tasty tasty!

Way easier than I would think. Mixing the dough was a snap, although it did get crumbly as others said, Makes a ball nicely. Try to keep them the size of an acorn.   I went the traditional route and rolled the baked cookie in confectioners sugar. I didn't think it'd stick well but it did,

I love this recipe! It is, in fact, my favorite thing to bake. Everyone loved them immensely, and I like the fact that they're spicy, a pretty unusual taste for a cookie. This is actually one of the only kinds of cookies I will eat, because most are sickeningly sweet (to me). And I like the small size. They came out looking like something from a professional bakery. I left out a few spices because I didn't have them, so I increased the amount of cinnamon to 2 tsp and ginger to 1 tsp. I also added 1 cup of almonds instead of 3/4, and also added a few tablespoons of finely chopped walnuts. Overall, I think the cookies came out well. The recipe was well-written and easy to use.

The measurements for this is incorrect, you cannot get 4 cups of flour into the amount of butter and eggs.  You either have to cut the flour down to 2 cups or increase the butter to 1.5 cups and add 1 more egg.  Once I did that the cookie dough would actually stick together and not just fall apart.  The other thing is that the picture has them covered in powered sugar, however there is no mention of that ingredient in the recipe.

Well I normally do not rate recipes, but this one I just have to.  I wsa looking for a recipe to make for a cookie exchange and this one says it makes 16 dozen. I made the cookies 1/2 to 1 inch in size and I barley got 7 dozen. Disappointed in that, however, the cookies are really very good in taste. I also doubled the spices except for the white pepper.

I thought these were perfect to take to a German-themed luncheon tomorrow and I think they'll be a hit. I ended making two batches because I used a tablespoon to scoop out onto the baking sheet and ended up getting only 66 cookies, if I had used a 1/2 tablespoon it would've doubled the amount. Since I made two batches I ran out of butter and had to borrow some from my in-laws, which wasn't at room temperature. I made the mistake of nuking the butter to liquid status which made the second batch runnier than the first (which came out perfectly). It caused me to have to add tapioca flour and some brown rice flour to help stiffen it up to scoop out onto the baking sheet. They came out good, just not as spicy as the first batch. I also doubled the amount of spices, didn't use cardamom, instead ground cloves, I reduced the packed light brown sugar to 1/4 C. and used 3/4 C of brown rice syrup to help deepen the flavor, and I grated fresh ginger instead of ground. Everyone in my home likes them so far, including my dog Maddie! Will make again as these are similar to ginger snape.

Nice flavor but too dry.  Followed others' suggestions and doubled spices, but omitted white pepper all together.  I plan on trying these again, but will definitely add some moisture to the dough.

The cookie is ok, but they are so many other kinds that I would rather have.  I will admit that I am rating this before the three day period in the frig.  It the get better, I will report back.

I made these cookies per the recipe as written and then rolled them in powdered sugar when they were cooling.  They were okay, the pepper sneaks up on you, but all of the other spices were not strong enough for my taste buds.  I bought all new spices this holiday season, so it wasn't that the spices lost some of their potency,  If I make the recipe again, I will be sure and double everything except the pepper.  I did add the almonds, but didn't really notice too much almond flavor, so next time I might just skip them and see.  I always try to make a recipe as written the first time I make it, despite the other reviews.

Made these today.  I'll admit I cheated and tried just one so far.  The rest are set aside for a few days as the directions suggest.  I did add an additional egg as the dough was very stiff and really giving my Kitchenaid a workout.

Very good- did not have brown sugar on hand so subbed in white sugar with molasses (about 1.5 tbsp of molasses)- also used freshly cracked black pepper to substitute for white pepper, and upped the ginger/cinnamon as did not have cardamom. Dredged in icing sugar- delicious! Will definitely make again!
