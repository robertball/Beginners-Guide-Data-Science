This was delicious. I used apple cider vinegar and water as a substitute for the sherry, since I don't use alcohol. I put it all in at once, so it had time to blend. I had a lot of red pepper on hand, so I used that, and left out the green pepper. I really liked this recipe.

My family loves this recipe - I used red wine vinegar in place of cooking sherry, because I don't have cooking sherry.  Delicious!

Just finished eating this delicious dish! It's very filling and came together pretty quickly, once all of the vegetables were chopped. Like other reviewers, I didn't have any sherry on hand, so I used red wine vinegar and thought it tasted great! I also used spicy Italian sausage since we like some heat in our food. Looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.

Made this this weekend, I didn't have much hope it would have a lot of flavour actually, but I was wrong.  2nd day, even better.  i used a combination of Chorizo sausage and Italian sausage (yum).  The fennel and sherry are a must have.  The ONLY thing I changed was at the end.  I was afraid it would be rather dry, so while the veggies etc were still in the pan, I added some of the drained juices back in.  Very very delicious.  I made lots and am very happy to have the leftovers.  One for the recipe box.

I will definitely make this recipe again. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I did not follow the recipe exactly. I just used what I had in the house. I used Johnsonville Mild ground Italian sausage, green onion, green pepper, a lot of freshly minced garlic, 3 diced tomatoes, 6 tablespoons Merlot, and salt and pepper. I baked the spaghetti squash, cut in half and face down, at 375 degrees for 40 minutes and let it cool.

This was an easy and tasty fall meal. I omitted the sausage(did not have any and the sherry)but it still turned out wonderful no complaints from the kids. Used up the last of the garden vegetables which was perfect for this dish.

This was epic! Everyone loved. I twisted it to my own specifications just a tad. I didn't have any fennel, so I left that out and replaced it with sliced red onion. I imagine the fennel would be amazing so would definitely try it with that next time. I also used my own home made sausage (I like Lee Fogle's recipe from here) as I had some ground pork and turkey to use up (sorry, Johnsonville!) Didn't drain the sausage, as you lose too much flavor doing that. I also used 14 oz of canned San Marzano tomatoes instead of fresh, and added a little chopped fresh parsley. No need to dirty a dish to cook the squash, as noted in the footnotes...just poke a few holes with a sharp knife and microwave whole on high power for 10 minutes. Easy peasy. Would recommend some fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and salt/pepper added to the squash as well. Kicked it up a notch.

Delicious! This is the first time I've tried spaghetti squash instead of noodles and I'm hooked! Amazing! Made the recipe exactly as written.
The flavors in this dish were outstanding. I would most definitely make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I have tried a few different types of sauces with spaghetti squash but this tops them all!  I used spicy Italian turkey sausage and a sweet red wine instead of the sherry.  The grocery store was out of fennel so I just threw in some baby spinach at the last to add some more colour.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I used vanilla in place of cooking sherry. 1 to 2 tsp vanilla to 2 tbls of sherry. Don't forget the garlic bread.

Delicious! I have never cooked with spaghetti squash before, and my whole family loved it. I forgot to get the fennel,  but I will make sure have it next time. Im not familiar with that either, so I'm not sure what the difference in flavor there might be. But again, was a hit even without it.

I used local sweet sausage from Kulick's Market.  I only used 1/4 cup of fennel seeds that I roasted and added them to the tomato.  Warmed up the squash and in another fry pan I cooked the peppers, onions, mushrooms and extra fresh garlic chopped!  Added the sausage to this that I had partially cooked.  Then served this on top of the spaghetti squash!

This was such a tasty dish without having to use actual spaghetti!  Even my somewhat picky husband liked it.  I mostly followed the recipe but used a jar sauce instead of making my own.  The directions provided on how to cut and cook the spaghetti squash was so helpful and right on!  I had never cooked it before and it was really easy!  Cutting the squash was the only tricky thing since it's so large.  Now was this way better than regular pasta - no (but I am a pasta junky) but a very delicious alternative.  I will make again and recommend!

I have made this many times and everytime it comes out great. The only thing that I change is, I leave out the fennel. I never have it on hand and I don't think you are missing much by leaving it out. I have also made this with canned tomatoes and it is still really good.

Edited: Be sure to get fresh fennel; it's worth it and really makes the dish.  Also, we prefer to use the Johnsonville Ground Sausage because it has no unsavory additives.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to make a few changes for what I had on hand.  I omitted the red pepper and green onion and instead used some chopped fresh mushrooms and diced yellow onion.  Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a 28 oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes, drained and added two TBS of tomato paste. I used Mild Italian sausage instead of sweet. I made the sauce in a nonstick skillet, so I did not need nor use the olive oil. (plenty of oil after sauteing and draining the sausage to saute the vegetables in) I will be making this recipe again, as the sausage gives it sooo much flavor!

Loved this recipe. Decided to make it bc I had just received the majority of the Veggies from my weekly local food co-op basket. I had NEVER cooked spaghetti squash before or fennel. I only wish the recipe had had the directions on how to cook the squash as I had to look elsewhere to find the correct way to prepare it. For those who are like me and have no idea.. cut the squash length wise and scoop out seeds, the place face down on a oiled baking sheet and bake for 45m in a 350 degree oven. Then scoop out the squash. It was pretty easy to do... once I found someone online to tell me how to do it! :)

Haven't tried it yet.  I just bought a spagetti squash for the first time the other day.. And I am making it for Wednesday.  I had one other plan of how I was going to make it, but then I came across this, and I think I am going to try this.  It looks just like pasta.  As a diabetic, this is great that I came across this, as I have to count carbs.  So thank you.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe. We used sage sausage and roasted the spaghetti squash with olive oil and salt and pepper. I will say that I would add some garlic or herbs to the squash to make it a bit more flavorful, but the fennel and vegetables used pair really well together. It was very yummy.

This was an excellent recipe!!!  The most telling reason is not that my 18 month old loved even though she did, but that my husband who HATES vegetables thought it was great too!  He even made spaghetti to eat with the sausage pepper topping and ended up not eating it at all b/c he was so full after eating the spaghetti squash with the sausage pepper topping.  Excellent!!  Will be eating this regularly.  We could not find any fennel so we omitted it and didn't add the sherry after done cooking (only the 3 tbsp while cooking), but it was excellent without.

This recipe was delicious!  The boyfriend had to stop himself from eating the whole thing.  I made some substitutions - hot italian sausage instead of sweet because we both love spicy.  And red wine vinegar instead of sherry.  This was the first time I ever had fennel and spaghetti squash too.  I was very impressed.  Definitely a keeper and going in my recipe box!
