This is a great recipe the way it is written, but if you want something really yummy add a few ripe banana's and cut the sugar down. So Yummy!

This is absolutely amazing! I had to make it twice in one weekend at the behest of my boyfriend and our friend. This is also very delicious just out of the blender, poured over angel or pound cake. Just make it!

if your following a low carb diet, use splenda instead of the sugar.  this will cut the carb count down and make a great dessert.

Oh My! This is delicious!! Had this blended and in the freezer in under 5 minutes.  I only had 12 oz of frozen strawberries so I used frozen mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries and strawberries) for the other 12 oz. and it was perfect. Hubby and all the kids said it was "the best ice cream ever." I can't wait to try it with other flavors. Excellent recipe!

I made this last night using fat free half and half and in my food processor.  The strawberries I used were not sweetened and it was still plenty sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good and so easy! My kids helped me make this and were so surprised at how fast I made ice cream! I have made this with various flavors - I made strawberry, raspberry and peach. I used 1/2 the amount of sugar in each ice cream flavor and it was sweet enough. It was very good! I will make it again!

Great ice cream, easy to make.  I put the cream in first, then added a few of the frozen strawberries at a time.  No problems. Used a blender.

I made this exactly as in the recipe.  The ice cream was very tasty & very easy to make.  The hardest part was waiting for it to harden.  I think that I will add a little less sugar the next time I make it.

I put the cream and sugar in the blender, then with the blender running, added the strawberries.  Simply amazing!  I'm drooling as I type.  This recipe is highly alterable according to taste.  I bought some peaches to try this with next.  Fabulous fabulous fabulous!!!

Texture was absolutely beautiful. I can't believe how easy this was! I thought "real" ice cream involved eggs and cooking and mess.   This really was the BEST ice cream I've ever had - Super Yummy!

Easy and delicious.  Wonderful when we can't make our own homemade ice cream in our ice cream freezer.  Reviewed by Lavender Lynn.

Not very creamy but it hit the spot and is definitely healthier than store bought. I like the versatility. We will definitely have this again.

I didn't presweeten my strawberries, but it could have used more sugar in the end. It had a great fresh strawberry taste.  After belnding, I placed it in my ice cream maker.  Even after three hours in the freezer, it had a soft texture.  Very esay treat!
