Chicken Corn Black Bean Soup Haiku: "This was so easy! But doesn't need that much corn. We'll eat this again!" I only used one can of fiesta-corn, for the much needed color that this soup needed. (It could definitely benefit from some sauteed red bell peppers or something else w/ color.) I made it as directed, using a Costco large can of Kirkland chicken instead of a rotisserie chicken, making this ultra-easy to throw together. If I make it again though, I would consider doubling the black beans, or reducing the corn to an even smaller can b/c it's still a little corn-heavy. We didn't know what to think of the cream of chick soup going into it, but it totally worked! Served w/ a sprinkle of grated cheddar and some crumble tortilla chips on top - yummo!

Made as directed and the results were fabulous! Made it a second time with a packet of fajita seasonings and it tastes the same (go for which option is easiest for you!). I chose MOJO seasoned rotisserie chicken and topped the soup with lime juice, Mexican cheese blend, and fresh cut cilantro.  Served with soft flour tortillas to the family members who don't enjoy crushed  crunchy tortilla chips . We will definitely make this again as it is perfect as written.

This was excellent, especially on a cold, winter day. Next time I will serve it with corn bread, YUM!

My family loved this! I made very few changes to this recipe. Because some other reviewers said the soup was a bit "corn-heavy", I only used one can of corn. Instead of Southwest corn, I used a can of fire-roasted corn I had on-hand. I added two cans of black beans, because we love black beans, and one can really didn't look like enough for the amount of soup.  I also sprinkled  in about a half teaspoon or so of chipotle powder. I don't usually care for recipes that call for "cream of ..." soups, but I added the cream of chicken to the pot and it really helped to thicken it up, so don't leave it out! I paired the soup with "Golden Sweet Cornbread" from this site. Everyone topped their soup with cheese, sour cream, and fresh cilantro. It was an excellent meal! This recipe is a keeper for me, thanks for sharing it!

Update: I've probably made this about 4 times now, it's always a hit! Last time I added a few squirts of Sriracha sauce instead of Chipotle powder, it's great either way, but I think we all prefer the Sriracha.

This was great! I thought this was going to be too spicy, but it wasn't! I did add an extra can of black beans, can of chili beans, and only one can of corn like the other reviews recommended. Very tasty. Very satisfying on a cold winter night. Thanks!

I don't cook, but we dine out too much, so I needed something easy that my notoriously picky kids would eat.  This worked out great!  What's easier than "dump it all in a pot and heat"?!  I used low-sodium broth because whoa that a lot of salt!

I made this recipe for a group of ladies I was having over after golf.  Made ahead and warmed up to serve.  Everyone loved it!  The only changes I made were, I didn't add any regular corn, and because one of my friends had an allergy to onions I did not use the pace picante sauce, I substituted 1 /1/2  cans of fire roasted organic tomatoes (28 oz can).
