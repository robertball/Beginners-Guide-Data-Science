I didn't have shallots, so I used garlic and onion. Also used prosecco. It was yummy! I will definitely make it again. It was a big hit!!!

We followed the recipe, except for using 3 cups of chicken stock instead of 2 with 1 cup of water. Loved it! Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

The recipe instructions call for water, but the amount isn't shown in the ingredient list. I guessed and used 2/3 cup, but the risotto was too chewy.
