This was very easy to make and made a pretty presentation.  You can add or omit ingredients based on your preferences.  I added Italian sausage and a little cheddar cheese to make it a main course. It was very good. However, next time I think I will substitute the broccoli with zucchini or something else.  Might also try adding a little garlic and pepper. For us, the broccoli was a little overwhelming.

made a variation of this recipe.  I started with the same spread you make for veggie pizza (sour cream, cream cheese, ranch mix) because I had some leftover. Then I added two eggs, shredded cheese, and a little baking mix.  Then added my veggies, chopped broccoli, carrots. onions. 

I buttered the top when it came out of the oven and sprinkled parm cheese on top.

can't wait to try it for our NYE party!

This was fantastic! I took this to a cookie exchange as an appetizer and everyone devoured it! Comes together quickly. This recipe is an excellent base to add in any vegetables you prefer. A Mexican cheese blend would work too for a Mexican flare instead of Italian. I did not have the three cheese blend so made up my own three cheese blend of (equal amounts of);  mozzarella, parmigiana & cheddar. Aside from the vegetables listed I also added in diced onions & bell peppers. Then I seasoned the egg mixture with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Definitely will made this again.

Pretty good. We didn't have frozen broccoli, mushrooms or tomatoes, so made it with 6 oz cream cheese, fresh broccoli parboiled, and 2 sweet potatoes sliced and parboiled. Also  substituted shredded sharp cheddar, white cheddar, and a little bit of feta.

It was pretty easy to make. Wasn't the best but was fairly decent. I'd make it again and maybe use more cheese and a different type of shredded cheese bc the Italian blend was kind of bland

I left out the tomatoes, but this was a great party meal! Easy to serve!
