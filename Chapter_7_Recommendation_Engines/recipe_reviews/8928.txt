This was a really good way to make chicken. The sauce took a little long to cook, but was worth it in the end. My mom thought the sauce was a little too sweet, so adjust the sugar by your own taste. Also note that breading and frying the chicken isn't necessary. I just stuck it in the oven and baked it and it tasted great. Try it with rice and carrots, the sauce tastes good on both of those as well.

This review is only for the sauce. I used it with sauteed tofu and veggies over rice and it was delicious! After reading other reviews I cut down on the sugar using somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 cup. It definitely was sweet (but not too sweet I thought) and very citrusy!

Usually when lots of reviewers claim something is too sweet I think they're nuts but I went ahead and put in less sugar than called for and for the first time I'll say something is too sweet. This is good and I may make it again but with lots of modifications. There was too much flour in the batter I might use orange juice concentrate instead of OJ less lemon more salt and ginger... I don't know. The sauce was very sweet light flavored and unremarkable. It needs work. (P.S.--My bf was much happier with this recipe than I was calling it delicious.)

I only used the sauce portion of the recipe and it was woefully dissapointing. I added less than 1/2 a cup of sugar so that fixed the sweetness issue other reviewers had but the sauce didn't have an asian flair to it. That's what I was looking for I guess. I prepared the chicken with garlic and ginger -- thankfully that saved the meal. This is an orange sauce. Plain and simple. If that's what your looking for you've found a good one. But if your looking for anything asian look elsewhere.

my hubby and I LOVE this recipe. We add hot pepper flakes to the sauce to spice it up and it is fabulous!!only complaint is batter is to thick. We add about a half of cup less of flour and it is perfect.

Pretty good! I only made the sauce (to go over stir-fried chicken and rice) and it was better than a lot of Chinese restaurants that we've been to. My husband loves orange chicken and he thought this was really good. The sauce didn't thicken up much for me of course this could be operator error so I'll see what happens the next time I make it. Even though it wasn't thick the taste was very good. Perhaps a little sweet like the others said so maybe I'll reduce the sugar just a little bit next time too.

This was the most amazing recipe. I literally had to juice my own oranges and lemons which took forever and used the suggestions like use less sugar and add crushed red pepper and i double dipped my chicken in the egg and then flour. I served it up a low mein My husband said it was the best thing that i had ever cooked. I was very estatic. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves to cook from sratch.

Nice recipe. Not the same old boring chicken. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. I would try it again with less sugar. The batter coating was quite thick. Be careful how high your temperature is when you saute the battered chicken. Almonds add a nice flavor.

DH and I both really enjoyed this. I did adjust the number of servings to two and cut the sugar in half as others recommended. Perfect with a few crushed red pepper flakes sprinkled on top. We like to dip so the sauce was served on the side. Will make this again! Served with rice and broccoli.

Fantastic! The sauce takes time to make - good solution is to double the batch and freeze half for a great weeknight meal. It is sweet - but we like sweet. The chicken is a snap to make and reheats well. Don't skip the almonds; they really add to the flavor of the chicken. The chicken could easily be a stand alone recipe. Together this a recipe that I would not hesitate to make for a dinner party.

While it wasn't intolerable, the glaze was more of a cream and not nearly as dark as most Orange Sauces. The only things changed were lessened the amount of sugar and added crushed red pepper to make it spicy. The spice was a nice touch, though the sauce was still a bit too sweet. Needs a better orange kick as well.

Yummy! Made 6 servings still cut way back on sugar for sauce and was sweet enough. Added a bit more orange/lemon and some fresh minced ginger and a dash of Sriracha hot chili sauce. Came out great. Tenderized a chicken breast then cut into strips. Dipped into egg whites and then panko crumbs lightly pan fried. Goes well with carrot rice recipe from this site.

Used just the sauce. Ended up pounding the chix flat dipping in flour then egg mixed with milk then crushed saltines mixed with breadcrumbs. Baked about 20 min at 400. Did the sauce just as directed- but added some shredded ginger in with the orange zest and a sprinkle of red chili peppers. Fabulous glaze! Will make again for sure.

This review is just for the sauce but i tasted great and worked perfect with some breaded chicken (mixed with orange zest & cajun spice). I didn't have any cornstarch but just added some extra flour and cooked it slightly below medium heat till it thickened up. Turned out great and tasted delicious.

This was absolutely delicious! It tasted just like what you would get at a chinese restaurant but without all the grease. Even my picky husband (who hates chicken) and my children loved it. It is definitely a keeper.

This dish turned out great. I reduced the amount of sugar in the sauce by about 1/4 after reading reviews saying the sauce was sweet and the sauce was perfect. This dish is time consuming to make and uses lots of pots and pans but is well worth it. I served it with angel hair pasta with parmesan and Reisling. The flavors worked together wonderfully.

Don't do the breading batter! It's WAY to messy it's not all that special anyways and just more work than it's worth. I just breaded my chicken by flouring the chicken pieces dipping them in egg and then dipping them in the bread crumbs. The sauce is excellent add some dried chilli peppers or chilli pepper flakes for a little kick! This orange chicken goes great with rice and broccoli too.

I halved the chicken part of this recipe but made the full sauce amount. I took the advice of fellow reviewers and used less sugar. It was absolutely wonderful not too tangy nor too sweet. I served this with brown rice and "Grandma's Green Bean Casserole". It was a wonderful combination and one that I will definitely make again and again.

The orange sauce was a great success. I used panko bread crumbs instead and also added coconut flakes to the mix which added a great twist.

The only good thing I have to say about this recipe is that the chicken was very tender. The batter was so thick that I had a hard time covering the chicken with it. I did pat the next breast dry and that helped a little. After it was baked the crust just fell off of the chicken. The sauce was nothing special either. My husband said it tasted like froot loops after a few bites and didn't finish it. For all of the time and work it took I was really disappointed in the result and won't be making it again.

This was absolutely wonderful -- and a lot better than most orange chicken dishes at a Chinese restaurant! The sauce is spectacular and the breading for the chicken is awesome. I skipped the almonds but added parmesan cheese to the breading. Fabulous recipe!

I was looking for an orange sauce recipe and this one came up in the search. I didn't follow the recipe for the chicken portion but used the sauce portion and it was delicious. I have served it with salmon; rice; chicken; vegetables. Recipe makes a fairly large quantity so did my husband and I for a few meals.

I thought mixing the flour egg and milk was a bad idea and it was. The batter after it was cooked fell off the chicken. Did I do anything wrong? The sauce was much to thin. I might make it again with less sugar and not mix the flour egg and milk together. I loved the almonds.

I have this problem of not reading the recipe directions before I make them. (or the reviews in this case) I would have questioned the egg milk and flour mixture that the chicken was to be dipped into if I had! But I made it anyway and quickly threw it out. HOW are you supposed to dip anything into this batter that is like biscuit dough and get it back out?! There is no way! SOOO I cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and then dipped in an egg / milk wash I did grind up the almonds and put them with the bread crumbs and about 1/4 c flour. I then dredged the chicken in that and fried until golden brown. I made the sauce exactly as recipe stated and after draining chicken on paper towels stired sauce and chicken together and served over rice. It was actually very good this way!!;-) I hate when people change up the whole recipe and then say it was good but I really didn't have a choice!!!

I agree many other comments. The batter was too thick so I used only 1 cup of flour. For my taste the sauce was a bit sweet so I used less sugar. Although the dish took a while to cook it was well worth it and I've already shared this recipe with friends who are anxious to try it! Thanks for a great new recipe!

This is delicious. I recommend using chicken tenderloins instead of breasts - you taste more of the coating. The orange sauce is amazing. Make a double batch!

Pretty good! I like the way the sauce was made...it turned out the perfect consistency. I also love the breading on the chicken...it's still kind of gooey when done but I like it that way. The flavor was alright but I feel like it needed a little something else to it. I'm not sure what! It was just sweet. I think I like things that have a little more kick to it but that's just me.

I made just the sauce to use with some chicken I already had. Since most of the reviews said the sauce was too sweet I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar instead of the full cup. I didn't have any lemon or orange zest handy so I skipped both of those. Instead I threw in some ground ginger roughly about a quarter of a teaspoon. I also added two tablespoons of rice vinegar and some red pepper flakes. It was very good this way - not too sweet and with a little kick.

When I was sauteeing the chicken I found it easier to go in batches. Which increases the amount of buter needed. Just make sure there is enough in the bottom of the pan as you start each round. My family enjoys the chicken in nugget sized pieces. The whole dish was delicious but it would've been great even without the sauce! Oh I also added about a tablespoon of sweet chili sauce to the sauce for an added kick!

I really had hoped this recipes was better:( The picture looks like the chicken is in bite size pieces so I cut the chicken before breading but this made it really time consuming-none the less I thought all of the work would be worth it but the end result was plain. I agree with the previous rating that this is a basic orange sauce-nothing asain so please don't expect it to be. I will not make this again:(

This recipe is awesome! My husband loved it and my picky 2 year old even ate it up! The sauce thickened up really nicely maybe a little too thick but it tasted great! I made it with some rice next time I will try some carrots also. I wasn't too sure about the thick batter on the chicken under the bread crumbs at first but it tasted great. The almonds really added to the taste of the chicken. Great recipe!

Terrific! Easy meal to make aside from the batter (but I don't like that part anyway). My husband told me to add it to his favorties list! I didn't use 12 chicken breast (too many) and next time I think I'll use tenders. I would recommend that you dry the ckn of any moisture before you put them in the batter so that it will stick better. Thanks for the great new recipe!!
