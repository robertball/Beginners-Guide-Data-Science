Hmmmm.... not bad. Actually it was a bit dry at first and I wasn't sure what condiment to use, but I tried Mrs. Butterworth's syrup and it turned out great with that on top. The Muenster doesn't have much flavor, it blends right in and this was really pretty good.

I'm a newish cook, and I think this is the first time I've ever made French Toast of any sort. Plus, I'm not sure if I've ever even had Muenster either.
That said, this was pretty easy to make, and tasted pretty good. I only give it 3 stars because it wasn't fantastic, but I still might make it again.

So simple, and yet sooooo yummy. I used the sliced, packaged, store brand muenster, so I could stand a little more cheese flavour, but as a person who does not like sweet, I have found my ideal french toast!?!

Had to try it because it's different.  Since I'm such a cheese fan, it tasted good to me!  Might add bacon the next time.  As for Nathalie's review - I didn't know we were reviewing the name of the recipe - lighten up.

This is one of those recipes I never would have thought to try if someone had not mentioned it on the recipe exchange, and I ended up liking it a lot!  When I think of French toast, I think "breakfast" but this is really just a variation open-faced grilled cheese, so I had it for supper.  Quick, easy and actually pretty filling since I used a nice hearty multi-grain bread! I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a few shakes of Worcestershire and THAT really made it savory and yummy!  Next time I might add it to the egg mixture before dipping the bread - oh, and since it was just me, I used egg substitute so I could just use a splash and not "waste" any leftover egg.  Thanks for sharing!

Not sure what provoked me to try this recipe... I guess because I was only cooking for myself and I like eggs, cheese, toast, butter...  Frankly, I will never admit to my classy friends that I actually ate this, nor will I serve it to my husband, however I'm thinking if I'd just had a date with a guy that took me to one of those crazy beer restaurants that likes to serve a burger patty in a taco shell and taco meat on a bun... then (in the morning?) this recipe might just bring him down on one knee!!  Ha!... good in a mom's comfort food sorta way. I used a Cheddar cheese and maple syrup.

Really easy to make.  Fun, simple flavor but it does seem like "something" is missing.  Will probably make it again in search of that "something."

LOOOOOVE this recipe! I'm not a sweets in the morning fan but love french toast and the addition of the cheese helped balance it out plus gives you more protein. Also, I add some cinnamon and nutmeg. YUM!

Not bad!  I used egg substitute and homemade challah.  The cheese sort of replaces any butter one might normally spread on french toast.  It contrasts well with the powdered sugar I sprinkled on top!  I didn't like it very much without the sugar, strangely enough.

Quick, easy, and a little dif. taste I used homemade bread, because I make all of our bread(not bread machine either)so I got 6, not 8 slices before the egg ran out. As far as "condiments" None needed! a little salt and pepper in the egg mixture, and you are good to go!!

Um... well, I don't get the ratings.  Or maybe I don't "get" the recipe.  I am not a fan of sickening sweet stuff, like syrup, so I tended to see this as a substitute for using syrup and was surprised to see people using syrup, powdered sugar, etc.  Syrup with cheese... er, yuk.  But maybe that's what it was meant to be, I dunno.  I agree with Christine that it's more of an open-face grilled cheese, and in fact had thought, why not just make a grilled cheese with muenster as it'd be easier.  Momasguardianangel isn't the only one who ran out of egg mixture and it's not because of the homemade bread.  I ran out as well - I was pushing the bread around in the bowl trying to get every last drop and then just ended up spreading some margarine on the rest -- really, it tasted much the same that way, so why not just make a grilled cheese?  They also burned very easily - medium I think is too high.  It also was not at all filling.  So the 2 is not really cause I disliked it per se, but more because I just thought it was a waste and the recipe had problems.  (Though making a plain old grilled cheese with muenster does sound good, with more cheese though.)(And lol, kkcooks!)

It sounds appealing and tastes good. However, I did not know what condiments would match well with the dish. German French Toast is a good beginner's dish.

I have done this with Swiss cheese and a little maple syrup(home-made from our neighbors) drizzled over the top. Yummm!
