This is awesome! In the video he talks about "the holy trinity" ~celery, onions and green peppers but in the written directions it says "green chile peppers". Next time I will use green peppers. I think he used canned tomatoes in the video but I used fresh and it was fine. Next time I will also cut down on the cayenne. It was fine for hubby and I who love spice but may be too much for the non-spice lover. That said, with or without the cayenne I think it could use double the spice blend. I have 2 big eaters and myself. This recipe was enough with a small amount of leftovers. Thanks Chef John, can't beat this recipe!

Easy and very good! I tried this tonight to test for a Soul Food Luncheon I am in charge of for 70 seniors who have asked for Soul Food. I've never tried this cuisine before but this dish was easy and yummy. Thanks Chef John!!P.S. I also used chicken breasts and Andouille sausage along with the shrimp.

Amazing!  Made this for an early Father's Day Lunch and was told it was outstanding.  With the exception of using seafood stock, I made it as listed.  I was however surprised at how spicy it was.  I literally put two drops of hot sauce in it.  After reviewing the recipe on Chef John's blog, I found that this site lists green chili peppers and his site lists sweet (bell) peppers.  Next time I'll use a green bell pepper.  I personally like the heat but when cooking for others, I try to tame it down.  Thanks Chef John!

Not bad but not nearly enough of the holy trinity. Also it misses having a browned roux, but is easier without that step. For that amount of shrimp you want at least a cup of onion and 1/2 cup of celery and bell pepper. Also I think adding a bay leaf is essential for flavor, but otherwise I followed this recipe and it came out pretty good.

Perfect dish.  Follow the instructions & you'll produce a meal to rival any restaurant. After making this 3 times for different 'audiences', or became clear it's worthy of a top-spot in my cooking repertoire. Plus it makes you look like a Kitchen Cook Superstar! Thanks a million Chef John!

Another extraordinary recipe from Chef John. Thank you!! Shrimp Étouffée is one of my very favorite dishes, and this is the first time I've made it, thanks to your easy instructions. It was VERY filling, so it was okay that we only had a pound and a half shrimp. That easily feeds 6 or more. I actually had good-quality shrimp (which was a surprise) rather than water-logged, which meant I should not have drained and patted them dry. There was hardly any shrimp broth at the bottom to add back in, so I would have liked to know how to make stock with the shells instead of throwing them away (will research for next time). This was YUMMY! And my family loved it! Thank you!!

Excellent as written. Fresh shrimp tastes even better. If you want more shrimp stock, you can take the tail shells from the frozen shrimp, or all the shells and heads from the fresh shrimp and depending on the amount of shells you have, gently boil them in a cup or half cup of water until the shells begin to turn orange in color. Then strain the water from the shells.

Excellent recipe -- rich sauce that works perfectly with the shrimp.  I doubled the non-hot spices and loved the result.  I also used fresh garlic and onion (I don't have powder).  I used canned diced Hatch chiles.  But fresh tomatoes.  And I didn't have celery.  (Will add it next time, but it was great without it.)  Next time, I am going to try chicken -- or a chicken, shrimp, sausage mix.

 In other words, this is a robust recipe that holds up well to lots of fiddling.  And the timings on the steps seemed just about perfect.   Easy to follow with a great result!

Made as is with no substitutions except increasing to 6 servings. Everyone enjoyed this...especially my husband who is from Louisiana. Just the right amount of spice, good gravy. Will make again.

Excellent; my wife and I loved it. I intended to make half of this recipe for my wife and me, but forgot and made the entire sauce recipe for only one pound of shrimp; that seemed to be enough shrimp for the full amount of sauce. The shrimp we bought (already P&D) was higher quality than Chef John inferred in the video.

This food taste soo good ! I will cook this for my friends :) this is so simple to do. I also used fresh tomatoes and it turned out great, so I think fresh food is better than canned tomatoes. I also love adding green onions bc it makes the taste more complete :)

I made my broth with the shrimp skins and and about a tbs of chicken broth base.  It was amazing!  I only used 1lb of shrimp because that's all I had.  If I did use 2lbs then I would double everything else so there were be enough sauce to enjoy for a  second plate. I also increased the cayenne pepper because we like things spicy!

My husband is the master or creole cooking so you can imagine my stress level cooking this for him.  He LOVED it and so did our kids.  It was lip smacking good. I did use green peppers instead of the chile peppers. Served over white rice with a green salad and corn bread.  Definitely a keeper!! Thank you!!!!

A teriffic dish! I just about doubled the sauce ingredients though, added 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and omitted the chili pepper, using green pepper instead. Chef John's directions are easy to follow. Thank you for a great meal idea :)

I made this for my husband for his birthday.  He thought it was delicious. I thought so too. Here's what I would do differently though.I would mince some garlic for extra flavor and not sear the shrimp prior. The shrimp were over cooked for me. I would make the etouffe and add the raw shrimp afterward and simmer. Very good recipe though.

This was fantastic! Really spicy but not sure why with only 1/4 tsp cayenne. I used 3 TB of flour to thicken to my liking. A must have for Mardi Gras! Real keeper, thank you!

The huge list of ingredients is a little scary, but this actually comes together pretty quickly and the steps aren't too involved. The combination of herbs and spices makes for a very well seasoned broth. I don't like green bell peppers, so I used a poblano (as is suggested in the video). Why didn't I think of that before???  I couldn't bring myself to use pre-cooked shrimp, so I substituted raw easy peel. So much better! Very good recipe that scratches the Cajun itch without the huge production a gumbo is. Thanks.

Absolutely amazing and easy. The flavors are perfect as is. At the end I added small amounts of turkey kielbasa and chicken thigh because I HAD to use them or lose them but tasted it before hand and couldn't wait to sit down with it. Make this! :)

This is great!
I added a qt of oysters (drained, at the same time as the tomatoes), 8 oz of crabmeat, a habanero pepper (minced with the seeds), black pepper, tripled the Worcestershire, and a lot of cayenne and tobasco.
I made a stock out of shrimp, crab & lobsters shells. I used some of the stock to make brown rice.
For the etouffe I used 1/2 cup of the oyster liquor, the juices from the shrimp, and topped it off with my stock. 
I did find 2tbsp of flour was not enough to thicken, however the oysters may have had a lot to do with that. Easy fix though.
I will definitely be making this again!
Thanks!

I made this almost exactly as written, I only left out the dash of hot sauce because my hubby doesn't like really spicy food.  It was only moderately spicy without it.  Perfect for us!  Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!!

This recipe came out so well and it was so easy!!! It was spicy but not to hot, flavorful, and I dont think the picture does this meal justice. Chef John you have outdone yourself once again.Also a time saver with all the chopping that would have needed to be done I had a bag of flavor mix that can be purchased frozen and pre-chopped and it seemed to do just as well as purchasing the onions, bell peppers and green onions individually and chopping them myself. Just a time saver.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  I will make it again.  I substituted cajun spice mix for Chef John's homemade mix because I had it on hand.  It was still delicious.  Thanks for another great recipe.

Since I am allergic to shrimp, I omitted it and instead added browned chicken at the very end. Excellent!! You'll never be disappointed with a recipe from Chef John.

Used easy peel raw shrimp.  I may try adding smoked sausage next time. Also used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. Absolutely delicious.

Not impressed.  There weren't enough vegetables for the amount of shrimp, and no developed roux, so the dish lacked depth of flavor.  I'll stick to my go-to recipe for etoufee.

Actually I've made it twice.  No changes first time.  Second time I added a pound of thinly sliced andouille.

This is really outstanding recipe.

Family loved this meal.  I did cut back on the red pepper because we do not care for hot pepper.  You need to prep all ingredients before you start because this dish will keep you hopping once you start.  I used easy peel deveined tail on shrimp and shelled them after cooking them in the hot oil.  I think this adds favor worth the extra effort.  We will make this dish again.

I was so pleased with this dish and the way that it turned out, I could've eaten half of it all by myself. I made it with all the spices suggested in the recipe and found that the result was very tasty with a heat that was present but not overwhelming. I only had 1lb of shrimp and so I added 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts to compensate. For extra flavour I heated the chicken stock in the microwave with the shrimp tails in the liquid before adding  it to the pan. Loved this dish! Thank-you Chef John for providing a recipe that is truly easy to reproduce.

Excellent Etouffee, not too spicy, just a hint of heat. The only criticism is that there wasn't much gravy. Next time I will double the gravy ingredients.

I cooked bacon before i added the shrimp and it made a huge difference.  I added the cooked bacon after I put the shrimp in the sauce. I also added creole seasoning.  It was AMAZING.  so silky and smooth.

Nice flavor. I halved the recipe I was more then enough for 3 people. I will make this with chicken next time. This was great way to use up the rest of my frozen shrimp. I also very much appreciate the tip on how to make frozen shrimp editable. I will be using that trick from here on out when I can't get fresh. I thought the spice was perfect!

Turned out to be very delicious. Also, I think perhaps the author meant green bell peppers and not green chili peppers? It seems like bell peppers from the video and what he's saying about the 'holy trifecta'..

Only change is I used smoked paprika, and I think it is better that way.  It really is critical to drain the shrimp adequately and cook them well (but not too much).  Otherwise you just end up with pink gelatinous lumps in a spicy broth.

Very flavorful and spicy! My family complained that it was too spicy, but it was perfect. Reduce cayenne pepper if you don't like too much heat.

Wow! Absolutely delicious. But as another reviewer mentioned, I think you're supposed to use green bell peppers and the recipe says green chile peppers, and that can definitely change the heat. I used mild green chile peppers and I thought it was great, but I like spicy. Also, I used seafood stock, instead of chicken and I thought it worked. This recipe is perfect! Great find!

I will definitely make this again!  It was awesome!  I switched the Green Bell Pepper for Yellow and Red Bell peppers.  I also doubled the spices, vegetables, stock & flour in order to get more sauce to use over the rice.  It was wonderful over Wild Rice

This was okay, nothing wrong with it. It seemed to lack something that I can't quite put my finger on. This style of cooking usually has a lot of depth of flavour that this recipe didn't quite live up to. My family said "we'd eat it again if you cooked it" which is not a ringing endorsement for spending so much time in front of the stove. Some other reviewers suggested it maybe needed a browned roux or more veggies, maybe that would make a difference? I'm going to see if I can find another recipe as I really wanted to like this - it had potential.
I'm also a bit confused as other reviewers reference shrimp stock and green chilie peppers - neither of which I can see in this recipe (there's chicken stock and green bell peppers), so I'm not sure if this one has been changed over the years or if they're talking about another recipe

Turned out great! I did make a couple of changes. Not a big fan of green peppers, so used some red and orange peppers instead, used canned diced tomatoes, and siracha sauce for a kick. Very tasty, will probably make again using chicken breast chunks.

Loved this! Lowered the heat a bit so that my 3 year old twin boys could eat it - cut the cayenne in 1/2 and didn't add the hot sauce (my husband added both to his individual plate).  Will definitely make this again. YUM!

I have never been to New Orleans so I really have nothing to compare this to but I loved it. I decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/8tsp for the kids used fresh tomatoes and only 1 pound of shrimp instead of 2. I served the shrimp and the sauce over plain white rice aside of a salad. We all really enjoyed this! Perfect for our Mardi gras dinner at home:)

Fun to cook and to eat, this is a keeper.  Wonderful flavor.   Served over jasmine rice.  I only added 1/8 tsp of cayenne and it was the right amount of spicy for my family.  Thank you Chef John!

Amazing recipe. As usual, I made some changes based on seasoning preferences. I added a bit more thyme, oregano, cayenne, and a tiny little bit of smoked paprika in addition to the paprika already present. I used a whole can of tomatoes and two chunked up fresh tomatoes. I also added mushrooms (for flavour and body), as well as a cup of cilantro. As for the heat, I used a mix of tobasco and Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

Great recipe and not as heavy as other etoufee's I've encountered. Will make again.

I never made Etouffee before and it turned out great! Chef John has the most favorable receipts on Allrecipes.com. My wife hates onions so I was not able to complete the "holy trinity".  I used (1) large Green Pepper (2) stalks of celery and (1) large green chili pepper plus (4) diced tomatoes  and the recipes was able to accommodate all the extra veggies.

I decreased the "hot" spices by about 1/2 and it was still plenty spicy for us.  I did not have shrimp stock and so I used chicken stock.  I used a little more chicken stock because it was a bit thick.  

I made this for company who do like spicy food and they were very impressed.

Wonderful flavor. I admit my husband does not eat peppers, but I had frozen shrimp and just had to use it.  Followed the recipe except substituted other vegetables for the peppers. The gravy was fantastic.  I will definitely keep this one around.

It came together quickly and easily. Very flavorful although I made almost double the spice mixture. It had moderate heat...wasn't too spicy as my 6 yr old ate it w/o complaining that smoke was coming out of his ears. Will definitely make it again.

I made it as is (green peppers were on my recipe).  It was fantastic and a big hit.  I did use 40 oz. of shrimp.

This was so delicious that by the time I remembered to take a picture...it was all gone!! The only adjustment I made was that I added a whole 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (and that was just based on my preference). But, I think it would have been super tasty either way. Excellent and definitely worth making!!

This recipe was delicious!  I made it as written to surprise my husband (I rarely have time to cook these days) and it made his night.  I used the bell pepper version and it was the perfect amount of spice for all...A nice kick that didn't overpower the flavor of the étouffée.

We used the 2-pound bag of frozen shrimp from Costco and followed the tricks in the video.  It was super easy.  I will definitely make again.  Only thing I would change next time is adjust the ingredients so there is more of the sauce for the rice.  

Thank you Chef John!

I don't know if this was an "easy" recipe or I just did a really good job but this was by far the best shrimp etouffee I ever made. It was truly divine. I love Chef John's recipes!

Wow, this was heaven!! It was very light, but filling! Perfect blend of spices and veggies! To keep the heat moderate I just added 1/8 of cayenne pepper. I ran out of flour, so I substituted with cornstarch and it was still amazing! I did not modify anything else on recipe. Served with some grand southern biscuits. Can't wait to make again!! Yummy!

Great recipe that doesn't call for terrible store bought Cajun seasoning. We got married in New Orleans and I make my husband etouffee for our anniversary every year. This might be my favorite etouffee recipe...even beating out the one where I made my own fish stock.

This was the bomb!  It was fun and easy to make and was packed with flavors.  I'm actually eating for breakfast as I type this. I followed the recipe to a T but only used 12oz of shrimp but left everything else the same.  I don't know if this would of been as flavorful using 2 pounds of shrimp.

Made this almost exactly as written and it was scrumptious. The "almost" is that I used a half pound of peeled/deveined frozen shrimp and a pound of headless frozen shrimp that needed cleaning. When I cleaned them, I saved the shells and boiled them for stock. Then I used that and the juices from the shrimp (as in the recipe) and enough chicken stock to make 2 cups ( it came out about 1/2 and 1/2). This is my favorite way to make shrimp. Thanks Chef John for the great post!

Made with just a few taste tweaks. I think it comes pretty close to my Cajun father-in-law's recipe. I walked away satisfied from this meal and see it as a good base to start with.

Added a bay leaf per other commenters and left out the cayenne because kids.  I used frozen cooked shrimp which turned out to be a good time (and washing up) saver, just made the sauce and put them in after that had come to a boil. Overall, pretty yummy, but still seemed to be lacking something that I just can't put my finger on.  I used a good bit more Worcestershire than called for thinking that would solve it, but still not quite there.

This was really really good. I did do a few things differently. I didn't sear the shrimp first, I peeled it and made stock from the shells and made the dish the next day, using the shrimp stock instead of chicken. Also added a tsp of dried basil to the spices and left out the hot sauce. Also left out the tomatoes and used a yellow pepper. 
Would definitely make again.

Always LOVE Chef John’s recipes! For this one, I used only one pound of shrimp and it was plenty. I used green peppers as well for my picky eater and sriracha for the hot sauce. You could throw this on a sandwich, as well! It’s great! My family likes things saucy so next time I will continue with only one pound of shrimp but double the sauce. Possibly add some crawfish too :)

This recipe looks cumbersome due to the amount of ingredients, but it’s really easy to throw together. And wow, is it fantastic! I made it exactly as written and can’t imagine changing a thing! Did I mention this dish is absolutely awesome?!?!?!

I first had this in the cafeteria at work and loved it then, and this recipe was even better! I used one cup of better than broth lobster base instead of the chicken stock. I also didn't have any tomatoes so I used 1/2 cup of Pico de Gallo. I also only had one pound of shrimp. It was just enough to feed three adults. Definitely making again!

I substitute the flour with heavy cream. And substitute the rice with cauliflower only for diet purposes, but it still tasted great!

It was pretty good but not as good as the ones from Luisiana. Not sure what's missing. I will most likely make this again however open to other recipes!

This is an awesome recipe. Watch video, he makes it easy to follow. Saying it it is easy doesn’t mean it is quick, but it is well worth the time and effort for special occasions. Also use the Seafood Stock if you can find it.

This was the best recipe I've used. This was my second attempt, however this was my first time using this recipe. If you like spicy use a little more Cayenne. My food was so Full of FLAVOR!!!

Amazing. It was a hit with the whole family. I only added a couple drops of hot sauce and it wasn’t too hot for us. It had just enough heat from the other spices. I didn’t have garlic powder and added minced garlic to the veggies when they were in the skillet. Definitely will make again. Every Chef John recipe is a sure fire hit!!! Thanks!

Great tip about the shrimp. Hard to find fresh seafood  where I live.  Made exactly as recipe stated, will make again. Suffice to say, I miss the Gulf Coast.

Great and easy recipe! I followed recipe exactly with the exception of the spice.  i used a Creole Cajun spice from my grocery store.  I also served it over cauliflower rice to save on carbs.  I served with a side of warm corn bread which really compliments this dish.   Was a great hit with everyone!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was very good. The proportion of shrimp to veggies seemed a little off. Next time I will increase the amounts to provide more Etouffee to shrimp.

This dish was excellent!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and the only thing I would change next time is to double the sauce.   We like more sauce for the rice.

Excellent etouffee recipe and not difficult.   Used Publix frozen uncooked shrimp.   I added some andoullie sausage finely diced for more flavor which everyone agreed was a tasty addition.   Next time I will add a clover or two of fresh garlic.

Stayed on course with the recipe first time, was excellent. Second time, added andoullie sausage and okra. Was also fantastic, may I recommend Tony Chachere's seasoning with it you can't miss.

3 out of 4 at our house loved it!  

We only had 1 pound of shrimp, but that seemed like enough with the amount of sauce.  We used red peppers instead of green.  Otherwise, we followed the recipe and thought it was really good!

I doubled the recipe and added fresh garlic. I also used fresh parsley and served it over grits. The family loved it! They thought it was the best “shrimp and grits” I kept trying to tell them it was Shrimp Etouffée. Definitely will make it again.

Wow! What a  wonderful Creole version of shrimp Etouffee. I just had to make a large batch of "the holy trinity". I had a 20 oz bag of shrimp and I used canned tomatoes (shame on me). I served this scrumptious dish over brown rice. This amount fed my husband and myself and had a lunch size left over portion!  The seasoning was awesome! I am going to make a jar of it to save time next time I cook a Creole dish! This goes in the keeper box!

I used this go this recipe to make jambalaya with chicken thighs and andouille sausage. I saved the shrimp addition for last. It was outstanding with rice on the bottom of the bowl.  Loved it!

So delicious! This is one of my favourite recipes I found on the site. The whole family enjoyed it. We followed the recipe except we did not add white pepper or hot sauce as we did not have them on hand. A must try!

I've not had shrimp etouffee so I can't say if this was true to the real thing, but it was very nice meal using frozen shrimp. I had 1 LB. OF SHRIMP and enough of the other ingredients to give it a whirl . I made the FULL AMOUNT OF SAUCE and substituted fresh thyme for dried, shallots for onions,  canned fire-roasted green chiles for the green peppers, and no green onions. I thought the sauce to shrimp ratio worked fine and tasted great. Thanks!!

We only had a 12 oz. package of p&d shrimp, but I felt like the ratio of protein to sauce and rice was fine. I will certainly be making it again.

Clean bowls by the whole family.  We followed Chef John's video suggestion, swapping chicken in for the shrimp - it was tasty!  Definitely a repeat in meal-rotations.

I made the version that was in the all recipes magazine for Mardi Gras, with the chicken and shrimp “Chef John’s Etouffee”, I couldn’t find that one on the site. I made it exactly as directed and it turned out wonderful. It was so relaxing making it, also.  My family loved it. Thank you so much for this one, Chef John!

Other than making a mistake and having to compensate for that, this was made exactly as recipe directs.  It was awesome.  My error was to add too much chicken broth (1/4 c extra).  That caused me to have to add a little more flour. It was delicious!

Once again Chef John knocks this out of the park. Phenomenal flavor.  All the spices are a perfect combination. Differing amounts of cayenne pepper in top at the end helps different members of the family customize the heat to their liking. Another recipe to love.

My husband and I both loved it!!!  We are recent converts to the "Keto" diet, so I had to make some adjustments--replacing the flour with almond flour and xantham gum to thicken the pot and we ate is as a soup/stew--but WOW!!!

Delicious. Followed to the T. can't wait for my adult children and grands to try this. I'll reserve some without the spice, just a tiny bit, for the grands. Excellent!

Superb Cajun dish.  I used frozen shrimp and followed the directions for doing so.  I served it over brown rice with a glass of white wine.  Delish!

Do you have to use green bell peppers or can I substitute something else?  I really REALLY bell peppers of any color!  But the recipe is yummy looking & I'd really love to try it.  I do love listening to Chef John's narratives.  Needles to say, I have not tried this recipe yet.

Oh yum! This is so tasty! I have made this so many times both for crowds and just wifey and myself and its always delicious! Some variations here and there include adding sausage like kielbasa or andouille, adding leftover grilled chicken, using jasmine rice and adding some fresh sliced grape tomatoes from the garden. An extra little trick I learned was to simmer the shrimp shells in the stock for a little while before bringing it all together. The flavor is tremendous! Oh, and dont forget the bay leaves!

Chef John,
This was an absolute hit with my family.  As I've read in the recipes on others needing to double it, I still chose to cook it as per the recipe.  I had my family wanting seconds and there was barely enough for the first go around, so I will definitely double the recipe next time.  However, my kids were basically licking their bowls and I didn't cut down on any spices.  The heat was on key, the roux was outstanding and all I can say is it was just an 5 star dish hands down.  I will be making this again very soon being I live in Corpus Christi, I can get some fresh bay shrimp.  Yeah, it will be phenomenal.  Thank you, Chef John!!

Def make it again.  My mom isn't a fan of pepper or heat at all, so I just added 1 small shake of cayenne and left any extra pepper out.  I was out of diced tomatoes, so I used what leftovers of a fresh beautiful tomato we had plus a little tomato sauce.  I tasted this before adding salt and worcestershire sauce, and didn't like it.  After I added salt and worc. sauce, it was quite tasty.  I recommend doing these things a little at a time, so you don't over salt it.  I also used ground oregano b/c we didn't have any normal dried oregano and smoked paprika, just b/c I prefer smoked over regular paprika.  I'm surprised my mom liked this...no she LOVED it.  My dad was quite fond of it too, and he's not a seafood guy.
A keeper, and I used a 41-50 shrimp per pound, 1 lb bag of medium ( I think it was medium ) shrimp.  It was a good shrimp to gravy ratio, although I forgot shrimp get smaller as they cook and it probably could've used another bag.

Fantastic!  I didn't have a green pepper, so used yellow.  I also cut back on the cayenne because I like to add my own heat with hot sauce in my individual serving, and give others the same opportunity.  Definitely will make again!

Staple dish in my kitchen! It’s tasty and easy to make into vegetarian dish that’s enjoyed by meat/non meat eaters. I followed other reviewers suggestions to increase the holy trinity and spice blend and ended up with a satisfying dish that makes cooking for multiple food preferences a breeze. 


Vegetarian - cook the shrimp seperately, skip using the shrimp juice in the dish and sub veggie stock for chicken. Serve shrimp on the side and you’ve got an easy solution to multiple food preferences. 

Vegan - follow the directions for vegetargian above and sub olive oil or vegan butter for butter. 

Gluten free - sub rice flour for regular flour

I wish it thickened up a bit more than it did. I may just add a bit more flour next time. I also don’t think there was enough of the trinity, I will probably add about a 1/2 cup next time.

This recipe is amazing. Whenever we have a couple over for dinner, I get a request for this recipe. It's a little time consuming, but definitely worth it. I sometimes switch between bell peppers and green peppers for added spicy.

Very tasty. I only had 1 lb of head on shrimp but kept the same proportions of everything else. I also added 2 andouille sausages and used fresh tomato. It made plenty of delicious sauce to go over rice. Don't let the number of ingredients deter you - it was a great quick dinner!

Made it with crawfish tails and shrimp for my wife’s Birthday. Followed the recipe exactly except for adding the crawfish and I didn’t have any hot sauce to add. Was better than the Etouffe we’ve had in restaurants! Will definitely make it again  and double the recipe so we have more leftovers! Couldn’t get enough.

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!!!!

I increased the ingredients by half for a small dinner party.  I thought we would have a lot left over, but nearly everyone had seconds.

I did replace the diced tomatoes with Rotel tomatoes (it's winter and fresh tomatoes suck).  This recipe was amazing!!!  It wasn't as heavy as many others.  It was also perfectly spiced and healthier than many other etouffee recipes.

We made a salad with avocado dressing and garlic bread to accompany the etouffee.

I can't wait to make this recipe again.

This was absolutely amazing!  Probably one of my favorite recipes I've made on Allrecipes.  This recipe rivals the shrimp  etouffee I had in New Orleans.  Made it exactly as it was written...so delicious!

Delicious and surprisingly easy to make! I wanted more veggies, so I added a whole green pepper instead of a third cup and half an onion. I kept the celery as is. I didn’t think it was too spicy at all. And I liked the cheater shrimp stock addition. Definitely will make again!

I make this every year for our Mardi Gras party. Big hit every time. I don't make it to spicy because alot in the group like it mild. I do use clam juice and the shell stock I make from the shrimp.

This was really good!  I was a bit afraid that it might have too much heat from the cayenne and hot sauce, but it was just right.  I used almost double the amount of onion, celery and green pepper called for - just a personal preference - and it was great.  Another winner, Chef John!

My fiancé loves Cajun food, so I tried this recipe but added some leftover lobster with the shrimp.  It’s the first time I’ve ever had this and it was so delicious.  My fiancé loved it and took what was left over for lunch the next day (which he never does)!

As usual, Chef John has another stellar recipe.  BTW, if you haven't checked out Chef John's site, do yourself a favor and do it soon!  www.foodwishes.com.  I love Allrecipes, but I also really love Foodwishes.  Most of his videos are available here on Allrecipes, though. I have learned SO much watching his videos and to make it even better, his quirky sense of humor always makes me smile.  

So....this is  a GREAT recipe.  Fortunately, I live on the Gulf Coast of Florida, so I have fresh-off-the boat shrimp available year round and think I would just die if I had to use frozen shrimp.  But he even makes these look good!   The only changes I made to this recipe are 1) I used 2 pounds of beautiful fresh shrimp, 2) I upped the onion and celery a little and used a diced seeded jalapeno only because as much as I like to eat, I can't do cooked green bell pepper.  Kinda like Andrew Zimmern doesn't do walnuts!  And 3) because I had fresh shrimp, I made shrimp stock following the instructions given on Chef John's Spicy Coconut Shrimp Bisque video.  I also used the rice that Chef John covers in his 'How to Make Perfect White Rice' recipe.  Otherwise, followed exactly.  Have made for the two of us (re-heat leftovers carefully so not to over cook the shrimp) and have increased the recipe to feed family  while visiting my Mom.  This is GOOD!!!!  Thanks, Chef John.

Perfect with a little personal modification.  My girlfriend made this for me knowing that Etouffee is one of my all-time favorite dishes. I was highly impressed and very, very vhappy! She doubled the recipe and then added 3 tablespoons of white vinegar, few more shakes of Worcester sauce, extra shrimp with chicken pieces and Portuguese sausage (Linguica).  She also used Indian Bismati rice in which she filled a very small cup, turned it over and made a rice sand castle / island in the bowl.  IT WAS AMAZING!!!!

I was not a fan of this dish. My husband who loves cajun said it was "ok". I have never made it (nor eaten it) before so I don't have anything to compare it to, so I do want to be fair with that statement. My husband said just seemed like something was missing. I followed the recipe.... except I used fresh shrimp and took the peelings from them amd made my own stock.

this recipe, as written, is my "go-to" for shrimp.  I boil up the shells for stock.  I think the sauce is better the 2nd day.

I didn't have bell peppers, so I raided my garden for poblanos. I didn't have celery, so I added extra poblanos. I also didn't have green onions, so I omitted those. I used fresh grape and petite yellow tomatoes and I'd definitely do that again. I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table, so I used Emeril's Essence rather than following Chef John's recipe for the seasoning. It was EXCELLENT! This is a great recipe that I'll be making again! Thanks, Chef John!

We have made this several times and it is always delicious. My son even requested it for his 14th birthday dinner last year. When a growing boy chooses this over steak or lamb chops that is really saying something! We have occasionally added in crawfish tail meat in addition to the shrimp. Great!

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe as it is, except for the bell pepper, because I didn't have one on hand. It was easy to fix and very delicious. It has a little bit of a kick to it but not too much; just the way I like my etouffee. This recipe will definitely be added to my dinner rotation. Thank you, Chef John!

I used a Creole seasoning instead of the mix in the recipe and added at least twice as much of the peppers, onions and celery. I also used 3/4 can of tomato paste.  It was very good.

I made this last night and it was really delicious, chef John never disappoints!!  It's easy to make, it's a little spicy but not mouth burning, and the taste is fantastic.  I used tomato passata because I don't like pieces of tomato in my stews and added a little extra Worcester sauce because I like the flavor.  I also used raw prawns, so skipped the pre-frying bit and simmered their shells for half hour in the chicken stock.  Yummm, very delicious recipe!

This is a great recipe! Rather spicy but most Cajun foods are. Next time I will reduce or omit the cayenne. The list of ingredients is a little daunting but it was very easy. I appreciated that the directions were so detailed. Will definitely make it again!

I could have used fresh shrimp, and I won't try this recipe again. I barely tasted the cayenne, so it was actually one of the most worse foods I ever tasted. I'll stick to restaurant meals like this one.

This is a wonderful Cajun recipe.  My husband thought it was a bit too spicy, but my 9 year old ate everything and said it was delicious.  I've made it 3 times, and it's a family favorite.  Go Chef John!

This is really good. The only thing was I didn't have celery so I swapped with mushrooms. I also took bratwurst with the skin off and made tiny balls separately then added when you add the shrimp in.  This was simple and I can't wait to do it for a party! Thanks Chef John.

Yummy!  My first time eating shrimp etoufee, so I wasn't sure how thick the sauce traditionally is. I made just half the recipe, since there are just two of us and we are light eaters. There is plenty left over for my lunch tomorrow. Since my partner doesn't like his food too hot, I used only half the cayenne called for and left the hot sauce to be added at the table - by only me. This was a wonderful dish and fairly easy to make. I'll definitely include it in my files to repeat.

This was really good.  When I saw the ingredients, I was afraid that it might need more of the "trinity" veggies, but I trusted the recipe and it was perfect.   It was definitely spicy, so the only change I might make next time is to tone it down just a tiny bit.

I watched the video earlier in the day, then made it for dinner by memory.  I've made cajun and creole dishes before, so the technique I knew.  What I used instead of shrimp was blackened salmon fillets, almost done, then cut in pieces and added to the sauce at the last 5 or so minutes just to finish.  WOW!  This was the best New Orleans dish I have ever made!  Even my daughter who normally doesn't like fish, came for a bowlful after she ate her own dinner!  This was awesome, and so easy once you get the prep out of the way - Thanks Chef John!

I made this recipe for guests last night and it was a big hit!  I also had sauteed two Andouille sausages cut up to add to it and I made it ahead of time, but held off on putting the shrimps and sausages back  in until just about serving time.  I also doubled the spices/herbs  but not the cayenne because one guest can't eat too spicy.  I used green bell pepper.   But  I would have liked a little more kick so added fresh ground black pepper on my serving. Just before serving I put it all together near the end of the cooking time for the rice.  Meant more time to enjoy my guests.   I served it with a nice green salad and French brioche and one guest said it rivaled some meals we'd had served by a French chef!  Will make it again and again.

This was  very flavorful and spicy. I imagine the heat depends on what type of hot sauce you used. It took longer to cook the tomatoes and we added about 2/3 of a cup rather than 1/2.  Our guests raved about it. I'm not normally a shrimp fan and even I thought it was delicious. I always love Chef John's recipes.

I love this recipe and make it often. My husband is picky so I modify some. I leave out the green peppers and add fresh garlic to the veg. I also use fresh tomato in the sauce and as the garnish and double the cayenne pepper for extra heat.

This was delicious!  I used habanero Rotel to give it a special kick and Tony Cachere seasoning instead of the spice blend, but I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Delicious!!!

Amazing! I wish I had doubled the recipe, it was so good and was gone in a flash! Even my family's pickiest eater wanted more.  (I did add another batch of  the dry seasoning for extra bold flavor and another tablespoon of flour for thickness.)

The flavour from this recipe was exactly what my wife and I were looking for. We thought the spice mix was amazing and we won't be buying it premixed anymore. I really should have looked a little harder for some better shrimp but I did find some crab meat that worked really well for us. I can't wait to share this dish with friends and family!

This was a classic take of a great Etouffee, the base was really tasteful and it helps when you can get a few pounds of fresh Louisiana shrimp. I added my own Cajun spice mix with the rest of the favoring. It added just enough heat to make it balanced.

Some time ago, I lived in New Orleans for a number of years.  I made this to bring to a graduation celebration full of Louisiana-born families.  So I was a bit nervous if it would pass muster.  My "expert" there said it was 'very good' and there was barely any left (but I think he still likes his version better!) The recipe was clear to understand.  I doubled the recipe without problems and used 2 lbs raw frozen PEELED and DEVEINED shrimp and 24 oz (2 12 oz packages) of cooked frozen peeled crawfish tails. As another reviewer said, you could get by with less per serving.  I had to thaw them in cold water and did that while I chopped the vegetables. From start to finish, it was a little over 1-1/2  hours due to the prep time for the shrimp, and it took a bit longer to thicken at the end.  If I had to peel and devein the shrimp, I would have added significant time. Easy to take to the party in a crockpot to keep warm and a rice cooker with the rice.   A good recipe!

Really good stuff.   Onky change was that I made it with shell on shrimp and boiled the shells to make a broth.  Otherwise,  made just like recipe and would do it again.  My hubby sez this is a keeper!

Chef John does it again and because he does it so well I did also! I made this recipe tonight and it was really very good. I used a bigger shrimp because that is what I had, not too big though, 31-40 count shrimp and it had shells. I used the shells to make my stock which I added to the chicken broth. By the way, regarding the shrimp shells for stock, thanks to Chef John, I learned about that also. The only thing I would do different is to cut back just a tiny tad on the cayenne but other then that it was really good and my husband enjoyed it as well.

Must say I was disappointed. I usually love Chef Johns recipes. This was ok. I used 1/2 the amount of the three pepper spices. (Turned out not spicy enough so I added some homeMeade Cajun seasoning. ) Used bell pepper rather than green chili and more of it.

This was absolutely delicious!  I do substitute a few things, however.  We like ours creamy, so I used 1 cup chicken broth, the juice off of the shrimp, then added canned milk (was out of cream) until it was the right consistency for us.  I also substituted Old Bay seasoning for some of the spice blend, adding my own thyme, oregano, cracked red pepper and paprika to it.  It came out great!  Don't skip the steps on the preparation of the shrimp that he gives here either.  It made a huge difference in how flavorful the shrimp were in the dish.

Great with green chiles, but next time saute the veggies a little longer and a little less cayenne. Yet Chef John does it again.

Holy hotness!  This was fantastic, but definitely had to have a glass of milk handy to cool my mouth.  I will probably tone it down a bit next time on the spices, but it really is great as is if you like it spicy.

Delicious! My husband thought it tasted just like the étouffée we had eaten in New Orleans.  Would use a little less hot sauce next time as it was a bit spicy.

Learn from my mistake:  Do NOT used Rotel in place of tomatoes plus double the spice!  lol Sometimes I should just leave the recipe well enough alone! I usually like plenty of spice and find that a lot of recipes don't have enough, so I put in Rotel instead of regular diced tomatoes, mainly bc the recipe calls for diced green chili pepper (not green pepper!) and I didn't have any of those, so I figured that would be a good substitute! Plus, I doubled the spice recipe.  I spent a lot of time trying to fix my mistake by adding more chicken stock and then I had to make a slurry with the chicken stock bc it was then more like soup than a stew by that time! Oh well, it finally turned out and was still good!

loved this.  Essentially reduced fat to zero by just spritzing pan with non-stick and minimal butter for veggies.  Significantly increase veggies using half a large onion, a whole green pepper, most of a can of diced tomatoes and a few stalks of celery but did not adjust fluids. Just a great weeknight meal.

Very good. I did sub Rotel (regular) for the diced tomatoes, and used 1/2 teaspoon habanero sauce...we like spicy food. Will definitely make this again, and will probably take Chef John's cue and make with chicken in lieu of shrimp.

Love this. We like things spicy so added extra cayenne and it was perfect. Will definitely make this again. Frozen shrimp cooked perfectly by following directions to the letter.

Can I give it a 6 STAR?
This recipe was amazing!  We love spicy foods and this was perfect.  I made the "perfect rice" recipe, corn bread to serve with the Etouffee.  Noticed the holy Trinity mentioned green pepper not green chilies.  I used the green Chilies.  I asked my hubby who loves New Orleans food what he thought and he said it was better.  This recipe is a keeper.

I think I'm becoming Chef John's biggest fan.  This was outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly ... even used the frozen, soggy shrimp.   My husband almost ate the whole thing.   Thanks again, Chef John.

Following Chef John's note, I had some quick fry pork chops in the freezer so I thinly sliced and browned and added to the shrimp.  I found this easy to make and it came together quickly.  Loved it!  No leftovers.

LOVED it! Since we had frozen shrimp with shells on, I made shrimp stock and used that and chicken stock. Also had fresh tomatoes, and used red bell pepper for color rather than green chili pepper. My husband lost his mind, wanted a third helping... Chef John, our hero.

This recipe is awesome! I did a whole onion and green pepper but, I kept everything else the same. My boyfriend has lived and eaten all over Louisiana...so the pressure was on! It delivered! He can't stop raving about it! It's a keeper!

Made this for supper yesterday and it was wonderful!!  Used only shrimp this time but will try it with shrimp & chicken one day for sure.  Did not deviate from the recipe except for adding a few more veggies than the 1/3 cup called for.  Hubby loved it too.. yippee!!  Thanks for this great recipe, Chef John.. xox

Great Spicy Flavors!  Most Etouffe recipes have you simmer the Roux 15 minutes  or so with lots of oil and constant stirring, but this goes right for it and the flavor is still right on - just make sure you let the butter get just a tint of color for that extra flavor. Sauce has a bit of heat just as is . I used 2 tablespoons of spice mix and garnished with more to taste.  This pairs well with simple to make Jiffy Mix corn muffins...ohhh yeah!!  Will make this again for an easy but super flavorful meal when entertaining.

This recipe is absolutely simple and delicious. Only change I made us used fresh thyme and Oregano. Which made a significant difference for me. Added 1/2 lime for garnish. Impress your guests with this amazing recipe. Thanks chef john for the video.

Delicious! Doubled the recipe and glad I did! 
Used shrimp stock instead of chicken because I don't eat pork, beef or chicken. 

Will definitely make this one again!!!

I doubled everything except broth(used 3 cups) because I have five people to feed. This wonderful dish was a huge hit with the family! I also used chicken instead of shrimp, since (like Chef John) I'm not a huge fan. The video was very helpful & the dish turned out perfectly!

Delicious!  I left out the celery per personal preference and used both canned diced green chiles and canned diced tomatoes.  To make life even easier, I used "Ready Rice" that was ready in 90 seconds. Another winner from Chef John; THANKS!
