These are the best cookies!  I have to make them every year for a friend's birthday.  I usually use slightly less sugar than called for.  The 3 1/2 cups can be a little overpowering.  I love these!

These were excellent!  The whole batch was gone in three days.  I would add a bit more vanilla to the frosting because it tasted a bit too much like confectionary sugar.  However, I will be making them again this weekend.  Really recommend.

these are great for several reasons; foremost being a great way to use up buttermilk, they are economical to make, and use ingredients one usually has on hand.  They came out like a picture..more cakelike.  I did refrigerate the dough between batches because it does tend to get soft.  It is the end of my cookie bake and I'm lazy...I just threw on green or red colored sugars to the batches and they looked wonderful.  Golden brown on the bottom and soft cream looking on top.  I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. lemon extract to these...not overpowering...can just taste a hint of each and gives the cookie a wonderful flavor.  *this is also a great recipe for cookie bakes because not everyone likes sweet or chocolate.  A nice change from real rich and sweet.  They are perfect and definitely a keeper to make anytime.  I gave these away to elderly neighbors that I am sure don't eat nuts and chocolate too rich for them.  Thanks so much!  give these a try.

I am making these tonight for the 3rd time - we love them!  The cookie itself is not too sweet, so the frosting balances it perfectly and the crunchy nuts go great with the softness of the cookie.  A couple of notes: I am up to my ears in pecans, so that's what I've been using and they're great.  I also refrigerate the dough to stiffen it up just a little and then roll the cookies, rather than doing drops.  They just look cuter!  When I do a double batch, I get over 90 cookies, rather than the 72 it SHOULD make . . . not that I'm complaining!  They all get gobbled up regardless.  I've also discovered that they freeze (at least for a few days) quite well.  This has become my new basic sugar cookie dough recipe - thanks for sharing!

Super easy and turned out great. I made them smaller and baked for 8 min at 350. Made about 50 cookies. The frosting made just enough. I used sprinkles instead of nuts on top. Thanks Taste of home!

I thought this recipe was wonderful! Adding more vanilla is a good idea. Thanks for the recipe I'll use it many more times.

I was a little concerned my family would find these bland (since the cookies don't have chocolate chips, etc.), but everyone ate them straight out of the oven before I could frost them.

Excellent! Made these for a neighborhood BBQ and I should have made more - they were gobbled up! Had many compliments. Easy to make and turned out so soft - definitely a keeper. 
(note: I used powdered buttermilk and that worked great.)

These are really good. I used wheat flour instead of white and added a little extra buttermilk. I also doubled the vanilla and added a teaspoon of buttermilk powder and a tablespoon of milk powder. My husband ate about half a dozen once they were cooled. Great way to use up extra wheat flour & buttermilk.

These were delicious. Best when frosted and cooled. They didn't last long! I made the recipe as is.

Yum! These came out really good. Light, fluffy, and soft.  I refrigerated the dough for about an hour so that I could roll the dough into balls and then roll into a cinnamon/sugar mixture a la Snickerdoodles. I baked for 10 minutes and that was plenty. Pretty good sugar cookie. I would use again for cutout cookies too.

These cookies were alright.  One thing I did not like was the frosting, but the cookies had a pleasant taste to them.  Probably won't do again.
