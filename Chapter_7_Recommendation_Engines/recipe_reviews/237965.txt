Delicious! Unbelievably easy and quick. Overall a great recipe! I added a celery stock under the chicken did not have celery seed and used more garlic than recipe. My chicken was 5 1/2lbs and I cooked it for 25 minutes next time I'll cook it for 20-22 minutes. Great recipe to try.

I had some home grown chicken that was a little tuff, so I wanted to try a pressure cooker recipe. Usually I shy away from recipes that doesn't have a lot of reviews yet, but I'm glad I didn't on this one. I was more than pleased on how this turned out. I didn't have Marsala wine but I used port wine instead. I also only cooked a half of chicken as well. When I opened the cooker after it was done, it looked so good the way it was I omitted the oven browning process. I also may have over cooked everything just a tad because the onions, carrot and lemon became one as a really awesome sauce that we pour over the juicey chicken meat, loved the taste of the lemon in it! To me this recipe is a winner.

This was really easy and tasted delicious!! I did not have fresh herbs so I used dried and didn't use any thyme in the chicken. It fell off of the bone. I made the sauce into a gravy with corn starch. Easy beginner recipe for cooking with the pressure cooker.

UNBELIEVABLY awesome chicken. The lemons at the bottom were even delicious. The photos are absolutely horrid so just ignore them. I made it with a quartered chicken and some cut up chicken breasts and adapted the recipe for 8 people in an 8QT pressure cooker. I skipped the broiling part and served it in a tagine with the sauce. From the 4 year olds to the adults everyone seemed to love it.

The chicken fell apart when I removed it from the pressure cooker. The garlic didn't just squeeze out. The sauce is delicious even though I had to substitute sherry for the Marsala wine and substituted yellow mustard turmeric and cyanine pepper for brown mustard.

This was a little disappointing. My chicken was I think 5-6 lbs and it took like an hour to cook - no big deal. But the breast came out really weird - like rubbery and chewy almost. The dark meat was good though. Next time I will stick to traditional oven roasting for a whole chicken.

I used a different recipe but stuck to this method essentially. I used Roast Chickens with Plums by Melissa Clark in the NYTimes. I prepped the chicken as she instructed. On the bottom of the electric pc I put 4 quartered plums 2 large shallots cut in 1/4" circles and 1 TB olive oil. I shoved a seated lemon in the cavity of the chicken and then rested it on top of the plums and shallots. I poured 1/4 cup chuckle stock. I cooked one 4lb chicken on the "meat/poultry" setting for 22 minutes. I let the chicken sit for 5 minutes before I manually released the pressure. I broiled the chicken plums and shallots for 5 minutes. Perfection! I'm going to do it with the other chicken now.

I had almost all ingredients- i did sub dry thyme in lieu of fresh and chicken broth in lieu of vege broth and Dijon mustard instead of brown- still turned out perfect.

This was delicious! I made it as written and wouldn t change anything except allow the chicken to cook longer in the pressure cooker. I removed the chicken to a deep cast iron skillet to brown and needed to leave it in a 400 degree oven until the chicken arrived at done. Once the chicken was done I strained the juices from the pressure cooker into the cast iron skillet and scraped all the pan drippings the sauce was delicious and this recipe is a keeper!

I'm really disappointed. My chicken is on its third round of 20 minutes in the pressure cooker. I thought maybe my chicken was too big but I couldn't find a weight on the recipe. When reading the reviews there were people that Hass chickens bigger than mine and said it was wonderful so I have no idea what went wrong! It smells awesome but I don't think I'll try again.

I obviously did something different than everyone else. After 18 minutes in the pressure cooker (not counting the time it spent getting up to pressure) the chicken was registering at 145 degrees. I put it back in for another 6 minutes (again that's after it got up to pressure again). When I opened the lid this it a thermometer in the deepest part of the thigh read 165 F. I pulled it out and the the skin fell off (meaning I wasn't going to be able to brown it. Then when I cut into the breasts they were still raw! I finally gave up covered it with foil and put it in the oven. Has anyone else had problems with their birds cooking so unevenly? I had the bird breast side down.
