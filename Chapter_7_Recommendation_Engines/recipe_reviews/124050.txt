I really liked this recipe. Made a great nutritious yet quick breakfast. Only thing I did differently was use only 1 cup of milk, add 10 ice cubes and added a tad bit more peanut butter and jelly. I like my shakes a bit thicker.

Tasted great and so easy to make! I used a frozen banana and just one cup of milk instead of two. The consistency was nice and thick thanks to the frozen banana. Perfect for breakfast on the go!

This is the best breakfast I've ever made.  The only thing's I changed were, using soy milk, freezing the banana's and adding 1 tablespoon of honey to it.  It's GREAT!  I think it's a breakfast that will stay with me till lunch too.

Wow. I made this for my son to go with his breakfast and had a little swig before I gave it to him. You have to REALLY like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to drink this. My son FLIPPED for it. I found it to be a bit intense, but I'm not big on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. If you need a quick pick-me-up and out of bread, this smoothie is for you!

I made this with probably a cup and a half of soy milk and about 4 ice cubes, and about half the pb&j. So good!! I will definitely be making this again in the near future.

I thought this recipe sounded good and that my kids would like it, but I'd honestly have to say that this was not good. I made it exactly to the ingredients, but found it tasted too bland as well as it was way too warm - not something a shake (or smoothie) should be. After adding a few ingredients it tasted ALOT better. I grinded up 1/4c of oats, added about 1/2c (eyeballed it) vanilla yogurt and a handful of frozen strawberries.

I drink these shakes almost every morning for breakfast, only I don't use jelly. I also add crushed ice. Yum!

Very Tasty & Husband (kid-like) said, "MMMMmmmmm Good!".  I tweaked the recipe a bit to suit both of our needs (I am allergic to dairy, and my husband wanted more strawberries as well as a thicker shake - frozen yogurt).  Overall a very good recipe that is easily adjustable to suit everyone's desires!

this was a little too runny, so i'm giving it a "4." i am going to try freezing bananas next time, and possibly substitute frozen strawberries for the jam.  i'll report back next try... it was a good enough concept to "tweak!" and repeat.

Too much banana for me.  When I doubled the jam it was perfect! FABULOUS!

This is really good! I only gave it the 4 stars because I like mine to be a little thicker. I even put half of the milk but it's still too runny for my taste. But for all of you peanut butter lovers... Try it!

This was very delicious and had a very pleasing texture as well. But CREAMY peanut butter must be used!! After making this a few times I ran out of creamy and grabbed some chunky and it felt so gross in my mouth.  This was also very easy to prepare ahead of time. I take it to work with me for a healthy breakfast on the go!!

Shake tasted great. I took the advice of a couple other folks and just added one cup of milk, some ice, a little honey and vanilla. I did not add the jelly. Great healthy shake!!

I made this for my sister this afternoon and she downed all of it in about 10 minutes. this is a great simple recipe, it tastes great the only down side was if you are really looking for something that tastes like peanut butter and jelly you need to add more peanut butter and jelly

I thought this was pretty good and so did my grandma. But my brother on the other hand couldn't finish it. But i ll definitely be making it again when i m in the mood. You cant really taste the jelly mostly only the peanut butter and banana. But i enjoyed this shake before lunch.

This was heaven!! For someone who loves PB&J sandwiches, and ice cream this was THE BOMB! Totally satisfied my PG&J/ice cream cravings. Will make again! Only change I made was adding a bit of ice to make it smoothie like. I could have frozen the banannas if I wanted to wait.

I would say this is "flavored milk" instead of a thick milkshake.  It's quite thin.  The taste is interesting but I think substituting some ice cream for the milk would help.  I also noticed it got warm just from the other ingredients added and from whipping it for a few minutes.  With a little tweaking, I may try this recipe again.  :-)

Being Australian I am just getting used to the idea of PB&J sandwiches let alone a PB&J shake but I tried it and now I like it! It was a little sweet for me but nothing that can't be adjusted.
