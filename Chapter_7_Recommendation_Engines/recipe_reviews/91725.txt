This was good, but I think it would have been better without the water and sweetened condensed milk.  (sorry eagle).  I think this would be perfect using instant pudding, milk, and cool whip, and only 1/2 tsp. almond extract, as the flavor was very strong.  I also substituted strawberries for cherries, which was also good.
