We really enjoyed this recipe. I baked it in a foil packet as recommended and that kept it very moist and full of flavour. We poured more of the sauce over the salmon once it was baked to add more of the flavour. I bet this would be delicious on the BBQ as well! We'll make it again!

Where's the tequila? I wonder if that would taste good! This is a nice simple marinade. I added chopped garlic and a dash of cayenne. Served with curried rice pilaf from this site and sauteed swiss chard. Delish! For the cook who tried to marinate coho salmon..I have also tried to marinate coho but with a different recipe. It also did not work, so I believe the problem is with the fish, not this particular recipe. For some reason the coho just does not absorb any type of marinade. Maybe because it's so lean and firm-fleshed?

Hands down my favorite salmon recipe.  The lime juice and the honey cut through the richness of the salmon and make it very light and fresh tasting.

I have made this a few times now and each time I get rave reviews!! My secret is I add a splash of tequila to the marinade and let it marinade longer than 30 minutes....who ever heard of a margarita without a little tequila??

This recipe needs some major rework. It is bland to a fault, I will definitely not be using as-is again. I used fresh caught coho salmon (what a waste!). Next time I will add pressed garlic, kosher salt and reduce the olive oil to 1/2 tsp. As it stands, the marinade does not permeate the fish at all!

This recipe was fabulous.  I used sockeye salmon and  I added a shot of tequila and cilantro to the marinade.  I served it with a cold orzo salad with feta cheese, spinach, red onion and balsamic vinegar.  I will be making this often

This recipe was great base!!  I customized it using juice of 3 limes, 1/4 c. honey, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, sliced green onions, and 1 tsp.  minced garlic. I marinated it for 2 hours.  I used the foil method and added more fresh lime before serving.  We ate spaghetti squash with this dish and it was a perfect complement.

This was delicious.  I recommend marinating the salmon longer- a few hours or so.  I ran out of brown sugar so I added a ½ tablespoon of Karo syrup (brown sugar variety) to the other ingredients.  I also hit the salmon with the broiler for 5 minutes to slightly brown it up a bit on the top.  Fantastic lighter dish.

This was yummy! It was very light tasting and easy to make. I had to replace the orange blossom honey with clover honey. Either way it I will still be cooking this one again.

WOW!! Wonderfully easy and delicious =D The Boyfriend drooled and loved it as well. He usually is tired of salmon because we eat it pretty frequently, but he raved about this recipe.   I added sprinkling of cayenne pepper for spice, garlic powder, and also sesame seeds.  I wrapped it in foil too, and it came out great!  THANKS!!

This was so yummy! I didn’t measure very well so probably had a bit more lime and honey than called for. I also added 1 Tbl tequila—you could add more if you like. (Not sure why it was called Margarita Salmon – didn’t seem to taste like one at all) and cooked it on top the stove in a covered frying pan – oven off, summer, hot!!! I also served it with thinly sliced green onions on top for color and flavor. It was nice to drizzle some of the sauce over the fish on your plate. I served this with Mexican Rice (Rice-a-Roni) with one small can petite diced tomatoes (using some of the liquid in the rice and 1/2 chopped onion) and a veggie. VERY good, and will make often!!!

Fantastic salmon.. got my brother to eat salmon even though he's not a fish person.  I loved the flavours and marinated it for less time than written.  Wrapped it in a big piece of foil to bake with all the honey-lime mixture to soak in.

This is a wonderful dish.  I have made it twice in 2 weeks.  I paired it with a green cilantro rice that was spicy and complimented the dish wonderfully.  I made sure to pour the remaining of the marinade all over the salmon before cooking and I think this helped with the flavor.  It's simple and easy and flavorful!

I used regular honey b/c that is what I had on hand.  I just didn't get this.  Maybe the flavor was odd due to the honey.  I tried to use a foil bag as others suggested but the salmon was still cold at the end of the cooking time so I ditched the bag and cooked them in a dish.  We ate them but I will not be making them again.

Yum! baked in foil as well, with a light dusting of cayenne pepper in addition to the fresh ground black pepper. No salt or brown sugar at all. Served on a bed of herb rice and organic steamed broccoli, with a tablespoon of extra marinade poured over before serving & lime slices on top.

I prepared this for my family this evening.  Everyone liked it, including my 4 kids, ages 11-2.  I cooked the salmon in the oven in individual foil packets which kept it moist and tender.  I decided to make this recipe at the last minute so I didn't have time to marinate.  It was still good.  I served with the Roasted Asparagus and Garlic, also on this site and orzo.  A great meal!

i used this recipe more as a guide since i had no idea what would taste good with salmon. i didnt measure anything but i know i used more than the recipe called for i just mixed together in a bowl the oil, lime juice, honey and brown sugar so it was like a thick sauce i added garlic powder, lemon pepper seasoning, salt and pepper put them in foil pouches also and it turned out GREAT!

After seeing the photo of this dish I just had to try this. I increased the amount of marinade for a 3lb. salmon...got to love the serving tool calculator. I used clover honey since it was I had on hand. I did add three cloves of fresh minced garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper. Marinated for two hours in a large ziplock bag in the refrigerator turning often. We grilled this directly on charcoal grill with NO foil. Browned the flesh side just enough for grill marks then placed the skin side over indirect heat for about twenty min. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the marinade left in the ziplock bag and hubby used that to keep basting the fish while cooking. This was a hit with my sons and their gals bigtime! Served with the Lime Cilantro rice from this website. There was not one bit of leftovers. Great summertime grilling recipe. Thanks Allison for submitting it.

This was my first time ever making salmon (usually my husband grills it), and it was soooo good!  We were all glad I made a lot, because seconds were had and then fabulous leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will definitely make this again!

I didn't have any lime juice so I substituted lemon juice and I only had clover honey. Other than that, I made the recipe as is. It turned out nice, hubby liked it. It was light. I may try marinating it longer next time.

Pretty good salmon!!!  I had plain old regular honey so that's what I used!  Still super yummy, had a sweet flavor throughout the entire fillet!!  I think I might add more seasoning next time but still a really good recipe!  Thanks a lot, I love salmon and am always looking for new ways to make it!!!

Loved this.  I let it marinade a full 24hrs with the salmon and even tossed in some asparagus for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  It all turned out great.

My husband & I love this recipe!!  One time I made this, I didn't have the lime juice, but I did have Rose's Lime Juice (it's a sweetened lime juice used in cocktails) and used that instead.  Now I substitute that all the time.

I grilled this instead of baking it in a foil packet as the recipes says.  I think I should have marinated it much longer since I was grilling.  However, it had a great flavor and we had no leftovers.

Although my family did actually like this recipe, it was a tad odd for us to have sweet salmon. The marinate is extremely easy to make, but I the fish doesn't cook very well in the time allotted.

I thought it was a little "too good to be true" that there were such great reviews of this dish without many recommendations for adjustments.  I made this true to the recipe and it was FANTASTIC!!  This will be a staple recipe in our home.  My brother-in-law was ready to lick his plate!!  The only thing that I may change in the future is cutting the honey to 1 1/2 tablespoons.

As recommended by others, I added a touch of minced garlic to the marinade and covered the dish with foil while cooking.  Fantastic! Served it with rice, asparagus and margaritas of course!

this recipe was good, but i tweaked it a little bit. i made the marinade batch with a little more than it called for and added ginger, and after the fish cook, sprinkled just a TOUCH more on top, and it was perfect. i've used it on shrimp, too.

The recipe is very sweet.  The "margarita" title would suggest a saltier, lime-ier taste. Yet, the honey and brown sugar create more of a candy taste.  Either way, it's not bad.

I ran out of time to grill my salmon, so I quickly found this one.  It only sat in the marinade as long as it took to heat the oven, but it was very nice.  A little sweet, but next time I'll reduce the honey a bit.  I even threw some small chicken breasts in with it, and so had to cook it longer than the salmon needed, but because it's so saucy, the salmon didn't suffer.  A good, go-to, quick recipe.

This is now my go to recipe for salmon.  I love that it doesn't overpower the salmon - just gives it a great taste.  We marinade for an hour or so and then grill.  My husband says it's a keeper!

I made this with fresh coho salmon and thought it was delicious.  I'm not a big fish eater so for me to think it was good, it is really good!  I followed the recipe just as printed.  I'm going to try it again this weekend but will give it a try with a splash of tequilla!

marinated overnight was the only exception because someone said the salmon didn't have flavor. I baked in foil and everyone at my table agreed, the salmon still lacked flavor.   Hmmm...thanks for posting though

The marinade flavor didn't come through too well for me.  Followed instructions.  It just tasted like plain grilled salmon.

I agree with a couple of the other reviews - this was ok, but nothing remarkable. I marinaded the salmon for about 6 hours, and it still wasn't wildly flavorful (I don't see how 30 mins would do anything at all). Thanks anyway.

Delicious!  I recommend saving a small amount of marinade (pre-salmon exposure) on the side to be able to add a little more flavor after it finishes baking.  But all in all I can't complain.  My daughter who claims to hate salmon liked it!  can't ask for more than that!

Delicious! My husband, who grew up eating salmon, loved it! I think I will use Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning instead of salt next time to give a little “heat” to the dish.

Absolutely delicious!  The flavors compliment each other so well!  We grilled the salmon instead of baking it!  we served it with Caribbean rice, sweet potatoes, and broccoli slaw.

I tried this for an early Christmas lunch with some pescatarian cousins.  Very light and flavourful, perfect for a December afternoon in the Caribbean.  My only change was to season the salmon with our local green seasoning before marinating.

Based on a reviewer's recommendation I added a splash of tequila and increased the marinade. Before baking the salmon I poured off the excess marinade and reduced it slightly in a saucepan, then drizzled it on the salmon when serving. Delicious!

We made this recipe as is but doubled the recipe and added 2 tablespoons of tequila. We marinated for 45 minutes in a Ziplock bag. We used Sockeye Salmon. We all loved the flavor and it was very easy to make.

Added seasoning salt, garlic and onion powder. Substituted with Gran Marnier to get orange flavor since I only had regular honey. Also let it marinate for 3 hours which allowed the fish to absorb almost all of the marinade.

We used trout, actually, instead of salmon, but my wife and I really liked it. We added a little bit of garlic powder sprinkled over the fish. It was kind of bland, but with a little salt it was awesome.

3 stars for the original recipe. My friends loved what I did with it. I followed the suggestion to add tequila & cilantro. I used a shot & at least a Tablespoon respectively. Let is marinate for 30-45 minutes & put it on the grill for 15. Awesome. Thanks for the base!!

I usually do not like salmon but really liked this recipe, so did my husband. It is easy to make too. I also used the lime zest. I would give this recipe a 3/5.
