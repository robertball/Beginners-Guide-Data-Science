Great and flexible.  The key to this one is the 1/2 C. Oil, Vinegar, Sugar (I did go with a little less sugar), and Onion. Keep those 4 items together in 1 part each and you can add lots of different things to this. Pasta, all types of Beans, salad greens, other veggies. It is really very flexible and yummy.

Love it!  I've been making this recipe for years and literally crave it!  Goes so great with grilled chicken.  My version uses seasoned salt instead of regular salt and also 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  Also, make sure you use cut green beans and not french style.  I mix my dressing in a large bowl and THEN add the veggies to wash one less bowl!:)

This really is the best ever! Be sure to rinse the legumes. I don't usually use Spenda but used a 1/2 cup in this instead of sugar (New Year Resolutions and all that!). Darn, I made this to clean out some cans from the pantry and I may just have to go buy some more!! Thanks! UPDATE: I have been making this constantly since this review and keep in containers in the frig for a quick healthy lunch! It's so easy to make and lasts the whole week! Thanks again!!

This was a terrific bean salad!  I got alot of compliments on this...I let the salad sit overnight to marinate...we had left-overs and let me tell you, this salad gets better the longer it sits and marinates, 2-4 days later and it was even better tasting!  It's a keeper!

This was great! Very simple, but still delicious! I used red wine vinegar, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup based on other reviews, and it was perfect.  It was quite liquidy, so I think I may add more beans next time.  I'll definitely make this again!

Made this with what I had on hand- a one pound bag of red beans (prepared), some frozen wax pepper slices, red onion, celery, red wine vinegar, olive oil, honey instead of sugar, salt, pepper and garlic (as per another review.) It was DELICIOUS and kept for over a week. I think the secret is the sweet-sour-oil ratio, that with any combination of beans, veggies and spices would make a great salad!

I grew up on this salad. The variety of beans provides more fiber and nutrition than other bean salads on this site. My mom always used 2/3c. olive oil or a canola/vegetable/olive oil combo to equal the 2/3c., 3/4c. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR (white is too strong), 1/2c. Splenda or 3/4c. sugar.
The salad gets better with age so we try to make it 2-4 days ahead of the party. If you cannot make it ahead of time, microwave the drained and rinsed garbanzo and kidney beans for 60 seconds and the wax and green beans for 30 seconds; the black beans turn to mush if microwaved. Microwaving  the beans softens them so the dressing is absorbed much quicker. I use my salad spinner to drain and rinse the beans--garbanzo and kidney beans together, dump in the plastic bag or bowl, then I spin the green and wax beans. This also mixes the beans together which results in less breakage or mushy beans. If I'm taking this to a party, I prepare the recipe in a gallon ziploc bag, pack in a cooler with ice blocks on the bottom, and then put in the bowl when I get to the party. The ziploc bag allows me to mix the beans/marinade together easily and the clean up is so easy. If you don't have ground black pepper, use 1tsp. celery seeds. I omit the salt from the recipe.

This is delicious. I halved the recipe and made it for my family. The kids loved it. I had some zesty italian dressing I needed to use up and so I subbed that for the green pepper, celery, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. I added slightly less sugar. Also, be sure to wash the beans, I didn't and there was unappealing bubbles in the salad. This would be a great dish to bring to a potluck.

Super easy and super delicious.  I agree with the other reviewers, the salad gets better the longer it marinates.

This was SO good!  We always make recipes exactly as written the first time through. It was wonderful! There was 1 exception - no green peppers - we used red peppers instead. We let it sit for two days (although hubby was sneaking out spoonfuls) and served it with bratwurst. I am not always a big fan of bean salad, but even I wanted seconds!  The vinegar/sugar combo is a real winner, making a fresh-tasting salad. Some of the beans were little "al dente", but that's prob the brand of canned beans used. We are going to try it again and double the wax beans, add red and yellow peppers, and maybe some radishes. It's all good, and it is so pretty on the plate! Love it - thanks for sharing!

No need to look further for a three (or more) bean salad recipe.  This is a winner!

I've always enjoyed a basic "three bean salad" but this is even better.  Although it's not mentioned, I will rinse off the black and red kidney beans next time, so less interference with the dressing.  Very good, thanks!

Great bean salad. I have never liked bean salad but had to bring a dish to a picnic and had several cans of beans so I decided to give it a try. My husband even liked it and he does not like bean salad either. I used organic soybeans, organic black beans, org. kidney beans, org. chick peas, I used frozen org. green beans that I lightly steamed. Also used honey instead of sugar. I am making this again tonight.

I've made this for a few years now.  I stick wiht the basic recipe exept I use red wine vinagar and use 1/2 cup sugar.  

To "spice" it up, I also add black olives, walnuts, and broccolit.  I've takin it to partys and get togethers and that  is now my dish to bring.  Guess that says something about it.

I had some blanched green beans left over and some corn on the cob from 4th of July...so...I made this.  I read reviews and cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup, but still it was far too sugary for my taste, but I ate it anyway.  I should have used a few Tablespoons? or maybe only 1 or 2?  But the basic idea is fine.  Used red wine vinegar.  Thanks!

Save Calories, use splenda instead of sugar. You won't know the difference.

I only used 1/4 cup of sugar to try and I thought it was perfect.  I think if I had used the 3/4 cup, it would have been too sweet for me.  Also only used about 2T olive oil (instead of salad oil) - it didn't need anymore moisture. Because I didn't read the instructions carefully enough, I only made this about an hour before I wanted to serve it.  It was very good, even only having marinated that long, but I'll agree that the overnight marinade was awesome!  I'll definitely be making this again!

I make mine very similarly, but use less green beans as they aren't a fav. in my family. I add corn to the mix as well and use both green and red bell pepper. I also like to include blanched broccoli florets and stems or cauliflower if I have them. Chopped peeled carrot is good if you want added crunch. This salad is very versatile, so you can mix it up to suit your tastes! Good Season's salad dressing and about 1/2 to 1 Tbs sugar is enough, depending on how much salad I'm making. This is something that is so good that I love to snack on it!

Terrific -- yes, the key is equal parts of the marinade; oil, vinegar [I used vegetable oil and red wine vinegar], and sugar [careful here too, I went with my taste].  I did not use 3/4 of a cup, probably closer to a half cup of sugar.  I also made this the night before I served it so that the marinade would marry with the other ingredients.

Also, yes, you can use this marinade with probably limitless ingredients.  I just used one can each / dark red kidney beans, black beans, some onion, some celery and actually, threw in some corn.  Omitted the green, garbanzo and wax beans.  Notice however, that I am 3 bean/cans short of the recipe as written yet went with the same liquid measurements as written.  I don't believe there's any harm in having extra marinade  -- in fact, I think the more marinade, the more tasty this dish becomes.  You can use a slotted spoon to remove and serve the beans from the marinade so that it does not resemble soup.  Excellent dish -- my husband finished it before he even touched his burger.  There's your sign.

This is like the three bean salad you find at a deli, but better!  I don't use canned beans, though that's the only way I could find the wax beans.  So, I used canned wax, frozen green, and dried garbanzo, kidney, and black that I'd previously cooked and frozen.

I liked this. The wax beans do get mushy in it though and I wouldn't use them the next time. Definitely on the sweet side and I only added 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time will cut that amount down some more. Nice alternative for a potluck dish! Thanks for the recipe!

I have been using this recipe for years and it is excellent but my recipe, while not using garbanzo beans, adds bean sprouts, water chestnuts & shoepeg corn.  This recipe goes with just about anything and like one reviewer said, it gets better as it gets older.

I apparently hate bean salad. I made this recipe (never had bean salad before) and was about to throw it out and my sister stopped me. Her and her husband LOVED it. I make it regularly just for them :) So 5 stars from them!

I adore AllRecipes and other online recipe sites.  But when I have doubts about proportions, I go back to my tried and true, trusted cookbooks to see what they say.  I will be darned if the latest version of Joy of Cooking (1997) doesn't call for the exact same proportions for the dressing of a bean salad,  and with a lot less beans.  
But sometimes you have to just get real with yourself and your personal tastes and say, "Whoa, that is waaaay too much sugar."  I cut back by half, and I'm glad I did.
Otherwise,I thought it was a great, versatile and adaptable recipe.  Thank you, chemjo!

I liked it, but it didn't go over well at all at Christmas.  Barely got touched, i'm sure its a small part to do with all the delicious turkey, potatoes and gravy, but even the ones who tried it weren't crazy about it.

This was very very good.  I like that it is so fast and easy to make.  I also thought it was a little too sweet, so I cut down sugar to 1/3 C and it worked well.  For a really low-sugar batch, I've used 1/4 C or less coconut sugar and 5-7 drops of liquid Stevia.

Though we prefer it without the wax beans. We  always use raspberry vinegar, and I wouldn't go back to regular vinegar for this salad.

This excellent!  So easy and delicious. All I did differently was cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Next time I will try honey like someone suggested.  Made this as 1 of 4 salads for a party and it was a huge hit.  I make this for myself for lunch and as a side with dinner.  Leftovers are great and it lasts all week.

As is, this salad is WAAAAY too sweet for us.  I cut back the sugar some, but next time will only do 1-2 Tablespoons.  Other than that, I think it's a great basic recipe, and I will make it again.

Best bean salad ever! I use stevia instead of sugar and sometimes 1 can of drained julienne beets just to change it up a bit. I keep a container of this on hand at all times and use it in salads and in tortilla wraps with leftover chicken or salmon.

mmmmmmmmmmmmm....so good.Like other reviewers ,I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. More than enough.I used olive oil as that is all I had. Some people who ate it thought I could have still used less sugar. Next time I will try less and use cut frozen green and waxed beans boiled for a few minutes as the canned beans turned to mush oce you stirred it all together. . So good.  A definate keeper.

I love bean salad and this one will replace the store bought premade bean salad I usually get. Very good...and easy.

My only negative is I found it too sweet for my personal taste. Im gonna drop the sugar down to 1/2 cup next time and see how that is.

Made this with just the 1/2 cup of sugar as other reviewers mentioned and found it plenty sweet.  Fantastic recipe!! By day two the flavours are awesome.  Will definitely be making this again - great to bring for work lunches.

This was great. No complaints. But there are a few things I did differently for personal preference. I used purple onion, and a combination of green and red peppers. It looks nice with the color. Also I prefer a little lemon juice in mine. I tasted it without first, and it was good, a better balance of oil, vinegar, and sugar then I usually get, but with a squirt of lemon juice its just perfect.

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and was a great hit,, I made a few changes,, I used cut green beans, black beans, garbonzo beans and pinto beans,, did not use wax or kidney,, i did mix in a small can of mexican corn for a little extra color and flavor,, I will use less sugar next time and will change up the vinegar to red wine,, but this is a true winner and so glad I found this on your website..

I loved this!  I decreased the salt down to 1/4 tsp. and used Splenda instead of sugar.  This made 8 cups for me, so I am figuring it to be 16 (1/2 cup) servings.

I used stevia instead of sugar (you use a lesser amount of stevia than sugar) and decreased the oil because my hubby is trying to lose weight (healthier for everyone all around.)  He wasn't sure he would like bean salad, but he agreed with me--it's delicious. We will be having this again.

This is a great bean salad.  I have been making it similarly for years.  The oil/vinegar/sugar mixture is essential for keeping the salad in your fridge longer.  As many reviewers said...the salad gets better with age.  It will last a couple of weeks in the fridge with the salad dressing noted in the recipe.

Made it for a barbecue, followed the recipe exactly except used frozen green & wax beans.  Defrosted and cooked them for about 3 minutes in the microwave.  In addition to draining the canned beans I rinsed them under cold tap water.  Reduced sugar to  scant 1/4 cup super fine sugar due to other reviewers commenting that amount of sugar called for in the recipe made it too sweet.  Made it a day ahead. Will definitely make it again, it was a hit! (Used apple cider vinegar)

How exciting can bean salad be?!  Well, I find this to be pretty darn exciting and am getting rather addicted to it!  I don't know what it is about this recipe,  but I find myself going to the kitchen and eating a few spoonsful every now and then.  I'm a sweets lover, but the second time I made this I cut the sugar a bit, and it's still wonderful.  There's always a lot of the "juice" at the bottom of the container, so I might cut back a bit on the oil and vinegar next time I make this...I can always add more back  into the mix if it's not enough.  I think the vinegar choice would make a difference.  I used Marukin rice vinegar, which I'm also addicted to.   Time to go get another spoonful...

This bean salad is delish! I usually use apple cider vinegar and less sugar (less than 1/2 a ) and often add a bell pepper. I typically avoid black beans as they seem to fall apart more easily.

I love this! I used some different beans and only used 6 Tbs of sugar, but you could really add anything you want to this simple marinade dressing. I took it to a potluck and got asked for the recipe. Thank you!

Good basic recipe just needs a little tweaking...  Way too much sugar cut the sugar in half and I used Splenda.. we don't care for garbanzo beans so I use either  butter beans or wax beans to  keep the colors bright and interesting also minced a fat clove of garlic.  This is great with  Barbecue chicken pork chops even hamburgers on the grill  refreshing and light for summer

Almost as good as Mom's! I left out the garbanzo and black beans-taste preference, and this was great. I also heated the oil, vinegar, sugar while stirring and after it cooled poured it over beans and veggie mixture.

Way too sweet.  I always make a recipe as given the first time, and we all thought it was too sweet.  Next time I will only add about 1 tablespoon of sugar to cut the vinegar a little.  Other than that, we liked it and will make it again.

Was trying to find a recipe that could compete with my mother-in-law's bean salad.  Followed this one exactly.  My husband liked it and said it was very easy to eat.  The longer it sat, the more he liked it.  His brother said it was better than his mom's and swore me to secrecy.  :)  Thanks!  BTW... for those who can`t find garbanzo beans... they are chickpeas.

Wonderful salad! I like the crunch that the celery, onions, and green pepper give it. I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 C since my husband doesn't like his food too sweet...go figure. Also, I made a mistake and put in chili beans which had been packed in a chili tomato sauce. Even though I rinsed off the sauce, it added an interesting dimension to the flavor, so it worked out ok. I will definitely make this again since it is a very versatile recipe. I may try adding red peppers, carrots, and zucchini next time.

Started making this over the hot summer.  It was sooo good.  I took it to a camp out and 2 bbq's and all three times I was asked for the recipe.  It's one of the keepers I will enjoy for a lifetime.  Quick, easy, delicious...no changes needed.

I modified this and used dark red kidney beans, great northern beans, black beans and green lentils. I used a tablespoon of good oil and 1/2 cup red wine vinegar a splash of rice vinegar and a dash of honey to sweeten.

I eliminated the sugar from the dressing and used fresh green beans and cranberry beans. Tossed the hot, cooked beans with the oil and vinegar dressing and let cool to room temperature. Delicious!

I need to make more than the recipe called for, so I doubled the green and wax beans and added canelli beans as well.  I used less oil  and 3/4 vinegar, we found it a little sweet at first.  This is delicious, and I will make it all summer long.  No more deli salad for me!

Yum! Definitely tastes better after chilling for awhile in the fridge-to let the dressing soak in. I used frozen green beans, 1/2 cup of sugar, and left out the wax beans. Husband and children also liked it!

I doubled the onion and celery and diced bell pepper (just personal preferences) and this was terrific.  It got better and better everyday.  With just two of us it lasted a little over a week and kept well in the refrigerator. Loved it, thanks for sharing

Another great recipe for the diet-conscious!  I got really great feedback when I made this for my TOPS group, and had to supply the recipe to everyone! I didn't have black beans or kidney beans on hand, so I sub'd with a tin of chili-style beans, which I drained prior to adding them.  It was really really good! I'd recommend this to everyone!

Well I only got one serving after making this the first time, because I wanted to wait a day for the flavours to blend. But by then, everyone else had eaten most of it. I only used half the sugar, and I'm making more right now, cutting it back to 1/4 cup. That'll teach em! Yummy!

Love this salad! It can be made in 15 minutes and sustain you for  a week.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 a cup. It's perfect.

I only used yellow beans in my salad . I added corn too which it showed in the pic bit not in the ingredients . Went on my own for dressing -
with 2-3 swirls of  kraft Zesty Italian dressing and a sprinkle of vinegar & sugar . 
Best one I’ve made yet

It really was the best bean salad ever!  We cut back on the sugar.  Skipped the green pepper, but added garlic.  Only change for the next batch would be to cut down on the oil.

Very simple yet delicious. As many reviewers have suggested, I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  I also left out the green pepper and celery, but put a little extra onion. DELICIOUS!

It’s a good start. For us even after reducing the sugar and increasing the vinegar it was still too sweet. 
The recipe makes a lot of salad, which for just 2 or 3 people... you’ll be eating bean salad at every  meal for several days. I think next time I’ll try frozen instead of canned where I am able. 
I added a red bell pepper for taste and color, a can of corn, a can of peas and a small can of sliced black olives. I omitted the black beans because we don’t care for their flavor and the garbanzo beans I forgot.
I’ll keep the recipe in my favorites as I should be able to tweak it to our tastes.

I was an anti-bean person and I must say that this recipe has transformed me into a multi-bean lover.   As written  it  provides a sweet, not sour/vinegar tasting , cold bean salad with lots of potential  for adding  or subtracting ingredients and having a successful, easy dish every time.

Whoops. Well, I didn't read the reviews first, but I agree: reduce the sugar! Otherwise a fine salad . Note that starting with five cans of beans means you've  got a whopper of a salad.

I used red wine vinegar & equal parts oil, vinegar and sugar (1/2 cup). I did not use exactly the same beans recommended due to availability -- and prefer to use blanched fresh green beans, which made it all the more amazing.  The salad got better and better each day. Like the addition of chickpeas as they hold up well to the dressing. Blanched julienned carrots also added nice additional color.

My old Better Homes and Garden's BBQ cookbook is packed for our upcoming move, so I came looking for this specific recipe. Bingo! I grew up eating this salad and it was always one of the things my dad requested whenever he visited our home. It is a true comfort food for me. . . It is easy to add other vegetable to the mix--I love little corn cobs on mind. I now use olive oil  for the dressing and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup. Keeper!

I omitted the garbanzo beans as my son doesn't like them. For the dressing 1/4 cup each oil, vinegar and zesty Italian light salad dressing. I reduced the suagr to 3 tbps which was fine for us. I used red pepper, green onion and celery for my vegetables. Added some salt, pepper and Mrs Dash garlic & herb. Good basic recipe, needs some tweaking for our tastes, could not imagine using the whole sugar amount.

The hit of the Family Memorial Day weekend.  No wax beans so substituted with artichoke hearts.  Used Red Wine vinegar which didn’t give it the kick needed so added to taste the white vinegar.....Faboo!

I cut the sugar in half and it was still sweeter than I expected. But everyone liked it! I was looking for a more vinegar bite, so I will add a sprinkle of red wine vinegar to my personal serving.

Very good! I admit I did make a couple of changes. I used jalapeno black beans just because that sounded interesting. Added a slight heat.  Also left out the sugar and added more vinegar because I don't like sweet pickles. Next time I want to find how to can it.

This bean salad was easy to make.  I substituted 2 heaping tablespoons of Splenda for the sugar, but other than that, made it the way it's stated.  I found it a bit bland, so I added lots of fresh cilantro, which kicked it up a notch, for our tastes.  Thanks for the recipe.

Kept to the equal parts of sugar, oil and vinegar and the next day added a little extra vinegar emulsified with oil, as we prefer a bit more tartness.  This is the best bean salad we've had.  A chef taught me to peel green peppers before putting them in a salad - try it.  You can either peel them or blacken the skins and remove them that way.

This is a delicious bean salad, enjoyed by the whole family. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and found it still sweet. Will try reducing to 1/3 cup next time.

if you are going to put out a recipe edit it enough to make sure you are using all the ingredients.  It calls for a can of black beans which are still sitting open on someone's counter because you neglected to tell them to add them to the salad.   Actually this review is tongue in cheek to a certain extent.

Way too sweet.  Pretty oily too.

My mom used to make this salad in the 60's and I've always loved it.  I always add cayenne pepper to taste - if you like a little heat. It really adds another dimension.

Very good receipe. I also changed it up and used:
1/2 cup sugar,  red wine vinegar, 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I put all the sauce ingredients into a sauce pan and brought it to a rolling boil, removed it from the head, allowed it to cool, then added it to the bean mixture. No problems with desolvin

I literally just made this (with changes) an hour ago and I've tested it out on three kids, all of whom gave it a big thumbs up! I made changes to adhere to the blood type diet I'm trying out so I used cannellini and black beans, and black eyed peas. I used two cans of green beans. I didn't use any chopped veggies to make it more kid-appealing. I used lemon juice in place of vinegar, and 1/3 cup honey in place of sugar. I used EVOO for the oil.I omitted the cayenne and since the beans were unsalted I added some shakes of herbamare. If it's this tasty after only an hour I can't imagine it tomorrow! It's a simple but delicious flavor and I'm pleased that my kids approve. I plan to add diced avocado to it tomorrow and have it for lunch. Will make a great low-carb lunch for several days.

Add sliced pickled beets!!!!

This salad was made as a last minute things to take to a lunch.  We had all the ingredients besides  the green pepper so that was not used.  We did add some sliced pickled beets that added a nice bit of sweetness here and there in the salad.  Way less sugar was used though.  About 1/4 cup.

Delicious recipe! Followed the 1-1-1 ratio of sugar/vinegar/oil. Really easy to make and to customize. The second time I made, I cooked the beans for a few minutes only to soften the starches, before mixing in other ingredients and chilling.

Easy to make.  I'm always asked for the recipe or to bring it to dinner parties in the summer..  Agree with others though too sweet. Only use 1/2 c sugar.   I use balsamic vinegar makes a huge taste difference.  Friends have used the white vinegar  because the  balsamic is brownish in color in the dressing but they have all gone back to the balsamic  because of the taste difference.  In addition I use red bell pepper i like the taste & the red color is great in the salad.  Finally I put in about a 1/4 c of frozen corn thawed adds color too & crunch.  Definitely make it a day or two ahead of time the more it marinates the better.

I make it all the time....add 1 tablespoon dijon mustard to pump up the flavour. Use no salt beans to reduce the sodium content of this salad and use 1/2 cup sugar or less ....the taste is still great.

Really good!  Couldn't find wax beans, so doubled the green beans.  Also added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper, 2 Tbs. of fresh lemon juice and 2 chopped green onion.  Cut back sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 smashed garlic clove to the mix (wanted some flavor but not to overwhelm).  I usually would add 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro but didn't have any on hand this time.  Easy to make; wonderful flavor.  I like to keep a bowl in the fridge for a quick, healthy and filling snack.  6/6/16:  Made again and added a can of black eyed peas.  Maybe next time might try red wine vinegar and possibly cut back sugar to 2-4 Tbs.  Some chopped cucumber would be good too.  7/19/16  Reduced sugar to 2 Tbs. and still very good.

This bean salad is a lot like the one my grandmother made.  It is great.  I made it for Thanksgiving. My family loved it and my mom kept the leftovers. Will used red, orange or yellow bell peppers for more color.  I also used low heat to melt the 1/2  cup of sugar in the vinegar.  The less amount of sugar kept it from being too sweet.

Everyone wants this recipe when I serve this dish or take it to a dinner.  I make this recipe about 4 times a year and keep a lower calorie version (sub Splenda instead of sugar) in my fridge.  I add a little extra pepper and delete celery.

It's delicious. Following many other comments, I fully rinsed the beans and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup.

I have been looking for a good bean salad recipe awhile. This one is delightful! I omitted the onion as no one here likes it and added jalapeño peppers finally diced for my husband's need for heat. Thank for for sharing!

I have made this salad many times and it is just fantastic.  I will make it on the weekend and munch on it all week.  Some times I leave the green pepper out since my wife "doesn't like green pepper" (unless she doesn't know she is eating it).  One little note, this recipe exactly fills a 64 oz (1.6 L) deep dish plastic storage container as though it was custom made for it.

Made this last night, also used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar, didn't add any onion as daughter hates onions, but did add chopped hearts of palm plus all other veggies and beans. It was great!

WAY too sweet!! Not necessary to add this much sugar at all. The ingredients should speak for themselves without added sugar ... especially to this extent.

Love this.  It's a staple in my recipe box and it's rare to not have some of this waiting in the fridge.
(update)  This still is a fantastic recipe after a number of years.  You can change the beans that you use and it's still a hit whenever you make it.

The dressing is yummy! I substituted apple cider vinegar for white vinegar and added a teaspoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of grainy Dijon mustarde. I also added a half cup of black beans to the recipe .  mmmmmmmmmm .

This was pretty good but waaaay too oily for us. I would cut the oil by at least 50% next time. Used splenda, which was fine, and didn't have kidney beans so used great northern already had.

I don't put in the whole amount of sugar like many other reviewers suggested, it is not needed.  This is a fantastic salad anytime of the year and pretty in color to compliment most anything you serve it with.
