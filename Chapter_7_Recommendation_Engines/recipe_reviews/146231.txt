Di, this was simply to die for (no pun intended!)I had to use a bit of powdered cloves due to what I had on hand, and I wanted to serve it OVER the buttered egg noodles. There really wasn't quite enough sauce for that. I added 1/2 cup beef broth, and a pckg. of crimimi mushrooms to the pot.
Actually, the meat took more like 2 hours or so to cook... but it was well worth the wait.
Very tender, fall apart and delish over the egg noodles!
Great flavor, but next time I'll make sure to have enough chicken broth in the house!
In any event.... it's a definite addition to the "do again" file.
Thanks!

Not good at all. Sauce was boring and not the least bit flavorful. Might be a good starter recipe, but needs a lot of work. If you have an advanced palate, I would not recommend this dish.

***Personal attacks against my reviews are not welcome. I can not help if your dish was inedible. Stalking my page and saying that I gave a false review is incorrect. I tried a dish that I thought sounded wonderful, and given your "expert" rating, I had high expectations. Unfortunately,those expectations were not met. It looks like I wasn't the only one who was disappointed in this dish.***

Well Miss Diane, let me tell you that this was a hit with Drew and Ashley! I did add a few of my own herbs and spices but didn't have any cloves in the house. Nonetheless, both said the meat was so tender and full of flavor. Served this over wide egg noodles. Thanks hon!

I marinated this the night before with olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning, garlic powder, salt and cracked black pepper.  I used only one clove. OMG, this turned out so moist and tender.  Thanks for the post.

I substituted flat iron steak for the flank steak and I added whole garlic cloves to cook with the juices in the pan, but o/w followed the recipe to a 't.'    Fabulous!  Tender.  Moist.  Every bite is flavorful!  Bravo to your mother, Dianemwj!!!!

This is my new favorite recipe for flank steak!  The meat was falling apart it was so tender.  The flavors were wonderful together.  I made this as written except I used a little more garlic than called for.  Thanks, Diane, this is a keeper!

This was sooo good. I thickened the sauce at the end with a little cornstarch, but that's the only change.  The flank steak came out tender and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

A very easy recipe to follow, you can get other things done while it's cooking. My husband was quite surprised on how tender it came out. Got a great big hug and a kiss for this one.

I changed the recipe a little bit since I had about a 2lb piece of flank steak.  I used the same amount of flour and garlic powder that were suggested for the beef coating, it actually seemed to be a little too much and had plenty of flour leftover to toss.   I also sped up the cooking time a bit to about one hour, since I usually don't like to spend more time than that on dinner.  I browned both sides of the meat like it said and poured one can of chicken broth, 3 tsp of lemon juice, 2 tsp of minced garlic, sea salt and lots of pepper.  I brought the juice to a boil on medium/high heat and covered the pan. I left the meat and steam cook on medium heat for about half hr on one side and then turned meat over for another half hr since broth did not engulf entire meat.  After meat cooked, I took it out onto a cutting board to cut into thin slices.  I added cornstarch to the juices to thicken and then I added the sliced meat back into the juice/gravy.  I boiled a few potatoes and propped open some canned peas as sides.  I personally mashed my potatoes with a fork while they were still hot and added the gravy all over them and the meat...it was delicious!

Anyone who did not give this at least 4 stars cannot have made it right. This recipe is amazing. Substituted the cloves with nutmeg and I added a lot more black pepper since I like the spicier flavor. Very good recipe. Also when frying the steak I only left in on for about 30 seconds per side, the recipe asks for 3 mins but there is no need to cook it that much when you are going to braise it for 1 1/2 hours anyway. Just give it some color and keep moving, Made this with chuck steak which is way cheaper and it gave a flavor to the chuck steak that was amazing.

This was excellent.  I followed the directions as listed, but tripled the recipe for my large fam.  My only addition was a little cornstarch to thicken up the gravy a bit.  Very good & going in our favs.

The spousal unit (a.k.a., Lefty) came home with 2 1/2 pounds of flap meat the other day and I had no clue what to do with it.  But this was great.  I only had beef broth in the house and it worked just fine.  I thickened the sauce a little for texture and served with rice and corn.  Darn good.

The meat turned out very tender and flavorful.  My picky husband loved it.  I've also substituted white wine and beef broth when I didn't have chicken broth.  The white wine came out well, but the beef broth did not.

My whole family loved this, even the kids.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but also using some unflavored meat tenderizer on the steaks and added sliced mushrooms to the pan (I had blade steaks).  The steaks simmered for two hours, then I thickened the liquid with cornstarch, stirred in a bit of sour cream.  Served it all over rice, and was very happy with how tender the meat was.  No knives needed, it just fell apart and tasted very good.  Next time I will try egg noodles instead of rice.  Thanks!

Don't be afraid to try this recipe!  I trippled it for a pot luck of 25.  People were eating 2nd and 3rd helpings till it was gone!  Only thing different was cooking in oven, at 300 degrees for 3-1/4 hours, checking periodically the closer it got to 3 hours.

I thought this was delicious. I loved the combination of flavors. I thought the cloves sounded odd but, since I really like cloves, I went ahead and added them. So, I made it exacty as written. Thanks alot!

Delicious and sooooo easy! I used an electric pan by Americraft that cut the simmering time in half. I did add lots of finely chopped garlic and slivered yellow onions. My boyfriend loved it!!!! Thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this recipe! It was very good. Oh, I added a bit more garlic, used vegetable broth, and had no cloves.   Honestly, I don't even know what a clove is. Haha.

This was my first attempt at flank steak.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I substituted about 1/3 cup white wine.  I actually braised for closer to 2 hours; it was so tender!  I served with pasta and steamed broccoli.  My husband sopped up the extra sauce with bread.  Definitely on the MAKE AGAIN list.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

Amazing!  10 minutes of sauteeing, then an hour and a half of hands-free cooking.  Who could ask for anything more?  I bloomed the garlic and the cloves during the last 1/2 minute of frying the meat.  Then I deglazed with the stock.  Sauce needed more salt/pepper, and I added 1/2 teaspoon powdered gelatin to the stockstock just before serving, as the flour on the meat didn't add enough viscosity (for my taste).  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This was excellent. I did use an extra clove of garlic and simmered it a little longer about 2 hours. The meat was so tender and it smelt so good whilst cooking. My husband said 5 stars after 2 mouthfuls. I'll definitely be making this often. Thankyou Diane.

We didn't care for this recipe.  Sauce was "ok".  Won't EVER do that to flank steak again.  Perhaps flank steak was different back then.  Hubby usually comments on new recipes.  This time he just rolled his eyes--meaning--"not again"

Based on the reviews I decided to try this recipe never having made flank steak before. I followed it exactly, and unfortunately both my husband and I were disappointed. It wasn't as flavorful as the reviews exclaimed, however some added various ingridients to give it more umph. Simply put, I most likely won't be making this again. Normally, every recipe I've used from this site with a 4+ star rating has been excellent, so I speak from experience. :) I also have to add that we both enjoy "an explosion of flavor" to quote Ratatouille, and this dish did not provide that experience.

yummy. thanks. very flavoursome. We try and cook with really low salt. So I dont add any salt and I half the concentration of chicken stock made from oxo cubes. Still taste great and texture awesome for inexpensivep meat. Great recipe

Fantabulous! I've made this twice, the 2nd time with a flat iron steak since the flank steaks didn't look so good at the store. Both turned out wonderful. I did thicken the sauce the 2nd time around to make it more "gravy-like", otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. Even "Mr. Picky" likes this one and that is a MAJOR compliment! Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe!

I have to agree with the previous commenter. Mine always seemed to come out too tough to enjoy. I think I will stick to the more tender types of meat.

Absolutely delicious!  So simple to prepare.  I used "Flap Steak", basically the same as flank.  The longer you cook, the better.  I kept in on low for 2 1/2 hours. For 3 lbs beef, I used two 14oz cans chicken broth, and two heaping tbls of minced garlic.  I also added bably mushrooms for last 20 minutes, and served with a good quality egg noodle (DeCecco). My guests raved about this simple dish.

This was so simple and easy, it turned out great, all the family loved it. I did add a twist of my own for more flavor,I used more chicken broth, more lemon juice and Lots more garlic. I also minced onions and sauted them in the oil with the garlic while I was browning the meat. I also added about 3 tablespoons of ketchup to the sause. This was great thanks for the recipe.

A great use for Ranch Steak. It had a good hearty taste and couldn't have been easier to make. Nothing fancy, just a good down home "Meat and Potatoes" meal.

I followed the recipe exactly, right down to the whole cloves (though my eyebrow did raise a bit).  I was late starting dinner, had to defrost the flank steak in the microwave, worried that there was NO WAY this would be tender.  IT WAS FABULOUS!  Hubby, (an ex-chef) said "oh, potroast.." but then continued to make "mmm" noises while eating.  Told me to hang on to "the marinade recipe". LOL.  I never admitted how easy this recipe was.  GREAT job Diane!  A keeper.

I have to say that this was delicious.  I was skeptical at first because the ingredients seemed too simple, but they blended very well together and the meat was very tender.  Thanks.

I was looking for a steak braise that didn't use tomatoes, like my mother made when I was a child.  Except for using "petite sirloin" instead of the flank steak, I didn't change anything.  This was exactly the type of Sunday comfort-food I wanted.  Just brown it and let it simmer.  I also thickened the braising liquid and made gravy (with mashed potatoes).

I made this today, and was actually really good. My son said to save the recipe and he wants it again soon. The meat was so tender, and the flavors were tasty. The best part of it was that it was a very easy recipe. It's a keeper!

As an alternative to braising....try marinating for a few hours and grilling.  So so tender and full of flavor.  I bought the pack of flap steaks from Costco.  line them up in a baking dish to season and marinate.  Use black magic seasoning salt, onion powder, garlic powder and olive oil.  Turn over with tongs and do the same.  Season generously.  i let them marinate for 4 hours.....then grill to med or med rare.  Totally surprised at how tender and deish they are!!! Seve with corn on the cob, arugula, cranberry and brie salad and twice baked.  stuffed!

I really liked how this turned out, but hubby was not as pleased.  He looked at me and asked why I made flank steak the way I make my roast....so he wasn't so thrilled about the idea.  If I hadn't told him that it was flank steak, he probably wouldn't have known it.  I thought it was great.  Thanks for the post.

My husband loved it. It was flavorful and I added onions which gave it more flavor.
