This was very good and a nice change from the ordinary! The cake has lots of flavor and is very moist!  I didn't use the Grand Marnier and it turn out just fine - next time I will make a glaze from OJ and powdered sugar, instead of just the granulated sugar and OJ that the recipe calls for. This recipe will be 5-Star with a glaze!! I will make this again - it disappeared in 2 days!!!

Very light and tasty. I will add orange extract next time for a more intense flavour.
