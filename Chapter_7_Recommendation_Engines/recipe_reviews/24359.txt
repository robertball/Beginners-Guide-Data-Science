Broccoli isn't one of the vegeatable my family eats, but this was a big hit, my family really enjoyed this casserole.I did alter the recipe a little. I used a can of cheddar cheese soup  instead of the jar processes cheese and added about 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese amd 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and Increased the milk to 1-1/2 cups plus 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. It's the best!

This turned out very good.  I used a can of cheddar chesse soup instead of the jar of processed cheese, and I also used regular rice, instead of the instant.  I will make this again, my husband loved it.

The flavor of this rice is really good, but I followed the directions exactly and mine came out crunchy!  Does this need to be covered?  ANyway, I think next time I will just cook the rice first and then mix it all and bake for about 30 minutes. :)

Used this recipe as a base with a few changes.  Used regular rice which I cooked first, had frozen broccoli/cauliflower combination so used that, a little less milk and topped with crispy fried onions. Baked with lid on until last 10 minutes. Turned our great!

My mom used to make something really similar to this, and I missed it so much! I came to allrecipes and tried this out. The similarity is amazing! Thank you for a great recipe and the trip down Memory Lane!

I found this recipe several years ago when I was looking for an easy & cheap recipe for a dish to pass, for my son's Scout picnics etc (no I do not expect my wife to do this chore, she already feeds us wonderful healthy meals). I'm a guy now in my late 40s and this rocks! Mix everything up in a baking dish and throw it in the oven, and costs about $7 for everything AND it always gets all eaten up. I used to do complex recipes but the heck with that, for six or seven years now I have exclusively used this, and my wife & son ask for it at home too. I've had people ask me about it then tell me later there are many variations they found online, but I have always stuck to this one.

This was easy to make and stick in the oven. It isn't a recipe that everyone will rave about, but it is one that you will enjoy at an everyday family dinner. I didn't have any cheese sauce, so I just put some velveeta and a little milk in the microwave and melted.  Then added it to the mixture and it came out great.  Definitely beats the boxed stuff and worth the very little extra effort.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I have finally found the perfect "bring a dish to pass" recipe. I can't believe how easy and fast it is to make, and it always gets scarfed up. I don't take anything else anymore to Scout or work picnics... this recipe is awesome! (my wife hates to make dishes to pass for various functions I go to, so take it from a husband/father- this dish is GREAT)

This is much simpler than the one I've always done and just as delicious.  The simpler, the better.  A keeper.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I had something in mind and came to search for something similar.  this was exactly what i wanted... quick, easy, and tasty!  I took it to a Thanksgiving get-together and it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe and it was scarfed down by the guests!

Well I really enjoyed this and so did my boyfriend..I was looking for something to go with the Veal Chops I was grilling and this came out perfect! Since my boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms I subsituted the cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken and herbs.. I used brown rice instead of white rice and I also added fried onion pieces on top for the last 10 mins. It came out great and I will definately be making this again..

To Jeanette, the recipe says "instant" rice. That's why it came out crunchy. Anyway, I used real rice too, but I pre-cooked it and it turned out delicious! I also used a bottle of Ragu Mozarella and Parmesan sauce.

When I went to look for this recipe online (my recipes are still packed up after moving) I was having a hard time finding the one that didn't require me to cook the rice first.  I was so happy to find this one.  The only change I made was to used cream of mushroom soup.  My family has made it with this or cream of chicken for years and always enjoyed it.

Was not impressed with this one...too much cheese.  If I make it again, I'll use half the cheese sauce.

Good but probably won't make again.
