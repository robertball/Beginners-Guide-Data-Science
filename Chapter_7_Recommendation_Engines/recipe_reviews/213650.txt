This was an exellent meal we all went back for seconds.  I followed the directions with the change of chicken broth instead of the beef and using diced tomatoes instead of sundried.  when you add the pasta it absorbs all the exess broth.  my husband doesnt even like artichokes and said he dident mind them because it went well together. I added the parmasan over the pan of food with the butter and it came together well. This will definetly be a meal I make again.

This was pretty tasty but, I didn't like the shredded chicken -- next time I think I will use grilled chicken breasts and cut them into bite size slices; shredded chicken just got "lost" in the dish with all the other ingredients.  Iwill also use more garlic salt next time.

I thought this was very tasty.  I added a half cup of white wine based on the review that it was missing something and needed more broth.  This worked well.  I would also use a couple oz less penne next time and think it would be delicious with mushrooms.

This was just okay for me.  I love all of the ingredients and the medly of flavors but it really did seem to lack 'something'.  There really wasn't any broth/sauce to coat the pasta in once all of the veggies were cooked and it was kind of bland.  If I do this one again I think I will use angel hair pasta and make an alfredo sauce and top it with the vegetables.

We made this for a "girls night" and realized that we didn't have any chicken!  It was great without it and agree, if made with vegetable broth, it would be a wonderful meatless option!

Turned out GREAT! So good, we went back for seconds. Will make again!I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so I used a small Roma, diced. Also, went with chicken broth rather than beef. Very simple recipe, easy to follow.

This was relatively easy and quick to pull together.  We like all the ingredients individually and they do blend well with each other.  It was an acceptable meal for us but we prefer more flavor.  Perhaps marinated artichokes would be better along with a good wine in place of part of the broth.  Good for a week night, but I'd chose other things to serve to guests.

Easy dish for all occasions, simple to double! I grilled chicken breasts and added it last after cutting into small pieces. A dash of pesto and 1/3 cup of white wine makes this dish gourmet plus.

This was good, I dont think I will mix the pasta with the food though my pasta was starting to get too soft (unless I dont cook the pasta all the way next time and let it marinate/cook in the pasta). Overall my husband liked this recipe it came out like a soup.

Served this last night and it was o.k. It is a good basic low fat noodle and chicken recipe.  However, It really lacked something.

I made this and it was delicious!  Used chicken broth instead of beef.  I had my doubts thinking it would be dry but this was great and came together fast!  I added some red pepper flakes and some garlic powder as I always add more spices to what ever I cook!

Good basic recipe, but needs more flavor.  I added about 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 of a lemon squeezed, but still lacked something.  I think adding pancetta while cooking and feta when serving would be nice.  I'll try that next time I make it.

I thought this was great!  Like many others, I used chicken broth, and I added capers. I just threw some in after reading that it "was missing something."  My "go-to" for that is often adding artichokes and capers.  Nice recipe.

This is one of those "it's rated high because everyone makes their own changes and rates it based on that", recipes. AS-IS... it gets a generous 2 stars.

I read a lot of reviews saying this recipe is quite bland. With a few little changes, I thought it was the exact opposite! This is a very simple recipe that you can have fun with creating what you want. I didn't have artichoke on hand, so I did not use it. I used blackened seasoning on the chicken when I cooked it, therefore eliminating the seasoning the recipe says. I also diced the chicken instead of shredding it so it did not get lost in the pasta. I used 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup white wine I had on hand. I also added about 1 tbsp pesto and 2 tbsp onion and chive cream cheese to give the sauce some thickness. With these simple changes, this recipe was excellent and the hubby agreed by finishing it so fast that he was demanding seconds!

I omitted the butter and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sun dried. I drained the tomatoes but would leave the liquid next time because, as others mentioned, this dish is missing something--a sauce, and butter wouldn't be enough. I added a few tablespoons of pesto and we ended up adding more to taste our individual portions. Good overall

Extremely tasty!  I don't think the butter is necessary, making this a healthy and yummy meal.  Very easy to put together.  I used a package of chicken thighs that I cut up and cooked, it worked just fine!

I have made this two or three times now.  Quick, easy and delicious.  I make it in my cassoulet.  I used chicken broth instead of beef and I added more cheese at the end.  My husband thinks there is never enough cheese!  Great recipe.

It seemed like it would have all the ingredients for a tasty dish, but lacked a little extra something-spice. We cut up chicken the night before (when we had too much for another receipe). We seasoned it with basil, garlic pepper and onion powder. We then vacuum sealed it overnight. We followed the rest of the recipe except the cooking times- I didn't want my asparagus overcooked and mushy, so I didn't cook it as long. To add some additional flavor we also added some feta cheese.

Easy and very good...was a hit at my house. Didn't have canned artichokes so omitted them.Would have been a nice added touch..Didn;t want to open a carton of broth for 3/4 cup,,,Used a little dry onion soup mix in boiling water...would make again.

I had a craving for a recipe with sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, chicken and penne pasta.  I found this GREAT recipe!!  I loved the blending of flavors and the aroma in my kitchen while it was being prepared.  This will definitely be put into my family favorites.  Oh did I mention that I LOVE to cook?

Unfortunately underwhelming. Not horrible, but not something I would make again.

I made this for the first time tonight and my husband and I agree with most of the reviews...it needs more sauce and is lacking in depth of flavor. I will definitely make it again, but next time I will use more chicken broth and butter, add white wine, and use less pasta. I used 2 breasts of chicken that I cut into bite size chunks, added green peas for sweetness and used zucchini instead of asparagus (that’s what I had in the fridge). I liked using quartered artichokes in water vs the ones marinated in oil, as I think they’re too sour. The recipe says not to use sun dried tomatoes in oil but that’s all I had so I just rinsed them and soaked them in hot water, and they were great! Definitely going to give this a second try!!

Delicious!  I followed this recipe to a "T" except I cut it in half since there are only 2 of us; and there was plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.  When looking at the ingredients I wasn't so sure I wanted to use beef broth but I did and it was great.  Everything tasted so fresh!  I used fresh-grated parmesan cheese and we added more at the table.

Huge hit amongst many palates.  My dad is a basic salt & pepper guy...this was tasty for him just with the parmesan.  My daughter is learning to eat spicy...a few red pepper flakes and she was happy.  My mom & I love spicy so the red pepper to taste is perfect!  Way to please everyone and definitely a do over!  We prefer crunchy veggies so I cooked the stems as directed and added the spears at the end so they didnt get mushy.  Next time I will add a squeeze of lemon juice!

I made everything exactly as instructed except for the sun-dried tomatoes. When I went to the grocery store those were very expensive, so I bought a large jar at Costco for a fraction of the price, and just drained them for a few hours before adding to the recipe. Delicious!!

I was surprised at how good this meal turned out to be, I did change a couple things, instead of shredded chicken I used sliced chicken and I didn't use the sundried tomatoes. All of the flavors compliment each other, I will definitely make it again.

I substituted a pound of angel hair pasta, but probably should have done half of that to keep the other ratios right.   I followed the directions for the timing and the vegetables came out perfectly crisp!  I also used cubed chicken and not shredded.

Made this exactly as the recipe said, and it was really delicious!  So flavorful and healthy.  Next time I make it, it will be much easier (there are a lot of steps involved, but I won't have to refer to the recipe every 5 seconds).  I agree, it could use more garlic salt.

This was incredible!! As with most recipes, I made a few adjustments... Used a fresh tomato instead of the sun dried tomatoes, also used about half cup of white wine instead of the broth, and I cooked the chicken until it had a little crisp to it (so it didn't get soggy eith the pasta and sauce). The kiddo & hubs gobbled it up & asked that i make this dish again... Definitely will!! Thank you to the submitter :-)

I liked this dish but I think a sauce would make it better. It was pretty dry. I'll add Alfredo sauce I think. I added roasted pine nuts which were yummy.

Overall, I liked this recipe.  It was quick and easy to make which is always a plus for me.  I didn't have asparagus on hand, so I had to skip out on it.  I'm sure it would've been even tastier if I'd had it.  I used veggie penne since my kids prefer it --and it was a nice touch of color.  I also used chicken broth instead of beef broth.  I will be using this recipe again, just using all of the original ingredients listed.

Delish! Quick and easy! I used a roasted chicken from the store and it turned out great. Hardest part was trying to get everything to fit in one pan in the end. Looking forward to leftovers ??

I wanted to read the other reviews before rating this recipe. I noticed that almost everyone added their own little change. I made this exactly as the recipe was written. It was very dry and had little flavor. I like all of the ingredients, but this didn't work for me.

We grilled the chicken and I bought the tenders so when we cut them in strips they were thin and very flavorful. Seasoning with salt garlic powder and "just a pinch: original chicken" seasoning. In the end I didn't add the artichoke hearts. Oh and the sundries tomatoes were basil flavored because that's what the store had

Very good, but I used  a can of diced tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes. Also used white wine instead  of broth. Very nice flavor!
