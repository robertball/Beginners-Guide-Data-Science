Excellent the way it was written, but I added broccoli flowerets, artichoke hearts,  red pepper flakes and a whisper of black pepper.

Delicious noodles melt in your mouth and the shrimp were juicy, firm, saucy just how I love my pasta.

This dish as delicious and uses ingredients that I had on hand.  I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes, but it was still excellent!

Excellent dish. I made with zoodles instead of pasta to lower the carbs. Delish

This was really good and easy to make! I made as written except I made my broth with bouillon cubes rather than using canned. The only thing I would change for next time is to use less lemon juice as it was a little too much for us.
