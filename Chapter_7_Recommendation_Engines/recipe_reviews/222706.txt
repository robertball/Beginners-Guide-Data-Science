This is probably just a personal preference but I didn't really care for this...I don't like to give bad reviews because everyone has different taste.  I was afraid this might have a processed taste and it did.  I'm not a food snob and I have nothing against using can cream of mushroom, etc. soups.  But it has been my experience that unless really diluted with other things it can give a processed food taste.  But I was craving white rice and gravy and thought I'd give it a try.  It wasn't at all horrible but it's not something I'd make again.  However, it gets 3 stars for being easy and convenient.  I think substituting one of the cream soups most likely the celery and upping the broth (Cook the rice separate). Removing the chicken when done and thickening the gravy with a butter and flour roux would greatly help with the processed flavor .   But to each his own.

This was very tasty.  I like my chicken turned in the middle of baking because it looks so much more appealing.  That was the only change I made to the recipe.

This was real easy but needs something eles to it and maybe only half the dried onion soup mix and that could even be mixed with the rest of the soup and broth.  Didn't make a whole lot of sense on the bottom.  I suggest that you just keep looking at other recipies before making this one.

This is my recipe and I just noticed that it's different than the one I submitted.  It should be 1 & 3/4 cups of rice.  If you only use 3/4 c. of rice it will turn out entirely too soupy and just gross.  And if you don't like processed foods, I suggest you find a different recipe.  Yes, it's processed but it's tasty and quick which is why I make it and published it.

Family chefs: Solve the single person / childless couple size by DOUBLING this easy and fast to make dish!! Use NON-STICK COOKING SPRAY on that glass baking dish, too; a light touch of it really helps out!! My family LOVED this dish...and I was getting creatively inspired!!  I went full-throttle rouge my 2nd time making this: Made several large baked potatoes--and shredded them ( skin and all!! ), covering the baking dish covered with "savory herb and garlic" flavored soup mix. I hickory smoked the chicken and subbed Cream of Cheddar over cream of celery--and added green beans to the sauce mix!!  30 min. in the oven--I tore off the aluminum top and baked on for 15 more minutes!! As the dish cooled down, I ground down some flavored croutons and lightly topped the thick sauce with it. Major hit with my family--and my toughest food critics!! TARAWVU, you are indeed a genius--thank you for this great dinner dish!!

This was super easy and flavorful!  Even my kids liked it.  I cut my chicken into cubes, before cooking it and it stayed very moist.  I also mixed all the can soup, broth, soup mix and rice together, then poured the mixture over the chicken and baked it, a little over an hour.  The only thing is, it was a little too salty.  I'm going to try low sodium chicken broth next time and maybe a low sodium cream of celery.  I don't want to cut too much salt; I don't want it to loose flavor!

I would have to agree with Auntie Face.  The taste of this dish was just fine but if you follow this recipe to the tee, the rice does not cook fully.  By the time you give the rice time to cook, the chicken is overdone.  I think I'll try this recipe again but I'll start by par-cooking the rice for about 10 minutes prior to assembling this dish.  Also, I think I'll mix all of the ingredients together before I put them into the 9x13.  Sorry for the poor review but my experience was poor.

I loved the taste and it was easy to put together....but cooked a full hour and the chicken was starting to get over done and the rice wasn't cooked all the way through.   Well definitely try again but will make some modifications.
