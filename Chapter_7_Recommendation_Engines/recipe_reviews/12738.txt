Being from Lafayette, LA, this recipe is pretty authentic for this area.  The only problem is if you add the shrimp (especially the small ones) this early in the recipe, they'll be over-cooked.  The way I make it is I add the bell pepper and celery when I add the onions...right when the roux is ready.  I also add minced garlic.  I cook the gravy down to where it's pretty thick, then add the shrimp in the last 10 minutes.  The shrimp will throw off water, making the gravy perfect once the shrimp are cooked, which only takes a few minutes.  Right before serving, I add chopped parsley and chopped green onions.  I also don't use black pepper, since it doesn't digest.  I use cayenne instead, and more than what's called for with the black pepper.  Of course, that's an individual preference, but I like mine with a little "sting."  A note to "sampnik" regarding the "bitter taste"...if it's bitter, you burned your roux.  Try again, and let the roux get the color of a dark peanut butter, and you won't have that bitter taste. :)

MERWIN, NOT A BAD RECIPE AT ALL.  THE 1ST TIME I MADE IT YOUR WAY AND ENJOYED IT.  THE 2ND TIME I MADE IT MY WAY WITH GARLIC AND FRESH RED PEPPERS IN IT!  I ENJOY A LITTLE MORE SPICE THAN YOU DO AND MY FAMILY LOVES IT.  I ALSO ADD MORE SHRIMP.

I thought this was really good, however 40 minutes is too long to cook the shrimp.

Very good.   I was surprised that I got it right.  Could use some zing... maybe some hot peppers.  We enjoyed it over rice.  I was surprised that the Shrimp turned out so tender.

very good recipe. 
made a dark roux which did take an hour of constant stirring over low heat. was my first roux and turned out excellent! i did add garlic and red pepper flakes as another suggested. 
i used chicken broth in place of the water for more flavor. boiled all for 30 minutes then added the shrimp and peppers the last 10 minutes. shrimp turned out perfect and not overcooked that way. did have to thicken with cornstartch/water mix at the end. served over white rice.  excellent meal which hubby loved as well. will make again. thanks for a great recipe!

Love it!  This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband has been requesting this regularly since I first made it.  Today will be twice in the last week that I've made it.  I prefer red bell peppers to the green and celery to us was better left out.  I added crushed red pepper for some spice and it is terrific! When making it with the children in mind, I leave much of the spice out. Garlic was also good added to this.  Thank you so much, Merwin for Audry's recipe.  (Perhaps I shouldn't thank you so much because of the time spent stirring the roux! jk)

I added some chopped shallots and minced garlic.  Also I boiled the shrimp heads and used this as a stock to add a little more flavor.  Overall this was a good recipe.

Excellent just the way it is.  My family loved it!!  The roux is what makes the flavors come together. I will be using this recipe during the upcoming holidays and making it for 25-30 people.  I can't wait! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

I don't know, maybe I'm just not used to LA style cooking...but I didn't think this was very good.  Not a lot of shrimp and a weird bitter taste.  I'll pass.

Let's see. First you make a roux. Then you add the trinity. Then shrimp and black pepper. This is single ingredient (shrimp) gumbo.  I would say you will like the shrimp better if you bring the whole thing to a boil then add the shrimp. Return to boil and cook just until shrimp are done - about 7 to 9 minutes.
Kill the heat and serve w file.
Adding Andouille sausage early on will make it real gumbo.

I added a little more seasonings to my batch because I'm feeding a family of five. I used more shrimp and added sausage. I used half a bag of season blend, and also added a hot sauce, but I did use this as a general idea of where to start.

Terrible recipe. Maybe saut√© the veggies in butter, then make the roux. And a spoon of Kitchen Boquet. Defiantly more shrimp.
