This was excellent! High end restaurant quality all the way. I only had grated parm but fresh would have been better. It was a little disappointing to sog up the beautiful crispy mushrooms but in the end the flavor was so good it didn't matter. I did a rough chop on the mushrooms to keep them in larger pieces. Next time I make this I might pull some of the mushrooms up and set them aside to use as garnish. This was so simple yet so elegant.

We got oyster mushrooms in our CSA box, not knowing what to do with them I found this recipe. I used Italian parsley and #13 linguine. Both hubby and I were impressed. Very delicate flavors. Will be making this again.

Delicious. I added a little garlic and truffle oil, and added chopped onion earlier because I didn't have green. But it would have been wonderful without any changes. Love oyster mushrooms!

Easy to prepare and tasty enough to serve to company! I used shiitake mushrooms and they seemed perfect for this dish. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  Found some oyster mushrooms on a hike and pulled this recipe out since I had all the ingredients in the fridge.  Simple recipe that was quick and fairly easy to follow.  I had some pancetta that also needed to get used up so fried that in the pan and set aside to drain before adding mushrooms back into same pan.  Followed the recipe as written after that save exchanged crumbled pancetta for the parm.  The pancetta added enough salt that I think adding parm would have pushed the salt ratio over the edge, but that’s just me.  Again, turned out great and will certainly put back into rotation if I come across any more wild mushrooms any time soon.  Would make for a warm and hearty fall or winter dish.  Can’t wait to make this again.

This was my first time using oyster mushrooms and this was the perfect recipe for it. Very simple but full of flavour.

Absolutely amazing recipe. I made it before, and now that oyster mushrooms are in season I am making it again tonight. I love the mushroom hunt in the woods, and we love the food! Definitely add some garlic, makes the dish just right.
