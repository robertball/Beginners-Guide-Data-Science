Very Tasty! You could have fooled me, they taste like they were made wit regular not"lite" Karo! You do have to cool them the whole 2 plus hours or they won't cut well! Yummy

This is an excellent recipe.  I couldn't remember if I posted a rating but love it som much I had to come back to make sure I did post positive rating remarks.  My husband had 3 pieces this morning for his breakfast.  The chocolate is a perfect addition!

Very good.  I used lite brown sugar in crust and base.  Next time I will use less chocolate chips.

These were really good and I was surprised that they weren't overly sweet, even after using the lite Karo syrup and adding the sugar.  I was super impatient and did not wait the 2 hours to let them cool.  I made the mistake of cutting into them only after about 45 minutes and while they were still yummy, they do need to cool completely.  Will definately make these again.

I made half of the recipe and baked in an 8X8 pan. Although I generously buttered the pan, my bars didn't come out easily so next time I would line the pan with foil or parchment paper leaving long sides to lift up the bars with. I've done that before with the maple pecan bars in this site and it works very well. I'm not so crazy about the chocolate pecan combination so I reduced the chocolate a bit (and used mini chips). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. DO wait 2 hours or more to cut and eat. The bars cut better and taste better after a while. I refrigerated them and the taste and consistency was even better the next day.

These were good.  Not sure where "lite" comes into play but a tasty dessert option!

These were really good, but I took away and replaced the healthy ingredients with the full fat variety.
