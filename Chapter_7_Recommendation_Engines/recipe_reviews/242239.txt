Excellent!  This was the delicious breakfast that I served to my family today!  I followed the recipe except added maybe a little more butter to the potatoes when I browned them and some sausage along with the bacon that I had on hand.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and got a very yummy dish!  I think next time I'll let the potatoes thaw a little more, but that was not a problem---just a little more time browning them.  We already have plans for making this again!  Thanks, Cindy!  You rock!

Did anybody else wonder where the celery in the photo comes into the recipe?  Or do people just submit random photos to accompany their recipe.

This one however for me and my family seemed a little bland. So I made it with crumbled Sausage, diced ham and the crumbled bacon. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions together with a half tsp of minced garlic and three jalapeno peppers that had been de-seeded and minced,  in butter. I used O'Brien Potatoes because they already have Green, Red and Yellow bell peppers and diced onions. I used both Pepper Jack Cheese and Sharp Cheddar  and I diced up about a quarter pound of fresh asparagus and I used Egg Whites with just two Yellows in them. I realize this completely changes Cindy's Recipe but for me it helped. When it was served I also had a bowl of fresh made Pico De Gallo (Salsa) for those who wanted more spice. I haven't tried it with Spanish Style Chorizo yet but it does sound promising , with Cilantro.

This is really very good. Many things that you can add to make it your own. One suggestion is, I put the bacon in the freezer for about ten minutes then I take it out and cut it in small strips starting at one end of the pound of bacon to the other end then I fry it. This way you don't have to break the bacon up after it is done. You can cut it to the size of chunks you want and it is ready to go for anything you need small pieces for. I always do this when I need chunk's of bacon for salads or really anything.

I substituted green bell pepper for mushrooms. If I make it again I'll add more flavour, dill maybe, & more green onion to the hash browns. The top layer with all the cheese & bacon was delish, but the bottom was somewhat bland.

I was out of potatoes and bacon.  So, I substituted sweet potatoes and Kielbasa sausage.  I added a small amount of red pepper flakes and a little bit of Jamaican jerk seasoning.  Very tasty and I would make it like this again since we like sweet potatoes better.

We really enjoyed this breakfast dish, I left out the mushrooms because I'm the only one who likes them.  It was perfect for dinner, all I needed with this dish was some hot biscuits. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will make this again.

I baked the hash browns in the same baking dish so did not use a frying pan.  I also added red onion, and spicy sausage. My family LOVED it.

No fancy stuff here, just everyday ingredients for a great breakfast or brunch casserole.  the first timeI made it exactly as written and it was soooo good...tasty, moist, perfectly seasoned.   Then I used ham in place of the bacon.  Also very good.  I even made an Italian version using pepperoni in place of bacon, replacing hash browns with zucchini, parmesan in stead of cheddar cheese adding garlic, sweet red peppers,  basil, oregano, marjoram and parsley.  Also very good.  I think you could use this as a basic recipe for endless variations for a really delicious casserole.

I cooked the bacon, some diced ham and mushrooms in a skillet, reserved, then browned the potatoes in the same skillet. Then I mixed that together, placed it in the pan, then poured the eggs over it and threw the cheese on top. Very easy. I used cubed potatoes instead of hash browns. This made enough for 4 people for 2 days and was an instant hit with everyone. I served it with iced cinnamon rolls. I will cut the recipe in half for just hubby and me. I will make this again and again. Yummy.

This recipe is wonderful. I'm a first-time reviewer, so this is a big deal for me. Be sure to add ALL the milk, even though it sounds like too much....it's not. It's adaptable for anything you want to add too! We have this for dinner along with a green salad. ????

Made this casserole for a small group of friends, We all thought it was quite bland. Luckily I had some salsa and hot sauce to add some flavor.  If I were to make this again, I would probably use some spicy sausage, more onions, peppers. and more cheese.

This is a great recipe.  I made it pretty quickly on mother's day and the family loved it.  I didn't bake the bacon and just fried.  I also replaced the mushrooms (my daughter doesn't like them) with cubed tomatoes.  This is  definite repeater.

I have to agree that this was pretty bland.  I used potatoes O'Brien which should've kicked it up a little and even added a little extra bit of chopped green pepper.  I contemplated taking salsa to go with the casserole but didn't and was sure wishing I would've.  Definitely would've helped the blandness.

Great recipe! The second time I made it, I used chicken chorizo hot sausage rather than bacon, and I used leftover hash brown casserole for the hash browns. Delicious!

I do this in a cast iron skillet. I picked it up from years of scouting. makes an easy breakfast for the troop and even when the scouts cook it, it comes out great. We saved gobbs of money on ketchup because it don't need it unless it happens to burn. In the oven or in a skillet over a campfire this is the ultimate crowd pleaser

I have to say that I did make changes.  I topped it with spinash and sliced grape tomatoes.  It was very dry,  and not fluffy.  
We ate it as it was breakfast.  No one wanted seconds, I had to throw out.  I will go back to the Farmers Casserole next time.

A great 'base' recipe for my modifications.  I cooked the bacon on a rack in the oven.  I used Baby Bella (Crimini) mushrooms, and  grated my favorite white cheddar cheese (Cabot brand).  I used 5 eggs, & the equivalent of 5 more eggs (Egg Beaters) for a healthier dish.  I used 'light' Evaporated Milk, which I like to use whenever a recipe calls for milk (it makes everything creamier).  I  used 'seasoned salt' instead of regular salt, and added in a generous amount of Baby Spinach, and 1/2 of a diced red bell pepper.  This turned out seriously good, and I'll definitely be making it again.

For some reason, this was watery and not very good.   I will try a different recipe next Christmas.

Made no changes.  Very good.  Will continue to make.  Elaine's review was for an entirely different recipe.  Makes me want to just make the recipe as written and skip the reviews!

Great casserole!!! My husband and father-in-law loved it! I used potatoes O'brien instead of regular potatoes. Next time I will try sausage and see how that taste's. Feeds a lot of people too so I'm thinking this will be a great Christmas morning dish.

This was a variation of the Wifesaver that I usually make. I sautéed the hash browns, sprinkled a bit of cheddar over them  and covered the dish in the fridge overnight.  Then I added the bacon, diced onion, red pepper and chives to the egg mixture , which were also prepped the day before. I left out the mushrooms and green onions. With the bacon, the egg mixture did not need any salt.  I baked it at 375 for 40 minutes and it was nicely browned.

This is a really good guide for a great breakfast casserole. I used  sweet sausage in place of the bacon. I added one diced pablano pepper, half of a diced vidalia onion, and one diced red pepper along with some sliced mushrooms. The prep time is way off as stated, but the results were worth it. I used 2 pans, one for browning the shredded potatoes and another to brown the sausage and pepper,onion mix. Make sure the potatoes are very well browned. This will prevent the bottom from becoming too mushy.  I only used 6 eggs, one cup of milk and no additional salt. This recipe is very adaptable. A little Sriracha hot sauce sprinkled on top to taste really makes  the flavors pop!
