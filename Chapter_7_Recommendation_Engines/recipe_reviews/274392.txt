The cook time was great and it was very simple to throw together last minute. I used our favorite fish mix and it seemed a little salty (whereas is isn't as noticeable when used on catfish) to me but the BF didn't notice as he downed one shrimp after another....so maybe I'll look for a lower sodium mix vs the usual stuff  for the shrimp. Thank you for helping with the air fryer recipes!
