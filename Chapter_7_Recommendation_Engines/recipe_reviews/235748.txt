These were a hit in this house, but we’re chocoholics.  I used twice as many chocolate chips as requested in the recipe and was generous when measuring the cocoa.  The exterior was crunchy while the middle was soft.  These didn’t spread on the cookie sheet so you can load the cookie sheet up.  My family loved them.

I made these yesterday for my family and for my husband to take to work for his department. They were a hit across the board. My kids loved them, my husband's sailors ate them super quickly, and I agree that they are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and only dipped the top in sugar as was suggested by one other reviewer. I will make this consistently in the future. Thanks for a delicious cookie!

This is my favorite "Go To Cookies" everyone requests me to bring these for family gatherings and work day potlucks. I had read a review on this cookie before I made them and haven't made them any other way. The review said to roll the cookie balls in sugar then bake them. Try it and you will never make them without that step again!!

These cookies are the absolute best! I changed nothing. They have the perfect amount of chocolate, and thanks to all those oats, a cookie or two ends up being pretty filling. Great with milk!

Great cookie--everybody loved them!  Really have to watch cooking time since you can't tell when they are brown.  For me I should have pulled them at 12 minutes as my fam is not a fan of crunchy cookies.  Can't wait to make them again!

I made this tonight. Yummy. I did dip the tops in turbinado sugar before baking.  I am not a chocolate chip cookie lover, but I thought these were very good.  My grown son gave them thumbs up.

These were good, but seemed to be too dry and crumbly, so the cookies didn't hold together.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I think it needs a bit more butter to make the batter less dry.

This recipe is perfect for experimenting! I added everything from almonds to Nutella to dried cranberries to Oreo filling to peanut butter. Just roll into a ball, flatten, place whatever you want inside and roll back up! Some of them I left plain but rolled in sugar or sprinkled with sea salt

I made these cookies exactly as written, but baked them for about two more minutes than called for.   They are a big hit with my husband and son.  This will be a go-to cookie recipe for me.

What a wonderfully chocolatey experience!!

I followed the recipe with the exception of two things,
1 I used oatmeal flour in place of all-purpose. Easy to make at home with a high speed blender - like 10 seconds and done! This change is simply because we've banned white flour from the house, so there was none to be had.
2 I added dried cherries. We had some on hand that needed to be used.
Other then those two changes, I kept to the recipe and the cookies came out perfectly yummy!

Will certainly make again.

Follow-up: My wife is generally not thrilled with sweets in the house and she "scolds" me when I bake (but of course she also enjoys them!). She saw the recipe I jotted down on a piece of paper and left on the kitchen counter. She brought it to me and I thought, uh-oh, she's gonna be upset. But instead, she set it on the table in front of me and said, "Please write down the name of these cookies so we know what this is. You must make them again. This is a keeper!"
She's not wrong! I kept a few out and stuck the rest in the freezer - great for a little evening snack.

This is an awesome cookie recipe, The only change I made was dipping only half the cookie in sugar before baking as others suggested. Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside! Yummy!

Great recipie. Was skeptical about the wet to dry ingredient amounts but came out great! I added 3/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Gave some nice depth to the flavor.

I made these using 1/2 cups less oats based on other reviews.  I baked them for 13 mins since my oven runs a little hot and they were awesome!  Will be saving this recipe for sure!!

This is perhaps the best cookie I have  ever made. I only added a half cup of pecans to the recipe, otherwise followed it exactly.  I did not roll or dip the cookie in sugar and for me it's perfection!  Make this cookie!  You will have no regrets.

I thought these were okay.   My family LOVES chocolate so we had high expectations.  I would have preferred regular oatmeal choc chip cookies to these.  They remind me of chocolate crinkle cookies which I should have made instead if I wanted the rich chocolate taste I was going after.  These are not bad cookies, just not what we expected.

Delicious! You must mix the dough thoroughly to get it all moist, and then it is very thick still. I had to mash the tops of the cookies down, and they didn't spread at all. Squeeze a ball of dough in your hand till round and firm, and the cookies will turn out great!

The dough was very stiff and they turned out dry. I used quick oats and baked them for 14 minutes. The flavour is good, the texture is so-so. If I choose to make them again I might add a banana to add moisture and bake them for a shorter time.

Worked out perfectly for me. Great recipe. I added some walnuts because I'm a sucker for oatmeal and walnuts in cookies. It's baking season so I will definitely make these again.

Delicious!  Just made them with a halved recipe with a little more chocolate chips, turned out to be a hit - should have made full batch. Made 24 cookies.

Hubby says he's not a chocolate person. Ha!  He ate the first batch almost entirely on his own, so have made a second batch.  So yummy!  Will be making these often and also for church bake sales and luncheon.

So delicious.  I may have eaten too much batter in anticipation of the cookie itself.  And the cookies were definitely worth the wait.  Made them as directed.  Used mini chocolate chips.  Used 2 cups slow cook oats and 1 cup quick to equal 2 cups oats.  Wonder what other people used and if it mattered. Next time, just wait to eat the cookie!

These cookies are very similar to brownies and were a big hit with my neighbors! I think I probably added more chocolate chips, but doesn't that go without saying?

These turned out better than I expected!  I did add 1/2 cup more chips just because I'm a chocoholic. Just make sure you stir it well because if you don't, it will be dry and they won't stick together well.

I baked them for work! Instead of using regular chocolate chip, I substitute for Toll House Dark and Mint chips! Adding a bit of Christmas taste to the cookies! Everyone that loves mint and chocolate, really enjoyed them!!!

I made these in the mountains of Afghanistan and followed the high altitude baking changes.  Added one extra tablespoon of flour and one extra egg.  We didn't have baking soda but these cookies still came out delicious.  Almost like mini brownies!!!!

I am probably one of the world's worst bakers, but these turned out great! I had to add an extra egg because where I live (Egypt) the largest eggs are what I'd normally think of as small to medium. No matter. These cookies are delicious and now I'm inspired to try baking something else!

I made these as a thank you gift for a friend. They are delicious. My husband said these are his new favorite cookie. I made them according to the recipe and using a cookie scoop was able to get 4 dozen. Next time I will use them to make ice cream sandwiches. Yummy!
