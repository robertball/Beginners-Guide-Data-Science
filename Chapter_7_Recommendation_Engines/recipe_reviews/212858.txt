Can't wait to try this recipe but I'm gonna substitute date paste for the apricot filling. Sounds very similar to a recipe my high school Home Ec. teacher used to make for Christmas. I lost my copy and have been searching for AGES! I'm so excited to find this!

This was not an easy recipe to make. I had calculator figure ingredients for 24 cookies. Had trouble figuring how many TBSP of butter equaled 2/3 cup. Finally settled on 12 TBSP. Measurement for cream cheese was a bit confusing. In original recipe of 18 cookies, ellenz used "1/2 (8 oz) pkg. Twenty-four cookies called for 2/3 (8 oz) pkg. I used 10 oz, which may have been more than called for. Had a lot of cream cheese and butter with 1-1/3 cups flour. Took a long time to work into pea size. Rolling dough was a good exercise workout, trust me. Was going to use 2-1/2 inch wide heart cutout but knew there would not be enough 1/8 inch thick dough so settled on 2 inch wide. Near impossible to put 1 tsp preserves on cookie so ended up using about 1/4 tsp. Dough was so small sealing cookie with fork almost destroyed heart-shapes. After brushing with beaten egg, I sprinkled 17 cookies with brown sugar/sugar mixture. Baked light brown after 13 minutes. Watching a video to make this recipe would be a deciding factor to try making these again. Without it, I will chalk this experience up as a challenge that didn't work. Sorry I couldn't rate this with a higher score.

I made these for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada Challenge #allweneedislove 
This dough or a variaiton of it is very common in European baking whether it be for Rugelachs or Kolaches, so I am familiar with how soft it is and how it cannot be manhandled or it will end up tough.
I scaled to 23 servings as I only had 5 oz butter.
I weigh my dry ingredients, after making the cookie dough it was so soft I had to add 8 tbsps of additional flour. I also added 2 tbsps sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
When I cut out the first tray of hearts I put them in the freezer with the dough scraps for about 10 minutes, then I rolled the second batch of hearts and placed them in the freezer while I was filling/crimping the first tray.
I cooked down my homemade apricot jam the night before to thicken it, so it would not be so runny.
I used my medium heart cutter which yielded 15 sandwiches that baked in 17 minutes on parchment lined sheets.
I thought I had some coarse sugar but was mistaken, so I just made a fast vanilla glaze to smear over the tops once cool.
The pastry was light and flaky, a favourite with my family!
