Quick and Easy!  I baked instead of grilling this dish and it turned out very good.  By baking the dish I was able to serve the chicken with plenty of extra warmed sauce for dipping or to go over rice

Overslept this AM so nothing out of the freezer this PM. Threw this sauce together in a zip-loc bag using dried onion flakes(amt about equal to soy sauce) and a goodly shot of minced garlic, tossed in a couple of frozen chicken breasts and let them marinate and defrost for about 2-3 hrs. Then cooked on the George Forman and served with brown rice. Really good flavor and nice tang with some sweetness. Definitely will make again and want to try marinating longer with just a bit of pre-planning.

Great recipe for BBQ chicken! I poked the chicken breasts with a fork and placed into a ziploc bag. For the marinade I used 1 tsp. of dried minced onion vs. regular onion and Heinz chili sauce vs. ketchup for a little extra kick. I also added some fresh minced garlic and 2 tsp. of smoked paprika to give it a little "smoky flavor". I mixed everything together and poured it over the chicken. I let it marinate overnight and grilled it over charcoal - excellent!

This was easy to make and used ingredients I already had on hand. My husband and kids loved it so I will definitely be making it again and again.

I liked this recipe for it's simplicity and use of on-hand ingredients.  I cut the breasts into strips and marinated for a few hours.  I poured the whole thing into a baking pan and put it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  I turned off the oven, poured the sauce into a pan and put the chicken back in the oven to stay warm.  I added 1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch to the sauce, brought it to a boil and added it back to the chicken.  This could be a one-dish deal if you baked the chicken in a cast-iron skillet and left the chicken in while adding the cornstarch.

Pros: This recipe has a lot of easy to find ingredients.  It calls for simple flavors that are sweet yet subtle.  The onions are a great addition.
Cons: Lacked enough flavor.  I would marinade it longer (maybe overnight?) so that the flavor could really soak in.  Very straightforward tasting, too.

I made this recipe on the george foreman and it worked pretty well.  I then took onions and caramelized them with some extra marinade and put some on top for presentation and to add a little more to the dish.

I followed the recipe, adding an extra tablespoon apiece of honey, ketchup, and brown sugar, and after marinating my 3 chicken breasts, I flung the breasts and marinade in my pyrex and tossed it in the oven at 325F for about 50 minutes, and then flipped the breasts and turned the temp down to 210 to keep it warm for another 45 minutes.  Everything caramelized, and it was tremendously delicious.  I don't even know how to cook, and I couldn't be happier with how things turned out!  Thank you!

Very sweet, light sauce.  My husband made it for me for dinner, and I loved it.  He left out the onions, but I didn't miss them a bit.  He said that he'll never buy BBQ sauce in the store again!

Very tasty recipe, but it took a lot longer than 30 minutes for the potatoes to cook.
I had to zap them in the microwave and return them to the oven so they'd be
ready with the rest of the meal.

We use recipe all the time for chicken on the grill. We always have the ingredients. It's tasty and colorful and SO easy. I add some herbs & spices to it sometimes (usually just some garlic). I'm really glad I found it! Thanks for sharing.

This was a very easy and tasty way to prepare chicken. I poked holes in the chicken before marinating it. I also let it marinate for about 4 hours. It was very tender from the grill!

Who would think that something so simple would turn out so amazing!  This chicken turned out delicious.  I made as is using four chicken breasts and adding a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I would not change a thing about this marinade, except maybe boil the marinade and use as a dipping sauce.  It is the perfect blend of sweet, tangy and salty.  This will definitely be a keeper in my house!

Nice marinade, quick and simple to mix up, plus I usually have all these ingredients on hand.  I used skin on chicken leg/thighs, marinated all day in a sealable food storage bag, turning frequently before grilling.  Only a couple of small changes - doubled the sauce for 5 pieces of chicken, added a liberal amount of minced garlic, and reserved some of the marinade for basting during the last 15 minutes or so of cooking.  Red pepper flakes might be nice if you like a bit of zing.  Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tammy!!

I thought this recipe is terrific.... easy to put together with ingredients on hand,  I marinated in morning and grilled later in evening, everyone loved it (even me, who's not a big BBQ sauce fan!).  See my picture of chicken in ziploc for marinating ideas.

I made 8 bone in chicken breasts, and so increased the servings appropriately. Followed the ingredients exactly, and marinated for about 24 hours, then baked it for about an hour at 175 deg C. This was way too sweet for my liking. I discarded the sauce, and diced up the chicken, and used it in recipes that called for cooked chicken. Very tasty in a chicken sandwich or a quickly thrown together pasta. Will decrease the sauce if I make again.

Talk about adaptable, WOW. I decided to prepare this as an early dinner on Sunday for myself. Just as I had the marinate together a friend called. She had just broken her foot and needed to get to the hospital.
I grabbed the slow cooker, threw everything in, set it on low and ran out the door. Hours later I ushered her in to a kitchen with an aroma to die for.
I added some flour (I put some cold water in my shaker, add a couple of tbsp of flour, shake well and it pours like milk - never any lumps) to make a creamy thick sauce and served it over rice with a side of corn.
It was delicious and definitely on my do again list. Thanks for a tasty ADAPTABLE dinner.

This was awesome!  I have a problem with chicken being too dry when cooked on the barbeque.  This was so moist and delicious.  I made it for some friends and they couldn't stop raving about it.  Thank you!

I have to admit that I omitted the onions.  I thought it was OK, not great.  Maybe I'll try it again with the onions next time.

Don't cook in a grill pan, because the bbq sauce slides off and remains in the grate and burns.

I baked the chicken at 350 for 50 minutes.  Really juicy and a great flavor.  I would love to find a way to thicken the sauce though.

this was a great recipe!  I cut my chicken up into strips for faster cooking, and I marinaded it for 1 1/2 hours I also reccomend to quadruple  the recipe and I left out 6 tpsp of honey and glad I I did because it would have been too sweet, when I marinaded it I used one cup of the entire mixture of sauce and put the rest in a glass container in the fridge until cook time.  After an hour and a half I put it in a caserole dish with lid on and cooked it for 1 hour (remember I cut them into strips left whole it would take much longer I think) when it was cooked, I added about 1/4 cup  to 1/3 cup of cornstarch/water mixture to thicken, I served this with chicken fried rice very tasty, the remaning chicken I pulled apart, and mixed with some of the sauce and served as pulled chicken sandwiches as the chicken was so very tender this was great!  hope everyone enjoys :)

I modified this recipe slightly.  First, I double the ingredients.  I did not have any onions, so I added onion powder and onion salt.  Also added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I used my crock pot and sliced the boneless breasts into thick pieces.  It had plenty of sauce to serve with the rice and green beans I made.  I just thought it was too sweet.  I will try it again and cut back on the brown sugar.

And I thought my simple BBQ recipe was good!  Wish I would have seen this at the beginning of the summer.  Glad I read the reviews and made extra sauce.  This was fabulous on chicken and I've got pork chops marinating right now to try later.  A wonderful, wonderful recipe.

My family loved this! It was really good! I didn't use the onion(hubby doesn't like them) or the salt and pepper. Soy adds enough sodium and I had forgotten to add the pepper. Baked in the oven at 350 for 30-40 minutes and it came out moist, juicey and delicious! I was eating the left over sauce in the dish with a spoon!

Wow.  This was amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect.  An hour later my husband is still talking about how good it was.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.  We'll be making this over and over! ADDITION:  I have made this several more times, and allowing it to marinate over night takes it up to 10 stars!!!

Well I was disapointed with this.  Didn't have  very much bbq flavor.  I did like the ease of the ingredients. I also doubled the marinade because I had 3 huge chicken breasts.   I marinated it all day in the fridge.  Also added some red pepper flakes to get a little kick.  I wanted to add fresh garlic but was out so I added some garlic powder.  I'll try this again using fresh garlic and maybe some garlic chili sauce or hot sauce  to add more heat to it.

Pretty good, but not something we're raving about.  Definately NOT a typical BBQ sauce taste.  I thought of it as more of a marinade.  I let mine marinate overnight and they turned out great; flavorful and tender.  Another plus was that the ingredients were all things I had on hand... always a good thing  :o)

This sauce truly blows store-bought BBQ sauce well out of any body of water. :)  I loved it.  I separate the sauce into two batches (and made a bit more), because I like to brush the sauce on the chicken when I'm just about to remove it from the grill.  With a simple recipe like this, I'll never be buying BBQ sauce from the store.  Thanks!

We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.  However, 30 minutes was not long enough to marinade.  I tried it again but froze the chicken in the marinade.  I put it in the fridge to thaw overnight and when we grilled the following night there were no leftovers!  The marinade really soaked into the meat this way.  May add some hot sauce or sub a small amt of salsa for the ketchup next time for some heat.

I was looking for a low fat chicken marinade
and this fit the bill. Very good flavor. I marinated 
for two hours. Next time I'll cook down the marinade
on the stovetop to serve as a sauce. Nice summer meal.

I'm embarrassed to admit it, but this is the first time I have cooked chicken on the grill. I left it on the grill a little too long so it was a little dry.  The sauce was tasty but a little bland.  I marinated it for an hour- next time I'll leave it in the marinade a bit longer. Not bad for a first time!

I followed the directions exactly. And grilled it, too.  I give it 4 stars because it was just a bit bland.  I think if this was marinated overnight it would be perfect.  The honey and soy make a delicious combination with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and moisture on the inside.  Yum!

This was just okay. I used worchestershire sauce instead of soy. Good starting point but as is, it just wasn't enough. Next time, I'll use this doubled with a rub.

Great recipe!! I reduced the honey to 3 tbs because I was scared it'd be too sweet and I added a tad bit of Worcestershire sauce & Louisiana hot sauce. I sprayed a large pang with some Pam and I added the chicken and marinade, flipped em over a few times and it came out delicious!!!!

Our family loved the wonderful flavor this marinade gave the chicken. I doubled the recipe in order to marinate 6 thick boneless skinless chicken breasts. I made some minor changes (based on single recipe): decreased the brown sugar by 1 tablespoon, increased soy sauce by a teaspoon, and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I liberally pierced the chicken to ensure the marinade would thoroughly flavor it, then threw it all into a ziplock bag, marinating in the fridge for 4 hours. We then discarded the marinade and  grilled the chicken over high heat for 15 min per side(these were thick breasts), and they turned out almost perfectly. Because of their thickness they burned on the edges, but were otherwise tender and juicy, with a smoky sweet almost-asian flavor. Next time I'll try adding ground ginger and orange juice to the marinade, and will marinate it overnight. Thanks for a  great recipe!

G R E A T!!!! I par boiled the chicken and marinated it for around 5 hours in baggie. used chicken legs and added extra honey and sugar and used onion powder, i think the real onions will make it better, wondering if they would burn on grill. very good though thanks!!

I LOVED this recipe!  I doubled the sauce but went light on the sugar & honey, using only 6 tbsp each for the doubled recipe.  I added 2 extra tbsp soy sauce & threw in 1 tbsp minced ginger & 1 garlic clove.  The ginger totally rocked this recipe!  Marinated for about 1.5 hours...I've never put boneless skinless breasts on the grill & was amazed with how moist they were!  I want to recalculate the calorie count though...the recipe is figured for 5 servings but only uses 2 chicken breasts.  It tasted so good I'm sure it's quite a bit higher in calories when figured for 1 breast per person.  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to use it again!

My husband liked this. I did not. I used 2 crushed cloves of garlic instead of the onion in the marinade. I let it marinate for about 1 hour and then grilled it in my grill pan. If you leave the chicken alone and don't move it while it is grilling, it will get gorgeous grill marks on its sides.

My whole family declared this their favorite chicken recipe. My son liked it so much he wanted it 2 nights in a row.  I left out the onions because they aren't a crowd pleaser in our house, and I didn't have quite enough honey, but it didn't matter at all.

This recipe was very good! Since some reviews said that it didn't really taste like BBQ chicken, I added about 2 tablespoons of my favorite BBQ sauce. It should have been marinated longer (I did mine for a hour in a ziploc bag). It had a great flavor. We will have this again.

I used a small onion, added 2 TBLS. of minced garlic and marinated the chicken for about an hour.  It was very good and probably would have been even better if I marinated it longer.

My family liked this dish.  I took the advice of freezing it overnight.  I then cut the chicken into two inch chunks and put them on skewers and grilled. They cooked a little faster.  You could compliment it with fresh vegetables likes mushrooms or peppers on a skewer too.  Kind of turns it into a shishkabob meal.

I loved this!  It was super easy to make.  I ended up marinating it for a little over an hour.  The left overs were great - my husband wants it again this weekend.  I bet the leftovers would be great on a salad for lunch the next day.  Thanks for sharing!

Okay, but that's about it.  It didn't taste like barbecue chicken to me.  Maybe if I weren't expecting that, I would have given it four stars, but just barely.  It was just okay, so I won't be making it again.

Very good! Chicken came out tender and did not need any BBQ sauce for dipping. I marinated for 1.5 hours.

Liked the flavor.  Easy to make. I marinated for several hours in a sealed plastic bag.  I also made several punctures in the chicked so that it could soak up more of the marinade.  Grill time was less than instructed and I like my chicken very well done.  Also, I only made 2 half/split breasts. Had I made 2 complete breast I would have needed more sause.  I will make again, but next time I will most likely add a little cayene pepper to give it a little more bite.

I cut the breasts into thinner strips and marinated for about 3 hours, then grilled.    
It was delicious.  Will definately do again.

The BBQ sauce is quite sweet.  My husband and young kids have huge sweet tooths so it was a hit.  I think a couple shakes of Tabasco will give it the kick I like from BBQ.

It was good.  I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it really wasn't.  Next time I will pierce the chicken first and maranate longer so the flavors really penetrate the chicken.  I really liked how the maranade created a crust on the outside of the chicken.  It gave it crunch but also kept the inside moist and tender.

I trippled the recipe and threw it all in the crock pot for 5 hours ( chicken was frozen ). It was very easy and tasted ok. My husband wasn't a fan, he said it wasn't sweet enough for him.

Simple to prepare and excellent!  I marinated my chicken legs and thighs for about 5 hours before grilling.  I also kept some marinade separate to use for basting during grilling but it wasn't needed. I paired it with the Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe and my family raved about both of them.

Yummm...My brother is a picky eater, but said this was the best chicken he has ever eaten.  I had sliced the chicken I used in half (thinner), so the cooking time was shorter--just keep an eye on it, as all grills are different.  I'll never buy BBQ sauce again!

I broil it. Don't want to walk outside every 5 or 10 minutes so. Other than that stick to chopping onion instead of a liquified onion. I made the mistake of putting the onion on my magic bullet to save time...not the same. It didn't caramilize the same, I tasted the onion alot (I hate onion if I can taste it), won't ever do that again! I'm to make this once a week forever according to my hubby, that's how good it is. I made it for his family and they thought it was so delicious, I was very happy since they're great cooks! I think it's better if left a bit longer (supervised), so it caramilizes a bit more, tastes even better I think!

This was great. I put the marinaded whole chicken pieces and then backed them one hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered. To cut the honey to 2 T. used 5 T. of ketchup and added two cloves of garlic. My husband and kids loved it.

Great, easy recipe.  My family really enjoyed the flavour and my kids begged to have the leftover chicken in their lunch sandwhiches today.  Thanks!

I marinaded my chicken for 3 hours, but I think I will let it marinate longer next time. The sauce is good and I will definately make extra next time.

This was good but much too sweet for my family's taste.
     Also, they didn't care for the onion.

Great flavor, even after marinating for only an hour. The honey is the key, makes the mixture stick to the chicken. One note though, 15 min on HIGH on a good grill is ridiculous, chicken cooks much faster than that. We almost burned it after 7-8 min per side. Adjust cooking time, otherwise don't change a thing!

Very good and easy! I didn't put onions cause we're not big on onions but I did add onion powder, garlic powder, and a tbsp of minced garlic to the marinade. We loved it!

This was great!  We will certainly be having this again! The only thing I would do is let it marinate longer.  I let marinate about 45 mins.
