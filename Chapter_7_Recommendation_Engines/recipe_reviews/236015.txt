My favorite chicken  recipe. They don't last wrong around the grandkids.  I use them for a healthier snack.

I made this exactly like the recipe stated. I'll make this again. It was very good. I served this with rice and a green salad. Great dinner idea.

Quick & easy to make.  Flavor is a bit "blah."  Needs something added for more of a kick, but it was good dipped in ranch.
