This is awesome!  And very easy to substitute ingredients if you are missing any.

This recipe is easy, delicious, and unique! Plums are so perfect for a fruit salsa, particularly if they are firm and just a bit tart. I brought this to a party, and it was a huge hit. Tasted great with regular tortilla chips, and with sweet potato chips.  I altered the recipe slightly, only because I discovered I didn't have enough tomatoes,so I substituted some chopped cucumber. Obviously, this recipe is easily adjusted to your tastes and preferences.

I'm crazy about this recipe and so are my friends.  I'm surprised this recipe isn't rated higher.  It is quite easy to adjust to your tastes and it seems quite forgiving.

I never would have made this recipe but I found this in the allrecipes magazine and decided to did it a try. I am so thankful that I did. My husband was skeptical when I told him but we both devoured it. I served it on toasted baguette slices with goat cheese. Amazing! You have to try this.

I've made this 3 times and it always pleases. I add more plums and cilantro but the rest stays the same. Yum.
