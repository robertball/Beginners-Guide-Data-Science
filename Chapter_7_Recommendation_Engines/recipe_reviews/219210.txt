Recipe/reviews never mentioned pre-baked rolls. I believed bread would bake with all the ingredients. We dont have Schuberts in our neck of the woods. Only veggies,meatballs,sauce and cheese tasted fine. Will do again but with premade rolls. The potential is there.

I could not imagine using dinner rolls as a base for a casserole. Thats what made me try the recipe. There are only 2 of us and we do not generally eat much bread. Found the Sister Schubert rolls in the freezer section and really didn't want to buy that many so I made a cooks change and found a small loaf of soft crusted bread in bakery section and cut it up in 10 pieces. Worked out fine. Used Paul Newman's meat sauce with sausage, otherwise followed the recipe as directed. We had friends over for dinner and 4 people eat 3/4 pan of a 9x13 pan. It was INCREDIABLE. Will keep this one and make again

My friend and I absolutely LOVED this meal!

I used different rolls - the soft onion buns - and that was a mistake. You definitely need a crustier roll, which I am sure is the one Sister Schubert suggests. With that change I know this would be an absolute knock out recipe! Will make again and again. It's too easy not to!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Overall, it was good, but there are a few things to mention that might need adjustments.  (1) I used SS rolls as directed.  I found that the suggested 5 was not enough for a 9x13 pan, and that when I cut the rolls in half, they seemed very large.  So, I used about 6 rolls and I cut them in thirds to cover the bottom of the pan.  (2) Depending on your preference, add more green pepper.  (3) I used two packages of 14 each meatballs for a total 28 meatballs.  Seemed like a good amount.  (4) I did add the chicken broth, as directed, but in the end, saw no purpose for it.  Since the rolls ended up being soggy, less liquid might be a good idea.
I baked it for 45 minutes because I wanted the cheese on top to be slightly crusty.  Definitely let it rest 10 minutes before serving.  Overall, the flavor was very good, but I found the under-layer of rolls to be soggy and a tad unpleasant.  It certainly is comfort food, and kinda fun to make.  I might make it again and put the rolls on top of the entire casserole instead.

MUST COOK THE ROLLS BEFOREHAND!!! This is absolutely a necessary step and the recipe should be amended to include this important step. I made quite a few changes and it turned out super yummy.*Bake the rolls first*To thaw meatballs fast place them all on a paper towel on a microwaveable safe plate. Microwave for a minute and a half. Let sit in microwave until all the peppers and onions are cut up and done. in the middle of sautéing onions and peppers place the chicken stock in with the onion and peppers and continue to cook. When they are done I put the meatballs in with them for a few minutes and mixed them around. When layering the casserole I used a slotted spoon and transferred peppers, onions and meatballs on top of the rolls in my pre greased pan leaving all the liquid behind. I put all the aogahetyi sauce in my leftover pan juices and mixed them for a minute or so. I placed half the mozzeralla on top of meatball mixture. Then placed all the spaghetti sauce spread evenly over the whole casserole. Then topped it off with the remaining mozzarella. *I placed aluminum foil over the casserole for the first 20 minutes because I hate super crunchy cheese. The last 10 minutes I removed it.The family gobbled it up! My husband is a texture person and didn’t like the super soggy bread. So next time I’ll bake with the bread on top covered in cheese. Hope this helps!

Ok it's in the oven with some modifications two casseroles one with onions and peppers the other not.  Made with crescents baked flat, instead of rolls. Cheddar cheese on one italian mozzarella herb and garlic cheese on the other.  Looks good already.can't wait.  Kale salad and casserole for dinner.

My husband & I loved it.  I did not have the biscuits, so I substituted noodles.  It turned out great.  I will make it again.

Flavors are great and it's not bad served fresh from the oven but this is not something you want to make extra of to have leftovers. It just becomes gooey, mushy bread on the bottom.  Just make a meatball sandwich, it'd be much better!!

The only “issue” my family had with it is the bread is soggy on bottom. That may be due to the fact I used sub rolls from Walmart instead of yeast rolls but I still enjoy it. Very good meal and easy recipe.

Easy meatball sandwich substitute!  Needs spicing up, next time.
