This is a great recipe. It works quite well with cream instead of evaporated milk. At first it seemed like it was too sweet, then the next day, it toned down in sweetness and the pumpkin flavor shined through.

good custard style pumpkin pie.  I did not use all of the seasonings.  I used 1/8th tsp ginger powder and 2 tsp.of cinnamon.  I used a Keebler crust.  It would have made 2 of them so I put the rest in a glass bowl with a vanilla wafer cookie crumb topping.  The pie pumpkin I used 1/2 of the pumpkin was about 3 cups of puree. The other half I froze to make another pie.  I would make this again.
