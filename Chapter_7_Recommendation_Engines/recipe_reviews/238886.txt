Luscious! I skipped the salmonella- carrying sprouts, used tomatoes from the garden instead.

How can you go wrong with bacon and avocado? I mixed a teaspoon of mayo with the mashed avocado and green onions. Seasoned the mixture with garlic salt to taste and assembled the sandwich. Great flavors.

WOW, like my hubby said "BLT'S don't always have to be made the same way". We did use a sliced cucumber like others suggested instead of sprouts, lettuce or spinach. I also used multi grain toast because I messed up & didn't buy whole wheat - a senior moment at the grocery store. This is quick, & easy to make & can be adapted to however you like as long as avocado, bacon & tomato are included.

I had avocado and green onions and found this recipe. I didn't have tomatoes and used lettuce instead of sprouts. It was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!! If I didn't want to use bacon I would substitute it with pumpkin seeds and put on the mashed avocado.

In order to make this recipe diet friendly and vegetarian I made it as an open-faced sandwich, used soy bacon, 2 teaspoons light mayo, mixed chopped raw green onions into the mashed avocado rather than cooking them with bacon, and it was still delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Wonderful summertime light meal!

What's not to love-bacon, avocado! Yum! I shredded fresh baby spinach to sub for sprouts (didn't have -usually sprout my own). Any crisp veggie will work! Great thing about this sammie is the ability to use this idea for foundation to make it your own. Add thin sliced cucumber, shredded raw carrot, possibilities are endless! Thanks for a great recipe!

I burned the green onions adding them too early but it didn't matter.  I used homemade whole wheat bread.  This was to DIE for, I could eat this every day.

Delicious as is!!! Then, on a later day, I craved fried green tomatoes. Used the method here, fried my tomatoes and took a pass on the bacon this time. Equally delicious! And, Fritzi, sprout your own...not hard at all!

Absolutely loved this sandwich! I donâ€™t like using mayo on my sandwiches so used ranch dressing instead. Delicious! We will make this again.

Tonight's dinner was easy and tasty thanks to this nice twist on the traditional BLT.  In lieu of mashing, I sliced my avocado, only because it was a little on the firm side.  Otherwise, kept the recipe the same with great results.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
