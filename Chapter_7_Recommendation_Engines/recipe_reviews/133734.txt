HOLY GUACAMOLE!!! I read the reviews before making this and believed that the addition of the sour cream would tone down the mega heat from all the spices. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS ADVICE! We really enjoy hot and spicy foods but this was WAY TOO HOT! I did eat it and I did finish it, but it was a bit painful to do. The spices got to my sinuses and my nose was running so much that I went through 7 tissues during dinner. And the ceiling fan that was keeping us nice & cool seemed as if it was no longer functioning. We had sweat dripping from us by the time we were through. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it does have potential. I will try it again, but I'll cut back on the cayenne by at least half.

This was great! We really enjoyed it. BUT because we value our health and sanity, we did NOT follow the spices as called for. I added 1 1/2 T. cumin, 2 T. chili powder, and 1/4 tsp. cayenne. The first two are variable, but the second needs that reduction. This is a keeper!!!

Everyone in my family loved this! Even my three picky children who "don't like beans!" I cut the cyanne pepper to 1/4 tsp, used black beans and used fat free sour cream. I also cut up boneless skinless chicken breast and cooked it with the broth, chili's and spices in the crockpot, one hour before serving I added black beans, and 15 min before serving I added the sour cream. WE LOVED THIS!

Great chili!  The seasonings in the recipe do need to be adjusted though... be sure to read the other reviews for modifications.

Excellent - although I did follow the advice of so many others before me and cut back on the spices. I used 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tbsp chili powder, and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. PERECT!

Very nice chicken chili!  I made this because I didn't have time for mine - it was easy!  I halved the red pepper and still found it quite hot, but good!  I added two cans stewed tomatoes and a can of drained corn.

This chili is delicious!!  The only reason I rated 4 stars rather than 5 is because I have to reduce the cumin to 2 tbsp and the cayenne to about 1 1/2 tsp.  My husband and I both love spicy foods and 2 tbsp cayenne pepper is EXTREMELY spicy!!  Other than that, I follow the recpipe and it is great with cornbread.  It has become a family favorite..and its quick and easy!

I couldn't believe how spicey this was!! Tried adding more chicken broth and some milk but could not eat. I also choked and had tears running down my face. It would be alot less spicey without the green chilis.

VERY yummy, but SPICY! I didn't have any sour cream, but i'll be adding some before we reheat the leftovers! We used this to spoon over chips and made plates of chicken chili nachos.

AWSOME GOOD A+++. I went right by the receipe, I wouldn't change anything. I was a little scared about putting all the hot spices in, but the sour cream really toned it down. Excellent meal for a cold winter night, I wouldn't advice as a hot summer meal.
I served with grilled cheece sandwiched, really good choice.

My mom and I made this together and we loved it. We didnt add as much chili powder as it calls for cause it would have been way too hot.

I made this last night and it was wonderful !  We had it with some Sam Adams Octoberfest.  Just like everyone else, I cut back on the spices.  But that's not a complaint... I would recommend this recipe to anybody.  Also served it with tortilla chips, sour cream and an artisan blend of Sargento Mexican cheese.  YUM !

love it....I have made this a lot during the winter and my family loves it.  I would suggest adding the cayenne pepper last and only adding the amount you can handle.  2 tablespoons is REALLY hot!

I wanted to make last minute white chicken chili and I've never made any before.  I searched this site for "easy white chicken chili" and found a treasure. This was great and is definitely a keeper.

Loved it. Made a few changes - using what I had on hand. Pinto and Red Beans, skipped the cayenne and used a can of Rotel. Thank you, will make it again soon.

I took this to a party last night and got rave reviews all night long.  I made it just as stated in the recipe and would not change anything.  I did use my husbands home made chili power which has a much better flavor than store bought.  The amount of cumin seems to be too much but it is great.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe.

Yes is mighty spicy but I like it that way but I did a can of diced tomatoes with the green chilis and chili beans my personal preference don't like navy beans. Also let it simmer for about 6 hours the longer the  cook time the better the flavor.

Way too much heat!  This receipe needs to come with a warning!  We did not like this at all. The title should be renamed to Super Easy Super Spicy Chicken chili.

This was a great base to work from for using a leftover roasted chicken.  Used cannellini beans instead of northern, diced tomato w. jalapeno instead of green chilies, no cumin, 1 tsp oregano & 1 tsp minced garlic (based on reviews & similar recipes).  I cut the recipe in half & still cut back to 1-1/2 tsp cayenne and 1-1/2 tsp chili powder, left out sour cream, so the end result was the perfect amount of heat for someone who likes medium spicy.  I'm not familiar with the level of heat from green chilies but I can see how just the original spice content would have made this extremely hot so....Beware!  This was a nice healthy quick meal so I will definitely keep for future, thanks!

I have to give this a 4 when prepared exactly as the recipe dictates. It was very good, but so spicy I couldn't eat more than a few bites. It was also a bit bland - meaning that the only flavor came from the spices. I give it a 5 with the alterations I made the second time around: use no chili powder, 1/4 of the chilies and 1/4 of the cayenne pepper. Add 1/ 4 cup diced, stewed tomatoes WITHOUT the juice (the kind with jalapenos).

I am a huge fan of spicy food, but this was too much.  If foods are going to be spicy they need to have a good flavor which this lacked.

I made this soup in the crockpot and simmered on low for about an hour. Turned out perfect!!! My husband and I love spicy food and this was the perfect spice! If you don't like spicy i'd recommend toning down the cayenne, but if you do, leave the recipe as is or add more! It's delicious! :)

BEWARE!! This soup is lethally HOT! My husband was choking and tears were streaming down his face after the first bite. We also like spicy things. This was over the top. I felt so bad for wasting food!!!

Easy and delicious! I put everything into the crockpot in the AM and it was ready to eat by supper. I used one teaspoon of cayenne and it was perfect -- just spicy enough. It's not as heavy as beef chili, but still has a nice chili taste. I'll be making this often.

Wow! This was very yummy! The beans add such a great consistancy to the stew, and the cumin is a wonderful compliment. We added most of the spice quantities the recipe called for but scaled down the cayenne a bit. We added more green chilis because we had some fresh roasted Hatch and couldn't stop ourselves. It was spicy but not hot and we probably could have gone all the way with the cayenne and still been OK - the sour cream softens up the spice. The only extra I added was some fresh garlic and some salt. You will enjoy! It was delicious.

VERY Good!!!  I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli to save time and adjusted the spices to our tastes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We will definitely be making this again!!

I think this is awesome. It's very rich but there is something delicious about it that keeps me making it over and over again. Especially good on those cold, rainy evenings.

CUT BACK ON THE SPICES!!  I used 2 teaspoons of cayenne, 3 tablespoons of cumin, and 1 tablespoon of chili powder.  I also added 2 full cans of broth (with one half can, the other half goes where?) and a smidge more sour cream.  My house smells so good right now.  Easy to make, no mess. I just used one large 3 qt.fry pan.  Easy and delicious, will make again.

AWESOME! Loved it! I did make a few changes, but it's a great recipe. I used FF sour cream. Also, as far as the spices go, I was out of cayene so I used 2 T cumin and 2 T chili powder. If I had had cayene, I would have used 1 teaspoon, 2 at the most. It still had a little heat without it.   I will make this again and again.

I made 3 good size servings. I read the reviews that said it was super hot so I toned it down too. We thought it was awesome and will for sure make it again. I used all the rotisserie  pieces leftover after just 2 of us ate the chicken the night before.  I used 1 can of beans 1 small can of green chili's (4.5 oz) because that's all I had, 2 TBS ground cumin, 2 tsp chili powder, 2 tsp. cayenne pepper, I added one 6 oz can of tomato paste. We used sour cream and cheese as a garnish on top. But I used cottage cheese instead of sour cream.  It served 2 very healthy servings and then one very healthy serving the next day for my boyfriend who said it was even better. Next time I will make it for my boys who are very picky.

This recipe is really good, but one look at the spice list and I knew I had to change it up a little.  2 tablespoons of cayenne is waaaaaay too spicy for the normal palate, and I've found it gets hotter if you've got leftovers!  So I used 2 tablespoons of cumin and 1/2 tsp of the cayenne.  The heat level was just right.  Might want to try it with some corn next time... :D

Great receipe quick and easy as stated and delicious. My husband loved it. 
I did reduce the the cayenne to 1 T and I made broth by boiling the chicken bones and skin after I removed the meat.

What a great recipe; like other reviews I reduced the spices also to 2 Tbs cumin, 1 Tbs Chile powder & 1 Tbs Cayenne.  I also added 3 cloves crushed garlic and 1 can Rotel.

Very very very good!!! This was the first chicken chili I had ever made and I followed the recipie almost exactly (except I didn't use that much onion since my family isn't too fond of them) and it was a total hit!!! My family did say it was a little bit spicy, but they have really sensitive toungues....I thought it was AMAZING....and I will definitly be making this again!!!!!

Loved it.  Made it for my bro-in-law who loves super spicy stuff so I omitted the sour cream and just served it on the side for those like me who can't take the heat.  Just lessen the Cayenne and add a big dollop of sour cream to your own bowl.  Not too kid-friendly for the "spicy intolerant".

I like spicy, but I also cut the cayenne in 1/2.  It was great for my hubby and me but the kids thought it was still too spicy.  Oh yeah, I added garlic to this for some extra flavor.

After reading the reviews, I cut the pepper in 1/2 and added to taste. Also added a little dry ranch dressing and a can of diced tomatoes...could have added 2 cans.  We ate it with thin crispy corn bread and loved it!  My 3 boys enjoyed it and added hot sauce!

Good and easy! I took the advice of others and cut down the spices. I only used 1/2 tsp cumin and 2T chili powder and cayenne. I served it with crackers and cheese. It was spicy and flavorful. I'll be making it again.

Way too much spice. I added Mac and cheese and made it more like chil-Mac. The only reason I gave 3 stars was bc my 2 year old liked it. But she tends to like spice. I omitted the cayenne pepper all together and added more broth.

I always read reviews, so I knew to cut down on the spices.  The chili is more of a white chili when the cayenne is cut down.  It is a pretty easy recipe.
Since it's only us 2,  HALVED the recipe.  Did not have green chilis, so I used half of a good-sized poblano and fried it with the onion. Cut up 1 and 1/2 chicken breasts  (left over from last night's dinner).  Used 1 T cumin, 1 T chili powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne.  Broiled a slice of Colby Jack on top of each of  the 3 bowls it made. I'm a wimp about heat, and it was spicy but good to me. My man from Texas thought it was perfect. Will save this one! Ty

All I can say is - Thank goodness for reviews!  I am so glad I listened to other reviews and cut down on the spices, especially the cayenne. Could be a typo, maybe the recipe should call for 2 tsp. instead of 2 tbsp., but we found it to be perfect when the amount was cut in half, and we REALLY like spicy food.  Otherwise this is an excellent chili, and extremely easy to make!

I love this recipe because you can keep everything on hand and it is so easy.  It's great to use left over roasted chicken from the deli too.  I cut WAY back on the cayenne pepper and chilli powder too.  I use less that half of what it calls for.  Way too hot with all the seasonings

I love this recipe. It really is too easy. Especially when you have the rotiserrie chicken. I just reduce some of the spices, I have a two year old.  My REALLY picky husband gave it a 10 out of 10. He wishes that I would crank up the heat though! Crazy man. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Never cooked chicken chili before and this sounded like what I was trying to accomplish with a tweek to it. I took this to a party where 3 people work in the food industry, so I was very wary...THEY LOVED IT! However, I cut back on the onion (used about 1/3 medium chopped), and used only chili powder and crushed red pepper "to taste". I also snuck some Suzie's hot sauce (better than tobasco)in. In addition, I set it up in the crockpot...Peppercorn parm. bagettes accompanied it for slopping up the yummy remains! IT'S GOING TO BE A YUMMY TREAT THIS WINTER!  Thanks!!!

LOVED this!!! I had left out the cayenne because I didn't have any but would have liked to have added some to give it a bit more of a kick to it. I don't think I would do the full 2 tablespoons though :) This was even better the next day!

Okay, I doubled this recipe to serve 12 as I have 5 children and wanted to have enough for a second meal.  If you do this, put in maybe HALF the spices!!!  This is like eating fire if you don't!!!  I'm going to make another batch of this tomorrow and mix it with this one so it's edible.  I do think it will be wonderful then.  Thanks for the recipe, this one is much easier than the one I was using.

This chili rocks!  We like our chili extremely hot, so I added a few fresh diced jalepeno peppers and a habenero pepper.

I made this recipe the other day when it was cold outside.  I made it just the way it said and it was bit spicy for our 4 year old, but every loved it. I make chili every Halloween for about 16 people and this one will be the one I dish up this year!

Absolutely wonderful!  Some of the best chicken chili that we have had.
