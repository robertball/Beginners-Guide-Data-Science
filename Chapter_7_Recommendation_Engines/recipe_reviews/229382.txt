Tasty.  I used less grated carrots and substituted diced apple for some of the celery since hubby isn't as crazy about celery as I am.  Nice cool dish  for this hot weather.  I would like to try mandarin oranges next time.  Used sugar free jello.  The reason I cut down the amount of carrot is that I thought it was getting too full for the amount of liquid.
