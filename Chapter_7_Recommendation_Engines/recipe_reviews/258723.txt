Loved it! Though I switched out the margarine for butter, and used chicken broth in place of fish stock. It was flavorful and loved all around the table!

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out okay. I however, like Swaii fish instead of Tilapia. It was my first time using Tilapia and this recipe. My husband makes an awesome fish. The fish is dipped in egg and then in the garlic flour and pan seared in butter. It’s amazing!! I like piccata on chicken but, not on fish. It’s just my own opinion
