The French fried onions bring a new  dimension to fish.  PLEASE, PLEASE try  this as written before you change it.   And it begs to be changed.  Let me  explain.  If you bring the ingredients  to room temp and bread and cook, you're  going to enjoy.  You may want a bit more lemon, I did.  But you start there (and it's not a bad start at all). Once you've  cooked it, you know you want to make it Mexican, Italian, etc. And I think it lends itself to whatever  you want to do. I have only one criticism, I didn't think of it.. I have written many reviews, but have never recommended any recipe more highly.  Tweak it, and you  will gather the laurels.

Normally we don't care for fish, but this was very tasty! I could see adding cajun seasoning would make it even better (there's a good cajun seasoning recipe on this site)

One of our faves.  Excellent flavor and crispy-ness.  My toddler's favorite meal.

This was pretty good.  The fish coats very well and I didn't have enough of the onions to cover all my fish so I had to improvise.  I used flounder and was perfectly cooked in 15 minutes.  I could definitely see some more spice added  to the coating.
