Delightful. This went so well with injera bread. I used the turmeric and also added a habanero pepper. I cooked it in a tagine instead of on the stove-top. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this as a side dish, and followed the recipe. I used olive oil because it's healthier. I also used the turmeric.  Dish is mild and the spices don't stand out.  It was great for my dad who doesn't like things with a lot of spice. My sons and I added hot sauce. Next time I will add more turmeric and some hot peppers after taking out my dad's portion. Hot pepper oil would probably work well, too.

Very good.  Great side dish and easy enough. The spices don't overpower.   Olive oil is great and healthier of course.

Delicious. Only addition I made was to use Penzy's Red and Black pepper for a bit of heat. Great side dish and will make again.
