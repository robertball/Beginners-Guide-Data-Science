this is by far the best sauce I have ever tasted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never realized how much taste bourbon would add. I love this taste. my only correction to make it a little more friendly for kids would be to decrease the hot sauce.  mine might have been hot because I added a hot salsa.  but everyone loves this recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as posted. The sauce came out excellent. I love the taste. But it really makes a lot of it. but that is ok, becuase i really experiment alot with it.

I grilled with it on the George foreman grill with steak and chicken. the taste was just ok becuase most of the sauce got burnt from the grill. 

then i tried baking chicken in the oven. OH MY GOD was it good. grilling with this cause is def out but baking is superb. I proably make it again this weekend however i will put it in the crockpot and put some hot sausage links in it. I think it will be really good this way.

GREAT Sauce!  I wasn't sure what to do with it once I made it so I just marinated chicken breasts in the sauce overnight then cooked them at 375 for about 35 mins. and what a delicious meal!  I cut the recipe in half and I still have a ton of sauce.  EXCELLENT!  I will definately make this often.

Very good! I used 32 oz of my own homemade salsa and added minced garlic. Perfect. I used this recipe in a rib cook off and subbed regular V8 instead of the hot&spicy and used a medium salsa and we took first place. This makes a lot!

This was the first time I have ever made any sauce.  We ended up marinating chicken and jumpo shrimp as well in this and it came out great!  It's sweet but it catches you off guard with the spicy!  Pretty unique stuff!

WOW!!! It's hot but not tongue killing taste-bud dulling hot. Wonderful flavor. Not for the weak of heart.....or tummy.

I only made half the recipe amount since I wasn't sure about how it would turn out. Sadly, we didn't care too much for it. Felt that there were too many flavors going on and more of a Mexican taste as one reviewer suggests. But don't let my review stop you from making it if that is the flavor you are going for.

This was ok.  Too much mexican flavor to use for bbq.  I toned that down with dried chipolte flakes.  The sweet/hot thing was nice...sweet at first with a spicy finish.

I used leftover salsa from mexican takeout and I used cheap bourbon. Even with the changes this is good. I was doubtful because of the salsa but it came out good. Its not for kiddos though but the men couldnt stop talking about this sauce. A keeper.

I had a can of V8 juice I needed to use up when I came across this recipe.  I liked that it was a very different from a normal bbq-type sauce.  The honey certainly is the first thing you taste and then the heat creeps in at the end.  It stuck to the chicken we grilled very nicely and didn't char too quickly which I was worried about because of the high honey content.

I halved the recipe and I am glad I did because it still made quite a bit more than I needed. The sauce was easy to make and tastes good but but not extraordinary. I used it for grilled chicken and it was fine. I think it would be much better on hot wings.
