This recipe was just OK.  First of all, it was pretty bland.  I would definitely season (and maybe even brown) the potatoes first so they are more flavorful.  I also found the potato to egg ratio to be too high.  It seemed like mostly potatoes with a little egg around them.  I'd half the potatoes if I made it again.  It needs salt and pepper for seasoning.  And I'd put the cheese throughout for even flavor, not just on top.  The whole thing was kind of bland except for the sausagey bites, but it's a good base to start from if you tweak it a bit.

I've had a lot of different breakfast casseroles and this is THE BEST so far.  Everyone at my breakfast loved it -- men and women.  The mushroom soup sounded wierd, but it worked!  I did one layer of tater tots, one layer of crumbled sausage, one layer of sauteed fresh mushrooms, red peppers and onions, and one layer of pepper jack and cheddar cheese; added some salt and green Tabasco to the egg mixture and poured all over the top of the casserole.  A sprinkling of paprika for color and it was a beautiful as well as tasty dish.  I've made this several times now -- great make-ahead meal!  It will take longer to cook than the recipe says -- about 1 to 1.5 hours to properly set up.

The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because I changed the recipe so much. I used half HOT sausage and half Regular sausage. I sauteed green peppers and onions with FRESH mushrooms before adding them to the cooked sausage. Instead of regular cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of mushroom with garlic soup to add a little flavor. I also added a half cup of cheese to the egg mixture and increased the amount of cheese sprinkled on top. With these alterations, it was an EXCELLENT dish. I got so many compliments and will make this again and again.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  Forget the holidays..this is great year-round!  ;)
One note:  if you don't thaw the tater tots, you will have a very soupy consistency.  Otherwise it's great.

Delicious!!! I tried the layered approach (tots, sausage, mushrooms, cheese) then put the eggs mixture on top.  I also used a large souffle pan instead of the rectangular dish to give it depth.  Assembled it completely the night before and it came out beautifully.  The cheese gave it a nice brown crown.  Will definitely make again :D

My family loved this recipe.  I feed seven people with plenty of leftovers!  I did sautee onions and green peppers with the sausage for some added flavor and made the entire recipe (including throwing in the tator tots) the evening prior.  The consistency was just fine.  I added about one-half cup of sharp cheddar to the recipe, and topped it off with about the same during the last ten minutes.  This was yummy and a new family favorite!

Sage sausage gives it a really nice kick.  As recommended, I added sauted onion & minced garlic, green peppers, fresh mushrooms.  I also used frozen hash browns rather than tater tots.  I doubled the recipe, but found I only really needed one 32 oz. pkg of hash browns.

This recipe is so good!  I made this for company and everyone loved it and had seconds.  I will make this again, but will make a couple minor changes.  I agree that adding a little onion and possibly chopped green pepper would make it even better.  I used sage sausage because my family prefers it to regular sausage.  I also needed to bake it about an extra 10 minutes, but the texture then was perfect.  And it is so easy to prepare, which makes it a hit for me.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I decided to try this recipe because I was tired of all the same old same old...IT WAS GREAT!!  My family are huge breakfast fans and this was a great change.  Plus, it is able to serve alot!! It is easy to whip up and throw in the oven to cook while you are doing other things.  For a little spice, I added 1/4 cup chopped red and green peppers.  I've recently passed the recipe onto my mom and now I've got them addicted too!! thank you!!

Fantastic! Just made this for Christmas Day. Used thawed tater tots and layered with sauteed shrooms, onions and peppers as per other reviewers suggestions. Made it with Better Than Eggs and added a bunch of green sauce and Emerils Essence to the eggs and soup mix.  Covered it with tin foil and baked for 50 minutes, then 25 minutes more uncovered to solidify the center.  Use lots of a zippy cheese for extra pizzaz.  Serve with green taco sauce on top and fruit on the side. Very filling and delicioso! Since it's so versatile and can be made in advance I plan to use this recipe for holidays, work potlucks and for visiting company.

ok, after gathering the things from the fridge and pantry i think i can see what some of the problems are.
1. this calls for crowns not tots. they are different.
2. ore-ida crowns come in a 30 oz bag so you are missing a few ounces of potatoes.they add spice to them, and well that is how you have to pay for the extra effort) if you use this brand minus your self an egg or cook a bit longer.
3. let your crowns set out to thaw. rarely to frozen things go right into the oven unless they say tv dinner on the box.
4. dont try to mix eggs right out of the fridge with frozen potatoes. it just wont work correctly. let the eggs set out as well. it wont kill you i promise. this is the correct way to make good eggs.
5.carnation condensed milk come in a 12 oz can so use the soup can to measure the milk and give the rest to your cat.
6. dont try to make it simplier by layering. mix the stuff together.it will help the sausage and potatoes soak up the egg.

and there you have what i think are causing some of the problems. because this stuff is GOOD!

Everyone loved this recipe, old and young alike.  The only change I made is adding about 1/2 cup of cheese to the mixture before I put it in the baking dish because we really love cheese.  I put it together the night before and stored it in the fridge.  It still came out fine.

EMERGENCY SHORTCUT:  I was in a horrible rush with several last minute, teen boys on their way here so I used frozen O'brian-style hashbrowns as a shortcut.  There were peppers and onions in the mix so I skipped that step, but added two cloves of garlic for fuller flavor.  It looked soupy enough so I didn't add any extra liquid.  After baking 45 minutes the results were a bit watery.  Probably from the frozen veggies.  The veggies were a little undercooked too so I baked it for another 30 minutes.  It came out PERFECT and was well worth the wait!  Even with a doubled recipe the pans were emptied and the audience raved.  My 9yo son asked if we could make this every Saturday and one guest raved that he was glad I didn't use cr. of mush. soup like his mom (Funny, because I used two cans for the dbl. recipe!)  Next time I think I'll bump up the temp. and the cooking time.  I usually don't comment on a recipe I've mutilated so fiercely, but this was such a quick and delicious hit in a moment of desperation.  Thank you for helping me save the day!!

This casserole turned out wonderful!  I used turkey sausage and low fat cheese to cut the calories and it was still awesome!  A keeper...

I thought this was ok. My guests said they liked it. But there are too many potatoes.
I will make this again, but with half the potatos and more vegtables and meat.
The cheese makes more of a crust on top... next time I will add the cheese in the casserole and then serve it with more on top.

This was GREAT!  Took it to church this morning and it was DEVOURED!  I made it up last night and left it in the fridge to just pop in the oven this am.  Worked out perfectly and the ONLY change I made was to add a full cup of cheese rather than just 1/2 cup.  SO YUMMY!  THANKS!

We've made this recipe several times and really enjoy it!  I always add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, a little minced onion and garlic, and I use whatever frozen potatoes we have on hand (tater tots and hash browns both work well).  I do add a good bit more sharp shredded cheddar, though.  Actually, I add a lot more -- probably 1 cup in the casserole and 2 cups on top, cooked til the cheese is bubbly and browned a little.  If you live in the southeast where Neese's sausage is available, you've GOT to use that -- and get the "hot" variety.  So good!  I sometimes use a pound and a half, depending on what's in the fridge.  We slice squares of this casserole, wrap individually and freeze -- it freezes beautifully!  That's a big plus.  So nice when you wake up hungry and don't have time for (or don't feel like) cooking -- you can just defrost and then heat a square of this casserole in the microwave, and it's just as delicious as fresh out of the oven.  Very much a comfort food.  Thanks bunches for sharing this recipe! :)

I love this breakfast casserole. I found this recipe two years ago when I was looking for something different (but easy) to make for my family Christmas morning... before presents.

That Christmas Eve, I made it (exactly as the recipe indicated) the night before and heated it up Christmas morning. Everyone loved it. Instant family favorite. I did think it needed salt, though. And, for me, pepper.  

Shortly after, I began getting requests for this casserole on a regular basis. A few times, I used Sage sausage. Excellent flavor. A couple times, I did not have condensed milk, so I just used a little regular milk. Still tasted great. 

A few times, I have added garlic salt. One time, I used cream of mushroom, with roasted garlic. 

Hmmm.. and, another time, I used diced potatoes with green and red peppers.. Added some onions to the egg mixture. Nice flavors..

It seems you can use this base recipe and come up with multiple variations, based upon your likes and dislikes....

Next time, I'm thinking of using bacon, rather than sausage, and mixing the cheese throughout the mixture, with just a bit spread across the top.

Okay, I absolutely hate it when people rate a recipe with less than 5 stars after they modified it in some way.  With that said, I think this was the best, without any additions, but if you like a little zing, add a teaspoon of mustard powder, a chopped onion, and green pepper.  I have made this for my family 3 times since the first time, which was Christmas morning.  Easy to put in fridge prepared, and then just bake the next morning!!!

This casserole was fantastic!!! I added some onion when I browned the sausage, and I also put a pound of cooked crumbled bacon in the mix. It was a hit! I will definently make this over, and over again!! Edited on 1/19/2007..The last few times I used 2 pounds of spicy J. Dean sausage instead of 1. It really enhances the flavors!

One word: Excellent! I took many other's advice and added some chopped red & green bell peppers, and some chopped green onion to the eggs. Also, I added a dash of onion & garlic powder to the tots. 5 minutes before it was done, I sprinkled a little more cheese on the top to melt. My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of this great stuff! Thank you!!

Made exactly as directed and I really liked it as did company. Thanks to other reviewers, I found out the can of milk is just regular milk. You fill up the soup can with milk after you pour the soup in. Will definitely make this again.

I made this casserole this morning for my coworkers and it was gone within 55 minutes. Wonderful. I sauteed one onion, one bell pepper, a package of mushrooms and added it in the egg mixture and in the mixture I added garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. I allowed the potatoes to thaw and I kind of crumbled them up and then I put the sausage on top of that. I wrapped it up and put it in the refrig and this morning I just poured the eggs on top of the other two layers. I also added about a cup of cheese into the eggs. It took about 1 hour and ten minutes to bake and then I put the 1/2 c cheese on top and it came out beautifully! The only addition I am going to try next time will be green chilis for a little extra kick. Thank you!

I loved this!  Tator totes are a delicious addition.  Think next time I will use ham instead of sausage as potatoes and ham go especially well together.  Also, I used spicy sausage and no mushrooms, onions or green & red pepper.  If I was making for brunch I would have added those but since we were having it for breakfast thought I would keep it simple.  Will definitely make again.

Because so many changes are needed for this recipe, I couldn't rate any higher .. no salt & pepper in the recipe or any other seasoning ... also, the picture shows what could be red pepper or pimento, but makes no mention of it  ...  this is delicious, but not as recipe reads.

YUM! I made this for Easter. My friend is a vegetarian and I used broccoli inplace of sausage. It was by far my favorite breakfast casserole recipe.

Used sage pork sausage, crumbled maple bacon, potatoes o'brien, sauteed yellow onion and garlic, and cambell's "roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup".  Mixture did indeed take about an hour and a half to fully cook through.  Sprinkled the cheese on top, then sliced green onion..then more cheese.  Needless to say, it got rave reviews from my whole family.  Will indeed make again.

Delicious casserole. I used frozen hash browns as I had no rounds both times making.  I ran luke warm water over potatoes while in a strainer to defrost a tad.  Placed potatoes on paper towel to absorb any little water left.  I used 10 eggs (1st time)as this is what I had on hand.  I omitted mushrooms(for kids taste).  You could add anything to this and it still be yummy.  Make sure to follow to a tee and if you have any extra items add your own touches for personal taste( bell pepper, crumbled bacon, onion, etc) I normally do not change up recipes the first time making.  I made this twice and second time I added some additional touches (crumbled bacon and onion).  This recipes is perfect as written or with extra touches.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great make ahead recipe. The only changes I made are as follows -  double the sausage, use potatoes o'brien instead of potato rounds, and use 2 cups of cheddar cheese - 1.5 cups IN the casserole and 1/2 cup on top. Delicious!

Even though this recipe is for the mornings, I decided to make this one evening for the family.  Added a couple of  ingredients of my own (1/2 onion and 1/2 green bell pepper) while browning sausage.     After the whole thing was finished cooking, I topped my portion with salsa.  Hubby gives it 5 stars.  Son gives it 5 stars.

YUMMY!!! I have made this a few times. I add onion to mine and omit the mushrooms. I also add some seasonings; oregano,garlic powder, seasoning salt & pepper. Will make this again and again. Thanks Sue!
***We use fat free milk at home and I noticed that it takes longer than an hour to bake completely through when used in this recipe. I made this again over the weekend and I subbed canned evaporated milk and it turned out PERFECT! No extra baking needed.

Prepared for family brunch and got rave reviews! This is a real keeper. We used tater tots and placed them in the bottom of the casserole as a "crust." Could use extra 10 minutes of cooking. Excellent recipe! Looking forward to making again.

Very good.  Odds are it will be a little soupy when you pull it out, but all you have to do is put it back in (I actually had to add almost 30 minutes extra cooking time).  Spicy/sage sausage gives it a little extra and needed flavor.

I made this recipe for Easter brunch and got rave reviews. It truly was phenomenal! I layered the tator-rounds in the bottom of the baking dish. It actually made a full layer and then I spaced out the remaining rounds on a second layer. I whisked the eggs and milk together and then added the remaining ingredients (including the sausage) to the egg mixturem, then dumped over the potato rounds. The only minor complaint is that the dish is a little salty. However, I will make this dish over and over again!

We thought this was really good but I made a few alterations in a hope to make it a little healthier.  I substituted 50% less fat pork sausage, I used a small carton of egg beaters and then only 4 eggs, I used probably a cup of cheese but I used sharp cheddar 2% cheese, I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, only 1/2 cup skim milk, 98% fat free soup, and probably 20 oz of obrien hashbrowns.  We changed A LOT but kept the basic recipe the same.

This is one of my famous recipes.  When my friends have a brunch, I'm not asked what to bring, I'm told to bring this!  It freezes well too so I make double batches and leave it in the freezer to thaw the night before and bake in the morning.

Like many other people I thought this was a great base recipe. I browned Bob Evans Sausage with some onions and red peppers. Instead of using potato rounds I used Oreida hash browns. I just eyeballed how much I thought looked good. LOL Then I added one and a half cans of cream of mushroom soup with some cracked black pepper. I used a lot more cheddar cheese on top because let's face it, I'm a cheese hound! Thanks for the great base recipe!!

Delicious! My family loved this dish Christmas morning! I doubled the amount of sausage, and sauteed onions, mushrooms, and garlic in olive oil.  As suggested, I layered the ingredients (onion tater tots, sausage, onion & mushroom mixture, egg mixture). I added more cheese during the last 10 minutes. This is a keeper! ;D)

This was excellent!! It was a very filling breakfast casserole. All ages loved this. We had leftovers and this casserole tasted even better the next day - if that is even possible.
I will make again when we have overnight company.

We've tried a lot of breakfast casseroles for Christmas morning, and this is my family's favorite. I even make it for my neighbors! We enjoy the ease and they heartiness of this dish. My family looks forward to Christmas because, not only are they going to get Christmas dinner and baking, but they know this is for breakfast!

This casserole was easy AND delicious! I layered the ingredients using the potatoes as my base layer. Since I didn't have any potato rounds on hand, I used the seasoned waffle fries I had in my freezer. They added a great flavor to this dish. What we didn't finish for dinner, we devoured at breakfast the next day. This one's a keeper!

this recipe has been a Christmas morning tradition for about five years now.  SOME MODIFICATIONS after the 1st time I made it: Use less eggs and more cheese and meat, otherwise it taste like bunch of scrambled eggs.  6-8 eggs, 1 1/2-2 pkg.'s sausage ( I use the Italian seasoned kind or half reg. and half seasoned). 1  8 oz. pkg of cheese.  I also added 1/2 of a large sweet chopped onion and salt and pepper to taste.  This is a hit and continues to be made every X-mas morning.

I make this every Christmas morning.  It's always a favorite.  I use Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage in place of the regular sausage.  Very easy to make.  I usually tend to add more cheese as well, but it's what you prefer.

We loved this!  I used thawed tater tots as many reviewers did and I added a bit of season salt to the eggs along with pepper.  We had a lot of leftovers - half of the recipe would still be plenty for just 2 people.  This reheated very nicely.

This was very good.  I love breakfast casseroles.  Only made 2 changes.  I added onions, which we really like, to the sausage while it was browning.  And I only had hash brown patties which I tore into bite sized pieces.  I've noticed some reviewers confused about the 10.75 oz can of milk.  Once you've emptied your can of soup you fill the can with milk.  It doesn't call for condensed or evaporated milk.  Will make this again for sure!

I make this recipe every year for Christmas morning.  It has become an expectation with my family.  Sometimes I use bacon or ham and then I use either O'Brian potatoes or shredded hashbrowns.  Thanks for a great recipe

Very, very good!  Used spicy sausage, added the cheese in the casserole, and sauteed fresh mushrooms with garlic and onion.  We used the leftovers and made breakfast burritos (in tortillas with sour cream and salsa), which were absolutely fabulous - got that idea from another reviewer.  Thanks!

Loved this receipe.  I only had tator tots, so I used them to cover the bottom only of the baking dish.  I did not use the full bag.  Also, I mixed one cup of cheddar cheese into the eggs in stead of putting it on top.  The casserole turned out moist and yummy.  I did need to cook it for an hour however.  It's great for supper too!  Thanks Sue.

I made this casserole for a church breakfast. It was extremely easy to make. The recipe was right on the money as far as baking time, but my 9x13 baking dish wouldn't hold all of the egg mixture. I have frozen it and will bake it early next week. The texture of the casserole and the flavor were excellent. There were some leftovers, since this is a very filling dish. They were at least as good as the first time around. Next time I make it, I will try some of the suggestions made by other reviewers. Definitely a five-star recipe.

GREAT!  I used potatoes o'brien instead of tater tots and didn't have mushrooms to add... but added some garlic powder and onion powder to the potatoes and half cooked them before adding them to the mix.  Very tasty leftovers!!!

I made this Christmas Eve and baked it Christmas morning.  The result was not good.  The top half baked fine, but the bottom was pure soup!  Too many eggs perhaps?

This was a big hit for my family.  They don't like mushrooms, so I used Cream of Chicken soup and sauteed some bell pepper instead.  Thanks!

I've been making this recipe for quite some time. I use half as much milk as the recipe calls for so it cooks faster. I cook it 50 min to an hour. I also thaw the frozen potatoes first so it cooks faster. I have tried all sorts of frozen potatoes. Tastes better with green pepper and onion. I also use 1 cup cheese, 1/c up mixed with the egg mixture and 1/2 cup on top at the end of baking.

I really like this recipe. I used frozen Potatoes O'Brien (it has onions and peppers in it) and the garlic cream of mushroom soup. It added flavor without dumping salt into the recipe. I've also made it with egg substitute and it turns out just as good.

I've made this for Christmas breakfast the past 2 years. It's so easy to assemble the day before and bake in the morning. I omit the mushrooms and add more seasoning.

This was definitely a family favorite, but I did a fair amount of tweaking, too! Since this is fresh veggie season here, I added some candy onions, green, and red peppers that we seem to have so many of.  Before mixing, I sauteed them with the mushrooms.  I also found the egg mixture to be quite a lot, so next time, I'd take that down by about 1/3.  The casserole definitely needs some seasoning, so in addition to salt and pepper, I added some garlic.  I used sharp cheddar cheese, and probably doubled (if not more) than was is called for in the recipe.  All in all, it's easy to make and makes a LOT, which was exactly what I needed at the time.  I'd consider using spicy sausage next time...and I definitely plan to try this with fresh golden potatoes in the future, as well.

I make this casserole about once a month for coworkers or guests and everyone always loves it!. I mix everything in a bowl the night before and leave out the tater tots. Then in the morning I add the tots and bake it. Depending on who is eating it, I sometimes add onions and or peppers, sometiems I cut it in half, but its always a big hit.

Tried this for my annual Christmas Eve breakfast meal.  Two of my teenagers loved  it, one liked it except for the mushrooms, and the other didn't care for it because he said it had a strange combo of flavors.  I thought it was pretty good, but not something I would make real often.

This was delicious! I did make a few adjustments.  I did two pounds of sausage (original Jimmy Dean), fresh mushrooms, and sliced green pepper.  I put these three in the bottom of the 9x13 pan.  Then I poured in the egg/soup mix.  I used half 'n half instead of milk, to make it hold together better.  I used southern potatooes (the little cubes), but I think next time I want to try hash brown shoestring potatoes.  I only used half the amount of potatoes.  It was a wonderful dish that I served to company for brunch.  I made it the night before and put it in the fridge overnight.  I cranked up the temp of the oven to 375 for the last 10-15 minutes to melt the cheese.  Highly recommend this!

We had this for brunch today and everybody loved it. Very easy to prepare and very tasty! We don't eat sausage, so I used 1 lb of Gimme Lean (a begetarian sausage substitute). I only had 9 eggs, used cream of celery soup and onitted the mushrooms. I used frozen hash browns with onions and peppers for added flavor. Next time I'll use 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of egg substitute. Makes a great meal served with biscuits and fresh fruit!!

I made this ahead of time to heat up on a camping trip. I added the cheese while heating it up over the fire - and covered it tightly with foil. I added fresh mushrooms, but the red peppers and onions would be a great addition. Do add salt and pepper. I thawed the tater tots. Use those instead of hashbrowns. The crispy outside of the tater tots made this even better. It was a huge it with my entire crowd.

I just made this and it was great!  I was giving it a "trial run" for my new years morning party.  I omitted the mushrooms and used southern style hashbrowns with peppers and onions.  I also added salt, pepper, and a little garlic and onion powder for flavor.  It was excellent.  Will be making it again!

My family really liked this recipe. I made a few changes to it though - I kept the base and added a can of dice green chiles to spice it up a little, salt & pepper and used potatoes o'brien w/onions and peppers instead. This does great to prepare the night before and store in the fridge till the next morning.

I just served this for Mother's Day brunch and it turned out fabulous. There was not one bit of it left and I think my guests were hoping to have leftovers to take home! I used Bob Evans Sage breakfast sausage sauteed with onions and fresh mushrooms. For the frozen potatoes I used onion tater tots. It gave it an excellent flavor. It did take a while to bake but it was well worth it. Im sure it would have turned out great without the variation too! Thanks for a great recipe...

Really tasty. I halved the recipe, omited the sliced mushrooms, used southern style hash browns and mixed in some cheddar. It did take a long time to cook (about an hour) but was definitely worth it. Next time I think I'll include chives and parsley for a little added flavor and color.

I made this today for our New Years Day breakfast. I did read the reviews first before making it. Most of which said it needed more flavoring. So I did add some onions that I sauted while I cooked the sausage. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon salt. And used 2 cups of cheddar cheese and it was Great. So just add other ingredients according to your own taste. It is a great recipe.  Thanks.

Great recipe and so flavorful.  I love the taste that you get from the potato patty/tater tot.  I did add some extra veggies when sauteing the sausage and some red pepper flakes to the eggs.  Will surely be making it again and again.

This is an easy and amazing recipe.  It is not too  greasy or salty and it is easy to alter by adding diced onions and peppers or adding bacon or ham.

We use this recipe frequently in my home. Because I have a few that won't eat mushrooms I use a can of cream of celery soup instead and nix the sliced mushrooms. Overall a great breakfast treat!

I've made this many times - I actually have one in the oven right now!  I don't like mushrooms so I use cream of chicken soup and I omit the mushrooms.  I mix some cheese in with the egg so the cheese isn't just on top.  I also like to use different cheeses.  The one baking right now has a mix of extra sharp cheddar, jack, pepper jack, and mozzarella.  
The issue I have is cooking time.  Every time I make this, I have to bake it much longer than the indicated time.  The eggs in the center take so long to set.  I just haven't been able to find the "optimal" cooking time.
All in all, this is a great dish if you have to make breakfast for a group of people.  I usually make this and a french toast casserole for the non-egg eaters.

This was so tastey!  I'd been looking for something like this to please a crowd with ease.  It's great!  I think I used leftover ground turkey and fresh mushrooms that I actually had on hand.  It's a wonderful forgiving recipe that really, you could add or take away from according to your pref and it's still great!

I thought this was a great day starter! I didn't use any mushrooms, but added Seasoning Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, and Onion Powder. It was awesome!

Great base recipe. Had to adjust for what my pantry contained.  Subbed out tomatoes for mushrooms, hamburger for sausage, did add basil, parsley, and rosemary.  Fried up some thin sliced potatoes in the hamburger fat. And I had to use velveeta instead of cheddar.  I guess I just liked the idea of adding the can of mushroom soup. Anyway the fam loved it, no left overs.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it has good bones, but it does need a little tweeking to really get some good flavor. Per another reviewers suggestion, I used cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup. I really liked the additional layer of taste. I always like to use dry mustard in savory dishes like this so added a little to this. I browned the crowns prior to making the dish. Didn't really take more time, as I put the crowns in the oven before I even took the other ingredients out of the fridge / pantry. As the crowns cooked I browned the sausage (adding diced onion) and then made the egg mixture. I added the cheese into the egg mixture to even distribute the cheese so there wasn't a big glob on to. Turned out nicely, but seems that it is still missing some oomph. But will make again.

My 4 star rating is based on the recipe as written, I think this casserole is way too rich for my tummy first thing in the morning.  Otherwise, I thought it was pretty good, and everyone else thought it was great.  It's also really easy to put together - just wish it didn't take so long to bake.  I usually end up throwing the frozen tater crowns in the oven while it's pre-heating to give them a little head start.  Since I made this original recipe, I have made my own version of it at least 20 times.  The only changes that I made is that I replaced the sausage with diced ham and I omit the sliced mushrooms at my picky step-son's request (I don't think he knows about the cream of mushroom soup hehe)   Anyway - with the changes - I give it 5 stars, and I will continue to make it again and again.

Excellent recipe. Made this for myplaygroup and everyone raved about it. I prepared it the night before leaving out the potato round until ready to bake. Took about 60mins in glass casserole. Will definitely make again. One friend said she will be serving this Christmas Morning.

Made this for work breakfast.  It was gone in 10 minutes flat.  Used tater tots, added green and red pepper, mushrooms, garlic, onion.  Made it the night before.  I layered my ingredients and then poured the egg mixture over it.  Fantastic!  I'm making it again for a girls brunch.

This was really good even though I changed it.  I added onion, red pepper, green pepper, omitted mushrooms, and subbed the cream of mushroom with cream of chicken soup.  People asked for recipe.  Makes a lot.

I like how easy this casserole is, especially for a large group.  I used cream of chicken soup rather than cream of mushroom, which gave it quite a bit more flavor.

I didn't have any breakfast meat on hand, so went without and omitted the mushrooms.  I used 10 eggs and thought this turned out really great.  I mixed cheese in also and let the entire mixture sit in the fridge for a few hours prior to baking.  I baked this in a stone and left it in for almost 90 minutes.  This would have been even better with any breakfast meat in it.

This was very average - hence the 3 stars. There is so much one can do with breakfast casseroles, that it was almost a shame this one left out most of the flavorful stuff. The frozen potatoes came out soggy and barely cooked, the canned mushrooms have no taste and only brought a weird rubbery addition to the dish, and the only good thing was the cheesy crust. It also stuck to the baking dish despite a lot of grease. Everybody ate it without major complaints, nobody asked for seconds, and we were all hungry again within the hour.

Very bland.  We did not let the hashbrowns thaw beforehand so it was a watery, sloppy mess.  Also if you add veggies as others suggest, make sure they are cooked first so they are not so harsh compared to the other ingredients.  We will not make this again.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I did add about a cup of cheese to the mixture besides the cheese I put on top because we LOVE cheese!  I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than it suggested.  I will be making this again at Christmas.

This was very good. I didn't add as many eggs as it called for, and I didn't have enough potatoes (in fact only almost 1 cup) so I substituted dried potato flakes. Made it thicker of a consistency. I think I would prefer more potato chunks then I had, but I would probably still cut them down to sub some potato flakes for the texture addition.

Super easy and delicious! I added onion when cooking the sausage, as well as about a cup of cheese to the egg mixture before baking. And I guessed the "can of milk" is evaporated milk??? That's what I used at least and it seemed to do the trick. I used potatoes o'brien instead of the round, as well. It took about an hour and 10 minutes to fully cook so there was no jiggly egg center. Overall, I'll be making this again!

This recipe as written was very boring. Nothing wrong with it but it needs more punch. I did add cheese as others suggested (2 c. sharp cheddar) but it was still too bland for my taste. Also needs salt. I would make again but use another potato variety and some addtl spices to kick it up. But it was easy though.

Awesome recipe! I did use cubed hashbrowns with red and green peppers already mixed in instead of the potato rounds and it added a really good flavor. I also thought it didn't have enough cheese, so next time I'll add cheese to the mixture as well as on top. But it was fabulous! A nice high-protein breakfast that I can have in the fridge and warm up pieces every morning. No more cooking every morning!

EXCELLENT recipe! Dont forget to include the mushroom soup! I copied another posted and did one layer of tater tots, one layer of crumbled sausage, one layer of sauteed fresh mushrooms, and one layer of cheddar cheese; added some salt and green Tabasco to the egg mixture and poured all over the top of the casserole. A sprinkling of paprika for color and it was a beautiful as well as tasty dish. It took 1 hour to cook. I have been reheating pieces every morning for breakfast! Delish!

I enjoyed this recipe, although I made a few corrections as suggested by other reviewers and a few of my own.  I decided to layer this dish - layer 1 (tater tots), layer 2 (cooked ground turkey sausage), layer 3 (sautéed red and yellow bell peppers and onions), layer 4 (cheeses - extra sharp cheddar, Monterey and Colby), and layer 5 (mixture of eggs, carnation milk, hot sauce, black pepper, and cream of mushroom sauce).  Then I baked the dish at 350° until done.  I also completed all the layers, except for the last two, the night before.  Then all I had to do in the morning was add the cheese and egg mixture and bake.  My family and I really enjoyed this recipe!!!

I made this for the office and everyone raved about it.  I added some other ingredients based on other reviewers' suggestions.  I added sauteed mushrooms and shredded hashbrowns with onions and peppers.  This was a big hit and I will definitely be making it again for my own family.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum!  I did cook for an extra 20 minutes because it looked runny in the middle.  Added some cheese to the mixture too and would even add more.  I will try onions next time too.  Overall, very delicious.

We made this to the letter, and it was pretty bland to me. I think if I made my own potatos, and spiced them & browned them, and added celery, onions & green peppper, it would be better, but I could do that in an omlette, served w/ home fries, and it would be done in less time. 

Not one we will be making again.

This was great.  The tater tots were a nice change from hashbrowns, and the mushroom soup gave it great flavor.  I added the mushrooms along with some onion and green pepper to the sausage while it cooked, and added salt and pepper too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used ground turkey, because I could not find turkey sausage. We had this for supper one night. I added two more eggs than the recipe called for, and a little more milk. I also used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, and the southern hasbrowns instead of the potato rounds. I thougt that it was a little dry, maybe next time I will add another can of soup and a little more milk. I also added seasoning salt onions, and pepper to the ground turkey as I was cooking it. You will need to cook this at a hight tempature than called for, or you will be waiting a very long time for it to be done.

This recipe was very good with a few changes.  I added chopped onion and green pepper during the last few minutes of cooking the sausage.  I also added the cheese to the mixture and additional on top.  I used the crispy crowns as I am not a fan of tater tots.  I would definately cut the potatoes down to 1/2 to 3/4 of a package.  It was very potatoey.  This was an easy casserole to throw together on Christmas morning - did take longer to bake.

I made this for the first time for my husband's staff at work for a breakfast celebration.  It was a hit and many asked for the recipe!  I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with onion and bell peppers.  I added 1/2 cup of cheese, salt, pepper and several dashes of green chili sauce into the mixture.  All of these alterations were suggested by other reviews and I believe they took the recipe from good to excellent.  My dish cooked perfectly at one hour and ten minutes.  I made the mixture the night before and in the morning, put potatoes in the pan and poured the mixture.  We took the advice of another review for keeping the dish warm while transporting.  We covered them with foil and then wrapped them in large bath towels.  I made two pans and my husband said it was almost two hours from leaving the house when they got to the second pan and it was still very warm!

Thank you Sue!  This is a yummy breakfast favorite.  The only thing I did differently was to defrost my potato rounds a bit before adding them to the casserole.  It makes a ton!

My husband served this outstanding casserole at an early morning tailgate for a Pitt Football Game.  People loved it!  Took some ideas from previous cooks, like adding 1/2 cup cheese to the mix before cooking, then adding another layer on top of casserole for the last 10-15 minutes. Sometimes needs additional cooking of 5-10 minutes.  Very filling!!

This casserole was delicous.  I used precooked ham instead of sausage.  I also waited to add the cheese until about half way through the cooking time.  Would also recommend cooking a bit longer.  This recipe was a hit with our guests!  Two of them even asked for a copy of the recipe.

This recipe was a huge hit with my guests.  I used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom.  I also used sausage in pound tube and made sure it was browned and separated into small pieces. The casserole turned out very flavorful!

I made this recipe but I used salsa like alot of other people did, I also added cooked and rumbled bacon, I also doubled up on the mushrooms, it still didn't have alot of flavor, I think next time I will add chopped and sauted onions and pepers. I think that is the extra kick it needs. But my kids and sister liked it, I also cooked it for an extra 10 minutes because it was a little runny in the middle.

Yummy, yummy!  Very easy to prepare. I would recommend preparing it the night before and in the morning just add the tater tots and pop it in the oven.  It definitely reduces stress in the morning!

WOW did I get a GREAT response from this one!  Even my biggest critics LOVED it!  I changed it up a bit.  I added some different sautteed vegetables and salsa to the egg mixture, and then I layered the casserole.  I started with a layer of tater tots on the bottom and continued with rotating layers of sausage, egg mixture and cheese!  Out of sight!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe, best assembled entirely the night before (that way the tater tots are not recognizable and the dish has better texture). I skip the cheese and it's great.  You can leave out the milk and it's takes half the cooking time, although it tastes better with the milk.

My family absolutely loved this dish! Five stars all the way. I made it for Christmas breakfast (w/ Monkey Bread - also a winner!) and it was a huge hit.  I used 16 oz. of chopped ham rather than sausage, and I think that the ham gave the recipe the extra salt that it needed. I also cooked it for an extra 15 minutes or so because the center of the dish took a little extra time to set. I'll definitely make this again.

I used hot and spicy sausage to spice it up!  Everyone loved it.
Note the second occurence of  the word 'milk' should be 'mushrooms'.

So very bland and driy-even after I added herbs and seasonings and a whole chopped onion. Ended up having to add more seasoning and a lil milk in to make less dry.

Sooo Yummy!!! I made a few changes though...I only had 9 eggs but added a tiny bit more milk. I also would recommend thawing the potatoes. I used ore-Ida shredded potatoes because that's what I had on hand. I also didn't have mushrooms but used onion & green pepper sautéed in the hot sausage left over oil (not a lot but good). Also took much longer than 50 mins, prob an extra 20. I also had a mixture of shredded cheeses that I mixed on top! All in all my fiancé LOVED IT & I can't wait to eat it for breakfast!

This was really good and I don't usually like breakfast casseroles.  There were too many potatoes so I'd cut back on that and also season the potatoes.  I used frozen hash browns that I defrosted in the frig overnight.  Next time I would mix the potatoes with the cream of mushroom soup, layer spinach, then top with the eggs/sausage mixture seasoned with a little onion power and red pepper flakes.

This recipe was ok - the end result was kind of oily though. It was also kind of wet. I didn't add the whole amount of potatoes - maybe that is why.
Overall not bad but could have had some additions to improve flavor and texture.

So so good! My entire family loved it. I didn't have sausage so I used left over deli ham and salami. I added some sauteed onions. I reduced the eggs to 10 with 1 c milk. I only had large tater tots and it was fine. i only had about a half of bag though and it was plenty. It was a nice "garbage" casserole.

I have never made a breakfast casserole before and this one is a good one! I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes to the recipe, which turned out wonderful. I used tater tots and baked them according to their directions at the bottom of the casserole first, added some fat free shredded cheese to the tater tot layer to help them stick together once cooked. Then I layered with sausauge, another layer of mushrooms, and then topped it with the eggs which I added more fat free shredded cheese, garlic and onion powder and salt and pepper. It needed to bake for a good hour and a half, but was worth the wait!

This recipe was fabulous! It was hard for me to keep my husband from eating the entire casserole!  I made a few improvements which I think made it very flavorful.  First I sauteed some onion and garlic in olive oil, then cooked sweet italian (turkey) sausage with the garlic and onion.  I also substituted the condensed cream of mushroom soup for greek yogurt, and added 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of ground mustard.  (I also thought 32oz of potatoes was A LOT; I only used ~16oz.)  Thanks for the recipe :)

Made it exactly as the recipe said..bland, bland, bland. Needs considerable amount of flavors (spices, jalapeno bits, etc) added to make it better.

I made this for a work event and it came out pretty good, but only after I followed the advice of other reviewers.  I used sage breakfast sausage and sauteed with onions and green bell peppers and added fresh mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms.  I also added 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese within the egg mixture.  Instead of the potato rounds, I used hash browns and used half of the bag instead of all 32 oz.  I baked for 1 hour, added the cheddar on top, and then baked for another 10 minutes.  I would make it again, but I'll try hot sausage next time and some kind of seasoned hash browns for more of a kick.

As others suggested did layered approach: meat, used southwest style hash browns, cheese and then topped with egg mixture (left out the mushrooms) and it was excellent. Will definitely make again.

I ate this casserole at a friend's house in Charleston and I thought it was great! I watched him make it so I don't know the exact  measurements he used, but I think he used ten eggs and one cup of milk. I know he sauteed onions with the sausage and then sauteed fresh mushrooms (instead of canned mushrooms, yuck)in the same pan. He used a bag of refrigerated Simply Potatoes hashbrowns and I think that sounds like a better form of potato to use than the frozen round hashbrowns. He also added a can of Rotel tomatoes that provided the necessary "kick" that this casserole needed. He just mixed all this together right in the pan and baked it for about an hour and it was great!

Love this recipe!  It has become a family favorite and a Christmas tradition. The only change I have made is I add about 1 cup of cheese to the egg mixture.  When I prepare this the day before I cook the casserole for about an hour and then add cheese.

This was just ok. Can't quite put my finger on it, but something is missing...it's awfully bland. If I make this again I'll experiment with onions, hot sauce...something!

This was a very yummy recipe! My husband even loved it and he is pretty picky! I added some green and red peppers along with some green onion since I had some in the fridge. I didn't measure the cheese that I added on as we like a lot of cheese. It took a bit longer for the casserole to bake before adding the cheese. Will definately make this dish again!

great recipe, but i also made a lot of changes.  wonderful for a potluck!  to serve 12, i used up almost an entire 1kg bag of taters, most of which placed on the bottom of the pan, and some of it placed in between the various layers.  so, 1 layer of taters, 1 layer of cooked sausage/onion (added some pork seasoning to this), a layer of sauteed fresh mushrooms (doubled the amount) /onion/dried basil, followed by a layer of red pepper, another (thin) layer of taters, poured egg mixture all over, topped that with green onions, generous amount of cheese (doubled what the recipe called for).  and finally a sprinkling of paprika.  after baking for an hour, i added a bit more cheese and baked for 10 more minutes. the flavouring was perfect!

I made this for vegetarian friends, so substituted an equal weight of black beans for the sausage. I added cayenne pepper, black pepper, paprika, and salt to make up for the flavor from the sausage that would be missing. It was a huge hit! The potato chunks break down so it looks like they were mixed in from scratch. Yummy and much healthier than many other b'fast casseroles.

This is a keeper!  I made it for a breakfast potluck at work-came out excellent.  Like the others I add a few things-diced onion and bell pepper.  Instead of Cream of Mush, I add Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic, and instead of milk I used half and half.  I could not find potato rounds, so I used southern style potatoes.  Will definitely do this again.

Love this recipe!  It is our standard Xmas morning breakfast.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I threw in sauted onion, red pepper and green pepper.  Next time I'll do the same, as well as the mushrooms.  I also used slightly less of the frozen potatoes, turned out perfectly!

Was just ok; used pre-fried tater tots (because that's what I had lying around) and that may have contributed to the grease factor of this recipe. It seemed waterty just out of the oven but it thickened up upon standing. Served it for a christmas brunch with my family. My guests said it was good but I think they were just trying to make me feel better.

After reading other reviews, very disappointing. Bland taste, even with hot sausage, fresh mushrooms, sauteed onions,  and garlic roasted mushroom soup. Family agreed, casserole lacked taste and texture was not appealing.

Good, but a little on the bland side for my taste. I used cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic soup and O'Brien potatoes and Jimmy Dean hot sausage; added green onions and 1/2 can diced green chiles, but I still felt like it needed some salsa or something to wake it up.  Everyone at the office enjoyed it, though, so it's probably just my palate.

OK - I've read all the reviews and have no idea what "10.75 oz can milk" is. No one mentioned it in the reviews. Is this referring to evaporated milk, regular milk, condensed milk... Plan on making this for father's Day and need some idea as to what this refers to.

I made this recipe exactly as described but added some chives that I had in the fridge that needed to be used.I did have to increase the baking time to 1 hr and 15 minutes. Turned out absolutely fabulous. It was moist & had a nice crust on the edges. Very very tasty!!! Will make again. Thank you for a great recipe.

5 stars, really?  This was mediocre at best.  Quite bland and non-descript.  I made 2 of these following the recipe exactly.  I had a brunch for 16 ppl.  Nobody raved or even told me it was good.  1 guest asked for ketchup and another asked for Tobasco!  I think I will go back to my regular recipe for breakfast casserole.  Sorry!

I have made this many times and have only gotten good reviews.  The only thing that I think would make it better is seasoning the potatoes a little before hand with season salt or something similar.   Thanks for a great recipe!

I've had lots of breakfast casseroles, but this is sooo good! The texture with the cream of mushroom soup is unbelievable. YUM! Been making this for special occasions and sleepy Sundays in.

I hate not giving more than 3 stars, but I have to be honest and say I really didn't care for this breakfast casserole, but I should have known better about not adding in salt or pepper...I THINK that the eggs definitely need a splash of it.

This was so good, and EASY. The only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms that I had sauted in butter and garlic. Served for company and they asked for the recipe. VERY good.

Fantastic!!!! I made this casserole for our traditional Memorial Day brunch when the small town parade passes by our house and family and friends gather. My son said " I can't stop eating this stuff". I doubled the recipe and poured the cheese over the top, kind of pushing it down in before baking. Things were hectic and I had not thawed the tater tots, so it took about an hour and a 1/2 or more to bake, but it came out beautiful, not watery as some have suggested. I think you just have to give it time if you use frozen potatoes. This is will be our new "family breakfast" for all holidays.

This is a good recipe, but is lacking a little something.  I would suggest using spicy instead of regular sausage and increasing the amount of sausage used.  Also, adding onions and peppers would likely do wonders to this dish.  It was very good, though, and heated up very nicely for the next few days.

I added turkey sausage, bacon, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and lots of cheese and it turned out great. I did add two more eggs to make sure there was enough to cook over all the veggie's.

I mistakenly made this the night before like other breakfast casseroles, but it was still tasty-the tater tots seemed to break apart so there were little pieces of potato throughout.  Good flavor-some garlic or additional seasonings would be great.

This was pretty good; I consider it a variation of Tater Tot Casserole.  I really liked the use of tater tots, as they are one of my favorite kinds of potatoes.  However, I felt the recipe needed the addition of some sort of spices, and I was very hesitant about adding salt because of the sodium content of the ingredients already being used.  Next time I make it I may add some pepper, or some chopped onion or garlic, to see if that livens the recipe up a bit.  Also, one minor alteration I made was to shred 2 cups of Cheddar cheese so there would be enough to cover the casserole in a 13"x9" pan.

Like other reviewers, I added to the recipe. I followed the directions but also added green peppers, onions, some Delmonte Diced tomatoes (drained), and extra cheese. I didn't have potato rounds so I substituted them for tater tots. I must say this was a great caserole. My family likes lots of ingredients so based on other reviewers stating that this recipe was somewhat blah, I decided to add alot. The cream of mushroom soup gives it a really good flavor and a good texture...not too dry. This recipe gives a good base to creating your own concoction! Also, I agree that cooking time is a bit more than stated so leave time for that. Will make again!

I made this today for a breakfast farewell to my boss. WOW! It was a BIG hit and gone fast! It was easy to carry for my 1-1/2 hour trip. A fellow employee made another version and this one was gone first. It was creamy and the ingredients all went well together. I will make this again and keep in my favorites. Thanks

YUMMY!  I opted for a veggie version----I used Gimme Lean veggie sausage (just broke up a tube and sauteed it in olive oil with diced onions and zucchini....next time I will add spinach too).  I also added a tsp. of hot sauce, a tsp. of italian seasoning and a 1/2 tsp. salt since the prior reviews said this dish can sometimes be bland. I let it sit overnight in the fridge and it took about an hour and 15 minutes to cook this morning.  My carnivore hubby loved it!  Lots of options here...it can be a "kitchen sink" dish, so feel free to use what you have on hand.

I love this recipe!  I have made this many times with many variations.  I have added different veggies and meats, also I have used cream of chicken instead of mushroom becuase of my picky husband.  The only thing I would say is to cook this longer, I think it takes over an hour to get a good consistancy, but its great for a breakfast, or even dinner!

This was a great recipe as is.  However, my husband doesn't like mushrooms, so I leave them out.  We've tried several variations some of our favorites are:adding more cheese into casserole, adding ham, using the tater tots, potato rounds and hash browns for the potato.  We have this about 2x/month for Sunday brunch.

Great recipe- only changes I had to make were using Zesty Hot sausage, and instead of the potato rounds I used one 28 oz. pkg of potatoes o'brien. That is all I had in the house. I appreciated having the choice of overnight refrigeration or not. I was looking for a recipe to use with things I had in the house and this fit the bill (with the exception of the potatoes)
It turned out delicious and I'll make this again!

I was so excited to try this because it looked so yummy. But the end result was less than spectacular. We are an egg and sausage family so I thought this would be a big hit but I must have done something wrong - it came out very dry, bland and potatoey. I will try it again but will season the potatoes and put them on the bottom of the pan. I will also add salt & pepper to the eggs, and maybe will add more milk or perhaps a milk and butter mixture to moisten and add flavor.

This breakfast casserole was so tasty!  It was very easy to make and left very few dishes to clean up.  I brought the dish to work for a pot luck and everyone kept commenting on how good it was and a few asked for the recipe.  I used frozen country style hash browns instead of potato rounds.

A little too bland for my tastes as is.  Took a lot longer to cook.  It's a good recipe to start from, but you will need to add to it, depending on what your tastes are.  We added bacon, bell pepper, fresh mushrooms and instead of potato rounds added southern hashbrowns.  I think I will keep looking for a better breakfast casserole.

My husband suggested we do the delicious 'Wife Saver' breakfast that our daughter usually does for Christmas mornings, but I wanted that to remain as her Christmas breakfast, so I did up this instead..well..I hit it big again! I did tho try to cut the fat where I could..1/2 fat soup, fewer whole eggs...more egg whites, turkey sausage and light cheddar cheese. I will do this many, many times in the future.

I have made this 3x and each time people have loved it and have asked for the recipe.  It's a great recipe for a breakfast potluck or for a large family.  Cut it in half if it's for people less than 6.  Thanks for a great recipe Sue!

I made this 2 years ago for a work function and STILL get requests for the recipe.  It was a big hit and extremely easy to make.  I did bake the casserole 10-15 minutes longer than directed and added some green onion.

I gave it four stars b/c I had to change it up a bit before I really loved it. With modifications, it's to die for. I doubled the amount of sausage, using half hot, half regular, and I also added a couple more eggs. Instead of potato rounds, I used the crowns (the flatter disc-shaped oned), b/c it seemed like there was just too much concentrated potato with the bigger rounds. I also added cheese into the mixture. Next time I might try somebody else's idea of using the onion tater tots.

This was a wonderful casserole.  Like some others, I fried some diced onion up with the sausage, and then layered everything before pouring the egg and soup mixture over everything.  Mine was completely cooked and set up after an hour, and was not in the least bit mushy.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  It was really tasty and the texture was perfect.

I used sage flavored sausage and O'Brien frozen potatoes which I browned in the pan of sausage 
drippings.  Added garlic and onion powder, salt,
pepper, and l/2 c. cheese to the mixture.  Hubby
said it was good and had seconds (but he poured green Tabasco sauce over it).

This recipe was okay. It didn't really have a lot of flavor and was kind of dry. The pork sausage was the redeeming factor, without that it would have been a bust.

I am on a diet so I used reduced fat sausage, egg beaters and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and it was still delicious! I can't imagine what it tastes like with the "real" ingredients! I would however beat the eggs a little longer so they get fluffier and less dense.

This recipe received rave reviews from an office full of women.  Who ever heard of cream of mushroom soup in eggs??  This recipe is a real keeper.  I added 1/2 can of sour cream to the eggs and canadian bacon with the sausage and sprinkled greed onions on the top after cooking, everyone loved it.  Thanks to the orginator!!!!!

This was a big hit Christmas morning, although I modified the recipe a bit.  Skipped the tater tots and added 4 slices of cubed toast instead.  I only used 9 eggs, and was afraid the soup would make it too runny, so I just used 2 cups of milk.  Added onions and green/red peppers for some additional flavor and color and used shredded monterey jack & cheddar cheese, which I also sprinkled on the top about 5 minutes before it finished cooking.  This was really filling... didn't really need the pancakes and toast I also served -- but at least everybody was full till dinner! :-)

This was very good, but a little bland. Next time I will add some crushed red pepper, salt, and black pepper to spice it up and probably will not use the whole bag of tater tots - it had lots of potatoes. It was a big hit, though, and I will make it again with a few revisions!

My family really enjoyed this casserole. I thought the flavors mixed together were excellent. I did not follow the recipe exactly based on suggestions from others that tried this recipe. I used sage sausage (added some garlic and onion powder), left out the mushrooms (yuck), added white onion, green peppers (sauteed) and it was a big hit. My husband also added a hint of hot sauce to his before he ate it and said it was delicious and that it gave it an extra kick.

I was a little concerned about using tater tots but they came out great.  I did what someone suggested and made it the night before and just added the tots and cheese the next morning.  I also added some ham to give it extra flavor.  I cut the recipe in half but cooked it for the whole time...we loved it...it was even good the next day.

I made this exactly according to the directions and thought it had a little too much egg and not quite enough potato.  If I do it again I'm going to cut back on the eggs and use more tater tots.  It was pretty good, though and my family seemed to enjoy it.

I made this for my work group and it was a hit!  I used mild turkey sausage cooked with 
seasoning and chili powder.  Also used Ore Ida Onion Tator Tots and accompanied
the casserole with a bottle of Tobasco sauce for those who like more kick.  A very easy
and adaptable recipe.

This made a great and easy breakfast.  I had company, so I assembled the casserole the night before, and popped it in the oven in the morning.  It took a little longer to bake than expected though.

I made this recipe for "Treat Day" at my office. I used bacon in one casserole and sausage in the other. It was a major hit absolutely everyone wanted the recipe!!!! PS The bacon was the favorite. Next time I think I will add onions for a little different flavor. Thanks again

I couldn't find potato crowns (flatter, larger diameter) so I used tater tots (longer, narrower) which are the basically the same thing. My casserole baked for the full 50 min, plus additional 10 for melting the cheese. I did not thaw the tater tots and it turned out perfect. Now that I have "tested" the recipe, I will most likely add onion, garlic, and bell pepper while browning the sausage and will probably have to extend the cooking time by 5 min. since onions and peppers have a lot of water in them. I will also top with more cheese or add cheese to the mix or both.

Deelish! I sautéed onions and red bell peppers and added with the sausage. I also layered as others did: tots, sausage, onions/peppers, egg mixture.  It sat in the fridge over night and I baked it the next morning.

This is a great recipe!  I made it the first couple times exactly as stated and it is delicious.  Now I experiment with different sausages, soups, and potatoes.  Great everytime!  I love the original recipe with a bit of salsa on top!!

Soooo...I turned this into something completely different but used this recipe as my base.  I used cheddar chs soup instead of the cream of mushroom.  I sauted garlic, little sweet peppers and onions and threw in 1/2 cup of steamed broc.  I threw in 1/4 cup each of parm chs and pepperjack chs into the egg base mixture cause that is what I had.  Used a bacon saus mixture and hashbrowns instead of the potatoe rounds...great mix of flavors with some hidden veggies in it, egg, dairy, yum!!!

Excellent!  It was so popular last year at Christmas brunch that I am making it again this year.  An easily assembled recipe, the cook time is dead on.  Just a great recipe all around.

This dish has all the right ingredients, but it is entirely too heavy on the stomach. Even w/ a consideral amount of tweaking, it still left a lot to be desired. ts one of those that looks great on paper, but not so much once cooked.

My husband is a low carb eater, so he did not like this.  He likes the egg and sausage casseroles with very few carbs added.  This is a HUGE recipe, and yes, I did eat most of it myself!  I had the hot/spicy sausage on hand and loved that in this.  Very nice casserole that goes together quickly for last minute brunch guests.  Great for large families--flavors most children will eat.  2 thumbs up!

Absolutely fantastic!  I only used 10 eggs because I wanted the sausage to be more dense.  I also added salt, pepper, sage, and Italian seasoning to the egg mixture.  I used tator tots instead of hashbrowns.  Was a hit with all my kids!  Will definitely make again and again!

I tried this for our Sunday breakfast, with all the mixed reviews wasn't for sure how it would be but sounded good. It was.... I didn't have any condensed milk and added a little red pepper to sausage while browning but other than that followed recipe. I did put the tater tots on top so they would brown instead of getting mushy and that worked well, and added some little chunks of Velveeta cheese on top for last 10 minutes. Would make again...

I have been looking for a breakfast casserole that can be made the night before and cooked the next morning.  This is the only one I have tried that I will be making over and over.    My son doesn't like sausage so next time I'll try another meat.  Also, I will add a good amount of cheese to the mixture before it is baked so that it is all through the casserole (and not cheddar because it doesn't have the flavor I am looking for and is too stringy) instead of just on top. Last change will be some onions that are cooked along with the meat.    The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I like it better with my additions.

Very bland and dry. I followed the recipe to the letter. Perhaps putting the cheese (and much more of it) in with the eggs instead of on top would add some creaminess to it. I won't be using this recipe again.

This is good. It's a remaker, although it's missing a certain flavor that I haven't figured out yet. I did add the sauteed onions and mushrooms to the dish, but it needs a spice. It depends on your personal taste but I say it needs some cajun spice. Or just some salt and pepper. It needs something.

This was a great recipe.  I did have to cook it for about 15 minutes longer than called for or I would have given it 5 stars.  Everyone agreed that it would benefit from some diced green peppers and maybe a little bit of diced sweet onions but I'd make it again just like it is!

I made this for a friend's family and didn't get to taste it, but it smelled and looked wonderful!  I sauteed half an onion with the sausage and left out the can of mushrooms...oh, I also added some cheese, salt, and pepper to the egg mixture.  Layered the tater tots, sausage, then eggs.  Will definitely make again, this time for me!

I love this recipe! I have made it many times and have tried a few different variations. My favorite so far has been using bacon instead of sausage. I have also added salsa to the mix before and brought it to a potluck and it was gone in a flash and went over big. Thanks!

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and layered it instead of mixing it together.  I dont think that made a difference. I think it could have used more sausage and cheese, and I never use canned mushrooms.  Other than that it was delicious.

I wanted to like this more than I did.  I do prefer potatoes instead of bread in a breakfast casserole..it's a texture thing.  However, the recipe as is was a bit bland and pretty dry.  Perhaps a few more eggs and a little more kick?  I did not see anyone else comment on dryness, so maybe I over baked it (I have a phobia of undercooked egg casseroles...again the texture thing).

I made this recipe for Easter brunch and got rave reviews. It truly was phenomenal! I layered the tator-rounds in the bottom of the baking dish. It actually made a full layer and then I spaced out the remaining rounds on a second layer. I whisked the eggs and milk together and then added the remaining ingredients (including the sausage) to the egg mixturem, then dumped over the potato rounds. I will make this dish over and over again!

This was very good. Everyone went back for seconds and thirds. I followed the advise of another reviewer by layering the potatoes, cooked sausage, mushrooms, red pepper, cheeses then poured the egg mixture over it.

I made this for a church brunch and it was a huge hit.  While I was putting this together late Saturday night, I realized that the only canned milk that I had was sweet condensed.  It have a strange sweetness to it, but it was still excellent and received many compliments, and the kids loved it.  Thanks!

It was good! I followed the recipe as it is- but I used regular hash browns instead of 'rounds'. I'm not sure if I used the right thing,but next time I will use the tater tots, it will provide some needed 'crunch'.

This recipe was delicious and easy.  I did it christmas morning for my family and I actually put it together christmas eve before going to bed.  I changed out the potatoe rounds for tater-tots although I am sure the rounds would have been great.  Everyone at the table asked for the recipe!

I made this the low-fat way.  I used the recipe for italian turkey sausage for the sausage (modified with a few other herbs) and used a 50/50 mix of egg beater eggs and regular eggs.  Nobody could tell that it was low fat and it was delicious.  What leftovers were left were even better as the flavors really blended well.

I was worried that my casserole wasn't done after the time alloted.  It was a little runny in the middle.  After taking it out of the oven, I mixed everything together (which made my tater tots fall apart).  Within 5 minutes, it was done.  Next time I'll just put the potatoes in first and pour all the mixture on top.  Hopefully, the potatoes will thicken the eggs quicker. It was really delicious and a huge hit!!!

Excellent!!   My group loved it on our last camping weekend.  It does take a little longer to cook than the directions say.  Althought everyone loved the taste, the eggs could have been a little more cooked through.

I made this for my husband and some friends and they loved it!!!  I made the recipe as is but I might play with it a little next time.  My husband thought some peppers and onions would be good!  I did think it needed a little seasoning but other than that the recipe was great just as it is.  The eggs were nice and light and the potato rounds and sausage added nice texture.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

Delicious!!  I even made this ahead of time and froze it and it still turned out great (thawed completely before I baked it).  Can't wait to make again.

I am only giving this four stars because, as written, I don't think I would have liked it much.  My family might have but not me.  I made it with 2 packages of sausage, hashbrowns with the peppers and onions added, some spices, and no mushrooms.  I also used cream of chicken because i like it better than mushroom.  i suppose it is a completely different recipe but the basic idea was great.  I just need more kick to my food than this would have given.  excellent base though!  Thank you!

Quite good!!  Cooking time was quite off for me, I had to add about 20 mins to it and I was using convection which usually speeds things up! I thought the flavour was really good, but my brunch guests added quite a bit of salt and pepper, so maybe its a little lacking in that respect.  Made the recipe exactly as stated except subbed light cheese instead of regular to save a few calories.  Overall, a very good recipe. Will make again! Thanks.

The first time I tried this recipe I followed it to a "T" and found it to be a good base recipe but liked some changes better.  The second time I switched it up a bit using 1lb sausage and 1 lb beef, oyester mushrooms, and sour cream rather than milk.  Depending on your taste, you may like the changes.

We thought it was bland. Mushy eggs and potatoes all mixed together with pieces of sausage and a mushroom here or there. It was edible and we finished the casserole but will not make again.  
I thought too many eggs. 
Its a matter of preference and I like the breakfast casseroles that taste more like stuffing.

This was very good, even my husband enjoyed it and he doesn't like to try new things. Next time I think I will omit the cream of mushroom; it was a little overpowering. Also I did need to prolong the cooking time to 1 hr. Thanks for the idea.

It was okay.  It was a little bland for my taste.  I even added dry mustard, sharp cheddar, pepper and sauted the onions and fresh mushroom.  If I make again, I'll add more seasoning.

This was a good recipe.  We have made egg casseroles before so this one wasnt much different from the others but I must say the kids loved it.  I included Garlic Powder and a bit of salt could have been added also.  The end result would have been a bit on the bland side id say had I not created the seasoning mixtures.

This was ok..very filling!! And made a ton..we ate on it for a few days and made breakfast tacos with tortillas. 
I felt pretty greasy after eating this so I probably won't make it again.
It would be good for a big group brunch though.

This just didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped it would. It was a little bland.  It was ok - but just ok.  I'm glad I tried it just to try it, but it's not something I'll make again.  The way to tell a good dish in my house:  If it all gets eaten - this didn't.  We threw about 1/2 of it away.

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  I was so excited to try it but didn't turn out like I expected.  Something about the way the eggs cooked, I don't know.  The sausage was wonderful, we love anything with breakfast sausage.  I have had cream of mushroom with eggs before and liked it.  If you try this recipe, I would definitely use no milk, or less milk.  It tasted kind of "wet".  Sorry.

REALLY wonderful.  I made it for the first time the night before Christmas, and we had it for brunch the next morning.  I took all the suggestions--added bacon and sauteed fresh mushrooms, etc.  It was really fabulous--just what I was looking for!

We thought there was just too many potato rounds and too much liquid, texture not good.

I FOUND THIS RECIPE EXCELLENT FOR BRINGING TO MY BUSY FRIENDS WITH YOUNG FAMILIES. BAKE IN DISPOSABLE BAKEWARE AND MAKE TWO AT A TIME. SINCE YOUNGER CHIDREN PERFER THE MILD TURKEY SAUSAGE, I SUGGEST THAT THE ADULTS USE SALSA AS A CONDIMENT TO SPICE IT UP THEIR SERVING. GREAT FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCH OR DINNER.

This is our Christmas breakfast casserole - for the last 2 years!  I've used Hormel Bacon Crumbles with onions - and even Chorizo and Green Chilies - whatever I have in the frig!  Made the night before - it is so easy to just pop in the oven on Christmas morning.  I've made it for brunch - and received plenty of compliments!

I made this for a brunch bday party for my daughter.  It was very yummy and time-saving.  Since it was for young kids, I only added a few onions and no peppers (though when I make it at home, I certainly will) as previous reviewers suggested.  Also as per previous reviews, I did add the cheese right to the casserole.  This took and hour and 40 minutes to cook.  Be sure to drain your sausage well, my partner didn't do that for one and it seemed to take longer to cook.  This is a keeper!  (Be sure to add salt and pepper to your taste before cooking!)  :)

This was great.  I made it the night before with skim milk, half fat soup, light cheese and discarded half of the egg yolks. I baked it for a little longer (I thought it might be soupy) but it turned out fabulously.  It was a hit with the whole family.

Added salt and pepper as advised by previous reviewer and it tasted just GREAT.  It's almost like a "potato frittata" -  was great for a church brunch potluck.  I would definetely make it again.

This was a easy recipe to follow and it lends itself to modification really well. I personally was looking for a breakfast casserole I could make with potatoes because I had a lot of JoJos (from the deli) left over. I subbed the JoJos for the Tater Tots, and the recipe turned out great!

This was my first time making a breakfast casserole.  I couldn't believe how simple it was to make.  I added more mushrooms in place of the sausage because my husband doesn't eat meat and it came out delicious!!  This is a recipe I will make over and over again.

Not bad but not great either.  It didn't have quite enough flavor.  Maybe salt should one of the ingredients.  I also didn't like the cream of mushroom soup.  It made the casserole a little to mushy for my liking.

This was fun to make. I sauteed fresh mushrooms with onions in olive oil instead of canned mushrooms. I served this at a brunch and it was well received.

We loved this easy to make casserole!  I assembled the casserole the night before.  The next morning I added the tator tots and cheese and cooked it.  We covered it, wrapped it in a big towel and took it to work where it was nice and hot.  Instead of mushrooms, I used green peppers and although everyone gave us compliments at work some people said they did not care for green peppers.  Next time I make it for a large group of people, I will make it very plain (no vegetables).  For my family, we like the works!  Thanks for the recipe and thanks everybody for the "tips and substitutions" on this recipe.

This is an excellent dish.  I baked it early in the AM and took it on the road with us in a covered casserole dish and wrapped in a towel.  An hour later it was still steaming hot and although the cheese looked a little funny it was very tasty!

I thought this was great.  I made it the night before and added the tater tots in the morning before putting in the oven.  Next time I will use hot sausage.  Would like to see a recipe that uses fresh potatoes, instead of tots.

A very easy and comforting breakfast/brunch or emergency dinner recipe. Add green pepper and/or fresh mushrooms or even sauteed onions for variety. Kids will love this recipe without the mushrooms. A great dish for the frantic holidays.

I cooked this "casserole" for a brunch at work.  It was an instant hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  It held well overnight and cooked in exactly the time alloted in the recipe.  I made a few changes in the original recipe, leaving out the mushrooms and mushroom soup and adding green and red pepper for color.  Instead of the mushroom soup, I used cream of celery. I also used half egg substitute and half eggs, as well as turkey sausage, to lower the fat content. This is a great recipe to "build" however the occaision presents.

I make this for my family every Christmas!  We substitute turkey sausage and add onions and peppers to the egg mixture, plus some pepper, but otherwise follow the recipe to a “t.”  It’s a huge hit with everyone.

I made it with no meat (vegitarian friends) and about 3/4 of  the bag of diced potatos.I defrosted potatos first.  Did what others suggested with sauteed peppers onions and fresh mushrooms.  I probably could have seasoned more but overall really good and easy!    The first breakfast cassorole I made that wasnt a disaster!  Thanks:)

MElted 1/4c butter in baking dishes in oven until slightly brown.  Added sprinkle of garlic salt and lots of black pepper to taste.  Diced red and/or russet for stronger potato flavor and coated with the butter mix.  (Husband hates the Taste or lack of taste of frozen potatoes). Baked for 20 minutes.  Mixed cooked sausage, cup or so of roasted peppers, 16 oz cottages cheese, red pepper flakes to taste, can of cream of mushroom, no milk and 12 eggs and 1 C sharp cheddar.  Poured over cooked potatoes and cooked another 50 min.  Thought milk would make it too runny.  Came out great, husband reheats three mornings in a row for breakfast.  Reheats well.

This was delicious! Like others, I was concerned about using mushroom soup in this, but it added great flavor to the casserole. I added sauteed red bell pepper, onion, and fresh mushrooms, all seasoned with black pepper, salt, parsley, garlic. Also, I used diced hash brown potatoes (seasoned with garlic, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and parsley) which I pan fried in a little olive oil for about 10 minutes prior to baking. This helped with texture. Lastly, I used layers: potatoes, sausage and veggies, cheese, repeat. The egg mixture was poured over the entire casserole and then topped with more cheese. Baked it for about 1 hr 10 min (covered for 20 minutes during that time) and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Served with salsa. It was delicious! Thanks for this great recipe!

Loved it made some adjustments sautéed onions, green/red peppers, and fresh mushrooms. Used potato rounds and browned them in the oven first. Layered the casserole first layer of potatoe rounds, poured egg over, sprinkled some cheese, layered the sausage, onion, peppers, and mushrooms, poured rest of egg over, and topped with rest of potatoe rounds. Baked in oven for 1 hour. Top with cheese over individual servings in case you freeze servings and microwave. I find microwaving the casserole with cheese cooked on top of the casserole originally makes the casserole greasy. Next time I think I am going to use cream of mushroom soup with garlic for extra seasoning.

It was OK, but I won’t make it again. The only change I made was to eliminate the mushrooms since my kids won’t eat them. It wasn’t very flavorful and was A LOT of tater tots.

This is really good.  I used ground chicken sausage and browned with minced onion and garlic.  Added ground sage and threw in fresh mushrooms.  Used skim milk and lowfat cream of mushroom soup.  Added frozen potato rounds. 
 Sprinkled paprika on top and baked for a full hour.  Added one cup of shredded cheddar cheese and baked five minutes more.  Very tasty.  This is a recipe you could experiment with spices, different meats and cheeses.

This is a family favorite that has turned into a family tradition. My husband and children absolutely love when I make this and have come to expect it on Easter and Christmas mornings. I mostly follow the recipe, but I sauté green pepper, onion, mushroom, and garlic wth the sausage. I grease the baking dish and add the potatoes, then the sausage/vegetables. I mix the cheese in with the eggs/milk/soup, add salt and pepper and pour over top of everything in the casserole dish. Bake for 55 minutes and let sit for 10.

I have been making this for at least a couple of years! Its delicious. Its great as is, make sure you use the crown tots...they are flatter. I have seen people adding condensed milk...it calls for condensed cream of mushroom soup and regular milk. I have replaced the can of mushrooms with fresh baby Bella mushrooms. I have also added an additional cup of cheese. Its hearty and a big hit at home. I make it for hubby and friends when they go on their man camping trips. I also just make it because its a weekend lol! Perfect to make ahead and if you're lucky can have it for leftovers the next day ;)

Served for a family brunch and everyone loved it.  I used fresh potatoes that were sauteed with onions , garlic and parsley instead of the potatoes circles.  I also used monterey cheese and cheddar cheese.

I make this often when I have large groups of people coming for breakfast. I love that you can make the night before and just put in the oven in the morning. The recipe is just fine as is but I usually add other ingredients that I may have on hand, such as red or green pepper or spinach. I also add a little more cheese on the top and cook it until the cheese is nice and brown. Enjoy!

This has become a regular in our house! And a wonderful meal to make with the kids! My son loves to make this with me and it's so simple he's even memorized the ingredients! We love this by itself or even served with tortilla shells like a burrito! I do sometimes use an extra package of sausage, and spices!

I thought this was bland.  I would use spicy sausage, definitely cut the amount of potatoes to about 1/2, add some sauteed onion and salt and pepper. I felt like I was eating mostly potatoes in each bite and didn't taste any egg. It was good, but could be much better with some tweaking!

I made this for co-workers.  They raved about it.  The only things I changed were to add some onions and peppers to the sausage.  I also layered the potatoes and sausage mixture alternately in the pan.

I thought this was a great recipe.  It was very easy.  Yes, you could add items to it but I used the recipe exactly as stated.  I put the casserole together the evening before and then cooked the casserole in the morning.  I used the rounds as stated but would try the tater tots next time because they were cheaper.  It makes a lot and sets up nicely (unlike some egg casserole's that have liquid on the bottom). Personally, the mushrooms tasted canned in this recipe, so I might go with onion next time.  Also, if you are making more than one pan, I would put the rounds/tater tots in the pan and then pour the remaining items on top.

The kids and I liked it but felt it needed something, maybe onion & green pepper mentioned by other reviewers? I added bacon to ours which was good.  This wasn't my husband's favorite, but he doesn't like sausage so that is to be expected.  I may try again using ham instead.

Everyone liked it. I did modify a bit to make healthier. I used ham in place of sausage, half egg beaters and half eggs, low fat crm of mushroom soup, skim milk, 2% cheese. Added some seasoning salt and garlic for some added flavor!

I have a similar recipe to this one and I put in more eggs dozen to 18 eggs that are softly scrambled.  I add 2 cans of soup cream of celery, and cream of chicken.  I saute mushrooms instead along with onions.  I use hashbrown bite size potatoes or you can use potato "obrien".  You add a can of milk (meaning fill up the empty soup can with 1% or 2% milk. Very good! I use left overs from a spiral sliced ham, bacon or sausage.  All are good! Great recipe! Use Ham and left over grilled asparagus in the casserole for a Easter or Mother's Day breakfast!

I thought this was pretty good - although, I'm not sure it was worth the cholestorol and caolorie intake.  Worth the intake for Xmas and the few days follwoing.  Thought it could have looked prettier - but easy, and tasty!

This was a very good recipe, but I was confused about the can of milk. I didn't find a 10.75 oz can of any sort of milk, but I guessed it was evaporated milk and that seemed to work fine. It was very easy to prepare and people went back for seconds!

This is a great tasting recipe. I left out the mushrooms. Used frozen potatoes o'brien and 2 cups of cheese. 1 cup mixed in the ingredients and 1 cup on top. I also put onion in with my sausage when browning sausage. Will make again.

This is a wonderful brunch dish - very tasty as is, or you can add onions or peppers if you like it spicier.  I got rave reviews when I served it and it's now my favorite breakfast casserole.  Being able to mix it up the night before is SOOOO handy!

I made this for breakfast on Thanksgiving morning.  I mixed in 1/2 of the cheese into the egg mixture and added the other half to the top for the last 15 minutes of baking.  I used a 32 oz bag of the hash brown cubes instead of tater tots.  Be sure you are serving a small army - this makes a ton (served 6 adults and 6 teenage kids and there was a little left over).  It received tons of compliments, even by the ones who don't like eggs. I do think next time, I'll use the southern style hash browns for more punch.  Great versatile recipe.

With a few minor changes this recipe is PERFECT.  Thawed the tots and put them in my baking dish in a 350 degree oven while I cooked the sausage.  I added a whole bag of frozen stirfry peppers and onions to the sausage and omited the canned mushrooms (yuck).  Blended my eggs with the cream soup and milk and added salt & pepper.  Once the sausage was cooked, removed my tots from the oven, spread the sausage mixture over, poured the eggs and topped with cheese.  It will be so yummy in the morning.

I loved this recipe. I didn't add a thing. I followed the recipe exactly. I needed something to take to a brunch babyshower. This was a hit. Since the babyshower, 1 months ago, I think I have made this recipe 6 times! It is great! Thanks!

I thought this was just okay.  As recommended by reviewers, I sauteed and added 1/2 cup each of chopped onion, green pepper, and fresh mushrooms.  Added the cheese to the mixture instead of on top, but also sprinkled some on top the last five or ten minutes.  The added ingredients added about ten minutes to the cooking time.  It was pretty good right out of the oven, but was dry and rather bland reheated the next day.  All who ate it both fresh and reheated agreed....good, but wouldn't make again.  I think the amount of tator tots also overpowered the recipe, especially when reheated.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I added chopped onion to the sausage(the last few minutes to soften) and no other seasoning as the recipes requires. I had to use Southern style hashbrowns.  I was nervous about how many eggs as I did not want an overwhelming "eggy" taste,that did not occur. This was a great hit with my guests! Will make this recipe many times over!

Great recipe.  Have used this the last two Christmas's.  Sure is nice to make the day before and put in oven in the morning.  Not a drop left and I made 2 pans.  One with sausage and one with bacon.  Thanks!!

Wonderful! Make sure you remember to drain the meat ( I forgot) and add just a smidge less milk as we had a little too much juice at the bottom of the casserole. It tasted incredible though!

I made this recipe and it was O.K.  I used the Cream of Mushroom and Garlic soup, Southern Style potatos with onions and peppers, extra cheese and this dish still did not have enough flavor for me.  It did take 1 1/2 hrs to cook as well.  Overall it was pretty good, but I think it would have been better if I sauteed mushrooms, garlic and onions and added that to the mix.

Even following the suggestions people had made about this recipe, I thought this casserole was disgusting! The best part about it was the sage pork, there were WAY too many eggs, it took about 1hr and 45 min to cook and was still runny.

Fresh out of the oven, even after standing for 10 minutes, this was had a mushy texture.  It wasn't so bad warmed up the next day in our iron frying pan but I wouldn't make this again to serve fresh.

Fast, easy way to make salmon.  It's pretty good, but I'm going to do a little less of the dijon next time as it can be overpowering.

I left out the mushrooms since my group doesn't like them.  Very good and

This one was a hit with visitors.  For the first time someone demanded having a recipe of something I've fixed.  Delicious!

Excellent!  My daughter and I assembled it the night before for out of town guests for brunch in the morning.  Just popped it in the oven and voila...everyone enjoyed it very much.  I would definitely make this again.  Even my picky daughter loved it!

I made this recipe for a Christmas breakfast at the school where I work.  I went over very well.  It was also extremely easy to put together!  I will definitely try this one again.  Thanks!

Pretty good, needs some hot or spicy sausage to give it a little more flavor, but not bad.  Would make again but change a little to spice it up.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE USING 12 OZ. OF LOUIS RICH TURKEY BACON,1/2 EGGS AND 1/2 EGG BEATERS,SKIM EVAPORATED MILK, AND REDUCED FAT SHARP CHEDDAR.  WE ALL LOVED IT. I'M ADDICTED! STILL TASTES RICH, BUT NOT THAT FATTENING. THANKS! WILL TRY IT ON HOLIDAYS!

We thought this recipe was both easy and delicious!!  I added diced ham instead of sausage and used eggbeaters.  GREAT RECIPE - thanks.
