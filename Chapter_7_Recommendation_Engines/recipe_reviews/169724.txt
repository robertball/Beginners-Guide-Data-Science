I can dill pickles almost every year and thought I'd give this one a try.  It is possibly the tastiest meatloaf I've ever made!  I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp.(plenty of salt in the pickle juice) and made an addition of 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke to the sauce recipie.  Absloutely a delightful Meat loaf !!!!

I think this is great!  I don't like to substitute in recipes the first time I make something but in this case I had to make a few changes.  I only had ground turkey and I used bread crumbs instead of bread.  One thing I would recommend is doubling the sauce!!!  It's excellent.  Also, dont' be tempted to use relish instead of the pickles to me it's just not the same!  I also think next time I'll bake this without the sauce on top first so I can get the nice crust then for the last 10 min or so add the glaze.  I also forgot to add the salt (ooops just skipped it by accident) but I really don't think it needs the salt.

My first meatloaf ever-- so easy and tasty. My husband kept saying how delicious this was. I didn't have Worcestershire (SP?) sauce, so I instead added a bit of onion soup powder to the meat and the sauce on top to flavor. I didn't add any extra salt because I was using very salty (Israeli) pickles. I cooked this in a long loaf pan, and I knew it was done when the meatloaf pulled away from the ends of the pan. (I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that, but the meatloaf itself tasted perfect!) I'll definitely be making this again!! I was so impressed by the flavor... I would never have known the meatloaf had pickles in it, but it definitely has a little "zing." Also, I like the fact that there is no added cheese or oil, so this is at least marginally healthy!   I served with mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans with garlic... a delicious and easy all-American dinner. :)

This was a really unique meatloaf! I, too, doubled the sauce. I was out of Worchestershire sauce so I used soy sauce instead. My only complaint is that every few bites you get a mushy bite from the bread. But that could be remedied by using bread crumbs or crushed crackers instead. Thanks so much for this!

Used this recipe for a meatloaf cook-off that I organized for my Boss's birthday (his favorite food). I doubled the recipe easily and the only change I made is I used 1/4 cup of crushed salinities in substitution of the slice of bread. Next time I am going to try making the topping with dill pickle relish to see how it turns out. Will make again and it got great reviews. Many skeptics of the name became believers after tasting it.

Uh.....gosh. I was really excited about this meatloaf. Followed this exact, only adding garlic powder to the meatloaf and a little dijon to the topping ingredients. This meatloaf was REALLY wet. Like, I had a hard time getting it out of the pan and it just fell apart into bits. When I scooped it out, it wasn't......visually appealing. My husband ate over half and my son thought it was really great, it just wasn't a hit with me or my littlest. I really was pulling for this recipe. I'd like to play with it a bit and see if I can't get it a little more solid. Maybe make it a base for a Cheeseburger Meatloaf? I'm sorry. I really tried.

I have never had or made meatloaf before but have a freezer full of ground beef as my husbands family has a cattle farm so I needed new ideas to use it. This looked interesting so I tried it! I have fresh garden onions so I used the onion and onion greens and doubled the sauce like others mentioned. The idea of meatloaf never appealed to me but I really liked this one. I LOVE dill pickles as does my husband so when I mentioned this recipe he asked me to make it right away. Yummy!

This is a good meatloaf but we couldn't taste any pickle flavor.. and I doubled the amount (from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup). I would've thought that the pickles were weak or something but they tasted pickly enough straight out of the jar. No complaint about anything else.... Will keep around as a basic meatloaf recipe to add ingredients to.

Excellent! I substituted a half package of onion soup mix and didn't use the chopped onion or salt. Great flavor. The pickles gave a fresh kick to an old favorite. Thank you.

It's a rare occasion that I make meatloaf with beef as I normally use ground turkey, however, DD bought a huge package of the beef so after five burgers, I decided to throw together a meatloaf with the rest. Found this recipe to be a little different from the norm which is why I had to try it. Honestly, this was probably the moistest beef meatloaf I've ever made and the dill juice gave it a nice slight tang.  Like others, I doubled the sauce and I chose to use breadcrumbs instead of the bread slice. Great recipe CaraMeg and thank you!!!!

PICKLES!! I would have never thought to use pickles and pickle juice in a meatloaf. This made the house smell like a McDonald's hamburger as it was baking!!LOL  I don't know if it is the ratio of fat to meat in our beef, or what, but I always have to use 2 eggs in my meatloaf. So, I did in this recipe, too.  Also used 2 slices of bread. I kept everything else the same and it held together very well. I bake meatloaf on a wire rack wrapped in tin foil (poked full of holes with a toothpick for easy drainage of any grease) instead of a baking dish.  I free formed the loaf. Baked for 1 hr and 10 minutes. The whole family loved this and said they'd definitely eat it again. Thanks for a great meatloaf!!

I see what reviewers mean when they say that it is like a Big Mac.  Don't get your hopes up too much because it had the hint of a McD's burger, but still wasn't exact.  The pickle juice and large amount of onions in the meat PLUS the addition of the ketchup sauce mixture all help to make it taste similar to the restaurant style burger, so if that's what you want, don't eliminate these ingredients.  Honestly, I don't know why other reviewers thought it was too bland because I thought it was nicely flavored...and this is coming from someone who loves everything overly flavorful.  I was slightly worried that the pickle flavor would be too strong, but it wasn't at all.  For those of you who complained that it was too soupy, I sprinkled in a bit of store bought bread crumbs to thicken it up, and I think it worked out fine.  Also, I doubled the recipe, making it extra thick in my dish, so I ended up increasing the cooking time by 20minutes.  Overall, it's a great recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

I used breadcrumbs instead of the bread but didnt change anything else. I agree with the review a couple down that this would be good combined with the "cheeseburger meatloaf" from this site. I'm going to make this again but use alittle less pickle juice in the meat mixture, add a few teaspoons of chopped pickles, put chedder cheese in the middle and add some mustard to the sauce. This is very good as is and changes arent really needed.

Moist, flavorful, and the sauce with the pickles really adds a nice touch.  I made according to recipe, except, like so many others, I doubled the sauce, and used 1 cup bread crumbs instead of sliced bread... I used a loaf pan rather than a square pan... but it was really good!

This recipe came to me as an email recipe of the day a while back.  I love meatloaf and I LOVE dill pickles, but it sounded odd even to me.  I had to try it.  I have honestly made it about 5 or 6 times in the past 6 months and I absolutely LOVE it.  I am a bit obsessive with watching my weight, so I use ground chicken 
instead of beef and I sub the egg for just egg white.  I also prefer using a light sweet bbq sauce instead of the ketchup mixture and breadcrumbs instead of a slice of bread, but that's just my taste.
Honestly, this is one of the best recipes I've tried from this site.  Thanks so much for the contribution!!

I love how moist this recipe was, I added some minced garlic, subbed oatbran in place of the bread and added a little hot mustard to the sauce.  I baked it in a muffin tin, it made 6 large "meat muffins".

In my family, we're not big fans of meatloaf.  I thought the dill pickles were great in this, though.  My husband, who doesn't like pickles, scraped off the pickles and thought it was fine.

I made this recipie as stated with the exception of using 1/4 cup of garlic and herb seasoned bread crumbs in place of the sliced bread. I am a pickle freak and my girlfriend & I both loved it, very moist with lots of flavor yet it held together well........thats about all I can ask from a meatloaf!
Rather than chopping the pickles for the sauce I ran them over a cheese grater (I do this for other sauces as well - tarter, etc.). I also doubled the batch and made 2 seperate pans of this, the first one I left "as is" and the second one I added 1/4 tsp. of liquid smoke to the sauce just to compare the difference. Both versions tasted great but I think that my personal preferance is to leave the liquid smoke out next time. Those of you trying to cook with less salt feel free to cut it in half or even use less than that, I don't think you will miss it.

This really is a really good meatloaf. I have made it twice and double the batch the 1st time I made it and well....I made 4x the amount the 2nd time. Because I had a different purpose the 2nd time around. But rating this on the 1st go around. And it really was good. My hubby didn't like the overly amount of onions. He never does. But told me if I cut the onions down to 1/2 and added dill pickles to it, it would be the best "hamburger flavored" style meatloaf ever. I was only concerned about it being very moist, don't want to say liquidy but it was bordering that. But when it cooked up, that cooked out and it was delish. The topping was excellent. And I was really surprised my hubby liked it. My kids really enjoyed it. Now the 2nd go around, I did just what hubby asked. And I decided to make them into what I call "funkified burgers" I made 4 batches for that reason so that the family could have left overs. But I found on both attempts soaking the bread into the onion and pickle juice before combining all the ingredients together. And because the 1st time I made it didn't have regular sliced bread. I chunked in a whole wheat hot dog bun..I know it's redneck ghetto, but it worked for me. I also used low sugar ketchup and Ideal brand Brown Sugar replacer...and it worked rather nicely...Thanks so much CaraMeg for a fabulous recipe.

Thought this was tasty. I added 1/3 cup chopped pickle to the glaze instead of the 1/4 cup, because I like pickle so much. Thought it was a bit on the wet side too. I drained any liquid off half way through. Thanks for sharing. Will put in my meatloaf recipes to make again sometime.

I hope you don't mind if I review this recipe since I made it word for word as written. I know, it seems I'm supposed make substitutions or leave things out or add things to the recipe, but I did note a rare couple of folks below that made it as written, so I thought I might, too. This meatloaf does have an interesting and new twist to it. Like most meatloafs (meatloaves?) it is easy enough to assemble. CaraMeg does not mention that the mixture is very wet and requires some finesse to get it shaped and into the pan. The pickle juice in the mixture adds just a tounch of flavor to the loaf, but I think it needs just a little something more to tie it in with the creative and very good sauce. Maybe a tablespoon of tomato paste and another quarter cup of diced pickles would do it. The finished loaf turned out quite nice looking and firm enough to plate without falling apart. A good recipe, CaraMeg - Thanks for posting it!

This was strangely good! I made this as a meatloaf the first time followed the recipe as directed, the second time made as hamburgers mixed the sauce right into the hamburger mixture then grilling on the BBQ. I did fine dice the onions and dill pickles. This got rave reviews from our entire family liking both ways equally and were not fans of meatloaf!!!

My husband declared this the best meatloaf he ever had!! I just sat back with a smile, and sweetly said Thank you. After all, isn't that what every cook wants to hear? Thanks for the recipe CaraMeg! This meatloaf was very moist and easy to prepare. I did not change a thing.

I have made this several times before and had always turned out good. This time I made it exactly to the letter (minis the onions... didn't have any), and one slice of bread made it still very loose and runny...I put in two more slices and it started to thicken up, I think I could of added one more piece and still been ok (I had white bread, wheat may have done differently). in the past I have substituted 1/2 cup quick oats instead of bread and turned out good texturally. To me, it tastes like one of those expensive restaurant hamburgers, so yummy and my daughter totally loves it...this recipe is about the only reason why I will keep pickle juice after all the pickles are eaten. I think next time, I'll try this with my zesty bread and butter pickles or hot and spicy pickles. Edit 10/22/18: daughter said it was really good but for personal tastes, I think I'll quarter or  halve the salt to 1/4 tsp, maybe 1/2 tsp.  It's a great recipe, Enjoy!

This certainly is a good recipe. I make it like this quite often. I do use garlic in it as well, however. it is fantastic. Great recipe. Thanks for submitting so that others may enjoy it as much as we do. :))

While this recipe did have an interesting flavor, a rare find in the meatloaf world as I've known it which is the reason it got three stars from me, I wasn't impressed overall.  And I love pickles...really, really love them on anything and everything.  My husband agreed that the change of pace from my regular (very saucy/very moist but not "wildly delicious") meatloaf was nice but that it was bordering on bland, despite my addition of a generous amount of red pepper flakes and fresh black pepper, and wasn't particularly moist.  I did add finely chopped pickles to the meat mixture as well.  He said it needed the sauce that was on top put inside the meatloaf...but still have that sauce on top.  A neat idea, sort of a meatloaf burger...but would need alot of tweaking before I'd make this again.  Nah, I think I'll just find another recipe.

I made this with ground turkey.  I was also out of bread, so I used bread crumbs.  We all loved this, it turned out great.  My daughter was excited when I told her there were pickles in it (she loves pickles).  I served it with new potatoes and fresh green beans.  I will make this again.

I decided to make this because my picky girls don't really care for meatloaf, but LOVE dill pickles.  My 4 year old DEVOURED it! (My 2 year old, well, she decides based on looking at something whether she'll eat it, so I won't fault the recipe) :)  I'm not a big fan of dill pickles, but I thought it was excellent!  Very moist, will be making again and again!

Good!  Not too pickle-y.  After reading reviews I used onion soup mix instead of onion, and doubled the sauce.

I made this according to the recipe with the exception of the bread (because of another review).  I used 1/2 cup "savory herb" stuffing. My husband gave it an A+.  I will make it again!

This is YUMMY!!  The kids and I all thought it tasted like a hamburger.  One even thought it tasted kinda like a Big Mac.  lol  We doubled the recipe, so had to cook it a little longer than written and we put the glaze on the last 10 mins.  The only thing we will do different next time is to add a little mustard to the glaze, or maybe the meat itself.

Really enjoyed this meatloaf. It was a little "heavy" on the onion flavor, but that is not to be faulted by the recipe.

It's good but the pickle flavor is not very strong in my opinion. It needs something. It is very moist though and I would make it again once I figure out what else to add. I'd double the sauce recipe and maybe add some pickles to the loaf itself.

Didn't care too much for this one.  The pickle flavor was too much and masked the way meatloaf is supposed to taste.  Personal preference, I guess.  At least I can say I tried it.

This was a fair meatloaf.  It was certainly moist and had a distinct flavor.   I actually tripled the glaze.  This was an overall very good meatloaf.  The ONLY change other than tripling the glaze was I used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs in place of the bread.  GOOD!

I wish i could give this a 4 and a half. this is amazingly good meatloaf. i didnt have the egg do i omitted it, i also toasted my bread first and didnt add the salt since my pickles were salty. i used less pickle juice and it was pickly enough for us. i made a 2lb loaf and there was enough sauce. cooked a little faster but my oven runs hot. this is a great meatloaf. after eating i kept thinking this is PERFECT for meatloaf sandwiches and probably a great starting point for a different kind of sloppy joe. i served this traditionally with garlic cheese mashed potatoes from this site, corn, biscuits and salad. milk for the kids ice tea for the adults. if youre apprehensive like i was dont be!

Seriously Great Meatloaf!!!   I grew up eating meatloaf and make it every once and again when I'm not feeling creative and generally need to go to the grocery.  Never have I finished my meal and said, "wow, what a meatloaf" . . . until now.

I was looking for a 2-4 serving recipe for hubby & myself that still had loads of flavor.  THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!!  The only change I made was using crushed saltine crackers instead of the bread (12 crackers),and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  This is a great recipe for an empty-nester family. (Also a good way to use up that last couple of pickles in the jar.)

I am so glad I found this recipe! My husband really likes meat loaf. I really do not. They are always dry and flavorless. I found this recipe and thought it sounded so odd that I just had to try it. I made it in a muffin pan to cut down the cooking time (30 minutes at 350 was perfect). We all loved it, including the 4 year old! This is definitely going to be making more appearances on our dinner table!

I love pickles, but I was very leery of putting them in my meatloaf.  This turned out sooo well!  My husband and his niece gave it their approval, and dh even said he'd be fine with this becoming my standby meatloaf recipe.  Thanks for such a unique, delicious recipe!

I was a little leery making this - it's the first recipe that I've ever come across with pickle juice in it. Given that there were so many raters who gave it 5 stars, I wanted to give it a fair shot.  I am so glad that I did! My husband, who is a vociferous pickle-hater ate two large portions!  It was moist and tender - and really didn't taste pickle-like at all. It was just a nice compliment to interesting flavors.  I made the recipe as indicated, the only exception being that I made extra sauce/topping - as was suggested by another rater. (Thank you!)  I cooked this in individual large-sized muffin tins for individual "loaves". Worked well. For individual muffin tins (large size, 4/tin), I cooked for 50 mins (plus ten minutes resting time). turned out beautifully.  The other suggestion that I would make is not to grease the pans - I didn't, and it wasn't really needed. I ran a knife along the edges of the "loaves" and they came out just fine.  Fantastic recipe.  Loved this, will certainly make again.

This recipe was awsome. It was a nice new twist on an old favorite. My boyfriend, who is a meatloaf addict, loved it!

Wow, I am totally surprised by this! I am not a meatloaf fan at all, but I ate this and then had seconds which never happens! My kids and husband loved it. I have to say thanks to Ellie who recommended it to me! I usually find meatloaf either too dry or too moist, but this was perfect, and we loved the glaze. The only addition I made was I added a little shredded cheddar and crumpled bacon to center and rolled it up. We loved the pickle flavor, thanks for this recipe, a definite keeper!

I would definitely double up the sauce next time. It was great. The meatloaf however, was just a meatloaf. The pickle juice it didn't offer any benefits to the recipe and honestly couldn't even tell it was there. Next time, I will use my own meatloaf recipe but add the chopped pickle sauce!

A very different and unique meatloaf. I like the crunchiness the pickles give and the slight tanginess that the pickles impart. Delicious! Definitely a dish worth repeating.

I liked this. My husband and daughter apparently do not like pickles (why didn't I know this) so I guess I won't be making again. :-( I did double the sauce and toasted the bread before crumbling it up, which I would do again.

Very good!  When I was forming the meatloaf in the pan, it was very wet...so, I added another piece of bread torn into smal pieces and it came out great!  i didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I omitted that..however, i'm sure it would make it taste even better!  I loved this! I will make meatloaf this way from now on, Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I made some changes, and though it was eaten it won't be a repeat. BLAND, that's all it really is. For the topping I omitted the water and brown sugar, and subbed some half the ketchup for maple bbq sauce. I only had bread&butter pickles, so I used those and their juice. For the meat mixture I used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh bread (roughly 1/3-1/2 cup), used onion soup mix instead of the onion and salt. I lined my pan with fresh bread to soak up the grease. Moist, but it held together somewhat. Served with mashed potatoes. I'll look elsewhere for a better meatloaf.

Really excellent.  I've made this several times now without any substitutions and my husband (not a meatloaf lover at all) and I both enjoyed it very much.  Will keep in my recipes box for the future.

This was soo good! I did add a bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning and doubled the delicious sauce. I served this with Bacon Clapshot from this site, creamed corn with a little curry, and Steamed Green Bean with a little garlic and Old Bay Seasoning. A very delicious supper!

This was a huge hit at our house.  My 10 year old grandson loved it.  I did make a couple of changes - I added about 1/4 cup oats; I used dill pickle relish (drained) instead of chopping pickles, and I omitted the water called for in the glaze.  I also added some garlic seasoning.  This will definitely be a keeper.

Loved this!  The only thing I regret was not making enough.  We love grilling as much as we can so I placed this in a cast iron pot and grilled it.  I added the sauce at the end and opened up the pot.  Will make this again!

I absolutely LOVE this! I made a few changes: ground turkey, dry breadcrumbs (to taste), and omitted the salt (all of it). I also made my meatloaf on a roasting rack, the kind with a drain pan beneath so the fat could drain off. This mixture is very loose, and the finished product is too, but so tasty that I don't mind it being difficult to slice! I served this fantastic meatloaf with home fries and cucumbers in vinegar. I will absolutely make this regularly, thanks for the recipe!

This was really neat!  The flavor and crunch of the pickles works so well.  I took the advice of others and made sure to blend my bread into crumbs so there were no big pieces of bread.  I also doubled the sauce, and it was worth it.  Thanks for the great new and different meatloaf recipe.

Hubs is meatloaf-resistant after a couple decades of military mystery-meatloaf; so any meatloaf recipe that can pass muster for him is a keeper.  I made it as written, and he had seconds.  Need I say more?

It tasted as I imagined.  A quick and easy good meatloaf.  I did double the sauce and it was perfect.  I also used 1/2 cup of panko instead of bread because I didn't have any.  After I finished eating, I realized I forgot to put onions.  I love onion in any dish but I didn't miss it (but I won't forget next time).  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never met a meatloaf that I really cared for all that much...until now.  I tried this recipe because my husband is a dill pickle nut, and we had a jar full of pickle juice in the fridge.  Made this exactly to recipe (kinda unusual for me, to not even add garlic to something like this) and it was awesome.  We had it with some dilled potatoes on the side and are SO looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. This is going on the repeat list for sure.

I make this with lean groun turkey and it is still delicious.  The only addition I made (original recipe is terrific as posted), was to add some of the chopped pickles to the mix (this this happened to be a mistake while I was following the recipe but turned out terrific), and cayenne pepper to the mix and some dashes of habenero hot sauce to the topping mix for some great kick!  Fantastic

Very tasty-  the pickle juice provides enough salt that you don't need to add any as indicated in the recipe. My husband loved it and he is a very picky eater. I will make this again.

Loved it!  Of course, my family and I are crazy for pickles.  The sauce was tangy and delicious.  Very moist.  Great the next day as a meatloaf sandwich.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made! It's so good!  My husband loved it too- and I don't think either of us have ever said  "I really love this meatloaf" before this one.  I will make this again definitely!

not sure what i did wrong on this one. we love meatloaf but this just didn't hit the spot with any of us. the meatloaf wasn't bad, it just wasn't special enough to add to the rotation in place of something else.  and the topping didn't go over well at all (my son said "this is just like going to a fast food place where they nuke the burgers with the pickles and ketchup on them"). i try to not ever rate a recipe at 3 stars - i figure it is just personal taste if it turns out badly - but this one really didn't go over with anyone in the house. sorry.

I double checked the ingredients and directions to be sure I didn't misread any of it. The idea of using dill pickles sounded interesting, and I was impressed that there were so many good reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. I followed this recipe exactly as it appears. I am not at all happy with the results. At the end of the cooking time, the mealoaf was done, but was literally floating in a sea of pickle juice. The texture was tough and crumbly, and the flavor was was way too "pickley".  I will not use this recipe again. For those who are considering it, I would recommend that you cut the pickle juice down to 1 or 2 ounces. The topping which has chopped pickles in it, will give the pickle flavor well enough.  As for me, I much prefer the onion/bell pepper version of great southern style meatloaf.

This is a great meatloaf recipe. I was out of worcestershire sauce so I skipped it and added maybe 1 T of dijon mustard to the topping. I only had dill relish on hand so I just got what juice I could get out of that, which was maybe 1/4 cup and that was plenty for us! Also used 1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs instead of the slice of bread. Thanks!!!

I made this meatloaf for dinner tonight and it was awesome.  The only change I made was to add some minced garlic, my pickles were garlic pickles. And as other suggested I doubled the sauce.  I will be making this one again.   Thank CaraMeg

Hubby loved this.  I used bread crumbs instead of the bread slice.  I baked it in muffin tins rather than making one big loaf.  It needs a bit more sauce though so I will double it next time.

Is it possible for meatloaf to be fun and whimsical? If so, this is it.  It's very yummy and the only changes I made were to use bread crumbs instead of the bread slices, cut back the salt by half and definitely double the topping.  Make sure to catch it before it gets over-done.  Take it out of the oven when it hits about 155 and let it come up to 160 on the stove top as it cools a few minutes.    This is a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe.

I usually don't like the sauce on top of meatloaf, but this was terrific.  I substituted Magi for worchester sauce as I didn't have any.  It was great.  Quite a nice blend of flavors.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought it was good but instead of putting the topping on top, I accidently mixed it in the meatloaf.  I will do it the right way next time.  Still, it was good.

Great dish! I added about 1 Tablespoon of hot green salsa to the meat to kick it up a little. That was the only change I made. I was dubious about the pickles, but now I may ALWAYS do this.

Who knew?? Dill pickles and brine in a meatloaf? This was DELICIOUS. I agree with other reviewers who suggested doubling the sauce. I didn't and wish I had. In an 8x8 pan, this is basically an 8x8" hamburger with quite a bit of shrinkage--about 4 SMALL portions or 2 larger ones--perfect for those of us who cook for 1 or 2. This definitely needs to rest for 10-15 minutes after baking.

I was pretty nervous about this recipe, I was just afraid it would taste like one big dill pickle!  But it was surprisingly good and not too overwhelming.  Yes, you can definitely taste dill pickle but in a good way.  The meatloaf was soooo moist!  I used 1/2 ground beef 1/2 ground turkey and substituted onion powder for the onion because we didn't have any onions.  Other than that I kept the recipe as is.

I doubled the recipe, used all organic ingredients, and added;

2 T. Mustard
2 T. Minced Garlic
1 C. Shredded Mexican-style Cheese

I replaced bread slice to organic homemade French bread
2 thick sliced pieces

I put half the meat mixture on the bottom of the casserole dish and shaped it to an oval, pressing a slight indentation up to half inch on the edges, added the cheese, and topped with remaining meat mixture, sealing the edges with my fingers. 

Lots of rave reviews!!!

This recipe has become my husband's favourite, and in fact as much as I disliked meatloaf as a child (and for the most part I still do), I LOVE this recipe. When making it, the only thing I change, is that I double the topping ingredients to make it saucier. Love, love, love!

This was pretty good.  I would make sure to get your pickles diced up nice and small for the glaze.  I also would consider using 1.5 pounds of beef and adjusting seasonings accordingly, except for the pickle juice.  The juice was tasty in there, but it also made for a sloppy, loose meatloaf.  I think you could safely add the extra meat without losing the pickle flavor.

This has become my go-to (GLUTEN FREE!) meatloaf. I make it probably once a week. I usually find meatloaf to be pretty bland, but the pickle juice adds a really great flavor to the meat. 

After making it many times, I've settled on the following alterations: A whole onion is way too much for my taste. It seemed like half of each bite was onion pieces. I do maybe 1/4 cup diced onion. I started making it with gluten free bread after going gf and it tastes just as good. I just put a couple pieces gf bread in the blender to make crumbs as opposed to soaking them whole. 

Also, I double the sauce for the top. I eyeball the brown sugar amt, but maybe 1/3 cup brown sugar. It may sound like a lot, but I find that a lot of the sauce runs off with the rest of the juices, so having extra sauce compensates for that. The sweetness also really plays off the pickle flavor! Delicious!

This meatload is very tasty but way too salty!  Adding pickle juice AND chopped pickles seems overkill.  I think I will cut the pickle juice in half, and also use only 1/4 tsp salt.  Also, I made this meatloaf in my microwave.  It had too much liquid so I kept taking it out with a baster.  After 16 minutes in my microwave (with carousel, so no need to turn...), and after removing lots of liquid with baster, I put it into my oven for ten minutes to brown/firm up the top.
It really was very good, and I will definitely make it again.
(Note: to the person who couldn't taste any pickle flavor, I used Claussen dill spears which produced a fresh, bright flavor.)

My mother found this recipe 40+ years ago in an old Farm Journal. I was, and still is, the only kind of meatloaf that I will eat.  I have been making it for my husband for the past 24 years, and he has asked that I give it to many of his friends!  Very flavorful and a change up from regular meatloaf!

Pretty good meatloaf.  It is a too liquidy if you just use the amount of bread called for; I used dried breadcrumbs, and just dumped and mixed until I got a less liquid consistency.  Hubs commented this tasted like hamburger and we discussed how some of the reviews stated that this meatloaf is reminiscent of a Big Mac.  He agreed--but you'd probably need to put this on bread and add your toppings to get it to really taste like that.  I doubled the sauce topping and used dill pickle juice instead of water to thin it.  Turned out well.  Ate with green beans and bread for a hearty lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  The flavor reminded me a little of Iowa Maid-Rites!  I followed recipe exactly and used Claussen dill pickles.  I generally use crackers when I make meatloaf but I really didn't notice any difference with the slice of bread.  I also bake my loaf without topping and add it during the last 15 minutes.  This allows a crust to form on the top of the meatloaf.  I prefer that method to this one. And like others, I will double the sauce next time and omit the water.  The sauce is wonderful!

I LOVE this recipe! I made it as directed with the following substitutions: bread crumbs for bread (it's what I have) and adding a drop or two (maybe 1/8 tsp at most) of liquid smoke to the sauce (a recommendation in the reviews). 

When I served it, I was in heaven. My family agrees that this meatloaf tastes remarkably like a McDonald's hamburger....but elevated to a wonderful level. It  may sound weird to you. But we live 525 miles by plane from the nearest McDonald's. I grew up with McDonald's, and sometimes I get a hankering' for a simple Mickey-D's hamburger with extra pickles. I now will be making this recipe, slicing it up, and putting on a nice burger bun...and maybe add cheese (ssshhhhhhh). I'm SO excited. Thanks CaraMed for saving me the cost of a plane ticket to quench my occasional hamburger thirst. :)

Great recipe!

We really loved this meatloaf, I used 93 lean beef and left out the brown sugar and bread for health reasons, so I added some mustard instead....It tastes so much like a Mc Donalds quarter pounder! Awesome recipe!

I made this mainly for my kids who are huge pickle lovers - but was completely surprised at how bizarrely good this recipe was! I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested - and will definitely be using this as my go to meatloaf recipe.

I've made this meatloaf without ketchup, and replaced brown sugar with molasses. Overall a very good flavor, but it needs more bread to improve the texture. Also, it baked in only 45 minutes in 8x8 dish.

Weirdly, I found this a little dry.  I did use bread crumbs, so maybe I just used too little. The flavor was good though and I liked the pickles.  Will likely add more pickle juice, higher fat ground beef (originally used 93%) and maybe a little less bread.  Definitely worth a second shot...

Without even looking at the other reviews, my fiance also exclaimed "It tastes like a McDonald's hamburger!"  I made two substitutions (a half cup of bread crumbs instead of bread and onion powder instead of onion) and added some garlic powder.  I liked that this was made in an 8x8 pan because it cooked in 45 minutes!  I put the glaze on halfway through the cooking time.  Thanks for a great meatloaf recipe!

I wasn't crazy about this but my husband loved it. I added some chopped pickles to the meat mix based on other reviews but would leave them out next time.  The sauce has plenty of pickle crunch. The leftovers made great sandwiches the next day. So good, I would consider making just for that purpose!

Really good flavor, and the husband's reaction was favorable. My only concern is tweaking the sauce. It just seemed a bit raw to me. Maybe I should have minced the dill pickles. I'll definitely be making it again, though.

Oh lordy, this meatlof is DELICIOUS. I'm not one with the cooking in any sense of the word but I found this recipe extremely easy. I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce recipe and used breadcrumbs instead of bread and it worked perfectly. It totally satisfied my month-long craving for meatloaf and I will DEFINITELY be making this again. It's easy, moderately healthy, and makes a LOT...what more could I ask for?

This recipe seemed so odd that I had to try it.  Glad I did.  It isn't awesome but it is good.  Tastes like a big 'ol McD's burger.  I may melt some cheese over the top next time.

I loved this meatloaf as did most of the family.  The DH likes another kind that I make.  But for something different this was great.  I made it exactly as written.  It even held together.  Will definitely make again.

I've been making this meatloaf for about 5 years now! It has become my go to recipe, I always make it as written with a couple of very minor changes, I add 2 cloves minced garlic to the meat and use bread crumbs rather than bread. And in the sauce I replace the water with pickle juice. It comes out perfect every time and we just love it

I love this recipe!  I make this all the time, sometimes  I use hamburg and sometimes  I use ground chicken to make it a little healthier.  Both ways are awesome!  Probably will never use a different recipe for meatloaf than this one!

I love dill pickles so I was super excited to try this recipe, unfortunately I didn't find it all that tastey. The sauce was good, but overall the meatloaf itself was rather bland.

I made this as written except I used oatmeal rather than bread. It was amazing! Absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever made. The pickle juice gives it a moist flavor, but the vinegar seems to disappear. The topping is wonderful too! I feed myself, dh and two boys, will definitely double recipe next time. Oh, and I doubled the topping, so will quad it next time.

LOVED THIS! I used breadcrumbs in place of the piece of bread (about 1/2-3/4 cup, just enough to hold it together) and I also doubled the topping. This was one of the moistest meatloaves I've ever had or made. I still have my favorite 'family recipe' for meatloaf, but this comes in at a close second. I will definately be making this again...and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was NOT looking for a new meatloaf recipe BUT I'm so glad that I found this one! It is exceptionally flavorful and holds together very nicely. I made this just as the recipe was written.

I too got the same recipe from my mom; the only difference is mine has ground beef and sausage.  The original recipe came from Bird Farm Sausage Co.  My grandkids ask for it very frequently!  I now add sautéed chopped carrots and sometimes roasted red peppers for an added vegetable ingredient; it helps keep the meat loaf moist and the kids really like it.

this was okay, kind of a weird flavor (and we love pickles at our house!!!!)  Meatloaf was too mushy.  kinda tasted like a white castle hamburger meat.  Just not our thing, but thanks anyway!

Pickles make a fabulous addition to meatloaf; this was exceptionally moist. Hubby and I really enjoyed this and even the kids finished their portions. Like others, I left out the salt, used breadcrumbs instead of shredded bread, and doubled the topping.

so yummy! Hubby loved it and asked that this be the standard meatloaf, he also loved the sauce and wished there was more , so next time I will increase the sauce. I was even thinking with BBQ season among us making this into hamburger patties and making the sauce on the stovetop to spread on the rolls.

Loved it!  It was nice to have a meatloaf that didn't just taste like a hamburger.  I doubled the sauce, but I'm not sure that it needed it.  I also substituted 1 cup of bread crumbs per slice of bread as suggested by others.

We can our own dill pickles that are absolutely so much better than store bought, so I had to try this. Sounds kinda weird but it was actually good. Moist. Tasty. Easy. Didn't use the salt, by habit. Would make this again

I've made this a couple of times now.  It's a great twist on the normal meatloaf!  I use a meatloaf pack (1/3 beef, 1/3 pork and 1/3 veal) and add some chopped pickles into the meatloaf itself.  I also double the sauce as other reviewers recommend.  It's moist and delicious!

I make this for my family all the time! They love it! It's a nice twist on meatloaf! I usually leave out the onion, mix in about 1/4 cup of dill relish and 1/4 cup of sweet relish into the meatloaf, and use Club Crackers or graham crackers instead of sliced bread. I've even doubled the recipe, using 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground cooked ham before (some small town stores/deli stores will grind the ham for you, but usually I wait for ham to go on sale, buy it in bulk, and grind it myself using an electric grinder), and it was a big hit! Sometimes I substitute dill relish for the chopped dill pickles in the topping and I always use Splenda brown sugar substitute to make this recipe more diabetic-friendly. Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!

I enjoyed this for the most part.  The pickle juice was enough pickle flavoring and the pickle chunks were a little much.  I did get SEVERE heartburn and indigestion throughout the night after eating this, so if you have acid reflux problems STAY AWAY.

Needs some tweaking, didn't have enough flavor, and was crumbling. I will use bread crumbs next time and maybe add the topping in the meat like someone else suggested. But will try it again for sure as we love pickles.

I thought this was very good!! I did make a few substitutions though. I used a cup of Zesta crackers instead of the bread. I also substituted the pickles and pickle juice for banana pepper rings and juice. I didn't have any pickles in the house and it ended up being a GREAT substition! I will make it again. Even my one year old loved it and I have the hardest time getting him to eat ground beef.

Omit the brown sugar if you don't like sweet pickles.  I addedd it thinking that it would cut the dill, but it changed the flavor.  Otherwise, it was very good.

My husband and I do not eat meatloaf very often.  My husband just doesn't like it, and I tend to suffer afterwards with heartburn when I make it myself.  Not to mention it is usually never moist and not very tasty.  I took one look at this recipe and after getting over the shock of dill pickle decided to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did, we all loved it including my husband who took the leftovers to work the next day.  The recipe was very moist and delicious.  I did change it a little by adding half the onion and throwing in some garlic powder instead, and of course using crushed ritz crackers instead of the bread (1 cup of crackers for 1 slice of bread).  I can't wait to make it again.

Best meatloaf ever!  The pickle juice kept it so very moist and tender.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for but next time I will double the topping sauce and will also add pickles to the meatloaf itself.  My hubby really chowed it down and raved over it.  This is definitely a keeper!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good and different from the typical meatloaf.  In order for this to be good, you need to use good pickle juice.  If you didn't like your pickles, you won't like the loaf.  Great to have yet another use for pickle juice! Will make again.

CaraMeg said she wasn't sure where the recipe came from, but her mom made it all the time when she was growing up.  My mom made the same recipe.  It comes from a Good Housekeeping magazine style recipe book called "350 Recipes for Ground Beef"  I still have it, inherited after my mom passed away.  This is an excellent meatloaf.  The pickle juice in the meatloaf tenderizes the meat a little and that dill pickle glaze is sooooo goood.

1.27.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/169724/dill-pickle-meatloaf/ ... I should've read Sarah Jo's review & lessened the dill pickle juice.  This was verrry wet, very hard to form.  Rather than being a rectangle, it plopped into an oval.  You know what I mean, right?  :D  This reminded me of a cheeseburger pie I made many years ago ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15120/quick-cheeseburger-pie/ ... I thought that was okay.  This wasn't as good - primarily because of the sloppiness; taste was similar.  'Not bad, but not a re-do either.

This recipe is great if you like dill pickles. If you dont, you wont like this. I use more bread because it can be less firm as another reviewer said. I also cook it a little longer. Never leftovers, everyone loves!!!

This is the first meatloaf I've ever made and since I love pickles I had to try it.  Don't be dissuaded by the name, this is a very tasty meatloaf.  I agree that you should double the sauce, it is VERY GOOD.  My only complaint is that the mixture ends up being extremely wet and the bottom of the meatloaf is really soggy after it's cooked.  I thought about maybe cutting the amount of water to be added.  Any suggestions?

Very good!!  Loved the pickle taste, and I had added just a tad extra. Needed a bit more sauce for the top in my opinion, so next time I would make a  bit more of that. But absolutely loved the unique flavor!

Absolute family favorite. Making it tonight for about the 5th time per request from my son home from college. I now make double and there is almost never any leftovers. Too bad since it makes a great meatloaf sandwich if the is some left.

Pay attention to moisture and bread amounts so that you have a good texture. It is a shame that it did not work for some people but if you get it right it is well worth the effort. Give it another try.  Enjoy.

I love dill pickles and I loved this meatloaf. The only changes I made were to leave out the onion (allergic), used prepackaged bread crumbs,  and I put half my mixture down, dent in the center, fill the dent with American cheese and top it with the rest of the meat pinching to close it. A perfect tangy cheeseburger loaf.

I followed the recipe, but doubled it and baked it in two pans.  I had such high hopes for this one.  In the end, it was just soggy.  My boys wouldn't eat it, and they love pretty much anything made with meat.

This had the potential to be really awesome! I used everything as directed.. Minus the water. I also added the chopped pickles inside the meatloaf. (garlic dill) surprised to find it needs more pickles. To really being out the pickleness.(is that even a word) some mustard would be a nice addition to the glaze. I found this to be a bit on the wet side . A 1/4 breadcrumbs can fix that. 
Will make again with some tweaks to my tastes! Thanks!

Delish! This meatloaf was on target with flavor.  It helps that i love pickles.  It is on the juicy side, so the next time I will use one quarter of a cup of pickle juice rather than the half. I used  two slices of bread, and in the topping, i used just a pinch of brown sugar. No mistake, i will make it again.

Great!  Easy and always turns out wonderful!  If it seems a little to wet, just add some more bread crumbs to help dry it up a bit.  Do leave it moist.  Not dripping wet.

I've made this as the recipe is stated and made some alterations as well. To the loaf mixture I like to add a dash of garlic powder, green Tabasco sauce, Worcestershire and about 1/3 cup of sweet Chow Chow. I also used breadcrumbs instead of bread because I usually have it on hand. I double the sauce as recommended by other reviewers. I ran out of ketchup by a few tablespoons the last time I made it and finished the amount with bbq sauce. I thought it might be strange, but it was actually delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I love the pickles!

This was good. I added a couple of tablespoons of minced pickles to the meat in addition to the topping. I used about 1 1/4 lbs. of lean beef and added 2 eggs.

The leftover, cold meatloaf made the BEST sandwiches.  The dill pickles made the finishing touch.  Next time I will make a double batch.  By the way, this is the only meatloaf that I have ever made from scratch that turned out.  Both my husband and I loved it.

I was never a fan of meatloaf but this changed my mind! Only thing I changed ,I didn't add salt  and doubled the sauce.  My sides were baked sweet potato and sautéed yellow squash with onions it went nice with it. thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe. When it was cooked there was an very large amount of liquid that I had to pour out. It was not firm enough before baking, so I'd like to use bread crumbs next time and use an appropriate amount for firmness.  But it was very tasty.

I had high hopes for this recipe, because I love dill pickles.  However, this wasn't as good as a Bacon Cheeseburger Meatloaf recipe that I have/make.  That one makes the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.

This meatloaf is my husband's mew favorite.  I've made it twice as the recipe indicated with only minor alterations: left out the salt (because there's enough in the pickle juice), added chopped up pickles to the loaf, used bread crumbs as the binder, and didn't add the sauce until the last 20 minutes of baking.  Four other people shared dinner with us when this was on the table and everyone wanted the recipe, plus one more person who called because word-of-mouth said it was soooo good.  I will, however, STRONGLY suggest you double or triple the sauce as it disappears very quickly since it's great on the meatloaf and the mashed potatoes.

Tried this recipe and loved it! Even my daughter who is not a meat lover went for seconds. The only thing I did different is put some hot sauce in the topping because I love hot sauce.

I thought this meatloaf was tasty and easy to cook.  AND.. I definitely could taste the dill pickles.  I recommend this recipe and plan on baking it tomorrow for my daughter, who LOVES dill pickles and son-in-law.  I hope they enjoy it as much as my (ex) boyfriend and I do.

Have made this a few times now and this is my go to recipe for meatloaf as Grumpy likes the dill pickle part and always was requesting I put it in his meatloaf.  Great recipe...love it with beef or venison.  I really love it in a sandwich the day after with a little mayo :)

This is by far one of my favorite dishes to make.  My husband loves it so much that he has me make a 4lb batch every time we fix it.  I usually wait until 10 minutes left to add the topping and I always swap the measurements for the black pepper and salt.  We like a little more spice.  Also I use oats instead of bread to be a little more healthy.

I liked this a lot, so I'm giving it 4 stars, but husband didn't.  He asked what was in the topping, with a look and a tone in his voice that could have meant "what's in this topping?  Snot?"  But I thought the chopped pickles & pickle juice gave the loaf a very interesting flavor.  My only change was to use panko instead of fresh bread, and I think that was a good thing; it would have been WAAAY too wet with just fresh bread to soak up the liquid.  Guess who's having a meatloaf sandwich for dinner tonight?  ;-)

Subbed oatmeal for the bread as I do whenever I make meatloaf and didn't add the pickles for the top.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  What a treat! Even my dill pickle haters ate it warm for dinner and then again cold the next day. Will make again.

What a pleasant surprise! I will fix this again. If you did not know you had pickles in this, I don't think you guess the "mystery" ingredient. Loved the sweet/tart flavor of the sauce. Xtra sauce is a good idea if you like gooey food like me.

After this recipes glowing reviews, I knew that I had to try it.  I was very disappointed.  No one in my family enjoyed it.  I agree with another reviewer that it was too wet.  I thought that the dill pickles would add an interesting flavor, but it was the only flavor I could taste.  It definitely needed some sort of seasoning.  My husband requested that I never make it again.  Sorry.

Wow, this was good!  This was my first attempt ever at meatloaf.  B'friend claimed it was better than his mother's which is really saying something!  Guests also gave it thumbs up, alas no left overs for lunch the next day.  I doubled the sauce based on prior reviews, a must since I baked this in an 8x8 pan.  No way would the "correct" amount have covered the meat.  This was nice and moist and did not fall apart.  It took about 45 minutes to cook, probably because it was not in a loaf pan, so keep an eye on it.  I think next time I will make patties and serve it on a bun with cheese and lettuce!

We loved this! I doubled the sauce and used about 1/2 c of breadcrumbs in place of the bread. Also, rather than forming a loaf I just pressed it into the 8x8 pan. Because it was flatter, it cooked in about 45 mins. Thanks for sharing- this one will definitely go into our meatloaf rotation!

We almost finish everything.  I take advices from other reviewers such as no salt, double the sauce which is poured 15 min before it is done.

My family LOVES this recipe.  I am now required to make a double batch every time, so we can have it again soon.  Since my husband is gluten-intolerant, I like to use bread in this recipe that is made with Bob's Red Mill Gluten-free Whole Grain Bread mix.  It's a dark bread, so it adds interesting depth of flavor to the recipe. After playing with meatloaf recipes for a couple of decades, I'm thrilled to have finally found "the one".

I have tried ALOT of meatloaf recipes, they all basically taste the same.  This was so quick and easy and definately the best flavored meatloaf I have ever had.  I used a pound and a half of ground beef so I upped the pickle juice to 3/4 cup.  Too much! the mixture was very wet.  I just cooked the heck out of it (hour and a half) and drained the juice periodically.  I also added some hickory seasoning I had on hand.  I didn't think  the recipe called for enough seasoning.  After tasting it though I really don't think it needs anything extra.  The flavor is perfect!

The first time I made this it was hard not to eat the entire thing in one gulp - or so my husband said. I followed other's recommendations about not adding salt as the dill pickle juice is salty itself and I'm glad I did. Overall a big favorite at my house!

Did not taste the pickles, which is good since I am the pickle lover and my husband is not. The mixture was too liquid-y to make a loaf, so I put it across the 8 x 8. which was fine, but did not resemble a loaf. I would cut the water out next time for sure.

Really great. If you like pickles you can't help but love this. Doubled the sauce and put it on half way through as others suggested. YUMMERS!

tried this recipe on a whim, was not disapointed. we used 93/7 ground beef, and made extra topping.  go easy on the salt because of the saltiness of the pickles.  my wife and i loved it and will definately make it again.  great recipe

This was a hit in my family of hubby and 3 teenage boys....I don't like meatloaf but love this web-site as I always feel in a rut when I try and prepare meals...one comment I got was that this reminded 2 of my boys of McDonalds Cheeseburgers....that in itself made it a HUGE hit...thanks for sharing...

I made this wonderful Meatloaf and loved it. I made a mistake,did not read all the directions. I took the sauce that was supposed to go on top of the Meatloaf and mixed it with the meat. OMG was that good. I put bacon on top of the meat before I baked it.Thank you so much for this wonderfull Recipie.

Followed the recipe exactly. Easy to prepare - not too long to wait. Not the best meat loaf I've ever had, but certainly tasty and quite unique with the Dill Pickle taste thrown in. I like it!!

It's my first meatloaf ever and I liked it because it was moist and had a taste of pickles, which I love. Next time though I'll replace ketchup with something less sweet and I wont put any brown sugar (the topping was too sweet for me).

This is the first meatloaf that the kids have ever liked!  They would always hate it when I made meatloaf (I kept trying new recipes), so I stopped making it, until I saw this one.  Yeah!  They all loved it and rated it 5 stars.  Much of the success is due to the fact that it goes in an 8x8 pan, so each square seemed more like a burger with pickles and ketchup on top.  Great recipe.

Wow, I was not to sure about the Dill Pickle in this recipe and I have to say it was excellent, we really enjoyed it.  My husband who is not totally into meatloaf said he liked it.  I will make it again.  I did double up on the sauce portion of recipe and was glad I did.

I followed this recipe with only the substitution of bread crumbs for the slice of bread as I didn't have any.  I thought it was pretty good, but my husband thought it was just average so I rated it with three stars.  The pickles were too much for him.  Guess I won't be making it again.

Followed this recipe as noted, with the exception of using one cup bread crumbs, ground turkey, and cooking in a loaf pan.  The meatloaf was moist, and held together quite well - was impressed with that, not being sure what to expect in regards to other comments.  While admittedly the taste was different, I don't think we liked it enough to make again.   An avid lover of cold meatloaf, it did seem to taste better to me the following day in a sandwich.  It was certainly a different tasting meatloaf, one worth trying.

Great recipe that is so flavorful!  If you like dill pickles on your burger you'll love this.  I changed it from beef to turkey and added garlic to the loaf.  I served it with baked rosemary fries. I would definitely make this again!

I made this recipe when I was in France to make my family and friends discover american food.. they loved it and so did I! but I keep it secret ;-) it's not a common dish in my country! I went to the cheesecake factory and ordered a meatloaf last time, but it wasn't as good as this one! Thank you!

This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe!  I had to leave the onion out (I didn't have any until after I started).  I did have to add an extra slice of bread in order to get meat to hold together.  I could definitely pick out the pickle flavor, but I might try adding some chopped pickle to the meatloaf itself as others suggested.

For us, this was just ok. The loaf itself was a bit bland and very watery when cooked. And the glaze just didn't have any zip. It's a great idea though but just needs a little more something something.

Great easy meatloaf recipe. The pickles were awesome on top. It tasted like a quarter pounder! I'm going to put more pickles IN the meatloaf next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I used panko crumbs instead of bread and added some chopped fresh spinach to the mix. Next time I think I'll add a  bit of garlic. I used a mixture of lean ground pork and ground turkey as that was what I had in the freezer. This was very easy and I'll make it again sometime

We loved this meatloaf recipe! I did use bread crumbs, and double the sauce as others suggested. I'm sure this will be our favorite meatloaf from now on.  Thanks for recipe!

This recipe is great. I baked it in the traditional bread loaf pan and it turned out great!

This was a great change from the everyday meatloaf  recipe! I used sweet pickles instead of dill & I also doubled the sauce like several people suggested.

Pretty darn good, although mine didn't hold together very well but I did use very lean meat.  Still, great flavor.  I used soda crackers instead of bread too, maybe that is what my problem was.

I tweaked this recipe just a little. I add'd some A1 Sweet Hickory steak sauce to the meat mixture as well as the topping mixture. I WAS DELISH!!!!

Delicious.  We all loved it, it's very hard to find something that the 3 kids (1 teen and two toddlers) will eat, but everyone chowed down.  It was very moist and the pickle juice gave it a nice subtle tang.   The only thing I changed was not adding any salt, I figured the pickle juice had enough and we didn't miss it.  Definitely a keeper, I will be a new staple.

My daughter and I loved this meatloaf!  Smelled like burgers while baking, and was a nice taste change from regular meatloaf.  Only change to the recipe I made was to add a little Dijon mustard to the meat mixture.  I can see myself making this again.  Thank you CaraMeg for this recipe!

When I told my husband I was making a Pickle Meatloaf he turned up his nose but was he ever surprised at how good it was. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and it was just right. I also used a pork/beef combination. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. By far this is the my best meatloaf yet!

I was a little hesitant about trying this one, but all the 5 star reviews convinced me.  It was truly excellent.
