I should've added that when if you don't have Thai or purple basils, you can use sweet basil. Although Thai basil can be found at an Asian market, I grow both Thai and purple in my garden. It's a fantastic salad either way! I buy the rice by the case on Amazon. It's not as expensive that way either. Enjoy!
