I first tried this recipe back in the late 1960s, but lost the recipe.  It came back when I saw "Steel Magnolias" as the Cup-a Cup-a Cake.  I made it without the egg.  And like the movie, I always serve it with good vanilla ice cream, just to cut the sugar!  Simple to make for a last minute dessert, guests think you created a master piece.....and you did!

Very tasty! Perfect served warm on a chilly evening. Easy to prepare with few ingredients and with every measurement being either 1 cup, 1 tsp. or 1 can, it will be easy to memorize and whip up any time. Mine was done in about 30 minutes, so you may want to check it at the end of the baking time.

Not cool. This was so very sweet. The truly odd thing about it was that the sweetness completely lacked a flavour beyond the brown sugar. It just needed something more to it, more fruit, some spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice or whatever. I'd use roughly 2 tbs of brown sugar sprinkled on top before baking & a light dusting of icing sugar after baking.

Very good, especially for a cake that is essentially fat-free!  Does satisfy that sweet tooth without the guilt.  Tastes much better cold or room temperature than warm, though!

I make this all the time.  I do cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and only use 1/4 cup of brown sugar. That cuts down on the sweetness.  I also add pecans to top.

I thought this recipe was a little odd, since there was no oil and no applesauce.  I was concerned that it wouldn't rise, or that it would fall apart.  It did rise, but the batter was very sweet, as some of the other reviewers stated, so I cut back on the brown sugar sprinkled on top to about 1/4 cup.  This coffee cake reminds me of pineapple upside-down cake, but it needs a pinch of salt, and perhaps a bit of cinnamon to boost the flavor.

It's really not "incredible" or that unique tasting, but it is a very easy cake and tastes good for what it is.

Quick and easy.  It tasted similar to a pineapple upside-down cake.  Next time, I think I would only use a can of pineapple instead of the fruit cocktail.

Way too much liquid for this recipe. Wouldn't even cook, just made slop . Looked up other recipes and the amount of undrained Fruit coctail called for in this recipe is used with double the amount of every other ingredient in this recipe. Last Allrecipes recipe I'll ever make.

It was okay. Too much sugar in my opinion - my husband said the same thing. If I make again, I'd probably use can of pineapple only and less sugar.

My kids LOVE this cake!!! The only difference I did was mixing in the brown sugar, only because I didn't read the directions fully and just threw everything in the bowl, now I mix half the brown sugar in and put half on top...I also added a little less white sugar as others have stated in their reviews. I double the recipe to make in a 9X13 pan :)

Surprisingly yummy! I chopped up the fruit cocktial a bit so there was smaller chunks in the cake. I also reduced the sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet. I cannot believe it is non-fat. We served it with cool whip mixed with cinnamon.

This recipe was okay.  It was quick to make and I had all the ingredients.  40 minutes seems like a long time to cook.  Mine was done all the way through in 25 minutes.

This recipe was okay.  It was quick to make and I had all the ingredients.  40 minutes seems like a long time to cook.  Mine was done all the way through in 25 minutes.

Way too sweet for our taste. It's easy, but I can't get past how sweet it is.

This recipe gets points for being quick and easy, but the finished product was just okay.  Other than the extreme sweetness, there just wasn't that much flavor.  Cool-Whip helped, but it was still pretty bland.  We did like the way the brown sugar made the top crunchy, though.
