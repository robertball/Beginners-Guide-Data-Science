These were  hit and were gone in no time but next time I will change the amount of artichoke liquid that you saute the onions in to just 1 tbsp as the finished product will not be so oily.  I bought the huge jar of artichokes from costco and just measured out 1-1/2 cups of artichokes.  I would also use a nice sharp cheddar and a good pinch of red pepper flakes in addition to the other spices to give them some bite, we are not huge hot spice lovers but these definitely could use a little more spice.  this is a great appetizer or cocktail snack, and would also be great for a potluck.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is one of my favorite appetizers. Definitely use a sharp chedder cheese, but this recipe doesn't need anything else, it has tonnes of flavor!  Everytime I bring it anywhere there are never any leftovers and I always get requests for the recipe.

I made these for a potluck gathering as an appetizer and people seemed to like them.  They are kind of like square mini artichoke quiches.  It seemed like they needed a crunchy topping of some sort though so I crumbled more of the saltines with butter on top and baked for an extra 10 minutes.  I should have used ritz crackers though because the saltines never browned and looked kind of odd.  Anyway, with a few modifications I would probably make these again.  I think they need slightly more artichokes and I might use a different cheese like mozzarella or maybe even pepper jack since you didn't taste much of the hot sauce.

This was a hit at Christmas last year so I'm making it again. This recipe also got passed around at Superbowl parties. I scaled it down to an 8" square pan for a small gathering, and it was well received.

Loved these - great texture and flavor.  I cut all of the ingredients in half (with the exception of using 3 eggs instead of 2) and baked in an 8x8 pan.  Also omitted the salt and added additional hot pepper seasoning per our taste.    To my calculation each piece (1/16 of the 8x8 pan) is about 45 calories...next time will try reduced fat cheese to cut this down a bit.

Delicious!  I have made this just as the recipe states, but more recently, I didn't have all of the ingredients.  So I subbed Ritz crackers for the saltines, added a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce, and sauteed the veggies in a bit of the marinade instead.  So good--cold, warm, or hot!

The first time I made this, I already knew I would have to use more seasonings than the recipe called for, but it still tasted bland and "eggy". I had to triple the amount of seasonings called for to get it tasting right. Other than the seasonings being a bit less than impressive as is, the recipe was a big hit after I spiced it up. Yum! Yum!
