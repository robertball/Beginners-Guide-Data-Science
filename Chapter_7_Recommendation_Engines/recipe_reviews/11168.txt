I have used this recipe for years and it is one of our very favorites.  Don't forget to crush the anise seed for lots more flavor.

Great and easy recipe.  It was everyones favorite at Christmas.  The only thing I did differently was add 1 tsp. anise extract because we like a little more of the anise flavor.  Besides that it was a perfect anise toast recipe!

Simple, easy and tasty!  I substituted anise extract for anise seed, and these little toasts/cookies were fabulous with tea!

Awesome recipe, I did add 1 tsp of anise extract in addition to the anise seeds. (we love the anise taste. I then remade them using the same amounts plus a 1/2 tsp of baking soda, It yiled a lighter version- very close to the texture of the ones you buy in the store.

This is a wonderful, quick  and affordable recipe. I added these to my Christmas cookie tray this year. Be careful not to overbake on the second baking. They brown fast.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did however, modify it because while I love anise, my husband does not.  I omitted the anise seed and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  Prior to baking, I sprinkled sliced almonds on top.  Everyone loved it and since it is so easy, I'll be making more later today.

This is an excellent recipe.  I'm currently on my 3rd batch :)  It's easy to make with only a few ingredients, and it reminds me of the toast my Gram used to make.  My first batch I only had one egg, so I used applesauce and baking powder as a replacement, and they tasted good but weren't as crispy as the second batch I made as written.  Also, you can use a tsp of anise extract in place of the anise seed.  It gives a sharper flavor, but I prefer mine with more anise.  The batch in the oven now uses 3/4 of the called for amount of sugar and 1/4 molasses to try to achieve a warmer flavor.  The batter tasted good, so we'll see how it goes.  All in all, this is a great an simple recipe that's easy to experiment with.  Thanks.

I made this for Christmas, my son loved it; I dipped it dark semi-sweet chocolate then refrigerated at least 1 hr. to make the chocolate hardened, then served it.

These were really tasty if you like anise flavoring.  I made mine a bit more healthy and subbed 1/2 c wheat flour, 1/4 egg beaters for one egg and did 1/3 c splenda.  Since they were toasted at the end I thought they still had a really nice texture and flavor.  Thanks!

I have had this same recipe for almost 45 years now and misplaced it.  I came to allrecipes and found the exact one here; it is so simple and with so few ingredients, and very tasty with tea or coffee... love it!

I too added a little imitation anise extract for more anise flavor.  The house smells delightful, and the cookies taste just like I remember my mom's Italian aunts' cookies tasting!

Texture is real nice.  A good dunking toast.  A little less flavorful than I would prefer, but I am a huge fan of Anise.  I just used both Anise flavoring AND the anise seeds to get the cookies to my prefered level of flavor.
I also made this recipe using Almonds and Almond flavoring and they were terrific also.  A nice touch is to drizzle a little glaze using your choice of flavored extract (Almond or Anise were mine) with confectioners sugar and a little milk.  So good you may not wait for the glaze to dry before you eat them!!

I was a bit skeptical in making these at Christmas. My family is big into fudge and chocolate. I was afraid these would be too subtle. But they were a huge hit with everyone, and I couldn't keep my hands off them either. Great with tea, too mild for coffee. My fiance loved the first batch that came out and ended up making all the batches after that. Very easy recipe if he can do it. I made four batches in all, and didn't have one left by Dec. 26th.

This cookie is delicious toasted or not. My husband is an Italian-American and he loved it. 

I used a teaspoon of anise extract in place of the seeds.

Do not forget the cup of coffee!

I love anise, so I used probably 1 1/2 TBS, and crushed it in my mortar and pestle first.

This is a twice baked cooky. That being said, if, after dunking it in your tea or coffee, it is still too hard, you beat your dough too much which makes any cooky tough and nasty!
This cooky recipe came from the original Betty Crocker Cooky Book in the "diatetic" section. 
I add chopped dried craisins to mine, or the tiny chocolate chips (and cut back the anise seed here (trust me) by half). Also good with finely chopped candied fruit (orange peel is very nice!) and fine chopped nuts (almonds or pine nuts - Mmmm!).
Be sure to really crush those anise seeds!
Try a drizzle of melted chocolate or at least some powdered sugar!

Very easy to make and very good.  I used 1 teaspoon of anise oil and it was way too strong.  I'd try it with 12 teaspoon next time.  I will definatly make this again!!
