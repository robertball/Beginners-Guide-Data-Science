A HUGE hit each time I make it & take it somewhere (I can't make it just for home becaused we can't leave it alone!) One thing I changed, instead of using all the different spices I simply used 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

A good and easy recipe. Like it much better than pumpkin pie. Can easily use lower fat alternatives (low fat evaporated milk, and egg substitute)without any problems. I like to cut in the cold butter into the cake mix and then stir in the nuts. It makes for better distribution of the butter. Oh, and if you toast the nuts first it intesifies the flavor. Kids loved it.

I love this recipe.  
I do tweak it a bit.
I add half of the Cake mix into the pumpkin mixture to make a firmer pumpkin base when cooked. Since I used half of the cake mix in the batter I cut back on the Butter to 1/3 cup.  Everyone loves it so much that, every time I serve it I have printed out recipes to hand out.

First time I made this, I loved it!  I did use pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices as I was out of some.  I've made it a few times for the family since then. Changes I do, I use the larger can of pumpkin (30oz) and leave the rest of the amounts the same  and no problems.  I do 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.   I took this to a gathering at our local saddle club today.  We have a lot of women there that are fabulous cooks and bakers.  I've had people tell me things were good in the past.  But this time, I had them asking for the recipe, I've been messaged on facebook for the recipe and compliments and I've even had some phone calls.  I have never had that happen before.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe for four potlucks this month!  It is a great autumn dessert and so quick and easy to prepare!  I did not find this recipe to be too spicy at all.  In fact, my spice-sensitive children love this recipe just as much their parents!

I didn't like this cake, but everyone who ate it, raved about it. I thought it was way too sweet, and I felt like the top of the cake was way too "dusty". Next time, I would cut some of the seasonings in half, and use less cake mix on top.

This is an easy to make dump cake recipe for people who love pumpkin desserts.  However, it is quite spicy, especially for children.

This is one of the easiest and best dessert recipes I've ever made.  I have made it many times, and have had many compliments and requests for the recipe.  It is a good last-minute recipe and travels well, too.

YUMMY. But... I didn't follow the recipe exactly due to my father's heart disease. I cut out the butter and reduced the four eggs to one egg. I used about 1/2 the evap. milk.  Skipped  the sugar entirely, used half a box of cake mix and it was so good.  Topped with a scant dusting of powdered sugar.

This has good flavor, but I found the consistency somewhat soft, although I baked it as directed. Almost a pudding-like texture.  But I cut it in small squares, put each in a muffin paper cup and served it as part of a desser tray--folks seemed to enjoy them.

I live in Korea and didn't have evaporated milk, so I used regular milk and it turned out great!  Delicious, a big hit at our Christmas dinner!

It is quick but it's still not worth it.  The top was too dry.  The bottom tasted like pureed pumpkin straight out of the can.  My family thought pairing it with ice cream made it better but they still weren't crazy about it. I've tried other dump cake recipes that were much better.

Everyone wanted seconds or thirds of this delicious recipe and it was gone within a day.  Especially for those who like pumpkin but not pumpkin pie, this recipe is a winner.  One thing I'll note, however, is that it is not a dump cake... the only thing "dump" about it is dumping the dry cake mix over the batter.  Still, I will make it again!

I have made this exact same recipe many years ago and I must say that prefer it over the traditional pumpkin pie.  This recipe adds that little extra something that everyone will enjoy.  When I made it many of my guests wanted to know how it was made and if it was difficult.  They also commented on how they preferred the cake over the "traditional pumpkin pie".  This is what I will be serving at my Thanksgiving dinner this year.

This was a good, easy dessert to whip up last minute. I agree with others who suggest cutting in butter to the cake mix rather then the melt/pour method. I also was thinking this was more of a cake, but instead its essentially a pumpkin pie cobbler. Still good.

I read the previous reviews and changed the recipe a little. 
I mixed half of the cake mix with the pumpkin mixture. Then I topped the whole thing with about half of the remaining cake mix. I delicious end result, can't wait to make it again!

Very easy recipe to assemble.  I took this cake to work and all enjoyed it. Next time, for my personal taste, I won't use an entire box of cake mix to sprinkle on top. I find it just a bit too sweet. But overall, Great Cake!

Was disappointed with this recipe. Way too spicy. If I would make it again, I'd definitely reduce the amount of cloves that go in it.

This may be the best cake I've ever had in my entire life!  I had leftover pumpkin pie filling today and didn't want to make a second cake, so I used this recipe.  Wow!  Now, I did make a few adjustments. Basically, I used carrot cake mix and mixed 1/2 of it into the pumpkin pie goop.  Then, I sprinkled the rest of the dry mix on top and covered it w/ about 3/4 c of melted butter.  Most of the dry mix was covered.  I then took about a cup of pecans and put them on the top...pressing a bit so that they would get washed by the butter. I then baked for 1 hr 10 min at 350.  I was using a spring form pan in a convection oven, so you may have to adjust time a little. My knife never came out completely clean and I was worried that it hadn't set, but it was fine and WOW! Hope you enjoy and thanks for the great starting point!

I have made this recipe many times. I do change it up just a bit.Trader Joe's organic pumpkin is a bit firmer than the other brands, and works great in this recipe. Instead of adding individual spices, I add 4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in the pumpkin mix. After the pumpkin mix is blended thoroughly, I stir in 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the cake mix. It makes it a firmer dessert. I will always make this cake for company, events, etc. Thank youfor the awesome recipe!

I made this for teachers, in two 8x8 inch disposable pans.  

After I made the pumpkin mixture, I poured it from a large (8 cup) measuring cup, evenly into each pan. 

I then sprinkled the cake mix over each one (and left about 1/4 of the bag of mix because it seemed like too much).  

I used 1/2 cup butter in EACH 8 inch pan, and other dump cake recipes I've seen call for 1 cup butter for a 9x13 pan.  It just didn't seem to coat enough with less.

Put both in the oven and it took 45 minutes for them to turn golden brown in my oven, which cooks everything in an average amount of time.  They turned out very nicely. :-)

I made this exactly as written.  I thought the flavor was great, not too spicy at all. But the top cakey part was way too dusty and dry, and it had these hard disc-like pieces all over the top that we couldn't cut through. I thought it would be more moist and have  a cake consistency.

I put a crust down in my pan and then put the pumpkin mixture over it.Then I dont use the full box of cake mix because its to thick. The crust makes it more like a pie.

This was a huge hit in our house. I followed the recipe exactly - we love it! It reminds me of an upside down pumpkin pie, but better. The cake mix and pecans instead of a crust make it delicious. I made it for a weekend breakfast treat and it was gone by evening. Thank you for the recipe! Will definitely be making this over and over.

Very disappointing... way too eggy tasting. The pumpkin layer reminded me of cheesy egg bake (without the cheese, of course, but had a similar texture). Tasted better after refrigerating.  The top was nice, tho.

It was a little runny at the bottom of the pan. But taste really good. The next time I make it I'm going to add some cake mix into the mixture too. And i might try using a pie crust on the very bottom (cook it almost done, let it cool) then add my pumpkin pie mixture.

Excellent recipe. I added 1 cup of cake mix to the pumpkin mixture, then I cut the butter into remaining cake mix with 1tsp. Of cinnamon, mix in the nuts & sprinkle on top. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.:)

I liked this dessert very much at first.  But, after my second taste decided it was way too sweet.  Maybe more melted butter for the topping would help.  The pumpkin part was good--topping too, too sugary for my liking.  Easy to make though!

This was sooooo good! Made it for Thanksgiving this year and got RAVE reviews.  It's my new favorite alternative to pumpkin pie -- it's a great combination of pumpkin pie and pecan pie that's even better topped with whipped cream.  Will definitely make again.  THANKS!

We had this brought to our Sunday School class one morning for "treats" and it was awesome (so good I had seconds).  I am not a huge pumpkin fan, but this was very good.  I will be taking it to Thanksgiving with my family.

Made this for dinner at mom's, and everyone loved it!  They've already requested it for Thanksgiving.  I cut the butter into the cake mix, and toasted the nuts prior to sprinkling them over the top, like suggested by other reviewers, and it was YUMMY!  I also served it with coolwhip sprinkled with instant mulling spice.  This is a keeper!

Yummy!  I used almond milk and reduced it with a slow boil to make the right amount. I also put half the the cake mix in with the pumpkin.

Just made this afternoon and ate a bite while still quite warm. I suspect this one will taste even better cooled off, with whipped cream. It was delicious, though. I totally followed the recipe. Simple and quick to make but looks very nice when baked.

Great recipe and it was a simple quick dessert.  I think it would be better cold after you make with whip cream on top.

It was just okay, I used a spice cake mix and expected that to help it out but no. I used 2 sticks of melted butter and walnuts on top on the cake mix. I wasn't thrilled with it. I won't make it again I don't think.

Followed step by step.  Added more pumpkin used 29 ounce can. Did not use cloves, ginger, ect. Just used my pumpkin pie spice (makes things easier) .  This recipe has become a family and friends favorite tha I turn to during the fall and winter season.

It was a big hit at Thanksgiving as an alternative to pumpkin pie.  I added about 1 1/2 cups of pecans on top instead of 1 cup.

This tasted ok but on the suggestion of one reviewer I put half the cake mix in with the pumpkin mixture (which was fine) but then per that reviewer I sprinkled the other half on top of the pumpkin mixture and used only 1/3 cup of melted butter sprinkled on top with the chopped pecans.  1/3 of the cake came out of the oven with just the dry cake mix sprinkled on top, even though I did sprinkle the butter on the entire top.  I removed that one third and melted more butter and sprinkled it on and then placed it under the broiler for a few minutes.

A bit too spicy for my kids.  I mixed half the cake mix into pumpkin mixture, and the texture was perfect.  I used cold sliced butter instead of melted.  I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts, and it was delicious.  As it cooled, I sprinkled on cinnamon sugar.  It would be a five star except I need to cut down the spice.

this is a great & easy to follow recipe. the changes I made were to use pumpkin pie mix, therefore using less sugar and omitting the spices. I also ended up only having 3 eggs and so made do with those and it turned out just fine! next time I will make it with all 4 eggs but I think using the pumpkin pie mix is a lot easier so I will continue to make it with that shortcut. all in all, very tasty, I couldn't help myself and was eating it warm out of the oven!

I did use two teaspoons of cinnamon and cut the butter to 1/3. However by cutting the butter it left dry cake mix showing. So I dusted  it with powder sugar and shook some cinnamon sugar over the powder sugar. As for the ginger, cloves, and nutmeg I used 1/2 teaspoon of each since they are so strong.

Even after reading the reviews, the texture still took us by surprise. The flavor was very good, but the center was a lot like pumpkin mouse. I did mix some of the cake mix in to the pumpkin mixture as another review suggested, but it either wasn't enough or I didn't execute it well.  We tried the Pumpkin Crumb Cake receipe on the site and much preferred it.  However, if you like a mouse like texture, you will really like this receipe.

I also used pumpkin spice, 4t, and added about 1/2 of the cake mix into the pumpkin mix.  WOW!  My apartment smells like Christmas and it's only September 22, thanks!  I will definitely make this again.  It was super easy and tastes great.

Excellent as always!!! After a few times I've knocked it up by adding all the spices at 1 tsp each including pumpkin pie spice for a true holiday spice dish. Delicious!

I didn't add toffee bits & used chopped pecans and it was very good, but a bit too sweet for me since I am a recovering sugar addict but it was perfect for my mil's 80th party ! I'd rather have less sweet desserts now like a regular pumpkin pie.

Very good recipe although the name is deceiving. Is definitely more pie like on the bottom but knew that when I was making it. My kids all love pumpkin. Only substitutes I made was I had no evaporated milk at the time so I used regular milk, just a little less of it, and I used allspice and cinnamon as my spices. My kids do not care for nuts so left that off part of it. All in all great recipe that can be easily adapted to suit your needs

Dump cake is traditionally sweet and rich, but this one almost turned my stomach for some reason. With ice cream on top, I could hardly finish a modest serving.

This dump cake is terrible.  The cake mix stayed on top of the pumpkin as "dry cake mix" and it is way too spicy.
