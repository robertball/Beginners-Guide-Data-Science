This is delicious and I could tell just by looking at it that it's a nutritionist's dream.  For my comments/suggestions: I used Queso Fresco instead of Cotija because it's much cheaper (less than half the cost).  Also, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and chile powder and I was quite happy with that in place of the cajun seasoning.  I had one serving without avocado and I would say that is a must for the recipe.  And lastly, I would actually suggest skipping the lettuce.

This salad was delicious! I used raw corn, omitted the chicken and the beans, and tossed the veggies with the salsa verde (which is what I'm assuming you're supposed to do, but the directions leave you hanging). Great flavor, nice texture, and very pretty--good for a party. If you've never had cotija, it's a very dry, mild, salty cheese; it reminds me of cheese curd. If you can find it, use it (but I wouldn't sub anything else)--it really adds to this salad.

Excellent flavor, although labor intensive.  Worth it though!

Made this for Recipe Group:  30, April '11.  My family really enjoyed this salad.  It is a little time consuming to put together, but worth it.  I realized as I'm typing this review that we forgot to put the cheese on it.  The dressing on this salad is the best part in my opinion.  I will most certainly make the dressing again.  The lime flavor is a very nice compliment to this salad.  Thanks Jenny for sharing.

This was an interesting salad. It was chosen by the "recipe group" on AR for the Cinco De Mayo theme. It had a lot of ingredients! And, it also made it a little pricey to buy them all. I decided to make the dressing one day and the rest of the salad another day. I followed the recipe exactly except I broiled the chicken breast, used queso fresco, and 3/4 cup of cooked frozen corn to save a little time. I also had to use iceburg lettuce because the leaf lettuce I bought seemed like it had turned even though I had just purchased it. I loved the salsa verde and will use that again in other recipes or as a chip dip. Now that I have the cajun spice I might make more broiled chicken with it for an alfredo or other recipe. But, making all these components for one salad was a bit much to me. It was tasty it just seemed like a few separate recipes, combined to make one, that are great on their own. I would also not consider this to be a good representation of Cinco de May though, as it is not a classic dish, although that has nothing to do with the recipe. I do think this salad would be perfect for a January diet resolution though, as it is loaded with nutrients and fiber!

Made this for Recipe Group. I prepped everything and then put the avocado mix on some Boston lettuce leaves, adding the salsa verde on top (as stated, it doesn’t say what you are supposed to do with it), Queso Fresco on top of that, chicken on the sides and garnished with lime wedges.  The cilantro overpowered the salsa for me, I don’t care much for it anyway. The salad as a whole seemed to be just dry raw veggies with chicken. If the salsa is supposed to be mixed in with the avocado mix, that may account for the dryness part. Although I did mix it all together before eating. I didn’t care too much for it and added in some Catalina dressing. A nice southwest dressing would go wonderful here. Hubby liked it and added more of the salsa to his. Thanks for the recipe.

Overall, a good salad that I will make again for sure but lacked the wow factor that would have made it 5 star.  This only took me an hour to prepare. I made the corn in the microwave and wish I had actually grilled it. I also didn't have red peppers so used green and added a little tomato garnish for color.  The salsa was very good and had a different texture(which we liked) than most other verde recipes I've tried. The instructions didn't really say what to do with the salsa so I used it as dressing. I think I would prefer mixing some with the avocado mixture to "disperse" it better as it's rather thick and doesn't really pour. I like a little taste in every bite and the overall dish was a little "dry" served as it was.  Without the lettuce, it would make a pretty good summer side dish, that would hold up well. Thanks, Jenny (and the Recipe Group)

Recipe Group selection of 4/30/11.  The salsa verde is excellent!  I will use this part of the recipe often on its own.  The veggie portion was just ok.  I think it would have been better if it had more moisture.  Maybe more avocado and lime?  Or maybe mix all but the avocado ahead of time and let it moisten the cabbage then add the avocado just before serving?  I think this would be a better brunch or lunch for us.  It seemed too heavy for a side dish but not filling enough for a main.  But we did like the flavors.  Thanks, Jenny

We loved this salad! The salsa verde turned out so flavorful and delicious, and the salad was really good too. I thought the chicken would be pretty spicy, but it wasn't. It just had a mild flavor that complemented the rest of the salad well. Depending on how much pepper you use for the salsa, that could be spicy, but ours had a nice medium flavor. I will be making this salad again, yum! Thanks for the recipe, Jenny from WA!

I made a few changes and it was super easy and super delicious!  I kept measurements for the salsa the same, but added two avocados (small) to the blender to make a tomatillo-avocado salsa.  I pounded four chicken breasts thin and seasoned with Cajun seasoning, then grilled along with three ears of corn on the cob.  I used a 10 oz. bag of shredded cole slaw mix and combined it with the head of green leaf lettuce.  I added the red bell pepper, the fire-roasted niblets from the three ears of corn on the cob and the black beans to the lettuce/cabbage mixture, as well as about 1 cup of roasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  I tossed everything together.  When it was time to eat, I added the salsa to the lettuce mixture and tossed it; then topped the lettuce mixture with grilled chicken, and sprinkled with cotija cheese.  I topped it all with crushed tortilla chips.  It served 5 adults a tasty and very filling meal.  All agreed it was wonderful!  So good!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Delicious.  I substituted feta cheese for cotija.  Added chopped radishes, and cucumber. Sauteed cubed chicken in 1 tsp olive oil, 2-3 TBS chicken broth and blackened seasoning til dry. Lovely color.
