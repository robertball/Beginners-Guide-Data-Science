This is really good.  I used cream of chicken, but would probably be good with cream of mushroom, too.  Next time I would saute the onions to give them a milder taste-- the onion was really strong in the stuffing.  I didn't add corn because I didn't have any.  I would definitely make this again.  The sauce on the chops is delicious!

WOW! Just the dish we were looking for... and it turned out great! Did make changes, just used what we had in the house (and not the biggest fan of celery).  We mixed a box of stuffing, can of cream of mush soup, can of corn, part of a red onion chopped and sauteed.  I doubled the glaze, which could have easily been tripled (at least) to go over the 4 pork chops.  Loved the glaze! We just cooked in 9X13 pan.  My husband absolutely loved it (as did I) and it was SO easy!! Will definitely be making this one again! :)

Probably the best baked pork chop recipe I've ever eaten.

I recommend salting/peppering the chops and hitting them with a fast sear in fry pan before baking.

OH, also, double the brown sugar/spicy mustard glaze... THEN it's time to bake.

Outstanding.

I made this today on a whim and my husband loved it. Only thing i added some was minced garlic. Have to have garlic in almost everything. I did not have spicy brown mustand so i used dijon mustard and it turned out great. Husband said it was worth having again

OH MY! This is delicious.  4 stars because I didn't follow it exactly.  It's a great recipe to work with.  I only had an onion and carrot on hand so I used that and no celery.  I finely diced them, sauteed them in butter and stirred them into the stuffing mixture.  I had cream of chicken soup so I used that instead of celery soup.  I used 2 cups stuffing and added a half a can of water to the mix.  BUT I don't think it needed extra liquid.  I will not add extra next time.  I had dijon mustard so I used that.  I doubled the glaze portion and spread it all over the top of the pork.  The glaze was nice and caramelized and wonderful.  Some may have dripped into the stuffing which just added to the yumminess of the stuffing.  The corn added a nice sweetness.  I may actually put just a little finely diced apple in the stuffing next time too.  The pork and stuffing together in one bite...oh, yummy.  A great combo of sweet and salty in this dish.  I will be doing this recipe again and probably for other family.

Pretty good. Everyone liked it. I did saute the onion in a little butter before mixing it with the stuffing mix. The glaze was nice. sweet & tangy.

This was good. I used cream of chicken soup and one soup can of chicken broth and increased the stuffing to 2 cups. I too would saute the onions before mixing them with the stuffing and corn.

Took a poster's advise and cooked 40 minutes -my bad - way too long.  Also, for us, this was very salty.

I liked your recipe. However when I prepared it and after cooking it was a little dry. Just a suggestion would 2 cans of soup be better.

This was DELICIOUS!! The hubby and I will definitely make this again. We did have a few tweaks though, just due to ingredients on hand. We only had corn, so I used twice as much as the recipe calls for, and cream of chicken rather than cream of celery soup. For the glaze, we didn't have any brown mustard so I doubled the amount of brown sugar and then used a teaspoon of regular prepared mustard and a teaspoon of worchestershire. Also, season with Mrs. Dash original blend or Penzey's Mural of Flavor prior to cooking, your taste buds will thank you.

Good recipe except the pork was nowhere near done in thirty minutes. Kinda ruined the night. Everything else was done while we nuked two of the chops and put the dish back in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.
