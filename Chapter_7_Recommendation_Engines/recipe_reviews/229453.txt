Made this for my wife and she flipped. Requesting this recipe once a month now. Don't make the mistake I did -- found the chowder very bland while cooking, added chicken stock and punched up the seasoning. It didn't need it. Once the salmon is put together with the soup + chili paste... it all comes together. Go AS IS!

Made this for my husband on Valentine's Day, and he loved it!  I used Dijon mustard between the layers of salmon as suggested in the video.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. The video was very helpful.  Thanks for such a great dish!

Love Chief John...I do not consider myself a cook, he builds myself confidence with humor. Ok now the recipe... On our monthly rotation now, even my 16 year old loved it...For the most part, I followed recipe, tweaked it on my family's preference.
1. Dijon mustard and a tad of honey mixed in... 
(never heard of what mustard he used, I'm sure it would be great, ...interest to hear about others reviewers about their other suggestions between the layers) 
2. Potatoes... 2 cups... or 2 large (3 small). Potatoes 
3. MORE bacon per our fam. members... Love of bacon., maple bacon large slice,one slice per fam. 
(Remember, just make sure you drain out the majority of bacon fat.,before adding other ingredients)
4. I skipped the pan warm up on stove top...cooked for 20 min at 375 degrees. 
5. We salted and pepper the whole thing per our individual taste
6. I served chili sauce, on the side, for husband preference
(chili paste...in  supermarket found in the herb section... Gourmet "fresh" in a tube)
7. Didn't find the video confusing, but helpful, viewed it once all the way, then stopped it and started it as I was working on cooking it, that also helps me build my confidence.
Ps the time to make and finish is spot on

Watching the video did help with this a lot.  Cutting the salmon was not difficult however the "Belly Piece I had was too thin to butterfly, so I had to make some adjustments.  I also went very light with the Lemon Tarragon mustard, next time I would use more.  All in all a fairly simple recipe that did deliver a nice dinner!

I made no changes to the recipe. This was outstanding. I will make it again as my wife now request it frequently. If you want to make a fairly easy recipe that look like a complicated work of art and taste amazing this the one for you.
