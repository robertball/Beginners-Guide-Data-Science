These were good, but didn't blow me away.  Like another reviewer noted, this is a great base recipe.  I will make this again, but with at least the following changes: use applesauce instead of shortening to make them healthy, perhaps half whole wheat flour, more banana, fresh ground nutmeg and cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hmmm...great base recipe.  I used 2 mashed bananas, 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup each flax meal and oat bran.  Instead of soy milk I used 1 cup light coconut milk and 1/4 cup almond milk.  They are not too sweet and very wholesome tasting. Yumm.

These were excellent muffins. I love making  muffins for my family and this was one of the best muffins I have ever made, especially because I melted in semisweet chocolate chips and added chopped walnuts to it. This was a great recipe. I have to say, the name is very original.

Decent recipe.
Put apple sauce in instead of shortening, dough is a bit more firmer then I expected.  Not sure if I over mixed or just because of the substitution. 
 
Thanks for the recipe.

Love these!  (I made them with Rice milk rather than Soy milk because I think Soy milk tastes funny when heated.) My daughter, who has a dairy allergy, really enjoyed these right out of the oven with a little dairy free margarine.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I do think it's a little odd to be eating a pancake-tasting muffin. I probably won't rush to make these again, but they were good. I guess they're perfect if you love pancakes but don't have the time in the morning to make them. I made these changes: butter instead of shortening, 2 mashed bananas, and regular 1% milk.

These muffins did taste a bit like banana pancakes, but not necessarily in a good way.  I added cinnamon, vanilla and another half banana...still a bit tasteless.  We didn't serve with maple syrup as suggested, so if we make them again, we'll try that.

I needed to use up some soy milk so I made these. No one ate them! My boys LOVE muffins of any kind, but they wouldn't eat more than a bite of these. I even added extra banana and cinnamon to make them more flavorful and moist. They tasted like bread with a HINT of banana flavor. I won't be making these again, sorry.

These muffins are delicious! I did, however, make a few additions. In particular, I added cinnamon and cloves as well as drizzled a brown-sugar topping onto the mixture after pouring into the pan.

These have a smooth texture and are very yummy! Great with butter and jam. If you want to eat by themselves I would add a little extra banana, wheat flour, and maybe some cinnamon like another reviewer did.

These are pretty good for what they are, but nothing special. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of vanilla and used half whole wheat flour and half regular flour. They were still pretty bland and didnt taste much like banana.

Very good muffins that are easy to make.  I used butter flavored crisco for shortening.  Also substituted one cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose flour and some ground flax seed.  Next time I might add more banana for more flavor.  I will definitely make these again.

I will make these again. I added an extra half banana and substituted 1 c. of wheat flour for 1 c. regular flour. I also used vanilla soy milk. The batter seemed awfully thick, but they came out well. Mine took twenty-five minutes to cook, but that probably had something to do with the extra banana. They are moist and breakfast-y and my husband downed two immediately. With that amount of wheat flour, they are not overly sweet.

Made these in a double batch, froze, and the kids would pop a couple in the microwave before school. I used peanut butter as the shortening, part spelt and part whole wheat flour, and used half pure maple syrup with half brown sugar. I added more liquid to make it a proper muffin consistency. I skipped the bananas because I didn't have any, but they would be excellent with, too!  My kids, both teens, love them!
