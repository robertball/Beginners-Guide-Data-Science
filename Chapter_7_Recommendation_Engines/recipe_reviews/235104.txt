I just tried this recipe today getting my Xmas baskets to finish filling up with treats. This is a simple and easy recipe. I read the other reviews first and this is the adjustments I made. 
I added sugar to 1 cup, following according to the recipe, when I added the one egg I beat in 1 tsp peppermint extract. They were just a bit dry to roll but it worked out. I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper and baked that way,, seems to correct the sticky mess of the candy canes. It also took me 10 - 12 minutes to bake. They don't brown up much just a little on the bottom. I ended up with 4 dozen yummy cookies. 
These turned out perfect will definitely keep for every year. Thanks for sharing..

Made these cookies at work last year, and everyone enjoyed them. Plan on making them again this year for the banquet. I am also giving them as Christmas gifts. Thank you for a great cookie, that I will always use.

I am not a peppermint fan but thought they looked festive for Christmas. I followed some of the reviews and upped the sugar to one cup as well as  1 tsp of peppermint flavoring.  OMGOSH, these are delicious.  I just made another batch with butterscotch candies.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla and the full cup of sugar.  These did not keep a round shape. Next time I will put them in the fridge to harden a bit before making the balls.  Also my baking time for both was between 14 and 15 minutes.  48 cookies per batch.

These are wonderful pepperminty treats I added to my Christmas cookie list!  The changes I made were..... to add one tsp of peppermint extract to the dough & 1/8 tsp to the glaze, using milk w/confectioners sugar & I increased the sugar to  1 cup instead of 3/4 cup as it wasn't quite sweet enuff to my sugar happy family!  Yummy!!

I made a gluten free version of this recipe using a gluten free baking mix.  It turned out well because the peppermint candy pieces that are in the dough really help hold the cookie together which is great because some GF products can be a bit crumbly.  Nice, easy recipe.  The candy topping really makes them look festive.

It was a decent cookie. The cookies could have had more flavor. They were very floury and not sweet enough. The icing and extra peppermint on top helped boost the flavor a lot. Next time I think I will add just a bit more sugar.

I ran out of butter! I only had 1 1/2 sticks so I had to sub a 1/4 cup vegetable oil. I was nervous they'd be awful and they were amazing! Also I made sugar 1 full cup and I added a teaspoon of vanilla when I added the egg. And when I did the frosting I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla as well. Oh and the crushed candy canes were the green and red swirled ones so they came out super pretty. My boyfriend, daughter and I are obsessed and this will for sure be added to our Christmas cookie list every year!!

These are yummy!  Even my boyfriend who doesn't care for peppermint said they were good :)  Made them as written, but had to add a little water to the dough as it was a bit dry.  They turned out great, and I got exactly 36 cookies.  I used peppermint stars instead of candy canes, it was fun to take out some aggession by smashing the candy to bits!   I did not use parchment paper, but I think I will next time.  The cookies do stick a bit to the cookie sheet.  Also, watch the cook time.  Even a little more than golden brown on the bottom can happen fast and alter the taste.

These are so cute and tasty. I followed one of the suggestions and used 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp peppermint extract.  I didn't have the problem of the batter being dry. I always spoon my flour into the measuring cup, I think it uses less flour when not packed in by scooping. These are keepers!

I made this according to the recipe but for extra flavor, added 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract and a couple hands full off semi-sweet chocolate chips. I think without that, it would have been flavorless. Cookie turned out nice and tender. I had to bake a little longer because the dough was very cold.

Great, Easy to make, cookie.  As some suggested, I increased the sugar to just under a cup, added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract and 'if it's worth baking, it's worth adding 1 tsp vanilla'. Wonderful flavor!

Definitely add the peppermint extract that others recommended.  I didn't have any of the extract on hand and wanted to get some cookies done, so I made as directed.  After tasting them out of the oven I would agree the flavor is very mild; so off to the store I went for peppermint extract (which I added to the glaze).  Next time I will add to the dough instead and may even try adding some baking cocoa.  I think the glaze and crushed candy canes will look even more stunning against a dark chocolate background.

After mixing the ingredients (I followed the recipe verbatim), I wound up with a very dry powder for my "dough." Usually I never alter a recipe the first time I make it, but there was literally no way to roll balls out of it. So I mixed in two additional eggs (making a total of three eggs) and this created the perfect ball-rolling consistency — everything was smooth sailing from there. The final cookie was somehow light and moist at the same time. They might be a tad boring, but like another reviewer said, the icing/topping made all the difference!

Tasty! In my oven, they come out better if I put the tray on the top track and shield it with an empty tray on the bottom rack.

I liked this recipe a lot. It's very easy and if you like peppermint it's tasty. I did use 1 cup sugar added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/8 teas of peppermint extract to the dough. I used milk instead of water for the frosting and added about 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract. Very easy and good.

There must be something missing from this recipe.  I made it exactly as written, and all the 1tbsp sized balls ran together on the pan and I'm left with a mess of flat square cookies I had to cut apart. Got 35 out of the stated 36, so sizing was ok.  I didn't find the dough dry at all like some other reviewers, it was a perfect consistency to roll into balls.  Too bad they didn't stay in balls.  I forgot to add extra peppermint extract into the dough as some recommended, maybe that would have given them more peppermint flavor.  Will add some to the icing for sure now.  I'd make them again, if I could figure out how to keep them from going flat.  Baked for 10 minutes, and it doesn't seem to be enough, so would go to 12 minutes next time.

The cookies didn't have a lot of flavor, but I made the frosting with milk, confectioners sugar and peppermint extract and sprinkled candy on top. Then they were pretty good.

I will make these again, but I think the flour needs to be reduced to 2-3/4 cups. The dough was a little dry, and I had to work it, for it to keep it's shape. I  also used a teaspoon, not a tablespoon for each one. came out great!

In keeping with the reviews before me, I upped the sugar to 1c. I also added red food coloring, some vanilla extract, and added peppermint extract to both the icing and the cookie. It was meh in flavor but they look beautiful.

The girlfriend of my cousin brought these cookies to Christmas and they were amazing. I loved how fluffy and cake-like they were while still being dense enough to remain a cookie. I enjoyed the peppermint, but wanted to see if I could be successful in using this base cookie and changing the mix-ins. 
I made chocolate chip by increasing the sugar to 1 cup, adding 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, and using 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate  chips. I tried them without the glaze but they were too dry so I glazed them the same as the recipe. They turned out great. 
I also did a batch of cinnamon where I increased the sugar to slightly under 1 cup, added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, and 3/4 cup cinnamon chips. I glazed these as well. They turned out even better than the chocolate chip. 
I will absolutely be making these again, and whole heartedly recommend this recipe.

Delicious cookies for Christmas and beyond!  Yummy! I save any unused candy canes from the previous Christmas in my freezer. These were perfect to use in this recipe. I would suggest one change: use a peppermint frosting instead of a glaze. I found the glaze messy and a frosting would stay right where you put it.

Great butter cookies.  If crunchy candy cane bits aren't your thing, just leave them out, and you still have a great pepperminty cookie.

When I followed the directions precisely as given I ended up with a bowl of powder.  Ended up doing my best to fix it by adding some milk to at least get a dough.  Probably also should have added some baking soda.  Results were edible but not worthy to put out for company.  Won't be trying this recipe again.

I was so excited to find this recipe for peppermint cookies.  I had a lot of broken mini candy canes so I thought this would be perfect.
I was wrong.  I followed the recipe and added the suggestion of sugar.   The candy cane melted out of the cookies making a sticky mess (thank goodness for parchment paper ).  I'm still going to take them to school for a cookie exchange.  But I'm not including the recipe. 
On the up side, they do taste alright.

Pretty good.  Made it with my four-year old, super super easy recipe.  Added extra sugar like suggested and added some almond flavoring and vanilla flavoring.  They are a tad bit floury, but I'd probably make them again, with the icing on top they are pretty yummy.

Just made them tonight to package up for the neighbors, and sampled some extra...so easy to make and quite tasty! Ground up the candy canes to mix in, and took the coarser pieces for topping. Will definitely make these again!

A wonderful Christmas cookie! The dough for these cookies isn't very sweet, but by the time you add the frosting and candy canes on top, they are a perfect Christmas treat. Loved by all my family and friends!

This is a very good cookie recipe and I was told but friends and family that it "tastes like Christmas". I did have to bake them for 13 minutes, they seemed a little soft and under done after just 10. They still came out moist and chewy after the 13 minute bake.
