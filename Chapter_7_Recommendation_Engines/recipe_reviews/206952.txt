I made this with no water, all chicken broth, and a bit more raisins.  I also used corn instead of carrots (it's what was in the freezer)... I have to say that couscous is typically bland to begin with!  But this was a very quick and easy recipe that is an excellent side dish.  I think using only chicken broth (low sodium version) helped immensely with the "lack of flavor" listed in other reviews.  Overall, fast recipe for this mom on the go, and goes well with everything from chicken nuggets to pork chops.

I followed the recipe except for the raisins, I cooked them in the water before adding the couscous to plump them up.  The recipe was quite bland, needed more salt to bring out the flavors, I did use 1 whole boullion cube in the water but it still wasn't salty enough.  It needs something, not sure what. Maybe it'll taste better the next day?

I made a couple modifications - I used 1 Tbsp olive oil instead of the butter and I used 2 c. lower sodium chicken broth instead of the broth and water.  And based on someone's suggestion below, I added the raisins with the broth so they were plump.  With these modifications, the dish was a big hit, even with my 5-year olds.  I may add more raisins next time (and use golden raisins if I remember to get them).

I prepared this following the recipe but added a little more raisins.  My daughter thought the raisins were too sweet; but she did agree with her husband that the carrots and onions added some much needed flavor to the couscous.  I still think it needs more salt added.  I did use chicken broth but may switch the amounts of water vs. chicken broth the next time I prepare it.

Great dish.  I'm not a big fan of raisins, so I used Craisins instead. The combination of carrots & Craisins made this dish a winner!  I'll be enjoying this again & again.

The raisins were the best part of this! I also added some leftover veggies I had lying around: leeks and zucchini, and a bit of plain yogurt right before adding the raisins. Amazing! I will definitely make this again!

I used whole wheat couscous and found the combination of sweet and savory very pleasing and intriguing. I really enjoyed this dish. I used all water though because I didn't want to open a can of chicken broth just to take 1/2 cup out. I used golden raisins.

I altered the recipe based on other's comments.  My butter is soy/dairy free since my son has allergies to both.  I didn't put as much onions and isntead of raisins; added corn cause I didn't want it sweet.  I did do 1 cup no chicken stock and 1 cup of water with a pinch of sea salt and it turned out very tasty.  Both of my kids actually enjoyed it.

I made this but used Craisins instead of raisins.  It was a little bland but good.  I added salt and pepper.  Next time I would prob ably use 1 cup broth and 1 cup water.

I made this today and loved it. I didn't add any butter just extra virgin olive oil.
Tip: it's worth soaking the raisins in water or orange juice before cooking. I used water and then added the water to cook the couscous 
As the couscous I had was ready in a few minutes, my vegetables weren't as tender as I would like. Just make sure the veggies are cooked before-hand.

As is it would appeal to people with a lighter palette. Like others, I boiled the carrots and raisins in the broth after a light saut√© of the onion in butter. UNLIKE others, I used my chicken broth booster magic,  "Better than Bouillon" (comes in a jar, its a paste, keeps is fridge and it's recipe magic!) and an extra dash of turmeric and it was definitely the trick ticket.

I followed this recipe; however , it was bland! So I added a special Indian spice mix, chopped dried apricots, a dollop of white yogurt and shook chilli power over it all!

Great recipe. Used whole wheat couscous for mine. Turned out good. I added in some peas and onions to give it a little more flavor and a little more crunch. Left out the raisins. Quick dish, simple to make. It did need some salt as it was a tiny bit bland, but other than that I don't have any complaints. Thanks for sharing this with us.

I made this the other day and thought it was really good. I was skeptical at the combination of onions and raisins, but they went so well together. I made as directed and next time I would add some extra salt to the cooking couscous. I served this with lemon pepper sole and the flavours went well together. We finished it off tonight by adding mayo and cooked chicken to make a very tasty salad! Thanks for this one!

I really wanted to like this but it was terribly bland.  Too bad, it looked fabulous.  I recommend using all broth and no water, and it is in desperate need of salt and pepper.

I loved this recipe but made a few small changes.  I grated the carrot rather than diced and with a slight crunch it was a nice texture overall.  Also, I grated ginger and added some garlic along with lemon juice to the carrot mixture (as I did not have any oranges at the time) and chopped fresh parsley to the couscous when finish.  Salt and black pepper to season along with olive oil substituted for some of the butter as a healthier alternative.

This recipe is extremely simple no-fuss no-muss recipe ready in minutes. I would add a little more "something" next time to give it a flavour punch depending on what the main dish is.

I make this whenever a quick and great dish is needed.  For my tastes, I add a lot more raisins and carrots.
