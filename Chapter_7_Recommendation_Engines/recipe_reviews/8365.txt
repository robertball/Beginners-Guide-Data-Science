Wonderful pumpkin recipe. I made 12 big muffins and used muffin liners instead of making the loaf. I baked for 25 minutes and they were perfect. I like to freeze them and then thaw one out at a time so I can bring them to work for lunch. I didn't add the extra nuts on top or put the glaze on them either and I didn't even miss it. Taste best when heated.

Giving this only four stars because the spice amounts are wrong. Should be 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. My mother made this for years, recipe came from a pumpkin company. With the correct spice mix, this is a 5 star recipe.

This was really good.  It was easy to make, and we really enjoyed it.  I've made it a couple of times now, and one of them I substituted the chocolate chips with raisins.  Very yummy that way too.  Made the house smell wonderful!

Wow!  My house smelled great while I was baking this!  I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips.  This makes a big, heavy, delicious loaf of bread.  Thanks, Marsha!

My husband was very excited about this cake, until I told him it had pumpkin in it.  Then his face fell.  I wasn't looking forward to his reaction to the cake as I'd already suffered criticism over dinner, but when he tasted it he just went crazy.  It was like he couldn't stop eating it.  We finished over half the loaf that night.  It's the best cake I've ever tasted, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Oh wait, I did change a couple of things.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and left out the chocolate chips and walnuts, because I wanted a more gingerbread-like flavour.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp baking powder as I didn't have any baking soda.  I think next time I may add raisins in place of the chocolate chips and walnuts.  I think they'd go well with the taste.

Good except to much nutmeg. We used raisings instead of choc chips also. Will make again with less nutmeg, & salt. Would add a little more cinnamon.

My house smelled wonderful as this was baking.  Have made this several times.  I now add a bit more pumpkin and use mini chocolate chips.  The larger chips were too much chocolate.  Good for brunch.

This is one of my favorite holiday breads, my mom would make it every year and I would gobble it up. We always wait until the next day to cut it- so it would set. The other thing we do is lighten up the glaze by using milk instead. That way the glaze would not be sticky, and we can wrap it up for gift giving.

Disappointing! Dry, too much salt, not sweet enough, and could use some cinnamon in the batter. This recipe is more like a quickbread than a cake. I won't bake it again!

I may add a little more sugar next time as it wasn't quite sweet enough for me.  I prefer pumpkin breads sweeter. Great glaze! Overall, lots of flavor and it was good.

I followed the directions exactly and the outcome was not quite as moist as one would hope.  It also was not as sweet as I would have liked it to be.  I am going to experiment with different recipes; as I would not make this again.

This turned out really great. I did health it up a bit and used whole wheat white flour, homemade organic applesauce for half the butter, I halved the sugar and I used organic eggs and pumpkin. I did add a teaspoon each of vanilla and baking powder and I used pecans instead of walnuts because my family does not like walnuts. I actually made these into twelve muffins and just divided the topping evenly between the twelve muffins. These turned out perfect--quite moist and very flavorful even without the excess sugar. EDIT: My husband liked these pretty well, he ate six himself last night. My oldest boy at three for breakfast this morning!

This is really good. I haven't made it in several years, I just found the print out of the recipe card when I was looking for something else at home. I'll have to make it again. I do remember it well, though, and remember that I didn't ice it and it was still super good. I also made mini loaves to give as little gifts.

Good recipe! I have made it twice now. The 1st time I made it just as it said, but the second time, I thought I'd try pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices it called for, the cinnamon added a really nice flavor, I think I'll do it that way from now on. :-)

Instead of eggs and butter, i just used more pumpkin puree! Plus I used spelt and flaxmeal instead of all-purpose. Super tasty!

We enjoyed this bread, but it is a little dry.  I think that there are better pumpkin breads out there that if you simply added chocolate chips to would be better than this.  The glaze is awesome and I don't think I would have liked the cake without it.  I would agree with a previous reviewer that this is more of a quick bread than a cake.  It is, however, a beautiful cake with the glaze on it.

As others suggested, cut salt to 1/2 tsp, increased cinnamon to 1tsp, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves.  Also substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts, and included the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Still has autumn earthy flavor, but a little lighter, not quite as dark as the original nutmeg and walnuts.  Did use nutmeg and cinnamon in the glaze, makes you feel like you are enjoying a cool late autumn day.

awful! The recipe should say ONE HALF teaspoon of salt, not 1.5 teaspoons of salt. 
I've made harvest loaf many times from my Mother-in-law's recipe, but couldn't find hers today. So, I grabbed this one, thinking it looked the same. It is - except for the error in the salt measurement, but that made the difference between a delicious harvest loaf and an inedible salty mess.

Turned out really well!  I used half the salt, and replaced the spices with McCormicks pumpkin pie spice mix.  I baked it for an hour.  Next time I'll use mini chocolate chips, put in fewer chocolate chips and increase the nuts.

I'm giving this a 4 stars only because there's a typo in the amount on ingredients.  This recipe is close to the one I have inherited EXCEPT it only calls for 1/2 tsp. salt AND for 1 tsp. cinnamon for the batter.  I usually use the entire can of pumpkin instead of just 3/4 can, and I  make 1.5 of the glaze for a large loaf.  I'm not a big pumpkin fan but I love this recipe!  This time, I made 7 mini loafs (probably could squeeze it all into 6 mini loafs with longer baking time) using a double batch and I baked them  for ~35 minutes.  It's looking good so far!  Hope my coworkers will like them as I'm giving them as gifts this year.

Best pumpkin loaf recipe I've ever made.  I made this loaf for "coffee hour" at a retirement home.  Made two other loaves as well (a banana loaf and an apple loaf) but this was the most popular one.  Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe!

This cake has been a holiday tradition in our family for over 35 years.  I believe my mother got it in cookbook she obtained while we were stationed in Germany. "Our" recipe includes 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  The chocolate chips in the recipe make the cake just sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.  I've given the cake as gifts to co-workers an casual friends during the holidays over the years and it is ALWAYS a big hit.  I've never met anyone that didn't really enjoy it.  In addition to including the cinnamon into "our" recipe, we also have been known to substitute 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves.  The substitution doesn't seem to affect the flavor to any measurable degree.
