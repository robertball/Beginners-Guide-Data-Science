I make this quite a bit but I used BLSL chicken breasts instead of skin on chicken pieces, I flip flop the apricot jam and dijon mustard amounts. and I also increase the curry powder to a full tablespoon. I like to serve this with vegetable fried rice or a vegetable stir fry and steamed white rice. Great for a quick weeknight dinner. NOTE: This is also good with pork.

Delicious!  I used 4 chicken breasts instead and didn't marinade as long and it still worked perfectly.  Lower cooking time to 30 minutes if using just the breasts.

This was really good.  I made it for 100 people for Mothers Day Brunch and got a lot of compliments.  I thought the marinade was too sweet before I poured it on so I added more dijon mustard to it.  I discovered later that I didn't really need to do that because the spices balance out the sweetness perfectly.  I am not fond of chicken on the bone and next time I think I will try using breasts as someone else had suggested.  The spices on this recipe are perfect-don't change a thing!!!

Great tasting chicken. Once suggestion, double the sauce and don't forget to cover the chicken while its cooking. The extra sauce is good to pour over the rice, and tastes even better the next day.

We all loved it.  Very flavorful and easy to prepare.  If just cooking breasts, reduce cook time to about 30 minutes.

Wow!  This is one fabulous recipe.  I used boneless chicken breasts pounded thin and poked with a fork to soak up the marinade.  I put all the ingredients along with a little minced garlic into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day.  I grilled this vs. baking and it turned out moist and delicious!

I am giving this four stars because I think it has real potential.  Maybe it is just our taste buds, but we thought the Dijon mustard totally overwhelmed this dish.  My husband and I could hardly eat it.  That said, the underlying flavor of the apricot and honey was so tantalizing that I am going to try this again using regular mustard and maybe a little less of it.  I doubt I could make any honey-mustard chicken now without adding the apricot jam.  Thanks for the great idea!

This was easy to make and a big hit. I made the dish with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, to great results. The juice makes a great gravy. :-)

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I thought that the next time that I made it, I would add some chopped cashews to add a little crunch.  It was really tasty though and very filling.

What an easy and delicious recipe.  I used homemade pear jam since thats what I had on hand.  I think any light colored fruit jam will work.

My cousins and I loved this dish when we tried it late one night. The apricot jam was hard to find, but worth the trouble. Served over a bed of rice, this chicken is amazing. Oddly enough, it even works well with mashed potatoes! It was perfect for our movie night and we plan to use it again and again.

OMG!  What a great recipe!  I switched the quantities of the apricot jam and the dijon mustard, and it was SUBLIME!  I joined this site specifically to comment on this recipe.  So so so so good. I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I don't even like mustard and I LOVE this sauce.  I will make very often, that's for sure.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Husband enjoyed it and so did I. I used thawed chicken tenders and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Next time I won't bake them as long- they came out dry.

Wonderful dish!  I would suggest, as others have done, to make more sauce than the recipe calls for.  We cut the recipe in half but made the whole amount of sauce.  That turned out perfectly.  Enjoy!

My husband and I thought this was good, but we wished the sauce had been thicker.  I followed the recipe as stated, although I had intended to add some garlic for extra flavoring.  I probably won't make this again...there's so many other easy chicken recipes to try on this website.

Great recipe Carol. It's now one of the few my husband gives 5 stars. We've had this a lot and even given the recipe to my mother in law which she served the family a while back. My own mother used to make something similar but I don't think she put apricot jam in it. I've discovered, however, that that's one of the best parts as it adds a slight twist to the flavor. One suggestion; double the sauce because you'll want more for your rice and it doesn't seem to be enough for me. Thanks again.

This wasn't bad. Not my favorite, but an ok way to use up some leftover ingredients. If I make it again, I'll probably change it up some and marinate longer than an hour.

I cooked the chicken whole in a george forman roaster. I seasoned the chicken with the paprika, pepper and curry-then glazed it with the sauce several times during the cooking proccess. It was very very yummy! Husband loved it! 1 out of 2 kids devoured it, the other one wasn't to interested in eating but she is only 2 1/2. Will make this again for sure. I will most likely try it with skinless breast next time.

Excellent flavor!! I used cubed blsl chicken breast and hot madras curry powder. I added a bit of cornstarch slurry to the final product for a thicker sauce. As I said before the flavor is incredible for such a simple dish will be making this one again!!!

This was really good! Just a few basic ingredients that went so well together. The end results were a hit with my picky family. The dish looked so nice when done. I served with some steamed brown rice and fresh asparagus. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe. Everyone should give it a try. They should be well pleased.

Even though I only marinated for the 1 hour minimum, the chicken was very moist and full of flavor!  Was great served over rice as suggested.  Definitely a keeper!

This is ok. I kinda wanted it to come out more like a glaze. The chicken had flavor but it came out a bit soupy.

I didn't  get to try this, husband ate it all.  So the rating is based on him.  I made a little alteration:  I  let it marinate for an hour and rolled the chicken in crushed cashews before baking.  It was very good.  O, I also used dark meat, since he won't eat anything else.

I've been making this dish for a few years now and it's a family favorite.  The only thing I change is using boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  Cooking time depends on the thickness of the breasts.  The sauce is delicious on a bed of white rice.

This sauce is excellent! After cooking the chicken most of the sauce/marinade was gone. So I heated up another batch of sauce so we could spoon it over our rice. To cut down on fat I used boneless, skinless breast.

My family and I love this dish.  I made it as written the first time, but I felt that it wasn't flavorful enough.  Having made this more than 10 times, I now eyeball all of the ingredients.  I increased the amount of curry and paprika to our liking.  I also use chicken tenders instead of bone-in chicken.  This dish can be thrown together in 10 mintues and ready to eat in 35-40.  Great for a quick meal any night of the week! I serve this chicken with rice or mashed potatoes.  Doubling the sauce makes for a delicious gravy!

I usually make homemade chicken soup for sick kidletts but this looked more interesting for the "faker" who was dying of an unknown mystery tiredness illness. Needless to say, he recovered nicely as soon as I made this chicken at lunchtime, and also after a nice nap while I cooked. Hubby & his younger sister also enjoyed the "leftovers" I did not have to make for dinner. Very good!

Loved this quick marinade/sauce.  I used boneless/skinless chix.  I just tossed all of the spices in with the other ingredients, doubled the curry (love the stuff)and marinated about five hours or so.  The apricot is so delicious.  Nice weeknight recipe, thanks for sharing with AR!

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  It was good, but I might go a little easier on the curry next time.  I didn't get the pure "honey mustard" flavor I thought I'd be getting... the curry was too strong.

Per reviews I halved the amount of chicken but kept the sauce the same and also baked in a covered casserole dish. The sauce had a great flavor to it. It was pretty oily from the chicken skin, though. And the skin was soggy. The sauce was also pretty thin. Next time try removing the skin and coat with flour before marinating.  Garlic mashed potatoes and green beans amandine went well with this dish.

I loved the flavor of this and after reading the great reviews I tripled the sauce because I love it on everything.  I used chicken with skin which gets pretty greasy.  The flavor was really good and my whole family loved it, but the sauce was a little too greasy to pour very much over side dishes.  After it sits overnight in the frig I will skim off the grease and it will be terrific.  Great sauce--I will use it on boneless, skinless breasts too.  Love it!

This was excellent!  I halved the mustard for my picky husband and used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I also didn't have time to marinade as I was doing this last minute . . . it was absolutely delicious.  I am looking forward to making it again, but marinading it.  Oh, and obviously I did not cook for an hour, just 20 minutes.  Sooooo good!!!!

Oh my gosh, this is very good!  Marinated for about 4 hours and basted about every 15 minutes, cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  So tender and juicy, not too sweet, not too mustardy, perfect!  Will make again!

I read this wrong and added about a tablespoon of curry and about 3/4 cup apricot preserves.  It smelled strong but the taste was fabulous and we're not that fond of curry.  UPDATE:  My family complained because the sauce ended up slipping off the chicken and really not flavoing it. I decided I would cut chicken tender into bite size pieces, cook them a little in a frying pan with oil then add the sauce to the pan.  It works out really well.  I may add a red bell pepper, toasted sesame seeds, a little soy sauce, whatever.  I may leave out the curry and mustard and add soy sauce and  Thai Kitchen sauce.  I even used a little maple syrup once because I didn't have honey.  It cooks up in a frying pan very quickly and doesn't require the oven so is great in the summer months.  I serve it over rice.  It's really good.  I had never considered chicken and apricot jam before finding this recipe so thank you Carol for a vertile and delicious recipe.

I used boneless breasts and didn't have time to marinate, so I seasoned as directed then browned in a skillet then poured the sauce over and baked. I didn't have the apricot jam, but would like to try it again with it. Although, I am afraid to change anything because my picky picky husband said it was delicious...a word that I didn't know was in his vocabulary! This definitely will be in the rotation. Thanks

This was very good: my son kept spooning more sauce from the pan over everything on his plate.  I tripled the sauce recipe for 3.25 lbs of split chicken breasts (on the bone) and added a little cayenne pepper to balance the sweetness.  35 minutes in the oven at 350 was plenty to bring the chicken to the right temperature.

This was a really nice dish that was super easy to make. I don't really like curry but DH loves it. So I thought this was a good compromise, a dish a bit of curry in it.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  So easy and delicious.  The only change I make is that I don't add the apricot preserves, since I never seem to have them on hand.  I either substitute orange marmalade or omit the fruit jam altogether.  Either way, the recipe turns out beautifully.  Yum!

This was a very good recipe, but I added ﻿1/4 tsp each  powdered red pepper, crushed red pepper, and cayenne pepper.  It really helped to balance the sweetness.  I also added 2 Tbsp of Sake.  I marinated it for 1-1/2 hours, then baked it for 45 minutes.  Then I tossed it on the BBQ for 10 minutes to carmelize the sugars.  That made all the difference!  My husband especially enjoyed it!

Variation: Cut up chicken breasts in strips; marinate in recipe. Put on skewers and grill or broil. Very good!

I cooked this meal with rice and was so totally impressed with how this meal turned out.  I added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.

My family enjoyed this one. I made one change. I sprinkled a little sea salt on the chicken along with the curry, paprika and pepper. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which came out very tender and juicy, and unfortunately, more fatty. I will try breast meat next time.

I made it exactly as stated, except I doubled the amount of marinade and poked the chicken first before putting on the marinade. In the oven for about 30 minutes, turned the chicken over and basted it with the extra sauce so the chicken stay moist. Served it with white rice. Will do it again!

I followed this as written and loved it.  I've also used peach jam when I didn't have apricot and it was also very good.  I've used BSCB and I think I from now on.  I had an extra breast left over and a lot of sauce so I made a whole second dish the next night.  I cut up the chicken, added half-n-half to the sauce to make it creamy and poured over the chicken and cooked pasta.  It was a whole new dish and the family loved it.  This is saved in my recipe box....thank you!

My rating is for the sauce, as I used boneless chicken breast and changed the method a bit (seasoned chicken, sauteed to brown, then added sauce and finished in oven for maybe 15-20 minutes).  The reason I gave 4/5 is the honey-Dijon doesn't click right for me; I think yellow deli mustard goes better perhaps? Loved the apricot jam in there!  Also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes across the chicken before placing in the oven.  Served with curried couscous and peas, and naan brushed with garlic butter. Thanks, will try again!

Only thing I did different was use breasts instead of a whole chicken. Great flavor! Not too sweet. My husband DESPISES any kind of fruit or sweetness for dinner. This meal got a thumbs up AND a request to be in the rotation.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Too sweet, for my tastebuds. Chicken breast was dry & sauce was not enough to pour over rice.

I really liked it the first time, but it isn't as good rewarmed the next day...  I didn't have a whole chicken, so used boneless/skinless breasts. I made a few slits in them before adding the seasonings and marinade. I really liked the mix of flavors.  Served with some rice and mixed vegetables; a very nice and easy meal, especially since you can prep it ahead of time.

I did not have apricot jam when I made the spur of the moment decision to make this so I used a homemade peach jam (not made by me, of course!).  My husband has declared that he LOVES the sauce and the seasoning.  

I was concerned about the jam and honey, but nope, not overly sweet at all. Next time, I am getting the apricot jam just to see the difference, but this is going in our "SUPER EASY and STILL AMAZING" file. Awesome!

I prepared the ingredients exactly as stated. The only changes I made were 1) to use chicken thighs instead of breast 2) because of the lack of time, I did not get a chance to marinate them. Despite these changes, the chicken came out beauitfully browned, with the hint of mustard, sweetness from the honey and the boldness of the curry just rounding out the taste. My husband is not a fan of "sweet" entrees, but he loved this chicken. And it was so simple to make!

I would definitely make this again - flavors are great!  Except (hence only 4 stars), I'd saute the chicken just to get some color on it and then use the mix to baste rather than marinade and not assume it needed the whole hour. Mine turned out swimming in a watery juice and the meat was dry the first time.

This was a great variation from traditional honey mustard chicken.  My husband enjoyed it and my picky 3 year old devoured it.  The only reason it is not a 5 star recipe is that the sauce was too sweet.  I added extra curry powder to give it a little kick, but, next time I will cut back on the honey, or the jam.  

All that aside, it was great and I will make it again.

This was ok; didn't impress me, but was just fine and very easy to prepare.  However, I rounded up to 4 stars because I changed the recipe a bit based on what I had on hand and I'm not sure how that effected flavor--used a mustard that tastes more like Chinese hot than Dijon and real Indian masala instead of curry powder, plus used boneless, skinless breasts.  I'll keep this in my arsenal for when I really need an easy dish.

So good. I did not have any jam so I threw a can of drained apricots in the blender.Added 3 Tb of it instead of jam. Served it over brown rice. I never cooked with curry before so I ,made 1 pan with curry and 1 with out. No one could taste the difference between the two.  Next time I will add more. Will make often. I don'y think I'll use the jam, it sounds too sweet. BTW I used a bag of chicken legs deskinned. Easier to portion control and cheap.

Delicious! I forgot to defrost the chicken the night before and forgot about dinner altogether... so, I only "marinated" it for 5 mins or so... BUT, it was still very delicious! I think mustard and honey cannot wrong. Will be making this again!

This was very tasty and fairly easy to make.  Used chicken thighs so only had to bake for 22 minutes.  Served over rice and it was great!

This recpie was so amazing! I started to have second thoughts about the apricot jam, at least until we tried the finished dish. All I have to say is this will become a well used dish in my household.

This was a quick and tasty dish.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts but kept everything else the same.  Very similar to other honey/mustard/curry chicken dishes, but I did like the addition of the apricot jam - it gave it a bit of sweetness.

I approve of this dinner! I love having dried cranberries with dishes like this so I added them in. I loved the hint of apricot and was also very glad I tried a new honey mustard dish. Aside from adding the dried cranberries, the only other thing I changed was I didn't have enough dijon mustard (Oh Horrors!) so I used some cpicy brown to finish the recipe. Thanks!

I didn't have dijon so used a mixture of regular french mustard and Jack Daniel's and it was tasty but not enough bite, so I will definitely use some dijon next time.  The apricot jam was a nice touch, my family loved it, no leftovers!  I liked that the spices are sprinkled on the chicken first and that there's no salt, so good for low-sodium diets, although I had no cayenne so substituted with paprika. Again, I'm sure that's why it lacked bite.  You definitely have to keep basting. I baked at 350 for the first half hour and 325 for the next half hour, because I used a glass pyrex dish (and I didn't want the glaze to burn), and then cooked it for 10 minutes longer (all chicken legs, no breast). Came out just right. Thanks!

I'm just learning to cook with curry, to me, a little bit goes a long way. I thought this recipe was GREAT! I  cut up boneless, skinless chicken breasts and served it over jasmine rice....delicious! It made a nice sauce and was so moist and tender, and I only marinated 1 hour.

Great, easy chicken recipe.  I made this with chicken breasts and reduced the cooking time.  The curry adds a nice touch to the sauce.

I made the recipe as instructed except that I used boneless chicken breasts.  I love honey mustard, but I guess I just don't like dijon mustard...it tasted like horseradish.  The mustard ingredients did not list horseradish, but I could taste it for some reason. Other than that the chicken was moist and came out as it should I suppose.

A really tasty honey mustard flavor. The ingredients blend together nicely. If you like honey mustard that has a more mature flavor vs. a dipping sauce flavor, this is the recipe for you!

This was very good. I used boneless chicken breasts cut in half (3 large ones) and only needed to bake for 40 minutes. I also substituted orange marmalade for the apricot jam. Very nice flavor! Served over rice. My kids enjoyed it too!

I love this recipe. I made a few changes in preparing. I cubed my chicken, breaded it, and then cooked it.  Afterwards adding the ingredients to make a sauce. I added that to the chicken and served over rice. DELICIOUS.  My 19 month boy also loves this!

We really enjoyed this. The only reason I won't give it five stars is that I thought it was a tad too sweet. Maybe a little more mustard next time but will definitely make again.

Great recipe! Easily adjustable if you like it sweeter-add more honey if you like the mustard flavor better- add more mustard. I made the sauce thicker by adding cornstarch to it when it was all done cooking.

Not a big fan of curry... but wow! This was just great. Followed the recipe to a T... except I used boneless chicken breasts and it was just wonderful. Made a finishing sauce of the 2 parts jam, 1 part honey & 1 part mustard.  Really really good. Will try it on the grill next time!

This recipe is a real "kid pleaser". As others suggested, I doubled the marinade. Versus using chicken parts I used about 2-1/2 lbs. of chicken breast. It came out moist and delicious.

Both my husband and I LOVE this recipe.  I use orange marmalade and chicken legs and thighs instead and I don't marinade it because I usually don't have the time.  It comes out superb every time and I have made it several times.

I've been making basic honey mustard chicken for years, but these extra few ingredients took it from good to super! It does need at least another 15 minutes of cooking, though.

this is definitely a keeper since my hubby devoured it.  I used a pineapple and guava jam instead of apricot and it was yummy.  Hubby's only request: make more sauce next time.

This is delicious.  I doubled the sauce so there'd be some for the rice.  Everyone loved it.  Will make this again!

Very good.  Doubled the sauce, used boneless chicken breasts, marinated 2 hours, while cooking basted every 10 minutes until done.

Didn't measure the curry and paprika mix, just coated the chicken in it, and no marianating - loved it!  Fruity topping does tame the curry, but the mustard flavor was lost.  I'd like to fry the coated chicken next time, and I will be making this again!

Everyone in my family hates mustard-even honey mustard- except me. I made this and didn't tell them what was in it. They LOVED it. Yes!!! Very subtle mustard taste and yet so flavorful and moist. The combination of flavors makes something more than honey mustard. I used two large breasts and four thighs and cooked 40 minutes. It was wonderful for lunches with salad the next day too!

I used the SLBL chicken breasts as suggested and marinated in the refrig. most of the day in the  seasoning rub and apricot mixture.  Added a dash of Lawrey's  garlic salt and baked as directed..   Served with roasted acorn squash seasoned with butter,  brown sugar, cinnamon and chopped pecans.  Of course the chicken was sliced and served over rice.  Hubby enjoyed the dinner as well as our two Havanese dogs and an elderly cat.

1/8/16:  Really good and easy.  Used 4 chicken breasts, doubled the curry and added minced garlic.  I used peach preserves instead of apricot jam. Marinated for a couple of hours. Covered for  the first 30 min then uncovered for 20 min.

I used three chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and marinated this overnight.   I baked them for 30 minutes.   I would definitely double the sauce to use over rice.  This made for a tasty dinner.

Great recipe. I used chicken legs. At first I excluded the curry because I couldn't picture it mixed with honey and duck sauce. But, when the chicken was almost done, I tasted it and felt like something was missing. I added curry and to my surprise, it made it so much better. I initially added a bit of salt and Goya Adobo seasoning to ensure the right amount of flavor I like. My picky 6 year old eater loved it, too.

My husband loved it, although I'm not sure how he could have tasted it considering how quickly he scarfed it down! I added 1/2 tsp of garam masala in addition to the red curry powder. I wonder if red pepper jelly would make a good addition... hmmm... Will definitely make again.

Needed a quick dinner when getting home from work.  Didn't marinate, added the curry powder to the honey, mustard & jam, put in a plastic bag with pounded chicken breasts to coat, then grilled.  Turned out great!

This recipe was very tasty. As many has said, you need to double the amount of the recipe for the sauce if you like to put some on top of the chicken when you are done. I served it with white sticky rice. I only got to marinade it for 30min but it still came out very moist. The hubby agreed. YUM!

I have made this many times without the apricot jam (just what I prefer).  This is an outstanding recipe and EXTREMELY delicious!!!  I have had many guests claim they didn't like honey mustard chicken after I informed them what it was!  When you can help someone enjoy something they didn't before you have the perfect recipe! 10 stars if I could!

My hubby loved this chicken. I grilled it and served it with baked sweet potatoes. I found the original recipe didn't have enough marinade for all the chicken. Plus I didn't have any apricot jam so I used some chicken broth and added more honey and mustard. It turned out great! WILL MAKE AGAIN

My family LOVED this. I added  dried apricots to the final 15 minutes to add flavor since I didn't have time to marinade.  Next time I would reconstitue the apricots before adding them.

I liked this ok. It really has a unique taste because of the combination of the curry and apricots, but DH did not enjoy it much. I only give 5 stars when he goes back for seconds. :-) I did add a touch of garlic, and in the future I would reduce to maybe half as much curry, as it is such an overwhelming spice.

I used this recipe on a whole chicken.
My husband and I gave it a 5 star!
It really was great!

Tasty and easy to prepare. Personally I would use much less curry next time or leave it out all together. I'm not a huge fan of curry but I still enjoyed this dish.

This is a very good recipe and perfect for guests. I recommend using chicken breasts cut into stips, prep the night before and marinate overnight in fridge. Double the recipe for the marinade and you will not have to baste during cooking. Needs no attention while you visit with guests. Have made on many occasions and several friends now request!

Excellent chicken!!  Good with salad and rice.  I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, then dumped everything in a baking dish.

Very easy and the chicken was very moist. Even my husband, who hates chicken on the bone, liked it.

Wow!  Two Thumbs Up!!  I only changed one thing and that is instead of using 1/2 tspn of curry, I only used 1/4 tspn.  Nonetheless, the flavor was outstanding!  I will definitely add this dish to our meal list.  My husband and 5 year old LOVED it!  MMMMMMMM..........YUMMY!  :o)
