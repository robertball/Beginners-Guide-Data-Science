The egg rolls were delicious. I would not change a thing about the rolls. The sauce had to fixed after following the exact recipe. The full lime was too much and the sauce was watery and very acidic. Maybe the lime used was just larger. I will definitely make this recipe again, but next time add the lime after all ingredients are added and blended then add the lime juice to taste.

The filling was terrific, but baking instead of frying resulted in cracked and split egg rolls with a  noticeable undercooked flour taste.  As much I like the idea of less oil it didn't work for me.  So 5 stars for the filling, and 1 star for the cooling method and presentation equals a 3

I did not make the dipping sauce but the egg rolls were good.  Nothing outstanding.  I did add more cumin and chili than it called for, seemed a little bland.  I also added a layer of fresh spinach.  Very quick and easy so I'll probably play with this recipe more.

While I agree that some cracked in the oven, the taste made up for it. I added green onions and garlic to the avocado mix. Also I only used 1 lime total. Half each for the sauce and egg rolls. The sauce was pretty good though missing something on its own, but worked with the egg rolls. Everyone loved them and Iâ€™ll definitely make again. The flavor and the fullness factor made this a 5 Star for me

I loved the sauce but the spring rolls didn't turn out well for us, they were just okay.

I searched for a recipe for southwestern egg roll after loving the ones at target and constantly having difficulty finding them.  I tried this recipe and it is now one of my requests that I get from my family. I used the exact recipe, absolutely no modifications were needed.

Don't overstuffed them and maybe brush with oil instead of using spray

I made the recipe exactly as directed and they were delicious. Yes, the egg rolls were not as good as fried but a much healthier option. The beauty of this recipe is the dipping sauce is versatile as well as the filling. I made a burrito bowl using all the ingredients adding some tomatoes, cheese and lettuce with the dipping sauce and it was delicious. The dip would be great as a substitute for ranch dressing for a veggie dip. My suggestion is to play around with the dipping sauce, adding the lime conservatively until you reach the level that you like.

I substituted some avocado for the mayo in the sauce and also added some diced spring onion and pepper to the egg roll mix. Agree with another reviewer that baking is less tasty then fried, but these turned out good enough to do again.

The problem with this is that the egg roll wrappers did not bake thoroughly on the inside and were raw which ruined the whole thing.  The dipping sauce is delicious, though!

These were pretty good! We had leftover carnitas, so we added that to the filling. I think there might be too much avocado as the consistency seemed a little mushy, even with a little meat in it. Otherwise, I may have filled ours too full and may try rolling them smaller next time.

We brushed butter over the egg rolls before baking, which turned out well. Overall, we'll try this again. Thanks for sharing.
