I LOVE baked pears as their flavor becomes extremely rich. With the glaze they were outstanding. Very tasty served with whipped cream and some sliced almonds. 16 servings means each person gets a quarter of a pear. Must have been an error.

Everytime I see this recipe in my recipe box I laugh. I gave it 4 stars because I think if it is prepared properly, it will be awesome! I made this as directed, but my "baking sheet" was rimless - which translates to hot honey all over the bottom of my oven! Next, I did not have (or know what it was) pomegranate molasses, but I did have regular molasses...can you see where this is going? Well, the molasses taste was over powering, but I was determined to eat these potent pears anyway. Everything else about this recipe rocked! Just be sure to use a rimmed baking sheet and please do get pomegranate molasses - it is not the same as sorghum molasses. I will make these again (correctly) because even with the problems and substitutions, I knew it was a good recipe.

I just used the honey and cinnamon on the pears. And sweetened the whipped cream with honey as well instead of sugar. It was wonderful!
