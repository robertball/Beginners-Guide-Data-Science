I cut the cranberry juice by half for a thicker smoothie consistancy. I also used vanilla greek yogurt. I really loved this smoothie so much so that I've made it two mornings in a row. For me this is ONE serving when reducing the amount of juice.

I followed Sarah Jo's recommendation and cut the cranberry juice in half to make it thicker. And because I like a thick smoothie I think I'll try it with Greek vanilla yogurt next time - regular 2% vanilla yogurt was too watery for my liking. I also omitted the protein powder since I find it unpalatable - I don't think it would've made that big of a difference in terms of thickness though. In all it was a great smoothie recipe and will definitely be a go-to for me!

This had a tad too much of a yogurt taste for me so next time I will reduce the amount a bit. Otherwise loved the fruit combination! Thanks for sharing your recipe!
