This is a really good shortbread cookie recipe.  The only change to the recipe that I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla.  For the topping, I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and spooned it in the middle of each cookie.  I also sifted the cookies with powdered sugar after done.

My family absolutely loved them and my kids enjoyed putting on the thumbprints.  My husband suggested I could also use the large side chocolate chips instead of the frosting.

Delicious!  I was looking for an eggless recipe as my fridge was running low on groceries and this recipe fit the bill.  Cured my sweet-tooth in a bad way!!  I also used Splenda instead of sugar and it still turned out great!

not the shortbread taste I was hoping for... more like biscuit dough than cookie dough.  Would probably be better with real butter, vanilla, more sugar and less flour.

I found these cookies to have an excellent flavor, but they were hard to shape. I added a little bit of water and that seemed to help. Next time I make them I will probably add even a little more water. These are very versatile. Instead of filling them with chocolate frosting, I filled them with peanut butter and then dunked them in chocolate.

I made this one late night when I couldn't sleep and was board on the internet... Its a pretty easy recipe to follow and would be fun to do with little kids, because of it ease of making (I don't have a mixer so I have to mix by hand) and not needing too many things to make it...   I can understand how people can find it tastes like flour and so solve this problem I added a little vanilla, and about an extra 1/2 cup of sugar ( just free poured and tasted till it was a little sweet) I didn't add pecans because I don't usually have any on hand, so instead I put a small teaspoon of Raspberry Jam before baking them in the oven...  I put them in a preheated over at 300 degrees for 10mins then took them out and let them cook on the stove off the heat of the pan. I finished them off with a light sprinkling of icing sugar.   Not sure how they will turn out and if they will be a hit with the roommates as other recipes have been off this site so far but we'll see.

This turned out perfectly! I modified the recipe a touch. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1 3/4 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also used jam instead of the chocolate frosting. They are extremely delicious and have a nice shortbread crunch!

I replaced the sugar with Splenda. I found the dough to be a bit dry with the recipe as written, but adding a little butter or subtracting a little flower solved this problem. I also used sugar free raspberry jam instead of chocolate. They taste great, and mine came to about 60 cals a piece!!

I did not use nuts and used blackberry preserves instead of chocolate.  Not very sweet at all. Oh and added vanilla flavoring too. Most likely will not make again.

I used real butter, added a little more sugar....but I should have cut back on the flour like someone else suggested. They do taste too much like flour and about half fell apart after baking. I did add flavored jam..at least they were edible. But I wish I could find the recipe that I used awhile ago...

These cookies came out terribly tasteless.  I used a total of 1/2 c of sugar after reading some of the reviews and vanilla.  I did make a batch w/o nuts and I highly recommend using nuts.  don't think I will make these again.

This is a good recipe.  The cookie is not too sweet since it only uses 1/2 cup of sugar.  Instead of the frosting, I used chocolate kisses cut in half.  My grandkids will love these!

As a shortbread cookie, I thought these were good. I used butter, not margarine. My dough was a good texture for a drop cookie.  I used 1/2 cup sugar after reading several reviews. They are delicate and crumble some when stored. I think that is the nature of a shortbread cookie.

These are delicious cookies. I followed the recipe  exactly, but after I finished mixing, the dough was very dry and crumbly. As per another baker, I had to add 1-2 tablespoons of liquid to hold dough together. (I used heavy cream.) You can also use milk or water.

I made this recipe this evening, well something very similar. My version called for 1cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 2 cups flour, 1/2tsp salt, 1/2tsp baking powder and 1tsp vanilla. Pulse all in food procesor until like pie crust. (Normaly you would add chocolate chips and press into a 9x13 pan. That didnt work for me either...it badly stuck to the pan even after greasing it.) I attempted to use my version and make thumb prints (with choclate chips in the print)...Well those didn't turn out so hot either, they spread out like pancakes while baking, they did not hold their shape at all and look like no  thumb print was never made. Can anyone help?

These are great to make with kids.  My husband loves them because they're not too sweet and they're so simple.  The batch size is small enough that we make them frequently.  My 4-year-old loves to make the thumbprint!
