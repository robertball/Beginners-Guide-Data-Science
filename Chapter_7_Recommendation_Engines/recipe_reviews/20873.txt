While making this, I reduced both the puree and the tomatoes by 1/2 and was glad I did.  Fish was good, flavorful and very tender (but not too tomato-y).  My husband enjoyed it, and he's usually hard to please.  If I made it again, I would keep the same changes, and also add a bit of cayenne pepper.

very good, perfect for the summer.  I could have stood just a bit more flavor but I am not sure how exactly.  A wonderful health addition to anyone's summer menu.

I used sole filets for this recipe, omitting the tomato sauce just adding more tomatoes. I left out the sugar as well, I just couldn't understand why I needed it. I also reduced the oil considerably. Thank you for the recipe.
