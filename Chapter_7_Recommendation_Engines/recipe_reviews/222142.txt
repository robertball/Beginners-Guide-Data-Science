I'm so glad for these people that are health conscious! I changed a lot with this recipe, and I'm giving it 5 stars based on what I did with it. So here goes. 1) Use Greek yogurt. Much better for you, and makes the cookies moist and rich. 2) Use wheat flour. No reason to use white flour (which is as bad - or worse - for you as sugar is). With oatmeal cookies, you won't be able to tell a difference. Well, only slightly. ;) 3) Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Which brings up another point: use unsalted butter. :) 4)Toast your nuts before-hand. I toast mine in a 350 degree oven for 5-10 minutes. That will bring out all of the nut's crunchiness and nuttiness and flavor. I used pecans. You can use any kind of nut you want! 5) Roughly chop the pecans and cranberries before adding them to the batter.  I love the addition of the carrots! That is pure ingeniousness. 6) My cookies needed much longer to cook. 7) A neat addition to these cookies is peanut butter. That's up to you.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, "MakeItHealthy"!

These cookies are great! My husband is always asking me to make "healthy" cookies, and he absolutely loved these!  Great job!

pretty good, but a little too chewy, yet somehow dry.  seemed like it needed more flour.  Will try again and probably tweek some more...Will update review/notes when I do that.

Made as described except I used 4 oz of coconut Greek yogurt instead of plain as that is what I have on hand.  The cookies did not spread out in the oven so after the first batch I pressed them down before baking.  I just tasted one from the first pan and I think they are a little bland even considering all the flavors that are in them.  I think the recipe would benefit from a little salt (I did use unsalted butter as I do for all baking).  DH, who I really made them for, didn't like them either and has taken them to work (those folks will eat anything!).  Sorry but I won't be making these again.

This cookie is amazing! I followed the changes suggested by Mary Elizabeth. I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and dark chocolate chips.

Really good. I used Truvia in place of the sugar to make it even healthier.

Very soft and yummy! Even the kids loved them. I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 of the butter and raisins for the cranberries. Will make them again, thank you!

these were good, the only difference I made was instead of the yogurt I put applesauce just because I had some to use up.  my 4 yr old daughter liked them and she's my harshest critic.

It is delish! They were a bit too sticky to roll into balls, but spoon drops worked fine. Next time I’ll use more flour, and I used coconut yoghurt instead of regular.

This is now my new oatmeal cookie recipe to use it’s very good.  I did add sunflower seeds, ancient grain mix, wheat germ in place of a cup of the oatmeal to use them up. I also used whole wheat flour.  I liked adding the carrot too.

These are delicious!! Definitely take the advice to leave them on the sheet to cool for a bit. I had trouble with them sticking, so I lightly greased the pan.

If you like chewy healthy cookies, you might like these. If you're using unsalted  butter, I suggest you add a little salt. It's a little bland.
