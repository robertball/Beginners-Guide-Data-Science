I agree that these are more like a biscuit - the dough is "spongy" and they really puff up.  I used orange extract instead of vanilla and my kids loved the flavor.  I will keep looking for a sugar free cookie recipe, but will keep this for a sweet biscuit snack.

This dough was easy to work with.  I used it for my granddaughter's school class because the school prefer's goodies that are good for you.  They ate them up.  I did frost them and decorate them.

Very bland.  More like a biscuit than a cookie.  Definitely needs sprinkles or icing to liven them up.

I added cocoa to this recipe and made bunny cutouts for my diabetic MIL for easter. No sugar free bunnies to be found. The only change was two table spoons cocoa . I used a splenda cornstarch & fatfree milk glaze to drizzle over them it dried nicely and the cookies were enjoyed by everyone.

This "cookie" is so bland.  I added lemon zest to add more flavor.  Also it puffed up.  Texture of it is not a cookie.  I will not be making this again
