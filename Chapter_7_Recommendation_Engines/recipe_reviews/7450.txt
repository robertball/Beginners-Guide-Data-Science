Here is how to make the icing: 1 stick of butter 3/4 cups sugar(regular) 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1 cup flaked coconut Boil sugar butter and milk for 2 minutes. Add coconut. Spread icing on cake while icing and cake are hot. Enjoy!

This cake is fabulous! I made it as directed including the butter glaze another reviewer mentioned (with the exception of the coconut as I didn't have any on hand). My kids had 3 pieces each (normal limit is one but this cake was so good none of us could stop eating it) and my 5yo DD exclaimed "This is the best cake I ever tasted!" This cake doesn't disappoint - plus it's very easy. Definitely 5 stars!

Do not add too much of the liquid from the fruit cocktail - will make the cake too moist to cook thoroughly

This cake is great. I had the recipe and lost it while relocating to another state. There was a butter sauce with coconut that is poured over this cake and it makes it heavenly. Wish you had posted the sauce recipe as it makes the cake. The fruit cocktail should be totally drained in the recipe I had. Thank you for posting this. I'll watch to see if anyone else has the butter sauce recipe to pour over it. Thanks!!!

This is definitely easy but I didn't think it had much of a taste. Perhaps it was the fruit cocktail that I used? I guess go for a good brand or cut up your own tasty fruit. Pineapple and peaches tasted good.

I needed a recipe to use up some friut cocktail. So I was attracted to the easiness of the recipe. I baked it as cupcakes for a bake sale. This was the comment from my husband..."This is the WORST Thing you have ever made. " It didnt do so well at the bake sale. So needless to say I will not be making it again.

This recipe didn't go over well at our house. We all found it tasteless and bland. It needs salt vanilla...and probably spices such as ginger or nutmeg or cinnamon. However the texture was very nice and the topping was good. Because this cake had no flavor I made a butter/brown sugar/half-n-half butterscotch sauce to pour on top. That's the only thing that saved it. I think it'd be a pleasant little coffee cake if salt and spices were added to it.

Easy quick cake to make! Good for a last minute get together or pot luck. I made the icing recommended by another reviewer and it was the perfect addition.

I made it and did not make any changes. The cake was very dry and not moist. My husband poured rum over it and said that made it very good. I would make it again if I knew what to add to it to make it moist.

It was very sweet but at the same time tasteless. I would never make this recipe again. I'm going to look for another recipe for Texas Tornado Cake since I heard it is really good.
