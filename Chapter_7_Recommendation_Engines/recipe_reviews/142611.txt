I made so many changes to this that I'm not even sure it's fair for me to review it, but here goes!  I shredded the jicama, added about a cup of cilantro (I love cilantro), added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of freshly shredded ginger, about 3 tablespoons freshly ground dried ancho chile peppers, two granny smith apples --shredded, and about a half cup of mayo.  It was delicious.  I have no idea how the original recipe was, but what I made went perfectly with the grilled pork tenderloin that I made.  I put this salad (more of a slaw after it was shredded) right on the pork tenderloin sandwiches.  OMG.  It was delicious!

I like this salad alot! It is super crunchy and uses very little ingredients! The leftovers last and because there is no lettuce - it doesn't wilt. The Jicama does not turn brown after exposed to the air. Very nice and light!

I love jicama, lime and cilantro. This recipe is fair as is but should go one of two ways: spicy or sweet. For spicy I like other reviewers suggestion to add ground chili and/or garlic. For the sweet option, I drizzled about 3 tablespoons honey on top after tossing everything together. It would probably disperse more thoroughly to mix the lime juice and honey together before adding to the jicama. With the sweet version I will also cut back on the cilantro next time, possibly in half. I would also like to add other fruits to the salad independently - watermelon, mango, strawberries, red grapes. The contrast of the deeper colors would look striking in this salad. Honestly, 2 pounds of jicama makes a really large salad so why not divvy it up and try a couple different versions at the same time!

I made this recipe to accompany my enchiladas, rice, and beans. It was great! It's always nice to have something fresh (besides salsa) to go along with Mexican food.

A fabulous simple recipe!  I couldn't stop eating it!  Used more cilantro than the recipe called for because we love it.  I found this recipe searching for what to do with the leftover jicama that we used in soft tacos and this is a great way to use it up.  Now I will buy jicama on a regular basis and fix it this way.  Everyone needs to try this!

I was searching for this recipe after eating at a dinner party. My hostess used the same ingredients only she sliced oranges (removed skin an pith) in rounds.  Sliced the jicama thin in the same shape as orange and collated them on a platter, sprinkled the cilantro across the top and drizzled the lime juice.  Maybe we all didn't find it bland because it offset a very spicy meal. It cool and refreshing.

Refreshing and worth repeating! I changed it up a bit.  I added equal amounts of fresh pineapple (julienned) with the jicama. I used the pineapple juice and lime juice combined with a very small bit of veggie oil.  I also minced some jalepano pepper and added it with the cilantro to sit and absorb.  Next time I may add some julienned carrot to give it a bit more color.

I would rate this recipe as is a 4 star rating.  I make mine a bit different,  I like the slice of the jicama, it is pretty, I add the jicama, lime, salt and no pepper, instead I take 2-3 jalapenos halved, seeded and thinly sliced, or fresno chilis are lovily too, and I mix this together, taste to make sure the seasonings are spot on. Now for the cilantro, I do not chop my cilantro, as this bruises the leaves and tends to add too many of the stocks, I take the moment or so to take the leaves off the stock.  Right before this is to be served, toss the cilantro in, saving a bit for the top....and to make it pretty and even taster, I like to add some garlic infused olive oil. just a slight drizzle on the top and than sprinkle the remaining cilantro on top.  SO refreshing and pretty!!

I really liked this, very simple. You have to have a taste for jicama though as my wife and one of our guests didn't love it.

Great salad...very refreshing. I always have to add a little garlic.  I think this salad is to taste in all the ingredients.  Everyone loved it and many wanted the recipe.

Picked up a jicama at the grocery store because I wanted to try it since I had never tasted it before. This was the only recipe I found that had everything I already had at home. Didn't change a thing and it was delicious! Thank you

Maybe we didn't have the right 'taste buds' for this one. Ended up throwing it all away. The lime was over powering.

Good side dish to serve with other Mexican food. It was a little boring for me though, that's why I gave it 3 stars.

Unless you REALLY like cilantro, it will overpower this recipe.  I used 1/2 of what it called for.  I also added a large can of mandarin oranges (cut in half) and added about 1/4 cup of the mandarine orange juice instead of the lime juice.

I had such high hopes for this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and I just didn't care for it.  The jicama was very watery and the combination of flavors was very odd.
