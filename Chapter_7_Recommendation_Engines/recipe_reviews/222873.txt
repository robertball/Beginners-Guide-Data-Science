Admittedly, I didn't try the recipe as written.  I've had cola-flavored slow cooker meats before and it wasn't amazing, so I decided to substitute a bottle of Pinot instead.  I also used a spiral-cut ham, which I think helped infuse it with deliciousness.  BEST HAM I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  I marinated it in the pineapple juice and wine for 24 hours and cooked it for 9 hours while I was at work.  I'm searching for a recipe that can use the leftover juices because it was that delicious.
This was really simple to prepare, cook and serve that I'll make it regularly.

I've made this for years - it is delicious but I've always used Coca Cola which is also sweet!

I thought this had a strange aftertaste. I'm sure that this isn't the recipe but the cut of ham, but mine was ridiculously salty.

We always use orange marmalade in place of the cola and add Maraschino cherries secured with toothpicks through the pineapple rings. My family adores their Easter ham this way!  We also use a boneless ham too as my family are not huge fans of fat and prefer clean ham slices with the glaze.

Next time I will use a spiral ham instead of a picnic ham... I also added butter and light brown sugar to make a glaze on the top of the ham

I've made this for years, but I use 7 up instead of a Cola. and also have done this very low in the oven for up to 10 hours or until  the meat is pulling away from or falling off the bone but not drying out while basting every 1/2 hour....
