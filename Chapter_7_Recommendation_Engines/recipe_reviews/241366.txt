This recipe works quite well. The dough doesn’t seem like it will come together, but it does. Just keep mixing. Don’t be tempted to add water. The cookies don’t puff up too much and this helps when you want to decorate them. Thank you for the recipe.

My daughter is allergic to eggs, but I really wanted her to be able to make cookies for "Santa". This recipe was simple and tasted great. I did add about 2 tbs of water but that may be because I used real butter instead of vegan margine. Thank-you for providing an easy and tasty recipe that my daughter could participate in making and enjoy!

I made these with about two table spoons of applesauce. It gave it just enough moisture to really bond it together. They cook really quick and spread out a lot. Yummy!

this is an easy and yummy cookie that tastes just like sugar cookies I had growing up.   The dough was a little crumbly and delicate, but other than that perfect.  I topped with a vegan butter cream icing and sprinkles.

these turned out so well! made them for my best friend who is vegan, they have never had a vegan sugar cookie before that they liked. Was a total hit with these ! not a single cookie or crumb was left behind. did find even after being in fridge for 2 hours, it was too crumbly to roll and use cutters.

nice, not too sweet cookies. My dough was too crumbly so I added about 1/2 cup of warn water after it cooled for 3 hours.

They turned out much better than expected day of. All of the 9 kids loved decorating them and they held up well. Very hard the next day and pretty crispy about two hours out of the oven but a positive experience overall.
