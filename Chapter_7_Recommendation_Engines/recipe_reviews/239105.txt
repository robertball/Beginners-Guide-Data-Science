If you ferment your own sauerkraut or buy it as a live ferment, you know that cooking it will remove the probiotic benefits of the ferment. You can solve this by using the recipe as specified and adding the kraut at the very end, allowing it to warm in the dish but not cook. This will give you the excellent flavors, but with a  crispier texture, a brighter taste, and the benefits of your ferment!

If you will microwave your potatos a few minutes just to soften them a little, they'll fry much quicker.  Don't cook them all the way through in the microwave, they'll end up mushy.  Let them cool a little after the microwave, then chop into smaller pieces for your skillet.  This works well for general baked potatos too.  After the microwave, just pop them in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes and they'll taste like they've been in there for hours.

This was a delicious recipe. I made a few changes based on the   advice of  reviews and personal preference.  I   microwaved the potatoes to speed the cooking. I browned the sausage and browned the potatoes sans added oil.  I also added a sliced carrot to give color and flavor.  One reviewer suggested a more limited time of warming the sauerkraut.  I added the kraut last and warmed for only 5 minutes on low -medium heat using homemade chicken broth rather than ale. (had no ale or beer on hand, but don't think it would have added much to the flavor).  The kraut I used was Bavarian style and sweeter than other varieties.  It was very flavorful with the mustard and sausage.  Warm and filling on a winter evening!

For some reason, my potatoes did not want to cook and this ended up going a lot longer than recommended.  That said, it was a warming comfort-meal on a cold night, and as a sauerkraut lover, I'll make it again.  We used a gluten-free hard apple cider and the combination was delicious!

Follow the recipe except didn't rinse the saurkraut. This is yummy!! Just throw a lid on a few minutes while sauteing potatoes and they cook fine. Simple and delish. Used turkey smoked sausage.

I had an extra package of sauerkraut I needed to use up and chose this recipe. So glad I did. So easy, not many ingredients and everyone loved it. The ale is such a good idea.

This is really good and easy. However, visually it was quite "beige." It looks like the main photo has some parsley or other green garnish that makes it more visually appealing. I wish that had been in the ingredients. I will make this again, but will add something green to spruce it up.

Hillshire Farm, thank you for this fantastic and comforting recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee!  I did have to cook the potatoes a little longer on my gas range to get them nice and brown on all sides.  I also added about another cup of sauerkraut, because everyone in my family loves it.  I used Guinness beer and it added a nice depth of flavor.  It truly tasted like a traditional German dish!

I precooked potatoes in microwave as other suggested worked super! I also prepared this meal in a wok (better heat to cook the sausage) and I only used 6 oz of ale (Blue Moon white wheat ale). The only thing I would add is caraway seed. I made this last night as sausage n kraut is one of my favorite comfort foods and I LOVED it!!! Thank you!! :-)

The potatoes and sausage turned out really good, but the sauerkraut tasted awful. I usually like sauerkraut so I am not sure if it was the beer I used or what. I used Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale. Probably won't be making this again.

I used Kielbasa instead of smoked sausage, instead of vegetable oil use canola oil and changed out the grain mustard to French's mustard.. After done cooking, I sprinkled 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of pepper on top. Then add parsley. Doing that, I slammed it out of the park! So I give this recipe, in it's original instructions, a 4 star, because I'm bias and the substitutes I used made this meal better!

This is a very quick way to get your German craving taken care of!   One very important note:  I wonder how many people really know what "whole grain mustard" is?   Google it, you might be surprised!  It is not Dijon or spicy brown.   It has a bite to it and looks nothing like most "sandwich" mustard.   Do yourself a favor and make sure you use the right ingredient for this recipe!   It DOES make a difference!  I would also like to add that thanks to another reviewer I have made this with canned sliced potatoes (drained).   While I prefer fresh, when I am in a hurry they work very well with this recipe!     Smithwick's (Irish Ale) works well here.   Also, if you substituted bacon for the sausage and added some onion AND used true whole-grain mustard, this would be similar to German potato salad.

Quick, easy, and delicious. I used canned potatoes, and a good quality yellow mustard.  I will make this again.

It was delicious. I used hemplers hot links European sausage, sweet potatoes and bubbies sauerkraute. Potatoes took a bit longer to cook but still turned out delicious. I added about three cracks of pepper to potatoes.I also used shock top Belgian white ale. Might be even better if you put a bit of grey poupon mustard in there. I also really like mustard so.. But the mustard seeds didn't come through as I though they would.

Good recipe. It takes longer than 20 minutes. The beer cooks off quick, but your potatoes should already be done by then so don't worry.

I made this tonight for supper. And, of course, I made a couple of changes. No ale...used chicken broth. And because we are big eaters, I used more than 1 cup of sauerkraut (and rinsed it), more than 2 cups of diced potatoes and added a little pepper. I barely measured the grainy mustard, but it was juuuuust enough:) My family loved it! Toasted crusty and buttered bread on the side. Yummy!

I made this two times. I used spicy brown mustard, which might have given the dish too sour of a taste. I used PBR beer because I thought a hoppy ale would add to the sourness. I added the sauerkraut at the end and just mixed it in warm. I microwaved the potatoes, covered, chopped, for 3 minutes per 2 cups(2 cups turns out to be one large potato) before cooking which helped get the potatoes soft before the beer cooked off.

If I make this again I'm going to try adding a little bit of sugar(brown sugar maybe) or something. With the sauerkraut and mustard, the dish is quite sour(I do like sour though) and I think it could use a little sweetness for a more complex flavor. Maybe a honey mustard would be better or a sweeter(non-hoppy) beer. I also recommend doubling the recipe for 4 people as the portions of the original recipe were not very big. I added 3 minced garlic cloves, but I don't think it did much to the flavor.

Really delicious and quite easy! I would agree with the other comments about maybe microwaving the potatoes a tad before putting in pan, I had to let mine simmer much longer than 10 minutes to get them soft / editable. Overall though great dinner! I used turkey sausage for a slightly lower fat option.

Excellent!! I added some salt and pepper and used whole grain Dijon mustard from trader Joe's. I also cooked my potatoes for 5 minutes in the microwave before dicing them and adding them to the pan.  I served this with Hawaiian rolls and my family gobbled this up!

Yummy! My husband and I loved this recipe. I was worried that the amount of mustard would overpower the flavors but it blended perfectly after the last 10 minutes of cooking. (I used Jalapeno & Cheddar sausages because we like spicy.) Will definitely make again.

Was a great alternative to your basic pan fried smoked sausage and a side dish.  My husband devoured it!  I appreciated the one dish meal and the combination of flavors.  Give it a try, I think it's a keeper!

So easy to make and full of flavor. The only changes I made: I mixed Tabasco Roasted Pepper Sauce into the Frenches Mustard (gave it a smoky taste) and I forgot to pick up a bottle of ale to go with it. But it tasted great!

I used this recipe as my base. I took a lot of reviewers notes and used honey with dijon mustard. I boiled the potatoes and tossed in some chopped carrot for 10 minutes before I put them on the pan to ensure tenderness. I also sauteed some onion, green peppers and mushroom to the dish. It turned out pretty tasty. I used a can of Miller Lite for my ale, which was fine, but I bet a hard cider would have been perfect.

It was good! Just make sure you cook the potatoes enough. I'd recommend adding in the Sauerkraut near the end so as not to cook off the probiotics.

Good recipe but a little bland.  I added a healthy dose of Montreal steak seasoning and some green pepper.  Next time I will brown the sausage. Nice for a weeknight dinner, easily put together

I made this and loved it. I didn't have any beer since my husband drank it. So I had to use beef broth in place of it. Next time I will add more sauerkraut and some onion.

Didn’t love it. Not sure why, just not what I expected. Had to add cayenne to give it some flavor. Didn’t seem like a dinner meal.

Made it as stated using Alaskan Amber. Was def something different, which is what I was going for, but I didn't love it. Husband and I both thought it was ok but it's not something I'm likely to make again.

I was disappointed in this. It sounded so good, but I just didn't care for it. The potatoes got mushy, the sauerkraut was tasteless, and it had a bitter taste to it. I used Guinness draft for the ale. Perhaps I cooked it too long?  I followed the directions exactly.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and for some reason we weren't crazy about it. Perhaps the beer we used (an IPA) was too strong.

Excellent, definitely a keeper. Followed the recipe except that I didn't use my favourite ale. I used an IPA that I had no intention of ever drinking. I drank my favourite ale as I devoured the finished dish. I also used dry mustard as that was what I had on hand. A winner and I still have the rest of that IPA for a repeat.

Simple and easy. I only had an IPA and next time I make it I'll definitely use a heavier dark beer, other than that what you see is what you get, pair it with a hot toddy and you'll forget it even snowed!

Very flavorful and delicious. Only problem is it took an extra almost 30 minutes for the potatoes to get tender. I agree with Jen's review, next time I will microwave the potatoes first.

It's was okay....I think it was the ale I used, it just made it bitter at the end. My husband added ketchup to his plate and it was ok...He said he'd eat it again, but without the beer next time. It did need some salt.

Yes since I do not use alcoholic beverages in my foods,   I did make a double batch and added 2-12 ounce cans of Sprite, and for the 4 tablespoons of whole grain mustard , I use 2 tablespoons of regular mustard and 2 tablespoons of  mustard seed.  We love it.  So good.

So easy. Tatse great!  I added a little raw onion and half an orange bell pepper to the sausage when cooking. I also uses Bavarian Sauerkraut. I didn't have Dijon so I used mustard and mixed in mustard seed. I used Bud Light and it is good!

wanted something different and this is the meal. Loved the combination of smoked sausage, potatoes and saurerkraut. I think the mustard was what gave it the zing. This recipe is a keeper.
