I enjoyed this desert. I added cinnamon and brown sugar. And there was a large amount of juicier from the peaches so I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to help thicken while baking

I did add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 1/2 cup sugar into the fruit, other than that, I followed the recipe. It was pretty tasty!

This recipe was very good and very easy to make.  the recipe didn't thicken like the recipe said which turned out OK since we served it with vanilla ice cream and everyone wanted some of the juice on the ice cream.

Just made this recipe with a few minor adjustments (as other reviewers suggested) such as adding 2 tbsp cornstarch to thicken juices; worked like a charm. I also did a 1/4 cup brown sugar with a 1/4 cup white sugar to equal the 1/2 cup sugar. Sprinkled cinnamon on top of crumble topping. Took to a friend's home to share and everyone enjoyed! I will definitely make it again, but perhaps I will make a little more of the crumble topping (such as 1 1/2 times the suggested recipe). A delicious impromptu dessert!

This is really more of a crisp than a cobbler.  However, the recipe was quite good, and I would definitely make it again.  There was none leftover at all.

As others suggested I did add 2 Tbsp  of corn starch and about 1/4 Tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I also did a mix of 1/4 C of sugar and 1/4 C of light brown sugar.  This combination worked well, and everyone really liked it.  There was none left whatsoever.

I found that adding a 1/2 cup brown sugar to the crumble makes it a lot tastier. My family and friends go wild when I make it!

Great recipe but i didnt add the blueberries. I did seperate the juice from the peaches first, mixed them with some cornstarch, cinnamon, and brow sugar. Then i re-added the juice and the crumb mixture. Came out delicious!

I added milk and promenade juice to it since the mixture was dry. No peach juice because husband drank it so I was improvising. It smells wonderful and I can not wait until it is cool enough to eat!

Used thawed frozen peaches with frozen blueberries - probably the fastest dessert to put together and it's delicious! Looking forward to trying this with other fruit!

I love to cook but do not bake very much as I usually guesstimate measurements which I know you shouldn't do when baking.  Saying that, this was so simple to put together and tasted wonderful!  I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN!  However, the recipe wasn't clear to me as to adding the juice from the peaches so I added all the juice making the filling runny.  The mix of the peach juice and the blueberries made a great tasting syrup which was good on the ice cream served with the dish.  Next time I will not add all of the juice so it won't be so runny.

Added a bit of cornstarch as others had suggested, and a splash of natural vanilla extract to the peaches. And fiddled with the topping a bit too, stirred in some brown sugar and a handful of oats to it and probably should have used more and softer butter, I'm sure next time I make it, it will be a bit different than this time too...  but for a quick and easy something special to make this is a sure keeper!!
