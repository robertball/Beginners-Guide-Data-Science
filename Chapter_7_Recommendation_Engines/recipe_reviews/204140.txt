I thought the cake was a little bland and entirely too sweet. However, this is a good base to start with. The texture was very nice and dense. I think I'll try using some spices and almond flour (instead of the extract) and try cutting the amount sugar in the cake next time.

Bland and way too dense. Even with simple syrup it's still missing something.

Absolutely delish. Reminds me of Puerto Rican birthday and wedding cake. Love it. Not overpowering sugar just the right amount for the almond to stand out. Buena receta! We even ate the crumbs!!!!
