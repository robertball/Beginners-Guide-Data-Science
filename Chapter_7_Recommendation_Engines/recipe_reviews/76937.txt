This is one of those dressings that you have to play with a bit to get the desired taste and consistency you want.  I used all light/reduced fat ingredients and opted for the rice wine vinegar vs. the lemon juice as it's a bit on the sweeter side. I did add a bit more buttermilk and this definitely needed some fresh chives and dill - a generous helping at that. I let everything set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors blend. In the end, with those additions it's a really nice salad dressing to top mixed greens and grilled chicken!

This is a nice buttermilk dressing.  It was no thicker than a bottled ranch, and I thinned it down slightly by adding a little more buttermilk.  I thought the lemon flavor was a bit to strong, so next time I'll either cut back on that or try the rice vinegar to see what that's like.  My very picky daughter likes it and that means I'll be making it again and again!

I made this dressing for a large bowl of pasta so I tripled it, except for the lemon juice.  I just added 6T of the lemon juice, and I also just used 1T of Spice World Minced Garlic in the refrigeration jar.  We liked this blend and will use it again.  However, I enjoy the dressing on the pasta a few hours ahead of eating it in order for the flavors to permeate throughout the pasta.

Given the tang of the sour cream, buttermilk and mayonnaise, I questioned the necessity of adding any lemon juice or vinegar at all, let alone the rather hefty amount called for.  I left it out completely.  So glad I did.  I also knew this would be too thick for me so I doubled the buttermilk.  Perfect.  Finally, I knew this dressing would need a serious flavor boost – so I added fresh chives, dill and parsley.  What started out as a rather mediocre, too acidic dressing became elevated to five stars.  Skip the lemon or vinegar, give it a burst of flavor with some herbs, and thin as necessary with additional buttermilk.

I used fresh buttermilk after making butter from our raw cows milk.  I added sea salt and fresh peppercorns from a grinder a squirt of lemon juice, sour cream and mayo.  It was very good!  This time I had to use store bought mayo and sour cream next time I'll try homemade.  This will be excellent for thanksgiving and everyday dinners.  Thank you!

I forgot to add the lemon juice or vinegar, and I added a generous amount of Italian seasoning, along with several grinds of fresh black pepper.  It was a little thick, so I added buttermilk to thin it out. This dressing improves as the flavors blend, so I let it sit overnight...delicious!!

Delicious on our salad- creamy, old-fashioned goodness. Extra keeps well in a jar in the fridge.

This was super thick & bland to me. I had to add quite a bit more buttermilk, and lots of spices.

This was ok. I added the lemon juice and just a splash of rice wine vinegar. My dressing was actually pretty thin, which was totally fine. It just did not have much umph. I added quite a bit of dill. Fresh would have been much better but all I had was dry.

Quite bland. Should be obvious from the lack of chives, onion powder, dill, parsley, etc.  Many other buttermilk dressing recipes on here that are vastly superior.

I enjoyed this dressing very much.  As for it being thick, that’s an easy fix by adjusting the amount of buttermilk.  I agree with what someone else said that the lemon juice/vinegar seemed a bit much at first taste.  But after an overnight rest in the fridge all the flavors married together and it’s great.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a simple recipe and so very tasty. It reminds me of the buttermilk dressing you'd find at Cracker Barrel.  So glad to have this.  This will be my go-to recipe for a creamy dressing.
YUM!

Used garlic powder (what I had on hand) and used red wine vinegar. Delicious! Might up the lemon a bit next time.

Made much snappier after adding lots of cayenne, juice of a whole small lemon, parmesan cheese, onion powder, spike,dill and some of my favorite chunky blue cheese dressing. Make my own sour cream so this was thinner; but addition of blue cheese dressing thickened it up perfectly.  Best to let sit overnight, I think. Thank you for this great recipe which is wonderful to tailor to your own taste!/arnetage68
