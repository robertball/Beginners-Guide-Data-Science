I tried this recipe did not change anything except using double chicken, rice, broth and wine to serve 4 whole breasts. I thought this was wonderful! So did my family! Used a very dry white wine, it was awesome! I will use this very easy recipe again and add it to my collection! Thumbs up on this one!!!!

This dish was pretty simple and easy. I was afraid it would not have much flavor and was right about that. I did add carrots and a little celery to the rice for color and some veggies. I cut the recipe in half because there is only 2 of us. I will probably try this again and try adding lemon pepper for more flavor.

Not a big hit at our house. Made as written, results were bitter. The taste of rosemary is overwhelming. .However, the concept is good. Might make again using different herbs.

I thought this was pretty good.  However, the rest of the family thought it was a but bland. I am a total boiled chicken kinda girl, so I guess it depends on what you are looking for, if you will like this or not.  I would eat it again.  Thanks for a pretty good recipe.

I made a slight change by setting the oven to convection roast @ 350F.

I took it out after say 40 minutes, removed the chicken and stirred the rice around a bit.  Put the chicken back and finished up after 20 more minutes.

I used thighs instead of chicken breasts, but the main problem was sort of rubbery chicken skin. Next time I try this I will somehow remove the chicken near very end and broil it for maybe 5 mins. to crisp the skin up.

My whole family loved it.  I substituted with brown rice, low fat mayonnaise and cooking sherry to make healthier .  Will definitely make again.

I followed all of the directions except I used chicken breast tenderloins. The chicken was good, but the rice ended up being too salty, although I did not add any salt to it. I might try it again, but I'd use low-sodium chicken broth instead. At least it was easy.
