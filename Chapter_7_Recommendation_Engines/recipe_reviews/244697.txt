I love Chef John and wanted to give this recipe 5 stars but it's dry.  the crust is fantastic and you can't go wrong with figs ans goat cheese.  I used fresh figs and maybe they weren't juicy enough but I felt the dish was dry trying to eat it.  it really needs a fig or balsamic reduction drizzled over the top to set this dish to 5 star level.  I will definitely try again and add the reduction.
