This stew came out really good, but there are a few things that I changed or would change in the future. Most importantly, I would make a proper rue instead of the oil/flour mix. My stew had a slightly floury taste that could have been avoided if I cooked the flour a bit before adding to the stew. I also reduced the amount by half after reading previous reviews.

I added a parsnip and one rib of celery to the stew as well and they both tasted great in it.

This recipe was tasting great until I added the amount of flour and oil the recipe called for to thicken.  It was way too much.  I would make this again, but I will add about half or maybe even less, of the flour and oil mixture.

This is fabulous. I didn't use the oil, just added the flour directly because I am just that good and it was great. I make it all the time.

My husband is from Ireland, so I made this as part of a traditional Irish dinner (NOT corned beef and cabbage!).  He LOVED it and said it was like something that would be served in a nice restaurant in Ireland.  I used half of a 5 lb. leg of lamb (couldn't find anyhting else - it was great!) and froze the rest to use again.  I doubled the beef broth since that was the amount in the container I bought.  I think this was perfect with the amount of flour and oil called for in the recipe.  I used a bag of Yukon Gold small potatoes (no peeling needed!)  I also added 4 stalks of celery, a tsp. of caraway seed (not necessary), and a few more herbs (rosemary, oregano, basil, extra parsley, and sage - didn't have thyme, oops).  Great recipe that will be a staple in our house!

Ordinarily, I am not overly fond of stews, but this one is really great!   I can't imagine cutting back on the oil and flour as another reviewer suggests though - unless you like extremely watery stew.   In any case, I've made this recipe several times as is, and we love it!

I really enjoyed this stew, it hit the spot! I DID decrease the oil-flour mix, and it thickened up just fine without it without tasting floury. I'd suggest making it in 2 TB increments to taste, that's what I did. Slightly more time consuming, but it got me a stew that was thick without a flour taste. :)

A very tasty stew Tim! I used three tablespoons of the flour and three of the oil and it just enough to create a nice thick broth. I also added curry powder to give it a bit of a kick along with my usual garlic and onion powders. Thanks for the post!

This was a really good stew.  Next time I would use a little less flour.  I cooked it in a crock pot on high and increased the cooking time a little.  Seasonings were just right.

Very good!  Even my husband liked it and he is not a fan of lamb (or goat).  I used cubed goat shoulder and increased the liquid quite a bit by adding 4 cups of water to the beef broth. I also added chopped celery, rosemary, and oregano.  Then simmered it for several hours on low.  It was very good!

Followed the recipe mostly. My changes:

Poured jack Daniel's in it during step 1. Added parsley and cilantro. Added green onion along with other vegetables during step 2. Followed advice from another user to make an actual roux vs mixing the oil and flour into the stew.


I love it. Will make it again.

This was the first time I made any kind of stew and it came out delicious! I could never make stew because I couldn't add the flour without the soup getting lumpy but I made an actual roux and added t to the soup and it came out great. I think I had more than 2lbs of lamb since I had to increase almost all of the ingredients but I'm not sure. I just cut the meat off of one lamb shoulder myself and these were the ingredients I changed:

4 cups water
4 tsps powdered beef broth
1 tbsp fresh parsley
1 1/2 tbsp fresh cilantro
 I also added 1 stalk of celery and used half a medium onion. For the roux I used 6tbsp olive oil and 7tbsp of flour.
