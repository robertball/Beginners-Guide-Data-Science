Good meal with some additions/changes.  For all who aren't sure ... NO, you do not need to boil the ravioli first, but I let it thaw for a while before baking (about an hour), but you don't have to do this if you don't have time.  Here's what else I changed.  Add 1 diced onion and 1 tsp garlic to the beef.  When adding the sauce add 1 small can sliced mushrooms.  Use 26 oz jar spagetti sauce (I used Ragu No sugar added Basil Tomato) and WELL DRAINED diced tomatoes.  This gave me plenty of sauce for the layering.  Use the entire package of ravioli and a 9x13 dish.  no need to grease/oil the dish.  after the first layer of cheese I added small dollops of ricotta over entire pan.  Also all cheese measurements need to be increased since using more ravioli and larger pan.  Ended with sauce layer.  Bake 30 min with foil on then decrease heat to 350, remove foil and bake an extra 15 minutes.  After removing from oven and sprinkling with parmesan, allow the dish to cool for 5-10 minutes.  This will make slicing/serving easier.

Mmm, good stuff. I use Italian sausage instead of beef, a whole 25 oz bag of ravioli, and a bag of my own frozen tomatoes. I add chopped onion and green pepper while frying the meat and a 28 oz jar of sauce. Oh, and I double the cheese, 2 cups on each layer. Great with garlic toast and a glass of red wine.

It seems there are some cooking snobs here. Not everyone has the time to spend the entire afternoon cooking dinner from scratch. Just because a recipe is "semi-homemade" doesn't mean it isn't good. This recipe made a quick and tasty week night meal. Thanks for sharing.

Great throw-together meal. I used a whole bag of frozen ravioli, and added chopped mushrooms and garlic to my browning meat. I also added one and a half cans spaghetti sauce. Served with a salad, corn, and garlic bread, and you've got a wonderful meal!!

This was a wonderful dish.  My kids and their company loved it!  I'll definately make it again! And for those of you who want everything from scratch, you CAN make your own ravioli, spaghetti sauce and can your own tomatoes....but for us regular folks, this makes for a wonderful, homecooked meal!
  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Oh. My. Gosh. This was soooo GOOD!!! For all you food snobs out there, us "working class" folks don't have time to make everything from scratch. Shame on you for looking down at us or snubbing a good recipe due to it being "semi-homade" (geezsh)! Because my hubby & I work long hours, we rarely have time to make elaborate meals during the week. When planning this week's meals, I stumbled upon LUVINMYHUBBY's recipe & IMMEDIATELY knew I HAD to give it a try. In order to spend less time in the kitchen tonight, I browned my beef / onion (I added a small diced onion when browning my beef) on Sunday. I then mixed in my sauce / tomatoes (Hunt's balsamic, EVOO & basil flavored) & threw in my (covered) Tupperware Mix-N-Stor pitcher. Tonight, all I had to do was assemble everything & pop in the oven. NOTE: I started to layer 1/2 of my raviolis in my 8 x 8 in. baking dish & by the 2nd (final) layer, I had used the entire bag! That, subbing meat filled ravioli for the cheese variety (hubby's request), adding an onion (as mentioned previously) & not using any Parm (personal preference) were my only changes. There are TWO important things to note here. First, you DO NOT need to boil your ravioli (that would negate the simplicity of the entire dish). If the recipe submitter thought you should, she would have instructed to do so. Second, as is, this takes more like 40 min. to heat thru. Served w/ a bagged salad mix & garlic bread, this was a FANTASTIC and EASY meal! Thanks for sharing! :-)

My guys loved this!!
I browned the meat with 1 diced onion and 2 pressed garlic cloves.
I omitted the canned Spaghetti sauce and instead I used 1 (29 oz) can of Tom puree, 2 (14.5 oz) cans of petite diced tomatoes and 1 can of tom paste. I seasoned it as I would a spaghetti sauce with basil, oregano and a little sugar.
I used a whole bag of cheese raviolis.
My husband said it was better than lasagna! High praise indeed! We have a 14 year old and a 4 year old. They loved it too. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Yep. This saved the day today. Used two bags of the mini ravioli, no extra tomato, and some ricotta with a little chopped garlic between the layers. The kids ate it right up and my husband had a second helping :) The ability to use frozen ravioli puts this one over the top in my opinion. I printed this one out. Thanks!!

So yummy and easy for a mostly pre-packaged meal- fast to put together on those nights when I need to get food on the table.

This is a great quick meal idea.  I had used a spicy tomato sauce along with seasoned diced tomatoes to kick it up a bit.  I also used ground turkey with lowfat shredded cheese because we are watching calories.  It still tasted great.  Definately a repeat!  Thanks!

This was super easy. I highly recommend getting the frozen ravioli from Aldi if you have one near you. They are very reasonable.  Followed the directions almost to a T. Used a glass covered casserole dish instead of foil and used some of the cheese on top. I baked for 20 mins covered then uncovered and popped some frozen garlic bread on a cookie tray for the remaining 10 mins. Next time I would use only 1/2 lb meat because it was a little heavy on the meat for us. Will make this often. Love that you don't have to precook the ravioli first. Not gourmet but definitely satisfying

This was very tasty.  My husband loved it.  It is a great quick alternative to lasagna.  I added fresh muchrooms and doubled the ravioli and sauce.  Next time, I may try adding some fresh spinach.

This was easy.  I used frozen cheese ravioli, frozen meatballs, jar of spaghetti sauce, frozen spinach, a tub of cottage cheese with a beaten egg in it,  pkg mozerella and parmesan on top.   Assembled in two layers and baked, at 350, covered, for forty five minutes. No need to defrost anything first. Quick way to feed a crowd.  Thanks for a great dinner idea!

I can't believe I waited so long to review this recipe. I've been making it at least once a month for a year. I make a few changes to adjust to our tastes - I use the entire package of ravioli, 2 jars of sauce, use the juice with the diced tomatoes and saute some onions and garlic with the hamburger/ground turkey/ground italian sausage (whatever I have on hand). I share this recipe with nearly everyone who asks if I have any good recipes to share - and they have all loved it. Awesome recipe and super easy to make!

A wonderfully easy recipe when you feel like a lasagna type casserole but haven't the time to put it together. Used my own marinara sauce and added more cheese. And for those that would critisize this as not being a recipe but more like instructions on how to open up cans....."Do you really think that all restaurants make every thing they serve from scratch"?

So GOOD! After recently getting married to a Brooklyn Italian. I needed to step up my Italian cooking. This was it! I made it for his Italian Grandparents and they loved it! I substituted ground Italian sweet sausage for the beef and made a sauce from scratch. I also didn't precook the ravioli just threw it all together in the layers suggested with extra cheese. SO PERFECT! It looked like I spent the entire day in the kitchen - little do they know! anyways, Thanks again for such a great recipe.

Yum!  So easy and really, really tasty.  I used ground lean turkey instead of beef, and tripled the amount of sauce.  I subbed two medium fresh tomatoes for the canned, and added a bag of steamed mix vegetables (broccoli, carrot, onion, and pepper blend) into the sauce.  I also added another cup of mozzarella to top the casserole with.

A huge hit in our house, with a side salad and garlic bread.  I will make this again -- thanks!

So easy, and still real food, and yummy :) I used some spaghetti sauce out of the freezer rather than a jar, and subbed ground sweet Italian sausage (the price was half that of ground beef!). I did put the ravioli in frozen...eyeballed the cheese amounts so probably used less than what was called for. This was great, and everyone at the table agreed, so it's a keeper! Thanks for sharing this family pleasing recipe!

This recipe is super easy.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think, as it's written, it needed some garlic and extra seasonings.  So the second time I made it I sauteed some onion and garlic w/ the ground beef and added some Italian seasoning to the sauce.  I bet using the diced tomatoes w/ garlic and basil would be good too.  And it's excellent w/ Italian sausage instead of the ground beef.

I'm new to the kitchen and this was very easy! Incase there are any struggling new chefs out there, I'll explain how I made it!  When browning the beef I used onion and garlic for flavor. (actually pressed my own cloves) which was quite an accomplishment! The recipe doesn't clarify whether to cook the ravioli or not...DO!!!! It's really easy and just follow the instructions on the bag. Once my meat was browned and drained and the ravioli was cooked and drained I layered as the recipe directs. I added a can of tomato paste to my sauce and used a seasoned basil spaghetti sauce(24 oz jar) instead of a plain one. I also added oregano while mixing the meat with the sauce. I used more of everything and when I make this again I'm going to double the meat...it was fine with the suggested amounts but we love meat! Oh, and make sure you cover it in the oven with foil and add the parmesan cheese after baking! Enjoy!

This recipe turned out fantastic.  My hubby likes a bit of spice so I used diced tomatoes w/jalapenos.  It added a nice light spice to it.  He can't wait until I make it again - he's already requested it.

This is such a simple throw together meal! I never thought to bake my frozen ravioli, and I don't think I will ever just boil them again! I used spicy italian sausage instead of ground beef, and also added some sauteed mushrooms. Will definetly be keeping this on stand by for those nights I don't feel like cooking much. Thanks!

To the person who rated this as "This is not a recipe, it's directions for opening cans" obviously you must have time on your hands to make food from scratch every day, breakfast to dinner. For those of us who have lives and live in the real world, it's nice to have an easy "semi-homemade" meal to turn to on a busy day, most of the time there are things in life that are more important to spend time on than making a meal from scratch every night.

I added a small chopped onion and some garlic to the beef as I was browning it. I also used an entire package of frozen ravioli.  I did not cook them just put them in frozen and they came out fully cooked and tender.  Because I used an entire package of ravioli I increased the sauce.  Very easy receipe and will make again.

I've been married for 2 and a half weeks and just made this tonight for my husband and brother-in-law.  They both loved it!  Thanks for the quick, easy recipe!  I cut it in half and made it in a 9x9 pan and used the "cheap" Wal-Mart frozen ravioli.  It made plenty for the three of us!  Yum!

I really liked the sauce/meat part on this. I didn't have time to make the best marinara sauce yet recipe from Allrecipes, like I had planned, but bought a good quality marinara in a jar. The problem I had was with the ravioli part. I also bought a good brand of that to, but it just didn't seem to blend with the delicious meat sauce. I would have just liked the sauce with some spaghetti. The only change I made was using low fat products, although it still has a lot of cheese, so I cut the amount in half. I also sprinkled a little garlic salt on top when done, because the sauce was missing a little garlic flavor.

Pretty good stuff!  I doubled the cheese, halved the amount of ravioli, doubled the sauce and added italian seasoning and garlic to the cooked beef.  With these changes, a pretty good, quick and easy meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, LUVINMYHUBBY!

This was so easy to put together, and very filling.  I do think that next time I make this, I will use a spicy Italian Sausage, and seasoned diced tomatoes for a bit more flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Oh my was this good! The whole family LOVED this! I added some sauteed onions, garlic, green pepper, and mushrooms (needed to use up produce) and it really added great flavor! Will definitely be in our regular rotation! Thank you :)

This is the 2nd time I have made this and with the changes I made it went from a 3 star to a 5 star recipe!  I omitted the diced tomatoes and used a can of condensed Tomato Soup instead.  I also used an entire package of cheese ravioli's, which I cooked first according to the package directions, while I browned the ground beef.  I baked the casserole, covered for 30 minutes; removed the foil and topped the casserole with additional shredded Mozzarella and baked uncovered for 15 minutes until the cheese was bubbly and lightly browned along the edges.  I let it sit for 15 minutes on the counter while I made some garlic bread and tossed a big green salad to serve along with this.  I think letting it sit made it set up and it turned out more like a lasagne (without all the work); not as soupy as the first time I made this.  My family LOVED this!!!!  I love how easy it is to prepare and it will become a pantry meal for me because I usually have all the ingredients to make this in my pantry and freezer.  A great go to meal when I havn't been to the grocery store in a while.  P.S. - This reheats beautifully; the leftovers are fantastic as well!!!

As I often do with Allrecipes, I used this recipe as a base and made a few modifications. The key change for me was in the sauce - I used 1 lb. lean ground beef browned with 1/2 finely diced yellow onion and 1 clove minced garlic. Brown, drain, then add a 29oz can of crushed tomatoes, a 6oz can of tomato paste, 1 tbsp brown sugar, a pinch of dried basil, and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Simmer 30 minutes. For the casserole, I used a 9x13 dish sprayed with cooking spray, and layered basically as directed, but used only mozzarella cheese. I did use an entire bag (24oz) of frozen cheese ravioli - Rosetto brand, very good. I covered and baked this for 30 minutes at 375. It was a hit with both the adults and kids :) I'll make it again.

This is a winner in our house!  So quick and easy to make -- especially on a weeknight.  I ended up using a 26 oz. jar of DelGrosso Pepperoni Spaghetti Sauce, and I only had a can of sliced stewed tomatoes, but it turned out terrific.  Must be a hit with 3-year-olds, because mine said she "loved, loved, loved" it. Hubby and 15-month-old gave it thumbs up, too.

So simple and so delicious.  Great as left overs as well.  My husband doesn't like chunky tomatoes so I put them of half of the batch and just added some more spaghetti sauce to his side so it wasn't so dry.  Very good.

This is an excellent recipe,  I doubled everything but the beef and tomatoes and it fit nicely into my smaller shallow Dutch oven.  I did add ricotta to the other cheeses and used fresh parmesan. I also added a chopped onion and garlic to the ground beef.  Make sure you check the spiciness of your tomato sauce as I should have added more oregano to mine.  A little red pepper would have helped as well but this is a personal taste.  Quick, easy and tasty, and worth five stars.  My lasagna takes all afternoon to make and this is a quick alternative.

Absolutely loved this one!!! Family raved!  I used a whole bag of ravioli and a bit more sauce to compensate for the whole bag.  I did add some veggies to the sauce because I had to use up some mushrooms and onions.  Chopped the mushrooms and onion and sauteed with the meat.  I loved the leftovers for lunch! Yum! Will definitely be making often!

I thought this was very good. The first time I made it, I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except for subbing a can of crushed tomatoes for the diced tomatoes.  I'm making again tonight and will use both ground beef and mild Italian sausage & will season w/salt & pepper. I'm using Prego spaghetti sauce w/mushrooms and will use crushed tomatoes again.  Also, once I add the sauce & tomatoes to the meat, I always "doctor" my tomato-based sauces with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder,  a little sugar (to cut the bite of the tomatoes), and dried herbs (oregano & basil). So good & filling. Can't wait...time to cook now!!!

Allow casserole to "set-up" a few minutes before serving.  I used 2 cups of mozerella cheese, because that is what I had on hand.
Serve with green salad and garlic bread.

Yep, these are good. I have made these with Cheese Ravioli and they are just as good.  I like to make this a day before when I am preparing another dinner as it is quick and easy.  Then let cook for 30 minutes and stick in fridge.  It is then all ready for the next nights meal, just reheat and serve.

This gets 5 stars because it's such a simple and clever dish to put together.  I did follow the recipe ingredients list, but did use a diced tomato that was flavored with roasted garlic and onion.  I also did not drain the juice.  I added a can of tomato sauce to my spaghetti sauce/tomato combo so that I would have enough to make a small casserole for my mother-in-law.  We all enjoyed it.

Really good. I don't usually change the recipe but there didn't seem to be enough sauce for the top. I took one can of tomato soup added pepper and italian spices and garlic powder and poured over the top. It was really good. My kids loved it.

I substituted sausage for the ground beef, couldn't find frozen ravioli, so I used two packages of cheese-filled tortellini (cooked it) and used a package of pre-shredded Italian style cheese. Definitely a big hit.

Browning ground beef, opening a jar, a can and packaged food barely qualifies as cooking and certainly doesn't require a recipe.

Got this in my inbox yesterday, and decided to give it a try.  It was very quick and easy.  I did make a few modifications--added diced onion and fresh garlic to the ground turkey (substitution for beef), while it was browing, added mushrooms and lots of spices to the sauce, (basil, crushed red pepper flakes, oregano etc...).  Made it in a 9 x 13, since I nearly doubled it.  Cooked it 45 minutes, and it probably could have cooked just a little longer.  Served it with a great bread and light salad, made a hearty meal.  Would make again, possibly with more sauce.  It seemed runny when I first pulled it out of the oven, but after sitting a few minutes, ended up looking like a mock lasagna.  Guests liked it a lot.  Thanks!

I like that this was so easy, quick and tasty.  It added a little bit of something to normally very plain frozen ravioli.

My husband and I loved it. I used fresh ravioli and cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I ended up putting the whole can of tomatoes with juice and it still ended up great! Will definitely make this again.

See,  cooking good tasty  meals that are not your ordinary is what it's all about . I appreciate foods like this because  that's what these recipes are and of course we all find those little tweaks to make it our own .But let's not forget it's all about being a community here and sharing ideas without criticism so I always respect the original creator and prepare it by directions  first. 
This is a great dish with no tweaks but everyone has their own tastes,  I appreciate the many ideas I have gotten from this site and hats off to everyone that has contributed a recipe no matter what feedback they have received. 
Keep cooking everyone!

Family loved this recipe.  I had used fresh ravioli and ground veal instead of beef.  I doubled the recipe in hopes to have some left for lunch LOL only none was left.  I found that the sauce was thick which is the way my family loves sauces for pasta.  I added 2 small cans of tomato sauce to ensure that there was enough for the fresh pasta.  Will be making again.

I sauteed 1/2 a large onion and some garlic with the beef, didn't defrost the ravioli and layered the dish then in a 375 deg oven for 45 mins or so.  Easy weeknight meal and a kid pleaser.

A good recipe for pasta lovers. An easy recipe that pleases my pasta loving family. I cooked up 2 Italian sausages, cut into small round pieces which added a little zing to the dish. I also cooked up 1/2 pound of ground beef.  Since I didn't have any jar sauce, I made my own sauce.

Loved this! Did as other reviews said to do: 1 small chopped onion, garlic powder to the meat. Used a 25oz sauce, alittle more cheese and baked in a casserole dish on 450 for 30 mins.

This recipe is borderline cheating on cooking a satisfying weeknight meal.  Frozen cheese ravioli is morphed into a meaty cheesy ravioli in less than an hour.  The recipe is fine as is, but I will add some zip next time with a bit of onions sauteed prior to browning the meat.  Also be sure to salt and pepper the beef while it's browning.  This is worth five stars for the combination of being quick coupled with good taste.

This was a really simple recipe that got a lot of nice reviews from my family. Even as a leftover. It was nice for a quick easy weekday meal. I think to change it up the next time I will use petite diced tomatoes as regular were a bit large and I used mini but will use regular ravioli

This is too much meat. I am starting to treat meat like a side dish and doubling up on vegetables.  Don't miss the meat as a main course....anyway  I just put the ravioli with the spaghetti sauce.   Topped w/ a sliced mushroom and chopped fresh spinach.  It makes a great presentation.  I did not add tomatoes.   I did not use Monterrey/Jack cheese...i think that is more Mexican type cheese than Italian.

Very Good!  I used hot italian sausage instead of ground beef - husband's favorite.  Other than that, everything was the same and it was a big hit.

Thought I would try this for a quick easy dinner and not only was it both, it was also very good. I used the whole package of ravioli because I used a 9x13 pan, along with additional jarred sauce and cheese I had on hand. My family thought I had made homemade lasagna. The leftovers were great in the microwave too.

I loved this, like another suggested I used the whole pkg of frozen raviolis. I also only had a can of chopped tomatoes with green pepper, onion and celery. It turned out great and flavorful, even my picky boyfriend loved it!

This was SO delicious!! My husband wants to make sure that I make this again. My suggestion is to get the Italian Diced tomatoes or add a little bit of Italian Seasoning if you get the plain diced tomatoes. I also used 1 whole package (18 oz) of raviolis.

If I could give 10 stars, I would- and I've never written that on this site before. This was DELICIOUS! My extremely picky 3 year old loved it, and he doesn't eat meat, cheese, or anything that looks "strange". He gobbled this up, so did my 1 year old and a 4 yr old that was visiting. I 1st sauteed onions/garlic/red pepper in some olive oil, added the hamburg to that. I used a jar of Classico Four Cheese Sauce & a can of stewed tomatoes (not drained). That was not enough sauce, so I added a bit more sauce from another can of sauce. I used a mix of mozzerella and munster cheese, about 3 c. total. I used an entire bag of ravioli & did NOT cook the ravioli first, there's no need to do that. I did have it out on the counter while I cooked up the burger though. I cooked at 400 for 30 minutes, covered with foil. Took foil off, turned off oven, and left it in for another 5-7 minutes. Sprinkled generously with parmasan cheese and wallah! I liked this better than lasagna, it was SO easy, inexpensive, and super good. (I got the frozen cheese ravioli at Aldi for a couple of bucks, at the most). Thanks for the best recipe I've ever tried on this site - and I've tried a lot. I will definitely be making this again and again. Next time will also add some spinach to the mix to get some greens in the kids.
UPDATE: This time, I shredded a zucchini, two carrots, and added fresh spinach to the hamburg/onion/garlic mixture. Used Classico Four Cheese sauce again. It's SO good, and healthier!

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THIS! I used a full bag of ravioli and a 26oz. jar of pasta sauce (omitting the diced tomatoes). I did not cook the ravioli ahead, but did assemble it maybe 45 minutes before I was gonna bake it and allowed it to set until I was ready. I baked it @ 350 degrees for 40 minutes w/ a cover and about 10-15 with the cover removed. I will definately be making this again...it was GREAT! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a really good dish to serve as a base. I added many extras (mushrooms and onions) and spices (Italian herbs, nutmeg, and sea salt) to jazz it up. I don't think the flavor would have been as wonderful without the additions. Also, 450 degrees was a bit too hot. I didn't have foil so my dish bubbled, sizzled, and almost burned within 20 minutes. It's super easy and totally worth making again!!

So yummy.  My husband loves it.  It's like the shortcut version of lasagna.  Had my doubts about not boiling the ravioli first, but it came out perfectly.

This was so good! I mixed 1/2 pound of italian sausage with 1/2 a pound of beef. I used italian style diced tomatoes and used a full bag of the frozen ravioli.  I also added some fresh mushrooms to the meat mixture before adding the sauce and tomatoes. It isn't necessary to boil the ravioli before putting in the oven. Mine was fully frozen and it came out perfect! Tasted like it was from a restaurant!!

This was awesome. I am not a big fan of ravioli usually but this was great. I did take some advice from some of the other reviewers and added my own touch to it (onions, mushrooms and garlic powder) but I will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe!  First time I used the cheese ravioli.  We loved it but the kids weren't too hot on the cheese ravioli.  Next time I made it with the beef ravioli and left out the pound of ground beef.  Everyone was happy that time.  This is a great meal that really doesn't take long to throw together.  I used more than half the package of ravioli and I didn't measure the cheese, just eyeballed it.  Tonight is the third night I'm making it!  :)

This was incredible!  I made it just as the recipe called for and it was a big hit at my house.  Even my hubby (who doesn't particularly care for Italian cuisine) loved it.  He asked for the leftovers the next day!  Definitely a keeper, and one that will go in the monthly rotation of meal planning!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe, especially when it is my son's night to cook! It goes well in the slow cooker -- just follow the directions as given, and cook on high for 2 hours. If in a hurry, frozen meatballs work just as well! In fact, we prefer it that way. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Good basic beginning, but I knew it would need more flavor. I used a 32 oz. bag of ravioli and 5 cups of spaghetti sauce. Added green pepper, onion, garlic, and canned mushrooms to the sauce. Used a 9X13 pan and baked for one hour. Next time I will use sausage and leave off the last layer of cheese until the last 15 minutes of baking.

Some of us know how to open cans but aren't creative enough to know which ones to combine.  Recipes like this are great for people like me :)  I tried it with Meat Ravioli (husband is all about the meat) but I'm going to try it again with Cheese ravioli.  I think it was a simple yet tasty recipe which is all I ever ask for.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I followed the directions and the only change I made was to use more sauce, meat and cheese.  My kids liked it and hubby said it was ok.  Good and quick meal!

I made this last night and it was sooo yummy!  Like other reviewers have stated, it tastes just like lasagna (but is much easier to make).  I used the entire 25 oz. package of raviolis and thawed them before putting into a 9 x 13 dish.  Also, you need to increase the amount of spaghetti sauce to about 26 oz.  I definitely recommend this ... a definite crowd pleaser!

This recipe wasn't bad at all.  I added some spices to my spaghetti sauce for a kick and instead of diced tomatoes I think I'll use tomato sauce so there are so many tomato chunks.  I'll make this again

Really good. I only had canned tomatoes with green chilis and just a little bit of mozerlla which I made up for by using cheddar. Still tasted great, and I think I even liked the little bite the tomatoes gave the sauce.

This was really good, but I did make a few changes. I made a sauce using 28 oz. of marinara, 14.5 oz. of diced tomatoes, about 4 oz. of tomato sauce, a little water, 4 garlic cloves chopped, fresh basil, and a bag of spinach thrown in (frozen chopped) in place of the beef.  I let that simmer for about 30-45 minutes and then prepared the baked ravioli as directed.  Really delicious and a great alternative to the beef.  Also a good way to get your kids to eat their spinach!

While this may not be an intricate recipe, it was very yummy. It was very simple to put together. This is a great recipe and idea for days when you don't feel like spending hours making lasagna, but crave the taste of the lasagna. I will make this again.

My 4 picky teenagers can't get enough of this - I have to double it every time! I like to use Italian sausage for the ground beef, or 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef. Wonderful, quick, easy... I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

Very good! The only thing I did differently was added a tsp. of italian seasoning to the sauce. I should have cooked the ravioli first as other reviewers suggested as it did come out a little runny. I will definitely make again!

Had this at a friend's house and had to get the recipe for my family.  She used Paul Newman's Sockarooni Sauce instead of regular spaghetti sauce that had lots of ingredients and flavor and it was wonderful.

Ease wise, this dish is great. I used ground chicken sausage instead of the ground beef for a different flavor and it came out fantastic in that respect. The problem I had was with the ravioli being half cooked. Next time, I'll probably cook the ravioli half way before I layer the ingredients.

I thawed my ravioli first in the fridge before assembling this.  Use more sauce since the ravioli does soak up a lot of it.  Just gage it depending on how much ravioli you use.  I use 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 italian sausge.  Good flavors this way.  This is a great potluck or weeknight meal.  Let it sit for about 5 min. before serving the the ravioli can soak up the extra liquid.

This was good.  Much quicker and easier than making homemade lasagna.  The kids had seconds which was great because they are quite picky.  I did season the meat and saute with garlic and minced onions.  My favorite sauce is Ragu chunky mushroom and it worked well with this dish.

Great recipe!! I’ve made it a couple of times now. It doesn’t seem to have enough sauce for our family so I use a 29oz can of sauce and the diced tomatoes. I also substitute the ground beef with Mild Italian Sasuage..so yummy. I added the sauce to the meat and let it simmer a little bit before I put it into a dish. I didn’t have an 11x7 baking dish so I used a casserole dish that was pretty big. While I was layering I squeezed in a few more ravioli’s than called for also. Our company loved it and my husband loves it for lunch the next day! Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome!!!I didn't use Monterey Jack cheese because I didn't have any or the diced tomatoes because of the kids & it still came out great! I know it would have been even better with those things.
My kids who said it was "just okay", had 2nds & 3rds & cleaned out the pan.  When it came out of the oven, it looked like it came from an Italian restaraunt. This is a nice change of pace from speghetti and lasagna. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It was also very quick & easy to put together which every working mom or dad can appreciate.

Hey, this was really good! I tweaked it a bit by layering a few slices of pepperoni over the bottom layer of ravioli; I seasoned the meat sauce with a few shakes of Italian seasoning and garlic pepper; and I added mushrooms to the sauce.  Everyone loved it--and it was an easy weeknight dinner with Caesar salad and italian bread.  Thanks so much.

This was a very easy ansd tasty meal. I am a pasta lover so I am always looking for something new to try. My family loved it. I doubled the recipe. I also added extra seasonings to my jar of spaghetti sauce such as minced garlic, minced onion, Italian seasoning and cayenne pepper. I like a little zip to my sauce. I will definitely make again.

This dish was a great jumping off point for me.  I did make some major changes to the sauce.  The only recommendation is that it is baked at 375 for at least an hour.  Take off aluminum foil for the last 1/2 hour to brown the top.  I think 450 is way too hot.  Sometimes quicker is not necessarily better.  A great shortcut to lasagna.  My husband loved it!

Wow!  Simple and great!  And contrary to some of the mean things people have said, it is cooking!  It leaves a lot of room to add your own touches and get creative!  Lots of basil, garlic and oregano for me!  Served with salad, bread and green beans!  Yummy!  Whole family loved it!!!!

Four out of four thumbs way up from my family, which is very rare!  Everyone had seconds or thirds.  I didn't change a thing, except to add a little salt to the sauce after tasting.  It was very easy to make.  I'm putting this into my regular rotation for sure.  Thank you!

Easy and very tasty.  I love cheese, so I used 2 cups of Mozzarella and 2 cups of Colby/Jack.  I used Prego for the sauce. Yum...will make again.

Teens,husband and I loved it.  Didn't have much time, so: I browned the meat with garlic while setting a pot of water to boil.  After draining grease from meat, I added one and one half jars of spaghetti sauce with a few of my own seasonings while throwing the pasta into boiling water.  They only take 4 minutes!  I had Italian cheese casserole mix and used it.  I layered ingredients as reciped called for and popped into 375 degree oven to heat briefly.  I can't believe how much everyone loved the dish.  Served with caeser salad mix from a bag and garlic bread--quick and easy.

I must have forgot to pick up items down the flavor aisle at the store. I added onions, garlic, salt and pepper to meat. I used fresh cut up tomatoes istead of canned. I also used ricotta cheese on 3rd layer. It certainly was missing something and as the fellas at the fire station pointed out, I missed going down flavor aisle

A quick, easy shortcut recipe that tastes like lasagna! I do prefer to do my cooking from scratch, but let's face it- that's just not always possible. I see a lot of people saying that this dish was bland and very basic, but mine turned out quite flavorful. I did, however, use garlic herb spaghetti sauce and garlic fire roasted tomatoes instead of plain. That helped the flavor a lot.

This was very good. It definitely needs more sauce if you use a 9x13 pan. I like garlic so the sauce I used had garlice in it, so did the diced tomatos. Like other reviewers, I added a can of mushrooms. 
This is an easy dish to prepare and I will definitely make it again.

Glad I came across this recipe on The Buzz. Used frozen cheese tortellini instead of ravioli. I added grated onion and a chopped clove of garlic to the skillet while cooking the ground beef. This was an easy to follow recipe for a simple weeknight meal. We had garlic bread with it. Thanks for sharing LUVINMYHUBBY

I will be making this one again because it was simple, quick, and my kids and husband all loved it. I didn't cook or thaw my raviolis before I layered them, and I added in all of my favorite spices.

Delicious! I used only mozzarella, but I am sure it is good with the monteray jack included as well.

Not that great. Not enough meat sauce to top it off & my ravioli stuck together after it was cooked. Messy and time consuming. Too much work and costly to make.

Pretty good, very easy.  My older son liked the edges that were a little crispy and my other son liked the middle so that worked out well for us!  They do have stickiness to them, but we didn't mind it.

My package of ravioli was 9 oz. so I scaled this to 4 servings, which worked out well for us.  My ravioli was the fresh, refrigerated kind and I really thought it should be cooked before adding it to the casserole.  But after reading some of the reviews and checking this out on the Recipe Buzz, I decided to leave them uncooked.  I deviated from the recipe by adding some sauteed green pepper and fresh garlic that needed to be used, and subbed cheddar for the Monterey Jack cheese.  I thought the 450 degree oven temperature was really excessive, so I baked mine, covered, for about 45 minutes at 350.  My ravioli wasn’t quite as plump as I think it could have been, so just as a comparison, I might cook or partially cook the ravioli next time.  Regardless, this turned out well, and we really enjoyed it.

I've made this twice following the recipe exactly.  It is easy & quick to prepare & is delicious!  I especially love the cheesy meat sauce.  Will continue to make for my family with a good salad & hot buttered rolls.

Loved this easy way to make ravioli that's as good as lasagna.  I added a layer of ricotta cheese and used half cheese ravioli and half meat ravioli.  
Yum.....it's a winner in my house.

This meal was a hit with my family!  The only change I made was adding chopped green peppers and onions while cooking my ground beef.  The ravioli came out fine without pre-cooking.

Everyone really liked this - it was wonderfully quick and easy too.  I like the blend of the cheeses. I did need to use about twice the sauce though - we like it saucey but twice as much didn't really make it too saucey, just right for us actually.  Other than that we didn't change a thing. We'll have this again!

I added ground sausage instead of ground beef. I did not cook the ravioli's prior. Just let it thaw out on the kitchen counter for about 30 minutes. This is one of my husband's new favorite recipes!

Great alternative to boiling the ravioli and very easy.  I just threw in whatever I had.  I put a layer of sauce then a layer of ravioli, more sauce fresh diced tomatoes, cheese, and 1 diced chicken sausage and repeated the layer and added a bit of feta cheese I had left. I used a whole package of ravioli too.   I didn't measure anything, I just threw it all together, baked it for 30 min, and enjoyed a tasty dish!

Yum!  Wasn't as "quick" as I thought it would be but much easier than actually making lasagna.  Only thing I changed was adding some milk to the tomato sauce & omitted the diced tomatoes.  I did not pre-cook the ravioli and it turned out perfect!

As written, I think this is a 4-star recipe.  I took one look at this and decided it needed some more seasoning, so I browned the meat with chopped onion and garlic.  Also, I added about 1/2 t. to 1 t. of Penzey's pasta sprinkle (blend of italian herbs) to the spaghetti sauce.  Note that I did not pre-cook my ravioli.  I ended up using an entire 25 oz. bag of ravioli and an entire 26 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce, but left the other amounts the same.  Next time I may try using half beef ravioli and half cheese ravioli.

I am so glad I tried this! I must admit I doctored it up a wee bit as the commercial sauce needed a little help.  I used the entire package of raviolis and cooked them for only 2 minutes and drained them. I cooked the meat with a chopped onion and some mushrooms. I used a 26 1/2 oz can of commercial sauce that I had on hand, the diced tomatoes and a 6 oz can of tomato paste as someone else had suggested.  I added some sugar to sweeten the sauce a little and a pinch of baking soda to cut the acidic taste. Also added a little garlic powder (tho fresh garlic would be perfect).  Instead of getting Jack Cheese, I used an 8 oz pkg. of a shredded Mozzarella and Provolone blend and topped everything with a sprinkling of Parmesan as suggested. This was so delicious! I took some of this to my daughter's home and her friend had a plate of this and she loved it too!  I think that this would be wonderful with chicken ravioli or whatever you prefer, and since I often freeze my homemade meat sauce, I wouldn't hesitate to use it. I definitely will make this again! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

So easy to prepare ahead for company. I'm considering trying a mushroom gravy version and an Alfredo sauce version just for a change.  Highly recommend this recipe.

A decent recipe. I used Nana's Pasta Sauce, a personal recipe by EAKE in this recipe. Flavors were good. I didn't use the can of diced tomatoes either due to the Pasta sauce, that had plenty of tomatoes in it already. And used frozen beef ravioli instead because it's what I had on hand. I made 2 of these. One with a ricotta cheese layer and one with out. My kids preferred the one with ricotta. But both were still really good. Thanks.

This turned out great! Will definitely be using this again! Just added some onion and garlic to the hamburger when browning. My husband and I have had the leftover for the past two days! Just finished it off! Excellent!

This is quick, easy meal for a weeknight.  I ended up using a whole bag of ravioli, half did not seem to be enough to me.  Very much like a poor man's lasagna.

Yum!  This is definitely a keeper!  Only changes I made was to use ground turkey instead of beef, and to use a can of crushed tomatoes (I added italian seasonings) instead of using a jar of spaghetti sauce.  Also, another reviewer said to cook the ravioli before making the recipe.  I found that I didn't need to.  It was great as is!

Wow this was really simple to make and very good! I used italian sausage, cheddar cheese (will use mozzarella next time though) and omited the tomatoes. I just finished off last nights leftovers and I gotta say it was even better today than it was for dinner last night! I can not wait to make this again! Thanks for this yummy recipe!

Quick and easy.  I tried using beef ravioli on the bottom layer...not a good idea.  I would recomment using just the cheese ravioli.  A nice recipe when you need a fast dinner.

I agree with everyone this is a great recipe.  If you are a cooking snob, you might not like it because it is so easy and so good.  I have three boys and need something that I can fix fast so I can spend more time playing with them.

This was a great recipe.  I used about 3/4 lb turkey sausage (no beef).  Per other reviews I decided to use the whole bag of ravioli too.  I used one jar of sauce and one can of tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic (drained).  I used 1 bag of a 4 Italian cheese shred and 1 bag of provolone slices.  The provolone cheese is the key!
I baked it covered for 30 minutes and took the foil off and baked it for 5 more minutes.  The whole family was happy!!

This recipe was delicious! It is especially good for those full time college students, like me, that come home from work at 7:30 and need a recipe thats "just opening cans" as the person below stated. It tasted completely homemade! My husband didn't even noice that the sauce was bertolli!!

This recipe was pretty good. I used spinach/cheese ravioli that I bought from Costco and pre-cooked before baking. It seemed like I didn't have enough sauce to layer, so next time I will double the pasta sauce and add mushrooms and olives. I ended up with cheese as the last layer, so for the last five minutes of cooking, I took off the aluminum foil so that the cheese will brown on top. For an added kick, I sprinkled red pepper flakes on top. Yummy!

Ok, I had to alter this recipe since I don't eat beef.  I used 16 oz chopped frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry).  I also mixed 1 pint of ricotta with the spinach and spaghetti sauce so the layers were spinach/ravioli/cheese/spinach and so on.  It was very yummy but makes A LOT!!!  I had to use a whole 25 oz bag for my pan.  

Next time I will use an 8 x 8 pan, half the ravioli, reduce spinach and add some ground turkey.  Overall this was a hit and fairly simple to make!

This was ok.  My family wasn't very excited or impressed with it.  Which is disappointing since it was an easy meal to make.

This was pretty good. I didn't use a big enough pan so it bubbled over quite a bit! I also added garlic and mushrooms to the meat as it browned. I used the whole package of ravioli as well. My kids only ate the ravioli so it seemed pointless to use the rest of the ingredients. But I thought it tasted good.

This recipe is so EASY!  I follow directions exactly except I add 3/4 can of water to the meat sauce to help cook the raviolis. I also refridgerate overnight so the liquid can get into the frozen ravioli.  Everyone raves about this.  I also only use mozzarella and parmesan cheese - never used the monterey jack because I don't normally have it on hand.  But a delicious, easy recipe that everyone loves!

I would for sure make this again!  Just for the record:  I did NOT prepare the ravioli as directed on the package.  I simply used the frozen ravioli disks to make my two layers.  Worked out perfectly and was a HUGE time saver.  Cut the prep time by at least half.  I used sausage instead of ground beef.  Also the temp of 450 degrees seemed high to me...I did about 25 minutes at 350 degrees and it was fine (in fact we had to wait a couple of minutes to let it cool down.)  Really simple to make and really good!

I have used this recipe at four different parties and it was always a hit.  I also switch the ground beef for italian sausage to give the flavor a twist.

Made this last night and my entire family loved it and scoffed it down.  I even overheard my teen aged daughter tell her boyfriend about it today!

I used extra raviolis and did three layers, and I only used mozzarella since my husband won't eat other kinds of cheese.

My whole family loved this!! Make sure you cook the ravioli first. Only changes were I used pepper jack cheese instead of montery jack. & I made an extra layer of cheese on top. I also cooked it 40 min. to make the cheese a little more "burnt on" my family likes it that way.

I made this for a gathering and everyone LOVED it!  Even I coudln't believe I made something so good!  I made small changes here and there - including italian sausage instead of ground beef, and also added a layer of cheese on top.  I made this twice - once with no changes and the other time with changes.  It tasted great both ways, it just depends on your liking.

Very tasty!  Added in 1 tbsp minced garlic, half of a large yellow onion (diced) and one diced yellow bell pepper when frying the beef, as recommended by others.  Also added 1 small can tomato paste (used 1.5 jars) and 1 tsp. salt to the spaghetti sauce.  Used the whole package of ravioli--no need to cook beforehand!, plus 2 cups each of the cheeses instead of just 1 cup. Filled a 9x13 baking dish just perfectly, and everyone said it tasted amazing.

This was pretty good.  I used Italian sausage sauted with garlic and onions, doubled the sauce, can of diced tomatoes,
used lots of Ricotta and Monterey cheese and used 25oz of pasta.  This was tasty and there is plenty of leftovers (from a house of 2).  I will make this again.

We enjoyed this dish - it turned out great. The ravioli cooked through all the way just fine - I used refrigerated pasta instead of frozen so maybe that made a difference.

Yum Yum Yum!!!!  This was a hit at my house!  I made a few changes.  I used mozzarella and provolone cheeses.  I used frozen cheese tortellini instead or ravioli.  I also seasoned the ground beef with italian seasonings and garlic salt.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an excellent idea for ravioli.  If you have an aversion to opening cans, you may want to use your imagination and subsitute the "canned" items for HOMEMADE.  You could use leftover homemade spaghetti sauce...and even frozen homemade ravioli (I'm sure all recipe snobs have some in their freezer!). I'm sure you can really spice this up in alot of ways by using some culinary skills & imagination...and make it "gormet"....or just make "as is" for single moms & others who don't have the time to cook everything from scratch...either way, it's a great recipe...thanks for sharing!!!

Pretty good. The sauce that I used was somewhat watery and slide off the raviolis. I will make it agian, but use a thicker sauce so that it will all hold together. It was a nice easy dinner.

Very good throw together meal.  The frozen ravioli wasn't soft.  I think I will bake the dinner for an additional 10 mins, maybe that will help.  I assume if I used fresh made ravioli it would turn out mushy because of the long baking time??  I didn't notice anyone using fresh??
Will make again, very easy.
Thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

I cannot say ENOUGH good things about this recipe.  I don't rate recipes often, but this one, I just HAD to!  I used the following ingredients:  96/4 lean ground beef, a full 25 oz. package of beef ravioli rather than cheese, 14 oz. jar of Ragu Meat flavored sauce, 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.  I have found on the occasions I have made it however, that I tend to put too much sauce on the bottom and not nearly enough on the top, however, I keep the ravioli from drying out by rolling them in the sauce mixture prior to baking.  It always looks wonderful, and leftovers (when I have them!) get comments at work:  "what are YOU eating today?  It smells DELICIOUS!" and it's SOOOOO easy! I serve with garlic cheese bread and a salad.

Sorry - ravioli was very gummy and not appealing to us. Thanks for sharing though!

This is a easy dish to prepare and a delicious dish to eat! Everyone enjoyed it with some garlic bread sticks and a salad. I did add some extra spices; garlic, Italian seasonings and parsley. It will be a repeater dish in our house. Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe. I used Italian sausage ravioli from Sam's Club and two jars of spaghetti sauce from Aldi (Traditional Style). Used more mozzarella and Monterrey Jack and added some frozen, diced onions as well as dried basil and garlic powder. It was great tasting. I will be making this for some other people in the near future.

Big hit with the family!  My VERY picky 5 year old shoveled it in his mouth.  I used a little more sauce and took out the diced tomatoes.  Got the refrigerated bread sticks, lite butter and sprnkled parm cheese as a side.  I agree with another review, "cheater lasagne" - awesome - will be used again (quick and low cost!)

WOW.  Everyone LOVED this dish.  My boyfriends daughters (who are VERY picky)raved about it. I thought it tasted like lasagna. I didn't think it was bad, I guess I was just expecting a different taste.  I will be making it again as I keep getting request for it.  It is much easier then lasagna!

A good basic recipe. I added garlic, crushed red pepper, oregano, and basil to the sauce. This makes a lot for just me and my DH, so I'm going to try freezing some of the leftovers. Very easy and fairly quick. Will make again.

Pretty easy but didn't particularly like it.  Somehow it just felt like eating ravioli with tomatoes and beef as sides - it just didn't meld as a casserole well even though it sounded like it would be good.  I'd rather have ravioli with a jar of sauce on it any day.

Yum-- we all enjoyed this. I doubled it, but only used mozzarella cheese. It was very easy and tasty, and with 3 kids that is what I need. Food snobs need not try this recipe, but the rest of us need quick meals like this.

I used double the spaghetti sauce(doctored it with red wine & garlic) and the entire bag of the ravioli.  I added a can of mushrooms and put it in a 9x13 pan.  Everyone in my family loved it--especially my 2 picky daughters!  It was an easy, quick to prepare dinner--perfect for us busy people who like to cook but don't have enough time!

We loved this recipe. I will definitely make this one of my regular meals because it is so good and quick and easy to fix.  I didn't have the ravioli on hand, but did have tortellinis, so I substituted those, boiling them first and then made the rest according to the recipe. Because the fresh tomatos are so good and readily available right now, I used fresh diced tomato and added it to the cooked ground beef to cook just a bit before coming with the rest of the ingredients.  Excellent meal with just a green salad and garlic toast

I thought this was good, easy to make, and rather tasty.  To give the recipe more "zip", I substituted a roll of Bob Evans original recipe sausage in lieu of the ground beef and used Barilla's Marinara Sauce.  Next time I may "kick it up a notch" and use the Zesty Hot flavor sausage.  Will use this recipe again.

This is a good recipe if you're pressed for time and in need of a hearty meal.  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9 x 13 baking dish and used fresh ravioli stuffed with cheese and spinach which I boiled for 5 minutes before arranging in the dish.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms, onion and a large green bell pepper and added it to the sauce.  Then baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  My husband and I thought it was pretty good for a quick meal but my son had 3 helpings AND packed some for lunch the next day.  High praise indeed as he's not too fussy about left-overs.

Awesome recipe!  The hubby loved it!  My modifications - used the italian style diced tomatoes (ones with basil, oregano, and garlic - with that no addt'l seasoning needed) and instead of the monterey jack and mozzarella, used a bag of 6 blend Italian.  Served with a loaf of cheesy italian bread.  Excellent!  Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  Will definitely be making again.

I did not have diced tomatoes, so made without.

Also needs clarification on directions.  It should say that Sauce for layering is the Sauce mixed with meat.

Very good. Quick and easy. I used a whole bag of ravioli, so I doubled the meat (used a pound of ground Italian sausage and a pound of ground beef), a large jar of sauce (28oz?), still only 1 can of tomatoes (I used crushed because the kids don’t like chunky tomatoes), doubled the cheese, and sprinkled Parmesan on each layer. Easy, weeknight dinner.

Easy & yummy. I misread the ingredients and used 2 pkg of large ravioli (DUH!) but it was fine. I read a few reviews and appreciated not having to cook the pasta ahead of time. I too added some chopped onion & garlic to the sauce (1-1/2 lb ground beef + 28 oz can spaghetti sauce + 14 oz can diced Italian tomatoes = I guess doubling recipe) Also doubled cheese and it fed our 5 member family with leftovers to spare.  Thanks so much for an fast "lasagna" fix!

This was delicious. 5 stars with some reviewers additions. I added onions, mushrooms, garlic and italian seasoning and seasoning salt with the meat. Used 1 bag of meat and 1 bag of cheese raviolis. Ended up using 24oz pasta sauce and about another 14oz. Used a 9x13 Pyrex and it was very full. After 30 min. I lowered the temp to 350 and baked uncovered for 10 min. Came out great!

I used the entire 25 ounce package of Ravioli.  This almost perfectly makes 2 layers of Ravioli in a 13x9 baking dish.  I used a 24 ounce jar of spaghetti sauce,  I doubled the amount of cheese, using two cups of each.   And I also added a layer of pepperoni , because I had it on hand and wanted to use it.  I also diced up a couple of Jalapeno peppers and mixed with the ground beef to add a little kick.  Next time,  I won't use as much cheese.  When baking the full package of Ravioli, you will want to add more than 1 cup of each cheese, but 2 was too much.

So delicious! I made it for my family and they were all super fans, but my dad wouldn’t stop raving about it. He even said it was “restaurant quality.” I did make minor changes; i I did extra cheese (maybe 1.5 cups each instead of one), and added garlic to the meat sauce. Ended up being a winner for sure!!

Well...I never make it like the recipe.  Lol...I always change things.   So I used 2 lb ground beef, a 24 oz can of spaghetti sauce and the whole bag of raviolis.   I also changed the Monterey Jack to extra sharp cheddar.  The boys who do not like lasagna loved it.  It has been added to the repertoire.   Especially since it portions and freezes well.

I used one and a half large jars of spaghetti sauce because I didn't have tomatoes and whole bag of ravioli. Instead of Monterey Jack I used baby Swiss because I had it in the fridge. Baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Used the other half jar of sauce for extra on top. This was so good we both had seconds. Definitely a keeper.

The only change I made was using Italian sausage rather than ground beef. The first time I made it, it was good, just not much flavor.

Stuck at home in nasty weather - this is perfect for a hot satisfying meal. Even Hubs - who is NOT a pasta lover- really enjoyed his three helpings. We were chilled to the bone and wanted nothing more than pure comfort. This was excellent .
Easy to make with items on hand. Served with hot bread and a small side salad, YUM Thanks for a great addition to our recipes

Way easier then lasagna with the same flare! I set the raviolis out for a bit to let them thaw while I made the sauce. Onions, garlic, meat sautéed then drained...then simmered in jarred sauce with extra seasonings type thing. I tossed the raviolis in a spicy bread crumb mix before layering them. I added ricotta and whatever other cheese that was in the house that needed to go so it was a nice mix!  I made a half batch, covered and baked for the thirty minutes while I made a salad and had dinner on the table in a timely manner after a long day of work.  I will totally do this again!! Thank you for sharing!!

Very tasty!  I had homemade meat sauce left-over from a previous spaghetti & meat sauce dinner  plus a package of fresh mini ravioli  about to expire.  This recipe was perfect for my pantry/fridge-night dinner.   I did not have Monterrey Jack on hand so I used the mozzarella and ricotta for the cheeses and then topped with a generous layer of Parmesan-Reggiano.  Next time, if using the fresh mini ravioli, I will double the ravioli layer as it was a bit light on pasta.   We enjoyed this recipe - especially my 10 year old.  Thanks for a quick and easy dinner.

Great easy recipe!  Quick enough for a school night. Similar in taste to lasagna, but quicker and easier. All 4 kids and hubby liked it enough to ask for seconds. I used others suggestions for a larger batch; 9x13 pan, full bag of raviolis, 2 c. mozzarella, 2 c. Mexican cheese (with monterey jack in it, because that's what I had on hand), dollops of ricotta cheese (I didn't measure, but I used just less then half the container), 1# hamburg (cooked with garlic powder and onion powder), 26 oz. jar of Prego pasta sauce. It filled the pan very near the top; I placed a sheetpan underneath just in case it bubbled over, but it did not. Covered with foil, baked at 450 for 30 mins, removed foil and baked 10 mins more at 350. Came out perfect, and we all enjoyed. Thanks for a nice easy recipe my whole family will eat!

Our family really enjoyed this as a weeknight dinner. Easy to put together which I appreciated.

Would maybe add a little salt or garlic to the ground beef next time.

This one is a keeper. Such a lovely idea for a quick yet satisfying lasagna type meal. I did change one or two things, no Monterey Jack cheese because well, that cheese should never be in ANYTHING that is Italian and I used turkey Italian sausage as my meat. I also threw in some ricotta cheese on one of the layers to give it more of a lasagna feel. But this was such an easy and quick dinner and after working 40 hours, just what I needed. Will definitely make again!

This was very good. For my sauce I used a Lawry spaghetti sauce packet, made as directed on packet using tomato sauce instead of paste. Added onion and garlic to the meat. Layered as instructed, using frozen cheese ravioli. It’s definitely a keeper. Going to try different types of ravioli also

I ended up using more of each ingredient than I thought I would, including adding a layer of cheese over the top before putting it in the oven. The meat was a little flavorless, so next time I will add seasonings and maybe onions to the meat when I cook it.

This was easy and delicious. My husband loved it! My only change was to use gluten free ravioli, and I added onions, garlic and basil to the sauce. I like those flavors in my sauce but the recipe itself didn’t need it.  Thanks for posting...such a great idea!

I made this per  the recipe. Next time I will include juice from diced tomatoes as this was a little dry. I will also bake it on a lower temperature as the cheese in the middle did not get as melted and gooey as I like.  It was easy to make . The changes I would make are just my  own personal taste.  Not nearly as expensive to make as lasagna but the taste is very similar.  I will be taking this to my next pot luck.

My daughter announced at 7pm that she had to bring something for a food sale at school the next day. I read a few lazy lasagna recipes but none had as many good reviews as this one. My frozen ravioli were round and had big gaps between so I decided to make a regular ricotta lasagna filling to disguise the scant pasta layer. I also used only mozzarella and Parmesan as I didn’t have Monterey Jack. I baked as directed and then broiled on low for five minutes to get a nice brown finish. It was the first dish to sell out! Thanks for saving my butt. This is my new go-to for pot luck.

Delicious!!!! I used ground mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I think it really made the flavor. Also used double the amount of sauce. Only used mozzarella because that’s our favorite. Baked at 350 for 30 min. (I thought 450 sounded too high for my oven) and then took the foil off the top and baked another 10 min. Broiled the cheese on top for a couple minutes and it was AMAZING!!!

This is a very versatile dish.  You can add most anything and it will turn out great.  We added  onion and green bell pepper to the ground beef
And doubled the sauce, cheese, and ravioli.  Next time I will add ricotto cheese as one if the other reviews did.

A family favorite of ours we make often. I sometimes add shredded zucchini and onion to ground turkey to add some veggies.

I’ve made this several times and it runs out great each time. I used 2lbs of ground beef, diced one whole red onion and 2 medium cloves of garlic, used 32oz of sauce, and plenty of basil seasoning. I cooked it for 30 minutes at 450 with foil on,

Made this for dinner tonight and I loved it! Is it a made from scratch-Gordon Ramsey-picked fresh from the Earth level meal? No, but for us normal people that have either full time jobs, kids, school/church/family commitments, etc(who isn't busy these days, am I right?) it's a great budget friendly and quick throw together dinner. I served this is with garlic bread and steamed broccoli.

This was really good but def. needed a few tweaks. After reading reviews from prior people with me this recipe I decided their recommendations would help extend this dish for my family. The amount of sauce in the recipe is much too little and is strongly suggest to use a 24 ounce jar or larger. After reading a few of the reviews I decided to add a large can of sliced mushrooms and some frozen pepper and onion mix that I had in the freezer this was added into one and a half 24 ounce jars of tomato sauce and 1 pound of ground beef along with some minced garlic. Instead of using the Monterey Jack cheese I doubled the mozzarella cheese. The one recommendation that I did follow that I will not the next time is 30 min covered at 350, then 15 min uncovered. The temperature of the frozen ravioli was warm but not hot. Do 30 min at 450 covered and then reduce the heat to 350 for 15 min uncovered if you want to make sure it’s nice and hot.

Love this! Used the whole bag of ravioli, added sliced mushrooms to the ground beef, and some oregano and basil. I was worried about the high temp, but it was perfect. Delicious!

Came out great. Might have saved a little time but not a lot. Still very tasty. Added some red wine and the sauce really came together. Added Ricotta in the layers. Whole family loved it!

What a delicious and very easy dish!  My husband says it's better than lasagna.  It's so much easier too.  I'll be making this again and again.  I think I'll try Italian sausage to see if that can possibly make it any better.

This turned out better than I expected.  I followed the tips of another review and used all of the ravioli and doubled the sauce.  It fit perfect in a 9x13 dish.

I have never rated anything 5 stars but this is one of the closest to it. My family gave it a 8 or 9 rating out of 10. 
I made a larger portion and used just over 1/2 of a huge package of ravioli from Sams Club (64oz).  I also used almost two, 32 oz jars of Classico sauce.  I cooked 1.5 pounds of beef with a big onion and a tablespoon of chopped garlic from a jar.   In the sauce I also added in about 12 jalapeno's cut up from a jar.  I like the idea of adding Italian sausage too and maybe cottage cheese. I did add mushrooms but will leave that out next time because of the kids.  I just used whatever cheese I had on hand which was cheddar and some grated parmesan. I forgot to cover with tin foil and I cooked very filled 13x9 pan for 32 minutes.  It was just fine and heated all the way through.

I had to make it for work. I added about a teaspoon of garlic salt and some table salt and pepper after mixing in the tomato sauce. It helped take away some of that sweetness for if you're not a huge fan of tomatoes, like myself.

I dressed up this recipe quite a bit to suit our  tastes and it is a good base. I sautéed onions, mushrooms, spinach and garlic before adding a vegetarian burger. I used diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and onion, which I drained and then chopped a bit more in my food processor. I had some homemade marinara but also used a 16 oz jar of sauce because I like a lot of sauce. Definitely use a full bag of ravioli and I just added the amount of cheese I like, which is probably double. I baked it at 375 for just over half and hour , uncovered like my lasagna, until it was golden a bubbly. The alterations make it a five!

I made this last night for my family and everyone loved it! I made the recipe just as its written, minus the can of tomatoes because of picky eaters in my home. This was easy for a weekend night dinner. Would taste great with a mix of beef and Italian sausage and adding some veggies like other reviewers mentioned: mushrooms, green bell pepper or spinach! I will definitely be adding this to my dinner rotation. Thanks for a great recipe.

We liked this.  I made one of my layers sliced zucchini.  I used Italian sausage and mushrooms as some reviewers suggested and that was a great idea.  I also dotted the top with fresh mozzarella, in addition to the other cheeses. Instead of zucchini, I'm going to use spinach next time for getting some veges in.

I used mild Italian sausage and fresh ravioli with spinach and cheese. We loved it.

Thank you for the framework! We adjusted it to our tastes and cupboard stock by using Italian sausage (cooked with diced onion and garlic), making a home-made sauce ( tomatoes, tomatoe sauce, bay leaf, oregano, garlic, Italian seasoning), we used cheese and spinach ravioli, left out the monterey jack and added ricotta. It turned out very nicely and we'll be making it again.

This was so simple to make, a hit with my whole family.  I used ground beef and ground Italian sausage, more spaghetti sauce, more cheese, and more ravioli so I could put in a 9x13 dish.  Only drawback is that it took 45 mins then another 5 mins in microwave to have it hot enough, probably because the ravioli was frozen. Otherwise, delicious, will make again for sure.

I made this with a few additions of my own for a family gathering. They all loved it. I roasted 1 eggplant, 2 zucchini, 6 garlic cloves, 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, and mushrooms and mixed them in the meat sauce. Delicious, Next time I'll try it without the meat. Thank you

The family said this was a keeper.  Made exactly as stated and It tasted like lasagna without all the prep.  I used the ravioli still frozen and uncooked and may have used more than called for because my bag was 32  oz.  and guesstimated a generous 25 oz.

I love this recipe but i customized it to my taste. I changed the amount of meat, adding more, and used both ground beef and Italian sausage.  I eliminated the jack cheese and substituted provolone.  Also added a bit of crushed red pepper to the sauce for some ZING!!!

Super easy to make.  Very fast, easy recipe when one is craving lasagna but doesn't want to go through all the steps.  I did have to put a cookie sheet under though because the juices started dripping over.  Perhaps next time I will use a larger pan.

This goes in the "keeper" file!!  Tweeked according to others suggestions of using 24 oz jar of Cheese sauce Ragu and half an onion diced into ground beef.  Proceeded to use whole package of Cheese Raviolis in 9 X 13 pan.  Soooo much easier than lasagna and my three teens didn't leave any.

It was easy and delicious. I used a full 24oz bottle of spaghetti sauce and used all Mozzerella cheese as I had a large bag. That was all my changes. I love that I can have all the ingredients on hand to make this dish anytime.

Was looking for something a little different for dinner and this fit the bill.  I used a 25 oz bag of cheese ravioli, ground sausage and a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce; also dotted some ricotta on the first layer before putting the second layer on for a more lasagna-like taste.  The family loved it enough that they don't mind leftovers tomorrow!

Wow! Really filling. I used fresh ravioli so no need to pre-cook.  Also added a layer of ricotta. This was enjoyed by the whole family.

I cook at a church for homeless people on Fridays at lunch. There was a big pot of frozen leftover Chili Con Carne from a previous meal so I used that instead of the Marinara sauce. I also added a thin layer of sour cream and sliced olives. I only have available the leftovers from other meals and whatever I can get from a food bank. So my layering was as follows; - pasta sauce to cover bottom of the pan - 1st layer of cheese and spinach ravioli - layer of chili con carne - layer of sour cream and plain yogurt blended - layer of sliced olives sprinkled like on a pizza - 2nd layer of ravioli - layer of chili, then sprinkled with grated cheeses, covered and baked as per recipe Turned out to be super cheesy, super beefy, super vegetably - all round super. , All the "guests" loved it and came back for 2nd's and 3rd's. Since good chili needs to simmer for hours, next time just make more and freeze some for this adaptation. It was so easy to put together and had all the food groups - vegs, proteins, starch, dairy

A simple, yet delicious recipe. Added mushrooms, onions, garlic powder. Also used extra cheese, particularly shredded Parmesan which was added to the top and baked uncovered for an additional 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Thanks for positing.

My family enjoyed this--Like many others who reviewed this recipe, I added garlic, Italian seasoning and onion to the meat as it cooked.  I used the small ravioli since that was all I had on hand -but, they worked out just fine.  Next time I would add more cheese.

We made this and we really liked it. We used our cast iron Dutch oven to make it in. My daughter loves the ravioli, if you have picky eaters I would set some of the ravioli aside and cook some of them by themselves. The Dutch oven cooked it well. We did not boil the ravioli we used another individuals suggestion about letting the ravioli get to room temp we really didn't do that just took it out of the freezer when we started cooking the meat. We really liked this meal. We will make this again.

I used home made sauce that I made on the weekend, and freshly grated cheese,  I made a larger batch with meat sauce and a small batch with just sauce. It was fabulous on a work night, very easy and it was delicious, The only issue I had, and it was my fault was I didn't use a large enough pan for the large batch, it came out a little drier than the smaller batch. I will make this again. Thank you it was awesome.

This was a great recipe! I cheated a little though, and used precooked frozen meatballs. So I cooked the meatballs in the microwave and crumbled them up.  I just had jarred sketti sauce (I used a 24 oz jar of Ragu chunky style sundried tomato & basil) and layered some on the bottom. Then I laid down some ravioli, sauce,  and meatballs (only on half bec I just wanted just cheese) and cheese. Then I repeated the ravioli, meat, sauce and finished with cheese. I used 2.5 cups all mozzarella bec that's what I had on hand. I sprayed my foil and baked for 45 minutes at 450. It. Was. Awesome! Simple, delicious and filling! Paired it with garlic cheese toast and bam! Thank you so much for this recipe. ...it rocks!

Very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly but did use butternut squash ravioli (from frozen, no thawing) instead of cheese ravioli. The combination of the savory flavors with the sweeter butternut squash was so good and made this dish stand out for our family. Everyone loved it, from my picky husband (who swears he's not) to my (also picky) 14-month old! So easy and tasty!

This was a super easy and a simple recipe that made a great meal.  Pair it with a salad and bread and you have a nice quick meal for the family.  I did modify the recipe to our tastes such as used 3/4 a package of ravioli to make a nice even layer in the dish while layering, a little more pasta sauce, and added in some chopped onion, garlic, and extra seasonings with the sauce mixture.  It ended up being pretty tasty.  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this as a freezer meal for my family before I went out of town for a trip and it was SO easy!!  Next time I'll definitely use Italian sausage instead of beef but other than that I can't find fault with this recipe at all.  It would be easy to dress up with extra veggies or homemade sauce but in this case it was EXACTLY what I was looking for!

Oh my gosh!  How easy and tasty!  I did use half Italian sausage and half beef, but the rest was perfect!  I usually have all the ingredients on hand, so this was great for a "spur of the moment" Italian dinner!

This is a really good recipe for frozen raviollis. These are the changes I made: I used frozen spinach and cheese raviollis from Costco (I used about 2 thirds of the bag, enough to cover each layer), 1 large jar of Bertillon pasta sauce, 1 pound of sweet Italian sausage browned with 1 cup of diced onion and 2 minced garlic cloves, 3-4 cups of mozzarella. Covered and baked for 25 minutes at 450 uncovered and baked 10-15 more minutes at 350. Sprinkled surface with fresh Parmesan. Husband raved about it said he liked it more than lasagna.

I pre-assembled the evening before I baked it and it turned out good. I didn't have any diced tomatoes in my pantry so I added mushrooms to our sauce instead. also, I had seen others didn't boil the ravioli so I thawed my ravioli still in the bag with water in the sink. I did add about 15 minutes to the baking time while the foil was still covering it. I will be making this again but will probably use mild Italian sausage instead for a little more flavor. it was also great to have this ready to go along with an easy bag salad and frozen garlic bread when I got home from work after a long Friday and not defaulting to pizza.

I made this for a party, so I quadrupled the recipe. It was DEVOURED and they were left wanting more. BIG HIT!
I used half ground beef and half mild Italian sausage for more flavor. You definitely want to do this. I also used my own sauce, which I make very flavorful with spices, herbs and brown sugar.

This recipe was very good but I did make alot of changes. I made my own ravioli & filled it with beef, ricotta, onion & parsley. & then extra filling I had left over went into the sauce with mushrooms. Very good. Restaurant quality then. Really impressed my family & extended family!

This is a great base recipe. You could do so many things to "create your own". I used half Italian sausage and half beef. When I was browning the meat I added half a yellow onion and sliced mushrooms. I seasoned with basil, oregano, garlic, pepper and some crushed red pepper. I also added a can of plain tomato sauce because it needed more. It came out wonderful! I am typically one to make from scratch, but this is a great quick night dinner that my husband loves! One more note... You can take the ravioli straight from the freezer and just double the bake time. Definitely a go to dinner during the week.

My daughter made this for dinner one night, we added  mushrooms, onions to meat sauce, and used only mozzarella cheese.  She made a large pan, so it took about an hour and a half to cook all the layers through.  She also added a final layer o f cheese five minutes before removing from the oven.  Was very good.

This is now the way my family wants me to do my ravioli. I used Italian sausage, Ragu sauce with mini sausage, 1 pkg. frozen ravioli. Made a 9x13 pan. 2 layers, thin layer of sauce, layer of ravioli, sauce, cheese, repeat. Cover with tinfoil and bake 450* for 30 mins, remove tinfoil and bake 10 more minutes. This was amazing!!  Thank you for a happy family.

I made this delicious casserole a few days ago with just a few changes. I made it vegetarian by using beef-not crumbles from Dixie Diner. I also used 2 recipes of Tomato Cream Sauce for Pasta from allrecipes except instead of using cream I used almond milk, (My favorite pasta sauce recipe) I took some suggestions from Anna and used a whole package of cheese ravioli and a can of well drained italian diced tomatoes which I added to the sauce. I put it in a 9X13 baking dish (2 layers) and covered it with the cheese. (I used a little extra cheese. ) I baked it, cover with foil, at 450  for 30 minutes then uncovered at 350 for 15 minutes. I will be making this often.

This was my first time making any type of ravioli dish and it was delicious! It was something different than regular spaghetti or lasagna. The only thing I might change in the future is having a meat ravioli instead of just cheese. It seemed to need more meat.

Made it just like the recipes says. I brought it to a potluck dinner at a friends house to rave reviews. I try to stay away from pasta but this one will be perfect for any winter gathering.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe called for and loved it! The second time I substituted fresh beef ravioli from the refrigerator section. I prepared it the same as the recipe for the frozen. We loved that too. You can make this recipe 100 different ways. The original recipe is a great foundation for any changes you'd like to make. I made it with my eight-year-old son and he loved being able to help put it together. Very easy to make on a weeknight. Really clever dish.

Extremely filing! Make sure you have enough sauce because sometimes the recommended amount isn't enough. I usually make some kind of bread with it, even if it's just toasted french bread. If you are counting on leftovers, don't get your hopes up because it will be gone before the end of the night!

Love this recipe.  Such a nice, easy dish and it taste good.  I have made this several times now for friends that have just come home from the hospital, or have had injuries.  A perfect gift, just add a salad and a loaf of garlic bread and you have made someone feel better!  Thanks for sharing.

Not bad, but definitely needs seasonings.  Was rather bland.  Will make again, but will add mushrooms, onion, and at least some garlic next time.

We found the recipe somewhat bland.  As one reviewer suggested, I added onion.  I will replace the can of diced tomatoes by doubling the amount of spaghetti sauce and add oregano and fennel.

Saw this when I opened up Allrecipes today.  Thought it would be a quick and easy supper.  And boy was it!  This is a GREAT dish for a quick, semi-homemade meal!  Served it with a salad and garlic toast.  I will be using this during the week when I don't have a lot of time to cook so I can spend more time helping the kids with their homework!  Thank you for sharing!!

Great recipe! So easy and both my kids (2 and 11months) scarfed it down. Not gourmet by any means but a tasty and filling meal. I will probably add some veggies if I have the time to chop them up next time but very yummy as is.

Loved it!!  So easy to make!  I cut back on the cheese and added garlic, basil, and cilantro to the sauce.  I also added a packet of vegetable dip mix to the beef before cooking it.  Next time I think I'll add some spinach between layers as well.

Per reviews, 13x9 pan, try cooking beef w/onion & garlic. Use whole jar arrabiata sauce and whole bag ravioli...no need to thaw (possibly try spinach & cheese kind instead of just cheese.) Second time didn't use ground beef, used frozen beef ravioli & frozen spinach & cheese ravioli layered, good too.

Used chicken and 3 cheese tortellini but followed the rest.  Too soupy.  Had to add more spaghetti sauce to get 3 layers.  Would have worked better in a 9x9 casserole dish.

As stated, this is good.  We will make again, but this time add some garlic and maybe a little salt.  Still, it's very easy and tasty!

I thought it was really good. I did the recipe exactly like it said except I used tortellini instead of the normal ravioli. Its a quick recipe when you are short on time and I would make it again

This was YUMBO!  I added a layer of hot italian sausage & used a mozzarella/cheddar combination instead of monterey jack.

Slightly changed.  Had some extra time today, so made my own sauce, but used the same amount (in ounces) as stated in recipe.  Since I was making my own sauce, I took advantage of the opportunity to add some fresh veggies: Mushrooms, garlic, onion, minced carrot & celery.  I seasoned my sauce with Italian seasoning blend, garlic powder & salt and Pepper.  I used much less cheese than what was called for (about 1/2) and it was cheesy - used cheese ravioli as well. I loved the combo of mozzarella, monterey jack and Parmesan cheeses!  I dabbed the top of mine with ricotta as well.  I wanted to drizzle it with creme fraiche, but forgot before I put it in the oven!  (next time!) - that said, yes will make again.  Was a great alternative to Lasagne and the work it takes for that.  That said... one could make this like a Lasagne and add a layer of ricotta with some spinach stirred in or a layer of thin sliced roasted zucchini.  For the ones who stated this is "not homemade" or whatever... then MAKE it homemade, that is fine.  But, the idea behind the basic recipe here is Genius!  Make it your own thing... that's cool.

What a great recipe this is!  OK, I confess.  I did add a few things as other reviewers suggested.  I imagined this recipe, as written, to be perfect for a spring or early summer day.  What I was looking for during this freezing winter was something more akin to a rustic, outdoor Tuscan summer day.  Never been there in any season, but no matter.  This recipe has come close to that perfect dreamt of moment.  Thanks for putting this tasty dish forward!

P.S.  Unlike a rustic-outdoor-Tuscan-summer-day-feast-family-that-lives-behind-me, cleanup was a snap!

Added mushrooms and fresh green onions from our garden. Used half the cheese recommended. Also used spinach and cheese ravioli, both my grown son and hubster loved it.  It now will be a regular! Super easy!!!

I've made this many times. I made some changes,whole bag of ravioli,8oz. shredded whatever cheese I have on hand,whole package turkey meatballs spread around,no additional tomatoes,double the sauce,added onion powder,kids won't eat it if they see onion,and garlic powder.9x13 dish,baked it covered 30 mins. uncovered and added cheese,back in the oven to melt the cheese. I always have sauce and several blocks of different chesse on hand because I never know when there will be a meal needed at church or the home of a friend who has lost a love one. Either this dish or my pasta salad,applesauce cake or eclair cake are usually what I make.

Delicious recipe! New way of serving ravioli. I did saute some fresh spinach and white mushrooms to add veggies. I love comfort food especially when it's freezing outside.

We are definitely putting this one in our family cookbook! Took the advice of a few people and added onion and garlic to meat before adding sauce and tomatoes.  Other than that we wouldn't change a thing, and dinner was silent because no one could stop eating it!!! Thank you!

I give the recipe 5 stars based on ease of preparation; it is obviously not a gourmet meal based on the ingredients, but it gets 5 stars for being a tasty, easy weeknight dish for my family.  The overall taste of the dish is going to depend entirely on your ingredients.  I wouldn't use generic pasta sauce for this.  I used an entire bag of ravioli and a 26-oz jar of pasta sauce and baked in 9X13 pan.  I also used garlic roasted tomatoes, but I think I'll stick to regular next time.

This is my husband's favorite.  I prefer to mix cheese & beef ravioli and he likes all beef ravioli.  He requests this one alot.  I only layered in Mozzarella, none of the othere cheeses but I'm sure it would be good too.  I always add more seasoning - Italian seasoning, garlic salt and pepper.

I had a package of frozen ravioli that I had to use so this recipe was a life saver!  I thought it was good.  A quick and easy meal.  Definitely need to use more ravioli next time - was too saucy.

I'm rating this as a three and maybe shouldn't because I didn't have the tomatoes.  This was quick and easy which is a huge deal for me working two jobs.  Used a little more meat because my hubby likes meat and doesn't care for pasta and the whole thing of ravioli.  I'm not sure there was enough sauce and or cheese and I doubled it since I used more of everything.  Hubby said I could fix again, if I worked on tweaking it. I will try it again but may try fresh ravioli next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty easy for a great meal!! I did my regular additives to the sauce, (fresh onions and mushrooms) and doubled everything because of the hungry men in my house, but other than that followed the recipe exactly and I WILL be making it again!! (And I am sure glad I doubled it because it was all gone with my family of 4 stuffed and needed to be rolled away from the table!)

The whole family loved it!  It tasted a lot like lasagna but much easier! I will definitely be making it again.  I usually don't review a recipe unless I make it exactly as written.  However, I have to admit, I did add extra cheese.  I am a cheese lover so that is a hard habit to break!

This is the best recipe!  So easy and so good.  My husband loved it.  I did not boil the ravioli before, I put them in frozen and they were perfect.  Will definitely be making this again.

One word YUMMY.  I added some spices to the sauce and used just a regular jar of spaghetti sauce.  Hubby loved.  Will definitely make again.

Very great dish that tastes a lot like lasagna, without all the work. I used the whole bag of raviolis.

this is a rotating recipe in my house. Since the week nights are very busy for us this is something I can make on the fly and also on a small budget! My family loves it. Instead of regular diced tomatoes I mixed in a little fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes from the can. and shredded parmesan cheese - I also used cheese ravioli since my family does not like the meat kind. I have also substituted diced meatballs when not having ground beef on hand. YUM!

So easy ~it has to be 5 Stars! Saute onions w/hamburger... mushrooms optional.  Use Italian sausage & garlic spagheti sauce.  Add  8oz. tomato sauce - needs more sauce.  Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup grated parm cheese Rocitta over raviolis when layering... optional.  Cover @ 425 degrees @ 40min then uncover x5min.

I made this recipe for two and wanted to avoid have a lot leftover.  I used an 8x8 dish (brownie pan sized) and found that 12 of my ravioli made one layer on the bottom, so I used 24 ravioli overall.  I did cook the ravioli first, and I baked the whole dish for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  I still used a pound of meat, but hot italian sausage instead of beef, and I added diced onion and minced garlic to it.  I eyeballed the sauce (a three-cheese blend, Target brand) and tomatoes (basil and oregano), just adding as much as I thought we'd like to the sausage. I only had cheddar and parmesan cheese, and I just sprinkled on as much as I wanted of each.  It turned out pretty good. Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe while searching for a particular dish that I already had in mind, so I have to admit, I did make some changes. I used the beef ravioli, made my normal meat sauce, the cheese I had in the fridge (Colby/Jack and Mozzarella) and then when I layered it I drizzled alfredo sauce before adding the meat sauce. I then baked it as directed, but left it in a little longer as the frozen ravioli wasn't as well done as I like them.

Easy, yummy! I can't ever find ravioli's so I have to improvise. I have used Bertoni's cheese/spinach filled ones just don't use the sauce, I know it's more expensive this way but much better than the sauce in the package. I then follow this exactly as written and my family loves it!

This was great! Had 2 tweak it a bit. Used ground turkey instead of beef, added italin seasoning, added garlic when browning turkey and also added onion, added garlic powder, and only made 1 layer. 2 of the sauce, 1 bottom and 1 top added parm cheese to the top and didn't cover with foil but I lowered the temp to 375 and still cooked 4 30 minutes

My family really enjoyed this one!  I did add onion powder and garlic powder to the ground meat.  I used a can of seasoned stewed tomatoes, instead of diced, and processed in my food processor...kids don't care for chunks...used mozzarella, parmesan and parsley.  Baked and enjoyed!  A keeper here...easy and delicious!

I didn't have all the ingrediants needed so I improvised a bit. I didn't have ground beef, but I did have spinach and some beef ravioli. So I used half beef and half cheese ravioli and threw in some spinach. It was good. Were I to make it that way again I would use less sauce. I want to try it the right way too.

it was okay.  i used the whole package of ravioli.  i can't imagine using less than that.  i also used a 25 ounce jar of sauce.  it was good but seems as though it is missing something.  i might try making it again sometime and maybe add mushrooms.

This was really good! I have made it twice already and will definitely make it again! However, I have these suggestions. It's worth it to get fresh ravioli... the frozen stuff tasted too pasta-like and not cheesy enough. I LOVE cheesy ravioli. I'd also be careful adding the mozzarella as it has a tendency to separate and make the recipe really liquidyy. Next time I will try making this with ricotta cheese to more resemble a basic lasagna.   Overall though, this was quick and easy and really tasty! Especially with a bit of garlic bread on the side.

Good but the ravioli does get kind of soggy. I used a twenty something ounce jar of pasta sauce and an eight ounce can of tomato sauce along with the diced tomatoes because I used the complete bag of frozen ravioli minus eight of them and I only had 1/2 pound of ground turkey. Very easy and quick for a week night dinner.

Added mushrooms and onions when cooking ground beef and left out tomatoes. This was good but not spectacular. Would probably make again when Im in the mood for something Italian but dont want to make lasagna or spaghetti.

This is man pleasing food, that is simple to make.  My husband actually suggested maybe adding spinach to the dish or other favorite pasta flavors.  I am thinking of doing a chicken/alfredo, with broccoli and spinach mixed in.  This cuts up beautiful, and so uniform in it's squares.

I skipped the diced tomatoes because I'm not a huge fan of them and used the whole bag of ravioli's. Delicious!  I prepared it early in the day and refrigerated until dinner time which saved a little time in the evening. I will make this instead of lasagna from now on!

This was so easy to throw together.  I added garlic, salt and pepper to season the beef.  I also used both Mozzarella and Parmesan to top it and let it turn golden.  My family loved it.  It was very easy to double the recipe.

This is a very easy casserole to make~ I had to work, so I left it for my husband and kids.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I made enough to put in a 9X13 dish, so the kids could take leftovers to school in their thermoses the next day.  There is still enough left to have for leftovers again!  This is just a nice twist on simple ravioli: )

This is a super easy delicious recipe. My husband is not big on italian food, but he actually asked for 2nds as well as enjoyed the leftovers. I did have to use 1 1/2 jars of sauce, which is more than it was called for!

I make this recipe as written and my whole family really likes it. I make it with garlic bread and a salad. Definitely a kid friendly meal. You definitely need the diced tomatoes or it comes out to dry.

GREAT IDEA! This is so easy to prep and put in the oven for a warm hearty meal. My family loves it, I have made it a few times and will keep making it. My husband always says something about how much he likes it. Easily a five star recipe just for how easy, good and fast it is!

Very good and very easy! I took the suggestion of others and cooked the raviolis first. Bought beef raviolis by mistake, but they were really good.  Would certainly make again and is a great dish to take to a family who you might be cooking meals for.

This has become my comfort food favorite.  It is particularly good with spinach ravioli (or you could use spinach in the layers).  It's good with beef, but sometimes I use ground turkey because it's less greasy.

This was definitely a fast meal to make when you are short on time or just plain lazy to think.  I found the flavors to be like any casserole that uses pre-made items -- 'just okay'. A ho-hum recipe.

This was so easy to make, on a night that I really didn't feel like spending a lot of time in the kitchen!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also seasoned the meat with onion, garlic, italian seasoning, salt, pepper.  I cooked the ravioli (I used the entire package).  Also I added a small can of tomato sauce and paste to make more sauce.  I used an italian cheese mix.  I really enjoyed it.  Served with ceasar salad.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

Not fabulous.  I already have a ravioli recipe but wanted meat to add to it.  Used 29oz of ravioli, an entire jar of spaghetti sauce because it looked too dry ( I hate crusty baked pasta), and added extra cheese on top.  I skipped the tomatoes (was supposed to be drained anyway) and mushrooms because no one in this house likes either.  It didn't have much flavor and I just thought it was rather blah.  I love pasta and ravioli, but maybe if I choose to make it again I will add some oregano/basil or some other veggie.  Very easy to make though!

Kids and husband loved it.  We like it saucier so needed to add more sauce and I topped it with cheese before putting on the foil.  Very easy and filling.

This recipe reminds me of lasagna only much easier to make. I do use a whole 26 oz can or jar of spaghetti sauce and I put it in a 9 x 13 dish as the smaller size tends to overflow. This is a great recipe to make for someone who has just had a baby. This is very yummy!!

The whole family loved this recipe. I have made it several times and it is super easy to prepare. After browning the meat and adding spaghetti sauce, I add salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder and oregano. Left over spaghetti sauce works great with this recipe.

It was pretty good.  I made it without the beef, so it was more like baked ravioli.  I needed more time in the oven, so that might help next time.  Otherwise, it was just OK.

I found this to be not too impressive.  I used a home made spaghetti sauce. I would make this again if I had ravioli to use up, otherwise I would just stick to lasagna.

Alright, but unnecessary.  Cooking the ravioli, browning the 'burger, layering then baking?  The extra effort didn't really give a much better result.  (Added onion, red & green bell pepper, Penzey's Italian Herb and fennel.)

Honestly, when I got it the only way I could eat it was to spread it around like regular ravioli. It didn't stick together at all. Also, I will use more sauce next time. There was barely any left after the ravioli soaked it up, and they were still a little hard and chewy.

FANTASTIC! I rarely give recipes 5 stars but this one was great! Not only great tasting, but easy to make! I followed the advice of another reviewer & added tomato paste to thicken things up and I also added chopped onions and green pepper to the hamburger while it was frying.  I could not stop eating this, my guests loved it, awesome!! Served it with some breadsticks and a green tossed salad and you have a simple, nutritious, inexpensive meal that does not take a lot of time to prepare.

This was actually very good, my only fear was it would be too bland for my palette so I did season the beef  with thyme, sage and black pepper and added some garlic to the mix.  It was very yummy!!!  This is a keeper!!!

This was very good.  A nice change from plain old ravioli.  Use the smaller square ravioli, they cooked better.  Will make again.

This was really good. Very easy too. Great work night meal. Family really enjoyed it. I used a mixture of italian cheeses. Served with green salad and garlic bread. Will make again.

Some of us need these easy "open can" recipes from time to time!  I skipped to diced tomatoes to appease my family and added extra spaghetti sauce. Excellent quick recipe.

The diced tomatoes made the sauce very bitter and the cheese inside the ravioli was just "different tasting". I would suggest mixing a cheese and beef ravioli, instead of the cheese. Also, don't use generic brand...trust me.

Per suggestions and comments, I also made some changes.  I added two cloves garlic and a small onion to the beef while browning.  I also added in some seasoned diced tomatoes w/basil, garlic and green pepper.  I went ahead and did 2 cups of mozz cheese since that's all I had.  Surprisingly the leftovers the next day did taste like lasagna!  A very good and heartwarming meal.

This combined my love of pasta and cheese with my boyfriend's love of meat. It turned out great. I left out the tomatoes, and added cheese how I felt it needed to be added. Very tasty, will make again and again!

Wonderful! Used our own homemade sauce, and added homemade roasted red peppers and mushrooms. We did not add the tomatoes and used only mozzeralla cheese. Tasted excellent and will make again. Thanks for the idea!

Used the full 25 oz of ravioli.  I partially boiled first and then baked at only 350 degrees for 20 minutes the layered double recipe.  It was a warm day and I didn't want to overheat the house with the oven.  This worked fine.  Not bad for a quick weekday throw together.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed other reviewers advice and used an entire 25oz pack of ravioli (to make two layers), and a 26oz jar of spaghetti sauce. I didn't have Monterrey Jack cheese, so I used Pepper Jack and Cheddar. Everything else I kept the same. This recipe is foolproof and delicious!

Mine did not come out as thick. I think I used too much diced tomatoes. I also added a layer of baby spinach. The dish actually came out really nice and was very delicious. As long as my boyfriend likes it, it's good!

I thought this recipe was awesome.  It was simple, tasty and my husband LOVED it!  I didn't include the tomatoes because I don't care for them.  We also used 1/2 a pound of Italian sausage and added some mushrooms.  I used the frozen ravioli and everything came out perfect.  We make this when our friends come over because it's so easy and they love it as well.  My only problem is no matter how many times I make this I never end up with the last layer being sauce.  Instead it's the ravioli and cheese on top.  It works for me though

Great recipe! I had ravioli on hand and found this recipe so I could use it.  I did have to make a few changes in order to use just what I had on hand. I didn't have any ground beef or sausage, so I used cooked chicken instead. I sauteed fresh minced garlic, fresh sliced mushrooms, and frozen peppers and onions in a stick of real butter and about a tbsp. of veg. oil. When it was done, I added the cooked chicken.  Next I added a jar of Bertolli's Vineyard Fire-Roasted Tomatoes pasta sauce.  I let this simmer on low for about 20 minutes, stirring often.  I wasn't sure whether to pre-cook the ravioli (I used store-brand mini-ravioli) or not, but I went ahead and cooked it, just in case. :-)  I cooked the whole 24 oz. bag, but had about 1/3 of it left over (no more room in the dish - with a bigger dish, I would have used the whole bag). I sprayed a round casserole dish (only cass. dish I have) with veg. spray, then layered everything as directed.  I baked it with the lid on at 400 deg. for about 35 minutes.  It was fantastic!  Can't wait to try it again with ground beef, sausage, maybe spinach/cheese ravioli - the possibilities are endless!  My husband and I both loved it - thank you so much for this great, basic recipe!

OMG! I just made this dish and it was AWESOME! The only thing is that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and I chopped up onion in the meat. But it turned out delicious. And it was easy!!

This was a very good recipe and I'll be making this again. I only changed a couple of things.  One, is that I used an entire 25 ounce package of frozen ravioli, and then of course had to bake it longer than 30 minutes.  I also used a regular size jar of pasta sauce since I used more pasta.  25 or 26 ounce jar.  I also used colby-jack instead of monterey-jack cheese just because it's what I had on hand, and used twice the amount of cheese than what the recipe says to use.  It came out wonderful!  We loved it.

This recipe definitely has potential, but I found myself making far too many taste adjustments.  My husband thought the dish tasted good, but little did he know how many spices I had to add to get it up to par.  Perhaps using a different tomato sauce would have made the recipe tastier.  I will continue to experiment with the basic idea.  By the way, i used the refrigerated ravioli, and it seemed to work well.

We all liked this. It was easy and good. I only used about 1/2lb of gr.beef and 3/4c of each cheese. I left out the diced tomatoes(picky eaters) so added a bit more sauce. I baked in a 2qt casserole with a lid and it was perfect in 35min. A little saucy, but I think you need all the sauce since you arent precooking the ravioli. I used spinach and cheese ravioli.

This recipes was unclear. You must first precook the ravioli. It was dry and needed more cheese. I will not make this again.

Was good stuff. I added extra cheese like was suggested, and used the whole bag of ravioli. My boyfriend and I liked it a lot, but I have to say that it was even better left over!

This recipe was very easy to make, but just a bit bland. I added some italian seasoning, fresh garlic..but it didn't help it much. I think it might have been the brand (rosetti) raviolis. My husband gave it a 3.5 out of 5, but said that he'd eat it again. Nice for a change of pace or something to make up quickly.

Liked the taste of this very much. Even my picky eaters ate it up. I didn't find it necessary to pre-cook the ravioli as others mentioned. I made it with ground round and with a basic store brand tomato & basil sauce from a jar. I didn't make layers as specified. A layer of sauce, the ravioli, all of the cheese and sauce on top. This one's a keeper.

I thought this recipe was great with a couple of changes.  I cooked the ravioli prior to baking.  I cooked the beef with 1/2 cup chopped onion and a chopped up a roasted head of garlic I had on hand.  I also used a large can of spaghetti sauce and I doubled the amount of cheese.  I ended up putting a pan below the baking dish because it filled my 11x17 up all of the way and bubbled over while cooking.  It was a great, easy dinner.  Thanks!

This was simple to make but a bit bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, but should have tried it using sausage and onions as other reviewers mentioned.  Just to perk it up a little.

great way to use frozen ravioli- fancies it up a bit and makes it look much more appealing.  I served with meatballs and some extra marinara sauce. cheap dinner that tastes and looks great!

Tried this last night and was a big hit for my family. I have a son who is not fond of pasta, but said this was like Lasagna only without the noodles. Loved it. Will make it again. We also doubled the recipe so I could feed more teenagers.

My husband really liked this dish!  I made a few changes, including substituting Italian sausage for the ground beef and sauting it with onion and minced garlic.  I used three cheese raviolis, doubled the spaghetti sauce and used a combination of mozzarella and Cheddar cheeses.  Easy to make and one I'll definitely make again...

This recipe is fantastic... please don't listen to the negative comments about opening cans.. you can put your own spin on this but it's still a great recipe.  I used sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef and I ended up using 3 (8 oz.) sauce cans (that's what I had on hand) w/ the diced tomatoes.  The recipes says to end with sauce on top but I ended with cheese (I used mozzarella, colby and m. jack), covered it and cooked it for 30 minutes.  Then I took off the foil and cooked it for another 15, only to get the cheese nice and bubbly.  I used 1.25 lb of sausage, a whole (25 oz) bag of ravioli and put the recipe into two 8x8 pans, cooking one for dinner and putting the other in the freezer for later! I would have LOVED to put some ricotta in this too but I was all out. =(

I think how good this recipe is depends on the kinds of ravioli and spaghetti sauce you use.  So really, I'm rating it 4 stars because I chose good pre-made ingredients to use.

Very easy and very yummy!  :)  I added some Italian seasoning, chopped onion and garlic powder to the beef while it cooked to add a little more flavor.  But otherwise, it was perfect!   Thanks for a great, quick weeknight recipe!  :)

This is so easy and so good!  I added crumbled hot italien sausage with the ground beef and also added some oregano and basil to the sauce mix.  Great potluck dish and 30 minute meal.

Delicious.  I used a 9/13 pan and 26 ounces of sauce with the entire bag of ravioli. Even the kids liked it.

This made a great meal!  Since it was the weekend, I had time to make my own sauce.  However, this will make a great easy supper on any busy weekday.  Common sense will tell you, if you do not like prepared sauce (which many do, hence all the brands and varieties) you may not enjoy this "quick" dinner.  Dinner time is the most important meal because this is the one time most families come together.  And I personally prefer the baked ravioli's over a McDonalds drive thru any day!

I've made this with both beef and cheese ravioli, and it's a tasty dish. However both times I've made it, the sauce has been too watery. I drained the tomatoes and the beef. It does thicken as it sits, however. Overall a pretty good and easy recipe, although it takes awhile for a weeknight meal.

A easy recipe with 5 star rating from both my husband, my son and I also loved it!  Used seasoned italian sausage and full bag of ravioli.  Will use 9x13" pan next time.  I did not have mozarella so used romano, ricotta, parmasean and monteray jack.  Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe. I did change it up a little by leaving out the tomato since we did not have any on hand. I also added ricotta cheese (whole milk as it tastes better) to the sauce and it tasted great!  But, I always add ricotta cheese to my sauces so I may be a bit biased.  Great recipe and very easy to make!

This is a really good meal for a cold day... very hearty, very delicious.  You can get more out of it if you choose the right spaghetti sauce and use tomatoes with herb additions (or add your own).  Very filling, very satisfying, thanks!!!!!!!

This was good for a quick weekenight meal, although I was the only one who really liked it. I followed the recipe, except I used mozzarella cheese instead of monteray jack.  I may make this again for a speedy dinner.

This is the greatest, fastest, easiest, recipe ever!  I worked 12 hours, got home at 4:00 pm, and we were eating supper at 5:30.  Now, this is the kind of recipe I want.  My family flipped out!
I made this recipe just like it says to and I can't wait to again. Thanks!

My picky family loved this recipe! I did add a couple shakes of garlic powder and oregano to the sauce for a more Italian flavor. It's a quick after-work meal that's delicious and filling. Will be making it again soon!

This was a BIG hit!  It was so easy and quite delicious!  I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, left out the diced tomatoes and broiled it for 4-5 minutes after I put the parmesan cheese on!  Yummy!!!

GREAT - What a wonderful casserole dish.  I did not change a thing and it came out perfect. Sooooo easy to make and this would be perfect for a buffet.  Can't wait to make this for the next birthday gathering.

This was a very beefy dish.  It was easy and rather inexpensive to make.  My family are still crying for more.

Very Good, even my 1 year old loved it.  I didnt add the extra can of tomatoes if your spaghetti sauce is chunky you don't need it I just added a little water for extra juice and a blend of pizza cheese.  I will definitely pass this on and make it again!

Quick, easy and delicious! I added a little seasoning to the ground beef when I cooked it which gave the ravioli more of an authentic Italian taste.

Good, quick, and easy to make. Can't beat that after a long day! I will, however, omit the tomatoes next time. I found myself adding alot of spices after I added them. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was really good...I added more cheese, but it really needs more sauce.  I like it a lot though..and my husband though it was great.  I will make this again.

Delicious! The posted recipe says it makes six servings, but we found it made just the right amount for four portions. Will definitely make it again.

This was a quick weeknight meal.  We all liked it a lot.  I did add some additional spices and a little more sauce on top because it seemed a little dry.  I will put this in my recipe box!
