This is a great cheesecake recipe. Both my husband and myself liked it. However, I do not really taste any eggnog flavour. It is just a great basic cheesecake with a little rum flavour. It should be called rum cheesecake. Next time I will try replacing some cream with eggnog and adding some more nutmeg.

This cheesecake would have been perfect if I had used actual rum instead of rum extract.  Three tablespoons of extract was WAY too much. Don't do what I did!  Other than my mistake though, this is a good cheesecake recipe.  The crust was good, and the cake itself didn't crack and had a good, heavy texture.  I will make it again this Christmas, but will either use real rum or only 1 tablespoon of extract.

This was a good cheesecake. But, eggnog? Not really. I told everyone that it was an eggnog cheesecake and then it didn't taste like eggnog at all. It made a liar out of me. It just tasted like cheesecake. Also, I would use a 10 inch springform pan because it raised so far above the top of the 9 inch that it cracked.

I've used this recipe before and loved it, but I was out of town without my Kraft cookbook and thought that I'd have to find a new eggnog cheesecake that didn't call for eggnog. I was thrilled to find the same recipe here.

My class making cheese cakes for a fastival.We chose this one to sell. It is delicious to taste and see. It tastes like eggnog that I drink during the holidays. It is spicy and I can taste the nutmeg. Yum! It is going to be huge seller!

I used 1 1/2 tbsp rum extract because I didn't have rum, and replaced the cream with egg nog. It was fantastic!
