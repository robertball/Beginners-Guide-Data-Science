I made this cake for a friend who has celiac's disease and it was a huge hit.

The chocolate ganache was very good, but if I make again I will put it in the refrigerator to set.  (I'm new to this so maybe that seems obvious but...)  

I would have also used less bitter chocolate for the topping.

Otherwise a fabulous melt in your mouth cake.

I made this cake for my son's (named William) birthday, and it has become a tradition in our house. I used Ghiradelli Chocolate and the quality of the finished torte was impressive, restautant qaulity.

This was easy to make and really delicious.  It is very, very rich which is why I gave it 4 stars...a little too rich for me with the glaze.  I'm going to revise the recipe to lower the carbs by using oil, cocoa and splenda and completely eliminate the glaze though it was very good...just to reduce richness and carbs.  Excellent recipe.  Great for gift giving.

This is a lovely flourless chocolate cake recipe. It's super-rich and like a baked chocolate mousse. I dusted the top with icing sugar and served with thick cream and berries.

My friends loved this when I served it recently.  Like most flourless cakes it doesn't look terribly pretty as the top sinks and cracks, but the taste makes up for it.

This was an excellent cake, but I've had better ones. I'm still on the hunt for the best flourless cake available.

Woah!!  this cake was so rich i could barely eat a sliver without getting a headache.  my mom thought it was awesome but it was just too rich for my husband and i.  i think the ganache was just a little over the top.  maybe some powdered sugar sprinkled over the top instead of the ganache would make it less rich.

Fantastic for a flourless cake! I used milk chocolate for the ganache. You can safely cut the glaze recipe in half. I had a pool of glaze around my cake and plenty left in the bowl. Save yourself half a pound of chocolate and don't make the full batch of icing.

It's very rich, but absolutely delicious. I would use about 1/2 the ganache to cut down on the richness.

My son requested this for his 10th birthday, so I gave it a go.  Came out great- not hard at all to make.  However, the birthday boy thought it was "too chocolatey", whatever the heck that means, lol!  Honestly- it is very, very rich.  You need to slice a very small piece and make sure you have plenty of milk... or vanilla ice cream... to complement it.  I thought that perhaps I would reduce the amount of ganache when I make it again, but my husband says NO WAY. He savored every last bite, and has already requested that this be what I make for HIS birthday this year. I'm wondering how it would be with milk or white chocolate, and I might have to experiment a bit next time.
Bottom line is, if you love dark chocolate, this is the cake for you.

I tried this recipe because of the reviews, my mom is gluten free and the ingredients are not hard to find. 
This is an excellent recipe!!! 
Mom was very happy with it! It is very rich so you only need a small piece and some cold milk.
I didnt need to use all of the ganache though.

This recipe is easy to navigate. Few ingredients that produce a dark and perfectly fudge like cake.   The ganache. Oh my goodness. Perfect dark chocolate deliciousness. 
I also made a raspberry sauce to serve with it.

Keeping in mind the other reviews who commented that the ganache was overwhelming, I omitted it and served the cake with a fresh raspberry sauce and homemade whipped cream. The raspberries and whipped cream complimented the chocolate cake very well-all that was left were a few crumbs!

Jennelson made this for our son and I made it this year. It was a taste of home for him. It’s super rich and absolutely amazing with vanilla bean ice cream. After going through the process once it’s a pretty easy recipe and I will be making it again next year.

This did not work out for me although I did not have evaporated milk so It wasn't the exact recipe. I used a combination of whole milk and cream. The cake was crumbly on the plate when served.

Simply divine and worth the work. I'm not fully satisfied with the ganache yet.
