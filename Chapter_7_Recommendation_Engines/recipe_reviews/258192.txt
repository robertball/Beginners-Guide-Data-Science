A delightful change from the normal quesadilla. I'm not a big fan of red or kidney beans so I used pintos. These quesadillas are packed full of flavor. To make things easy I warmed one side of the tortilla, flipped it over and spread the cheese over the entire tortilla. Then I placed the filling on only half of the tortilla and folded over the other half on top. No flipping of a clumsy quesadilla.

The best quesadilla i have EVER had, my whole family was in LOVE with it!!!!!! Definitely making again! I added about two or three ounces more of bbq sauce to the bean chicken and bbq sauce pan, and it was backed full of delicious flavor!! the only thing i would add is you can make the tortillas a little crispy before you put in the cheese or filling!

I wasn't sure I would like BBQ sauce in quesadillas. However, it was actually quite tasty. My family loved it and asked me to make it again. That is quite a compliment, since my family is very picky.  My tip for this recipe is to use a pizza cutter to cut the quesadillas.

Not that good. The kidney beans dried out severely, both the beans and rice soaked up most of the BBQ and still it was kind of flavorless. Too much rice and I'd skip the beans if I ever tried this again but probably won't.

These were great. The taste can vary just by changing your barbeque sauce.  I used a sweet one this time but will be trying more of a smoky one next time. I loved the rice in this and so did my family.

This recipe is really good. I really liked the rice in the quesadillas, it added enough substance to make this quesadilla dinner instead of just a snack. I was left feeling full and satisfied!

This was a surprising five stars for me! My wife and I absolutely loved everything about this! We kept out the beans, but kept everything else as is in the recipe, and it was a total winner for us. The flavor was great! And the rice added a really nice texture to it all!

What an excellent idea! This went over so well with the kids. I had to use corn tortillas to keep it gluten free. I loved the rice flavor and bbq together. This is really a nice treat.

Yum! I used leftover chicken I had smoked the week before and these turned out excellent. I definitely think onion is a must and while I think red is the best choice, green is all I had and that worked nicely too. As always, I recommend using a BBQ sauce you are familiar with and like. This is a great way to use up leftover chicken and one I will most definitely make again.

This was a really nice twist on a basic at our house.  It was flavorful and filling.  I can see this becoming a staple here.  Next time I will add a little red onion and cilantro.

These are a great way to change up your traditional quesadilla! I'd probably add some green chilis and green onions next time. Easy to make when you use the 90 seconds Uncle Ben's rice packs too. I served these with some avocado and sour cream and they made a perfect lunch!

Fairly mild, but a great meal for kids. I will definitely make this meal again.

Delicious! A great weekend lunch option. I made it exactly as described and wouldn't change a thing next time I make this.

What a great way to use up some leftover cooked chicken!  I used Trader Joe's wholewheat tortillas and Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy.  I also used the way that bd.weld said to make the quesadilla by folding it over.  This worked well for us, and it was easy to flip.  I did use pinto beans (I considered black beans).  This was really good.  Thanks, Uncle Ben's!

We really enjoyed this dish!   The combination of flavors worked beautifully.  The texture of the kidney beans was creamy and just perfect with the tangy taste of the BBQ sauce.  I would have never thought to add rice into the mix but the whole thing just worked so nicely.  I do think that, next time, I will use a red bean instead of the kidney bean  simply to balance the ingredients in the filling out.  As nice as the kidney beans were, they seemed a bit large for the filling.  Otherwise, it was a slam dunk!  Just delicious!

My family of 4 enjoyed these. This was my first time making a quesadilla and it was a struggle flipping them. They weren't pretty by the end of it but they were good! I made 4 quesadillas instead of 3 and still had a significant amount of mixture left over. If I make these again, next time I'd try another bean. I love kidney beans in chili but there were quite large in a dish like this. The only change I made to the recipe was I used UNCLE BEN'S® Original Converted® Brand Rice instead of Whole Grain Brown, as that's what I had on hand.
