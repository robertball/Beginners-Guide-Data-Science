My whole family loved it!  Easy clean up too!  The only change I made from the original recipe was to follow another reviewers advice & add beefy onion soup mix to the ground beef before making the patties.  We will definitely eat this again!

Before shaping the ground beef into patties, in addition to the salt and pepper, add onion salt, garlic salt and worcestershire sauce--not quite so bland after that.  Also, you could use the pre-packaged baby carrots your kids already munch on instead of the whole large carrots to save time.

We love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was mixing the ground beef with onion soup mix for more flavor.

I really liked this dish.  I did change the recipe a little bit though.  I seasoned the beef with Johnny's seasoning salt and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also used baby carrots and put celery in it and an extra onion. I sprinkled Johnny's seasoning salt over the top of everything. It was delicious!

My mother-in-law has made these for years. She makes them in individual foil packets and sprinkles them liberally with Worcestershire sauce and Heinz 57 sauce.

My dad used to make these for us when we were kids.  I now use turkey burger and then season it with a garlic powder, salt and pepper mix.  I then add approximately a 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soup per hobo and then the onions, carrots, celery and potatoes - wrap it up in foil, put it in the oven and bake as directed in this recipe - my hubby loved it!

We make these into individual packets and cook on the grill.  We also add a few spoonfuls of cream of mushroom soup straight from the can to make a nice gravy. I also add 1 Tb. minute rice and 2 ice cubes with the soup instead of potatoes for hubby who does not like potatoes.  (The ice cube is easier to wrap than the water.)

Good, but will make sure the beef is extra lean so it isn't sitting in much of the drippings.

We really liked this recipe.  I went with others recommendations and added Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the meat.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and just layered on the bottom of the pan as opposed to making patties.  I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt on vegetables.  My husband and I both agreed that this recipe will be added to a regular ground beef recipes.

Have been making these for years, mostly on camping trips.  Maybe that's why I like them, we only get them a few times each summer.  I like to crumble the meat instead of patties.  Although I would never make these for dinner when at home, the recipe is a VERY simple way to make meat and potatoes...a dish my boyfriend USED to live off of.

I am only rating this a 5 because of the changes I made as per other people. I wanted to use onion soup mix in the hamburger, but I didn't have any. So I settled for mixing in Worcestershire sauce, some onion powder, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, and season salt. Other changes: Used a yellow onion, baby carrots, and added 3-4 cloves of fresh minced garlic. Then I gently poured a cup of beef broth over all and sprinkled with fresh ground pepper and coarse salt. This got very good and flavorful, and the meat was nice and moist from the broth.

Have had these before so the recipe is not new to me.  The biggest thing I do different is I wrap each individual portion in heavy duty aluminum foil, add a little butter and seal tightly and put them on the grill.  Doing it this way enables everyone to adapt the recipe to their own taste (more or less spice, different veggies etc.)  Easy to put together and easy to clean up afterwards.

I would not cook as the recipe says!!!We loved it, but I tossed the veggies in olive oil, rosemary, and a couple of other spices.  About the time the vegs started getting tender, they also looked pretty dry, added seasoned chicken broth.  Putting meat on top so juices flow into the vegs may make more moist as well.

I only gave 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe exactly. What turned out was worth 5 stars for sure! To the ground meat (we used deer meat), I added dry bread crumbs (homemade, Panko-type), garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion powder, minced onion, and 2 eggs. Yes, it is very similar to meatloaf. Then, I shaped into small, thin patties and followed the rest of the recipe as written. I also made a white, pan gravy to go with this meal. Even my picky son commented that it was WAY better than he expected. He is not big on cooked carrots but he said he could eat the meat and potatoes everyday. That is a gigantic compliment! We will make this again for sure!

I have made something very similar for years, only I make them in indivdual foil pockets and add my favorite bar-b-que sauce on top of everything and cook on the grill. One of my families favorite summertime meals!

I thought this was super delicious! I followed other suggestions and added more seasoning. I added chopped onions to the ground beef as well as bouillon granules, garlic powder, pepper, and seasoned salt.

Thanks for sharing! It was perfect and very filling.

I really liked this recipe as it was easy and quick to prepare. I tweaked it a little bit to my husbands tastes though. I used my vegetable peeler to shave slivers of the carrots instead of large pieces cut lengthwise (my husband isn't too big on carrots). I also added diced tomatoes as a layer in between the potatoes and the meat. The potatoes I cut into large coin shaped pieces. I also used fresh garlic I minced myself and I sprinkled powdered bouillon over the meat as well. All in all a good recipe!

Sorry, but this was rather bland.  Some more herbs or spices (or flavouring of any kind) would be needed to make this worth making again.

My mom made this for me growing up & she got the recipe from her mom.  Sometimes I add a package of onion soup mix, and sometimes I just add a good bit of worcestershire sauce both to the meat, and then more on top of the patty/veggies.  Also, I make individual foil packets instead of one big one.

I tried this recipe, noting that many reviewers said it needed some more spice than the orginal. I used salt, pepper, garlic salt, and soy sauce for the ground beef. It turned out great, the soy sauce gives such a great subtle flavor when used moderately! Easy to make, all in one dish. I will definately make this again!

My husband really liked this recipe. I added 1 pckg dry onion soup mix to the meat to add some flavor. I only used 3 big potatoes and that was plenty. I didn't have any big carrots so I just threw in a couple handfuls of the baby carrots and those worked great.

I have friends who make this when camping, they double up on the foil and toss the individual packets right on the coals, with varied success.  When I tried this I actually used those frozen burger patties, potatoes and onions, and some seasoned salt.  We did individual aluminum packets for each child so they could choose the amount of "veggies" inside, we sealed them up very good and tossed them on a cookie sheet to bake, they came out very good (even with the use of those nasty frozen hamburgers).

This is so easy and tastes better than it sounds like it would. I did add 1 clove minced garlic and did not form the ground beef into patties. I browned the meat and drained it then added the rest of the ingredients to it. We all liked it and I will be making this again. Thanks!

I love how easy this is... especially on nights where my husband and child need to eat and I can't make them dinner! We used more than one pound of ground beef. I think next time I might put some butter on top to give the potatoes a bit of that flavor. Overall, it is was great!

We always put condensed cream of mushroom soup in them and used seasoned salt instead of regular. Delicious! I grew up making these while camping. We would double the aluminum foil and lay the on the grill over the campfire.

this was pretty good for how easy it was. instead of wasting foil i threw everything in a covered casserole and it worked great. i sprinkled some onion powder and drizzled some worcestershire on top. i will make this again but i will add seasonings to the meat before forming into patties. i really love making no fuss one pot meals during the week. this was great with some homemade bread and butter.

I grew up on Hobo Dinners, they were always a camping trip dinner. my mom always mixed in Lipton Onion soup mix instead of the onions (cuz' we wouldn't eat it with em') and put a few pieces of zucchini on top before wrapping up to keep it moist.

This was super yummy! BUT.... I added tons of seasonings to make it yummy. I cooked each person's meal individually wrapped in tinfoil. My kids thought it was so cool! I put the hamburger patty down first & seasoned it with garlic salt, salt, pepper, seasoning salt, onion salt & hamburger seasoning. Then I peeled & diced a potatoe up for each person & also carrots into round slices. I seasoned those with salt & pepper & garlic salt. Then I added 2 TBSP of butter ontop of everything & sealed the tinfoil up. I baked these in the oven on 400 degrees for about 45 min. My whole family loved it & it was super easy & very tasty & just something fun & different!

This is great and easy recipe!  My Mom used to make these for a no-mess Wednesday night dinner before Bible study.  I always make the ground beef patties with Lipton's Onion Soup Mix before putting them in with the rest of the veggies.  Makes them taste AWESOME! :)

This is not just a recipe - it's a new concept!  My family loved the original and also my turkey mince version with mushrooms, carrots, green onion (served with rice).  Possibilities are endless!

Good recipe when you don't have much time and need to throw something together quick. I do recommend using more spices, garlic is always a winner in my home and maybe making a quick gravy to serve with it. The brown package gravy mixed with the drippings works good for my family. A salad and yeast rolls....suppers done!

From the suggestions of other I added the Worchestershire sauce, ground black pepper, seasoned salt, garlic powder and onion powder mixed into the meat. Also took the suggestion of the beef broth poured over, fresh garlic and some butter. I added some fresh chopped parsley also. It came out fantastic. My boyfriend almost didn't leave me any :)... Thanks

I really liked this recipe.   I followed the advice of others and added onion soup to the hamburger.   And I mixed up about a cup of beef broth and poured it over the top before baking.  Was really good.    Even kids loved it.   My hubby even said it was great and made a suggestion that next time I make it to use half the hamburger and make them into meatballs and add a few sliced up italian (or other) sausages.  So I'm gonna try it again tonight like that.  Thanks for the recipe.

YUM! Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this!!! Although the concept isn't foreign to me (thanks to my time as a Girl Scout!), I've never made a hobo-style meal myself. Not only is this simple, stick-to-your ribs fare, it's flexible, frugal and easy to prepare. I do suggest a few alterations, however. Adding a packet of dry onion soup mix to your beef gives it incredible flavor. A generous splash of Worcestershire sauce and s&p (to taste) also goes a long way. My only gripe is that my beef patties were slightly overcooked at the hour mark. The veggies were perfectly tender tho, so I think I'll just pop them in the oven first and then add the meat (on top of the veggies) half way thru the cooking time. FYI, if you want to use baby carrots instead, you'll need about 16-20 of them. Thanks SO much for sharing your genius recipe, Debbie. This halved easily to accommodate my small family and tasted delicious. I can't wait to try this on the grill (in individual foil packets) this summer! :)

Made these for dinner one night and they were so good, so easy to make, so easy to clean up...they're adaptable too, if you want to spice differently. (though I made them as is)

Pretty good, and very easy to make, which I love! But I do know the next time I make this I will definatly add the onion soup mix to the burger...And maybe a little water since my potatoes and carrots were alittle hard still. But overall I will be making this one again!!

This is a recipe that my family has made for years! However, we always add an egg to the meat like you would if you were making meat loaf. It keeps the meat together while it is cooking and it adds flavor. I also season the meat with onion powder and garlic powder... Depending on what I have in my fridge I also add green beans and peppers.

We've been making this dish for generations.  My in-laws prefer to put it on the grill, I prefer the oven.  We all add golden mushroom soup and it makes ALL the difference.  I made it once before with cream of mushroom and we thought it was awful.  I hate mushrooms, but the golden mushroom soup adds the perfect flavor to this super easy meal!  It's also a meal my kids will eat without any fuss.

This is the only meal my Dad would cook when we were little!  There are a few differences between this recipe and how my Dad made it.  He usually browned the hamburger and onion together instead of making patties, sliced the potatoes thinly, and sliced the carrot into thin rounds.  We also added shredded cheese!  You can't live in Minnesota without adding cheese to your hot dish (a.k.a. casserole in most other parts of the country LOL!) He then layered them as follows: Hamburger, potatoes, carrots, salt and pepper to taste, a thin layer of shredded cheese and then repeat the potato, carrot and cheese layer again.   This way it doesn't take as long to bake and is easier for serving little ones because the hamburger is already in little pieces.    I think in the future when making this though, I will try what k4trln4 suggested in the review from Sept. 21, '09 and place the potatoes on the bottom of the dish so that they will get done faster!  Such a simple but good supper.

My 3 year-old daughter gobbled up the burger, my 6-year-old son engulfed the potatoes, and I ate it all, but my husband quietly left his plate full.  Here's why: this meal has an Old World taste.  Like Old World America circa 1950, which is Old World Poland, Russia, or Germany.  It isn't really very flavorful.  For me, this was a throwback to my dear late grandmother's cooking, and even the smell brought back a memory of her.  But, my grandmother fed me infrequently, while my husband's mother fed him mild food like this every day...and he now craves foods with gusto, flavor & punch!  This does not have any of that.  It is rather...um...I'm trying to put it politely, but let me say, it's simple.  Although I had a nostalgic YUM moment, I cannot see making it again.  AND, yes, I did flavor the meat with a dry onion soup mix first, and was plenty generous with the garlic salt, black pepper & sea salt.  But, it still dropped flat.

This has always been a simple and a favorite.  Even though it has simple ingredients, the flavor is great.  I add a little worcestershire sauce and garlic to the mix.  Make sure there's enough liquid as well, this can dry out easily

added the onion soup mix to the recipe and it was flavorful. I think I cut my potatoes too big and I used the mini carrots and didn't cut them so they never got soft, both of which I'd do differently next time.

Very tasty if a little underseasoned for my preferences. I did substitute baby carrots and I added some seasoning to the meat to make it even more flavorful.

This recipe needs a lot of help.  This is extremely bland and very boring - tastes like something you would eat if you had to go camping.  Ground beef rolled into balls = no flavor.  Maybe add some oregano, parsley, garlic and onion to the beef before making it into patties?  Maybe add a can of tomato sauce?  I really don't know - this is just so, so bland and not very good.

This is one of my kids favorite.  My family used to make in when we used to  camp and it was just passed down.  I use ground turkey mixed with a ranch dip packet(Not the dip, just the mix!).  For seasoning, I always use Mrs. Dash original seasoning.  We add bell pepers and cabtbage and this makes for a very quick, tasty and filling meal.

Much too bland and dry. If I were to try it again I would add some tomatoes and juice to add some moisture and flavor. Maybe some additional veggies would help as well. It has potential but needs some work.

We use to pack these in the cooler & bury them in the fire coals while camping...As others have suggeseted, def. add onions, potatoes & cabbagge.  Polish sausage works well if you want to subsitute the ground beef.  Give your oven a rest & use your grill!!!  YUM-O!

My mom made this for us and we all loved it! She said she learned this as Girl Scout Leader. What she did different is to add Italian Salad Dressing to each pouch. All the spices made it taste great and gave it a little kick. Thanks mom!

THe only thing I did differently was add a generous amount of lemon pepper seasoning and cabbage.  I think the cabbage gave it just the right amount of moisture and flavor.  Thanks! It was yummmmmy!

These are okay if you are camping or really really hungry. Not much flavor, very bland. Need a lot more seasoning, but then I am used to eating highly seasoned food and lots of hot peppers and hot sauce, so maybe it was just me.

Kind of plain...I may need to get a more flavorful ground beef. I bought the extra lean kind this time. Either that or maybe using some AI marinade sauce on the beef would help?? It just needs....something. I loved this growing up though, so I'll try it again. The veggies get SOOO tender!

I've been making this dish for years, but over the fire in foil packets.  This is a great idea for a very simple make-ahead meal.  I add a few more seasonings like garlic powder and soy sauce.  I also layered it like a lasagna.  It takes longer than an hour, maybe 1 hr 20 min.  It also is tasty to put velveeta over it all and let it melt in at the end.  I also drained the grease at one hour and at the end.  A family pleasing dish!

We've been making this recipe for years and it is so easy and good.  We add cabbage which really adds a lot of flavor. We also wrap them up individually in foil so that they can go in the oven, on the grill, or on the campfire.

This was a great meal.  Next time I make I'm going to double the recipe.  Everyone wanted more and we ended up running out! I did modify by adding oregano, italian seasoning & dill weed to the meat. I also added some cheese to the top when it was done cooking.  EXCELLENT!

I liked this. Was not the best dinner but was edible. I browned the patties in a fry pan to reduce the amount of grease that would inevitably drip out and season them with Webber’s Chicago Steak seasoning and just a little salt pepper and garlic powder on the veggies. I would make again.

I love this recipe. Sometimes I add a 1/4 of a green or red pepper, in summer I add squash or tomato (usually at last 1/2 of cooking time.) Have also substituted chicken with success

My family has been making this for 30 years with the addition of a key ingredient and the last thing we add is a can of diced tomatoes and pour the tomatoes juice on top then salt and pepper.  My mom always made each family member our own little pouch with our favorite vegetables which for me Patotoes, Onions, Mushrooms, green beans.  Sometimes she added a little cabbage.  It was always a total meal with fresh rolls.  Play with it and come up with your liking but tomatoes and a little juice poured on each one is the key.  Hope this helps for the ones who said it was dry.

This is so much better than it sounds.  You have to use lean ground beef or it will just be so greasy. I make the it the night before then just pop it in the oven after work the next day. I have make a lot and my family likes it.

I have made this recipe a million times - I had the same recipe before I found this one on here - and I LOVE IT! It is a very simple recipe that anyone can adapt to their own tastes. I season it differently everytime. For the most part, we do individual foil packets for each family member or friend that is eating so the meal is specific to each person. We also add fresh or canned mushrooms for those who like them. Mostly, we make Hobo Dinners in the summer and cook them over the grill...for about 45mins. FABULOUS!

Make these up a day in advance of your next camping outing.  Freeze them over night inside the foil.  Thaw and cook on the coals of your campfire.  Eat right from the foil.  You have to cook it quite a bit longer, but it is the easiest camp meal you'll ever eat.

For years our family has made "foil dinners", a small meal placed in individual foil packets and thrown into the coals at the campfire to cook, for every camping trip.  It's tradition, so when my 12yo daughter saw this recipe she got so excited and couldn't wait to try it.  We had simply never thought to try it at home.  What a fun and simple idea.    We followed our family recipe, which is similar to the changes many others make.  We add heaps of pepper, onion soup mix, and garlic to the beef, then top everything with extra pepper, Chugwater Chili Powder, and some salt.  It's like camping without lugging the gear out!

Just like I remember making in foil packets in the campfire while I was growing up!  So very easy and filling.  No one complains about a good oldfashioned hobo dinner.

Perfect for the picky eater in your life.  This was a girl scout favorite of mine when I was young. We would place potato slices on the bottom followed by the seasoned hamburger patty, a slice of onion for flavor and lastly grated carrot.  Keep the potato on the bottom, otherwise it might not cook through all the way through!  Cooking the packets over a fire makes them great for camping, too.

This was okay. I made a couple changes the second time around. I dipped the meat patties into dry onion soup mix and omitted the onion and salt. I sliced the potatoes rather than chopping. I layered them over and under the meat patties. I sprinkled coarsely crushed pepper over the top of the carrots. We like dipping these in steak sauce. Yummy!

Very tasty, especially with seasonings on the meat and again on the veggies.  The only downfall for me was all the fat juice it was sitting in...like another person said, make sure it's low fat meat.  I may even try ground turkey next time.

When we make Hobo dinners we make a packet out of foil for each person. First I layer each packet with ground beef patty, sliced potatoes, green beans, corn and sliced onion.  Then before sealing the packets we like to put cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup in each packet (do not add water). Just scoop the soup out of the can so each packet has an equal amount then seal and bake according to recipe directions. We love it!

This is a family favorite. I have made it a few times now and always as a beefy onion soup mix (Lipton's) to the meat before making the patties.  Then I make some kind of gravy to pour over the entire dish.  I have used all kinds of veggies as well.  Everything works great, so delicious!!

Well I can't argue with the ease of cleanup!  I thought they were tasty, but after reading the reviews of blandness, I seasoned both sides of the patties with Emeril's Steak Rub, then sprinkled Seasoned Salt on after adding the veggies.  A little greasy from the meat, but maybe you could put pieces of bread under the meat to soak up some of the fat??  Everything came out very tender and yummy - I'll make again!  May even try camping since I've never had them like that before.

I make these quite often and my recipe is very similar to this. I took the advice of this recipe and added some carrots and they were pretty yummy. I usually add a little bit of soy sauce just to add a bit of flavor and use the extra lean ground beef.

This is a very good meal. My only suggestion is to use lean meat and add butter to it before baking. I also season my meat to our liking before cooking. It also works to cook this on the grill, but you have to pay more attention to it and flip quite often. I grew up on this recipe as my dad would make it everytime we went camping (usually 2 or 3 times on each trip) making it over an open fire. It's been one of my favorites since I was 7 years old.

This recipe is very good and sooo simple to make! You can season it how you want and make it to your liking. I love making it because I always have the ingredients in my house and I can put it in the oven, go pick hubby up from work and dinner is done when we get home! Thanks for sharing this!! I always use Eskimo Joes Fry Seasoning on the meat, potatoes and carrots and it tastes great! I have made it probably 5 times in the last two months. Hubby requests this all the time.

My grandma made this a lot when I was young, except she would put individual servings in a microwave safe pie plate (covered with saran wrap) with all the listed ingredients as well as celery. To this day, it still brings back great memories.

This is the first time my husband has said "Give it 5 stars!!!" It was better than the times I put this kind of thing on the grill. I added onion soup mix (1/2 a pkg)to the meat. I added a little bit of beef broth (from boullion) and put in a few butter patties. My husband is HARD to please, but he loved this. Thank You!!!

Good recipe. Substituted fresh potatoes for canned new potatoes and canned carrots to the fresh ones. Used salt, pepper, and onion flakes for seasoning. Meat was extremely moist-just fell apart along with the veggies. Great recipes for those busy moms that need to throw some food in the oven fast while helping kids with baths and homework!

I substituted the potatoes for leftover cooked rice, which turned out great. I also threw in some chopped green bell pepper and shredded cabbage. It turned out great, other than the garlic salt and worcesteshire sauce I added for flavor made it *way* too salty. Next time I'll use no salt at all, but garlic powder and pepper with the worcesteshire sauce. I also would recommend increasing the amount of beef to 1.5 lbs. as 1 lb. really didn't cover the whole 9x13 pan (I thought patties were unnecessary, since the ingredients are spread in layers like a casserole.) Despite these "issues," though, it was really yummy and with a few tweakings can be a nice & easy dinner for the fam.

I agree about adding spices. Also, I think I cooked it too long. It turned out dry. 
However, I loved how it cooked everything evenly, and the spices I added made it taste great. Next time I'm going to try using a different kind of beef (like stew meat or something). Almost pot roast, but not. :-D

This is a favorite of mine.  I will say a trick I learned was to add little bits of butter in it.  I also make meatballs instead of patties and thinly sliced potatoes instead of steak fries along with the carrots and onions. Then I season it with Tony's Cachere's Cajon Seasoning salt and garlic powder and some pepper.

Had varied opinions on this dish. Hubby thought the veggies weren't done enough, kids didn't like the unseasoned beef, I wasn't too thrilled with the overall blandness. Next time I will try others advice and season the beef more, use some beef broth, and add butter and parsley. An easy dish with definate potential.

My dad Perry taught me how to make them when I was really young. Now Im 16. I found they are much more enjoyable if you take them out 5 min early, put a slice of velvita cheese on top, and put back into the oven for 5min. I cant eat a hobo without it!

Decent, but very blah. Consider changing the recipe to fit your tastes as far as seasoning go. Otherwise you'll end using too much salt and pepper for flavor in the end.

I did omit the carrots and replaced them with bell peppers. I did prepare them as individual servings in their own foil packets. Also I seasoned the individual patties with Pam spray (so the seasoning would adhere to the potatoes, onions, and bellpeppers),and used complete seasoning mix. Baked them, and served them as hambugers with the buns. The taste was great. Nothing but raves from family and friends. And you can't beat the easy clean-up, just toss the foil away. Thank you Debbie!!

This recipe needs some help. I added tomato sauce to it while on my plate and that helped. If I make it again I will add the tomato sauce or something else before I serve it.

I really liked this but the following additions really put this recipe over the top for my husband! I added Lipton 'beefy onion' soup mix,Worcestershire sauce, Kitchen Bouquet Browning & Seasoning Sauce, ketchup, light brown sugar to the meat.  Also, red and yellow bell peppers, and cut sweet grape tomatoes on top including the potatoes, onions and carrots. Very colorful and yummy!

Very good.  Meat was a bit bland, even after I added extra spices.  The veggies were my favorite and more than made up for the flavor of the meat.  Maybe spice up the meat more next time.  Would make again.  It was also very very easy =)!

I liked the ease of this recipe and will try it in the future, but it needs something; perhaps a little butter, or maybe just some spices.  In the future I will play with it a bit because it has potential, but as the recipe was, we all thought it was bland.

This was good, easy and filling. Next time I will put the veggies under the patties, instead of on top and o might try the onion soup mix that others have added.  Either way, I’m adding to favorites and will make it again.

Very good.  I agree that it is a good idea to add onion soup mix to the beef.  
A suggestion I have is to make it interactive for the kids!  Rather than doing it in a pan, make aluminum foil packets that the kids can build themselves.  Sandwich all ingredients between two cabbage leaves, then wrap the whole thing in foil.  The cabbage makes sure nothing sticks to the foil and also provides moisture to steam-cook the meal.  Be sure to seal the foil packets well, and then put them on a baking pan in case of any drippage.

Quick & so easy to make & cleanup. I used  1/4 lb ground chuck (80/20) patties. It wasn’t overly greasy. 
I added sliced garlic, sliced bell pepper and used small red potatoes. 
I added seasoning salt, garlic & onion powder, celery seed, & oregano. 
I sprinkled French onion soup mix on top and baked as directed. 

I served it smothered in brown gravy and my family enjoyed it. I’ll definitely make it again.

We used to make this exact recipe all the time in the boy scouts, except over a fire. I'm glad that more people are enjoying it now, since everyone back then thought it was strange or weird. Great recipe!

After reading other reviews; I tossed the veggies with a packet of lipton garlic and herb soup mix, used my thawed premade beef patties and added 2 tbl condensed cream of mushroom soup with a sprinkle of dried parsley to the top of the patty. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was a big hit. I crumbled lean ground beef into each packet,  added some EVOO,a banana pepper out of the garden and 2 Tbs. of Campbell's Fiesta Nacho cheese to each packet. Seasoned generously and put them on a hot grill for 30 minutes.

The meal was pretty easy and convenient to make. The worst part of it was peeling the vegetables. I loved that everything cooked together. I think next time I will substitute chicken for the beef and add a little more seasoning . Also the prep time was more than 15 mins. Maybe next time I will be a lot quicker peeling the potatoes and carrots!

This meal tasted alright when following the recipe. I would add more seasonings/ salt..maybe some chicken broth next time to give it a bit more flavor. It's definitely not the best recipe I've ever tried. Prep and cooking were very simple.

Two changes . . . . . celery and garlic powder.   Add cut celery to the mix of vegetables.   It adds significantly to the flavor.    Zucchini is another addition that you might want to try.  Get some green stuff in there!   Add garlic powder to the seasonings.   Presto!   Yum!   Easy clean up!

I added celery to this.  It's actually still cooking, but I have made similar meals in the past, but I'm now on a diet in which I have to strictly count calories, and doing this from memory makes it hard to compute calories, but this recipe has them listed.  It smells grand, and I can't wait.

My family went camping a lot when I was growing up, and this was a staple! If you have more than 2 or 3 people, double the amount of ground meat, because it shrinks when cooked. To add flavor, include chopped bell peppers. Have extra seasonings available, like seasoned salt, Cajun spices, etc., and of course, have ketchup on the table when you serve these. Those who don't like onion on theirs should sprinkle a little water on top before sealing up the foil packet - otherwise, it might stick due to insufficient moisture.

I have made this but I also add green beans and A1 sauce. I add spices to the hamburger before I patty them.  I put a couple slices of butter on top.  I wrap them up in aluminum foil individual meals into however many meals I am making and place them all onto a baking sheet

i wasn't expecting the burger to puff up!  However, I  will try again and add the soup mix to it.  Overall, it was quite delish.  i loved the veggies!  They were nice and tender.

Super easy meal!! You get your meat n tators all in one! I did make a few changes...as I had read some reviews that mentioned it was bland. I make the patties similar to what I do when I make burgers. I mix pepper, lipton onion soup mix, and saracha sauce with the ground meat. Place it in the pan top with onions, bell pepper, carrots, jalapeños (if you want some spice)  potatoes, then sprinkle with Tony chacheres and  Worcestershire, and a little soy sauce over it all and pop it on the oven. Yummmmm.

This is a really good recipe!  My variation is that I season the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder,  thyme leaves, and onion powder! Then I get baby carrots and little red potatoes which I cut in half! I also get ring of onions and whole garlic cloves which become like butter when the are cooked! Then I coat the veggies in olive oil so they can have a crunch and salt pepper and thyme! It's so delicious!!!

The thing I liked most about this was the potatoes, and that was only because I added in some beef broth to the dish before cooking. The rest of it I found very bland, even with adding onion salt, garlic salt, and Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef. The roomie and I agreed, baking them in patties was a horrible idea. Next time I'll try browning the meat in a skillet first and crumbling it into the dish. I'll also experiment with some spices, because this just lacked flavour all over. We couldn't even bring ourselves to finish the leftovers.

Awesome recipe!  My kids do not eat vegetables and I can honestly say that they cleaned this meal out.  For adult plates we added a pinch of cyan pepper which was perfect and seasoned the patties.

literally the blandest thing I have EVER put in my mouth.  On the upside, it was edible but the amount of sauce or salt required to consume this defeated any health value.  Sadly, it was inconsumable.

Easy comfort food! We always make these camping (with corn added too).  They are bland without condiments.  Ketchup, mustard or bbq are all good on it.

Tweek this with some garlic and no sodium butter also some miss dash and leave out the garlic salt and salt because that defeats the whole low sodium purpose. Garlic Garlic from tastefully simple has no sodium and is an improvement

I haven't tried this recipe yet. I am planning on it tonight. This recipe sounds a lot like my mom's except she didn't make the meat into patties. My mom just browned the beef and mixed it with the veggies. It was always a big hit with very little left for leftovers the next day since there were 7 of us all together.

I only cooked it for 45 miutes, and the carrots and potatos were stuck to the foil, I'm not sure if the beef wasn't fatty enough to provide proper greasing to the foil, but it was disappointing. Tasted good, after I put a bunch of A1 and ketchup on it. Otherwise sort of bland.

Maybe put some steak sauce on the side to dip?  Still good.

I made this for our dinner last night and we really enjoyed it. I sprinkled some soy sauce on the patties, dotted a little butter on top, and omitted the garlic salt. I used plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. The onions caramelized over the other ingredients and added lots of flavor. I will be making this again. Easy to make. Easy to clean up.

My kids and I loved this recipe. My husband came home late and was disappointed that there wasn't much left.  We've since made it again.

Two additions I made: 

I seasoned the beef liberally (like burgers) with salt, garlic, pepper.  And I seasoned the entire dish the same.  

And some of us ate it with ketchup. Yum, yum!

Easliy adaptable with your own favorite seasonings.  I used 80% lean ground beef and the patties cooked down a whole lot more than I'd anticipated.

I love this recipe! It is now one of my regular meals. Such a great and different way to use up ground beef. I do it a little differently, add my own touch. I season the beef first with a steak seasoning and layer sliced potatoes, baby carrots, onions and celery on top of the beef.

Sometimes putting a teaspoon or two of water helps(just be careful when you wrap the tinfoil up).  My dad taught me how to make this when I was a little girl.  You can throw the packets directly on a campfire, although it is a lot quicker with a grill.

5 stars for the inspiration below.

My Nephew asked for “Hobo stew” for a camping trip where I was cooking on a campfire for 30 and I didn’t have a clue what he wanted. I only had a tri-pod and needed to go with individual foil packets, for speed and cleanliness. I wanted these to cook faster, so I did prep work at home. I pattied the hamburgers and threw them on my gas grill and par boiled the veggies. I threw a grilled hamburger, the veggies, salt, pepper and a few tablespoons of cream of mushroom soup in a single serving foil packet. I switched to the cream soup instead of the onion soup to make up for the juices lost from grilling. It only took about 10 minutes or so on a very hot campfire with the tri-pod dropped to just a few inches off the flame, turning once. Very simple, but it was the hit supper of the week! Thank you for the idea!

I like to add more flavor, like in Paula Deen's Hobo Burgers. She adds egg, cracker, cheese, green pepper, salt, black pepper to the patties.  Layers with the onion, potato, carrott, and bacon.  Each serving is individually wrapped. 
My family loves it!

After adding some ingredients as others suggested I found this was pretty tasty.  However I don't think aluminum foil is the best choice to contain a family sized meal (though probably okay if you do individual portions).  The juices leaked out and I found myself scrambling to add foil so it didn't dry out.  In the future, I use one of those easy to seal oven bags.

This recipe is a good basic recipe.  Very easy to spice up to your own personal tastes.  Took the advice from other reviews and added an envelope of onion soup mix to the ground beef.  Also a little seasoned salt to the potatoes and carrots.  Hubby and toddlers loved it!

I followed the advice of some others reviewers and seasoned my ground beef.  I also added green peppers and celery.  
The flavors were really good and it was super easy to make, but it really needed some gravy or sauce of some sort.  I ended up making a quick brown gravy to go over it and it made a big difference.

This is a great recipe, especially for single folks.  I just got a pack of hamburger patties, and cook one at a time for a quick and easy dinner.  Also, a little pat of butter really make this meal melt in your mouth.

This meal was excellent. I used lean ground beef and followed recommendation to add 1 pkg. of onion soup mix pdr. I made it in layers and sprinkled a little seasoning salt between layers. Next time I will increase the amount of onion. I let it bake for 1 3/4 hours.

This is a recipe that I have used for years. I just recently modified it by frying chopped bacon and onions until they are almost done through, then putting them, as well as the grease, over the top of everything before baking. I don't recommend this step if you are on a diet!

Oh my goodness. I didn't need to add this to my recipe box. I just wanted to give my opinion on these great little dinners. I've been making these since my daughter was in scouts and she's now 26 yrs. old. They work on the campfire, on the grill and in the oven. I used to peel all the ingredients and let the kids add what they wanted to their packets. I just love these things. And the clean up is a breeze!

I found this recipe easy to put together. It has all your elements, so no side dish is required. I love recipes of this type. It does take a little more time in preparation, but it is well worth it. This recipe is a little bland for my tastes, so in the next couple of months, I will be experimenting with different sauces to add to the hamburger patties themselves. When I find one I am convinced everyone will find appetizing, I will do another review to let you know what I came up with. I just love this site.

A very average meal. Plain - not enough seasoning with just the salt and pepper.

By itself, this was rather bland.  I ended up making it again because we went camping and I thought mountain air would make it taste better.  We made the following changes: I mixed a can of mushroom soup with a packet of onion soup mix and put a dollop on top of the beef patties. Then I wrapped the individual servings in heavy-duty foil and cooked them in the campfire coals. We liked it so much that time, I tried it at home and we liked it there, too, at sea level!  I'd give it 3 stars as is, but 4 with the changes. Maybe even five, if you've been out hiking all day!

I love to make these on camping trips.  It didn't occur to me that I could make them without a campfire!  For this recipe I added a packet of ranch and tortilla chips to the burger.  I also threw in some celery, since that's the way my mom always made it.  Turned out great, just spread ketcup over it all and it's delicious!

My kids, 6, 5, and 2, really loved these!!  They liked the whole idea that it was in foil!  I put individual servings in seperate foil packs and it made for a super easy picnic table dinner.  I will say that I did add more seasonings based on the reviews!  I added a package of onion soup mix to the lean ground beef and it was great.

I have made this dish numerous times, and it's always a family pleaser.  As per other reviews, this is a great recipe to "customize" for your own family's preferences.  This is now a regular in our house!

This is really similar to a recipe that my family makes every time we camp, only we wrap them in foil and cook it in the coals of the fire.  We've always added canned peas, tomato soup and a sprinkle of garlic powder...YUM

This was good.  I used red potatoes, quartered them and left the skins on; and added mushrooms.  I also used ranch dressing mix, and I recommend seasoning the recipe with more than just salt and pepper...otherwise it is a little bland.  A few minor changes and this is a great recipe.

I loved this ... easy to prepare and just left it in the oven to cook with no need to check.  Next time I'll season it more often but besides that it was great.

I have made this recipe several times and never had any complaints. However I top it off with margarine before adding the salt and pepper.And also I sometimes use the red potatoes and leave the peelings on.

This was a very easy meal to prepare and the family loved the flavor. I used my own seasonings.
