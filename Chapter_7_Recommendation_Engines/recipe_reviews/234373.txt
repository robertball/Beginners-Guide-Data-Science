This was tasty. I would definitely make it again. I was unable to find fresh figs this time of year; especially where we were this wknd- up in the mountains, so I used fresh apricots and it turned out lovely! good recipe.

It was ok. It was not amazing but it wasn't bad either.

I made this one minus the plantains and it came out really well. I would definitely make this one again. The balsamic vinegar gives it a different taste!

This recipe is delicious! I didn't have any plantain so I skipped that. I also sprinkled the garlic over the chicken. It turned out great, a wonderful blend of sweet and savory.
