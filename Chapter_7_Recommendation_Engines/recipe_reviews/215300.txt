I didn't like the flavor of this by itself but once I added bbq sauce it was very good. The pork comes out nice and juicy.

Just made this as part of our Christmas dinner. This was not the first time that I've mad an Okinawan pork dish. This time, I omitted the tomato sauce and used mirin instead. It was a hit.

We were not impressed with this.  The meat didn't take on the flavor of the sauce, more like all the flavor of the meat cooked out into the sauce.  There was way too much cooking liquid and it was very thin / watery.  The meat itself just tasted like over cooked pork.

Wonderful recipe for the slow cooker and something different with pork. I made it just like the recipe however I marinated it in the liquid ingredients overnight. I then took a portion of the of the liquid when it was done and made a thickened sauce with cornstarch. Great sauce to go on top of a serving or on the side.

Used white wine since I didn’t have any sake. I was just looking for a way to cook pork butt other than making barbecue; I wasn’t expecting much, but this was great!  I absolutely will make again!

I'm making this again today! (It'll be my second time making it.) It is really easy to make and has a nice flavor! The whole family enjoyed it last time! My picky eater even liked it! I'm going to serve it with rice and green salad.

I didn't cook in slow cooker. In the oven for 40 mins per pound. My guess loved it. I will make it with chicken thighs also.

Too much sauce & tastes too much like soy sauce. Pork didn't seem to take on any flavor. However, I've never made a pork roast before, so the bright side is this recipe gave me a simple place to start from though.
