I was amazed that this recipe did not call for any seasonings, not even salt!  The recipe itself is very bland, so I added italian seasoning and garlic salt.  I would have also preferred a greater variety of vegetables. I added some spinach.  After a few modifications, my family gobbled it up.

This recipe alone does not make minestrone soup in my opinion. It had no flavor and did not resemble any minestrone I have ever tasted. However, with this recipe and some ideas I got by looking at other minestrone recipes it turned out to be pretty tasty.

It is a healthy soup unfortunately without taste.  Easy but not tasty. I added beef broth base to improve the taste.

Did not like this recipe at all, no flavor. Even after adding lots of salt and pepper.

I went into this recipe knowing that many other reviewers pointed to it being flavorless.  I started by sauteing the onions, celery and carrots in a dab of oil before continuing, to enhance their flavors.  Then I added the garlic.  Then the water, tomato paste and beans.  When the veggies had softened up, I gave the soup a taste.  It tasted like a watered down tomato, not even the veggies added flavor. So I added a few spoonfuls of organic chicken base, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.  I like a chunky soup and had never heard of anyone pureeing minestrone, so I skipped the blending step.  Then I added the pasta, some more water because I could tell the pasta would soak most of the broth up, and also a handful of frozen spinach.  My end result was a good soup.  I served it with shredded Parmesan cheese and biscuits.
