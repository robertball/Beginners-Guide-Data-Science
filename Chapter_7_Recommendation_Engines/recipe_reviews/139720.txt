Wow!   I had a baby shower with way too many appetizers - the only one that was gone was this mango salsa.  Costco has some delicious pre cut mango that made this super easy and delicious.   Definitely let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour before to get the full flavor.

Great as a reference or starting point, but as is the case with many recipes I adjusted the recipe to suit my own tastes.  I eliminated the sugar - for me it was totally unnecessary and may have even been counterproductive. In keeping with the tropical flair of the recipe I substituted fresh lime juice for the vinegar (loved that!) and added some chopped fresh cilantro.  For my tastes, four stars as written and an unequivocal five stars with my modifications.  Served this alongside crab cakes and there couldn't have been a more ideal accompaniment.

Wow - beautiful, healthy, tasty!  Modifications -- - Substitute juice of 1 lime for vinegar; - Start with 1/2 tsp salt and go up -- 1 tsp salt is too much for almost any recipe - Would probably be fine w/2 tsp olive oil - 1 Tbs was a little too much.

Great salsa or side dish!  I used 1/2 cup of purple onion, and added 2 chopped green onions, along with 2 tblsp of chopped cilantro.  Also substitued the vinegar with fresh lime juice- terrific over fish!

I love this recipe!  I add corn and black beans and serve it with Jerk shrimp and scallops in soft torilla.  It's always a hit and tastes so fresh.

This is so good!  My kids and I devoured the whole thing in about 10 minutes.  I didn't have a red onion, so I substituted chopped green onion, plus I only used half a large red pepper, and I added chopped cilantro.  Crumbled Cojita cheese (a Spanish cheese) would also taste great in this salsa.  I think I will be making this again very soon.  Thanks!

I have to rate this as written and it had WAY too much oil in it.  The flavors were good, but the oil made it almost slimmy.  Also this is too much sugar.  Cut the sugar in half (or less) and omit the oil altogether and I think it will be really good. Also change the vinegar to lime juice if you have it and add some fresh cilantro.  A good idea here, but needs real tweaking.

This is delicious!  I served it on top of broiled tilapia that I seasoned with lemon pepper. I had brown rice as a side, so I mixed the rest of the rice and salsa together for a tasty lunch :)

Great recipe, thanks!  I added two chipotle peppers with adobo sauce (from a can) and we enjoyed the added heat.  I have also tried it using sambal oelek as a different"heat" source, and that was great, too.

2011-01-24  I used green onion instead of red & white balsamic instead of white wine vinegar plus omitted the salt.  I wasn't keen on the texture of the avocado & thought it could use some cilantro.  The overall flavor was good though.

My family loves this recipe and we make it frequently.  Aside from the amazing flavor, what we love the most about this is how versatile this recipe is.  We've done this with green and yellow onions, green bell peppers, we've added Serrano peppers for more heat.  In short, you can't really mess this one up - it's going to be good!

Made the recipe exactly to the recipe.  I assembled everything in the morning except the avocado and added that right before stirring.  There was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the bowl but that may have been due to the ingredients being prepared early and sitting in the refrigerator.  I should have made a double batch, everyone ate it all up and then asked for the recipe.

This was a pretty good starting point, but I did make some changes.  Omitted the sugar, replaced the vinegar with lime juice, I used sweet Vidalia onion and I added 1 small, lightly roasted jalapeno for a little heat.  I made it well ahead of time so the flavors could meld and added the diced avocado right before serving.  Thanks, Julie - this is a keeper.

Used 1/4 of a small onion, omitted salt, and used lime juice instead of vinegar. I also added a whole jalapeno for a little heat. This was great. I mixed everything together other than the avocado and let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours. Right before I was going to serve I added the avocado. This recipe was a hit at the party. TFS

This has a nice blend of flavors, but agree with other reviewers that it needs some cilantro.  I also served it over fish tacos and think it would be a nice compliment to grilled salmon as well or with chips.

My hubby and I thought it was delicious!  Since I didn't have a red onion I only put a little of chopped onion.  Used lime instead of vinegar since I had plenty!  I also used stevia powder and only 1 tsp. of sugar.  This was delicious!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  Tasted like a mango-y margarita almost.  A little salty, but once it soaked it up a little, it was amazing!

This is SO good!  And easy to make.  I used less red pepper but kept everything else the same and let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour.  I seasoned a pork tenderloin with some Caribbean Jerk Seasoning, grilled it, and served it with this salsa.  Yummy!

This was easy to make and so pretty!  I followed the recipe exactly.  We took it to a picnic birthday party and it was a hit!  No one touched the regular salsa and this one was gone.  Thanks for posting!

very different taaste, an excellent tropical taste!  I loved it, as did my mango avoiding family.  I'd put a little less vinegar in next time, as the after taste is a strong vinegar-esque flavor.

Great Avocado-Mango Salsa recipe!  I've made it before (different ingredients) and this one turned out really well.  Only change I made was I used distilled white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.

I was a bit apprehensive about making this.  I love both avocado and mango bit never would have previously considered eating then together.  So..chicken me cut a piece from each and WOW!  I love the flavor and texture combination.  I followed your recipe with two exception I used stevia (a natural sweetener) in place of the sugar and I used no oil.  I am certain it would taste great.  I felt there was enough natural fats from the avocado to be yummy enough.  I also added a de-seeded Roma tomato because I had it on hand.  This is an amazing salsa.   I agree once you taste it..."you won't be able to stop eating it"...

This salsa is fabulous. I made it almost exactly as the recipe called for (used 1/2 less red bell pepper as we're not huge pepper fans) and loved it. Used it on a mahi burger as well as a second time over pork chops. The second time I used orange bell pepper and it was equally as good. Will make this easy salsa over and over again!

This is amazing.  I used white onion, green pepper, and a splash of balsamic vinegar.   We put it over black bean cakes.  It is delicious.  I can't wait to share it at cookouts this summer.

Oh my goodness. This was just SO good! I served it over a coconut-crusted tilapia filet,and it was heavenly. I didn't have red onion, so I just used a Vidalia onion; only used 1/2 of the red pepper because I don't love them. Otherwise, followed the recipe and LOVED it.

Super delicious and simple! I used a champagne mango (small, bright yellow, also called ataulfo, I think) and a Haas avocado. I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used some Japanese rice vinegar instead. This salsa was a perfect blend of flavors and textures (sweet, tart, crunchy, and soft) and oh, so beautiful in presentation. I will definitely be keeping this one to use again. Keep in mind that it's ready to go once mixed together, but that with time, the liquid is drawn from the mango, peppers, and onion, making it a little mushy - still delicious, but loses a few presentation points.

I have been a long time lurker here on allrecipes but I had to write a review for this! I read a lot of reviews and followed their advice to put in half of the oil and half of the vinegar plus a second mango and avocado just because we love them both so much and it was FANTASTIC! Served with chicken, jasmine rice and steamed veggies. What a perfect meal.

I picked this over the other recipes.  I used 2 mangos and 1T vinegar and 1 T lime, and reduced the salt.  I am including this in our community newsletter. Yes, can't stop eating it.

Excellent flavor for a "not hot" salsa.  Will consider adding a jalapeno next time for a little heat.  Beautiful appearance.  Served it with Hawaiin Chicken.  Garnished with flower petals.  Wonderful presantation.

Everyone loved as a condiment on our fish or chicken soft tacos.  The consistency of the avocado and mango are important.  Not too ripe, not to underripe :)  I did not use red pepper because I did not have one.  I used splenda instead of sugar.

Made this salsa 3 times in past month.  Many requests for this recipe. It was a hit! (decreased the onion to 1/2 cup).  Great for summer as a side dish for BBQ.

This was so good!  I made it exactly as written and then at the last minute added some cilantro just because I happen to have it...I couldn't stop eating it.  Next time I think I'll add a jalapeno.  Yum!  Thank you!  I will make this again and again.  I can only guess how great it would be with a grilled tuna steak....

This was so good! I've heard of different salsas besides the regular kind with tomatoes, but never tried them, thinking they sounded a little weird. Boy, was I wrong!! I didn't have an avocado, but I had some guacamole so I added that instead. I tried it on crabcakes and it was great! I put some on  grilled chicken the next day too! I will be making this alot from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

SOO Yummy!  I went with the suggestion to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp and go up from there...I also used the juice of one lime instead of the vinegar. Delicious!

This recipe is delicious. I added a little bit of diced jalapeno, some cilantro, and also substituted the vinegar for lime juice. I used the salsa to top on some salmon that I baked in the oven- delicious and healthy!

Had a hankerin' for shrimp tacos and thought this would go well. Substituted fresh pineapple for mango. Cut back on the sugar. Yummy, yummy. Hubby said this w/the shrimp tasted like something at a restaurant.

So since this is my fourth time going back to this recipe in just one month, I figured I should probably rate it. My family can't get enough of this salsa, and since I'm a health-nut I absolutely love that this salsa is a fresh, nutrient-packed accompaniment to almost anything.  My favorite way to eat it so far is to serve it over grilled tuna steaks.  Pair with the "fat free refried bean' recipe on this site and you have an amazing meal!

This was fantastic. I added half a diced jalepeno pepper, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and left out the salt. It was the hit at our little dinner gathering. Suggested it for my friend to take to her family reunion. It was all the rave.

I used a shallot instead of the onion.  Really good with plain grilled swordfish, chicken, or pork chops.  My two year-old ate the salsa and left the meat.

WOW! This was Yummy! I do not like hot or spicy dishes and this was sweet and wonderful... but not too sweet. I added the juice of a lime, less onion, and chopped up some grape tomatoes I had on hand. I'll be serving it as a side to my grilled chicken tonight, if it lasts that long! Enjoy...

Great recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and I was pleasantly pleased. The only change I made was I wanted the salsa cool in the refrigerator so I added some lime juice and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

We really liked this salsa.  I served it with tilapia & it was a great compliment for the fish.  I left out the oil thinking the avocado had enough natural oil & we were very happy with it this way.

Loved it after I added more mango to dilute out the power of the onions. I used no sugar at all- had to add some frozen mango that was thawed and diced to the small mango I had on hand. As suggested by another reviewer, I used lime juice instead of vinegar and some cilantro for more flavor. I would cut the onions down to 1/4  cup of an onion or maybe just a bit more- 3/4 cup of a red onion did not let the flavor of the mango and peppers come thru.

I have never made salsa before and was looking for a tasty mango salsa to compliment a quick late evening cod fish dinner. As I'm trying to do less sugar these days, I knew I would eliminate that. I also used "Naples.." suggestion and use real lime juice instead of vinegar, added cilantro (one of my favorite herbs) and I also decided to reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp--it was spot on delicious and upon taste test made me do dance! Great recipe! My family loved it! I will try this w/ my salmon cakes and other dishes too.

Really yummy but next time will make sure to chop up the mango, avo, and onion in much smaller pieces. I was out of white wine vinegar so used 1 TBSP of apple cider vinegar and 1 TBSP of rice vinegar. yumm

I have made this a few times and absolutely love it! it is ALWAYS a hit, either as a dip, or for tacos. The only thing I do different is leave out the avocados, so the salsa stays fresh longer, in the fridge.

I make this to go with my Maryland Crabcakes, also from this site; it's also great paired with fish or chicken, or with chips.  And it's easy too!

I'm a carnivore but this was so lovely, I ate it alone! I will be sharing it at the next BBQ. I added an extra mango and cilantro. I also used like too. Next time I want to add jalapeño.

I added extra avocado and mango but kept the rest of the ingredients approximately the same. We had it over mahi mahi and it was delish.

3 stars as written...after tasting it, I added a finely diced jalapeno, a couple of squeezes of fresh lime juice (instead of vinegar), and a handful of chopped FRESH cilantro and it became 5+ stars. It's even better after a few hours in the frig. You can actually omit the oil completely if you wish. This is a favorite in south Texas and so delicious as a dip, a fish/chicken/pork/steak topper or just by the spoonful!

Just made and devoured two servings of this delicious salsa... May not be any left by the time the family gets home. So will probably have to make another batch before then.  I made the following additions to the recipe: doubled the ingredients except for onions (kept that the same); added teaspoon of chopped pickled jalapeños and a couple of tablespoons of fresh cilantro. Quick, easy and refreshingly delicious. Thank you Julie!!

I made this for a get together.  Everyone loved it!  I am making again to put on fish.  I deleted red bell pepper and only used about half the oil, and subbed white onion for red (I didn't have red).  I added half a diced tomato and the juice from a lime.

Well as did the others I added lime juice and cilantro, I didn't use the bell pepper cause I don't like it. We made po'boys with fish shrimp & oyster and topped it with salsa OH MY YUMMY!!!! Great quick & easy recipe.

I followed the other reviewers that used lime juice instead of the vinegar and omitted the sugar. My whole family loved it! I had it on pan seared tuna, my kids rolled ham and turkey lunch meat around it and and we used it on tortilla chips! Yum!!!

I liked this recipe but it could've used a little heat so next time I'll try adding jalapenos. Otherwise this was a terrific recipe with a lot of flavor.

AWESOME!!! So deliciously refreshing...served it over baked cod after spooning some into my mouth it was so tasty ;) I also added a chopped poblano pepper for some extra color and a dash of crushed red pepper for a little extra kick.  I will definitely make again, but will prob cut back a little on the sugar since the mango is so naturally sweet to begin with & use less vinegar only b/c I'm not a fan of all the fluid that tends to sit at the bottom.  Otherwise - I definitely recommend this salsa recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!

To make more, I added another mango, 1 large fresh tomato and 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilis, and another can of diced tomatoes (Fennel and Red Pepper), 4 garlic cloves, cup of cilantro, a little more sugar, and another onion, the juice of 1 lime. I let it sit overnight and serve it over baked salmon, or even store bought rotisserie chicken with tortilla chips and rice! Yummo. 
Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!! I make this as offten as I can and use it to top off some dinners. I love this recipe! I normally don't add the sugar though (I think the mango make it sweet enough), other than that it's pretty much perfect. Every now and then, I spice it up and add a bit of lime juice.

Wonderful surprise. Delicious blend of sweet with a bit of a tang.  I made this for a dinner with the neighbors and I ended up handing them the recipe because they couldn't stop eating it.  I have made this many times and one time, my avocado was bad so I ended up swapping avocado for a nice tomato and it was delicious too!  I also always use green bell pepper because I always have it on hand (tends to be cheaper).  Also, be wary of your sugar.  One time I had an extra sweet mango so I had to use less sugar otherwise it'd be way too sweet.  I would give this more stars if I could.  Definitely want to put out either the scoops chips or the giant tortilla chips becuase you don't want to miss a bite out of this!

This is my new favorite salsa!  So light and refreshing, and so pretty to look at! I think it's best when refrigerated for at least an hour before serving / eating. My best friend's 2 y.o - who is very picky - just LOVES it.  I've made it so many times already this summer that I've lost count and my friends keep asking for more!

AH-mazing. One bite is not enough. I used white distilled vinegar because I did not have white wine vinegar on hand. I also used half a red bell pepper and half a orange one for more color. It would probably be good with a serrano chili or the like in it, but it was still wonderful without it. You can make this one just as its written and its great!

This salsa is so good!  I made it to go with a spicy shrimp recipe I got from this site and also grilled chicken.  I added cilantro and reduced the salt as other reviewers suggested.  It was fabulous!  I had some leftover so we will see how good it is tomorrow!

Oh wow!  Seriously good stuff!  I used a shallot instead of red onion since it's what I had on hand, I had one big mango and two small avocados.  I cut everything in big chunks and then used a hand crank "salsa maker" to chop it up and mix it.  Very pretty, too!

This is SO GOOD!! My family loves it and two dinner parties have started well with it!  It takes more than 30 minutes preparation though!

I needed a quick recipe for a potluck with my friends this weekend. I wanted to use a mango and avocado that I had and this recipe was perfect. It was easy to make and everyone at the party said it tasted good. I personally think it was missing something but I couldn't figure out what. Next time I have a random avocado and mango in my house, I will have to make it again and experiment with more ingredients

Wow, this recipe was sensational!  Not only is it colorful, but it is the best salsa I've ever had!  I hosted Christmas for my in-laws this year and everyone raved about it.  This is a quick, no-fail recipe that I would highly recommend.

Very refreshing! I served it with blue corn tortillas as an appitizer but will try it again for additions to meat or something else.  Good reviews from my guests who really appreciate ( and cook) great food.
