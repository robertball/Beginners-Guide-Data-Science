My husband ate the entire thing!! Personally, I enjoyed it better on day 2 after it had more time to thicken up in the fridge.

I did make a few additions, 4 oz more cream cheese, 1/2 cup extra white chocolate chips, and added 1/2 box of instant white chocolate pudding mix. Replaced the Almond Extract for Vanilla, and made my own chocolate graham cracker crust. Great recipe though, I just love to experiment, and it turned out wonderful. Great taste. I am keeping this one for all my cheesecake recipes like raspberry, blueberry etc. Thanks

This is one of our favorites I've made it multiple times.  Every year for my friends birthday she requests this pie!

Very easy recipe that my 13 year old daughter made.  I added another 4 oz of cream cheese like others suggested.  We cut the pie before topping with homemade cherry pie filling and white chocolate chips.  Everyone loved it at the church dinner.

We weren't crazy about this pie. It was way too sweet without great flavor in the filling. Cherry pie filling stands alone. The amount of almond extract specified was way overpowering. Don't think we will be having this again.
