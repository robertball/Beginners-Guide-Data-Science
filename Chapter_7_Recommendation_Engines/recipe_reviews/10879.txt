I'm Italian and we use Powder Sugar in place of granulated in the filling, no citron, small choc.
chips only & I do not like any flavoring. Granulated sugar will probably make this very watery. Do not mix items together until you are ready to fill the shells.

The shells were perfect. However, I found using powder sugar was better than regular. I didn't use the Citron as I'm not a fan of it. Next batch, I'll eliminate the chocolate as well and use fruit like is in fruit cake instead, this was the way my Grandmother used to make it.

I made a full batch of the shells and resized the recipe down to a few servings for the filling. I'm told shells will stay good for up to 2 mths while filling is only good for 48 hours.

Make sure you thin out the dough.  Also you can use lemon peel instead of the candied citron. This is the tastiest ever!

Ricotta must be dry, I drain in a sieve with weight on top over night, I also used powdered sugar as I think it blends better.
The dough recipe actually made over 30 shells, I rolled them as thin as I could as they swell up and blister, only take 2-3 mins not 8. I used mixed peel/candied peel not citron but the taste was overpowering so you could not taste the chocolate or the original cannoli taste I first had as a teen, (just the ricotta and sugar and nothing else) I have just made another batch without the fruit or choc, next time I may use 1/2 cup choc and 1/4 cup peel as I think this may balance out the flavours better. I actually have this exact recipe on the back of an old box of cannoli forms made by hoan, I think the 8 mins deef frying was prob an eror and should read 3 as 8 mins would turn them black.

I used the shell recipe many years ago. It has a better taste and consistency  to it then the ones made with wine.  Being Italian I did not follow the filling recipe because we use powdered sugar instead of regular white sugar. 
But over all everything came out perfect!

I bought the shells at the local Italian bakery. The filling was runny, I should have drained the cheese. A little corn starch thickened it right up. The flavor was great. I lucked out and found the citron at the Italian deli.

I am rating the cannoli shells, as I made my own filling. I found the dough to be too dry, so I added an additional 2 tbsp. of water. The dough itself is pretty tough so you have to knead for at least 5 minutes before you get it to the right consistency. Also, make sure you roll them out as thin as you can, which is difficult because of the dough consistency. They should be nice and thin with a little bubbling. The cooking time for me was about 5 minutes, as I only submerged them half way in oil. The recipe itself is good. Nice flavoring, but I'm still on the lookout for the perfect shell recipe!

My shells were a disaster - but the filling was amazing! I used mini chips, and powdered sugar as someone had suggested - very yummy!

I'm sorry to say, but this recipe did not turn out well at all.  I followed everything to a T, but the cannoli shells were thick and tough.  The filling was way to sweet, and chocolate chips were too big.  I think if I make this filling again, I will use the powdered sugar and perhaps mini chocolate chips.  I will resort to purchasing the cannoli shells the next time.  They are crisp and light.  Sorry. . . :(

This was my first time making cannoli's and I thought that they were very good, just like i remembered having them as a child.  I drained the cheese in a cheese cloth by separating the cheese into thirds and wrapping a piece of cheese cloth around it to form a ball and began squeezing the bottom and from the top alternately untill it was fairly dry, but, I wanted some moisture remaining.  I also added more mini chocolate chips than called for, and some chopped pecans.  I plan on making more!

Great recipe over all - I substituted a few things to make the filling thicker and added a dash more vanilla.  The dough was fantastic for the shells, a pleasant taste, but by the next day, the shells were turning soft.  Must be eaten within a few hours.

The shell recipe is excellent, though I found I had to add a bit of extra water to make them roll out.  I rolled them using the finest (#1) setting on my pasta machine and I got way more cannoli shells than the recipe indicated, about 40 shells.

The shells for the cannoli's was delicious! It fried up perfectly, and was such a delicious cookie. I noticed after the first few batches that I fried up, the oil started to get very bubbly, and come up out of the pan. The oil should probably be replaced at least 1 time throughout the cannoli-frying process. Also, based on other reviewers suggestions, I used powdered sugar instead of granulated. I used more than suggested though-- I like things on the sweeter side. Thanks for the great recipe!

Just a few notes on this recipe. Only fry your shells for a few minutes until golden. Also, use only whole milk ricotta cheese, and only use powdered sugar. The shells last several days and can be made ahead. The filling must be made the day you are serving. The shells make way more than the recipe calls for but the filling seemed to make less. I served 40 people and everyone just raved about them.

I made my own filling, so this review is just for the shells. I had a really hard time finding recipes online for cannoli shells. Most of the recipes for cannoli's that I found simply said to go to the store and buy the shells already premade, so it was nice to find an easy to work with recipe for cannoli shells. I followed the recipe to the T and have decided to make a few modifications for the next time I make these. The dough is very dense and hard to work with. It's very hard to roll out and you really do need to make sure the dough is quite thin before fry it. I may try using my pasta maker to roll out the dough for me next time and see how that works.   Also, I could really taste the vinegar in the shells after they were cooked. I don't know if the vinegar is added for consistency of the dough or for taste, but I think I will try taking that out next time I make these and try using sherri or wine in substitute.   I did really like the consistancy of the shells. They were dense, sweet, and crubly when you bit into them, which is just how they should be.  Overall, I do think this is a good base and starter point the the shells.

I used the proportions in this filling recipe with powdered sugar instead of granulated, strained ricotta and citron. It's still not as thick as grandma's was. Any ideas? I wonder if I whipped in some butter and chilled the cookies...
