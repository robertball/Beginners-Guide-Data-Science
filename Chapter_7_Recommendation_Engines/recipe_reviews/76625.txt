Excellent base recipe. I made a few modifications and this came out superb! First off, instead of steaming the broccoli in a steamer, I added it to a saute pan with a little bit of water (maybe a 1/2 cup) a tablespoon of butter and some minced garlic. When I sauteed the mushrooms, I added a little bit of fresh spinach (about 2 cups/handfuls). I also added a few pinches of Marjoram, Basil, Thyme, and parsley paste (in substitute for fresh parsley). Instead of putting the dry mustard in the dough, I added it to the cream mixture since I bought a pre-made crust. When it came time to add the egg, I added one extra to equal four. Turned out fantastic! One of the best recipes I've used from this site in a while! Enjoy

I've made this a few times and it's a family favorite.  It tastes sooo good.  I modified the recipe only slightly.  For the crust I used 1/4 tsp. salt instead of 1/2 tsp.  I thought it was too salty.  Also for the filling, I substituted light cream for the half-and-half, and added a dash of pepper.

I have been making this exact recipe for years. I only looked it up because I had lost it. You can change this up in lots of ways by adding different spices and cheeses, vegetables and meats like ham, proscuitto or prepared bacon. As another reviewer said, it needs a bit more salt when made without any of the meats I listed above. Overall, this is a family favorite. I recommend that you increase the ingredients for the crust by about 20% or so to make sure you have enough to fully cover the sides and the bottom of your pie plate.

This was a yummy way to use the broccoli from my garden and the eggs from my sister's chickens!  I do agree, however, that the crust seemed salty -- I will reduce it by half the next time I make it.  But overall, it was really good and different from just a plain old quiche.

Absolutely delicious and for the underweight of us, provides a nice, fattening vegetable serving or two!  About 400 calories per 1/2 pie the way I calculated it.    I added a bit more butter to the softened mushrooms and onion before adding the flour, half and half, etc.  I also cut the salt a bit in both parts of the recipe and added only a dash of nutmeg and mustard.  I substituted cheddar jack for the cheddar, which was great.  I found that flouring the hands when pressing the cheese mixture into the pie pan worked very well.  Thanks again for this great recipe.  I can't wait to share it!

This was good and my husband liked it.  I didn't have chedder, substituted colby-jack instead.  The crust didn't taste real cheesy but very rich.  I cooked the onions in the microwave to reduce dirty dishes.  I did not add mushrooms -my husband dislikes- but added the last of some turkey bacon.  I also added 2% milk instead of cream which was fine.  Could have used a touch more salt or seasoning in the eggs.  I will make this again, though.

I lessened the salt in both areas by just a bit and thought it was perfect. I used maybe 1/4 onion but added more broccoli. I agree with another reviewer about adding 20% more to the crust ingredients. My crust ended up really thin, which wasn't bad, just would have preferred slightly thicker. I loved the nutmeg in this recipe. I accidentally put in over 1/4 teaspoon, and I don't recommend doing that as the nutmeg was more obvious than it should've been. I also only put in 3/4 cup of half & half as that is all I had, but the moisture content was not affected. This is a very simple recipe that allows you time to do the crust while the mushrooms & onions are sauteing. I highly recommend this and will most definitely make this again.

This was DELISH!! I followed the recipe exactly except I made the crust with crumbled Ritz crackers and butter & I used sharp cheese instead of cheddar. I'll definitely make this again! :)

I made this exact recipe tonight from your new All Recipes magazine. My husband and I were very disappointed as it was rather dry and tasteless. Even the finished recipe did NOT look like the photo in the magazine! Won't make it again.

Followed the recipe with the minor changes from the AR Magazine. First of all, the photo of the dish was very different. The finished product was an unpleasing grayish color. No way to get it to look like that without doing the following extra steps: after finishing as per recipe cover with layer of cheese, layer of broccoli, layer of mushrooms, and layer of onions. 
Now for the taste.... I was disappointed. It wasn't bad, but wasn't very good. Just kind of bland. Basically, not something you would want to eat, but if made your not going to go hungry.
Will not make again.

This was delicious, easy, and a great recipe to adapt to whatever is in the fridge. You got my son and my boyfriend to eat some veggies, good job. Also, after waiting 10 mins. for it to cool it served up perfectly, didn't crumble apart on the plate at all. I'll use this crust often for other veggie pies!

This was great. I made it two weeks ago and my husband is asking for it again. The cheese in the crust is just great!! We used an extra sharp cheddar from England. I served this with barbecue pork steaks, a St. Louis tradition, and a salad. I also enjoyed it for lunch for a couple of days at work with carrot chips and ranch dressing. thanks again, great recipe!

Well, I love the base of this recipe with the broccoli and cheddar cheese but I added my remaining ingredients.  I omitted the mushrooms:) I included, with the broccoli, 8 Sliced cherry tomatoes, 8 pieces of bacon, 1/2 caramelized yellow onion and 1 c of Parmesan cheese.

I didn't care for it.  The cheese crust made it seem very heavy and fattening. Part of my love of quiche is the dough crust, so I probably won't make this again. Also it seemed like too much flour in both the cheese crust instructions and the filling instructions, but the recipe might have been skewed when I had AR cut the servings from 8 to 4.

Love the crust! So I hate to be someone who reviews and changes the recipe...but I had no mushrooms.  Swapped out mushrooms for canned artichoke hearts- my only substitution. I had to cook a little longer, but I think this was delicious.  A rich treat no doubt.  My family though would rather eat Taco Bell, so I can't go by their reactions.  I really enjoyed and next time I'll share with other that will appreciate it.

The filling is delicious but it's really the cheddar cheese crust that makes this recipe something special.  I'm always on the search for really enjoyable meatless dishes and will be making this one often.

This was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure how it would turn out. The only difference I made was to use Swiss cheese instead of cheddar, only because that's what was here. I will try it with cheddar as well, and I'm sure it will be good then too. The crust is different and delicious, and I think I might increase the crust ingredients next time. Thanks!

Very flavorful and it set up perfectly. The crust was a little salty, so I would cut that by half. I'm glad I cut the salt for the filling by half or I think it would have been too salty, too. The color was grayish, like a couple of other reviewers said. But that could be because I used evaporated milk instead of half and half.

My only quibble would be with the stated prep time: it took at least a half hour with all the steps involved. 

I did cut the baking time to a total of 30 minutes.

I loved this recipe, it was actually better the second day at room temperature.  I used frozen broccoli that I nuked to thaw and then allowed it to drain in a colander to drain while I prepared the crust.

I also added shredded sharp cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking to add an extra cheesy kick (I love cheese!) and it was awesome!!

I would definitely make this for a potluck since it does so well at room temperature.  For a potluck, i would make it in a square pan for easy to grab and go pieces.

I also omitted the mushrooms (yucky!) and increased the onions. I also used half pepper jack and half sharp cheddar to add just a hint of a kick, next time I will use only pepper jack, the kick was not there enough for me.  Also, the next time I make it, I will put crumbled bacon on top of the shredded cheese.

I made this recipe and tweaked it for items I had at home. I used low sodium turkey bacon that was cooked and crumbled; I added it the same time as the broccoli. I did not have half and half or fresh broccoli so I used 3/4 cup 2% milk and frozen broccoli florets; it turned out very good!

I used 1/2 times more ingredients for the crust to make more in a bigger baking dish and added 1 extra egg, 1/2 cup Colby and cooked sausage to the egg mixture. Awesome Brunch with different flavored Teas hot and cold and a Fruit Salad.

I found this in the new AR magazine, and had to try it. I was impressed! It has a lot of steps, and takes a while to make, but it was really good! I could see adding some meat to it, but it really doesn't need it! I loved the crust, too.

Delicious. Even my daughter who doesn't like nearly all the ingredients liked it. Added a packet of shrimps and didn't have fresh mushrooms so added canned, and didn't have dry mustard so added a small spoon Dijon mustard. Reduced baking time (hadn't read the extra 20 min. but was cooked perfectly)

For the most part we enjoyed this.  The crust is very good - I will use that again with other quiches.

I wanted something different from my standard Bisquick quiche, and this was great.  I made it pretty much as written, but used a 9 inch Pampered Chef pie pan.  I used a frozen box of broccoli and fresh mushroom because that's what I had on hand.  I used 1/2 cup fat free milk and 1/2 cup half and half.  It took almost 45 minutest to cook, but it was yummy!

My pie pan was 9.5 inches, not 8, so I increased everything, just guesstimating on amounts. It was very forgiving and turned out great, but I personally think I went too heavy on the broccoli. (Though every bit was eaten, so obviously others liked it!)  I will make it again, because it  was overall great, but experiment with more of the wet ingredients and less of the broccoli.

Great recipe! I made it with gluten free flour and it still tasted great! I also added cheese on top. Yum!

Turned out perfect! Delicious. I subbed cayenne pepper for the nutmeg and added a pinch of white pepper. The crust is what makes it extra yummy.

I doubled the crust on mine, as my pie plate is a 9.5. Love it with the thicker crust! The taste really comes through!!

Crust tasted like cheese and flour, couldn't taste those beautiful mushrooms.  Gave it a try the second day - some things get better over time.

Made with 1 bunch of fresh Asparagus and Habanero cheese.  We really enjoyed this pie.  Loved the cheesy crust.  Great meatless meal.

This is so so good! The only change I made is that I used almond flour in the crust instead of regular. I also omitted the flour in the filling (I'm eating low carb). It's was awesome! My kids even loved it.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone I share it with just loves it! The crust is so yummy! I added ham and bacon a couple of times and cut back on the salt, turns out fantastic! Thanks.

I saw this recipe in the new magazine and made it this weekend.  I thought it was absolutely delicious!  Another poster said it was dry and tasteless??  Ididn't think so at all, and neither did my family who ate almost the entire pie in one weekend.

Very easy and tasty.  I will have to try this again to get it completely right because I discovered that my onion was rotten about halfway through prep and had to use dried minced onion instead.  I think this would be even better the right way!  I think the cook times were off, my pie was fully solid after only 10 min at 375 (after 15 min at 400).
