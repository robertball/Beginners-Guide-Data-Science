I cut back a bit on the vinegar and brown sugar (we like things less sweet these days) and added some beef broth along with the water.  I had about half a bag of pearl onions in the freezer, so I added them in addition to the sliced onion (we love pot roast veggies!).  Cooked in the slow cooker for 5 hours on high, and it was perfectly cooked, meat falling apart.  I took out the veggies and meat, made some gravy, and then added all back into the gravy, turned to warm until we were ready to eat.  I garnished with some chopped parsley for a little pop of color; it was a nice Fall meal.

A busy day made pot roast the perfect choice. I used a two-pound chuck roast but the full amount of the sugar-mustard mix and the full amount of vinegar and water in a slow cooker on high for 5 hours. I think you really cannot mess this one up. It is my new favorite.

Couldn't have been happier with how this turned out. Used redskin potatoes and baby carrots. Subbed 1 cup beef broth for the 1/3 cup water and added some flour to thicken. Also carmelized 2 minced cloves of garlic in the oil before browning beef and added about 1/2 a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. The flavors were fantastic.

This is certainly the most flavorful pot roast I've ever made!  I followed the recipe, but cooked in my slow-cooker for 5 hours on high, layering onion on the bottom, then meat, then veggies on top. It turned out fantastic!  I initially questioned the salt, sugar, and vinegar combo, but it actually reminds me of ketchup!

Excellent!!!  This was the first recipe for roast that I have ever made besides in a slow-cooker and it was so flavorful.  Oh, I also used venison, but then all my roast are venison.

I usually use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the vinegar, but otherwise the way I've been doing it for 50 odd years.

Wonderful!  I followed a couple suggestions on previous reviews.  Instead of water, I added beef bullion to 2/3 cup of water and 1/3 of balsamic vinegar.

Very dry!  No liquid was left on the pot and I added 1/3 c of beef broth before cooking. Great flavor but needs more liquid and maybe cook on 250 instead of 350.

SO GOOD!!!  Will definitely make again!  I made it my Dutch oven. There was a lot of deliciousness left stuck to the pot, so after removing the food, I deglazed the pot with some red wine, then thickened it with some corn starch, added a little salt/pepper, and had a delicious gravy to go with it.

Perfection! The only modifications made were; using beef broth in place of water, added a half of a packet of Beefy Onion Soup and put in a bit of fresh chopped cilantro. Definitely a keeper! Couldnâ€™t have been easier to make...thank you for contributing this recipe!!!

My guests loved it.  It needed more than 2/3 cup of liquid. The pan was nearly completely dry when I took it out of the oven. Fortunately, the roast wasn't dry, but very tender. I did use beef stock instead of vinegar and water - the recipe didn't indicate which type of  vinegar to use and it makes a difference!

I don't remember ever making a pot roast without garlic so I added 3 cloves cut in half tossed in at the end of the browning. I used a rump roast and it was a bit dry but that is probably the meat. I usually use a chuck roast but did not have one. I also added Better than Buollion to the water. Very good flavor

Very good. I used two 2Lb chuck roasts and put them in the crockpot for 10 hours. So yummy. Family really liked the flavor. I would double the amount of carrots and celery, but only because we love them.

I didn't care for this recipe. I cooked almost exactly as written. I used a 3 pound USDA Choice chuck roast and instead of regular potatoes I used small red potatoes. Also, I used more potatoes and carrots than called for.  I cooked it in my iron Dutch oven, covered, about 3 hours. The gravy was entirely too vinagery tasting.  I did not like it at all. I'm going to try salvaging the meat and veggies by tossing the gravy and making some regular brown gravy.

I'd give this six stars if I could. Perfect for cast iron cooker. Don't change a thing.

Tasty, veggies should be added later.  I added mushrooms half hour before serving.
