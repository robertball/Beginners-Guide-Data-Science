This dish is amazing!  I have only just started cooking with quinoa and this recipe is the best, so far. For the chopped tomatoes, I used Happy Harvest Fire Roasted tomatoes from Aldi. I used just a few more ounces of mozzarella cheese.....because cheese is king in our house! Pretty much stuck to the recipe for the rest. So good!!

I added some eggplant to this in place of some of the quinoa. It was amazing. I chopped up the eggplant up coated it in about 3 tbs olive oil and 2 tbs Italian seasoning and baked for 20 minutes while I prepared the meat sauce. Super tasty addition.

I enjoyed this recipe! It felt good to be able to eat a version of lasagne when in trying to stay away from pasta!

Very good alternative to using noodles. Delicious and easy and leftovers freeze well.

Family liked it. First time using quinoa; 3 cups make a lot. Might use a leaner beef next time grease level seemed high. Used canned diced tomatoes. This will easily feed a family of 4 or 5. Leftovers are great!

I added zucchini slices as well, it’s really good. It’s not a “lasagna” though

The idea is great. I found it trying to use up 2.5 c cooked red quinoa. I did make some subs based on what I had in the house 2 cans diced tomato's 14.5 ounce but no sauce (I was out). I cup of broth to one 1.5 pounds ground beef onions mushroom and zucchini to extend the sauce. No ricotta so I played with proportions of the other cheeses and adding 2 ounces of Boursain. The rest was as written. The layers did not remain separate but overall it was very good. I will try it again with more effort to follow the recipe a little closer.
