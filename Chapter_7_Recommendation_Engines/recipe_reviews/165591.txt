I've made this salad twice.  The first time I forgot to add the lemon zest/juice and it turned out fabulous! The second time, I remembered to put in the lemon and didn't think it came out as good.  It was a little too tangy and the lemon slightly over powered the rest of the flavors.  I also used less cheddar in both dishes.  I would give it five stars, but have to give the original recipe four since I like it better without lemon.  Regardless, this salad is a definite keeper!

This was even better than I hoped for.  I had a store bought version and it left me wanting for more.  I thought I'd see if allrecipes had anything like it.  This is so much better.  I love the addition of lemon.  It makes it so bright and springy.  I was a little concerned about it being too much liquid because the dressing was very runny, however it really firms up in the refrigerator.  The only changes I made were using elbow macaroni, green onions instead of red, omitting the ham and using 1 tsp. of dill instead of 1 tablespoon.  It was delicious and the lemon juice and zest really made the dish for me.  Also, if you're making it to serve immediately and don't have thawed peas, just soak them in hot water for a few minutes and drain.  They thaw right out, but don't get cooked.  Thanks so much for the delicious new recipe.  This will be perfect for summer potlucks and bbqs.

I had to make substitutions due to ingredients on hand.  I used mini sea shells in place of the bow tie pasta.  Subbed chopped pepperoni for the diced ham.  I had to use plain low fat yogurt because I was out of sour cream. I did as the original poster stated and cubed the cheddar cheese.  Even with the substitutions, the lemon flavor really adds a nice light taste to this salad.  It's a nice change from all those sweet pasta salads.  I think it will taste even better after being refrigerated for a few hours.

I feel the need to not only review this recipe (which I thought was very good), but also to say it's not fair to give a recipe a low rating, simply based on nutritional content.The secret to a healthy lifestyle is not denying yourself what you really want -- if you want a calorie laden meal - then go for it. I love a piece of cheesecake now and then! In other words, we're big kids, we can make our own choices, thank you very much!

Oooh, Kimberly, you outdid yourself!  This was so good, even my kids who don't like peas ate it.  This should get an extra star just for that!  I used about half the lemon juice called for because my lemons seems especially strong this year.  I also used crumbled bacon instead of ham and green onions instead of red, but ONLY because I didn't want to go the store.  Next time I'll use the ham and red onion.  I'm sure it will be as good or even better.  Thanks! UPDATE: I've made this several times now, and its good as written, and with the above changes.  I always use a little less lemon, though.  I've been asked for this recipe many times!

Not particularly unique; but still a nice, pleasant pasta salad freshened with lemon (I cut back significantly and just used juice) and kept moist with the addition of a little olive oil.  In keeping with Hubs' preferences, I skipped the cayenne and added the crunch of celery he so loves in pasta salads.  Since he will eating this at the office for lunch, I swapped out the red onion for fresh chives for obvious reasons.  For a little extra flavor I added some Penzey's Buttermilk Dressing Seasoning.

I do all you can eat barbecues at my house, and I've made this recipe three times now; it's a keeper. Everyone loves it, even people who don't usually like pasta salad.  I use rotini pasta instead of bowtie, and I put red and yellow peppers without the ham.

Good flavor -- love the dill..... but Too much lemon as written....I mixed the other "sauce" ingredients, and added the lemon a little at a time, to taste.  Also, not enough sauce in general.  Double the sauce for the same amount of coarse ingredients.

Loved the mix of dill and lemon. I did add a bit more sour cream and mayo - just like a creamier consistency - will make again for sure!!

Wonderful, easy, fresh salad! The only change I made was I used crumbled cooked bacon instead of the ham cause that's what I had on hand. Kids loved it, an everyone had seconds. I think I'll add chopped/shredded cooked chicken next time to make it a complete meal! Thanks for this delicious salad recipe.

I really liked the blend of flavors, used bacon instead of ham, less cheese and chopped green onion instead of red.

Great spring/summer recipe. Refreshing on a hot day. The lemon, dill and cayanne pepper make this dish unique. Made a few vegetarian friendly substitutions: soy cheese instead of cheddar, worthington's "wham" instead of ham (any vege "ham" product will do the trick), Nayonase instead of mayonase and a sour cream substitue. It's really good!!!!

I omitted the ham, and used light sour cream and light mayo.  This salad was great, and kept wonderfully for lunch the next day too.  Will definitely make again - probably for a picnic!

This had a wonderful fresh taste.  I didn't add the lemon zest (was worried about a too lemony taste) - but I did everything else exactly like the recipe.  Everyone enjoyed it at the potluck I brought it to.  Highly recommend!

Loved the addition of dill and lemon; added all the lemon zest and slowly added the juice from the lemon but ended up using the amount called for. Did not use the kosher salt. Delicious!

I will not be making this again. I cut the lemon called for in half as per other reviewers and it was still a lot of lemon . It was also very dry. Not enough sauce for the amount of pasta. I was disappointed in the outcome.

Loved this! I was making for a get-together where several people are vegetarian, so I left out the ham, but it was still delicious. I really like the light lemony flavor with the dill. Very good, thank you!

This was good but the onion was a bit over kill. Not sure if we just got a strong tear inducing onion or if it was just to much. Will try again with "less is best"

Very good recipe!  Loved the flavors, although I did cut down the lemon juice a bit and did not use zest, because my daughter isn't a huge lemon fan.  I did mix a bit more dressing after it sat for awhile, as it seemed a bit dry.

This was a great combination of flavors.  I too used bacon instead of ham.   I forgot to add the cheddar cheese, but I felt as though it really didn't need it.  I will try it next time with the cheese and ham.  Everything else was exact to the recipe. This is a keeper!

I absolutely love this recipe and make it very often.  The lemon, dill and cayenne make an excellent combo.  But I always add more veggies to this.  Corn, chopped celery, chopped red, green, yellow and orange peppers.  Gives some crunch and color!  Yum!

I cut back on the lemon and it still had a strong lemon flavor. You really have to be a lemon lover to like it. I did like one review said and put bacon instead of ham and I also put extra cheese. It was dry after refrigerated for a very short time. The lemon flavor was over powering you could not taste anything else. I will try it again though, without lemon in it.

Really nice, easy to make recipe. All the flavors went together well. Made it day before picnic and added the cheese before serving. I will make this over and over again.

made this for the fam last week, seemed like a good 'it's spring!' meal...

everyone loved it... we used low-fat mayo and sour cream, didn't affect the overall flavor... also, next time we make it we'll probably use 1/2 as much cheese as 8 oz is more than enough...

enjoy!...

I tried this recipe, but left out the ham, I think the ham would have made it more tasty, I will try it again, but add the ham next time!

This is the best thing that I have ever had. I will like to make this dish for my family every day and I know they will enjoy this because this is their lifestyle which is the best thing that any family should have.

I pretty much followed the recipe but I use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. It was so good I could hardly stay out of it!  Perfect for leftover ham.

This was a wonderful salad.  It makes enough to feed several people (think church potluck or ladies luncheon).  I changed out a pound of shrimp for the ham (baked in the oven for 6 minutes with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt and pepper).  I used 2 tbsp white wine vinegar for the lemon juice and would recommend 1 tbsp.  I ended up adding a tbsp of sugar.  The salad was yummy.

Very good! The only change I made was to use fresh dill. 
Will make this again:)
