My only mistake was I did not get 2 cans of Golden Mushroom soup and substituted an extra can of Cream of Mushroom that was in the pantry.    I maybe added a bit more garlic and I did add about 1/2 pound of sliced fresh mushrooms early.  It was fantastic and my beautiful bride gave me accolades!  I will try it as posted next time, because I think that it is a great recipe.  Thanks, no many thanks to the originator of the recipe.  I will share it with family and friends.

Pretty good.  The easiest meal I ever made.  Served over noodles.  Going to serve the leftovers over garlic mashed potatoes.

I have made this a few times and it comes out wonderful every time. Somewhere along the way I started adding 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar to the soups. I thought it was in the recipe but I see now that it's just in my notes. The flavor it adds is delicious! Maybe a little like stroganof.

This recipe was absolutely delish!! I didn't have all of the exact recipes on hand, just substituted some soups & seasonings, but it turned out wonderful. I had always seared my meat before, but obviously as with this recipe, it is not necessary!

I have made my pot roast this way for years in my pressure cooker, once in awhile I will cook it in the oven.  The smells are sooo good.  I also use bay leaves (a remnant of my mom's cooking pot roast). I also developed a taste for golden mushroom soup I can't shake...MMMM!!

I’ve made this for years. Tastes even better by adding a tablespoon Worcester sauce, thickly sliced baby portobello mushrooms, and a medium sliced onion in the slow cooker at the beginning.  Makes a great sauce.

I used about a 3 pound roast, but two cans of golden mushroom soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom and what the recipe calls for on the other ingredients.  I tried it with pasta for something different and it was ok, but had leftovers with mashed potatoes and that was MUCH better.  I’ve been looking for a new roast recipe and I found it!

I made this with a bottom roast because it was on sale. Cut off a lot of the fat and cooked it as the recipe says less the two cans of mushrooms (I don't like mushrooms). It was SO good. Shredded the meat and served it over egg noodles like in the picture. So easy and definitely comfort food. Next time I'm going to try seasoning the meat more.

This was great comfort food and easy to assemble. I used a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic instead of adding minced garlic and cut the recipe in half. Served it over egg noodles. I will be making this again!

I just finished mixing this all together.  I did add carrots, celery and fresh onions as I had some left over and wanted to add some veggies to it, but I'm looking forward to it when I get out of work!

Kind of bland even though I used extra garlic. Meat was fatty. Gravy was good over noodles.
