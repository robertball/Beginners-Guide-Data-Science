I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! It's amazing how much alcohol you can taste considering there isn't much in it but I think that is an asset! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

I made this for a dinner party of 16. Once this dessert was served all you could hear was the clinking of spoons against the bowls.  It was quite a hit!

My friends and I love this recipe but I removed the chocolate chip and added grated chocolate the second time I made it.

I just made this on Saturday for my family dinner, and we all LOVED it!

I did accidentally burn the almonds, so I did not have them to mix in, but it still was DELICIOUS!

I recommend this recipe to anyone!

This is sooo delicious. My aunt always makes this for christmas and it is always a hit. We were having a party, so I decided I'd try to show my aunt up, and I succeeded spectacularly. The only problem I had was that it was very messy to make, but maybe that was just me. Thankyou for sharing. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe took more time to assemble than it was worth.  I've tasted better.  I had  a difficult time finding the cookies and finally got them at an Italian grocery, far away.  The rum was expensive as is the entire recipe.
