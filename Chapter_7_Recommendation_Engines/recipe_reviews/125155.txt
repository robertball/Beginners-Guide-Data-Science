I threw in a half teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders into the cream cheese. I used reduced fat cream cheese and because I did not have pickle relish, I used one large garlic dill that I ran through the mini food processor with the rest of the filling ingredients. I thought this was enough for three--one each for my kids and one for my husband, until he called me from work and asked why he didn't get two! VERY good. I'll make this again.

This was very good.  Instead of relish, I chopped up a couple of kosher dill pickle spears and threw that in.  I whirled everything in the food processor for a minute or two.  We made sandwiches on home made wheat bread.  YUM!

This is too "rich" of a filling to use as a sandwich spread. Works well as a dip for crackers.

Nice twist on regular 'ol ham and cheese! I toasted some rye bread for this and it was perfect with some tomato soup for nice lunch! Thanks for a great recipe Mattie!

This was good... not great, but good.  If you are bored with the same old ham sandwiches.  It might be better on toast or a tortilla though.

This was very good and had a nice Dijon flavor that wasn't too strong. The cream cheese made this very rich and heavy and it really seemed more suited for a party appetizer than a full fledged sandwich. I cut mine in small bites and was full by half a sandwich's worth of bites. I used mesquite smoked ham shaved lunch meat that I cut up, sweet relish, and a mexican cheese blend (it's all I had). This would be wonderful for a tortilla roll-up appy filling. Thanks for a different lunch. I really liked this sandwich.

As has been said before, this is a very rich sandwich. But it's good...and different. I was looking for something just a tad different today. I scaled the recipe down for 1 sandwich but thought there wasn't enough meat, so I added a little more.
