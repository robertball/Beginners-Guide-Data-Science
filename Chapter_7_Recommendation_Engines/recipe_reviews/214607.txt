Family and friends gathered for a birthday party and I have to tell you the guest of honor was the crockpot full of this recipe! I like having something "hot and cooked" among the many dips, and various other finger foods at parties and this worked like a charm. Put it in the pot and forget it til time to serve.  This will prove to be a favorite in future events at our house.  Copies of the recipe were made for several guests who loved this delightful dish.  No muss, no fuss, just good eating.  Thank you!!

PLEASE READ: I submitted this recipe, so perhaps l  shouldn't rate it, esp because I just noticed that the amount (posted) of red pepp flakes SHOULD be 1 TEAS, NOT 1 TBLS! I like things w/a kick, but this is a recipe I serve to crowds (mult serv made) & not everyone likes things spicy....1 tsp is enough to give it a kick, w/out putting more sensitive pallets off....PLease try..Also, I've done s&s w/grape jelly before, & I feel the currant jelly makes a (good) difference...Lastly, my supermarket sells a variety of "grades" of kielbasa....Hillshire Farms is my (preferred) choice...Not super expensive, & the "really cheap stuff" just doesn't come out as well (& I'm always looking for a way to save a buck!)

Super-easy and very yummy!  Instead of using my crock pot today, I boiled the sauce to a smooth consistency and then I threw everything else into the pan (eliminating the water) and added green and red pepper for more nutrition.  Quick and easy supper!

I  made this yesterday for my son's Boy Scout family potluck. I made it exactly with the exception of cutting the red pepper to 1 tsp. I loved it. Big hit. I will make again next week with rice for dinner. Yummy and easy. Thanks so much!

This is a super easy recipe with la lot of flavor.  I made a few changes to the recipe:  instead of red current jam I used grape jelly and only a pinch of red pepper flakes.  In addition, I used a small can of pineapple chunks and used the juice for from the can in place of the water.

Very good recipe where you can use what you have on hand.I used smoked sausages and  spicy kielbasa. I did not have red currant jelly so I used a cup of homemade green grape jelly. Also did not have chili ketchup, so I used reg ketchup and spiced it up with a 1/4 cup homemade Thai sweet chili sauce with added 1/4 cup small frozen berries w/pomegranate in the pot ,but I omitted the water and the flakes since the Thai sweet chili sauce was spicy already.Added one finely diced red pepper for extra flavour. Also fried up the sausages like one of the reviewers said and it turned out fantastic. No leftovers and so glad I tried this with our roast dinner. The sweet sauce was great on the roast beef and on the mashed carrot/potatoes too.

This couldn't have been more simple or more tasty!  I did have to make some changes to the cooking time, as I wasn't watching the clock as closely as I should have been.  I cooked covered on high for two hours, and then uncovered on high for one hour.  I also used half the recommended pepper flakes and next time I might leave out the water.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family LOVED this!!  So easy to just throw it all in the slow cooker.  I did substitute tomato sauce for the chili sauce, but that is because I didn't have any on hand.  Served it with a ranch dipping sauce.  I will be making this a staple appetizer from now on.

I used fresh chopped onions in this recipe.  I wanted it to be a comfort food sandwich.  It reminds me of a bologna dish my mom made when I was growing up.  I love Kielbasa because it is so versatile., and this recipe allows for creativity.

Instead of a big dinner at Christmas, because there are sooo many of us we do appetizers! This was very good! I think when I make it again I will cut back on the red pepper flakes to please everyone's taste. The kids and the elderly thought it a bit spicy!

Just made this today as an appetizer for a birthday party and it was a big hit.  I mixed the chili sauce and jelly (used Welch's grape, no red currant at my grocery store); heated it to a simmer on the stove top.  Tossed in the kielbasa pieces to heat still on the stovetop while I got dressed.  Transferred it to the crockpot, took it to the party and got quite a few compliments.  I forgot to add the red pepper flakes-- which was probably lucky as it turns out.  Several people asked before tasting it "is it spicy?" So I think the red pepper would have made it less appealing to more than a few people. The chili sauce mixed with jam gave a good balanced flavor, not too spicy and not too sweet.  Hard to guess tasting it the ingredients.

I followed the recipe as given.
It was well received.
BUT I have to change things.
Instead of the sweet and sour sauce, I use a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray Hickery and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. I add an 8 ounce can of pinapple chunks with juice and about a 1/4 cup Port wine to rinse out the BBQ sauce bottle. And add liquid to cover if needed.

Five stars. I came across this recipe about a year ago and I've already made it about 20 times. Not just for myself either, I've been asked at least five times to make this for friends of mine going to parties or events. It's Soooo delicious. First time I made this it was spicy as hell so I cut the pepper flakes in half, I actually just saw the note in the comments.  Well, here in Massachusetts we r gonna get hammered by our first storm of the year. I'll be going to the market in a couple minutes to buy the ingredients to make this delicious recipe!

Very easy and tasty.  A great thing to quickly add if you're worried you don't have enough variety of appetizers for the table.  I made them for the super bowl.  Also good the next day.

I didn't really care for it. I would prefer to make it with BBQ sauce and grape jelly. My husband really liked it though.

I have been making this for years, and it's always the first to go. I use grape jelly, and I always brown the sliced kielbasa in a skillet to render some of the fat. A super simple winner!

Fine but nothing special.  I'll stick to my bbq sauce and apple jelly for this type appetizer.
