This turned out wonderful. Not for the novice cook as you do have to juggle many tasks but that said this was my first souffle in years. It is a forgiving recipe. I roughly halved ingredients. I did not have chocolate liquor and used brandy instead. I made a small hole in the top and stuffed the souffles with the melted chocolate chips (I added a bit of  butter to the chocolate chips and melted it in the microwave to help with consistency). Still fantastic. I watched several YouTube videos on how to make a souffle before attempting this- I would highly recommend doing this.

Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe! The only ingredients I altered about the recipe was that I substituted the quantity of milk with heavy cream. And for the gal who asked about what size ramekin: I have single serving ramekins (7oz) and was able to use this recipe for 4. The chocolate chips he noted as ''melted (optional)''; I used a bit of intuition that he meant for the drizzle of the raspberry at the bottom of the souffle. If he meant it like that or not, I did it anyway and they came out very delicious! Bravo!

It would really help to know what size ramekins are needed. Also, you never said what to do with the chocolate chips. I wonder if this recipe can be made in one large souffle dish, and if so, what size? Feb.10 Update...thanks for telling the ramekins size, David's Chimpy! I also used a little intuition and removed "of the raspberry" from your statement about the chocolate chips, to understand what you meant. I think you're correct and the melted chocolate chips are to be drizzled in the bottom of the ramekins, along with the optional raspberry in each.

I was so dissappointed!  I was so excited to make this dessert and it was just a massive dissappointment.  I have to say it was one of the easier souffle recipes I have done and they raised beautifully and were absolutely PERFECT consistency, but the taste left much to be desired.   The chocolate flavour was pretty much non-existent.  I did not do the optional melted chocolate or rasberry in the bottom which I think would have made it better, but these tasted way too eggy and not NEARLY chocolatey enough.

came out perfect, they rose 3 centimeters out of the dish. Perfect texture and taste. I drizzled a chocolate and kahlua sauce on them with rasberries.

The first souffle I've ever tried to make or taste, this recipe turned out beautifully!  The raspberries/chocolate in the bottom are a must - I don't think I would have cared much for it otherwise.  Using whipping cream instead of milk was a great idea as well.  In all honesty though - I like a chewy brownie better!

I am an intermediate scratch baker.  First stab at souffles and this was encouraging.  They rose beautifully but then fell.  I think they were overhanded because I put them in large ramekins but found I had to use smaller ones for four servings.  I use the 3-ish inch ones that are maybe 1.5 inches tall for 4 servings.  A bit too eggy and not enough chocolate for my taste.  I would do a lot more choc chip ganache if I made again.

Totally awesome recipe!!! (:
I liked the result a bunch and felt quite proud of myself for making what other people think of as a difficult dish, but with this recipe it was pretty easy. The dish did take a bit longer than one hour for me to make though because I didn't have any chocolate liquer and had to make it myself. (I used chocolate and soymilk) By the way, I was also able to get away with using soymilk and coconut butter instead of their dairy counterparts and the souffles still tasted great. (:

I've made this twice now both times I used a gluten free mix (better batter) and the second time it was also dairy free. We have some food allergies in the family but both times they turned out great! Even those who can eat gluten and have the dairy fully enjoyed these with a little raspberry sauce, powdered sugar. The dishes were nearly licked clean!

I absolutely loved this recipe, i decided i wasnt a big fan of the texture on the inside, but every one else adored it. i made a few changes to the recipe myself...

i substituted the chocolate liqueur for a coffee liqueur, and the chocolate chips (they were optional) i melted over the stove top, and blended the raspberries into it, making a very delicious raspberry chocolate sauce to drizzle on top of the souffles, and to make a sauce for plating.

Somewhat glad at least it turned out good, a bit flavourful and looked like a souffle, but since the recipe was confusing and somewhat complicated to follow, i've tried my best to measure well and go step by step. Should describe more into detailed about ramekin size, is it 7oz? 9? 12? I used 7 and the souffle came out of the cups and fizzed back into a dough looking like after. Does have the eggy taste, i would probably just reduce my egg quantity next time and add more cocoa.

Was an easy to make recipe especially for my first souffle, but I found it a wee bit bland.

I made this recipe substituting heavy cream for the milk; it came out GREAT, my husband LOVED it!  I served it in 4 6oz. ramekins with a chocolate sauce on the side. I made the sauce myself using 6oz of mini semi-sweet chocolate morsels, 1/4 cup heavy cream and 3 Tablespoons of chocolate liquor. I combined all three ingredients in a small saucepan on medium heat and stirred until blended. I also used a drizzle of the chocolate sauce at the bottom of each ramekin.

Quite the recipe there Army Chef,

I tweak all recipies to my tastes I only use organic ingredients and vanilla beans for wilder flavours I also used 0 Pastry and Bread flour which has a bit of yeasts in it so the soufflé you make will pouf more up as a good soufflé should.  I have recently used an Aztec Chocolate Cocoa with Chilies and the heat fruits make this a True 5 Star Recipe. !!!     

The cocoa I use is called by Dagoba Organic Chocolate Xocolatl has sugar cane and cinnamon too What A Fabulous Chocolate !!!  My Larder is full of it !

I absolutely love this recipe and I cooked it longer because the time mentioned wasn't enough
