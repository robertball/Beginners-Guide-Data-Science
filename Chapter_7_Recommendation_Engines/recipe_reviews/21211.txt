The first time I made this I didn't follow directions, and I liked it better than the time I did. Instead of waiting to add the wine, I just threw the wine in together w/ the rest of the ingredients, and simmered it for about 1/2 an hour. It was less heady that way and could accommodate even the worst of red wines. Also, I put in entire orange wedges instead of orange rinds. Although I adjusted the water, sugar, and fruit juice for having only 3 cups of wine (thanks to the reviewer who said that 1 bottle = 3 cups), I kept the same amount of spices and oranges and left out the salt. Next time, I'd add even less sugar. It was a tad on the sweet side for me.

This is pretty good - we threw in some brandy too, and reduced the sugar - it was a little sweet.  Also, one bottle of wine isn't 4 cups!  750 ml = 3 1/2 c.  Not a big deal unless you are tripling the recipe ;-)

This recipe is excellent for a cold winter night and a gathering of good friends!!  I tried it out on a group of women that get together once a month and it was the official drink for the next month as well.  One of them used the recipe for a holiday party at her workplace and it was a smash there as well!  This is an very smooth, sweet, warm drink to include at winter dinners.

Like this--I just reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup because otherwise it just seems to sweet to me, with all the other fruit juices.  One trick I learned from Food Network is to put the cloves in the orange rind so they are easier to get out                before serving.

delicious and always a hit - the juices make it not quite so potent. Simmers all day and makes the house smell wonderful

I took this to a Christmas party last night where it was a big hit and didn't last long.  I sliced the oranges after peeling them and added them to the Crock-pot which I used for keeping it warm.  My husband thought that adding some brandy next time might be a nice addition.  Either way, it's a winner with us.

I sliced two whole oranges into 1/4" rounds rather than using just the peel.  It made it even more festive.  This is a very nice drink.

I served it during the holidays and my guests loved it. I used a cabernet sauvignon and kept it warm in my slow cooker.
Thanks Bea

What a great recipe! So easy. It's a great way to use up that bottle of not so great wine but using a good, full bodied wine is even better. I also added some Grand  Mariner and half the sugar. Very warming in the cold months and at friendly gatherings.

I only had one orange and one bottle of wine, but this tasted pretty good.  It smells great and is a little different than hot chocolate.

I've been looking for a good mulled wine recipe all winter, but I find most too bitter after simmering lemon or orange slices in the wine, but with using only the rind the bitter factor was not an issue.  We also found we only wanted about half the sugar, but that's such a matter of what type of juice your using and personal taste.  We also found stirring in a shot of bourbon or brandy ramped up all the flavors and left us feeling like we had curled up in a fuzzy blanket in front of a warm fire.

I make this for the holidays every year and put it in old wine bottles and mason jars as gifts.  Everyone loves it hot or over ice.
