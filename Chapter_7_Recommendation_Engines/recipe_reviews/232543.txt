I only made one adjustment to the recipe--instead of water, I used buttermilk. I did not get 18 muffins out of this recipe, I actually got 12 that were a bit on the smaller side. Baked at 350*, mine were done at exactly 20 minutes. Ohmygoodness, are these GORGEOUS! They look like something you'd see on the cover of a cooking magazine. And they were absolutely delicious! This was perfect for me as someone who is cooking with on hand ingredients but wanted to bake something. Excellent muffin recipe!

Very simple and could be simpler. As a handcraft baker, we developed fail-safe shortcuts to speed up production. I put all the dry ingredients in and then mixed them with the whip to be sure the baking soda was well dispersed. Next, I put in the softened butter. In the morning, I added the two eggs, pumpkin and water while mixing with the batter attachment, not the whip. I made 12 large muffins and 12 mini muffins for the grand kids. One major difference that will definitely improve taste and how well they keep, I used pastry flour. We would never have used a standard patent flour in muffins. Standard patent is simply wrong and dries the product out. The old bakers would have knocked me in the head if I had made that mistake. I miss those guys. Anyway, this will result in moister muffins.

I am no top chef, so I love recipes that turn out right if you at least follow directions. I LOVE cinnamon and tis the season for pumpkin (plus being pregnant) this 100% satisfied the craving! I'm saving this for my go-to recipe box. I might add more cinnamon next time, but I'm very happy with these!

Loved this recipe, the spices, & especially the smooth texture.  Opted for a healthier version- used less butter & sugar used half whole wheat flour & topped with walnuts instead of streusel .  Very moist & loved the crunch of the nuts on top.  It's a new favourite!

these muffins are amazing! but the the strusel melted and the muffin soaked it up I suggest putting them in the oven and and wait until there almost done than put the strusel on top than put back in for maybe 5 minutes to crisp up the strusel but other than that they were so delicious!

Made these muffins this morning to take to a crew working at my church - needed to use some pumpkin that I had frozen this fall (a friend gave me a 40# baking pumpkin - and there is a TON of it in the freezer).  Recipe worked perfectly.  My streusel topping didn't turn out like a streusel - more like a candy top - but it was delicious anyway.  I made 18 tiny muffins and 5 regular size muffins.  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out very good! I was looking for a recipe to use up some apricot butter that I canned last year. I replaced the pumpkin in this recipe with the apricot butter and used slightly less water. It turned out moist and delicious! The streusel did not work out quite as planned, but I think it was a rookie mistake using spreadable butter instead of regular!  I used a regular cupcake pan and got 18 muffins. I will definitely make these again!

Really yummy muffins! I always make a recipe exactly as printed the first time I make it. The only thing I would change is the streusel topping to make it more crunchy. I will make this recipe again, and again I'm sure.

Recipe is very easy to make and turns out very moist and I even used all purpose flour.  I did find that the muffins are really small, I will not do 18 next time, I like'm bigger :)  They are extremely tasty even though the streusel is not a streusel lol.

Very good and very easy. Only thing I did differently, after reading the reviews, was use pastry flour and double the topping. Neither change is probably needed. These are very moist!!! I will definitely be making these again!

Simple easy recipe. I don't know what another reviewer was saying about these coming out dry if you use regular flour. They are incredibly moist. The flavour is good, simple, but good. I'll add oats and pecans to the streusel topping next time.

Great flavor. I didn't bother with the streusel topping. Mine only made 12 muffins ( as I like them a little bigger) and had to cook for @ 27 minutes

These turned out good. Very moist and the texture was good. The streusel made a nice sweet crunch on the top. I stuck to the recipe other than I doubled it to accommodate the amount of pumpkin I had. My daughter says this one is a keeper!

I took the recipe and poured into a 13x 9 pan and topped it with double the streusel.  Excellent. I also suggest making the streusel in a food processor.

It is a VERY easy recipe and super delish.  Instead of the cinnamon I used pumpkin spice which made them taste like pumpkin pie.  As well, I used milk instead of water to add more substance to them.  One additional ingredient was pumpkin seeds ontop with the streusel.    This was a huge hit

I thought it was good (most and the streusel topping was yummy) but it didn't have enough pumpkin flavor for me.

Yummy! The streusal topping did get soggy after the first day.  I read that putting some saltine crackers into the container for storage helps.  It didn't seem to make a difference for me though.  Probably best same day.  Very good flavor though!

I had a huge batch of pumpkin that needed using and I wanted a recipe with very basic ingredients. This was it and they came out delicious. Very moist, with a slightly crunchy top layer and just the right amount of pumpkin flavor. I followed the recipe very closely. I didn't have ginger so I didn't use ginger and I accidently totally forgot the water but it seemed to not have needed any water. I did play with some toppings. I topped some with blueberries, some with white chocolate chips and some I left plain. They were all good but my favorite were the blueberries. In the future I might try mixing and matching more toppings like walnuts, pecans, chocolate chips, cranberries, or coconut shavings.

I used canned sweet potato instead of pumpkin, and shortening instead of butter. They were pure awesomeness!

I've made this several times, big hit with the family and very tasty.
