This recipe is delicious. Followed the recipe used Penzey s Now and Sweet curries and their garam masala and their chicken bullion.

This is the first time I've ever made this soup. I always thought it was made with lamb which I just hate. lol. So when I actually read the recipe and happened to have a rotissirie chicken ready and waiting I decided to try it. I didnt have the bell peppers on hand so had to omit them but used everything else. It was delicious!! Now I know I actually love this:) So did family..ty

Great flavor warms body & soul! Quick to put together. I did omit the salt and made it gluten free by substituting 4 T. potato starch for the flour(didn't thicken it much so add more if you wanted it thicker.) It would also be good without the tomatoes.
