Very good marinade for pork chops. I used 3 ounces of anchovy paste for the anchovy fillets. Worked well. Next time I make this marinade I'll cut down the fresh rosemary to 1/4 cup. The six cloves of garlic was great. I grilled the pork chops on the Foreman grill for 10 minutes each chop.

Disgard such a wonderful marinade--never!!!  I spread it over the pork chops and baked it onto them.  It was fantastic.  I can picture it on chicken and fish and have been thinking of working with it to stuff a pork tenderloin. Or---maybe just eat it off a spoon---that good!!!

Absolutely delicious! My husband and younger son love anchovies (me and my oldest cant stand them). Made these with the expectation of making something else for me and my oldest, but was so good making them again 2days later (by request from everyone).

Made this last night. Oh, Mommy is this good. Marinated overnight
and threw on the grill. I cut the recipe in half as I only had 2 chops.
I used 1T.& 1t. dried rosemary, didn't have fresh and used a 2 oz. can
anchovies. I love garlic, used 5 cloves. Cut the rest of the ingredients in half and sprinkled a little kosher salt and pepper on 
chops before putting on grill. Thanks Klantz for posting.

Even though I love the pairing of pork and rosemary, this dish was not outstanding.

I used this marinade on a bone-in turkey breast and left in the fridge for 24 hours.  My husband usually doesn't ask much about my cooking, but he had to know why the turkey was so delicious!

I made this for friends who all really enjoyed it, and liked the surprise ingredient of anchovy.  I used anchovy paste, and marinated longer.  Will definitely make again.

this recipe is outstanding.  My husband said they were probably the best he ever had.  I had very thick chops and they took quite a bit longer than the recipe says.  I am not a pork chop lover, but these I would make again in a heart beat.  I used dried rosemary as fresh was not to be had.

I used dried rosemary, boneless chops, and a two ounce can of anchovies. These minor subs were a result of not wanting to run to the store. Everyone enjoyed, even the kiddos. You definitely get a subtle difference in this recipe. But it it so subtle that no one will realize there is fish in it.
