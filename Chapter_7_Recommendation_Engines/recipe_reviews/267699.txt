Great bread recipe for a keto diet.  Very good hot out of the oven.  Holds up well in the toaster.  Slices nicely for sandwiches.  Didn't have garlic salt so substituted 1 teaspoon of salt and garlic powder which may have made it a little salty for my taste, will cut salt in half next time.  Dough is really sticky.  I used a pastry scraper to help with the kneading and olive oil on the hands when forming the bagels.  May be my oven, but I had to bake them a little longer to get the golden brown color.  Will make again and experiment with different herbs and spices...maybe even a sweet version. Thanks for this recipe....a winner.

These were really good. The texture wasn't exactly like real bagels obviously, but it was much better than other low carb breads. My dough was pretty soft , so I found it easiest to shape them by forming them into balls, and then poking a hole through the middle. They were really easy to cut and weren't crumbly and dry. Thanks for the great recipe!

I’ve been doing the keto diet for the past 5 weeks and was looking for an east bread alternative. I tried this recipe and made it as specified but found the dough was too sticky and I added 1/2 cup more almond flour to it. I made 9 ‘mini bagels’ out of this dough and they came out very salty and not at all a bagel consistency or texture. They’re more like a biscuit, but they still taste good. I won’t be using these as bagels, but rather as a biscuit.

I'm not a big fan of fathead dough.  But if you are needing a bread fix, it does give you that savory feeling without the carbs.  This particular recipe was too salty for me.  These really don't make good bagels though.  They don't toast up well and stay soggy/wet in the middle from all the cheese in them.  They make decent sandwiches, and can be used in other recipes such as pizza etc.  I enjoyed trying the recipe.  Thanks!
