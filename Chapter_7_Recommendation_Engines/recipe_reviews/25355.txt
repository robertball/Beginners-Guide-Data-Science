My 9 year old loves these and has nicknamed them 'pizza pancakes'!  Keep the batter thin and keep them small to ensure they cook through.  We also cut back on the green and red pepper.

These were great, I knew my boys would love them-they are pizza flavoured. After making the first batch and tasting them, I added a little more Italian spice (preference) then I fried them in long stips rather than pancakes. When they cooled I cut the strips in half lengthwise-perfect dipping fingers. Sent them for lunch with a side of pizza sauce-tomato paste, chicken broth, Italian spice, parmesean cheese, and garlic.  I will make again, thanks for the recipe

I really enjoyed these.  I served them with some warmed pasta sauce on the size. My only (small) complaint is that without the pasta sauce to dip them in, these were rather bland on their own.  I think the recipe needs more Italian seasoning and maybe some crushed red pepper for a kick.  Still, I will be making these again, I'll just increase the spices.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are good! Next time I'm going to increase the Italian seasoning, add garlic, and maybe throw in a dash of red pepper flakes. We ate them with a bit of sauce and extra cheese on top and I sauteed zucchini to go on the side. Yum!

Made this for Recipe Group:  02, April '11.  I am giving this 4-stars because I did not follow the exact recipe.  I down sized it to 4 servings and got 4 nice size cakes.  I used ham (on hand) instead of the pepperoni and salsa rather than the pizza sauce.  All other ingredients were used.  I doubt I would have tried these if it weren't for the group challenge.  I liked them and will be sharing with my family at the lake for a "different" weekend breakfast this summer.  Thanks Sal for sharing your recipe.

First off made two changes, I used canadian bacon and pepperoni bits in place of sausage. I aslo left out onion and tomato, plus I did half a batch. My family loved these served with pizza sauce for duncking.

without a picture, i wasn't sure how these would look or turn out, but they came out very well! I had to flip them a few more times than i would a regular pancake, but to delicious results. the batter kept in the fridge for a day (that's how long it lasted) and cooked up even better and tastier the next day.

Recipe Group Recipe****Very good! My kids loved these and were asking me when we would have the pizza cakes again while they were still eating them :) I did change the recipe a little. I didn't have red bell pepper so I used all green, added garlic powder and extra Italian seasoning. I used the little mini pepperoni's and they worked great in this recipe perfect size for the cakes. The kids liked these dipped in pizza sauce I wasn't to fond of it that way but I did use some soft Swiss cheese spread on top and that was awesome. Thanks for the recipe I'll be making these again.

Recipe Group selection 4/2/11.  What a great addition to our usual Sunday brunch.  The only change I made was to omit the pepperoni so our vegetarian guests could eat them.  Good job, Sal!

Made these for Recipe Group, and thought they were really yummy! I halved the recipe, and got 11 cakes out of it. I used mozzarella cheese instead of the monterey jack, because that's what I had, and added in some parmesan cheese and garlic powder just for something extra. These were actually kind of fun to make, and I had everything on hand which made it even better! I chopped everything fairly small, including the pepperoni to ensure a nice distribution. Not sure what else you would serve with these though, but they were a great snack/appetizer on their own w/ a great pizza flavor. I actually preferred them not dipped in any sauce, but the guys liked them w/ the sauce. We were all happy campers w/ this recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

I adusted this recipe a bit by leaving out the green pepper and using ham in place of sausage. These are savory pizza pancakes (not nearly as elegant sounding as their name) and pretty tasty. They received thumbs up from everyone. I scaled the recipe to half the original and made them bigger than suggested, yielding 14 small pancakes. Note that they take a long time to cook. It says 20 minutes under 'cook time' which was true of mine, but the directions just say to brown on both sides. I only read the directions and didn't pay attention to the stated cook time, so I was caught off guard thinking they would take about as long as typical pancakes. These were delicious and different and I'm happy to have a new alternative for breakfast, especially one that is popular with kids and adults alike. Definitely serve with pizza sauce for dipping.

Fabulous! A great alternative to regular old weekend breakfast or brunch. I was concerned that this would make too much, but it almost wasn't enough! The only change was that I left out pizza sauce because I didn't have any. It was still excellent. Will make again.

Though listed as a veggie breakfast, the pepperoni is decidedly un-veggie. Once removed, this is a splendid Italian veggie pancake.

These savory pancakes are a really neat idea. I can see a lot of ways to adjust the spices & ingredients to suit your own palate. As it stands, this was not exactly perfect for us, but it's still a solid recipe. 4.5 stars, thanks Recipe Group for choosing this one -- I'd had it in my box forever!

I actually haven't made this yet, but want to try it tomorrow - does anyone know if you can use pancake mix instead of "biscuit" baking mix? 
Thanks!!

This is a great flexible recipe.  I intended on trying it as written first, but I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I don't think it really mattered.  It was a nice base recipe.  Loved using up the leftovers from my fridge.  We substituted diced ham for the pepperoni, chili for the pizza sauce, and didn't have sour cream, so mixed milk and cream cheese until it was the desired consistency. In any case, we loved this!  SO fun to make Italian Leftovers lunch pancakes!!  Thank you for the idea!!!
