This isn't the cheapest recipe in the book, but it is extremely simple and tastes like a gourmet dish from a fine restaurant - but served in our kitchen! My husband liked it, and I loved it. I used fresh sage when I baked it, as I'd run out of dried. Served it with a garlic/shallot/olive oil/white wine rice /green bean pilaf (impromptu concoction!), and it was wonderful.

This recipe was fantastic. A very sophisticated flavor. The kids (age 7 and 8) didn't care for it too much, but my husband and I LOVED it. The red wine marinade does turn the chicken a purplish color, so don't be alarmed. I would recommend slicing the apples very thin and going a little heavy on the brie. That's what I did and it was delicious.

Was just ok. Didn't have sage so I used a little bit of Herbs de Provence...might have been why it wasn't that great.

Considering the rating I was really excited about this recipe and ended up being quite disappointed. It was good and worth making once, but I wont be making it again. I recommend that if you make this, marinate the apple slices with the chicken for at least half of the time and serve with asparagus. We served it over rice.

This dish was odd. It is defiantly an acquired taste. It wasn't terrible but I don't think I would make it again. Surprisingly my boyfriend liked it and I didn't. He doesn't normally like meals like this.

i really liked the combination of flavors in this dish!  My husband doesn't usually like brie and liked this dish. I didn't have red wine on hand, so I used white wine w/ a dash of red wine vinegar in it.

This recipe is simple to prepare and combines great flavors.  The red wine does make the chicken  an interesting  purple/red color.  Chicken breasts are a bit thick, next time I will be using cutlets or slicing the breasts before adding toppings & broiling.

This was good, though I have some suggestions: More sage, slightly less time in the oven, and watch it carefully in the broiler!

Excellent!  I used Whoop Whoop Shiraz for the marinade, and it paired very well with the brie.  I only marinaded it for 6 hours and it was still moist and very flavorful.  It was a little difficult to eat with the apple slices on top, and the brie didn't melt so it wasn't mixed.  If you aren't worried about presentation, maybe chop them up and mix them together? Also, the chicken is an alarming deep purple color.  But VERY good. Will definitely make again!
