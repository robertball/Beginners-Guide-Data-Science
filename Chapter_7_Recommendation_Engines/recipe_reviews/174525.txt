Okay, I tried this one tonight.  Very tasty.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought that the sauce a bit grainy.  Which tells me that real cream is the better way to go.  I also added about 5 more cloves of garlic and two shallots.  My family loves shallots and garlic.  I also, used Oregeno instead of parsley because I was out of parsley.  I liked it a lot.  Next time I will use parsly and real cream.

This is a great recipe. I was really surprised how well the non dairy creamer worked. I made it for my son and he loved it. The only change I made was to put the garlic through a press so that there were no big pieces of garlic.

I made this for my husband's birthday. He LOVED it!! The only change I am going to make next time is to double the sauce.   He took some for lunch the following day and he said it was just as good reheated in the microwave.

My husband and I loved this!  I did use real cream instead of the coffee creamer.  Also, my sauce loving husband wants me to double the sauce next time.  However, I thought it was just right.

Very tasty.  However, please note a little sauce goes a long way.  It's heavier then it looks!

Outstanding, but... Skip the hot water cna coffee creamer, in favor or real cream.  Cook the shrimp, garlic (and onion?) first and reserve.  Cook the cream down a little to thicken and add the cooked shrimp etc. at the last minute, just ro rewarm.  Two more tips:  No rule says this has to be served with linguine!  I often use s thick egg noodle that I like, one subsntial tooth.  Lastly, some turn up their noses when grated parm or romano cheese is adde to shellfish/pasta.  Nuts!  A light sprinkle is good!  Eat it YOUR way (but skip the coffee creamer)

very good. like the fact that there wasn't much fat content but, it didn't taste low fat.  8 year old didn't like it much and she usually likes this stuff.  will make again.  added shallots with garlic.
