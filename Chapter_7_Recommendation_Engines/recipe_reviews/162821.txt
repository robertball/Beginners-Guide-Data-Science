Awesome! I had doubts about this recipe, seriously, but it was amazing, very very good. I think it will be great with some corn added though, going to try this next time. Other wise, don't change a thing! Excellent!

Ok, let me preface this by saying I am not a big salmon fan, but that is why I chose this recipe.  I was hoping that it would lessen the strong taste of salmon, which it did.  The soup was good, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  I think if you added veggies, like celery, carrots, and onions, this would be great!  I also think you need more than just a pinch of the thyme, oregano and basil.  I will definitely try this again but modify some.  Definitely make with crunchy bread!  It makes a world of difference.  For those of you who aren't big salmon fans, try this, it's worth it!

This was a delicious recipe! I dont really like salmon, but know I should be eating it. I will make this recipe again. Changes I made- I didnt have time for a slow cooker, so I boiled the potatoes (and some carrots), cooked fish in olive oil and then creamed them in the blender. Then I added the milk, spices and some corn. My whole family loved it!

A nice place to start, and a great way to use some freezer-burned salmon.  It was okay as written (and that's how I rated it), but really came into its own when I made it with broth instead of water, and added some leeks, garlic, and carrots!  Then we topped each bowl with a squirt of lemon juice.  Yum!  Thanks for the idea of the lemon.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe all day. I'm sorry to say I was very dissapointed. I don't know if I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly. The broth was extremely watery and the potatoes were hard despite leaving the cooker on a few extra hours. I may end up trying this recipe again, but with some modifications.

I made this soup again the other, with a few adjustments, and it was amazing, again!! For all those worried about watery soup, you need much more than a pinch of each herb (think 1 teaspoon) and also about a teaspoon of sea salt. Crusted bread is a must, and adding a can of baby clams can substitute some of the salmon, or just make the soup meatier. So good!

Yes. I liked it. I was running late so I cut the 2 whole potatoes into 4 sections each then i put them on a flat plate and Microwave them for 6:30. I then got my pot of water and added all the ingredients. After the microwave beeped I tossed in my potatoes into the already boiling water I then added my salmon that i cut into 4 pieces then i put 15 minutes timer. After I served. Tasted GOOD my husband said. He said it would taste better with cat fish. So i shall look.

too watery. I added carrots for a little more flavor. I was happy that my kids actually ate it though....

Taste a lot like clam chowder. I added sliced onions. Cooked in dutch oven on stovetop. Used one canned salmon (flaked). Also used lemon pepper in place of lemon zest.
