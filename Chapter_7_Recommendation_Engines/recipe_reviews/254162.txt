After cooking 2 1/2 hours I ran the jam through a chinois to remove the seeds. Then returned the jam to the pot and thickened for 30 minutes. The result is a silky smooth texture. I ended up with a little less than 2 pints of jam. Spooned it over small bite size medallions of polenta for a lovely appetizer.

The Spicy Tomato Jam recipe turned out really well! I added fresh ginger which I peeled and grated finely! The recipe is foolproof and my family absolutely loves  the jam as a condiment on sandwiches, burgers and different roasted meat.

I had a combination of yellow and red tomatoes and thought this jam would be perfect to use up the last of our harvest.  Although this  jam did have a nice balance of sweetness and acidity and was very tasty, not even a hint of spiciness came through.
