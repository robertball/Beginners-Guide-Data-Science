Having lived on Guam for many years I have to give this five stars since Spam recipes take on an all new creativity there.  My family uses the spam and rice for a quick and easy fixer that we can also add extra hot sauce or salsa since we love extra heat.  We also like to drizzle this with finadene. Thank you CYNDMN28  for this one!

This was very easy and quick to make.  It tastes great and smells good when cooking.  I often make a traditional red beans and rice, which is much more labor and time intensive.  This recipe is almost as good, as was so much easier!  I added a few dashes of hot sauce and a can of black beans in addition to the red beans.  Mmmmm!

What can I say..This dish is DELISH!! I thought it was going to be bland but was I wrong! It packed flavor! I did do some minor changes.FIRST I only had 1 can of red beans so I had to cut the measurements down a tad bit..While my rice was cooking (I made my rice in a rice cooker) I minced 3 garlic cloves (I love garlic in my beans) and minced 2Tbs. Of fresh onion. I then only had 1/3 of spam in the fridge..So I chopped it in cubes and browned my spam in a skillet (I like my spam crunchy).. While my spam was starting to cook (about 3-5min).. I added my garlic and onion and lowered the heat to med. I cooked it until my onion and garlic were soft..I then added it to my beans in a pot and added 2 TBS of butter to the pot and cooked it as described in the original recipe..It tasted fantastic! My friend and I polished the whole pot of SPAM/beans off and still wanted more! I think next time for 2 grown people I will use 2 cans of beans..

Made it twice so far and discovered that Black beans with spam taste better than with red kidney because it taste more dry than black beans since they keeps more moisture! Try it with black beans YuM!

This is the perfect fill-you-up meal for a very tight budget. We always use black beans due to personal preference. I have also tried both dried and canned beans. I almost always add an onion (instead of flakes), for the extra flavor. My only reservation on this recipe is the amount of servings. This serves way more than six, unless you plan on eating half a can of beans each.

very easy and very tasty. I took a few others suggestions and added green pepper, garlic and fresh onion, and browned the spam. Also put on hot sauce when served. I have never had spam before but bought 2 cans on a whim, based on this I will buy a few more!

Not bad. We don't usually like SPAM but I tried the recipe for a Hawaiian themed diner and found we liked it. It's easy and cheap to make. We however use black beans instead of kidney beans for our personal preferences.

4 out of 5 stars as submitted.  Very good base recipe.  5 out of 5 stars with the addition of green bell pepper, red onion, garlic, cajun seasoning and a dash of wine vinegar.  Excellent cheap, easy meal.

I made this once before, this is just okay. And remembered it really needed seasonings. Black pepper just doesn't cut it. While a simple quick recipe, it lacks real seasoning depth. After tweaking the recipe I'd make again with my modifications. However, as is, I'm sorry I won't, my apologies.

I appreciate the simplicity of this recipe, and it's OK in a pinch, but the flavor really does need to be punched up a little.  I started with hickory-flavor Spam and fried it in 2 tbsp.  of butter before adding the other ingredients (I didn't use the rest of the butter called for).  After tasting it, I ended up adding some chopped red onion and green pepper, some minced garlic, and a tbsp. or so of Cajun spice, and that helped quite a bit.  I also added some water near the end of cooking time, since it was more dry than I'd like.  Four stars with the added ingredients.

So tasty! I did a few changes though for personal preference. I fried the spam until crispy then added onions and garlic until the onions were done. Then I added the beans and rice and let it simmer 10 minutes

I just made this with a few changes. I cooked 4 cups of rice with my rice cooker. I used 2 cans of black beans (rinsed), 2 cans of kidney beans (with liquid), and 2 cans of of stewed tomatoes. The tomatoes were added after initial cooking as I thought it needed more flavor. Next time I will omit the kidney beans as they were too dry. Overall, I liked this recipe and will make it again.
