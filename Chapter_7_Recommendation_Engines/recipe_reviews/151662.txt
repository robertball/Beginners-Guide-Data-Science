I have been making this recipe forever. I sometimes alternate the mushroom for cream of chicken soup.  I also add garlic, onions and dash to the casserole and cook it at 325 for 2 hours. This chicken can also be served with egg noodles.

YUM!!  I made this last night for my family and it was a big hit with them.  I cut the recipe in half for us 4 but next time I'm going to use the whole can of cream of mushroom soup to make the sauce a little thicker.  This recipe is a keeper.  Another nice thing about it is that it only takes 30 minutes to bake.  It's a quick and easy recipe.

Excellent  !!!!!!!!   I used left over chicken, broccoli and brown rice.
I also used Chicken broth instead of milk.  I also topped it with chedder cheese and Frenches Onion rings.  My family loved it.  I'll definately use it again and even make it for pot luck.

I altered the recipe a little, but it was very good, and I will make it again. I used about 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I pounded out to about .5 inches. (They completely covered the bottom of my 13x9 baking dish.)  I sauteed one large onion and 1 tsp of Christopher Ranch minced garlic in butter and olive oil.  I mixed that with one can of Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup plus the milk that the recipe calls for.  I don't like mushy broccoli, so I took a fresh head of broccoli, peeled the stalks, and cut it into spears.  I put two spears on each chicken breast.  I poured the soup/onion mixture over everything and baked for about 45 minutes.  I turned out perfectly! The broccoli got nice and roasted and wasn't mushy, and the onion mixture plus the herbs in the soup was very flavorful.  The broccoli stalks were still kind of woody, so next time I will just get two broccoli crowns and leave the stalks off.  I would also like to try this with fresh asparagus and red peppers.

My husband and son loved this dish. I used raw cubed chicken breast, mixed frozen vegetables instead of broccoli and egg noodles. I added a little more milk and some sour cream. Delish.

Delicious! I used green beans instead of broccoli, because I'm not too keen on broccoli. My chicken didn't quite bake all the way, we had to microwave it a little. But I'll just bake longer next time. May try with some cheese on top next time, too. I really liked how simple it was to put together.

I love this recipe, you can play with it a lot. It's easy and simple. I always season the chicken to help with the bland taste and I also add seasoning to the cream of mushroom so in the end it tastes delicious and flavorful.  I also use a broccoli medley with cauliflower and carrots to add more color to the dish.

I ended up making myself something else for dinner. the taste is bland, I didn't care for the texture, and i had to cook it an extra 20 min for it to be fully cooked. i will say this, it was quick and easy, and my 19 month old LOVED it. only changes i made was to cube the chicken and the extra cook time was necessary.
