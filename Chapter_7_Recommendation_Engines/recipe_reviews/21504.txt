These are very yummy after a small tweak... I used chicken broth instead of veggie and omitted the salt. I also used 8 slices of bacon, in my opinion 2 wasn't enough.

These were just great!! I used them for chicken and dumplings. My hubby who doesn't like dumplings at all ate 4 of them!!  I did do a little playing with the recipe. I doubled the amount of bacon and instead of parsley I used an italian seasoning blend. I plan on making these at least once a week or so.

I had to add some more milk to the dough.  They came out nicely, but weren't as flavorful as I was hoping.

I expected much more flavor from these. I doubled the bacon & bacon drippings to no avail. I won't make again.

I just made these tonight with homemade turkey vegetable soup and they were scrumptious! This is a great recipe allowing you to play with different flavourings against the bacon.
