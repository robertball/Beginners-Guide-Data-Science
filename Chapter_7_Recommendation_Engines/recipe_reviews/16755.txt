I have also been tweaking this recipe some by adding an extra quarter cup of cornmeal and substituting buttermilk for regular milk - it gives it a cakier appearance and moistens it a little. I can't leave well enough alone. Thanks.

I was looking for a quick, minimal mess recipe to whip up for breakfast on Father's Day.  This recipe just messed up one bowl, baked off beautifully (I made them mini muffins) and were a big hit for our cowboy theme Father's Day for Dad.  The kids loved them and they were moist and sweet.  They popped right out of the muffin pan without any resistance.  I will keep this recipe handy for future use.

WhooEEEE, are these good! I don't eat corn bread or corn muffins often (like maybe twice in my life) but given THESE corn bread muffins I may just be enjoying them more often! I made just half the recipe, but still used 1 whole egg, and reduced the sugar by 2 teaspoons. In a full recipe, this would mean using 2 eggs rather than one, and reducing the sugar by a good tablespoon. To this half recipe I added about 1/2 cup of a 4-cheese Mexican Cheese Blend and a chopped, small jalapeno pepper.  I used a stone ground corn meal, which added great texture, and the extra egg made these deliciously moist. The cheese and jalapeno provided exceptional flavor and added color and interest. So simple to throw together I don't know why anyone would use a boxed mix (especially since I've heard reports of bugs coming along in the box for the ride!) Great recipe Doug! Thanks for sharing!

Oh my! These corn muffins are fabulous and while the title implies "basic" or simple, I have to say they're simply delicious and a great base for whatever whatever add-in suites your tastebuds. Being that this was my first time making these I went the pure route.  I did however use 1 1/4 cup of cornmeal and 3/4 cup of flour, veg. oil (no canola on hand) and subbed buttermilk for the regualr milk.  The result was nothing less than a wonderful, moist muffin that melts in your mouth.  These would be great as a side to BBQ pork, chili, soups, and stews. The leftovers were equally good with butter and jelly in the morning with a cup of tea. Thanks Doug for a wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe exact only cooking it in my cast iron skillet. I did add a couple tablespoons of butter to the skillet and melted it in the hot oven before pouring the batter in. This came out a little dry. Next time, I might add a couple tablespoons of honey and a little more milk.

Delicious!! Not dry at all and not too sweet (as I was afraid it might be). This will be the recipe I use from now on.

Wonderful!  Moist and just the right amount of 'sweet'.  Just as good the next day as hot out of the oven.

These were really good corn muffins, but I did follow a couple of other readers' suggestions: I added 1/4 cup of sour cream, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  Thanks to arlynlovesrecipes for the ideas!  They turned out sweet, like I wanted, and quite moist.  I'm very happy with this recipe.

Although the recipe was easy to follow, I was disappointed with the results.  The muffins did not rise well, and were not very tasty.

Thanks to all the modifications posted in the reviews - these muffins turned out wonderful!

I used:

1 1/4 cup cornmeal
3/4 cup flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup sour cream
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup oil
2 tb butter, melted

I also mixed the wet and the dry ingredients separately before combining the two and baked them in mini muffin tins. 

I then divided the batter into two - one half for 'sweet' and the other 'savory'. To the 'sweet' I simply added almond extract, lemon zest and some blueberries and to the 'savory' I added old cheddar cheese, corn, cracked black pepper, and chilli powder. Both of them turned out great!

I halved the recipe and used a whole egg....came out wonderful! Not too dry, and they didn't crumble, yahoo! I sprayed the pan with oil spray, didn't fiddle with paper muffin cups this time! Thanks for the recipe! I love this recipe! UPDATE: Made the recipe exactly as stated and worked wonderfully again! TIP: Don't overmix. Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes and the lumps will disapear...more tender muffins with a higher rise!

Delicious!  I was looking for a muffin similar to the Jiffy Mix that my husband likes so much...and these were pretty close!  Easy to mix with just the right touch of sweetness, they rose nicely and baked up firm enough to hold together easily when eating.  I'm going to mix up a few batches of the dry ingredients and put them in Zip-Locks to make them easy to whip together at the last minute.  Thanks Doug for sharing!

Awesome Doug! This is my second attempt as the first one ran into some problems. I couldn't resist tweaking it this time and used 1/2 melted bacon grease and 1/2 oil for the 1/4 cup of oil. I only get 9 muffins out of it. Ahhh, so good, fluffy, and moist. No more Jiffy boxes, I'll use this instead.  Thanks!

Very moist and not too sweet.  If fill each muffin cup about 1/2 way, it makes 12 muffins.  I baked for 19-20 minutes. Thanks for the simple and easy recipe.

I give this 4 stars for the 'basic' base.  I made them as written without changing anything as I tend to be a purist and make it like it says first, then go from there. It turned out 'ok', not spectacular, but just ok. I only got 10 muffins out of the batch too and that was a stretch to equally divvy up. The only thing that you could say I did different was to soak the cornmeal in milk for about 10 minutes (I read other recipes stating people had done that), not sure if it made a difference but I would think it would help to soften up the cornmeal so it isn't that 'gritty'.  They are a bland muffin that definitely needs some zing, so next time I am adding jalapenos and jack cheddar to them. I served them with Buffalo Wing Chicken pieces and a caesar salad.  You do need something to help soak into them otherwise your reaching for water because of their dry texture. Thanks for the recipe Doug, will modify future batches. :)

My husband usually disdains corn muffins, but NOT THESE: he even ate them left-over!  To beef up the fiber level, I used a 3-1 mix of whole wheat (insoluble) and all-purpose flour (worthless), and I added 2 tsp of a fiber supplement (soluble).  I also used one of the variations in the comments:  added 1/4 c sour cream, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 c shredded cheese.  OMG these are so very good!  Everyone loves them.  These are definitely a keeper.  And you can't tell they've got fiber!  Whoo hoo!

I followed all the steps but added some taco cheese and chopped up some pickled jalapenos to put in these and they were very yummy. I did a couple with just cheese for the kids and they loved those as well. Thanks for a great corn muffin recipe!!!!

I read the ingredients and thought "this doesn't seem like it's going to make a great muffin". I looked at all the posted photos and I thought "these muffins don't look very good". But 260 people had reviewed the recipe and gave it 5 stars so they must be good. Right? I made them exactly to the recipe with only one exception. I used skim milk. They were not good. Not moist. Not flavorful.  I think they should be called bisquits, not  muffins. They are dense, dry, and with only the slightest sweetness. 1/3 cup of sugar for 12 muffins makes a muffin that can only be called savory. So if you know that going in you won't be surprised. And there's nothing wrong with savory. But if you expect them to taste like a breakfast muffin, I'd double the sugar.

No need to search for a better recipe. Just the right flavor, sweetness (subtle) and texture. No problem with rising...only change was 1 Tablespoon real mayonnaise added with the milk.

Easily the best corn muffins I have ever had! So much better than a boxed mix. I just had 2 hot out of the oven..one with butter and the other with honey and they are amazing. Lovely corn flavour and just enough sugar. So light and fluffy as well. I used a little more cornmeal than a cup and used skim milk but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I should have checked mine after 15 minutes but instead left them for the full 20 and found they were quite brown at the bottom and sides but I like that. My advice would be to check them at 15..

Great recipe, I used vegetable oil, I didn't have canola.  I made 5 jumbo muffins.  They weren't crumbly like cornmeal muffins usually are. They also freeze well.  I will surely make them again.

Really nice, sweet muffin. We had this with the Charbroiled Salmon from this site.  I used 1/2 cup white wheat flour in place of part of the regular white flour.  Makes 12 smallish muffins; would make fewer large ones.  I'm eating the leftovers for breakfast!

I have to bring muffins to my son's thanksgiving party at school this week and decided to give this recipe a try . I followed the instructions very closely. Muffins came out dry and tasteless.  Horrible!

We thought these were perfect. I'm a Jiffy girl, raised on it ;), and have been looking for a recipe that I could use to get away from the box mix. These were just as easy to make and tasted great. Not to sweet, not to dry or moist. So thanks for replacing my box :)

AWESOME and SO EASY to make!  I could not believe how beautifully they baked.  When I peeked in, I was taken by surprise.  I had forgotten to beat the egg first, so I thought I messed up; not so, they couldn't have been more delicious, just the right sweetness and moistness.  This is a real favorite.  Thanks Doug for sharing your AWESOME, EASY recipe!!

Amazing! Perfect basic recipe-- you can fiddle with it all you want, and it always comes out perfectly. I tried it as written-- it was perfect. I then began fiddling: replacing 1/3 of flour with masa harina (corn flour), replacing part of sugar with honey, replacing milk with buttermilk, adding some spices & other ingredients (chopped cooked bacon, diced jalapenos, shredded cheese, etc.), and again-- perfect! Thanks for a new "staple" in my recipe box and on our table. PS-- mini-muffins are the way to go for our family; these took only 15 minutes and were perfect!

I just baked 3 different corn muffin recipes from this website, and these came out the best compared to the other 2 recipes. These muffins have good flavor, rise nicely, and have a nice moist texture inside. However, I find them a touch too sweet, and would like to try making them with less sugar next time.

This was a great recipe because it wasn't overly sweet.  It's just right to go into a bowl of beans or to eat with butter on top or as a lot of my family likes, to crumble up in a glass of milk.

I just made these muffins, they are absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I like the simplicity of them and the healthy ingredients.
I used corn oil, as canola does not exist here, and brown sugar instead
of white. This recipe is a keeper, thanks.

In effort to move away from boxes and packages, this was my first time making corn muffins without the help of Jiffy.  I was making them for breakfast so I added sweet corn kernels, bacon, cheddar, green onion, and pure maple syrup.  Took a lot longer to cook, but I figure it's b/c of the maple syrup and additions.  These are so good that while I was eating, I was wishing I had split the batch and made some with just the corn kernels and some honey.  Thanks Doug!

The second day after making these, I split them in half and "grilled" them on a frying pan with butter. Yum.  There were none left over after that!

These corn muffins were the best I've ever made - just the right amount of sweet but not too much.  I used 1/4 cup of melted butter instead of the canola oil and followed the rest of the recipe to the tee.  Perfect!

I have rated this 5 stars because of its ease of preparing and its very adaptable, i substituted the 1 cup milk for 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup plain yogurt. It added a tanginess to it that my family loved.

I really like these muffins! Simple to make, and the texture is really great -- not too dry or wet. I used applesauce in place of the oil and it turned out just fine. Especially love the crispy crust.

I was amazed at how quick and easy these muffins were to make.  They also tasted great.  I ended up adding frozen corn for extra taste and texture.  Give these a try.

I made 1/2 of the recipe as listed because I only wanted 6 muffins for the 2 of us.  The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup corn kernels.  These were great, not too corn bready/gritty, yet delightfully cakelike in texture.  I will make these over and over again!  I can see where it will be easy to adapt these to different savory flavors...especially southwestern by adding jalapenos and spices.  I don't thing I'll ever buy a cornbread muffin mix again as these are quick, convenient and tasty.

Love them! I only added 2 extra ingredients which were 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I read a previous review and someone mentioned that so I said why not? I had some on hand anyway. Other than that, I only did the steps differently. First I combined the dry ingredients in a bowl. Then I beat the eggs in a separate bowl for a few minutes until frothy with a hand mixer and then mixed in all the rest of the wet ingredients. After, I started adding the dry ingredients. I then used a 1/4 measuring cup to pour the mix into butter greased muffin pans. I didn't have muffin liners on hand but they popped right out when done. They were super fluffy and not dry or dense at all. They are also not too sweet. My dad even mentioned he would have like them a little sweeter! I also topped some with chopped pecans before baking and a drop of honey on each after baking. I will be making these often!

Just brought a lot of peppers back from a trip to Dallas, and one of the things I made for Christmas gifts this year was jalapeño jelly which I planned to gift with corn muffins.  The muffins cooked for 15 minutes, and were not quite as moist as I would have liked, I think a result of overcooking.  Moving forward, I would check them at 12 minutes, could be my oven running hotter than most.  I added chopped red and green jalapeños to the batter which brought a bit of a Holiday theme and color to the muffins.

This is a very good basic recipe. I was out of Jiffy and wanted to make some mexican cornbread and that is what I usually use but not anymore :) Now since I was adding cheese, jalapenos and corn so I changed some things up a bit. I added an extra egg, vegetable oil instead of canola, 2 cups cheddar cheese, one can diced jalapeno peppers (next time I will use whole pickled ones). Most recipies for mexican cornbread call for creamed corn but I just dont like it so I added 3 big spoonfulls of sour cream to make up for the creamed part. I served this with some spicy pinto beans and it was delicious. If I wasnt adding the cheese and stuff I would have only used one egg. These were really easy to make and with ingredients I always have on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! Sure, they're basic in that they have your typical ingredients of a standard corn muffin, but this is super quick and easy and yields great results! My *ONLY* complaint is that it says spray or line the muffin tin... well, I chose to line and I should've sprayed too...so a good chunck of the muffin bases got stuck, darn it! I followed Doug's tip of using buttermilk, only because I ran out of milk and had powdered buttermilk on hand. Light and tender - wonderful with honey and butter!

I followed the recipe exactly except using a little less sugar. Unfortunately they did not rise much (were somewhat small) and turned out very dry. I will probably experiment a little bit, somebody suggested to soak the corn meal in the milk for five minutes, beat the batter for at least 5 minutes to make a fluffier bread, and add 1/4 cup yoghurt for moister consistency. I will update this review after I tried this.

These corn muffins were ok.  I added white kernal corn (approx 1/2 can) and shredded cheddar cheese. My 5 & 2 year olds loved them, but I thought they were a bit bland.  They definitely weren't too sweet, as others have stated.  I may make again, but may continue to look.

These muffins are terrific. I cut the oil to 1/4 c., and they still came out moist. I think that they might not need any oil at all. Thanks Doug!

These were great.  They went perfect with the black bean soup we had tonight.  We made both mini muffins and regular size and the kids liked the big muffins and the adults liked the bite sized mini muffins.  I did not change one thing in the recipe and the muffins were perfect.

These were great my hubby loves corn muffins but i didn't have the mix to make them so i grabbed this recipe. he actually put all the ingrediants together and i baked them- he said no bother wasting money on the store bought mixes, these taste just the same, and this is coming from a corn muffin lover!!!!! great with butter and honey- the only difference i noticed is that they aren't as big but he just ate twice as many as he normally would and thought they were great!! 
this is a keeper

It was very easy to make and reminded me of cornmeal muffins I had once on a trip to New York. As one who loves pastries made of cornmeal this recipe is highly recommended as it is easy and delicious.

This is a great recipe! I made a slight change to the addition of the ingredients based upon past results working with cornmeal. In a 2 cup mixing cup, add the cornmeal to the milk and allow to soak for 5-10 minutes. Add the egg and stir in with a fork. Then add the oil and stir in with same fork. THEN add this to the rest of the dry ingredients. We baked for approximately 21 minutes and then put them under HI broil for 2 minutes to brown up the tops. FLAWLESS!

So hard to find a good cornbread recipe out there that does not have a ton of oil or butter or heavy cream, but this one is a keeper! I used two eggs, instead of one. Turned out very moist, good cornmeal flavor and great texture. Might try 1/4 c. melted butter next time instead of the 1/4 c. of oil.

Thanks for this recipe.  It is great.  I did make a few minor changes.  Used a little less sugar ( I don't like my muffins quite so sweet), 1/2 tbsp baking powder & 1/4 cup of olive oil for baking.  Very good!

This was easy to make and my family enjoyed it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it was nothing special, didn't stand out much, wasn't the best this I've ever tasted. I was doubling the recipe and I accidently put in three eggs instead of two, but didn't notice it. Will save this recipe.

At first, I didn't care for these muffins... then, they cooled down a bit and the edges became crispy and crunchy and the sweetness really came through.  Yum!  I am so pleased they turned out better than what I thought they had!!

It was very good for a simple cornbread, but I decided to tweak it the second time.  I used half drinkable plain yougurt and half milk and I used honey in place of the sugar.  I thought it tasted very good with the extra additions.

This was, by far, THE WORST corn muffin that I have EVER eaten.     Note:  If I could give this NO STARS, I would.  I tried and the website wouldn't let me.  I made these for Thanksgiving, and I'm really glad that no one tried them...we had other things on the menu that tasted so much better.

This recipe is perfect! This is the first time that I didn't think to read reviews to see what needs tweaking, but I'm glad I didn't - it's absolutely perfect as is.  Light, fluffy, and perfectly sweet. No changes needed for this one!

Terrific!  Who needs a mix when you can make it from scratch so easily?  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and served it with maple butter.  Great with beef stew or chili.

If you are serving these as a meal, the sweetness is right on.  If these are for breakfast, I'd suggest increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup or even a bit more.  These are far from spectacular, but are decent.

Very good recipe.  I prefer a larger ratio of cornmeal to flour, so I used 1 1/2 cups cornmeal (stone ground) and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I kept the rest of the ingredients the same and cooked in an iron skillet that I preheated in the oven.  The bread is light and moist with a nice crispy crust.  It's a keeper.

Didn't like it. The flavor was too bland and was missing the buttery flavor that good cornbread has. If you like cornbread then I recommend "grandmother's buttermilk cornbread" recipe which is on this website- it is to die for!

I was looking for a quick and easy corn muffin recipe and this was it!  I made three batches for my office chili cook-off and they were a huge hit.  Not too sweet but not too savory.  I didn't make any changes.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!

Instead of regular milk, I used 8 oz of heavy whipping cream, and I added 1/4 teaspoon of Vanilla extract, and 4 oz of sour cream, and they were wonderful, moist, and just a good treat!

I don't want cupcakes, but these were not sweet or moist enough for me.  Also, this recipe seemed to fill each muffin cup about halfway, and the muffins came out smaller than I was hoping.  If I were to make this recipe again I'd probably make more batter, fill the muffin cups 3/4, and bake longer at a lower temp. along with adding a touch more sugar.

These are wonderful, simple to make muffins.  My whole family ate them up.  I added about 1/2 to 1/3 can whole corn, drained.  I also used about 1/4 sugar + 1/4 cup honey.  They were fantastic.  Will definitely make these again.

My hubby loves cornbread and this was awsome. I added corn and also I used applesauce instead of oil. I did, however make a snafu by not looking at the recipe correctly and added 1 cup of applesauce instead of 1/4 cup. I thought they were ruined but they turned out great. Couldn't taste the applesauce. They did not last. Will definatly make again....Easy to make and versitile!! Thank you for this.

this is by far the fastest and most simple quick bread recipe ever! the muffins were exactly what i was looking for - moist, slightly sweet and a perfect as a snack or starter. i made them even healthier by substituting 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour and using light brown sugar instead of white and they were still fabulous! my only suggestion is to double the recipe because the muffins were teeny tiny.

I no longer purchase pre-made/boxed items and have been on the search for the perfect cornbread muffins.  This recipe worked for me,  although I did make a couple changes.  I halved the recipe, only used 1 tbsp sugar, used 1 whole egg, and used vegetable oil instead of canola.  Thanks for sharing!

These were a hit with my family, I can see them perhaps drying out a little more if not made in paper liners.  Also, my BFF who is an amazing cook said she added 1/4 tsp of Cayenne Pepper. They were amazing this way, sweet with a slight bite.  :-)

Yum!! These are so simple, yet perfectly tasty!  I made the muffins in a mini muffin pan and it only took 10 minutes.  I used the suggestion to add 1/4c corn meal and decrease flour by 1/4c.  They turned out so moist and delicious!!

Great basic recipe! Love adding in green onions and corn when we're in the mood. But when we're in a rush, this alone will do! Not too dry for us at all.

They were good, but not what I was looking for. Very sweet. I´ll try them again with half the sugar.

I give it five stars because it is a great basic recipe and that is precisely what it was posted as. It was easy to add ingredients to make it what i wanted. As is, I would say it would be better served as a texture compliment with savoury dishes or very sweet deserts as it is quite plain to taste. I added vanilla and increased the sugar for a sweet treat and used skim instead of whole milk. I also added a tbsp of vinegar. I usually add vinegar to anything I bake that I want to have a ligter, less glutenous texture.

I have used the recipe for years. You can use a bit more milk to thin it out and cook like a pancake in the sauté pan (non stick or seasoned iron skillet.)

I've made this recipe twice now. Both times I used buttermilk instead of milk and used 1 1/4 c cornmeal to 3/4 c flour, 2 eggs instead of one, and omitted the salt. The first time I took the muffins out 5 minutes early but they were still very dry and tasted slightly oily. I liked the flavor though--not too sweet--so I tried again. The second time I used 6 Tbsp butter in place of the oil and cut it in instead of melting it. I also baked the muffins at 375 instead of 400. That resulted in a much moister muffin without the oily taste.

This is the same recipe I have made forever (my Mother and Grandmother did as well).  Only difference is we use bacon grease (gasp!!) in place of the oil.  Melt about 1/3 cup in a cast iron pan or pyrex dish.  Pour about 1/4 cup into the mix leaving the rest in the pan.  Makes a wonderful crunchy edge on your cornbread.  May not be as healthy as using canola oil but worth the risk!!!

I made this recipe and was surprised at how delicious it was.  I used evaporated milk and whole wheat flour.  The batter was a little dry so I added more water until I got it just right.  I baked it and made sure I did not over cook to avoid dryness.  Even with whole wheat flour they rose up nicely and tasted great!!.  I then cut them open and put smart balance buttery spread in them while hot.  They were delicious.  Thanks a lot, will use this recipe every time.

It's not a recipe for a sweet tooth, but they definitely hit the spot. Besides, that's what honey is for =) I love how fast it was to whip them up and have them in the oven in under the time it took for the oven to preheat.

Not too dry but not too soggy. I only used a quarter cup sugar and added coconut. Also, for half I added hot sauce for a kick.

I added diced jalapeno and replaced the sugar with Splenda and honey to make them more diabetic-friendly. I also tucked some barbecue pulled pork into the center of the batter before baking. The muffins themselves were very good (although I might use buttermilk instead of regular milk next time) and they paired nicely with the pork.

Thanks for the recipe. I stuck to the basic one. They look just like the picture. They are not very 'corny'. I might add more corn meal or a can of creamed corn next time. But most importantly, my teenagers love them so what else matters?

Yummy!! I love corn bread and this recipe makes a nice moist muffin. I however, do not like mine real sweet so I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and used brown sugar.  This is definately going in my recipe box.

I find the simple basic recipe for corn bread is the best! Loved it!
Nice crisp, light, not a worry to my diet, but I could a smear of butter to it while it's warm, savory and is great to serve with chili, or greens with bacon. Thanks!

Yummm! This recipe is so easy and fast! It was ready by the time I thawed and warmed up my pre-made, frozen butternut squash soup. I love how it's more salty than sweet - unlike many of the recipes listed.  I also like the portability of it being muffin-ized. Lol - new word! I might try using even less sugar next time and throwing in bits of corn and chopped jalapeno.

Just made these and they are really easy, very good corn taste. I added 3/4 cup fresh corn and used buttermilk. These will be made again (maybe even today). Great base for adding things like bacon, cheese or jalepenos. Mmmm very tasty!

Making a decent corn bread or corn muffin has somehow escaped me all these years…..until now!  I made this recipe as written but I did add a little leftover corn and a small 2 oz. jar of well-drained chopped pimentos for a little color.  I have finally found a recipe for corn muffins that has the perfect amount of sweetness to it.  For us this was just right!  Thank you Doug; my search has ended!

Good basic recipe for sure...however could have used a little more sugar. Dressed up with honey butter and they were better. It made exactly 12 muffins so the portions are right on. Next time I will use cooking spray on the paper muffin cups, as they tended to stick.

These turned out great. Used a few of other's suggestions, used 2/3 cup milk + sour cream to 1 cup, 2 eggs, a little extra baking powder, marg instead of oil, brown sugar/honey for sugar & added a little grated cheese. Made 12 muffins, they rose and were moist & yummy with chili, thanks!

Jan 2011- a bit too sweet - add salt, reduce sugar, add pepper (cayenne)made w/ extra eggwhite - same flour and cornmeal. added smoked cheddar and soured the milk with lemon juice. added 1/4 chopped indian chili. GOOD - 7/10: NEXT TIME REDUCE SUGAR, INCREASE SALT, ADD SOME CHILI PEPPERS OR CAYENNE. CHEESE WAS A NONFACTOR

The reason I picked this recipe was that the ingredients are ones that I always have around the house. I made these to go along with a huge pot of chili, and they were eaten right up. The perfect amount of sweetness.

Great basic recipe, which I jazzed up by adding 1/2 cup shredded monterey jack cheese and 1 large jalapeno, finely chopped (sort of a "Mexican" corn muffin, if you will).  The cheese really moistened the muffin and the jalapeno adds a nice kick to every bite.  My only complaint is that I only got 10 muffins out of the recipe, which I thought was odd.  Next time I'll add a little more cornmeal and flour to try to stretch the recipe.  Otherwise very good!

I give these muffins 5 stars based on the simplicity of the recipe and the taste.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and I have used sour cream with great success.  I also bake at 375 and my muffins are usually moist with great flavor.  I make these often and the recipe has earned a permanent place in my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing.

The perfect amount for 24 mini-muffins! I added 1/2 cup frozen corn. It makes a nice texture and flavor, if you like that sort of thing. The muffins are great served with honey butter.

Just made these on the spur of the moment, when I figuredout that I could only get 1/2 dozen out of my boxed corn muffin mix.  They were very easy to throw together with common baking ingredients.  They were light and fluffy, but also very moist, not dry at all.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

A classic muffin!  I added a teaspoon of allspice to give them a Jamaican twist.  Huge hit with my 6th Grade Sunday School kids.  Thank you for providing a replacement for the recipe I lost.

I thought this recipe was great.  I had never made corn muffins before and I thought they turned out great.  My only mistake was I didn't know there are different kinds of corn meal, and I bought medium grind so it was a little gritty.  I added cheddar cheese, some onions, and sliced up weiners.  The kids loved them.

Excellent recipe! Since I live at a high altitude, I reduced the amount of bak. pdr. to 1 1/2 tsp. Also, reduced flour by 2 TBS and used spelt flour instead of whole wheat, a much better-tasting flour and lighter in texture.  Kept cornmeal at 1 cup. Sifted flours into beaten batter. This makes for a much lighter muffin and delicate crumb. Used butter in place of oil.  Also, can use melted coconut oil which is wonderful and a medium chain triglyceride so it's very heart and skin healthy. Don't believe what you hear about coconut and palm oils. They're NOT bad fats. This is propaganda from oil manufacturers. Used buttermilk in place of milk. Will use brown and white sugar next time as white sugar is a bit bland. When done, I split muffin and toast a bit in toaster oven and spread w/Earth Balance and agave (like honey), but great for diabetics and hypoglycemia. Batter only made 7 muffins (filled 3/4 full).  Will double next time as they're almost gone after 10 mins.

An Excellent Corn muffin/bread recipe. Made this in a baking dish and served as corn bread instead of muffins. May have added a tad more sugar than recipe called for.  Thanks for this one.

This recipe was very good, I agree that using buttermilk would probably be best. I used the mini muffin tin, and dropped a blueberry or two in, I only wish that I had a lemon to zest, to add a little more flavor.

These were good...  Dry, but I think that might be my fault for using soy milk instead of regular milk -but for those of you who don't want dairy, the soy milk was ok, maybe just add a bit more than a cup?

Very good.  I usually use buttermilk in place of regular milk and add 1/4 cup more cornmeal.  Great if you add cheese the muffins too.

Decided that I wanted to make some corn muffins for a change, my hubby always orders them at a certain restaurant. These are sooooo good, I don't think I will make tea biscuits again, and these are so quick and easy to make. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and glad I never, delish !!!

This recipe is so understated that it would be easy to pass it by - a big mistake!  I used a little less sugar and the end result was a perfectly balanced cornbread.  Not too sweet, not too cakey.  Made 6 mini-loaves instead of muffins, and they were moist after heating in the microwave three days later.  This is a very quick to make recipe.

They were fine, I don't have much to compare to since I don't think I ever had cornbread before. I made them because my husband was craving some. He said they were good. I found that they were a bit dry, but that could have been because of my oven, it tends to over cook certain things.

These were extremly easy to make, but they turned out somewhat hard and really DRY!!  Disappointed with them.  I had read the reviews, and only changed 1 thing...not adding so much sugar, used 1/2 cup (I doubled the recipe-made 16 mini-loaves).  I just went way back into the reviews, and I think I'll try them again, but using the buttermilk that Dave had suggested.  Keep you posted!!

These are very basic, very good muffins.  They are more moist than your average cornbread, and the ingredient listing is so simple you'll have it memorized in no time.

FANTASTIC!!! I used to make the Jiffy muffins with my chili and have now switched to these. The Jiffy mix is not available in Canada anymore so I would have to stock up when I went to the States. These are so much better. Now I can save my Jiffy muffin mix for my corn casseroles. Might even try this recipe in it hmmmmmmmmm.

The best part of any recipe is it's simplicity and this one is super simple . . . as a matter of fact, I had mixed the batter before the oven had finished pre-heating.

For a low fat alternative, I used low fat margarine melted in place of the oil, and the muffins were soft and tasty.  I'd make these every night if I could!

I made these dairy-free by switching the milk for coconut milk and they turned out great. I froze some and they tasted just as good later after I warmed them up again. They turned out slightly sweet and moist. It was a great recipe and I plan on making then again.

Easy easy!  Perfect basic corn muffin...only took about 13 minutes in my oven. Rose nicely and didn't deflate after cooling.  Made to go with chili...got many compliments they were moist.  Great with a slab of butter??

I wanted corn bread muffins to go with my homemade chili and almost bought the Jiffy mix. When I realized Jiffy had a lot of preservatives and this recipe looked just as easy as the box mix! It took me less than 10 minutes to make the batter. I followed the recipe exactly and used whole milk. I also added whole corn kernels. They turned out great and weren't dry at all! I highly recommend this recipe :) oh also do NOT use muffin liners (at least not the cheap paper-y ones) because the muffin sticks to the paper and it's a mess. Just grease the pan!

I made the cornmeal muffins per recipe.  The batter was wet so I figured it would give me nice moist muffins which it did.  The secret is to not over mix.  I baked them for 15 minutes at 400 and they came out moist and delicious.  I ate one warm with my lunch salad.  I would make them again as the recipe is easy and uses only one bowl.

I just made these and, like other reviewers, I adjusted the corn meal to 1 1/4 cups and flour to 3/4 cups because I like the corn flavor to resonate.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they were WONDERFUL.  I will make these a lot!

I followed the recipe with one exception, as I added some grated sharp cheddar when filling the cups in the cupcake pan. Muffins were very good and were devoured very quickly. Would recommend making!

Love corn muffins, and these are fantastic! Easy to make & i'm an awkward baker. Found they were a little better poured into the muffin tin without the paper cups. And followed the advice of several and increased the corn meal to 1 !/4-- made them much more corny-gritty (which I like). Skim milk works well, too, and I can't believe there's no butter in the recipe! Just a really great easy recipe--!!!

I have always disliked corn bread/muffins but made these for my husband. I am gluten free so I used cup4cup gf flour, 2 eggs instead of 1, and added cheddar cheese and chopped pickled jalapeño.  I tried one and it was SOOO good I'm making more today. I may try coconut oil and buttermilk this time....so adaptable....mmmmm

I made these as a side for some chicken chili, and they were great. I used home ground cornmeal which turned out more like a corn flour. I decided to add an extra egg and used about 1/8 cup more than a cup of nut milk instead. I mixed the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately and then together. I did give some good stirs to the batter because I wanted some of the gluten to form from the all-purpose flour. Perfect at around 18 minutes. They were more cakey which was more than ok with us! I limited my son to 3 and my daughter to 2. Hubby decided to keep eating them-some with honey drizzled over the top. I will see if I can make this as a mix and just add the wet ingredients to it later. Much better ingredients than store-bought!

Great basic corn muffin!  Made these several times, with various add-ins or changes, but my favorite is to use the submitter's review and add an additional 1/4 of cornmeal and use buttermilk.  Does't get much better than that!

I followed another cooks suggestions.  Excellent!  I added the sour cream, vanilla, brown sugar and a bit of honey, plus the shredded cheese.  I initially thought this is going to be gross, but I have been at a loss for the perfect cornbread!  With these additions and I cooked it in a preheated buttered cast iron skillet, #8, this will be the only recipe I ever use.  I'm deleting all others!  I just had a piece this morning, and it's still delicious and moist.  I just put some honey on it, (it was for breakfast, needed sugar), I couldn't even wait to heat it up!  I would give it more stars if I could!

I made this tonight and took some of the instructions indicated. I added 2 eggs, and mixed 2/3 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk, and cut the sugar to 2/3 cup. It was very moist and fluffy with a golden crust on the top. Delicious!!

These are moist, flavorful, and easy corn muffins that use ingredients I already have on hand. We enjoyed them with chili and pork chops, and they reheated wonderfully after being frozen. This is definitely a recipe to keep!

I really like this recipe I have made it twice ,once fallowing the recipe and I like how easy and nice and fluffy they were.  the next time making them gluten free using rice flower, doubling the baking powder and egg and adding a 1/2 cup of corn starch.   That were very crumbly and not as sweet as I would have liked, but I can fix that with a honey glaze, thought is was fantastic to be able to convert this to gluten free ( just a side note if switching to gluten free check you baking powder some have wheat starch in then)

I used to get corn muffins all the time in NJ, but they just don't have them here in AZ. Buttered and toasted on a griddle until singed, almost burnt. Orher recipes I've tried were too dry...or too greasy....these are PERFECT! And I didn't change a thing!

I have made this recipe many times. Occasionally I stir in a drained can of whole corn or mix a can of chopped green chili. I find it very interesting that a few reviewers complain of dry and crumbly muffins. Have they not given thought that over cooking in a 400 degree oven has very drying effects?  The recipe states 15 to 20 minutes not Oh darn I forgot I forgot to set the timer.  I have never had dry muffins. BTW I add 1 1/2 cups corn meal to 1/2 cup flour and 1 cup of buttermilk made from milk and vinegar.   From Sniggibb in Las Vegas

Very tasty. I took the advice of another reviewer and added an extra egg, corn, chopped jalapeno's and Mexican blend shredded cheese (about a heaping 1/2 cup. I also used white cornmeal but I'm sure they would be just as tasty with yellow. Next time I want to try buttermilk instead of milk.  I have also used Martha White Buttermilk cornmeal mix in the past and it turned out really good just don't add the baking powder.  Thanks for sharing.

I had no eggs on hand! But I had already started this recipe thinking I had some. People in my house like eggs.  So, to add moisture I used half and half and added about 3/4 cup grated cheddar cheese.  Oh, also I used coconut oil instead of canola because canola is GMO. It turns out, you can do without eggs.  Recipe was good without it!  I also used my cast iron skillet, which was just fine. It wasn't a fluffy type of corn muffin, but the taste was really good.  Everyone liked it.  Next time I will add corn that I ran thru the blender for a few seconds to add texture.

Definitely a good, reliable recipe! I halved it, to make a half dozen, and still used one egg, so I think they turned out a little cakier than they should have. I imagine if they were a little bit denser and moister they would have been even better!

Delicious!! Upped the sugar to 1/2 cup but left everything else the same. The only problem was the baking time...after 11 minutes at 400F they were already browning!

Wow! Threw these corn muffins together as a last minute side dish with my Beerly Barbecue Ribs! The corn muffins are delicious, not dry and not very sweet. The only substitution I made was Splenda for the sugar. They will make a yummy breakfast tomorrow with jam. I will definitely make these muffins again.

It came out great. Followed the directions exactly minus the sugar. Didn't want the sweet taste.  Only thing I think I'll change is lessen the flour and make up with the cornmeal.  It rose great and was moist not dry. Let the batter sit a few minutes..helps it to rise.  Thank you I will be using this recipe again.

Terrible. It was my first attempt at corn muffins, but I followed the directions. No texture, no taste, hard, dry. Cornbread really should have more than 1:1 ratio of cornmeal:flour.

I made this recipe with one substitution, almond milk for milk. The muffins came out fluffy and tasty, with a bit of sweetness, and they don't crumble like other corn muffins will.  A tad on the dry side, but when served with pat of butter they are just great.

I'm so confused!  I was excited to find a "basic" recipe that I could jazz up myself...I added minced jalapeno, shredded zuchini, diced roasted red peppers, chives, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, and grated extra-old cheddar....they looked and smelled amazing, and then I took a bite....and they were BLAND!  I have no idea how this happened...the only thing I can think of is that they need WAY more salt.  Sigh...it's like a bad prank that I added so much flavour and they seemed to magically make it disappear.  Maybe next time...this recipe is a good base in that they had a good texture and consistency...thanks anyway.

Vey Easy and a perfect "corn muffin" I did as another reader suggested and checked mine at 15 minutes and they were done. The only chnage I made was using olive oil because it was the only oil on hand. You could esily add other ingreients to make these 'corn, jalepeno, cheese muffins or sweet corn muffins' Thanks!! Will use again and again!

Thank you! These are simple and dee-licious! I made mimi muffins. A few minutes less in the oven and perfect. They have the slightly crunchy, sweet corn taste I remember as a kid-that Always looking for the simple approach and I'm expressing gratitude for finally finding an exceptional recipe for corn meal muffins that takes few ingredients and minimal time. Of course I used Organic Farmer ground corn meal. I did not tweak this recipe.

These corn muffins were a bit too dry for our tastes, I see that some reviewers added an extra egg and that might be just what it needs. I would go with a bit more salt as well. This recipe gave me 12 very pretty muffins.

This is an excellent base recipe. Upon measuring out my cornmeal, I realized I only had half a cup, so I filled out the rest of it with a little less than a quarter cup of farina (uncooked) and a little less than a quarter cup of rice flour, and then the reminder of the cup with a few tablespoons of brown sugar (then lessened the white sugar just a tiny bit later on in the to balance it out). Also added blueberries. This was my first time making this recipe and the muffins came out delicious! And this coming from someone who not only bakes a lot but is also very picky about her corn muffins lol. By the way, I buttered AND sprayed Pam on the muffin tins, just to be on the super safe side, the muffins popped right out and were perfectly golden :)

I made 1/2 of a recipe for the two of us and we thought they were very good.  I substituted melted Smart Balance for the oil, but otherwise used the recipe as given. Another reviewer suggested using buttermilk in place of the milk, so will try that next time.

Great Muffins. Easy.  We made them in the regular muffin pans, but had more left over, so we made the rest in the Redi-Set-Go for 7 minutes each.  Worked like a charm.  Will use this recipe again.

Pretty good. Basic, as the title says. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup because I planned on serving honey butter with these (2-3 tablespoons of butter mixed with 1-2 teaspoons of honey). I also upped the amount of corn meal to 1 and 1/4 cups total.

This is a good base recipe. You could omit the sugar and add cheddar and jalapenos. Or, you could substitute honey for the sugar. 

This recipe made about 30 mini-muffins. Baked at 12 minutes total. 

Also, next time I will butter the pan instead of using PAM. Butter gives the small muffins a better flavor in the end.

I didn't have any butter in the house. I didn't have buttermilk. I didn't have self-rising cornmeal (never even heard of it! Guess I'm not southern...).  But the ingredients for this recipe were all right in my pantry and the results got raves. A keeper for sure!

I just made these for the first time. We don't really do corm muffins in South Africa (surprising, since white maize meal is the staple food). I halved it but used a whole egg as suggested by one reviewer. I dressed them up with cherry tomatoes, spring onions and a garlic-and-herb seasoning. To make it savoury I would decreased the amount of sugar next time. But otherwise they came out light, moist and delicious!

We have made this recipe several times at home now, and the corn bread muffins have turned out beautifully every time!.  The only change we made was to leave out the sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this before and it's a nice, basic recipe without all the extra junk.  However, this time I made this recipe with 1/2 dense cornmeal and 1/2 soft meal.  I'm also playing with making recipes more healthy so I used stevia and honey instead of sugar and 1/2 wheat, 1/2 all-purpose flour.  The kids loved them and so did I.  A nice, healthier alternative.

My first time making cornbread and both my 7 year old and I felt they were as good as the cornbread muffins at a local (famous) restaurant.  He ate three at dinner alone.

First time making corn muffins & I am very pleased. The only change I made was I used buttermilk in place of regular milk. I love that the recipe calls for enough cornmeal, I love the pieces of cornmeal. I may add a tiny bit more sugar next time, but so yummy as is. I toasted it this morning & put a little butter & jelly on it, it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. First batch came out a bit dry, so I added an extra egg. Really good flavor, definitely a keeper.

So easy to make!! I made mine a bit healthier by using applesauce rather than oil, half whole wheat flour and adding 3 tbsp. of flax seed. Great recipe!

Good recipe, but -- change the milk to buttermilk and add 1/2tsp baking soda; leave out the sugar; and bake in a hot, well-greased iron skillet; and you have Grandma's good, old-fashioned cornbread. Goes great with bean soup, or with a cold glass of buttermilk.

The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter in place of the oil. My batch was golden in just under 15 minutes, with a perfect texture and not too sweet. I plan to serve them this weekend with Laura's Quick Slowcooker Turkey Chili. Thanks for the great recipe!

Quick and easy.  I substituted extra virgin coconut oil for the canola oil, and instead of 2 tsp baking powder I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda  and 1 tsp of cream of tartar. Muffins came out light and fluffy and they taste really good.

Yummy! Perfect for breakfast. I made 24 mini muffins with this recipe. Tastes amazing. I used rice milk instead of dairy milk because that's what I had in the fridge at the moment. I baked them for 18 minutes and came out perfect. Next time I'm going to use 1/2 cup of sugar because I like them sweeter.

I was in a hurry and needed a quick, easy alternative to the recipe I usually make (that is Absolute Mexican Cornbread). This one was a snap to whip up and is a good basic recipe. I baked these for 15 minutes and they were just right, so be careful not to overcook. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion about adding another egg and some cheese. I am sure that this helped it immensely. Even with the cheese and a little extra cooking oil I added, they were still a tad on the dry side. I will make this recipe again, but I will add a little extra liquid or some sour cream. Thanks for sharing the recipe. It is good, but it would be even better with the extra egg and a little more oil, milk, or butter.

I live in Germany and accidentally bought corn flour (I think), which made the texture not exactly the same, but they still tasted great!  I'm sure I will make them again.  I reduced the sugar, but I usually do that in recipes.

I made mini muffins out of this recipe because I have a 10 month old who loves to feed herself. (on a side note,I only baked them for 10 mins) They were the perfect consistency for corn muffins, not too wet, not too dry. And I even have leftovers that will be wonderful in my homemade cornbread and sausage stuffing for dinner tonight!!

Mmmm, so good! It was my first time baking corn muffins, and I decided to try half basic muffins just as recipe directs and half with Cheddar cheese, jalapeno and red pepper. So I added about 1/2cup of cheese, 1 chopped jalapeno and about the same amount of chopped red pepper. I also reduced amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. Perfect!!! It took 20 min in my oven. and colors of peppers remained bright, so it looks great and tastes yummy... I just had fun to eat and take pix of them.

Followed the recipe exactly. Looked okay, but not at all flavorful. Very disappointing.

i have looked for two yrs. for a great corn muffin recipe and this is most def. it!  i did add about 3/4 c. of frozen corn, 3 T chopped jalapenos, and about 3/4 c. shredded cheddar cheese.   baked them @ 375 for about 12 mins. and they were golden colored and soooo delicious.  my husband ate 4 of them at dinner.  i did make one and 1/2 of the recipe and got 18 muffins.  the best part is they aren't too sweet.
thank you.

Easy, but after I made them as written they came out somewhat crunchy.  I think next time I'll try a different recipe.

YUMMY!  I substituted tulip poplar honey for the sugar, I used walnut oil instead of canola, and oat milk (I'm avoiding dairy) for the milk.  Moist and very tasty.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated (substituting soy milk for regular milk) and they turned out well.  Not the best cornbread I've ever had, but good and they were quick - 15 minutes in the oven was enough (checked with a toothpick).  I plan to make these again.

Very good recipe. I did as one reviewer suggested and added an extra egg. I also added a chopped jalapeno and about 4oz. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. They definitely had a bite to them! (sidenote: the kids wouldn't touch them because they had "green things" in them)

This was an easy recipe. Not my favorite but it was good. Good texture and not too sweet. It made exactly 10 muffins and I baked them  for 15 minutes. Thanks for the recipe, I will be using it again.

I found these muffins to be very bland. The butter I put on them was the only thing that made them edible. Very disappointed. I was craving corn muffins.

This is a fantastic recipe. When I first tried it though the corn muffins were pretty tiny in my standard pan so I increased the yield to nine muffins worth of batter (using one whole egg) for a six muffin pan, the results were perfect, not a drop of overflow. I also added cinnamon, vanilla and occasionally substituted vanilla soymilk for the milk, delicious!

These are extremely good! I don't know how people can say they are not moist and tasty. They are very moist and very tasty! I made 2 batches, the first adding nothing extra and the second adding cheese, minced green peppers and corn. Both were wonderful, even hubby ate them and he usually won't eat corn bread. So that's something right there :)
You can add so many things to this recipe, it is definatly a keeper @ our house! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

just a little sweet cos i put a slice of sausage in the middle to make breakfast muffin, but if you were to have sweet corn muffin these are fabooooolous haha

try subbing 1/4 cup of milk with sour cream tho it'll come out a little moister and "stickier" (in a good way hee)
oh and i'll definitely try omitting the white sugar totally and put in a tbsp of brown sugar to make my breakfast muffin

great recipe tho!! thanks a lot!!! :-)

This was my first cornbread recipe, and I thought it turned out quite good!  I used the reviewers tips (added 1/4 c sour cream, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 Tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 c shredded cheese).  I like sweet cornbread, and the taste was almost perfect for me!  The only change would be to omit or decrease the vanilla, as it ended up smelling and tasting a bit more like a cake vs. cornbread.  I also added 1/4 cup corn kernels.  Will definitely make this one again!

Very good muffins, especially while still warm.  I made these with soy milk, because #1 son is lactose intolerant.  They still came out great.  I had to cook them a little longer though because I used a large muffin pan, so I only got 6 muffins.  I'll double the recipe next time.

AWESOME! I made a batch of MINI muffins for my daughters Thanksgiving party at school. They were a hit! I added more sugar (I like sweet corn muffins) and I added about 3/4 C. sour cream. They are definetely a keeper!

These muffins were a little on the bland side, and there wasn't much flavor to them--not bad, but I had to add a lot of butter and honey while eating it.

My husband said this was better than his mom's cornbread.  I added a splash of vanilla just to try, definitely will keep it in the recipe!  I reduced the cooking time to 13 mins, and they came out perfect!

Delicious!  I usually mix up a box of Jiffy because that is our favorite.  I didn't have any so I looked this recipe up, it was perfect.  The perfect amount of sweetness.  I will make this every time I want corn muffins.

Sauteed 1/4 cup of chopped onion with 2 chopped Jalapenos in a little oil and added to the batter.  Substitute 1/2 cup dry white wine for 1/2 cup of milk.  I am going try it with steamed broccoli florets and cubed ham to make a meal in a muffin.

I will never buy mix again.  What a wonderful, simple, delicious recipe.  I will definitely be trying variations on this (adding corn, jalepenos, etc).  Thanks SO much!

These were good basic corn muffins--a tiny bit oily, but moist and pretty light. I like corn muffins a little bit more dense.  The flavor was good though--not too sweet, but just sweet enough.  I like blueberries in my corn muffins, so I added a cup of frozen wild blueberries. They were tasty.  Nothing to rave about, but they were good and something I'd probably make again..

I used spelt flour and sucanat instead of white sugar, and they came out nice and moist.  I used 1/4c instead of 1/3c of sugar. Great with butter and raspberry jam!  Thanks, Doug!

well, i was out of flour, so i just used regular oatmeal (not quick cooking) and just a bit of bisquick.  less sugar and added some honey. it turned out to be better than i thought considering i used ragular oatmeal instead of flour. more fiber!

Finally a recipe for something basic without adding all the extras. I think these were great the way they were without adding everything in the refridgerator to them. There hsould be more people entering in recipes for basic things that others may not know how to make.

These were great! Soft inside, crunchy outside. The only thing i would change was adding more cornmeal. And double the recipe cause i came out with 8 on this one. I will make this again.

I made exactly as the recipe called for, and very happy with the results.
Rather than muffins, did this as a corn bread baked in a glass baking dish.
This will be a go-to recipe!

If you’re looking for a sweet and moist corn muffin, then this isn’t the recipe for you. I made it as stated but added a tablespoon of honey. They were just slightly on the dry side and a little bland. Nothing special. If you don’t like sweet muffins like, say, Famous Dave’s then these are decent. Personally, I need more flavor.

I was looking for a basic corn bread recipe and decided to try this one. I had to substitute a few ingredients since I didn’t have everything listed in the recipe. I exchanged gluten-free flour for the all-purpose, used Sweve (sugar substitute) in place of the white sugar, coconut for the oil and coconut milk. The batter was very thick and I worried how they would turn out once cooked. I cooked the muffins for 15 minutes and they came out perfect. They had a nice moist cake texture in the middle, with a crisp top, but not too dry. A definite keeper!

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used stone ground cornmeal and reduced the sugar just slightly by maybe a tablespoon or two. I added an extra egg and 1 cup of Tex Mex shredded cheese.  My picky 6 yr old ate one while still warm and came back asking for seconds. I love these muffins, delicate flavour, delicious and perfect to add to a brunch.

Based on reviews I tweaked my recipe a bit - used 1.25 cups of corn meal and 3/4 cup of flour, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tap baking soda and 1 tap baking powder. I omitted the salt and replaced the cup of milk with 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup water. I also added in frozen blueberries. The muffins were a bit dry but not terribly so. Next time I would add even more blueberries and maybe some chocolate chips.

Used this as a base recipe for some corn muffins I made to get rid of veggies I had lying around that needed to be used. The muffins themselves turned out beautifully fluffy inside with a nice crisp outside. For my version, I added a few small poblano peppers and corn cut off the cob that I'd sauteed in butter with paprika and a wild amount of black pepper, along with some locally made asiago-like cheese. They came out wonderfully and I have this base recipe to thank!

I like my corn muffins sweet and moist and this recipe was neither, it needs more sugar and more oil or shortening...definitely fell short from what I was looking for,  but if you like your corn muffins only slightly sweet and don't mind them being  dry sort of like cracker barrel's then this recipe if for you. It's really personal taste when it comes to these.

These came out great! Made as is, it's just the right amount of sweetness (and I don't like too sweet) with a good, dense cake-like texture, how you'd expect a corn muffin to be. I used Jillian's suggestion of 1 1/4 cups cornmeal and 3/4 cup flour. For the milk, I used the dry buttermilk blend that you add water to. I made these into six jumbo muffins that were ready at about 16 min. I couldn't resist having one (half!) right out of the oven....delicious with a little butter spread. Will be good for breakfast. I would try adding shredded cheese or pickled jalapenos another time, but these are great as they are! Easy recipe, too. Thanks!

Good for a basic recipe.  Added butter and honey on top to sweeten it.
Next time I'm going to add cream corn for a bit of texture.

I made 6 dozen of these for a chili feed. They are easy and delicious. I would recommend letting the batter rest for a few minutes to give the baking soda time to activate and rise. Last muffins were almost twice the size.

I made these exactly as the recipe is written, no changes at all. The recipe made only 11 full muffins and about a 1/3 of a muffin, didn't get the full dozen. They were absolutely delicious, moist, flavorful and yes I will make these again. This will become my go to recipe for cornmeal muffins, I think next time I am going to add a little more flour and cornmeal and see if that produces the dozen.

Good basic recipe although I agree with other raters that they came out pretty dry and hard (which is fine since I'm eating them with soup). Maybe add an extra egg if you want them softer. Also I added shredded Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper which gave it great flavor!

Great! Extremely moist and as a southerner myself, this was very authentic! I replaced the milk with buttermilk and added 1/4 cup of cornmeal as was suggested in the comments, and this came out very high quality!

Been making this daily for the last week and it goes fast; it's quick, simple and delicious. I lowered the sugar to 2 teaspoons and make it in an 8x8 pan instead of muffins, baked at 400F for 18 mins. I'm now working on variations with cheddar and onions.

Great corn muffins. Simple and easy to make. I add one finely chopped jalapeno, and substitute canola oil for melted butter or leaf lard (canola is the devil, and should never be used for anything). I also use only 1/4 cup of sugar, and top them with cheddar cheese. They go great with your best chili! Yum!

I've tried nearly all the corn bread recipes here and this is my favorite. I made a double batch this time and ended up with a little extra, so I made a pancake with it, and wow!! This is a dual-purpose recipe! I'll use it for cornbread flapjacks in the future!

It was sweet enough without being too sweet. It had that wonderful cornmeal grit and they puffed up to a lovely convex top. I added jalapeños to half of them. That was great too. I served 3 dozen of them with chili to a group of 11 and they were all gone!

I made it exactly as specified. In fact, my kids liked them so much tonight that I made a second batch so they'd have some to take for lunch tomorrow. They're not too dry and have just a bit of sweetness with out being too much.

Now that I have the basic recipe tested, I'll play around with adding corn kernels and other additions.

This is my favorite corn muffin recipe. I use Sugar in the Raw instead and also tried it with apples and cinnamon. Simply delicious and consistent.

I think this recipe could be better. I made it per recipe but added some honey and 1/4 cup less sugar. They came out dry and more cake like. I would use buttermilk if I made this again and either butter or vegetable oil for the canola oil.

Substituted buttermilk instead of regular milk. These cornbread muffins are not too sweet and have a subtle taste.

Not a traditional cornbread style. Very cakey and quite bland. I can see how it would "lend itself to modification" well, but I personally did not enjoy this recipe at all.

I baked it about 5–10 minutes longer than the recipe says.  Don’t use paper liners unless you want to lose half the muffin. Use aluminum or splurge on the reusable rubber ones.

I've made these a few times. They are quite simple to whip up, which is refreshing, because sometimes, you just don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen (sometimes). They never come out dry and they have just the perfect amount of sweetness to them. They never last in my house.

My daughters loved it. They had two each. I wanted something like the muffins from coffee time so for me it was missing something, but was still good. I added 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3. I wanted something sweet. Will definitely make them again.

This is a really nice sweet cornbread muffin. They rise nicely and turn golden brown. Be careful not to overcook, as with anything made with cornmeal, its becomes dry and crumbly very easily. I would reduce the amount of sugar just a little, so it's less dessert-like.

The original recipe was very easy to follow. But these are BASIC. Ive never made corn muffins before so i gave it a try but i also modified to add some flavor. I added a top of vanilla, and a handful of mozzarella cheese into the mix. I baked for 12 mins and they came out fluffy not very sweet and with stretchy cheese baked in. The muffins taste like basic bread corn muffins and i think the cheese gives it a nice splash of flavor.

Definitely don’t use paper liners unless you spray with Pam! I greased each cup with bacon grease; substituted buttermilk for milk, added an extra egg, and reduced the cooking time and oven temp: 385 for 18 minutes. We have an older oven— hence the trial and error temp and time! Great recipe and fun to tweek with minor changes.

I was a tad bit disappointed, muffins were just okay. I should of added more sugar like the other reviewers suggested. I did add another egg to make sure muffins were moist, but they’re just not sweet enough. Maybe I’ll drizzle some honey or maple syrup to give them the sweetness I crave for.

A good solid base.  added diced onion ( 1\2 cup) and diced a fresh jalapeno (minus seeds)and a cup of shredded Mexican 3 cheese blend.  Started to check for doneness at 15 minutes.  Done after 20.  I have a convection oven but adding ingredients  can extend baking time.

I made this the other day, but I substituted buttermilk instead of milk and had to add 1/4 cup of water, and these made it a bit bland. The texture was perfect, and with some butter, they were wonderful. I think next time, I'll use the milk instead and add some corn and a little jalapeno. Thank you! I really loved the texture, and hopefully the milk and additions will be fantastic. I'll let ya know.

Nice simple recipe. I was short of cornmeal by a 1/4cup- but it does not change the texture. I reduce the baking powder to 1 1/2tsp. Remaining ingredients were followed as recipe. ??????????

I have made these muffins SO many times. This is a GREAT recipe. I always add shredded cheddar and chopped up jalapeños. Sometimes honey. My friends are crazy about my muffins! (They also go fantastically with Hungarian Goulash!)

I added 1 1/4 C. cornmeal and almost 1 C. flour. I also added 1/4 c. sour cream. I added a bit more sugar, also. I followed the recipe other than that- also adding 1/2 C. frozen corn (thawed and water drained), 1/2 C. shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and 1 seeded, diced jalapeno. I baked for 19 minutes. Delicious! Goes great with ham and beans! This will be my go to recipe for corn muffins! I think it would also be good with honey along with the sugar, leaving out the cheese, corn and jalapenos.

These were great and so easy.  I took some of the advice on substitutes/changes and went with 1 1/4 C of Corn Meal and 3/4 C of Flour.  I added an extra egg, 2 Tsp of Sour Cream, 1/2 C of Shredded Cheese and 1 1/2 Large Seeded Jalapeño Peppers.  They were moist and tasty.  A perfect compliment to the Chicken Fried Steak and Broccoli Casserole that I made from recipes here.

3 stars for the recipe as written.  5 stars with the adjustments I made. I used  2 eggs,  2/3 cup sugar and substituted buttermilk for milk. This resulted  in a light, tender muffin with just the right amount of sweetness  for us.

Turned out fabulous!!!
I did change a few things since I can't use regular  milk, I replaced that with 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup water and now use coconut oil primarily as my oil. Plus I did pick 2  fresh jalapeños from my garden and diced them and then sautéed just until turning soft and added them to the batter.
I also use a NuWave Oven to bake in so I baked for 19 min. at 350* in a round cake pan. 
Will definitely save this recipe and make it again and again!

I think this is the perfect corn muffin recipe. Quick and easy. I love that it does not contain cream corn or corn kernels. I use a bit less sugar because I like it a bit less sweet. But great recipe!

I also ran out of muffin liners. So I made a bread! So yummy. I just cooked it for about 25 minutes in a 400 degree oven or until toothpick comes out clean.

I substituted a mixture of half melted butter + half olive oil for the canola, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. This turned out a moist, tender muffin. with a fine texture. I will definitely keep this one, but will play with it a little. I would like a more uneven crumb and a stronger corn flavor, so I might blend some coarser cornmeal in with the fine, plus up the cornmeal to 1-1/4 cups (reducing the flour to 3/4 cup) as others have done. Thanks for sharing this recipe! Definitely a keeper!

These corn muffins are a little too floury for my (very Southern) taste, and I cut the sugar a little bit and added jalapeno. Similar to a jiffy mix, if that's what you're looking for.

I have been looking for a corn muffin recipe for awhile.  Found it!!!!  Excellent recipe.  As another reviewer made half a recipe, used buttermilk and melted coconut oil for canola.  Also added small amt of cheddar cheese.  They turned out great and will make often.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Yummy! I made these to go with slow cooked bbq beans, freezer cole slaw and chicken brats. We like spicy so I added 2-3 T of my home canned peppers diced up and 3/4 C of  pepperjack cheese. Thank you for a great base recipe!

I made one batch, they were gone in minutes (literally).  Next day I made a double batch and I stuck frozen raspberries into one batch. They were devoured. Now, my kids ask for them all the time!

This is the first recipe on this site I've rated. I brought these to a family function and EVERY SINGLE PERSON wanted to know my "secret recipe" for these little muffins! It's so simple, but I swear to god people would NOT leave me alone over them, haha. They're my favorite thing to eat with chili. :)

I added some whole kernel corn and some bacon bits to the recipe, and put the mix into small muffin cups and they were a big hit with dinner.  They freeze very well so great to have on hand to go with a rushed week night dinner, a few seconds in a microwave and they taste like they just came out of the oven.

Great, easy recipe...easy to add in extra flavor items (canned corn, chopped jalapeño or diced green chilis, for example). Recipe makes 6 large-sized muffins, same cook time/20 min. Cooks well at high altitude, too.

Substituted butter milk instead of regular milk. Also used coconut sugar (1/4 cup) to make it a little more glycemic-friendly. Excellent, easy recipe. And a bag of cornmeal is way less expensive than the pre-mixed stuff (we used Bob's Red Mill).

This was easy and quick to make.  I reduced the sugar to half of what was recommended because I used applesauce for the oil but it still tasted great.

So quick and turned out perfectly. I was about 30 mins from serving supper when I decided I'd like to serve cornbread muffins with it (chili - pressure cooker recipe from this site). I did decide to sub honey for the white sugar at the last minute. These rose very nicely and were  perfectly cooked inside. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I used  as was suggested by other users 1 1/3 cups cornmeal and split the flour mixture in half with whole wheat flour  and added a little extra milk because I used whole wheat flour (didn't want it to be dry). I used 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, split the sugar in half between dark and white sugar, added a bit of ground flax seeds and vanilla. I topped some muffins with ground seeds and sprinkled a little white sugar  on top.
Excellent recipe,  beautiful muffins, enjoyed by the family.

Thanks Doug.

Made these following the directions exactly using a greased muffin tin. They rose nicely but the tops never browned and I over-cooked them a few minutes as a result. They were very dense, dry, and bland muffins. I may try using liners and more cornmeal/less flour as a few others suggested or just look for a different recipe..

Made it spur of the moment and it was quick and easy, not to mention it taste great. I just found it a little too sweet (and I usually have a sweet tooth) but I figure that could be balanced out by adding some savory elements. They were also pretty small and made exactly 12 so you may need to adjust the recipe depending on how many mouths you plan to feed.

I added sweet corn to these.  Took them to my family Thanksgiving .  Only a few got eaten and no one said they liked them.  Will try a different recipe next time.

Not bad, not great. It was a little bland tasting and dry. I followed the recipe exactly to the letter and I would add a bit more sugar and milk to this recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe. The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons of honey. I baked mini muffins for 10 minutes and they came out perfectly.

I added some extra sharp white cheddar and jalapeno to it to take off some of the sweetness from the corn and sugar. I also increased the baking soda just a little to make them even fluffier. Great simple recipe. :-)

Last time I made it I substituted the sugar with stevia and the oil with applesauce. I also used buttermilk and a bit of honey. Came out really good, a little pale, but delicious.

It was good, HOWEVER, I didn't grind the corn meal so it came out like cake with corn meal in it LOL. It's really easy to make and uses very basic ingredients. I plan on making it again and adding jalapeños next time!

Excellent muffins Doug.   I followed Doug's tweak and increased the cornmeal to 1 1/4 cup and decreased the flour to 3/4 of a cup.   I also used buttermilk instead of milk.   The true cornbread lovers at our table said that they were the best ever.

I have to say the title is very fair.  they are good basic corn muffins. plain they are A-ok but very simple.   I like to add about 1/2 cup or so of sharp cheddar and some chopped Jalapenos.   Makes um great.

Great basic recipe. I used buttermilk and melted butter instead of milk and canola oil. One teaspoon baking powder and one baking soda because of the buttermilk.  Also, I added 1.5 cups of  kernel corn (thawed - freezer disaster). Very tasty served with homemade chicken soup.

I really enjoyed how these muffins turned out, but that my husband and toddler ate them and kept going back for more is the real seal of approval. I thought they were great warm with fresh butter served alongside chili and the next morning they were great warmed up with apple butter and tea. I will definitely make these again and will probably substitute buttermilk for the regular milk as I've seen others mention.

Perfect!  Did not change a thing.  Almost did not try this because someone else said it was dry.  It wasn't.  The right amount of sweetness too.  Thank You for a great easy recipe.

This is a very good basic recipe, as the title suggests.  Because of a dairy allergy at our house, I substituted rice milk for regular milk but it didn't seem to be a problem.  Taste and texture were just right.

The top never got golden brown but it also didn't dry out.

I made this exactly as written. Muffins came out lightly sweet, acceptably moist, with a good flavor. Very white-looking with my ingredients. Has more of what I think of as a corn-bread texture than a corn muffin texture. I may add a little more sugar next time (or honey), if my kids don't accept them as muffins, but I think they are fine. I was looking for a recipe that didn't include the butter we don't have in the house, so these fit the bill perfectly.

Mixed the egg, oil and milk together and added cornmeal to sit for about 10 minutes  before mixing with remaining dry ingredients.  Nice and moist.  Will make again, often.

I was looking today for just the basic corn bread recipe because I had to change a few things up to make it gluten free and dairy free. I chose this one and was happy with the results. I of course had to use a gluten free flour blend and I also used coconut milk instead of cow. They came out just as I wanted. If you need to do the same please keep in mind from past experience : (The gluten free flour blend you use makes a big difference).

Much much better than the Jiffy mix I usually get. My husband loved them even though they were a bit dry on the outside (I put mine in for the full 20, but I'll stick with 15-16 mins next time, or a wetter batter).  I'm bookmarking this one for later.

Over the years I've made a lot of muffins.  I had to make some to have with ribs for tea tonight.  My husband made a special request.  Out of all the muffins I've made, I've never made corn muffins and I lived in Africa for 40 years, where corn bread is part of the staple diet.  

I didn't have all purpose flour so used self raising and added less baking powder.  Worst of all, I didn't put the oil in (I only realised that when they were half baked).   They taste great, and although more like a scone, I think that was because I left out the oil.  I don't think I'll miss it out the next time.  Definitely very versatile!

I will definitely be making this again!

Instead of milk, I used almond milk!
Brown sugar instead of granulated white. Cut it to 1/4 C. instead of 1/3 C. 
I also added 2 tbsp of melted butter!

It is a very crumbly finish, but a perfect pair to my whitebean and hammocks recipe! 
YUM

These muffins turn out okay. They are not the most flavorful at all. In fact they are downright bland. They are also a little bit tough for corn muffins and are much more akin to cornbread.  I highly suggest spraying your cupcake cups.

Served with butter and honey they are passable but I wouldn't put them out for guests.

These were pretty good, although I prefer my corn bread just a little bit sweeter. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used half brown (packed) and half white sugar, I also added about a tablespoon of honey. Even with the addition of the honey they weren't really sweet, but they had nice rise and were moist. I did allow the batter to rest 5-10 minutes before spooning it into the muffin liners. I'll definitely make these again.

We have tried so many corn bread and corn muffin recipes and have struggled to find a great one. They're either too dry, too crumbly or too cakey but this one meets our expectations. The only changes were to decrease the sugar to slightly less than 1/4 cup and add 1 tsp vanilla. Will definitely make these again. They were by far the easiest to make as well.

Try using polenta instead of cornmeal. Adds nice crunch. Also reduce sugar to 1/4c and increase oil to 1/2c.

Very good. I added about 3 tbsp brown sugar because we like sweeter muffins. Also, i used buttermilk instead. They're easy an delicious.

Great muffin.  Turned out beautifully browned, moist and had a wonderful texture.  So easy too.  Went with 1 1/4 c corn meal, 3/4 c flour and 1c buttermilk.  Barely started to make them before I was putting them in the oven :)

These were very quick and easy but they came out very hard with not much taste. I thought maybe I forgot something on the first batch so I made another batch and it was the same. 
I won't make these again.

My boss wanted me to make a bbq stuffed corn muffin for a brunch he is starting. I found this recipe and tried it added corn along with using bbq pork for the middle. Believe me my boss is picky when it comes to things and he said do not change a thing on the muffin recipe ! I so agree it was moist they rose perfectly and I didn't even use muffin papers! Best corn muffin recipe I have come across. Thanks Doug!

I was sort of ok but I won't make again.  It wasn't fluffy (thinking it needed another egg).  It stuck to the paper muffin holders (thinking it  needed more oil/butter).   I thought it was going to be sweet but was actually not sweet at all (not that I wanted sweet).  There are other recipes with more butter, eggs and sugar that I'll try next time.

I just made them two hours ago and I have to say they are really good,that 1/3 Cup of sugar makes it healthier yet the flavor with some butter and a hot cup of coffee made my day.I already decided to make them every two weeksI will make 24 for our ThanksGiving dinner at a Cousins house.
Thank You for this delicious recipe

Simple and delicious! I used regular milk, baked it in a 9inch pan (sprayed with olive oil) until toothpick came out clean (about 15 mins). Ever so slightly sweet, perfectly moist and not crumbly or dry. 

Between the three of us, there wasn't a speck left in the pan. A bit of butter on top because everything is better with butter!

This was very easy and taste good also.  Followed recipe for muffins it makes 12 nice size.  The only thing that I would change is the baking time because 400 degrees is way to hot for dark nonstick pans.  the bottoms were  really golden brown and a little bit hard when removing the wrappers lost the bottoms but, that was okay still had a good size muffin.  And yes I would whip a little bit longer than what the recipe calls for it does make a difference.   The top part of the muffin does come out light and airy. As for the sugar I always use less than what is called for  to me it goes by taste.  You can always put more in but, cannot take out.

I did a cornstarch paste instead of eggs and it worked great the mixture wasn't too crumbly. Also this recipe add too much corn meal and due to the dry to wet ratio being off it didn't have time or the ability to cook so it was like eating a muffin with micro beads.  I added to the next batch more flour and some milk, to soften it up.  One and a half of the kids liked it just fine as it was.

Delicious!!
I changed it by adding vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk so it would be dairy free, substituted white flour for spelt, and instead of the sugar I put some unsweetened applesauce and some agave.

This recipe was easy and simple to make.  My muffins turned out fab!  I swapped out the egg for 3 tablespoons of Mayo and subbed out the milk for Almond milk added raisins and baked for 10 mins ( my oven is fast it's gas) Only two or 3 needed extra time  to bake. They came out moist on the inside with a crunchy exterior.  I found them a bit sweet so next time I'll use less sugar.  Minimal clean up

So easy and light and crispy. I reduced the milk to 3/4  cup and added half can creamed corn (about  1/2 cup). I just sprayed a muffin tin with no stick spray and cooked off for 16 min. Loved them!!

Trying out different recipes, attempting to duplicate the muffins my mom made when I was a lad.  (1960's)  This was simple and mixed up well. Just out of the oven and popped effortlessly out of the pan.  Ate a hot one and it was moist and light.  Very nice.  Still not quite what I'm looking for but easy and good non the less.

I made these with whole wheat flour and a bit more sugar. They were great! The ww flour overpowers the corn flavor somewhat, but they were moist and delicious. Thank you!

I was searching for a simple, yet delicious corn muffin recipe and decided to try this one out.  I added the 1/4 tsp of vanilla as was suggested by other members. I baked them for 15 minutes and they turned out perfect; not too dry, not too sweet, but moist and delicious! My family loved them enough for me to make them over and over again!

This recipe was perfect for just whipping something together. I wanted something simple to try out my new BabyCakes machine and this was perfect for it. Sweet, moist and fluffy. It felt like it might have been lacking in flavor a little bit. Maybe adding some sharp cheddar next time will improve.

It turned out great and I made it really quick. I followed the directions but was in a rush so I threw everything together and popped it in the oven as instructed. They were moist and delicious. I added butter before eating it. I think some peoples come out dry because they either bake too long, too high of heat, put in oven while it's preheating or add too much of the four or cornmeal. Very easy recipe, will make again and again.

I love this recipe!!! Doug Matthews, thank you!!! I followed your variation and then, borrowed from Jillian's review (thanks Jillian); I used unbleached self-rising flour (although, I probably still could have used a tsp of baking powder, because they didn't really rise a lot) but boy are they delicious and moist. I added about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and added a 1/2 cup of blueberries!!! Wonderful!!! Made me very happy. This is such a simple/easy recipe. And to use regular milk and vegetable oil - I couldn't have been happier...Thanks so much again!!!!!

Loved this easy recipe - and I "butchered" it!  I used polenta (coarse grits), dried egg & nonfat dried milk.  I did add an extra 1/8c water & let the batter sit 10 minutes to insure the large cornmeal absorbed enough to be moist. I used an 8x10 Pyrex (sprayed) pan & baked it in the toaster oven. I like a thinner slab of bread, so the honey butter can really shine! Addictive for me, my friend (who had more for "dessert" instead of fresh made PB cookies!) and the parrot.  Thanks, Doug!

These turned out great! I added some variation to the recipe--I made 3 regular, 3 cranberry honey orange, 3 jalapeno, and 3 cheese and corn. If yours come out dry and hard, you probably overmixed or did not add enough liquids.

I just made these and the one I ate hot from the oven, with butter, was delicious and moist. (I mixed the egg, oil and milk together before adding to the dry because I'm used to doing it this way and I know it works.) They only needed 18 mins. in my oven. I usually use the recipe on the cornmeal bag but didn't have one this time. This recipe is simpler and the results are just as good. Thank you!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  At 15 minutes the muffins were overbaked. I did not care for the crumbly consistency and preferred a sweeter smoother muffin.

Very good! :) Thew in a 12oz package of frozen corn, used 5/4 cup corn meal and 3/4 cup all purpose flour as others have done, and switched the sugar for brown sugar (based on what I had). Adding the frozen corn really gave it a delicious flavor -- would recommend doing that.

This simple and easy recipe is a favorite in our home.  I stir a can of corn kernals into the batter and it adds a good burst of favor in every bite.  I make these muffins for my son to pack in his backpack to take to school for snack time.  It is cheaper and healthier than other store-bought snack foods that are processed, such as granola bars, and it is convenient to bake up a batch for the week.

This was definitely a basic recipe.  It didn't specific which type of corn meal to use (white or yellow), so I used yellow.  It didn't taste as sweet as I had liked, but with a spread of honey butter, it was pretty delicious.  I made these to go with the "Easy Chili I" recipe so I'm sure they will be a perfect match, but as a standalone muffin, I think I prefer one with actual pieces of corn inside to add flavor and texture.

Made a half recipe today. Came together quick and easy. The flavor was a little bland, but could easily be jazzed up. Very basic recipe and a good foundation to build off of. Thanks!

i loved this muffins but I did make some adjustments.  I used soymilk, used organic cane sugar, egg replacer, soft whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and, 1/3 cup of Earth's Balance vegan butter sticks instead of the canola oil and omitted the salt since the Earth's Balance has salt in it.  I also added some aged cheddar cheese in the batter and on the top as the muffins half way through baking.  The results were a crispy cheddar top and a most cakey inside.  The muffin was just barely sweet, but exactly how I wanted it.  Next time I will add jalapenos and some garlic to make them savory.I recommend this recipe, not at all dry like some recipes.

Needed to make it sugar free and wheat free so I replaced the all purpose flour with brown rice flour, added 1/2 tsp guar gum to bind, used 1/3 cup maple syrup in place of sugar, kept oil at 1/4 cup (safflower) but reduced the milk by 2 TBS to account for added liquid of maple syrup.  Also, was out of milk, so used plain rice milk (365 brand, unsweetened).  Baked for 18 minutes.  They came out surprisingly tasty and moist, especially  given all the substitutions.

I turned these muffins into breakfast by adding cooked sausage and cheese! I'm pretty sure that this recipe is the same one on the back of a cornmeal bag, but nonetheless it turned tasty and was a quick way to make something a little different for breakfast.

These were just what I was looking for...light and slightly sweet (but not too much, in my opinion).  I made them exactly as written and they turned out perfect.  Had them with beanie weinie :)

This recipe turned out very well.  My muffins looked exactly like those in the photo.  Moist, light and flavourful.  I added sweet corn niblets cut right off the steaming cob and reduced the white sugar by about half.  One comment:  the cornmeal available at my grocery store is "whole grain, medium grind" and as a result, there was a bit of a crunch to the muffins.  I might look for fine grind before I make these again.

So easy to make and very tasty!  I had to use soy milk due to allergies, so I am not sure of the difference it made, but will be making them again for sure.  My oven is a little hotter so I reduced the temperature to 390 and after 13 minutes they were ready.  Will be serving them alongside Turkey Chili tonight.  Yum!!

This is the first time I have ever made cornbread and baked it in a in a round cake tin, rather than making muffins. It turned out wonderfully! I loved the texture. I will tweak this next time and possibly use some citrus flavours to give it an extra kick.

Good basic recipe.  I like that it just uses oil instead of butter, I didn't have cornmeal but I ground up 3/4cu of popcorn in my vitamix (whole grains increase in volume when you grind them) and used whole wheat white flour instead of all-purpose.  The recipe was simple and flavorful without being too dry.  I actually used it to make johnny cakes (cook bacon in a cast iron pan, then w/o draining the fat pour in the cornbread batter and bake top with butter, honey, and bacon crumbles) and it worked well.  It didn't spread in the pan when baking like my normal recipe (one off the back of the cornmeal) does...I think it has a touch less liquid-so just remember to spread it by hand if you are doing a larger cake vs muffins.

Good, but not the best.  I wish I would have used butter instead of oil to add a little more buttery flavor to the muffins.  Overall, they were good with our stew.

Followed the recipe exactly (but for the addition of about 1 tsp of cayenne pepper), and they came out great.  Will definitely make these time and time again!

Good corn muffins though there are other corn bread recipes on this site which I like better.  I added an extra two tablespoons of sugar and added a splash of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Good basic recipe just like the name says!  However, because of such great previous reviews I was expecting something a bit more.  Not sure mine rose properly so maybe I'll add more baking powder if I make again?  Served with soup and were good for dunking.

Very good, but it could have used a bit more corn flavor. I might add some fresh/frozen/canned corn to it next time.

If you're looking for something to WOW you, your mother-in-law, or a significant other, try something different. These are what they say they are: basic. But they are quick, easy and good! My kids (and hubby and I) gobbled them up!

Great muffins! I have forever been searching for a corn muffin recipe that rivals the Jiffy Corn Muffin mix, which I absolutely love. This recipes comes pretty darn close! Also, for a little twist, after I spooned enough batter into 6 cups, I added a bit of orange zest to the remaining batter and ended up with 6 orange corn muffins. Both kinds were yummy!

Overall it was just, ok. yes it was easy and fast but it tastes that way too. pretty dry and a little tasteless. i've made better corn muffins from a mix. sorry, but this didn't impress me.

this is a great recipe. Muffins came out moist and not to sweet...recipe couldn't be easier. I added about 1/3 cup of kernal corn left over from last nights dinner. It added texture and aburst of extra flavor.

I added a half cup of chopped corn to the batter and served these with chili.  Cooking time was exactly 15 minutes in my gas oven.  They were delicious!

A good recipe, but not a lot of flavor. Great for eating with chili or ham and beans, but not if you just want to eat it on its own.

yummy! very sweet muffins, had great texture-soft and moist on the inside and crispy crust on the outside. Like the tops browned a little so I cooked them about 4-5 min longer.

Fantastic recipe, I didn't change the base at all, however as suggested I added corn kernals, minced red and green peppers, minced red onion and very finely diced chipotles peppers in adobe sauce!! These were a hit, however if adding all of these extra fillers I would suggest using a greased tin as they come apart more easily and therefore stick to muffin wrappers.  I will definately save this recipe!

good recipe. followed it exactly. mine took about 20 mins. since there are only 2 of us i prefer the muffin form over reg cornbread because the leftovers usually get hard on the edges and these dont. these were good w/ Chili Mac Casserole from this site. i plan to use the remaining 6 for oven fried chix and mashed potatoes later this week. these are pretty small (dont rise very much) so i would recommend 2-3 per person.

These are great. I'm not a massive fan of corn muffins, but WOW!! Amazing. I used stone ground corn meal and sucanat, which added a little crunch. Used just 1/4 tsp. the salt and it was fine. The sweetness is just perfect...I cannot rave enough about this! Went great with black bean soup.

This is a nice easy and fast recipe. I added a tsp of vanilla to the mixture for added flavour. Also, I cut up and added sausages to half of the batter and raisins to the rest. It was great for breakfast and made for a nice variety(sweet or savoury). They tasted amazing when warmed with butter :)

perfect recipe-I did add a few tweaks though.  i only used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of sugar.  It tuned out great(still moist the next day) and the sweetness is perfect for accompanying a savory dish.

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this one yet. This has become my standard go-to recipe for corn muffins. Great as written, but I usually use buttermilk to give them an even nicer rise. The other night I added a can of cream style corn and reduced the sugar to 2 T. and the milk to 1/2 cup. Baked it in an 8 inch pan and it came out kind of like a cross between cornbread and corn pudding. It was a nice change. But again, this recipe is great as written.

Delicious.  I preheated my greased cast iron muffin pan, then took it out and added batter.  They turned out crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Perfect.  All the kids begged for more.  It made frugal chili night seem like something special.

I used this recipe to make the corn dog muffins - sticking a cut hot dog in the middle.  A very fun lunch!  Nice batter.

This is my favorite cornbread recipe! I bake it for 25 min in a greased 8x8 pan. I wouldn't change any of the ingredients, it always works perfectly for me, and it can be whipped up in less than 5 minutes. It is great for breakfast when you want something warm and just a little sweet.

The muffins were okay. I froze them to use in lunches-- a bad idea.  They were dry and crumbly.  Plus they stuck to the paper liners (both when fresh and later on.)  I would recommend making them in a greased muffin pan instead of using liners, and eating them all fresh from the oven.

We love these corn muffins. I do increase the sugar a little since we like sweeter corn muffins. I make these almost once a week.

Perfect. I made these for two other people and they both told me what a great bread it made (I poured it into an 8x8  pan). I'll be experimenting with different add-ins and seasonings, but this recipe (with no changes, I might add) will always be the base. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made these today and took some advice from some other members and added about 1/4 C. sour cream and 1 T. of brown sugar and I also made used a mini muffin pan. They turned out great. This was my first time making Corn Muffins without the box, and I will be making these again. They were really quick and easy to make as well.

A great basic recipe not only for taste but also for limited clean up!  I threw the batter in a round (maybe eight inch?) pyrex dish and baked for 35 min since I had to throw out my old muffin trays.  Still great!

Super easy recipe! 
I used 1/4 cup Egg Beaters in place of the egg as I was out of eggs, and brown sugar instead of white just because I like it better. Turn out fabulous!

Perfect balance of flavors. I added the extra corn meal and wish I hadn't -- too dry for my taste, but that's not the original recipe's fault. Made 12 "small" and 6 "large" muffins with minimal fuss and clean up. A real winner.

This recipe is quick and very easy!  I had bought a new type of packaged corn muffin mix and when I mixed it up, the batter tasted really awful!!  I decided to check on here to see if I could find a recipe using ingredients I had on hand.  This recipe was almost as easy as using a mix and the muffins turned out great!  I will no longer be buying any corn muffin mixes!  Update: I wanted to make these tonight to go with chili but did not have any canola or vegetable oil, so I subsituted melted butter.  Wow - that made this great recipe even better!!  The muffins turned out really moist.  I know that is not as healthy as the canola oil but as a once in a while treat, I highly recommend using butter.

These are so easy & so delicious.  I used soy milk, and they turned out great. *Update* These are good as is, but in an effort to make them a little healthier, I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and used applesauce instead of the oil.  I also added corn & diced red pepper.  They turned out really well!

This was just about as easy to make as Jiffy and tastes way better! I made the batter and put it in an 8" x 8" pan, and it worked fine. Nice and puffy with a nice texture -- not too heavy, not too light, It also passed the discerning taste of my Southern boyfriend. Thanks for this great recipe!

These turned out fantastic! I made them to go with a beef stew. I halved the portion because there were only 2 of us but they were so good that I'd to make another half portion!

I added 2 tbsp of coarsely ground corn/polenta to the full recipe for added texture and reduced the sugar a little since they were eaten with my beef stew. Yummy!

This is a good recipe because it's simple and adapts easily. Following other reviewers, I used buttermilk and sour cream instead of milk to keep it moist. I cut back on the sugar, using brown instead of white. I added 1 diced jalapeno to the whole batch, and added 2/3C of corn to half the mix. It all came out good, although a little bland. Perhaps more jalapeno and maybe some chili powder? I'll review again with changes, but it's a great starting point.

This came out fantastic: perfect tan color and just moist enough :) I was making the Chili by George on this website, so I thought I would add cheddar cheese and broccoli cuts to the muffins...  My boyfriend and I both had 3 muffins each (oops!) for the one meal, that's how delicious they were :) Thanks so much!

Sad to say cornmeal seems to be unavailable in the UK, so I have never made or tasted cornbread or muffins. A friend and Quality Cook took pity on me and sent me some. I can only rate this on how we enjoyed our first taste and we loved it. Thanks.

I was looking for a cornbread recipe that only called for 1 egg (since that's all I had!).  They were very easy to make.  Not the "best" corn muffins I've ever had, but delicious none the less.

I made these muffins early in the day for dinner.  Before dinner even came around my husband and kids had almost completely devoured the 2 dozen I had made!  This recipe was so quick and easy that I made a 3rd dozen and had them on the table in time for dinner.

I am always trying different cornbread recipes and this has to be the best one so far.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  We couldn't quit eating them! =)

Tasty and easy! I added 2 T honey to sweeten it up just a bit and then served them with “Five Bean Casserole” (found on this site.) Thanks, Doug, for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe with blue corn meal and it worked just great.  Thanks!
