Dosen't taste brownie like to me, but it is STRONG. Quite a bit sweet. Nice to sip on for a treat, but I wouldn't drink these all the time. I used my own homemade irish cream in this.

This drink is delicious.  I don't think it totally tastes like a brownie, but it is one of the best chocolate martini recipes I've ever tried.  I didn't have vanilla vodka, so I used regular vodka with some vanilla added in, but I look forward to trying it with vanilla vodka next time.  Either way, delicious!

Made for a party. While it is a tasty chocolate martini, itâ€™s a too sweet to want to make again.

This recipe was too string and too large for our glasses, so I rounded everything up to full ounces and added an ounce of milk then divided it between 2 glasses. Yum!

This tastes more like a caramel than a brownie.  It is a super sweet drink (as obvious by the amount of sweet liquors).  The taste is fine, but I wouldn't make it again.
