A little too sweet for a pasta salad recipe.  I tried making this recipe w/ only a 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the 2/3 called for, but I think if I'd make it again, I'd only use a tablespoon of sugar.

Great recipe. My parents loved this salad. It was a great little twist to a mac salad. I added some chedder and swiss cheese and mushrooms. I didnt like the mushrooms but the cheese was good. I plan on making this salad for a 4th of July party. Yes, its that good. Although I only used about 3/4 of the dressing....so you could cut back on that a little.

Thought this was a great recipe but added and adjusted a bit.  I reduced the mayo and sugar some.  I thought the texture and sweetness after refrigeration turned out just right.  I also added olives, cherry tomato, hard boiled egg, peas, and a bit of pickle relish.  I always sneak in as many veggies as I can for my family dinners.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I took some advice from other reviews when making this recipe. I cut down the sugar to about 4 tbsp and only used 1 tbsp of mustard. I added some colorful veggies and the salad turned out great. A nice tangy dressing, everyone enjoyed it.

I love this recipe - with or without the ham (you can also sub chicken, bacon, pepperoni, or whatever...) - everywhere I take this it is a hit.  I did cut the sugar a bit - I use about 1/2 cup. This pasta salad is made all summer at my house :o)   I vary the ingredients according to what I have on  hand but the dressing is always the same minus a bit of sugar.  You can put just about any veggie that you like in this and it's great.  Cukes and red onion are a nice addition, etc...

This was pretty good. I used whole wheat rotini since I always buy whole wheat pasta, a red onion instead of a vidalia (I feel red onions are better for pasta salads) & diced the carrots instead of grating them (didn't feel like dirtying the grater). I would make again, maybe next time trying salami instead of ham.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  This was used as a main dish because of the added ham.  The crunch in this gave it great texture and a pound of ham added the protein.  I served this with steamed broccoli and rolls.  The leftover kept nicely for about 3 days.  Thanks Sean for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper.

I made this for a Labor Day gathering and my family loved it. I couldn't find a 16 oz. package of shells, so I used two 7 oz. packages. I used yellow pepper instead of green and red onion instead of Vidalia onion. I lessened the salt and pepper and did not add ham.

I will make this often. It's quick and easy.

I cut the sugar in half and added pepperoncini, black olive, pimento, and extra sharp cheddar.
It was gone in a half hour when I set it out after chilling

Used 3/4 C mayo, 1/2 sugar, no celery, orange bell pepper, rest about the same. It was still on the too sweet side for us, but loved the mustard mix with the ham. Will redo a little to suit us. Good recipe.
2nd Review: Made with 1/2 C each red wine vinegar,  low fat mayo, sugar, 1 T mustard.1 pkg dry zesty Italian dressing mix.

Now this is what I have been looking for! It was actually a little sweet, even for me.  I omitted carrots and added Velveeta. Next time I will cut back on the sugar...just a little!

I did make a change in the amount of sugar - reduced by onehalf.  Used cooked pork loin rather than ham.

I was skeptical about the dressing, but I love it! ...Great tangy flavor.  I did add some frozen peas to the recipe.  I placed them in the colander when I drained the pasta to thaw.  Yummy!

I altered it significantly because I had leftover chicken and I don't usually eat pork.  I used wasabi mayonnaise for 1/2 the mayonnaise, used less macaroni because I'm on a diet, and used eight stalks of celery.  I also put in chopped parsley.   It's good!

I only put in 1/2 the sugar, and would probably go even less next time, and added more veggies.  Good overall.

Awesome sauce! Can really use the veggies/ingredients of your choice. Only used 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/8 onion (not a huge fan).  Love this!

This was really good.  I made it for a church dinner and doubled the recipe, except for the shells.  1-16 oz. package was plenty.  It took a bit of time to get everything chopped, but the taste was worth it all.  I definitaly recommend making it all up the day before.
