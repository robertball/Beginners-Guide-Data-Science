The vanilla is the key ingredient to the BEST marshmallow treats! These are much better than the plain original (no vanilla) recipe, trust me.

These were great! Haven't made them since I was a kid. Add a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice for a nice holiday flavor.(says my grandmother)

YUM!  I love to make these.  So much cheaper than buying them pre-made.  Much better made with butter.

Superb!  Real vanilla extract, real butter, and fresh marshmallows make ordinary Rice Krispie Treats EXTRAORDINARY!!! (definitely use soft, fresh marshmallows because the older ones take much more time/heat to melt and that makes the treats harder when they cool).  For a fun twist, I like to sprinkle mini chocolate chips on top of the warm treats - the chips melt just enough to stay put, but they keep their shape.  YUM!!!

YUMMY!!
It's so easy to make and tastes GREAT!! I  added a 3/4 teaspoons of vanilla, instead of 1/2, for a little more flavour. The whole tray was finished in less than an hour!! I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!!

I've always loved homemade rice krispies treats since I was a little girl! They're so easy to make. I used real butter, double the amount of vanilla and used Kellogg's* Chocolate Rice Krispies* (since we didn't have the regular ones) and they were wonderful! I plan on making them again. The chololate flavour isn't too overbearing at all!

Fantastically easy recipe, with the slight drawback of being incredibly more'ish.  My daughter (12yrs) made this and once it had set, she and I nearly ate the lot.  This is a dream for the sweet-toothed among us! Yummy.

One of my most favorite treats. I learned how to make this from a very young age and now that I'm a mother with two young kids, they now know how to make this as well. This recipe bends well, too, to use Cocoa Krispies or any flavor of marshmallows you'd want to use.

Yummy! As a busy mom, I don't bother with a pan though. I prepare my hands and a piece of waxed paper with cooking spray and shape it into a rectangle (about the shape/size/thickness that you'd make in a pan). Saves cleanup - one less pan to wash!

What a classic, I could never get tired of these!  Sometimes I'll melt about 1/2 C butterscotch chips and 1 C semi-sweet chips and frost.

Really hard to mess up this simple and delicious recipe. I like my squares a bit more marshmallow-y, so I usually add extra (total of ~6 cups)

Yummy.  I had bought dollar store marshmallows that weren't the best, but with the vanilla they were amazing!  I ended up making three batches.

Always a classic! I make mine in two batches and (depending on the occasion) add different colored sugar or sprinkles, then layer them. They were a big hit at Christmas ;-)

Takes me back to childhood, and my 2 year old loved pressing it into the pan. He had a ball licking his fingers when he was done, and the bath he got to finish getting him clean. LOL

They taste just as a rice krispy treat should.  Yummy!  I've never added vanilla to them before, I don't know if it changed it much, but they still taste great.  I used half regular rice krispies and half coco krispies.  They were for fondue night, so they got a nice chocolate bath before being eaten as well.  A classic and a keeper when it comes to recipes.

You can't go wrong with this recipe - an all time classic! I usually substitute marshmallow fluff for the marshmallows. Sometimes I mix in rainbow sprinkles for a more "festive" look! I have made these in mini muffins and drizzled white and regular chocolate on top!

Well, I had to make these in secret before my aunt woke up, Long story. I did the marshmallow mixture all wrong, DO NOT use colored marshmallows on a stove top and constantly stir. It'll not be a good color...(unless maybe you segregate the colors or melt them seperatley)... I did this mistake of using a spatula and I had to throw the batter when my spatula melted. (I am a kid anyway so it's excusable) Which means I got to wait till next week again to try these out... wish me luck the second time! :) Okay, next day! I made them with white marshmallows but  lessened the cups of cereal. I only had about 4 1/2 cups so I made use of that and I added some extra marshmallows as well and cereal bits. Yummy!

So easy when made in the microwave. The vanilla does make the difference. These are so much better than the ones you can buy in the store prepackaged. I had forgotten what the homemade ones tasted like.

Delicious! To make these faster I microwaved the butter & marshmallows on high (in a microwave safe bowl) for 2 minutes, stirred well, and microwaved 1 more minute. I added the vanilla right before mixing it with the cereal. Yum!

A classic...never gets old!  These are my hubby's all time favorite "kiddie" treat.  I find it easiest to spray a little non stick cooking spray on your hand and then press them into the pan.  We've also made strawberry treats by adding strawberry extract and some red food dye.  Not quite as good as the original but a nice change every now and then.  You could do so many variations of this recipe, the possibilities are endless.

These turned out perfect, very soft!  I used cookie cutters to make ghosts and pumpkins and then iced them!  They made a perfect snack to bring to my son's costume party!

I'm not a big fan of rice krispie treats, but my husband is so I made these for him. I added a cup of mini chocolate chips for a little more sweetness. All the chips melted so every bite was chocolately. I also used a heart shaped cookie cutter to cut them out since I was making them for my husband.

Really can't go wrong. An old classic that is easy to make. Soooo many ways to add your own personal touch. I like adding 1/2 Cup smooth peanut butter and drizzling the tops with melted milk chocolate.

Easiest recipe ever!! Great homeade treat, much better and cheaper than buying at the store. Impossible to mess up even if your not paying attention to what your doing, like myself. Added 4 cups mini marshmellows and 4 cups cereal instead of 6. came out great! corrected recipe and added an extra cup marshmellows... yuuuummm!!!!

These are the best. I alway melt the butter and marshmellows together in a low temp oven, stiring a couple of times with a buttered spatula until marshmellows are melted.

These were so easy, I never had made rice krispie treats before because some reason I thought they were hard to make. Anyways my husband had ask for some and I tried these. Needless to say they were gone in no time.

This is my family favorite. My son prefers me to make this half with fruity pebbles and half plain rice crispy. I agree the vanilla flavoring is a key ingredient.

This has always been a favorite of mine.  Although, I substitute the Rice Krispies with Fruity Pebbles for Christmas treats for the grandbabies.

These really are good and are what my 4yo and I made together to leave for Santa -less ingredients than the traditional "cookie" recipe.  He can stir the rice crispies while they're in a bowl and then in the blend after I turn the heat off and hold the pot until it gets too hard.  He can also put sprinkles on/in them.  Through trial and error I have found: use real butter if possible and the vanilla is a must (if you like it).  Use fresh mini marshmallows (on my first go I used the larger ones that were a little old- which lead them to take longer to melt and the blend started to lightly burn; so I threw it out.)  Keep stirring while they're melting! You can also put water, non-stick spray or a little butter on your hands to keep your hands from sticking when pressing it down.  It's a great treat/base recipe to make treat bars, where you can add whatever else strikes your fancy: nuts, chocolate chipes, etc.  I'm going to try some different dried fruit in it eventually :0)

Mmmmm ~ I've been making these since I was 4 or 5 and "helping" my Mom in the kitchen. An all-time favorite!
