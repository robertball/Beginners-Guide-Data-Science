This was awesome! I did make the change of using 2 Tbsp of rum instead of 1 Tbsp, and because I read the recipe wrong, I ended up combining the white sugar, brown sugar, egg, rum, and cream together while cold, so I heated the custard on a double-boiler so as not to curdle the egg yolks. Delicious recipe!

Jennr, thank you sooo much for posting this recipe!  I think this is the best ice cream I've ever made.  My husband said it's to die for!  I didn't have bourbon whiskey so I subbed Capt Morgan rum.  Served with a warm butter rum syrup and chopped walnuts.

Excellent! Easy to make, and I was extremely satisfied with the outcome. Next time I may add a teeny bit more whiskey, but it was still outstanding!

Flavour ok but the consisency of mashed banana spoils the ice cream
