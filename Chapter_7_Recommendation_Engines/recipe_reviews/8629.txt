Everyone really enjoyed this. It could use a little more flavor, though, so I added more pepper and stirred in about 1/2 cup parm cheese at the very end. Excellent!

Was I supposed to cook the rice first?  My batch did not come out with a "thick" sauce.  It tastes pretty good but the rice is a little crunchy.  Lol.  I'm gonna cook the rice first next time I think

This was very good and even my picky kids enjoyed it with parm chz on top! I wasn't sure if I made it correctly--it doesn't say if you use cooked or uncooked rice. I had some left over from dinner the night before and used it. It tasted fine, but I'm still not sure. Anyone know???

we just didn't like this...it was so brothy and didn't have much flavor.  i love the idea of wild rice and spaghetti together, but it needs to be creamy for our taste.  also, i used actual wild rice, not from a mix.  that was a long cooking process and i think using the wild rice mix (like uncle bens) would have been easier and yielded a much better overall flavor--might have helped with that brothy issue.

YUM!!!! Leave the the rice and spaghetti a slightly underdone before you add it to the broth. The extra 15 minutes made mine a little mushy. I added a teaspoon of garlic salt, used a whole red pepper, the whole package of wild rice and added pepper. My family loved this, even my 17 month old. :) Will make again and again.

We followed this recipe exactly and did not like it at all. It turned out very bland and runny. It had no flavor at all until it got loaded down with parmesean cheese. Won't try this one again.

I wasn't sure if I wouold like this recipe or not, but it turned out very good. It got the thumbs up from my wife and the kids too. I think it might be missing some garlic, so I'll try that next time. The recipe is very good on its own, however.

This is a great recipe. However, I substituted the plain chicken breast with pre-spiced fajita chicken strips and it is even more better.

I altered this one a bit. I left out the chicken and used garden broth instead of the chicken broth. This made it vegetarian and it was a great dinner. I will use more veggies next time.

This turned out very nice!  I used all the ingredients listed but maybe cooked them just a little differently.  I seasoned the chicken with Papa's Seasoning Salt, a recipe from this site that I always keep on hand and a generous sprinkling of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute.  I rinsed my wild rice before adding it to the pan along with the broth.  This time I had to use my emergency supply of TJ's Organic Chicken Broth because I was out of my homemade broth.  I let that cook down for about 15 minutes and then added the onions and peppers and cooked for a few minutes.  I had to add about another cup of broth when I added the chicken and spaghetti back in.  At the very end I added in some more chopped onion because we love it crunchy!  It was really tasty!  I'm going to be very happy with having leftovers!  Thank you so much, Katie Mines, because I never would have thought of putting wild rice and spaghetti together!

I was tentative about this recipe, but when it was actually made I rather enjoyed it quite a bit. Although, I did make a few substitutions. 

First I subbed the green onions for squash.
I didn't have 3 cups of chicken broth, only two, so I added a cup of French Onion soup.

Otherwise, I kept the recipe the same. It still tasted delicious, though.

This was very bland and not enought time for the rice to cook.  There was no creamy sauce, just broth.
