This recipe is very simple and quick. I used 1 tsp of black pepper and 1/8 tsp of red pepper I also added 1/8 tsp of dry basil. I made Bow-Tie pasta and pre- done frozen Italian Meatballs. After microwaving the meatballs I placed them in the sauce pan and let it simmer. Dinner was a success although still a little too much black pepper. I would do over with 1/2 tsp or less of black pepper.

My husband and I think this sauce is as good as any 5-star restaurant.  We poured it over boneless pork chops and served a side of cut green beans with it.  It is easy to make and tastes just as good a couple of days later after being refrigerated and reheated.

Very easy and quick recipe. I did just a dash of chili powder and 1 tsp. black pepper. I will probably just do 1/2 tsp. of pepper next time. I mixed the ingredients and put sauce in with frozen meatballs in crockpot. Turned out great!

Yummy sauce however the black pepper was way too strong. 2 teaspoons of black pepper was too much! I would recommend starting with half a teaspoon and possibly working your way up to 1 teaspoon!

Delicious! I was looking for a simple gravy to serve over breaded pork chops for dinner tonight. My husband loved it! He told to put this in the rotation. He was even giving suggestions on entrees and sides that he thought it would be great paired with. My husband likes spicy and the pepper definitely did that. I think I may cut the pepper in half next time though it definitely wasn't a deal breaker. Also I didn't have a can of milk on hand so I used 2% milk that I had in the fridge instead. Great recipe!

I've used cream of mushroom as a gravy before but this gravy had a very unique taste. Definitely not your grandmother's gravy....still haven't decided if i like it or not but I will be sticking to a more traditional tasting gravy in the future.

Such an amazing recipe. Hands down one of my favorites to cook with. I took the advice from others with the pepper and it turned out great also added some chopped chives and fresh garlic.

Instead of soy sauce I used balsalmic and a couple dashes of worchestersire sauce. Since its going on top of mashed potatoes and crock pot pulled pork I added pork drippings to it. Turned out wonderful. Next time I need to double the recipe. It went fast.

I was skeptical about the chili powder in a mushroom sauce and yep wayyyy too much. It overpowered the entire sauce. I love spicy but not here. I added sour cream and beef broth to tone it down. Next time no chili powder.

I loved this sauce. I made extra so I could freeze it. I seared 2 pork chops and then a chopped onion in a pressure cooker. I did add a cup of yogurt instead of the milk and a cup of homemade chicken stock and set the PC for 10 minutes. I removed the chops cooked down the sauce and had a great dinner.

Yes I tweaked it but this one is definitely a keeper! I simply added garlic EVOO & white wine... and I used less of all the seasonings. Fantastic!!! I have a sneaking suspicion that I now know how Mimi's prepares the mushroom sauce they serve on their crêpes!;-))

Love this! I added less chili powder less black pepper and an extra can of cream of mushroom considering I like that "Creamy" taste to my sauce. Mine came out very textured because many of my ingredients were not a powder. It is a very strong sauce but I would recommend it to anyone. I served a small amount on some noodles and my whole family loved it.

I was planning on making meatballs and needed 2 sauces. Since with happened to have a can of mushroom soup in my pantry near expiry this looked like a good choice. I'm the last person I know that would eat canned soup but this surprised me. I added chives and fresh thyme and omitted the Italian seasoning. Also sautéed 1/2 onion before adding the soup mixture. My only suggestion is please use low sodium soup and soy sauce or this will be a bit too salty. Would I make again?.. Not sure as I rarely even keep canned soup on hand.. But I would recommend it people that do.

TRIED TO FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY but only had nonfat milk So good and even better the next day. Try this when you just want a little different flavor for a sauce on the fly using that trusty can of Cream of Mushroom you always have on hand.

I followed the recipe with exception of only adding 1 tsp. of pepper. That was way too much pepper even then. I would probably leave out the pepper altogether or maybe just add a pinch next time.

Way too peppery!!! It was much more tolerable the second day but that was after cutting it with more milk and then water and flour. Will not be wasting cream of mushroom on this again.

Was very tasty over a pork tenderloin. I prefer a little thinner gravy sauce so I added a bit more milk as it simmered. Slightly too rich in the chili powder spice. I will cut back a little next time I make it. Definitely worth making again however.

I really did not like this. It is way too peppery & way too herby & aside from that did not have much else flavor. It needed more zing...like maybe onion soup mixed in but for me this recipe as is is a dud.

I used almond milk and it was delicious! I wish it was a bit thicker. I can really taste the pepper but it's not too much. I will double the recipe next time to have enough to pour over the rice. I made this sauce for turkey meatballs ( large ones) , rice and broccoli . It was a great meal. Thanks for sharing .

Unless you really, really like pepper I strongly suggest reducing the amount called for in the recipe. I used 1tsp and it was still too much for my family. Next time I’ll use 1/2 tsp. Aside from that it’s tasty and easy to make. I used it as a sauce over pierogis.

I love this recipe and have used it multiple times. Its great with ground turkey and noodles or rice. I have made a few substitutes to this recipe and find that no matter what I try it always turns out great. I discovered recently that I am lactose intolerant so this time I used almond milk. Took out the soy sauce and added one egg and a teaspoon of flour to thicken it. The almond milk gives it a beautiful earthy flavor. Just delicious! You can definitely experiment with the different spices like oregano Italian seasoning add extra mushrooms. The only 2 things I always keep the same is 1/2 a can of milk/ almond milk to 1 can of mushroom soup.

2 teaspoons of pepper makes this sauce VERY spicy. I will reduce to 1 teaspoon next time. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I substituted cream of chicken. I also added a little extra salt. This sauce saved my dry overcooked pork chops.

Thank you for this quick gravy recipe. I made it for my husband last night. He loves it and ate all of it over biscuits and rice. He is lactose intolerant so I had to use almond milk. I also scaled back the pepper because he is sensitive to excess spice. I made no other changes. It was wonderful and so simple and quick with a wow factor like you cooked all day.

Would make again. Didn’t have parsley or Italian seasoning (added to the shopping list!) so I improvised. Did 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp onion powder (would also have done garlic powder but was also out of that), I think I added a tsp salt which made it a smidge salty but not bad. Also out of milk ;) so I did approx. 1/4 can buttermilk and 1/4 can water. Hubby, son and baby enjoyed it with meatballs and mashed potatoes. Picky son wasn’t impressed but never is.

Made this and loved it. Put it on cheese ravioli. I used less of all the spices and omitted the chili pepper since I was serving my kids. They ate it up so fast. It was a nice change from marinara pasta. Will definitely make again!
