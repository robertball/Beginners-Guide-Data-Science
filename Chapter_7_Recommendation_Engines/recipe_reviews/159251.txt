Great flavor! I roasted my 5lb chicken on 350 as I usually do, because I was afraid 400 would be too high and mine was perfectly done in 90 minutes. Also, I think there was more than enough rub/paste for the 5 pounder, so if you're doing a 2 1/2 pound chicken as the recipe indicates, you may want ot reduce your rub by half. Thanks for the recipe - a keeper!

This was a very nice curry with some subtle additions. I used it mostly for the spice combination, and it came out great on boneless skinless chicken breasts. Make sure that you use smoked paprika - the plain mccormick stuff will not add anything to the recipe. Also, I was out of couscous so I made grits. The only thing that I changed flavor wise was not no duplicate the spices exactly in the grits - I wanted a little variation. I am sure you could add fruits like raisins or cranberries, and veggies as well. I will use this spice combination again.

I really liked this, it reminds me very much of the chicken at the ethiopian restaurant that I love. I liked the couscous but my kids didn't very much, maybe it's the texture. So next time I'll substitute it for basmati rice instead (like the restaurant).  The spices are just right, flavour-wise. As for the amount of spices this recipe makes, SunnyByrd is right, this will stretch easily to accomodate more chicken. Oh ya, I used whole chicken legs instead of the whole chicken and baked them for an hour at the recommended temperature. I also didn't have lemon so used lime instead. Very good, I'll most definitely be making this again!

This was a tasty recipe. I like to make one dish meals at dinner. to save time. Instead of using a whole bird, I used a cut up chicken, about 3 pounds. I rubbed the pieces with some of the spice mixture as instructed, and laid them in a large baking dish. Then, I added a zucchini, summer squash, a green pepper, and a red onion, all cut into large-ish pieces. I also included a box of whole button mushrooms. These I scattered over and around the chicken. Then I dotted the veggies with the remaining spice mix, and drizzled them with a little extra olive oil and 1/2 cup chicken broth to prevent scorching. I baked the pan in the oven at 400F for about an hour, turning and basting the veggies a couple of times. As the vegetables gave off some water and the chicken gave off its own fat, the whole thing cooked evenly and everything was coated with the chili-curry spices. It turned out really delish, especially served over the couscous! Worth a try.

My husband, and even my kids, love this recipe! It is tried and true and is a regular dinner in our home. I have actually even used boneless, skinless chicken breasts in place of the whole chicken, since I like them more. I just throw 3-4 in a shallow baking dish and poured the whole amount of paste over top the chicken and baked uncovered for 30 or so minutes and served along side the couscous, and it's fab, as well! Yum!

DELICIOUS! The only changes I made were to use bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (because that's what I had), and I was out of onion powder so I used dried onions. I also reduced the cooking time somewhat because of the breasts. I cooked them for an hour, but they probably would have been done in about 45 minutes. The seasonings in the couscous weren't too strong, so they complimented the chicken, and didn't seem too much of the same. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!

The flavors were great, but I must have used too small of a chicken, because I had gobs and gobs of rub left even after coating everything well. I let it marinate for the afternoon before cooking, and it smelled specatcular while in the oven. I made a chicken salad with the left overs the next day, and it was absolutely fantastic. I may cook chicken like this specifically for the purpose of making chicken salad the next day. My husband raved about it!

I thought everything in the chicken was great, but it seemed to only be on the skin and the flavor needed to marinade longer to get into the bird.. I didn't have couscous, so I made some rice pilaf instead.. Still a very good meal!..

thought Ckn was ok. made for a group of 40+ people.  Followed directions completely except used skinless breasts. and slow cooked.  Had way too much mixture left over and curry taste was so weak.  Dont think I will be making it again.  Too much work with not enough bang.

Lots of ingredients but LOTS of flavor! I used chicken legs and thighs as that's what I had on hand. I omitted the sage (not a fan) and used fresh garlic. I was going to save time by serving it with plain basmati rice but I am SO glad I went with the couscous - really buttery and fragrant! This isn't something I would make regularly but it was definitely nice for a change. Thanks, greennie!

I just made the couscous part of this recipe and it was VERY good....I had made "plain" couscous before, it was awful! This was flavorful and satisfying. I eyeballed the spices, using probably less than called for as we are not fond of curry, but it was pretty darn good!!! I will make this again! Thanks for a great recipe greennie!!!

I tried this recipe (made by stepdaughter) and I thought was good, but if marinated could be better.  So I did it marinating and it was great, the chicken was much more flavorful.  Today I thought of making it with chicken breasts (had my doubts) but reviews said it was good.  This recipe is definetely not for anything other than whole chicken!  There is not enough liquids from skinless/boneless breasts and it came out great in  flavor but not saucy as should be (kinda grainy).  Stick to original recipe and you won't be disappointed!

My wife made this for me using smoked paprika and chicken breasts and it was delicious. The color, aroma, and taste were perfect. The smokiness of the paprika we used complimented the heat of the curry. We would have never finished a whole chicken, but we'll definitely give this another go when we have company and can finish a whole bird!

I didn't make the couscous so I can't comment on that.  Chicken was good, though it was a little dry.  I would recommend lowering the temperature to 350 or 375 and cooking for slightly longer.  It was worth the time (which was minimal) and I would definitely make it again - though the apartment did smell like curry for a week afterward!

Absolutely delicious! For this recipe I used a package of bone0in chicken thighs and dredged them in the spice mixture for about 15 minutes before baking. Also, I used brown rice instead of couscous and next time I make the rice I am going to omit the lemon juice. The lemon flavor overpowered the side dish.

The chicken is amazing. I didn't make the couscous because was making a gluten free meal. I actually made the curried quinoa from this site and they were excellent together. 

I will use this recipe again. Don't scrimp on the spices. I let the paste set for about 30 minutes while I washed chicken and other prep work. I did make sure to put quite a bit of the paste inside the cavity and I think that helped with the amazing flavor. I was worried it would be too spicy with 1 tbsp of chili powder, but the heat was just right. And as stated in other reviews, my house smelled like an Indian market.

I was conflicted about how to review this recipe.  I thought the curry rub/paste was fabulous and loved the finished product.  The couscous part of the recipe did need some help as some other reviewers have noted.  I made the same amount of orzo and mixed in with the couscous and also chopped up very finely a medium onion and several ribs of celery to add to the couscous/orzo mixture. I sauted the celery and onion briefly in olive oil on the stove top before adding to the mixture. I believe the two different pastas made for an interesting texture and the celery/onion gave it a nice crunch. I think the next time I will either make a whole small turkey or a bone-in turkey breast rather than chicken, I wanted there to be more!  I Loved the smokey, spicy taste of the rub and the aroma in the house was amazing too. 03/22/2011 - Additional note: -I made this again and added a package of chopped spinach to the pasta combination. I very much like the combination of couscous and orzo. I also decided to use the not-quite-picked-clean carcass and carrots, onions, celery and made a stock.  I then made a chicken soup and because of the wonderful spice paste it was a rich, spicy and satisfying soup.  The best thing about this recipe is that spice paste, it is fabulous!  I've discovered the joy of cooking with smoked paprika!  Too bad it is so expensive, but so worth it.  I still think using a small turkey with this recipe would make for a lovely dinner for a dinner party.

Pretty easy to prepare. Husband and my 6 year old enjoyed the taste. The 4 year old on the other hand was not overly thrilled with the taste. I cooked this using my beer can rack. I would make this again.

I just made the couscous part of this recipe to go with the Garlic Chicken Kabobs from this site. It was very flavourful. I will make it all the time as I love couscous. I can't wait to try the whole recipe and will update when I do. I have never done a whole chicken.

This was really, really, REALLY, good! I made sure that I put the spices paste under the skin of all parts as well as on top. If you want to stretch it to another meal,cut off all the parts to serve for the first meal leaving only the carcass. Simmer the carcass in drippings and 2 bouillon cubes in five cups of water. When you have a nice broth, remove carcass, pick off meat, set meat aside. Add to broth 2 cups of basmati rice and 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables.  Boil the rice and veg (covered)until nearly all the liquid is absorbed. Add the carcass meat (along with any leftover chicken meat from the first meal) to the pot and simmer until 
ALL the liquid is absorbed.  I added a bit more curry powder and garlic along with some salt.  It made a nice entree with a garden salad on the side.  Made enough for six good helpings! It wasn't as yummy as the first entree but was very tasty and thrifty!

Not bad.  I only made the chicken and following the recipe exactly.  The chicken itself came out nice and moist, the house still smells amazing, but the flavor was just okay.  I think it was the chili powder.  If I try it again, I'll use less of that.

This was GOOD!  I had plenty of spice mixture to coat a 5 lb chicken.  Next time I'll give it a few hours to marinate and then it will get 6 stars!  I used regular paprika, but will try the smoked variety next time. My kitchen still smells wonderful!

Chicken was DELICIOUS! The Couscous had only spicy flavor. It needed a little bit more seasoning, I think.

This was good, the chicken was very flavorful. Next time I will double the amount of spices for the couscous however, we found it a little bland.

Excellent Recipe! We used Basmati rice in place of couscous. Took the left overs and make chicken stock for chicken rice curry soup the next day. Will be making again!!

I would go 3 1/2 stars.   I only made the chicken and used thighs, but followed the recipe exactly.  It was okay, but not phenomenal.  It may have been my curry powder.  I made the full amount of curry mixture, rubbed onto thighs and under the skin and marinated like that for 24 hours.  I really expected the flavor to pop, but it didn't. I will try again with a different curry powder.

I made this for my family and even my "picky" children loved it. The entire chicken was devoured with very little left.  The second time I made it I used a larger chicken an took the remaining meat off the bone and cooked the bones in water to make soup. Added veggies and voila! Soup! Two meals..Yeah!

Delicious! Made exactly per the recipe except omitted the salt and made a 5lb roaster. Getting the curry sauce under the skin was key... made the meat very flavorful. Looking forward to trying chicken salad tomorrow.

WOW... this was awesome! I used chicken leg quarters but followed the recipe otherwise. I rubbed the spices under the skin and on top, and broiled a few min. at the end to make the skin crispy. For those who dont want couscous I substituted regular white rice and that came out awesome too!! I def. recommend this and cannot wait to make it again! :)

This was a big hit with my family. I made it exactly as written and it was plenty for 2 whole chickens. It made the house smell wonderful, not a strong curry either. Excellent!

I really liked this, but I made some serious alterations. First, I read a review where someone put their 5 lb. bird at 350 degrees for 90 minutes. I decided to follow the recipe, and did 400 degrees (I also had a 5 lb. bird).  I was going to turn it at the 45 minute mark, but realized it was already almost cooked! So, I ended up cooking for about an hour at 400 degrees (next time, I will do 350 for 90 minutes).

Also, I didn't have couscous and didn't want to go to the store, so I made quinoa in a very similar matter with some alterations. First, I melted the butter and cut up the chicken livers very fine, fried the livers with the bay leaf. Then, I fried about a cup of the quinoa, it gives it a nutty flavor. Next, I added 3 cups of chicken broth and 5 cups of water, and about 3 tbsp. of lemon (I find that quinoa cooks best at a 4:1 liquid to quinoa ratio).

Then, I poured in the remaining 1 1/4 cups quinoa with all the spices already mixed in. Turned out great!

I may also score the bird next time to let all those awesome flavors permeate the entire chicken.

As other reviewers have commented, you'll have tons of leftover paste. However, it really is tasty. I roasted sweet potatoes, red and yellow peppers and onions in the same pan with the chicken and the resulting chicken/curry broth mixed with the veggies was absolutely divine!

this was very tasty.. it didn't really make a paste.. more like a sauce.. so i put everything into a zip lock bag and marinated for maybe 45-60 min's.. grilled this and think it would have benefited being marinated for longer.. having said that this recipe was delicious as is.. i only made the chicken.. but would love to see how this would do after marinating overnight.. ty for the recipe

Loved it. I used it as a sauce on boneless breasts, legs and thighs. I use 1tbsp of hot parika and 1 tbsp of sweet paprika to give it a bit of "oompf". I like to put it into a large stainless steel pan, thick bottomed, covered with a lid or foil, and then cooked on a gas grill. It's usually done in about 20 minutes, your cooking time may vary of course.

Really good chicken, I did not make the cuscous. Used leg quarters instead of whole chicken. Changes made, was out of chili powder so used a little siracha paste, was also out of sage so used a bit of poultry seasoning. Great flavor, family loved it. I think the siracha was good and will add more next time.

I really liked this recipe! It was tasty, spicy and very moist. The flavours really sank into the meat! I didn't use the couscous with the chicken. I roasted it with potatoes, onions, garlic cloves and mushrooms which cooked in the spicy juices from the chicken and made it DIVINE! Only thing I would add next time is a little bit of honey to add just a hint of some sweetness. Also, as others have noted, there was lots of leftover rub so I would half the rub ingredients next time. Otherwise, its a keeper!

This is my go to chicken recipe, and I have friends and family asking me to make it for them.  I like cooking it on the outdoor grill or in the smoker - wonderful flavor and doesn't leave a lingering oder in the house of curry.
