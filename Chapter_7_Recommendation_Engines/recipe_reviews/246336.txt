This turned out well. I added extra Parmesan cheese on top because we like it. Also, added some bacon because, you know why.

Made as written and loved every bite! You can't go wrong with this one. I think the only one thing the recipe isn't clear on is the shrimp. It doesn't specify to use raw or cooked. Use raw. This is a great recipe! Sprinkle some shredded parm on the top for an extra punch of flavor.

It was my first time making zucchini like spaghetti and I didn't know if I'd like it.  But it was delicious.   I didn't have a lemon so I used a lime.  Substituted white onion  for the shallot. And used 4 cloves of garlic.  I also reduced the butter by half.  Like another reviewer suggested, I added fresh chopped tomato toward the end of cooking the zucchini.  This along with the green on the zucchini made a very colorful dish.  I sprinkled the parmesan on individual servings to reduce the amount needed. My husband liked it with a light touch of cayenne.  I will definitely make it again.

I tried using a different recipe using zucchini noodles and shrimp and my family did not like it so I was skeptical to try this recipe.  I reluctantly made it tonight and it was a success!  We found it to be flavorful and delicous.  I added some chopped tomatoes towards the end of cooking time for extra color and taste and topped each serving with some fresh shaved Parmesan.   I will definitely keep this recipe and use it again.

I use 2 boxes of Trader Joe's frozen zucchini noodles to make it easier just ensure you drain and fully remove all water/moisture.  I also keep cooking white wine available. I make this meal 1-2 times a month.  My husband loves it and it has become one of our favorites!

Followed the recipe exactly except used salted butter and cooked, frozen shrimp that had been thawed. Threw the shrimp in when the noodles were about 2/3 of the way done. Hubby said it was one of the best meals he's ever eaten. Love it when a recipe doesn't require any tweaks. Thanks for sharing it!

This was, I think, my favorite meal.  I added red and yellow cherry tomatoes cut in half and some sliced mushrooms when I added the garlic.  Sooooo good. My husband made a pasta dish with sautéed tomatoes and garlic (I try to skip carbs where I can). We tasted each other’s dish....he even liked mine better and said he would try it next time!  Thanks so much for this.

Excellent recipe. My daughter always wants me to make linguine and shrimp when visiting. This time made this zoodles dish instead. She liked it "just as much!" 

With a nod to another similar recipe, added 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes when sautéing garlic. Adds just a "little kick" to the dish

Don't go overboard on the garlic. OK the first day, but if you use a LOT of garlic, then re-heat the next day, you will stand alone in a crowd! No one will want to be near you! I usually go a little heavier on the lemon juice.

We absolutely love this dish! We did not have a white wine, so we added chicken bone broth instead. Perfect substitute. Absolutely delicious!!

There is no need to cook the Zucchini noodles in this recipe.  If you do they will be soggy and fall apart.  Fold the uncooked zoodles into the Shrimp and sauce.  Extra sauce is helpful and lots of garlic.  I also folded Parmesan Cheese and fresh spinach into the mixture.  Awesome

I seasoned the shrimp with Emeril's Essence Seasoning before sauteing.  Otherwise, stuck to the recipe.  Loved it!

wow!  what a great flavor; because of dietary reasons, no cheese, used chardonnay, and saved the sauce to flavor chicken breasts the next night.  The flavort was #1!

Made this for dinner and it was amazing!!! We added white mushrooms and used whole wheat thin spaghetti noodles. It was a HUGE hit. We will definitely make this again and might try spaghetti squash next time.

Delicious! I added tomatoes just because but didn’t change anything else. I would recommend making a little more if you’re cooking for 4 hungry people - maybe add extra shrimp for more protein. The noddles cook down a lot so it doesn’t give the impression of a ton of food.

I made it exactly how the recipe stated. We all really enjoyed it. I really liked the zoodles in place of pasta plus zucchini with dinner on a summer night is always great.

I made several changes to this only because I know what my wife likes, but the inspiration and core of the ingredients came from this amazing recipe. Wife: “This is one of the best dinners I’ve ever had! At home, fancy restaurant or otherwise.”

The sauce is great! You can't go wrong with butter, garlic, and white wine lol 

I will say I did use a whole lemon, not half. Outside of that I made no other changes.

So good!  Even my husband lked it :)  I only used 2T butter. I also added 1/4 C chicken broth with the lemon juice and wine.  1/2 t red pepper flakes were added along with the black pepper and salt and gave the dish a little zing but did not make it too spicy hot. Yummy!!

Delicious! I used 3 cloves of garlic, and will probably up that next time. It is especially delicious with some crusty bread to sop up the juices!

This was fantastic! Even my husband, who usually won't go anywhere near squash, liked it.

I also made some modifications as to what I had on hand, and only made a small portion.  I used only 1T butter and it tastes great.  I didn't have shallots or onions, but used garlic and 3/4 of a orange pepper.

Nice light dinner.  Zucchini noodles a quick to make and fun to eat.  The sauce was a bit too lemony for me.  I freestyled a little and added garden fresh broccoli and some red bell pepper.  Next time I will cut down the lemon juice and maybe add a touch of light cream.
