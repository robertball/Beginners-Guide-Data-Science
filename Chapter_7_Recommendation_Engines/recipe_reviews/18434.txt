Just what I was looking for!  I used a homemade Graham Cracker crust, and while the crust was cooling melted 2 milk chocolate Hershey bars in the bottom of the crust then finished the recipe as written.  Yum!

I made this with sugar free fat free non instant chocolate pudding, fat free milk, Cool Whip Free, and gluten free graham crackers crushed for the crust.  Very yummy!

Everyone loved this recipe!  My 10 year old son made it and added crushed oreos into the pudding and whipped cream layer, and topped with more crushed oreos.  Yum!

I was looking for simple chocolate pie that was more than just pudding in a crust. This recipe is fabulous and easy. I used dark chocolate pudding and french vanilla cool whip for the filling and a chocolate cookie crust. My fiance loved it and so did I. Thanks!

Delicious!  The only thing that I changed was that I used a pre-made Oreo cookie crust.  It was sooo easy and everyone raved about it.  I will absolutely make this again!

Excellent recipe!  Easy to make and very tasty.  I made a second pie with fat free milk, sugar free pudding, and fat free Cool Whip that tasted just as good.

This recipe is easy and super yummy!  I love finding a good basic recipe like this one that you can expand on and add your own personal touches to.  I followed a previous posters suggestion and added Oreos to the pudding and topped with crushed Oreos and Oreo halfs.  My whole family raved and thought I had spent a lot more time on than I had.  Will definitely make this many times to come.

This was a tasty twist on pudding pie but essentially thats all it is--pudding and cool whip. An easy, chocolatey dessert but nothing spectacular.

I just made the pie.  It looks really good, but we haven't eaten it yet.  I just wanted to recommend that you make sure to use the regular CHOCOLATE pudding mix, as the recipe indicates.  I mistakenly used the CHOCOLATE FUDGE pudding mix and there are lots of lumps.  I'm sure it will taste find, but the appearance leaves something to be desired.  :)  I'm sure we will still enjoy eating it.  Also, I used homemade whipped cream, as Cool Whip has oil in it.  I don't feel comfortable serving that to my family.

Very easy to make, tasty, and it looks appealing. I used a regular pie crust (pre-baked) and topped the pie with bittersweet chocolate shavings.

I wanted a chocolate pie that wasn't too involved. This was a nice change from the boring old pudding pie. And besides being pretty, the layers keep the chocolate pudding from getting that funky film on top. Super easy.

5 stars for appearance, 4 stars for taste.  The pudding had little grandules remaining in in it no matter how much I mixed it.  Tasted light and chocolaty though.  The kids loved it with a crushed heath bar on top.

My wife was perusing the cake recipes for weeks when she stumbled across this recipe in her hunt for her birthday cake. I'd offered to make one and she chose this instead...what a surprise! It ended up being much easier than I had thought it'd be and was a hit. I used a shortbread crust and used choc. sprinkles instead. This one is a keeper.

This pie was good, and the presentation really looked like I put hours into it. Next time I would cut back on the cool whip- it overpowered the pie. This is a great dessert for any occasion.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I added crushed Oreos to the Cool Whip/pudding layer and added more to the top.  I didn't make a layer of just cool whip since I don't like it much.  This was gone in seconds at the party and people thought I bought it.  Will definitely make again.

With all of the rave reviews, I was expecting something a little more unique in flavor. But it's essentially just pudding. I used crushed oreos to make the crust, put it in a springform pan, then after the first pudding layer I put whole oreos around the edge, then finished the layers. Topped with mini chocolate chips instead of shavings. After removing the ring from the pan, the pie looked beautiful. So presentation was great, taste was just average. Still yummy though, if you like chocolate pudding!

Very good, I used a regular pie crust instead of graham cracker and mixed some candy bar chunks into the second layer.  It is a very fluffy and flimsy, I was hoping for a firmer texture.  I tried freezing it, but it got too hard.

Great recipe!!  Very easy, fast, and delicious.  The recipe is also flexible -- which I like.  I didn't have 2 pkgs of chocolate pudding mix, so I used 1 pkg of chocolate pudding mix + 1 pkg of white chocolate pudding mix which I had.  I also didn't have chocolate graham cracker crust, so I used the crust that I had -- regular Pillsbury pie crust (baked first before filling).  The pie had a good texture and was very yummy :)

What's not to like? The kids devoured it and even though I'm not a sweet freak, I really love pudding and this was great. I just bought myself a "microplane" and used it to grate the chocolate for the top of the pie. Terrific tool, terrific pie. Thanks Krissy!

This was a good basic easy recipe. However, the pudding came out hard to spread and the Keeblee ready made graham cracker crust crumbled really easy. I will stick to making my own crust. The pie flavor was good though.

Made it as directed.  Used a store bought Oreo crumb crust and topped with mini chocolate chips instead of shavings.  It was easy to make and looked nice, but, as other reviewers said, the flavor was OK but not spectacular.

I agree with the reviews saying that this pie is nothing out of the ordinary. I've made this basic pie several times, but I always added something extra to it, like chocolate chips or nuts to make it extra special. This is a good basic recipe, but make sure you dazzle it up with your own amazing ingredients.

This was great! I added a tablespoon of caramel-flavored coffee (raided a K-cup!) to the middle layer and it was great. Highly recommend!

I made this and it was amazing! As a twist, I also melted a king size candy bar and layered it on the bottom of the crust (someone else did this), then melted 1/2 cup of peanut butter and layered it on top of that, then did a layer of the pudding, then mixed another 1/2-3/4 cup of melted peanut butter in WITH the pudding and whipped cream and layered that on, then topped with whipped cream - so it ends up being 5 layers with a subtle peanut butter flavor. I also used a regular extra large graham cracker crust. Delish!

What an easy and delish pie. I used a regular pie crust as well and mine turned out great. I had no problem with the layering and it was not too liquidy.

This came out terribly. I used all the exact ingredients recommended and I had way too much soupy pudding to even fit in the crust.  I can make cheesecakes from scratch, but this was a disaster.  Ugh.

Really good & simple pie. It looks as good as it tastes. I did mine with a traditional pie crust & got raves. Thanks!

This was so nice and easy to make especially on a hot summer day. Next time I will cut back to 1 oz of whipped cream to be added to the second half of the pudding. Other wise - this got very high marks from my significant other and my family. Thank you.
I am also going to try this with Butterscotch pudding.

I only rated this 3 stars because it was just an average dessert. I didn't expect anything outstanding and its a good thing. My husband wanted a pie like this so I made it for him but I will only make it again if he requests it. Tasted like pudding on graham crackers. Nothing special, just ordinary.
