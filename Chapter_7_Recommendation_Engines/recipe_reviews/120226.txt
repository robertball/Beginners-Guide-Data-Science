I made this tonight and with only a few changes, LOVED it! Used fresh spinach that I sauteed with a little garlic and olive oil. Squeezed all the liquid out. Made the sauce as in the recipe, only adding a couple of tablespoons more parmesan. Used one cup of sauce in the spinach and the other half cup to cover the fish (tilapia, by the way. Worked great!). Did use a bit of Old Bay on the fish, too. Baked at 400 for about 25 minutes to get a bit of browning. Seriously, made both my husband and I think it was a "restaurant" dish!! Will so definitely make this again!

Given the number of comments that this was bland, I decided to use this recipe as a starting point and doctor it up. I laid a bed of cooked, buttered rice in the baking dish, followed by only one package of spinach to which I added sauteed shallots, garlic, and lemon zest. I used halibut filets and seasoned them well with "pepato," an Italian fish seasoning which is a blend of sea salt, pepper, and orange and lemon zest. I used heavy cream rather than milk for the sauce, and used no flour--I just simmered the cream with a little white wine, and in additon to the Parmesan I added about 2 c. of shredded, sharp Cheddar.  I thought all these additions for flavor would make a huge difference...but it was still boring.

I used this recipe as a guideline to duplicate a dish my Husband and I had in a restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland that we LOVED! I did make changes, so the 4 star rating is for that reason.  I used a lg. bag of fresh spinach ( approx 9 oz. ) and sauteed' it with 3 cloves of sliced garlic til the spinach was 'just' wilted and drained well in a colander. Also blotted out as much liquid as possible between paper towels, chopped and added 1/4 cup grated Parm. cheese to the filling.   I followed the Bernaise Sauce to the letter with the exception of 1/4 of Parm. Cheese, and Smoked Paprika.    In a baking dish coated with Olive Oil, I placed each fillet and filled it with the Spinach/garlic mix and rolled the fish gently around the stuffing.  After all the fillets were rolled, I topped with the Sauce and baked according to the directions in this recipe. 20-25 mins.  I think this presentation is alittle nicer to the eye and it was very close to the wonderful dish we enjoyed in Baltimore.   The only thing I might try next time, is to add Lump Blue Crabmeat to the Spinach filling.  Overall a very delicate dish and has many possibilities for variation.

very good recipe for a quick & easy meal.
I varied it a little bit and used 2 medium shallots and one clove of garlic in place of the 3T of plain chopped onion.
I also upped the Parmesean to about 1/4 c.
Just delicious !! ( and I just ate some leftovers for lunch and they were awesome also )

Good easy recipe.  I used a mix of perch and tilapia because it's what I had.  The sauce would be a little bland as written, so I added about 1.5 tsp of Old Bay seasoning.  I omitted the nutmeg and pepper because they are ingredients in the OB seasoning.  I also added a few TBL of parmesan to the sauce...YUM!!!

Used Tilapia instead of Flounder and it was great.  Expect any mild white flesh fish would work.  Used Half the fish and half the spinach since I was cooking for 2, but the sauce looked so good I made all of it. Had about twice as much sauce for the fish and spinach as called for.   Cooked the spinach in boiling water for a few minutes before putting in the baking dish. Took half the sauce and mixed it with the spinach in the bottom of the baking dish, topped with fish (sprinkled a little, maybe 1/8 tsp, cayenne pepper on the fish) then the rest of the sauce on top of that with the cheese and paprika.  Turned out very good.  With the cayenne  pepper and extra sauce, it definitely was not bland at all. Will make this keeper again.

We enjoyed this recipe! It was a little like stuffed flounder, without the manual stuffing part. The parmesean cheese complements the fish perfectly.

Easy to prepare this recipe however husband who was dying for me to make this was a bit disappointed. He found it to be a little bland, missing something for sure. After reading other reviews, he agreed that sauce being seperate from spinach really made the dish a bit off balance. Perhaps if you could mix the spinach and sauce together? We also thought maybe a little cajun spice would add to the flavor a bit. We will definitely make again, just with a few alterations. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe for dinner using some of the suggestion of other members, such as doubling the spices, shallots & garlic clove instead of onion, 1/4 cup parmesan (mixed some with the sauce and sprinkled some on top), and 1 pkg of spinich. The fish I used was pollack filets. First of all, it needs to bake longer. I let it bake for 22 minutes and the fish wasn't completely done. I also thought the dish was too bland. I will try it one more time, but will bake it for at least 30-35 minutes. Not sure yet what I'll do to spruce up the flavor.

We enjoyed the simplicity and taste of this dish but thought the sauce was a little flat and needed about 1 T. more onion and a little more salt to heighten the flavor. Overall it was very good and I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.

ok, so i really altered the recipe (go ahead, complain about my review :)!!!) I chose not to make the roux-based sauce, since it seemed to add the bulk of the calories to this recipe, and most reviewers complained it was bland.  so i laid the spinach (fresh, not frozen) in the baking dish and topped it with the fish.  i seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic (no nutmeg).  i sprinkled the top with parmesan and a little bit of mozzarella cheese, and baked like this.  once it was out of the oven, i topped it with a fresh tomato salsa (chopped cherry tomatoes, basil, oregano, and minced onion and garlic). suprisingly for something so simple, it tasted quite good! thanks for a great idea!

I really liked this. I made a few changes though. First, instead of plain spinach, I used creamed spinach because that was all I had. In addition to the other ingredients, I also added lemon grass and lemon juice, garlic, and chopped green onions to the sauce. It gave it a nice flavor. In addition to sprinkling the fillets with paprika, I also sprinkled with dried spices (oregano, dill, and parsley) and cayenne pepper powder.

I used ginger in place of nutmeg, thickened the sauce with additional cheese and sprinkled Season-All instead of paprika. That works well for us with brown rice and veggies for a nice, light meal.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did substitute olive oil for the butter but kept everything else the same.  I added some garlic at the end of cooking the onions and added a generous sprinkle of Tuscan Sunset blend (Penzey's) to the sauce.  I had to prepare this in advance so I could come home a pop it in the oven.  I made sure my spinach was very dry and also dried my fillets, which had been frozen.  Very, very good.  My 14 year old daughter who is "not a fish person" said it was "pretty good"  which is high praise from her!

I followed the recipe fairly closely. I listened to some reviewers and mixed most of the Bernaise in with the spinach and then a tiny bit on top. In an attempt to avoid blandness, I sprinkled the magic spice mixture, used for veggies, chicken, fish, plain pasta in our house, on the fish before the sauce and it definitely was not bland. Lemon Pepper Seasoning (no salt)- it's amazing what it does to broccoli!

Really tasty! Can't wait for my guy to catch another flounder to try it again. My variations: Added a bag of 10 min cooked rice with some spray butter as a bottom layer and halved the spinach since there were only 2 of us. Added garlic powder and some pepper to the spinach to add more flavor. Also, added about 2 tbsp parmesan cheese to the sauce to richen the flavor. Last but not least Old Bay was sprinkled on fish before pouring sauce and on top! Viola. Very tasty and healthy! This is a keeper.

Really good.  I halved the recipe because there are only 2 of us and it was still a lot of food.  I used some of the suggestions and added onion and garlic.  Will use this one again, maybe try snapper next time.

This recipe wasnt bad...I wasnt super impressed with it either. I followed exactly. My bf enjoyed more than I did but the only difference was I used Turbot instead of flounder (in the same family, usually compaired to flounder or halibut). It was preseasoned Turbot so that could have been why...I thought it was a tad on the saltly side. I loooove salt so if I say its too salty it probably is. Salt isnt something I am sensitive too. Might make again but with fish that isnt preseasoned. Oh, used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

First I added 3 cups of cooked rice to the bottom of the pan & then spread the spinach (only used 1 pkg) on top. Used shallots instead of onion.  Added 1 clove garlic. I increased the nutmeg to 1/4 t. I also added 1/4 cup white wine to the sauce & placed half the sauce on top of the rice/spinach & the other half on top of the fillets. Was ok, but won't make again.

my husband and i love this!  i've always used one box of fresh spinach & i've never used the spices, although one of these days i might get around to it.  it's a great way to eat your spinach!  i like to serve it with some pan cooked tomatoes to add some acid.

We really liked this recipe.  I used fresh spinach which I just put down in the 13x9 pan.   In place of the chopped onion, I used 1 tbsp of tastefully simple onion onion.    I forgot to put the paprika and cheese on it before I cooked it so I would imagine that would make it even more delicious.   will definitely make again.

No blandness here. Only thing I changed was fresh instead of frozen spinach.  I added a bit more chopped onion and Parmesan cheese, simply because I really like the taste of both (plus I rarely measure my ingredients). Also, added sauteed fresh mushrooms be cause i had them and they make everything better for my fam. baked for about 2 minutes extra for the browning and it was great! Hubby gave it ten thumbs up and will be taking for lunch.

Made the changes that BUBINK suggested -adding even more onion because I love onions! Wow! This was an excellent dinner. I used Cod because I had it on hand and had fresh spinach to use up. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Tried this tonight and it was not very good. The sauce turned out good but the fish was very mushy when I took it out of the oven. I don't know if it was because I used arrow tooth flounder or if I used fresh spinach or maybe another factor. I won't try this recipe again.

Very bland... made it exactly as recipe says, and the spinach tasted like seaweed with the juice from the fish in it. Couldn't bring myself to eat the leftover, will adjust the recipe quite a bit and try again... maybe.

I prepared this recipe on a bed of 1 cup of cooked brown rice, sprinkled with diced onion...... the fish is so tender, this recipe easily can pass as what my family calls "restaurant food"..... a keeper!

Delicious! I made a few slight modifications. Like other reviewers, I sauteed the spinach in garlic. I added a dusting of cayenne pepper to give it some punch. I also sprinkled some lemon juice over the fish. Lastly, when the fish was almost done I put the oven on broil for 2 minutes to give the top a nice crunch. Outstanding!

I made quite a few changes.  I used fresh kale, because I had it on hand.  I sauteed an onion and the kale in olive oil, then added a few cloves of garlic to that.  I made the roux with 3T butter and 3T flour, then added 2% milk (again, had it on hand).  Followed recipe for salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  I added a lot more parmesan - probably almost a cup total.  I mixed half w/ the kale, put the fish on that, and put the rest of the sauce on top of that.  Baked at 350 for 20min.  Turned out really good!  I'm going to mix the leftovers with some small pasta and make a pasta bake of sorts.

Thank you for the great recipe.  Followed sauce as written, however poured it over fresh spinach and placed fillets on top.  Seasoned fillets with Old Bay and covered with grated cheese. Delicious.

Excellent recipe..although I drained the spinach quite a bit it was still a little mushy for my taste. I might try fresh spinach next time..will definitely do it again.

This was very good. My husband loved it. I did make a few modifications. I prefer fresh spinach. I eliminated spraying the dish with oil...not necessary. Especially since I used fresh spinach and covered the bottom of the dish with a thick layer (it helped to steam the fish and keep it moist). I also sprinkled the fish LIGHTLY with old bay on each side, then put on top of the spinach. I used green onions vs. regular yellow onion. I also added only about half of the sauce when I baked it. I put a thin layer over the fish and the spinach. It was enough to preserve the moistness in the fish and to add flavor to the spinach. The rest I served on the side.   I served the fish and spinach/sauce over steamed brown organic rice with the extra sauce on the side (which my husband added freely). This is a keeper and could be used with MANY types of white fish.

I thought this had a very good flavor. The only thing that kept this from getting a five star review is the fact the flounder turned out really mushy. I'm not sure how to fix that.

Make the recipe just like it says except- add cayenne pepper to taste to the sauce, and sprinkle with about 3 pieces crunched up bacon before baking. 

Hubby and I both LOVED it. I've made it per instructions once, and made these changes this time. PERFECT.

Sorry, but I did not like this recipe at all.  It had no flavor, and the spinach seemed to overwhelm the flounder.  My kids ended up eating canned Ravioli instead.  I will not try this one again.

This recipe turned our night into a Dominoe's night.  We love fish and spinach so I had thought it was a no brainer.  First of all, cook time was actually over double what was recommended.  After 40 minutes of cooking the fish was still gooey and the sauce was more like country gravy.

This dish is delicious and easy to make. I do, however find that the frozen spinach can come out a bit wet if you dont get all the water out... so fresh sauteed spinach is an option. I add extra garlic and parmesan to taste.

Loved this recipe I cut it in half to serve two and used snapper fillets.   I  used fresh spinach, sauteed with one clove of garlic in a little olive oil, and added 1/4 c. of the sauce to the spinach before placing it in the baking dish.  I, too, added a little Bay Seasoning instead of nutmeg and thought the flavor overall was delicious.  I baked it 25 minutes at 400 degrees F and it browned nicely.  This makes a nice presentation and I will serve it again often.

I used salmon because it's all I had, then tripled the recipe. I agree that it was a little bland but it was a base. Will use it as a base from now on.

Made this last night for my husband and I and we thought it was awesome. I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little and also mixed the spinach with the sauce before spooning over the fish. I baked it over top of rice and served it as a casserole. We will def. make this again.

After reading reviews, I adjusted this slightly.  For the bed, I sauteed onions/garlic, tossed in fresh chopped spinach at the end.  I topped the fillets with Hollandaise, fine bread crumbs and parmesan.  Also rubbed the fillets with sea salt, pepper, lemon zest.  Was awesome!

thought the nutmeg made the sauce awesome. Little runny on the sauce next time may use a little more flour or less milk. Very tasty and inexpensive.

My hubby and I really enjoyed using fish this way.  We like fish, but it gets a little old just throwing it out on the grill!  I do think that there was a LOT of spinach.  Maybe next time I will cut out some spinach.  (Limit it to a pound - like the fish?)  I really enjoyed the sauce that was poured over the fish.  I may actually use that for other recipes as well.  It was hard to get the sauce & the spinach together...b/c the sauce was right on top of the fish and the spinach underneath.  So, if the sauce didn't touch the spinach, it tasted a little bland - being JUST spinach, ya know?  Not a bad recipe by any means...but I think next time I will make some adjustments.

I've made this twice.  It's creamy and a bit bland, but sometimes that's just what you're in the mood for.  It does seem to take a bit longer to get it to cook all the way, and it is kind of soupy.  I'm not sure I'll be making it again.  I much prefer stuffed flounder.

I made this for my parents and they seemed to enjoy it a great deal.  However, i doubled up on the spices (including the onion) and i still thought it needed more spice.
