Well, what can I say? I am not a sweet eater so I have little to no experience making candy and I messed this recipe up or not depending how you look at it. In my defense, the instructions are not real clear  as far as what setting the stove needs to be at while you are getting it up to 244 degrees. I dropped mine down to medium heat but after 20 minutes of constant stirring it was not darkening at all so I bumped the heat up to medium-high. Bottom line is that I ended up with toffee which was my own rookie mistake I am sure. I say mistake but I was informed by the husband that he prefers toffee over caramels and that this was the best "toffee" he had ever had. I plan on trying this again to see if I can get it right .
