Simple substitute for big Reuben sandwiches. Been making this with shredded Swiss for awhile. Assembly note: much easier to place ingredients on TOP third of wraps. Fold back towards you once, fold 2 sides in and over, then roll again back towards you until tight. And don't overstuff - there's plenty of flavor here.

I had to do these twice...because the first time I pre-made them and put them in the fridge.  They all stuck together.  Delicious when done fresh tho!

Just wanted to put my 2 cents in. I dislike reviews that don't follow the recipe. That being said, I used pastrami & Swiss cheese. Very good. My son loved these. Next time I will add some caraway seeds.

Very tasty. I put dijon mustard inside, and used swiss instead of gruyere. Then fried it in coconut oil.

One word: Scrumptious! I did use Swiss because Gruyere is too expensive. I love me some Reuben's but not a fan of bread so these were even better than a Reuben to me. I served them with a grainy mustard dipping sauce but I'm sure Thousand Island would be good too.
