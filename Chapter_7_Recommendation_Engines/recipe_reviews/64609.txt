Went great for a Cab wine tasting party. Used Vidalia onions and a refrigerated pizza crust (Walmart brand). Cooked on a pizza stone and added fresh ground black pepper.  Perfect appetizer.

Oh wow- this was a great recipe.  My picky husband and I both loved it.  I added some chicken browned in garlic and olive oil to the top and we both said it is definately a keeper.  It was quick and easy and had alot of taste.

If i could give this recipe 6 stars i would.  I LOVED IT.  I now cook my onions in chicken boullion to add flavor in many of my old favorites.  This is one of the best pizzas i have ever made.

This turned out better than I expected. Ok, so nothing will ever beat our favorite pepperoni/bacon/red sauce pizza, but this was really good for a change. I was unsure about the walnutes, and used far less than the recipe stated - if I were to make this again, I would go with the the full amount, perhaps even more. Thanks!

This makes a fabulous appetizer!  I used a crescent dough (no pizza crust) and cut them into small squares.  Wonderful, sweet taste-loved the mixture of cheese, nuts, and onions!

This was sooo yummy;  not good for the kiddies, unless they aren't picky;  the flavors of the onion, blue cheese and walnuts are fantastic together!  I used an unbaked pizza dough out of the can, which was a mistake - it didn't cook through very well in the center;  next time I will make sure to grab the prebaked dough.

I made this for dinner last night and loved it. Instead of 3 medium onions, I sliced up 1 large Vidalia onion. I also increased the mozzarella cheese to 1 cup to help "glue" everything onto the crust.
