Just followed this recipe and I am not a baker and have only made 1 crust from scratch 20 years ago but I like a good challenge. Also I am gluten intolerant, could not locate the Quinoa flour at my local grocery but did find a GF flour from beans and only had about 5 ingredients, watch out for too many other ingredients on so called GF items.

 I always follow a recipe to the letter on the first try and this was to die for, the instructions are a little vague was not sure if I should cook the broccoli before baking so I did not and was perfect. Also called for 2 large green onions and I found these huge green onions from mexico which were the size of a small white onion...yum also used brown mushrooms recipe does not specify so you can get creative. 

Crust was super easy to make had to add more water to get proper moisture content. My boyfriend is french and his mother makes the best crust on various dishes and he said this recipe his mother would love so was a nice confirmation!

Aside from having to cook it for twice as long as the recipe called for, and the crust still winding up seemingly uncooked under the egg mixture, and the egg mixture itself being undercooked in the middle, the flavor was good. I did have to modify it slightly for my son with a cow milk allergy, so I used goats milk instead of cream, and goats cheese. I also didn't have broccoli and mushrooms on hand, so I used fresh baby spinach and bell peppers. I cooked the peppers like it called for for the mushrooms, and used the same quantities the recipe called for, for everything. Made the crust exactly as recipe says. Not sure where I went wrong... but hey, it did taste good once it finally got cooked enough, after 65 minutes. So...

Really just rating the crust as I did my own filling. I've never worked with quinoa flour before so I followed the recipe to the letter. It was great! The only thing I'll do differently is to up the amount of flour as I would have been ok with it being a tad (not much) thicker. Did need more then 2 tbls of water, no biggy. I'm thinking with some herbs this could also make a great wheat free pizza crust. Thanks Drew!
