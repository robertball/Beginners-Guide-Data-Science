Very nice. Based on previous reviews, I used only 2 granny smith apples and threw in a chopped onion as well as used about 1/2 the butter. Really enjoyed it, thanks!

I went the sausage/egg noodle main dish route, using "banger" style English sausage, which seems to match the cabbage and apples well. It all could use a bit more flavor though. Perhaps cooking the sausage first in the same pan and using some of the fat in place of some of the butter would give it more flavor.

This was easy. There was nothing wrong with this I just didn't like the taste too much apple for me.

I love cabbage more than any vegetable and this is the best recipe ever. (Without the apples of course) Not an apple fan.

I found this recipe to be easy and very tasty. Even my 3 year old ate it! I originally worried about the taste of vinegar but it boils down, and the brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness. This is one of my favorite recipes now.

This went well with us today.  I used lemon juice instead of vinegar and left out the apples by choice.

Very good tasting...but the apples make the difference! I used a tart apple...Granny Smith...and it really offset the more milder taste of the cabbage. A big hit!

I loved this, hubs not as much.  But I love sauerkraut and cabbage soups, etc. so this was right up my alley.  Couldn't be easier.  And almost turns out like a warm sauerkraut.  I added a bit of onion, garlic powder and pinch of red pepper flake. This was the cabbage dish I served with my re-done St. Paddy's dinner - (Oven Steamed Corned beef and garlic roasted red potatoes)  Best St. Patrick's meal we've ever had.

I found this dish pretty bland. I used apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar, and I used 2 apples instead of 3 based on previous reviews. If I make it again I will try it with 3 apples and cut them in to smaller bits.

The cabbage lovers in my family definitely thoguht this was a great recipe. I used only 2 apples per someone else's review.. next time I would use 3 since I'm learning to like cabbage.  I made it lighter calorie by using a Splenda brown sugar blend and a 50/50 butter/Smart Balance mix.

As others had suggested, I used granny smith apples, this recipe is delicious! I was really scared of that first bite, u could think u would taste the vinegar but you don't at all, the apples give this a nice bite. Great side dish, i'll be using this again!

I just harvested a large amount of cabbage from my garden and was looking for something different but quick. This was delish!  I served this with slices of pork tenderloin on top and it was a great pairing.

My husband and I liked this recipe, but my kids weren't crazy about it. (What do THEY know?) I used a gala apple, which added a nice sweetness. I cut back on the butter a bit, which didn't seem to affect the final product. I would make this again and force the kids to eat it.

Ah yes, long ago I learned that cooked cabbage loses it's smell and mellows it's flavour when a little acid (tomatoes for example) has been added.

I made this last night to use a cabbage I got in the St. Patrick's Day parade. Used two gala apples and cut the butter to 2 tablespoons. That said, simple and delicious! The cabbage stayed a bit crunchy, but that's how I like it. Thanks!

Good but unusually.  I used granny smith apples, and they became the predominant taste as the cabbage cooked down.  I also halved the butter and it was fine.

I love this recipe, simple and easy. I like to increase the vinegar by quite a bit, and the sugar a little bit. Maybe 3 Tablespoons each, so it's sweet and tangy.

My whole family loved this recipe. Even the picky teenager! We did make the main dish change-up and added a little sauteed onion. The variations are endless!! And I'm off to the kitchen, 'cause we are having again tonight....yippee!!

I made no changes to this recipe except I used coleslaw mix for out-of-the-bag convenience.  I thought it was a perfect side dish for BBQ pork sandwiches, and a quick way to serve both fruit and veggies.

This was so delicious.  I made it with Roast Pork with Maple and Mustard Glaze (from this site) and it was a perfect compliment.  I used 3 large Granny Smith apples and followed the recipe exactly.  If anything, the butter could be cut down but it was delicious the way it was.  Not too apple-y to me.

it was a little too sweet for me. I think I'd only use 2 apples and a little less brown sugar and butter next time

The only substitution I made is I didn’t peel the apples. This is absolutely delicious! I think it looks pretty with the color of the apples.

Disappointing.  I was (am) looking for quick & easy healthy recipes.  This seemed to be a candidate, but I found it less than satisfying.  I used a bag of coleslaw mix, 3 granny smith apples, regular brown sugar, regular butter.  In my opinion, granny smiths are on the tart side (I probably will avoid them in the future).  Perhaps I should have added a bit more brown sugar to this dish.  Also, I missed the instructions in the beginning about the sausage & noodles.  I think the sausage would make a big difference in this dish.  I think this is one of those dishes that you have to play with - adjusting the ingredients according to your taste.  Not sure at this point if I would try it again.

Made it a little spicier with shallots, garlic and green onions. Used red wine vinegar instead.
Good basic recipe.

I must say at first I don't like cabbage very much.  However, this was delicious.  I would make it again

Excellent recipe and not too bad for the arteries if you don't eat this for lunch every day.  We've made a very similar  recipe for years in our family, only without the apple.  Now I couldn't imagine cooking this up without it!  We slice the apples thin like for pie, it seems to fit the texture of the cabbage (and noodles, when we add those in).  Our daughter has been a vegetarian for years, so when she's home we simply put enough aside to suit her fancy and then add sausage to our side of the mix and sauté it all up for a bit longer to meld the flavors together.  Typically add a dash or two of celery seed and sometimes thinly sliced onion.  No fresh onion?  Don't be afraid to use onion powder.  My daughter eschews the idea of any fresh replacement but she doesn't have kids of her own yet and has never faced that nightly challenge of having to whip up dinner magic with a few pennies and a prayer!  Quick, simple and versatile recipe as is or with embellishments.

I don't use sugar, so used a little bit of agave and a little bit of honey instead.  Had only one apple, so added some homemade applesauce, to sub for the 2 extra apples.  Cooked everything in grapeseed oil (don't use butter).    And I had some extra greens of various kinds, and added them to the mix.  DELICIOUS!!!!!

We cooked up some bacon first, and used the fat instead of part of the butter. That was pretty good, but next time we will use another apple and replace the brown sugar with Maple Syrup. This is fun! This recipe is going to evolve at my house.
