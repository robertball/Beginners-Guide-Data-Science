This made a yummy Oyster Stew for Christmas Eve.  Hubby especially loved the huge oysters.  I thought it would have been better if they had been chopped, but he said then they wouldn't really taste like oysters.  The only change we would suggest is that you should add a little flour to the sauteed vegatable mixture (mirpoix) to make it into not quite a rue, this would help the fat blend better into the stew.  Cook the veggies down until they are almost transluscent, add about a teaspoon of flour and cook until the flour is no longer raw (a minute or two at most), then continue with the recipe as written.

This is very good.  I add a dash of salt and a lot of freshly ground black pepper.  The hot sauce makes this great.  This is very good with some small diced potatoes as well.

I agree it is colorful, you can leave out the red peppers, they were added for color for Christmas.  Thanks for the reviews.

very colorful, but too different that no one wanted to touch it; they all went for the chili and chicken noodle soup, instead.

Very easy and good although next time I'm going to add more hot sauce. I couldn't taste the hot sauce at all.

I added 1T of flour for each Tablespoon  of butter. A thin white sauce made this perfect. Also added the oysters before the cream. I don't like boiling the cream. After adding the cream, I turned off heat as soon as it started to bubble.

Very yummy on a cold day.  I left out the red peppers since they are basically in there for Christmas colors, all six of us loved it.  Instead of adding two dashes of hot sauce to the entire soup we did ours individually in our bowls and it was delicious.

Taste great but I did not have half and half I used cream of chicken soup with milk. Also did not have hot sauce and used cayenne pepper instead. I advise cooking fresh oysters and chopping them before adding to pot. I added whole oysters (large) and had to cut them in the bowl after serving...messy
