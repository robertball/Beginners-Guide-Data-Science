This recipe just doesn't work for me.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out just an oily liquid, so I threw it out and started over, this time watching the video and following it exactly.  It looked ok when I first started pulsing the stick blender, but when it was all mixed in it was just oily liquid again.

I never made mayonnaise before in my life so after reading several of the other recipes and ratings, I decided to be on the safe side, made half of the recipe and used a whole egg instead of just the yolk. I also did what other recipes recommended and blended everything except the oil first and then slowly poured the oil in as the blender was running. I first poured in about a quarter of the oil, not wanting to waste it if this was not going to work and kept running the blender. At first it did seem like an oily mess but I kept going for another couple of minutes and suddenly it started getting thicker. Sort of like whipping cream - just when you want to give up, it gets thick. And then I poured the rest of the oil in slowly making sure that it became incorporated into the cream before adding more. The result is thick, creamy and yummy. I am impressed. So, don't give up, this is a good recipe. Next time I'll try it without the egg white.

If your mayonnaise didn't set up and you have a runny mess, just remove contents from container and add another egg yolk. Now add the runny mayo back in and once again start your stick blender and it will set up.

I have been using this method to make homemade mayonnaise for years.  The stick blender makes this a breeze!  I don't usually add the mustard though.   It is amazing how fast this comes together.   GREAT METHOD!

this was delicious! and so easy! i used an immersion blender. and a couple of changes...a whole egg (organic from our happy local chickens), and only one cup of oil all together. i used avocado oil and it's perfect! tangy & creamy. i made it in a pint size wide mouth canning jar and it fills up about 3\4 full. perfect! I'm never buying mayo again!

I followed the video perfectly, and still got left with a mass of whitish colored oil. It would not blend. I used the  measuring cup the stick blender came with.

Just made this, it turned out perfectly! The secret is using fresh eggs. I am talking straight off the farm if you can get them. I tried making mayo with store bought eggs and it was a disaster.  I used a blender and slowly drizzled my oil in.

Thanks once again Chef John.  My grandma always had home-made mayonnaise.  She would only use Mazola corn oil and just added salt and lemon juice. She also used a hand mixer and drizzled in the oil. I thought hers was the best but this is much better. I used 1/2 corn oil and 1/2 olive oil.  The stick blender is much quicker and there is no splatter.  You are absolutely right there is nothing better than a slice of bread with a big slather of home-made mayo. Try this recipe. You won't be sorry.

Kept all ingredients as stated in Chef John's  recipe, minus the vegetable oil. The mixture and consistency came out beautifully.  I'm from Louisiana and this is exactly how most Louisianians make their home made mayonnaise. However, I only had extra virgin olive oil on hand and made it entirely with that, and the finished product had an AWEFUL bitter taste.  My husband gave it a small finger taste and gagged. We could not eat it and unfortunately had to throw it out. I was SO disappointed. NEVER, EVER use EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL when making this. It will ruin everything for you. Still, the recipe earned four stars by me since it still came out very well. I will make this again using plain olive oil next time. Thank you Chef John.

I followed this recipe to a T including using the same emulsion blender as Chef John. Lol! Anyway I'm not quite sure why others had issues with this recipe but it was perfect for me. Just before using Chef John's recipe I must say I tried another recipe and ended up dumping the whole thing as it was awful and it tasted like oil. This one had extra ingredients such as the white wine vinegar and I used the French imported Beaufor vinegar too, sugar and olive oil. Again this recipe was perfect. It had just a little bit of a tangy taste to it from the vinegar and also sweetness from the sugar a perfect balance. I did not have any problem with the blending. It thickened up just as Chef John showed in his video. I would highly recommend Chef John's recipe for homemade mayonnaise.

I have made mayonnaise with a very similar recipe.  I am baffled why several people have oily messes.  I have given the recipe to friends who don't even cook and they have made it.  I don't even mix stuff first.  I dump everything into a tall narrow bottom container, turn on the stick blender until I see white and slowly pull up the stick blender.  It has never failed.  Now brown sugar fudge, anything with a candy thermometer, I've tried several times and failed with that.  Grandma on the other hand, could look at the boiling sugar and tell.  It all looked the same to me.

This is like  a crazy magic trick. I didn't think I had a prayer of finding my immersion blender because I've moved a gazillion times so I tried this in my blender.  Poured the oil in excruciatingly slowly and it turned to slop.  Dumped it down the drain.  Found immersion blender, and presto!!  5 pulses and a delightful concoction emerged!  I could really taste the EVOO so next time, I think I'll use a lighter olive oil.  Used this to make Chef John's crab cakes and a remoulade sauce.  I did use whole eggs due to first attempt but will try next time with just the yolks.  My husband nearly licked the plate!  Thanks!!

I didn't have any trouble getting this to thicken up.  I blended the egg yolks slightly before adding the oil which I've read helps to warm up the egg to allow the yolks to absorb the oil.  As well, I added the oil a little at a time.  I think I ended up using only 1 cup total of oil (I mixed canola and olive oil).  It is a bit bland...next time I would up the  salt to 1 full tsp and add a tsp of sugar.  I also subbed the white wine vinegar with regular vinegar which may have affected the flavour.  It's probably better with the white wine vinegar.

There is seriously something wrong with this recipe. It's not my first time making mayonnaise, in fact i love my home made mayo with fresh eggs from the coop and our very own extra virgin olive oil. But this recipe wont work. No matter what i try it just keeps breaks apart just before 1 cup of oil in total. Stick blender didnt work, my usual old fashion way didnt work... I am really mad... Sorry.

Salty, slimy, separated mess. During the first year of our marriage, my husband made the most amazing mayo. The following week, I tried the exact same recipe and came out with a salty, slimy, etc. mess. I've tried making mayo periodically throughout the 30 years since he died. and it always turns out the same: me driving the eight miles to the grocery store for Hellman's. If heaven had email, I'd find out his secret for making mayonnaise. . . well, along with a few other mysteries he left behind. ;) Here I thought Chef John could finally unlock the mystery; alas, it was not to be.

Oily mess and too tangy. I even went less on the lemon juice. I’m going to refrigerate to see if it solidifies. I’m going to have to find the other recipe I’ve used in the past.

Made it with the plastic blade on my food processor.  The key is pouring the oils very slowly and blending for as long as it takes to thicken.  Don’t give up!   I would like to try this with other lighter oils.  Very good and very economical.  I live in the mountains where you can’t always run to the grocery store.  Nice to know I can make my own.

I follow the video but use one whole egg plus one yolk and only 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup avocado oil. I don’t use sugar. The immersion blender method is so simple and quick. Turns out perfect every time.

Terrible runny mess both attempts with farm fresh eggs.  Adding extra yolk didn't help first batch, adding extra white didn't help second batch.   Huge waste of ingredients.

DO NOT throw away the egg whites, you're going to need them afterall.  The mayo does not come together without them.  The mayo is good, but better without the Dijon.  I make this once a week.

I (tried) to make this in a blender.  I'm with everyone else who could NOT get this to turn out.  Plus the olive oil is just a nasty alternative.  It got fed to the drain as it never emulsified--never.  10 minutes in the blender, the oil drizzled in.  Don't  bother.

Tried it twice and both times failed. I don't have an imulsion blender and I tried both the blender and the hand mixer and both times ended up with a yellow egg soup

I'm a fairly decent cook and don't get discouraged easily, so when this failed with my immersion blender, I tried a second time in my regular blender. Followed the directions *exactly*, but mine never got creamy. No idea what I could do differently... I'll have to try again another time.

I followed the recipe as Chef John directed, except I used the blender method.   The mayo came together with perfect consistency, just as Chef John said it would.   My problem is that I found it too oily tasting.   I used extra light tasting oil olive and canola oil.   After making this, I looked around for other recipes and found that the oil ratio is pretty much standard and Chef John has it spot on.   I think I've been ruined by commercial mayos.   Sorry CJ.

I tried it twice and it turned into an oily liquid each time. I added some egg white the second time, and it still stayed runny. I refrigerated the second batch for a few hours and tried it again. It was a success! It may have been the temperature of the oils.

I made a half batch because I didn't want it to spoil before I could use it all. Also, I used a whole egg instead of just the yolk and it turned out great. Good balance of flavored

I've made lots of different mayo recipes over the years but this is by far the best tasting and best consistency  of any home made mayonnaise recipe I have ever made. 
I used my hand  beaters and drizzled the oil in, didn't try using my stick blender just because I always have used the beaters. 
The only change I made the second time I made it was to  use only vegetable oil , again just because of personal taste preference. 
I've made this  recipe probably 20 times now and used the mayo as a  spread and to make lots of tasty dips, dressings and spreads including  ranch dressing,  tartar sauce, garlic aioli, and on potato salad

I made this recipe with organic egg yolks and subbed in red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar as a flavor preference. At first, I thought it might not come together, but after a little patience with my immersion blender, it did. I like it a lot fresh, but think it is even better after refrigerating it overnight. The flavors really come together and it is just wonderful. I don't think I will be buying mayonnaise anymore, because this was surprisingly easy. I used one cup of canola oil to one half cup extra virgin olive oil. Thanks, Chef John. The use of the immersion blender is a really great innovation.

I'm giving this five stars for the ease and simplicity of this recipe. It came together just like he said it would and was the perfect viscosity for mayonnaise. As for the taste I'm sure I screwed that up myself. I decided to do half olive oil and half canola so I used 3/4 cup of each. The only Dijon I had was the grainy country style and I had no fresh lemon so I used bottled. It ended up pretty much tasting like thickened olive oil. That being said I plan on trying this again with better quality olive oil in the called for amounts and fresh lemon juice instead of bottled. It looked beautiful if a little green, ( the olive oil was very dark green) and came out perfectly thick and creamy.

Very good recipe. THE most expensive mayonnaise ever. Nowhere in the recipe or instructions (followed to a tee, 3 batches in a row), does it mention, that the egg yolks need to be at room temperature. 4th attempt, Thank You You Tube, with room temperature yolks, the tastiest Mayo ever!!!

Great recipe! Have not bought mayo since I got this recipe. It’s part of my weekly menu. Easy as long as you follow it exactly how the Chef says.
Thank you for your easy and delicious recipes.

Worked for me, although for a second it was thinking of not emulsifying. It's more clumpy (versus creamy) than the other recipe I used, more like Hellman's in texture. It is a bit 'zesty', with the wine vinegar noticaeble... I liked this, but others may want a more neutral mayo. Used avocado+olive oils. This will probably be my go-to, though I think I will try throwing in 1 clove of garlic next time.

I made it twice to be sure it wasn’t just luck the first time. The second time I used all canola oil to see if there was any difference.  Not that I noticed.  My only mistake was this time I thought I’d use a Ball jar rather than having to transfer it afterward.  When I put the stick blender in it, it started overflowing oil.  I had miscalculated the amount of ingredients + the volume of the stick blender.

I've never made mayo before. Lots of times you think you have all the ingredients but then you don't and we substitute. I had everything but the vegetable oil. I had peanut oil and extra virgin olive oil. So I used 1 cup EVOVO and 1/2 cup peanut oil.  I have chickens so my eggs were fresh. I used my stick blender which is so easy with no splatter!! At first I thought it was going to be ruined and not come together being a bit oily and not smooth looking. I sort of stirred it and lifted the stick blender and all of a sudden it worked. It wasn't as fast as in the video. It also had a greenish color like the 5th photo but it tastes really good. Next time, I will have Mazola oil and I will try it with the exact measurements Chef John recommends because I did want it to be white. I will also get a glass Ball jar and make it right in the jar. It is a bit tangy which is good, but if you wanted it like store Mayo then cut back on the vinegar and mustard. It's great like it is though. I never thought I'd eat just mayo on bread and enjoy it.  I can't wait to try it on a sandwich. Thanks Chef John!!

Made a mistake of using extra Virgin olive oil. Although I like evoo, I don't like it in my mayo. It's still good, but not exactly the taste I want. I will make again and review it again.

Love it - have made it dozens of time and always comes out perfect  - i do add 2 egg whites (whether making a single or double batch) - the key is to add the ingredients in the exact order as shown  - takes 30 seconds or less with an immersion hand blender to make the best mayo ever!

The recipe really needs to mention that everything needs to be at room temperature prior to mixing.  Also, my eggs did not emulsify because  the oil was added all at once.  It should've been added slowly, as it thickens.  As I watched a YouTube video on how to save broken mayonnaise, I was thankfully able to save all this broken mix as I started from scratch in a clean bowl and SLOWLY added this broken mixture to it.  Unfortunately it's much thicker than I needed because I ran out of oil.  Having tried it in both a blender and KitchenAid mixer, I think I will always make it in a mixer every time now so I can slowly add the oil.

I knew I bought the stick blender for a reason. I use the Cusinart container to make this and it always comes right together in a couple of minutes even using grocery store eggs. My favorite is lemon dill.

I have made this 4-5 times now  , tweaked it a bit but still turns out perfect each time. My only changes, a pinch of salt, this last time used 1 1/4 cups sunflower oil. I let everything settle a bit, then 7-8 pulses with a stick blender until I can see the mayo starting to form, then run the blender till it thickens, maybe a minute at most. Not sure why many are having issues, maybe a bit too much oil or maybe it is the olive oil. Regardless, I no longer buy store bought mayo.

This was ok, but thin. I added a whole egg to it and ran it in the blender again for several minutes to thicken it.

Worked well for me.  Made in a blender--used two whole eggs and added oil slowly as it mixed.  Ended up using almost a quarter of a cup of oil less than what the recipe called for.  Will definitely make again.

I didnt have the best of luck with this recipe. I think it was bc I didnt have the fanciest of ingredients. Im sure Chef John uses pretty nice stuff, but I just had the generic store brand stuff on hand. I would love to hear more specifics about  the ingredients he uses in his recipes. Chef John's recipes usually totally rock btw.

This is hands down the best mayo recipe ever. The secret is to add the ingredients in your bowl in the order as shown in the recipe. Here are my tips:  use the egg yolk and white; use kosher salt; use a good extra virgin olive oil and pure canola oil; use balsamic vinegar instead of white and use fresh lemon juice. Has come out perfect each of the 20+ times I’ve made it (I use an immersion hand blender but have also used a hand mixer and blender) just pulse a couple times to incorporate the ingredients and then blend until creamy.

I love this recipe. It turns out perfectly if you blend all ingredients a bit before very slowly adding in the oil.  I use a food processor and drizzle the oil in a small stream while the processor is on.  It's delicious, easy, and you know exactly what is in it, unlike commercial mayo.  Thanks Chef John!

I used grapeseed oil instead of the vegetable oil, which does not taste like traditional mayonnaise.  I, too, had trouble getting the mayonnaise to thicken up.  I followed the suggestions of others to remove the unthickened solution and add more egg yolks at the bottom, then the solution, and more egg whites = still no success.  It finally worked when I removed the solution, added 2 MORE egg yolks to the blender, and then SLOWLY dribbled in the oily solution.  Next time I will not use grapeseed oil and I will add it bit by bit into the yolk/vinegar/lemon juice mixture.

Followed the recipe exactly, but got a OVERLY liquidy mixture! Tasted like Mayo, but didn't look like it.

I made this, just as described, using my stand mixer and it came out perfectly!  I'm so happy! I tried using another recipe and it failed miserably, but Chef John saves the day again.
