this is a great recipe, and even better with real clams. Use ~ 1 lb. per person, and soak the clams in cold water sprinkled with cornmeal. The clams will 'eat' the cornmeal and spit out any sand, so you are cleaning the clams and also adding a built-in thickener to your sauce.

It was wonderfully healthy and light but not very "clammy."  We could barely find the clams in all the sauce.  Next time I'll double the clams and reduce the liquid (to add flavor but keep the moisture the same).  Good one.

A very delicious pasta dish that is also quite low-fat!  Instead of olive oil, I used cooking spray.  I cut the salt from 1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp and used just a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of 1/4 tsp.  I omitted the minced carrots, fresh parsley, and fresh basil because I did not have any.  I added 2 teaspoons of dried parsley and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano with the tomatoes.  After turning off the heat, I added some fresh snipped chives.  I will definitely make this pasta again because it is so healthy and delicious!

I thoroughly enjoyed this but hubby thought it was too much pasta, not enough sauce. I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I chopped up a can of whole, peeled tomatoes. I used a yellow red bell pepper instead of red because that's what I had. I didn't have fresh basil so I used basil in a tube (it's semi-fresh & has worked in every recipe I have tried it in...it's available in the produce department). I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried, adding it a couple of minutes before I added the clams & basil. I added a splash of white wine (about 1/2 c.) when I added the tomatoes & used 12 oz. linguine instead of fettucine. I thought it was just perfect but to accomodate my husband, next time I will decrease the pasta even more.  All the accompaniments it needed was a glass of wine, a fresh salad & a croissant.

I don't normally bother leaving reviews for anything...but I loved this recipe so much that I had to tell everyone how awesome it is.

Healthy, flavourful, and just enough spicyness...perfect!  Also, very easy to make!

loved this recipe! I used about 40 real clams that I steamed open so the recipe was sufficiently "clammy". (used the water from steaming instead of canned clam juice)All of the veggies worked really well together and it was a pretty easy recipe to follow. Needless to say my guests were all impressed by this delicious summer meal!

Although I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I'm giving it a 4 for versatility.  I used ingredients I had on hand, including zucchini and squash instead of carrots and bell pepper.  Also, I halved the recipe and used a full can of diced Italian tomatoes in lieu of fresh.  I thought the fresh basil made the dish.  I will make this again, and will try to find larger clams instead of minced.  This tasted better the next day.

Excellent!!  The flavors really blend well in this. I added a little more garlic and red pepper than the recipe called for, but other than that, no variations.

This was a hit in my house - but made pretty much as directed, 3 of us polished it off (over 9 oz. pasta) and my 14yo nephew was still hungry.  If you serve 8 with this, you're not getting enough veggies!  I used a 14.5-oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh (crop failure in my garden this year :-(  ) and no salt.  And of course cheese on top!  A tablespoon or 2 of tomato paste would have been a nice addition to thicken and for added flavor.

Really yummy!  I've never made clam sauce with veggies before but I like the color and flavor that it adds!  Only thing I changed was using bowtie pasta and cilantro instead of parsley.  Of course... served with lots of parm cheese. Thanks for the recipe!!

Made this for dinner this evening and it was fantastic. Followed the directions, except I used a small can of Italian tomtoes)with basil,garlic,etc) and added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. I also added some fresh asparagus. Served with garic bread. It's a keeper.

This recipe was super easy to make and combined numerous healthy ingredients creating a great flavor! As soon as I simmered the garlic and onion, I knew it was going to be good! The red pepper adds a bit of a kick for a great surprise!

WOW I don't usually like clams and I loved this recipe. I followed the recipe except I didn't add tomatoes (didn't have any) and I used vermecelli instead of fettucine. The only thing I would do different next time is cut back on the parsley.

We used fresh clams and the broth to make this tastey dish. We left out the carrots and added a bit more of the red pepper flakes. Very good Star!

This is an excellent recipe!  I used a Cubanelle Pepper in place of the bell, I'm allergic.  My son said I should always make a double batch of this recipe because it's just too good.  Thank you, Star for submitting it.

I found this to be good - but slightly plain.  I will make again, but may serve with a less-heavy pasta such as angel hair so that the taste of the sauce stands out more.

Have made this a few times with garden heirlooms and it's great! I add spinach linguine, use all the clam sauce in the cans and about 2 tablespoons of corn starch for a saucy consistency.

We're on a healthful cancer diet. This was low fat and nutritious. And so easy and good.  I used canned clams and canned tomatoes, no fresh on hand and it was yummy and still pretty.

Outstanding. This was a terrific opportunity for "cooking from the pantry"
Delightfully simple but worthy of company.

What a great dish to end the summer. I was very tired of dealing with garden tomatoes. This was a perfect dish to use a lot of tomatoes and still have a delicious dish. I was lucky enough to have all the ingredients on hand so it was even more inviting. My family just raved with this dish and ask if I would make it again. It's a very light dish no heavy creams or sauce.

Very easy, very flavorful.  Will become a regular dish in my kitchen.  Used 1 teaspoon of dried basil and 1 tablespoon of dried parsley, because I didn't have fresh--still great--will use fresh herbs next time.
