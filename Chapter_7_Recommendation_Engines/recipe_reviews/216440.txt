I used more Paprika in this and added a touch of Garlic, and then served it over noodles.  I was right-it is just like my Aunt Maria's "Paprika Chicken"

Oh, wow. This reminds me of a recipe I made a long time ago. Made the recipe exactly as it is listed, including the rice. The gravy was scrumptious, the chicken tender and delicious. The only addition was some steamed broccoli - and dinner was set. I am always looking for recipes that use what I have on hand, and preferably do not use canned ingredients such as condensed cream soups, which have unhealthy chemicals in them. This met my needs very well.

I omitted the mushrooms and green onions by personal preference.  I did add in a little onion powder in its place.  We thought this was good, the sauce was tasty and the chicken was tender.  The taste of the wine really comes through nicely in this dish.  I think some garlic could be a nice addition.

I fried the chicken in bacon grease, doubled the sauce, used non-fat sour cream and 1 pound of fresh mushrooms instead of canned, putting it over brown rice.  It was a hit!

Thank you for so many kind and thoughtful reviews! I am happy that you and your families enjoy this recipe as much as mine does. I have found a solution to the thin sauce (which always baffled me, too) -- let the entire dish sit for ten minutes or so (in the baking dish and at least partially covered) before serving, and the sauce should thicken up. The sauce may separate, so be sure to stir it as the directions indicate before serving. The chicken will still be hot if you leave it in the baking pan. If you have leftovers, you will notice that the sauce has thickened considerably. I hope this helps, and that you continue to enjoy this meal! Kathy

It was awesome! I used a little bit of the bacon grease with the butter and added garlic. I like a a lot of sauce so I double the wine and chicken broth. YUMMY!

I cooked it for dinner and if was absolutely beautiful.  I did make some adjustments though. I used 1 very large chicken breastfeeding and halved it , the bacon I put into the sauce into the oven and cooked like normal and since I didn't have any spring onions I diced up 1 red onion and I use frozen mushrooms instead of tinned. My husband even liked it and he doesn't like cream sauces. I served it with baked veges.

This was very tasty.  Wife and children gobbled it up.  I did a couple variations only because I was missing ingredients.  I used a 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup in lieu of mushrooms and minced onion instead of green onion.  I would have used what was called for by Kathy if I had it, but it was good this way too.

I really loved this.  It was pretty easy as I already had bacon cooked from the day before.  I had a three pack of some pretty thick breasts.  I trimmed the fat from the edges and halved them thickness wise, so I ended up with six thinner cutlets, which worked out great.  I used fresh mushrooms, added a bit more broth to the consistency that I liked, and some garlic per another review.  Next time I may add diced green pepper to mimmick the "Chicken Supreme" my mother used to make.  Really delicious!

I wanted something different.  This was good, however, I did have to change things. Like others mentioned, added garlic and browned my chicken in the left over bacon grease. I found the sauce too thin, so had to keep adding starch and flour to make it thicken.  Over all, nice change to a meal.  Takes a bit of time, but can be worth it.

Mixed the bacon in with the chicken prior to baking and used a small, diced yellow onion and fresh mushrooms, adding a clove of garlic.  The amount of rice could be cut back, as is VERY generous for the amount of chicken/sauce.

This was really delicious!  I usually don't cook this fattening of meals, but it was NYE and splurged.  It reminded me of a recipe I had years ago made very similarly, thanks for posting!  PS. I think the bacon and almonds are fairly unecessary, flavorful enough without them.

This was fantastic! I used fresh mushrooms and chicken tenderloins. Served over parsley noodles. Update: Made this again, served with rice, delicious. I used fresh mushrooms again, and this time, after browning the bacon I used the same pan to brown the chicken (I used less butter and left all the bacon grease in there). I also greased my baking dish with bacon grease --hey, free flavor! I convect baked at 425 for about 50 minutes. I also had a bunch of other dishes going on so I used instant rice :) Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Sounds wonderful and I'm definitely going to try it.  I live in a very hot climate and don't turn my oven on in summer.  Has anyone tried this in a crock pot?

I had to make some changes, but this was still delicious. I left out the mushrooms and onions (added some onion powder), I served this with fresh tomato slices from the garden. I definitely will be making this again.

I used fettuccine instead of rice.  I used a mix of chicken breasts cut in half and chicken thighs. Some of my family members like dark meat.  It was delish!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did make a couple of very small changes. I cooked the bacon in the microwave and added it to the sauce instead of using for garnish, cooked fresh mushrooms to add instead of using canned and omitted the onions and almonds. It felt like a very heavy meal so I wont' make it often but if I needed to finish up a bottle of white wine I'd make it again on a cold night.

I only had 2 chicken breasts so I also used 2 thighs.  My family LOVED this recipe.  This would be ideal to serve to company.

I followed the recipe exactly except I browned the chicken in the bacon fat and served over noodles.  It was very good and my husband liked it, I will likely make it again.  I would, however, likely substitute shallots for the green onions as another reviewer suggested.  The chicken was surprisingly tender, I was worried it would be overcooked.  My husband enjoyed leftovers the next day but found some of the chicken to be too gamey when he ate leftovers the 2nd day.
