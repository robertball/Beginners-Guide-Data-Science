Comfort food at it's best! There's nothing like really good, creamy mashed potatoes and this was no exception. I cut the recipe in half and used red skinned potaotes. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I just used regular low fat milk. The garlic and rosemary paired together nicely, although I did cut back on the rosemary a bit.

Used jarred minced garlic as a timesaver; added more garlic as well as more butter. Used heavy cream. Loved the flavor but I hated having the little bits of rosemary popping up every where. Solution? Maybe grind the rosemary or do as the recipe says and finely chop.

Oh these are so very good! I was hesitant to try, because my guys are mashed potatoes and gravy guys, but everyone liked these and no one even asked if we had any gravy. I'll fix these again.

Loved these potatoes!  First off, I doubled this recipe so we'd have lots of leftovers.  I didn't add the garlic in while boiling the potatoes, I waited until they were done and then added about 3 tablespoons of minced garlic before mashing.  I added a full 2 tablespoons of dried rosemary.  While the potatoes were boiling, I poured a little of the milk over the rosemary and it helped to soften them up a little bit.  Loved the flavor of these and will definitely make them again!

I just used regular 2% milk and mashed by hand - if you overmash you end up with "gluey" potatoes and that's easier to do with a mixer, but oh my this was sooooo yummy!! and soooo easy - I made it in conjunction with the Roast Chicken with Rosemary by Nanette - http://chicken.allrecipes.com/az/RoastChickenwithRosemary.asp - what a fabulous dinner. I just added a nice side salad and voila a gourmet tasting dinner with VERY little effort!! Make sure you get GOOD fresh rosemary - I like Living herbs from California. The rosemary also makes the potatoes look pretty with all the little green flecks!

This is a great recipe, I loved the garlic and rosemary flavors.  I double the amount for a few days of leftovers.  I used regular evaporated milk because I couldn't find a lowfat version.

These were good, but I needed to use way more evaporated milk than it called for. I would use regular milk in the future (evaporated just adds calories and didn't make it special) and add enough to make the potatoes a good consistancy.

Loved the rosemary and garlic flavors. Low in points on the weight-watcher system as well. Used 1% milk instead of the evaporated milk.  Served on Thanksgiving... and everyone liked... will make again!

I saut√©ed the garlic in a little butter before adding it to the potatotes, and substituted milk for cream. I followed previous suggestions to grind/finely chop the rosemary beforehand and this turned out fabulously.

I reduced the rosemary to a tsp. as I felt that a tbsp. would be WAY too much. I did use red potatoes and kept the skins on. The evaporated milk was a nice touch. I did heat it slightly before adding it to the potatoes before whipping them. NOM.

Yum!  I substituted the evaporated milk with 4 tbsp of light sour cream.  Absolutely delicious!  Even my man who prefers "plain mashed potatoes" ate every last bit of these potatoes!

made these with what was on hand (2% milk instead of evap, dried rosemary, minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh, no Parmesan cheese).  Added some microwave bacon, crumbled that up and put it all together.   Enjoyed this!

These are awesome!  I did make the following changes just to see how it would work and I loved it and so did both of my kids.  One is extremely picky.  I used a can of Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the garlic cloves.  I also omitted the evaporated milk and just used 1% milk.  This was amazing.  My older son did say he wished it had more garlic but I liked it just as it was and I am a garlic nut.  I served this with Salisbury steak..BIG HIT

I liked this but I think if I try it again, I will use regular milk instead of evaporated and I will not use quite as much rosemary.  Yeah, I know it's Garlic ROSEMARY Mashed Potatoes, but it's the first time I've cooked with rosemary and I found it more potent than I expected.  But still good.

Served this with supper, and everyone but one raved about it. He found out that he doesn't like rosemary. Nice change from "normal" mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing

Great recipe! Everyone from the adults to both picky 2-year-olds in the house liked it. :) I had to use dried rosemary because that was all I had on hand but it still turned out great, and it's lower fat than many of the other mashed potato recipes on here.

Great taste! My husband loved them. I used regular 1% milk instead of the evaporated and they came out just fine.

Great flavor! 
They were so easy to make, this was my first time making mashed potatoes and these were awesome. I think I might add a little more garlic or maybe roast my garlic and add the garlic while blending them. BUT thats just to try something different. If u want great tasting easy mashed potatoes then try these!

I thought this recipe was really bland.  Per others' suggestions, I used 2% milk instead of evaporated, but everything else I did exactly as instructed.  In fact, I even erred on the side of extra cheese, garlic, and seasonings, but these potatoes were still so-so at best.

Everyone loved this dish. I too added lots more garlic and chopped the rosemary to very fine bits. I also added more milk and butter than required. Very tasty, I will certainly make this one again.

I don't think I will try these again but if I do I would add more garlic, more butter and more cream.  And as was mentioned before mincing the heck out of the rosemary is key, I used dried rosemary and it was like little needles scratching my mouth.

Really great flavor, but I took the advice of other reviews and boiled the garlic with the potatoes AND added some raw when I mashed them (we are big garlic fans).  I also used regular 1% milk and I used Parmesano Reggiano.  These were a big hit.

this is a great recipe for mashed potatoes.  I like a little more garlic flavor than you get here by boiling the garlic with the potatoes and if you like it a little stronger, beat in two tablespoons of minced garlic AFTER the potatoes are boiled.  Finishes this up perfectly!  thanks for the recipe!

This was fast, easy and tasted great. I used Romano instead of Parmesan cheese, because that is what I had sitting in the fridge. I am glad I heeded the warning of others and minced the heck out of my rosemary, that is a chewy spice. Highly recommended!!

I can't give a more enthusiastic recommendation for this recipe. I used my big KitchenAide mixer to whip them into perfection, used 1/8 of a cup parmesan and 1/8 of a cup romano and used 2% milk instead of the evaporated variety. Salt liberally and these mashed potatos are holiday-worthy!

Great recipe for a fabulous Thanksgiving meal.

Make sure to finely chop the rosemary.
