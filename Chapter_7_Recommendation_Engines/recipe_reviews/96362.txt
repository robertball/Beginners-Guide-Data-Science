Used organic ground turkey.  Good reviews from the family, and they requested the recipe.

I think this was just as good, if not better, than regular meatloaf. I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I will be making this again soon! Also, make sure to use seasoned bread crumbs.

This recipe was really bland; I probably won't make it again.  I used shredded cheddar instead of shredded American, and melted American Cheese on top in the last 5 minutes.  Dipping it in ketchup helped with some of the blandness.
