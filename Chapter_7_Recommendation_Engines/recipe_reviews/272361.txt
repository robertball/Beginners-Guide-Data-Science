These are very good as is. The balsamic gives them a bit of a sweet taste that I will tone down in my next try along with fine tuning the baking time for golden brussels sprouts. I do however have to admit that I used only 1/3 of the oil the recipe called for. My sprouts were little and were not exactly pretty so I had to clean them up so this made them even smaller. Other than that, I guess use judgement on the amount of oil depending on the size of your sprouts. Will make it again as it goes VERY WELL WITH FILET MIGNON!

I only used 2 T of the oil; bacon supplied enough when roasting.  Yes, would definitely make again.  Takes the bitterness out of the Brussel sprouts.

I used wine vinegar instead of balsamic and added freshly grated parmesan.  Absolutely a favorite of ours and company will not leave without the recipe!
