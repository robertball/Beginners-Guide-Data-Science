This was my first shot at making shrimp dip, and it turned out rather well.  I took other reviewers advice and cut down the mayonnaise, the worcestershire, and traded in some of the salt for garlic or onion powder instead.  I used fresh parsley and frozen shrimp too.  I would definitely add more shrimp than what is called for - otherwise you don't get meat in each bite.  I hate rating a recipe I changed so much, but this is definitely a keeper!

We decided to try this for New Year's Eve celebrations. As other reviewers have mentioned, what turns out to be a pinch over 1 tbls. of salt is WAY to much (and I like salty stuff!). Use onion powder in place of onion salt, and garlic powder in place of garlic salt, then only use about 1 tsp. celery salt, at most! In addition, 3 tbls. of Worcestershire sauce is over-powering to the point that the dip tastes like Worcestershire dip! At most, use 1 tbls. We added an additional can of shrimp to see if we could compensate for the flavor of the Worcestershire sauce with limited success! I truly believe with the reduction in salt and Worcestershire sauce, this dip would be outstanding.

I've taken this shrimp dip to several gatherings within the past year.  It is immensely well received, and many have asked for the recipe.  It disappears quickly, which tells me all I need to know.  M.D. Grey

I found this dip to be way too salty for my taste.  I think you really have to like worcestershire sauce A LOT to like this one.

This dip was awesome. My fiance and I both loved it and so did everyone else at the party. I will definitely make this one again, soon. I refrigerated it overnight before I served it.

I know people hate when you change a recipe but I did. I omitted the mayo and I used a bag of frozen whole shrimp (peeled and deveined) (41-60 count). I sauted the cut up shrimp in some crab boil and butter, let cool completely, and added to cream mixture. Chilling overnight is a must. Thanks for sharing.

My coworker made this for our office and it was awesome.  She did make the following changes that I wanted to keep safe on here.  She added additional 4oz of sour cream, additional 4oz cream cheese, 1 can crabmeat, additional 1 can of shrimp, 1/2 tsp dill and 1/2 tsp of lemon pepper.  Instead of onion salt, she used dried onion flakes (rehydrated). She also increased the garlic salt to taste.  Let me repeat it was amazing and our office devoured it.

Way, waaaaaay too much celery salt. I even wound up doubling the amount of shrimp and still all I could taste was celery. The flavor wasn't bad, I was just hoping for it to taste like shrimp and it didn't at all.

Way to salty!!  If I do try it again, I will only use 1/2 the amount of celery and onion salt.  Omit the the garlic salt and use garlic powder.   And, only use about 2 Tblsp Worcestershire.

The changes I used in my batches were 2 cans of shrimp, 1/2 cup of light sour cream, 1/2 cup light mayo, 1/4 t of each of the salts, and 1 forkful of horseradish. The chilling time 
is important to the flavor.

This is real close to the recipe my grandfather & mother made every Christmas.  I cut back on the mayonnaise & Worcestershire as suggested, used onion & garlic powders instead of salts.  However, I did not add the celery salt or parsley but added horseradish.  Letting it chill out in the fridge is a must.

Unfortunately I was just not that pleased with how this recipe turned out.  It calls for at least 3 more teaspoons of salt beyond the worcestire sauce which is already high in sodium.  All I could tast was the "saltiness".  One can of shrimp is not nearly enough I added two and would have considered 3.  If I do decide to try again will cut way back on the salt and use fresh parsley to replace the dried.

The recipe was OK but better after sitting for over 24 hours.  I would add more shrimp next time.
