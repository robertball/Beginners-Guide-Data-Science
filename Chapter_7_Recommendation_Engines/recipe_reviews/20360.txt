It didn't taste Mexican at all. I don't think Worcestershire sauce works in a fajita marinade, and it definitely needed some chili powder or something to spice it up.

I did not care for this...the worcestershire sauce and lime juice were the dominant flavors.  It doesn't taste like fajitas.  Needs spices.

We used tri-tip steak and it turned out well.  The flavor was good and the meat tender.  We added "Mexican Seasoning" to the meat right before grilling.  This added a little more zip to it.

My husband is a very picky eatter and he really liked this recipe. And I liked that I can make this at the drop of a hat and not worry about having a powdered mix on hand.  Thanks!

I dumped all the listed ingredients in a bag, marinated in the bag, and cooked the meat in the juice.  It came out great.  The ingredients do sound odd, but it does work.

I added Chipotle chili powder to the marinade, left out the water and substituted olive oil for the veg. oil. It turned out pretty well -- the citrus flavors really came through, and the chili powder gave it a kick. I also added some fresh cilantro during cooking.

This marinade tasted... off.  Maybe it was just because i didn't have access to lime...?  I dunno.  I think I'll keep looking.

This was okay, but not what I expected. I have to agree with some previous reviewers the Worcestershire sauce and vinegar were way too overpowering.  I even added some chili powder and cayenne pepper but still didn't cut it. I'll keep searching for the perfect Fajita Marinade.

Used this marinade for 1.28 # boneless chicken breast.Good, quick and easy and can be seasoned to taste.  Only used 2 tbsp. EVOO in the marinade, added 1 tsp. cumin, omitted the water, and used rice  vinegar instead of distilled d/t the mildness that rice vinegar has. Used 4 small cloves crushed garlic instead of powder.  Added some fresh chopped cilantro near the end.  Nice lowfat lunch.  Meat was very tender and only marinated for 1 hour.

I'm sorry.   I wanted to love this...but I found it absolutely not to my liking.  The smell was not to my liking and the taste was no better.   Additionally, it didn't seem to have any sort of latin kick I would have expected from a fajita marinade.   It seemed unbalanced...I would have expected a spiciness to balance out the vinegar-y tangy taste, but it just never delivered.

My family really liked this, including my mother-in-law who is Mexican! Anyone can add any tweak they want if they think it needs it...that's all according to your taste. I'm actually making it again today! Thank you very much for posting this; it's GREAT!

I skipped the water, added 1/2 t. cumin and did 1/2 the lemon and lime. Marinated chicken for 3 hrs and it was very good! My kids loved it.

This was better with chicken than beef. The lemon/lime flavor was too strong.  If I make this again, I will use half as much lemon and lime juice and more water.

Ok marinade if you don't have fajita seasoning on hand.  I added chili powder to the marinade for quesadillas.  I added cilantro to the final dish but not the marinade.

This was very good, I used flap meat which is another type of skirt steak.  It came out great, very tender and flavorful,  thanks for the great recipe.

This marinade smelled really good in the bowl but when I was done cooking the steak my husband and I found it very sour tasting.  I don't know if it was because of the vinegar or the lemon and lime juice but I didn't like it very much.  I'm going to try one of the other fajita recipes and I hope it turns out better.

My husband loved these.  He thought all the flavors blended well.  I marinated for 24 hours and the meat was very tender.  I followed the recpie except I used fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  When I was frying the meat up, there seemed to be a LOT of excess liquid, so I mixed in 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken it up.  I removed the meat and used the extra juice to saute red and green peppers and onions for the fajitas.  Big hit with the big guy!

As written I would have to rate it a 3.  We did not think there was a lot of flavor and you could really taste the vinegar.  Had to doctor it up a lot.

My family did not like this recipe at all.  In fact they could not even eat it.  The vinager taste was very strong, and the flavor did not taste like a fajita.  I don't understand the favorable reviews.  I made the recipe exactly as it read.  What went wrong!

I followed TUNISIANSWIFE's lead by using rice vinegar instead of distilled white.  Let it marinade for a few hours and had some tasty fajitas for dinner!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is pretty good but I altered it a little for our tastes.  Added about 1/4 tsp of Liquid Smoke and appx. 1 tsp. Mexican chile powder.  My husband really liked it and thought it smelled wonderful even while the steak was marinating.  Thanks Juanita!
