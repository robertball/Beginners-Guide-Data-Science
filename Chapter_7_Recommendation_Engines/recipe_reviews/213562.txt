I realize this is seasoned "SALT" but the salt in this recipe completely overwhelmed the other spices. In my opinion the salt should be cut in half and continue with the rest of the ingredients as stated. With the change I think this could easily be a 4 star recipe.

This is excellent I used sea salt. You can reduce the amount of salt easily enough.

"Bev's Seasoned Salt" reminds me of soup bouillon: It tastes mostly like salt with strong herbal undertones. I made mine with Celtic sea salt and the optional garlic onion powder and parsley (mentioned in the recipe description). I have found this tastes good as a "rescue remedy" for a less than flavorful homemade chicken or turkey broth.
