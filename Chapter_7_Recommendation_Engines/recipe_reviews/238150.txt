Use serrano for spicier or red pepper for prettier

Very good.  I did add some red pepper flakes to give it more heat. This Mango Salsa was very refreshing! I also used canned chunk pineapple in it's own juice instead of the fresh pineapple. I cut the chunks into smaller pieces.

Tasty! I went easy on the jalapeño for my personal preference.

I have made this several times.  I have always served it on pan seared scallops.  I will spread my wings and give it a try on chicken.  If there were more stars this one would get them all.

This was good with toasted sea salt pita chips for Cinco de Mayo, but tomorrow, what's left will be served over grilled chicken (would be great on fish, as well).  Good balance of sweetness from the mango and pineapple, offset well by the heat of the jalapeños.  Welcome change from traditional tomato salsa.  Thanks, henesy, for a new salsa recipe!
