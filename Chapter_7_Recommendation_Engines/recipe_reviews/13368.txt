I added parsley to suit myself and instead of water I substituted Swansons Chicken Broth... this has got to be some of the best soup I ever tasted. I used frozen yellow & white baby corn 16 oz. bags and I was told afterward that an additional can of cream corn may have brought the flavor of the corn out better. I made enough for a church "Soup-er Bowl", 36 servings and used 14 lbs of chicken, 48 cups of chicken broth and 3 lbs of corn. And plenty of rivels! DELICIOUS!

My Husband is from PA, where this soup is pretty much a regular in most homes and he's talked about it for years now!  We've lived in NC since we've been married so he hasn't had his "chicken corn soup fix!"  I found this recipe recently and it seemed easy enough so I gave it a try.  I loooved it and my Husband had 3 bowls in one setting and said it tasted exactly how he remembered it!  I followed the driections pretty much the way they are but I cut down on the cooking time by using chicken broth in place of water and using a rotisserie chicken (shredded).  It was quick and easy.  I loved the rivels and I think next time I will put more in.  I'm also gonna take the advice of another reviewer and try adding in a can of cream corn to the mixture next time - although it is good without it!.  This soup was very deilicious and I will most definitley be making it for years to come!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I'd never heard of rivals, and had to try them! So I made a quicker, easier version of this recipe because I didn't have a whole chicken. Started with a mirepoix [1 onion, 2 ribs celery, 1 carrot] sauted in 2 T. margarine for flavor and color. Added 1 large boneless skinless diced chicken breast, 1 can of corn with liquid, and 4 cups of water. Then used 4 teaspoons of chicken soup base [Orrington Farms brand is excellent, NAYY]. Also added a little dry Thyme. Then for the rivals, I used half whole wheat flour to make them healthier and added 1/2 teaspoon salt for flavor. My crumbles of dough were around pea size. I didn't use the hard cooked eggs. This soup was great...I love the rivals! I made a 3 quart pan full, and only ate one little bowl because it's very filling. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm from Lancaster County and grew up eating chicken corn soup! This is a good recipe for it. Some people add carrots and some don't like the hard boiled eggs, but NEVER potatoes to true chicken corn soup!     For the rivels, the "dough" should really be called batter. There is no mystery and almost no way to mess up. The dough should resemble a thick pancake batter. How big they are in your soup depends on how large a dough "plop" you use. They do not resemble "balls" while making them because the dough is too sticky to make a ball shape.They do make little balls when cooked though. But size is up to you. I've had large rivels and small ones. I personally like them about the size of a small marble when cooked.    The easiest way I have found to get the rivels into the pot (because the dough/batter is sticky) is to first scoop up a level (or just a bit rounded) teaspoonful of the batter. Use your index finger, against the edge of the spoon to push and cut off a bit of dough (whatever size you like) and it should stick to the fingerprint side of your index finger. Use the back of the spoon to then push the dough from your finger into the pot. (yes, there is still more dough on the spoon, but it won't fall off because it is sticky.) Keep pushing pieces of dough from the spoon. (about 6-8 rivels from one spoon of batter/dough) If it gets stuck to the back of the spoon, touch the piece of dough to the hot soup.  Once I can get in rhythm I can do all the rivels in about 5 minutes.

I had never heard of this. I thought it tasted like a chicken and dumplings type of soup- only with tiny dumplings. My 3 toddlers  ate a whole bowl each! As always, I think soups taste better on the second day.   I added more corn. The boiled eggs do give it a little something extra, I may add 3 next time!  Would someone please post a pic of these "rivels" so that I can see what I am supposed to be making?

This soup is wonderful comfort food!  I wanted to get it on the table a little faster for Sunday dinner, so I used chicken stock and skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead of whole chicken and water.  I simmered the thighs and chopped onion in the broth for about 20 minutes.  I also used mini pasta instead of making the rivals, and I added a dash of nutmeg at the last minute.  It was delicious, and my kids and I just loved it!

This soup is an excellent old fashioned rivel soup and I can't imagine anyone not giving it 5 stars.  It takes some time to make but is well worth it. Thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe box!

This was my 1st time making corn soup. I added parsley to it and a few chicken cubes. The rivels were runny, so I had to add a lot more flour. Other than that, it was good.

Delicious!  My mom's been making this soup since I was little, and I tried it myself after finding this recipe.  I did things a little different since I had a chicken carcus leftover with lots of chicken on it, so I boiled that for an hour and then picked the chicken off, (had to add some chicken broth though), and then made the soup, also added carrots and parsely. Rivvels are wonderful.  Thanks!

This soup was great.  It is just like what I remember from years ago.  I used chicken broth in place of the water and I used egg noodles intead of rivels.  I omitted the hard boiled egg; my husband doesn't like his chicken corn soup with egg.  Instead of frozen corn, I used canned corn also.  This recipe turned out great.

Really good and didn't require a lot of ingredients.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast and a couple of legs.  I also substituted chicken broth for half of the water, and added a cup of cubed potatoes.  Everyone really liked it.  Could double the recipe for the rivels.  We liked those a lot.

In our family, this rates as "soul food".  My Grandma didn't add hard-boiled eggs and when my Mom told me how to make rivels she didn't mention milk--just the egg and flour...this time I did use milk and needed a lot more flour...which meant more rivels, which is fine with me!  I also add chopped carrots.  This is the best chicken soup there is!

I made this last night but I think I must have done something wrong. I followed the instructions exactly but when the soup was finished it tasted greasy and had globs of grease from the chicken fat floating in the broth. 
In the past I've always chilled the stock from the chicken and removed the fat that floats to the top and hardens then used what was left. This recipe didn't call for that so I went with what the instructions said. 
We couldn't finish a bowl of it because of the greasy taste :-(
I think I'll try this again one day but remove the grease from the stock first. It sounds like it has the potential to be a very good soup. 
Does anyone else have any ideas on why mine tasted so greasy? The chicken didn't seem to have an excess of fat on it.

Fabulous soup!  I followed other posts to decrease the cooking time.....I used Progresso no salt chicken broth and a rotisserie chicken, and I also added a can of creamed corn.  It was outstanding.  Better than my mother-in-law made, and she lived in Lancaster County.

I never made rivels (nor did I really understand what they were) but they and the soup turned out excellent!  I think it could have used another 2 eggs and I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to bring up the flavor,  but it got rave reviews. So yummy and easy too!

This soup is so delicious! I read the other reviews and added a can of cream corn as recommended. I cooked the chicken, deboned and then added the meat back to the broth and refrigerated overnight.  The next day I skimmed off all the solid fat from the top. For the rivels, I added the 1/4 cup milk as listed in the recipe but found myself with just a big lump of dough. Added more flour and cut it in with 2 knives and that helped to make the rivels. I did find that I needed to add more salt and pepper to our tastes. My husband wanted noodles in it in addition to the rivals so I added some egg noodles. This makes a big pot of deliciousness! I froze some for later. I will be making this recipe many times in the future!!!!

I honestly don't know how many times I made this recipe last winter; it is so good and one of the only ways I will eat chicken soup. I was chicken souped to death when I was younger creating quite an aversion. Anyway, I froze some of the sweet corn from the summer that had been roasted and I think it gave the soup a great depth of flavor as well as added a small can of cream corn to each batch. Now I know my little PA Dutch grandmothers would be appalled that I didn't make the rivals, but used instead fine egg noodles. Thank you Teresa for posting this recipe, can't wait for the weather to cool down...so we can make it again!

I made this today and we loved it! I didn't have a whole chicken so I used 2 chicken breasts and 2 thighs. Came out to just under 4 lbs. I also did a quart of low sodium chicken stock and 3 quarts of water. Made extra rivals too. Added parsley at the end for some color. Very yummy and even my neighbors were begging for some! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I live in Snyder county pa and we use this recipe all the time. Another thing you could possibly add to it that I have an my family loves is egg noodles like the loose spiral noodles. Add them about 15 minutes before you serve the food taste great.

I never use the hard boiled eggs in this recipe.  I also make my rivels slightly different:  1 1/3 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. salt(cannot omit), 2 tsp. baking powder, 1 egg, and 1/2 c. milk.  Otherwise, love the recipe, just like Mom's.
