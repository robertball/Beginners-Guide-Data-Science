Delicious!!  I did brown the stew meat on the stove first, and then threw the onions in the pan for just a couple of minutes to absorb the flavor of the drippings.  Once that was done, I added the broth directly to the pan to loosen things up and then I put everything in the slow-cooker.  As I said, delicious!!  My husband was STILL talking about how good dinner was at 11:00 p.m.!

I prefer to make this in a Dutch Oven, but for those that were disappointed w/ this recipe (lacked flavor). Add 1T.garlic pepper,1T. Worcestershire and substitute beef stock for broth. (not really necessary, but punches it up for those that like a little more "zing").

Very quick and easy recipe, nice for workday supper.  Sauce thickens upon cooling--we first thought it was too "soupy" but we just needed patience!

This recipe is excellent! I used chive cream cheese (because I couldn't find the herb & garlic flavor) and it came out great. Definitely a keeper!

This was good and so easy!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and coated the meat in flour before browning.  I also added a tablespoon of garlic and some worstershire sauce to the mix.  Yummy!

Very good... husband loved it. I used 1/3 less fat plain cream cheese instead and added 2 minced garlic cloves in with the onions and mushrooms. Great texture.

Sooo Good.  I could not find herb & garlic spread so used Chive & onion like the other reader but added my own herbs.  Also, because we like thick, I made a thickener, such as flour and broth and added that as well.  Very, Very Good.  Thank you.  Will make it again

This recipe is so easy. It will be added to my collection of faves. I did lightly flour and saute the beef before putting in in the slow cooker. I also seasoned it well, with salt, pepper, garlic and steak seasoning. My entire family loved it!

This recipe is delicious.  I thought it needed more four, but that could be personal taste.  We waited for it to thicken upon cooling like another reviewer said, but it didn't thicken enough for our tastes.

This was so so.  It seemed to have a bitter taste to it and was not as creamy as a normal beef stroganoff.  I followed the instructions as stated.

The flavour of this was just ok - not much flavour there, actually. I hoped it would be better as I really like the herb and garlic cream cheese. It needed to be a lot thicker, I even added more flour but no dice. The cream cheese didn't blend in very well either, I'm not sure why that's the case as cream cheese usually melts great. But, it was easy and was a good way to use up mushrooms that I couldn't remember why I bought. Good enough that I'll eat the leftovers but I doubt I'll choose this recipe again. Served over mashed potatoes instead of fettucine.

This turned out terrible, I made exactly as directed (even used the herb & garlic cream cheese), cooked on high in my slow cooker for 4 hours.  Personally I thought it was horrible - the beef just ended up with this weird gross flavor to it.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was my husband thought it was o.k, I took one bite and threw my plate out, very disappointing. Sorry but will not make again.

I did add a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. Instead of fettucini, I served it over buttered egg noodles. Not bad. The little ones loved it, asking for seconds. NO leftovers.

I used beef consomm√© instead of broth.  I added fresh thyme, salt and pepper to the meat.  I used plain cream cheese.  Delicious over egg noodles.

This was pretty good.  The meat was very tender, but the gravy did not thicken the way I would have liked.  I may try this again but will add more flour next time.

This was a great dinner my 11 month old loved it. I used neufch√¢tel cream cheese and just seasoned the meat mixture garlic Italian seasoning. I really do not like mushrooms and the meal was not overwhelming tasting of mushrooms like I assume it would be had this called for cream of mushroom.

total winner! it was so simple. I just threw everything except mushrooms (don't like them) and the cooking cream right in the slow cooker on high 6 hours and it was delicious. I did add minced garlic (from a jar - no fresh on hand), dried thyme, and salt and pepper in with the meat. I also didn't have the herb cooking cream, but I did have savory garlic and it was a good choice. even though I used garlic in with the meat, it wasn't too garlicky. the sauce came out thin however my family was sopping up the sauce with crusty bread. even without the cream, it would serve very well as a base for beef stew, just add carrots and potatoes. I only had a pound and a half of meat and adjusted accordingly. I think I'll double the recipe next time and reduce the amount of broth so it's more stew-like and serve over rice or pasta.

I just got through trying, and it was ok. You really DO have to season the meat or else it will be tasteless. I will try this recipe again and hope it comes out better.

Delicious! Made a few adjustments according to the reviews. I seared the beef before hand and added salt and pepper. I threw that in the crock pot. Next I used a whole onion and sauteed it in the dripping, I also added some olive oil and garlic. I also added a Table spoon of woshestershire sauce. Cooked on high for 4 hours. The meat did come out a little dry, but it didn't really matter because the sauce was soooo good.

This was easy and turned out good.  I omitted the onions and mushrooms by personal preference and added a bit of onion powder.  I also could not find herb & garlic cream cheese so had to use roasted garlic flavor instead.  I added some Italian seasoning to replace the herbs.  I had to use a little more flour to get the sauce to a thicker consistency.  I served this over egg noodles.

As a mother of 2 who is employed full time I was looking for a easy, healthy recipe that was different from our usual. About as easy as hamburger helper from a box with 10 times the flavor, this was a great recipe to find! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good but it did a little extra kick.  Next time I will use the person's suggestion of garlic pepper and Worcestershire.  I'm just an "extra zing" kind of guy

I think it deserves 5 stars except for the fact that we would have liked a little more flavor. I think I'll tweak the recipe a bit next time I make it (there will be a next time!) I love cream cheese and this was really yummy.

This was great! My boyfriend and I loved it! I did double the recipe and change a few minor things. I browned the beef (coated with flour, seasoned with salt/pepper) first. I also put the onions in the pan with the beef for a bit. I used half a cup less onions and added 2 t of garlic to the beef broth b/c I could not find garlic and herb cream cheese so I used onion and chive. I will be making this again!

It was easy to make and turned out ok, but a little bland. Was good with a lot of salt.

Turned out really good! So easy. I pan fried the beef and onions a little before adding to slow cooker. I didn't have beef broth so I added chicken broth along with the juice from when I pan fried the beef and onions as others suggested. I waited a little to serve it for it to thicken and it did! I served it on egg noodles.

I followed the instructions and put the meat it in the slow cooker for 6 hours on low. After 4 hours I checked on it  and it was already way overdone. I recommend doing no more than 3 hours. I also should've seasoned the meat more before cooking- it was bland. Overall, it wasn't bad, I just wish the meat was more tender.

Delicious and easy!  I added spices and an additional 1/2 Tbsp flour with a couple dollops of sour cream before serving.  Served over egg noodles tasted wonderful!  Many compliments from the hubby.

Great easy beef stroganoff for a weeknight! I cooked a flat iron steak on low for 7 hours, adding the mushrooms with 2 hours left. I also substituted the flour for gluten free flour and you couldn't tell the difference.

This was excellent! The beef was so tender it was falling apart as I was serving! Wonderful on a busy Wednesday.  Served over egg noodles instead of fettuccine. Delicious!
