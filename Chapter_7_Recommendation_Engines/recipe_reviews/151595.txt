We love green bean casserole, but find this recipe just seems to use too much milk.  The sauce seems overly thin.  I use somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 cup of milk and it is just perfect; thick and creamy.  I omit the soy sauce as I think this recipe is great without it and to cut down on the sodium.

It's OK. I've been doing green bean casserole for years. I love the stuff. I can fill up a plate of this and sit down to eat. I've always made my own style of it, but this year for christmas I thought I'd do this since it's so publisized. None of us liked it. I don't know exactly why, maybe it was the soy sauce or that it is watered down so much with milk. I make mine with a heavier soup and no soy sauce and real thinly sliced onions in it while it bakes.

This is so good!!!  I use fresh green beans in the casserole and it makes all the difference in the world in flavor.  I steam the beans first, then mix them with the other ingredients.  Delicious!

Substitute half and half for the milk and omit the soy sauce and you have the way we make it. We were out of both once, but had promised the casserole, so went with the substitute and have made it that way ever since.

Not bad at all, I guess, for my first time trying this kind of casserole. My only complaint is that it didn't taste so good when it was reheated (and as I'm eating for one, I had plenty of time to test that theory).

I personally don't eat it because I don't like string beans but I make it with french cut and regular cut beans. I mix 1 can of each and get rave reviews.

And old family favorite.  Who ever could give this less than five stars just for nostalgia value!

When I couldn't get the Campbell's soup and the French cut green beans in Europe, I substituted a packaged Cream of Mushroom soup, added sour cream and milk.  

One year I tried to slice frozen green beans  down in to French sliced -- too time consuming and absolutely frustrating!  Just used regular frozen  green beans and the taste was also fabulous.

Made thin-sliced homemade onion rings as well.

In the end, a lot more time consuming than this easy original.  I realized how very much I appreciated the ease of this great side dish for holiday meals when everything else in the kitchen is topsy-turvy from cooking.

Very easy and very good.  I used fresh green beans and cut off the ends. That made it taste very good.

This was a good base recipe.  Sometimes it's nice just to have a few ingredients, and this was a nice addition to the more complex dishes I served during Thanksgiving.  Thanks for a great recipe! Will use again.

Tried and True for 4 generations!!!  I tried skipping this dish last Thanksgiving and I never heard the end of it. Best to make just the way the recipe says before trying to tweak it....you will more than likely enjoy it more just the way it is.

I use the basic recipe, but omit (completely) the milk...too runny otherwise. My secret is replacing the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce...gives it a slightly spicy/tangy flavor, and when I leave that out, people will tell me that it is just not "my" green bean casserole. I have used fresh, frozen, and canned green beans, and to be honest, most everyone likes it best with the canned ones.

After reading all reviews, I adjusted the recipe as follows: just over one lb. of fresh green beans steamed 7-8 min, one can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp. worcestershire, 1/8 tsp. pepper, 1 cup french fried onions and 1 cup cheddar cheese. Mix it all together, bake for 25 min. at 350 degrees. Remove from oven with 5 min. remaining, top with additional french fried onions around the edges of casserole and cook for remaining time. It was delicious and it was requested for Christmas dinner. Thanks for the suggestions everyone.

I wonder...is it because this humble green bean casserole is so incredibly delicious that it's in nearly every home in America on Thanksgiving Day (including ours)?  Or, as it is in our family, is it SO good simply because family tradition and ritual have told us it is?  Whatever the reason, any dish with this much sentimental value, this much popularity, can only be rated 5 stars.  In our case, my son requested it for Thanksgiving Day many years ago when he was just a little guy, and it has become a necessary part of our Thanksgiving Dinner ever since - not that *I'm* particularly crazy about it, but even for me it would be sorely missed.  Years ago, I turned the casserole making over to my son, and I'm sure someday he and my daughter will add it to their own Thanksgiving tradition.  I make it with frozen French-style green beans, a 16-ounce bag for each can of soup, 1 small can onions, 1/2 c. milk, and 1 tsp. soy sauce.  Make sure the beans are well cooked before you assemble and bake the casserole or you'll end up with some crunchy green beans!  I also make this in a shallow casserole dish so no one needs to bother cheating and sort of skimming/scooping the onions off the top - there will be some in every, shallow spoonful!  Knowing the recipe is on AR is helpful because now it will be forever at my fingertips and easily passed along. (Today a quadruple recipe is making its way through Milwaukee airport security in Ziploc bags on its way to Minneapolis with 2 grown kids)

This recipe is easier than they make it out to be. All you need is 2 cans green bean ( I like to use french style) and 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Drain green beans and then add the soup to the green beans. Mix in salt, pepper, and then the secret ingredient is a couple of dashes of Tony Cacheres Cajun Seasoning. This does not make it hot ( i know I have an extremely low tolerance for hot food) but adds a taste you will never forget. Cover with French's Fried Onions and bake on 350 degrees for 15 to 25 mins Depending on your oven.

Reading all of the reviews I checked my Durkee's French Fried Onion Recipe and it only calls for one can of cream of mushroom soup and 3/4c. milk. This may be why many thought it was too runny. 
This is a staple for Thanksgiving.

I did make one change and that was to use worcestershire sauce in place of the soy. I love it and it reminded me of when my mom would make it for the holidays

This is definitely a family favorite I make at Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.  I add chopped water chestnuts and a small can of sliced mushrooms to make it a bit richer and a little crunchy.  I also use canned french sliced green beans which makes a big difference compared to just cut greeen beans.

I always have to make green bean casserole every Thanksgiving and this easy recipe is the one I always make. I use 2 (14.5 ounce) cans of organic cream of mushroom soup and add no milk since that soup is not condensed. I always like to add a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and I never stir the baked casserole. I just love the flavor that the soy sauce adds to this delicious classic casserole. Thanks for the great recipe Campbell's....even though I don't ever use your soup in it.

this is seriously sososososooo good with the changes i made: omitted soy sauce, only used a splash of milk, and added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Instead of using fried onion I sauteed a cup of of sliced onions (with a little bit of sliced red bell peppers for color). I also sprinkled the top of the dish with bread crumbs when there was 10 minutes left and cranked it up to 375 to toast em. This is seriously the easiest recipe ever and it makes you feel good about yourself because you're eating veggies :)

As is, this recipe is not one I would make again.  The second time I made it, (half the recipe,) I used 2 cans French green beans seasoned with red peppers.  (Didn't even know I was buying the seasoned kind, but it worked out great!)  I like mushroom soup in casseroles, but in this one it was way too much mushroom flavor.  I happened to have a can of cream of asparagus soup in my cupboard, so I used that.  Then I had some leftover canned evaporated milk, so that went in too.  I omitted the soy sauce, and continued as directed.  This time, it was marvelous!  The asparagus soup went much better with the green beans and the French beans were much better for a soft, creamy vegetable dish.  Enjoy these changes, those who thought this "classic" dish didn't deserve to be "classic."

We love the cheese version of this. If I don't have cream of mushroom soup on hand I use cream of chicken. Either ways it's always delicious.

I always use French cut green beans in this recipe and it turns our great. I'm not a huge green bean person, but these are really good. Usually 2 cans is enough. I use less milk than this recipe calls for and no soy sauce at all. And who measures the French Fried Onions on the top anyway? I always sprinkle them all over the top and bake it (covered with foil so they don't burn). It's just not the holidays to me without this dish.

I, too, have been making this for years.  I've never included soy sauce, but have used a little less milk and added a small can of slice mushrooms.  When I mix the milk and the soup together, I add a little garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, dried parsley, and a bit of chili powder in addition to black pepper.  I use the canned french-style green beans & it always comes out great.  You can always add another can of green beans if the mixture is too thin and it will also stretch the casserole.

I use this as a base for my green bean casserole, with modifications passed down from my grandmother. I omit the soy sauce, use much less milk so it isn't soupy, and add a medium block of cubed Velveeta. Not figure-friendly, but lick-the-plate delicious!

I made this with 3 lbs fresh green beans (I cut them up and blanched them for 3 minutes first), 2 cans organic cream of mushroom soup (not condensed - so I didn't add milk), and two containers of Lars imported all-natural crispy onions.  I eliminated the soy sauce and instead put in 4 strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled.  I couldn't believe how much better it tasted!  So did the teenagers - we had 12 people for Thanksgiving (5 teenagers) and there were no leftovers!

I've had this a few times and I'm not a big fan. It was way too salty and had kind of an acrid taste that I didn't care for. Also, the flavor of the green beans is kind of eclipsed by all the soup and milk.

This recipe is awesome- it is a classic and there is nothing to complain about, AT ALL! I did do one or two things different... first, I have had this before with fresh cut green beans, and honestly, we prefer canned. The texture and formation after baking comes out a lot better and more edible. Something about fresh cut and cooked green beans makes it taste funny, so I recommend canned. We also really dislike mushrooms, so we use either cream of chicken or cream of celery soup- both work very well if you are not a mushroom fan. What totally makes the dish, besides the creamy inside, is the French fried onions for a crispy topping. DO NOT skip out on those! Be generous and coat it up!! I've also added in bacon bits to the filling in the past- YUM!!! Classic dish, you really can't go wrong with this one. (I should learn to take a photo to post before serving some of the dishes I review on here... seems by the time I want to review and post a photo- there is virtually NO leftovers or even crumbs to photograph! Now, THAT is when you know you have a keeper for a recipe!)

I've made this for years - but always use fresh green beans & pre-cook them (boil) first with some seasoning & bacon. Use real cream i/o milk - part Sherry.  Saute sliced onions & fresh mushrooms together until the mushrooms are limp - then follow the directions given. Makes a huge difference!

This is a must-have dish at Thanksgiving.  I prefer fresh green beans to canned or frozen, omit the soy sauce, and add some grated cheese (about a cup or two).    I also add a can of water chestnuts which gives it a nice texture.

I am asked to make this classic for both T-day and Christmas dinners every year.  I'm not a fan of the condensed soups in a can, and I keep saying I will make it from scratch, but time always get the best of me and I turn to this recipe again and again.  I never use all the milk called for.  BTW, canned beans turn this dish into a mushy mess!  Only made that mistake once!

I gave this 3 stars because my family and friends prefer my take on this ages-old recipe.  First of all, I never use milk AT ALL and it turns out perfect.  Second, I don't mix the onion rings in with the beans because they get soggy.  I place them on top during the last 8 mins just to get golden brown.  And finally, I add a couple of tablespoons (to suit individual taste) of blue cheese OR cheddar cheese.  The blue cheese is our favorite because it gives it a unique taste.

I love green bean casserole, and this recipe is a classic.  I made a couple of changes, using worchershire sauce instead of soy since I prefer it.  I also added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms.  I thought that with the added volume, a full cup of milk would be appropriate, despite the reviews saying that the full cup was too much.  I was wrong, the full cup was still a little much, although I think after being stored (in the fridge, of course) and reheated it may thicken.  But straight out of the oven it was pretty runny.  The hardest thing about this recipe was waiting for it to cool so that I could dig in.  And the 10 minutes estimated prep time for me included clean up time as well, it was VERY simple.

Make this every holiday.  Very easy!  Instead of using soy sauce I subsituted with Worchestershire sauce and it turned out great.  Don't overdo the milk or mushroom soup or it will end up too watery and mushy.

Green bean casserole was never our favorite dish, but this year I made it for Christmas and it stole the show!  The key is fresh green beans.  Of course, a little Asian fusion created by the addition of soy sauce is a big flavor booster, too.  There are two ways to cook the green beans: 1) blanch the green beans in boiling water until slightly tender; 2) mix uncooked green beans into the sauce and bake for 1 hour.  I took the second route, and the green beans were cooked through but still had a good bite (there is nothing worse than mushy vegetables).  I also added extra French fried onions at the end to give extra crunch and flavor.  This casserole is extremely delicious!  I made it along with "Cornish Game Hens with Garlic and Rosemary," found on this site.

I use the French's variation but this recipe is a good one, you can't go wrong with this dish. However I do have preferences and my own tips to it. I had it with the canned green beans last night and whilst it was good (there was none left) we agreed it was far better using fresh green beans. We had done this on Easter and it was far better with the fresh gently cooked green beans (cook your green beans in chicken broth it'll get better flavor) we used more onions then the recipe called for as we really love onion around here and we added a pinch of seasoned salt (Rosemary salt) it really just gave it that extra flavor it needed. It's a great dish and I love it.

This is a family favorite. But I've modified it by eliminating the soy sauce.  I add only 3/4 cup of milk but 3/4 cup fat free sour cream (this helps to thicken the sauce).  Drained and chopped water chestnuts add some crunch.

The classics always win. I used low fat cream of mushroom soup (no one could tell), and I did reduce the milk to 3/4 cup because I did not want it to be too runny. I also used 2 cups of the soup and 3 cans of french cut green beans, and the ratio was perfect for a 9x13 baking dish. Will make again, as always.

I replace the milk with sour cream and take it to pot luck dinners. Usually there are a few other green bean casseroles there that have been made with the original recipe but mine is always gone first. I always get requests for the recipe. You just can't beat the taste improvement with sour cream.

My family and other friends love this when I put  in bacon bits and diced ham.  I always use  the soy sause it adds a little flavor that  people wonder about. We add some almonds slices on top along with the fried onions.  When you add the extras you will need the cup of milk.

This recipe is great! My family loves it, even my two young boys.  I sometimes like to make it into a main course by mixing in 2 cooked chicken breast (cubed), 1 small onion (diced), some garlic (minced), and some sliced mushrooms.

i love green bean casserole but i have never made it the way you're actually supposed to. i tried it for thanksgiving last year and ended up having to throw most of it out because the soy sauce made it taste kind of funny and no one ate it. this year i've decided to try one can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, one can cream of cheese, and one can regular cream of mushroom. i will omit the soy sauce and opt for fresh herbs for flavor instead. we'll see how it turns out.

This is such a classic recipe, I only made a few changes...Used frozen petite green beans and I just add the milk until I get the right consistency, and I added in some garlic pepper, onion powder, and used a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce...We loved it!

I've been making this casserole for years. I use fresh green beans and never add milk or soya sauce. It's perfect with just the mushroom soup, some grated cheddar cheese and french fried onions. I also do the same with fresh broccoli and cauliflower, using 2 cans of soup. Delicious!

The Casserole turned out liquidy and the Cream of Mushroom flavor overwhelms the green bean taste.  The French's Onion taste good but it's not very healthy for you. 

Recommendations:
I would add flour to the mixture to thicken the sauce.  Also, reduce the amount of Cambell's soup, add milk instead of water for a smoother taste. Finally, increase the amount of green beans

I grew up on this recipe and absolutely LOVE it. I make it often for my own family now, but sometimes I change the regular flavored french fried onions to one of the more savory flavored french fried onions, like garlic or pepper seasoned.

I made a few alterations and this was some of the best green bean casserole I've made. I used two packages of frozen juillienne green beans, only half a cup of milk, and added about 3/4 cup of mixed shredded cheese. Yummy!

Best to use less milk, produces a creamy dish. Also best to use green beans that are cut french style (sliced in thin strips). French-style beans are more delicate in comparison to regular green beans that can be kind of tough and rubbery. Also make sure to thaw frozen green beans and microwave for a little bit to cook some of the water out of them.

Just like what I grew up on. Didn't have soy sauce, used "W" sauce. Might use more next time & will DEF add more spices. It needs a little "oomph" :) Think this would be FABULOUS with extra fresh mushrooms, too!!!!!! WILL MAKE AGAIN & SOON!! :)

I make this every Thanksgiving, I love the french onion, (who doesn't?) However, this year, I am going to follow the recipe but omit soysauce, a little less milk, and add about 2-3 caremelized for an extra kick! Then top with the french onions, cause I find that last year it was good, but it could have been better if it wasn't as "milky" and I will be using fresh string beans (steamed) then cut! Happy thankgiving all!

I make a basic version of this.  Just the green beans, cream of mushroom, and french fried onions but about 5 minutes before it comes out of the oven, I add shredded cheddar cheese on top and then add more of the fried onions on top of that and it comes out all cheesy and gooey.  SO good!

We've been using this recipe in our family for a couple generations now and it's by far the best (the Campbell's recipe).  The soy sauce just gives it a perfect kick - unlike so many others.

I  add some crumbled bacon for flavor and usually also add either slivered almonds or water chestnust for added crunch. I gave it a 4 "as is" since I do change it. I have used Worchestershire sauce (not soy) in mine in the past. Since it "ain't broke" I don't think I will try the soy instead.

The Holidays would not be right without this casserole!  I use evaporated milk and pour in the whole large can if I use enough green beans.  The evaporated milk bakes up so that it is not runny and gives an extra creaminess -- extra calcium too, without the extra fat of cream.

A family tradition, but living overseas, I sometimes can't get the French's onions and have substituted potato sticks or potato chips, along with dried onion flakes. It isn't exactly the same, but not too bad. I also reduce the milk to 3/4 C and leave out the soy sauce. Canned french-cut green beans are my favorite to use.

i know i'm in the minority here, but doing this to a green bean should be illegal. i can eat green beans cold out of the can, but nothing else but curry can turn my stomach like this "holiday classic".

If you are looking for the basic green bean casserole then this is it. I usually only use one can of soup and half the milk because I prefer it to be thicker and have a stronger green bean taste. the fried onions do not stay crispy when stored and reheated. A staple we must have at every holiday!

Best ever! I added in an additional 1/2 cup shredded cheese, and 1 1/2 cups of cooked, chopped bacon. For the milk, I substituted 1/2 cup half & half and 1/4 cup milk. So wonderful - there was nothing left after dinner!

I am not one to always follow the recipe, so I'm not sure if my rating is accurate, since I altered it for my family and I. I used way less milk than called for. I also added in a few dashes of worcestershire. I sprinkled in shredded cheese when I was mixing the green beans, soup, onions, etc together. Then I topped it with more shredded cheese and onions the last 5 minutes of baking. Yum!

I thought this was pretty good. Like others have said it was a tad watery and salty. I think, that can be an easy fix by reducing the milk and soy sauce back some next time. I used 1 50oz drained can of green beans, for 1/2 the recipe and it was real close to what I needed. I would go that route if using canned to save money as the recipe does take quite a bit of green beans. As so many people like this, I would consider making it as a quick throw together side dish on Thanksgiving with slight modifications. I do like the idea of the cheddar on top under the footnotes.

This casserole is a must for our Thanksgiving table.  This recipe is similar to the one I use.  It was good but I'd skip the soy sauce and use less milk as it was runny.

Many people love this recipe, and I really tried to like it.  Even with my tweaks, I prefer other ways to prepare green beans.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, decreased the milk by half, left out the soy sauce, and added 4 pieces of crisp bacon.  Bacon helps this, but it still won't make it to my holiday table.

This green bean casserole was ok. I precooked the green beans. I also mixed in cheddar cheese and topped it with the cheese at the end. I did enjoy the easy-ness of making this. I do prefer the Grandma's GreenBean Casserole recipe on this site.

I had not fixed a green bean casserole for many years. I went all out and even purchase fresh green beans...I did not care for it. Maybe I just don't like green bean casseroles with mushroom soup anymore.

I make this all the time. The first few times I made it I actually did not have any french fried onions so I made my own which I think made it even better- but took a lot longer. The other day I made this a little healthier by using sauteed onions inside the casserole and added only 1 cup of the fried onions on top at the end. It was still delicious!

It was really bland. My family gave it a thumbs down and I threw it out because no one ate it. It needs more seasoning, maybe use cream of chicken soup and real mushrooms. I won't be making his eagain!

Decided to opt out of adding the milk that the recipe called for and ended up with a thick, rich base.  Also decided to use French style green beans.  Overall, a great classic!

Few tweaks from Grandma Lucy's recipe makes this recipe so good (albeit so bad for you - but what the heck - we only serve this at Thanksgiving).  Mix beans with cream of celery instead of mushroom and mix with crumbled Ritz Crackers, and milk as needed but I rarely add any.  Mix in chunks of Velveeta cheese (yes Velveeta), omit soy sauce, bake as directed and top with onions for last 5 - 10 minutes.  My 5 stars are for this revised recipe which is all raves.

This recipe has been a tradition for Thanks giving for years. I use 1 can Golden Mushroom and 1 can Cream of Mushroom for a prettier color and richer taste. Also, I use low sodium soy sauce or skip it altogether. Reduce milk to 1/2 c. and 1 c. french fried onions in the sauce and 1/2 c. on top makes it less runny and not too overwhelmed by the onions.

I substitue the cream of mushroom for cream of celery as I don't like mushrooms, I also add cheddar cheese into the beans as it cooks.. I make this casserole every thanksgiving and it's always a huge hit, never any left over!

Great basic green bean casserole recipe.  You can do so many things with this - add cheese, fresh mushrooms, fresh green beans and the list goes on and on.  We love this recipe with extra french fried onions and french cut green beans.

I made this dish minus the soy sauce and with only a 1/2 cup of milk...it was amazing! Perfectly creamy and delicious. There were plenty of leftovers and it even tasted good the next day. From now on, I will use THIS recipe!

I love green bean casserole.  Fresh green beans makes all the difference in the world.  I omit the soy sauce and add sauted diced onion and  mushroom.  I never really measure the milk because I think 1 cup is too much.  I just add as I'm mixing and stop before it gets too runny.  My family loves the fried onion, so I put lots inside the casserole and a bunch on the top too :)

I like this recipe, but like others have said, it needs some tweaking.  I use less milk, do not use soy sauce, and use cream of onion instead of mushroom.  I have made it with canned and frozen green beans.  This year I am going to try it with fresh green beans.

As written, I don't like it.  I am from the south where green beans are cooked a long time so that's what I did. Cooked them for an hour with a little ham chunk in them.  Drained them and then made the casserole.  I don't like mushroom soup either so I used cream of chicken soup.  Delicious!! Throughout the day I ate 1/2 the casserole!

It is a basic, simple, delicious side dish! If you think the recipe calls for too much milk, use evaporated milk instead. It makes it much richer and thicker. I don't use canned onions. I slice shallots very thin and lightly flour them, then toss them in my hot iron skillet till juuust starting to brown and drain them on paper towel before topping the casserole.....yummy!

It was ok. It could use some type of spice or different flavor added to it. Too much cream of mushroom flavor.

This is your basic green bean casserole recipe, which I usually just wing, but decided to follow this one and use fresh green beans like others had suggested. It tasted good at the time (had to cook the beans the day before so they were ready), but wasn't as good heated up later. Pretty bitter. I'll use canned beans next time, like I always do, and it always comes out good.

I followed the recipe as written.  However, it was not the most popular dish at our Thanksgiving table, as there were lots of leftovers!  It could've been because we had several casseroles.  If you have several casseroles (ie, cornbread casserole, stuffing, etc) I would recommend regular french green beans buttered with almonds rather than this dish.  However, by itself with a main course, it may do very well.

What are the Holidays without green bean casserole? Some people try to fake it with broccoli casserole, or some other less than satisfactory substitute! I took another reviewers suggestion and used about 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of milk, and it really did make the difference, it wasn't as runny. I also added a 1/2 c. sharp cheddar into the mix!

Five stars because of some changes-I omitted the soy sauce and instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of chicken soup. I also added freshly shredded smoked Gouda cheese (1/4-1/2 cup or as much as you want) along with a 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan/Romano cheese and added a bit more fried onions into the mix (and on top of course).  Always turns out fantastic.

Hey, there's a reason this is a classic.  I have made this before by just winging it and mixing green beans with soup.  This was my first time to follow the original recipe.  The soy sauce was a nice touch, and I used condensed milk after reading reviews about it being too thin.  It was perfect; just what the family wanted for Thanksgiving.

flavor=okay, consistency= way too slimy/mushy.   tells you to add way too much soup and shouldn't include the milk at all..... I put how many green beans it specified and one and a 1/4 cans of the condensed soup before I checked to make sure it wasn't going to be too slimy to add the rest of the can of soup, only to find it was already way too slimy.  added two more cans of green beans to compensate but it still came out mushy :( i traded the soy sauce for worchestershire sauce as other people suggested and it gave a good flavor.  would NOT add the onions in the middle of it or it becomes even mushier I bet.  I have never heard of putting the french fried onions INTO the beans, only on top so I didn't follow that part... perhaps that's why they thought more liquid would be necessary?

This recipe was a BIG hit! Thank you so much for the recipe and the suggestion in the reviews. Like everyone had mentioned, I omitted milk all together, substituted worcestershire sauce for soy sauce and added cheddar cheese. Out all the dishes, everyone was raving about the green beans casserole! Thanks:)

I can't say enough about how much I love this casserole.  My mother made it years ago, and I haven't had it in a while, but I have to say I ate almost the entire casserole myself (over several days, that is).

I used fresh green beans and they were crisp and sweet and worked perfectly with the creaminess of the Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup.  And I have to say, I've never put soy sauce in this recipe before, but it sure gave it an extra (excellent) kick.

I would make this again, not just for Thanksgiving, but any time of year!

My family doesn't care for mushrooms, so I always make this recipe with Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom.
It's a tried & true classic recipe that always gets rave reviews from guests.

I made these for my mother in law since our family doesnt like Cream of mushroom or fried onions.  She liked it but said the ones I usually make are much better.  She said it was standard recipe, taste good but not amazing.

This recipe is always a classic and I always enjoy the flavor and the crunch.  Making it myself was just as yummy.  Next time I will definitely add the red pepper!

Perfect! I did eyeball the milk a little because I didn't want it to be too soupy. I went with about half a cup, and it turned out perfectly. I think it may have been a bit too much if I would have added as much milk as the recipe states, so that's why I'm giving this recipe four stars instead of five. Nothing gourmet, but a very satisfying traditional green bean casserole.

Been a favorite dish of ours for years now. Can't have Thanksgiving without it! (Only thing we changed from the recipe is no soy sauce, no one here likes it.) No complaints year after year.

I used my husband as my "guinea pig" since I am not a fan of green bean casserole and I felt like I couldn't give an honest opinion for this review.  He thought this was just ok.  It was a little milky and didn't have as much flavor as we would have liked.  I think if you like green bean casserole this is a good recipe to use as a starter point, but, it will need a little bit of tweaking.

This has to be one of my favorite sides for any meal. I do omit the milk entirely for a thicker casserole.

All of my family really enjoyed this! When other people have made it for me, it always seemed too "soupy" but ours didn't turn out that way - it may be because I accidentally added all of the fried onions to the mix at the beginning (which I'll do again). For a twist, I also used the cheddar-flavored fried onions. Again, well-received by all.

I made the recipe as written.  Next time I might leave out the soy sauce.  It is really good with fresh green beans and the french onions.  It is your traditional Thanksgiving green bean casserole.

Tried it for Thanksgiving and everyone said it was ok but not as good as our regular (boring and plain) beans, mushroom soup and fried onions. I wanted something special and thought the soy sauce and milk might do the trick. We found it too watery for our tastes and the soy sauce was just odd.

Yum yum!  Easy to make, even for a cooking dunce like me.  I took some people's advice from prior comments and omitted the soy sauce and only used 1/2 cup of milk.  It turned out great!

This recipe was delicious! I did modify a few items..
*Used worcestershire sauce in place of soy sauce
*fresh green beans instead of canned
*added fresh mushrooms (first saute in butter)
*used seasoned french fried onions (garlic & pepper)
*Baked for 25-30 mins @350 F 
Everyone loved it :)

I followed the directions as written (well ok I added some extra onions) and it came out fantastic.  Took this to a church Thanksgiving potluck last night and between the 3 or 4 there, this was the first one to go!  We used fresh green beans (cut and blanched for a few minutes) so the color was so much more vibrant compared with the other casseroles.  My husband was against making the casserole initially because he thought I was using the canned green beans (which he has a weird aversion to), but he said he wanted this one again.  Thank you, Campbells!

We make a white sauce first using flour, butter, and milk, then melt in velveeta cheese, mushroom soup, and add green beans.  We don't care for the dried onions, so we smash up saltine or townhouse crackers and put on top instead.  I've had many compliments on this dish with these changes.

It turned out well, but it was watery. Maybe I added too much soup. Anyone tried this recipe with soy milk? I didn't have milk so I used soy milk. I wonder if that's what made it watery...

I had always heard of Green Bean Casserole being a traditional family gathering dish, but had never made it, or had it. We were having a family get together so I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly, and was overwhelmed by the blandness! I wish I had given this recipe a trial run before serving to guests! This will not be part of our family tradition! :(

So good! I halved the recipe and probably used less milk than called for.  Definitely one of my faves- I don't wait around for Thanksgiving to make this one!

Good base for a classic dish. I love green bean casserole and make this with my own yummy twist. Instead of milk use a full cup of heavy cream and take out the soy sauce. This gets rid of the watery issue and adds such creaminess...I also swear by organic dairy, it makes all the difference in the taste! Forget your diet just this once and splurg on the organic cream. You will not be sorry =)

Used Cream Of Chicken soup because I am allergic to mushrooms, so I know the taste is a bit different, but this was delicious! I served this on Thanksgiving and it was eaten up.

If you have anyone who does not like mushrooms you can always substitute Cream of Celery soup for the mushroom soup and it tastes great...ask my husband.

to answer the crockpot question: I make this in the crock pot all the time.  I put it on high for about a hour and stir it a few times (so it doesn't stick to the sides).  Then, put it on low.  I add the onions to the top after I put it on low.

A good, simple recipe. I didnt find the soy sauce necessary. For some extra flavor, I used one can of regular cream of mushroom, and another of garlic cream of mushroom.

I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday and it was pretty ho-hum.  Not a flavor explosion at all.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 1/2 the milk called for; I did this based on other reviews of the sauce being too thin.  The end result was ok - but nothing spectacular at all.

This dish confirms my "ugly food tastes better" claim. I added garlic powder and sliced almonds. I used the milk and it seemed very watery when I put it in the oven, but it came out perfectly. I'm guessing, as per other reviewers, the milk can be skipped. Didn't taste the soy sauce at all. I plan on making this a staple side dish!

Really good recipe.  After reading a few other recipes I made a few changes.  Omitted the soy sauce and replaced with a splash of worcheshire, I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom & one can of cream of onion.  I also added the optional 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.  I used fresh green beans instead of canned & baked for about an hour.  Delicious :)

We did not like the flavor of the soy sauce and felt the milk made it too thing.  Instead I use evaporated milk for a richer flavor.  I also add a small bag of sliced almonds for a crunchier taste. Jude and Family

This is a good recipe.  I just made a few changes.  I added some crumbled fried bacon and sprinkled a little canadian steak seasoning  into the casserole while mixing.  I also used low sodium canned green beans because of the added sodium in the steak seasoning.  These added flavors puts this plain dish over the top.

Boy, I almost messed this one up!  I didn't catch in the ingredient list that the green beans needed to be COOKED and I mixed this up with them being raw and popped it in the oven.  After the 25 minutes I had my hubby try a bite (I'm NOT a green bean person at all!) and he mentioned it needed more cooking time.  THat's when I re-read the recipe and saw it called for cooked green beans - YIKES!  I ended up cooking this dish in the oven for about 60 minutes, stiring it every 15 minutes or so.  The end result - everyone at Easter dinner liked it!  Shwew!

Yeah, it's just plain old good, but let me tell you a secret. I was out of cream of mushroom soup, and made it with cream of chicken, and it was so great, we've never gone back! Also, I crumble bacon on top along with the onions, if I'm feeling like I may be looking too thin. You know how that happens somedays! Ha!

I tried this at Christmas.  Decreased the mild based on previous reviews so the texture was good however it was rather bland.  One guest thought it was good, the rest of the guests were pretty neutral on it.  Ok but wouldn't make it again.

Hubby loved it, he's a big green bean casserole fan and mine normally aren't that great.  This was perfect!  (I did add some salt though.)

Ah the holiday green bean casserole... I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 not for the taste (which is always good!), but for the amount of milk. Why so much? I like my casserole on the thicker side and this was more of a runny mess. Less milk next time! :)

Traditionally, this deserves an A+. I can't think of a holday table that I sat at growing up that didn't have this. I made this a couple years ago for a holiday dinner with my husband's family, with shredded cheddar cheese stirred in.
There were no leftovers.

This is must have for Thanksgiving! My mom used to make this, so I make her way, with canned french cut beans, and sprinkle the entire surface with the large can of fried onions! I've tried it with fresh green beans, but it's just not the same for me. This dish brings back good memories of my family, and I love it the next day, all mushed together with leftover stuffing and cranberry sauce. Ah, good times..

Best Green Bean Casserole I've ever had.  I didn't have soy sauce so I used Worcestershire sauce instead.  I'm not sure how much it changed the flavor but it was delicious.

One of my absolute favorite Thanksgiving dishes. I  usually leave out the soy sauce, but I add in some Cajun Seasoning to give it a little kick that still fits in perfectly!

Turned out pretty good.  My family is kind of "meh" on green bean casserole anyway.  Have to say it was as good as any I've had.  Definately liked being able to make in the crock pot.  I have a tri crock pot so I can make up to three foods, this worked out well.

I have had this for years. However, the original recipe did not use soy sauce. We use a can of Campbell's Cheddar cheesesoup & reduce the milk to 1/3 cup. That version gets 5 stars from me.

My family loves this recipe, but we have onion allergies, so instead of the canned French Fried Onions, I use a can of La Choy Rice Noodles (not the Chow Mein Noodles).  The noodles give the same amount of crunchiness to the dish, and everyone can eat them!

I have been eating this my entire life.  We made it for every holiday, and sometimes "just because".  I have tried different variations, but always come back to this.  I feel like a kid again every time I make it.

I used brocolli instead and tweeked it a bit, (added some carrots and used a bit of the broth from the turkey I was making to make flavors match a bit) but it was the perfect Thanksgiving casserole as usual :-)

I made this as written at Thanksgiving and was not impressed, so after reading the reviews, I folllowed up and made it again. This time I did not add any milk or liquid. I used the reduced fat mushroom soup and freshly steamed green beans. It was flavorful enough but looked better than it tasted. I am curious as to why no nutritional analysis is given for either variation reduced fat soup or regular. If I were to make it again, I would make a bechamel and add sautéed button mushrooms for the sauce. The French's onion topping is an indulgence but okay as an occasional treat.

Well this is a classic. My family loves green bean casserole so they were happy with this. I always leave out the soy sauce because the dish is salty enough with out it.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving. I made a few changes mainly because of my families preferences. I used cream of chicken soup and made my own french fried onions(dipped in flour and buttermilk then fried). This came out pretty good. Not sure I would make it again simply because my family preferred other side dishes to this. Thank you Campbells for sharing!

My neighbor made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. Using THIS recipe (tho she does add more of the french fried onions) It is DELICIOUS! And this is a comment from someone who has been served this for years, and I couldn't stand it. It looked 'wrong' and tasted even worse. She used the french style green beans (which I think worked GREAT) She added MORE of the french fried onions to the mix so that it actually holds up like a casserole and not just soup with green beans thrown in. Bakes, stirs and tops just like the recipe and with the soy sauce. I'll be making this for Christmas. She's converted me, and I wouldn't touch green bean casserole. If you are finding this too soupy, try adding more french fried onions like she does, it really hit the spot!

This casserole has been a standard dish on my family's Thanksiving table since I was a kid. Everyone loves it, and there's never much, if any, left over. I always increase the amount of French fried onions (the best part). I usually combine everything a few hours ahead of time and just pop it into the oven to bake in time for dinner. Couldn't be more simple.

I dont normally make this for Thanksgiving...but this year decided to try it and glad I did. Was never a fan of this dish as a kid....but this time around, it was very good. I used frozen green beans instead of canned. I also added more crispy onions than called for. Creamy and very good....very easy to prepare also...made the day before and then reheated on Thanksgiving. Thanks!

For a change, I deconstructed the casserole and cooked fresh whole green beans separately, then made a sauce, adding gruyere cheese and sliced mushrooms to the soup, in addition to omitting the soy sauce and replacing it with thyme.  A little dash of white wine too really made it great, and I poured the sauce between the beans and the onions-everyone loved it.

I had to substitute the traditional soup (Cream of Mushroom) for another.  I accidently forgot to get it.  It still came out great and I made a light cheese topping for it which was a key to the success.

This was super easy using steamable frozen green beans (I used cut).  I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in a square glass pan.  No tweaks, other than omitting black pepper per personal preference.  I'd never really eaten green bean casserole before, but I like this, as did Mr. LTH.

This is a classic recipe! I remember family making this since I can remember for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I never liked it until recent years and this was my very first time making it. It turned out fantastic! I made the recipe as written but added a little extra onion and bell pepper spice.

I've made this twice. The first time I used canned beans and cheese soup, and although mushy, the flavor was really good.  This past week I made it again with fresh green beans (which I steamed ahead of time to pre-cook them) and mushroom soup and we didn't care for it at all. Hubby and I both had one helping, and the rest sat in the fridge before I finally tossed it. My recommendation would be to use fresh green beans and cheddar soup, but I'm not sure I'll make it again. There are so many other delicious sides to have on Thanksgiving instead of this.

Eh... it was okay?  

The problem for me is that I've never actually tasted a green bean casserole, as my family never served it at any functions or festivities.  Maybe if I'd grown up with this dish, I'd love it like my husband does.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I feel like using Campbell's is probably not as good as a more made-from-scratch approach.  

Nonetheless, I'll keep it on file.  My husband says he liked it.

just delicious! i halved the recipe using 1lb fresh green beans (but i didn't halve the onions).  we were out of soy sauce, which seems superfluous anyhow. it seems way too easy to taste so good!

First let me state that I didn't use the canned stuff. I used "Cream of Mushroom Soup I" which is my go to recipe for CoM. With that said, my husband gave it 2 stars. Josceline gave it 4 stars. I gave it 4 stars. I have made the top 5 green bean casseroles on AR and I think this was the worst out of the 5 BUT it is still edible and satisfying. I think it was the soy sauce and too much milk/soupiness.

This recipe is a holiday tradition that I couldn't imagine going without. I add 1/4 tsp dill weed, 1/2 tsp liquid smoke, and a dash of garlic powder for a yummy kick, and undercook my frozen green beans so they don't go to mush after they're rebaked in the casserole. Instead of stirring the milk in before it's baked, I add only as much as I think it needs after the 25 minute bake time when you're directed to stir the mixture (perhaps 1/2 - 3/4 c. at most). This prevents things from being runny while maintaining the creamy texture. Enjoy -- this one's a keeper!

I love this recipe. I usually add some sliced fresh mushrooms and sometimes crumble bacon. YUM! I have made it with canned green beans and it is fine but fresh is always better.

I substituted Cream of Celery for Cream of Mushroom soup, as we don't like mushrooms.  It tasted fine, but was a bit bland.  Next time I'll add some bacon or similar to add more flavor.

First time i every made green bean casserole. Checking out the cooking channels and sites, apparently its a main dish at Thanksgiving, so since we're having family over this year I did a test run this evening. It turned out wonderful I thought, since first time the family has had green bean casserole. Even my kids liked it and they all never like to try new things. Didn't use the soy, oppted for the cheese and was good. Will use this Thanksgiving and hope the extended family will enjoy it like we all did!

i have never used this recipe before so the rating is for the one in this review. i just use the one on the back of the French's fried onion can and it is slightly different. my family has been making it that way every holiday and we love it! It's not too runny or anything and is just as good next day re heated.  I did find a cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic that i'm going to try. Also this recipe here is doubled the one from the can is for 6 not 12 that could make a difference as well. good luck and happy cooking!

I give this 5 stars after the following changes.1 cut the milk down to 1/4 cup per 2 cans of green beans.2 it really depends on soy sauce brand,if la choy is used or my preference is dale's sauce really changes the flavor  opposed to kikkoman soy or the sweeter tasting types.I use 2 cans green beans,1 can cream of mushroom,1 can of dried french onions,1/4 cup milk,1-2 tsp dale's and a pinch of pepper.

Very good dish. The soy sauce added some extra salt I don't think it needed. I halved the recipe.  I used only 1/3c milk and the sauce was thick.

I made a double batch and the only thing I would change would be to add only three cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup and decrease the milk. This was certainly good though.

This dish was creamy and salty, but it lacked a bit of flavor. However, it reminded me of my Grandma's green bean casserole from my childhood, so I will keep this recipe.

Try it with Campbell's Cream of Onion Soup.  We don't like the mushroom soup and it's in so many recipes.  I have begun exchanging and everything gets such a flavor booster.  Try it in any recipe that calls for a cream soup.  You'll love it!

I just made this last night for our "Friends Thanksgiving" dinner.  I always use fresh green beans (boiled) instead of canned.  I also omit the soy sauce and ground black pepper.  Instead I add sauteed onions and sauteed fresh mushrooms, diced ham and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Try it this way, and you will get many compliments on your dish!  I always do.

I make this at least once a month. though I use more fried onions, garlic and a dash of Louisiana hot sauce. I prefer the Louisiana hot sauce over Tabasco b/c it provides great flavor without overpowering the other flavors in the dish like Tabasco. The addition of other Italian style herb also work great.

This is the best way to make green bean casserole.  We use the french style cut green beans.  We don't use soy sauce or milk, just a little bit of salt & pepper.  So yummy!

A must have, especially on Thanksgiving Day.  This, and the corn casserole recipe -- it's expected that they appear on the table, they've become as much a tradition as the turkey.

This was an awesome and easy recipe! I did make some changes as always. I only used 1 can of soup and I am happy I did or this recipe would have been more of a soup than a casserole. I used 1/2 cup milk. I put 1/2 cup cheese into the casserole.I didn't have the french onions so I put 1 cup chopped onions into the casserole itself and then topped it off with 1 cup cheese and 1 cup bread crumbs.

We alway use frozen frrench cut green beans for this recipe, and have always used Worchestershire sauce rather than soy sauce.  Did the original recipe on the fried onion can call for Worchestershire sauce  way back when it was still made by Durkee?  Anybody other than me old enough to remember Durkee brand, lol?

Finally a recipe where the beans aren't swimming in soup!  
The only thing left at the grocery was cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic.  I was a little nervous at first but it turned out even better. I omitted the soy sauce because the soup had a strong flavor.  
From now on I will use cream of mushroom with roasted garlic!

This is always a holiday favorite...and I even make it every once in a while for a regular dinner and surprise my husband.  I always use fresh or frozen green beans in mine, I don't like the recipes that call for canned green beans I think they get mushy.  Although I feel that way about all canned veggies and almost always use fresh or frozen.

Bf loves this bc his mom used to make it.  I don't like it the way it's recommended.  I add a can of tuna and slip some cooked macaroni or instant rice in there when he's not looking (he doesn't seem to notice the noodles/rice).

I made this the first time at Thanksgiving and everyone loves it.  It is a classic and I love the cheese option.  I did that and will probably add some more next time.  I will also have to double the recipe as it was in such demand.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving!  I omitted the soy sauce and added 1/2 cup of chopped red bell pepper (it really adds to the mushroom soup).  Also I used the cheesey french fried onions instead of plain, used fresh green beans (not frozen or canned).  All you have to do is follow the recipe on the back a French's Cheesey French Fried Onions, add the red pepper, and delicious.  I'll make this again.

This was very good. I made a few changes, I use regular cream of mushroom soup, then mixed 1 cup of shredded swiss cheese into the mix. Then after it bakked for 25 mins, I put the frenchs onions on top in a circle, then 1/2 cup of swiss cheese in the middle and baked an additional 8 mins.

I halved this, omitting the soy sauce, using more pepper and a kiss of garlic powder.  I also sprinkled a bit of Sharp Cheddar into the mix.  It's a classic, and deserves it's rightful spot on your Thanksgiving day table.

I remember when this recipie called for GOLDEN mushroom soup, not the CREAm of mushroom soup. Try the Golden Mushroom soup, use frozen or fresh green beans and sautee in a teaspoon of butter and 1/4/ cup water. When still green but softened, drain water, add 1/4 cup almond liquor and a dash of ground nutmeg. Prepare as casarole directions above. The Golden Mushroom soup is MUCH better and the liquor adds a well finished nut flavour with the nutmeg.

Gotta give this recipe credit for being super easy when you are busy working on other things like the main course! I followed the recipe exactly except for reducing the milk to 1/2 cup and adding a sauteed yellow onion for more flavor. It's still missing *something* but I haven't discovered what it is yet! I will keep experimenting till I figure it out because it is nice to have this easy casserole for the holidays!

My whole family loved this. The sauce is so rich and tasty that you forget that you're eating green beans. I added a little bit of Italian seasoning. I used fresh green beans (3 cups) and added about 2 cups of cooked chicken. That way it was a meal instead of a side dish. It was ooh la la delicious!

I started out HATING that this dish always found its way to our Thanksgiving table. But once I had a bite, I had to have another. Now it is a staple. Our family is a "foodie" family, we out-gourmet each other every occasion, yet this condensed/salty/crispy concoction from the back of a soup can remains consistant.

At any gathering I have ever been to, this dish is always the star no matter who brings it. People eat it so fast it disappears quickly. Use frozen French cut green beans, leave out a little of the milk, and sprinkle a few of those crunchy onions in the beans for added flavor. Don't expect any leftovers!

Always a Thanksgiving family favorite!  Since it's the first leftover to go, we end up making multiple batches to go with the rest of the leftovers.  Tastes the best with canned green beans (french cut are my favotire for this) and you can always opt for the "no salt added" kind.  We made it with frozen green beans once, and it just wasn't as good because the beans weren't as soft and delicious, but it might be better if they were steamed first - or fresh.  Leave out the soy sauce and use 1/2 the milk.  In fact, I'm not sure we even add pepper.  Easiest Thanksgiving recipe ever.

I love this recipe but the rest of my family isn't to fond of it. They don't like the mushroom/onion combo which I absolutely love! If you really like onions like I do try adding some extra fried onions. It might not be too figure friendly but it taste really good!!! Also  the only thing I don't do is add the soy sauce and it still taste wonderful!!

My family loves this recipe, but I’ve found that sometimes it can end up runny even though I didn’t change anything.  I have found that draining my beans well made all the difference! I bought 4 cans on beans three of them regular cut and one French cut. I drained them well and put them in a container I put paper towel at the top of the container put the lid on and flipped it upside down and placed it in the fridge over night. The next morning I discarded the paper towel and put a new piece and returned the container to upside down position until I was ready to use it

This Thanksgiving I wanted to experiment a bit.  
 I used one can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and a can of regular. I also used 3/4 cup of evaporated milk and a 1/4 cup milk. One teaspoon Dales steak seasoning and one teaspoon Kikkoman soy sauce. I ground black pepper to taste which was probably a little more than they measured out.

I used a generic store brand French onion which I measured then rough chopped to mix in. I also added about a 1/4- 1/3 cup fine shredded sharp cheddar cheese into the mix (this was my first time using cheese in this recipe I was very nervous to go overboard). I followed the baking instructions an topped off with the remaining French fried onions in the bag that I rough chopped. A 6oz bag worked well for me. I was able to cover my 9x13 baking dish with topping.

Simple, easy, and very tasty. Based on the other reviews which said this was too runny/watery, I cut the amount of milk in half which worked pretty well since my end result was nice and creamy. I also mixed the soy sauce into the milk before adding to the rest of the ingredients so it would be more evenly distributed. I

This has been my Thanksgiving staple for well over 10 yrs. It is the one dish my family insists I alone make. I make mine a bit different though... This is for 24 servings [BIG family]: I omit the soy sauce, use nonfat or skim milk 2 cups for 24 servings), I add 1 whole tsp of pepper instead of just a 1/2, I add 1 whole pack of bacon (I bake it in the oven & chop it into bits), & I add 1/2 cup mild cheddar cheese (grated). Lastly, I add an extra cup or so of the french fried onions for more crunch in the green bean mix & as the finisher on top. My additions have never failed me. I've made this recipe for charity dinners around the holidays & expanded to feed 150+ people. Always gets rave reviews!

Did it in a crockpot for a work potluck. It turned out great in the crockpot on low for about 3 hours, stirring regularly. Then added the top layer of onions the last half hour without stirring any more. It was a huge hit!

Great basic recipe! I had no creamof mushroom but used cream of celery, then did a quick saute of several baby portabella mushrooms, tossed in a some chopped roasted red pepper and about a third of a yellow sweet pepper diced. Basic recipe sounds fine but this one can be adapted to personal taste without worry of ruining it. Made this to go with mashed potatoes and pork chops, a good combo.

Love this traditional recipe!  We make one change since some of us dont like mushrooms-I use Campbells Cream of Onion soup instead of the Mushroom soup.  Everyone loves the taste!

I love this recipe! I do however prefer to make it with the Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup, and use more french fried onions than called for, but it is always a hit. This is the first year I will be cutting the recipe in half, but still keeping this one in my reipce box.

No changes really except I don't care for the campbell's brand soups, I prefer the taste of the walmart brand or some other generic brand soups. But, I've been making this for years, it is my son's favorite!! The whole family likes it though.

I added the red peppers , lightly sauteed with the onions, and with a pound of bacon (as seen on another version).
Of course it was great.  This is one of the all time classics!.  So many ways you can play with the core recipe

This was so easy and perfect.  I made it and then worried because some reviewers said there was too much milk and it was runny.  Mine turned out perfect.  The casserole was thick and creamy.  Everyone loved it.  Simple and tasty!!

Yes, I made minor changes; substitute sour cream for the milk to make more creamy and add French onions in the last five minutes of cooking to add crispy texture.

This is the same recipe my mom made during the high holidays, 50 yrs ago.  It tastes exactly the same. It was important & awesome for me to taste this again & by my own hand & my very finicky nephew honestly enjoyed a second helping. Considering it contains vegetables, he was truthful in his statement of enjoying it.

This is a staple at our holiday meals. It’s great as written (with less milk) but my favorite tweak is to leave out the soy sauce and stir in some real bacon bits and shredded Swiss cheese. Amazing!

Made this last Thanksgiving. It was a hit! The kicker is that I completely forgot to add the milk altogether and this year they want me to make it again and leave the milk out again because they lived it like that so much. The milk makes it too soupy. Loved it and will love it again this year.

Loved it! Made it a teeny bit smaller by using 2 cans of french style green beans and only one can of the cream of mushroom. Also tried it with the chcheddar cheese in place of soy sauce. Super easy and very tasty :)

This is the tried and true go-to favourite for our family - even the kids eat this up and go back for more.   I add about 1/4 cup dehydrated onion flakes before baking, for added flavour (the kids don't even notice it's there!)  Just as good the next day on the rare occasion that you have any leftovers!

Loved it ! Added less milk and an extra can of cream of celery for flavor and thickness . Also added extra mushrooms and boneless pork chops ! 
Delicious flavor was added to the chops by all the yummy sauce ! Sprinkled the top with cheddar cheese and frozen onion rings

This is BY FAR our favorite green bean casserole recipe...the soy sauce makes a huge difference!  It adds the right "umami" flavor when whisked in with the cream of mushroom soup & milk.  Been making this recipe for years from a Campbell's recipe book I got over a decade ago - so fun to see it online now!  :)

This is a great base recipe. I added chopped turkey bacon and diced red pepper, and just a dash of milk. I also added 1/2 can extra soup and extra fried onions! Delicious!

We have it every Thanksgivings and at other time throughout the year. Somewhere along the way, I started leaving out the soy sauce so we will try it with tonight as I'm  pairing it with Salmom patties. Makes me hungry just thinking about it.

This was good,  but  the original recipe from the 60's used liquid from the canned green beans to dilute soup( no milk).  It also included bean sprouts and water chestnuts. My daughter still uses this recipe.  It's the best!

I use less milk than called for but don't change anything else. It's not very healthy, but it's a special holiday treat, kind of like cheese balls and butter cookies, right? Everyone pretty much loves this, and my family does too.

I make this at least twice a year. I use the listed ingredients but I use a lot more pepper, soy sauce and fried onions.  I  don't have a measurement it's just to my taste.

Also I like to make mine in the crock pot since it's easier to transport. To do that add all of your ingredients except the onions for topping. Cook on low for 2 hours stirring once per hour. Then cook on high for 1 hour. I then take it to my family's house put on the fried onion topping and throw the crock in a 400 degree over for about 10 minutes. Comes out perfect and fresh.

This is one of my holiday favorites.   I mistakenly purchase cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.   I added cheese to the topping in adfition to the soy sauce.   Every one preferred this version to the regular version.   I was very pleased!

In the casserole itself I used one can of regular mushroom soup and another can of roasted garlic mushroom soup along with fried onion flavored onion chips and used mild cheddar cheese to thicken the casserole and give a depth of flavor.  On top I used another flavor of onion chips....I used white cheddar.  All the flavors came together nicely.

I loved it! I have actually made this several times, sometimes as a side dish, and other times as a main dish by just cooking up some chicken or turkey legs, chopping those up, and adding them to the casserole. Very delicious recipe.

I love it, but it is my family. They didn't care much for it.  My son-in-law did warned me that he never like green bean casseroles when he was growing up, but it taste better than he remembers so he did have a helping of it.

I agree with many other tasters out there-- this is too much milk, however, it doesn't have to be ruined, simply add some cornstarch mixed with water and you will take control over the watery-ness this dish delivers.  I also added garlic powder and a plentiful amount of salt and cracked pepper for savory flavor.

After cooking it for Easter dinner, I thought I would never make it again...way too much Mushroom Soup. However, the leftovers weren't too bad!

Green bean casserole is always a hit, I changed the recipe a little bit I added more fresh steamed green beans/heavy cream and one can alone of the fried onions then also one can on top - the soy sauce.. it was part of easter dinner and it came out very rich, everyone loved it ...

This recipe is perfect with the milk cut down to 1/2 cup.  Any more than that makes it too watery.  Depending on the mood I'll use the cheesy fried onions instead of the plain.  Either way, this is a staple part of just about any holiday gathering. Yum!

This was good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and left out the soy sauce.  I fried some onion and bacon and added that to the cooked beans before mixing with the soup.  Since I don't eat mushrooms, I substituted cream of celery soup and that worked out fine.  4 stars since I didn't make it exactly to the recipe.  I'm not a fan of green beans, but this was fine and my husband loved it and cleaned up all the leftovers!

I have made this recipe several times now and I have found that this recipe is very good. However  there are two (2) adjustments that I make. First I only use 1/2 of the milk in order that the casserole will not be too watery. Second I use French Style Green Beans as they seem to have a better taste with the ingredients. Will be making this every year for Thanksgiving!

This was the only dish that was wiped clean. I made a few changes: I omitted the soy sauce as other reviewers suggested.  I added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms and just sauteed them with a 2 TBS of butter before adding the rest of the ingredients listed.  I used fresh green beans instead, but should have cooked them more softer & tender then al dente.  This was is a keeper for years to come!

The soy sauce in this recipe was kind of odd, or maybe it was the mixture. Overall, I think it tasted nice, but kind of different from how I usually make Green Bean Casserole. It tastes pretty good, but different from my norm.

I reduce the milk, use fresh green beans and add canned mushroom pieces.  I have also made this replacing the green beans with canned baby peas X 2, small canned mushroom pieces x 2 &  canned cut asparagus X 2 drained. My mother made her casserole that way. I do have to hide the onions till I make this or they will get eatten up.

I made this because we had someone over who I thought had to have it for thanksgiving.  I have always been a little snobby about it, but I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  I probably ate more of it than anyone.  I didn't change anything except I used liquid aminos instead of soy.  I also used regular cut green beans instead of the thin cut ones.  It was great and the french fried onions are delicious.
