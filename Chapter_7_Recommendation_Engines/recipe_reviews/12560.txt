For many, many, years I have been eating at a place in Trinidad, CA called the Seascape and they have always had Walnut Pie on the menu, but never available to order. Because of this I made a promise to myself to one day get a hold of a recipe and make it myself because I just had to try Walnut Pie. We loved it!!!!! I however used Light Corn Syrup as I did not have the recipe with me at the grocery store, and perhaps that gave it a not so sweet taste, which we thought was perfect. Delicious Recipe, soon to become a family favorite..

This is the best pie I have ever made.  I used the Basic flaky pie crust recipe from this site and it is also the best pie crust I've ever made.  I made this about 3 hours ago and have already eaten half the pie alone :)  Thats what I get for baking while pregnant lol.  Highly recommend!

Made this exactly as written, using a refrigerated pie crust (didn't have time to make my own). Easy and delicious! And it keeps remarkably well. Wonderful served warm with vanilla ice cream!

Easy, and makes a really great walnut pie, everyone loves it. Can also add a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on bottom with the walnuts for a really nice chocolate walnut pie. I also used 1 cup light corn syrup and 1/4 cup of sorghum or molasses for a little darker, richer filling. I didn't have dark syrup, but I loved the filling with just a little hint of molasses.

I made this walnut pie this evening and my husband and I loved it!  It doesn't seem as rich as pecan pie.  The only thing I did different was add and extra 1/2 cup of walnuts to the pie.  I will be making this again.  It is awesome!

My daughter made this pie for our local county fair. It placed in the top 10!
