Nice little biscuits.  I made my own self-rising flour (in a one cup measure: 1 1/2 t. baking powder and 1/2 t. salt; then add all purpose flour to cup and level off). I used lite sour cream just to use it up and I did add 1 T. of milk because my dough seemed really dry.  As another reviewer mentioned these didnâ€™t brown very well on top, even though I drizzled them with a little melted butter before baking.  So, I slipped them under the broiler just for about 30 seconds to give them a little better color.

This makes a very thick batter, almost a dough. The batter nicely fills 6 muffin tins. My biscuits took the full 30 minutes to bake. The sides browned nicely, but the tops were still very light. Next time I may add some melted butter to the tops about halfway through baking. I couldn't wait until dinner, and tried a biscuit. I half expected them to be bland, but they were delicious. The salt in the flour, richness from the butter and tangy undertone from the sour cream are a delightful combination. I spread a little homemade apple butter on one for a very tasty snack.  It's so quick and simple and can easily be doubled.

Expect a THICK dough when you make this. This is drop-biscuit consistancy. The flavor of these were good, though VERY crumbly. Like, I would bite into one and it would fall apart. That really was the only downfall for this recipe. When I eat a biscuit, I like to bite into it and not have to pick the pieces off of my plate. I think it could use another flavor besides the sour cream and butter. Next time, I'd like to add some garlic powder or something, if I were to serve this with dinner again. Maybe knead the dough a bit with a little more flour and see if cutting this with a biscuit cutter would make a difference. This would make a great breakfast biscuit with a homemade jam spread on the insides.

I tried this recipe as an experiment, just for grins, because some things about it were so unusual. What struck me? First, baking them in a muffin tin.  Second, at the moderate temperature of  350*, a temperature more for cupcakes. Third, a stick of butter for a cup of flour?! Finally, some reviewers reported the tops didn't brown. I decided to try this recipe with a different take.  I blended the butter with the flour until crumbly, then gently stirred in the sour cream, taking care not to overwork the dough so as to ensure tenderness.  I like the crusty, sort of crunchy, golden exterior of a nicely baked biscuit so I baked them at  450* on a cookie sheet, lined with foil for easy clean-up.  I dropped them onto the sheet in mounds and flattened them slightly.  (If I try these again I'd skip that step - maybe they'd  rise just a tad higher)  I was  pleased with the results,  all of which I expected.  I saved time and a pan to clean by dropping  them onto cookie sheets. The biscuits baked to a golden brown, including the tops - and in 10 minutes!  They were soft and  tender  with a crusty exterior.  And  because of all that butter they were rich and flavorful.  But...as I also expected, these were TOO buttery - you could use  half the butter (even if you had to add a little extra sour cream or even milk to compensate)  and these would be much better - less butter-saturated and a little less salty.  Four stars as I baked them, lower if baked as directed and they didn't brown.

I did 2 cups of Bisquick, 1 stick of butter, and 1 cup of sour cream! This was the perfect amount to fill a 12 count muffin pan. UNREAL! These are the best biscuits I've ever had. Won't be looking for another biscuit recipe....this is a keeper.

The recipe given is a dough, not a batter.  If you want a thick batter, use buttermilk instead of sour cream.  It also has more butter than usual.


To make a thick batter as described, I used:  A scant cup of whole wheat pastry flour (I always use whole wheat), 1/2 tsp each baking powder and baking soda.  Then I softened 3 Tbsp. margarine and mixed it w/ 1/2 c. lite sour cream and 3 Tbsp. water to get the right consistency & baked in a muffin tin as recommended, but at 400 deg in the toaster oven for 14 min. covered loosely w/ foil, and an additional 5 min. uncovered.  The batter created so much steam that they didn't have enough substance for biscuits.  There is such a thing as TOO light.  They did have good flavor.


Next time I will make it w/o water, as a soft dough.  I will use my own labor-saving method and make scones (faster than biscuits) by hand-forming the dough into a log about 3" diameter, then patting it down into a 3/4" thick rectangle on a small, non-stick toaster oven tray.  I then score it w/ a sharp knife into triangles--this size recipe makes about 5 good sized scones.  It is much easier than rolling & cutting biscuits.  I'll bake as I described above.

What this recipe has taught me is that by softening the margarine, I can skip the usual scone step of cutting the shortening into the dry ingredients, and that lite sour cream is a slight improvement over my usual buttermilk.

I appreciate learning to make already easy scones even easier.

I made these for dinner last night and had to stop my son from eating ONLY these biscuits.  I added garlic and cheddar chesse and baked in a mini-muffin tin.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to lightly grease the tins.  I think the cheese made them stick slightly. Thanks for the recipe

Quick, easy, tasty. These will work well for easy breakfasts for my husband...he can just zap them in the microwave and add butter and jelly.  I hope others give them a try now too.

I liked it pretty well.  I put some melted butter on top and broiled them to get some color.

VERY SIMPLE! Taste and texture were both light and airy. Added a little milk to get it to come together as I thought it should. I'm putting this one in my recipe box for quick retrevial.

Super Simple is right! For only having three ingredients, these are great. The sour cream adds a slight tang to the flavor and keeps them moist and tender. I doubled the recipe and it worked out perfect. Everyone enjoyed these and we will make them again. Thanks for sharing!

These were indeed very simple. However, I also had trouble getting them to brown, and thought they were a bit flat. I prefer fluffy bisquits, so i probably won't try these again.

Amazing! My whole family loved them, and it is very rare that we all like something.  With 3 ingredients, it could not be easier, either! Oh, and to make them a little healthier, substituting plain yogurt for the sour cream works beautifully!

My family has enjoyed this recipe for years.  It could not be more simple and easy to follow.  We call them Itty Bitty Butter Biscuits.  Some of the comments are interesting...people are adding lots of things that change the entire recipe.  One comment said she appreciated the tip regarding self rising flour.  that's what the recipe calls for.  If you are adding baking soda and baking powder, you are making a different recipe biscuit.  If you want add in's to this recipe, that would be a bit of cheese, or herb or maybe a little garlic.  Not buttermilk.  Light sour cream would be runny, no?  Lots of comments about muffin tins, which is right, but I hope you mean mini muffin tins.  I don't see that specified any where else.  These are supposed to be like 2 bite sized.  I think they are the best!  AS is.

First I added just a little bit of milk to get the las bit of flour out of the bottom of the bowl.  then I sprinkled all-purpose flour on the counter and gently patted the dough into a circle and folded it over a few times to keep them from falling apart too easily. I used a heart shaped cutter to cut them out.  These were fantastic and we will be making them again.

These are now the ONLY biscuits I make!  Usually, you have to sacrifice taste or quality, for simplicity in preparing.  NOT SO with these biscuits!  They are tender, flavorful and scrumptious!  Definitely a keeper!

I took the advice for the self-rising flour, also.  Thank you for that tip, bellepepper!  These were FANTASTIC!!!  I have 2 young children and so I don't have alot of time to spend in the kitchen, so these were perfect as a side dish to dinner! I added some granulated garlic (didn't measure exactly, but probably about 1-2 tsp). 25 min in the oven was perfect!  Thank you!

Only needed to bake these for about 11 minutes at 325 degrees, but my oven tends to run hot. Just a note for people to check them early. Mine browned nicely on top too.  (I used bellepepper's ratio for the self raising flour.) I also added about a third of a cup of finely grated cheddar cheese. And greased the pan so that the cheese wouldn't stick. Delicious!

I used 2c. biscuit mix instead of self rising flour. Then I added 1 stick (1/2 c) butter and 1/2 c sour cream plus a handful of shredded cheddar/jack cheese. Sprinkled in some Garlic Powder, Onion Powder and 1/2 tsp of Rosemary. I added milk then to the consistency for gooey dough and dropped by spoon fulls into the muffin tin...These biscuits are my favorite I've EVER made!!!

Quite amazingly good biscuits. I had no milk but did have sour cream so it helped.  Made the self rising flour with 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and a dash of salt. Instead of using a muffin tin I made drop biscuits.  They were so good, the family ate two before I could get a snap of all seven.

This is certainly super simple and turns out a good little biscuit. I made my own self-rising flour using the recipe from this site (add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder to 1 cup all-purpose flour). I also made them in mini muffin tins. Perfect for a ladies luncheon.

Super easy. A little crumbly. . Might try with cheese on top for a little extra flavour.

These are so tender!  I made 12 small, and 6-8 medium biscuits from each batch.  I'll be making these often and posted to Facebook.   Thank you for sharing this easy,  basic and delicious recipe.

So easy!
I didn't have self-rising flour so I added baking powder (1.5 tsp) and salt .5 tsp to AP flour. (Next time I'll cut the salt back to .25 tsp if I need to improvise).
These are soft, flaky, and delicious.

These are great. I have been using this recipe for years. Can cut a bit of the fat by using light butter and light sour cream. I also suggest doubling the recipe as 6 won't be enough! I melt the butter then add sour cream stirring until smooth before adding the self rising flour (or Bisquick).

Hubby loved them, probably because of all the butter! I had trouble getting them to cook all the way in the middle without being too crispy on the outside. All in all it's nice to use up the rest of the sour cream but I think I will stick to regular biscuits from now on!

Followed every instruction; the result was inedible.  Bland, crumbly as well as wet.

Wow! So easy and so delicious! I am not a great cook, but these biscuits turned out great. My husband hates sour cream, so I made sure he didn't see me make them. He ate them up! They were so moist and delicious warmed up the next day!

For ease these are great, for flavor, not the best but would be really good with gravy and with some jelly. Didn't need extra butter and liked the crunchy outside and moist inside. Very dense. I threw in a little sugar. I'm not the best at tweaking recipes so I really appreciate the changes that some people make on recipes. Gives me ideas that I would not have thought of. So, thanks for the easy good recipe and thanks to the positive changes some have made.I definitely will make again. :)

I would probably rate these lower (2.5?), but my husband liked them & I liked idea of cooking biscuits in a muffin tin.  I thought the taste was OK, but while making them, I had to recheck the recipe, as I could not get the flour to incorporate that much butter w/o leaving huge clumps.  In the end I added another cup of flour and a bit of milk.  As other reviewers have mentioned, they crumble (OK, that may have been my fault due to the extra flour) and are anemic looking.  And despite generously greasing the tin, they stuck terribly.  Last night, I looked up a biscuit-only cookbook I have and realized that none of the recipes had a 2:1 flour to butter (margarine/shortening/lard, etc.) ratio like this recipe. In fact, many had no extra fat except for what was in the milk, yogurt or sour cream.  I won't be making these again.

I made the biscuits this morning.  They are super simple to make, just like their name reads.  They are very delicious. The dough is firm enough that they do not have to be cooked in muffin tins.

I used fat free greek yogurt and made my own self rising flour based on some of the other reviews.  I aslo kneeded this dough by hand for a few minutes to let the gluten react, then rolled it out and cut the biscuts out, sprayed the tops with baking spray (I use the walmart brand) and baked them on parchment paper.  Kneeding the dough (and adding a bit of flour at the same time so it does not stick) keeps them from falling apart or crumbling.  These turned out wonderful!  I saved it to my recipe box and will be trying new flavors like garlic and cheese, maybe even nutmeg and pecans for a snack biscut.  Thank you to everyone who posted reviews and thank you to Katie-Kate for sharing it with us.  We loved this one!

I made these and added shredded cheese, garlic powder, and oregano to the dough. I then buttered the tops and sprinkled extra oregano on top. We all loved them!

The texture was nice and the biscuits did not stick to the tin, but they had a weird flour-y taste.  I would not make these again. And yes, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was super easy... the biscuits were super buttery and didn't need anything on them.  I did add half a cup of freshly grated parmesan to the batter before baking and the biscuits were melt in your mouth delicious!  Thanks for this recipe!
