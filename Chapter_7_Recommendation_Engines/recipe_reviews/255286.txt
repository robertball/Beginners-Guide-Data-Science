This is a great universal spice mix that could be used for many different things as the recipe submitter said. I do recommend starting with only a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and adding from there if necessary. I did find this to be a tad too salty so I will cut back on that the next time I make a batch. I used this on french fries last night and plan on using the rest as a meat rub. Good stuff! Thanks for sharing!
