This is an excellent dish.  Tasty and convenient if you are short on time. Be sure to not over cook the beef, add back to the mixture at the last minute or it becomes quite tough.

Flavor was prett good, but consistency of the sauce needs work.  Cooked the onions with the beef and substituted dried parsley for fresh. Substituted sour cream for yogurt.  Even after doubling the amount of yogurt called for in the recipe, I still found the sauce to be too thin for my liking.  If I make this again, I will cut back on the broth or water.

The sauce was ok, a little on the thin side and could use a bit more flavor. I have to say this was a very quick and easy dish to make. Using uncooked noodles saved a lot of time. I did not have yogurt so I used lite sour cream instead.

Good start to dinner but needed flavor - - Browned meat with onions, minced garlic, worchestershire.  Added to the sauce dijon mustard, nutmeg and vinegar!  YUMMY - served with simple cukes in a vinegarette!

So easy!!!! I agree with everyone. I added an extra can of soup. I also added mushrooms. I cooked the noodles before putting everything together. As foe the beef, I seasoned with garlic salt and pepper. Cut very thin and cubes it. I would cook it really slow so it doesn't get too tough.

Love this!  Who doesn't love a one pot meal?  I omitted the onion (we don't like them) and doubled the recipe (family of 6!) I added half a cup of water the recipe and used sour cream instead of yogurt.  Probably used closer to 1 to 1.5 cups of sour cream actually.  Don't forget to season your beef!  I put a little bit of oil in the pan, then tossed the beef in with salt and pepper.

really great and easy.  i used lite sour cream and dried parsely (right into the liquid mixture) and also added pepper to taste.   my toddler loved it which is the MOST important.  and of course left overs are always better too!!

So quick and easy!!  Tasted just as good as my "usual" recipe - but I liked cooking the noodles in the same pan then tossing it all together.....I will add some more seasonings next time, just needed a little more flavor!

This was yummy! Only thing I would do is maybe only add half an onion...not a huge onion fan, other than that is was quick, easy and tasty! Thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent recipe!! I just changed it a little. I had left over pot roast and used it and didn't have yogurt so used the light sour cream I had. Also added some Mrs. Dash and a little sea salt. The family went nuts for it!!!  Thanx for sharing!!

Very good and easy. I had to substitute cream of celery for mushroom because my husband has an allergy (!!) . Felt criminal  but it was quite delicious anyway.

Thought this was a good recipe. Added a little salt and onion powder to the meat for flavor. Used beef for stew.

i boiled the egg noodles in a separate pot using the beef broth.  I added little bit of broth until the desired amount of thickness is the sauces was reached (not thin or runny).  used cheap can of mushroom soup that was 0.69 USD.  
enjoy!

I used to love beef stroganoff, but I can no longer eat mushrooms so I am wondering what an alternative might be to the mushroom soup. I know it wont taste exactly the same but I love the rest of the ingredients so if there is an alternative I would like to know.

I really liked this dish! I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and added a packet of brown gravy mix.  The meat was a little chewy; this might go better as a slow cooked meal. I also added some basil and onion powder along with the parsley.

Love this recipe.  Easily adjusted to individual taste or to just cook with ingredients on hand.  We prefer sour cream over yogurt.  Beef broth made from beef base recommended.  Make 22 oz and skip the water.  Reserve 6 - 8 oz broth and add at end of prep to achieve desired sauce thickness.  Easily doubles.  Left overs, if any, are excellent.  Follow basic recipe and hard to go wrong.  Great comfort food.

Great flavor! My family liked it better than the boxed mixes you can buy. We did feel there was too much onion, so we will probably use only half an onion next time. Not fans of yogurt, so we substituted sour cream.

Without sour cream, it just didn't taste right.  It was a simple and quick recipe but don't expect the traditional Stroganoff taste.

Very good, switched cream of mushroom for cream of brocoli, me and the wife really liked it, kids, not so much because of the texture.

If you follow the recipe it is very bland. I added Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper and still didn't have a nice stroganoff flavor. From now on I will be going back to sour cream based sauces for the stroganoff.
