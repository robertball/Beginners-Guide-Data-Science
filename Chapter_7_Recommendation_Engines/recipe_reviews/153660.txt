No criticism, no changes, no suggestions...except to make this, and just as the recipe is written. Few recipes are perfect as is, but this one is in that category. Beautiful, flavorful, and extraordinary vegetable side dish. I could eat it by the bowl full! If you rate this less than 5-stars, it's only because you don't like Brussels sprouts in the first place!

Oh My Goodness...made these this evening.  Shaved them with my ceramic slicer and nothing could be easier.  Used olive oil and butter, then tossed in some REAL bacon bits at the end...Let them sit in the pan long enough to get a bit of brown/caramalized and they were delicious and nutty...even the teenaged boys who turned up their noses dove back for seconds.  FOUR teens ate brussels sprouts!!!  Hades has frozen over in our city.  A definate KEEPER...thank you

I have been making a similar recipe for years, and it has been a hit with even the non-brussel sprout lovers. I make it with a few differences.....instead of almonds, I use pine nuts. this is a very nice taste, saute until lightly toasted, and use seasoning salt. Also at he end, with the crumbled bacon, add sliced green onion tops. This is delicious!!

I agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser, but 4 pounds of Brussels sprouts is WAY too much. I used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly. I served it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers, which reheated surprisingly well.

MADE A  BRUSSEL SPROUT LOVER OUT OF M FAMILY!
Have made this 4-5 times in the past two months.  The kids (7 & 8 yrs old) love it and the men ask for seconds.  I am amazed at how good this is.  One change I did do when I was short of time one day was to cut the sprouts in 1/2 and then steam them.  I don't have a food processor and didn't have the time to individually chop each brussel sprout that day.  Turned out just as good.

We left the almonds out and this was still great. Very light. Almost reminded me of the innards of a spring roll. We will be making again & again (and I hate Brussel Sprouts)

This was great.  We used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts.  My husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3's or 1/4's and it still turned out great.  We realized we didn't have almonds and used pistachios and still good.  I'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans.

Perfect as it is. Hubby HATES brussell sprouts but devoured this when I made it to go along with pork chops, and even asked for seconds!

Very good!! My husband and I loved it. I did half the recipe and it was still a HUGE amount... could have fed a family of 6 easily.  Make sure you use thick slices of bacon so that you get enough fat to cook with, also make sure you slice them thin. I got a little lazy near the end of my slicing and the thick pieces took longer to cook. 
This is a fantastic recipe and I will be making it for years to come!

I took this to Christmas (potluck) and for those that liked brussel sprouts it was well accepted. I followed the recipe but found it bland....so I  added fresh mushrooms, onions, parma cheese, oregano and some red pepper flakes (as I like a bite to my food). Also instead of the vinegar, I used rhine wine. I agree with others...I used 4lbs of Brussels sprouts....and it WAS way to much...I put it in a 9by12 cake pan...brimming full....and baked it covered with foil...there was too much to try to cook it in a stove top pan.  The oven worked GREAT !!

Sounded great but was NOT exciting.  It made way too much (and we eat large portions of veg), needed to cook A LOT longer than stated, and I had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it.  It's possible that since I used center cut bacon that was the problem, but I will not be making this recipe as written again.  I too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers that nobody ate.

This is the path to brussel sprout love for those who haven't tried them or don't like them.  I'm quite sure that it is equally good as written, but I did sub pine nuts for the almonds.  Next time, I'm adding a minced shallot with the garlic and tossing in dry roasted pine nuts with the bacon.

I gotta say that this recipie had to be changed right away. First I did not have red wine vinegar nor almonds. SO, I used Wegmans Marsala cooking wine and pecans. Everything else was the same. BUT if you know the sweetness of pecans and marsala wine, you can imagine this dish having just a hint of sweetness to it. It is so awesome this way, I don't plan on ever trying it with the vinegar or almonds. My hubby who never liked brussel sprouts helps me slice the pecans and sprouts. I am serving this for company tomorrow night.

This was delicious! I will make this again and again. Only problem I had was the 18 hours it took to slice all the sprouts. Still, the effort was well worth the end results.

Texture is great but the bitterness of the brussel sprouts is accented by the vinegar I fear.

Love it!  I bought a bag of shaved brussels sprouts at Trader Joes and searched for a recipe.  Some consider this backwards, but I wanted brussels sprouts. Im so delighted I decided to make this!! DELICIOUS! I made a few adjustments:  7 slices of bacon (because bacon makes everything better).  In addition,  I used almond slivers since they were out of sliced almonds. I will be making this dish again (with a little less red wine vinegar). Reminds me of a fried cabbage dish I make during the holidays.

Made these and they are terrific.  Left out the almonds.  We've made it with cabbage before, so thought this would be a good change of pace.  It was.

This is my first review!  I thought this was terrible.  I didn't like the texture or the flavor.  You'd think any recipe with bacon would be worth trying, but not this one.  I'm sticking with steamed brussels and cheese sauce!

Hands down, THE best brussel sprouts I've ever eaten!! I made the recipe as directed but used only about 3 lbs of sprouts. After I added the sprouts to the pan and stirred to mix everything up, I added a wee bit of water as the pan was dry. This allowed the sprouts to steam and soften a bit. I'm not a huge brussel sprout fan but these were truly excellent. I loved the red wine vinegar in it...next time I may even increase the amount of vinegar. Even if you think you don't like sprouts, give this one a try.

Cut the recipe in half and only used 10 oz shaved brussel sprouts from Trader Joes. I think I would have liked this better without the vinegar

I have seen this recipe on Food Network and so looked it up here to try it. Bought brussel sprouts especially to do this. I love brussel sprouts, I can usually eat them all myself if everyone else decides to snub them. However, this time even I couldn't choke them down. I will probably be putting these in the compost unless I can find some way of masking them in something else. From now on it's just plain brussel sprouts and butter for me.

Wow-I thought this recipe was really fantastic.  I have had brussell sprouts with bacon but never thought to thinly slice them.  The addition of vinegar to the sprouts was really nice-I can't believe I never thought of that.  This was really almost like a salad-many possibilites.  Thanks for sharing!

I add more bacon, more vinegar and some green onions. This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. I love brussels sprouts in general, but this is heaven!

I'm one of those horrible grown ups who won't eat vegetables. And I ate these. And I liked them.
My boyfriend said these were the highlight of his dinner. They really were that good. I used a mandolin slicer to shave them and it was very easy and they looked great. We will definitely be having these again, soon!

As another reviewer suggested, I cut the brussel sprouts into quarters and then sauteed with pine nuts, butter, and olive oil.  I also added real bacon pieces at the end.  This was my first time to make brussel sprouts and they were great!

Excellent.  I did add some brown sugar to help with the carmellization, and used pecans instead of almonds.

I did not find these very tasty. I made them as a vegetable side dish for Thanksgiving last year and I found it a little bland. Also the brussell sprouts were a little tough. My guests liked them but it was definitely not a home run. Maybe if I had cooked the brussell sprouts a little in water? I would have cooked them in butter instead of the bacon fat to add some flavor.

This was very yummy.  It actually convinced my boyfriend (a profound veggie hater) to try Brussels sprouts!! While he only ate half, he a) actually tried them and b) had more opposition to the almonds than to the sprouts themselves.  I was out of red wine vinegar, so I subbed the white wine kind- not sure what the difference would have been... I ate them for leftovers too- just as good the next day.  Good work!

Wow, thinly slicing 4 pounds of brussel sprouts is VERY time consuming and the end results were just so so.  I had to do a lot of doctoring up just to make this dish edible.

I used toasted walnuts and left out the vinegar and it came out delicious! I used prepackaged shaved brussels sprouts and made WAAAY less. I ate the whole pan. The whole thing only took about 20 minutes, including toasting the walnuts separately. EASY!

I made this and it was delicious, my husband loved it and he HATES brussel sprouts. I did make a few changes though, I used 2 lbs of brussel sprouts and I increased the garlic, switched apple cider  vinegar for the red wine vin and cooked it quite a bit longer and put a lid on skillet halfway through to soften them up a little but not till they're soggy. At the end I mad a balsamic reduction and drizzled it over the top, made it ABSOLUTELY out of this world!

My husband says that this is the ONLY way to eat brussel sprouts.  I agree that they are pretty tasty... but I did have to add more 3 more bacon slices than called for and I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe stated.

Follow the recipe with all ingredients with the exception of the almonds. It was Delicious.  Even my 15 year old daughter ate them and she would not eat Brussels sprout for no one. This is a keeper in my household.

I used one pound of brussel sprouts with 4 slices of bacon and kept all other ingredients the same.   I added 1/4 cup of water toward the end of cooking and put a lid on them until the water was gone to soften the brussel sprouts a bit.   We loved the taste.   Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. Delicious. I bought fresh brussel sprouts in the summer when they were out of season. The flavor was alright but remember that the little ones taste best, not the big ones. Being out of season, there were a lot of big ones. 
Next time I will make sure that when I slice them, all the leaves are shredded even if there is some waste at the stem end of the sprout. In my case, some of the pieces remained in "slices" rather than totally shredded due to the fact that some part of the stem was still in tact. Next time I will definitely cut them so that there are no slices, only shredded leaves because the slices didn't cook as quickly and stayed pretty hard when the shredded leaves were on the verge of being overcooked.

I used less bacon to save a few calories but other than that made no changes.  We love Brussels sprouts and really enjoyed this dish.  I would not hesitate to attempt to convert a sprouts hater with this recipe.

I was a doubter but am now a convert! All the adults liked it, but the kids (5yo and 2yo) stayed skeptical. It was a new food and they don't like change. I'll server it nine more times and they'll be converts also.

This was pretty yummy, something different to have for dinner.  Something about the red wine vinegar didn't taste right though, and you have to be careful to cook the brussel sprouts long enough for the right texture.  
Thank you for a different type of recipe and for a new taste.

Made as written, and these are fantastic!  Thinly sliced starting at the end and tore each slice into shreds. Pan roasted until nicely wilted and caramelized.  Make them!

I make this recipe all the time and have converted non-Brussels Sprouts eaters to fans. To make it easier I slice bacon into small strips while raw and toss all ingredients together. I put on large backing sheet and roast in the oven; far less mess and wonderful crispy edges.

I added some diced mushrooms and green onions to the bacon grease before I put in the shredded sprouts, which was a nice addition.  I also cut back, and  just used about 1 lb. of the Brussels sprouts.  A bit disappointed in how they shredded, I used my food processor.  Maybe next time I will chop a bit more so that I don't have the big core piece. Overall it was a great dish though - and I liked it better than roasting .

When I made this recipe in the past the brussel sprouts were to crunchy in the middle.  This time, I steamed the sprouts in the microwave for 5 minutes before adding them to the pan and they turned out perfect for my taste. I think it depends on your preference, if you like brussel sprouts tender or crispy in the middle. Good recipe!

Best brussel sprout recipe that I have found so far.  I finished it with Wegman's Italian Classics Glaze in place of the red wine vinegar.  High quality balsalmic vinegar would work too. Do use the highest quality vinegar you can buy as it does make a big difference in the overall taste.  Since the vinegar is added at the end, play with the different varieties available such as fig or pear vinegars to suit your taste. Skipped the almonds, nice addition but not needed.

I love brussels sprouts, but the rest of the family do not. I thought I'd try this recipe for Thanksgiving in hopes of converting them and it worked! Everyone loved them. I did not change a thing. The brussels sprouts were crisp and the red wine vinegar complimented their natural flavour. This will definitely be made again, and enjoyed by all!

this isn't your mother's brussel sprouts! my husband does not like brussel sprouts but he said i've converted him. knowing how he felt about them, i had to find a way to make them that wouldn't cause a major problem. shredding them like they are in this recipe was just what was needed. i did make the following changes:
i only used 1 pound of fresh brussel sprouts - there's only the two of us.  used 5 slices of bacon - can't have enough bacon. no almonds (not a huge fan of putting nuts in my food). i did add two very finely chopped shallots for a little extra pizzazz and then to help make it a little sweeter for my husband, i added a drizzle of honey and balsamic glaze. i will be making this dish again.

Yes!  This recipe well deserves 5 Stars!  What a delightful side dish!  After seeing it in the Allrecipes Magazine, I decided to make this to serve with Sandy's Chicken Saltimbocca also in their Sept/Oct issue.  Didn't change a thing....perfect as is!  Thanks Boomdogo2 for a wonderful recipe.

I used about half the Brussels spouts and half the bacon. I broiled it on high for 4 mins to crisp the sprouts. Delicious. .

I didn't think I liked brussel sprouts, but I ended up with some in my crisper and decided to try them. I came across this recipe and gave it a shot. What a nice surprise!! I enjoyed this. My husband and teenager no so much. I would make it again for myself though! I scaled down to 2 servings but used 3 slices of bacon, and poured off most of the grease. Thank you for a great recipe!

We were hesitant to try this recipe, well, anything with Brussels sprouts really.  Our local market had them on sale so I thought we'd give them a try.  Man were we surprised!  I've never met anyone who liked Brussels sprouts until now.  This was a fantastic side dish paired with bbq pork tenderloin.  I didn't have any regular bacon on hand so I used turkey bacon and a little olive oil and it still turned out delicious.  We were very impressed.  Thanks for the recipe!

My hubby, who hates brussel sprouts, said that he was willing to admit that he liked this dish.  Thanks!
