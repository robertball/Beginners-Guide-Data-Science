Awesome! Thanks for the recipe, it was great. The only thing I did different was use hamburger buns (because I had them) - I did everything just as the recipe called for, but toasted the buns with the sauce and cheese in the oven for about 5 minutes.  Everyone raved about them!

If you like spicy, this is for you! I loved this! Made exactly as directed, only adding a tad of garlic and they were wonderful. The next time I make these I will add a slice of onion and maybe a tomato. Thanks for the delicious recipe Mrs. Martin!

These are a good burger. Very spicy, I made mine on Texas Toast; and I also took the advice of another reveiwer and put some fryed onions on them. Next time I might calm down on the chili spice. That tasted a little to powdery. But I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for something different for dinner and I noticed this recipe.  It sounded very good and was.  My husband who is a very picky eater even said they were very good and a nice change of pace.  I followed the recipe exactly except for frying the sandwiches in the left over beef grease, I buttered the bread and cooked them like grilled cheese to cut down on calories and they turned out great.  Thanks for the posting.

I made the hamburgers for this recipe exactly as stated and we can't put our finger on it, but we felt there was something that was a little too overpowering in the flavor of the meat.  We like hot, so it wasn't the heat, it was a spice, just can't figure it out.  I did use tortilla's instead of white bread and heated them until crispy.  The melted jack cheese and mayo combo was yummy!  The concept is awesome, so I'll be playing around with different seasonings on this one to make it fit perfectly for my family's tastes.  I'm thinking some sauted onion would be a good addition. Thanks for sharing.

I could not find any chipotle adobe sauce in our small town. I used Taco Bell chipotle dressing I had on hand. I also added some onion,crushed red peppers and cayenne pepper for our liking. My hamburger fell apart so it was a loose meat sandwhich. Over all I loved the flavor and seasoning. I don't think this would be a kid friendly meal for those who might want to know.

We did not care for these. I think the chili powder was way too overwhelming. I followed the recipe to a T.

The burger part of these is definitely five-star and I'm basing my review on that, not my changes. I didn't measure the beer, so probably used a bit more than 1/2 an ounce. They were spicy without being ridiculous and left a nice tingle in my mouth. I didn't add quite as much pepper to the mayo, but it was great. I changed everything else, but it was all super great. I used American cheese because I like the way it melts...I grilled the burgers and used sandwich thins instead of bread. Can't wait to eat the one we had leftover!

I enjoyed this different twist on the every day burger. I thought the heat was right, but if you cant take medium heat salsa, you may want to back off on the chipotle pepper to just one in the meat mixture. I did mine on the George Forman and can imagine how much better these will be on the Webber grill this summer with  the added flavor from the flame and some Guacamole sauce on top, YUM!!!

This was DELICIOUS!  I have never made a patty melt before but what a great way to make a hamburger. I used much less chipotle than was called for and I was glad. I only used about 1/4 of one in the burgers and another 1/8-1/4 in the mayo. It was plenty hot enough for my family. A super recipe.

Made these tonight exactly as written.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Very good flavor and not too spicy for me.  If you can't handle heat you might want to cut back on the peppers though.

Thought these were wonderful. I am laughing out loud at the thought that 3 teaspoons of beer could overpower 3 tablespoons chili seasoning mix and
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

I only used half a pepper in the burgers and half a pepper in the sauce and it was so spicy I couldn't even eat more than two bites. Won't make these again.

Wowsa! This tasted as good as something you'd find at a local diner! Not the healthiest dinner I've ever made, but my hubby and I enjoyed it!  I used much less chipotle as called for, and added some mild diced green chilies to the hamburger patties (I made 4). On the advice of several reviewers, I sauteed onions as well....great suggestion. We only buy wheat bread, but once pan-fried, I didn't notice the difference. I used American cheese (not my first choice, but it was all I had). I rounded out our dinner with some crunchy baked onion rings. The chipotle mayo was fantastic...and made a great dipping sauce for the onion rings. Great take on a classic patty melt!

Very good, but greasy....I might try grilling the burgers next time. I didn't add beer because I didn't have any, and also I skipped grilling the sandwiches in the grease, and instead buttered the outside of the bread and grilled it on a clean griddle. They were very flavorful, definitely worth making again.

Love the Chipotle/Mayo sauce and loved the pepper jack cheese.  I did not make these as patty melts just made them as regular burgers on toasted whole wheat rolls.  These are great, such a different spin on burgers !!

I'm a fan of traditional patty melts, but this is a great recipe if you are looking for something a little different.  I used white cheddar and the pepper jack together as my husband isn't a big fan of pepper jack.  Really enjoyed this recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the meat.  I left off the mayo sauce, but the family wants to try it next time.  I used mozzarella and am glad because it was spicy.   I need to work on my technique because I ripped the bread on at least one side of every melt.  All-in-all, different and tasty.

These were great! Very easy and a nice change from normal burgers. I did not add the beer simply because I did not have any but I did everything else the same. Thanks for a great recipe I will be making again!

Made as directed.  Hubby loved them, but paid for it the next day.  While we LOVE spicy foods, I would say I would leave out at least one of the chiles in adobo, and maybe the one in the mayo mixture.  All three, plus the pepperjack cheese made them almost painful to eat.  I use the chilies often, but always forget how potent they are afterwards.  Other than that, the burgers turned out perfect and it was a good meal!  Will try again, just modify the heat!

These tasted great!  I used ground turkey and green chili peppers since I could not find the chipolte peppers anywhere.  I doubled the meat to 2lbs, using a whole packet of chili seasoning and half of the little can of green chili peppers.  The meat looked a bit dry so I added about 2 tablespoons of ketchup too.  I made the sauce witht he other half of the can of peppers and the 1/4 cup reduced fat mayo.  I was short on time so I just put the bread in the toaster, spread the sauce on each piece once toasted and put the burger with pepperjack cheese aleady melted on it from the grill - topped with a ton of grilled onions....DELICIOUS!

The patties would not stay together and ended up being more like sloppy joes than patty melts. The beer over powered most of the other flavors. Over all I think this recipe is a complete bust. I gave it 2 stars since I followed the recipe to the T and they did not turn out like they said it would.

These are great.  I put them on grilled sourdough bread and they were outstanding.  Add in a mushrooms to the peppers and onions and it is a home run!

These were pretty good. We used 1.5 lbs of ground beef - kept the other measurements the same - and made 4 big burgers. Served on Texas toast with some sauteed onions and bacon cheese instead of the pepper jack. Not too spicy for us at all, and a really good "chili" flavor.

Made it as written, even had to hit hubby up for a bit of his tomato beer! I sandwiched the seasoned ground beef in between 2 cookie sheets lined with plastic and squeezed till thin enough then used a pizza cutter to get the square shape since I was using soft ciabatta rolls, toasted them up using 2 cast iron skillets and slathered on the chipotle sauce, Terrific flavor! Thank You Mrs. Martin. :):)

My husband and I both agree that these were some of the tastiest burgers/sandwiches we've had!  I kind of threw together my own chili seasoning so I don't think I used exactly the amount of chili seasoning called for but I used the perfect amount for us!  LOVED the spiciness and flavor.  I drained the fat into a coffee cup and poured a little back into the skillet each time I put sandwich in and the first time I flipped them.  They crisped up nicely!  The hubs opted for American cheese but I used the pepper jack. I think they'd be delicious with cheddar, too!!! Can't wait to have these again!!!

Not bad, but 1 lb is going to make more than 3 patties...I used 2 lbs and made 10!!

Amazing recipe! My husband and I loved these. I chopped onion with the chipotle peppers and put them in the hamburger mix. Other than that I followed the recipe. Will be a regular menu item I'm sure.

These were great! I made them twice, the second time without the beer because we didn't have any, and we couldn't taste the difference. They are a bit too spicy for my MN palette, but not by much. Next time I'll probably add 2 tbsp chili mix instead of 3. Great when yo umix up the cheese, too! We loved them! Just had baked beans as a side.

Oh, my goodness! This is the first recipe I've rated, and I would give it 10 stars if I could! It warmed the back of my throat just perfectly. I used sourdough bread. Wonderful!

I really liked these flavorful melts. It was a little hard keeping the patties from falling apart, but it still was very good. Definately a Tex-Mex dish that I will be making again!

Was very tasty and my family loved it. We have a high tolerance for spicy food, so no problem there. The spices gave it a chorizo taste. Will definitely make it again. One note, several people thought the chili powder gave it an odd taste. I just want to point out that the recipe called for chili mix, not chili powder!

I don't know what you made, but it wasn't a patty melt. 

A patty melt has just 4 ingredients - the beef patty, Rye bread, caramelized onions, and Swiss cheese.

On top of that, you had too many items for heat -something a lot of us would rather not wade through. Better luck next time.

I used jar of pre-mixed thousand island dressing. I used thin, fresh sourdough slices of bread. I mashed up avocado and added as a layer to the sandwich. When I took the patties off the grill, I put a cheese slice on them, instead of the bread. It made it taste so much better.

This was a hit with my husband, my daughter and me. The only thing I changed was the cooking method. I cooked the patties on my George Foreman grill, cleaned it off, then assembled the sandwiches with some butter on the outside and grilled them on the Foreman grill. I made extra chipotle mayo and mixed it with a package of Cole slaw. It made the perfect side to the sandwiches. Be generous with the chipotle mayo and cheese on the sandwiches. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful flavor but spicy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not use beer...in its place, I just used about a 1/4 cup of cold water, more or less.  The beer I would assume is to keep the meat juicy and moist. I always add a little water or finely crushed ice to my ground beef for juicyness.  The only change I would make next time is to only use 2 peppers total due to the heat level.  But overall, this was a delicious recipe, and I will definitely use it again.  Thanks!

This is one of the best recipes on here. I planned on only eating half, but couldn't stop! Not too spicy at all. The only thing I changed was how I cooked them. I grilled the patties and then fried them like grilled cheese. I'm going to make these once a month. Thanks for a fab recipe :)
