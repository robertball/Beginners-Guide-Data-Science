I've been using this same recipe for years and very happy to see it here.  This tenderizes chicken beautifully and gives a lot of flavor.  I hate bland chicken, but i also add a few teaspoons of minced garlic for an extra kick and aroma.  I also marinate overnight, which intesifies the flavor and serve with corn on the cob and ceasar salad.  People always ask for the marinade recipe!

This turned out pretty well.  One thing that confused me was the size of the dressing packets - the recipe says a 4.7 oz. package - that is a LOT of dressing mix.  The box I found was 4 packets at .7oz each.  I just used one of those and can't imagine using 4.7oz of dressing mix, it would be salty!  I'm guessing it's a typo unless someone else cares to weigh in.

This was outstanding and will most likely become my "go-to" recipe for grilled chicken breasts. Typically, I hate the reviews that say "I substitued this, this and this," but I had to make one switch because I didn't have any Italian Dressing packets on hand. I used a recipe I found here for "Italian Dressing Mix Submitted by Debby" that worked just as well.

My 10-year-old nephew come runnning out to the grill yelling "These are awesome! Start cooking more!"

made this yesterday - I was very disappointed.  I have always loved good season's dry dressing mix, but this had NO FLAVOR.  I was thinking those thoughts when hubby spoke up and said he wasn't impressed.  won't be wasting my oil and dressing mix on this recipe again.

I'm sure I would have liked this better had I not fixed Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs the same night.  But since I did, there's no comparison in the two marinades.

I used italian dressing from a bottle, since I didn't have the packets, lessened the oil, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  It was pretty good.  My 5 year old declared it the best chicken ever, which was nice!

tasted great and simple, since my husband is on a high protein diet, i marinated about 3 lbs of chicken tenders, broiled it in the oven and keep it in food saver container so he can grab and go for lunch/dinner.  I also picked out few other grilled chicken recipes on the websites and did the same.  Diet made easy:)

I taste tested this against 2 other more complicated marinades from this site last week.  This was made exactly according to directions.  The other marinades both tasted better in  marinade form, but once the chicken was grilled this one beat the others by far.  The chicken was moist and flavorful with a little tang from the lemon.  The flavors aren't so strong that they overwhelm, either.  We used the chicken for sandwiches and it was great with both pepper jack and provolone.  Very good multi-purpose marinade.  We will definitely make this again.

Marinated for 2 days and baked in the oven at 350 for 30. Was a bit too lemon-y for our tastes but the chicken breasts were very moist and tender. Prob won't make again.

I just made this recipe for the first time and I am crazy about the flavor.  I marinated mine for 24 hours.  Has almost a smoked flavor or something.  Yum Yum Yum!  LOVED IT!!!

This is so good & easy.  The taste is best if marinated overnight but I’ve marinated for as little as 2 hours and it’s still great.  I follow recipe exactly and don’t see any need to change it, great as is!

This was really good! I wish I could give it a 4.5. I marinated this chicken for a 1 day and added 2 garlic cloves and some onion powder. I dont have an indoor grill so I put this in the oven at 375 for 20 mins. Easy and tasty. Will make again.

This was great and not too lemony, which I was afraid of! It did have a bit of a mediterranean taste to it, but I did make my own "italian dressing" :  1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 2 tablespoons oregano, ground or oregano leaves 1 tablespoon dried parsley 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 2 tablespoons salt or salt substitute 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon ground basil or basil leaves 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme or thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon dried celery leaves or dried celery flakes  I used most of this- no sugar or celery, and it was delicious. Oh, I used about 1/4 cup of fresh chopped flat leaf parsley- maybe that made it for us! Really good- it's a staple in our house now!

This didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped. Maybe I should have marinated overnight. I only marinated about 4 hours. I might try again.

The best chicken marinade I've made in my whole life! I took other people's sugestions and added couple garlic cloves minced, we picked this recipe at the last minute for a picnic we were coming to so I only marinated it for 1 hr. and the chicken was very tender, mosist and juicy, people that tried it couldn't stop raving about how good it was.Now I have to send them the recipe.Thanks Angela for sumitting your recipe I'm definately going to added to my rotation.

I left out the oil. Made this for a cookout so I used 2 packets of dressing mix and 2 lemons worth of juice. I couldn't stop saying how great the chicken was! Juicey and tender. Definately a re-make!

Simple and delicious. I used fresh lemon juice and added about a tablespoon of fresh thyme and rosemary. I sliced it up and served it warm on top of cesar salad. My family of picky eaters loved it!

Delicious!  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I marinated it for about 24 hours.  The chicken was SO tender and moist.  The flavor is fantastic.  I made more than enough for dinner and was able to make a large portion of chicken salad with the leftovers.  It was awesome like that, too, with some nice sliced ripe tomatoes!

This was great! I let the chicken marinate for 2 days. We then put it on our George Foreman grill and it was fabulous! Very tender and juicy, and had a good flavor. It was funny though, neither my husband or I could tell if the main flavor we were tasting was lemon or the italian seasoning, but nevertheless, it was great. Will make again.

Great recipe! I let it marinade overnight, and then covered it with aluminum foil and baked it in the oven in the marinade. Very good flavour. Served with rice and steamed veggies :)

this was very delicious.. per usual i made a few modifications.. instead of 6 chicken breasts i used 3 thighs and 3 drumsticks.. like h0t5auce, i used Italian Dressing Mix by Debbie on this site (with my mods).. i halved the oil and upped the lemon juice to 1/2 cup.. we marinated for about a day and a half and added some cherry wood to the smoker box while grilling.. ty for the recipe

This was super easy to put together and yummy to eat.  The lemon wasn't overpowering, though I wish the flavor from this mix would have stood out a bit more. I'll definitely use this again!

I've been looking for a good marinade and I think we found it!  I only marinaded it for 3 hours because of time and it was great.  I can't imagine how yummy it will be overnight!

Very moist and yummy chicken..I decreased the oil to 1/4 and I had only a half of a fresh lemon to use, so I also added the juice of a lime. Marinated overnight and grilled tonight....excellent!

This marinade was a big hit with both my husband and myself. Will definitely use this again and again. We just cooked the chicken in a skillet with some of the marinade - made a fabulous sauce! I only had one lemon, so didn't even  measure the juice - but it was enough to give that fresh hint of lemon. Can't wait to try again for the grill. Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend's daughter wouldn't eat chicken anymore so I tried this marinade because she loves lemon and I added a little more lemon, she took the smallest piece and wished she hadn't, stole half her Dad's piece, we all loved it and it is SO EASY.  Thank you Angie.

Added garlic like another had said. Everyone loved it, even my son who puts ketchup on every chicken said it was good without. Yay!! This will be a staple marinade in my home.

Chicken tasted great - really liked this marinade. Made exactly as stated (except maybe the lemon, I squeezed one whole lemon and I'm not exactly sure how much it was) Only had 3 hours to marinade and it still was very flavorful. Would definitely make again :)

Doubled the recipe for my large family. Because I had so much chicken (10 lrg breasts), I made 3x the marinade and let them marinate overnight.  I also baked them with the marinade.  The seasonings were good, but the lemon overpowered everything else.  Could it be because of the extra marinade? My entire family ate it and said it was okay. Guess we're just not huge lemon lovers.

I marinated this for two days and cooked it on my george foreman grill, as the weather did not permit outdoor grilling.  It had good flavor and was tasty on top of a salad.  I also set aside some of the marinade for use as salad dressing.

Great marinade!  I just made this for a family gathering and marinaded the chicken for just over 24 hours and grilled them. I have a picky family and try not to make anything too spicy to please everyone.  Well, this marinade did the trick - they turned out delicious!  So moist & tender & great flavor- got rave reviews!  Will definitely use this marinade again.

I gave 2 stars for ease . We found this very bland ,almost tasteless even after adding minced garlic and marinating for 5 hours. It just seems to be missing something. Sorry.

Delicious! Didn't want to use all of my good olive oil, so I substituted with canola oil. Also added a couple hefty splashes of Liquid Smoke, about 1/2 cup of water, and quite a few turns of fresh cracked pepper. Grilled over medium - SO GOOD!

This is great and similar to my usual of Zesty Italian salad dressing + the lemon juice.  I did add the oil this time in addition to the salad dressing & lemon juice & it was still great!

Not bad but I prefer a different grilled chicken recipe using a package of dried ranch dressing. Added a little bit more seasoning. Pounded the breasts in a Ziploc bag and then added everything -- easy cleanup. Served with some grilled sliced lemons for visual punch.

my family loved the chicken. It was greatwith zucchini and squash (i just used the virgin oil to sauté them on the stove with season salt and pepper)
