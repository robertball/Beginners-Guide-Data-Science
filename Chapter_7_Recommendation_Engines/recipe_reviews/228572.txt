Wow - this is really good! The fresh mint kicks it over the top. Changes I made: vegetable broth instead of beef broth to make the recipe vegetarian, increased lentils, used a whole can of chickpeas,  used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato.
I was surprised by the large qty -- would be a generous side dish for maybe 10 people.
Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

Okay, I made it as directed and it's not bad!!! But I suspected the proportions mights have been off. My suggestion would be to increase the lentils 1/2 cup and the chickpeas 1/2 cup and you should be on point. The bulgur just seems to be rather top-heavy. In any case, healthy & filling!!! Love me some Middle-Eastern Cuisine ;-)

Nice recipe, I added in some ground beef and switched a cup of rice for the two cups of bulgur.

Good recipe!  Like the other review said, I decided to increase the amount of lentils and chick peas.  That seems to be a good decision.  Otherwise a good, healthy dish.  

I keep thinking it needs just a little bit more of something.  Either more tomatoes, a little curry powder / garlic, something like that.
