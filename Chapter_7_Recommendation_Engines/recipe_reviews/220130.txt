I will usually never try a recipe unless there are pages of reviews but I was in the mood for this dish so I decided to go for it. I was NOT disappointed! The only thing I will change next time is to spice it up
A bit. Maybe season the chicken with some adobo before browning and add a bit more salt and pepper to the sauce. It wasn't bland but It was "mild". If you are like me and need tons of flavor then add some extra spices otherwise the dish is delicious as is.

Fantastic! My only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs (skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time), substitute a dry red wine for the water, and use 1 ¼ cup of Barilla Marinara for the tomato sauce. NOTE: after browning all the thighs, it’s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding. I serve over buttered wide egg noodles.

We loved this! Made it mostly as written. I used 6 boneless, skinless thighs I had on hand & followed a couple of the suggestions I saw here. I used Sangiovese wine to deglaze the pan (plus some more for flavor) & a 28 oz. can of 'crushed tomatoes with basil' in place of sauce. The grocery store was out of green peppers, so I used all red ones (sweeter anyway). It came out awesome!
I served it over yellow, saffron rice. DON'T TRY IT! Although I love both, they don't "play well together". TOO MUCH! I'll save my yummy, yellow rice for less flavorful dishes & serve my Cacciatore over pasta or white/brown rice.

Take 2: Tried this again, browning 2 S/B breasts, seasoned with S&P + Italian seasoning & 3 large cloves SLICED garlic (sweeter), in my smaller dutch oven. Removed breasts & deglazed pan with Cabernet Sovignon. Added: NO WATER; 2, 4 oz cans of mushrooms, drained (was out of fresh); 1, 8 oz can of tomato sauce; 3 T. chicken broth; more Cabernet; LOTS of white onion & NO WATER. Put breasts back in dutch oven with LOTS of thin-sliced red, yellow & orange mini-peppers on top. Cooked as instructed . Added halved grape tomatoes for the last 30 min. Served it over linguine with 'at-the-table' fresh-grated Parmesan. AWESOME!
This goes on my 'Go-To' list!
Thanks, Chef John!!!

Pretty much followed the recipe as is. The only difference was that I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning before browning and doubled the tomato sauce. Other than that, this came out so yummy and it was so quick and easy to do! Definitely a keeper! Thanks Chef John! : )

I had been craving chicken cacciatore and had never made it myself.  All my memories of this dish were from when my mom used to make it when I was a kid.  So I found this recipe and decided to give it a try...it was delicious!  And better than my memories!  I made two changes...
1. I deglazed the pan using 1/2 cup white wine after I cooked the onions, mushrooms, garlic and spices.(instead of the water)  
2.  Then I added one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (instead of the tomato sauce)  
The end result was tender, juicy, chicken that falls off the bone, in a rich and flavorful sauce that goes perfect over pasta.  My family loved it!

Very good!  Used my homemade sauce.  I always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so I'm always ready when I get the urge to cook.  I too spiced it up a little more.  Had 2 zucchini that were just about ready for zucchini heaven so I threw them in too slced of course.  I have a new electric pressure cooker so next time I'll make this in my
P.C. and let you all know how it turns out.

I made this as written except I used chicken thighs. In the video, I thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning. I wish I would have stuck with my mind and drained it. The meal was so greasy I couldn't taste anything else. If you make this with thighs, PLEASE drain it before putting everything else in. It was a waste of food in my house.

Very pleased with this recipe.  I had thighs and drumsticks, skipped the oregano and used seasoned salt.  I also added  zucchini as another reviewer suggested.  I used chicken broth instead of water.I cooked in my cassoulet and it came out great.  We had with some fluffily rice.  I have made this three times now.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fabulous!  Even a beginner can master this recipe.  I too used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the can of tomato sauce.  My husband was out mowing when I started this dish the first time.  When he walked in, he was overwhelmed by the delicious smell. I made this with chicken breasts and we had 2 leftover for the next day.  He couldn't wait and had one for a midnight snack. Chef John should be commended for this recipe. Just wonderful!!

Chef John-all the recipes that have your name attached to them have been wonderful! This is a keeper-I made it exactly and it had such wonderful flavor-the red pepper flakes gave it a nice little kick-not too spicy...just nice. Worth making for sure!

Really good recipe.  The only thing I changed was the amount of tomato sauce- i used 2 cans (14.5 oz each) instead of 1 cup.  Also, I subsituted red wine for the water and simmered it on the stove top for about 3 hours.  Would make this again.

Mmmmm good I made a few changes based on what others wrote. I used chicken broth instead of water. I also used one small can of tomato sauce and one can of crushed tomatoes. I added one tsp of dried basil, two bay leaves, and used one tsp of dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh on hand. I cut the bell peppers back to one each and added black olives. Served over brown rice and topped with parmesan cheese.

This was blander than I expected. I don't have a high tolerance for capsaicin, so I typically halve or quarter the amount of hot spices called for. In this I used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and couldn't taste it at all. Next time I'll use 1/2 tsp and more salt.  
I really don't understand why the recipe says to put the peppers on top of the chicken. You lose all the beautiful crispness that the chicken just got with the browning. The veggies released so much liquid, it completely covered the chicken. I would put the peppers under the chicken next time, which is what my instinct told me, but I ignored it.

This was quite tasty.  I would recommend cutting up the chicken into smaller pieces than fourths, though.  That would make it easier to brown, and you wouldn't have to cut up the pieces before serving.  I made the recipe with only 3 bell peppers, and that was enough for us.  I also doubled the red pepper flakes, and that gave the recipe a nice little kick.  I made no other changes to the recipe, and served it over noodles.  I deboned the leftie chicken, cut into bite-size pieces, and added back to the veggies and liquid.  This will make a delicious hearty soup for lunch.

Had a hankerin' for some cacciatore tonight. I quartered a large chicken; splashed in a little white cooking wine early in the process and substituted chicken broth for water. This has that classic cacciatore flavor I was craving; delicious over angel hair with parm cheese.

We enjoyed this very much. The poker guys devoured it. I used boneless chicken breasts which I shredded after cooking and returned to the pan after cooking the veggies for 5 mins. I only used red peppers forgoing the green. Great recipe that is all done on the stove top. Served over Angel Hair Pasta with garlic bread. Terrific!

This dish is exceptional!  I have made this more than a dozen times and always in my slow cooker.  I always add 1  cup of spaghetti sauce and 1 - 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes just to have extra sauce.  I use thighs with skin and bone  in for the best flavour and serve with spaghetti. Red pepper flakes are omitted but otherwise recipe made as written. Meat practically falls off the bone cooking on high setting for 4 hours. Such a glamorous meal with such little effort.

This was really good.  I used McCormick's Montreal chicken spice when browning boneless skinless thighs,cracked pepper, frozen onion and peppers, mushrooms, one 8 ounce can of tomato sauce, no extra water, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar and a bit of parmesan. Didn't need to cook more than 45 minutes. Served with bow tie pasta.  We loved it!

Excellent, everyone loved this recipe. Flavor was soo good, I did use thighs and drumsticks since I needed to use them up and added a little extra tomato sauce and water to make a little more sauce.

This is a great, easy recipe and I can't believe how good it is for how relatively healthy and low fat it is!  I made minor changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Half way through the cooking process I noticed the sauce had almost dried up, so I added the remaining cans of chicken broth and tomato sauce (each had about 1/2 a can left) with some flour for thickening.  Served over angel hair pasta as suggested by others with some parmesan cheese. Soo good, will make again!  Thanks Chef John.

I do this recipe over and over. I server it over Arborio rice. I don't use a whole chicken. I just buy a package of chicken thighs that I remove much of the skin from to reduce the amount of fat. I substitute Italian seasoning for rosemary and tomato paste for tomato sauce because it gives a lot more flavor. It turns out great every time and it really good the next day for lunch leftovers.

One of my favorite recipes ever!  Very healthy with low fat and lots of veggies.  But it tastes awesome!  I am not a huge fan of tomato sauces, but this recipe is so good!  It takes a while, but totally worth it.  And the red pepper adds a perfect amount of heat, not overly spicy or bland.  And it's nice to slice instead of chop the veggies, great time saver.

Absolutely amazing!  I seasoned the chicken with Northwoods Seasoning before browning, and I reduced the peppers to 1 red and 1 green. My husband doesn't eat peppers, and is picky with onion, but he ate this up, and asked me to make it a regular dish!

Very tasty! The only thing I did different was I added yellow and green zucchini and a tad more red pepper flakes. I did drain some of the chicken grease.

We had chicken cacciatore for our wedding reception. So for our anniversary I decided to try and make it myself. So glad I did. It was very easy to do and as delightful as it was at our wedding reception. Thank you chef John for always making great informational videos that are entertaining to watch. A five star recipe for sure!

Used skinless thighs and breasts for this. I was stellar! Lovely robust flavors. I used a delicious red wine and some fresh squeezed orange juice that added a lovely depth and sweetness that played of the rosemary and Italian seasonings beautifully.

A few small changes: Since I'm cooking for two I used four bone-in thighs with skin rather than a whole chicken, and I reduced the quantities of other ingredients appropriately. Also since we have fresh thyme in our garden I added a couple of sprigs and since I had some chicken stock on hand I used that rather than water. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of homemade tomato sauce (forgive me!). And I don't think it mattered, but it was too hot in our house to cook in the oven, so I put the dutch oven in the gas barbeque outside and tried to keep it at about 350F. 
According to my customer (my wife) it was excellent. I'll definitely do it again.

To spice it up I used a jar of ragu marinara and a jar of ragu w/mushroom with 15 pcs of chicken. I did use the salt and pepper and only tbls of Italian seasoning. Onions and peppers I still followed. Covered in Dutch oven at 350deg for 1 1/2 hrs. Froze 3 meals for 2 of us. simple and taste great.

As this is an American recipe I wasnt sure if tomato sauce meant ketchup. (It does to us Brits).    I took it to mean tomato/pure/water.   It wasnt that good.  I think its supposed to be like a marinara sauce?????    It was a bit bland to be honest but I will try again, this time using marinara sauce.

So easy.  I used legs and thighs. Drained all but two tablespoons of the fat before adding the onions & mushrooms. Increases garlic to the entire head.  Served over rigatoni so I used 14.5 ounce can of tomato sauce to which I added 1 tablespoon of sugar, Italian seasoning, & oregano to taste as well as some Asian 5 spice seasoning. Also added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. Baked in a large non stick fry pan covered for 1 hour. Make some garlic bread with parmigian cheese for lapping up the sauce and get ready fo receive the accolades your guests will send you way.

This was pretty good, but  it's way too easy to end up with soggy skin when making this dish.  It makes me gag.  Next time the skin comes off before browning.

Otherwise, the tomato base is seriously good!

I agree with the person who said it needed some spice. The red pepper flakes gave something to the sauce, but the chicken was a little bland. Next time, I think I'll marinade the chicken overnight in olive oil and Italian seasonings.

I changed a few things. I used my favorite *spaghetti sauce for tomato sauce, *1 1/4 cups pinot gricio wine instead of water, 2 15oz cans *Stewed Tomatoes, 2T *Trader Joes 21 Seasonings, 2 Low Sodium *Knorr's Chicken flavoring Pods (turns it from VG to Great)  and slightly thickens it. I used all other ingredients listed in recipe.

This recipe is a keeper! I used 4 chicken thighs! I browned them in my Dutch oven on the stove and pretty much followed the recipe from there with the following exceptions: I deglazed the pan with a little white wine (Chardonnay), added a couple of spoons of capers, a can of hunts sauce, and chicken stock instead of water. Then I transferred the chicken to a casserole dish on top of the onions, garlic and mushrooms and poured the sauce on top and added the peppers. After baking for an hour and 15 min in the convection oven, this was served over pasta. YUM!

One of our favorite dinners. Try browning a couple of Italian sausages cut in 1" pieces  with the chicken - adds so much flavor. I also add red wine instead of water, and cook it down a bit.

This is really good, but here are the changes I made: used just thighs (that's what I had available) added black and green olives, add 1 C. wine instead of the water, skip the rosemary, added double the garlic and 2 onions, added double the red pepper flakes and chopped fresh tomatoes (drained juice) rather than the tomato sauce. I have never started it on the stove and finished in the oven but I love this idea-sounds like less tending! Thanks!!

I did not follow this to a "T" but instead used it as a general guideline.  I grew up having cacciatore every other month or so (at least twice a month in winter) over spaghetti.  Instead of a whole chicken i had about 4 lbs of chicken legs.  I substituted a jar of Classico Pizza sauce (about 2 cups), added a large can of diced tomato, a medium can of tomato paste - my tomatoes are dying and i love tomato - and waved a beer in its general direction.  Also used fresh oregano - about equal to the rosemary -, 8 cloves of garlic and a extra generous splash of red pepper flakes.  At the end I threw in a bit of Parmesan and stirred everything together.  I would add a photo but I am ashamed at the state of my dutch oven. It is empty.

Great recipe.  So very easy to make.  I used fresh peppers from the garden and since I didn't have tomato sauce on hand, I used a small can of Rotell tomatoes and a teaspoon of raw sugar.  Your family will love this.

Really good and easy recipe. I made a couple of small changes by adding some chopped tomato, used chicken breasts that I seasoned, and broth instead of water. My only complaint is that the gravy is very watery. I may try to thicken it up some next time. I'll be making this again. It was perfect over angel hair.

Wow!  Chef John nailed it, and I did too!  This is a foolproof recipe for an absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS single pot meal.  There weren't many leftovers, but the bit that was left was doled out to the three of us evenly, everyone made sure their share was not lacking~!

I like this recipe. It is a well balanced, flavorful and filling meal.  The last time I made it I realized that I was out of tomato sauce so I used tomato soup. It turned out really well and now I always use tomato soup instead of tomato sauce.

OMG, SO GOOD!!! Probably the best tasting food I've ever cooked. No msg, no wine, needs nothing. I am trying to lose some weight so removed the skin, and I can't stand olive oil, so swapped out for avacado oil. Green peppers for yellow, because I don't like green peppers. Otherwise, I followed all the steps. But there's no need to mess with this recipe. If you think it'll be too wet, just leave the lid off.

Simple yet delicious, this was a great meal to round out the week by clearing the fridge/pantry of any older veggies. In addition to the ingredients called for, we also added tomatoes and squash. To compensate for the extra ingredients, we added extra seasoning once the vegetable medley was ready for the oven. Once out of the oven, the meal was so fragrant, we could barely wait to eat. I can't wait to use this recipe again.

My fiance and I loved making this recipe together. It was delicious, bright and restaurant quality. The whole house smelled yummy too, after cooking this dish! I substituted  chicken stock for the water and made rice and and crusty Italian bread to go with the dish.

I made this exactly per the recipe and it was delicious! With a large chicken this makes a lot of food. Maybe next time I’ll try it with maybe 3 chicken breasts as there’s just the 2 of us.

The chicken was tender and delicious. The sauce was a little watery. I would leave out the extra water from the recipe and add more tomato paste.

This recipe was so simple, you just need time. 
I used chicken leg quarters, and I used our cast iron skillet covered with foil instead of a dutch oven. 
I also substituted red wine for the water. It made a big impact! So good!

This was an easy dish to recreate in my kitchen. I did make an adjustment or two. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs (8 of them)seasoned them with Mrs. Dash original and a light dusting of garlic powder, then put them in the frying pan (coated with EVOO) and let them brown on both sides. I removed them to a plate and added the onions, mushrooms, garlic, hot pepper flakes (only about 10), oregano and a pinch of salt (I omitted the rosemary, as I did not have any). I let this cook about 8 minutes and added the tomato sauce (with 2  chopped up plum tomatoes in it) and a full cup of low sodium chicken broth. I added back the chicken cutlets and laid the pepper strips on top of them. Since it is summertime and very warm, I opted cover the fryer and simmer the recipe on top of the stove, checking on it every 20 minutes to make sure nothing was sticking to the bottom of the pan. It came out yummy . I lowered the total fat content as there was no chicken skin, and yet it was tender and juicy because I used thighs and not breasts.

Very easy and quick. If you have to use dry rosemary instead of a sprig I wouldn’t use more than one and a half teaspoons. I thought 1 tsp per sprig but that was too much.

This was a very easy dish to make. It had lots of flavor from the peppers.
I did use bottled pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce , which worked just fine!

This was such a hit! Next time I don’t think I’ll brown the breasts as long or not at all. The sauce was amazing but the breasts were dry. The dark meat was perfect. I used suggestions of deglazing with red wine and adding wine instead of water. I also rubbed the chicken with Adobo before browning. I used a lot of garlic when I sautéed the onions and mushrooms.

It probably isn't really "this" recipe anymore since I'm a big "tweaker" when I cook.  But the base plus my extras made this our favorite version to date.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and used white wine in place of the water.  And I was heavy handed on the seasonings because we like a lot of flavor.  The end result was very good and we'll definitely have it again.

I used boneless, skinless thighs in lieu of a whole chicken. Cut then into wide strips, eliminated the flour, sautéed them and followed the recipe as written from that point except I cut the cook time down to 30-35 minutes. Everybody loved this recipe. I will definitely be making this again. It was delicious!!!

I love this recipe!  So easy, and it is full of flavor!  I made it in my cast iron Dutch oven, and everything cooked beautifully.  

Thanks, Chef John!  Your recipes always turn out perfectly.  I appreciate your videos, too.  If you watch  them, there aren’t any surprises or questions.

Wow....this was really good!!! I used one large orange and one large red pepper. I also used a whole jar of prepared sauce and boneless chicken breasts. The poultry was so moist and the peppers made it taste fresh and yummy. I served it over noodles. This is a definite keeper and a great way to use peppers when they go on sale. Thank you Chef John for another stellar recipe.

I added too many pepper flakes.  It was too spicy.  So I added more pasta.  Then my husband felt it was too bland.  I will make again and follow the directions exactly!

We just made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it!  I used boneless chicken breasts for time saving and serving flexibility. We sautéed veggies and chicken in electric skillet then put everything in a cast iron Dutch oven with a can of basil seasoned crushed tomatoes and simmered on the stovetop rather than in the oven. We served with curly pasta-cavatappi-salad and crusty bread - It was delicious!

This is an awesome, easy recipe.  I highly recommend it.  Although I have to be honest for some reason I didn't read the directions and I just put everything in my Dutch oven and put it in the oven.  It turned out great! - thank you Chef John

This was a very good recipe, easy to make.  I wanted to follow the recipe as closely as possible, which I did with a few changes.  I used boneless skinless breasts, and added a can of tomatoes and some baby carrots.  I did not use the red bell peppers or pepper flakes, and used ground marjoram in place of the rosemary.  Also, I was using the oven for something else and so cooked this on top of the stove.  Husband and daughter both liked it very much.  There was plenty of juices which were great for dipping bites of chicken into or spooning over vegetables.  Will make this again.

Loved it! Restaurant quality! I had a large Publix Greenwise roasting chicken cut into 10 pieces. Followed the recipe EXCEPT no red pepper flakes 'cause I didn't have them. It was easy prep, into oven, easy clean-up, worth $30 in any restaurant. My 97 year-old mama liked it, my wife (who doesn't like anything) liked it, and even her cat, Trixie, liked it.  Chef John is the best!

Made it with chicken breasts they were so tender. I thought the sauce was a little thin next time I make it I will add some cornstarch during the last  15 minutes of cooking to thicken the sauce.

I think this recipe is delicious!  I agree with a previous poster that it would have been good to be advised to drain most of the fat/oil after browning the chicken.  It was a little greasy. Next time I will drain the fat.  For those saying the sauce is too thin, use your imagination!  I served with rice, but also a great crusty bread to mop up the sauce.  It was wonderful!!

Made this tonight. I followed the recipe almost, I didn't have tomato sauce so I used jarred marinara sauce and I used canned mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh ones. It was absolutely delicious, not bland or under seasoned! My husband loved it, this recipe is a keeper! He's a chef and loves when I make a good dinner. Nice for him not to cook! Thanks Chef John your recipes are always good!

It's a great recipe. I never have wine so I left that out and used chicken bouillon. I added a few veggies u had in the fridge and u think it made it spectacular! My only advise is to thicken the stew like mixture. Easy on the orange juice but put it in cuz it is really good!

I will definitely make it again. Since we don't like breasts will use thighs. Used a good quality store bought sauce and didn't have mushrooms but will use them next time.  They definitely will enhance the recipe. Followed the rest of the recipe. Delicious!!

Doubled the tomato sauce and spices, used chicken stock instead of water, and skinned the chicken to cut down on grease.  After baking, removed chicken and cooked it down on stovetop/added some tomato paste to thicken.  Served on egg noodles with steamed peas/carrots and garlic bread on side.  

If I make it again, will probably rub some Italian herbs on the chicken before browning.  It's not "bland", but it needs a little something more.

I like it but didn't love it. For the first time around, I made the recipe exactly as is. Next time, here's what I'd do different, I'd double the mushrooms (they really shrink down) and I'd saute half the amount of peppers with them instead of placing them on top of the chicken raw. Then I'd put half the veggies under the chicken and half on top. Also, I'd take all the skin off the chicken. My family liked it, I just think it can be improved on. :)

I've made it twice, now. The first time I forgot the mushrooms and the second time I made it almost as written (I used boneless/skinless thighs). This is a fabulous recipe, full of flavor. One thing I would underscore though is, be sure to use FRESH rosemary. It adds so much flavor, I don't think it would be nearly the same dish without it. Keep 'em coming Chef John! Thanks!

Made a few changes and loved how it turned out. I cooked the sliced peppers in with the onions and mushrooms, added an extra cup of tomato sauce, and added chopped canned plum tomatoes to the Dutch oven before placing in the oven. Came out fantastic - lots of tasty sauce to spoon over the chicken and rice!

I thought this was very good and very easy to make.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts to lighten things up and substituted white wine for the water and fire roasted tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  My sauce ended up a little runny for my liking, so I added a tablespoon of tomato paste at the end to thicken it up.  I served it over pasta and sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over all. Very good!

We really liked this. I made with 8 bone in skin on chicken thighs. I had to skim off a lot of oil/fat off the top before serving. I served with farfalle pasta.

I used chicken thighs and they came out just the way I like them. There was a little too much liquid for my taste, though. Next time I will try marinara sauce in place of the tomato sauce (adjusting the added herbs) and not add any water.

If I could give this recipe more then 5 stars I would. Chef John once again has given us a wonderful recipe. I've made quite a few dinners of Chicken Cacciatore in my lifetime  and have tried several recipes. While I have my favorite recipe for this dish, I am so glad I tried this one as well because now this is my favorite recipe for Chicken Cacciatore...it was s superb! I did add red wine instead of water, used 24 ounces of pasta sauce instead of a cup of tomato sauce and 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes instead of 1/2. Other then that, I followed the directions as written even using green, red and pasilla pepper. Wonderful!

I have made this dish for at least 30 yrs. Always on top of the stove in the dutch oven. I will try the oven method tonight. I also make my own tomato sauce. The recipe I had called for 1/4 tsp of allspice along with the other spices. I have been adding that to my sauce all these years. Like another review I have added the wine too.

Great dish,  as recommended by others I didn't use wine instead of water and marinara sauce for the tomato sauce ., 2cups .  For the chicken , I used  chicken thighs and chicken breast .  seasoned the chicken with adobe seasoning   before cooking.   Definitely a keeper .

Cannot find where to put notes on a recipe, so I started rating them for my own use later:
used barilla pasta sauce, only 2 chicken breasts cut into 1" pieces, added olives at the very end.  Maybe more liquid - 1/2 cup water or cook less time?

I made this for dinner last night and like a few reviewers stated, the grease from the chicken needed to be drained after browning the chicken. Other than that the only changes I made was I cooked it in a cast iron skillet since I don't have a Dutch Oven. It was delicious! This was the second time I have made Chicken Cacciatore,  the first time I used another recipe and it was just OK. This time it was so much better. Definitely will stick with this recipe from now on.

The only change I made were I used just chicken legs and thighs, 16 oz. of tomato sauce, and red wine instead of water.  It was delicious and guite easy to make.

An excellent dish - would definitely make again.  I used all thighs and drumsticks - about 11 pieces in total, and next time I will make more as they did shrink during cooking.  It was so good that there was not a single piece of chicken left.  The only changes I made was adding two more garlic cloves, doubling the red chilli flakes and using one and a half cans of tomato sauce with NO water to ensure a thick and delicious sauce.

Great and easy to pull together as long as you have a Dutch oven. Instead of the half cup of water I added half cup of red wine and it made a huge difference. Much richer and more depth of flavor, would highly recommend that alternative.

The chicken had flabby skin, and was bland even after the addition of lots of salt. Hot pepper kind of took over the flavor. The sauce was greasy even after I cooled the dish, and skimmed off all of the solidified fat.

Added 1 oz of black olive pearls sliced and combined the liquid from the can to complete the 1/2 cup of water. Loved the taste and ease of preparation. It gives a nice kick to over greasy tomato taste of the tradition cacciatore recipes.

My mom used to make a to-die-for, iron skillet chicken cacciatore. Alas, I had no iron skillet, nor a Dutch oven so I improvised with the 12" skillet you see here. My Vietnamese partner who mostly likes Asian cuisine was quite satisfied and I was too. Give it a try! It's a really healthy, uncomplicated dish this way.

This came out excellent!!  If you like your Italian a little spicy I'd at least double the red chili flakes, otherwise, outstanding recipe!!

I added some white wine to deglaze the fond just before I added the tomato sauce and I also added just a touch of balsamic vinegar while it was simmering. My chef said it was awesome! Thanks Chef John!!!

Delicious even though I threw out the juices from the chicken instead of saving them and using them in the gravy. The gravy was still tasty. Will do this again!

I have made this many times since finding the recipe and it's now a family favorite. One of the only dishes my kids are excited to eat. I omit the mushrooms and double the tomato sauce to serve it over rice. Delicious!

Great recipe! A bit labor intensive but totally worth the effort. Used legs with backs attached and an entire 14 oz can of tomato sauce. Served with spaghetti it made a really great dinner.

Easy and straight-forward. Only thing I did different is added chopped tomatoes with the strained sauce. Had more liquid which made a delicious rice or pasta sauce.  Family loved it.  Yumm! 

Made it again!  Used a package of white pearl onions in place of sliced onions. Very nice!

This was one of the best recipes I have prepared.  This Chef know his biz.  I did change a couple of small things.  I used Rao's basil and tomato sauce; added a bit more red pepper flakes and chicken broth in lieu of water.  I used Spanish rice on the side of the plate.  My wife just loved this; the house smelled wonderful and I am a "believer".  Chef John - thank you!

Absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were that I used all dark meat, because that's our prefernce, and I doubled the amount of tomato sauce. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My whole family loved it and I already gave the recipe to a coworker who gave it rave reviews too.

Followed the recipe as is. Served over fettuccine. The red pepper flakes gave it just the right amount of kick. Will definitely do this again.

This was great! Made a few changes-I didn't have any mushrroms so I added a chopped carrot and some celery.  I also added a little red wine with the water.  Used 6 large bone-in breasts. Will prepare this again!

So easy and so delicious.  I didn't have a whole chicken so used boneless/skinless chicken breasts.

This was quick to make and everyone loved it.  I will make this again for sure!
