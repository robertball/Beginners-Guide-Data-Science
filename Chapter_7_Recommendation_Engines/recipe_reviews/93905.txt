It's 26c today in the middle of farmland France, this was a nice refreshing drink for our lunch. We just picked up some fresh milk and cream, a perfect pairing! Thank you.

Delicious! The only change I made was using Silk Coconut Milk instead of regular milk. I scaled he recipe down to 1 serving and I'm sorry I did. It was a very small serving but very good.
