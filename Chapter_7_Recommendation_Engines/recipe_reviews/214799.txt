This was great for lunch.  Lots of flavor.  Next time I won't mash the avocado as I would prefer to have more of a solid consistancy.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The color from the paprika made the salad brown and overpowered all the flavors.  I added a lot of salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make it palatable. I then had to add another avocado to bring up the color. - kubbymom

A nice change from plain egg salad. Next time I will cut back just a little on the lime juice and bump up the paprika.
