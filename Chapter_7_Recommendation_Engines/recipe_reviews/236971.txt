YUM!!!!! Everyone loves them. I used milk chocolate for the first batch and white chocolate for the second batch. I also left out the nuts on the second and added more oats and coconut. Thanks for sharing this easy yummy recipe.

These are so delicious! I really wanted a cookie that was something completely different (no boring chocolate chip cookies here!) and this hit the spot. I skipped adding the sugar because I really didn't see the point in it - and I don't regret it. It does not need the sugar. I also substituted almond milk instead of regular which I thought worked out great. Next time I'll try adding in some peanut butter!

When I was little my Aunt use to make these every holiday and I just love them - and they are so easy to make.
