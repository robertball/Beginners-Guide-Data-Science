I became a member just so that I could rate this recipe--it's excellent!  I didn't add the full amount of pepper (personal preference) and left some of the skin on the hazelnuts (to save time) and my guests gobbled it up!  Very unique flavor, but not too bizarre for picky eaters.  Whole coriander and cumin seed are easy to find and cheap at Indian markets.  Will definitely make again!!!

A favorite with my family :-)

Add a heaped teaspoon of Turmeric - makes it a great authentic color and adds a little something to the taste.
Also, try Avocado oil to dip in to - a lovely alternative to EV Olive oil and is also a mono-unsaturated oil with no trans-fats (yes, really none!)  I know it is expensive but it is  worth it and you only have a small amount at a time.

GREAT RECIPE. My oldest son is addicted to dukkah. (He loves it sprinkled on buttered fresh bread.) The only change I had to make was to  replace the hazelnuts with toasted blanched almonds because I can't get hold of hazelnuts in any of my local supermarkets.

Very delicious! Add as topping on a salad with fresh, green lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, olive oil and lemon, and serve with turkish bread, for a sumptuous, vegetarian meal.

This is a great recipe - everyone LOVED it.  I had to make a few changes because I couldn't find cumin or coriander seeds - so I used coriander flakes and cumin powder.  I also used 1/2 almonds, 1/2 hazelnuts.  I don't know what the original recipe was meant to taste like but it was wonderful with my changes.  
Also, we like to dip the bread in balsamic vinegar and olive oil - its a great combination.

This is a fabulous dip! My guests and I absolutely loved it and couldn't get enough of it! I bought the ground hazelnuts from the bulk food store and toasted them in a dry skillet; it worked out great and saved a bit of time.

I cut down on the pepper a litle when I make this.  Hubby says it's weird, but I love it!  The traditional way (bread & olive oil) is my favorite, but it's also a great coating for meat & fish, and good on salads.

This is a fabulous spice mixture!  The warm spicy flavor of the cumin and coriander is wondrefully complimented by the cool heat of the black pepper. I simplified preparation by purchasing a bottle of toasted sesame seeds.

Followed the recipe, but doubled the salt as I like my food salty.  Very unusual taste at first, but then found we couldnt stop eating it.   Makes a nice change to serve something exotic. Next time will double the recipe so we never run out.

Very good and very different.  So true that the more you eat the more addicted you become.  The first few bites we were thinking it tasted a little strange but after a few minutes we were gobbling it up.  Can picture having this on a warm summer's evening around a campfire.  Also like that the same mix can be used as a rub for meat or on a salad.  Could have the dip for appetizer and then use the same spice mix in the meal to carry the theme through the evening.

This stuff is amazing! I had to bring something to a dinner party honoring some young professional guests from Egypt, and this is the recipe I chose. It was confirmed "authentic" by the guests. (One gal said it was considered very healthy.) I made a double batch and brought home the portion that was left -- it stayed fresh for a couple months in a plastic airtight container. Hubby and I like it so much we had to make a new batch after it ran out! TRY THIS: Cut some fresh salmon into strips about 1" thick. Coat the salmon with dukkah and sauté in butter. YUM!!!

Did not find this addictive at all, nobody did, and we love different, interesting food. It was the only thing that didnt get eaten up at a party full of tipsy hungry people. Sorry.

Tasty dry dip. I first came across Dukkah at a farmers market - then on a work project (used to work for a food consultant). I added a touch more salt (was using kosher salt) and stored the batch in the fridge. Tastes best after being stored for a day when the flavours have been allowed to mingle a bit.

Really nice!  Different and yummy.  Definitely addictive.  At first I forgot the salt and pepper and was definitely underwhelmed.  Once I added the salt and pepper it really popped.

The only addition I made to this were fennel seeds, love the hint of licorice the fennel gives. Excellent served with the naan bread recipe on this site! My boyfriend is addicted to this now!

I made this for a meeting of 30 friends.  It wasn't everyone's thing, but those who love this sort of thing couldn't stop eating it.  I, myself, have become addicted.  Very good! And a great introduction to food from Africa.  Thank you!

This just did not work out for my husband & I. For all the trouble I went through to make it and hazelnuts are expensive here, he tasted it and said "hmm, yum, zatar." (zatar is a simple lebanese dish of thyme, sesame, sumac...etc.) Zatar is nothing impressive to a Lebanese person, LOL so any dish that he thinks is zatar & has expensive ingredients is not worth my effort or money. It saves well however, I had it for so long then took it to Lebanon to let my mother-in-law try my "home-made zatar"!! LOL

Oh, gawd...so good.

I would advise a different hazelnut skin removal trick:  boil 2 cups of water with two tablespoons of baking soda,  add hazelnuts and boil for 3 minutes.  Remove the nuts from water and put in a bowl of ice water.  The skins come off easily.  

So yummy with crusty, hot sourdough!

My Egyptian husband didn't know what I was talking about when i told him about "dukkah" and described the recipe. After he smelled the spice mixed, he did suddenly recognize it as something he grew up sprinking over his eggs. It's pronounced "da'a" since Egyptians leave the k silent. Anyway, I personally hate black pepper and cumin so I'm not a big fan of this stuff, but it makes hubby happy.

Very good.  I did not use as much black pepper and am glad I didn't.  I also used ground coriander and cumin because I had it on hand and didn't want to spend the money on seeds unless I really liked it.  Next time I'll try it with the seeds and I bet I will like it even more!

I heard of about Dukkah but never tried it.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly but my family felt the cumin was too strong. I now use just 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and Kosher salt(reduced  to 1/2 teaspoon).   Love it with any bread available.

ps.  The Egyptians I know love it, but they do not think it tastes like the original, authentic Dukkah .

I've been making this for a few years now and always have it on hand. Yummy, and, yes, addictive!

Love this as I love zaatar. But I need to laugh when people can't see the difference between a tablespoon and a teaspoon....

Almonds are cheaper, so I always use them instead. Still delicious. Served with my wife's homemade bread, it's always a hit.

I added half of the pepper, a tablespoon of fennel seeds ground, a tablespoon of cardamom, a tablespoon of tumeric, and a tablespoon of curry powder to add a little zip.  We love Dukkah and first enjoyed it in Perth, Australia where we lived for 3 years.

I sprinkled this Dukkah over the an Egyptian stew and vegetable side dishes, and it was awesome. This spice blend is a new favorite at our home. Thanks rosichops for sharing your recipe.

This Middle Eastern cooking is a whole new adventure for me!!! I just got done making this recipe and I have to say I've never tasted anything remotely like this. I think it's delish; I love the heat of the cumin and coriander, along with the texture of the sesame seeds and hazelnuts. I'm looking forward to many of the serving suggestions I've read here for Dukkah. However, the only caveat is I will cut the salt down to AT LEAST HALF!!! Every bite is unique, but a whole tsp of salt, IMO, is terribly overpowering and takes away from the delighful, complex medley of flavors. Enjoy!!!
