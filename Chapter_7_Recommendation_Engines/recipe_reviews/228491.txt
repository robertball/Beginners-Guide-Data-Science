As a bartender, I would add that instead of one fluid ounce of sweet and sour, fill your glass 2/3 of the way, then add a splash of Coke. Otherwise the ratio is off and it will be too strong.

When I read the ingredients after reading the hook line, "The REAL Long Island Ice Tea", this brought back memories of how my grandmother made this as my wedding punch about 40 years ago.  Everyone talked about this slamming drink and wondered what were the ingredients.  Yes this is the REAL thing!  My grandmother wouldn't tell me the recipe except in excerpts; I finally got the recipe out of her over the years!
I say enjoy but be careful because the smoothness can cause you to forget there is alcohol until you go to move of your seat.  LOL!

I did not know that tequila was in a "real" Long Island. I made a couple of these for me & my husband while we prepped for thanksgiving dinner. If we were to have had more than one, we would not have finished. It was really tasty!

Excellent recipe! I did a couple of things differently: 1. I abhor store bought sour mix, so I used simple syrup and lime juice; 2. I used Orange Caracao in place of Triple Sec. It turned out wonderfully and I've been using this recipe's ratios for years.

This IS the Original and Famous LIIT recipe!  You got it so right Sledge!  and guess where I am from Long Island, NY!  The only thing I do differently is put it all in the Tom Collins glass and then roll it into a shaker and back in the Tom Collins glass and then garnish with lemon!

I used a simple syrup instead of the sweet and sour mix and squeezed in some lemon juice.  It's really good.

This was plenty strong, and tasted WAY better than what you pick up in a normal bar.  If you want it a little less "strong" you can double the cola.  And I know it's not "authentic," but the first time I made this, we actually didn't have cola on hand, so I subbed with ginger ale, and it was pretty dang good that way too!

Do not exceed four of these unless you like the spinning room effect. You forget how much alcohol is in there because it's so good. This recipe is by far the best of all I've tried. I'll definitely be keeping stocked for it.

Great recipe even on a budget!

I made this using pretty cheap alcohols and it turned out great.  If you are going the cheap route, I would recommend adding a little extra cola.

Great choice! I cannot taste the alcohol in it either.

This is the perfect LIIT recipe. Absolutely perfect. Most places I go to make it too sweet and not strong enough. I feel like i'm getting cheated at those places.

I made it with the sweet and sour mix. Eh. Read more on liit and made my own simple syrup. So I mixed the sweet and sour and used 1/2 oz simple syrup and 1/2 oz FRESH lemon juice. World of difference.

Just about the exact same way I make it.  Though I usually do the cola by "taste" which ends up slightly less than called for herein.  Still, you can't wrong w/this mix as stated and for the bartender that gives it 3 stars?  Just remember, most bar prepared long island teas taste awful in comparison to this recipe.  (Cheap sweet & sour mix? )  Not for certain why the bars usually aren't as good as I use well brands to make and so much better.

Only thing is I would make my own sweet sour mix, 1 cup fresh lemon juice, 1 cup lime juice, 1/2 cup water and 1 cup sugar. Heat solution and mix. Chill before use. Stays good for about 2 weeks in refrigerator.

I live on Long Island NY.
From a native, a couple pro tips:
Double all the volumes.
Use simple syrup (sugar water) and juice of 1 lime instead of sweet and sour mix. 
Substitute a splash of Jaegermeister or Red Bull for cola.

Word of advice. if you buy triple sec that is liquor free, put 1 oz. Of each liquor in and it tastes great. I always made it 1oz of each liquor 1 oz of alcohol free triple sec 2 oz of sweet and sour and cola to taste. I bought triple sec today and it was 40 proof so it was very strong. made it as recommended above and its perfect

One of the best LIIT I've had in a very long time, I was worried it would be over powering but it was very smooth going down!

Thank you Sledge! I finally have a "go to" Long Island recipe that is oh so close to exactly how we like it. I will likely up the ratio of sweet and sour mix  a little bit next time, but love it made exactly per the recipe.

While bartending, I had always used sprite or 7up instead of sweet and sour mix. The newly 21 year olds loved them.

Definitely not.  Tequila is wayyyyy too overpowering.  Does not taste like tea.  I notice other recipes increase the sweet & sour and the coke.  I will be trying that next time.

This is so delicious. It somehow seems to cancel out the alcohol taste and there-in is the rub...you could easily drink these in the same quantities as you would regular iced tea. Don’t.

I love it. This thing is delicious. I would increase the serving to three when attempting. One serving is a very small glass.

Made a homemade, sugar free simple syrup and added elmons and lime juice to it to replace the sweet & sour mix.  Other than that, followed the recipe to the T and it was great!!!

EXCELLENT!  I used extra sweet and sour though and extra diet coke otherwise it was too strong. Will keep this one as the only one I make.

This recipe is great.  I usually mix a bit more sour mix with the drink but after two of these you are feeling pretty good.
