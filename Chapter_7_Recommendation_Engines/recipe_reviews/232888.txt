I cut this back by half and used a cranberry-raspberry juice blend. My kids liked this a lot but I thought it was incredibly sweet.

I made it  exactly  as written except I made servings for 4.  I still think it needs less sweetened condensed milk.  I was wondering what else you can substitute the milk for.   I would rather taste more of the fruit then the milk.  Other than that, it tastes great.
