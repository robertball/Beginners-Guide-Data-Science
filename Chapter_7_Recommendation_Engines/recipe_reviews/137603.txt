I hate to be juvenile but......OMG!!!! are these good!!  I didn't have any portobello mushrooms just used the regular white ones and honestly I just used store bought hummus plus the peppers and now I'm not sure I can have all these items separately without yearning for them all together in this recipe!!!  HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

These were great! I just made them for our early Christmas get together and everyone wanted the recipe. I did not have portobello mushrooms so I used "regular". Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  I had homemade hummus to use up (Hummus III from the website is awesome!)  I didn't have red pepper hummus so I just added a chopped up roasted red pepper to the mixture instead of green pepper.  I also had some leftover caramelized onions to use up, which worked great.  I'm going to make this one over and over, so thanks for the recipe.

I bought red pepper hummus for this recipe and overall, it was good but I think regular hummus would provide the same result.  The recipe is a great idea but you need to personalize the ingredients.

These mushrooms are a great appetizer that can be assembled ahead of time. I followed recipe minus the lemon pepper. I swapped out green peppers for colored ones I had on hand and also added about 2 Tablespoons of green onions. That I would do again. I took them to a party. Several hours before I had to leave I completed the recipe except for baking and put them in the refrigerator. I baked the mushrooms at the party. They were a hit!

Great recipe, easy to make, healthy and so flavorful. Cooked for friends who are on a low-fat, low-salt diet, and it's now a regular on our menu at home. Great to make on the run when you don't have much time or energy to cook. I serve it with a side of couscous or crusty bread.

This was good, and very popular at the BBQ I brought them to, even though I had some picky eaters present.  Interesting flavor... although I have other stuffed mushroom recipes that I like a little better, this one is still a keeper since it's healthier than those others I have.

We liked this recipe.  The lemon pepper and red pepper hummus gave the mushrooms a mild spice.  It was a little messy to eat, but it tasted good.  I'll make this again.

To quote another reviewer....OMG!  These were delish!  I did make substitutions: button mushrooms & sundried tomato & basil hummus.  I think they would be great on a bed of field or baby greens tossed with a light O & V dressing.  Mmmmmmm...

This was very easy but I changed it slightly.  I don't like green bell peppers so I used sliced green onion instead.  It brought a lot of flavor to the recipe.  It was very good and I would serve this as an appetizer or as a side dish.  I served it with grilled boneless porkchops and it was a wonderful combination of flavors.

Made AS IS, just omitted the lemon pepper because it's not a household favorite.  Got thumbs up from all my guests for New Years Dinner.

added chipotle and dijon mustard to the topping but this recipe was a good one. unfortunately my mushrooms weren't very deep despite removing stems and rubbing, but I covered with aluminum foil in the oven to keep the topping from crisping too much and it was delicious. 

These will definitely be made again.

Disclaimer: I did not have the exact ingredients to make as stated, but the entire concept is excellent and easy to tweak based on preferences and what's on hand!  I used 1/4 c whipped cream cheese, 1/2 c original hummus, garlic and crushed red pepper to taste.  Never would have thought to use hummus...sooo good!

I used white mushrooms instead of portabellas, so I skipped step #2. I also completely forgot about the lemon pepper. These were okay but nothing spectacular. I'd go with a different stuffed mushroom recipe next time.

Loved this recipe!  Used large portobellos, homemade hummus, and a little less cream cheese than called for.  Delicious dinner!  Thank you.
