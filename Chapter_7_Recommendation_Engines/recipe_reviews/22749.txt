This is a excellent recipe for banana puddings. I am dieting right now, and I wanted to see what this would taste like with lowfat ingredients, so this is what I did. I used lowfat sweet condensed milk and vanilla wafers.  I used 1% milk and lite vanilla wafers.  The recipe calls for 14 banana's, but I think that was too many unless you really like bananas.  I used only 9 or ten. Also the recipe call for a 12 ounce container of whipped topping.  I didn't find the 12, it was 10oz or 16oz, so I used the 16oz.  It made the pudding mixture more creamy.  And one last thing, you don't need a 16oz box of vanilla wafers, the 12oz box worked great for me.  I used a 13x9 baking glass dish and it turned out great.  I hope my review helps.

This one is a keeper!!  The only thing that I did differently is that I used the cook 'n serve pudding and let it cool.  This was much creamier than the instant pudding, which my family does not like.  I suggest you try the cook 'n serve pudding and you will agree, it makes the recipe taste even better!!!  THANKS FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE!!

My husband's favorite dessert is banana pudding, but I didn't make it often because it was so time-consuming.  But this recipe is the greatest!!! I have made this at least three times in the past month.  The only change I made was to decrease the whipped topping to 8 ounces in order to taste the pudding flavor more.  My glass bowl isn't as big I guess because I use only about 3 to 5 bananas and I don't measure the wafers - just layer any amount!!!  I also have enough to make a small bowl and send home with my 2 granddaugters I care for - they LOVE this banana pudding too.

The reason this is way too sweet is because it uses "frozen whipped topping" which is sweetened.  Instead of this, just whip up a pint of cream (don't add sugar!) and fold that into the extra sweetened pudding mix (after it has solidified).  It's perfect.  :)  Fresh whipped cream is always better anyway

YUM!  I cut the recipe in half & used 4 bananas, which was plenty.  Next time I will crumble the wafers into a crust as a previous reviewer suggested.  Eat this quick, the bananas start to turn brown the next day.  Thank you Kenneth!!

This recipe is best chilled 24 hours covered in the fridge before serving, try using 16 oz. of whipped topping instead of 12 it stretches it a little and makes it a little less sweet. Try 2 packages of the darkest waffers you can find. Build 3 layers as waffers, bananas, pudding, repeat. ENJOY!

Very good, especially on a warm summery day! However, after reading some of the other reviews on it being a little on the sweet side, I decreased the cool whip to half and added plain whipped cream to make up the difference. Then, I decreased the condensed milk to half a can- I thought it was perfect!

Great Recipe!  I was tasting as I went and as other reviewers said, it was WAY too sweet so I only added half of the sweetened condensed milk.  After I added the whipped topping and layered it with the vanilla wafers and bananas, it was awesome.  My husband told me to rate this a 5 and my 3 year old ate it up!

This was the best! I layered in a glass casserole dish and topped with whipped topping.
Also to get a more of a pie crust bottom crumble the wafers and mix with a little butter, bake and cool before layering.

YUM!!  My DH, who is a banana pudding snob, never eats it unless it is the cooked kind.  Even he had to admit that this was better.  I think 14 bananas must be a typo, who has a bowl that big?
I used 4 bananas and all 4 of my kids wanted to know when I would make it again.

Delicious!  This dish has been a hit at family picnics and with co-workers. I used a glass pan (13x9).  I took a handful of wafers, threw em in a ziploc & crushed them with my rolling pin;  This was the very bottom layer, then sliced bananas (a quick dip in lemon juice to preserve), spread the whipped pudding topping, and lay whole wafers down.  Repeat until done.  Last layer is the whipped topping & I sprinkle some crushed wafers on top.  This turns out more like a torte.  This is by far one of my favorite desserts!  Oh, I only use about 5-6 large bananas. I used sugar-free pudding, reduced fat wafers & cool whip lite.  You can also use French Vanilla or Banana pudding to mix up the flavor a bit.  Honestly, I would just use vanilla.  Also, I ran out of vanilla one time while making this, so I used maple syrup instead -- tasted great!!

YUM! YUM!  This was a hit for our Easter dinner.  I may replace the vanilla pudding for banana next time so it will be extra banana-ish!
My guests are already wanting the recipe and it's definitely worth passing on.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is the almost the same I've used for years now.  I add an 8 oz cream cheese block.  For those of you who thought this was too sweet you might want to add the cream cheese and see it that helps.  I always blend the cream cheese with the condensed milk.  Then add the pudding and whipped cream.  This is a yummy banana pudding and it's always gone when I take it to share!

This pudding was excellent. It was very sweet, the teenagers in the family liked it the best.  Letting it chill for 12-24 hours helps. I brought this as one of my desserts to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. :)

This is a very good "quick and easy" Banana Pudding recipe, when there's little time for either Cook & Serve, or, better yet, a truly homemade pudding recipe.  The 5 stars are for THIS EXACT recipe (well, with the exception of the 14 banana's - wow, must be a misprint, right? – I used 5).  Having said that, I will offer a variation that my family and friends seem to like.  I have often added a mashed banana (or more to taste), just after I mix the pudding and milk, and then add the sweetened condensed milk.  It gives the vanilla pudding a banana flavor that isn’t quite the same with the boxed, banana-flavored pudding mixes.  Additionally, I think I agree with other posts regarding the sweetness factor of the full can of SCM.  However, my family thinks I’m crazy and everyone says, “Keep using the whole can.” It’s clearly a matter of taste!  So, to recap:  1. Quick - not a difficult recipe to make.  2. Sweet - adjust the SCM relative to the taste preferences of those to whom you plan to serve the pudding.  3. A consistent hit with all my family and friends.  Bottom line:  I believe it’s difficult to go wrong with this one!  Good luck.

This was my first time making un cooked banana pudding. My dad is a fan of only the cooked banana pudding, but when I made this, he truly enjoyed it. This banana pudding did not take a long time to make at all. I finished this recipe in not time and it came out delicious!! I definitley recommend this recipe.

As mentioned before, this recipe is VERY sweet.  I am usually a huge fan of rich, sweet things, but I could only handle one dish of this (which was good).  Also, unless you need to feed an army, I would scale it down. It filled a 12 cup dish!  I'm not a huge fan of leftover brown bananas so I didn't want to eat the leftovers, although if you like that, there was plenty!  And I would NOT use 14 bananas, it was way too many...maybe 4-5 at most!

I took this dessert to my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  I was a little worried since it's not a traditional Thanksgiving dessert, but decided to make it anyway and I doubled the recipe.  I got thumbs up from all the kids! They loved it.  I forgot to buy the sweetened milk, and it turned out fine.  It would have been much too sweet with it. I also used fat free whipped topping and used about 15 bananas for a double recipe. I can't wait to make this again.

This was a little bit sweet for me but my fiance loved it. I think I will will put in half the whipped topping next time so it will still be sweet but not so overpowering. I didn't use as many bananas as the recipe calls for. I think I only managed to fit 7 in my dish with everything else.

This pudding rocks..except I DONT LIKE BANANAS..so I make mine with Strawberrys that I sprinkle with lemon juice and sugar. The lemon juice helps the fruit last longer. I also make a banana one for my boyfriend...They are so good.

My husband is a cooked banana pudding snob, and even he agreed it was really good!!  His first impression was that it was too sweet, but after all the things were together, he liked it. 

I had made this for a BBQ we hosted for about 25 friends.  This was one of the few thigns that was completely gone at the end!  Everyone raved about it!  I'd definitely make it again, and I'd consider decreasing the sweetened condensed milk a little.

Just made this moments ago, except added 8 oz. cream cheese. Add cream cheese and use Pepperidge Farm's Chessman's cookies and you have Paula Deen's "Not yo Mama's Nana Puddin'"

Simply heaven! I made this on a Thursday, and it
was gone by Saturday night. Since I'm a nilla wafer lover verses a banana lover, I used 8 more
ounces of wafers. Everyone loved it! Even my mother had to ask where I found the recipe. Y'all
try this. It's good and easy!

This banana pudding was light and creamy -- very delicious.  My sister said it was undoubtedly the best banana pudding she's ever had and I agree!

This a very tasty recipe, however, I sometimes use french vanilla pudding and whipped topping when i can find it.  It gives it a more richer flavor than regular vanilla. Oh and we use only 3-4 bananas and extra vanilla wafers.

Sooo good.  Just like my granny used to make every sunday!  I did make a few changes to make it a little more like granny's.  I only used an 8oz. container of whipped topping and folded the entire container into the pudding.  I also used @ 6 medium bananas. (Granny always had a banana layer on the bottom, in the middle, and on the top.)
P.S. Egg slicer works great to slice bananas.

This recipe made a huge batch of pudding.  I took it for my family's Easter gathering last year. I layered it in a very large glass bowl, which would have looked nice except for the fact that the bananas turned brown.  It had pretty good flavor, but was very sweet.  It made so much I had to throw a lot away, and my family just wasn't as crazy about it as I had hoped.  Nothing in particular wrong with it, but if I do make it again it will be a much smaller batch.

Yummy. I used half the bananas and it was perfect for us. I mixed half of the whipped topping into the pudding mixture and spread the remaining across the top, then topped it with a few chopped walnuts. In response to KRESPOS: Try reducing the milk added to the pudding mix to make the filling firmer (there may be instructions on the box), then spread some whipped topping on top of the pie, rather than mixing it into the pudding. Oh, and you can buy Nilla Wafer pie crusts at the supermarket (I've seen them in California).

Love this recipe. The only change is I use 1 can of carnation evaporated milk and about 6-8 bananas. And it is best to do it the day before you are going to serve it. One of my most acclaimed recipes at work. Delicious!!!

WOW!  This was so good!  I didn't have a 5oz box of pudding, so I used two boxes of the 3.4oz size, but I kept the amount of milk the same.  I also only used 4 bananas, sliced, and splashed w/ lemon juice to keep from turning brown.  I then slightly crushed the vanilla wafers to make them easier to eat.  I would recommend making this the night before so the wafers can soften a bit.  I will definitely make this again and again!

O.k. recipe, but I've had better (cooked pudding type has much more flavor). I made this for a group of ladies, and it received no favorable comments and no requests for the recipe (unusual for this group!). I followed others' suggestions to only use half the sweetened condensed milk and reduced the whipped topping for 8 oz. and garnished with chopped walnuts, but it still was just average.

This recipe is excellent!  It's the best banana pudding I've had!  It's really easy and quick to make.  Because I prefer more wafers, I didn't use as many bananas (about 5).

I've been making this banana pudding for well over 10yrs, just made it last wk for hubbies b-day. It is great, this was and probably still is in some circles originally  called Banana Pudding Supreme...EVERYONE who's tasted it just goes crazy. My ingredients are pretty much the same, but over the years I've been tweaking them, so this is what I do.  I add a couple bricks of softened cream cheese, and instead of vanilla pudding, I use banana flavored pudding mix, also I add in a Lil banana extract. And if you don't want your bananas to turn brown soak them in lemon juice, which also adds that extra umph to this wonderful desert. You really don't need to layer it, to save time, just pour the bananas and cookies in your dish, spread them, and pour in filling, carefully mix and re-spread, put cookies on top for the layered look.  But either way, ya simply can't go wrong with this banana pudding.

I have tried this twice, the second time with less milk and it was to liquidy both times. I followed it step by step and it was just like melted ice cream. The second time I used 1.5 cups of milk and it did the same. It was literally bananas, wafers and the rest pure liquid!

Best banana pudding EVER! It tasted like a dessert from a gourmet restaurant. Made it for a BBQ for the 4th yesterday and it was a hit. 

Before you try to make it "less sweet" try the full recipe first. It wasn't too sweet to me,

Wonderful. I thought the sweetened condensed milk would make it too sweet, but it was just right. Served it at a family get together, it was a hit. Will make again.

Love this recipe! It was very easy and my family couldn't get enough of it. I haven't made banana pudding a whole lot, because most of the other recipes that I have used, just didn't seem sweet enough or was way to sweet. I will most certainly be using this recipe again!

Turned out to be pretty good. My was not thick I added 3cups of milk instead of 2. You should add whatever the pudding package calls for. I also added 1tsp of vanilla flavoring and only used have of the condensed milk.

So good!  I made it exactly as written (except for the 14 bananas...typo?).  I used 4 bananas.  It was delicious!  Our guests took some home with them!  There was none left at the end of the night.  GREAT!

yummy.  this is very very good.  My only issue is that it is made with cool whip which is soooo bad!!  I am going to try making it with real whipping cream.  I would also suggest slighlty decreasing the condensed milk as it is a touch too sweet for me- a kind of syrupy sweetness.

My family loved this recipe.  It does make a lot of banana pudding, so if you can't eat it in one sitting, I would suggest that you cut the recipe in half.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I love this banana pudding. It's so good! I add less bananas 3 to 5. It depends on what size dish you're making- mine is 9x12. I start layering the dish this way: little bit of pudding, next two layers of whole cookies, next lots of crumbled cookies, then the rest of pudding. The top: whole cookies all around and then crumble lots of cookies at the top. Lovely!

Excellent and SUPER easy!  After reading other reviews I decided to use only 3/4 of a can of sweetened condensed milk to lessen the sweetness.  I also used 6 bananas as I think that the 14 the recipe calls for is an error.  This will definitely become a staple dessert for our household!

Nice texture and simple  to make, but waaaaayyyyyyyy too sweet.  I think the condensed milk could have been left out, and if real whipped cream way substituted for cool whip, it would have improved it a lot.

Sooooo good!  I used fat free condensed milk and skim milk and reduced fat vanilla wafers, it was still decadent!  Also, I used vanilla cool whip rather than regular flavor.  I brought it to a party and it was gone in a flash!

This was so awesome.  LOVED it!!  I made a day ahead so the wafers would soften.  I copied straight from the directions did not change anything, except to keep your bananas from browning toss them or soak them in lemon, lime, or orange juice.  They stay nice and white for a few days.

Have made this several times - everyone loves it.  Because I have a little guy - I have even used teddy graham's in the recipe - still taste excellent (and cost less).  Also I prefer to use 2 containers of whipped cream because 1 isn't enough for more than one layer.  Found the pudding to be plentiful though :)

What a wonderful banana pudding to eat in the summer time.  It is cool and refreshing.  So easy to make. It is one that you can make with your grandkids. Will make this many times in the summer.  God bless you :)

I'm not a huge banana pudding fan, but I must say this was very tasty.  I actually messed up and bought the smaller size pudding and smaller size whipped cream, but it still came out yummy.  On an important note--I would strongly recommend letting it chill in the refrigerator over night to let the wafers get chewy and give the flavors time to mingle.  It won't taste the same if you don't (I know because I tried some a couple hours after I made it).  Let it chill and enjoy!

What a scrumptious version for banana pudding! My guests licked their plates! It didn't take long to make and the combination of pudding, cool whip and condensed milk made for the creamiest banana pudding I have ever tasted! The only thing I change was instead of a whole can of condensed milk, I only used 3/4 of the can and it came out perfect. I figured a whole can would be too sweet. I didn't use as many bananas (4 total) because I like more cookie and pudding. Also, I sliced my bananas thin so I did not need that many bananas. Overall, it is a keeper. Try it! You will not be dissappointed!

This pudding was divine Kenneth.  My son and I gobbled it up.  Instead of leaving the vanilla wafers whole, I crushed them up in a ziploc bag and had little bits of cookie crumbs in each layer.  This was a really good recipe....thanks!

This was so tasty! We did not use quite as much bananas - about 4 - and it turned out great. Next time I am going to crush the wafers. This is not good the next day, the wafers get soggy and bananas old so make sure you eat it fresh! I used all lowfat and nonfat ingredients and it was still good!

I grew up on warm banana pudding but wanted to try a cold one for my husband.  I am so glad I tried this recipe first, now I do not have to try any more!  It is incredibly easy and tastes fantastic.  I would not have dreamed that so few ingredients would be so good.  Love it!

I've made this recipe numerous times & because I like to make as many layers as I can, I've ended up using more ingredients than the recipe calls for.  Of course, it all depends on how many layers you do, & if you do a lot of layers, you need to use enough pudding mixture to cover, but not too much to where you'll run out. Too many times I've run out of wafers/bananas/cool whip that I've learned to buy extra so I don't need to worry about it. 
Anyway, I've ended up using roughly a box & a quarter of wafers, just to completely cover each layer. I also use a 2nd package of cool whip on the very top, which allows me to use all the pudding mixture between the layers. (I whip it up in the container with a spoon to make it easier to spread.) Also, I don't use 14 bananas, I think it's more like 9 or 10, but it just depends on how thick you slice them. 
Problems I've had due to not paying attention - make sure the pudding is instant, only use 2 cups of milk for the pudding as this recipe states (not 3 like the pudding box says), & scoop the mixture onto the layers carefully with a spatula & be careful spreading it, so you don't mess up the layers. Other than that, it's super easy, very delicious, & inexpensive to make. Enjoy!

We do not care for soggy wafers nor browned bananas---so the solution to this is that I make the "pudding part" and then just prior to serving, slice the desired amount of bananas into the individual portion bowls. Add pudding.  Top with nilla wafers.  Then eat immediately.  Refrigerate the left over pudding part for left overs.  Use fresh bananas and wafers each time.

Whenever I go to a BBQ I make this! 
I've also had a family member ask for this instead of cake for his birthday!
The only alterations I make are as follows; 
I use 2 3oz boxes of instant pudding. (1 french vanilla and 1 banana creme)
I use almost a full can of condensed milk (I leave maybe 2-4 tbps left in can)
I use 2 8 oz containers of cool whip (I use all of one and 3/4 of the second in the pudding mixture and put the 1/4 on the top and crumble the wafer cookies on top)
Delicious!

The first pudding I didn't eat. This stuff is way to sweet. If you want something you can leave out overnight, and still be the same, this is it. I've had better with instant pudding, bananas, and vanilla wafers.

I love this recipe! It is a hit everytime I make it, whether it is for a get together or just for my husband.  Only thing I change is I use 6 bananas, 14 is way too many and I use 16oz of coolwhip, 12oz in the pudding and the remaining on top with some crushed wafers. Absolutely delicious!

I tripled the recipe and used 3 boxes of banana flavored instant pudding, 6 cups of milk, one 40 oz box of wafers, 3 tablespoons of vanilla, 8 bananas, but still only ONE can of condensed milk and ONE 12 ounce container of whipped topping in the mix. I used 4 ounces of whipped topping to cover it. it was PERFECT. You will need to let mixture chill for 5 minutes before pouring. My photo is enclosed under lmpeavy.

I made this for the first time last night.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  I love banana pudding.  But the real decision will be made when my husban and son taste it.  If they like it, then it's a hit!!  I'm trying not to eat it up before they get home.

My husband loves banana pudding....BUT....only mine, until now! I made this one and now he says this is the one he wants me to make from now on. I made it for a family gathering this summer, planning on bringing leftovers home. Oh how wrong AND surprized I was, the only thing I took home was an empty bowl!! The only thing I did change on this one was (like many others stated) I used only about 5 or 6 at most bananas and that was plenty. Other then that I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for this one!!!

I made this pudding for our Easter celebration and everyone loved it.  I prepared the pudding using 3 cups of milk as directed on the package of the 1.5oz pudding (couldn't find the 5 ounce size).  I also only added 3/4 can of the sweetened condensed milk and 4 bananas. I will be making this pudding over and over again.  Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe.

Okay, so I made this recipe and FORGOT to add the can of sweetened condensed milk, and the pudding was still fabulous - got lots of compliments on it!  Next time I will definitely try and remember to include the condensed milk for sure.

This recipe is amazing! ive made it a few times and every time i make it its a huge hit! however, i dont like it too sweet and this last time i decided to use cream cheese in it. i used a package and softened it a bit in the microwave and just blended it in. it totally did the trick! helped cut back the sweetness and gave it a little something more just to make it even more amazing! next time id like to try a little more cream cheese. maybe half a package more?

Wonderful.  Make it for a crowd because it's huge and very filling.  Just beware: once you make this, you can never go back - it will be requested every time there are extra bananas lying around.

Goof but not great. DH likes the cooked version better.  I like uncooked better. I thought this was too sweet. Most of this never got eaten.

You have not glimpsed heaven until you try this pudding... *happy sigh* I brought this for Thanksgiving and everyone was singing my praises, lol. I made the recipe to a key, using reduced fat 'Nillas and low fat Cool Whip- at first it tasted off, but since I made it the night before, the next day it was perfect (I guess it just needed to mingle with the 'Nillas and bananas). I layered them in a glass bowl, and used about 5 bananas, but next time I will use 6-7 for extra banana goodness. 5 stars for a reason my friends!

Delicious! I had a guest say "I know this is a faux pas, but if you have any extra, can I please take some home?" This does not taste like instant pudding at all. I crumbled the nilla wafers and I let the whole dish sit in the fridge over night--the vanilla wafers became deliciously soft. I omitted the condensed milk and used 2 1/2 cups cold milk instead (still plenty sweet), and I only used 8 oz of whipped cream since that was all I had. It was so good. I have never liked a pudding so much.

Really good! Made this for a group of ladies that are good cooks, and they all loved it. I added a little cinnamon for a fall flair and it worked great. I also added coconut and that was a big hit too. I found the pudding mix a little thin, so the next time I make it, I won't add as much milk, or sweetened condensed milk. Also, I used low-fat sweetened condensed milk. I would do that again plus I will use fat free milk. It's great! I will definately make it again.

I made this for a shag party and it got rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I may experiment and add some coconut between the layers.  Also, I was thinking about some shaved chocolate or strawberries or blueberries or walnuts or... geesh!  The sky's the limit!  Thanx for the recipe!

This was my first banana pudding I have made.  It was great.  I used a little less than half a can of the sweetened condensed milk and it was plenty sweet.

Very good banana pudding! I didn't use the entire can of condensed milk - maybe 2/3 of it. And it was PLENTY sweet. Also, I used fresh whipped cream, just because I prefer the flavor to Cool Whip. Very easy!

It was good, but the sweetwened condensed milk made the recipe too sweet and that's saying a lot coming from me. I made it again without and  made the banana pudding according to the box instructions and it went over much better.

This dessert was better than our sainted aunt's famous Southern-style banana pudding.  My family loved it, and they're used to the best!  I used half as much of the sweetened condensed milk and only two bananas.

I did it exactly like the instructions say for 10 instead of 20. Unfortunately, I needed more whipped cream and the pudding came out way sweeter than I like. Which was bad, because I really like banana pudding. I suggest less condensed milk, unless you like your pudding sweet.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I ran into a pinch and needed to take a dessert.  I followed this recipe for the pudding portion but lined a graham cracker pie shell with bananas and topped with the filling.  This recipe made 2 pies.  Excellent.  I used pie shells because I had them on hand and did not have the vanilla wafers.

Very good recipe!  I made exactly as instructed, except I crushed the cookies for a crumb crust, used only about 5 bananas and repeated the layers twice.  I received rave reviews from both family and co-workers.  I don't like things too sweet and I found this recipe was just right.  Super easy and delicious!

This is truly the best!! I made it for a crowd, NOTHING was left over. There was even vying to "lick-up" the bowl. I was content with the recipe as is.
I also used the custard for the layer in English trifle. I cut back on the condensed milk, to see how it would taste. My preference is the original.

This recipe was yummy! Don't cut the number of bananas in half- I did 8 and it wasn't enough for me. Also it WAS NOT too sweet. Just perfect for my tatse. This will really please a banana pudding lover. It was sooo easy.

I love this recipe.  Although I love the custard style as well, I just prefer this style of banana pudding.  I use two packages of wafers, and less bananas. I do this because the more cookies in my banana pudding the better.  No offense Bananas!

Made this for a banana pudding expert, and she loved it. It looked a little fluffy and light for pudding. It was more like a mousse...but it was gone in no time. Excellent recipe!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I highly recommend!  The only thing I did different was to double the recipe.  I made this for an event and received tons of complements from talented Southern ladies that know their desserts.

I dont use Cool Whip so I whipped about 3/4 pint of heavy whipping cream and folded it into the pudding.   I also only used about 5-6 bananas and spritzed the slices in both sides with lemon juice on the cutting board before putting them into the pudding mixture so the bananas wouldn’t turn brown. (You can’t taste the lemon juice in the pudding).  It was fab!  Agree with other reviewers, 14 bananas would be way too much as you need a balance of the banana texture to pudding.  Suggest starting with 4 bananas and going from there.  You can always add more if you feel it needs it.

I have been making this recipe for YEARS. I make a few adjustments-I use the banana cream pudding mix instead of vanilla and I use a 16 oz tub of whipped cream. I also make sure to top with whipped cream and crushed wafers. Everyone loves the recipe so much it is the only thing I can bring for potlucks. I have to double it in a deep dish foil pan and bring 2! So quick and easy, it’s ridiculous. I like mine to refrigerate overnight too before serving.

Fantastic recipe and super easy!  My husband (who likes to cook occasionally) craved banana pudding so much that he searched for this recipe, bought the ingredients on his way home from work, and made it himself last night. It was a big hit with the whole family from ages 10 to 75. He was very proud of the result and so was I!

I've been eating and making Banana Pudding for over 50 years and this is the best I've had since my grandmothers!  I'm not a big fan of frozen whipped topping but used in this for a baby shower and was delighted, I think next time I will make my own whipped topping as I usually do but this was great!  You won't go wrong, I only used 7 medium sized bananas and that was plenty.  Will be my go to from now on. I even used instant pudding not the cook kind.  Enjoy!

Rave reviews the two times I’ve made it. Like others, I used fresh whipped cream that I lightly sweetened, and I think the flavor is perfect. However, I have been contemplating adding either Kahlua or Amaretto in lieu of vanilla for the next grown-up gathering.

This was the first time making Banana Pudding I added some shopped bananas to the vanilla pudding mix and also added slice bananas to the layers. Used some  crumble  vanilla wafers for the bottom/top layer this was a hit with my family. Would be making it more often from now on.

This is an excellent recipe, and it was a hit with the rest of the crew!  I modified it by using homemade whipped cream instead of frozen whipped cream.  That way, I can control the amount of sugar in the recipe.  Plus... it's just yummier.  This is definitely one to hang on to!

Ive made this Banana Pudding about 5 times already and each time it has been AWESOME.  All the Banana Pudding lovers I know have been blown away.  Sometimes I add other fruits to mine such as Red Raspberries, Blueberries, Pineapple chunks etc,,,"Off The Chain!!!!"...Thanks for sharing this wonderful desert.

After church on Sundays we get together in a cafe area and eat. At the adamant request of a 13-year old church member for me to make banana pudding, I found this recipe. Everyone just loved it and were coming back for seconds. There is nothing that I would change about this recipe except that I didn't need 14 bananas. I used about 6.

This was one of the best banana pudding I’ve ever made! My family couldn’t get enough of it. I put half of the whip cream in the pudding. Before I did the last layer of cookies I put the rest of the whip cream on and them sprinkled walnuts on the whip cream, then added the last row of cookies. It’s was so good! I will be making this again

Way too sweet.  The overly sweet richness takes away from the banana taste.  More like an instant mousse than pudding.

Don't try this with sugar free, fat free instant pudding!  I did and had to dump it out.  Instead of mixing into the milk, it formed a big gummy mess that got stuck to the spoon, the bowl and the counter!  Horrid.
I should have done what I did last year, which is use the regular instant pudding, even with the extra calories.  I agree with the reviewer who said you don't need a 16 oz box of vanilla wafers; still have some left and I used a small box. 
I had two 8-oz tubs of Cool Whip so just used 1-1/2 of that.  Nor did I use anything close to 14 bananas.  I have an average size footed trifle bowl, like the one in the photo.  Unless you're going to triple layer the bananas, there's no way that bowl would accommodate 14.
This recipe is easy, quick to make and I had a number of requests for it again because it was so popular last year.

Old grandmaws trick she taught me - add teaspoon lemon juice to recipe and it keeps your banannas from turning black after they are exposed to air. My first thought was wouldn't it make it sour, but no it doesn't change taste just preserves the fruit.

I made this exactly as the recipe posted BUT IT IS TOOO DARN SWEET! Why post a recipe which many are going to say it is too sweet knowing it is? THE NEXT TIME I WON'T BE ADDING the whipped topping or the sweetened condensed milk it's better off with unsweetened or with none at all!  Next time I know!

My husbands favorite dessert is banana pudding, so I thought I'd try a new recipe. I changed out the vanilla pudding for Hershey's White Chocolate pudding. It's only available in 3.4 oz packs so I used 2 and added in an extra 1/3 C of milk.  It is delicious & my husband loved it! Thanks for the oh so easy recipe.

I used two layers of wafers instead of one. I used crumbs on the bottom. I used half of the sweet condensed milk and half  the cool whip.  The full serving it calls for makes it really sweet I wanted it less sweet. Great recipe.

I used this recipe and put it into Solo Clear 9ox cups.It made 13 at about 3/4 full They were all gone within the hour. It was very easy to make and I got a lot of compliments. I will say the only thing about this recipe is that I DID NOT USE 14 bananas. I used 6 with the way that I styled it.

The first time I made it we were anxious to eat it, I found it to be a little heavy, had too much of the condensed milk flavor, and it was way too sweet....
The second day this banana pudding was the BEST I have ever had, it was delicious, creamy, enough sweetness and the bananas never turned color (i never dipped mine in lemon juice)
There was no way I could use 14 bananas,  I only used 6 and it was plenty.

Since then I have reduced the cool whip to 8 oz. container and I make sure that I make it the day before.
DELICIOUS !!!!!!!

Tried this last night and loved it!  Made it for a family gathering and a few people were already in line for seconds after their first bite. I used French vanilla pudding, regular cool whip and the whole can of condensed milk. It was not nearly as sweet as I was expecting from the other reviews. I'm glad I used it all. (I can't stand "sickeningly sweet" desserts, so I was a little afraid of using it all, but it wasn't that sweet at all.) We are at a vacation rental and they don't have spices, etc around here, and I didn't want to buy a bottle of vanilla for just a small amount, so I omitted it, and it was still excellent. I used a 9x13 pan and 6 bananas. Would have liked more bananas, but couldn't fit them in.

This is an old recipe from back in the 90's.  I needed a refresher as it's been a long time since I made this.  One thing the old recipe called for was cutting up the bananas before you started the custard/pudding prep.  Once finished with the bananas, you sprinkle lemon juice over them to keep them from turning brown and eventually black and then pour them through a strainer to drain off any excess juice before layering them.  I didn't use the instant pudding, I used the regular cook pudding 2 packages and only a 1/4 of condensed milk.  It was still sweet but not as sweet had I used the whole can. I used 8 Bananas 2 boxes of the ORIGINAL Vanilla Wafers.  Don't use off brand or you'll be sorry LOL...  One package of whipped cream.  As I type this, the banana pudding is being devoured by my son! He just came in from work and bypassed dinner for this. I made this for my pregnant daughter who is craving it but has not arrived yet.

Yummy!   I also used the whole box of vanilla wafers AND I added a layer of whip cream on top.   Not too sweet at all.

This recipe is off the chain! So delicious. I made it for my son's birthday party/barbecue and everyone raved about it and asked me how to make it. I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe as it is perfect. I did layer chessman cookies over the top to make it look pretty, but besides that, I left it the same.

My husband and I own a small country store.  We also have an amazing little deli and like to have homemade goodies of some sort all the time.  This banana pudding is one of our very best sellers.  We get compliments all the time.  I highly recommend it!  I had someone tell me she could eat a 5 gallon bucket of it.  :-)  Enjoy!

This is exactly like a recipe that we use in my family. The only thing I suggest is to mix in a package of cream cheese. It makes the pudding a little thicker and just adds
 a little extra yum. :-)

The best pudding i have ever tasted! I make this all the time, one thing i usually do a little differently is use a banana pudding mix instead of vanilla pudding.
I think it tastes better that way.

i eliminated the sweetened condensed milk and it turned out rich and yummy. I used two packs of vanilla pudding to make up for the elimination. with the can of sweetened condensed milk it would have been to sweet for me. it also saved calories and i used lite whipped topping. everyone loved it as easter dessert :) 4 stars becuase i changed it.

So yummy and easy to make!  My husband and our friends loved it!  The number of bananas that the recipe calls for is way too much, though.  I used 5 and that was plenty.

Makes a beautiful presentation. Looks like a lot of effort, but easy to make.  Taste great!  If you like banan pudding make this one. Use lots of wafers.

Very tasty banana pudding.  I made it for a 4th of July BBQ and sprinkled a few slices of strawberries and blueberries on the top for decoration.  Everyone commented that it was "really good", so I would definitely make again.  The only two things I might change from the original recipe is to use a smaller can of sweetened condensed milk, and use fewer bananas.  I used 9 medium/large bananas and that was pushing it.  Very yummy though!

The recipe is yummy!  I would like to share a long time favorite version in our family...

Our favorite has always been this quick version; using a tub of non fat topping, a few sliced up bananas and chrushed vanilla wafers until very thick.  Chill (gives the topping time to sink into the wafers a bit) or eat right away!  Easily adjusted for 1 person or many.

Every time I make this everyone begs for more. They don't sell vanilla wafers at my local supermarket. So I replace them with chocolate chip cookies, that I crumble up and they are heaven sent. I've probably have made this over 15 times. I would reduce the sweetened condensed milk to 3/4 of the can or even less. And if I want more pudding, I just make two, it gives a more creamy taste. I also use whip cream from the can. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Excellent recipe! I made this for a family cookout and it was a definite hit! My husband was upset that there were no leftovers to take home. The only thing I changed was I only used 4 bananas and it was plenty. I also used mini vanilla wafers and it looked and tasted great!! I will definitely be making this again.

I've made this recipe several times since it was posted. I use vanilla pudding instead of banana, sometimes I omit the bananas altogether and make it more like a vanilla pudding dessert since they don't keep for long and look bad if the bowl sits in the fridge for awhile. If you're on the fence about this recipe, definitely try it! It's so worth it!

great! i didnt have cool whip so I made chantilly cream and folded that in instead and it was great.  I also used vanilla wafers from Trader Joes which were really good with this recipie.

Absolutely amazing! I did cut the condensed milk and the Cool Whip in half, as someone had previously suggested.  Was plenty sweet using that ratio.  Used the rest of the Cool Whip to top it off with a sprinkling of nutmeg. My brother in-law said it exceeded my own mom's banana pudding.

I used this as a base for mine, but could not figure out these ingredients.  I had a small box of pudding mix, but it said 1 ounce and a larger box that said 1.5 ounce. I have never seen a 5 ounce pkg, so I used the larger box.   I was unsure of how many bananas to use after reading other reviewers comments.  I used 7 and that was plenty.  It was very good, but I will not give 5 stars, simply because of the questions about the ingredients list.

This recipe is awesome!  I used soy milk, used 3/4 can of the condensed milk, 4 bananas and layered the top with cookies.  Even the pickiest eaters ate this up! :-)

I thought the sweetness overpowered the banana flavor, so I think I'll try leaving out the sweetened condensed milk next time.  Also, I only used 4 bananas and didn't use the whole box of vanilla wafers either.  It's definitely a great recipe!

this was a delicious recipe. I took it to a picnic and when desserts were served this went first, so unfortunately I had nothing left to take home and snack on. I would use only 4 ounces of condensed milk otherwise too sweet and I only needed 6 to 8 large bananas.

This was a great recipe especially for busy moms like me. I did made some changes to make it little healthier. I used sugarfree/fatfree french vanilla pudding, skim milk, half a can of fatfree condensed milk, 8oz lite cool whip and reduced fat vanilla wafers. I followed the directions and it turned out great. Also I forgot that instead of 14 bananas I used 6 bananas. My family enjoyed it, especially my husband who has type 2 diabetes.

This was the greatest pudding. My husband can't stop eatting it. To keep the babanas from turning brown a squeezed a little fresh lemon juice over the bananas.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It is WAY too sweet!  Even the little kids thought it was too sweet.  I will make it again, and it will be a 5 star recipe without the sweetened condensed milk.

Just made this for New Year's Day lunch.  It was fabulous!  Never made banana pudding before but this will now be my recipe.  I copied the picture and put mine in a trifle bowl.  It was so pretty and made it look like I did so much more than I actually did.  Note: you will not need 14 bananas to make it though.  I only used about 8 and still had some left over.  So delicious!

i COULD NOT FIND A 16 OZ. BOX OF VANILLA WAFERS, ONLY A 12 OZ.  i COULD FIND NO 5 OZ VANILLA PUDDING ONLY 3.5.  IT WAS WAY TOO MANY VANILLA WAFERS AND IT WAS MORE THE CONSISTENCY OF WHIPPING CREAM THAN PUDDING

Yummm! 
I did a hybrid recipe for this one.  I took some different recipes and put them together to make a tasty treat.
I followed this recipe but I also whipped some sour cream (I know, it sounds gross but it's not at all) into the pudding/condensed milk mix.  I also made some tapioca and mixed that in with the pudding mix too.  Texture people sometimes have a problem with tapioca, but I love it, and it adds a nice "something extra" for the pudding.
I didn't mix the Cool Whip in immediately.. I put a layer of straight Cool Whip and a layer of pudding, then bananas and cookies, and then folded the rest of the Cool Whip in with the pudding and put that as the top layer.
It was a Thanksgiving hit... I will definitely will make again!

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I messed up and bought the smaller package of vanilla pudding - even so, it was really good.  Just a little too sweet. - My fault.

I make this recipes all the time.  I use the sugar free pudding and add a little more cool whip.  It keeps it from being too sweet, although, it's wonderful the original way as well.

Excellent!!  I made this last night, and it's already gone!  I used the suggested 3 cups of milk per the instructions on the pudding box and 4 bananas vs the 14.  I also crushed the wafers, but only because my kids couldn't wait for the wafers to get soft.  Will definitely make this again!!

This was just ok. The pudding was way too thick and I had to add more milk to get it to a pudding consistency and not like a thick paste and that affected the flavor I think. I will try another recipe.

I made this banana pudding over the holidays for my family and best friend who's from Georgia. It was so flavorful and creamy they all loved it. I made another for New Years eve. A fight almost broke out over the last of it. This recipe has become the "official family banana pudding". Thanks for sharing it, Kenneth.

This recipe was good; however, it was on the sweet side.  I almost could not eat it.  Next time I plan on eliminating the sweetened condensed milk.  Otherwise, it is a good recipe.

Amazing vanilla mix here! yummy
However the vanilla wafers are too chunky and strange... I used ukler biscuites (usualy called tea biscuits, their thin crispyish).
I've used fresh whipped cream, i think its even better.
There is toooo much bananas in the recipe... just slice and layer and see what u can fit in your bowl... thats what I did... mmmmm
enjoy it!

Super easy to make! I didn't use the condensed milk because it was plenty sweet just from the vanilla pudding and whipped topping. Very good and easy! I'm bringing some to a cookout today. :)

I made a few changes in this recipe.I use a 16 oz. container of Cool Whip and 
2 boxes mini vanilla wafers instead of what the recipe calls for.
Still just as good.

So easy and so good. I took this to a friends house and it was eaten up. I used  two of the small size pudding, one banana one vanilla, and otherwise followed recipe. Looking forward to making it again.

This was delicious. I cut the recipe in half, and my family was begging me to make it again a few days later. It was so easy to make that I whipped up another batch for them. I might have used a little bit less sweetened condensed milk than the recipe called for, but that was the only change I made.

The best, easiest banana pudding.  I almost feel bad when I get all the compliments when I bring this dish, because it is so easy. I think it took me about five minutes to whip together.  So good.

Delicious!  I added cream cheese to the pudding mixture.  Used only 7 bananas.  It was perfect.

A tad too sweet, but a huge hit.  Every last bite was devoured! Next time I'll just use half of the condensed milk as another reviewer suggested.

Great! After reading what others had written, I made this for a Mardi Gras party and was not in the mood to cook banana pudding. I made some modifications, but followed the basics of this recipe. Here is what I did different for a 9x13 pan .... 2 boxes of 5.1 oz instant vanilla pudding along with 1 small box of .9 oz banana cream instant pudding. Mixed the puddings (with a hand mixer) with 4 cups of light vanilla flavored soy milk (Silk brand)and 1.25 cups 2%milk (this made more pudding than would fit in the dessert dish...kids will be happy to eat extra). Then added one can of sweetened cond milk (mix well), 1T. vanilla, and folded in 15oz cool whip. I layered it as directed. I only used 6 bananas. I thought the pudding part had an EXCELLENT taste! My modifications makes enough to feed about 20+ (makes a ton!).

This was fabulous.  I did make some changes.  I used cooked pudding instead of instant, I added Bailey's Irish creme instead of the vanilla, I layered in pineapple tidbids (a wonderful addition) and I added shaved dark chocolate on top.  I have done it in a large glass bowl and also done it in snifter glasses, which makes a great presentation.  Thank you for a really good recipe!!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used half the amount of condensed milk.  I was worried that it'd be too sweet.  It came out great.  I did let it sit for 24 hours and it tasted f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s!

Wow!!!!!  I have never received so many raves and requests for the recipe in my life.  I took this to our Thanksgiving family meal and have already received requests for me to bring to Christmas.  The only changes I made are:  1 vanilla pudding and 1 banana cream mix, used Pepperidge Farm Mini-Chessmen cookies instead of Nilla Wafers.  Also couldn't fit all the bananas in my largest bowl, so probably used 8 or 10.  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

I always hated banana pudding growing up. Found this recipe and made it for my husband since he loves it and now Im hooked.

This is very good if you like a rich, very sweet banana pudding.  Next time, I will use just half the sweetened condensed milk and leave out the vanilla extract.  Kids will love this.

This is a very good banana pudding, exactly the way it was submitted.  After everyone had their fill of it, we put some in to-go containers for later, and we even put it in styrofoam cups to eat on the road. This is good anytime. Thanks.

A excellent recipe!  My girlfriend thought it may be too sweet with the two types of milk, not at all.  I dipped the bananas in lemon juice to give it that tart taste.  
A keeper!!!

Delicious! Delicious! I can't stop sneaking a bite here and there. The only thing I changed was decreased the bananas down to eight as some reviewers suggested. When I asked my sister-in-law, who is a BIG banana pudding fan, if it was as good as granny's...she said it might even beat it! That's a compliment!

I only used about 8 bananas; this is such a wonderful recipe!  I could only find the mini vanilla wafers so I used them, and they worked great.

Excellent! Always a big hit and the recipe is always asked for everywhere I take it. The only thing I change is that I only put about 8 bananas. Also, last time I could only find 16oz whipped topping and used it all. Was still just as great tasting!

I made this for an office party. Everyone raved about how it was the best banana pudding they'd ever had and I had many requests for the recipe. This is definitely the best banana pudding ever!!

I never would have thought to use so many bananas but it really made the texture better and made the overall taste wonderful.

This is the recipe my mother and I use, with the omission of the vanilla, which doesn't hurt a bit.  We also only use about 4 bananas. It is quick and easy and always brings rave reviews.

If you don't have time for a cooked banana pudding this is the recipe to use. My family is crazy about it, and we have made it many times. If it is too sweet for your taste, cut down on the condensed milk, I use banana cream pudding mix for extra flavor, and only about 7 or so bananas. I highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe. I have made this recipe several times. To cut down on the sweetness, I leave the condensed milk out. It is just as good with the sweetness of the whipped topping-and fewer calories also.

This recipe is the same my mom (single working mother) used to make for us as a treat and tastes exactly as I remember it. It is a welcome taste from my childhood and I wouldn't change a thing (except the number of bananas). For those of you complaining that it's too sweet...perhaps you should consider one of the other bzillion recipes out there that call for "fancier" ingredients. This one is simple, straight forward and sweet....you know...as desserts should be.

I didnt use even near the amount of bananas,  more like 5. Of course my bowl was smaller so didnt use all the pudding mixture either. 
This is a delicious banana pudding!

I made this with instant vanilla and banana pudding, no sweetened condensed milk, I didn't want the pudding to be too sweet. Added four cups milk half a container of light whip cream mixed in.  I only used five bananas and almost all of one box of wafers.  I put remainder of whip cream, plus half of another container on top with whole wafers .  It was a hit at church today.

Made this for my mother's 70th birthday while my Miami chef brother was visiting. We are from GA and have lived here our whole lives. They loved it -- not to mention my picky 9-year old. The fact that it was no bake is what REALLY makes this recipe 5-stars. You can't beat not having to bake it for hours. Priceless!

Perhaps too much milk is being used in this recipe. The pudding turned out super watery and didn’t thicken up. I will not Use this recipe again. Wasted all these ingredients because it was soup.

It turned out perfect! This reminds me of what I used to eat as a child. I prep it the day before an event so everything has time to marry and blend, the cookies soften and everyone absolutely loves it!

It was great. I only used half the condensed milk and half the vanilla to cut it from being overly sweet.

Best banana pudding as they say and you can only eat one as it’s very filling - made it for my work where we were collecting money for fundraising. The pudding sold out before the brisket sandwiches

I made this recipe with Chessmen cookies, so delish!
Also, I took note regarding the condensed milk and cut that in half. I also only chopped 4 bananas...that was more than enough.

, it's a pretty basic recipe, and turned out as expected. I'm personally not a fan of instant pudding but if you're in a time crunch, it's fine. Summertime staple dessert in the South!! :)

At first I was thinking wow that’s a lot of bananas. But it is indeed the correct amount of bananas combined with the other ingredients. I am in LOVE with the texture and flavor! This is by far the best banana pudding I have ever had. It has the perfect flavor - not too sweet, not overly rich, and perfectly light and fluffy filling consistency.

Okay. My honest opinion? I Just made this recipe,  "The Best Banana Pudding."  I followed it exactly as the recipe said. My beef is that it calls for 1 full tablespoon of vanilla extract. It has a horrible chemical flavor, due to that amount of extract. It was overpowering in this recipe. The next batch I made, I only used 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and it was perfect. No chemical taste. I also made a substitution. I used real unsweetened whipping cream instead of the frozen whipped topping. It made it creamier, and reduced the overall amount of sugar in the recipe, but still is very sweet for my liking.

I used heavy whipping cream and whipped up 12 oz of the stuff. It tasted so good and helped drown out the over powering taste of banana flavoring coming from the mix. The number of bananas was really high, I only used 4 for a full batch.

Made a mistake at grocery store by picking up a can of condensed coconut milk...used it in the recipe anyway  and what an nice flavor!

Now make this regularly and always use the coconut version.

This is a good recipe. The only thing I did different was use the Cook & Serve vanilla pudding mix. I cooked the pudding as it says on the box and let it cool then I mixed in the whipped cream and condensed milk in a large bowl.

I made this recipe for a family reunion and it was very good, but I made some changes based on other reviews.  I used 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 container of 8 oz Cool Whip, 4-5 bananas, and almost a whole 11 oz. box of vanilla wafers.  I think next time I will try real whipped cream in place of the Cool Whip.

14 bananas! I used 5, and it was plenty. A little sweeter than I prefer, but I would adjust the recipe next time.

No I didnt change anything but I will make it again with less cool whip in the pudding.  I tasted more whipped cream than bananas.  This is a favorite of my family growing up and I think my moms banana pudding is the absolute best! This was a good 2nd.  When I make it again with less whipped cream I will post.

14 bananas is way too much! You only need about 2. I would skip the condensed sweet milk and use regular milk. Other than those changes it was a good traditional banana pudding

I used 1/2 sugar free cool whip and 1/2 other cool whip and only used 1/2 the condensed milk it called for and increased the milk by the the 1/2 can of condensed milk to make up for the shortage.  It was a huge hit. WOW!  I was a rock star!

I used heavy whipping cream instead of frozen whip cream. 
I added a graham cracker crust on the bottom and in between each layer. I made banana and vanilla pudding and mixed them together to give it a richer flavor. Instead of regular milk I used heavy whipping cream to mix the pudding.

This was the same recipe my Mom had for her banana pudding. It's always been a huge favorite of all of our family get together soon. I won't make it any other way!

This was my first time making a banana pudding.  I am not ready for the bake kind like my father makes.  But, this recipe was simple, fun and delicious.  I took the advice of others and cut the whipped topping and condensed milk in half.  The pudding still came out smooth, tasty and just sweet enough for us to know it was a sweet treat.  I only used 5 bananas.

I didn’t layer the Nilla wafers and bananas on the side of the bowl for the aesthetic, mainly because I didn’t watch the video first. So mine’s not as pretty, but can’t wait to try it tomorrow!

I actually added 1 more cup of milk because it was way too sweet. I was kinda worried about the consistency afterwards but it turned out nice but it still was a tad too sweet

The flavor was good, but it didn't set up. It was the consistency of soup. Not sure what happened, but when I sliced sixteen bananas as the recipe said, there were too many. Perhaps a misprint in the ingredients? It might have set up if I used two 5 oz boxes of pudding?

Made it twice same drippy consistency never again. Second time let it sit in the fridge to set Christmas Eve dessert and the bananas sink to the bottom and the cookies want to float to the top it is a disaster.

This recipe is perfect for my needs. It compares with scratch banana puddings with less work!  It's requested at every holiday...I only wish I knew how to adjust the recipe for larger servings.

My guests loved this dessert on Thanksgiving. I am not a fan of instant pudding. I question how you could possibly use 14 bananas unless you were doubling or even tripling the recipe. I managed to use 6.

Leave out the vanilla extract. It makes it too sweet. And run the bananas through lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown. Don’t worry you won’t taste the lemon juice.

I didn't put whipped topping on the top layer, i just topped it off with some crushed pecans / nuts and wafers on top, 
I tried it the first time with whipped topping on top, and it took away from the pudding, second time i did it without it on top and it came out perfect.

The best one yet! I love the texture, it's light and fluffy not thick and goupy like others. I've made this at least a dozen times but have recently cut down on the sweetened condensed milk since my sweet tooth has lessened over the years.

I only used about 10 bananas and a 16oz container of cool whip! Other than that, great.

We do not like vanilla wafers in banana pudding,  I just layer the pudding with bananas. I also only use 6 bananas and the big 16 oz tub of Cool Whip. Fantastic! You can also add a block of softened cream cheese- richer and delicious that way, too.

This was a big disappointment.  It was way too sweet and too heavy.  I'm going to try making it with the regular recipe on the pudding package and just adding the whipped topping.

Made this "nana puddin" as it is written.  The southerners said it was the best they have had in a long time.  This will be a "go-to" recipe since it will be requested frequently.  Thank you.

Easy and excellent!! What more can you ask for? We liked it as much as, or maybe more so, than our old-fashioned, made from scratch, family recipe. Note: I only used 3 bananas, rather than what the recipe calls for as I think that was a typo or something. Also, I used a 10" x 13" x 3" glass dish and it made a nice, large, delicious dessert!!

Very rich and very good!  My mother said it was best banana pudding she ever had!  It tastes like a cross between banana cream pie and banana pudding. Only thing I did differently is crush the cookies and put the crumbs on top and in middle and on bottomThank you!!!!

Really liked this recipe, but put half of the sweetened condensed milk in it.  Layered it with bananas on the bottom, then pudding, then wafers, then pudding, then bananas on the top in a square baking dish.  We used 5-6 bananas.

Even just using half the can of condensed milk, this was just way too sweet for me, but it does taste more like old fashioned, non-instant pudding. I think maybe the key to cut the sweet is to use whipping cream without sugar as others have stated. Also, 4-5 bananas was plenty for this.

Too sweet and plastic tasting. Much prefer the reipe on the vanilla wafer box. More labor intensive? Yes, but pouring the warm custard over the cookies and bananas brings out the natural banana flavor.

I've made this too many times to count and it has never disappointed the crowd and there is NEVER any left over.  I follow the listed recipe exactly.  It's easy.  Inexpensive.  And it makes a beautiful presentation in a glass trifle bowl.

This is a great recipe! It was a huge hit the first time I made it.. So a few days later I tripled the recipe!!! It's so thick and creamy..and you can vary the amount of bananas according to your family's taste.. And one batch... I crushed the wafers and layered them..just a fun change.. But this really is the BEST banana pudding! Just remember.. It'll go fast!!

I made this for the first time. We have looked for years after we lost my "Great Grandmother 's " recipe.  I will say the best i ever found, i would say better then my old recipe. We did not change a thing, looked and tasted as we hoped. 
Made it for Easter, my guest loved it.
I will make tis for every family gathering

I followed the recipe but my container was too small to use all of the ingredients. Still, it made plenty to share! I may add some nutmeg or something next time to tweak the flavor, but it was good as it is!

Hands down, this is the best no bake banana pudding recipe ever. Since thanksgiving I have made about 5 batches.  Everybody is hooked... family, coworkers, church members.. even folks who claim they don't eat banana pudding.. I use sugar free boxed pudding and half the sweet condensed milk to cut down on the sweetness!!!  Awesome recipe

I have never eaten banana pudding simply because I'm not as fond of bananas. However, I made this receipe for Thanksgiving for the first time and my husband was totally in love with it. He told me to make it this way and not to deviate.  This was such a hit and if I have to say so myself it was the bomb. I will definitely make this again and even tweek it and add Pepperidge Farm Chessman Cookies for the top layer for the presentation of the Banana Pudding. 
Thanks so much for giving this receipe.

I LOVE this recipe!!!! So easy and a perfect alternative to the meringue and from scratch pudding, which has always been my fave. 

For this, I used half the can of evaporated milk for each 5 ounce pudding mix, (I added a second pudding). I also added a layer, but my next layer, I scattered the vanilla wafers more thinly out so there were abut a third as many. Then topped w a thin layer of cool whip. To die for!

Great banana pudding recipe! I used banana flavored pudding mix and only 5 bananas and it was delicious.

We made this as our first attempt at making banana pudding. We wanted to add some creativity to the plan. We added some lemon zest and lemon juice. Not too much but that's all it took. Maybe a tablespoon of juice and a teaspoon of zest. mixed in just before combining the bananas and wafers.

I loved this recipe! Got it from a friend. Since I and most of my family are diabetic, I substituted sugar free pudding and lite whipped cream. It's definitely not sugar free but it cuts out a lot of the sugar.

Great recipe. This was just what my DH asked for! He gives it 5 stars and I say 4. It was a tad too sweet for me. I did make a couple of changes. I only used half a can of condensed milk and subbed with 4 or 5 oz green yogurt to cut a little sweetness, I used only 3/4 of the container of whipped topping and only 6 bananas. It turned out light and fluffy. This is one I'll use again and again.

Really good. This is my go-to banana pudding recipe. So easy. I don't use bananas because my family doesn't like them (and they turn brown). I use only half a can of sweetened condensed milk. This is delish.

This is the best banana pudding I've ever tasted!! I've made it for potlucks at work and that's what they assign me to make each time because they loved it. My family members love it too! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, now I can't live without it.

I've made this several times and it was a hit!  I didn't add so many bananas but made it exactly the same otherwise.  I didn't know how to "fold" the whipped topping in, so I just stirred it in.  Tasted delicious so my method worked.  hahaha

I made this for my family awhile back. It was something entirely new and out of the norm, for me, when it comes to desserts. My family loved it. My youngest son keeps asking for me to make it again. Very simple and a classic taste in my opinion!!

I have made this many times, it's always a big hit! My best hint here is put your sliced bananas in a plastic bag and coat with lemon juice, it helps keep them from turning and adds a great tart flavor!

Made this for the first time tonight and I added some strawberries along with the bananas. It came out really good- but it was incredibly sweet. I think I will take one of the other rater's suggestions and use fresh, unsweetened whipped cream instead of the cool whip next time I make this.

This was a really good dessert. I absolutely love banana  pudding. This was a really good recipe. My partner ate so much of it and was asking when I'll make it again.  Definitely  don't need 14 bananas; buying one bunch of bananas will work.  Other than that it was amazing. I didn't think it was to sweet. It's a dessert it's supposed to be sweet.

I will make again. It's delicious! And I'm not a big fan of bananas. Not too sweet like other reviewers. What I changed: I used 5 bananas & that was plenty, 2 12 oz boxes of wafers- bc I really like them (I used most, but not all of them) 2% milk & only the 8oz cool whip container.

I made this recipe many years ago and it was a true hit! I found this recipe and tried it for Thanksgiving. I replaced vanilla wafers with Chessman cookies. I replaced vanilla extract with almond extract. I only had an 8 oz. container of frozen whipped topping, but I think it was enough. And I only used 5 bananas. 14 would've been way too many. This recipe is heavenly! Everyone loved it. I will make it again and again. Two thumbs up!

So this is pretty good, but indeed very sweet. My guess is that eliminating the condensed milk would make it a bit less intense. I also think it would be quite easy to use low-fat or even sugar free ingredients. I used light cool whip, 1% milk, and probably could have used a low-fat condensed milk. A few weird things. First, it calls for a 10 oz tub of whip, which ... doesn't exist? I used 8 oz and it was fine. Second, I only 4 bananas. I used a banana pudding instead of vanilla, which my son insisted on and it's actually decent.

This banana pudding is wonderful and reminds me of the dish my mom makes.  I loved the sweetness of the pudding and would not change a thing.  My 5 star rating is based on the recipe exactly as written, except that, like many people have noted, the 14 bananas is clearly a typo.  4-5 bananas should be enough.  

If I ever get into the mood to experiment, I might try using cook and serve pudding or french vanilla pudding.

I have made this recipe for banana pudding four times now & I've had nothing but compliments on it. One friend said it was one of his top three favorite desserts he's ever had and he even dreamed about it! It's a keeper - quick & easy to make and friends request it!

I used only 6 bananas which for me was more than enough, I think 14 bananas would have been way extra.  Besides that,  I followed the recipe and also added pecan pieces on top.  Not staying around long!

Tastes Wonderful! The pudding has a creamy vanilla flavor! If you like a little less vanilla flavor, cut down on the vanilla extract to 1/2 tbs. The whipped topping makes it fabulous! I added a container of whipped topping to the top because I love whipped topping!

This is one of the best banana puddings I've ever had.  I made the following changes:  I substituted cook and serve pudding, which I made the night before, using 1 3oz box each of vanilla and banana cream pudding.  I also used fewer bananas, but still enough to make nice thick layers.  It all fit perfectly into a 3qt container.  Allowing the finished product to refrigerate for about 6 hours softened the vanilla wafers perfectly. I will be making this recipe again for sure!

I consider myself a Banana Pudding expert since I have tried many different recipes because I love Banana Pudding.  I have had many amazing recipes throughout my (not so long) life; however, I honestly believe this is one of the best recipes I have found for Banana Pudding.  All my friends and family rave over this recipe and want me to keep on making it again and again.

I did make some changes, however, to the recipe posted on here.  I made some of these changes based upon the other reviews for this recipe.  I think the measurements on here are too much.  I use half of the can of Sweetened Condensed Milk instead.  I also use around 2 tsp of Vanilla Extract.  However, on those two ingredients, I add more of each until I get the flavor just right; so you will have to adjust to your taste.  I also use the 8oz cool whip tub instead of the 12oz.  

Make a double batch, because one is just not enough ;).  Enjoy!

I followed ALL directions, tasting as I went and it was very liquid. I added a little bit extra pudding mix to batch towards end. It came out great!
BTW, 14 bananas was too many, my kids helped by eating some and I frze the rest for banana bread. 
Thank you for a starter recipe!

In my opinion a homemade pudding custard is worth the extra 10 to 15 minutes  to prepare in terms of flavor.. Packaged pudding mix tastes fake to me, especially  instant. But, hey, I get why some people make that choice. I was raised in the South, where meringue topping is traditional. I like to use Trader Joe's Vanilla Wafers. Enjoy your "Naner Puddin!"

Delicious and SO easy.

I gotta a say, we cut way back on the bananas (we used 6) b/c we didn't have enough on hand.  It was still super banana-y - I can't imagine using 14.  It's also very (overly) sweet, but that means I can't eat the whole recipe in one sitting, which I guess is a good thing.

This came out perfect, my whole family even the kiddos loved it. Only changed the 14 bananas to 7. Depending on the container you are putting it in seven works just fine.

Many reviews said it was a little sweet. So I used a pint of whipping cream and no added sugar in place of the frozen whipped topping,which is sweet and it turned out just right..Everyone wanted seconds...delicious....CORRECTION 1/2 PINT OF WHIPPING CREAM 8 OZ.,ALSO USED 4 BANANAS.

I didn't use whip cream and it still came out super sweet. I love it but it's just too sweet. Do you really need sweetened condensed milk to make banana pudding?

This is awesome! I never thought the cookies would be softened with instant pudding. I changed one thing..I never have cool whip, so I mixed up a package of dream whip instead. This turned out great. THANKS!

I loved this and the ease of preparation.  However, that being said, next time, I plan to use a little less of the condensed milk and a little more cool whip to make it fluffier and lighter.

Yes I prepared this for my son's birthday request for his birthday desert. I strongly urge visitors to read the very helpful  reviews to tweak the recipe.I used only half of the condensed milk and it was still more than sweet enough for our tasted.Really liked mixing the cool whip with the pudding and the condensed milk.Delicious and extremely easy!

This recipe was easy and I like the few ingredients. But for me it was too sweet. Way to sweet I can barley eat more than a few bites. Next time I will use half of the condensed milk. Also it did not have enough banana flavor. Why not use banana flavor pudding? Would it be too much banana?! I'm new to making this but I will experiment with this and make it perfect. Will update next time I make this.

Everyone who tastes this says to me "this is the best Banana Pudding I've EVER had!" If you are making it for a huge crowd, multiply the recipe by 5 and use one of the extra large aluminum pans. It fits perfect. I will say that the recipe calls for A LOT more bananas than I think it needs. I use about half, and it still has a ton in every bite. I also drizzle just a few drops of milk over each layer of wafers, to keep them from being so crunchy. It makes the wafer layer a little more cakey. So delicious! And one last thing, I use about 75% of the amount of cool whip that is calls for, otherwise it looses too much of the flavor of the pudding. 
   Those are my suggestions for this recipe, but of course, it would be great even if you made no changes.

This is basically the recipe I have used for years. I prefer to use fresh whipped cream, however, instead of cool whip. Also, I can't imagine using 14 bananas. I think I use 6 at the most. And, the more cookies the better! Always come home with an empty bowl!

My husband really loves this recipe... I did add the cream cheese and cut the whipped cream back a bit.... It was so easy... I had an epic fail on my first attempt at banana pudding... Try this recipe.... I will be bringing this to future cookouts and family gatherings....

Best EVER! Rave Reviews!! I can make banana pudding, but I wanted to try a recipe for once.  I made this exactly as called for.  My powder pudding box was a bit off, but I made it according to package directions.  I can't remember how many bananas I used - it was basically personal preference more then anything.  My mom raved about how good it was and I thought it was the BOMB!  This is now my go to recipe for banana pudding.  I didn't have sweetened condensed milk, but I did have the Hispanic equivalent Dulce de Leche.  It worked fine and like I said, this is now my go to recipe for banana pudding.  AWESOME!!

Waaaaay too sweet. The can of condensed milk is unnecessary. I think the measurements are off too. There is no way this recipe should call for 14 bananas. This is the first banana pudding I've ever made.  I will not use this recipe again.  After eating a small serving, it is sitting heavy in my tummy.

I felt the instant pudding could be left out and instead make a egg custard sauce, which is so easy and add the rest. If your making homemade, you don't want to add something instant to it. I didn't use the instant pudding but make mine own sauce.

I've used this recipe for years.  My son wants it on his birthday instead of a birthday cake.  However, instead of bananas, I use frozen strawberries to make a scrumptious strawberry pudding.  I use a little of the strawberry juice mixed in with the condensed milk for more flavor, and I drizzle strawberry juice on top along with a few sliced strawberries.  People love it!

I normally only like banana pudding from scratch. This recipe is the best instant banana pudding I've tried. I substituted the vanilla pudding for banana cream. I will definitely make this again.

This banana pudding is VERY rich...and well received by everyone!  I often replace the nilla wafers with Nutter Butters...this takes any banana pudding recipe up a notch and I've had true Southerners tell me that it's the best they've ever had!

This is by far the best and easiest banana pudding I have ever made!  My family asks me to make it every time we have a cook out.  I do use a lot of the cookies and a few less bananas than it calls for, but otherwise I follow the recipe.  I have also used lowfat ingredients and it turns out just as good.

This was excellent! I used 2 small boxes of pudding (3.4oz) and 3 cups skim milk. I accidentally used only a tsp of vanilla instead of a tbsp, but it still tasted great! And I only used 4 large bananas, I can't imagine needing 14! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This tasted incredible!!!  But I had to give it 4 stars because it wasn't right on the number of bananas.  I used six.  Also, I used the sugar free pudding mix (1.5 oz box) which was comparable in serving size to the 5 oz. box the recipe calls for.

This was really good! Only thing I would do differently next time is cut back on the condensed milk because this was REALLY sweet. I love my desserts rich, but this was a bit much even for me!

Yum!  I'm not a big banana pudding fan, but I think it's because of the way it was made when I was a kid, living in the north. Now that I live in the south, I HAD to learn to like it, so I attempted a few different recipes. This one is the winner, in my mind. I didn't think it was "too sweet" as others stated.  I halved this recipe for a smaller crowd, and I used only 3 large bananas, which was just fine.  It has a nice, light, fluffy texture.  Will continue to make!

It was good.  Very sweet.  I would use banana pudding next time as this didnt have a very strong banana flavor.  14 bananas?  I could only fit 5, I'm not sure where the rest were supposed to go.

Very good. Hubby and I thought it was tasty. I used skim milk, 8 oz light cool whip, 4 bananas, and only 1/4 can of the condensed milk. Whole can of condensed milk would have been too sweet.

i liked it and everyone else enjoyed it, but i'm not sure it was anything special.  i followed the directions exactly (but with 4 very large bananas). put it together in a 13x9 pan.  roughly crushed nilla wafers on the bottom, layer of bananas, layer of pudding, topped with a bit of crushed wafers.  very good, thank you!

I like sweet, but this was a little too sweet.  I was hesitant about adding the sweetened condensed milk, but thought that if it got such high ratings, it must be good.  I shouldn't have.  The flavor was great, but I ended up with sugar shock.

DELICIOUS!! I only used half a can of the sweetened condensed milk, and I used cook 'n serve pudding instead of the instant. It was by far the best banana pudding I've ever had, and my boyfriend loved it too. I will definitely keep this in my recipe box and make it over and over!

I took this to a family gathering, and every last bit of it dissapeared.  People raved about it.  Great, easy recipe.

My family absolutely loved this. This was quick and easy to make and is perfect for the summer. I made a few adjustments: instead of 1 package of pudding mix, I used 2 and I used 2 boxes of Nilla wafers. I will definately make again.

this really lives up to its name!  i had this for the first time at a rehearsal dinner and just could not get enough of it.  i found this recipe, decided to give it a try and i am really glad i did!  i used about 9 or 10 bananas as well, as 14 did seem like too many

This recipe didn't make me want to "slap my momma", but it DID make me want to run down the street screaming about how good it was. The "14 bananas" thing had to be a typo, I only used about 3 1/2 reg. sized ones. I had leftover pudding mixture that I ate by itself after I ran out of everything else! Fantastically easy and ridiculously good recipe. Thank you!

Have made twice, the second with fat free condensed milk, fat free cool whip.  It seemed sweeter than with the reg. condensed milk.  Only used about 8 oz of the cool whip.  Very easy to eat.

I loved this but if I make this again I will crumble the vanilla wafers.  If not, it would have to sit for a long time for the wafers to get moist and not be crunchy.  I did like this though.

Being from the north, I had never made banana pudding before. I made this recipe for a neighborhood party here in the south, and all of my neighbors said that it was the best they ever had! They raved about it and said I am officially a southerner!! Very easy to make and absolutely delicious as is. I made it the night before to give the wafers a chance to get soft. I will definately be using this recipe again.

Very Tasty.
A bit too sweet for me, so next time I will omit the whipped topping.
Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe this weekend and it was met with rave reviews at the carry-in I took it to.  It's so easy and so delicious.  It was a hit and will be made many times in my kitchen.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there may be some typos in the recipe.  I did not add 14 bananas but added 4 instead.  I also followed the pudding instructions and put in three cups of milk.  The second time I made the recipe (that's right I made it twice in three days!) I only added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and liked that better. 

Great recipe though!

This recipe was delicious!! I  only used 4 bananas also. I thought the sweetened condensed milk would make it too sweet, but I was wrong, it made  it rich and creamy.  Better than another recipe I've made with just vanilla pudding.

This is exactly the recipe my mother makes and unless she makes a double recipe there are never any leftovers.  I am pretty sure the 14 bananas is a typo, I dont think she uses more than 3.

Very good . . . and easy!  I forgot to layer the cool whip topping in between, but it was good even without it.  I just put it on top.  It does take away from the pudding flavor a bit, so I'm not sure I'd add it even when making it again.  I used no fat sweetened condensed milk and it worked just fine too.

Easy and quick.  I use French vanilla pudding as well as French Vanilla Cool Whip, gives it a rich creamy taste.  Also, use double the vanilla wafers. By the way,  the 14 bananas must be a misprint.

I have made a version of this recipe before using these exact ingridients with great results.  However after two attempts at this recipe I ended up with a lumpy glue like mess.  I'm sure it had to be something I did wrong because everyone else seemed to have great results.  I tried a similar recipe on this site two nights later with fantastic results so who knows!

This banana pudding was a hit with everyone from age 2 to age 84.  Even my grandmother (of the old-school cooked custard method of banana pudding) loved it.  It was even better the next day!

This was a very good and easy recipe for banana pudding. Will make this one again.I used half of the sweetend condensed milk and it was still sweet and very creamy.

I personally can not stand banana pudding. It feels weird in my mouth..its a texture thing. My wife on the other hand LOVES the stuff. So, I tried this recipe out and she went crazy over it. Says its the best she's had in a long long time. Could be b/c she's the only one in a house of 4 that even likes it but......she says its great.

Overall pretty yummy, nice thick consistancy, very rich, but way too sweet for myself (and friends agreed). The condensed milk is what I think makes it go overboard? If a rich sugary desert is your liking, then this one is a gooder.

This was a delicious and easy banana pudding.  I added one 8 oz can of crushed pineapple to my first layer of bananas, which is minimally detectable and gives the pudding a nice depth of flavor.  My family had this packed away in no time.

Fantastic!  This is definately something I'll make over and over again.  Yes, it was sweet but isn't that what a dessert is supposed to be? :)  Thanks for the great recipe!
