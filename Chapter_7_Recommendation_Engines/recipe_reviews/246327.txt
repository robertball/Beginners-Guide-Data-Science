Really, really good. A nice change from regular pizza, and a delicious new way to use squash. Killer fall dinner!

This recipe is good as is, but don't be afraid to mix things up!  I made my own crust.  Made 1/2 the flat bread as the recipe stated and the other 1/2 I added Capicola ham,  broccoli leaf and goat cheese. YUM!  The salty sweet combo was great.

I would rather have this type of pizza than a traditional pizza with red sauce and heavy toppings, so, this was right up my alley!  I bought pizza dough from my local pizza parlor and it was enough to make a large pizza. (Most independent pizza places will sell you pizza dough.  I pay a little over two dollars for a large ball of fresh dough.)  I did one half exactly as the recipe stated and I did one half with the same toppings, but, layered ricotta and fresh garlic on the crust before adding the toppings to bake, so, it was like a "white pizza" with the butternut squash and onion.  The recipe as written was very good, but, I think I preferred the side that I had added ricotta.   I do think with the sweetness you get from the butternut squash something fresh sprinkled on top before eating it like arugula or cilantro would have been wonderful.

This was good but needs a little more seasoning in the flavor department.  Maybe a little chopped sage and a drizzle of garlic olive oil before serving would set this over the top.

The flavor in this was nice.  I did saut√© the onions with a little butter, salt, and pepper.  I added some balsamic at the end.  If I were to make this again it think I would mash the squash and use it as a "sauce" on the flatbread rather than cubing it.
