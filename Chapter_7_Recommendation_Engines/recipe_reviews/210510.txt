Really interesting dish. The coconut flake added at the end really makes it awesome. I suggest more oil in the bottom of the pan (I have stainless steel and it kept sticking). Would also suggest not putting the beet and potato into water prior to cooking, it makes the browning process very hard. Delicious overall though.

We liked the flavor of this dish, but I suggest that you double cumin and mustard seeds, because the spice flavor is a little subtle. The coconut gives an extra kick and makes the flavor a little unusual. As the previous reviewer, I think it is not necessary to put beets and potatoes in the water, because when you put the vegetables to the skillet, the mixture splutters very much. If necessary, add water when you simmer the vegetables. I think that the cooking time is a little wrong here, because if you put beets along with potatoes, you will get overcooked potatoes and uncooked beets. So I suggest that you cut beets thiner than potatoes, fry and simmer it a little first, then add potatoes. Overall, this is a good and cheap meal and a tasty way to eat more beets.

This was really tasty, the peppers I used made it a little too hot, but it went down well with a glass of milk. I didn't have fresh curry leaves so I used a little curry powder, otherwise I followed the recipe as written because I'm a complete novice with Indian food. I will make this again.

YES; didnt know beetroot was actually so sweet. This tastes WONDERFUL. I didnt have all the spices, so cumin powder with a little green masala paste and curry powder fried up in clarified butter I used. Served it with black beluga lentils and basmati rice - looked great too, the red with the black. Yummy!

skipped urad dal- skinned black lentil couldn't find.  1/2 tsp = 4 lentils.  Unrsure if this is a typo on the original.   Loved beets with the coconut.  Slightly dry- if  remake would try to have a "gravy"
