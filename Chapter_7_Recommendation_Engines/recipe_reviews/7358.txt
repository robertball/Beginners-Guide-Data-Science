This is a great blueberry cake.  I made mine in a tube pan and with frozen blueberries that I had picked from my bushes earlier this summer.  I sprinkled the top with sugar in the raw which are large crystals so it gave it a nice sparkle.

I have made several blueberry cakes this summer, because the market had them on sale for $0.99.  This is definitely one of the best!  A wonderful, really moist cake.  I used a full pint of blueberries and substituted margarine for the butter and it worked just fine.  I like the taste of vanilla, so I doubled the amount called for.  I also threw in a dash.....and I do mean a DASH of cinammon simply based upon personal preferance.  Thanks for the recipe Irene!

This was delicious! It was incredibly moist! I was a bit worried when I was mixing the ingredients, because the dough seemed really thick, but it turned out lovely!

I wanted something tasty to make with the blueberries I had.  This recipe was just three stars in my opinion.  First of all, it's a lot of work to make with many different steps and dishes used.  Secondly, when it was done and I tried some, it didn't taste as good as I expected.  It wasn't bad, but tasted like something I could have gotten from a mix.  It was moist, but the cake is not very flavorful. I don't think the blueberries make up much for what the cake seems to lack. (I had cream cheese frosting in my pantry, so I added some to the top to see if it would taste better.  It didn't help, and added an odd flavor.)

This is a very good cake but it does taste like a blueberry muffin.  The batter is really thick so don't be alarmed when you make it.  Next time I will add cream cheese frosting.

This cake is wonderful! For people who think it tastes like a mix: good! It's always nice when you can find a recipe that uses ingredients that are identifiable but can stand up to a grocery store product. If you like mixes better then go ahead and enjoy your high fructose corn syrup. 
I added a little extra vanilla just to enhance the flavor and doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 cake, otherwise nothing was altered. One word of caution: the batter will be very thick so care should be taken when adding the blueberries and egg whites so as not to bruise the berries. This cake is very moist and not overbearingly sweet - much better than a mix! This would also make lovely muffins. Thank you so much Irene, this is definitely a new favorite!

Instead of the 1/4 cup of sugar make it 1/2 cup and you won't be sorry! I made two cakes at the beginning and my husband said it wasn't sweet enough. I gave the recipe to my sister in-law and she added the extra sugar and everyone at her work wanted the recipe. She also brought it to a gathering and they also wanted the recipe. The best recipe for blueberry cake I've had and I have tried many.

Even though I coated the blueberries with flour, they still sunk!! It turned out good - my whole family liked it, but I agree that aside from the delicious fresh blueberries, the taste was similar to a mix.

My family loved this recipe and are asking me to make it again already (less than a week later!) Nice and moist and kept well over the 4th of July weekend.

i'm a relatively harsh recipe critic.  but i must say - this was FANTASTIC.  funny story - i spent nearly $20 on this cake (my baking supplies were horribly limited, lol).  beautiful, fresh blueberries.  real butter.  the prettiest cake i've ever seen in my life.  i took it out of the oven..proudly carried it to the counter...my cat spooked me...i jumped, and the ENTIRE cake came flying out of the dish onto the countertop, smashing into pieces.  lol.  i had just sterilized my counter from baking so i stood there contemplating whether we should still eat it.  haha.  we did.  i turned it into blueberry 'crumble'.  i'd make it again, ten times over, and i plan to share it with everyone i know.  your mom is a genius!

Delicious! -  tender, moist, flavorful, and just sweet enough.  It looks pretty too.  I made this recipe just as directed (it takes less 30 minutes to prep - more like 15 minutes) and I would not change a thing.  Tips:  Beat the eggs whites first and set them aside.  Use the same bowl (without bothering to clean it) to cream the butter, sugar and egg yolks and make the batter.  Be careful that all of the blueberries are intact (not too soft or crushed) so that blue streaking is not created when the berries and egg whites are folded into the batter.

I am giving it a 4 because without the changes I made, I don't think it would have been as yummy. I added a heaping handful of brown sugar to the butter/sugar mix..added extra vanilla and a dash of almond extract (totally transformed the flavor of the cake in my opinion) , and also added a few splashes of half and half bc I didnt want the cake to be too dry. I used frozen blueberries and just let them sit in cool water for a while and patted them dry before adding the flour.  The cake is SO yummy, especially after adding a little cinnamon to the sugar topping. It created this delicious hard shell on the top. I have a feeling this cake will be even yummier tomorrow!!

With high altitude adjustments, this turned out perfectly even though I didn't bother beating the egg whites or adding mixtures slowly.

Didn't have a cake pan on hand, so we divided this into twelve muffin tins. They were more like cakes than muffins, which I was so glad for. Very dense and didn't rise much. Loved them, and definitely loved the blueberries.

Made two cakes. One exactly as the recipe states except we folded the blueberries in last, after the egg whites so they wouldn't fall to the bottom of the batter. We also made a little crumb topping. It turned out wonderful. The second cake we substituted raspberries for the blueberries, again folding them in last. And for this version we made a simple lemon zest icing which we spread over the cake once it was on the cooling rack. Then allowed the cake to fully cool and icing to set before cutting it and digging in :) This batter works great for the slightly delicate raspberries as well as blueberries. Awesome Recipe!

Made this a couple of weeks ago and it was truly melt-in-your-mouth good.  I made the recipe as written with the exception of adding a pinch of cinnamon to the batter (personal preference), using a full pint of blueberries, and drizzling a glaze of confectioner's sugar, milk and lemon juice on top.  Thanks so much, IreneD, for this wonderful recipe.  It's a keeper.

This is a great recipe, and easy to make! Instead of just blueberries, I did half blueberries and half raspberries and it turned out fantastic. If you don't beat the egg whites quite so much, you can also make the best pancakes ever from this recipe :-)

AMAZING! The only thing different that I do is that I DOUBLE the recipe when I make it! I also add a lemon frosting that consists of powdered sugar, lemon juice, shredded lemon peel, and milk.

I followed the recipe as stated. The only difference was I added a pint of blueberries, which measured about 2 cups. I made a mistake which cost me 2egg whites. When you beat the egg whites, never add the sugar until the whites already formed peaks, otherwise the whites won`t beat, and you`ll end up with a liquid mixture. I had to discharge them and start all over again, separating eggs and keeping the egg yolks... Otherwise the cake is wonderful. I was hoping it would grow bigger, but my mom said it`s expected for only 1 and 1/2 cups of flour (whole-wheat:) ). The sugar on top made a nice crunchy crust.

This cake is incredible! Yes, it does require a little more time when preparing it, but it's completely worth the couple extra steps. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and cooked mine for about 45 minutes. Beautiful and moist. The flavor was just perfect, and the little bit of sugar on top added just the right amount of sweetness. If I could rate this more stars I would.. This one is definitely worth taking the time to make. Thank you IRENED for a very special recipe :)

We used this cake for a picnic & it was great. I thought it would be too much like a muffin but it was very light & fluffy. To make sure it was sweet enough I sugared the berries first.

I would rate this five stars.  I have made this recipe about four or five times already and it is my "go to" recipe when I have fresh blueberries in the house.  I made it in a rectangular baking dish, probably 9" x 11" or 8" x 11" and as soon as I took it out of the oven I pricked it with a fork and based a confectioner's sugar and lemon juice glaze over the whole thing.  Came out great every time!

I made this cake one day and had it the next. Very dry - will not make it again.  Followed the recipe the way it was written.  First time a recipe from this site wasn't good. This was my husband's birthday cake- thumbs down!!!!

Update- Do not put this cake in the frig. That is where I when wrong.  Took it out and left it set on the counter. Amazing!!!  Was moist and yummy.  I will make this again!!!

This is a keeper.  Reminds me of Jordan Marsh blueberry muffins.  The batter is very thick before the addition of the egg whites.  Prior to adding the berries I loosened the batter by mixing in 1/4 of the beaten egg whites.  Then I folded in the remainder of the beaten egg whites.  I didn't have a problem with the berries sinking.  I defrosted berries, patted mostly dry, sprinkled with flour before stirring into thinned batter.

Loved it!!  Was easy to make, a nice breakfast or brunch cake, not too sweet, moist, and the little crust that forms on top is great, its very pretty to serve.  I will say I did change only two things after reading the other reviews - I added an extra ripe banana to the batter (only because I had one to get rid of.)  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract, which I add to almost all of my cakes, breads, and muffins.  I had some leftover cream cheese frosting from another recipe, and we put a dab of that on top once it hit the plate.  We LOVED it.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Will add this to my box and surely make it again!

This was a fantastic blueberry cake; although not for those with a sweet tooth.  I made this for my mother in law's birthday party and both her and my husband loved it and have requested that I make it again.  I increased the amount of blueberries; just so that they would be spread abundantly through the cake.  I also finished it off with a Vanilla Glaze (the recipe is also on this website).  It was enjoyed by all.  It is more of a coffee cake than a cake texture; would also be really great for muffins.  I have more of a sweet tooth so the glaze was a must; but my husband and mother in law enjoyed it without the glaze; maybe with a bit of powdered sugar on top for decoration.  Great recipe and I will use it again!

I just made this cake and had to pry myself away from the counter for fear of eating it all by myself! Inspite of not separating the egg yolks from the whites, the cake turned out beautifully. I did double the recipe and used some extra blueberries. The only change I would make next time would be to try baking it in a springform pan because I had a hard time removing the cake from the nonstick pan I baked it in. Can't wait for my family to try it !!

Fantastic!  Very light cake and compliments blueberries very well.  Based on other reviews I did make a couple changes.  First, one review mentioned that it was a lot of work for an 8X8 size dish so I doubled the recipe and used my trusty 9X13.  Cook time was about the same and it rose just fine.  Second, I used twice as much vanilla as called for and a few extra blueberries, and I think this one change really added to the flavor level.  The only negative was that (maybe due to one of the changes) my berries did sink to the bottom during cooking, however, even with most of the berries on the bottom the cake cut nice and came together beautifully.

I love this cake! It was very moist and cooked perfectly... Yes it had a lot of steps but any great thing takes time. For those who had issues might have missed steps or tried to rush through this recipe because it wasn't bland it had great flavor and the blueberries did not sink to the bottom. I almost didn't make this cake because of a few bad reviews but my husband looked over the recipe and said it I should just try it and I'm glad I listened to him and so is he. He loves this cake too... Thanks for this recipe

This cake was excellent.  It is not too sweet and can be used for a breakfast cake.  The batter was a little thick and when I was folding the egg whites in I wondered if the amount of milk was in error but it turned out very good.

This recipe is too hard to make. The batter was so stiff that it took forever to add the milk and flour alternating. I was not using an electric mixer, instead doing it all by hand and my arm was really tired by the time I finally finished mixing. In addition, I used frozen blueberries. After I managed to get the blueberries mixed into the dough, the mixture stiffened so badly that the whipped egg white was impossible to incorporate. I believe you must have electric equipment to make this properly. I will never make this recipe again.

Good basic cake. Nice texture, doesn't need a topping or icing. After seeing a few reviews of the "blandness", I wanted to add an extra punch just in case. I replaced the 1/3 cup milk with 1/3 cup fresh orange juice, and added a teaspoon of orange zest. I followed most of the steps, but I didn't not whip the egg whites into peaks. Regardless, it turned out really well! Come to think of it, I could have replaced the vanilla with orange extract. I will be returning to this recipe.

This was a delicious cake.  I made it for my mom's birthday, and it was a huge hit.  I followed the directions exactly, but sprinkled a little bit of raw sugar on the top to give it a crunchy/sparkly texture.  Moist, sweet, and the blueberries were spread out and didn't all sink to the bottom.  I can't wait to make this again.

Absolutely the most flavorful blueberry muffins I have ever made. I used fresh blueberries right from my garden.  I took a batch of these muffins to work and they were all gone in less than 15 minutes. This is the number one request I get when it is my turn to bring a snack to work. Enjoy

Followed recipe as written. But had to use frozen berries. I suggest if using frozen berries that the whites be folded in before adding. Otherwise the batter is too stiff to fold in whites properly. Will make again but needs some sweetness. Will top with streusel next time. Had a nice texture and rose very well.

I have about 2 pounds of blueberries sitting in the freezer and I had no idea what to do with them, until I came across this recipe. The only change I made was the glaze on top. 1/4 cup of powder sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of milk, stir and drizzle on top of the cake. This cake is so goooooooooooood! It makes just enough. I can't wait to make another and share with more family and friends! :)

This cake is moist and very good. I love blueberries and since they are in season, I wanted to try making a fresh blueberry cake. This is the one. I did make a few changes after reading other reviewer's comments. I increased the milk to 1/2 cup, blueberries to 2 cups and added about 3/4 tsp. of lemon zest. It is really delicious, soft, tender crumb and moist.

THIS CAKE WAS GOOD, MORE LIKE A COFFEE CAKE OR SNACK CAKE THOUGH.  DO ADD SOME LEMON ZEST AS IT ADDS ALOT.

A-MAZING!! Moist and fluffy, the perfect combination.  Usually with muffins if it's moist then it'll be pretty dense, but this was light and fluffy.  Made a few changes though to make it extra good... whole milk instead and brown sugar in place of the white sugar when making the topping.  Just a note... you only need half the amount of topping that this directs you to make, so split that in half.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. The entire cake was gone! I did have to use a little more than a tablespoon to coat the blueberries, though. Will definitely make again!

a very delicious  cake with awesome density. Even though this cake is extremely filling, I suggest you double the recipe if you are feeding 6 or more people or if you want any leftovers. It was a little crumbly, I don't know if it was supposed to be that way, and a tiny tiny bit too sweet, but still awesome. Too bad I can't make it more often because blueberries are soo expensive.

This cake tasted nothing like a mix. Even though it was a little more work then the average cake it was well worth it. I've made it three time in three weeks and given it as gifts with rave reviews.

I absolutely loved this cake - it was melt in the mouth; light fluffy and moist all at once and extremely easy to make!!  In particular, the blueberries didn't sink to the bottom as they can do in some recipes - I have passed this to all my friends :-)

I think this is a very good cake. Nice and moist,fast and easy to make.  I used Saskatoon Berries, instead of Blueberries and it was great.
I also iced it with a Brown Sugar Icing. Awesome!
Thank-you Irene for the great recipe!  :)

I think what some reviewers are missing in this cake is cinnamon and some lemon juice. Add a 1/2 teaspoon or so cinnamon to the batter along with a Tablespoon of lemon juice and some lemon zest. It will really zing this recipe up!

It will only have a good taste if you get everything to the points that are stated "until fluffy", "until creamy", "beat until stiff peaks form", etc. If you want a sweater mixture, add more sugar, the sprinkled sugar adds a very nice soft sweetness to the cake, and if you want it sweeter, then just add some vanilla frosting on top :) It is perfect! and very good. :) I loooved this recipe

Not bad, but it needed...something. I added turbinado sugar on top before baking. I think it needs some lemon zest to "brighten" up the flavour a bit. I do like how subtly sweet it is though. Yum! Baked mine for 30min.

This recipe is a definite keepr.  I have made it both with dairy and dairy free and you can't even tell the difference.  Replace butter and milk with soy butter and soy milk and voila!!  I've also quadrupled the recipe with great success!!!  I love LOVE love this recipe!!

The cake is so soft and tender, and this is the person who over bakes everything. The only problem I had was that all the blueberries sank to the bottom.

This is one of the better blueberry cakes on this site and we love it except it does need some grated lemon rind to compliment the fruit.  The method (folding in the egg whites) gives it such a beautiful texture.   If the recipe is followed and properly beaten it never fails.  The only reason I rated it 4 is because it does need some extra flavoring, but again this is a matter of taste.

Excellent recipe....I followed exactly as written using fresh blueberries and the batter is absolutely beautiful. When the cake was done I did make a glaze to go on top made of powder sugar, milk & cinnamon, the glaze definitely makes the cake even better! Cinnamon in the batter enhances the flavor of the cake for sure. Overall the cake is moist and tender...Thanks so much and I will be making this again!

Truly melt-in-your-mouth!  I did change a few things:  I used one of my goose eggs instead of the chix eggs, I used frozen berries, and half and half b/c my milk was past the due date!  All in all, I ended up with a light, moist, fluffy cake that was just sweet enough.  I am not sure if the goose eggs changed the consistency - they tend to make baked goods fluffier and richer.  It was a little bowl-juggling as I only have one stand blender with one bowl to it, so read ahead and figure out how you're going to work your bowls - but I tell you, this recipe was worth a little extra time to make and is going in my book!  Thank you so much!

I loved this recipe.  I was surprised at how moist it was.  I used frozen blueberries and it worked great.  I added a little cinnamon to the batter and then I mixed cinnamon and brown sugar together and sprinkled it on the top of the cake before I baked it. It added just the right amount of sweetness to the cake!  My kids and husband loved it!

It is exactly what is described by others...a moist scrumptious huge muffin like blueberry cake.  The batter really did throw me off as I didn't let my blueberries completely thaw so the batter was even more thick.  I practically had to press it into the pan but it was very tasty and not dry at all once baked. My only complaint is it only makes an 8x8 pan and I only got two small pieces before it disappeared!

Love it! Used a pint of blueberries and put sugar on top. Took it out of the oven and let it cool just a bit, sliced in half, spread butter on it. It was AWESOME!

This has been a great summer for blueberry picking, and this cake is nice and light. So there are a couple more steps; well, that was really no biggie. I think folding the beaten egg whites into the batter makes for a light and fluffy consistency. I loved it, and so did the ravenous co-workers. Thanks!

Almost perfect, yet still deserves the perfect 5/5! The light texture is off-set by the berries and makes for a party hit! Try using other berries or a mix to create paradice in your mouth. Mmmm...

This is so easy and travels well.  It can be a little tart from the berries.  That's okay because it is even better when still warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream!  What a great use of blueberries!  Yum!

Delicious! My toddler requested a blueberry birthday cake, and I found this recipe. It tastes just like blueberry muffins and is not overly sweet (which is perfect). I made it exactly as written, though I added a full pint of blueberries per other reviews, and I needed it to be dairy free due to allergies. I used Earth Balance stick "butter" and coconut milk and baked in an 8x8 glass Pyrex. It was ready exactly 50 minutes after going into the oven. My toddler requested seconds! I'll definitely be making this again.

This batter was exceptionally stiff and did not want to incorporate the egg whites.  Next time I would put a little more milk.  We also added grated lemon rind which made it more interesting, and it was very moist and tasty.  We left off the extra sprinkling of sugar on top (it was completely unnecessary).  We also cooked it for 45 minutes instead of 50 - keeping it moist.

Def bland cake batter as written. I added blueberry extract to give it flavor, THEN the batter tasted like blueberry cake! Also, fold in the blueberries LAST, after the egg whites have been folded in. For those who don't know: when beating egg whites, you must use clean, grease-free beaters, and either a glass or metal bowl that is grease-free, and never a plastic bowl. The smallest amount of grease (butter, etc.) will keep the eggs from peaking correctly. Once it was done with the addition of blueberry extract (which I found at a farmers market) it was delicious.

This was great. We had picked fresh blueberries in the morning whilst on vacation in Michigan. Made cake in the afternoon. I quadrupled the recipe, but substituted almond extract for the vanilla. I used turbinado sugar on top and the end result was a cross between an angel food cake and a blueberry muffin. Delicious!

This is a decent base recipe for blueberry cake, although like some other reviewers have said it's a little bland as-is.  I added about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and the zest of a whole lemon, and I'm VERY glad I did - I think the cake would have been utterly boring without it.  Blueberry and lemon nice complementary flavors.  Next time I would add a lemon-sugar glaze on top before baking for a little extra sweetness and texture.  I might also add a bit of sour cream to the batter for added smoothness and to enhance the lemony flavor.

This cake recipe is very moist - "chewy" in a good way.  It's also not overly-sweet, which I like in a dessert (I can pretend that it's healthy).  I'd advise bakers to check this cake at 40 minutes, especially if you're using fresh (not frozen) blueberries - I checked mine at 45 minutes and it was completely done, I actually wish I'd taken it out a few minutes earlier.

Yes, as other reviews have indicated, the batter is VERY thick (especially prior to adding the egg whites).  Hopefully you have a stand mixer; I only have a hand-mixer, and the batter kept clogging up the beaters!

I greased/floured the pan before adding the batter, but the cake stuck in the pan anyway.  Perhaps more thorough flouring next time.

A solid basic recipe that will allow you to "play" a bit with adding other flavors you like, if that's your thing.  As a stand-alone recipe, it's slightly blah.

Love this recipe. This cake came out so fluffy and light I couldn't believe it! I did add about an extra 1/2 egg white to the recipe plus added in a few tablespoons of light brown sugar into the 1/2 c that you cream with the butter. Also added 1/4 c chopped pecan pieces. This recipe worked great even with frozen blueberries!  Tip my cake was finished at 45 mins..I actually wish I'd taken it out a few minutes earlier, so watch your time,depending on how hot your oven runs!   Will be adding this to my favorites!

I think this cake is delicious,not too sweet,light and fluffy. The only thing I did different is I added frozen blueberries last and baked it in a tube pan for 45 minutes. I will be making this often. Thank you,Irene.

Been making this very recipe for over 35 years. Wonderful! If anyone feels daunted by all the "steps" in this recipe-- I DON'T BOTHER separating the eggs and whipping the whites up separately, after discovering very long ago that it makes little difference in the finished cake. Streamlines the process!! If I have some grated lemon peel hanging about I toss that in, and I always sprinkle the top with cinnamon sugar.  After somehow misplacing my beloved recipe, was so glad to find it here!

I am a huge blueberry muffin fan and wanted to try something a little different.. I may never make the muffins again! I just made this and ate it hot out of the oven and it was delicious! I traded the all-purpose flour for whole grain white wheat flour to bump up the nutrition, but you can't even tell it's in there. I took this out of the oven at 30 minutes! I highly recommend checking it early to see how fast it bakes in your oven.

Love this recipe. The only thing I changed was to add the blueberries at the very end instead of before the egg whites.  Means less  blueberries crushed in the mixing.

This is my go-to recipe for blueberry cake, and have made it many times over the years!!  When blueberries are in season, out comes this recipe.  I follow the recipe exactly, except for adding 2 cups of berries rather than the 1 1/2.  I've also used margarine a few times instead of the butter and it comes out fine.  I make this for events, receptions, and parties and I ALWAYS take home an empty plate.  People LOVE it.

I made this cake with Splenda instead of sugar, except for the single tablespoon sprinkled on top. I made it in a 10" spring-form pan and decreased the cooking time accordingly.  As others have said, the batter is really, really thick. It was hard to "fold" the egg whites into it the batter, but I did the best I could to mix them in as lightly and loosely as I could. It turned out nicely - golden brown, moist, and chock FULL of berries.

This was so good!! I made it with fresh blueberries and added an extra 1/4 cup.  The first time I made this for my friends it was gone so quickly! Now whenever I make it, I always make sure to make two so there's some leftover.

This is a very good recipe,like a blueberry coffee cake. I used the unthawed frozen blueberries that I picked last summer. Using the unthawed frozen blueberries did not allow the berries to "bleed blue" into the batter. Had to mix the berries into the batter by hand and also folded the egg white mixture by hand. I have made this recipe twice this way and both times it has turned out great. I other wise followed the recipe as written.

This a very nice cake-it has a nice light texture--most likely from the extra step of folding in the egg white mixture instead of just beating in the eggs whole. I also like that the cake is not too big. Just 2of us at home now and is just enough for a couple of days-I hate waste.

If you are using wild Alaskan blueberries, fold in the eggs whites first, then add the blueberries last. If you do it as in the recipe, the cake will turn purple and the blueberries will collapse.   It will taste good, though.

This was good. My boyfriend and I did enjoy it. The blueberries sank to the bottom however. It was sweet and the sugar hardened nicely on the top giving it a sweet thin crisp texture. It was moist as promised which was amazing. The bread tasted as if it lacked a little. Maybe next time I will double the vanilla? As always I followed the recipe as written. I can't give it 5 stars because it didn't make me go "Oh wow, this is good!" But I didn't have leftovers so it was better than most.

Great cake when made correctly. Anyone that had trouble mixing this or thought it was too thick, try mixing the merengue in, in 2 installments and make sure you use wild blueberries. Cultivated berries are tasteless.

A wonderful cake--not too sweet either.  I used a bunt pan and greased it with cooking spray, then sugar-coated the outside to give it a delicious sweet crust (which was my favorite part of the cake).  I topped it off with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and it was delightful.  I will probably make this again.

I simplified this great summer cake. I use 2 whole eggs, a total of 3/4 cups sugar and omitt the tablespoon of sugar and flour from the end of the recipe. This is not necessary with fresh blueberries, in particular the large variety nowadays available.

Meh. It was nice that it wasn't overly sweet and was moist. But I wasn't blown away. I definitely agree with other reviewers that you should nearly double the vanilla and extra blueberries are nice too.

This is the first "from scratch" recipe I have ever made, and it came out great!  I really miss eating Blueberry Muffins since I have had to go low-sodium, and this cake quenches my craving.  The recipe is not too sweet which my husband (a dentist) really appreciates.

This was just OK for us. It was a good cake, but I've eaten cakes prepared with better recipes. I thought that whipping up the egg whites would contribute to moisture, but it didn't. Overall, this cake was just OK.

I used frozen blueberries. I have to admit this cake takes lots of work and uses lots of bowls. I am not sure it's quite worth it though. It does come out very moist and delicious, just not totally perfect. I feel like it lacks a bit of flavour. I still gave it 5 stars because it could be due to the frozen blueberries. I may try again with fresh and update my review.

What a delicious cake!  Followed the recipe exactly and it's fabulous.  A couple of pieces of advice, though--it probably won't take 50 minutes to cook. I cooked mine 40 minutes but I wish I'd taken it out a few minutes earlier.  Also, next time I'm going to add the blueberries last, because the more you stir the batter, the more the flour comes off the blueberries (and the more likely they are to drop to the bottom).  This isn't a sweet cake, so I made a caramel glaze to drizzle over and topped it off with toasted pecans.  There were only four of us at dinner and the cake is 2/3 gone already!  Scrumptious!

This is a fantastic recipe!  The cake is moist and flavorful, and a lot easier than it looks.  The first time I did it, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was really good, though the texture of a factory-made blueberry muffin.  So, the second time I made a few adjustments simply because I was in a hurry and I tend to change things.  Instead of separating the eggs, I added them whole.  The salt I threw in with the flour (which I cut down by 2 tablespoons), and the vanilla I added to the milk.  I, too, used frozen blueberries (make sure you drain them or they'll water down your batter) rolled in a flour/sugar mixture.  I also tossed in the "sprinkling" tablespoon of sugar with the blueberries.  Then, I frosted it with buttercream icing and served it at my daughter's party.  There was nothing left!  I know a lot of people have said "it tastes like a mix!" but to that, I say this:  if every cake in the world was at least as good as a mix, the world would be a much better place.  If it tastes like a mix, then it's a compliment in my book.

Incredible cake. Note that I have no idea how to cook/bake. At all. I was just a poor student with more blueberries than I could ever eat that I didn't want to spoil. So I found this recipe. I messed up the recipe pretty badly (ie. doing stuff in the wrong order by accident...hey, I said I was bad at cooking) but it still turned out so good. Verrrry yummy. Go make it :)

This was easy and delicious. I substituted half a cup of corn meal for half a cup of flour. Used 2 cups blueberries, 1 cup each of strawberries and raspberries. Baked and served it in a cast iron skillet. Everyone LOVED it--even very accomplished cooks. Not too sweet (which I don't like) lots of berry flavor.

Very easy and very good. I made it slightly healthier by using egg subsitute instead of egg yolks! I also used FF milk. It was a very good cake!

I had high hopes for this recipe.  Honestly, I really wanted to like it, but I'm sad to say that I didn't.  The cake wasn't terrible, but it was a disappointment.  For all the time, effort, and blueberries it took to make it, I got a cake that, though readily scarfed down by everyone in question, was described as tasting like blueberry muffin.  For less aggravation, save your efforts and make the muffins instead.

Light as a feather and sooo moist! I added the zest of one lemon for a little extra zing and I sprinkled pearlized sugar on the top for sparkle. It was pretty and delicious : )

I followed the directions exactly for the cake.  The only change I made was to double the recipe because I wanted to make it in a bundt pan.  I used a 12 cup bundt pan, anything smaller and the cake will overflow.  it was a delicious and   thanks for sharing.

Make this EXACTLY according to the recipe and it will be PERFECT.  I made it with fresh blueberries and it was wonderful with no changes to the recipe.  I think separating the eggs and then adding the stiffly beaten whites contributes to the wonderful texture.  My dried and floured blueberries were well-distributed in the cake.  Five stars for sure!

This was a huge hit!!!  I added a little more milk, and it is really important to make sure you have stiff peaks before you stir it into the batter.  One batch I did, one batch I didn't, and the one I didn't was gooey on the inside.

I loved this cake! It was very moist with a great flavor.  I did mess up the recipe a bit- but it all turned out great. I made this cake trying to get rid of some blueberries in the fridge- but still have a bunch.  Anyway, fabulous flavor- it's especially great when it's all warm and you spread butter on it so the butter melts- Yum! :D  Thanks IRENED! Wonderful!

This was a really delicious cake. I too was alarmed with the thickness of the batter and I also used frozen blueberries. I'm considering thawing the berries next time first, though, because it kind of froze the batter and made it even harder to stir. Very delicious recipe either way, great served with whipped cream.

I loved this cake so much, and apparently my family did as well because it was gone fairly quickly. Fresh blueberries taste wonderful, I prefer them to frozen blueberries when adding them in the batter. The only thing I would change is the time that the cake is in the oven. I had to keep it in 5 mins longer than suggested, because the center was not fully cooked. Other than that, it was sweet and simply scrumptious!

Wow. This was great. I added a splash more milk because the batter seemed a bit too think and I used two cups of blueberries - other than that I stuck to the recipe. It was light and fluffy and delicious!

Kind of tasted like a store-bought blueberry muffin to us.  A lot of work, too.  It didn't taste "bad", and it's possible that I could have made a mistake in the baking process, but I didn't like this very much.

I just baked the cake today and my cake turned blueblack!!!! I used canned blueberries instead of the fresh ones and i mixed them to the batter and it got blended with the batter!
The taste is good though, moist and not too sweet! I used an 8" round cake pan, but the didnt rise too much. The height is about 1.5"! What's the actual cake would look like anyway??

This is a really good cake. I followed a few tips from other reviewers that included:
 -- Adding blueberries after folding in egg whites
 -- Upping the milk from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup (which may not have been necessary as the cake was very moist)
 -- Increasing the vanilla to 1 tablespoon as opposed to 1 teaspoon
 -- Adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the sugar for the topping.

This is a small cake. It's not packed with flavor, but it does pair well with your morning coffee or hot cocoa.

This is a real keeper!!! Made in a bundt pan by doubling the recipe, but after reading the reviews that say it tastes like muffins, I doubled the sugar and added some almond flavor, as well. 2/3 cup milk for the doubled recipe did not work for me, I had to go one full cup. And the result!!! The most moist, fluffy and appetizing cake ever!

Smooth cake. Not too sweet. I used frozen wild (small) blueberries which, as always, turned the cake blue. I would make this again and increase the frozen wild blueberries to 2 cups or even more. Cake was done in the time listed on the recipe (50 min.)

Very good as written, not too sweet! It's more like a coffee cake than a dessert cake, and I love that it's small, an 8 inch pan is perfect when you don't have a huge crowd to feed.

Best blueberry cake ever! According to the neighbor to home I gave the cake as a thank you gift. The batter was quite thick, as others have mentioned, but it came out extremely moist. Took about 5 minutes longer than stated to bake through, but that could have been my wonky oven. I used previous suggestions and added a second tsp of vanilla, a handful of brown sugar to batter and cinnamon to the sugar on top. I forgot to add additional sugar to the whipped egg whites and it was plenty sweet without it. I have a feeling the egg whites made it extra moist!

This is delicious! I added a bit of lemon juice to the batter because I find these flavors go nicely together. Based on other reviews, I did add a bit more sugar, though not double. It was perfectly sweet this way. I baked it in a bundt pan and it looks lovely.

Made it in a loaf pan. My husband said it tasted like the blueberry cake his mother made. Recipe is the same.

Great recipes, I used this one as base to do my own "berries cake". As I had raspberry, blueberry and blackberry in the fridge, I just all in the cake and it worked very well. Batter is very fluffy :)

Great recipe. I made it as stated, except my egg whites didn't get stiff (I believe because my bowl had batter in it!) so I ended up just mixing the egg white mixture into the batter. I don't think it mattered, as it turned out great. I used buttermilk in place of regular milk and also doubled the recipe and put it in a 13x9" pan. This cake is very moist and is not a super sweet cake, but that's okay. I love the sprinkled sugar on the top - gives it a great little crunch. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake because I had a huge amount of blueberries left over from a party.  I made the "Blueberry Simple Syrup Recipe" from this site to serve on top.  I had a few friends over for dinner that night and the whole cake and syrup was gone.  My hubby said that this was one of the best deserts I have ever made and I cook A LOT!  I will for sure be making this again.  Company worthy for sure.

This is the best Blueberry Cake my Husband said that I've ever made.  He said he likes it better than blueberry pie.  I added a little more vanilla and a 1/2 tsp. of almond.    1/2 c sugar instead of 1/4 cup and last but not least,  I used sanding sugar mixed with a dash of cinnamon for the topping.   It was The Best !  Will be my recipe from now on !

I made this exactly as written except used a gluten free all purpose flour. It was delicious!  I would definitely make again and might add some lemon zest to the batter. A didn’t feel like a glaze or frosting was necessary and ate as-is. My family enjoyed with vanilla ice cream.

I used fresh barberry instead of blueberry. I only add about 4 tablespoons of barberry, im afraid if I add more the taste will be very sour, And it turns out really good. ?? Absolutely will repeat this recipe soon!

A little extra prep time with the egg whites, but definitely worth it!  It is amazing! My teenage son loved it! It would be great with chocolate chips in place of blueberries as well.

Stopped at a farmstead in Maine and picked up some tiny sweet blueberries - found this recipe and it came out terrific.  I've never used the method of whipping and then folding in the egg white mixture.  Excellent will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

The cake was very delicious, although it wasn’t the easiest recipe to follow. For some reason, I had a problem whipping the egg whites and sugar into soft peaks, thus my cake rose and then fell when I took it out of the oven. I’d give this recipe 4 stars!!!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, just reduced the sugar slightly and used frozen blueberries (unthawed), and it turned out well, very moist. However, I do want to point out the batter was super thick, to a point I couldn't fold in the whipped egg  whites, and it was not  pour-able, as the recipe states. I added a bit more milk, but the batter was still very dense.

This cake turned out great! Very moist, fluffy and delicious! Only thing I did differently was add 1/2 baking soda. And mine only needed 45 minutes! I thought about making a streusel on top but it browned so beautifully that I’m glad I didn’t. Maybe next time! Also next time I think I will add a tiny bit of cinnamon like another reviewer suggested because I also love cinnamon.

This lives up to its description, very moist, the sugar on the top gives it a little crunch. I did use Sugar in the Raw on top for a little extra sweetness. I read the reviews where some said it was dry keep in mind when baking to spoon the flour in the measuring cup to measure then your cake will be fluffy.

This is a good tasting cake but a little on the dry side. Next time, if there is a next time,  I will add some sour cream to hopefully make it more moist. I baked it for  35 minutes which was quite enough time..

This was delicious.  My husband does not even like blueberries, he said it was so good because it was not sickening sweet.  I did not make any changes except I put a little less berries because I did not have the exact amount called for but was still so delicious, I am making another this weekend.  My new favorite desert!!!

This was ok. I guess I was looking for that melt in your mouth effect...not so much but if your looking for a cake this is good. I won’t make it again. I’ll stick to my moms blueberry buckle.

The second time I made this didn't turn out as the first. Instead of folding in the blueberries, I actually let them get mixed by the mixer. After I baked it, it turned out stiff in the center and flat.

I made this! But I used vanilla cake mix, butter, water, olive oil, brown sugar, and blueberries. I made it in my spring form pan. I made a circle in the middle of the cake, and added vanilla pudding. My mom tried it, and she loved it! I'm thinking of making a blueberry cake for my Autism group.

Delicious cake. Light and fruity, not too sweet. I accidentally got a little bit of yolk in the whites, so my whites didn't make it into stiff peaks (or even really soft ones) and it still came out perfect.

Excellent blueberry treat! While there are several steps, I've always had it turn out great!  I top It with a simple almond glaze/icing instead of the sugar sprinkle. YUMMY! Never lasts more than a day at our our house.

I agree with the comments stating lack of flavor. I would add some lemon zest . Also I made it with only one cup of flour as I dont like it dense.

I expected more out of the cake because of all the steps and bowls I had to use. It was lack luster, plain jane nothing out standing for all the steps and work it is. The dough is very thick and hard to stir. I wanted to eat it hot, it was better cold. :(

This cake was little bit crumbly , but  delicious.
I was in a hurry  so I took  some short cuts. I used pam to spray the pan and I didn't beat the egg whites separately . I just added  both yolks and whites to the creamed butter and sugar ( the 3/4 cup all together }. The cake still rose beautifully and wasn't dense. I might cover the cake with a lemon glaze next time.

I did coat the blueberries with flour and it kept them from sinking,.But I am disappointed that it tastes like a blueberry muffin, a bland blueberry muffin.

This is a good recipe. I couldn't get the peaks to form when i was mixing the egg whites but, I still folded in the egg white foam to the mixture and it turned out well. Will definitely make again.

Made exactly like it said.  Came out delicious, moist, and fluffy.  Great warm with butter. If you use frozen blueberries,  rinse frozen with cold water for a about 20 seconds then toss with flour then fold them in to finished batter just enough to distribute.  Do not over mix. Blueberries will not bleed into batter this way.  Same way if making muffins.

Made this for a school project, I substitute 1/4 cup APF to cake flour, 3 small eggs, it came out moist and buttery flavor, not too sweet with yummy blueberry, I baked at 325C with my dark 9" square pan but for my oven 50 mins of baking are too much, I took out at 45 mins to test it was over done, next time I will try 35-40 mins. Thanks for the recipe!
Jan 31/2017 I made this for the 2nd time with 35 mins baking time, even tho it pass the tooth pick test but it taste really bland, so I recommend baking longer to bring out the flavor, I will stick with 45 mins from now on. Thanks!

I made this after looking at the reviews, I felt it was very good, not  hard to make.  I did add more blueberries and next time I will try a bit of lemon juice as I find that adds even more flavor.  I did think  the flavor was good, but I use really good wild blueberries.

Love this recipe and it was a hit with my family and especially to my aunt who is very hard to please!! I'm only giving this a 4 star because there are a lot of dishes to be washed afterwards. What I added differently is the frosting (coconut caralmelize frosting) and topped it off w/ toasted unsweetened coconut and the flavor paired well!! Will definitely make this again!!

I loved the contrasting textures of the crisp, sugary crust and the soft inside. However this recipe could use more tangy and sweet components (like sugar, lemon or sour cream), plus a bit more salt to bring out the flavors. If you like moist, dense cake, I would add another wet ingredient, such as oil or sour cream.  I found that the bake time was about 10 minutes too long, and the cake dried out. Do use fresh blueberries.

The cake was easy to make and came out moist. Not too sweet and was rich with blueberry flavor. I used three pints of blueberries, and substituted 1/4 c white sugar for brown sugar. I've made this cake twice and my family loves it. I plan to make it again!

Finally a perfect blueberry cake!

I was amazed at the height and texture of this cake. It's not too dense, but it is "sturdy." I added a bit of lemon extract to up the flavor, but kept the rest just as described. I did add a butter/sugar/flour crumble to the top before baking, which also gave it a little more oomph. The whole thing was gone by the two of us within the day. This cake was scrumptious and I'll absolutely make it again. I wonder what other fruits might work....

Just got home with the ingredients for this cake. I've made it many times as it  was also one of my mom's favorite summer recipes. It does what it says...melts in your mouth? If you don't like it, you didn't make it correctly. I wouldn't change it a bit. It's dang good the way it is.  This cake brings back great memories.
Good times, good times! Thank you for posting recipe!!

I  made this cake today --its a    wonderful  recipe -  and I just wanted to say I have been making this same recipe for many years  - it came from one of  my 1969  Maine Rebekah cookbook   that  my mom gave me. Its  good with Maine blueberries   huckleberries or just   field berries -   as I have use all 3 --its been a favorite of my family for years -   I use 1 /4 cup more sugar and about 1 t. grated lemon rind ---sprinkle conf.  sugar on top after its cools  a little bit .

I may be lazy, but this cake just isn't worth the extra work. I don't understand why you would separate the eggs, whipping the whites, then folding the whites into the batter. Not necessary. Not only that,  the cake itself is small--8" square pan.

This blueberry recipe is really fantastic!
I used raspberries instead, but it's equally good since the basic recipe for the batter is the same. It's even more delicious when you add honey into the mix.
Thanks so much! :)

[also, its the first cake i have ever baked and it turned out to be so good]

The outcome wasn't great, but that probably was my own fault.  As a more inexperienced baker,  I had trouble knowing when I had the right "peaks".  Although I used flour on the blueberries, I didn't dry them well first and they sunk to the bottom.  I used homemade whipped cream and it seemed plenty sweet.

This is a tasty cake, but way too complicated to make.  I had already started mixing things before I realized that the recipe called for separating eggs and beating the egg whites separately.  (A reminder to me to always read the recipe completely before starting!). I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I cooked it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe said as it didn't appear done at the recommended time (and maybe I should have stayed with the recommended time as it was slightly dry). I will remedy the slight dryness by making a warm blueberry sauce to pour over it when I serve it.

It was pretty simple to make. Hubby picked me fresh wild blueberries from our yard. Just took it out of the oven. Can't wait to try it!

Lovely, light cake. I doubled the recipe, used 4 cups of berries, and since I did not separate the eggs, I added about 1/3 c. brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. It browned beautifully and is wonderfully light and tasty.

First of all, this is a delicious cake. It's fluffy (but not too light) and has great texture. It's also not overly sweet. My kids devoured it. I think fresh berries always makes a huge difference in taste and should always be used if possible. A few notes, though: I think it's much easier to whip the egg whites THEN make the batter, that way you don't have to clean your mixing bowl. If you use a KitchenAid to beat the whites, it's a breeze and then you could just reuse the bowl. The way the recipe is written, you have to really clean the bowl before you beat the eggs. Also, I doubled the recipe to put it in a 9x13 pan and it's much more difficult to deal with because there's a lot of batter. It can be done, of course, but just be aware that it may almost be easier to make two batches instead of one big one.

This was a great recipe.  I learned new techniques and had a fun time making it.  The final product was delicious but if you want to spruce it up a little i made a blueberry sauce to go on top!

Cake was great but it definitely took a lot of work! I would use less blueberries next time. I think I'll venture off and look for other recipes before I try this one again.

The recipe says to bake it for 50 minutes but I see on the side bar, it says to cook for an hour. Plan for a full good hour for baking. I doubled the recipe and even after an hour and ten minutes, I still wasn't sure it had cooked the whole way through. Since I have a brand new oven, I know that wasn't the issue. Looks delicious though!

I'm very happy with my results baking this cake; in-fact I'm considering trying other fruits just to experiment. The only thing I would change is adding 2 cups of fruit instead of 1.5 cups.  Delicious and easy.

I just made this tonight, and the recipe says 1/3 cup milk;  With just 1/3 cup, it is like thick cookie dough, not cake batter. I added another 2/3 cup. The finished cake was good though.

The blueberry cake was moist and had a good flavor.  Part of enjoying your food is the appearance and this just looked OK.  I was actually embarrassed to take it to my event.  I should have looked at the other pictures posted.

This cake was very moist and tasty. I used soft brown sugar and frozen blueberries (they need more than a tablespoon of flour coating to prevent them from sinking, I think). It was a bit of a faff whisking the egg whtes and folding them in, but it gave it a nice moist texture.

This was good but took too much time to put together.  Very different texture.

very nice, as others mentioned more like a muffin than cake.  Husband said it could have been a little moister, so we put strawberries & syrup on them as a shortcake.  Most likely will not make again.  Reading others comments, it was a lot of figure it out, than clearly written.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I loved that it wasn't too sweet, which made serving it with vanilla ice cream scrumptious!

Made them into muffins, amazing! Next time I think I might bruise the blueberries a little or maybe use half blueberry juice and half the milk I don't know we'll see. Either way, these are pretty tasty.

Mmmm... This is my grandmother's favorite Marjorie Standish recipe!!! I'm always asked for the recipe for this one. (Also good with strawberries subbed for the blueberries) Last time I added way too much milk and it still came out wonderfully!

Loved it! This cake came out so good, not too sweet, very moist. My blueberries didn't sink in. I would recommend more than just a sprinkle of sugar on the top. That really makes a difference. Over all, it was gone in one day!

Great cake! Now mixing the stiff batter with egg whites is not too easy but it's an easy cake by itself. Not too sweet so it's perfect since you have fresh blueberries.

This recipe is a family favourite, so much so that I've made it twice in 1 week a few times now and the kids still request it. Definately worth trying if you haven 't already.

Mmm... I made this today and it tasted great! I guess you can say it kinda "melted" in my mouth haha!! It was very moist and i loved it like that. My mom and I were the first to try it after I made it. She thought it was "too sweet" but probably anything with sugar is "too sweet" for her! LOL. I thought it was fine, i mean, its cake afterall. :]  To be honest, as I was making this, i messed up a little. Well, first of all, my batter was fine until I put the frozen blueberries in (since all the blueberries I have are frozen) and then the batter kind of got cold/chunkier and i tried mixing it and the skin from the blueberries started coming off!! >.

I just made this cake for my co-workers, and they can't leave it alone!    I think next time tho, I'm going to powder the top with some icing sugar to make it a little more attractive.  All in all VERY GOOD!!!!

the cake was very dense and didn't cook all the way to the bottom; i think this is because i used frozen blueberries and i must not have drained them enough. nonetheless i agree that by itself this is a somewhat bland recipe; a lemon glaze totally saved it (lemon juice + powdered sugar).

Really great recipe. I made it for a party and it was gone in about 5 minutes. I used frozen blueberries but it still tasted very nice and it was cheaper than fresh.

This was a great cake.  I made it with fresh blueberries, and took it to a pool party/BBQ today.  It was still warm when we left and everyone loved it!  I cut it into smaller pieces to make it go further.

We loved this cake and for people in hi-altitudes it came out perfect with no changes to the recipe. I used a Pyrex baking pan and instead of sprinkling regular sugar on top I used the coarser cake dec. sugar. Nice flavor and texture.

I love this cake!  It reminds me of a blueberry muffin.  I baked it in an angel food cake pan but it wasn't enough batter to really fill it.  Next time I will try doubling the recipe.

Great cake, a couple of problems with the recipe-no quantity was given for salt ( I used about half a tsp.) and at not point does it say anything about adding the egg yolks.I blended them in with the butter and sugar. The cake disapeared before dinner so I am going to make another one...thanks
