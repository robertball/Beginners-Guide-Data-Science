I omitted the seasoned salt, because I thought it would make it too salty. Right after I made it I tasted it, but it was bland. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE, the  trick is it needs to sit overnight. The next day it was delicious! We are at the river or lake often & you can only have cold cuts for so many days in a row. We ate this for two days on the trip and we were sad when it was gone. I made it into sandwiches and served it on raisin bread, and we enjoyed it as a dip too. This is a keeper for sure!

I normally don't like chicken salad and I really think we might make this again :-) Even my husband liked it - even without the pepper. We used light Miracle Whip and fat free plain yogurt, two cubed chicken breasts from a left over rotisserie chicken and ripe red pear (since we did not have any grapes) and we did not have any nuts so we left them out. I can see this being very good in a whole wheat pita instead of regular sandwich bread like we did tonight. Will be using this one again.

Enjoyed the cranberries and the nuts.  The tang of the yogurt can be overwhelming for someone who isn't used to subbing yogurt for mayo.  Lucky for us, we enjoyed it very much.  Great recipe!

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I don't care for celery so I left it out and used extra apple in its place.  Next time I would use less cranberries and more chicken.  The canned chicken was easy, but roasted or boiled fresh chicken might be tastier.  I really liked how light this salad was and was not weighed down by a lot of mayonnaise.

Except for subbing walnuts for pecans and using cold rotisserie chicken, I followed the recipe to a tee. Started chopping at 10:30, stuck it in the fridge at 11, served it to the church ladies at noon. It was widely agreed among the group that this is, in fact, the best chicken salad sandwich ever. I wouldn't add a thing, except plenty of pita pockets. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

This chicken salad was awesome. The only change I made was to use leftover chicken. And as another reviewer said , it is better left to set overnight. I loved it stuffed in a pita and if I cut the ingredients real small it is good with Ritz crackers. MY brother raves about and he would eat the whole bowl if I let him. Do not change anything with it , it is good as is.

Great recipe! Made this for a large group and they loved it. I left out the apples and grapes and added red onion, a little cayenne powder and some horseradish! Makes a great snack on crackers too!

Loved it!  I didn't use cranberries, used regular Hellman's Mayo, leftover chicken instead of canned, and Greek yogurt.  It turned out amazing.

This was excellent.  So much better than store bought.  I used fresh 1 1/2  chicken breast instead of  canned chicken, boiled and shredded it.  Followed the rest of the recipe as is.

First time ever posting a rating. But this was a great recipe. Just happened to have everything. Used some Hormel chicken breasts and left over chicken breasts. Other than that don't change a thing.

I like the creaminess but it has a lot of ingredients I'm not used to in a chicken salad. But I wanted to try something new. It's not bad. It's missing something. I'm going to add boiled eggs an see... Thanks for the recipe.

Good combination of goodies.   Great to get ride of left over chicken.   I never measure.  I substituted sour cream because I did not have plain yogurt in the fridge.   No grapes either but they would be good.  A little lemon juice adds a citrus overtone.  And I may try a small amount of red onion when I make it next time....which will be soon!

I’ve made delicious versions of Sonoma chicken and Waldorf salads and this just didn’t cut it. Way too sweet and mushy with the canned chicken.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly. I let it sit in the fridge over night so the flavors would all meld. That did not help. I don't know how to describe the flavor other than it was not good. My husband also agreed.  I can eat almost anything but this went straight into the trash. Such a lot of food to waste.

I love this recipe! My family loves it too. I usually make it in the summer, for picnics, vacation, or just a cool, bright meal.  I usually use grilled chicken, never canned. I've tried different grapes and apples, all have been great.

We didn't have yogurt so added extra mayonnaise.  It was exceptionally delicious.  Oh, we also added a slice of havarti cheese and grilled the sandwiches. YUM!

This is very good.  I did not have an apple so I couldn't add that.  I did add two sliced green onions to half a recipe.  Next time I would add more.
