I made this 3 ways 
1 with stevia blend  (1/2 stevia, 1/2 sugar)
1 with sugar 
1 just as the recipe states 

They were all good,  but the recipe with only stevia lacked the depth of flavor needed in a tart.  Suggestion would be to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to get the tartness into the tart,  otherwise it's just too sweet. 
The best one was made with the blend.  Tasted great and still low in sugar so your diabetic friends could have half a slice. 
The full sugar one could have probably used a pinch of salt.

I made this as a Streusel topped pie, just used more pears. Should have also increased cranberries-- the combo was delicious! I didn't use stevia, just white sugar. And I used slivered vs. sliced almonds.

It was simple and easy to make, I made my own pie crust for it.  It was delicious.
