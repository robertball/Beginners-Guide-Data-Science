This is wonderful, I've been making it for several years using the flaky Pillsbury crescent rolls. The recipe as published here makes too much filling for a single batch. I use one package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 TBSP sour cream and it turns out perfect every time. In the frosting, I use half & half instead of milk and add 1/4 tsp almond flavoring. You'd never know this danish wasn't made in a fine bakery. I am asked for the recipe every time I make it. NEW EDIT: The new Pillsbury crescent sheets without the perforations are great for this!!

My mom passed this recipe on to me and it's FABULOUS!  
My mom changed the directions slightly - she leaves the cresent dough rolled up and slices it into about 1/4" thick slices...then she flattens the middle a bit, fills it with the filling and bakes them.  This makes tiny round danishes like the ones we buy frozen from Costco.  They're awesome!

I woke up this morning craving danish. I had all of the ingredients on hand except lemon juice. I thought the suggestion of several previous reviewers to slice the crescent dough into rounds instead of making a top and bottom layer in a pan sounded interesting, so I sliced the crescent rolls into about 1/4 inch thick slices (dental floss makes this very easy!). I mixed up the filling and substituted 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract for the lemon juice  (turns out that made it taste exactly like the danish filling I'm used to getting at the bakery!). I flattened down the center of each dough circle and filled the depression with a spoonful of filling and baked for 15 minutes. They came out great! Cute little mini danish. Half a recipe of filling is plenty for two tubes of crescent rolls. Don't overbake, they should just barely be golden or the danish will be dry.

Loved the filling, but I don't like canned dough. What I did use was puffed pastry and once philo. I rolled out puffed pastry then cut in 4 inch squares, put a tablespoon of filling in centre and pinched opposit corners baked 15 minutes in a 400F oven delious. Philo is just as easy. Unroll thawed pastry cut in 5 inch squares put into muffin pans then a spoon of filling. Taste is much better and realy not much more work with frozen puff and pholo pastry. Finish both with a sprinkle of powered sugar.

Excellent and, indeed, easy.  I used the suggestion of a previous reviewer and sliced the crescent roll dough (like purchased cookie dough) rather than roll it out.  I managed 20 slices per tube of dough.  After flattening the middles, I could put almost a tablespoonful of cream cheese filling in the center of each.  I reduced the filling amount by half and still had more than I needed.  (I just refrigerated the extra; I KNOW I will be making these again soon.)  I drizzled each individual danish with the glaze.  This was a wonderful addition to the buffet set out for a breakfast meeting.  Not a single crumb left.  My next experiment will be to add a spoon of blueberry pie filling along side the spoon of cream cheese mixture.  My local bakery makes awesome blueberry cream cheese danishes.  I don't see why I can't too.  lol

Not bad! I took the harder approach and sliced the canned crescent rolls into 40 slices (20/roll). Made the whole filling amount w/exact ingredients listed and added 1/2 T. of sifted flour to stabilize it, had about 1/4 c. left over. The crescent rolls lack the true flavor of danish pastry (buttery/sugary), so next time I'll beat 1 egg w/1 T. water, brush the rounds and sprinkle w/a little sugar before filling them. When you make them this way (rounds vs. sheet-style), they take about 15 min. Watch them closely, and let them get golden brown for more of a bakery effect. I put about 1/2 T. of filling (before baking!)after indenting middle of the crescent rounds - was more than enough, and they will settle (shrink) a little when cool. I used parchment paper on the baking sheets - worth the investment, cleanup's a breeze! Also - the glaze was very stiff, but you want it that way to firm up like a frosting. An easier way to drizzle them is: 1) Make the glaze in a micro-safe dish, nuke for 5-10 seconds (watch closely, don't boil it - just want to make the glaze "pourable"), use a funnel to put it in a squeeze bottle, and drizzle away on COOLED pastries (so it doesn't run, makes it more authentic). I may try next time with puff pastry rounds in a muffin pan. Your friends will be impressed.

Thanks Natalie!
Being a professional in the food business, I can tell you this really is a great recipe. 

After reading the comments...i made a few very minor changes.
1) baked bottom crust for about 5 minutes to prevent it from being soggy
2) Whipped a whole egg and brushed it on the top layer before baking (gave it a nice color
3) used the icing BUT...added about 3/4 tablespoon of Almond Extract in the icing (i did not end up using all the icing.. I just put on how much I personally liked...drizzled it on

To the comments about shaping it round...I actually like the fact that you get cheese in every bite by keeping the recipe as is!
To the comments about it being TOO much cheese mixture...I totally disagree. To me its the perfect amount. If you like Cheese Danish...use the full amount!
To the comment about it taste better when its cooled off....you are right on the money...it was even better cold!
Finally...it did taste like danish dough. I will be making this again real soon!!

This came out perfect with (like others mentioned) half the filling mixture.  Next time I may even use a little less than half of the sugar (like 1/3 cup).  I laid the crescent unrolled and flat into the baking dish, topped with cream cheese mixture, then made three "stripes" with strawberry pie filling.  I topped it with the second unrolled crescent roll and left some of the filling show, then made three "stripes" of pie filling on the top.  Baked for 25 minutes and it was pretty and tasty!!  Also, I used 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of milk for the topping so it would drizzle.  Next time I'll try the slicing method.

UN.BE.lieeeeeeavable!
i halved the recipe, and added a splash of almond extract to the frosting.  i also spread the filling, then rolled the dough up, loaf-style, and it came out looking & smelling like something from a bakery! i think next time i may also add some almond paste to the cream cheese filling and sprinkle slivered almonds on the frosting, just to experiment.  so easy and so good!!!

Thanks for this super easy but extra speical breakfast/brunch family favorite.  I bake this in my Pampered Chef rectangle baker and get excellent results each and every time.  I've added fresh blueberries or canned pie fillings for a change but I rarely ever use the glaze, too sweet for my tastes.  I do an egg wash and then sprinkle with a cinnamon/sugar mix most of the time.

I love this danish! I cut the recipe in half & cook it in an 8 inch square glass dish. I left out the lemon juice (didn't have any) but it's still delicious.

I followed the recipe without alterations. There is waaaay too much cream cheese. The bottom layer was soggy. The top layer was almost burnt. I read and re-read the instructions. Not sure why this is so highly rated.

I made these thinking they couldn't possibly be as good as everyone said they were, but I was sooooo wrong!  I'm a 'from scratch' baker and dislike using pre-packaged doughs and mixes, but I must say that this recipe came together wonderfully and tastes better than my local grocery-store bakery danishes.  The amount of filling was perfect.  It seems like a lot at first, but the dough rises in the oven and the filling softens and melts.  I added a couple drops of almond extract to the icing, which was the perfect topper.  I'm eager to try these with a little raspberry jam in the middle as well.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I just got done making this and it looks and tastes nothing like the cheese danish I have had before.  I followed the review  recipe and just used the bottom layer of rolls - added the cheese mixture, which was so good...baked for only 15 minutes and it was already brown, so took it out of oven.  The cream cheese mixture puffed up and browned.  If anyone knows what I did wrong, please let me know as cheese danish is my favorite!  Thank you in advance.

Easy & delicious recipe! I used two 8oz cans of dough and halved filling amount, then layered as directed in 8x8 glass pan. I think i would have liked even more filling in mine, so I'm not sure about halving the filling for a 9X13 pan. Icing was great with the addition of some almond extract. Filling had perfect flavor ( i dislike a lemon flavor in cream cheese, but didn't notice it at all).

so delicious and super easy to make! Like others, I halved the filling and it was plenty. I also cut the crescent rolls into 1/4 inch slices, made a depression in the center with my thumb for the  filling. Did not bother with the top layer of crescent rolls, as this method made great little mini-danishes. Baked for 15 minutes at 350 and it was perfect. Had some issues trying to drizzle the thick icing so I put it in a mini-squeeze bottle (the one I used was for making candies though any squeeze bottle should work) and it worked fantastically. Looked just like it came from a bakery! Hint: if the icing is still too thick to squeeze out nicely, dip base of squeeze bottle in very warm water for 10 seconds or so to thin it out

I cut them into circles instead of using the sheet of dough.  Got 17 circles out of one can of crescent rolls.  Brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with sugar before filling.  Used  a teaspoon of cream cheese filling and a teaspoon of strawberry jam on each.  Baked for 15 minutes and they turned out perfect.    Cool completley before icing them.  I would suggest to make the night before.  I ate one cooled and then had another one the next morning.  The next day didn't have the crescent roll taste. Not sure how it changes overnight, but it was a lot better the next day.  A keeper recipe in our house.

I halved the filling like others,  but I wish I hadn't.  They turned out too bready. My husband says always err on the side of more instead of less. I used the crescent roll sheets instead of pressing the rolls together. That may have affected the recipe. However,  the flavor is amazing!  I did add half vanilla half almond extract though because I love almond extract. It makes everything better. Also, used 2 tablespoons milk in the glaze and it was still a little thick for drizzling. If you don't like the uncooked starchy flavor of powdered sugar, warming the milk will eliminate that taste for this and other powdered sugar glazes.

Baked @ 350 degrease for 25 min. then baked @ 325 degrease for 5 min. perfectly done, tasted divine!!!!!!!!!                                   Thanks sooooo... much for sharing this recipe.

Way to much filling and desperately in need of an egg to help it set up.  My husband and I love cheese danishes, so this year as a treat between his b-day and Mother's day (same weekend) he made these with the kids. Unfortunately I should have read more reviews before printing it off and handing it to him (and yes, he can cook).  If you make this I highly recommend you cut back on the sugar, add 1 egg to the filling, and decrease the filling by half.  Good luck to you.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I will be making this regularly!  The only thing i did differently than the recipe called for was that I baked the bottom layer for 5 minutes before adding the filling (as another reviewer suggested) and I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled it lightly with sugar.  It turned out PERFECT!!!

I thought these were good and easy.  The pastry part wasn't the same as you'd get in a bakery but it was still good.  I thought the cheese filling was so similar though to danishes I have bought!  I took the advice of others and just cut the tube of crescents into rounds and made mini danishes.

I ate these 5 mins after they came out of the oven and they tasted great. The extra frosting drizzle took something away from the pastry I think. It lacked flavor I think. Anyhow, I ate the leftovers the next day and the crescent dough taste was really pronounced and I could barely taste the filling at all. I felt like I was just eating a roll. I would make it again for just the filling but will probably try the phyllo dough as others have suggested.

My whole family begs for this!  We tried it with a fresh raspberry and a frozen blueberry layer, both were a hit!  Super easy and super good!

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I took the advice of other cooks and cut the roll of dough into 8 rounds, flattened them and filled them with the cheese filling.  After the danishes were cooled I placed blueberry filling I made on the top and drizzled it with the icing.  I added a bit of almond extract to the icing.  There are so many possibilities with all the different fillings you can use.

This was sooo simple it should be illegal!! I made the round danishes and used half the cream cheese mixture like many reviewers said. It was just barely enough, but I put on a good amount on each danish. I made all the glaze because I halved that and it wasn't enough. I asked my husband if they tasted like cresent rolls and he said he wouldn't have ever known. These things could be transformed into all sorts of things...thank you for sharing!! :D

I followed the instructions exactly for the pastry and cream, and in doing so, recieved many compliments and requests for more. The glaze was slightly too thick for my preference, which could be altitude, so I added a bit more milk.  I enjoyed this, but my guests loved it and stated that it was better than any bakery pastry, which is ironic because it is so easy.

These were very yummy. I read the reviews before and I used the suggestions from others about the measurements for the filling. I also used two 8 oz. packages of the dough because my grocery store didn't have 10 oz. Turned out delicious though.

I made this yesterday for our Super Bowl Party today. Got up this AM and one corner of the dish had been emptied with a little note beside it that simply said, "Looked too good to wait, thanks Babe!" I didn't change a thing only because I didn't have time to fuss and it came together fast (I'm in love with fast) and super easy (my hero).  DH says for me not to wait until next Super Bowl to do these again.  Looks like a keeper...recipe and DH!  Thanks sooo much, Natalie!!

We loved this. My 6-year old declared it "really, really yummy!" I halved the recipe and omitted the lemon juice. I also only drizzled the glaze on half of them and we all agreed that next time we'll just skip the glaze entirely. I thought that the amount of cream cheese mixture was perfect. Many that made the full amount in the 9X13 pan made half the filling. I made half the filling too but used it in a 9X9 pan. Because we liked it so much, next time I'll use a 9X13 pan but I'll also use the amount of cream cheese specified, 2 8 oz packages. I guess it's a personal preference...we like a lot of filling! :) And I had one piece at room temp and one piece that had been refrigerated. I much preferred them cold :) Thanks, will make again!****Update***today I tried the slice method and made mini danish circles...LOVE them! I sliced them about 1/4 inch each and really piled the filling on but it baked just fine-about 12 minutes each. Will definitely make them again this way in the future :)

These were very tasty.  I took advice from previous people and didn't make as much filling.  I'm glad I didn't..even cutting it down, I still had leftover filling.  I tried the round way some people suggested too.  Then I made some by seaming together the crescents and spreading the mixture over the top and rolling it up like you do cinnamon rolls.  These turned out well too..the cream cheese was evenly distributed, creating a lighter and more even taste.  Lots of possibilities with this recipe.

SOOO GOOOD!  I made this for Easter and it turned out perfectly.  Extremely easy too.  I followed directions almost exactly; only changes wer baking bottom layer of crescent rolls for 5 min. and  I also added blackberry preserves, which gave it a wonderful flavor.  Even better the next day!

These were delicious! I was planning to make them for Easter Brunch and then read a couple of recent unfavorable reviews. Finally decided to make them anyway since I had already shopped for the ingredients. I'm sure glad I did. They were wonderful. I did cut the filling in half, as suggested by other reviewers. There was plenty. Will make again!

I was really missing the french danishes you can get at french bakeries in new york city. Well let me be the first to tell you THESE ARE FABULOUS.  These definitely are professional grade cheese danishes.  As far as those who said that there is too much cream cheese used in this recipe, not at all, it's the right amount for a tray of danishes.  I made 1/2 my tray cherry pie filling on top of the cheese mixture.  The other 1/2 of the tray is plain cheese. Works beautifully. Tastes like a danish you would get in a french pastry shop.  The extra drizzle of icing on top also works well.

This could have been better.  Maybe I'm biased seeing as how I work at a bakery that makes fresh traditional pastry daily, but making this with canned dough, while fast and easy, was "not very appetizing"  Also, way too much filling.  Really, cut the filling recipe in half unless you want half an inch of filling in your danish.  The filling is good though.  Would be tasty with the addition of berries mixed into it as well.

OMGosh!! The cream cheese filling is amazing! The crescent rolls tasted like crescent rolls which were not appealing at all. I decided to make them again but this time I made them with puff pastry and added cherry filling to the cream cheese filling and they were DELISH!! My guests raved about them because they looked like they came from a bakery. If u make these, ditch the crescent rolls and use pillsbury puff pastry, you'll be much happier with the results!!

This turned out pretty good.  Probably not Christmas morning worthy, but good.  I spread sugar free strawberry preserves on half.  I used light cream cheese and splenda to cut down on calories.  Maybe full fat cream cheese would give it the extra star?  I will probably make it again and put lines of strawberry preserves on top of the cream cheese mixture as spreading it all around made the top layer slide off very easily- making a very messy pastry.  The fam liked it with the preserves better than the plain cream cheese.

I just could not imagine this tasting as good as the reviews BUT yummmmmm!  I cut the filling in half as some reviewers suggested but next time I think I will use one 8 oz plus half of another to make a little more filling.  My 94 year old mother said it tasted just like the danish you buy!

Easy and very good.  Have made cream cheese pastry from scratch for years and given as gifts and was told by one of my  yearly recipients this recipe is better than my recipe.  Will definitely use when I need something quick and easy and fail proof.

These were simply Fantastic!!  Based on previous reviews, i cut the filling in half, and still had a little too much. I also cut the 2 packages of crescent rolls into 1/4 inch thick circles, flattened the middle with my thumb, and put the filling in the middle. (made about 27 mini danishes) This took me about 8 minutes to put together, VERY SIMPLE! The filling tasted exactly like the cheese danish's i used to get from an italian bakery. The crescent rolls could have used a little something extra, i think next time i will brush them with butter and sugar based on other peoples reviews.  I will definitely be making these again. Great from a brunch.

Wow, this was excellent.  I made it using fat-free cream cheese, fat-free sour cream and reduced fat crescent rolls.  I make them stretch to fit my 9x13 pan so it made the filling spread very well.  I like the filling amount as in the recipe.  My husband commented that it might be good with some type of jam inside for a bit more flavor.  I told him about 1/2 the reviews already said that so next time I make it I will add some sugar free jam.  I also am going to try Splenda for the sugar.

This was perfect!  I doubled everything except the filing.  Be ware that this icing is very thick; I had to pipe the icing using a bag b/c I could not spread it with spatula.  Heating the icing after it is combined may make the icing more pliable.  I took it to work and the whole tray was gone within 30 minutes!  Tastes best warm.

This was wonderful,I made half of what it called for and ate a ton. So very rich but in a good way. The lemon gives just enough flavor to balance the the sugar and creaminess.

I've made this two ways, both in a 9x13 pan and sliced into rolls. I prefer it made into individual rolls. When you make it in the pan, you really have to let it get brown on the top to be sure the bottom layer isn't going to turn out doughy and underdone, but when you slice it into rolls you can bake till just golden and the pastry doesn't get as dry. Also there is the patience factor. When it's in a big pan it takes a long time to get cool enough to ice and eat. The rolls are ready much sooner!

Oh my!  Oh my!  This was a last-minute dish for me as I needed something to bring to a pot-luch brunch.  It was the star dish!  I must confess that I've never used store-bought dough before (I'm a from-scratch girl).  It was a very easy recipe to make.  I halved the filling as some suggested and found that I may use the full amount next time.  But it certainly was delicious this way (and a bit healthier too!).  I too found the dough to be a bit tricky to cover a 9*13 dish, but I managed to make it work.  I realized that I had no lemon juice on hand (yikes!) and so I mixed up a tablespoon of really strong lemonade.

Just made the Cheese Danish using 1 sheet of puff pastry instead of crescent roll dough.  I made half the recipe and used an 8 x 8 inch baking pan.
Instead of drizzling with icing, I just sprinkled some sugar on top before baking. This is plenty sweet enough for my taste.

I baked it for 35 min. @ 350 degrees F instead of the called for 20 to 30 minutes.

I could not wait for it to cool down, so cut a piece of it after 15 min. cooling.  One bite of this and I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven, it was so good!

Will definitely make this again!

The directions seem to indicate that this dough is suppossed to line a 9x13 pan. Not in this lifetime! I tried rolling it out and nothing worked. So I left it about the same size I started with and went on to the filling. There is about double as much filling as one could possibly need. When I put the top crust on, it wouldn't stay put and the edges wouldn't stick together at all.

The ingrediant list must have meant 2 cans "cresant rolls" instead of two cans dinner rolls. Although cresants rolls are listed in the instructions, when grocery shopping, I just used the ingrediant list...which means I bought the dinner roll cans. This is a big mistake b/c there is a big difference between the two. The pilsbury refridgerated dinner rolls already come in the shape of rolls whereas the cresants is a flat dough. Therefore, I used my roller to flatten out the rolls to make the "crust" and "topping." Also, I halved the filling, which was a good thing because the full filling would have been too much. Still, it is a great breakfast dish and would make this again...using cresant dough!

EXCELLENT!!!!!  Only need about 1/4 of the cream cheese filling it calls for.  We added a dab of pie filling the first time we made these & tried fresh blue berries the next time, both we're delicious.  I will be looking for a "from scratch" flaky dinner roll to use instead of store bought next.

These tasted really good.  However, I wish there wasn't that much filling.  I'll make it again, but I'll be sure to lessen the amount of filling.  For those who love lots of filling, this is for you!!!  Also, my icing was thick so it didn't "drizzle."  Maybe it's because I made the icing right before putting it on???  I have no clue.  But overall, they tasted great and it was very easy to make.

These turned out great.  I  used "light" crescent rolls, which were fine.  I also heated sugar-free blueberry jam, added some Splenda, and when it started to cool I spread it on top of the cream cheese before adding the top layer of rolls.  In the future I will use light cream cheese and mix some Splenda into the cream cheese to reduce the calories even further.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this as a quick breakfast treat for the boys this morning. I took Kaye Lynn's suggestions and made the filling as such--one package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 TBSP sour cream. It was just enough to fill without overfilling. When I made the vanilla drizzle, I cut back on the milk just a touch and added a little pure vanilla extract. The boys ate every single piece. I didn't even get to try it!

I chose to use crescent rounds to make individual danishes instead of the 9x13 pan. If you do this, you will definitely need to cut the filling in half. There are only 8 rounds per can of dough. Make an indentation in the center and fill with a tablespoon of filling and smooth out. Bake as directed on the can, 10-12 minutes, watching carefully. The filling tasted great. The glaze in this recipe turned out thicker than my recipe for cream cheese cake frosting. I had to add way more milk to reach "drizzling" consistency.

Wow! By the time I had this cooled and ready to eat almost half was gone! I didn't have any lemon juice so I had to omit that ingredient. I also didn't make the topping because I was out of confectioner's sugar. I was so eager so make this I didn't make sure I had all my ingredients. It wasn't a problem though. It turned out super! Next time I think I'll half the cream cheese mixture and add some type of fruit jelly on top before I add on the other layer of crescents. I love how this recipe is very simple and yet you can tweak it to your own personal preference!

Made them by slicing the rolls, but I wanted them thicker so I got 18 per roll.  I then followed Kaye Lynn's recipe for the filling - THANK YOU!  Turned out to be more than enough for all.  There is still a bit in a container in the fridge leftover.  I added almond extract to the filling, put a dollop of jam on top and sprinkled with slivered almonds before baking.  They turned out really pretty and delicious.

We first ate this fresh, hot from the oven and my thoughts were it was good but not great.  However, we discovered that after it sat and was cold...it was great!
I do think there was enough filling that 1/2 of the recipe for it might be better.  The dough on bottom didn't get totally done and was gooey in spots, so less filling would probably help.  If you prefer alot of filling, putting the bottom crust in to bake for a few minutes before you assemble the whole thing might help.  
Very good recipe, can't wait to make it again!

This is so good. I am a from scratch cook, so this was  a crazy thing for me to try. But , it is now one of our favorites.

Kids loved it, hubby and I thought it was a little sweet. I added a layer of seedless raspberry jam on top of the cream cheese.

I made this as a part of a Mother's Day brunch along with two others and of the three it was my least favorite but good none-the-less. When it was warm I thought that it was too sweet. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cut down the filling in half but in my opinion it probably didn't even need that much filling. It was plenty sweet already! However, it was still a really good recipe and it disappeared quickly!

The cream cheese filling itself was very yummy. There were times I thought it was too sweet though (and I am a sweet lover to the Nth degree), so I might cut back on it next time or add more lemon juice to balance it out.

I improvised by using a slightly smaller rectangular pan to bake the danish in, and as a result there were times where I thought the filling was too much and other times when the flavor of crescent roll was too present, flavorwise.

I would definitely make this again.
Next time, I'd like to modify this recipe to go inside a puff pastry.

Very easy, came out exactly like a store-bought (but better!). This is very sweet. I did not half the filling like some people did, and Im glad I didnt.

Even easier with the new crescent roll sheets.  I used 1 teaspoon lime juice in place of the lemon juice.  I sprinkled a generous portion of cinnamon on top.  They were a huge hit at my house.  Thanks for the recipe, Natalie!

Yummy! I sliced the tube of crescent rolls in half; then sliced the halves in half; and then those forths into thirds to make 12 circles. I placed them on a greased sheet pan and made indentations in the center of each one. For the fillling, I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, and I didn't think they were sweet enough, so next time I'll use the full 3/4 cup.  I filled a sandwich bag with the filling, snipped off a corner and then piped it on to each round. Baked at 350 for about 10 minutes, or until the pastry is browned. For the glaze, I used butter, powdered sugar, lemon extract, milk and just a touch of sea salt. Next time I'll omit the salt, as the pastry has plenty of salt in it. Really pretty addition to a table.

This was amazing! I used the new pillsbury "crescent rounds" which is easier than slicing the tube of dough as suggested by other reviews. I also substituted  irish cream instead of lemon juice for a richer taste.

This is good stuff. I do admit to not having any sour cream. None. Not even a little bit i could scrape out of the container. So i did without and added just a tiny bit of milk. Halved the filling portion. Added some almond extract with the vanilla because its my favorite.  Brushed the top with egg white and sprinkled with sugar. I did have to add a little bit more milk to the icing portion to get it to drizzling consistancy. Again added almond. Even my dh who doesnt have much of a sweet tooth loved these.

I sliced the crescent dough into 1/4 inch thick circles as suggested by some reviewers.  I also added raspberry jam in addition to the filling.  They tasted great and looked like mini danish. I was very pleased.

This was absolutely delicious, even better than I expected.  I had a bunch of fresh blueberries from my share so I added layer of Blueberry Breakfast Sauce from this site to the filling.  I halved the recipe, using only one can of crescent dough and 3/4 package of cream cheese; and there was plenty of filling.  I didn't bother with the topping because this was just for me and my boyfriend, and the danish was great (and sweet enough) as is.  I loved this and I know I will make it again and again!  I might even try making individual blueberry and cream cheese danishes using the method suggested by other reviewers.  Natalie thanks for posting this!

Sinful!  I love it.  I really liked the punch of lemon in every bite, but that's probably because I used a little more than what the recipe called for and it was fresh rather than from a bottle.  Regardless, this is a simple and tasty recipe.  Thanks Natalie.

I decided to rate it 5 even though I changed the recipe somewhat. I used biscut dough from a recipe off the back of the self-rising flour bag *yum*, and added some blackberry preserves. We downed it quickly!

The measurements on this review when prepared exactly are terrible.  I made it as-written and this danish was a soggy saccharine mess.  Should have used half the amount of cream cheese.  Also, there is too much sugar in the glaze to ever "drizzle over" the danish.  Won't make it like this again.

Had some cans of Grands biscuits so used them instead.  I split each biscuit into 3 parts, using one for the bottom and one for the top, which made 24 danish.  I put a hole in the top and sealed the edges.  I baked in the 9x13 pan which filled the pan almost completely.  They were great! I will definitely be doing these again.

Excellent!  The recipe calls for more filling than you need.  I followed others suggestions and halved it.  This danish is just what you would expect to get from a good bakery.  I will be making these again.  Thank you Natalie!

I absolutely love this recipe. I was forced because of a broken oven to use the suggestion that someone made to slice the crescent roll dough into quarter inch slices. You use one circle for the bottom and one for the top. It makes beautiful little individual danishes. I have also made these ahead freezing the unbaked prepared danishes until needed. When I am ready to use them I pull them out of the freezer the night before and put them in the fridge. Then the next morning, I pop them into the preheated oven and cook them until golden brown; can't remember the time. I watch them because I'm still using my convection toaster oven until my big oven gets repaired or replaced. I want to replace; my husband wants to repair. It's amazing how much I've been able to cook in my toaster oven!!! One thing I've toyed with trying is drizzling them with dark chocolate and the sugar icing for a sweet little dessert or sweet appetizer. If anyone tries this before me, please post your results.

THESE WERE SO GOOD! I'VE TRIED MAKING THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA CHEESE DANISH AND THESE WERE FAR BETTER THAN THOSE DANISHES. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and only used half the filling and the topping. Maybe next time I'll try using all the filling and half the topping. Also for the topping, it wasn't spreading as I thought it would so I added some light corn syrup to make it more spreadable and piped it through a ziploc baggie with a hole in it. Next time, I would like to make 8 individually sealed triangles with a mixture of fruits. Maybe then it would hold the suggested amount of filling and fruits. ***UPDATE*** I couldn't resist and made these again using the recommended filling and I would have to say it is WAY TOO MUCH. I love all the filling and ate it without any guilt but I think I'll stick with half, half with fruit, or 3/4 filling.

Mine turned out really good using half of the filling and adding a thin layer of raspberry jam. I used the Recipe Creations crescent rolls which are uncut sheets and it made this recipe so fast and easy. I will definately make again maybe using another type of jam or maybe lemon curd...

This was a fabulous breakfast danish, but the other reviewers were right, cut the filling by half and you should have more than enough!  We LOVE cream cheese and it was still WAY too much for us!

This was delicious!! I lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup per other reviews. Also, reading reviews I was torn into only using 1 package of cream cheese versus the 2 that it called for. So I split the difference and used 1-1/2 pkgs. I don't think there's any problem at all in using the 2. I also spread some raspberry preserves on it. Yum!! Be sure to pinch/seal all the seams together after putting the top on. Any slight cracks and the filling will ooze out. AND the prep time is much more than 10 minutes. Will make this again. Thanks Natalie!

TOO MUCH FILLING!  Word of warning, folks... 16oz of soft cheese is two-thirds of an entire 9-inch cheesecake!  This is a neat idea to use ready-bake crescent rolls though.  It doesn't matter what kind of cheese you use - regular cream, ricotta, cottage, marscarpone or any combo thereof. (Heck, cheddar and ham would be good!)  I halved it using 4oz of cottage & 4oz cream cheeses, and there was still way too much filling for it to be a "danish".  It was even more so when I added some raspberry jam.  Tasty, but too much!  A good quickie if you're really craving some freshly baked goods or need something to bring to a potluck or bake sale. Next time I'm only going to make a quarter the filling, then top and fold each rectangle of crecent roll individually.

Not as good as expected.  Canned crescent roll dough is canned crescent roll dough.  If I make this again I think I'll use something else like puff pastry or something.  The filling tasted okay though.

This tastes just heavenly... I took another reviewers advice and put lemon extract in it, and THAT is what made it taste like it was from a bakery. It made all the difference in the world. I make them into rounds and fill them with the filling and jam and then icing on top...makes for a knockout presentation. You will not be disappointed.

I wanted to make individual servings, so I used Crescent Round (instead of roll) dough, flattened the middles (I left a lip on it to keep the filling inside) and put the cream cheese mix into each. It was fantastic, although you have to watch them carefully to make sure that they don't burn.

SOOO GOOD! I halved the recipe and used one can of crescent rolls and folded them over like a book. I cooked them for 20 minutes and then iced them. My husband, Daughter and I LOVED them! Thanks for sharing!

This is EXCELLENT!  I cut the filling in half (used the advice of Kaye Lynn below for measurements). I also used a half can of strawberry pie filling on top of cream cheese filling-- in 2 strips down the length of the danish before applying the top crust.  I let it cool completely, cut them into triangles and drizzled them with the icing--very nice look for a baby shower.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!!

I slice the rolls up as well, only I actually roll out the dough, spread some cinnamon, spread the filling (leaving it really heavy on one end which then becomes the middle) then roll it up and slice it. This way there is a little bit of filling btwn all the swirls. I use half the filling, as others, and I eyeball the glaze. You can make it thinner and it will still harden but not be as sweet (for those who do not like too much sugar). You can also change the amount of sugar and lemon juice in the filling. I also added some vanilla extract to the filling. I do not use the sour cream as it is very hard to come by in Italy.

Wow - this was really fantastic.  I took the advice of the previous reviewers and cut both the filling and the drizzle in half.  I added a little extra milk and a splash of vanilla to the icing because I wanted more of glaze than a drizzled icing.  I used low fat cream cheese and it was decadent, I don't think you'll miss the extra fat.  A single can of crescent rolls is a perfect fit to an 8 by 8 square pan (just make 1/4 of the filing and icing from the recipe).  I had to work out extra long today because of these!

I made this twice in a week it went so fast.  The first time I mixed it by hand and the cream cheese still had some chunks in it, so the second time came out GREAT when I used the kitchenaid to whip it up smooth.  Same as the drizzle, use a whisk and it comes out smoother.  EVERYONE wants the recipe.  Next time I take this somewhere, the recipe is coming with me because I already know they will ask for it.  I know someone mentioned it was too gooey when they cut it, that was because it was probably warm.  I cut it after it's been in the fridge for a bit, no problems.  AMAZING!  Try it and pass it on!

This is so good! Worth every calorie!  I tried this recipe on the last morning that my son was home from college.  He ate a lot of it!  I made half the recipe in an 8x8 pan, and it worked great.  I added an egg to the cream cheese filling and didn't put in the lemon juice or sour cream, though I'm sure that would be very good.  To make it extra healthy (ha ha),  I also made a mixture of 1/4 c. butter, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans, and spread that on the top layer of the dough before baking for 30 minutes. It was divine!  Of course, the icing was no longer necessary then.  Next time I make this recipe, I will try using one of the shortcut puff pastry type dough recipes from this site.  Yum!

Very good.  I did reduce the amount of cream cheese after reading the reviews (I halved the amounts), and still had too much.  It was great, but for some reason my frosting was too runny and I had to keep adding sugar to thicken it.  I will definately keep making this anytime we have the craving.  Thanks for the post.

I used the advice from previous people and cut these into rolls instead. I also heated the icing for 10 seconds to make it easier to drizzle. I used half the cream cheese filling. OVERALL: AMAZING! I loved them and so did all my roommates and neighbors!

I have made this more times than I can count.  No one believes they are homemade.  Delicious!!  A must try and super simple to assemble.  I make the night before so they are solid enough to cut into triangles in the morning.

XLNT and EZ.  Used only 1 8-oz cream cheese as reviewers suggested.  Added some raspberry preserves on top of cream cheese at husband's request.  Got many raves and requests for the recipe!

This recipe was a huge hit.  My first bite was like I'm in heaven!!  I will NEVER buy another store brought cheese danish again.  This was simple and tasted heavenly. Also, I actually scaled down to a 8X8 pan with the extra cream cheese and used 1 can of crescent rolls instead of 2.  In the future, I will only use 1 package of cream cheese for the original recipe.

I agree with previous comment.  Filling is VERY thick.  If I make it again I will reduce the filling.  But taste is great and very easy to make.

I’ve made this recipe at least 20 times. It’s always perfect. I make it just as written. HOWEVER, I just today made it with one slight change. I assembled the whole recipe the night before and it sat in the fridge overnight. This morning, I baked it like the recipe says. GAME CHANGER!!!! Surely made our Christmas morning meal faster to get together. ??

Buy the crescent sheets.. Very easy and a time saver. I made the filling exactly to recipe. I did have a little left over but I would rather have extra than not enough.

I liked this a lot! I used 8 oz cans of cresent roll and only 3\4 of the filling. I also added cherry pie filling on top if the cream cheese. It was a hit at our church breakfast. I will be doing this again!!

I made it using the exact instructions with the sugar and cinnamon on top.  They were delicious.  Then I read the reviews and decided  to use some of the other suggestions, like making them in rounds.  They came out tasting like a roll with cream cheese on them.  I only tried four that way and I should have only tried one.  I still had the rest of the ingredients to make it the original way and just used a smaller pan.  It came out delicious again.  I just used less cinnamon in the sugar topping to make them less dark looking  after baking.   I would never make them using the rounds again.  (I brushed the top with melted butter before sprinkling on the cinnamon/sugar topping.).

This was super easy and tastes great. I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have it. This was flaky and had a ton of filling. I would highly recommend

definitely use one block of cream cheese, and a half cup of sugar, as well as 1 tsp each of lemon juice and vanilla.  I make two separate rectangles with one package of the crescent rolls, after spreading the cream cheese mixture, top with two rectangles from the second package.  we don't do the glaze, we top with raspberry jam- yum!  easy and delish, a Christmas morning tradition!!!

I make this quite often, and it makes the perfect danish with the perfect amount of filling. I would never consider reducing the filling! The only changes that I make are: for the filling, use two teaspoons Madagascar bourbon vanilla extract -- for the icing, add one teaspoon Madagascar bourbon vanilla extract and one tablespoon almond extract. Before baking, I beat one whole egg and brush it over the top of the pastry.  For a change of pace, I may spread a can of cherry pie filling over top of the cream cheese layer before topping with the last layer of dough. This danish is absolutely outstanding. No one ever would know that it didn't come from a fancy pastry shop!

Fabulous! These was easy to make and looked great when I took out of the oven to serve. I sliced them straight from the can in log form (I used butter flakey crescent). Then dipped the top of each roll (makes about 10 rolls) into sugar. Then I pressed down the center and filled with cream cheese mixture and baked as directed. I halved the recipe and did not go skimpy on the filling. Half the filling is enough for I can of crescents. I did not use the icing on top due to the fact I filled them a little extra. They sure did not last long here.

I love this recipe.  I add fruit or raspberry jam to make it more special.  I spread one tube of dough on bottom of pan and make sure it goes up the sides and ends a little. Then add filling. Next I unroll the 2nd tube crescent rolls , pinch the slices together to make a sheet and lay this over the filling. I make sure the top sheet reaches all sides and ends and press them together to seal. I might try the sliced dough and make the Danish like at Costco. Sounds yummy too !

Amazing Danish! Just the right amount of cream cheese filling. I made a lemon-tasting drizzle icing just for fun instead of the regular one suggested. This gave it a surprising but pleasant lemon taste. Great recipe! It will definitely be my favorite, which is good, because danish is my favorite food.

I made 8 of these with a thawed box of puff pastry (Pepperidge Farm). I made pockets by folding in corners of puff pastry after placing filling in the centers. The filling was delicious and I have enough filling left over for another batch. Easy and tasty!

So EASY to make... So GOOD!!!  I cut the crescent rolls into slices to make individual danishes instead of the 9x13 pan.  I prepared half of the filling, made an indentation in the center of each and filled with a tablespoon of filling. I baked them at 350 for 10-12 minutes, watching carefully. I poured the filling into a baggie, cut a small corner off and drizzled the glaze on the danishes after they had cooled.  When I took them to work many of my co-workers thought that they were store bought, that's how good they looked and tasted.  They disappeared in minutes.  I've never had so many requests for a recipe. Definitely will make again.

Yummy! ;) Made them into individual rounds with just the filling, no glaze. My husband said they were the best danish he'd ever had! Even better than from the bakery.

I prefer to "bake from scratch", but these were so fast, easy, and GOOD that I will make them often. I had tube crescent rolls that had gotten lost in my frig (they were past the expiration date) and I wanted to use them without worrying whether they would rise well. Even though the dough was expired, my cheese Danish tasted great. I chose to cut the rolled up dough into 10 portions as suggested by others. I made half the recipe of cream cheese, knowing that if I ran short I could make more. Each of my mini Danishes had a liberal tablespoon of cheese topping. Don't know how I would have been able to put more cheese on them. Haven't had time to quality check a "cold" one, but the ones out of the oven are tasty.

We used puff pastry and half the amount of cream cheese.  We also mixed in fresh blue berries.  It was a huge hit.  next time we will be trying little circles of pastry like some of the others have suggested.

Loved this! I took these yummy Danishes to a church breakfast and received so many compliments!!!  I put some sugar on top of the dough before it baked because I wasn't sure it'd be sweet enough. But they turned out perfect!

Great recipe.  Always get requests to make it.  I like to slice the rolls and make minis instead of slicing.  Slice, flatten, dollop of cream cheese (I add lemon zest) mixture, add a cherry or two, then make the icing a little thin w/ lemon juice and lemon zest and ice by squeezing out of a plastic snack bag with a very small hole cut into one corner.

I found 4 oz packages of crescents on sale for a dollar.  As it was just for 3 people it was perfect.  I made this with rounds like other people (8 rounds from the 4 oz. pkg). After cutting the rounds and before flattening the mixture I dredged them in sugar.  It made them sweeter and more like a real danish.   I only made 1/4 the cheese mixture, estimating most of the ingredients and it was more than enough.

This is really good and so easy to make.  I made the mistake of using only one package of cream cheese rather than two - because that's all I had on hand - but will be using two the next time I make this. Thank you for sharing this recipes.

These were just okay. I cut the filling in half and it was still too much. I wondered if it would be better with fruit to offset the strong cream cheese flavor. Don't get me wrong, it was sweet and tasted okay, but it just wasn't what I was looking for.

I love this and have made it for many years for when I have company.  It always gets rave reviews.  I love the little bit of lemon juice in the filling - I just use bottled lemon juice.

This is a very good recipe.  Anyone who thinks it has too much filling, does not love cream cheese filling!  It is outstanding, if it did not come out right, you didn't make it right.  It is too simple to screw it up.  I have made this for years and it is always perfect, delicious and disappears very quickly!  This deserves 10 stars!!!!!

made this exactly as written. the filling is very good. the refrigerated cresent rolls were too buttery for my taste. I will probably make this again with puff pastry instead.

It's definitely easy, and delicious!  The hint of lemon in the cream cheese filling is wonderful.  I only wish the roll dough was less salty, but that's the price you pay for the convenience and ease of preparing this recipe!  Be careful that you're getting the right sized cans of crescent rolls.  The recipe says you're using two cans, but I actually was supposed to use 3 of the smaller cans, and didn't realize it until too late.

The best!  Serve with fresh strawberries, it is excellent that way.  Did not use nearly all of glaze.  Could probably add more crescent rolls and put in a jelly roll pan and try stretching amount of cream cheese filling. Got rave reviews from everyone!

Mmm these were great!  I did the same as lots of people said and used the dental floss to slice the dough into rounds, pressed the center and filled with the cream cheese mixture.  I baked for 15 mins and the thin ones were a bit too dark but the thicker ones were perfect.  (I intended to slice them all the same but I'm just not that talented).  After they baked I topped half of them with raspberry pie filling but there wasn't much room to put it!  Gave them a great flavor though.  Now will have to make them again because there is so much leftover cream cheese filling and pie filling!!

This was fantastic!!! Added some almond extract to the icing (but would have been fine without) and cut into rounds instead of laying out flat (to let the kids help put the filling on) but basically the same recipe.  The kids and my husband loved this Valentine's day treat!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Very Yum!!! It took no time to make. In the future I'm going to buy the new crescent rolls dought that they sell in one piece without the seams. You have to like crescent roll dough when you make this recipe.

Excellent.  My husband was skeptical until he bit into one and then he just looked at me and said "Wow"!  I've had this recipe for years in a Pillsbury Cookoff cookbook but just never made it.

absolutely delicious and so easy to make. They are better than the danish you get at your local bakery!   I made them into individual danishes by cutting out diamind shapes from the crescent roll dough.  You will have to make a bit of a "pocket" for the filling or else the filling will run out a bit, but oh so worth the extra effort. My husband and father in law are HUGE "anything Cheese" fans and they flipped with this one! I will soon post a picture of the danishes to show the shape I made them into! But these are truly fantastic.

my husband eats very strictly during the week and freely on sundays. he had been craving danishes but wanted something homemade. i came across this recipe and i'm so glad that i did! i followed the advice of other reviewers and sliced the dough into circles. i made half the amount of filling. these made small, adorable and delicious danishes. they just came out of the oven and i tasted one, hubby has to wait until the morning! thanks for a great recipe!

This filling is amazing. I think it would be great in a cheesecake. I did not use cresent dough, I used a pie crust dough. I cut it to fit a mini muffin pan to make mini tarts. I filled each shell with filling and baked it @ 350 for 20 min, let cool to room temp and remove from pan. I topped them with cherry pie filling and chill for an hour. Excellent.

i did the slicing into rounds instead of the pan version. the cream cheese part was deelish, the crescent roll part was not appetizing. very artificial and buttery in a bad way. maybe i'll try others' suggestions and use phyllo dough.

Amazing! I never made a danish before. The only change I made was I used 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese because that is what I had. I icing on top is fabulous. I added seedless strawberry jam to half of it and it was tasty, but I preferred the plain cream cheese side more. I will make from from now on, it was a hit!

Very quick, easy, and delicious! I followed a review about halfing the filling recipe and I reccommend it too. I still had filling leftovers! I made them in a different style then the recipe said: I sliced the dough while it was still in a roll and flattened to make a circle. I then pressed my thumb print in the middle of each one to make an indent. I dolloped the filling in there.

Ive made this for years but I never use lemon juice or sour cream it always comes out perfect but my recipie has 1 egg yolk to thicken the mixture. and as far as the glaze all you need to use is powdered sugar and a very small about of water ad it makes this danish shelf stabe I always leave it on the counter since the mixture is cooked and there is no milk on top to go sour, I treat it like I eould a cookie when storing. another tipis to brush the top with egg white and spinckle with sugar for a golden top.

I liked the idea of a quick and easy danish recipe but the end result was nothing like a flaky, delicious, baked good I was craving.  Next time I'll start from scratch to hopefully get a better result.

I've never had a danish before, so I didn't have anything to rate this recipe against. I sliced the dough in 1/4 inch slices and filled them with either the cream cheese mixture or chopped apples (with sugar, cinnamon, chopped walnuts). My husband, who  requested danishes, said that while they were good- real danishes taste different.

Good recipe. I used four oz of regular cream cheese and 4oz Neufatchel cheese. Husband absolutely loves cheese danishes and he wants me to make them for his work. The only thing is the cooking time needs to be increased by about 2-3 minutes.

Wow these are good and pretty easy to make!! As everyone has said, I reduced the cream cheese to one 8oz. brick and the sugar to a 1/2 cup. I have made this a couple of ways, sometimes I add 2 tsp. of cinnamon(to taste) and omit the lemon juice. Wow! Very good! I also will do the plain cream cheese filling or add 1/4 cup of jelly/jam. Also, I do not do the top and bottom layer, but rather I place one crescent on the baking sheet, add the filling generously over it and then place another crescent on top and pinch the edges together. Perfection!

This was so delicious! Unbelieveably easy. I added a can a 12 oz can of raspberry cake/pastry filling as well. There was a bit too much cream cheese filling though, but I think cutting it in half would be too drastic a cut. I flattened out the top crust on a greased plastic pastry sheet and then laid it on top of the filling. I will definitely make this again and again! I did mine on a 16x12 cookie sheet but didn't use quite the whole sheet or the pastry would have been too thin. Excellent quick recipe. Thanks!

I love this recipe, although I haven't tried it like it says. :)  I used the crescent rounds and put some filling in the middle of each one.  then I put the icing over the top once they were done.  I like them without the icing too!  All the ladies at my church loved them, my band members loved them,  and my husband and kids loved them, so it's definitely a winner!  I also agree it made a lot of filling, but I think I'll try the recipe as it reads and then comment again later.  Mmmmmm.

I'd give this ten stars if I could. Made it for Mother's Day breakfast was loved by everyone. DON'T EVEN THINK about cutting the filling recipe, it's crazy! It's 100% perfect AS IS! Can't wait to make again with some cherry or raspberry preserves.

Fantastic, easy recipe. It works well warm and cold and is very easy to adapt. I added some raspberry preserves on top of half of the cheese mixture--just spoon it on and spread it around a bit--and left the other half plain for a little variety. It worked really well. I would definitely disagree with those who suggest halving the filling--it would be much too dry and all you would taste would be the crescent rolls with just a tiny bit of the delicious filling. I took one reviewer's suggestion and upped the lemon juice to a scant 1/4 cup--I think it brightened up the flavor nicely.

This got raves at our church Easter breakfast.  I did tweak the recipe a little.  I increased the sugar to 1 Cup and the lemon juice to a scant 1/4 cup.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to the glaze.  It added a very slight lemon flavor.  Everyone thought I bought it at the fancy deli downtown!!

It was really good. You definitely need to wait until its cool or even refrigerated before you eat it. makes it more firm. I also used lime juice instead of lemon and it came out great. i'd suggest using the whole cream cheese mixture not half otherwise its just a frosted croissant with barely there cream cheese. We'll definitely be making these again soon.

So easy and comes out like a gourmet bakery! I added some toasted almonds to the cream cheese inside and added some sliced almonds on top - delicious!I also brushed the dough with an egg wash before filling and topping - turned out perfectly golden.

These danishes are seriously addicting! I made them for Christmas morning, and the whole pan disappeared within minutes. If you're the kind of person who likes sweets, I definitely suggest NOT halfing the filling as some reviewers suggest. We used the whole filling, and it was divine, very creamy. I did add an extra 1/4 c. sugar, 2 T. (not teaspoons) sour cream, and a little more lemon juice. Really, you can make the filling to taste. These are very, very good!

I made these for my wife's ladies' Bible Study and they were a great hit.  Extremely easy and delicious.  I cut the roll of dough like cookies and made small individual danishes.  Do notice what others say about cutting back on amount of ingredients.

I made this recipe in two 8 inch pans and gave one to my neighbor for clearing snow from my sidewalk this morning.  Her family loved them and my roommate ate most of ours!  For ease of preparation and excellent taste, these deserve 5 stars.  ***Also got me thinking what other fillings I might experiment with....
~UPDATE~  I've made these many times now, both with and without fruit pastry filling added (not pie filling!) Great both ways!  I have also sliced the tubes of dough into 1/4 inch slices and placed them on a cookie sheet, them pressed an indent into the middle and filledwith the filling before baking. They were good both ways.

This has a good flavor.  Indeed very sweet, you only need a small bite to satisfy your sweet tooth.  It is also a must to cut down the filling by atleast half.  There is way too much.  When slicing it after its baked, it smushes out everywhere and is just too rich, although yummy.  Great idea to add pie filling.  Gotta try that next time.  And dont smash around on the dough too much to stretch and crimp it because then it doesnt want to rise and fluff like a cresent should.  The filling could use less sugar too.

This is a really really good recipe, but tweaked a bit, it's even better!  Add in a handful or so of fresh blueberries before putting on the top crust.  Or a few chocolate chips.  Soo yummy!!

I was leery about using canned crescent dough, but it made it all so simple and easy to do.  This is a great recipe to play around with I think - a base to add on to.  Thanks!

These were good, and everyone that tried them loved the taste.  I was a little disapponted because it tasted a bit too much like a crescent roll instead of a danish.  I brushed them with egg and sugar to sweeten them up, but still not like I had hoped.  I am planning on trying the Danish pastry dough on this website next.  I would rather eat the store bought than these, but still good.

These are delicious! I tried them as is and I tried with strawberry pie filling on top of cheese. Awesome! I didn't care for the frosting.(but I don't care for any frosting) Loved them with just powdered sugar. Thanks for the wonderful sweet tooth craving satisfier.:)

This is great and easy I take it to the office and it's all gone! I bake the bottom layer first for about 8 minutes.  I also let the cream cheese come to room temp and then mix with a mixer.  I like it better like this.  I think it's even better cold!!

I have made this recipe many times to rave reviews! I did make a few changes though. I used 1 1/2 pakcages of crescent rolls for the crust and used the remaining half a package to create a lattice on the top of the bars. I also omitted the sour cream because I didn't have any on hand. Enjoy!

Very very good.  YUM!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 (scaled to 5) and put it in an 8 x 8 pan.  Baked for 25 minutes, but could have gone the entire 30 minutes.  Also took the advice of other reviews and cut the cream cheese mixture in 1/2 (I thought 1/2 the cream cheese was perfect) Left everything else the same.  Taste great!

This is a great dish!  I also cut the filling in half and it was plenty.  I did find that adding pie filling caused the top to get a bit mushy but otherwise, my husband and I went through 2 pans of this in the last week:)  Thank you!

I served this for company and everyone loved it. Different from the typical breakfast fare. I used strawberry preserves and cut the cream cheese filling in half.

Excellent and easy. I followed other advice and used 1/2 the required cream cheese and sprinkled with powdered sugar rather than use the icing. Used lowfat cream cheese and sour cream and buttery flake crescent rolls. Great reviews from the board retreat members. Is definitely a keeper!

IF I ever make this again I will make MAJOR modifications.  The filling had a good taste but there was too much.  The icing was very rich and again there was too much.  I won't press out the crescent roll dough and layer the filling on it.  The dough will not fill a 9x13 pan but I knew that from prior experience with other recipes.  I may do as another reviewer mentioned and slice the dough into coins and dollop with the filling.  I may put the filling between two cresents and pinch the ends together.  It was a simple recipe but the final dish wasn't what I thought it would be.

i took many of the suggestions into mind when i made this recipe.  i actually used the exact amount of the cream cheese filling- but i made a "casserole version" and then i tried the " mini danish" cookie dough version--- with blueberry filling.  

i used reduce fat cresent rolls, and reduce fat cream cheese- it still came out rich and delicious.  i would definitely lower the cooking time for the mini danish version to 10 min or so- they cook much faster since they are small- and the turned out a little "crispy".  my husband personally would have liked more cream cheese filling in the casserole version.  (contrary to all the other comments on the website)  overall, very yummy and easy!

This was a easy and good recipe.  I made it to bring to work this morning.  I only made half of the filling and spooned on some blueberry preserves before adding the top layer.  Next time I may try it with a little more filling and preserves. I will be making this again and experimenting with different flavors of preserves!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fun and new breakfast dish.  I made one following the recipe exactly, and a second one putting cherry pie filling and a little almond extract in the filling.  Both came out yummy.  Will make this often and try some other pie fillings.

This was the best danish! 5+ stars! I did follow the suggestion of others and cut the cream cheese and sugar in half, and I used 1 tsp of lemon juice. It was easy and delicious. I made it for Easter brunch and there wasn't a crumb left!

YUM! The filling tastes just like the bakery kind! I followed the suggestion to slice the dough & they were great! I only made 1/2 a recipe of the filling & that was plenty. They don't even need the icing. I didn't use it & they were still great. No more store bought danish for me!!

Someone brought this into work and I loved it.  I looked it up on this wonderful site and found this recipe which is exactly the same.  It is easy and tastes delicious.  It makes a little too much filling for my taste so I just use what's left on bagels. Great recipe! Thanks Natalie and Allrecipes.com!

This is delicious and sinful at the same time!  

Instead of making an icing for the top, I just sprinkled on lots of granulated sugar before baking.  Super!

I came across this recipe from an online friend and was going to add it here, but found Natalie beat me to it! :)  This is so easy yet tastes like a million bucks.  I made this yesterday and brought it to work "just 'cause" and my fellow employees left nary a crumb!  Next time I'm going to add some peach preserves another online friend sent from Georgia.

Thanks Natalie (and Lali, too)!

This recipe has a lot of potential to be a family favorite around here.  It was easy to make, and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  My only problem with it, was that I should have listened to some previous reviews and not used the entire amount of filling.  It came out a little on the soggy side in the middle, I probably should have left it in a bit longer.  Also, I just drizzled on a light amount of the frosting.

This was very tasty. I made it for the second time today (first time was for a group and it disappeared quickly) and this time I halved the recipe as I went along. Turned out just as good. Can't beat it for a quick and easy brunch dish!

This was Betsy easy and yummy! However, per the instructions, it comes out looking nothing like the pic. I’ll explore with the next batch on making individual danishes.

Loved these! I did the mini danish as others stated by cutting the rolls  into slices.  I got 18 from a can.  filling is a bit much I actually had some left over and made another 1/2 batch from it . topped some with jam after taking from oven.  albready bought ingredients to make these again.

So easy to make!!! I made this exactly as written but since my husband picked up the crescent rolls for me and I didn’t know there were different kinds of rolls available, I made these with buttery crescent rolls and they were excellent and made a lot! I only had to bake them for 30 minutes, the center is like cheesecake and they didn’t have a dinner roll taste! This is going to be my “go to” recipe for gatherings from now on! Too, as per others, variations can be made to easily change them up with a different icing or adding fruit pie filing to the top. I wouldn’t cut back on the amount of cream cheese as some have suggested.

Truth be told, I made a  few changes to this recipe that would make it a 5+ rating in my books! Used 2 tubes of crescent rolls as per the original recipe but only one pkge of cream cheese, less sugar (about 1/4 cup),  and added a generous handful of golden raisins and 1/2 teaspoon almond essence instead of vanilla. Also, made individual danishes by slicing the rolled dough into 8 discs per crescent roll tube and added raspberry jam, along with the cream cheese mixture, to half of the batch of 16. Yummy delicious, fresh out of the oven, room temperature or lightly toasted. They disappeared way faster than expected, and I was the main culprit!

I used 1 pkg cream cheese instead of 2, topped with 1 cup raspberry pie filling, then second layer of pastry. Easy! Raspberry/cream cheese Danish.

This is so easy it is very easy to modify to add other ingredients on top of the cheese layer. I have made it a few times, today I made as the recipe describes. 
Thank you Natalie.

It turned out pretty well. I used someone else’s suggestion to reduce cream cheese and sugar. BUT, it is not good the next day! The dough falls apart and is like glue. I threw away 1/2 of it. So.... if you are preparing for a crowd the recipe is probably good. For 2 people, find another recipe. I won’t be making it again.

Wonderful. Added an egg to the recipe. Feels like it holds up the cheese mixture better.  Tons of mixture leftover so I Made one batch  with guava and cheese. Delicious

I bought crescent dough sheets rather than the rolls and just one container. I didn't want the top. My BF oopsed and got almond extract instead of vanilla and we had no lemon juice or sour cream, so I subbed lemon Australian yogurt (just the amount for the sour cream). I cut the sheet into four squares, folded the corners in to the middle and put the filling in the center. Baked for 15 min. I may have licked the bowl clean from the cream cheese mixture, it was so good. Oh, I only made half the filling recipe and only used 1/4c sugar instead of the full 1/4c + 2TBPS. The yogurt had sugar in it and I didn't want too much. Just ate one. The almond extract was too overpowering, there was too much sugar overall and too much filling. Next time I'll make it properly and get 2 cans of sheets instead of one (and still halve the filling). I can tell this'll be good when it's properly done so I won't omit any stars for my screw ups. :)

This is a very easy danish recipe that hit the spot.  I modified and used 1.5 packages of cream cheese because I wanted to add fruit.  I blended about a cup of canned peaches (did not use any of the syrup just peaches)  and put it on top of the cream cheese mixture before adding the second layer of crescent roll.  It turned out very nicely, but I would use more fruit next time. The bottom was not soggy.  Hubby liked it too!  (Major Win!)

It's good, but the flavor of the crescent roll dough is all wrong. I'll probably try puff pastry next time. I made half the cream cheese filling and it was still plenty.

I made it with exact measurements, but cut the dough as one review suggested (20 single rounds per can) and I used 3 cans of croissants!  After making 20 I remembered I had strawberry pie filling from a cheesecake I made so I started to fill with half cream cheese filling and half strawberry filling.  I had to fight off kids just to ice them because they looked so good.  Once they were cooled and iced they lasted about 4 mins!!!  This is cheap for 60 of them.  I have already promised to make some for coffee time at grandmas house!!

Very easy and yummy! I needed to use some cream cheese that I had left over in my fridge, so when I saw this I went for it. Everyone wanted more. 
I did have to cook it longer by about 10 minutes, but I think my oven doesn't cook properly. The bottom crust was perfect probably because I used a pizza stone and that always makes for a less soggy crust.

Great recipe for a first time making Danishes. While I had some thoughts and made some personal preference changes, these could be made exactly as the recipe dictates and the results would be delicious. These flew off the plate!

Some notes:

-The crescent rolls were fine, but I will probably just buy the Pillsbury dough sheets next time for ease.
-The bottom layer didn't get soggy on me, but it was thin. If I made these again I'd cook just the bottom layer for ten minutes before putting the filling and top layer on.
-Other reviewers are right, this does make a LOT of filling. I was happy with the amount and used it all, but just as a caution.
-I did make some personal adjustments on the filling. I didn't quite use the full amount of sugar--I put in a half cup and then added to taste. I also doubled the sour cream and lemon just to have the tartness come through.
-The top layer browns quickly. Luckily I watched it and put foil over it for the last five minutes or so of baking and they came out perfectly golden.

Holy cow, did these fly out the door!  These are cream-cheesy deliciousness to the extreme!  The filling is very sweet, so perhaps as others suggested, you may want to cut down the sugar in the filling a little.  The people I made it for love their sugar, so it was perfect for them the way it was.  I only added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the icing and it gave it that "wow" to the already "wow" product.  Love this recipe and it's a keeper!

Easy and delicious. I halved the filling and added almond flavoring to it, and made a simple powdered sugar/milk glaze instead of the one here. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's better the next day. It *does* have a canned-crescent-roll taste, so if you're expecting it to be exactly like a bakery Danish, you'll be disappointed. (I don't understand why people make a recipe with a convenience item like canned rolls, and then complain that the recipe tastes like the convenience item. Duh.) That said, for a recipe using canned rolls, it's pretty darn good.

Very good!  On one half I added some strawberry jam I needed to get rid of. Just tucked it between the crescent roll gaps. It was good either way. Hubby liked it warm, I preferred it cold.

Very good. Only change I did was half the filling recipe like other users had recommended and it was plenty. I also baked the bottom crescent roll layer for about 5 minutes before adding the filling on top. It didn't come out soggy.

I have done this one many times.  My boy loves it!  I only do half of the recipe and cut the sugar a bit less.  Instead of putting the 2nd sheet on top to cover it, I just leave it open.  So it looks like the coffee cake / danish sold in the grocery store.

I made this today for nine guys staying with us for a church retreat. It was easy and they loved it! The sour cream and lemon juice keep it from being too sweet. I took Wayne's advice and cooked the bottom crust first before adding filling. It would be especially good with the puff pastry as several suggested. I used the reduced fat crescent roll dough. I doubled the crust and glaze, but only used 1 1/2 times on the filling to keep it from being as heavy (3 blocks of cream cheese, not 4).  I made the glaze and filling the night before so this morning I just had to partially bake crust, spread the filling, add the top crust, pop in the oven and glaze it. A good recipe for kids leaning to cook--ingredients could be broken down for each child to make an individual danish.

I make cheese Danish by placing the filling in the center of a sheet of Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry and then crisscross the sides. My problem with the filling was...no binder or egg yolk. My filling completely melted out of the middle of the braid.  I had cream cheese soup and my pastry did not puff up. What a MESS!!!
 
There is a simple solution and that is to add an egg yolk to the filling recipe .

first of all let me say they are to die for I made the easy cream cheese danish they were very good a little on the  sugary side but next time I think I'm going to use less sugar on top and put strawberry preserves in the middle with the cream cheese or maybe cherries

Yummy and easy!  One time I was talking to someone while making these and not paying attention, and I dumped the icing ingredients in with the rest of the filling mixture.  Turns out...still yummy!  How can I not like a foolproof recipe like that!

SOGGY BOTTOM SOLUTION! I always made this in a glass pan. I wanted to make a smaller portion so I used a non-stick metal pan. My bottom was soggy that time. So I guess the solution is to bake it in a glass dish. It comes out perfect every time. I hope Kari sees this because I would hate for her to miss out on this wonderful dish.

Works great, halved it for two of us and we had two breakfasts out of it. Used one can of pilsbury rolls, split in half, and halved all of the other ingredients. Lemon is key to bring out flavor. Good on day two, not so much on day 3, so eat them right away.

It is indeed an easy recipe. The first time I made it I was at my daughter's house and used a glass baking dish. When I made it at home I didn't have that dish so I used a cookie sheet. It was a bit messy, but delicious nevertheless.

Made this last night and every one loved it. Some reviews said it was too much filling so I bought an extra roll of the crescent rolls and made a 8x8 pan along with the 9x13. It was all gone!!!

These are amazing made just as the recipe is. Just want to add that this time making them I decided to spread some cherry pie filling over the cream cheese mixture, and they were very tasty too!  Always a hit when I take them anywhere.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! I followed it exactly as it called for, and it turned out perfectly. The cream cheese is a BIT much, but if this is all you're eating, then it's great. It tastes amazing, and the only recommendation I have would be to cook it closer to 30 minutes to let the crescent rolls harden. That seems to help with the richness of the cream cheese.

I made half the recipe and shaped it into a braid. Also, I used low fat crescent rolls and low fat cream cheese, just added a 2 Tb of flour to the cheese so it would firm up. Worked great.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using my own dough instead of store bought.  This recipe was just OK.  I DEFINITELY should have doubled the cheese filling as suggested by many reviewers. I will try it again but with some definite changes.

Yuck. Croissant dough? It doesn't pair well with cream cheese, the croissant overpowers the cream cheese and all I can think of is dinner rolls. Use puff pastry instead, its sooooo much better tasting

Just tried this recipe yesterday and it is absolutely wonderful....I followed the directions exactly and definitely I think you need to use all of the filling....I also because of another reviewer brushed the top crust with egg and added about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the icing.  Will be serving this next week at our annual club golf tournament for one of the breakfast items.

Awesome! I made mine a bit different-spread melted butter on the cresent roll, then sprinkled a spoon of brown sugar on it, rolled it, then made a circle, mushed a center to hold the cream cheese....made these several times in the past few weeks, so easy and so darn good!!! Better than the bakery! Everyone loves them!! Can't get past the cream cheese, but I want to try blueberry and cherry pie filling.

Delicious!  Halfed the recipe in an 8x8.  Used about 1/3 cup sugar in the recipe.  Couldn't wait for them to cool, and while they didn't hold their form when hot, they were sooo good!  Thanks for this awesome recipe.  Easy peasy and yummy to boot!

I made this today, and my whole family absolutely loved it!  I did put a layer of blueberry pie filling on top the cream cheese layer, then put on the top layer of crust and lightly sprinkled it with a cinnamon/sugar mixture and baked it.  I also still put on the drizzle.  I personally love all the cream cheese filling, but if you don't like too much gooey stuff, I can see where others would cut that part of the recipe in half. But we LOVED it with the whole amount!

This is so easy and tastes great.  It has been a huge hit at both events I've taken it to so far.  Everyone has enjoyed it so much that I even had a couple of people fight over the last piece.

This danish is very yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, using all the filling since I love cream cheese, and I was very surprised at how great this simple recipe turned out!  The next time I make this, I may add fruit filling.

Made these and they were perfect.  I always make dough from scratch so I made homemade cresent dough.  Otherwise I did not change a thing.  They were very moist and tasted like they came from a bakery.  I only baked them for 22 minutes and they were awesome.  Thanks for sharing this is definitely a keeper.  My kids and friends loved them.  I will be making these often.

Took this to church for Easter breakfast.  Had only one piece left.  Very easy to make and great taste.  Did follow suggestions to 1/2 the cream cheese mix and it was plenty.

Four stars only because if I had made the entire filling (I made only half, per the suggestions), I would have had WAY too much!  As it was, I still had about half left.  I made minis, and they are so darling and DELICIOUS!  I did add an apple cinnamon topping instead of icing, but these little guys could hold their own with nothing on top!  I should have made a double batch!  I got 32 minis and I am sending them (well, the remaining 27..I couldn't help myself!) with my husband to work for Easter in the morning!  I doubt there will be enough, as those military men love nothing more than home-baked goodies!  I'm so glad I have extra topping and filling, so I can make more later this week!  Wonderful recipe, and so easy!  Will DEF make again!!!

These are seriously good and seriously easy.  The only thing I changed was to add a teaspoon or so of almond extract -- it gives it a slightly richer flavor!

These were Delicious :)  Cream Cheese Danishs are such a weakness of mine and of my husband also.  I used the store brand of Crecent rolls since the name brand ones have red dye (have a child allergic to Dye ) and they turned out Great.  I did not make the Icing but I sprinkled Suagr on the top rolls before baking.  SO GOOD and Easy - Thank You for a Great Recipe Oh and I loved the amount of Cream in the Middle

Great recipe that is so simple! I cut the dough into 1/4 inch rounds as suggested and also halved the filling recipe and had plenty left over. I substituted the lemon juice for almond extract and added a raspberry jam to half of the danishes. They turned out amazing!

I debated between 4 & 5 stars. It gets 5 for taste and ease, but I thought the cream cheese filling was a bit thick. I used the Pillsbury crescent dough sheets. One sheet fit perfectly in 9x13 pan. I will absolutely make this again, but maybe 1/2 the filling and add a layer of pie filling...any flavor would be good. I wasn't sure if these should be refrigerated because of the cream cheese & sour cream in the filling. My family enjoyed them a little warm from the oven....very yummy. I'm sure they'll be just as delicious tomorrow morning when they're all cooled off & set.

My mother used to make this when I was a kid!!  My siblings and I actually used to request she make this as opposed to getting a birthday cake!!  Quick and easy to make.  DELICIOUS, too.  I think you can taste the lemon juice so I omit that, but it is still yummy.

It tastes like a croissant(duh!), taking away from the full "danish" flavor, but they're so good, I have to give 5 stars. I used the slice & bake version, like many previous reviewers & halved the cream cheese mixture. I even have about 1/8c leftover. I topped some w/cherry pie filling. I was worried how the leftovers would hold up but I ate so many of these the first day, there aren't too many left to worry about! Thank you!!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar, and omitted the confectioners sugar topping. It was still delicious. My husband usually doesn't eat breakfast, but he could not resist this danish when he smelled it baking in the oven. I will make this recipe again and again!

amazing-- I used reduced fat crescent roll dough, fat free sour cream and half sugar, half splenda to lighten it up a bit. it was still absolutely delicious. be careful with oven times as this is easy to burn.

I was really disappointed with this.  The filling is WAY too much, there's no way you could pick it up and eat it like a regular danish without the filling slopping out everywhere.  Also, the crust turned out more soggy than flaky, and did not look good - the seams were still visible even after pinching them together as the recipe described.   The taste was good though - kind of like cheesecake between two layers of bread.  But the overall appearance and excessive filling is so bad I won't even send the leftovers in to my husband's work.  I may try this again sometime with modifications, but I'm not in any hurry.

I followed the suggestions of other in cutting the filling in half, as well as, slicing the dough into rounds.  Both of these alterations really worked great for me.  I was only able to fill each dough round with 1/2 Tbsp of the filling, and still managed to use all the filling.  I'm already recommending this recipe to my friends.  Thanks for all the help everyone in really perfecting this recipe!

Talk about easy! And very tasty! I will work on presentation a little more next time as I think they could be a little more "pretty".  I think I will try cutting the rounds instead.  But for how quick and easy this was you really can't go wrong! Thank you!

I love cream cheese danish, but was always very disappointed with the store / bakery bought item.  There seemed to be 3/4 pastry and only 1/4 filling.  Well, needless to say, I came across this recipe and have been making it for years now.  I LOVE it.  My whole family LOVES it.  Anytime I need to bring a dessert, I bring this and it is usually the first thing to disappear and I can't leave without most everyone asking for the recipe!  It is so easy to make, yet everyone thinks I spent hours creating it!  My kids love to make it too.  I highly recommend this....trust me, you won't be disappointed!

Those of you who think there is too much filling aren't cream cheese lovers. I thought about halving the filling, but didn't & I am glad that I didn't. I think without that much cream cheese it would of just tasted like a crescent roll. I had a bit too much crescent roll, maybe it was just the brand or that it was 10.1 ounces who knows. I just trimmed it off. The only thing I changed was I added about a tablespoon of the filling to the topping....very good!!! I didn't wait for it to cool before trying.. though I am thinking it will taste better that way..we shall see!

These were great!  I made them as written and thought there would be too much filling, as other reviewers mentioned, but they were perfect.  I may try adding some jam or pie filling next time.

SO FAST and easy!  I followed the recipe, but substituted non-dairy cream cheese and sour cream (tofutti) for the real stuff.  I only made half of the filling and it was perfect for 2 cans of dough.  I just patted the dough into the pan, poured the filling in and laid the other rolls on top.  It looked great with the filling peeking through.  I spooned on some strawberry jam after it was cool.

Turned out very well. I used the majority of the filling, but then spread raspberry preserves on top. Didn't really care for the icing, but it ended up being a big hit with the fiancee and the party that I brought it too! Can't wait to try more variations!

i must have done something wrong because no one seems to have had the trouble i did. I followed the recipe and cooked until golden on top (24 minutes) and after cooling and cutting, the bottom layer of crescents was raw! I put them back in the oven and they ended up tasting okay but they fell apart(way too much filling) I may try again with less filling and either making rounds as others did or precooking the bottom layer before adding the filling.

My husband and I both thought these were ok at best. While the filling itself was pretty good (I halved it as suggested by others), I don't think the crescent rolls work very well for this recipe. Puff pastry might make these better. A cup of glaze also seemed like way too much. I made half a cup and tasted it before putting it on the danish. I'm glad I did because I didn't like it at all and wound up throwing it away. I think it's safe to say I won't be making these again.

Did half the cream cheese mixture and added one can of strawberry pie filling.  Did not do the glaze as we thought the pie filling would make it sweet enough.  Very pleased, extremely easy...will definitely make again.

This recipe was a hit on Christmas morning.  I found that there was too much filling for the pastry, so I saved some and made another danish using just one roll of Crescent dough divided in half.

So delicious!Definitely only use 1/2 of the filling, all of it would have been way too much. Followed the first reviewer's comments and it came out great! I also added almond extract to the glaze topping. Next time I will add raspberry preserves to the filling too!

This is good, my hubbie loved it, but I would love to find an old fashioned recipe that you make from scratch...I can't find any that suggest a recipe that you have to work for, just short cuts, like Pillsbury cresent rolls.  Thanks, though, yummy....

I added homemade blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese. It was A LOT of cream cheese, probably too much to have added another filling. So far the upper crust seems too moist still but the outside is on the verge of being overdone, could be the juices from the blueberries. The icing also needs a little more milk. I will update tomorrow when my husbands unit tries it!

Ok, the 119th Artillery had it gone in seconds, now I will have to make it again so I can try it, which will happen soon!!

I make this alot for my husband, he LOVES it.I can offer a few changes.  I only use one 8 oz. cream cheese. Also, I fork beat one egg white with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and spread this on top prior to baking. This gives it a wonderful cruncy topping.  It is also great if you add slivered almonds on top after the egg mixture.

This was wonderful!  I made a half danish in a 10x5 pan (or somewhere thereabouts) using just one pks of rolls and scaling back the filling accordingly.  Threw a couple of plops of cherry preserves inside and WOW!  So delicious.  I actually made it twice this weekend.

This recipe is delicious!  I, like others only use half of the filling.  After I mix it together I add about 2 TBSP of homemade raspberry jam to the filling. They turn out great every time.

I took this out of the oven after 20 minutes because it looked perfect.  But the dough was a little limp - I would have preferred it to be crisper.  Part of my problem could have been the store brand crescent rolls.  I had a difficult time even unrolling the dough, and it looked dry and old.

I made this recipe for a breakfast at work. I actually used low-fat cream cheese and light sour cream. It was delicous. Everyone said that it tasted to good to low-fat!!

This was easy to make, but I think it could've tasted a little better.  It was also a pain to cut and serve, I wasn't really sure how to do it without making a mess.

I made this recipe and after it came out of the over and was cooled and iced I ate a piece. It has a funny taste to me. Not sure what it was. I cut it in seperate pieces and wrapped and put in the fridge. After the 3rd day in the fridge, I heated some in the microwave . It was delicious after it sat. I don't know why. I am looking for a recipe that taste exactly like the one you buy in the bakery.

This is an easy and awesome recipe.  It is very sweet though.  I took them to Sunday school for breakfast and was asked by many people for the recipe.  It was a huge hit.  I served them with another dish that was not so sweet to have a good balance.  It turned out great.  I definitely recommend this dish, and I know I'll be making them again real soon.

I wasn't sure that I was going to like this recipe, since it had canned crescent rolls in it. I was very pleasantly surprised, though...I thought these were delicious, and they were very easy to make. I took them to a Bible study and was repeatedly asked for the recipe, so I wasn't the only person that liked them. I will make these again and again! :)

Delicious with half as much filling and half as much icing as called for.  Also added a dash of almond flavoring to icing, thanks for the tip Kaye Lynn.  Can be topped with toasted slivered almonds.

I love cream cheese so I thought I would give this recipe a whirl.  It was great!  My family loved it and ate practically the whole tray at one sitting. I cant wait to try it with fruit preserves or pie filling.

We cut the recipe in half and it was still plenty for the family (5) and was a huge success.  We rolled the dough to thin it out some and used a smaller baking dish.  Also, you may notice that the crescents on the inside of the roll are smaller than the outer layer.  We placed the smaller layer on top of the cream cheese mix.

This was very good.  I rated it four stars, not because of the taste, but the ease of making the cutest little danishes, that really did taste well for the amount of time put in! I made it exact, but sliced the cresent rolls, very nice suggestion! The filling is AWESOME but the cresent rolls didn't do it for me at all.  I will definately keep this recipe for a breakfast/brunch get-together because it makes alot and it's so easy to put together. (because I sliced the cresent rolls, I baked them at 350 for only 10 min.  Next time I will bake at 325 and check after ten min - they cooked pretty fast).

I was worried crescents would taste like crescents, but these  taste purely like cheese danishes--and good ones, at that!  I'm a "from scratch" girl, but these are so great as is, I can't see any advantage to making them from scratch.  Definitely easy ('though not all that quick) and good enough for company.   (I used the slicing method, making about 40 danishes with 1T or less of filling each.  Otherwise, I did not alter the recipe, and would not recommend doing so. I had some filling leftover, but not enough to recommend cutting the recipe in half.)

I made the Danish this morning and it smelled soooo good! We really liked the recipe. The only thing I would change is double the crescent rolls and make two pans with the same amount of filling. It was a little too much for us but a great special Sunday breakfast!

LOVED IT! I used Neufchâtel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese and although this was really good, I felt guilty eating it because of the amount of cream cheese it had in it. You won't be missing anything (besides the quantity) by reducing the amount by half, as others have suggested.

well... i was really looking forward to this one, and although it was good, it wasn't as good as i'd hoped it would be.  it was alright, but nothing exciting at all.  bottom "crust" was very soft, but that was okay (i didn't prebake it like some others did.)  it was impossible (at least for me) to get the top "crust" on so i made strips, thinking that'd work.  i ended up with LOTS of filling (which i didn't mind, even though others complained about that) and not much "crust."  i added melted raspberry jam on top of the cream cheese, and THAT part was good at least.  overall, a good flavor, but really bad presentation and not very good texture.  because it was so easy, i may try again rolling it into individual "rolls" like some people did.  maybe that would alleviate the "soggy mush" problem.

WOW! If I could give this 10 stars I would. This was so easy to prepare, and delicious! I too, like other reviewers put a can of strawberry pie filling in it. I can't wait to make it again, and try other fruit fillings. Thankyou, this ones a keeper!

My boyfriend loved this (I thought it was great too)!!  I did not make the glaze and I am glad that I didn't because I think it would have made it too sweet (and I love sweet).  Great recipe, definitely a keeper.

Extremely easy to make. Very tasty. Husband loved it.  I probably should have baked mine a little longer as the filling was a bit on the soft/runny side. It's better if eaten right out of the fridge.  Taste was still excellent.  Had to add a little more liquid to icing.  Will make again. (and again, and again :)

Tasted good- you can't go wrong with the cream cheese filling, but the taste of the dough still had that strong canned flavor.  Maybe a different dough next time!

This was SO YUMMY!  I did decide to just dust the top with confectioner's sugar instead of the icing.  Everyone loved it.

My husband LOVED this!  I even liked it alot and I don't usually like cream cheese desserts.  I followed the recipe.  Mixed cream cheese mixture with an electric mixer until smooth.  Didn't need to bake bottom layer first like some reviewers mentioned.  Mine came out great...and I'm NOT a good cook!  Absolutely the best after being refrigerated.  Recipe made alot of frosting but it was really tasty so use generously.

Like some others, I'm just not that impressed. I baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes like someone suggested. If you are to make this, I would suggest letting the cream cheese come to room temp & thoroughly blend with the sugar, etc. until SMOOTH. (I didn't like the lumps that resulted from merely dicing the cream cheese.)

I'm sorry, but we did not like this at all.  With all the rave reviews I was expecting something MUCH better.  It may have been better if the filling were a bit sweeter, but even that may not make up for the taste of the crescent roll dough.  It's just not a good combination.

These were really good!  I did use half the filling as suggested in other reviews but otherwise made the recipe exactly.  I lined the baking pan with foil then a layer of parchment paper. Husband loved them.  This is a keeper.

This recipe did not work for me, the bottom of the danish had started to burn after only 10 minutes, will try again with a teflon coated pan and see if I have better luck.  I did use 2 rolls of crescent dough and only 1 pkg of cream cheese and still had quite a bit of the cheese mixture left over, as it does make a lot of filling.

This tasted just like McDonalds cream cheese danish.  My kids and husband went nuts over this recipe.  I took the advice of others and cut the cream cheese mixture in half and also used 1/4 cup of splenda sugar blend for baking.  I may even try less sugar blend next time.  Thanks Natalie.  A keeper for sure!

This was easy! I will say that. My faimly like it, but it just tasted like store bought can cressent rolls. I guess maybe i should find a better brand. I would also cut down on the cream cheese mixture. It did seem like way too much and maybe add a little fruit spread or something. I will make it again, trying new ways cause like i said my faimly did enjoy it.

Very good.  Although I cut the recipe in half for a 9x9 pan, I stuck with the measurements.  Unlike other people, I did not think it was too much cream cheese.  I wouldn't change the proportions - and next time- even though it is only my husband & myself, I'll make the whole batch!  It went fast.

Very Good! Easy to make! I didn't halve the cream cheese filling and it was good - my family likes a lot of cream cheese, so it worked out well for us, but gage it according to your own tastes.  I also doubled the amount of powdered sugar drizzle since my family likes a lot of icing! Excellent breakfast dish! I would recommend putting a variety of preserves on the side vs. inside the danish so everyone can choose what they'd like (with each serving!). A keeper! Thanks for the post!

I doubled the recipe, and ended up using about 60/40 of the mixture in each.  The one with less filling definitely turned out yummier; the one with more filling was too soggy.  Very delish for a potluck breakfast!

Wonderful recipe.  Very similair to "Cream cheese bars II", but probably a bit better.  And I do agree with the others.  I suggest cutting the filling content in half.

What a delicious treat this was for a quick breakfast when we had overnight company. I made just half the recipe and added boysonberry jam to the filling before putting the crust on top. I will definitely make this many times as it is the easiest breakfast treat I've made.

Great! Easy to make, with ingredients that you can "have on hand".  This is very sweet, but I still used the "frosting" as it wouldn't have been very pretty without it!

Great breakfast/brunch/dessert item.  Didn't do glaze or any other topping, but a light dusting of powdered sugar would be more than enough sweetness.  Used only 8 oz of cream cheese and halved the sugar...kept the vanilla extract and lemon juice in stated quantities.  I'll probably reduce the sugar a bit more next time.  I baked in an 11x7 pan and it fit nicely.  You could also place on a cookie sheet and seal the edges to keep filling contained.  As soon as I find a topping similar to Entenmann's cream cheese danish, I'll be in heaven!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was the best danish ever!  DEFINATELY CUT THE PORTION IN HALF!!!  I cut it in half and still made it in a 11x13 pan.  However I didn't have two cans of the cresent rolls, so I used regular buttermilk bisquits on top, buy taking each one and peeling it in half, then laying on top.  It really helped to portion the servings and it looked great too!

This recipe was a hit at my garden club brunch.  I made the filling with fat-free cream cheese, but it still tasted very rich and creamy, and nobody could tell.  I sprinkled the filling with chopped pecans.  I thought the combination of lemon juice and vanilla extract sounded a little strange, but it was delicious!  I'll definitely make this again.

This is such a yummy recipe and its a crowd pleaser for special occasions or any day.  Instead of the glaze, I top mine with cherry pie filling.  You will love this one!
