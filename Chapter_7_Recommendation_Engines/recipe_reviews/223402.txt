I did not have any Mountain Dew, but I did find a can of grapefruit beer in the fridge. It worked rather well and the buns disappeared in seconds. Yum

I made these exactly as the recipe said. They taste delicious and I will try them again! My only issue was that the liquid poured over the top didn't all soak in so they were soggy on the bottom. Next time I think I will try to bake it at a lower temp and for longer.

12.19.15  Unfortunately, I didn’t hear the timer go off, the rolls overbaked, the topping cooked  down, and the rolls stuck to the bottom of the baking dish...my bad, my fault, not the recipe’s!!  So I’ve posted a less than attractive photo of this tasty recipe.  Next time I make them (there will be a next time), I’ll upload a better photo.  In spite of my screwing up Jenny’s recipe, they were easy to make, and tasted wonderful.  The store had Pillsbury® Honey Butter Crescent Rolls, so that’s what I used.    Decadent for sure, but worth a splurge every now and then.
