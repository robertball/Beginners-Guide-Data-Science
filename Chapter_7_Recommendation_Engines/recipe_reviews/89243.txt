Wow - This recipe is awesomely yummy! I made a few changes like adding 1/2 pkg Pace taco seasoning into the flour the chicken is dredged in (I also put a little into the rice mixture), only used 1 can black beans (this is to compromise with my non-bean loving husband) and cutting back on the tomatoes (for my non-tomato loving daughter). I used white basmati rice instead of the rice mix. I served with a little grated Colby-Jack melted on top. Thanks so much for this recipe, I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

This is fabulous!  Made it for dinner tonight, with a few changes, and it is a new family favorite.  Very easy 1 skillet recipe!  I agree with those who cubed chicken for easy cooking/serving.  We didn't have the exact ingredients, and wanted to halve the recipe, so we used corn with peppers/Mexicorn, diced tomatoes with jalapeno (for a little kick), no green chiles, just 1 can of black beans, and 2 very large chicken breasts.  This fed 2 adults 2 servings, and we have just under half left over.

I diced my chicken and opted not to dredge it in flour. This was good, but we felt like it was a bit bland. It could use some taco seasoning to kick it up

This recipe is delish!  Made exactly as stated except used green pepper instead of red.  Tastes like a restaurant recipe!  Even better the days after. My husband wouldn't have given it 5 stars but he's not a veggie guy.  =(  The only thing I wish I'd have known was how HUGE a batch this made.  It's not for "just the two of us" unless you both love it and could eat it for a few days.

Totally delicious! Fiancee went back for seconds. He said it was 'totally awesome'. I only used two chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces. I also only used 1/2 cup frozen corn. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. This does make a ton of food though. Be prepared for leftovers unless you're a family of 6 good eaters. We're planning on putting this in tortillas with salsa tomorrow. Excellent easy dinner!

Before I mention how delicious this recipe is, a word about yellow rice. Here in Florida, yellow rice is almost a staple, but if you can't find it, just mix some saffron or saffron seasoning to the dry rice -- there is your yellow rice.  I always have to thank the reviewers. Based on their suggestions I seasoned the chicken with Beau Monde, salt and pepper and garlic, and cut the chicken into pieces after browning, and didn't dredge the chicken in flour.  I omitted the cayenne; we like spice, but it doesn't like us. I also added cumin and a small amount of curry powder.  I used a trinity mix from Publix (onion, green peppers and celery) instead of just chopped onions.  I think they call that the "holy trinity" in Louisiana cooking.  Wonderful!  I listed it as a favorite in my database.

Good recipe. Substituted brown rice for the yellow rice.  Had to cook a bit longer and add a little more chicken broth. Just diced my chicken breast and sauted in a little olive oil. Didn't dredge in flour.Good, filling and pretty healthy. will make again. thanks!

excellent recipe and very easy to make. i found it to be very flavorful and healthy too. i used brown rice to make it, didn't bother dredging the chicken and only added one can of pinto beans as i halved the recipe. omitted the cayenne and added a dash of cumin. no unnecessary fats and plenty of protein and good carbs. my kids and hubby loved it.

Yummy!  I cut my chicken up into pieces and did not use flour.  It turned out great.  I only used 2 chicken breasts and some pinto beans I had in the freezer.  I have to say that I have enough leftovers for 4 hefty servings after what my husband and I ate tonight.  It makes a lot!  Very good though and healthy.  I topped it with avocado and my husband added sour cream and avocado.  He loved it!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My brother and I cooked this last night for our parents and it was DELICIOUS! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except for exchanging green pepper for red since that's what we already had around. The cilantro and the green chilies really gave it a wonderful flavor. It was so easy to make, even a total novice chef like me didn't mess it up! I am totally going to make this again and again! Thanks!

This is so delicious!  I have made it a couple of times and ate it all!  I love the cilantro taste.  There are not too many chicken dishes that are good reheated, but this one is great!  I always use Zataran's yellow rice.

This recipe is fabulous!  The chicken was very tender, and the rice mixture was so good!  I was surpised at how spicy it was since the only thing really spicy in the ingredients was the cayenne pepper.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only changes I made was using an orange pepper instead of a red one since that's what I had on hand, and using instant white rice rather than yellow.  I plan to make this often!

Made this last night - kids didn't like - husband thought OK.  It was way better the next day.  Melted shredded cheddar cheese on top and added sour cream - delicious!  Brought the left overs to work.  Co-workers are asking for recipe.  I cubed the chicken instead of using whole breast.  Makes it easier to serve.

excellent! for half recipe:  1/2 cup dried black & 1/2 cup dried brown beans, cooked. 1 cup rice. 1 cup corn. 3 chile peppers. Use 2 cups broth b/c of brown rice. and it takes longer, of course.

I didn't add the corn or beans... and I used regular tomatoes instead of stewed. Great turnout. I will be eating the leftovers tomorrow!

I used fresh tomatoes (8 plum) and added yellow curry powder. Everyone loved it! I don't think the flour on the chicken made any difference, will make it without it next time.

This is a great dish.  Now yes I did you a major tweek.  I had leftover chicken and rice which I used and it worked great.  The only liquid change I had done was reduce the broth to 1/4 to 1/2 cup.  Everything else was as written.  Great dish in so many ways.

This was quick and easy, and a nice recipe to have because I usually have all of these ingredients on hand. I added a little cumin for a Mexican taste. I couldn't taste the cilantro in the dish though. Next time I will not cook it for 30 minutes, but rather just stir it in before serving.

I have never tried a top stove type of chicken and rice dish, and all I can say is, "WOW!" The seasoning is excellent, and my husband said it tastes just like something his hispanic grandmother used to make (high praise indeed).  Since we have younger kids I used the green chiles, but jalepenos would have been good in this, too.    I omitted one can of the tomatoes (only used one 14 oz can), and I'm glad I did.  The rice seemed like it was going to be too soupy, but it was fine once it cooled off and rested a bit.  I think one more can would have been too much.  I think next time I may go ahead and add the second can, but maybe offset that with a handful of minute rice in the dish.      This will now be a staple dish in our home.  Great convenience in that it's a one pan meal, served with a little dollop of sour cream and sliced avocado, yet offers great taste, and leftovers!  Highly recommend!

Very good, but next time I'll go w/ my gut (or orig. recipe) and skip subbing brown rice for yellow. We were SO impatient to eat (smelled so divine!) and brown rice just takes foreeeeeever to cook. It definitely needs a big heaping handful of cilantro b4 serving, b/c putting the cilantro in during the simmer kinda tames the flavor, and I  cilantro. I also skipped the flouring of the chicken and instead did a quick marinade in Trader Joe's black pepper sauce, for the win! Halved the recipe for me, husband, and toddler, and we still had leftovers, so I'm glad that I only went w/ a 15 oz. can diced tomatoes, 1 can Mexi-corn, and 1 can Kidney Beans. Great recipe that I can't wait to do again!

Very nice recipe. Just used regular white rice with turmeric to make yellow rice. The 2nd time I made it with brown rice and crushed tomatoes, very good also and cooked it in the rice cooker. I just sauteed the onion, garlic and bell pepper in a little bit of olive oil in a regular pot, and then added that to the rice cooker along with the other ingredients. I boiled chicken and cubed it instead of frying it.

My husband loves this recipe, he likes me to make it often. I did make some changes. I cut up 2 lbs of chicken breast into bite size pieces, put into a crock pot along with the diced onion, red bell pepper, garlic, one 15oz can chicken broth, one 15oz can stewed tomatoes, pinto beans, black beans, corn and chile peppers (I didn't drain any of them). One bunch cilantro chopped, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. I cooked it on high for 4 hours. I made my own spanish rice. Brown 2 cups of long grain rice in a frying pan on high with oil. After the rice is brown, add 5 cups of water, 4 tablespoons ketchup, 1/4 onion diced, 2 tablespoons parsley, add salt to taste. Bring to a boil, cover and lower heat. Simmer for 25 to 30 minutes until all the water is gone. Put the rice on a plate and add the chicken mixture on top. Excellent meal and soooo easy to make.

This is pretty good, however, I made a few changes. I did not flour & fry the chicken. I opted to cut into bite sized pieces and saute with the garlic & onion. Instead of canned chiles, I used 4 small fresh "chile relleno" peppers from my garden. I also used small red, orange, and yellow bell peppers since I had a bag of them. Additionally, I used dried cilantro only because I did not have fresh. And, 1 1/2 cup white rice instead of the yellow. I did not use cayenne pepper. Oh, and frozen corn instead of canned corn. Once it started boiling, it only took about 20 minutes to cook the rice & serve. I will definitely make again.

My husband absolutely loved this! So flavorful -- and easy to make. The only change I made was to use leftover rice, which I added just in the last few minutes, long enough to get heated through. Oh, and I added the cilantro right at the end too, rather than have it cook for 30 min. YUM!

Fabulous recipe with or without modification, it's all according to your personal taste. Simply added  1 tsp of taco seasoning for a bit of extra kick, and finished the dish with a generous drizzle of fresh squeezed lime juice. A very fresh and aromatic chicken dish- delicious!

Will deffinstly make this again.  I stewed my own fresh tomatos is the chicke broth and added a signifigant amount of green onion tops, 3 bannana peppers and 1 cyan pepper all from my garden to the pepper and oninn mixture.  I also used regular white rice insted of yellow. Served it with sweet cornbread. We had more than enough to eat it the following night too!!!

This was pretty good. I cut everything in half and didn't add the pinto beans or the chile peppers. I think I would use white rice next time or something. The yellow rice turned out crunchy for some reason.

Not worth remaking. This is one of the first times I haven't tinkered with a recipe and it was the wrong time to do so. It makes alot of food - I used three large chicken breasts sliced into 8 cutlets, plus I had 3 random chicken legs. I am hoping my family will eat the leftovers as burritos with some cheese and sour cream. Might make it worthwhile?

since having a baby, i am a big fan of 1 pan meals. this large recipe is great for leftovers or freezing & reheating. i omitted the flour, substituted brown rice & frozen corn, & did not drain any of the canned ingredients & it turned out great. i would recommend adding your own personal seasonings to give a little more flavor. next time, i may save 1/2 of the cilantro (i used a whole bunch) to add at the end for a bit of color.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious!!  I did not add the red pepper (didn't have any),black beans or corn. I used Uncle Ben's long grain rice. It was fabulous just the way I prepared it and thankfully, my whole family loved it as well.  I melted shredded mexican cheese over the top of the chicken for my sons. I highly recommend this recipe, especially if you are a Mexican food lover!!

We thought this was delicious! I cut the chicken into large chunks and omitted the green chilies. We ate this topped with sour cream, green onions and more cilantro. Served with tortillas and hot sauce....yum!

Yum Yum! A few minor changes.  I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed in a packet of taco seasoning with the  (wheat)flour for flavor.  I used onion powder instead of onion (hubby prefers), zatarains yellow rice (box, it was all i could find), I omitted the tomatoes (sis prefers), only used the pinto beans (and did not drain, to add more liquid for the rice), used a 'bunch' of cilantro, and cumin and chili powder instead of the cayenne. When it was all done I sprinkled some mexican cheese on top, it looked so pretty! i took a picture, i will upload soon.  Hubby requested black beans next time, he said it would go better with the meal and sis said maybe some tortilla strips or crumbles would be nice on top so i will try that next time.  My three year old ate two servings!

This picture doesn't do the recipe justice.  This was wonderful.  I served to a lady from Costa Rica and she said it tasted just like home.  My 5 year old son loved it too.  I left out the chili peppers and we served them on the side. Great leftover too.  I will definatly make this again.

Good recipe.  I used four chicken breasts (seasoned well with salt and pepper) but kept the rest of the ingredients as written for eight servings.  I intentionally made alot so that we would have leftovers to wrap in tortillas with guacamole and cheese the next day.  :)

very simple, great flavor. My 2 year old even ate it.  I used long-grain white rice, added extra water, & it was still crunchy after simmering for 1 hour. Next time, I won't drain the beans, corn, or green chilis for the extra liquid.

I ran across this wonderful recipe, when I was looking for a last minute idea for supper.  I did have to modify the recipe some to match the items I had on hand, but the family loved it regardless.  I didn't have the yellow rice, so I rinsed some white basmanti rice in water for about a minute and half and then sauteed in oil in a medium-hot skillet until golden brown.  I added a can of rotel and some chicken broth to the rice and simmered until tender about 20 minutes.  Meanwhile in a second pan, I cooked the onion, garlic and about a 1/2 tsp of cumin.  I added 2 cans of canned chicken breast that I had previously lightly rinsed and coated with taco seasoning.  Then added frozen corn, the black beans and another separate can of rotel.  I warmed all the ingredients together and added the rice mixture when it was done.  I didn't have cilantro, but next time I will be sure to have some because I am sure it would improve the flavor.  Anyways, the kids ate it with tortillas, and told me to be sure and write this down so I could make it again.  Husband loved it too and said it was about the right amount of heat for him.  Thanks for this tasty and versatile recipe! Will definitely make again...

This recipe is absolutely awesome! I made it for 4 servings and by the time I was done my roommate was already checking to see if I had enough ingredients left over to make her own batch! 
I definitely recommend cutting down on the cayenne and chili.

5/2010 Update:Have made the several times, this time I used the recipe for Chipoltle Marinated Chicken with chicken breasts and grilled them and cut them into small pieces...OMG! Now it's a 10 star recipe!The only thing I did differently was to add leftover chicken and some cumin. I also added the cilantro in at the end to keep it green and fresh tasting.  It does make a lot but my kids have already asked me to make another batch!  They loved it!

Even my cilantro-hating fiance likes this recipe. Just be careful, because this recipe makes a LOT of food (especially since I only cook for two). That's okay with us, though, because we love the leftovers through the rest of the week.

4 stars for the flavor profile.  I do not care for beans so used celery, but did not rate the recipe based on that.

Loved it. Left out green pepper just because I didn't have one on hand. Already had everything else and was specifically looking for something to use a ton of leftover yellow rice with. Husband threw some jalapeños in his and liked it even more. Fantastic dish!

Great dish! My husband loved it! I took another reviewer's suggestion and added taco seasoning to the flour and cut the chicken into bite size pieces. I left out the cayenne pepper because my kids were going to be eating it. Topped it off with a little cheddar cheese, sour cream, and avocado slices! Yummy!

I made this tonight and even my "bean-hating" child loved it! Made it just like the recipe (except maybe added extra cilantro- I didn't measure but put in a bunch...I love the stuff) and we wouldn't change a thing. Makes a lot and I've got enough for lunch tomorrow too! yay!

This was simple and delicious - a great way to use up cilantro. I only used 3 chicken breasts (so obviously I cut down the amount of flour), which I cut into strips, just preference; and I eliminated the pinto beans. I'm glad I did because the meal cooked perfectly. I'm not sure how the rice would have turned out with an extra can of beans. I will be eating the leftovers for lunch.

We really enjoyed this yummy recipe. I used the meat from one rotisserie chicken. We had it for lunch, and had enough left over for dinner, but jazzed it up a bit. My mom used what was left to fill ten large tortillas, rolled them up, then poured a can of Progresso cheesy chicken soup over it, baked it, and it was fabulous!

Great recipe.  I adjust as many others did and omit the flour and cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, also use green peppers because that is what I have most of the time.  We like spicy so I usually add a few jalapeno peppers.  My husband is not much of a chicken person normally, (and before this dish said he didn't like black beans) but he loves cilantro and garlic which is why I tried this.  He now  will tell me if it has been too long since I made this dish, which is why I am making it again for dinner tonight.  Distinctive flavors and definitely makes a ton of food, which is great since it is just as good if not even better the next day for lunch.

This is crazy good!  I strongly suggest using a ceramic or enameled stoneware for this - really gets the flavors going.  I used brown rice for a healthier twist - just add an extra 1/2 cup or so of water and let it simmer for a good hour+.  I used six  chicken thighs on the bone  (I did dredge in flour and brown - note, 2 T of oil is plenty) and one fresh jalapeno pepper in place of the canned chiles.  For color, I chose a yellow pepper instead of red (I figured the red would come from the tomatoes).  If possible, use two fresh ears of corn instead of canned --I grilled them until they were slighty charred and tender and then cut off of the cob--the corn was sweet and crunchy and really dressed up the dish.  Top with fresh slices of avocado and you've got yourself a superb meal--delicious, healthy, very satisfying, low cost to make, and one pot for easy cleanup!

YUM!  This made a lot!  I'm going to take another reviewer's suggestion and roll this up in some tortilla's tonight for leftovers and serve with a side of sour cream and guac.  This has a nice mix of flavors and just the right amount of kick to it.  Pretty healthy dish too!

Excellente! Best thing Ive cooked in a while. I used chipotle instead of chile peppers.   Might be the best thing Ive ever cooked. Well balanced and spicy.

I stumbled upong this recipe over 2 years ago, when I was required to make something using cilantro for a party. My variations are the following: 1) cook the chicken in olive oil (more simpler) 2) cutting the chicken into smaller pieces, rather than one whole chicken breast. 3) use smaller amount of garlic 4)squeeze a fresh lime into it(makes it perfect) or serve with fresh slices of limes (for everyone to add their own)!!! 5) Either eat with a fork or put it into a tortilla for a yummy wrap.  I've remade this recipe many times over the past 2 years and my family loves it!! So glad I found this!

I thought the recipe was very easy to make and good...but I couldn't help thinking that there was something missing. I haven't quite pinpointed what could be added to give it that extra "yum" factor.

I made this dish a few days ago and it was fantastic!  A huge hit!  I made a few minor changes to suit the items that I had on hand, but for the most part I followed the cooking method exactly.  Changes I made, that still tasted wonderful, were: I used white rice, diced tomatoes with chili's in them, all pinto beans (did not have black beans), and dried cilantro (which I added extra of since it was dried). I used Indian cayanne rather than just regular cayanne, and it had a nice kick of spice to it.  Before serving I grated a little Asiago cheese on top.  We all went back for seconds!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I halved it because there were only the two of us to eat it.  I could have quartered it and still had enough for leftovers for days.  I did not change a single item!  Loved it.  Will be making it again tonight!!

Sorry, this was only OK. I followed the recipe exactly except didn't have pinto beans. Towards the end of cooking, I tasted it and then adjusted the seasonings accordingly -- added a little cumin and some curry powder. This helped, but still just didn't have the flavor I had hoped for. The good part was that my sons and husband ate it with no objection, which was in itself a success.

The recipe smelled wonderful until I added the beans. The chicken lacked flavor. Overall, I would recommend adding more of your personal favorite seasonings. The taste was almost bland, despite all the veggies.

As a new member of an organic farm, I was "stuck" with some cilantro.  I found this recipe and was pleased since my husband likes rice and I only had to use one skillet!  I found the yellow rice in the Goya/Mexican section of the food store; it actually came in a yellow colored bag.  I reserved some chicken on the side thinking the recipe would be too strong for our baby; yet she refused to eat her own and wanted ours.  I gave her a small taste and she LOVED it!  The recipe states "serves 8" and it means 8 hearty servings.  I froze some leftovers and it made a great meal a second time.  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.

was OK. too many cans of beans added make it too much. Couldn't find the "yellow rice", so used the short grain while - came out too mushy.

I found it bland and I even added a bit of cumin and chili powder.  I also let it stew too long which made the whole skillet mixture mushy.  I agree with the reviewer who added the cilantro at the end to keep it fresh.

My family liked the blended flavors in this one. We always omit onions in any recipe since no one in the family really likes them, but this recipe had so many other flavors to choose from you didn't need the onions or peppers. I didn't have yellow rice so I substituted whole wheat penne pasta instead. My girls were thankful for the pasta instead of rice. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow after the flavors have blended even more! Thanks JenniferK2

This was the first recipe I've tried at allrecipes.com, and I was very pleased.  I was a little confused about the Rice-a-Roni "yellow rice."  I didn't see that in my store, so I grabbed a box of chicken flavored Rice-a-Roni.  The chicken broth can was just shy of 2 cups, and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the stewed tomatoes.  Make sure to taste test the rice after cooking for 30 minutes, mine was still crunchy.

Overall, this recipe was fantastic, and I will make it again.

I pounded the chicken breast with a mallet and marinated in Caribbean sauce- omitted tomatoes - served over grits instead. (My family’s won’t eat rice for some strange reason).  They loved the corn and pineapple.

This is a very tasty dish and easy to make (love anything that can be done in one pan).   I followed the recipe exactly but used only 4 chicken breasts versus 8.   I used a very large "everyday" pan and it was packed to the brim so I don't think there would have been room for 8!  A delicious meal that I'll make again.  A topping of shredded cheese and sour cream would probably be nice, too!

Like other reviewers, I skipped the flour and diced my chicken to make this easy, tasty meal even easier. One warning: Use a Dutch oven or even a pasta pot instead of a skillet. This makes a metric TON of food. I used half of the required chicken, and it was still more than my biggest skillet could handle.

Make sure to use a very large skillet. This overflowed in my, what I thought was a, large skillet. Very tasty, next time I will cut the chicken up a little bit more and probably pass on the flour.

Makes a big recipe, but really enjoyed it.  Served with Greek yogurt and sliced avocados and added more spice but we like SPICE..  Thanks for sharing

This is delicious. I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot. I used petite diced tomatoes cause that's what I had, and left out the onion and peppers for my kids (still used green chile, fresh though cause I'm in NM!). The only yellow rice I could find was a Zatarans's rice mix which was like a 7oz box, and that was perfect. Will definitely make this again!

An absolutely wonderful, tasty meal!  I, too, used brown rice and adjusted a few other things to suit our taste but this one goes into "one of my favourite meals" category.

This recipe was good should have pre cooked the chicken because the chicken breast was dry.I didn't have green Chile's  so I had jardinera peppers added a little that to the recipe. other than the chicken  being dry it was good.

I cut up the chicken so it was a stew, didn't bother to dredge it in flour, was generous with the cayenne pepper, and I loved it.  Sort of like a mexican inspired stew, full of all sorts of healthy things!

Made this last night and it was a huge hit with my husband and I.  The only thing I omitted was the red bell pepper because my husband does not care for it.  The flavors were great and the chicken was moist and tender.  I topped ours with a pinch more of cilantro and some fresh cut tomatoes.  I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!! My husband absolutely loved this recipe. I stayed true to the recipe except I omitted any salt. I also seasoned the chicken breast with fajita seasonings. I will make this again.

Excellent dish! Used quinoa instead of rice and only used black beans but otherwise followed the recipe. So much flavour!

I added twice the suggested amount of cayenne and my whole family liked with the slight extra kick. The only thing I would perhaps do differently  is to remove the browned chicken to the side and get the rice mix simmering and well stirred before adding the chicken back in. As it was the rice was still a little hard so I took the chicken out near the end and stored temporarily in a covered bowl. All turned out scrumptious at the conclusion.

I used boneless pork chops instead of chicken, and cooked these cubed on the side so as to not overcook the meat in the rice mixture.  I also omitted the onion and used a green pepper in its place. It needed a little adjusting with seasoning, but otherwise was yummy and healthy!

An excellent "stick to your ribs comfort food".  Although I did half the recipe, I also added some diced mushrooms, carrots and celery. Used the whole can of mild green chilies and served Siracha on the side to give it a kick. Super easy one pan meal and added side of steamed broccoli.

I substituted fresh anaheim peppers for the green peppers and deleted the canned jalepenos.  I also melted pepperjack cheese on the top, and sprinkled with more cilantro.  Served with sour cream.

We made this dish last night -- very good. Makes a lot of food, so will have plenty of leftovers for the week! The only changes we did were: 1) added some taco seasoning to the flour mixture (as suggested by others) and 2) used wheat rice instead of yellow rice ----> had to cook an additional 20 minutes for the wheat rice to cook.

I made this for my boyfriend and me, and we both had second helpings.  I didn't have any beans, so I left them out.  I used a green pepper instead of red, and only about half the cilantro, and I didn't have any cayenne pepper.  I added fresh corn, which was a delicious seasonal touch to the meal.  It was way easy (only one pot) and very tasty.  My only complaint was that it didn't reheat well at all. I will make it again, probably with beans next time.

Warned that this makes a huge amount (and not wanting a lot of left-overs), I cut back on the quantity of rice. I eye-balled 5 oz. of the rice. I used regular medium grain rice. I left out the red pepper and pinto beans (didn't have on hand). I added the kernels from a left-over cob of corn. I upped the "heat" with a can of tomato-green chilis. WHEW!! HOT! I made it in my cast iron pan which made the rice kinda crunchy on the bottom. Thank God I didn't add the extra beans and all the rice, it would never have fit in the pan. For a one dish recipe, this is a great jumping-off point. Add... subtract, go for it! PS:If you get a bunch of cilantro, use the whole thing, never mind tablespoons.
