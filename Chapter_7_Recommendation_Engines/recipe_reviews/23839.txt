It drives me crazy when people change the recipe then rate the original recipe! I followed RECIPE EXACTLY...it WAS GREAT! I love pasta salad but never really made my own until this recipe. Since making the original recipe, I have played with it a little, I added green olives also. IT ALWAYS COMES OUT GREAT. Thank you.

This is a great dish, very colorful. I made a few adjstments however. I like to make this salad a day in advance to let the flavors mix together. I add the garlic when i first make it. I also eliminated the peperoni and decreased the salami to 1/4 lb. One pound of meat is too much for this dish. Finally, i use Kraft Roasted Red Peppper with Parmesan dressing. The dressing really makes the salad.

Fantastic!   I omitted almost half of the ingredients and it's still good.  I left out the artichoke, black olives, zucchini, garlic, red onion and salami. I used the KraftsRoasted Red pepper Italian Dressing with Parmesan. I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm trying to allow the flavors a chance to blend.

I thought this was good but not the best I have had.  I felt that there was a little too much meat and cheese.  I would definitely cut that back the next time.

I MADE THIS FOR A PARTY AND IT WAS A BIG HIT!!! I MADE MY OWN ITALIAN DRESSING AND DID NOT ADD THE ZUCCHINI ( RAN OUT OF IT)
I ALSO SOAKED THE ARTICHOKE HEARTS TO GET MOST OF THE VINAGAR TASTE OUT.
WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!!!!!

While the dressing is enough for the noodles, the ratio is off between them and the other ingredients. It was good and I will make again, but only with some changes especially less meat.

I don't even like Pasta Salad but this was Fabulous! I added a little more brocolli, halved grape tomatoes, chopped green pepper and I used "Kraft" Tuscan House Itallian salad dressing and marinade. It is so Yummy!

This is quite good, but the next time I make it, I think I'll leave out the broccoli, it just didn't seem to 'work' in this salad.  I didn't have any salami so I left that out and probably used quite a bit less pepperoni..maybe a bit over 1/4 lb. I can't imagine putting a whole pound of meat in here. Otherwise, it was pretty good!

I have been making this salad for years and it is one of my grown boys' favorites.  You can basically add whatever you want for personal taste. I always add a dry package of zesty Italian dressing as well as Salad Supreme (in the spice dept)  Try it.....it will still be AWESOME

This got better everyday! The flavors were off the chart! I made a mistake and didn't buy enough pepperoni but there was so much else going on that it almost didn't matter!

Very colorful and tasty.  Just the right amount of Italian dressing.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree with other reviewers.  It tastes even better the next day.
