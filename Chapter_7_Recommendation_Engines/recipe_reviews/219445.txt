I ran a small sweet onion (it turned out a little more than a half cup, but not by much) and the garlic clove through the mini-food processor before adding it to this potato salad. I also used dill pickles instead of sweet pickle relish only because we don't care for sweet pickles. It didn't have enough "liquid" for us--I added a quarter cup more of the mayonnaise and a second tablespoon of dijon mustard. This is a great simple potato salad recipe--everyone loved it. Next time, I'll double it and add more garlic. As with any potato salad, the longer it sits, the better it gets.

I'm not a mustard and sweet relish kind of girl when it comes to my potato salad. This proved me wrong. I enjoyed the taste very much and also the fact that it was much ligher than your typical potato salad.

Another winner....thanks for a lighter potato salad! Still a ton of flavor....I did add the yolks to the salad and I did add a spalsh of white vinegar and some low fat buttermilk to thin the dressing a bit. Other than that I really enjoyed this. Also added some fine diced red pepper for color. Thanks!

A great alternative to a heavy mayonnaise based potato salad. This was loaded with flavor and we enjoyed it. I did cut back on the celery to around 3/4 cup and it was perfect for us. Other than that I followed the recipe as is.

I cut the recipe in half but did not measure the celery and onion because I know my family's preferences. I did measure the rest of the ingredients, though. I will admit - it took all I had to not use the egg yolks. When dinner was finished, I don't think I even missed them!

This was a pretty good potato salad but I found it to be a little bland.  I used dill relish instead of sweet relish (because I don't like sweet) so that might have altered the taste. I  defintely thought it needed salt and pepper to season it up a but and would suggest adding your own seasonings to it to give it a little more kick. (Vinegar would be a good addition.) I found the mayo/relish combo to be just the right volume for the salad, unlike other reviewers who said they needed to add more mayo.  I also made this a day ahead of time because potato salad always tastes better the next day!

This is a yummy potato salad. I start mine a day ahead and pour 2 tbls to 1/4 cup sweet pickle juice over the warm potatoes, add the onion and then marinate in the frig over night. I've always gotten rave reviews!

I added real mayo instead of fat-free cuz if my mom found out that I used fat-free mayo she woulda smacked me!!  It came out great , easy to make, made a double batch and it didn't last 24 hours!!

I forgot the mustard and i used natural Greek zero fat yogurt instead of light mayo, cuz even light mayo is high in fat. I used two not one garlic and a half small to medium onion. I added chives and seasonings like jerk seasoning, ginger and vinegar but it was a little bland (probably partly due to no mayo and mustard, and partly cuz i love spicy food and should have added more spice, salt and pepper, maybe a little chilli.) I over did the celery, next time i will chop the celery very very fine and use less. It says i made it 4x but i didn't i just clicked too much on website. Very tasty.

Didn't use sweet pickle relish or garlic.  Used more mayo (homemade).
