I made this last night and I think it turned out great.  There are some changes, however, that I made.  
First,I would saute the celery by itself for about 4 minutes before adding any other vegetables to the pot(this would ensure that it wouldn't be still crunchy at the end of simmering).  I would not add the bacon; cut the 1/4 tsp of white pepper to 1/8th tsp; instead of 5 drops of hot sauce, only add 3, and before simmering for 20 minutes, add 1 1/4 cup of hot water, to make it more of a soup/chowder consistency.  Without adding the water, it would have been way to thick and chuncky for me.  
Overall, my whole family was impressed.  Thank you Allana for a nice recipe.

The recipe needs more clams and I think more bacon.  I will try it again though with these additions.

Alot of work chopping all the ingredients and all the spices, but well worth it.  Like a good chili, it tastes best the next day when all the flavors have blended together.  I used fresh already shucked clams that I bought from a chinese market, so the clams were plentiful and flavorful, not rubbery.  Left out the shrimp since I'm allergic, but probably would taste great.

This was so delicious!! I made it without the bacon, to save some fat from the recipe and because I don't eat meat, and the flavor was still wonderful! I also added a few shrimp that i had that needed to be used up and they were a wonderful surprise while i was eating this soup! I made an entire crock-pot full of this, and my family ate it within two days!!!

Excellent seafood soup. Even better than the one I had on Isla Mujeres. My kids and husband loved it.

I really enjoyed this, I did add more vegetables and spiced it up a bit more with some Cayenne Pepper then about 1/2 cup of heavy cream. We ate some before and after the cream and everyone agreed it was a better texture with it.

We really liked this soup. I have also subbed small bay scallops for the shrimp and it was really good that way too!

LOVED your soup, Allana!  This was perfect for lunch today.  I prepared with just minor tweaks.  I sauteed the bacon in a little cannola oil right in the soup pot and removed, then added the veggies including the potatoes & a spoonful of minced garlic, for their saute, about ten minutes or so.  I then added everything into the soup pot, including the salad shrimp and clams.  Loved all of the spices, fun raiding the spice cabinet.  I did use celery salt for the seasoned salt, no powdered garlic (used minced) and perhaps a little more generous scoops.  I also added a cup of chicken/tomato broth, as I like more broth and simmered this a good two hours covered before serving.  Delish!  As a previous reviewer mentioned, this would also be great with a couple of splashes of heavy cream, perhaps next time to mix it up, but very good (and lower calorie) as-is.  A keeper!

This is great,  I make it in triple batches and freeze it.  Great to warm after work on a cold day.  Highly recommend!

Very good chowder. The only thing I changed was fresh cams instead of canned. A dozen and a half cherry stones  gives a generous amount of clams and just enough juice.

I have always made good red clam chowder. Very traditional. I decided this recipe sounded interesting so I tried it. Doubled it and added some slight modifications such as fresh peeled shrimp ect... Everyone loved it! It was amazing! Left overs didn't last long at all. Probably will never wing my old recipe again!
