This fajita recipe just did not do it for my husband and I. It did not taste bad, however it taste nothing like fajitas, so if you are looking for an authetic tasting fajita I would recommend trying another recipe. I am going to stick with my usual fajita recipe and am going to post it on the site to share with others.

I have been making these for years, I love this recipe. I use 2 green bell peppers and I sometimes use strips of sirloin (1Â½ lbs) instead of chicken. I use a whole carton of sliced fresh mushrooms and for extra flavor, I sometimes add a packet of fajita seasoning as well. Toppings: shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives and sour cream. This is quick, easy and there's just one pan to wash! Use precooked chicken for super easy.

Wonderful! 5 stars! So easy to make. My kids even loved this they are 8 and under. I left out the mushrooms because my kids dont like them.  We had no left overs..my husband ate 4. I used dry italian mix recipe from this site.

This was great! I had a couple of pieces of sirloin steak(raw) and I used that instead of chicken. I cut it in strips and marinated it in a big storage bag with liquid zesty Italian dressing for a few hrs. I didn't use mushrooms because my family hates them. I used extra onions and peppers because I had more than 2 cups of meat. The liquid marinade cooked down nicely and when I added the dry dressing mix it just made the flavor POP. Everbody chowed down on these and I will definately make them again. We also had spanish rice and fat free refried beans.

I added some salsa to taste in the skillet when the chickenwas just done being cooked and just used half the amount of Italian seasoning that was suggested. It was delicious!

These make chicken wraps - not fajitas. Italian seasoning has no business in Mexican food. Scrap the seasoning packet and add cumin, onion powder and chili powder to your chicken followed by a squeeze of lime and then you will be a little closer to a fajita. These are bland.

This recipe was great. I have never had fajitas, but my roommates convinced me to try them. I usually hate peppers and was a little skeptical. The Italian seasoning really tasted great along with the chicken and veggies, I will definitely make this again!

The recipe was definately easy.  I found it's important not to overcook the vegetables.  I think the chicken tastes best marinated and cooked on the grill. I just didn't like the flavor that the italian seasoning gave it.  I would try it again with a different seasoning.  Two easy sides, mexican/spanish rice and refried beans.

This is a great recipe, one I will definitely use again!  I cut round round steak into slices and grilled it with the chicken, before adding to the mixture.  That provided a char broiled flavor and appearance to the meat.  Mixing the chicken and beef was fun too.  My mother-in-law can't chew very well, so chicken worked well for her.  The rest of us used a combination of the two meats!  I also grilled a few tomatoes.  I served this with "Easy Guacamole," another allrecipes submission.  An excellent meal!

I thought this recipe was quite tasty. I think I would shred the chicken from cold cooked chicken breast next time for the diced pieces fell out of the tortilla.

These were not only super delicious but SO quick & easy! I had leftover steak in the fridge, so I sliced that thin and used in place of the chicken. I added just a touch of chili powder for a bit more spice as well. I served them with cheddar cheese, sour cream & salsa. What a great recipe....this one is a keeper for sure!!!

To kick it up a notch......use a very hot cast iron skillet to "grill" red onions, red, orange and green peppers.  Add dash of garlic salt, chipolte chili powder, cilantro and cumin while they cook.  Substitute mushrooms with halved cherry tomatoes and sliced jalapenos.  Grill marinated chicken cut into slices.  Serve with salsa, cheese  and sour cream.

I've been making this recipe all the time since i found it on here a few years ago.  It immediatly became our house favorite.  My husband always requests it for special occasions and it's sooo easy I don't argue.  I dice the peppers and onion and don't put mushrooms because my family doesn't like them.  I also add a little water to activate the dressing mix.  I've let it slow cook on the stove for 30 minutes before as well.  This makes the chicken really moist.  We sprinkle a little cheese on top and eat it up!  There's never left overs.

did not at all care for this recipe.  To me, fajitas NEED fajita seasoning.  Always willing to try new recipes, but for me, just didn't do it.  Thank you for the recipe anyway.

This recipe is o.k. but this isn't how you'd make real fajitas. The meat should be marinated (usually lime juice is one of the ingredients). Fajitas were orignally made w/ skirt steak and needed to be marinated to be tenderized. This is really chicken with sauteed pepper/onion but misses the southwestern/mexican or tex-mex flare the italian seasoning totally didn't work for me. Bring on the Cilantro and some pico de gallo.

I thought this would be a great quick fix, but it actually took a little longer than I expected and was not very good. The italian dressing mix just doesn't jive with the mexican theme of this recipe. Don't waste your time (or ingredients) with this one.

This was my first time making fajitas. I used skirt steak in place of the chicken and I added cheddar cheese and sour cream to the recipe. Very simple and will make again. Thanks for sharing.

These were quick, but hardly fabulous. I did not care for the Italian dressing at all. Italian dressing? Hello, where's the pico de gallo, cilantro, and lime flavor? I only made this because I had all the ingredients on hand. I did use pita bread, which was a little different (but hardly authentic). I won't be making this again, sorry.

I was attracted to this recipe because it seemed simpler than making a marinade and letting chicken/beef sit over night but I found that by cutting corners I was cutting out flavor.

We loved this recipe!  I will always make my fajitas this way.  To save time I used a rotisserie chicken from Publix and shredded the chicken and it tasted great!  Even my 6 year old daughter loved it.  Thank you.

I was in a pinch to make beef fajitas, not realizing I didn't have my usual mix on hand.  Forget the mix!  The salad dressing did the trick and it was quite tasty.

I use one each, green, red, orange and yellow bell pepper. I sautee the green with the onion first in a little olive oil with crushed garlic. The green bell and onion cook slower than the colored peppers. I then do the same with the colored peppers and add some fresh cilantro and a couple tablespoons of packaged "menudo" mix instead of the salad dressing mix.  I also recommend pepper jack cheese and a fresh tomato/onion/cilantro salsa (add minced serrano chiles or jalapenos for an extra kick).

February 20, 2010 - made them again, this time leaving out the green peppers. Still very yummy!

This recipe was fast and simple.  It tasted a little bland at first so I added 1 packet of Sazon (Seasoning made by Goya).  This helped to kick it up a notch.  I love that it has mushrooms in the fajitas which you don't find in many fajita recipes.  All together it was different and had great texture.

I'm giving this a five star rating because my Fiance LOVED these fajitas. I grilled the chicken on my G.Foreman grill and cut the chicken in long pieces fajita style. I also added a jalepeno.

Delish! These were to DIE for!!! My hubs liked these SO much, he asked if we were having fajitas again tonight lol. :) I wasn't expecting these to be as tasty as they were, but was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, the only reason I considered this recipe to begin with was because it called for ingredients I already had available (well, mostly...). Because I had a package of red, yellow & orange bell peppers handy, I used those instead of a red / green one. My hubs and I don't care for mushrooms so I left those out altogether. My final change was to marinate my chicken breasts in zesty Italian dressing FIRST (again, in an attempt to use up some odds and ends), then grill them, slice and add to my bell pepper / onion mixture to heat thru (with the dry Italian dressing mix). Mexican rice, my hubs' AWESOME homemade guacamole and beer margaritas completed our meal. Shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese, salsa and sour cream were perfect fajita toppers. I can't WAIT to try this recipe with other cuts of meat! Thanks SO much for sharing this AWESOME recipe with the AR community, APIED. I will be making this again VERY soon! :-)

Well I revised A LOT. Thanks for the recipe. I never would have used italian seasoning in a Fajitas recipe, because that's not mexican but the flavor was great. However, I would Never, Ever, use cooked meat in ANY recipe no matter how much I was trying to cut back on time. Just can't do it. So I used both chicken and flank steak and tons more seasonings (italian) and sour cream and homeade tortillas and everyone loved it. Good it was, Fajitas, it was not. Oh and used yellow, red and green peppers and chopped seasonal tomatoes along with the shrooms. Oh, and par grilled both the meats before adding them into the mix.

These tasted better than I expected after adding little shredded cheddar. My husband liked them. This is a very easy recipe and much of it can be prepared ahead of time.

it tasted really good, even if not traditional mexican flavor. but, that is obvious with no mexican spices in the recipe. i put it all in a veggie roasting skillet on the grill, and grilled them. that's what made it taste so good. then the usual fajita toppings. it'll make great scrambled egg addition in the morning also.

We loved this recipe!  My children love fajitas and my 13 yr old son said it tasted just like the fajitas we get at a local Mexican resurant that is one of his favorites!  I was surprised by how well the dry mix worked. It needs a squeeze of lime right before serving....Will absoluley make this easy, quick recipe again!

This was the easiest fajita recipe. In twenty minutes I had dinner on the table. I was running low on flour tortillas so I ate mine in a bowl topped with lettuce, tomato and a small sprinkle of low fat cheese. I'll be making this one on a regular basis.

Simple recipe for a quick dinner.  The ranch dressing added a great flavor.  Served with spanish rice.  It was perfect with sour cream, shredded cheese & tomatoes. Next time, we will add some sliced avacado

I was excited to try this after reading some reviews...but was really disappointed. If you're going to go to the trouble of slicing up the onions and peppers and cooking it all up for fajitas and then just add a packet of dry something or other, it is WORTH IT TO ADD THE FAJITA MIX INSTEAD! 

Maybe I'm a fajita-snob but this is pretty boring and certainly no easier than adding a dry packet of fajita mix.

These were great.  I did not have cooked chicken... so, I marinated in Lawrys Baja Chipolte and cooked on a griddle.  I served with gaucamole and salsa.  Would make again - though I want to add pineapple next time.

Yummy!!  This is our new fajita recipe in our household and we have it often!  I was so nervous about the Italian dressing mix, but what an excellent addition!!!  I make this almost as is, except I exclude the mushroom, instead of two green peppers I use one and use either an extra red or a yellow pepper instead, and add a package of fajita seasoning. Mmmmm! Absolutely delicious! One time I didn't have fajita seasoning and prefer to add it, but I did have taco seasoning, so I used that instead. That was just as great!! Overall, definitely worth trying and don't be afraid of the Italian dressing mix, it's a great addition! Serve with the usual toppings and Mexican rice.

These were really great.  I marinated the chicken in the italian seasoning mixed with a little oil and then poured it on the veggies when they were sauteed to finish cooking.  It was very good and a great alternative to going out to eat:)

This has become a regular around our house.  Fantastic and fast!  I do change a few things.  2 green peppers is overkill, so I only use 1.  I also double the mushrooms and add sour cream and baby spinach as toppings.  Yummy stuff!  The italian dressing mix is a great trick!

I used this recipe to make Fajitas that I used the "Spanish Rice I"and the "Easy Guacamole" to make. All recipes superb. I didn't have dry Italian dressing so I marinated steak with Spicy Italian dressing, and then added Spicy Italian to the veggies as well as some rotisserie chicken. I grilled the chicken and the steak. Used Shittake mushrooms also.

Everyone loved this here including my 4 year old. I did make some changes though - no mushrooms & used sliced round steak instead of the chicken. I also added a tiny bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning to spice it up a bit. Quick & easy to make. Highly recommend!

Very tasty - I've made it so often I've fiddled with the recipe to make it to my exact tastes. I like spice, so I tossed in a teaspoon of red chili flakes and some garlic powder and nixed the seasoning mix.  I've also started to grill them - I lay out the taco shell flat, spread a bit of grated low fat cheddar, then the filling, a bit more cheese and another taco chell. I pan fried them or cook them on an electric grill until the shells are crispy on both sides, cut into 6 wedges and serve with salsa and fat free sour cream...an absolute favorite of mine.

These fajitas are to die for. Your mouth will begin to water while cooking them, it was even hard for me to wait. My family and friends loved them. I was a little nervous about the italian seasoning, but stuck to the recipe, and I am very glad I did. If you try to substitute with the "fajita" seasoning it will NOT be the same and do it no justice.

I was a little skeptical about how this would turn out - but it was fantastic!  I only used 1 green pepper since my fiance doesn't really like them.  So delicious - serve with shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream - the works!

These were outstanding. I didn't change a thing except for the fact that I tossed in some olive oil when I added the Italian seasoning. I thought it needed something so it wouldn't be dry. I'll be making these often!

Family loved these.  I did add a fresh jalepeno with the peppers and onions. And I added a dash of Mojito Lime seasoning.  Was surprised at the italian seasoning actually tasting good.

Yum! I am not much of a fajita person but my fiance loves them so I gave them a try and they were far better than expected. He kept mentioning that the veggies were so "savory". I will be making these again!

Diabetic friendly!  My new standing recipe for fajitas, chicken or beef.  There are two pluses in preparing this recipe that make it a breeze for me.  One, even without marinating the meat, it has great flavor.  Two, I keep the dry seasoning mix on hand to make these quickly.  I made my own dry mix using "Italian Dressing Mix" (recipe by Debby), cutting the sugar to 1tsp, and use about 3tsp. of this mix in making the fajitas.  Use lower carb tortillas to keep the carbs down even further.  Add a little sour cream and these are fantastic!!!

I made this for me and my husband tonight. It was the first time I've ever had fajitas, and they were AMAZING! The Italian salad dressing packet made the perfect seasoning! The only change I made was I used strips of frozen grilled chicken breasts instead of the diced chicken. They cooked nicely among the vegetables and gave a wonderful flavor. I will definitely be making this again for years to come!

Excellent!!! I used left over roasted chicken, a homemade dressing mix (cause I live too far to go buy one), and I made my own corn tortillas. But the recipe for the chicken was superb. My picky 5 year old said it was the best dinner ever. No kidding, these are his own words; granted he only ate the meat, tortilla, and cheese, but still excellent. Oh, and I used shitake mushrooms instead of buttons. Thanks for sharing this one.

Great base!  I was worried they wouldn't have enough flavor so i added A LOT of spices.  
With the chicken: a dash of cayenne pepper, Nature's Seasoning, Seasoned Salt, Garlic Powder, and Italian seasoning.  I then pan fried strips of chicken breast in about 2 tablespoons oil.
I HATE green peppers, so I omitted them, In a separate pan, I sauteed red pepper, onion, and the mushrooms (I like my mushrooms COOKED through completely), and added garlic powder, taco seasoning, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. 
After frying both pans, I put them together and then rolled them in whole wheat tortillas. 
Husband said they are in his top 3 of all recipes I've made!!

This is a really good fajita recipe. I don't use mushrooms because my husband is allergic and I don't use as many peppers. I also use a homemade italian seasoning recipe from thise site. They taste great!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I like more veggies, so sometimes I double the veggies and it is always a hit.  My nephew, who is Mexican, had them at my house and declared them the best he has ever had and uses the recipe himself now.  Good Seasonings is the best brand I have tried for the spice. I have tried the cheaper ones, but have not been pleased. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really likes this dish and it is a super easy way to make fajitas.  But I have to agree the Italian seasoning, while tasty, is not very authentic for fajitas!  However, we make it on a regular basis when in a time crunch.

Very bland recipe.  The italian seasoning does nothing for the chicken. I would hardly call these fajitas.  Just because something is wrapped in a tortilla does not mean it qualifies as a fajita.  Even the old El Paso kits you buy at the store makes a better fajita then this recipe.

This is a great recipe for fajitas - very popular in my home. The dry-Italian style dressing really makes this good - so don't substitute.

This was simple and very good.  I used some Garlic Lime chicken breasts that I had leftover from a ;previous meal and it added even more flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be making this often.

Who knew that a packet of italian seasoning makes for great fajitas?  I marinated my sirloin in lime juice, olive oil, fresh minced garlic, and the packet all day.  Seared then cooked on med-low.  Fabulous.

I loved these! Things I did different from the original: 1 lb. chicken breast, shredded, 2 minced cloves of garlic sauteed with onions & peppers and 1 & 1/2 pkg. of salad dressing mix (1 pkg. plus approximately 2 teaspoons). I tasted after using just one pkg. and thought it needed more. I will be using this great recipe for years to come. Thanks, APIED!!

I used 1T of "Italian Dressing Mix" from this site...I  just prefer making my own as to buying a premix. To the veggies, I added Kirkland grilled chicken breast strips and dinner was ready in no time!!

I loved this recipe. It is the first one that I have used in all the years I have browsed this site. I marinated my chicken breast in italian dressing for about 3-4 hrs. and used a premixed onions and pepper package that I purchased from GFS. I was a little skeptical about the dry dressing, thought it may be too overwhelming. I used it anyway and wow! This was an excellent recipe. My family and I loved it. This is definitely a keeper.

Taste great and simple. I seasoned the chicken prior to cooking the peppers and onions. Also, added jar'd hot jalapeno peppers and only 2 tbsp of jar'd mushrooms. My husband & I like our foods hot and spicy!

Wow... these were good!! Everyone (including two kids) really liked. I did use a combination of red/yellow/green peppers and left out the mushrooms only because I didn't have any on hand (will try next time). I also added two cloves of minced garlic when I sauteed the peppers/onions/chicken. We served on non-fat tortillas with shredded cheese, sour cream and salsa with black cuban beans on the side. I made everything in 20 minutes - a good week night meal. Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious! I wasn't so sure about using the Italian dressing as a seasoning but it turned out great and had tons of flavor. I cooked the chicken in a packet of taco seasoning before adding the veggies and then we made ours into quesidillas to make them easier for the kids to eat, we had no leftovers. I will make this all the time now.

This is delicious! I added salt and pepper for taste. Which you may not need. I didn't use the mushrooms since I didn't have any. Goes great with sourcream, guacomole, & Mexican style rice on a flour tortilla!

this was a really great recipe. the only thing i added was a little ground red pepper for some heat. try using different meats like leftover turkey. it works really well. salsa and sour cream are the perfect condiments.

These were a big hit at my house.  The Italian seasoning added that extra something to them.  Instead of using two green peppers, I used one red, one green, and one yellow so not only did it taste great, it looked really pretty too!

I used beef instead of chicken and they were great!  I used a little of the seasoning package to mix in with sour cream and spread it on some warm whole wheat pitas served with the fajita mix, avocado, shredded cheddar and mixed greens and made a fajita pita.  This is definitely something that we will make again!

Great recipe. I found that flavoring the chicken with some salt and pepper before cooking adds a little something. I also like adding green onions for extra flavor and color.

This is a super easy recipe for fajitas and turned out great!  I left out the mushrooms and also squeezed a lime over everything when done.  Yummy!!  This one is definately a keeper.

I didnt care for these fajitas. They were very easy to make but I was definitely disappointed seeing as this is a 5 star recipe. I will not make these again. I served it w/ Spanish Rice Bake.

Not bad at all.  I'd probably give it 4.5 stars but not 5.  Marinated the Chicken in a little Franks Red Hot Sauce First.  Feel that brough out alot of the flavor.  Otherwise I worry that the Italian dressing may have overpowered.  Thanks much.

I love Mexican food, but my hubby doesn't like the traditional Mexican spices.  This recipe was a nice compromise!  (I just topped mine with salsa.)  My peppers took a long time to cook down, but it was worth it!

This was edible, but no tomatoes, no texmex seasoning and really high in salt due to the dressing mix,  and too many peppers.

My husband immediately said "Who the hell puts mushrooms in fajitas?"  Then reluctantly took a bite as we all stared...  What a tasty surprise!! The entire family gobbled them up.  Extremely flavorful, the combination of veggies and Italian dressing is perfect for this dish.  Will be making this again.

I've made this with both chicken and beef and they are both good. I baked the chicken breast. After I put it all together I put it all in the slow cooker to stay warm. I love how easy this is to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a simple and excellent recipe. Done with a quickness!! I always saute the onions and peppers in olive oil and  fresh minced garlic...definitely want to add a big squeeze of lime towards the end. Also, I have poured a bit a beer into the skillet for an extra taste. I usually make these with chicken, shrimp & steak....YUMMY!!

Mmm! This is a combo I would never have thought up. We used chicken, 1 green, 1 red bell pepper and 1/2 an onion and that was the right amount of veggie to meat ratio for us. Topped with sour cream, lettuce and tomato. Delicious!

I cooked the chicken in boullion, then shredded it and added the left over boullion to the mix.  It was fantastic with sour cream.

It tasted a little a little salty, but I think that's because I used marinated left over chicken from last night and only used one cup of chicken and used the whole dressing pack, oops. But, if that wouldn't have happened I could tell it would have been a lot more tastier. I will definitely try it again and keep the recipe!

Not so flavorful...we like strong flavor and the Italian dressing seasoning didn't stand out that much...but it was nice enough for something different

I thought this was a good quick recipe but would almost prefer the regular fajita seasoning that comes in a packet. My husband, however, thought it was a nice change, so I'm sure we'll make it again.

I forgot to buy salad dressing mix, so we settled for eating it without it. It was kinda dry because of the lack of salad, and it would've been better with that as well as sour cream and cheese, but oh well. We made due with what we had- with a bit of hot sauce and worchester sauce with it. I would imagine it would be delicious with cheese and lettuce.

This was GREAT, who would have thought to add italian dressing mix to the vegies in a fajita dish. It was such a good blend of flavor. I added a little taco sauce and sour cream. YUM

These fajitas are awesome! I left out the mushroom and red peppers because my family doesn't like them. My husband was skeptical, and wondered why I didn't use fajita seasoning. But this recipe won him over. There were NO leftovers!

This recipe was fantastic. I tailored it to meet my family's likes - we did without the peppers. I also added pico de gallo (fresh) and black beans. Topped it off with sour cream. Filling and yummy!

Great recipe. I have made it twice and gotten great reviews! The second time I used a yello pepper as well to add a different flavor. I also topped them with sour cream, cheese and salsa. Yum!

I have never made fajitas before, but this recipe made it seem so easy, I couldn't resist. My only change was using 3 different colored peppers, and no mushrooms (my kids don't like mushrooms). My family loved this! My husband even said he was 'impressed.' I don't think he's ever said that about my cooking before! Everyone wants this added to the repertoire, and I'm going to suggest it for our church's Ladies' Retreat in May!

I was a bit skeptical of the Italian seasoning on these fajitas, but they were lovely!  SO easy to make and a nice, healthy alternative to the sloppy (and completely delicious as well) Mexican food I'm used to eating  ;)

This was delicious!  I only used 1 large green pepper and it was plenty.  After I cooked the chicken, I shredded it instead of cubing.  I added the chicken and mushrooms in with peppers and onions and added a little seasoning salt and then added italian dressing.  Used soft taco shells and served with salsa and chedder cheese.  Husband said best he'd ever eaten!!  Will make over and over!!

I tripled this and made enough to feed 18 people.  I used 9 chicken breasts, and that was way too much.  6 would be better - though I must say that the leftovers were eaten up quickly!  This was easy and well liked by everyone.  I also provided guacamole as a topping.

Very easy and delicious. My whole family loved them and I will definitely make again. My only variation was to use raw chicken breast which I had marinated in caesar dressing, and saute it with the onions, peppers and mushrooms. Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good, very easy recipe.  I love it and have made it several times.  I cut out one of the bell peppers and add a few more mushrooms, I also add a little more chicken.  I also searve this with black beans.  My husband loves this recipe.

These fajitas turned out really good tonight. My husband claimed they were some of the best yet. Very easy to make and so good. I did add about a 1/4 cup of water since I wasn't sure how the seasoning would do without it.

This recipie was not the best one that I have ever eaten. The italian dressing made it a little stronger than I usually make. It was a good combination with the mushrooms though.

I have made many fajitas before minus the mushrooms and italian seasoning. I must say, they are a improvement. The chicken tasted better, and I love mushrooms so that just simply made it better. Also, when I'm trying to cut down on calories I use a little bit of water rather than the oil. 
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

These were okay, not too much flavor... kinda bland.

Yum!  I loved these fajitas.  I was looking for a fajita recipe that doesn't use lime juice (don't care for the flavor).  This is a winner.  This recipe is full of flavor and so easy to make.  Using precooked, packaged grilled chicken breast strips such as Tyson's, would make this recipe an even easier, quick to prepare dish.  I made this recipe with chicken breasts that I had pre-cooked...I did not dice the chicken...instead I cut it into strips.  I used about 1 pound of chicken.  I also did not add the mushrooms.  I used the Good Seasons brand dry Italian dressing mix.  Just a comment regarding the serving size...there is no way this recipe would serve 10 in my family.  I would change the serving size to 4 people.  Thanks for the recipe Barbara.

I was looking for something to do with the thawed chicken breasts in my fridge, and came upon this when I searched!  Am I ever glad I did!  The only thing I omitted was the red pepper- my small town grocery store didn't have any.  This was a terrific Friday night dinner- the name of the recipe says it all!  I followed the recipe exactly (other than the red pepper)- the leftovers have been super too!  This will be a regular recipe for me- thanks so much for posting it, Barbara!

This was so good and so easy.  Even my four year old asked to have it again the next night.  The seasonings were just right.  Thanks for a great recipe!
