Excellent dish; this has been passed down for generations in my family.  The secret to this recipe is adding your own personal flavor!  Some of my favorite additions are (not all at once): Red Wine (makes it a bit more moist and adds unbelievable flavor), several small cherry tomatoes, & White Wine.  I also like to saute the sauce as instructed, but then add the noodles to the skillet and toss while still heating.  This seems to infuse the flavor into the noodles well. Mangia!

This was fantastic, but we made it with modifications: added 4 TB butter with the olive oil, increased the garlic to 6 cloves, added 1/2 of white wine, added a dash of italian seasoning and red pepper flakes and used angel hair instead of spaghetti.  It tasted like a restaurant, will make again and again.

I'm giving this 3 stars, because it's pretty basic (but still tasty). I do realize that is the whole point, really.  But, I agree with others, I think it could use a bit more garlic (even though I did add more at the suggestion of others here).  Maybe 3 big cloves?  I also added a splash of white wine.  I also think I might add some cracked pepper next time.  Thanks so much for a great change!!  I would like to add that my 7-year old daughter thought it was a 5-star recipe!

Awesome.  I made the following changes.  Used one TB of olive oil and one TB of unsalted butter.  I dissolved a couple of anchovies in the oil before I added the clams.  I also used a TON of garlic.

This was very easy to make and my husband loved it.  I don't like clams so I have to take his word for it. I did add extra garlic as suggested by others, but I also added some fresh spinach and some steamed asparagus to it as well.  I cooked the spinach and asparagus in with the clam juice so everything had flavor.

Wow, so quick and simple to make!  I added some red pepper flakes for a little extra bite.  Also I added bacon and deglazed it with red wine.   My boyfriend absolutely loved this dish and always asks me to make it.

I had company for supper and everyone liked it.  Only change I'd make is to add more clams and more garlic.

Loved this recipe!  I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 light butter, TONS of garlic, and a splash of white wine.  I tossed in some grape tomatoes and heated until they split.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was delicious!! It did not taste fishy at all (I'm not a fan of seafood). I halved the recipe and made the recipe exactly as written, however, I added 2 tablespoons of white wine with the olive oil. When serving this dish to young children, just don't mention the it has clams in it *wink*. Thank You Kitty >'o'

This is a great start! I added 4 tbl butter with the olive oil and sauted about 4 large garlic cloves (love the garlic). I added about 1/2 cup white wine, and let it reduce. I then substituted crab meat for the clams,since i didn't have any, and doubled the parm. Loved it!

It was quick and easy. My wife thought it was a little dry, but that was probably my fault, not hers. I added chives and cilantro from my garden, and used fettucini noodles. I thought it was great! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is easy and is a good quick meal when in a time crunch. It wasn't full of flavor, maybe adding some white wine to the clams while they're cooking would be good. i wouldn't make it for company.

I do something that I consider just as easy but really snazzes the dish up.  I add fresh chopped thyme, about a Tbl, 2 Tbls of honey and half a stick of butter.

This recipe is simple and great for those rushed meals. If I were to rate it for kids I'd give it 4 stars. But because it isn't outstanding, I've rated it as you see. It needs a litle more garlic, and maybe some crushed red peppers too, especially for adults.

Liked it. But if would change anything, is use 3 (6.5 ounces) cans chopped clams with juice. Drain the third can of its juice and discard.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  We too did a few "tweaks".  We used angel hair, doubled the clams, tripled the garlic (we LOVE garlic) added white wine, and small cherry tomatoes.  I would make it again for a second night in a row...but we already has dinner plans.  Delicious. :)

This was a lot better than I thought it would be. My 5 year old and 3 year old both loved it. My husband said it was okay. The big plus was how quick it was. It would be worth having several cans of clams and packages of spaghetti around for emergency dinners, or a quick lunch. It took less than 10 minutes from start to finish.

It was okay & we ate it with added garlic.  I felt it was sorta bland and could have really used something to give it creamy texture.  I'm sure that is such my preference and would encourage anyone who likes clams to give it a shot!

Great easy recipe.  I never would have tried it if I didn't have some canned clams given to us.  My 5 yo daughter absolutely loved it.  She said I was the best cook in the whole wide world!

I'd never cooked with clams before, but this turned out to be a good tasty dish that lasted me for 3 meals. Because it was so simple and not absolutely fantastic, I didn't give it five stars, but it was very good, and I'll make it again sometime.
