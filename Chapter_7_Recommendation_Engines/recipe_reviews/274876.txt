I was not impressed. I found the chicken to be flavorless. The potato/ onion mixture was okay, but I found it was a little too oily.  Initially i thought  i would make it again but tweak the seasoning. After finishing dinner, I don't know that I would put in the effort.  
Not for me.....

This chicken is phenomenal, ive just started cooking myself 3 weeks ago, and have stuck with a lot of chicken recipes. By FAR this is the tasiest chicken ive made personally. The longest but my Wife and Daughter agree, chicken was tender and juicy, and although the potatoes wedges weren't crispy, they were very tasty. 

NOTE* I went heavy on fresh pepper, salt and my fresh parsley. Also might of added a touch to much wine.

By cooking it covered in the oven, the chicken and potatoes lost their crisp. Didn’t take near 45 minutes to cook. Flavor just okay. Probably won’t make again

Definitely a chi-town dish.  Had over the summer and glad to find a recipe that uses the true Italian-American Chicago method—on the stove top and then into the oven. This recipe was a tad light on the olive oil, but it works. Loved it and so did the fam.

I wanted to keep the chicken crispy, so I upped the sauce amount by about a 3rd, and baked uncovered.  Perfect!  I also used more seasoning than called for and I'm happy I did.

Amazing. My Grandmother use to make it, a little differently but it brought me right back. Chicken had a flavor all the way through, fall off the bone. Now i want another meal of bread and butter and the sauce!

I made this recipe "as is". Taste was OK but needs a bit more herbs. I'm not sure how heart healthy it is with the skin left on the chicken. Will try with skinless chicken next time, add more herbs, and switch yellow potatoes for sweet potatoes.

This was delicious but could use a few small improvements.  Next time I make it, I'll increase the wine and stock to 1 cup each so there's more sauce. I also added a few teaspoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of chopped rosemary. Otherwise, a great dish!

I love most of the recipes on this site.  But, this one was a bit boring. I followed everything to a T except added 50% more of the ingredients needed to make more of the sauce (as we love sauces...... sauce was tasty).   The skin on the chicken ends up soggy & unless you increase the garlic amount, it’s “flat”.   We did not dislike this meal, but it was rather “ho-hum”.

I read about this recipe in a Cooks Illustrated magazine and I loved it. I added a diced onion and a few drops of vanilla extract to bake with the potatos and chicken in white wine, after browning the potatos and chicken. I think peas and butter would be cool to try next time, I want to use the leftovers for an alfredo pasta. I also want to try it with bell peppers and serrano peppers, maybe mushrooms

Imade this dish and thought it was an excellent entree for the meal. Next time I may try tweaking it a bit for just a little bit of zing.

Love this recipe!  I added some Arrowroot to the sauce at the end to thicken it.  I passed the recipe onto friends and family.
