Hi Ya, and thanks for a new recipe for an old fave!  There is, however, one teeny weeny change I'd suggest may be worth your consideration.  (Did this bloke eat a dictionary?).  Once you have your chops and marinade in the bag, so to speak, take a leaf out of the Japanese itame's cookbook.  Massage it!  Honest, every half hour, give it a gentle rub on both sides, turn it and put it back in the 'fridge.  Should cut your marinating time by four fifths, or give you tons more flavour (sorry) for your bucks.  Always good.  Try it, it really works!  Itame? oh yes, that's a Japanese chef.

This is an awesome recipe. Followed it to a "t" except it ended up marinating for close to 48 hours. The key to making killer pork chops on the grill is not to over cook them. One inch thick chops over medium heat = 7 minutes first side then 5 minutes second. After you've given them a few minutes to rest (7-10 min.) cut the thickest part of one chop and ensure the jucies are clear.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend last night and at his first bite his eyes got soooo big and he couldn't extole the virtues of my cooking more if he tried.  I did the recipe as it was written with a bit of extra garlic cloves and bone-in pork loin chops. I marinated this overnight and the consistency and flavor were perfect. Since I do not have a grill, I cooked it in a covered frying pan on top of the stove on medium (about 7-8 minutes on each side, uncovered for a minute or so for browning). This recipe will definately be in permanent rotation!

Extremely tasty! I marinated these overnight and broiled/baked them.  I used center cut pork chops-- about 3/4 inch thick.  They took almost twice as long in the oven as what the recipe called for grilling.  I broiled each side for 5 minutes, then covered them with foil and baked them for 10 min more on a lower temperature.  The broiling gave the illusion of having grilled them. I can't wait for summer so I can make them on the grill for real!

Needed a quick fix for three pork chops, so I used this marinade for only an hour.  I planned to grill the chops, but ran out of propane before the grill was even warm.  Came back inside and cooked them on medium heat in a  LeCreuset cast iron grill pan, coated with a bit of vegetable oil.   Even with only an hour in the marinade, they were GREAT!  A definite keeper!

These were SO good!  I was always afraid to make pork chops because I've only had chewy, flavorless ones.  But this is going to be one of my favorite grilling recipes to make again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly using bottled lemon juice and it turned out great.  Very flavorful, and deliciously moist.  I served it with grilled veggies and did a grilled sweet potato with butter, brown sugar and pecans for dessert.

Very good.  Needed something to do with pork chops and didn't want to go to the store.  Had everything on hand already.  Pork had a nice slightly sweet flavor.  I used italian seasoning rather than just oregano and let marinade about three hours.  Grilled and they came out perfect.  I will make again for sure.  Had friend over for dinner and she was surprised how easy it was.  States she will try too.

This marinade has a great flavor. Like others, I too will definitely try it on fish and chicken. I only marinated my pork chops for 1 hour, and they were a tad dry - I'll definitely do at least 2 hours next time.

I have been using something similar to this for years. This is what I do.  For even more flavor, add about 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce & 1/4 cup of E.V.O.O. to the above recipe.  If you are not able to grille chops and must cook on stove, start with a COLD griddle or skillet, place the chops on griddle, then turn on heat and cook as long as needed.  This way of cooking will ensure tender chops.

If there were 10 stars available, that's what I would give this recipe!  For such a simple marinade this was so fantastic and the hit of my cookout!  I marinated pieces of pork in this over-night and then skewered them and cooked them on the grill.  The meat stayed tender and juicy and was so tasty!  Everyone at the bbq wanted the recipe.  I made this exactly as stated and didn't sub. anything, no subs were needed!  Yum!!

These pork chops are so tender and tasty. I like to use bone-in pork chops and broil them, since I don't have a grill. My bf always asks for seconds!

Added more garlic, & cut back on the salt. It took much longer on my grill, maybe the chops were thicker. As much as they were tasty, I can't say I thought they tasted like steak. A keeper, will try it on chicken next.

This was very good.  We baked in the oven just because weather wasn't great for outdoor grilling.  Baked @ 350 for about 40 mins.

Tastes like steak? Let's not go into La La land! However, this recipe surpasses the sum of its parts. Juicy, delicious and no one flavor overpowers the others. I don't taste the lemon, per se, but rather a citrus back note that perfectly compliments the meat. I get happy when I find a tasty, easy recipe and this one fits the bill. :o)

Really enjoyed this pork chop version. It was a little garlic heavy for my taste, but I still really enjoyed it. I made it with some rice, definitely made it very flavourful!

I read this recipe 5 minutes before I wanted to start making it, so obviously I didn't marinade the chops.  They still came out pretty good though.  I placed the chops in a baking bag, added the marinade, shook it up and placed it in the oven for 40 min on 400 degrees.  They were very tender, but could've been more flavorful (probably because I didn't marinade beforehand).  Next time I will marinade and grill.

Neither I nor Mrs. Spunky cared for this much. She said the lemon contributed a tang she didn't like and thinks these would have been better without.  As for me, I guess I just think there are precious few marinades that improve the flavor of meat and this wasn't one of them.

This was very good - we ended up making it with a pork loin instead of pork chops, and yum!  Doubled the marinade, bagged it up and let the pork loin soak overnight.  Put it in the crockpot around 11 and cooked it on high for 5 hours.  I strained the marinade after it was done and put it in a saucepan with 1 TBSP of cornstarch mixed with a bit of the lukewarm marinade to mix into the pot, then 1 TBSP of flour with a splash of cold milk mixed and poured into the pot.  It made the perfect gravy/sauce to pour over the pork and mashed potatoes.  Pork to me is always a bit dry so we rarely serve it, but this was very good and we will definitely make it again.

I tried this marinade on grilled chicken breasts and it turned out very well! The chicken was incredibly moist after only 4 hours of marinating. I substituted extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil for more flavor, cut the salt in half (1 tsp. looked like too much), and used Italian seasoning since I didn't have oregano individually. Thank you, Doreen!

Flavorful and easy.  It didn't knock my socks off but the chops tasted great and were tender.  Overall a solid recipe that I will make again.  Marinaded for 8 hours.

These are the BEST pork chops I have ever had. They do taste like steak.  My husband hates pork chops on the grill because they get too dry, but these were so moist.  He even said they were "delicious".  I only marinated them for 3 hours but the flavor still came through.  I also basted them while they were on the grill.  DELICIOUS!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

This was a great recipe.  Quick and easy.  Bet this marinade would be good on boneless, skinless chicken breasts as well.

We followed the recipe to a "T" but the chops came out dry dry dry. We marinated them overnight too. Not sure what went wrong. We did not overcook or substitute a thing. I think this type of chop should be pan seared before cooking, it can dry easily.  The sauce gave little flavor to the chops too.

I wasn't expecting much because I only had time to marinate for three hours, but WOW they were flavorful!! So good! I massaged the meat while it marinated as suggested by a reviewer and made two sets of marinade so I could have a separate one for basting so I wouldn't have to boil the other...

These were good but I think the marination actually works best on fish.Instead of grilling,I just baked them at 350 for about 40-45 minutes,covered.I layed  them on top of a bed of onions.

Made this as written, marinated for 24 hours, and it resulted in such flavorful and succulent chops. So simple, yet elegant! Served with asparagus-feta couscous also from this site. Thanks for sharing!

I would give more stars if I could.  I have NEVER found a recipe that was worthy for having company over, til this one.  Wow.  And I only marinated for 2 hours.  I couldn't imagine how yummy it would be overnight.  It tasted like we bought pre-marinated chops from the butcher shop.  So good, flavorful, tender, YUM!  And we didn't baste them in sauce at all, just grilled.

These are hands down the best pork chops I have ever had!  I'm not usually a pork chop fan, but these were delicious.  My kids loved them and my husband would probably rate them a four, but that's more because he prefers traditional breaded pork chops.  I cooked them exactly as the recipe is written.  I marinated them for about six hours and the intensity of the marinade was perfect.  They paired well with Greek style potatoes and Greek style green beans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe full of kitchen staples!  I only marinated for about an hour and a half so it was not as flavorful as I would've liked.  It only took 12 minutes once the grill was heated.  So quick!  It was tasty and I will be sure to repeat, just allowing for extra marinating time.

I'd give this recipe 6 stars if I could! I think this is my new favorite go to recipe for pork chops. They were SO delicious and moist! My pork chops were a little larger, so I made 1 1/2 times the marinade. However, there was such a small amount of liquid left after marinating, it wasn't enough to boil so we skipped the basting step. We made these for dinner with friends who were on the South Beach diet and they raved about them too!

These were a great change from the regular grilled chops with BBQ sauce. I think that next time instead of oregano, I might try basil. But don't get me wrong, these are real good. I got this recipe recommendation from the recipe exchange message board. If you are in a rut or need help go there. They have ALWAYS helped me out and set me straight.

The only downside is the fact that I chose this recipe for a weeknight rush supper. Didn't marinate it much past 1/2 hr. Did it under the broiler. Nevertheless, the 3 of us (including a 15 yr old) loved it! Even with the minimal marinade time, it had a great flavor.
I can only assume that marinated overnight and done on the BARBEE, it would be a 5+. Will do it again soooon!

Awesome!
I cooked the chops on an indoor stovetop grill and they were so good. I marinated for about 5 hours or so. By that point, the lemon juice was already cooking the pork chops. Thanks for the great recipe!

A very light and refreshing way to cook pork chops.  Mine were a little on the thin side so I shortened cooking time.  I think the same marinade will work wonderfully on chicken too.

Outstanding!!!!!! Used fresh rosemary instead of oregano & no salt. Marinated for 24 hrs and cook on the grill. I'm going to try the marinate with boneless chicken breasts also.

Quick and easy recipe. I let the pork chops marinated for 7 hours. Next time I'll probably do it over night.  I would also double the marinade.

I used one pork tenderloin (one, not a package of two) and kept it whole.  It marinated for 1.5 days and was fantastic.  It was such a wonderful change from typical pork tenderloin recipes.  I served it with roasted quartered, baby red potatoes that I roasted along with the pork.  Truly delicious.

I have made these numerous times...we all LOVE them...especially my picky 7 year old!  I only marinate them for 30-60 mins.  Oh and the cooking time is so critical.  If you have thinner chops cook them about 4 mins per side and thicker chops about 6 mins per side.  SOO YUMMY! :)

Excellent recipe and well worth giving it a try.  Very tender and juicy and VERY flavorful.  I marinated 24 hours and grilled them.   Will definately make again.

Delicious!  Thought the lemon juice would give a sour taste to the pork, but it only imparted a nice lemony flavour.  Definitely marinade the meat for 24 hours.  Will try this recipe next on cubed chicken breast.

DELICIOUS! Made them just as the recipe says to and they were some of the best pork chops I have ever had! So much flavor and really no added calories to the meat! I'll be making them regularly!

I've made this several times, using fresh oregano from my garden, and marinating for 2 days (purely by accident).  The longer you marinate, the better.  Best pork chops EVER!

I've made this several times now, because it's so good.  So simple, and it goes great on Pork Loin and I have a friend who put the marinade on fresh tuna and grilled, very good!  I think fresh lemon juice and grilling are key!

I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested. Also used Italian seasoning in place of just oregano, added 1/4 cup soy sauce and used garlic pepper instead of just pepper. Hubby didn't like it so lemony so I will reduce the lemon juice next time. Marinated it overnight turned our very flavorful!

This is the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried.  I have made it for many guests - and all have raved about how good these chops are!  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

These were quite delicious.  We ended up marinating for a day and a half as we were too busy to make for dinner the first night.  Next time I will double the marinade.

I have made this for a long time, always a huge hit.  Although, I make double the marinade and use a pork loin roast ( @ 4lbs.) and marinate for at least 24 hours ( 48 is better) and cook it over medium flame on the grill, fat side up, grill closed with a meat thermometer inserted in the center.  HEAVEN!

We really enjoyed these... they were quick and easy and had a lot of flavor, even after only marinating for 4 hours.  The only change I made was using olive oil in place of the veg. oil.  Thanks, Doreen... I'll be making these again.

Loved this recipe. Simple and delicious. I used bone in pork chops (about 1 inch thick). Grilled for 7 min. on first side and 5-7 on other side, then let rest for 7 min. Served with a baked potato and veggie. Perfect!

Delicious.  Ended up marinating for around 36 hours due to botched dinner plans.  It does taste like steak!  Really good and very healthy.  I made it exactly as written except I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  The pork chops were juicy and tender.  A keeper!!

I liked this recipe. Marinated it about 5 hrs. Did do the "massaging" like suggested, waste of time. Didn't find that it made enough difference for the time it took. Enjoyed the recipe!

My parents love these pork chops and I even served them, at there home, to a local TV personality/chef who also raved about them.  I find that by adding a little honey to the mix cuts down on the sourness of the lemon.  Other than increasing the amount of marinade for basting while grilling and adding the honey I follow the recipe exactly.  Thank you from a person just learning to cook for making my dinner an outstanding hit.

Very good!  I marinated them for about 4 hours, the meat was very tender and juicy.  Made it exactly as the recipe says to, wouldn't change a thing!  Will be making this again!

These were awesome.  I used my inside grill and it was so quick and simple.  I let them marinade for about 4 hours but I could imagine that if you let them marinate overnight they would be even better.  Very healthy and new way to serve chops.  I will def put these in rotation.

This is an awesome alternative to the "throw it on the grill" pork chops.  I only had about 6 hours to let them marinate.  Next time I'll try to plan ahead a little better and do them overnight.  My 8 year old daughter (the bean pole) asked for another one.  WOW!  Thanks for sharing!

I have made these pork chops several times now and they are delicious.  I follow the recipe as stated and they turn out wonderful.  For the best results, marinade the chops overnight.  It takes no effort to make these and the recipe can easily be scaled down for 2 people without wasting anything.

This is one of the best and simplest marinades for pork (or chicken) I can think of.   Always light and tasty and make with ingredients we usually have on hand.   Thanks for submitting because it is one that should be in everyone's file.

This was a really nice and light marinade.  I added some fresh chopped rosemary which I thought really brought out the flavor of the lemon.  I will definitely use this one again.

I followed this recipe with two minor changes - I ran out of lemon juice, so the marinade was short (probably 2 or 3 tablespoons), and we have our hands full, so we skipped using the extra marinade to baste the chops.
Despite the changes, my entire family LOVED these - even my meat-hating 1 year old!  Quick, easy, and everyone loved them?  We will be making these regularly!

Maybew I overdid the lemon, but it was way to lemony for my taste.  My wife did not like the oregeno.  It's not not totally horrible, but there are better marinades.  Doreen has one with wine and soy sauce that is much better.  Thanks for putting it up doreen.

This is the second time I've made these chops. I decided to make them the second time because they were so good the first time!  I did make a small addition which was to add 1/4 cup of lime juice as well as the lemon juice that is called for in the recipe.  Yum!

I have fixed this recipe both in the oven and on the grill, and they were EXCELLENT both times!  My family flipped over them!  Just be sure to let the pork marinate for several hours to give it time to soak in the flavors.  While you CAN fry them, too much juice tends to run out making them taste boiled.  I prefer them with a crispy exterior.

My mom isn't fond of oregano so I used fresh thyme instead. I just put a few whole sprigs of it in the bag with the marinade, and added more when I boiled the mixture on the stove. It turned out DELICIOUS! Wonderful recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe and adjusted it to the amount of pork to be prepared.  I was using some 3/4" thick boneless pork chops so I cut them into roughly 4oz pieces before I began. The only substitutions I made were olive oil for the vegetable oil and bottled lemon juice for fresh squeezed. I always use a zip lock bag for marinating and it works best to remove all the excess air from the bag before you close it. If you can do that then the marinate will stay in contact with all sides of the meat and you don't have to touch it again until you start cooking. I cooked these pork chops on a gas grill at low heat (300-325) until they reached 160°F internally. The flavor of the marinade was not "lemony" like some complained or non-existent as others claimed. The mixture of the garlic,lemon and additional herbs were fine and of course the olive oil added a little to the final taste also.

Perfect! Marinated for 24 hours and cooked loin chops to 145 degrees. The marinade paired well with the pork without over powering the juicy chops. Will definitely make these again.

Delicious, juicy--husband, 5 year old and 7 year old (and me) gobbled up.  Wish I made more than 3.   Was running behind and only marinated 1 hour, but poked holes in them with tenderizer first.  Can't wait to try after longer marinade.   Cooked to internal temp of 160.  Grill still covered in snow so used cast iron grill pan on stove. YUM!

I was looking for seomthing to do with my chops, had all the ingredients, and decided to give this a try.  I did sub garlic powder for the minced - it's what I had.  The chops were moist, tender, and whole family liked them.

Very simple and good. I only marinated for about 45 minutes and I did not use the sauce to baste and they still turned out good. Only thing I did differently was rub the chops with the salt, pepper, and oregano instead of adding it to the marinade.

This turned out really good. I let the pork marinade for 3hrs. The Pork medallions I had were pretty thick so unfortunately I over cooked them a bit. I will use this recipe again but next time watch the grill a little closer.

This is AMAZING! Few ingredients but really tasty. Will make over and over again. 2 alterations: I used meat tenderizer rather than salt and used 1 tsp fresh oregano rather than dried.

Packed with flavor and so so easy!  My husband asked me to, "keep this recipe". The basting during grilling really made it juicy!

I don't understand the reviewers who said that they let the pork sit in the marinade overnight - I would expect that the meat got mushy and partly cooked from sitting so long in the citrus juice. Anyhow, I only let my chops sit for a couple of hours and they were good. I found the recipe a bit heavy on the lemon juice so I just added more oil to compensate. The flavors were good.

These turned out really well!  They were juicy and I loved the lemon juice!  Who would have thought?!  But next time, I'll marinate them overnight so more of the flavor soaks through.

My family didn't find this recipe favorful enough.  I marinated them for two hours and cooked in the Forman.  I would recommend adding additional spices if you want a kicked-up taste.

Very good recipe!  Some of the best pork chops I have ever had!  I would suggest marinating the chops overnight if you have chops over 3/4 inch thick so you can the the flavor all the way through the chops.

We enjoyed these...good flavor but not over powering. Very simple, easy marinade. Put it together in the morning and let them marinade all day. I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and bone in pork chops because thats what I had on hand. Dont really think it made a difference. I will definitely make these again.

Superb! My 6yr old wanted "lemon" pork chops so I made this. She ate 2 whole chops. I marinated for 2hrs and used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil since I didnt have any. I will be making these again since she had 2nds and usually doesnt finish her dinner. Thanks!

Love, love, love this recipe. The longer you marinate, the better it is. I think I did mine nearly two days and they were fabulous! Serve w/lemon orzo and brocolli. Delicious!

Moist, flavorful chops. We marinated these for about 6 hours and I think next time I will try to remember to start marinating the night before. We really liked the flavor and believe that marinating longer will bring it out even more. The grilling time was spot on. Thanks for sharing!

Without a doubt, the best thing to come along for pork chops. Juicy, flavorful without masking the taste of the meat, easy. My dad, who is a finicky eater, loved it.

These turned out okay. I used too much lemon juice, so they tasted a little funny. I will try these again and not go overboard on the lemon juice.

This was really good. I used lime juice instead of lemon because that's that I had. The pork chops had so much flavor and were super tender. I'm keeping this recipe to make again.

Made this last night and only had an hour or so for marinating, so I poked a bunch of holes in my chops with a fork. Also,  I took another reviewer's suggestion and "massaged" the chops every 15 minutes or so. Sounds absurd, but it worked. Chops were tender and you could taste the marinade. My fiance even asked what the marinade consisted of. Will keep this recipe on hand---thanks!

Tasty marinade recipe! It smelled so delicious in my fridge all day, I was a teeny bit disappointed when it didn't taste very lemony (or very strongly at all) after cooking, but I suspect that's because I didn't baste (I baked the chops in the oven, wrapped individually in foil to keep moist, so basting would have been too much trouble). Still, wonderful recipe, and I look forward to trying it on the grill in the spring!

This is one of my and my boyfriend's favorite dinners! It really is very simple and even if I don't have enough time to marinate them for hours, they still taste great! The only thing I change is that I use olive oil because I don't keep vegetable oil in the house, and I think it makes them even better! I highly recommend this recipe!

I love this recipe!  I don't have a grill or grill pan, so I just pan fry them in extra marinade.  I like to serve them with rice, steamed asparagus, extra lemon wedges and a beet salad with onions and feta.  Delicious!  It's become one of our regular dinner favorites.

I was very happy with the way these turned out.  My husband is always worried pork will be dry and these were moist and flavorful.  I had thick pork chops so I butterflied them prior to marinating (for about 3 hours) and grilled for a total of 15 minutes.  I used about a teaspoon of fresh oregano instead of dried.

First time I made this exactly as directed.  It was very good with a distinct lemon flavor.  I made it again today.  I doubled the marinade recipe and added a TBS. of soy sauce and about 5 or 6 dashes of liquid smoke.  This turned out phenomenal.  It tasted exactly like steak.  Weird.  Also, I did marinade for almost 24 hours.

The whole family loved this from the 2 year old on up. My 4 year old daughter even asked for an extra chop! We are grilling novices, but I'd label this recipe as fool proof and fantastic!

The flavor of this dish was amazing. Even my hard to please husband loved it. I reduced the oil by a tablespoon to save on fat. The marinade would be great with chicken and fish as well as pork. I will use it often.

Simple, Quick, and deeeeelicious.  My chops came out perfectly juicy on the grill w direct medium heat about 5 minutes per side.  I thought this might be a bland recipe but was pleasantly suprised at how tasty it was. I have been doing th south beach diet for a few weeks now and this recipe actually fits the bill- although I substituted canola oil for the vegetable oil.  yum yum and so easy.

Delicious!  These are some of the best pork chops I have had.  They were so juicy!  Normally my husband prefers it when I wait several weeks before repeating a meal, but he asked me for this one again, even though I made them last week.

I was having company over and wanted to do something a little different for the pork chops.  This was perfect, the lemon and seasonings were subtle and the pork chops were so tender & moist. I was worried it wasn't enough marinade because it was such a small amount, but it turned out just fine. Everyone loved them and insisted on getting the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now exactly as described, and it's turned out delicious both times. We've been eating pork chops pan-broiled for awhile now, but my husband couldn't stop raving about the taste of this with the marinade and the grilling. Definitely try it!

This recipe surprized me!  I didn't have any confidence after I looked at the ingredients, but tried it anyway.  I'm glad I did.  I only let the chops marinate for 2 hours, and they are very flavorful.  I would never change a thing!!  This is going to be in the meal rotation from now on!  Thanks for the recipe.

Just made this recipe tonight, because I have 3 daughters who all dislike pork chops, but I'm determined to add them to our dinner rotation!  2 out of 3 loved them, including myself.  Those same two even commented (without any knowledge of what this recipe claimed to be like, beforehand)that it tasted "just like steak".  I would not totally agree, although I can see where that review comes from, as my 3rd daughter said they were "alright, but tasted like everything else we marinate" (ie: steak).  I thought the lemon juice added real zing, and admittedly I bumped up the quantity to about 1/3 cup, as 1/4 cup, once poured in the bag, did not seem like enough for 4 very thick, bone-in chops...I'm very happy I made that adjustment, and I have succeeded in adding pork chops, once again, to my list of routine dinners at home!  Thank you for sharing, it's wonderful.

If it were possible to give this recipe 6 stars out of 5 my husband and I would do it!  What an easy recipe to prepare, and the chops required NO additional seasoning after coming off the grill, and he usually salts & peppers just about everything!

Pork chops were very tender and juicy, and I only marinated for 1.5 hours!  Next time will marinate overnight.  My husband thought the lemon was slightly overpowering (I loved it), so next time will probably use less.

These are awesome.  Made the marinade as described.  Used only 2 chops.  Marinated in frig for about 4 hours.  Didn't even boil/baste the remaining marinade.   They really did taste almost like steak, and they were tender and delicious.  Also SO easy.  Will make again for sure!!

Came out quite tender and the lemon flavor was very strong, which I like. I broiled mine in the oven and they came out perfectly--even though I was using a larger, bone-in chop and not what is suggested here. Served with a lemon zest rice pilaf. Yum.

This really is a great recipe. I only have one minor complaint, and that is the marinade time. The problem lies that after about 2 hours the acid in the marinade begins to cook the meat. The process is called denaturing. Marinades that contain citrus juices, especially lemon or lime juice, should be used for only 2 hours or less. Foods left too long in these blends can change color and texture.

I tried this tonight, and it was pretty good. For my family it was slightly bland and tough. Next time I will tenderize the pork chops and add more spices to it. All in all it was pretty good.

Fabulous!  The flavor was excellent, but not overpowering. Even our 5 year old cleaned her plate!  My pork chops were very thick, so I used a thermometer instead of the suggested time for cooking. I took them off the grill at 145 degrees and let them sit for abut 5 minutes to redistribute juices. They were moist and flavorful.  I love a recipe that has so much punch of flavor, yet uses ingredients that I always have on hand. i could serve this to company too. Definitely going on the rotation list.

YUM.  Super easy too.  I marinaded overnight and massaged the marinade into the meat a couple of times as other reviews suggested.  Otherwise didn't change a thing.  Super easy and delicious.

These pork chops were wonderful!  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there was marinade left (it makes little liquid) so I ended up making another batch, boiling it down a bit and then basting on the BBQ.  Will be making this again, just increasing the amount of marinade!

I made these once in the oven and once in a pan - both times they were just ok. Tonight I made them on the grill and they were excellent! I wouldn't make these any other way but on the grill.

Very good!  Next time I will marinate longer.  I marinated it for about 6 hours, but didn't turn all that frequently.  I will change to 5 stars if it turns out even more flavorful after marinating longer next time.  Still a very good recipe

Great flavour on these chops! Couldn't get enough of them! I had a small change of substituting dried Italian seasoning for the oregano seasoning.

Tender, juicy, flavorful. My boneless chops were about 3/4", and were done perfectly at the 7 minute/side mark. This recipe will definitely be used over and over.

This was really, really delicious! I added a bit more lemon juice (closer to half a cup), because I really like strong lemon flavours, and a bit of garlic salt with the other spices. They turned out fantastic! We cooked them on a George Foreman grill + didn't baste them while grilling, and they still had a very strong lemon/garlic taste. Marinated for about 16-18 hours. Will definitely makes this again!

Awesome chops! I broiled them and followed everything else exact. Juicy, flavorful, can't get enough! I Suggest anyone who makes this make extra as I did and there still wasn't any leftovers.

Also used italian seasoning rather than just oregano.  Marinated overnight and rubbed / turned a few times.  Most tender pork chops I have had in some time.

Excellent!!!  Tasted like something you would have in a restarant.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half the salt since I try to limit my salt intake.  I marinated it for about 5 hours and the wonderful flavor permeated throughout the meat.  Definately making again!

This is an awesome dish. The marinade was absolutely perfect and marinated the pork chops perfectly. I marinated the pork chops marinate for at least 5 1/2 hours then I grilled it. The aroma was wonderful. The meat was moist and tender and very flavorful. I served this with just rice. The juices from the marinade was awesome and I look forward to making this again soon!! Yummo

Made this last night at the last minute since my father-in-law decided to stay for dinner.  The marinade is awesome even for just a 1/2 hour soak in it.  Make sure your chops are thick enough for the 5-7 minutes per side on the grill since I think ours were a little thinner than the recipe used and a couple turned out a little dry.  Otherwise we LOVED this recipe.. going to try it out on chicken too!

I thought this dish was tasty and easy to make. I little bit too much salt and lemon for my taste buds so I think the next time I will do half lemon and quarter of salt and maybe add chicken broth to make up the shortage of lemon. Who knows may ruine it all together. So for you I recommend stick with the original recipe first before altering.

These were delicious and SO easy!  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil to have a stronger flavor and then added about a tablespoon or two of honey to the marinade.  I only had about 3 hours to let the pork marinate, so I made extra marinade and poured it over the pork just as I pulled them off the grill.  They were full of zingy flavor.

Nice flavor and very easy.  I only used 3 pork chops.  I think if I used 6 I'd double the marinade.  Also, I only let it sit 2 1/2 hours and I think the flavors do need longer to blend.  Overnight is probably best.

This was really quite easy and great. I used a lot of black pepper to make it a little spicy. I dont have a grill so I put boneless chops into a saute pan with all of the marinade. At the same time I was boiling egg noodles to go with the pork chops. Kept the chops moist using some leftover water from the noodles. Took out the chops and a nice sauce was left to finish cooking then noodles in. Very good.

bravo and a standing ovation.  I don't know ya, but I love ya.  These were so easy to make and so enjoyable to eat.  I used bone in chops and man oh man were they to die for.  Hubby says they were the best pork chops he has ever eaten...and believe you me, he has eaten ALOT of pork chops in his days.  Thankyou so much for the recipe.

This was easy and had a nice refreshing flavor. Everyone enjoyed it. I did massage the meat every 20-30 min and flip it in the bag, but I only had 3 hours to marinade it. I used jarred minced garlic (about 2 tbsp) added some garlic powder, mrs dash and italian seasoning. Served with a cold cucumber dill salad and Italian spaghetti squash. Very tastey, will make again.

followed the recipe exactly but doubled the marinade.  Wouldn't change a thing!  These were possibly the best pork chops I've ever had and a hit with the whole family.  Will be making them often.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was pretty good. I cut back on the lemon juice because I did not have enough, but glad I did because it was still very lemony! I think this would be a good marinade for chicken and even fish!

Fabulous!  I left these to marinade overnight and the lemon/garlic flavors really popped.  I broiled these on high for about 8 minutes on each side and they were perfect.  Clean up was a snap since I used the same dish for marinading and baking (and storing the leftovers).

This recipe is AMAZING. The only thing that I did different was double the marinade. My husband, who is a very picky eater, said that these were the BEST pork chops he has ever had. They do taste just like steak which made them even more fantastic. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I liked this alot, I don't care too much for pork chops so it was a great taste for me. My husband would have given it a 3. He thought it was good but not memorable. I will do it again,it was tasty and simple. I did "massage" the meat as one reviewer suggested. I don't think it made any difference. But then I hadn't done it without so I don't have anything to compare it with.

I am a very beginner cook and this was easy and very tasty. I was not expecting much out of this recipe because I am not a fan of pork chops but my husband asked if I could make some. I didn't have lemon so I used lime instead and then before grilling i sprinkled on a little lemon pepper. LOVED IT! I will definitely be making this again and again

Followed the recipe exactly as written and allowed 7 hours for pork chops to marinade.  The pork chops were very tender but the flavor was unimpressive.

This was really good and so easy!  I didn't even marinade the chops for very long and they still turned out flavorful and delicious.  My kids loved it.  I substituted Italian seasoning for oregano (since I didn't have any) and used olive oil for the vegetable oil.  I am going to try this marinade on chicken, too.

YUM! made as recipe stated (although didn't have enough marinade left to boil it and add more)  good flavor for an easy, healthy marinade. next time will spice up a little more - more oregano, add some basil, maybe seasoned salt instead of regular.

When I made these for the third time, the chops were tender and moist but not quite as delicious as the other times. I realized the first two times I had used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will only use olive oil from now on as it makes the marinade outstanding. It is equally delicious on chicken and tastes great with lime instead of lemon, too.

I used boneless centercuts, marinaded them overnight and used an indoor grill pan, (if you dont have one, you're missing out!) The only suggestion i would make is to not baste with too much of the marinade towards the end of cooking, it almost crossed the line of TOO lemony. Served with leftover risotto from the night before.  Will definitely make again! Thanks!

I made this tonight.  I let the pork chops marinade almost 24 hours.  It was delicious! I was worried my husband would not like the lemony flavor, but it was not overwhelming at all and he loved them.  Definitely a keeper.

I made these last evening for dinner. I was concerned about the amount of lemon juice thinking it may be too much. The only change I made was to use 1-2 tbsp. FRESH herbs (added rosemary and thyme to the mix)to the marinade. These were very good! I served with broccoli and acorn squash for a wonderful autumn meal.

These were delicious. I ended up marinating for closer to 48 hours and they came out so tender and juicy. My boyfriend raved over them.

I read the recipe and knew right away that it was going to be a good marinade if you use equal amounts lemon juice and veg oil. So that is what I did. Lemon juice has a tendency to "cook" so you dont want to use too much. I marinated this for about 6 hours. I also used half olive and half vegtable oil. The chops did taste kinda like stake and were delicious. I cooked them in my rocket grill and served with baked beans. I also boiled the marinade and poured a bit over some snap peas. This is good for a change of pace from the standerd baked pork chops and my family enjoyed them. The key is to use equal amounts of oil though otherwise the chops will come out tart and tough from being in lemon juice for so long. Also i did use some cumin and thyme for the marinade.

Excellent recipe!  The lemon juice, garlic, and oregano blended so subtly and perfectly.  I also like the hint be a fellow rater about "pressing" the dish every half hour, while it was marinating in the fridge.  I used boneless pork-chops, and they melted in my mouth!   I also microwaved the remaining marinade, then basted when on the BBQ.

My chops marinated for approximately 6 hours but still tasted very bland. IF, and that's a big if, I ever make this again I'll season the chops with salt & pepper and marinate them overnight.

We grill pork chops ALL the time--and although we always have these ingredients on hand, I've never come up with this combination of flavors to make such a delicious marinade.  I LOVE it when I find recipes that use ingredients I already have to dress up something I make all the time.  A keeper for sure!

I made the marinade when I bought the pork chops on sale and froze the marinade and pork chops in a Ziploc bag.  We just defrosted them overnight in the fridge when we were ready to eat them and then I cooked them according to the recipe.  I put the marinade in the microwave to a boil instead of on the cooktop though.  They turned out fantastic and my husband said to keep this recipe! The only other changes I made was to use fresh lemons and oregano because I had them, but I'm sure I didn't have to.  Really, this is a great recipe and reminds me of a Barefoot Contessa Lemon Chicken that I make a lot.

I made this for my husband and son tonight. (I don't eat meat). They thought it was excellent. I adjusted the seasonings a bit. I used more garlic, halved the salt, and doubled the oregano. I marinated it for about three hours after poking holes in the meat. Will definitely make again.

This is a great way to prepare pork chops.  They turned out moist and delish!  I made a sauce using the ingredients from the marinade(garlic, lemon juice & oregano) and thickened with cornstarch and served with rice.  YUM!

I love this on chicken!  Once I marinated 12 hours, which didn't seem to 'cook' the chicken, as some mention.  Another time I only had 30 minutes.  It was still delicious, but I'd recommend at least an hour.

This recipe was so easy, quick and delicious - I will definitely make it again.  Initially, I was skeptical because there was so little marinade, but it was enough.  The pork chops were full of flavor after just two hours in the marinade.

I have made this twice now and would highly recommend it.  I did not have enough marinade left over to boil and brush on the chops while we grilled them, but we love them just the same.  They are also great as leftovers, by themselves or as a sandwich.  Great flavor.

These were great!  I doubled the suggested marinade amount and let them sit overnight.  So juicy and such great flavor, I didn't even need to save and "reuse" the marinade.  A huge hit amongst my friends!

This recipe is fantastic - I marinated it for four hours instead of the one because I like strong flavours, and the lemon came through beautifully! Will definitely be making this again [and trying it with chicken!]

I used this recipe on boneless chicken breasts - marinated for about an hour and WOW.  They were so tender - the difference was incredible.  I made some plain at the same time and we were almost crying at how much better the marinated breast were ... we will be trying this recipe with Pork Chops this week!

EXCELLENT! I used montreal seasoning for chicken instead of just the oregeno. I think this marinade would be great on chicken, fish, and even steaks! My husband loved it and couldn't believe how simple the recipe was.

The whole family enjoyed these!! Definitely will make these again. I marinated the pork loin chops for 48 hours and the result was amazing. The pork chops really did taste like steak! Thanks for sharing a great recipe. I'm sure it will be one of our most requested!!

I marinated the chops all day,then grilled on the Foreman. My men enjoyed them with a salad and oatmeal muffins. The recipe was too heavy on the garlic for my taste, so I'll cut the amount to half the next time I make them.

This recipe was great and very easy to make. I marinated the meat for 4 hours and the flavor was strong, but mild enough. I will definitely make this again.

These were very good.  I marinated for about 3 hours and then grilled.  I felt weird about using leftover marinade (even after being boiled down) as a sauce so I just left that part out.  There was plenty of flavor from the marinating.

The simple, sodium-free marinade made these chops extra-tasty.  We used four bone-in pork chops and didn't boil the left-over marinade, as there wasn't much left.

This recipe is awesome!!  My husband is not a big pork chop or lemon fan but he LOVED these!  I've been craving them ever since we made them.  They would be great to make for company - they tasted amazing and presented nicely.  This will definitely be a staple in our house.

I used bone-in loin chops as I have found they are much more tender than boneless chops.  I marinated them overnight, using olive oil instead of vegetable.  I garnished the grilled chops with slices of grilled lemon, served with grilled vegetables, a spinach salad and a white Zin.

I marinated 4 large chops (medium thick) using the written amount of ingredients. I did add a bit of fresh garlic pepper from the grinder. In the future, I will add more of everything and cut the salt and black pepper a little bit.
 This is a wonderful recipe for pork chops. We grilled them last night (had friends over) and then reheated them for another set of friends this afternoon. They were still tender and very tasty. Our friends requested the recipe. Thanks!

Simply wonderful!!  Marinated all day 3 chops. Would recommend the full marinade recipe for only 3 chops or double the marinade for 6. These were the best pork chops I've ever made. They were moist, tender and tangy. Will make again and again.

these were ok. They didnt have much zing. Im not a huge pork chop fan so it may just be that. A good variation from the usual though and very easy. I think Ill try a better cut of meat next time and maybe spice it up a bit more. Easy. Thank you.

One word - De-lish! The longer it marinates, the better. Apart from the taste, the best thing about this is you don't have to go out to get special ingredients... I think we all have these things in our pantry - so convenient. The family was VERY satisfied. One word of caution, be sure to adjust grilling time based on thickness of chops. So very easy to overcook pork chops. Otherwise - enjoy! Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy! I added a bit of dijon, honey, and Worcestershire. I know some people don't like tweaks, but I do.  I had two 1 1/2 inch thick boneless chops. I marinated them for about 4-5 hours and grilled them on the BBQ. Lovely. When weather isn't good for grilling, cooking them in a cast iron pan on the stovetop is just as good!

2 hour marinade wasn't enough for me to get the extra taste I was expecting ... think next time I'll prepare in the morning for that day's dinner.

I made it just how the recipe states. I don't measure much when it comes to herbs and spices and tend to add more than the recipe calls for. The whole family loved it.

Made as written and our pork chops came out very moist/tender. Marinated for 4 hours, but the flavors didn't do much for us. I couldn't get past the lemon flavor either. Rating of 3 stars as hubs didn't have this lemon flavor issue, but he felt they were lacking in flavor overall. I rated it a 2, while he rates it a 3. Recipe is easy to make though and again...results in tender pork chops.

Very easy and simple - HOWEVER for those who are doing Whole30 - vegetable oil isn't compliant.  Substitute with your favorite approved oil such as EVOO or my favorite Avacado oil.

We made this recipe almost exactly as it is written.  I did add a bit more oregano but that's it.   We used thick chops with the bone in and let these marinade for about three hours then grilled them standing up.  They were marvelous!

This is a great recipe!   My pork chops were 1/4 inch thick, and were bone in.  Since it was 120 degrees here today in Tucson, I marinated the chops as specified, then dredged them in Italian bread crumbs and cooked them with a little oil in an electric skillet, versus grilling them outside.  My husband loved them!  Thanks for a winner recipe!

I used pork about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. I also used apple wood chips on the coals. It was very good but it didn't taste like steak to me. It tasted like boneless pork chops that stayed very moist from being in the lemon juice all day. I would make it again and I would serve it to guest. Those are my test for all recipes.

The only changes we made were using boneless pork loin and broiled them. The flavor was good but the meat was rather tough.

Just a safety tip-once the meat is put into the marinade it should be discarded at the end of the marinating time. It has been contaminated by the raw meat and even if it is boiled is NOT safe to reuse for basting or as a gravy/topping. If you need to baste with the marinade remove a portion before adding the meat

The pork chops at the grocery store didn't look great, so I used the marinade on some chicken drumsticks. It was amazing! I used a bit more garlic, oregano, and pepper than the recipe suggested. I also brushed the excess marinade onto the drumsticks as I grilled them. It was very flavorful and tender. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Nice simple marinade for store bought  pork chops, which seem to be very bland lately.  Used recipe just as suggested,  and marinated butterfly cut chops overnight. Chops came out juicy!  Will definitely put this recipe in my rotation. Thanks for sharing.

Followed directions exactly but halved the marinade for only 2 pork chops. My husband loved it and my picky teenager ate all!

Great, cheap little dish. The marinade gives a lot of flavor, but definitely double the marinade, or at least the lemon and garlic. The best thing about this recipe though is the incredibly low cost to make it. Any homecook worth their salt (pun intended) has all of these ingredients in their kitchen at all times, so all you need is the pork

Delicious! Hubs and I loved it. Used a grill pan on the stovetop and just barely burned one side and still my husband said to put it in the regular line up. Thanks!

These were simply amazing ! It was just the contrast of flavor I was looking for. Followed it exactly & came out perfectly. I might add chili powder, cayenne, or red pepper flakes next time to spice it up

This marinade was awesome.  I had two 1.5" thick pork chops that were about .5lbs each and marinated them for two hours.  The taste was incredible.  I will consider marinating them for up to 4 hours next time but the lemon juice seemed to react with the pork pretty quickly.  I grilled each chop for about 6 minutes on high each side, turned the temp to medium low and brought them up to temperature.  They came out perfect.  Very tender and juicy.  Served it up with scalloped potatoes and grilled asparagus.  I really can't wait to make this again!

Made this last night on short notice and my family asked me to put this into my rotation and make it at least once per week.  They absolutely loved it.  The only changes I made were olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I used 3 cloves of garlic rather than 4.  I only had time to marinate for an hour and a half, and it was still fantastic.  The marinade/sauce was so good over white rice that I will try to make a little extra next time.  I cant wait to try this on chicken and/or fish.  Great recipe and so easy.

We loved them - they were moist and full of flavor.  Due to the weather, I used the George Foreman grill in the kitchen.  I think they would have been even better cooked on the grill outside.

Grilled Lemon Herb Pork Chops Haiku: "These were bland and dry. Didn't love them, didn't hate. Not a repeat meal." Marinated my pork chops overnight and followed the recipe, only to find that after we grilled them, the texture was too dry, and the flavor was just too subtle. I'll take any excuse to grill so I'm still happy to have tried a new pork chop recipe!

I did this on a pork tenderloin which marinated for several hours then BBQ.  I and DH found that the pork had a taste of lemon only.  For some reason the other spices did not come through.  Will not be making again.

I needed a recipe for pork country ribs that ddidn't includ BBQ sauce.  I tried this one and it was really good.  I will make it again but plan to marinate longer.  Thank you so much Doreenbuch for this recipe.  It's a keeper.

This is a great, quick pork marinade. Excellent for a Greek meal. I use only 1/2 tsp of salt and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Good on chops and tenderloin.

Followed recipe exactly.  Yum-oh!  I only marinated it for 1 hour but I'm sure it'll be better if I let it marinate it longer.  I haven't mastered the grilling technique yet but I've read that you don't want to over cook pork.  If I were baking this, I would want to bake it at low temperature for a longer period of time.  I took that principle to the grill and heated it lower than normal and let it stay on for 10 minutes per side.  Came out very tasty! I do wish I could get the char-grilled mark though.  I will have to experiment to see how I can do that without burning the porks.

Wonderful!  I tried the recipe as written, except I had to substitute pork steaks, since that was what I had.  I marinated for around 6 hours, then used a grill pan.  (My cooking time had to be approximately doubled per side.)  This is a great go-to recipe, and it adds a lot of flavor to the pork!  I served them with seasoned brown rice and roasted cauliflower.  It is definitely one of my husband's favorite recipes!

This is my favorite way to cook pork chops! As a personal preference, I use boneless pork chops, and even though I've never really had the time to marinate them for the full two hours, they always taste great! You don't even need to cook them on an outdoor BBQ, although they would probably taste even better that way. I always make them in a grill pan on the stove, and they are excellent. I usually serve them with saffron rice and veggies, and they're always a big hit!

This is a great recipe. It's hard to believe how much flavor comes from such a simple preparation. I prefer to marinate overnight.

We have made this recipe at least 20 times and we are always surprised at how easy and flavorful this recipe is. I do add an equal amount of basil.  We have marinated for 2 hours and we done it for only 5 minutes.    The longer, the better but it's a winner either way in my house.  Love this served up with mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes

I thought these pork chops were kind of bland and needed more flavor.

Pork chops turned out yummy and not dry, with mild lemon flavour. I have lots of leftovers as I made twice the amount. Heat and serve for dinner tomorrow!

very good.  Slightly strong lemon flavor.  I did double the pepper and oregano just because my husband and I like a lot of spice.  Will definitely make again!

This marinade was amazing and super simple.  I made it my own by adding a little extra garlic (which we love) and using coconut oil in place of the vegetable, for a different flavor.  It turned out fantastic, very juicy flavorful pork chops with just a few hours of marinating!

one of the best pork chop marinades I've come across to date! We were both surprised at how tasty these were for such a simple marinade. I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly but only gave it about 30 mintues to marinade which was plenty of time. They were so flavorful it made us think that 2 hours or over night would be WAY too long/too strong. You could do 2 hours if you have really thick chops..but we think 30 min to an hour for chops 1/2 to 3/4 inch chops is great.

Great seasoning.  Complements the pork and adds enough flavor but isn't overwhelming.  Used fresh squeezed lemon juice.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any minced garlic, so I used about 4 tbs of a garlic spread I found in the fridge. I was in a rush an donly had time to marinate the chops for an hour and a half or so- they still tasted fantastic!

Great recipe and easy to make.  I only had about 2 hours to marinate and forgot to brush the marinade on while cooking but none the less these are great pork chops.  Thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper even for those of us who aren't all that confident on the grill.  I served this with the "Mushroom Orzo" found on this site.  I'll be making both recipes again and soon!

Fabulous!  I used fresh oregano instead of dried because I have some oregano in my garden.  It was wonderful!  This is a great recipe for a summer barbeque.

Yes it is very simple and very good.  Broiled them in oven, and did not heat marinade.  Just basted in the broiler.  They were very juicy!

It was very good!   The only thing that I did different was to pund the chops  with a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. It helped the chops marinade faster. I also added chopped onions to the marinate.  They were so full of flavor and tender.

Was very good I used a few different suggestions I found in the comment's. I put the pork chops in the marinade in a zipp lock bag and rubbed it every hour or so and when it was time to eat I broiled it for 5min. each side and then baked it for 10 min. was very good . thanks for the advice you give.

The chops were good but I don't feel like marinating it overnight did much for the chops. I've made these with the exact same ingredients but I would cook them right when I would put the seasoning on and they taste exactly the same, if not a bit better in my opinion.

Absolutely delicious. My 4 y/o daughter doesn't care for lemons, but she gobbled this down in short order time. Thank you for such a great recipe.

These were delicious. The only thing I added was chopped fresh jalapenos to the marinade and used country style pork ribs. When we put the the chops on the grill I boiled the remaining marinade and added brown suger and some soy sauce and cooked it down and put on the chops right before we took off grill.  They were very tasty. Even without doing that I think they would get a 5 star. Thanks

Pork has never been one of my fav's, but after making this it was sooo good and such a hit!  I marinated the chops overnight and didn't have alot of marinate left to boil, but none the less they didn't need anything on them as all the flavour was in meat.  It was juicy and the lemon flavour smelt and tasted great.  This is a recipe I'll be making more of and it was just as good as having steak!  Truly delicious!!

Just like the heading says "SO SIMPLE YET SO GOOD". I made these with Fasoliyyeh Bi Z-Zayt (Syrian Green Beans with Olive Oil), and Lemony Quinoa and the dinner was fantastic. Thanks for recipe.

My 3 year old went on a "meat strike" for a few months.  She refused to eat anything that looked like meat.  We made the porkchops and she ate 2 whole chops!  My husband and I can't thank you enough for this recipe.  It will forever have a special place in our kitchen.

Good Recipe.  Nice change from boring old pork chops.  I would cut back on the lemon a bit or maybe use some lemon zest instead.  My husband and I both enjoyed it but it didn't knock our socks off.  It was just good.

I have been on all recipes for years.  This grilled pork chop recipe is the reason I actually registered with all recipes today.  I had to write a review about it.  It was simply delicious.  I followed it to a "T" and it turned out awesome.  I marinated the chops for about 4-5 hours and took a hint from someone else about "massaging" the chops ever 1/2 an hour or so.  I really think that added to the flavor and tenderness of the chops.  Even my PICKY 3 year old loved these chops.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are so good!  Way better than I expected...it just seemed too simple to be that good.  I marinated them for about 3 hours and they had just enough lemon flavor and the oregano was a nice touch with the lemon.  Definitely a quick and yummy marinade!

This was a delicious meal.  I paired it with potatoes also done on the grill.  The only thing I will change for next time is increasing the amount of lemon juice in the marinade.  I didn't have any leftover to baste with.

Although I've found lots of wonderful recipes on this site I rarely submit a review - actually I've only submitted one other review since joining in 2008. But this recipes deserves accolades! I was looking for another way to prepare pork chops and came across this recipe. I prepared it exactly as written and it was INCREDIBLE!  DH was thrilled with dinner tonight. Many thanks to the submitter.  We will use this recipe many, many times.

This is great!  The first time I made it, I only had time to marinate it for about an hour. So it was ok but could have been tastier, I figured.  The second time I made it, I marinated it for almost 24 hours.  It made them very moist and tasty!  Add a little extra garlic!  Yum!!!!!

The marinade was good but my pork chops turned out a little dry and tough. I don't have a grill so I tried out someone else's suggestion and cooked them in a covered pan. I must have cooked them a little too long because I marinaded them for over 24 hours. If I make this again (which is pretty doubtful) I will try cooking them in the oven.

My husband really loved this marinade!  We used "pork sirloin" (I'm a vegetarian so that term is as good as useless for me;)) and our handy dandy griddle (around 325 degrees for over 20 minutes).  The pork marinated overnight.  Plus we skipped the oregano and used the jarred minced garlic rather than fresh.  He said they were great - thanks for the recipe - I'm slowly increasing my meat repertoire!

I followed the recipe but there wasn't enough marinade to baste the chops on the grill.  Thus, the flavor was kind of light.  I'll make these again but maybe double the marinade to have some left over for basting.

What a wonderful change from "heavy chops". These have the right amount of zing and are clean to the palate.
Tender and made with ease.
Thanks for the post!

These were really good, but too lemony for my taste.  I think maybe it would help next time if I don't marinate them overnight.  One other thing - I used olive oil because it's much more flavorful than vegetable oil.  This dish sure was easy to prepare though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty!  As several reviewers mentioned, be sure and marinate for "several" hours, but best after marinating overnight.

I put the chops in the marinade and froze them. Cooked them about a week later. Not bad. Reminds me of the swordfish steaks I make so it was kinda weird.

This was OK. Frankly, something in it wanted to burn on the grill. I didn't care for the char flavor. 
They were nice and soft. Dh liked these.
I have had a lime marinade in a bottle I thought was a smidge better and easier.

Super flavorful.  :)  I marinated overnight.  No lemons around, so I substituted them for limes.  I also substituted veggie oil for olive oil, and used chops with the bone.  Really easy as well.

My husband and three small kids all ate it great, my hubby and daughter actually said they loved it!  I however just thought it was okay.  I have learned though that when I hear lemon I think sweet and it definately wasn't sweet.  So out of my family of 5, two rated this a 5, two rated it a 4 and one rated it a 3.  The only thing I changed was I had two really large boneless pork chops so I butterflied them and grilled on the George Foreman.

Terrific marinade!!! I used a boneless country pork ribs and marinaded them overnight. Oh I didn't have anything but ground oregano so I cut it back to 1/8 tsp.

Marinated for six hours, and followed the recipe (added one or two extra cloves of garlic), and the meat was amazingly bland. Maybe fresh-squeezed lemon juice would have made a difference?

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE these pork chops! It is SO easy to put together! I set the resealable bag inside a baking dish in case of any leaks in my bag. Every single time I've made this I've marinaded the pork chops longer than 2 hours and it's just full of flavor! This is definitely a keeper and we'll be making this on a regular basis!

These were really good. I grilled them on my George Foreman grill since the weather was bad. I marinated them for about 3 hours and wasn't able to baste them on that grill. But they took about 7 minutes total to grill and they were very tender and juicy. I had a couple to eat the next day and they reheated nicely too. I will use again...thanks...

No need to marinate more than a couple of hours -- in fact I think that may overwhelm.

Excellent Pork Chops. I only had an hour to marinate but I followed the ingredient list exactly and they still turned out great.  I did leave them on the grill too long so they were a little tough so be sure to watch that. I did not take the time to baste at all during cooking and again still tasted great.  I also have used this marinade for chicken as well and it is very good!

Made the recipe exactly as directed & with outdoor grill.  Chops came out very tender, with a nice flavor.  We will make it again!  Serve it with colorful side dishes because the meat seems to be "whiter" than when we grill chops with other marinades.  Our kids were the ones to call out the color difference.  We served with a caprese salad and Orzo with Parmesan and Basil (recipe on this site).

This was very good.  I had some thicker chops, and the marinade still flavored the meat all the way through in just a few hours. It's going in the "keeper" file.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I made the marinade just as recipe states.  We used bone in pork chops (4) instead of the boneless.  We did marinate these 24 hours prior to grilling and they were excellent. Pork chops are not a favorite in our house but everyone loved these.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I don't have a grill but followed the recipe and pan fried the pork chops.  Best chops that I've had in a long time and I will use this marinade for other meats.  The meat was still tender and flavourful!

I made this for my family last night.  The flavors were really good together, but the whole house smelled like garlic all night!  I didn't boil the marinade & baste while grilling because I had too many other things going, but I will try it next time & see if it makes them a little more moist.

I was too lazy to boil down the remaining marinade and baste while grilling, and it still tasted great from just the marinade. My husband really liked it, I'll make this again.

It was good, but didn't blow me away. Not the strong marinade effect was expecting, I guess I was expecting the lemon and oregano to come through more.

I took the advise of a review and added more lemon and that was a mistake. Also I used a chop with bone in and I MAY try it  again  with less lemon but just wasn't crazy about it.

I marinated the pork all night.  The flavor was great.  I wound up having to cook them on a small stove grill, so they came out a little bit dry.  Still, yummy!

I'm not sure why, but this marinade did not produce a taste I really liked. But that, of course does not mean it is a bad recipe. Different strokes for different folks! Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is a terrific and easy way to make beonless pork chops.  I used a little Italian Seasoning and a few shakes of dried oregano instead of just the oregano and it was very tasty!  Will definately use again.

Delicious!  I even forgot to add the oregano to the marinade so I added some to the marinade while it was boiling so I was able to baste with it.  My husband was very skeptical when I told him what we were having for dinner and he was very pleased with it after all.  Definately a keeper for our family!  Thanks!

I put these in to marinate in the morning and didn't end up grilling them untill the next day so they marinated almost 48 hours but that didn't seem to matter...the chops were very good don't quite agree with taste like steak but thought they were very good and very easy the only thing i did different was to add a little liquid smoke.

I made this for my boyfriend, and I have to say he really enjoyed it. I used a bone in rib chop, and it was VERY tender from this recipe.

However, I must say... there were no "It tastes JUST like steak" comments. I had a bite of it myself, and I am not sure where those reviewers are getting it from. I adore steak, and this doesn't (and probably shouldn't) taste just like steak!

I marinated pork chops with the bone overnight.  Very tender. 

I made recipe here for 4 medium chops and they soaked up virtually all the marinade.  If doing more you may want to make a little more, especially if you want anything left over to baste with.  I had to make more to baste.  But I think they still would have been moist and wonderful without basting.

Did I mention they were the most tender pork chops  have ever had?  They were.

Rave reviews from my guests on these!  I didn't have lemon juice on hand and used pineapple juice and kept my fingers crossed...it was DELICIOUS!!!!  Quick and easy to throw in the fridge in the morning to use for dinner that night.

Delicious! Both kids ate every scrap, even my 13 yo who has a very limited menu.  They all said it tasted like steak (just like the other reviews).  I used olive oil, and orange juice instead of lemon (had none). Very, very good!!

This was so yummy! I didn't change a thing, but I also have to admit that I didn't marinate for more than 45 min. I will definitely be making this again. I can't wait to taste the chops after really, truly marinating...I know they will be moist and tasty! Thank you for sharing this recipe...it is perfect for those of us moms that have more better intentions than time! :o)

I made this recipe as shown, except I used olive oil.  Excellent!  The chops had a wonderful flavor and were moist and tender.  I did have to cook them longer than the recipe stated, but my chops were pretty thick.  Thanks!

The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I marinated for 2 hours.  My whole family liked them very much.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  I will definitely make again!

I made this recipe with both pork and chicken.  Excellent.  actually, the time that I made it with chicken I had to use more lime juice than lemon because I ran out of lemon.  Even better.  I more than doubled the recipe to marinate though, it did not seem enough.  Wonderful!

I don't know, but I just didn't get much flavor out of this recipe.  Marinating them didn't seem to tenderize the chops and, basically, they were just another grilled piece of meat.  Not horrible, but I think there are better marinades available.

This was just delicious.  I made it last night and only let it marinate for about 1 hour.  Cannot wait till try again and let it marinate all day!  Served with a black bean and corn salad and was delicious

This was just okay. It gets points for the marinade being pretty healthy. I almost agreed with those who said it tasted like steak- the outside edges of my pork chops (where the fat was) tasted very much like steak. But the inner part was fairly dry and bland. I have had pork chops prepared in tastier ways, so I don't think this one was a keeper. It did save me having to use my oven on this hot day, though.

Close your eyes and forget you're eating a pork chop and you could actually think it's steak!!  Marinated half-inch boneless chops 48 hours.  We didn't baste them on the grill.

Tried these.  Boring and tough.  If I want something that tastes like steak I will make steak.  Thanks though.

My husband thought this was absolutely excellent with great flavor.  I did not particularly care for the flavor, but it did leave the meat very tender and moist.

Very yummy, only used hslf the oil. Be sure not to overcook the chops, they dry out quickly.  A definate "do again".
