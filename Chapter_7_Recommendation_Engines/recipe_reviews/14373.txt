I just made this salad and it was great!.  My husband and I loved it.  But.....I did change a few things.  First of all I did use all of the Olive Oil plus I added 3 T. of Red Wine Vinegar, garlic powder and 3T of sugar.  Once I added the sugar that was  La Difference!  Viva!  It made all the difference in the world.  The dressing was so good that you could have lapped up the remaining dressing in the bottom of the bowel with some warm buttered French or Italian Bread and made a meal on that alone!  Try it with the sugar.  Its sensational.

This was very tasty!  Go buy a jar of kalamata olives instead, add a splash of red wine vinegar and some garlic and it's even better!

LOVED this salad! Tastes like the ones served at the restaurants!  I reduced the olive oil by 1 TBLS and in its place, I used a TBLS of red wine vinegar! It does get soggy pretty fast so do not pour the dressing over the salad until your just ready to serve.  Still, will make again!

Very colorful salad.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt based on previous comments.  I also will add a little more oregano next time.  Great recipe!

This salad is WONDERFUL.  I have made it once a week since first trying it.  It is very much like what you get at a nice restaurant.  The only change I made was adding two Tbsp. of red wine vinegar to the dressing, and more feta to the salad.  We have it with crusty french bread for a light dinner.

The way the salad was presented allowed one to really appreciate the vegetable flavors. I was on a quest to find the "restaurant style" Greek salad. I added more oregano (doubled the dressing portions) used mediterranian feta, no olives, and red wine vinegar. Now the red wine vinegar gave it the missing zip in my opinion. This may change the healthiness but if I live on this stuff, I am sure it will be great eating vegees regularly! Pita bread is a must w/my Greek salads too! (my next quest~to find a lowfat recipe!)  Thank you!

I LOVED THIS!!!! Was looking for recipe with what I had in the fridge, so I skipped feta cheese n green bell pepper. I used what ever lettuce I had (don't know the name of it :P) and used green olives instead of black. And I also added slices of hard boiled eggs. It was yummy!! Never thought I'd enjoy raw red onions, but they were sweet! I did add a bit of sugar in the dressing.

An INGENIOUS Greek salad recipe... absolutely loved it!  Full of flavour, delicious, hearty and, although best when freshly made, still takes pretty good a day later!

Now THIS is salad and just the way I like it, with simple, classic Mediterranean ingredients and a refreshing, understated, light vinaigrette. I detest heavy salad dressings, or those vinaigrettes heavy in vinegar. This is perfect, and one I'll be making routinely. I thought I had a cuke in the fridge but it turned out to be a zucchini, which worked out beautifully anyway. I used Kalamata olives rather than black, but I'm sure the black olives would have been just as delicious.  I like a 3:1 ratio of oil/acid in my vinaigrettes, so I used 6 T. of olive oil and 2 T. of lemon juice. "Cold and crunchy" foods are generally not my thing, but this is simply outstanding!

Made as-is, the dressing is missing something (hence, 3 stars). But, I followed the review by Suzy and some others, and I thought that with the additions, the dressing was great! I added 3 Tb red wine vinegar, 1 Tb sugar, an extra 1 tsp oregano, 1 clove minced garlic, plus 1/2 tsp garlic salt. After adding all that, I almost forgot to add in the lemon juice and pepper-- don't forget! I used lots of veggies and a full cup of feta...Very good...I could've eaten the whole bowl!

The recipe for the salas was excellent.  However the dressing did not have enough flavor for me it tastes too much just like olive oil.  I added what the dressing recipe called for but also added some fresh garlic about 1 tbsp, 1 tsp red wine vinegar and some garlic salt to taste.  But really good recipe

Greek Salad I Haiku: "Bright & colorful. The dressing was amazing! (Changed it just a bit.)" Scaled it back to 2 servings, but used all the same ratio and type of ingredients (beautiful salad!) I followed another review's suggestion about adding red wine vinegar and a bit of sugar to the dressing and that brought the SHAZAM to this salad. I will definitely make this again.

There's something oddly good about tihs recipe. I make this salad every single week to have on weeknights or for lunch at work (without the fetta usually though to save on calories). The recipe simply has the perfect ratio of ingredients. Each ingredient plays a role and creates a delicious combination. I put some balsamic vinegar on it too. Brilliant stuff.

Effing delicious.  But just like other reviewers suggested, keep dressing and salad separate, as overnight they get mushy.

I was looking for a Greek salad recipe and I thought this salad has a nice mix of ingredients. One thing I noticed was that the tomato and cucumber made the salad a bit too much liquid. Next time I will try it with small cherry tomatoes and leave the cucumber out.  Also, I used a store bought balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

Very good recipe, will use again and again.  The dressing was excellent once 2-3 teaspoons of red wine vinegar was added.

I loved this salad!  I followed others suggestions and cut back on the oil and added a splash of red wine vinegar.  The dressing still seemed to be missing "something" so when I had the leftovers the next day, I added a little bit of garlic powder and that did the trick!!

I have a similar recipe passed on from a friend in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. His recipe calls for some fresh sliced mushrooms, half of a red onion and half of a white onion (for some kick). As well, the dressing is a little different... 6 TBSP olive oil, 3 TBSP red wine vinegar, 1 TBSP Italian seasoning and 2 cloves of garlic mashed with a TSP of salt. Black pepper to taste.

Good.  I liked that the dressing was tasty but subtle so that you could still really taste the vegetables and the cheese.  The feta cheese really made the salad, in my opinion, and I added a bit more of it.  I'll probably make this one again.

Nice combination of flavors.  Makes a lot so make sure you have a lot of people to eat it because the veggies get pretty soaked and are too soggy to eat the next day.

Meh. Dressing is definitely missing something.  Real Greek salad does not contain lettuce...I'll skip this one next time.

Tasty and easy to throw together, but it just doesn't taste like restaurant-style greek salads...  If you're looking for a better dressing, try Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing (from this site).

I also added red wine vinegar and sugar to the dressing and I am glad that I did! Even after the sugar, the lemon taste was still too strong, so I added some Italian spices to mellow it out. Otherwise, this was fabulous! I also added sun dried tomatoes. Everyone loved the salad.

I thought the dressing did nothing for this salad. It definitely needs some red wine vinegar, which I was out of. Probably won't make again.

wonderful recipe - very tasty.  I only changed portion sizes since halving the recipe makes a perfect salad for a family of 4 or 5.  Also, I doubled the dressing amounts, for the entire salad, added salt and made the feta amount (to taste).  I also prefer the Greek practice of serving a slice of feta on each salad rather than crumbling it into the entire salad.

We all LOVE greek salad in my family, extended included. I've been making it for almost 30 years, saw a Greek chef making it, no measurements...some of this and some of that, same as this recipe as far as ingreds. go. The only thing different she added was red wine vinegar but also fresh lemon juice. NOT green olives or sugar! Thanks for posting a great recipe!

Delicious!  I changed a bit.  Took out the peppers and onions and instead of making my own dressing, I used a ready made Greek Vinagrette.  I also added marinated artichokes.

This is a true Greek salad.  You may prefer red wine vinegar or balsamic for your taste and that is great, but I have been to Greece and have good Greek friends and they would definately use the lemon juice.

This turned out pretty good.  I made the following changes: 1) added garlic powder, an extra tsp of oregano, 1 tsp of sugar(to cut the acidity from the lemon), and 2 TBS red wine vingear to the dressing. 2) Subbed chickpeas for the olives due to personal taste. 3) Only used 1/2 of the red onion because it seemed like plenty. 4) Let my dressing sit for a few hours before adding it to the salad so the ingredients could "get to know each other" a little better.   I appreciate how HEALTHY the salad is, and that it was very quick & easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good and healthy, and I intend to make it all summer long.    I halved the recipe and made a few small changes.  Threw in 1/2 t. garlic, a chopped leaf of fresh basil, 1 t. sugar, 1 t. dijon mustard, 1/2 jar artichoke hearts, and 1 T. balsamic.

This salad was awesome! It tasted exactly like my favorite restaurant Greek salad. I followed the advice of other reviews and added some sugar to the dressing. I also added a few capers, banana peppers, roma tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. It was so filling with all the veggies -- they were awesome in this dressing. Is a definite make-again recipe.

I thought the dressing was a bit bland. I added a 4 tablespoons of red wine vinegar to the mix and it was more flavorful

What a wonderful greek salad! A few things I've added or changed: instead of just romaine lettuce, I used an herb mix salad which consisted of a mixture of romaine lettuce, cilantro, dill, arugula lettuce, etc; I omitted the tomatoes; and I also added shredded carrots and two cucumbers instead of one. For the dressing, I didn't have a lemon so instead I used 2 limes.  I also added in oregano, 3 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar and 3 tablespoons of sugar. You can add more sugar, lime juice, oregano, and/or rice vinegar to taste. Then add in some kalamata olives and sprinkle with some feta cheese!  This is great, especially as a refreshing summer salad!

Great! Bell pepper or not. If strictly following recipe note lemons juice differently & range from sweet-tart. A rule of thumb usually is 1 part lemon (or vinegar) to 3 parts oil. Definitely Kalamata olives for authenticity and flavor.

Loved the dressing.  Did add a little more sugar as I think it calls for too much lemon.  Next time I will lessen the amount of lemon I squeeze in.  Tasted just like a greek salad from Mr. Greek!

This was a good Greek salad.  Some modifications: used only about half the onion, and it still seemed like almost too much; for the dressing I used only 4 tbs of oil and added 2 tbs of red wind vinegar along with a clove of garlic minced. Also, you can add or omit veggies to suit your taste.  Definitely worth trying!

This was a good salad you can start on and expand on.  I added capers in my salad as well as shrimp which i marinated in oregano.  I also cut back to 1 TBl of olive oil and added a bit of balsamic vinegarette.  Next time i will try the red wine vinegar with olive oil.  I also added chives and the baby sweet tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes, i think the sweetness of those tomatoes is great.

I don't think that it needs as much oil as the recipe calls for. About half of what's called for works just as well as long as you add a little more lemon juice. It's also a good way to lower the fat content.

This salad tastes fabulous, especially the dressing.  I somehow had no oregano so I substituted thyme instead and it still came out very tastey.  This salad makes a lot so it's great for the rare moments when the whole family eats together.

This salad was very good. The addition of peppers to the classic Greek Salad ingredients made for an interesting twist. The dressing is a bit bland - like others I jazzed it up. I added 3 T. wine vinegar, a dash of sugar, some crushed garlic, 1 tsp. each of salt, oregano, and basil.

It's really a tasty and nutricius salad!! TRY IT!!
The most important in this salad is the olive oil.
Try to use extra virgin olive oil.
Also in Greece we add some greek rusks. Cretan rusks are the best! FINALLY don't miss to dive some bread in the remaining oil in the plate.

Wonderful salad, loved it, I read one reviewer's suggestion of adding red wine vinegar and sugar to the dress and it just made it PERFECT.  I'd definitely recommend using kalamata olives, they make a big difference.

I made this salad exactly as written and enjoyed it very much.  All the flavors went well together and the dressing was nice and light.  I keep a lot of these ingredients on hand so I'll be making this often; maybe next time I make it I'll try some of the other suggestions such as adding red wine vinegar and a touch of sugar.  Thanks for the great salad recipe!

This was good, but for some reason it didn't seem like a cohesive recipe.  It didn't feel like a lettuce salad to me, and yet the primary ingredient was lettuce.  I wish I could pinpoint what I'd like to change, because I'd love to tinker with this and make it again, but I'm not sure what changes to make.  I'm actually thinking of making it into a pasta salad.  That said, this was still a tasty dish, and I made the following changes: added a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar and some sugar to the dressing, reduced the olive oil by about a tablespoon, reduced the onion a little, and used kalamata olives instead of black (a great substitution if you don't mind the extra cost).  The amount of dressing didn't look like enough, but it was just right.
UPDATE: I made this with orzo pasta instead of lettuce and I really liked it.  Lettuce is healthier, of course, but I'll make it again with the pasta substitution.

Of 19 recipes, this is the only greek salad with lettuce.  This is what I remember eating at Bertucci's when I was a kid on Cape Cod!  It was so excellent.  I left out the oil and lemon juice and used the Greek Souvlaki Dressing recipe instead.  Soooo yummy!

Beautiful colored salad. Dressing very bland. Ended up adding sugar, italian seasoning mix (oregano, rosemary, basil) garlic and red wine vinegar.

Nice! I used yellow peppers cuz thats what I had and spicy green greek olives instead of black. I love the simple dressing for this that lets you taste everything else. Thanks!!

Wow! This was a surprise hit. I tossed this together last minute and turned out a beautiful and delicious cool summer salad. I used onion powder since I was out of onion, kalamata olives, diced up my cucumber, left out the bell peppers, and used mint intead of oregano and tossed on a pinch of kosher salt. Served this on red lettuce leaf for a beautiful presentation. I am still surprised my household of guys loved this. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good!  I didn't think the dressing was going to work when I tried a dab after making it.  But when it mixes up with everything else in the salad it was just right.  I did add a bit of sugar though.  I was a bit confused because when I skimmed the reviews someone added more sugar.  In any case the end result was what I was looking for.  Thanks!

A great recipe!  The dressing is very simple, but much better than many creamy dressings I've had in the past.

This salad was SO good! It even made enough for me to eat for lunch the next day. I scooped out my tomatoes and cucumbers so it wouldn't get too soggy.

I didn't, however, use the dressing in this salad. I used a Greek dressing recipe from this site. I think this dressing would still be great.

Went on the DDP yoga diet plan this week and all these fresh ingredients fit right in, even feta cheese! Less red onion, added spinach and my non-vegetarian hubby added lean chicken breast for a meal. Best Greek salad I've ever had - thanks for posting!

I followed this recipe exactly.  Good salad, but not memorable on its own.  I was expecting the "restaurant style" Greek salad, but this is not it.  It seems to be missing something.  I think for next time I will add a splash of vinegar as another reviewer suggested.

Just made it tonight and loved it!  The lemon juice made it taste so fresh but not overly-tart.  Great balance with all the other ingredients.  I used Calamata olives (pitted).  Went together very quickly too!

I made this salad for a family event. EveryOne LOVED it. I added the T of  sugar as "Susy" suggested.  I also used the jar of kalamata olives. It completly made a difference.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.

This recipe was great. We added more vegetables (an additional pepper and more olives). The dressing made more than we needed so next time we will increase the veggie content and leave the dressing on the side so we can have fresh Greek salad the next day.

This was ok but just did not have any zing to it.  I followed other people's advice and did add some sugar and a little red wine vinegar to the recipe.  It wasn't a disaster, but not something I will make again

I'm glad to have tried this, but will most likely seek out other dressing recipes as this was quite bland(as noted by several other reviewers).  I did like it's simplicity, though.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Salad is great.  I left out the onions.  I agree with others the dressing is missing something.

I made this recipe for my sons 3rd birthday party, it was liked by everyone who likes to eat pasta and or salad.
I loved it myself. I did not add the pepperoni as I wanted this to be a vegetarian side dish.
Overall it was easy to make and it did stay well overnight.
thanks for this recipe.

A simply wonderful salad. Very easy to prepare. The dressing works beautifully with the feta. I've made it several times in the past few weeks and loved it every time.

I made this salad as a late night snack and was very pleased with the texture and flavor. Light, filling, crunchy and it cured all my cravings with a bit of sweet from the raisins. It was wonderful. Will definitely be adding it to my collection. i did have to tweek the salad dressing though, it was too bland. I simply added a tablespoon of rice vinegar with a 1/4 tsp of pepper. I think you have to definitely do the dressing to your own liking. But other than that I was satisfied. The feta cheese adds the perfect blend of flavor against the raisins. Thanks for the recipe.

It was good, but I felt like it didn't have much flavor, but maybe greek salad just doesn't have a strong flavor. I did add 2T of sugar, some garlic powder and some salt. I didn't have Red wine vinegar on hand which several people recommended. That probably would have helped. Also it's a huge salad, I will definitely half it next time I make it for my family and use only 1/2 of the onion.

Excellent salad.  Used Greek olives and more than called for.
Used Grape tomatoes
Used Brochette seasoning instead of Oregano.

I love Greek food, and especially a good Greek Salad.  And, this is it.  We don't really care for feta so we eliminate it.  That was the only change I made.

I made this even though I know it's not a true "Greek Salad". Real Greek salad does NOT have lettuce. Sure you might have gone to a little restaurant and they gave you lettuce, but again, it's not a real Greek salad.  I wanted to give this a try to see if it was good even though it's not what I'm used to. The lettuce didn't work for me. It seem too ...out of place with the other textures and tastes.

The salad itself was great. I added Greek peperocini. But the dressing was not good. Was pretty much just olive oil. I added balsamic which helped. A day later it was much better.

Followed the recipe. I didn't have olives but it was still the best Greek salad I have had till date. This recipe will be my go to recipe whenever we crave for this salad. Thank you for the recipe :)

I made this for a dinner with friends and they all said they liked it but I think they were just being polite. It probably would have been good with the garlic added.

Followed recipe & DH said it was a keeper! He likes Greek salad & rated this one as equal to anything you'd get at a restaurant, if not better!

Exactly the right proportions, adding a little bit of vinegar, and the whole thing turn out to be DELICIOUS !

Only thing I did not do was make my own dressing due to time, the salad was quick and easy to make, I used real greek olives instead of black, black olives are too bland. The olives were a bit pricey, but good friends are worth a little extra, they loved it. They never had a greek salad

Quite a good salad! The kalamata olives really give it flavor. I wanted a bit more umph from the salad dressing but it as better than store bought Greek dressing.

Top with some canned tuna - my favourite lunch/light dinner! I bought sheep's milk feta once and now I will never go back... even though it's a little bit more expensive, I think it makes it so much more flavourful and authentic.

Made this and it was pretty good.  Did as others suggested: add more oregano, bit of garlic, red wine vinegar, increased the feta, and a bit of salt.  Made the mistake of adding sugar. It no longer tasted authentic.  If you do add sugar, keep it under 1/2 tsp.

Great salad recipe.  I left out the peppers because we don't like them.  The dressing was perfect.  Now I know how to make Greek salad at home!
