I had mint and zucchini that I needed to use, and I have to admit that I made a half batch of this as an expirement - because I was a little afraid I would hate it. I love it! I sliced the zucchini a little thicker so it wouldn't get too soft. Excellent, interesting, and refreshing! I'm so glad I tried it. Thanks for the recipe, a keeper!

This tasted like pickles, which was great for sandwiches!

If you can cook the zucchini in a grill pan the better. You need high heat and brown/sear marks on them and they should not be overcooked. They need to have a tender crunch to them. If you dont like mint, then this recipe is NOT for you.

Maybe it was the type of mint I used, but this recipe just wasn't it for me.  I found the mint to be overwhelming and it just wasn't what I was expecting.  I was just trying to use up some zucchini so it's no great loss.

Really did not care for this at all. I thought the flavor was a bit unappealing.

I had some "baby" zucchini that I needed to use plus an abundance of mint in my garden, so was delighted when I saw this recipe.  If I made this again I'd use canola oil to avoid the "congealed" olive oil after it had chilled for several hours, but I seriously doubt that I will make it again.  It just wasn't quite the taste I hoped it would be.

My dad has TONS of zucchini in his garden this time of year and we are always looking for different recipe.  I really liked this after it sat and marinated for a few hours.

We all loved this.  I used balsamic.  A great summer side dish.

I can't get enough of this!  I have a huge mint patch and lots of zucchini, so this recipe is perfect!  I am a zucchini-lover no matter how it is prepared, and if you are, too, I would highly recommend this recipe!  It is very simple to make and makes for a wonderful meal all by itself.
