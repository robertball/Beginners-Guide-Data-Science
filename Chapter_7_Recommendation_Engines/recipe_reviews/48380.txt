Smoothie fanatics will want to add some ice to this recipe; that or freeze the banana and berries before putting in.  I thought it was a little bitter, so try more banana/less kiwi, or a sweetened yogurt.

I should have read the reviews before trying this recipe. It was pretty tart and bitter for my taste. I think I will try it again, but freeze my fruit first and use vanilla yogurt instead of plain.

Tasty! I had no mint leaves on hand or tangelos. I used a satsuma instead (just one)...and two kiwis and two bananas. No soy milk either, instead unsweetened vanilla Almond Breeze. I also used a vanilla flavored yogurt that came with cream on top. So mine is probably sweeter and tangier (because of the satsuma) than this exact recipe.

I have made this several times now and with my changes, of course I think it is worth 5 stars.  Without them maybe 2 stars.  As written it almost seemed acidic to me so I exchanged the tangelo for mango and eliminated the berries and sugar.  Either almond milk or 1% are my preference and fat free Greek yogurt.
