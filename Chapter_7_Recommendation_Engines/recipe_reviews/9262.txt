This fruitcake is super moist . I made it on Sunday and ate it on Monday and it was like a fruitcake that had been maturing for 3 months.  Great if you are behind in your fruitcake baking for christmas. Which is exactly what I want it for.

All of Carol's recipes are great.
I have tested them time and time again and all over the country I hear the same.  I do set my oven on 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours.  It seems to work best for me. instead of the 3

I don't even like fruitcake that much--or I didn't think I did! But this cake is so moist and awesome I went on an apricot baking spree. My husband thought I was crazy for baking cakes all day until he took a bite. ;]

My go to fruitcake recipe. Have been making this for several years and get requests for this cake year round. I enjoy the cake after a bit of seasoning but is good right out of the oven.

I don't know if I did something wrong but this cake turned out very dry.  I'm a pretty good baker and followed the directions to the letter.  My oven temp is true and I didn't overbake it.  I liked the fact that the pur√©ed apricots went into the batter. Does anyone have any suggestions because I really wanted this recipe to work.
