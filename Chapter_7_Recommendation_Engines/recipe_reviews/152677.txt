This really is a delicious dish and you will definitely please your guests.  I have to say, the first time I made it, I followed the directions and while it tasted really good, it looked a little flat.  The next time I made it I used 6 eggs, instead of 4 and 7 slices of bread instead of 5.  It was perfect.  NO leftovers!  It was a big hit!

Served this with Easter dinner and everyone loved it!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and was a bit skeptical when mixing everything together as the mixture was lumpy and inconsistent; however it baked up beautifully and was delicious!

This turned out great. I made it exactly as written except used an 8x8 pan. I did not think it was too buttery or too sweet. It is just perfect. You could definitely use this as a side dish or a dessert. It was done in exactly 45 min. I will definitely make this again.

WOW!  This was awesome!  Very sweet and rich.  Added 1/4 c of the juice because I put my bread on a cookie rack overnight and they turned into croutons - whoops!  Used 6 slices of cheap white bread.  Baked just perfect at 45 min.  Will DEF do again!!!  Update: just made this again for the 2nd time and used margarine (all I had on hand) and it was not as good as the first time with butter!!!  Use butter!!!

I doubled the recipe for 16 and placed it in 9x13. It smelled a little buttery, but after eating it, it tasted so good. If anything it was sweet not buttery. It actually is good cold or hot in my opinion.

This is the simplest recipe and is flat naughty.  I went to a wedding that served this as a side dish and everyone couldn't get enough of it.  I came home destined to find this recipe and found it here of course.  The only addition that I made was an extra slice of bread.  This recipe takes literally 5 minutes to get in the oven.  I've served it at Thanksgiving as a side to bake ham and also as a dessert.  Adding a little ice cream to the dish is always good as a dessert too.  The dish is always empty and the first to go.  The items are always in most pantry cupboards which makes it great.  Kids and adults love it.  I've had to give this recipe to many and still get requests.  Give it a try you won't regret it especially if you love a custard or bread pudding.......YUM!
UPDATE:  I have made this so many times and I can't have Thanksgiving without it.  I have expanded on it although it is awesome the way it is.  Try adding a handful of golden raisins and some toasted pecans......so delish!

I have made this recipe for years, actually since 1987, and long before I found it on this site.  It is now a tradition in our family, and is on it's fourth generation of bakers!  However, the original recipe I received did not have the 1/3 cup of brown sugar included.  I made it with the brown sugar to see if it is different, and it was entirely to sweet.  Simply removing the brown sugar makes this recipe light, fresh and just a perfect combination.  We eat it both as a side dish, or even as a desert at all holiday functions, and whenever the mood strikes.  Enjoy!

Strange recipe, but great tasting and easy to make. The texture is like a cross between a bread pudding and a souffl√©.  The flavor is sweet enough to be called a dessert but mild enough to be served as a side to a savory main dish.  I will be adding this recipe to my list of favorites!  Thanks for sharing.

This was very nice.  Next time I will reduce the butter as is was a bit too much for us, that is just a personal preferance though.  It's rather good the next day cold. This will be one of those recipes you make over & over again, thanks for submitting.

I wanted to love this. I love pineapple, bread, and sweets. However it was just too sweet, and the texture and taste were not very good. I threw most of it out after a couple of days of picking at it.

Great recipe, a little too sweet for me, I would reduce the sugar a bit. Only had diced pineapple on hand, blended it a bit with the mixer. Overall it was yummmy and gone the next day!

I made a mistake and creamed both the white and brown sugar together. It still turned out really delicious. I sprinkled the top with a little more brown sugar and put on a few maraschino cherries before baking. I also added 1/8 tsp of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon to the batter.

I must have done something very wrong with this recipe.  I thought it was just terrible.  I did use fresh pineapple.  Maybe that was the difference.  I tried quite a few things to salvage the  ingredients, but it just didn't work.  I love bread/fruit combos and thought this would be great.  I just ended up with a mushy mess.

It's a great recipe - my family loved it, especially the leftovers. However, the sugar content is way too much, so I cut it  to 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still quite sweet. I did add 1/4 c. of the juice. I am planning to serve it at my New Year's brunch.

Followed one of the reviews suggestions and increased the eggs to 6.  I used Pepperidge Farm Sandwich White bread and increased 10 slices.  1 hours later....perfect.

I had made this recipe a long time ago and made it again recently for my husband to try.  I love it because, like someone already mentioned...super cheap.  Also, its great for getting rid of items.  You know how most people don't eat the ends of a loaf of bread? Use those! Or the ones in the bag that aren't as soft as you'd like for your sandwich.  Then, I use canned pineapple often but I don't alway use it all up so this is a great way to use it as well.  I use custard cups for that reason as well...don't usually make a lot so I don't have a pan small enough and they're already pre-portioned for me and look so darn cute.  Also, I love how its typically ingredients you always have on hand.  I think the proportions are fine except on the sugar! I forgot how sugary they were.  I will definitely cut back on the white and brown sugar next time, but even with that, its still got so many things going for it that it should get all 5 stars!

Very good. Bc I used a 9x13 dish, I think it may need to bake a little longer (10-15 minutes). Great taste though!

This turned out very well in spite of me messing up a bit! I used a larger pan than needed so it was pretty thin but I realised my mistake when it was still baking so took it out sooner. I used splenda in place of sugar and the splenda brown sugar mix for the top. A good dish when you want to serve something out of the ordinary!

A nice way to use up old bread and a very ecomonical dessert. While I give it full marks for creative and thrifty; I think it could use a little less butter. Mine I felt came out a little greasy and I am a big girl who is not afraid of butter but I felt it overwhelmed the pineapple and I could not taste the fruitiness but special thanks to the very creative cook who dreamed up this easy, fast and cheap dessert! Thanks it is a keeper.

I used 6 eggs and 8 slices of white sandwich bread, half a teaspoon of vanilla, only used 1/2 cup white sugar and the brown sugar, and I sprinkled brown sugar on top. My family said it was amazing. This was my first time trying it, I think I will keep my adjustments but cook a little longer next time, was a little too mushy for my liking.

This has been a favorite for years. I do cut the sugar in half. I make it every time I cook a ham, and everyone loves it.

Made according the recipe - after twice the cooking time it was still soup.  more than doubled the bread and cooked again for more than time stated - still not serviceable was the consistency or thin polenta.    A waste of ingredients.

Great dish for potlucks! This is really easy and cheap to make! I used 5 eggs instead of 4 and an extra piece of bread for a 9X9 pan. I also used regular white sugar instead of brown. It was good but not as sweet as I was hoping, so next time I'll add a bit more sugar in the mix. All in all though, it was a win in my house.

Yum!  I had half a can of crushed pineapple to use up, so decided to try this recipe.  I halved all ingredients except the bread.  I used a full 3 slices.  I also baked it in the small individual baking cups as shown in the pictures.  It made 4 individual servings and took about 40 minutes to bake.  Started them at 325 degrees and turned it up to 350 for the last 10 minutes. They turned out great.  Only problem I had is where to store the recipe.  Dessert?  Bread?  Breakfast? Sidedish?  Works for all four!

We weren't fans. Decreased the sugar as suggested and it was still too sweet as well as way too buttery.

Great as a dessert, but even so, we cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup. Liked the brown sugar topping...add finely chopped walnuts and cinnamon to it for autumn dessert.

We love this recipe.  I didn't have white bread, but had french bread and guessed on the amount.  It turned out wonderful.  I am making it again this weekend for Christmas dinner at our church.

Finally found this recipe online that is the same as one that's been our family's favorite with ham for many years. It's great! Ours didn't use the brown sugar on top, but I'll try it that way today.
