Very good soup. I added some celery and mushrooms. Followed the recipe to the letter - even using shredded cheddar cheese which is something I don't use too often in soups b/c it tends to give soups a gritty texture instead of a creamy texture. Next time I think I'll ditch the cheddar and use some velveeta instead but it was still very good and this recipe proves that soups containing only veggies are still very tasty!! Thanks Jackie!!

I needed to make a stick to the bones kind of soup and this was excellent and easy. I also added mushrooms celery and fresh string beans. My family absolutely loved it and had to make a double batch the next time I made it. I also used 2% milk and half cheddar cheese and half american cheese to give it a more smooth texture. Great recipe. Bon apetit.!!!

I really loved this soup! But I must admit I tweaked it a little...I put a mixture of velveeta and cheddar in it but not the full 2 cups it calls for. I also added galic to the soup instead of the bread crumbs. I substituded milk instead of half and half. I'm not sure but I think half and half would have made it REALLY thick. Extremely tastful...loved it!

This creamy soup is absolutely delicious! If you have a food processor or some kind of chopper the vegetable preparation goes really quick. We used fresh veggies in our soup and it was wonderful! Definitely what comes to mind when you think of hearty homemade comfort soups. This will be a family favorite from now on!! Great recipe!!!

My whole family (4 children and husabnd) loved this soup. I used evap milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and I pureed the broccoli. My 6 year old will not eat broccoli. It did turn the color a bit green but once you add the cheese it is not so noticable. She was the one who declared "This is the best soup ever!!!" Great recipe.

For some reason my cheese seperated into clump and caused it to be a gritty texture. But wow did anyone notice the fat and calorie count for this recipe??? All I can say is WOW 55 grams of fat a serving!!!!

This soup does indeed taste great. However I'd recommend cutting down on the butter significantly. There's so much dairy in the soup that it overwhelms the vegetables.

Very good! I did use Velveeta as suggested by another reviewer. Next time I'll try it with milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 as it was a little rich. Also added green beans and peas for extra veggies.

This soup was a hit! We made a few changes just because of lack of or availablity of ingredients. We sauteed some celery and sliced mushrooms with the onion. Instead of cooking in water we added chicken broth instead. And since we didn't have half & half we used 2% milk. We also used a cup of shredded cheddar and a 1/2 block of velvetta since the other readers suggested it. My husband said that this is the best soup that he ever ate. Restaurant quality! We'll definitely make it again. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

OUTSTANDING!!!! this soup is out of this world. the only change i made was to sub potatoes for the red peppers out of personal preference. very easy to make very hearty and filling cheesy but not over the top thick and oh so goooood! i served it with homemade garlic onion cheese bread and there were no leftovers.

this was really good. a bit too much half and half for me though and i'd lower the amount next time. i also used vegetable broth instead of the water/chicken bouillon combo.

My husband and I have been looking for a recipe that was simular to a soup we had eaten before. This is by far the closest and best Cheesey Veggie Soup we have ever had! I did however I used 1/4 cup butter instead of a full 1/2 cup. We will be having this often! YUMMMMMMMMM! Thanks for sharing.

WOW!! I loved this recipe. I only changed a couple things due to what I had on hand. I used a can of evaported milk and added water to it to make 2 cups. I also added mushrooms to sauting onions and pressed in a couple garlic cloves. Wonderful recipe for cold Febuary evening. Thank you.

I had some pea corn bean and carrot veggies to use up and used them here. I think a stick of margarine (I used butter) was too much. 1/4 Cup would have been plenty. Was easy enough and quick enough to make. Thanks for posting.

This is the best soup I've ever eaten! I didn't have half and half so I used a mixture of evaporated milk (no fat) whole milk and heavy cream to make the 2 cups of milk. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and would make it the same way again. It was fabulous and will become one of the main meals in my home.

I liked how easy this soup was to make and thought it was pretty good. I used just one cup of half & half and used milk for the other cup. I think I also would use Velveeta next time so it'll be a little smoother. You can really substitute whatever vegetables you have on hand I didn't have cauliflower so I used potatoes instead and it still turned out great.

I needed a fast kid-friendly meal for a hungry crowd. I didn't use onions because some guests hate onions. So I created a roux by melting 1/2 cup butter and adding 1 cup flour and cooked over medium heat until bubbly. I added 6 cups vegetarian "chicken" broth and a large bag of frozen mixed vegetables. I added 2 cups cubed Velveeta and cooked until it melted. I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder. Meanwhile I cooked a package of spiral pasta drained and added it to the soup. I added 4 cups of milk and heated through. It came out more like macaroni and cheese with vegetables. It fed 6 adults and 2 toddlers when served with garlic bread and crackers.

This was really good! I didn't have any broccoli so I doubled up on the cauliflower. Also I didn't have half an half so I used mostly milk with a little cream. It's SO good!

We really enjoyed this soup and I would make it again for sure. I did reduce the amount of margarine to about 2 or 3 Tbsp and I also used chicken broth instead of water/bouillon. Lastly I reduced the amount of cheese to about 1 cup the end result was tasty and satisfying (not to mentino super quick to make). We will very likely make this again.

You can make a basic white sauce (béchamel) and add chicken broth and a good splash of white wine as well and have the same results. I used frozen mixed vegetables and I also seasoned with garlic and onion powder season salt pepper and Mrs. Dash no salt table blend seasoning! This was awesome and my two year old loved it!

I doubled this recipe. Instead of using one cup of each veggie I just used a large bag of mixed vegetables. I also used half a block of velveta cheese and one whole bag of sharp cheddar. I used pepper and seasoning salt and onion powder. It turned out great!

honestly I use recipes mostly as guides but this was a good one. I'm reviewing this in case there's someone who wants to tweak using a slow-cooker. I added the water and veggies cooked for 2.5 hrs on high (I added celery) used a hand blender to puree the veggies added chicken milk and cheese and served. It was great.

This soup was amazing! I made it tonight for the first time... was in a bit of a hurry so I grabbed a 12oz frozen Mexican vegetable bag with broccoli cauliflower corn and red pepper which was the perfect size. I also used 1% milk instead of half-and-half and added some Velveeta along with the mixed cheddar. My boyfriend is pretty picky about soups and even he gave it the thumbs up - definite new staple!

Very tasty just be sure not to let it boil. I used a crock pot that I forgot to turn down and the milk slightly curdled but the group didn't notice b/c of the small vegetable pieces anyway. Big hit. Some of my group made it at home too.

Simple and wonderful!! I substituted 2% milk for the half and half and added some angel hair pasta to please my children:) It was FANTASTIC!! I recommend cooking the pasta before adding it it really took up a lot of moisture adding it dry.

We loved this! I did cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and only added 2 TB flour and used 2% milk. As written I think it would be fantastic I just wanted to cut down on the "un"healthy parts I knew I could adjust. I added a big bag of frozen cauliflower celery and one small diced carrot. I think the broccoli as called for would have been a great addition! I just used what I had though and it was delish! My kids begged for more until the pot was GONE! Oh I also added diced chicken to hubby's to give him a dose of protein....try it!

This was wonderful! I was looking for a recipe to use up vegetables from our CSA. My 3 kids are some of the pickiest eaters in the universe and they ate this down - fast! Because I didn't have the specific vegetables on hand I shreded up the odds and ends I had left (potatoes cabbage zucchini bell peppers and carrots) to make 4 cups of vegetables. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. We had fresh bread to go with it. This will be one of our regular meals from now on!

Not as labor intensive as I thought it was going to be. The only thing I changed was increasing carrots and broccoli as I had no cauliflower and sauted celery with the onions. Excellent flavor!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was OK but I think it had WAY TOO MUCH butter. I would cut the butter by at least half next time. I also would just use 2% milk instead of the half and half. It just had a very greasy taste that I didn't care for.

I used what I had which was about a half or more of a head of cauliflower - looked close enough to two cups to me. I also halved the butter and sautéed the onion put in the cut up cauliflower right on top grated a carrot on top so it would cook faster and added the water and bullion. Veggies were cooked in 5 minutes or so. Used regular milk into which I mixed about 2T cornstarch instead of the 4T or 1/4c flour brought to a boil stirred and simmered until thickened added a skimpy amount of the 2c of cheese (yes this recipe is otherwise loaded with butterfat) and absolutely delicious. Like what Grandma used to make!!! It goes together quickly and only takes about 5 or 10 minutes of cooking. I think where problems with cheese have occurred is that you can't boil a soup or sauce after melting cheese into it - the cheese will lead things to separate or become "gritty." Only heat until the cheese barely melts. Delicious!

Really good soup we loved it. I only changed one thing and that's the half and half I used one cup of it and the other cup of milk because my son can't take to much cream. Delicious recipe!!

Great soup! With the exception of using celery mushrooms broccoli and cauliflower made just as it directed. Very good soup for chilly autumn nights. I served with a rustic bread would be good with a salad as well.

I had a bag of California blend veggies in my freezer that needed to be used. So I plugged in broccoli cauliflower and carrots into Allrecipes ingredients search and found this soup. I decided to give it a go. I used only 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2. I used the entire 12 oz. bag of veggies and after simmering them a bit I used my immersion blender to blend them into tiny bits. Then I added the half and half and continued with the recipe. I did use 4 oz. sharp cheddar and 4 oz. American cheese. Wonderful soup! Delicious and comforting on this cold winter night.

Good soup for a fall night! Easy to make too. I added celery, red pepper, and a medium potato and always use low sodium chicken broth. Will make again!

Although the taste was good and I liked the idea of using non-processed cheese I found it too rich and heavy. I think you could easily cut down on the butter and I used 1/2 milk and the rest half and half. You must follow the recipe's instructions in order or you end up with a buttery top to your soup (I boiled all veggies in the bouillon instead of in the thick sauce).

End result was delicious. However because I do not make trips to the store to fulfill a recipe so I used what I had and adapted it a bit. I made this on fridge cleaning day. Used a TBL butter to saute onions and celery. Added lightly steamed broccoli and carrots to the saute and near the end of cooking 1 c of leftover cauliflower and cheese. I had the hambone left from Easter so I made broth (3 cups) and got a cup of chopped meat which I also added at the end. The rest of the butter (I never use margarine anymore) I melted and mixed in the flour simmer a few minutes to cook the flour. Added the ham broth and 1/2&1/2 and whisked till smooth forming a thin to medium white sauce. Add the cheese to the white sauce and mix until the cheese is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the sautéed vegetables ham and in this case the cauliflower & cheese. I used salt pepper garlic thyme and rosemary to taste. So no velveta which I saw in a number of broccoli soup recipes and I think is kinda icky. So this a more homemade version which I really appreciate. Thank you for the idea.

I enjoyed this soup very much. It was easy to make. I didn't have any half n half so I used heavy whipping cream with a little added water so it wouldn't be to thick. I also had to use a chicken soup base powder as I was out of the chicken bouillon. The soup taste a lot like a chicken pot pie so after I had a bowl for lunch I added peas and leftover chicken. It's like comfort in a bowl I can hardly wait to have more. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. Andrea

I've made this twice now and absolutely love the taste. The kids devour it but first I have to be sure to puree it mostly smooth otherwise they tend to mostly eat around the vegetables. I easily pureed right in the pot with a hand blender. I used less margarine than the recipe called used broth instead of the water and bouillon and added garlic powder. Oh I also used half canned evaporated skim milk with half milk in place of half and half to reduce fat.

This recipe was pretty good but not quite as tasty as I had hoped. I did make a few changes however based on my current kitchen stock. I used a little garlic instead of onion and 1C heavy cream and 1C milk instead of 2C half-and-half. It was serviceable and nice for lunch on a cold winter day. Do not forget the croutons though! The soup absolutely requires them in my opinion!

Good soup with some alterations. I finely chopped onion carrots and some celery in half the butter with some olive oil then added 2-3 cloves fresh garlic. I then added the flour to make a roux slowly adding broth. I reduced broth by 1 cup and added a cup of beer. After adding brocolli and cauliflower allowing them to cook til tender I used my immersion blender to smooth leaving some chunks. I also cut the half n half with regular milk as others suggested. Added fresh thyme freshly ground nutmeg and pepper to taste. Served at a church potluck with many compliments.

This was the best meal I had all week!! The cheese really makes the dish and the veggies and onions I used a vidalia onion making it sweeter. I needed to chop the veggies up I used a pack of mixed frozen veggies but still tasted really good I actually also ran out of half and half and ended up mixing half and half with milk and a little evaporated milk (you buy it in a can). But it was creamy and delicious!! Thanks!!

Delicious quick and easy. To cut down on the fat and calories I used half the butter and 1 cup half and half and 1 cup 2% milk. It was still rich and creamy. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum! Great taste and not too cheesy. Pretty rich with all the 1/2 and 1/2. Could use part milk.

We added garlic to onion sauté. We also added fresh mushrooms peas and celery. Instead of margarine definitely use butter and chicken broth. We followed the suggestion of velveeta for 1/2 but also used cream cheese and mozzarella to keep the cheese flavor mild. Delicious Jill and Jim Baton Rouge

Sooo good. Excellent comfort food. We've made this a few times and will continue to do so we love this so much. We just get that frozen bag of veggies and use that. It doesn't take long to make either. So glad we found this!

My husband and I loved this soup.   I used 1 cup of shredded cheese and velveeta to make up the rest  because it was what I had in the house.  I added capers to because I had them in the fridge.  I will make this again.

I had to double the thickening recipe. I also did not chop the vegetables as fine as what it called for and liked it very well. I added an extra cup of cheese because it didn’t seem very cheesy and was still pretty white instead of yellow.
