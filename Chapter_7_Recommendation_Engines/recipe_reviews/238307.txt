This is delicious!  The only change I made was I put in some broken up fresh raspberries instead of the crush pineapple since my kids don't care for pineapple.  It was great.

This was very good and very easy to make.  I subbed strawberry pie filling for the raspberry because I didn't want to pay the ridiculous price they had on the raspberry.  It was really good and was a big hit at our Thanksgiving table, even from some doubters that thought they wouldn't like it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made no changes, it was delicious! I wasn’t sure how the topping would taste with it - but it was great, definitely a keeper.

This salad was sooo good. I meant to take a picture but I was in a rush. I took it to potluck at the school and there was nothing left! My kids said other kids were taking 2-3 huge spoon fulls. I made it just like the recipe. Next time I’ll take a picture! This ones a keeper!

I had a 12 ounce can of raspberry cake and pastry filling which I used for this recipe.  I also used strawberry Jello.  The salad is very good.  I will make it again.
