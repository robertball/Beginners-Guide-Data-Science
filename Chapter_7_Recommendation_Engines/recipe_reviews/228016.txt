This was great! I used 3 tbsp. of butter instead of 2, but that was my only change. I did feel that the dressing ended up a bit salty for me, so I will reduce the salt next time, but other than that, this turned out delicious. LOVED the croutons! I made the dressing a little earlier, and allowed it to sit @ room temp to allow the flavors to blend. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made it exactly as written and I liked it but I didn't love it. Something in the flavor was off but I can't pinpoint it. Maybe too much dijon? I don't know. I also prefer a thicker caesar dressing. The croutons were nice.

I made the dressing and it tasted almost like the Caesar dressing  you get in a real Italian restaurant. My family enjoyed it. I did not have time to make the croutons so I just used store bought . I will make this again.

This recipe was the first recipe of this kind I've tried- Loved It! I had run out of my boyfriends favorite dressing, so I found this & made it- I made just the dressing because I was pressed for time. I put it over my boyfriend's favorite salad greens and it was his favorite part of the meal! I also served it at a recent party and got tons of compliments. I can't wait to try the full recipe with the home made croutons and the romaine lettuce. I am now making this every 3 or 4 days, the dressing has become a staple in our house. Thanks for submitting this!

This was good. I prefer ground mustard to Dijon which adds a taste of horseradish that is not consistent with Caesar salad, and I use real raw egg which was missing here. Reduce the salt as it is in the anchovy paste and Worcestershire.The egg must be fresh as any raw egg can be a health risk.  Use Olive Oil.This makes a better salad dressing  that is more consistent with what you would get in an upscale restaurant. Also nice with grilled romaine or by adding grilled chicken turkey, or meat. The anchovy paste is great instead of anchovies which can be very heavy on the salt. Enjoy!

Used Parmigiano Reggiano. Well worth the extra cost. Also used flat anchovy instead of paste. Everyone loved the salad and homemade croutons.Quick and easy to prepare. This recipe is a keeper.

I didn't have anchovy paste, so I doubled the Worcestershire. Was excellent! Will make over and over! Thanks for submitting!

I really like this recipe but I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp. As I found it too salty.

Terrific salad and dressing! I used olive oil instead of canola oil and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and it was wonderful. I have made it several times and guests love it. Thank you for the recipe.

I would definitely only use Olive Oil, not Canola, and if you want a bit of a zip, add a little Franks Hot Sauce

Pretty darn good recipe for the caesar dressing. Slightly too lemony for my taste. I also just used some croutons I already had, didn't make the ones with garlic and oil.
