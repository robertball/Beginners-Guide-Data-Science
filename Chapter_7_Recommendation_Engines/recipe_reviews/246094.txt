These need more flavor. Maybe some almond extract to pop the almond flour. Good start, but needs help

The pancakes turned out great. I read the reviews so I added Mexican vanilla, cinnamon and a little nutmeg and fried them in coconut oil. Absolutely the best almond flour pancakes I have made.

Delicious! Added a splash of vanilla extract, a 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon, a few grates of nutmeg, and 6 drops liquid stevia. Served with a mixed berry compote(syrup) for Easter breakfast. I will definitely make these again.
