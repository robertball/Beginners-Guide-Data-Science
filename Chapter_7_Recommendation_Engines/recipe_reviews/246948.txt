I modified the cooking technique but no changes to the ingredients. I cooked the onion and chicken thighs in a crockpot. This allows a more tender chicken thigh. Afterwards I proceeded with frying the corn tortillas and layering the casserole. I think this needs a pinch of cumin and chili powder, and less enchilada sauce. I found it doesn't need salt at all.

This was very good, I will make it again.  I do think you need to shred the chicken add about a teaspoon of cumin and  chili powder about 3/4 of that big can of enchilada sauce . Great recipe

This was so good! My fiance went back for thirds. I didn't change a thing, although next time I might use breasts and shred them instead of just cubing them.

This is simple and delicious.  The only thing I would change next time, is shred the chicken, instead of pieces and add black olives.

This is very good.  I did make some modifications though. I boiled and shredded the chicken, added some chopped black olives and some sour cream and only used Monterey Jack.

I wanted sort of a slow cooker version of this recipe. I took chicken breasts, chicken broth, green chiles, salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, chipotle chili powder, paprika, half an onion, and three garlic cloves in a slow cooker on low for several hours. I shredded the chicken and then followed the recipe except I rolled the enchiladas up instead and used two 8x8 containers.

Definitely make it again.
Used 2# boneless skinless chicken breast - cooked in pan then shredded rather than chicken thighs.  
Added 1 tsp cumin & 1 tsp chili powder to enchilada sauce as suggested.  
Used shredded Mexican Cheese Blend.  
Nuked corn tortillas 4 at a time between damp paper towels (enough to soften) rather than pan-fry.  
Wonderful dish!
