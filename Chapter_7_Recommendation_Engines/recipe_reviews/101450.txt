We could not find the exact marinade, but we used another Caribbean Jerk one.  The recipe was great, and the salsa was AWESOME -- it can be used for multipe dishes.

Didn't have pork, so I used chicken pieces.  I also added some sesame seeds and chopped green onion to the marinade.  The flavor of the sesame and green onion comes out nicely on the grill.  Whip up some Mojito's and you have a fun BBQ!

I served this to visiting family members who loved it so much they requested the recipe.  The salsa was great, but even better the next day.  This makes a heap of salsa, more than you need for the pork chops.  I recommend that you have other uses for the salsa in mind when you make it, otherwise you'll need to dispose of the remainder within a few days.

This is a great recipe!  Warning though; if you have non-spicy eaters in your family, you might want to substitute the Carribbean Jerk for Teriyaki marinade, and take out the jalapeno pepper from the salsa.

We like heat to enhance, but not overpower, the flavor of our food.  I used half a jalapeno, chopped very fine.  It was a hit!  We loved the combination of sweet and hot, supported by the cilantro and red onion.  My husband gave it a "5" and it will definitely be part of our permanent rotation.

My husband liked, I did not. The pineapple overpowered everything, but I did leave out the pepper. I tried to pinpoint his exact feeling by asking, "Are you looking forward to having it again?" His reply: "I don't know about that...." Sorry. Just not for me.

Like another reviewer, I made this recipe with chicken breasts instead of pork chops.  Not only was this reciped delicious, but it was so pretty.  I made it for dinner guests and every commented on how pretty and good the meal was.  It was so easy I was almost embarassed to give my friend the recipe!

The salsa for this was divine.  I would definitely marinate this much longer.  Even overnight.  Otherwise the meat itself did not have much flavor other than on the outside.  I gave it 4 stars because of the salsa.

We all loved this recipe.  I left out the bell pepper from the salsa because I don't care for it.  My husband was a little concerned about the spiciness at first, but he really liked it.  I got a "you can do this again" from everyone in the family.

Fantastic flavor.  Instead of pork chops I used boneless country style pork ribs and cut them up into more managable pieces.  Rather than grilling, I cooked them in a pressure cooker (after marinating) since they are a tougher cut of meat.  I also cooked the salsa with the meat after the inital 20 minutes in the pressure cooker so help the flavors mix.  I accidenally forgot the jalpeno, so mine wasn't very spicy.  I also added bit of brown sugar.

This dish was easy and fresh. The right amount of sweetness and spice. The pork chops were very moist, and I will not hesitate to make this again.
