These are fantastic! The only substitution I made was to use apricot rather than peach preserves due to what was available at the store. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and they were a big hit at my holiday party. If you are going to have them out for several hours in a crockpot as I did, I would suggest doubling the bbq sauce/preserve combo as it tended to be absorbed. Also, spray the crockpot with cooking spray for easier cleanup. Thanks for the great recipe!

These meatballs are just fantastic and such a nice change of pace from the traditional Italian flavor of most meatballs.  I've made these tree times so far, changing only the hot sauce.  The first time I made them with Franks Red Hot Chili and Lime, which was delicious.  The second I used simple Tabasco.  This most recent I used Cholula.  I think I'll stick with Cholula because it has just the right zip, and you can't beat the subtle tang.  I love this recipe and highly recommend it to anyone who's contemplating giving it a try.

delicious! The first time I did this recipie my meat eating friends couldn't believe how good they were. I also mixed the BBQ sauce and preserves in the meatballs and then baked them instead of using it as a sauce and it worked out really well. I actually prefer them that way.

These meatballs are awesome! I brought an entire crockpot full of them to a potluck and the entire batch was gone! Note: I used a little less peach preserves than called for to keep a spicy flavor

I made this recipe for a gathering of friends. I made a batch for 12 people. I tasted one meat ball before the gathering. I got in line to eat and all the meatballs were gone. This is a great recipe and quite a hit with my friends. Doug

These are delicious!  I used less milk and a little more bread crumbs.  I also doubled the sauce to keep them warm in the crock pot.

I made these for a pot luck - they were gone in no time!!  I kept hearing people talking about those "yummy" meatballs - and then got people asking me for the recipe.  Followed the recipe to the "tee" - so easy to make - I only discovered this recipe a week ago and have made them 3 times since as my family love them - works perfectly - tastes wonderful - thank you for sharing this.

I've made these meatballs for potlucks at work and for family gatherings. Everyone absolutely loves them! They can't believe that they are homemade. They give a wonderful twist to your traditional meatball. These are truly delish!

These were FANTASTIC.  I used all the ingredients but increased the lean ground beef by 1/2 pound and added 1/2 more of other ingredients except for the milk (which I left at 1/4 cup).  I baked half the meatballs and fried the other half in a non-stick skillet (very little oil since the beef had very little fat) and tossed them around until they were done (about 8-10 minutes - I preferred the fried meatballs as they were more firm) I also used 3/4 cup of "Sticky Fingers" Habanero Hot BBQ sauce and 1 cup of a store brand Peach Preserves (the sauce was flavored to my taste as I like a sweet and spicy combination).  I thought the meatball flavor was delicious.  I will most definitely make these again. (Yields 45 meatballs)

I followed the recipe closely, and used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce following suggestion of a reviewer, and used apricot preserves instead of peach preserves, and Frank's Hot sauce. I tasted them out of the oven and they were quite salty. But later were not as salty when they sat in the sauce. I used McCormick's Cajun spice and went back to re-read that salt was the first ingredient. I will try a different brand Cajun next time or use less. The meatballs were delicious as an appetizer meatball, but did not taste Cajun at all with the sweet sauce. I recommend using a BBQ sauce with more kick or mesquite flavor instead, and I will try with peach preserves which may be less sweet. Quantity: I made 6 pounds of ground beef, and got about 160-170 appetizer meatballs (avg 26-30 meatballs for 1lb.)

These just are so yummy. I did 1/2c head country mild BBQ and 1/2c head country spicy and 3/4c of peach jam. Sooooo good. A nice little spicy kick. A huge hit at the SB party :)

I had apricot preserves in the cupboard so I used that instead of the peach preserves.  Turned out great, I would make them again!

My whole family LOVED this recipe so I took it and so do my coworkers!  I added more cajun seasoning & used fresh parsely, but kept the rest the same. I've already been asked to bring it to the next gathering!

Very easy to make and were a HUGE hit. Many people either asked for the recipe or asked me to bring it to their next get together. Only substitution I made was apricot preserves instead of peach.

WhooWhee! Did these have some heat. And I like spicy. The sweet sauce did a good job of taming it some and making them palatable. I didn't care too much for the sauce though. The meatballs would have been better without the hot pepper sauce as that seemed the dominant flavor. And I like Tabasco. And spice. But these were just too spicy and I really didn't care much for them. They were very easy to fix though and used things I usually have available. Thanks, I enjoyed trying out a new dish.

My company really enjoyed .....but I wasn't blown away....they were good...but maybe the cajun seasoning was the issue for me.....I did like the spice and loved the sauce which I doubled...as well as the rest of the meatballs. I made these a few days in advance, cooked,  and froze them in a zip lock. Day of my party, put them in my crockpot and poured over the sauce and kept on low. Thanks!

Eh. These were allright. Not awful, but not worthy of a repeat either (IMHO). For one, I didn't care for the texture of these at all. I guess I prefer a firmer bite.... I did enjoy the sauce, however. My fiance also enjoyed the sauce (which surprises me because he isn't a fan of "sweet" sauces). NOTE: If you bake your meatballs on a rack set inside a baking dish (try using a roasting pan), your meatballs will not be greasy at all - try it! Also, if you have a large pot or Dutch oven, simply combine your sauce ingredients, whisk to incorporate, and when your meatballs are done, drop into the sauce and heat on low for 10 minutes or so. A slow cooker would also work well for this purpose. Just be sure to allow enough simmering time for your meatballs to absorb some of the yummy sauce! Served as a main course with a side of Zatran's cheesy dirty rice and roasted garlic cauliflower (SHELLERY), this was a decent meal. I am just not overwhelmingly impressed (sorry!). Thanks for sharing anyways, Doreen. :-)

A good, basic recipe... good flavors. I have used the recommended sauce combo (preserves, bbq) and a homemade sauce... both worked just fine. It's BBQ meatballs!

These meatballs have quickly become a family favorite!  We bring them to every function that we go to and everyone looks forward to them.  They're usually gone 20 minutes after they're put out.  It's also a quick and easy recipe.

Huge Hit!  Used Tony Chachere's for the 'cajun spice'.  Excellent, easy to make and the meatballs were lovely and moist without falling apart. They don't taste spicy at first, but there is a definite 'kick' afterwards.  These will be on every appetizer menu for holidays and lake weekends from now on!

so i dont eat red meat but made then for a party and they were completely the first to go in no time! i made them with 1/2 cayane pepper and 1/2 chili powder just because thats whati had on hand, froze the meatballs a week before the party, cooked them, added in peach peserves/diana's spicy bbq sauce with some brown sugar addded (found the bbq sauce very vinegar-y) then i let them sit on low for 5 hours in the sauce which really let the flavour sink. great app and a great change from the ususal! thanks for posting

Yummy! These were sooooo good! I made a few changes, though. Used ground chicken instead of beef, egg whites instead of the whole egg and apricot preserves instead of peach. I heated the bbq sauce and apricot preserves together, added the cooked meatballs and let them sit a couple of minutes. They were awesome served over brown rice. Next time I makes these, I will use less milk and maybe more bread crumbs as the meatballs were really moist and it was difficult to shape them into balls.

I wanted to make this lower in sugar and fat so I made a couple changes. I used the In-A-Pinch Ketchup from this site and made it with "zero" cola so I could add sweetness without adding excess sugar or calories. I added Liquid Smoke, worchestershire sauce, a TBSP. dijon mustard and a little Frank's Hot Sauce into the homemade ketchup, then stirred in SUGAR FREE apricot jam. I sauteed half an onion and a little garlic in a tbsp. of EVOO, then added the sauce ingredients and let it reduce. In the meatballs, I used a homemade cajun seasoning with only a portion of the salt, two egg whites and instead of the full amount of bread crumbs, I used half parmesan cheese. These baked up nicely and even though the sauce was homemade and mostly sugar-less, we all enjoyed it. I'd make this again for sure. I served this with Pecan Rice, which is also from this site. This made enough for a full meal and a container full for lunch for Husband tomorrow. NOTE: I did not use two tbsp. of cajun seasoning. I used half a batch (with only 1/4 tsp. salt) of the Cajun seasoning mix, which is also from this site.

I'm giving this one star because the meatballs were at least edible. Three people ate this. Two finished because they were hungry and this was what was to eat and the third person ate the meatballs but didn't like it at all.    The two things just didn't go together well at all - the flavor of the meatballs and the sauce that is.  I think using ground turkey it would have tasted better but this is in no way a keeper for my family.    I am going to stick with my meatball and sauce recipe and stop trying others I am tempted to try because they have all been BIG dissapointments.

Really good meatballs.  I left out the onion and did not have peach preserves so used raspberry instead.  Great flavor.

i would have given this five stars because everyone seemed to love it... except the hubby that is.  he liked the meatballs but didn't love the sauce (i think next time i will use just regular BBQ sauce to please him).

Made these as it is written changed the cooking process.  I browned  the meatballs in a skillet, then baked for a bit.  Meanwhile combining all sauce ingredients in a crock pot(cooked sauce for 2 hrs on low).  Took out the meatballs from oven,put them in the sauce and left them in the crockpot.  Everyone loved them!

These were pretty good! I thought because the mixture  was so moist that they wouldn't stick together, but they stayed together and cooked perfectly in the oven!  Made a huge batch for my bunco group.  They liked them although a couple of the girls said they were too spicy.  My son and husband had the leftovers and LOVED them!  I also used apricot instead of peach.  Definitely a keeper!

Oh, these are good.  They are not the best meatballs I've ever had, but very very yummy.  I had some cajun seasoning and my fiance really seemed to like it on the chicken, so I decided to search for something with beef and the seasoning.  I made a couple of changes because 1. my fiance is allergic to onions and 2. I didn't have any peach preserves.  I also didn't have any barbecue sauce, so I ended up making my own, chopping some pineapple slices in the blender, and adding them to the sauce.  The flavour is unlike any meatball I've ever had, and we ended up eating way too many.  They're pretty addictive!

I love this recipe.  I have never served it as an appetizer, but as a main dish over rice and over noodles.  Both ways were a hit.  I would suggest using a more vinegar-based BBQ sauce to cut the sweetness of the preserves.  Delish!

Great, just great...no amazing!  I followed the recipe, except I used ground turkey.  My husband, who hates meatballs, loved them!  I've actually got a batch in the oven right now.  They are great to freeze and pull out when guests are over.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these for a Mardi Gras get together and they were gone in no time! I thought I'd made too many but it turns out I didn't make enough! I made one batch with ground turkey (the other with beef, which I don't eat) and they were excellent. As a side note - if you use turkey you'll need to throw in some extra bread crumbs to help it form a better meatball. I followed the recipe exactly, though instead of putting the sauce on top I just tossed it in the crock pot. Delicious! For the seasoning I used the "Creole seasoning blend" from this site. It's an excellent seasoning and not at all salty, which seems to be the bulk of complaints about this recipe. It was so good I'm making more for dinner tonight. I think I'll toss them with some rice. Yum! Thanks for sharing.

Great appetizer for a Mardi Gras dinner party.  I made the meatballs the night before and was not too impressed but after I added the sauce the next day, I really enjoyed them.  I believe another reviewer suggested trying them over egg noodles for an entree dish which I will try next. want

These were FANTASTIC and I was quite skeptical going into this.  I prefer meatballs in a traditional red sauce, but wanted a meatball to use as an appetizer and the cajun drew me to this recipe.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and was thrilled with the results. Guests at the party I took them to wolfed them down in no time and even took to dipping random other foods in the leftover sauce.  These will be an appetizer staple at the LTH house (esp since they can be made ahead of time and kept in a crock pot!)!

I had an event a couple of days ago I was catering for with attendance of over one hundred people... made 15 pounds of ground round into meatballs and not one was available for me to eat!  Everyone told me they were the best meatballs they had put into their mouths EVER!!!  So, today I went back to my butcher and got three pounds of ground round again to make me my own batch!  According to over 100 people I served, I am the best meatball maker on the planet!  Love it!  ...and it is all due to this recipe!

The 1st time I made these I cut the Cajun seasoning ( Tony Chachere's) and hot sauce in half since there would be young children eating them. Everyone loved and raved about them. The 2nd time I added the amounts called for in the recipe and they were much too salty. I'll find the lower salt version for next time or just use less. This is a very good recipe though and is a definite keeper.

These weren't nearly as spicy as other reviews led me to believe. They had a little kick, but nothing to write home about.  The sauce was a bit bar-b-quey for me...that could've used some spicing up.  Won't make again, unfortunately.

meatballs had an awesome flavor- the whole family loved them! I doubled the recipe and would suggest to others when doubling to lessen the cajun seasoning to 3 to 3.5 tablespoons instead of 4, as it was just a little bit salty for my taste. Excellent!!

After reading some of the previous reviews about them being too salty, I used Mrs Dash Southwest Chipotle Seasoning Blend which has no salt and they turned out great.  To make them a little more fancy looking for the party I made them into little kebabs with a meatball, homemade crouton and cube of montery jack cheese on each.  Everyone loved them!

Awesome!!!!  I served this over rice.  Although I didn't add the hot pepper sauce, it was still a little spicy for the kids.  Also, I didn't have any peach preserves, so I used raspberry preserves.  Very Delicious!!!

a little too hot for small children, so if you plan to serve smaller ones this appetizer, you might want to scale back on the hot pepper sauce or cajun spice.  Other than that, a good recipe!

Very good, different flavor. A little too salty, and a bit too much hot sauce for my taste.
otherwise a good recipe.

Maybe it was the Cajun seasoning I used, but these were way too salty. Will try again using less of that seasoning.

Took these to a Christmas party, everyone loved them!  I did too!  I didn't make any changes, other than doubling the recipe, heated the bbq sauce and preserves and put it all in a crockpot to keep them warm.  I did take another reviewers advice on the sauce and crockpot, she said do add a little more sauce if putting in the crockpot to keep warm so they didn't dry out.  I also made the meatballs up the night before and put them in the fridge then took them out and cooked them right before going to the party.  I will be making these again!!!

Absolutely the best meatballs.  I get asked to make these for every function, whether it's a pitch in or not.  I like mine really spicy so I add more hot sauce, cayenne pepper, habanero powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes.  For the sauce I use apricot preserves as I prefer them over peach.  You can also use half Italian sausage and half hamburger.  These meatballs are great for sandwiches and pasta too, although with just regular marinara sauce.  And don't over roll the meatballs; they stay more moist if they aren't too compacted.

Great recipe DOREENB.  I made a triple batch of these for a recent party and they went in no time. I just drizzled the sauce over them at the end and added toothpicks so they could eat them as finger food.  I just kept more sauce on the side for dipping. I had several requests for the "brand" and they loved it when I showed them the quick and easy recipe..

This is a very good recipe. I used Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning and it was a little to salty with the amount called for in the recipe,next time I make these I will use less. I also used Japanese bread crumbs and they are excellent.

These meatballs were absolutely way too salty. I am from South Louisiana and I hated them. I was planning on making these for a family Christmas party and was trying to show off my cooking skills...well...that didn't happen. My husband and I couldn't even eat them so their was no way I was serving them to my family. I actually ended up going to the store and buying frozen meatballs. I did enjoy the sauce which is why I even gave it 2 stars. I used barbeque sauce from this really great bbq joint and apricot preserves because I couldn't find peach.

The sauce for this recipe was VERY good, but the meatballs were bland and kind of icky (very little flavor without the sauce).  I was really disappointed, given the high ratings.  I will stick to my own meatball recipe and just use the sauce if we feel like something other than red sauce.

The flavor is just outstanding.  It's a very different meatball with a nice little kick.  One of the other reviewers said to mix in the BBQ sauce with the meatballs. This made them overly wet and they didn't want to stay in meatball form.  Next time I will keep the sauce separate and put on top of the meatballs after they cook.

I've made this three times already and everyone loves them! I was hesitant about the peach preserves but they go perfectly with the BBQ sauce! Adjust it to your taste, though. I had to keep doing taste tests until it felt right to me.

I made this for office Christmas party and I went home with an empty pot.  There were a lot of food left over but mine was gone in the first round.  People were going up for second only there were none left and I made 2 lbs for 10 people at a pot luck. I only used 1 tbls. of cajun seasoning for each batch since it's too salty.  I also used Masquite BBQ sauce.  I cooked the meatballs the night before and kept the sauce mix separate. The next day I mixed the sauce in and kept it warm in a crockpot few hours before the party.

This is a recipe the whole family enjoyed.  I used apricot preserves instead of peach and I didn't have any Worchestire sauce on hand so I used steak sauce.  YUMMY!  Served meatballs over white buttered rice, and was so good.  

My 2 year old tasted the sweetntangy sauce and asked where the chicken was to dip in it.  The sauce tastes better than the sweet n sour sauce from our chinese restaurant!  :)  Will make again for sure but will definitely add the hot sauce to it, there was no kick to it at all without it.

A hit with my teenagers, although I didn't put much of the pepper sauce because I don't want it too spicy.  The leftovers are still good, just heat it up in the microwave or oven.

While a touch salty for my taste, these held up well for my daughter's first birthday party.  They are pretty simple to make.  Having a non-fried meatball is nice.  I used extra lean ground beef, but may try using ground turkey next time.  I may also look for a NSA cajun seasoning too to address the salt issue.  Oh and for hot sauce, I used Jalapeno Tabasco.  Not sure what was the indended brand, but I thought the creamier milder taste might be good.

This meatballs were okay. They didn't hold their shape well when combined with sauce.  May try them again with a little more binder.

I am assuming that the "Cajun seasoning" called for in this recipe is something like Tony Chachere.s? I used this, plus I doubled the meatball recipe. I WAY too salty but it doesnt look like anyone else did. Did I use the wrong seasoning?

I would give Cajun Meatballs a 10 if I could, so easy and soooo good. The only thing that I have changed is the sauce, I did not care for the BBQ sauce, I found a receipe from Cheryl Crowson (Appetizer Meatballs), doubled the receipe for 25 meatballs and everyone really enjoyed them!

Definitely a good appetizer to have at any type of party or get-together but the cajun seasoning needs to be HALVED; it is way too salty.  With about half of the salt, it would be perfect. I am going to make it again but I will decrease the amount of cajun seasoning (I uses Tony's).

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe, but made a few modifications.  I added one half of minced hot pepper for just the right amount of kick.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, which required more filler than the recipe called for.  For the filler I used additional bread crumbs and oatmeal.  I added ketchup in addition to the bbq sauce.

This was absolutely my favorite holiday appetizer!  Everyone ate them.  They were the first thing gone from the table, and the first thing I ran out of.   I was so curious about the flavor of the peach preserves and bbq sauce, and I'm glad I was! Really love these.  I'll be making these often.  When I made the next batch just for our family, I found they reheat very very well in a saucepan.   Just love them, thank you!

I don't even like meatballs but these are amazing! And they come out nice and crispy in the oven too.  It's a great balance of sweet and spicy.  Every time I make them for anyone they are gone so quick! And then people always want the recipe. Thank you!

Awesome base recipe, so I will give it five stars.   I get asked for the recipe by every third person (or so) that eat my version.  If you want to spice it up some, then make a few changes.  Add a couple of cayennes or jalapenos for every pound of meat, as well as a tablespoon of ground cayenne.  We like to add the sauce to the top of the meatballs and cook for five or six minutes longer.  If you do this don't to drain the fat off first, then the sauce will be too runny.

Excellent meatballs! I made these for a potluck and they were a hit! (They were one of the only dishes that was completely eaten up at the end.) I used Famous Dave's sweet and zesty BBQ sauce in the mixture instead of a regular, which added a nice sweetness to them. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this and me and my girl stood there and stuffed ourselves. I used grape jam with the BBQ sauce. I doubled the batch and will be making it with egg noodles tomorrow. We expect this appetizer to be even better after sitting overnight.

These are FANTASTIC.  I made them with turkey in the oven and then kept them in the slow cooker for my holiday party.  Everyone raved.  I had to stop the early guests from eating all of them before the other guests arrived.  Great.  Will make these on a regular basis.

I was running a small kitchen in China the last half a year. I used this recipe. Really good! You're right, the meatballs hold just fine in the freezer making them a real easy one for doing individual orders. I did what others mentioned and cooked mine in the oven with the sauce. I made extra sauce when making mine. I liked to lay down a layer of sauce on the plate and place the balls on top. Very nice and easy dish.

I served these over egg noodles.  My whole family loved it.

Changes included using water instead of milk and using oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  Also, I used a variety of peach preserves that had no sugar or artificial sweeteners.  A quick note on Cajun spice -- some varieties have salt and some do not.  You will need to keep this in mind and make adjustments as needed.

These meatballs were AWESOME!!!! They had the best flavour and everyone raved about them. They were not too spicy at all. I couldn't find peach preserves so I used apricot jam, I baked the meatballs on a cookie rack on a cookie sheet. They were sooooo good. thanks

I used apricot instead of peach preserves. Didnt find this at all too salty nor too spicy. Being from Louisiana, I used Tony Chachere's of course. 
This receipe is a keeper.

Had a party with way too much food - this was the only thing that was completely gone at the end of the night. Fantastic!!! Made three times the recipe and wound up with 90 appetizer size servings. Next time will probably add even a little more of the cajun spice and cholula sauce. (As much as I liked this as an appetizer, it seems to me that it would be awfully sweet as a main course.)

Made these for the Super Bowl and everyone loved them. I didn't want to spend the money for Cajun seasoning so I used a recipe from this site to make my own. I already had all the spices and the taste is just how we like it, because I was able to vary the salt and cayenne to suit my family's tastes.  I have the extra stored in a small jar ready to make another batch of these great meatballs! Thanks for a keeper!

I cheated and used frozen meatballs with this sauce.  We enjoyed it a lot and will try the meatballs next time.

Excellent! I went a little easy on the Cajun spice...used about 3 T and that was plenty. Used apricot preserves instead. Took it to a New Year's Eve party...big hit!

I made this recipe for our work Mardi Gras cookoff and won first prize!  I followed the recipe for the meatballs exactly but doubled it making about 35 golf ball sized meatballs.  For the sauce I doubled it as well plus added another 1/4 c each (peach perserves and Baby Ray BBQ) because I put them in a crockpot and didn't think there would be enough. They smelled and tasted amazing. Even my 11 year old daughter loved them and said they had a sweet, tangy and then spicy flavor.  I'll be making them again since they are totally gone and none to take home.

This was a new recipe for my entire picky family.  They LOVED it!!  Definitely delicious and a huge hit!  Next time I will try a little more peach though...could have been a little sweeter for my liking.  Otherwise absolutely wonderful and extremely easy to make!

We made these today and they were delicious!  We ate them over white rice.  Cajuns eat alot of rice! I doubled the sauce amount for that reason.  I used Tony Chachere's for a great kick. I found the 2 Tblspns made it slightly salty.  Next time I will use 1T of regular and 1T of salt-free Chachere's seasoning. We made them smaller size and got 58 out of this recipe! Will do again!! Great recipe!

First time ever making meatballs so I figured I'd try some less traditional meatballs like the ones in this recipe. All I can say is WOW. I made just a few changes, like 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder instead of onion because I hate onions and A1 instead of worcestershire but it still turned out great. Highly recommend this recipe!

Wow, what great flavors! I was a little timid in using 1/4 cup of cajun seasonings, so I used 4 Tbsp. instead. Still had enough "kick" to it with the Chipotle BBQ sauce I used, and got rave reviews! Will make this again for my next get-together!

The meatballs are very tasty, but the sauce was too rich and overpowered them.  I will definately make the meatballs again, but will either barely coat them in the sauce or go without.

Very good! I did want a little sweeter sauce, so I added a couple more tablespoons of peach preserves to the sauce. Had them as a main course, but will try them next time in the slow cooker as an appetizer... I am hoping they will be more moist. They were a little dry out of the oven, but after being in the sauce for a couple minutes, they were OK. Also, I used 93/7 ground beef.. that could have also been why they were a bit dry.

I was a little disappointed in the weak flavor of the meatballs. I found the sauce to be too sweet and somewhat overpowering. I didn't really like it, however, I'll give you points because my audience thought it was really tasty. I think it may be my taste in food though that brought my rating down. You can't win 'em all can you?

This is the best Meatball recipe around!
Made them for a Christmas party and all 100 were gone in 2 hours. I even had a man ask me to marry him when he found out I made them. My husband said no. This recipe is a must. Thank You!!!

These were great I made them for a SuperBowl party and they were the big hit of the night. I made the meatballs the same way although I made a triple batch. I wanted to serve and keep them hot all night so I made the sauce and then put everything in the crockpot to stay warm. I also added 2 cans of sliced peaches since I used the peach jelly, they were a nice addition to the meatballs.

I used Tony's Creole Seasoning and the meatballs were so salty I couldn't eat them. I gave them three stars anyway because if I had used a different seasoning that didn't have any salt, they might have been alright. The spicyness was good.

I used raspberry vs peach preserves, it was what I had on hand. I’m not a meatball fan to begin with, but it was easy and good as far as meatballs go. It stands out from other meatballs because of the extra little kick you get from the hot pepper sauce and Cajun seasoning.

Never would have thought of using peaches and barbq sauce as the glaze.  Very nice.  Oddly enough I had both on hand.  I doubled the recipe and made some very large meatballs which were well received.  I really didn't change anything.  Follow the directions and enjoy !!!

Excellent. I was a little worried about the sauce, but it was a HUGE hit at a potluck dinner I went to. After the meatballs were gone, everyone was taking the sauce to dip their other meats into. Had several requests for the recipe. Big winner!

I have made this several times with apricot (all I could find at the store) and it has been a hit each time! I usually put a little extra hot sauce and keep them in the crockpot. Great meatballs for any occasion!

This was WONDERFUL! I made it for my brother's super bowl party, and it was a hit! Luckily there was some left over so my hubby and I can have it over some steamed basmati rice. MMmmmm!!!

Made this and took it to work. The sweet sauce made the spicy meatballs edible for most of my office mates. In fact, another of the guys and I ended up eating the better part of half pot... Everyone loved the taste! The only complaint was that, for one or two people, they were a wee bit warm. Edible, but warm.

These were good but so very spicy.  If following the recipe exactly, this is too hot to eat for most people.  If I make these again, I will only use 1/2 amt of Cajun seasoning and maybe 1/2 Italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef for more flavor.  I think also I will make tiny bite sized meatballs for convenience.

I made a double recipe of these delicious little meatballs for the first time when I went to a party over the weekend and everyone else loved them just as much as me!

I followed the recipes exactly and didn't make any changes to the recipe at all.

I love this recipe. My fiance' thought it was a little different because of the sweetness but he still loved it! I used the lb of ground beef, but found I needed to make a little more sauce to go over the meatballs. great recipe :)

Had a great flavor but I think 2 tbsp of Cajun seasoning was way too much! It was sooooo salty!! Unless maybe I shouldn't have used Tony Chacherie but that's all we know here when u say Cajun seasoning.  Will definitely make again but WIll cut down on Tony's

My boyfriend made fun of me for making meatballs at a party for college students, but when he had to fight off the others for a chance to taste them, he stopped laughing.  Good stuff!  I used store bought bread crumbs and Montreal steak seasoning instead of Cajun.  They're spicy, they say!

These were pretty quick to make. I browned the meatballs in a skillet instead of baking them, and cooked them for a few more hours right in the BBQ sauce mixture in my slow cooker to absorb some more of that flavour! Well that flavour ended up being a little too empowering, but the meatballs were yummy! My husband loved this recipe, for some reason, so that is why I'm giving it a 3-star rating!

I have made these meatballs more than a dozen time and all to rave reviews. The first time, I made them as appetizers and people loved the spicy/sweet mixture. But the second time, my success was by accident. I was serving a mashed potato bar for a party I was catering for more than 60 people. Because of tight serving quarters, I served these between the two chafing dishes of mashed potatoes, one buttermilk, one Christmas garlic and sage, and people topped their martini glasses full of mashed potatoes with meatballs. While not my intention in any way, I had more than a dozen people beg me to reveal the recipe. Who knew?

These were awesome!  I did make some changes, although I'm sure they are just as good the way the recipe is written.  I used apricot preserves b/c I had them on hand, added some andouille sausage b/c had extra from another recipe, decreased the cajun seasoning & hot sauce due to the addition of the hot sausage & WOW, loved them!

A great recipe for a party! My sauce turned out a bit more on the BBQ side, but that's because I worried about them drying out in my crock pot and overcompensated by putting in a bit too much BBQ sauce. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and really put in a larger amount of cajun seasoning in the meatball mixture to make sure you could taste the difference between them and regular meatballs. I also used ground Turkey instead of beef since I had a guest that didn't eat beef dining with me. But they were good enough that she had to ask me three times if they were really made from Turkey! Will make when I have a larger party again!

This recipe might well deserve the 5-star average however I followed it to a tee.  The problem, I believe, is that it calls for two tablespoons of "Cajun Seasoning" without specifying a brand.  I used the one from Louisiana Fish Fry products.  Perhaps I should have followed my instincts and used one teaspoon, but I'm not going to waste the food to find out.

Took these to a party last night and everyone really liked them.  Doubled the recipe, but did not change any ingredients or portions.  Just the right zip!  After baking the meatballs in the oven, I put them in a crockpot and poured the sauce over them.  They held together fine.  We ate them like regular appetizer meatballs, sans noodles.

These were quick to prepare but I thought they were just OK. Spicy and I couldn't get past the flavor of "dried spices." Made the sauce with apricot preserves instead of peach and that worked fine. The kids said these were too spicy. Probably wont't make again though they were very easy to prepare.

I used this recipe as an inspiration, but I changed quite a bit of things for this recipe  - I made the sauce with ketchup, coke, peach jam, some brown sugar, lemon, and some frank's hot sauce. These turned out great. After cooking them in the slow cooker for awhile, I fried them up in a skillet just before serviing to get that slight crunchy texture on the outside. Everyone loved them at my NYE party. Oh, I also doubled the recipe with 2 pounds of ground beef and rolled the meatballs slightly smaller than nomral meatballs, and it made about 55 meatballs.

Made it for Superbowl. I followed the recipe,  the only difference is that I did not have bread crumbs so I used Oatmeal. I used a no sugar bbq sauce and all fruit jam with no added sugar. Just trying to be a little more healthy.  I would make it again

I doubled the sauce as another review suggested. Came out very well and there were no leftovers. I decided to bring it to the party I was going to in a crockpot. Second time around I would either plate them or bring something else.

Made as directed and was a hit with the adults especially the addition of peach preserves. Children found it a little on the spicy side but liking the flavor. Most wanted me to make more for the dinner as well.

I followed the directions exactly as written.  I found it too spicy (and I’m Cajun!)    I will make again and reduce the spice.

It was good. However, I could have had a very similar taste and less prep time with precooked meatballs and a crockpot.

Next time I will only use 1 tablespoon of Cajun Seasoning, just a tad strong for me, but overall Excellent! 


SAUCE:
 I got my sauce from this site, but don't remember the name, but it goes like this:  2 Cups of Ketchup, 1/2 Cup of Water, 1/2 Cup of Vinegar, 1/2 Cup of Honey, 2 Tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce, 1 Tablespoon of Dried Minced Onion, /1/2 teaspoon of Black Pepper and a Dash of Cayenne Pepper Optional    Combined ketchup, water, vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, dried minced onion, black pepper  and cayenne pepper in a sauce pan and heat to boiling, then add meatballs!  This is a spicy recipe!  But sooooo good!

I used pre-packaged meatballs, which I actually don't like, but I had bought them for something else, so I decided to use them.   I combined all Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, parsley, onion, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and apricot preserves in a bowl and poured over my meatballs.   I put in the slow cooker for a few hours.   The sauce was too salty on it's own, but on top of the meatballs it was fantastic.   I will make again.

I am going to assume Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning is not the right creole seasoning to use for this recipe.  So much salt no one could eat them.  And I doubled it!  What a waste so please find another seasoning!oo

These are delicious and versatile. I had some spicy pepper jelly I wanted to use up, so I subbed that for the peach preserves. I also omitted the hot pepper sauce in the meatballs since the jelly is quite spicy. I will definitely make again.

Really good appetiser, at the end we reheated what was left and served it to a couple of people as part of the main dish.  I used more of the Cajun seasoning to give them that extra kick.

I've made these meatballs several times and they are always a hit.  I use turkey instead of beef and I've never used fresh bread crumbs.  Monitor the amount of Cajun spice you use, if not it maybe salty. Enjoy!

Made these for a Super Bowl party, but made them much smaller; one bite for convenience.   Making them smaller, the recipe goes a long way.  They were a big hit.

Very tasty - I thought the 2 TBSP of Cajun seasoning was a bit much so I will cut back to 1 TBSP next time I make these.  I used turkey and only had to bake them for about 20 minutes, rather than 30-40.

First off, I used venison ground with pork.  This was SUPER DELISH! I used Badia Cajun seasoning, crystal hot sauce, Sweet Baby Rays bbq,  and apricot instead of peach. It helps me when people list brands or more detail to the ingredients they use. Bottom line, the type of ground meat you use will have little bearing on the outcome. It's just a favor-filled recipe.

Very good.  I think it comes down to the bbq sauce you use.  I used a whiskey sauce with the preserves and thought it was ok , but wouldn't use again.  They would probably be better with Bulls eye or Sweet Baby Rays.  Also, the preserves make it very sweet, very fast so I recommend starting  with less and add to taste.  I will for sure make again.

I used only 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, it had just a small kick, and the majority of the party seemed to enjoy them. I liked them quite a bit! I used apricot preserves instead, and it was JUST fine :-)

Used ground turkey instead of beef, and halved the cajun seasoning, since all I had was creole seasoning (and the first ingredient was salt...and some reviews said this recipe was too salty).  Cooked for about 30-35 minutes and it was tasty.

Yum!!!!  I made this recipe for a recipe club and it was a HUGE hit!  I adjusted the recipe for 12 servings so I could have some for the gathering and also home. I followed the recipe exactly, but left some plain ones for my picky eaters, lol!  It was easy, inexpensive and yummy....PERFECT!  Thank you!

My husband and I had this for dinner and thought it was very good!  I used Creole seasoning, which may have made it a little more salty than I would have liked, but it still came out well.  I served it over buttered rice, as recommended by another reviewer.  I will definitely make it again!

These were excellent meatballs!!  Just spicy enough for my taste.  I will try different BBQ sauces each time for just a little bit of variety.

These meetballs were very good!  I love spicy things so I used habanero tabasco sauce and Stubbs Spicy BBQ sauce.  I also took one reviewer's advice and put the cooked meatballs in a crockpot with the sauce for a while.  My guests all loved them and they were gone in a few minutes.  In the future I will try a different BBQ sauces to see what happens, and I would love to hear what other people used.  Thanks for the great recipe, Doreen.

MMMMMM!  I served these over egg noodles as a main dish and they were excellent!  I mixed the barbeque sauce and the peach preserves together and then poured over the meatballs and allowed them to bake for an additional 10 minutes or so.  It made such a yummy sauce!  You could easily adjust how spicy these are by adding more or less cajun seasoning to them.  I added what the recipe called for and they were perfect for us...nice and spicy!

Excellent the kids loved them.  I did cut back on the cajun seasoning and the hot sauce just a tad so they would not be too spicy.

The best meatball recipe I have ever found. The flavor was so different than the average meatball recipe. And the sauce was incredible and so easy.

Great recipe who like it spicy, and a BBQ fan.  I found that adding cayenne pepper makes it a painful hot, but a good pain!
