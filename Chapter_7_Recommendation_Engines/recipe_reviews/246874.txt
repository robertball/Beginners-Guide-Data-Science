Left out onion and added a ripe banana.  Took a bit longer to finish baking.  Very tasty - made a great breakfast.

So simple and delicious! Tasty savory muffin. I was afraid I added too much kale since I wasn't sure how to measure it, and although I think I used much more than the recipe called for, it still came out delicious.

I had to adjust this due to time constraints & less ingredients than called for but my family liked it. I used fresh spinach cooked down for the kale since I used up the kale in a kale& potato casserole. Everyone liked these so I look forward to making them exactly as the recipe says next time.
