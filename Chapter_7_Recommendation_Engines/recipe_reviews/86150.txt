MISSBETHANY....you are my new best friend! Oh my, was this pie GOOOOOD!
The only changes that I made was that I thawed my blueberries in a saucepan and added two extra tablespoons of flour, since the reviewers were saying it was a little runny. I made the crust using the Butter Flake Pie Crust recipe on this site....(which I highly recommend).This pie was picture perfect! The next time I make it, we will refrain from woofing it down until my shutterbug daughter takes a photo to submit! Thank you so much! Yummm-OOOO!

I just baked this recipe, and it's excellent. I made a few minor changes: no lemon juice or zest (I didn't have either). I added 1 tbs. of water instead. I added 2 tbs. of cornstarch to the mixture of dry ingredients for the filling. I think the consistency will be fine, once it cools. Since I had no lemon juice, I added a pinch of salt to the filling. 
Next time I'll probably try adding a little lemon juice , if I have some. 

I used 2 pints of fresh berries, which amounted to about 4 and 1/2 cups. This filled a deep pie plate. This is definitely a keeper.   Not only is it excellent, it's easy!

Excellent recipe. If using frozen berries, thaw first and then drain off some juice. Add 2-3 T. cornstarch to flour/sugar mixture.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and based on the other reviews, I let the blueberries thaw and I added 1T of cornstarch. It was still runny and "tart" is what my fiance claims. I refrigerated the leftovers after thanksgiving, and he said it was much better that way. SO my suggestion is the best way to handle this pie is refrigerate it to firm it up some.

A wonderful recipe.  Gave a bbq for 15 and this, along with a blackberry pie also from this site, were the deserts.  Both drew raves and requests for recipes.  We have blueberry farms down the road so I used fresh berries. I deleted the pie base and just topped fruit with the crumble.  The desert was rich and had a wonderful taste.  Thank you for sharing

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I've made this pie twice in the last week, and the fam devours it.  I used fresh blueberries and added about 1 tbsp cornstarch as others have recommended.  It is a little loose, but the flavor is so amazing who really cares??  I also didn't have any lemon so I omitted it, but the flavor is so fresh and bright with fresh blueberries that I don't think it really needed it anyway.  My new favorite pie!

This was a great start!  I added cornstarch (but 3T was a bit too much) and my pie was VERY set, even using frozen (thawed) berries.  I can't wait for blueberries to come  back in season!

This pie could be really good, but unfortunately I followed the recipe's instructions EXACTLY and ended up with a very strange pie.  It says to mix the lemon zest and juice into the flour and sugar, but the moisture from the juice makes that mixture really clumpy.  And then you add the blueberries, but the mixture does not get fully distributed among all the berries because there are just clumpy bits of flour and sugar.  I thought it might melt and distribute in the oven, but it didn't...  As he was eating it, my fiance asked if there was "lemon pudding or something in here"... which was the lemony clumpy parts.  This pie definitely has potential, but I strongly advise not adding the ingredients in the listed order.   I'll try a different recipe.

My 3 kids and I (my oldest just turned 4) love this recipe. My 3 year old daughter has Celiac Disease and this recipe is easy to tweek all of the flour out of. We either use a gluten-free frozen crust, a jiffy gluten-free crust mix, or omit the crust altogether and bake in a greased casserole dish (everyone seems to love this best). Instead of flour for the crumb topping we use corn meal or rice flour. The corn meal gives it a grainy texture and the rice flour gives it a much smoother texture.

We always use frozen blueberries for this recipe. The filling will be MUCH TOO RUNNY without adding a thickener. We have made this recipe at least 15 times and I have found that letting the berries thaw and adding 1 tablespoon of instant tapioca works the best. The filling jells a bit and holds up to the large amount of crumble topping much better than adding a flour or corn starch to it.

Overall we love this recipe and its something quick, easy, cheap, and my kids can lend a hand, too.

I have been searching for a great blueberry pie recipe and have made many pies during that search (including a Cook's illustrated recipe for which I made my own pastry dough and ground tapioca pearls, etc.  It was just meh.) This pie, made with a Pillsbury crust (!) was miles better.  I did add 2 Tbs of cornstarch which did make it set up too much, I will try 1 tbs next time.  There WILL be a next time.  My husband rushed home from a meeting the night after I served this pie because he was dying for another piece.  I would definitely serve this to company.  It was quick to make too with the premade crust and frozen berries.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

This was a great blueberry pie! I made it exactly as recipe stated, except for adding 2T of cornstarch per other reviewers(which, of course, does not affect the flavor). I'm glad I did because the pie turned out to have just the right amount of juiciness. I used a 9" pie pan and it was very full, but not so full that I thought a 10" pie pan would be necessary. You could probably use a 10" with no problem though. 
My husband loved this pie. I served it with Cool Whip and it was terrific!

I only put half a cup of sugar and that was plenty sweet, especially with the crumb topping. I also followed the recommendation of adding 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it. Quite yummy!

We love this pie! We had some fresh picked wild blackberries and didn't know what to do with them. After a little research, we found this recipe and adapted it to our liking. We used the blackberries, some blueberries, a few strawberries and some cut-up apples. Nothing was frozen. We used 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the filling because the blackberries were super sweet and followed the rest of the recipe. Our pie crust was a frozen type. So we baked that for 10-15 minutes before adding the filling. For the topping, in addition to the rest of the ingredients, we added a dash of nutmeg and used butter that slightly chilled (easier to crumble). Oh did I mention that we used wheat flour for the crust, filling and topping. The nice thing about this pie is that it's so versatile. The first pie had more blueberries. The next one had more blackberries. Yummo! Thank you for sharing!

From my experience blueberry pies can often turn out runny.  This one was no exception.  To try and avoid a runny pie I added 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch to my 4 cups of blueberries and we waited to cut into it for 2 hours.  Unfortunately mine was still a bit runny - maybe my blueberries were just extra juicy!    Next time I will use more cornstarch and increase the cooling time just to be sure.  The taste was definately good and we liked the crumb topping.  To avoid any strong lemon chunks I mixed the flour mixture with a pastry cutter before adding in the blueberries and it worked really well.

I have been searching for just this recipe for years until it came to me again just 2 weeks ago and lo and behold, you can always rely on Allrecipes!

I didn't need to change a thing although I will bake my pie crust for 10 minutes before, covering the rim with tinfoil the next time I make it as I found the crust was soggy from the blueberry juice (I used frozen berries).

Magnifique!

This is a great pie.  Because I was taking it to a friend some distance away, I made it in a deep square pan. I let the crust fold a little bit over the crumb topping.   added oatmeal and chopped nuts to the topping. It looks so pretty...Good enough to eat! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!  I love Allrecipes!

I have my own crust recipe, and my own crumble topping recipe so I just used the filling recipe and I LOVE IT!  I've made this pie several times now, and everyone raves over it!  I love the little pop of citrus which compliments the blueberries perfectly.  It thickended perfectly and was not runny at all.

this pie is delicious! i made it as it is written... it was ok.  I do, however, believe that the crumb topping is too much.  I would just cut down on portions for the topping.  I personally enjoy more filling and less topping.  The flavor is great and is just like my mom makes!  Next time i'm adding more blueberries and less crumb mixture, that's the only change i would make!

Truly a perfect blueberry pie. If yours tend to turn out runny, try tapioca instead of flour in the filling.

I made this last thanksgiving and my family now requests it at every holiday function. It is easy and fabulous. The first time I didn't have any lemon so I skipped it and it was still great. We all do like it even better with the lemon in it however. It adds a little zip to it. Classic and easy, also great for those like me who don't really like pie crust!!

Very good.  Used 6 c. frozen/thawed blueberries and added 2 Tbs. corn startch.  Only used 1/2 of the topping, otherwise it is too hard to cut a slice without the entire top caving in.  You'll know what I am talking about when you go to slice a piece.  Oh, and don't forget the ice cream.

I, too, used only 4 cups of blueberries instead of 6 (I thought the filling would be overflowing) and omitted the lemon juice entirely, using only the zest.  I added 3 T. cornstarch to thicken.  Lovely pie with great flavor.

This is great.  This was my first time making a pie and my four year-old and I made it; it was a simple recipe to follow and the results were great.  The only thing I would change next time is the amount of sugar used.  The pie came out great, but I think it would still have been a hit with a little less sugar.

Very disappointing...The strusel topping way overpowered the blueberry flavor. No one liked this pie & we are blueberry lovers! Next time, I will make the classic 2 crust pie so the luscious fruit flavor gets center stage.

Even for a sweet tooth, this recipe calls for way too much sugar.  It was good, but the natural flavor of the fruit is overwhelmed by the sugar content.  Also I could only get 3 cups of berries to fit in the pie and had more crumble mixture than I could cram into the pieshell.

It was very good, however very watery on the bottom.  I haven't read other reviews to see if anyone suggests remedies.  Does using fresh or frozen make a difference with that?

I made the pie exactly as written, but next time I'm going to leave out the lemon juice as it was abit too much for me.  Also, less sugar in the blueberries as it was too sweet.  The crumble topping was very good!

Good pie!  Need to reduce the sugar to maybe a 1/4 cup.  You don't need more than that.  Also added some cinnamon and 2 T of cornstarch. The pie set up nicely in the fridge but prior to that it was very runny.  My husband loved this!

I LOVED IT. I did have to make some changes. For one, we didn't have enough blueberries. So I made it with blueberries, peaches and apples (Fruit Crumb Pie?). I also ommitted the lemon zest because we didn't have that either. It was a bit juicier than we would have liked, made the crust soggy. So the second time I made it, I drained the frozen fruit better and added a touch more cornstarch. PERFECT. I've already made it 4 times and I just added this recipe 2 weeks ago. I'm going to make my family fat on it! YUM.

I made this recipe with my 9 year old son.  It was very easy and turned out well.  Some of the lemon zest clumped together, causing quite a strong lemon taste in certain bites.  Suggestion: Mix really well before adding blueberries.

This turned out delicious. When I brought it to the picnic, they wanted to cut it and eat it before the burgers and dogs! I switched out the sugar in the pie for splenda but kept the topping the same. You may need to adjust sweetening to the blueberries. Mine were early in the season and a bit tart, though the hubby prefers it that way. Easily doubled too! Thank you!

I was really looking forward to making this pie and, well, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't what I had hoped.  To start with, you should not make this recipe without adding at least 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, as other reviews have stated.  Why?  Well because without this cornstarch you will have a watery, soggy mess of a filling.  I wouldn't even go as far as to call it a filling.  The inside was literally just the blueberries and their juice.  So yes, cornstarch is a must!
The topping, however, is an entirely different story.  The oats provided a base to which the butter could stick and were a great ingredient to balance out all of the sugar.
I am looking forward to trying this recipe again, this time with the cornstarch!

I did try this recipe. I had only made four pie crusts for pie and wanted to get the most out of them. I crust on the top was a wonderful idea, I had all of the ingredients, and could make four pies to give away. It was sooooo good, and the people that got them raved about it. One man said that his grandmother made a pie very similar to that and it brought back memories for him. Great recipe and I am thankful for it. I don't usually try a recipe for the first time and give it to people. I usually try it first. I have never had an issue with Allrecipes and find they are spot on all of the time.

This is a top notch berry recipe! Great for entertaining, or a last-minute dessert for a nice, casual dinner at home. I don't normally review recipes that I have altered without trying the original version first, but this time I'll make an exception because I think I still kept it intact for the most part. I didn't have a pie crust, so I just prepared this for a 9-inch square casserole dish and the portions were right. Also, I did a combo of berries from what I had on hand in the freezer - half blueberries, quarter raspberries, and a quarter blackberries. You would never guess this only took 10 minutes to put together and was made from what I just happened to have on hand to throw together at the last minute. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this pie for thanksgiving with graham crust instead of standard pie crust and with fresh blueberries. While it made it hard to cut actual pie pieces, it was the hit of the desserts! We were calling it blueberry mush cobbler but it was being called the "best blueberry mush ever" by my family.  Next time, I will make it as a cobbler!

Overall a recipe I will try again.  My blueberries were very ripe and juicy, so I added the extra 1T cornstarch and the filling was still runny.  Baked mine for the 40 minutes, and although the filling was bubbly and the topping browned, the bottom crust was raw when I cut into it-probably worse because the filling was so runny.  Still edible as blueberry crisp!

This pie is amazing!  I used two pints fresh blueberries and it was delicious!  Best blueberry pie I have had in years, possibly ever!!!  BTW-I skipped the zest because I didn't have it.

I used a little less sugar (only 1/2 cup), added 1 Tbs. of corn starch and left out the zest (only because I didn't have any). I also opted to skip the pie crust and baked it in a buttered casserole dish instead.  From the ease of preparation to the smell that lingers in the kitchen this recipe was a delicious success!  The crunchy topping is the perfect compliment to the fresh juicy berries.  Served it hot with ice cream and I can't wait to have some more.

It was very good but a bit too sweet. I used thawed blueberries and added 2 Tbls of cornstarch. I will make this again and again but with less sugar. The topping was wonderfully crumbly

Absolutely Delicious!  This was my first pie and it came out amazingly!  I was a tad upset that there wasn't a recipe for the crust.  Since this was my first time making a pie I just picked up a crust-in-a-box.  This did not turn out like I wanted.  I will take up everyone else's advice to use the flaky crust recipe that is also on the site.  It would have made it even better.

I'm reviewing this recipe as written. It has good flavor, but VERY RUNNY. I used frozen blueberries, and although the recipe says either fresh or frozen, using frozen doesn't work. I even added 1 Tablespoon of Corn Starch to the flour mixture, but that didn't help. I expected the pie to be a little runny at first, but now that it's been sitting for almost 2 days, it's still more like blueberry soup. And now the corn starch and flour have created a kind of thin paste on the bottom, so I now have a nice crispy crumbly topping (best part), then cooked from frozen blueberries in blueberry soup, then thin paste, then soft crust. And I hate that this has pretty much ruined my beautiful home-made crust from soaking in the pastey soup. So I recommend that if you use frozen blueberries, you cook them first with some corn starch to make a syrup. Or try a different recipe but use this crumb topping. It is good. And besides the soupyness, the flavor is really good.

I can't even cook and this pie was pretty dang good. All my blueberry mixture did not fit but I'm glad I piled them high because after cooking, they all set in nicely. Topping was also a bit too much but even though you may think you are putting too much on, after cooking, it really thins out. But overall, it was fantastic! (I used frozen blueberries and no lemon zest)

quite good! I cut down the sugar in the pie filling just a tad and, per some reviewers recommendation, added cornstarch (about 1TB and a half). The crumb topping is delicious!

This was a lovely dessert. The lemon adds a bright note to the blueberries - one of my favorite flavor combinations. It was a little too runny, though, even after completely cooling. I would definitely make it again, but I would add a little more thickening agent next time.

OMG was this goooooooood! Sinc I'm diabetic, I substituted Splenda white granular and Splenda brown sugar blend for the white/brown sugars.  Also added 1 cup raspberries along with 2 pts. of blueberries.  You have to try this, it's delicious!

This was fantastic! I had to almost fight my relatives so I could get a serving myself :) I skipped the lemon zest accidentally, but had no complaints. Delicious and much "lighter" than the standard double crust/lattice blueberry pie. The crumble topping was just beautiful and really looked "creative".

Excellent! This was my first blueberry pie and it will definitely not be my last! I did use a different crumb because I did not have any rolled oats on hand. This will be my "go to" recipe from now on. Thanks!

This was an absolutely wonderful recipe.  The first time I made this I made it exactly as stated in the recipe.  As other reviews have said it did come out very runny but the taste was terrific.  I refrigerated the pie to try to firm it up which worked and the pie tasted AWESOME.  The second time I made the pie, as suggested by other members, I added 2T of cornstarch to the berries and it was perfect!  Extreamly easy to make.

This recipe had a great flavor but next time I will follow reviewer advice and add cornstarch to my frozen blueberries and drain some of the juice after the berries are thawed. It was very runny and did not gel up as it should have. I gave it four stars - but would have given five if it hadn't been so runny.

I made this pie with too many blueberries.  Think mountain with a crumb topping, so the berries did not cook in the center. It still came out very good.  I will make this again and reduce the amount of berries I used. You can't ask for an easier recipe!

This is my first review.  It was worth signing up for.  This was the best blueberry pie I ever made.  The only thing I did was cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, per another review, and it couldn't have been more perfect.  Used fresh blueberries.  Thank you Miss Bethany!

This was very tasty. I've used the same struesel topping recipe since I was a kid! I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch too, because there's nothing worse than a runny pie to me! I only used 2 pints of blueberries, so I probably should've reduced the flour and sugar mix as well. Since I forgot to, the blueberries had a little extra gooey-ness to them. It was still a great recipe and I'll be using it again!

I chose this recipe for my first attempt to bake a blueberry pie.  I followed it exactly as written, with the addition of 1 Tbls corn starch as suggested.  The pie turned out perfect and delicious.  As with any fruit pie, be sure to taste your fruit, and adjust the sugar accordingly.

I do lots of baking, so I don't think it was me...the family agreed that this was an okay recipe.  Too much topping--too sweet even though I cut the sugar by 1/3. I did add more flour to help the blueberries set, and that worked fine.  It didn't run at all. I used delicious blueberries that we picked the same day.   I topped it with a yogurt cream sauce, which helped considerably (1C heavy cream, 1.25C plain yogurt, whisk smooth, sprinkle with brown sugar on top (maybe 1/3 Cup), let sit for a couple hours, then stir).

Made a nice looking pie.  I will not use frozen blueberries again because they released too much water during baking and made my pie runny.  I'll save this recipe for only fresh blueberries and hopefully get a better pie.  I've made this twice with frozen ones and the 1st time it seemed OK (not sure of the taste because I gave it away) but the 2nd one we ate was definitely runny due to the frozen blueberries.

I made this for lunch over at my friend's house, and even my husband who is not a big pie or blueberry fan really liked it.  My only complaint (no one else seemed to care) was that the filling was kind of gritty because of the sugar.  I thought it would've dissolved more when it baked, but it was still really delicious.  I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have a lemon    at home.  Overall, a really good pie.

Our entire family LOVED this pie .... even the little kids (2 and 4) loved it.  We will definitely make this the only blueberry pie we make.  We made NO changes to the recipe (other than doubling the cinnamon) and used fresh blueberries.  It was not runny (after you let it cool).

I made this recipe with the pre-made roll out crust and fresh berries.  I did add 2 tbs of cornstarch and it is seriously THE BEST pie EVER!!  And also just a note that while you don't need the lemon zest and juice, I think it is a really nice additional flavor! Will make again for sure and the family will be waiting on it!

I baked this pie this morning with rave reviews from my nephew who had to have a piece for breakfast!  I adhered to all measurements except for lemon juice.  I didn't have fresh lemons for zest so I used 2 tbls. juice.  The 5 cups of fresh berries made the crust heaping full and I feared an oven spill,  but there was none.  This pie was one of the most picture perfect pies I've ever baked.  It set up beautifully.  My nephew said the lemon tang was great with the berries but he wanted some sweet crumbs or crust with each bite to sweeten the berries.

Thank you very much for sharing this recipe, MISSBETHANY.  It's definitely a keeper.

WOW!! What a pie!  My friends and neighbors love it!  However, as a diabetic I substituted the 3/4 cup of white sugar with 6 Tbsp. of Splenda Baking Blend and the 2/3 cup of brown sugar with 1/3 cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  It came out wonderful! My neighbor is already asking for another one and said he'll buy the blueberries!

One of my families favorites. Only change is I bring blueberries, flour and sugar to boil on stoptop before cooking and the pie really firms up great!

Fast and delicious!  Used thawed frozen blueberries, added two T. more flour as others suggested. Perfectly-set filling. The topping gives it a nice crunch. I don't usually add cinnamon to berry pie, but threw caution to the winds and am glad I did. Will make again.

I have to admit I do not use a pie crust at all I have turned this into a blueberry crumble. I do have to add 2 T of cornstarch to thicken it a little. But it is so good with ice cream and I loose some carbs by not using the pie crust which I don't miss. I made it last week and shared it with some friends of mine and they liked it so much they brought me 5lbs of blue berries and ask if I would mind making more which I do not.

This is a good recipe if you make a couple changes.  I don't care how much cornstarch or flour you add, if the pie doesn't bubble up before you take it out of the oven, you'll end up with soup like most people have said. I used fresh berries in a deeper dish so the topping wouldn't fall off.  I used lemon juice and ommitted the  zest cinnamon. I also used 3 T. cornstarch in place of the flour. My pie took 75 min cook, covered lightly with foil the last 30 min of bake time so not to get over browned. You have to see the juices coming out from under the the crumble topping, that's when you'll know it's come to a boil. You'll have a pie that tastes like cornstarch if you don't. Mine thickened up just perfectly. Very tasty served warm with vanilla ice cream!

Great recipe.  Following some of the reviews here, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 1/2 tbls of cornstarch.  I also used fresh blueberries.  This was really good, although I think next time I will omit the cornstarch- the filling was almost too "set."  I also had to bake it way longer than 40 minutes, closer to an hour and 5.  The bottom crust would've been raw if I took it out at 40.  Really like the combination of the lemon zest/juice and blueberries.  Gave it a little something extra than just plain blueberry pie.  It was a hit with me and my family.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent Pie!
I however needed to add some additional flour to the frozen berries just to absorb some of the juice once the pie was baked.
Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe today for the first time and kept to the original recipe without any modifications.  We have approx 2000 high-bush blueberry bushes on our property, so the berries used were about as fresh as you can get.  I also used the French Pastry Pie Crust, also from this site, for the bottom crust (have been using this crust almost exclusively since I found it a couple years ago.  Only regret was we were out of French vanilla ice cream which would have put this dessert over the top for us.  Rave reviews from the family...will make again, but not without stocking up on the ice cream first ;)  Thank you...this one's a keeper and will be added to our ever-growing blueberry recipe file.

Delicious!  I did cut the sugar mixed with the berries to ¼ cup and I thought it was perfect.  Barely tart and avoided being overly sweet with the added topping.  I served it cool and it had set up perfectly.

The recipe tasted great, but it was complete soup.  I used frozen fresh blueberries.  I let them thoroughly defrost to eliminate any extra moisture.  I added a bit extra flour to the filling per suggestion, and I still ended up with blueberries floating in liquid with a crumb top.  I don't think it will be a small fix, but when I figure out how to adequately thicken up the soup, it will be great.

first time making blueberry pie! mine came out a bit runny. there was no way that i was going to get a pretty slice out of it. plated, it looked more like a crumble. delicious though! next time i'll add a tablespoon or two of cornstarch (depending on how plump my blueberries are) and omit the lemon juice. i think the zest adds enough lemon flavor. i think i may also cut it down to 4 cups of blueberries as i had about a cupful of filling that i couldn't cram into my pie crust. no worries though... i just took the extra filling, put it into ramekins with extra crumb topping and made individual blueberry crumbles! yum!

This truly is THE BOMB!  My first time making this receipe.  I took others advice and added 2 TBL of cornstach and I would highly recommend that you do this.  I didn't have any lemons to zest, but I"m not missing it.  I did use the lemon juice though.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it's amazing.  Thx.

FANTASTIC... after his first bite, my fiance said it was hands-down the best blueberry pie he'd ever had. With the lemon juice & zest, and that delicious crumb topping, it makes for a wonderful summer treat! We especially like it with vanilla ice cream :)

YUM! I followed this to a T and it was wonderful. If anyone is wondering how to keep fruit pies from becoming fruit soup you need to add tapioca to the filling. Works like a charm, I never mess around with flour or cornstarch in a pie filling tapioca does the trick! (follow the box for instruction on how much to add)

I made the pie for someone else and they LOVED it!!! She wanted it for her husband's birthday and she said she doesn't even like Blueberry pie, but she tried it and it was delicious! Everyone else enjoyed it too. Guess I have to make more and try one. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. Love the topping. I tried some of that. YUM. Thanks again!!!

This is a delicious blueberry pie .  I brought it to a church dinner and everyone loved it.  I want to commment on a couple of things that others mentioned.  I followered the recipe exactly, and the pie was nice and thick and not runny at all.  I used fresh blueberries, washed them, and patted them dry before using.  Also, someone thought the pie was too sweet.  I dislike sweet gooey pies, and this one definitely was not.  I thought the sweetness was rather light and tasted just right.

This pie is amazing.  I used freshly picked blueberries from a local farm, and everyone devoured it.  I made one adjustment though:  I melted the butter and mixed it into the crumb topping to make it more even and it turned out even better.  I will make this every year during the summertime for years to come.

I much prefer crumb toppings to a double crusted pie.  My kids and I just went blueberry picking and came home with 8 pounds of fresh blueberries.  This was a perfect recipe to start using them.  Pie is already gone and I can't wait to make another!

Fantastic recipe!  Only changes I made was added 1T cornstarch to blueberry mixture and added chopped pecans to the topping.  It was so easy to make and absolutely delicious!

Great Recipe!  I loved the sweet-tart flavors in it. I used fresh local blueberries. It was a little runny, but that did not detract from the excellent flavor.

...this is the best pie. Ever. I added two tbl. of cornstarch to it just to make sure it thickened, and once it had cooled I put it in the fridge before serving it, since my family's a fan of zapping things in the microwave anyway. It's a good thing I have leftover blueberries, because the family completely demolished the thing inside of a half hour! Used the Butter Flaky Pie crust recipe for this one, turned out beautifully.

I bought blueberries from a farm nearby, after I found this recipe. Of course, I made this right away, and this was Oooohhh.. sooooo... goood! I used 1/2 cup of sugar as suggested, and a tablespoon and a quarter of cornstarch. Next time, I will use more corn starch as it was a little runny. The only complaint I have that it fall apart when you pull the first slice out. If I bring this to a picnic, I may have to turn this into a cobbler. Will definitely make again!

O-M-G!!!!!! WOW! FABULOUS! SUPERB! this is the most amazing homemade pie i have ever had. this was also the first fruit pie i have ever made. Iwouldn't have changed a thing except not having a lemon, i added an extra tbs of lemon juice. I wanted to make sure i had that lemon in there. I also followed others suggestions to use cornstarch. ( i did 1 tbs) i think it may have been too juicy without it. but wow. with 3 of us eating 1/2 the pies gone OMG YUMMMMMMM!

there was too much of the flour mixture on the berries, it didn't cook into the pie and left white and funny tasting bits throughout the pie.  Also, the filling was a bit tart, but was good with the crumble.

A little too sweet. Next time I'll try using 1/2 c. sugar. I used frozen blueberries and they worked fine. The pie really needs to sit overnight to firm up. I added a Tbsp of cornstarch like others suggested. Next time I will try cooking the filling on the stove top for a little while first to help the corn starch set.

If I only had one dessert to pick it will always be blueberry pie. This didn't disappoint. It was very good. I also took the advice from others and added a TBSP of cornstarch. It came out the perfect consistency. The crumb topping was a little too sweet but that could be change a little next time. This will be on our table again for sure.

This was an excellent pie.  It was easy to make and the crumb topping was great.  I think next time I would make slightly less of the topping and add a few more blueberries.

I put more cornstarch than called for because I like my pie filling thick.  This was like runny water.  The flavor of the filling was sickeningly sweet.  And the topping did just that; topped it off with even more sugar.  Had to throw the whole pie out.

I used cornstarch and fresh berries, also - agreed, can use probably 1/2 the sugar if you get good, sweet fresh berries. Substituted white sugar for Splenda, also.. just about undetectable - next time, I'll probably use regular white, and just cut the amount in 1/2 (or down to 1/3, even!) - wonderful recipe (and delicious with a little ice cream, as all warm pies are!)

Excellent! I used 1 1/2 tbs cornstarch and fresh blueberries (which were really sweet so I could have used less sugar),  and it turned out perfect. I will make it again soon since I only got one slice and that was not enough!

This pie recipe is my "go-to" choice for blueberry dessert in the summer (and witner too with frozen berries). I have even prepped it ahead of time and cooked it over a campfire inside of a dutch oven and it was super. We served it with some ice cream we kept cold in the freezer with some dry ice. Although I am not one to follow recipes as written I do with this one , since it is so simple and streamlined. My family gives this recipe the golden fork award. Bravo to Miss Bethany for her submitting this delicious treat!

This pie is just ok as is.  I wish I had read the reviews before making it.  It definitely needs the cornstarch to help hold it together.  It was way runny.  It has alot of potential and I will probably try again sometime making the suggested changes.  Hopefully that will change my mind on this pie!

I made this the other day with fresh blueberries.  It was very crumbly when cut, even after resting several hours and overnight, but the flavor was outstanding!!  I would do as another viewer sugested and make this into a blueberry crumble without a pie crust on the bottom!! Serve with warm with vanilla ice cream and it becomes an easy summer treat--delicious!! Thank you to Miss Bethany and all you viewers with those helpful hints!

YUMMY. Couldn't stop eating it.  Added an extra cup of flour since comments said it was runny - perfect amount after cooling to room temperature (after baking, still runny, but when cool, solid)

I made this pie tonight for dinner guests.  I let it cool for about an hour before eating it and it was very runny.  The flavor was ok, but a little too sweet for my taste.

This was excellent.  Took it to a potluck at work and it was devoured.  The only thing I might try next time is a deep dish crust.  Those blueberries were piled pretty high before they went into the oven but they did not overflow.  This was a hit!

This is so easy and perfectly delicious.  I followed the directions to a Tee and it came out great.  I served it for Thanksgiving, it also looks pretty.  I will make it often because it's so easy.

I had no trouble with this pie being soupy, and I didn't add any additional thickeners. I did use fresh (picked an hour before) berries, so I'm not sure if that made any difference. I did add about 1 t of cinnamon to the cinnamon/flour mixture, and left out the lemon zest as I didn't have any, but otherwise let everything the same. It was a delicious pie, and will surely get made again.

Yum!  Hit the spot for me; I added in the 2T of cornstarch as suggested, and had only a slight runniness problem after waiting 1/2 an hour for the pie to cool -- after using foil to hold the "slice" in place, the pie was fine!  Overall, I thought the pie was almost too sweet for me -- I don't know if it's b/c my pkg of blueberries held a little over 4, maybe 4.5 cups, but I'll probably take out both a little white and a little brown sugar.  Great for just a single crust pie, though!

Don't use frozen blueberries unless you want blueberry soup!  I think frozen will only work if you don't use a pie crust and make it a crisp instead.  I even let my berries thaw a bit and poured off the excess juice, added 3 tbsp. cornstarch in addition to the flour and still, blueberry soup.  I was amazed that my kids and the hubbby ate it all but I didn't like it.  With all the liquid, the pie crust just couldn't cook up correctly and was soggy.  I think the recipe would be fine if you used fresh berries AND added the cornstarch.

This was a very yummy pie!  I took the some advice from the other bakers and added corn starch to thicken and used frozen berries instead of fresh.  My only advice to others is to make extra crumb topping since a lot of it sinks into the pie.  My family likes a lot of crumbs!  Otherwise, excellent!  Will definetely make this one again and again!

Great Pie!! I used a refrigerated crust and frozen berries that we picked last summer. Had to cook for nearly double the time specified becaues of the frozen berries. I did also use cornstarch instead of flour because I like my pie to really set up. Love the crumb topping may add walnuts next time. Thanks.

blueberries did not burst so next time I will cook on the stove top and reduce them first. came out too watery, which may have also been caused by the amount of sugar that seems too much. I agree with another review that said the crumb topping was too thick so the second time I made this, I cut it in half and it was much better.

It was tasty, but soupy, maybe because I used frozen blueberries? I did thaw and drain excess juice off of them, but it still needed thickening.

Here's the recipe for the delicious Berry pie I made yesterday for my sister's Christmas party. Step 1: (Easy Peasy way) Basically I got a frozen already made crust I got from Trader Joe's. Step 2: I then mixed in a bowl 2 cups frozen blueberries, 1 1/2 cups cranberries, 1 1/2 cups froezen rasberries (basically 5 cups berries your choice) mixed in with 1/2 cup blue agave (I try to avoid sugar), 1/3 cup pastry wheat flour with 2 teaspoons lemon zest (I actually used extract which made it very tart) and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. I also added 1 tablespoon corn starch (or you can use arrowroot) to thicken it (this will be needed as extra water will be created when the berries melt as one reviewer pointed out). Put this filling in the pie crust. Step 3: Follow the rest of the instructions in this recipie to add the crumb topping - I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and used 3 tablespoons apple sauce and 3 tablespoons cannola oil. It tastes great either hot or cold. I tried it hot topped with whipped cream (see picture) which was really good - Enjoy!

I read other reviews and added a tablespoon of corn starch to make the filling less watery since I used frozen blueberries, but it still came out a bit watery. The other suggestion would be to reduce the sugar in the filling because it was way too sweet for my liking. I’m still going to eat it because it’s not bad but these are just a few of my tips that I’ll put to use next time .

Loved this but it was a bit sweet for me. I added a 2-3cups more blueberries the second round and it was perfect for our tastes! Excellent flavor on the filling and crumble. Filling would be nice in a traditional pie crust and top as well.

I love this pie. I add a little corn starch to make it more firm and less juice but other than that the recipe is perfect. I make it many times every summer.

Made it with blueberries from our own garden. The pie looked so good. Tasted fresh, delicious. Served easily.  I prefer the crumb top over a lattice top.

The berries and sugar-flour mixture did not blend while it baked, and the bottom crust was not cooked. The result is a mushy, watery, gritty mess. PS it wasn't sweet enough, either.

This is a keeper!  Unique twist on a typical blueberry pie.  Used frozen blueberries (thawed......will partially thaw the next time - they got pretty mushy), reduced both sugars (1/4 cup in the filling was great, and 1/2 cup in topping worked), and added 1 Tbl tapioca.  Wonderful flavor!!!!

Delicious!  I changed to 10 servings to fit my 10-inch pie pan.  I used frozen berries and added 3T of minute tapioca.  But it was incredibly runny unless served right out of the refrigerator.  Next time I will add more tapioca and/or cornstarch.

Definitely was a very tasty pie! Some changes that I made was, are used frozen blueberries but I took them out tonight before and sat them in a bowl with paper towel lined. Every day I switched out the paper towel to absorb the juiciness. Then, I added 2 tablespoons  of corn starch and half a tablespoon of flour additional. made for a perfect consistency!!! The crumble was not as soft as I had hoped for, but it was definitely tasty!

Easy recipe especially if you used frozen pie shell.  I always use frozen blueberries as I pick them in my yard at the lake and always have them to use.  I never thaw them for pie or muffins. This recipe has plenty of thickener (flour). If you want more add a TBSP more to the berries before they go into the pie shell.  Baked 1 hour.  I would maybe use 4 1/2 berries next time so that there was more room for the crumble topping to lay flat on the pie.  Mine had a swell in the middle so I had to be careful adding the topping as it rolled down.  I put my hand along the edge as I was adding topping to prevent that.  Fabulous. We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Rave reviews from my family.  It’s gone..Yum.

This has to be the best and easiest blueberry pie ever.  Yes, it takes 5 cups of berries but it is so good.  I did add 1 tbsp of cornstarch as suggested by another reader- it make the pie easier to cut and serve.

This pie is AMAZING! We both love it; and I'm not big on fruit pies. I used blueberries fresh off the bushes. I had to use sucralose (Splenda) with the berries because of hubby's diabetes & my suspected pre-diabetes. The topping was made using the Splenda/brown sugar hybrid. I wonder how this pie would taste with real sugar! Probably 10 stars worth of tasty!

7.19.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/86150/blueberry-crumb-pie/ ... 'Using homegrown (juicy) & frozen berries, I increased flour to 1/2c.  I didn't go with the lemon business, but I'm sure I'd like it, too.  'Thinking these juicy berries would cause a long term sounding of the smoke alarm, I only used 4c berries, not 5.  Kudos to the submitter for not adding more sugar to the berries.  Many add too much & the berry flavor is lost.  The topping was good, but - & I mean this not to be a negative - kind of like a dry oatmeal cookie.  It softened overnight, of course.   Surprisingly with the right amount of sugar with the berries, the topping didn't sweeten it too much, but it didn't.  Huh.  :D  Good, but I prefer regular ole pie crust.   Thanks for sharing your recipe, MissBethany!

I made this with frozen wild blueberries. What a waste!
Was curious how the pie would set up with no cornstarch and found out instead, how to make overly sweet, gritty, blue soup.
So disappointed!

WAY too much sugar in this recipe. I would cut it to 1/4 cup of sugar. Also, after adding 1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch, it was still very runny.  It would have been delicious if not so darn sweet! My husband wouldn't even have a second piece.

This recipe was easy to follow but the "crumb" topping was more like a paste. I thought it was supposed to come out like crumbs--it ended up being paste-y. Ugh!

This was my first time making this and it came out runny and not enough of a crumb topper. It taste good, but looking at it is another story. You could literally take a straw and drink some of the filling.

Definitely one of the best blueberry pies I've ever made. After reading the reviews, I made two changes. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to flour-sugar-lemon mix, and I allowed the pie to sit for 24 hours before serving it. It turned out beautifully. My family loved it. I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe as written. It was absolutely delicious but I would make two changes. First of all the lemon juice should be added to the blueberries not the dry ingredients. If you add it to the dry ingredients it clumps up and is not spread evenly through the filling. I would also use instant tapioca instead of flour in the filling. It didn’t set up as it should have and I could still taste the flour.

This is a very easy recipe. I've made it twice, the first time in a 9" glass pie plate and the second in an 8" aluminum pan and reduced the recipe to 6 servings. I don't care for store bought pie crusts so I used Ina Garten's pie crust recipe (so easy and a winner every time). Both times

Made this as written but added  one tablespoon of cornstarch. Turned out perfect!! I made this with blueberries fresh out of my yard. My husband and I thought it was the best blueberry pie we have tasted. By the way I have 5 blueberry bushes and will make again before summer is over. Thanks for sharing.

I added corn starch based on other reviews, but wish I hadn't. 

recipe makes more crumble than needed, probably more blueberries too. At least for my dish.

The topping was the best part. This pie was very runny. Like blueberry soup. I followed the directions exact. I almost always use frozen blueberries, that's why I chose this recipe. Maybe I will have to make it again and see if it's any better.

I made this pie for Christmas and it was a hit.  The pie was gone almost the moment it was time for dessert.  I did add a extra half cup of sugar but beyond that I  followed the recipe.   I highly recommend this pie for any event.

This is so delicious and easy to make. As recommended I added 1Tbsp cornstarch and it turned out prefect.  I recommend using fresh blueberries as I did. Will be making more of this, and as the blueberries season coming to a closed, using frozen will have to due on that note... make sure your frozen blueberries are completely thawed out & drained. Also add 2Tbsp of cornstarch for frozen blueberries instead.

Excellent recipe.  Made it as recipe reads, except added  2 tbs. cornstarch, and blind-baked the crust for about 10 minutes, covering the edges with tin foil (I used frozen deep dish pie crust).  Refrigerated the pie after it cooled a bit.  After a few hous of chilling it still bled a bit, but nothing terrible, it was still juicy.  Excellent with our homemade peach ice cream. Crumble on top was nice and crispy, good texture .  Definitely will make this again.

LOVE this pie!! Made it a few times already and it's always a hit! I have always made the recipe just as it's written here but the only difference is I usually bake it for about an hour instead of the recommended 40 minutes to ensure the top is browned nicely. Just keep an eye on it after the 40 minute mark and pull it out once the top is nice and crispy

Made as written - when preparing the filling, I used a pastry cutter to cut in the lemon zest/lemon juice into the sugar and flour before adding the rinsed, patted dry, fresh blueberries.  Not sure if this prevented the soggy crust that some encountered.  This was a big hit with guests and I will definitely make again.

Intact, seemingly uncooked blueberries tumbled out onto the plate in a puddle of liquid when I served this!  The pie definitely needed more time in the oven so the filling could gelatinize and the berries soften.  I would make it again; however, I'd bake it longer in order to thicken the filling (and actually cook and soften the berries).  I'll try it again just to see if it works!

Terrific pie! Much more exciting than a normal 2 crust blueberry pie. The entire family LOVED it! I'm not sure that I can pick enough blueberries to keep up with demands for this pie. I wouldn't change a single thing.

I found the crumble topping was enough for two pies.  The pie itself was a bit runny.  That could have been a result of using wonderfully large blueberries from California. I may add a bit more flower to the blueberry mix next time.  All in all I gave the pie a 5 star as it was very delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again. Many times over in fact.

This was absolutely yummy!  Even family members that don't like blueberry pie tried it and ended up eating it all! I used canned blueberries as the market was out of fresh berries, added lemon juice (didn't have lemon zest so left that part out) and finished off with the topping as directed.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for a family get-together. My brother loved it so much that he ate three slices! I suppose that means I'll be making this again! 

I squeezed my own lemon juice, which I think gives a truer lemon flavor (it's less tart than the concentrate.) I also added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling dry ingredients before adding the blueberries. Next time I will try 1 1/2 tablespoons because it was still slightly running. 

Our store was out of fresh blueberries so we used frozen. I forgot to thaw them overnight so I put them in a colander and lowered it into cold water for 5 minutes to thaw. Then I let them drain and patted them with a few paper towels. 

Love this recipe. Will be making it again but may need to make two pies next time!

This is AMAZING....and truth be told, I'm a horrible cook.  One suggestion,  don't leave out the lemon juice or zest.   I have also made gluten-free version with gluten free oatmeal and premade gluten free pie crust, with Pillsbury Gluten multi-purpose gluten free flour blend and I can't tell a difference.  I have not had a problem with it being "overly wet".   With the suggestion of another reviewer from Grandma Ople's Apple pie, I now always use a pizza stone- not sure if that helps or not.   Now giving this to neighbors as xmas gifts.  Thanks for the recipe!  By the way, it was so good, this was my first review--I loved it that much.

I've made this delicious pie twice. My son requested it for his birthday instead of cake. The first time I made it I used fresh blueberries and followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfect. I made it again yesterday but used frozen blueberries to cut down on cost. I read other reviews saying to add 2 T of cornstarch which I did. The results were not as good as using fresh berries but only in appearance not in taste. My pie was a bit runny. Next time I will just go with the fresh berries. Either way though it's the most delicious blueberry pie!

Made this for a dinner party.  Great comments from everyone.  I read reviews and add corn starch, thawed berries, used less sugar.  Did not have oatmeal so I did a flour, brown/white sugar and butter for crumb

I used 2 packages of fresh blueberries and it yielded a little more than 4 cups and it was plenty. I added 2 TBLSPN cornstarch. Most of my fruit pies add it to keep together. Thought it was delish. We didn't find it too runny or too sweet. We are big fans of crumb topping and this was great.

Well I didn't read the reviews so next time I will use a tblspn of tapioca to thicken this pie. Over all very yummy. For the topping I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl except the rolled oats and put in the food processor to cut in the butter. After it was a crumbly mixture I mixed in the oats by hand. Way quicker. I also brushed the pie crust with some egg before filling to keep it from getting soggy. Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure what happened.....followed the recipe but all I could taste was lemon.  We hand picked all our blueberries fresh, the topping was great, it was a little runny but we were ok with that but all we could taste was lemons.  I think I will ditch the lemon next time. Easy and simple directions!  Will try again!

What a delicious pie! A great way to make the typical blueberry pie special. The changes I made were cutting white sugar back slightly to 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons, added natural sweetness of 1/3 cup honey, and used 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I used 4 cups of blueberries, which, once I added the topping, filled out the 9 inch glass pie dish perfectly. I also added in 1 1/2 tablespoon of corn starch based in others' reviews when I mixed the dry ingredients (before adding in the lemon rind and juice). I use Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe from here. I baked it for 50 minutes, then let it sit in the oven another five minutes to brown a bit more. It was a huge hit at my 12 person dinner party!

I made the basic flaky pie crust but it did not make enough to cover the sides of the pie but it was tasty.

Very good but I made a few changes which made all the difference. Instead of using flour with the filling, I used lemon Jello. The blueberries tend to get very juicy and almost watery making the pie more of soup. Also if you use frozen blueberries thaw them first otherwise the topping is tough to put on.

Great recipe! To avoid runny blueberries I add 1/4 cup tapioca to the filling, and sprinkle a little more just before I add the topping, works wonders and doesn't alter the taste of the pie one bit! It's my go-to recipe, and my family loves it! Works great as a mixed berry pie as well, I've done it for just blueberry, or with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and pomegranate seeds. This recipe never fails!!!

This is a good recipe but my pie turned out runny and was way too sweet. I added 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and baking powder to the topping. My favorite apple crisp recipe uses essentially the same topping and it helps to keep the crumble crisp but not rock hard. Next time I will cut the crumb topping in half and use half the sugar in the filling and add tapioca to the filling. I used fresh berries which does make a difference but I think fresh make the best pies.

Pie was excellent.  I might just add a tblsp. of cornstarch next time to thicken the filling and maybe use just a little less sugar.  But everyone raved about it.

One problem, I used a single pie crust recipe that showed up with this blueberry crumb pie recipe and when I went back to look and print it out, it was no longer offered with the pie.  I was very disappointed as it was the best pie crust I have ever made.

This is delicious.  I use organic pastry crust, organic rolled oats and organic flour. I use orange peel granules and I added organic almond extract.  I use only 2/3 of the white sugar. I don't use any sugar in the top crumble as the oats and cinnamon don't require it. I also use more oats than it calls for and this time added some flax seed. It's scrumptious.

Yes, it's not going to cut pretty. But ooohhhh, it's delicious! Made it just as written, with fresh berries. FYI, the measurements for lemon zest and juice are about the zest of one whole lemon and the juice of half of it.

This was exceptional! I used fresh blueberries (almost 3 pints) and an oil-based pie crust. I might've used a bit less lemon juice and I added a splash of almond extract. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I love to bake...yes...real men can bake and feel comfortable with it. With a bountiful crop of blueberries this year, I started baking. When I came across this one I decided to give it a shot. ABSOLUTELY amazing! I didn't change a thing on my first attempt...it was perfect. Now that I know how good it is and how much my family raved over it...I might just put a twist on it here or there.  TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!!

AMAZING!  My 8 year old son said he would give it 4 thumbs up if he had 2 extra thumbs.   This is voted as our family's new favorite pie.  I followed the recipe exactly using fresh blueberries we picked the day before. It turned out perfect and the pie set nicely.  It was not too sweet.  I'd recommend using a deep dish pie pan as the blueberries filled to the top of our deep dish pie pan.   Enjoy!

This is way too sweet.  I didn't like the crumb topping--too many different flavors going on what with the blueberries, the lemon, the brown sugar topping.  And I would cut way back on the sugar in the blueberries.

This was pretty nice, but the filling turned out pretty soupy for me. Most fruit pies do, probably because I live at a high elevation, so I probably can't blame the recipe for that. I made the pie exactly as written, using frozen blueberries (which I thawed in the fridge for a few hours), and I baked it for 45 minutes. Despite being a structural mess, the flavors were very nice - I was surprised to find that the lemon juice and zest made a noticeable and tasty difference. I might consider making this again, and hopefully I can implement some of the suggestions I see in other reviews, and wind up with a five-star experience.

So I had extra blueberries to use and thought I'd make a dessert.  We're picky dessert eaters but this recipe looked good and I had a graham cracker crust lying around.  The results - It was amazing!!!  Every person wanted seconds and said it was one of the best desserts they had.  It's a keeper, thanks for sharing it!

Great recipe but a little too much sugar and definitely will add cornstarch next time.  I will recommend only 1/2 c. white sugar in with the blueberries.  The lemon juice is fine, but squeeze it over the top of the berries before they are placed in the flour/sugar. There is absolutely no way to mix it in after coating the berries. (Duh!) The lemon zest is totally unnecessary. I used frozen Dole Blueberries and they were great.  Note to self: EVERY pie recipe in this world that calls for sugar ALSO needs salt, at least 1/2 teaspoon, whether the recipe calls for lemon juice or not.

Tasted really good, but didn't set up. Needs cornstarch or some other thickening agent. LOVE the crumb topping though!!

This was the first time I'd used frozen blueberries for pies so I was nervous as I was taking them to a family dinner. On the advise of others I thawed the berries in a colander to remove some juice and added a tbsp of cornstarch to the sugar/flour mixture.  It was perfect!  Highly recommend!

This is the best blueberry pie I've ever had. I didn't add cornstarch; just let the frozen berries drain and poured off the juice. We ate it when it was still warm and it was fabulous! No more messing with double crust blueberry pies for me!

This is my first blueberry pie, I liked it and boyfriend loved it. I used 2T cornstarch and it was still a runny, will put in fridge a few hours next time. Suggest reducing the total sugar about 1/3.

I used a whole wheat crust & I substitued
whole wheat flour where it called for white flour & the pie was excellant. So
try this for a more healthy version.

I used fresh blueberries and received rave reviews from everyone. I followed the recipe except I didn't add the lemon zest (cuz I didn't have a lemon) and added 1 Tbl cornstarch as suggested by other raters. It was not runny at all and stayed together perfectly in slices. I didn't do the crumb topping and it was still very yummy!

I followed one of the other reviews and didn't use the pie base.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half as it was just a little bit too sweet for my taste.  All in all very good and so easy.

This is a delicious pie.  I used fresh blueberries in my pie.  My pie did not set up and was very liquidy, but it was still very good.  I am not good a making pies, so I would not fault the recipe for my lack of success.  Also, everyone raved about the crumb topping-so good!

This one bombed! The flour sugar mixture just sank to the bottom of the bowl while mixing with the blueberries. The pie came out dry... the berries never cooked enough to "pop".  I think next time I will wash the berries first to get them damp, or add some orange juice to the mixture. I will also try cooking it at 350 for sixty minutes.  The topping was great. scooped out the top of the pie and had it with vanilla ice cream!

This did not work for me.  I followed the instructions exactly but I wish I followed the reviewers instructions instead.  It came out like blueberry soup!  The flavor was very good and everyone liked it but it wasn't formed like a pie at all.  Maybe I'll try again with fresh blueberries in the summer.

Fabulous pie!  I used frozen blueberries and added some Minute Tapioca as a thickening agent.  I may cut down on the sugar a bit but still really awesome recipe!!!

I LOVE this pie, and have made it several times. I particularly love how the lemon tastes with the berries. In fact, the only time this didn't turn out as well was when I didn't put in any zest. I'm cooking one now, but forgot about the runniness so neglected to add in the cornstarch. Ah well, if it comes out runny, I'll just put it on a bowl and eat it with a spoon! :)

I didn't care much for the lemon flavor.  Next time I'll omit the zest or cut it way down.  I used fresh blueberries that I had frozen when blueberries were in season.  No problems with it not setting up.

Great flavor but a little to sweet to my liking. I would cut back on the sugar.  To keep the pie from runnig I would partially defrost frozen berries.
