I make this ALL the time! We've always called it 'breaded steaks', but it's the exact same thing. The only thing I do differently is buy the roast already cut into thin 'steaks' because my grocery store sells it like that and it makes life easier for me, lol. These are very good and I like to serve them either with pasta, lasagna, or stuffed shells or just with rice, or mashed potaotes and a salad and veggie. Definately give these a try, you won't be disappointed! :)

I'm sorry, but I wasted my ingredients and most importantly my time AND my good meat on this recipe. I followed every step to the "T". Except for freezing to cut. My meat was already thin. It just sat there in the oil. It was a mess. The flavor was bland. My fiance's mother made this before, and this recipe tastes NOTHING like hers... I think I'll stick with her recipe. I don't want to sund rude, but I am very dissatisfied... I will try to make again, maybe with a different type of meat. I just don't think breaded crumbs is for beef at all. Thanks tho. If it turns up better next time, I will rate high and try to edit this.

This is one of my favorite meals.  I use the thin cut steak used for braccole.  I also use flour as the first coating.  I generously season the flour with adobo and sazon.  Then I coat the meat with flour, then egg, then bread crumbs...then back in egg and bread crumbs.  Gives it a nice thick coating.  I serve with tomatoes slices in italian or balsamic dressing...yum!

The lemon helped but the flavor was not great and the meat was as tough as could be. I won't try this again.

Our family of 7 devoured these breaded steaks!  I used pre-sliced beef and boxed Parmesan Panko bread crumbs instead of the putting the ingredients together myself.  It turned out fantastic! The trick to keeping the meat tender is not to over cooks and turn with tongs, not a fork, as it will maintain it's juices with tongs.

I liked the aspect of breaded beef. I used a thin cut steak and marinated it in balsamic vinegar for 30 minutes. after doing the egg dip and breading I BAKED it in the oven for a bit of a healthier choice. It was wonderful on a crunchy kaiser roll with some lettuce and tomato.

I made a few changes due to dietary restrictions. I didn't add the parm and used panko instead of dry bread crumbs that I flavoured with two teaspoons of Italian Seasoning.  I used  bottom round that I pounded thinly after slicing. Once the meat was breaded I put them on a tray and into the fridge for two hours, this allows the flavours to meld and helps to keep the breading on the meat. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My mother made this recipe for years as I grew up and I have made it for my family also...excellent.  She also used round steak cut up in individual pieces cooked the same way.... very good.

I marinated the steaks and used flour and an egg wash before covering in bread crumbs. Then I baked it. The breading stayed dried and it came right off! I have never have that problem with chicken. The meat was tender and tasted good but I would have loved to test out the breading with it. Maybe next time I'll deep fry it.
