Nice tender sugar cookie and I like the fact that it did not spread after cutting and baking. I did use 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract due to personal taste. Other than that....no changes. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I wanted a soft rolled cookie that would keep the shape of the cut-out and have that nice tang that comes from the cream of tartar.  This delivered on all points!  Thanks so much for sharing- I'm sure Betty Brown would be proud.  :-)
