This is very good. I've been making this for my family for a couple of years. The only difference is that I add 16 ounces of sour cream on top of ground beef mixture, then I put on salsa and cheese.

I have made this recipe many, many, MANY times and we love it.  I've made it with ground turkey, pepper jack cheese, mixed the meat with the salsa....  So many different ways to prepare and excellent every time!!!

This was very easy to assemble before I left for work. I used my own homemade taco seasoning as well as my own homemade refried beans and homemade salsa. I was able to assemble this and get all the "toppings" ready for the boys once they were ready for dinner. I made a sour cream-cilantro based topping (Fiesta for Your Greens--my own recipe) for the top of this casserole. It's in the oven now, but I'll update my review once I hear how the boys liked it. EDITED: Yes, they liked it.

I had to bring a dish to a sports party that would be both-gender friendly.  This bake was easy and so delicious!  People devoured it instantly!

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and had a last minute get together at my house last night and was really surprised at what a hit this was. A great twist on method of serving up typical taco night dish.  I followed the recipe exactly. Super easy. Great flavor. The versatility of this recipe for substituting and adding ingredients makes it easy to customize to taste. Yum!

I never seem to do a dip/nacho, normally I do tacos or a casserole.  This is really good.  It is nice to have this over chips instead of making tacos.

Yummy. I did make a few changes. I used ground turkey and only had one can of refried beans so I used that and 2 cups of cooked brown rice and both cheddar and mozzarella. I think it would be good the original way as well. I topped with tomatoes and black olives and sour cream. Tasty lunch

This was a great change-up from our normal taco/burrito night.  I made it with tvp taco "meat" and it turned out well.

This dip was awesome!  Served it at a family party and everyone loved it - even the grandparents.  Very easy to make - I used the fat free refried beans.

Was a big hit with my family. I modified it a bit, I put two cans of beef chili with beans instead of two cans of refried beans on the bottom.

Easy and crowd-pleasing. I recommend any optional toppings that cool it down (sour cream worked well).

A little runny but took it to an appetizer get together and got rave reviews from every one!
