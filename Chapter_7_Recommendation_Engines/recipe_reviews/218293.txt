Nice way to perk up your burgers! I cut this down to 5 servings to give it a try. I used smoked paprika vs. regular and added a little more chili powder. Next time I might mix this into the burger meat vs. rubbing it on the outside of the patty(cutting back on the sea salt). Overall, pretty good.

I made a half recipe for this and instead of using it as a burger rub, I used it as a spice blend for homemade jo-jo potatoes. This spice blend was really quite good. I only made one change and I cut back on the salt only because I didn't want the fries to come out too salty. I just omitted it and sprinkled the fries with salt AFTER I'd tossed them with a little EVOO and the spice blend. Very good. I can't wait to try this on homemade turkey burgers and as a rub on chicken or pork, too!

This rub was very easy to prep and took my ordinary turkey burgers to a whole new level!  Cooked on my range, the brown sugar caramelized the outside of the patty.  Yum!

I think I was expecting something a bit more savory/herby than mexican - the cumin, paprika and red pepper flakes should've tipped me off so my bad for not paying more attention.  This recipe was OK.  I followed the ingredients to the letter.  I think it would make a better taco seasoning than a burger rub.  

Since the instructions are non-existent, this is what I did:  I combined the ingredients and shook them to mix them in a small tupperware bowl.  I had some frozen beef patties I got from the market, so I spooned out 6 tbs of the mix into a larger tupperware bowl and moistened the still-frozen patties with water.  Then I shook them individually in the bowl to coat them.  Using the original wax paper dividers, I stacked them again and covered the bowl, putting them in the refrigerator to marinate for two hours.  They were half-thawed when I fried them on the stovetop, and they came out more juicy than usual.  Although I didn't care for the flavor that much, the prep method worked out really well.

If you're torn between tacos and burgers for dinner, by all means this is a good recipe, but I personally will look elsewhere.

I used this as a rub on portobello mushrooms before roasting them and making mushroom burgers.  I sprayed a little olive oil on the mushroom so the rub would adhere.  I did swap out the sugar for splenda and cut the recipe wayyy down as I am a cook for "one".  Lastly, it was very easy to store.  I was able to use it about 2 weeks later with no problems.  Can't wait to try it again.

Very good. Balanced. I’ll probably keep experimenting, but in the meantime I’ll use this over the store bought seasonings.

My 13 year old chose this well rounded "burger spice" as we call it to add to chicken, burgers, or beef roast. We really like it and choosing this recipe gets the kids involved in cooking and tastes.
