It just cracks me up (actually frustrates me to no end) when people write negative comments on a recipe that they have altered beyond recognition; for example; Why would anyone use Franks Hot sauce especially, in a tuna noodle and pickle salad? Really? It's no wonder it wasn't a hit with anyone in her family! I found this salad exceptional, I made it as stated, however, it's one that would be adaptable to your families likes however, if you change it, and it isn't a big hit, don't rate it as the original!

I added a little fresh ground pepper and a dash of Frank's Hot Sauce. My husband took half of this to work with him for lunch and my kids ate the rest. One kid like it, one didn't and my husband was indifferent. Basic tuna pasta salad that was easy to prepare but not a home run for this family. It's a nice base recipe.

My wife made this recipe for me, and I thought I would hate tuna and pickles together, but this is really good. I even eat the leftovers for breakfast. Use big pickles, like Claussen pickles, or else there won't be enough (if you use small dills). Pretty much add everything to taste - we put in a whole 8 oz block of cheese! This was great for the kids, too. Just serve some tomatoes and fruit on the side.

This was delicious!!! I served it as a side dish, but I think it could stand alone for lunch. The only change I made was to use 8 oz. shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of the cubes, because that's what I had on hand. I think there was a little too much cheese, I would cut back on that next time.

This was really good. 
I haven't made Tuna Mac Salad in awhile. 
I used ranch salad dressing instead of mayo (it's what I had more of)...and I doubled the recipe, I also added onions and used a deli mustard.  Really loved the pickle and cheese part of the recipe!
Plan on making this lots this summer, Thanks!

This is very good! All my kids favorite ingredients combined into one dish. I used bowtie pasta instead of elbow macaroni. I also used dill pickles and pickle juice from the dill pickles recipe by sharon howard on this site. I will be making this again! Thanks!

I am always on the lookout for a really flavorful pasta salad, and I love pickles! I added 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1/2 tsp. black pepper for a little more flavor. Also used grated cheese instead of cubes.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I made it using fat free mayo, whole wheat pasta, and garlic dill pickles.  I think next time I will add some onion and celery.

I will not make this recipe again.  It has potential, but definitely lacks something.  Additionally, it was very dry, even with extra mayo.

I've been iced in all week, so this was the perfect back-of-the-cupboard-food recipe! I used thin egg noodles since that's what I had and they worked fine. It reminded me of Chicken a la King but with tuna. The only thing I changed was that I couldn't wait until it chilled through to eat it, but it was good warm too, and I have leftovers for tomorrow!

I found it simultaneously bland and overpowered by the cheese.  Celery may help and I've seen people mention garlic powder and garlic salt.  Green olives will help.  Peas, too.  There's a solid foundation here - how do you go wrong with pasta and tuna fish - but as written there's just no zing.

Awesome recipe. I made a few small alterations though. doubled the ingredients to make more and instead of pickles, I used sweet relish and for the cheese I used shredded mozzarella. Also, I added thawed sweet peas and paprika for the topping and chilled it for one hour before serving. Turned out great! Thanks for sharing!

This went over great! I added some celery and garlic powder after I first tasted it and mixed it in, and it was even better! A few great touches for flavor and texture.

This was the first time that I actually looked up this recipe to see if there were other variations of the tuna pasta I make. I add sweet peas, finely chopped a 1/2 of a sweet vidalia onion , mayo or greek yogurt for less fat content but more flavor. I always add boiled eggs, and my seasonings salt, pepper, garlic powder,onion powder, and a hint of sugar. This time I chopped up some celery as well and chopped bread and butter pickles. I also omitted the cheese because I had not been to the grocery store this week yet and so I left it out. It is always my go to recipe when I don't have time to cook a full meal and my family loves it!!! It's great to eat with crackers as well. Oh and instead of elbow macaroni shells, I used Wacky Mac veggie shapes because this pasta is enriched with tomato,beet,and spinach!!! A very awesome way to get your kids to eat their veggies when they don't realize they are...lol!!!

Yummy! I used peas instead of pickles, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar in place of the pickle juice. I also used cheddar. I’ve been looking for a recipe like this for a while, combining mac and cheese and tuna salad, and this is great. It’ll be a regular lunch from now on.

I had made this recipe for a company gathering years ago, and have been trying to find the recipe again ever since.  I agree with the reviewer that commented about changing the recipe and then giving a less than stellar review.  The poster suggests many options.  Hot sauce was not one of them.

For me, the ingredients, pickles, mustard and cheese makes this the best tuna salad I have ever had.  Growing up, I hated my mother's tuna salad, which she made often.  It made me leery to ever try any other.  The biggest modification that I made was immediately doubling the recipe.  I made it for my sister last week and she loved it.  The only change was eliminating the pasta as she prefers less carbs.  She thought it was amazing and we then tried it using left over rotisserie chicken.  Also amazing.

As suggested in the options, I added finely minced onion and finely minced celery and added dried dill on one of the trials and dried thyme on another.

Thank you for posting this amazing creation.

Delicious!  I’ll admit the pickles had me second guessing if that would taste “funky”, but it actually gave the  the salad a perfect combination of flavors.  I’ll be making this again for sure.

I really wanted to love this as I like all the ingredients listed.....it was only OK. I had to increase the mayo to a full cup because once I got all of my ingredients in the bowl with the noodles it was on the dry side; because of the mayo addition I also doubled the mustard and pickle juice. I added a 1/2 tsp of both salt and pepper as the original owner of the recipe suggested and it was still only OK. My kids didn’t like it and it was supposed to be their supper for tonight.

Delicious! Made as written the first time but the second time added some flare. Chopped green pepper, chopped red onion, garlic powder, dried dill and used a bit of light ranch dressing in addition to the mayo. It was amazing. Definitely my go to from now on!

Good combination of flavors, I added the optional celery and finely chopped yellow onion and garnished with chopped tomatoes. Only drawback was too much pasta for only one can of tuna and I ended up adding a second can. Next time would only use 8 oz macaroni and plan on using two cans of tuna. Really liked the pickles and cheese together. Thanks!

Wow! I made this on a whim as it looked pretty interesting, especially since it contains pickles (I always add pickle relish to my tuna). I brought it in to work, thinking I would have plenty for the week. Wrong! Everyone LOVED it. I brought it on Monday, by Tuesday afternoon it was gone, with everyone asking for the recipe. I followed the directions exactly, as I always do when making something for the first time. I would not change a thing. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I make this every summer and just sprinkle in some season salt and about a tbs of the pickle juice for taste I've never added the mustard or cheese (I'll have to try that next time) and it's a huge hit.. this is a family favorite in our house!

Good recipe.  Had to change a couple things. Added olives, more pickles, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and a little seasoning salt. I omitted the cheese, for cost reasons. I also used rice noodles various kinds, and ate it warm (rice noodles gross cold). I also doubled the recipe.  Good flavor without additives, great with.

I am not a big fan of tuna, but love dill pickels. The flavors all came together in this salad and I actually really liked this dish. Very good.

This was awesome! Doubled the recipe because I used a whole box of elbow macaroni. I did add a chopped up sweet onion, and I didn't do all of the mayo that was called for but probably will the next time because the noodles really soak it up.  I love pickles so I cut up at least 8 Claussen Mini Dills and I did put extra pickle juice in.  I used a full 8 ounce block of Colby Jack Cheese (it calls for 6 ounces for 8 ounces of pasta) but this was plenty! I also added a touch of garlic powder as well.......really tasty and will definitely do it again!!

I really liked this recipe.  Followed it exactly the first time (as I wish people would before writing a review!!) and it was delicious!  

The second time I made a few minor adjustments, added a little dill and went with green olives since they're my weakness, loved it that way too!  

I like this recipe's emphasis on sour rather than the usual tuna mac that uses sweet relish.  Don't like that at all.

This is very similar to my mom's version of pasta salad! (Just add carrots!)

I'm a big fan of tuna pasta salad, I did half light mayo/half light ranch. Added green olives, white onion, pepper, garlic salt. Went light on the cheese, shredded colby jack, the pickles were a great flavor. Will do again

Very good!! I added lots of cheese, 1/2 of that pepper jack, just to add some extra flavor. Super good and easy to make. It is even good warm!

Great & easy receipe that everyone loved on my most recent camping trip.  I used lowfat ranch instead of mayo and the pickles were really good, I would have added more of them.  Yum!

This tuna pasta salad was so good.  I did make a few changes like adding sweet peas instead of pickles, added carrots and boiled egg for garnishment.  I highly reccommend for a hot summer day.
