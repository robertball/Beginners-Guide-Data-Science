I had trouble hollowing out the onions so that they would still have solid bottoms, so I ended up cutting a thin slice off the bottom and pushing the center out.  Since I was baking them instead of grilling (no grill) it ended up working fine, I just had some of the liquid leak out into the baking dish. (BTW, I baked them for fifty minutes at 350 degrees, and they came out wonderfully, for the others that don't have a grill.)
