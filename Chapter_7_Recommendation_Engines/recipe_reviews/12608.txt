I don't know about this recipe.... The only reason I gave it any stars was because It didn't taste bad.  If you decide to make this make sure you make it in a large pot with a very tight fitting lid... I didn't and the liquid boiled over through the lid and made a horrible mess on my stove top.  I didn't make the nutmeg sauce because it was very liquidy already.... basically what I got was a liquidy apple mush with dumpling things inside. I wont be making this again.

Otstanding.  We used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg (personal preference), and we weren't disappointed.

I tried this recipe tonight with a few revisions.  Instead of making the dumplings, I cut refrigerator biscuits into quarters, and cooked it for 20 minutes instead of 30.  We don't care for so much nutmeg, so I substituted mostly cinnamon, with a bit of nutmeg in the sauce.  It was delicious!  Perfect with a scoop of ice cream.  It was plenty sweet without the sauce.

This is a really terrific dessert, and the nutmeg sauce really adds to the flavor.  I have been looking for a recipe for NUTMEG SAUCE for close to 45 years. My mother and grandmother used to make it for all of the apple dishes that they prepared.  My mother passed in 1958, and my grandmother in 1960.  With them passed the recipe.  I understand that this was Louisa May Alcott's favorite dessert. I know it's one of mine.  GaysloveJesus2  Richmond, VA

Fast and simple and delicious. For the complainers, if you don't like nutmeg, why would you make a sauce with it?? This was a wondful warm and quick dessert. Great with vanilla ice cream.

I love this recipe.  It reminds of my childhood.  My mom made something very similar except it was baked in the oven without the lid.  The dough had a lilttle shortening in it too.  The sauce was almost the same except she added a little splash of vanilla, lemon extract and vinegar!  The recipe card I have doesn't list the amounts and I think I like it alot better with the lemon.  Thank you for the recipe!

I used frozen apples.  It worked like a charm.  I didn't make the nutmeg sauce.  We were satisfied with the results.  It served the purpose of being a sweet dessert which is what I wanted, and it was quicker than a cobbler for me.  I plan to make it again.  It didn't take me 1 1/2 hours to make this like the recipe said.  It probably took about 35 minutes total.

This was really good for what I had on hand.  I had apples but no oats or pie crust (don't make my own) or tapioca.  I added a dash of cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg to the batter and I mixed the apples into the batter. Tasty
