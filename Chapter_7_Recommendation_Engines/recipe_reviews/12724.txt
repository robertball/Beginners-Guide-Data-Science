I found 12 oz frozen spinch souffle by Stouffers but couldn't find cream of shrimp soup so I used frozen shrimp bisque. Served it for a dinner party and there was not a bite left! So easy to do and delicious, too!

When I first tried this recipe I E-mailed the staff to let them know how awesome it was.  My entire family, including a 12 year old LOVED it.  The next time I made it I served it to company and it was a hit.  Lili Osborne

It was extremely flavorful and was a lighter dish than I had expected. My mother was over for dinner and just praised it up and down. I could not find any of the spinach souflet so I used frozen creamed spinach.

Very good and easy to make. There were no leftovers. I could not find cream of shrimp, so I used canned crab bisque.

I do not believe in rating the original dish with less than five stars if you make substitutions. I gave this five, and would have gone higher, because I had to substitute Swai for the Sole. First time we'd ever had Swai but we live in a very remote area and choices are quite limited. Even w/the Swai, a delicious, delicate filet, it was phenomenal! Didn't change another thing. Thank you for making me look accomplished in the kitchen!

This turns out looking like a restaurant dish!  It's very pretty when served.  I couldn't find spinach souffle so I used frozen creamed spinach cut up in pieces.  Very easy and quick to prepare.  Although my kids didn't eat large quantities they did eat it.  I will probably make again.

While this dish tasted good, it was a huge mess. The spinach souffle paired with the condensed soup ran all over the dish making it impossible to serve nicely.

This is not my style of cooking really.  A little too heavy American with the can of soup, frozen souffle and cheese.  Still this dish has good flavor even though its terribly unhealthy for you.    I couldn't find the frozen souffle so used my own spinach concoction.  My husband laughed at this dish but liked it as I did.  To be honest I probably won't make it much.  I like my fish more simple.

I made this with frozen flounder fillets, and used cut up regular shrimp instead of salad shrimp.
Absolutely outstanding!!  I am serving it for the get-together next weekend!!
