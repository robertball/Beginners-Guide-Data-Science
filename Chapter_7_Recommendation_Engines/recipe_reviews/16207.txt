This was a very good recipe but I made some changes. First I cooked the chicken in a smaller dish, cooked the thick cut bacon for three minutes in microwave before topping the chix and finally broiled the chix and bacon for 2 minutes at end. It was a beautiful golden brown. Nobody likes limp bacon. You must add flour to the drippings or it will be extremely greasy. Add as much flour as needed to soak up grease and don't take out the mushrooms. Add more heavy cream to make sauce. You want extra of this sauce!! This makes a wonderful sauce and I am an expert gravy maker.

Oh goodness, this recipe is great!  Very little prep work for such a great entree!  I cut off the bone in the breast before cooking because I don't like having to do it while I'm eating.  (I still left the skin on too keep the chicken moist.)

Also, I'm actually a little health concious (trying to cut the fat where I can without sacrificing taste).  I used PAM spray instead of the 2 tablespoons of butter.  It didn't effect the taste at all.  I used a teaspoon of seasoning salt and 1 clove of garlic for EACH chicken breast to give it more flavor.

I cooked for about 30 minutes in the oven instead of the 45-60 as recommended.  Then I brushed off the mushrooms off the chicken to the sides of the dish and placed under a broiler for 5 more minutes (to crisp the skin and bacon).  I also added a little bit of cornstarch/water slurry to the sauce after I added the cream to help the thicken the sauce.  But it came out wonderfully after a little bit of tweaking.  Definitely a keeper!

I used skinless boneless breasts and the family really enjoyed this dish.  The sauce at the end is a must, do not skip that part of the recipe.

Easy and delicious.  Sauce was too runny, next time I'll thicken it with a bit of cornstarch.

Because I had previously tried a butter chicken recipe and found it to be bland, I marinated this chicken with a lemon pepper marinate about 2 hours prior to cooking.  I used Mrs. Dash with Garlic as the seasoning and rubbed black pepper on the bacon. I used a full 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms and sprinkled the entire dish with a little mozarella cheese about 10 minutes before removing from the oven.  This was the best dish I've tried thus far and it's going in my recipe book!

Absolutely excellent!  We served it with pasta, which is great with the sauce.  More changes I made -- I pre-cooked the bacon to get it crispy, doubled the mushrooms, and used 3/4 or 1 cup of cream to make more sauce.  Also, I included the mushrooms in the sauce while cooking and crumbled the bacon into the sauce once it was thick.  You most definitely want to make enough sauce to go around -- it's wonderful!

This was very quick to prepare and easy to make.  Best of all you can make it with things you already have on hand.  I did use 1/3 cup half and half, 1/3 cup whole milk and 1-1/2 tablespoon flour to replace the cream.  I also put the mushrooms and bacon in with the drippings to make the sauce.  

I was in a hurry to get the chicken done so I upped the temp to 375 and placed foil over the top of the pan after baking the chicken for 20 minutes.

This was delicious!  And very easy to make!  My husband worked outside all afternoon chopping & splitting the wood from the tree that fell on our house a few weeks ago so I knew he'd be hungry.  The smell of this cooking in the oven was fabulous - what doesn't smell and taste great with bacon??!!  I seemed to have quite a few drippings in the pan, so I added a bit more cream and made some gravy to go on mashed potatoes.  We will be having this again!

Absolutely delicious, decadent entree!  Since it uses cream, it's only a once in a blue moon meal, but oh....!  Anything that tastes this good usually takes a lot more prep, but this is so quick & easy.  The only change I made the second time I made this was to switch to boneless breasts & I also doubled the recipe because it's even better warmed over the next day.  Also added a bit more seasoning salt & pepper to the sauce.  The mushroom flavor really comes out, so that's a big plus in our book.  Also, the fact that I can substitute fat-free half & half for the cream to make a healthier version is great. Just a bit of thickening agent to make it thicker & it's perfect!

This was excellent and the kids loved it. I precooked the bacon strips about halfway before laying them on the chicken, thus reducing the grease content of the sauce. I doubled the sauce and served it over egg noodles. The chicken breasts I used were boneless and skinless and turned out flavorful and moist. I diced the leftover chicken and used it for chicken salad. Very good!

2 1 12 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16207/bacon-mushroom-chicken/ ... OH EM GEE! This is GEE OH OH DEE! (Sorry, I usually don't do that ;D)! What a surprising dish! I "steamlined " this baby - with leftovers. I had leftover (sliced) chicken parmesan (not the sauce, just the chicken breaded with parmesan). It was from My Mom's Parmesan Chicken - ChristyJ (I changed it some & that's in the review btw). I had enough chicken for FOUR (this recipe is for two) servings. 'Heated that up in a T butter & a T olive oil with a, just one, teaspoon seasoning salt. Two seemed way too much for four servings. I sauteed two mini portabellos & 2 cloves garlic in a T butter the day before. Added two tablespoons cooked crumbled bacon & refrigerated it. When the chicken was almost heated, I added the mushrooms. A minute later added the cream, which was actually half cream, half 2% milk. It didn't need thickening & I don't think it was because of the chicken. I just think there was so little of it, the heat took care of thickening. No baking! Love that! Very fancy tasting dish - & I love fancytasting food. 'Think I'll use 1T bacon next time. It was kinda salty & I'm thinking it wasn't the seasoning salt teaspoon. Maybe just needed more chicken. :? :) If I'm not feeding the kids with this one next time, I'll add a T or two of wine with the cream. Mmmm! 'Probably add more cream/milk, too. OH, both kids, 12 & 14, ate it. Wow. 'Said to do without the shrooms next time.  Okay.  :)

This was very yummy, my husband loved it. The only thing I did different was to use boneless, skinless chicken breast and put the mushrooms on the chicken first, then cut the bacon in half and layed it width wise over the mushrooms and secured to chicken with wood toothpicks soaked in water. Kept everything together and the bacon was nice and crisp. Just remember to remove the toothpicks from the chicken before serving. Came out moist and delish. Loved the sauce.

This was the BEST thing I have ever cooked!  I used boneless/skinless chicken, so it only took me 40 minutes to cook.  I sliced the garlic rather than crushing it, and it still tasted great!  I also added just a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce just a tiny bit.  I served it with Garlic & Butter Rice, and with thick slices of French bread.  The bread sopped up the sauce wonderfully.  I can't wait to make this recipe again.

WOWSER! After reading reviews here, I made some helpful changes and this was delicious though fattening. I sprayed the pan with Pam instead of butter. I used one garlic clove per boneless, skinless chicken breast and topped it with 2 slices precooked Hormel/Kirkland bacon which means less grease and no rubbery bacon. (I buy it at Costco & it's all I ever buy anymore. Great stuff & it keeps a very long time in the frig.) I also baked only 30 minutes since I was using boned and skinned chicken breast. I would suggest doubling the mushrooms (I used baby portabellos) and I did use 1 cup of heavy cream and if you are doing more breast, you could use a pint. Next time I will use 1/2 & 1/2. I served it with butternut squash ravioli and a salad and bread. Decadent. This will go into my rotation. Thanks so much. mmmmmmm

This was really good.  A few things I'll change next time: 1. I was afraid of the bacon burning so I only pre-cooked bacon a little bit before putting it on the chicken. Next time I'll cook all the way before I put it on the chicken to make it more crispy. 2. I'll use a little less season salt. Chicken was a little too salty for my taste...even after using the advice of precooking the bacon to get the grease and some salt off. 3.  Add cornstarch to the gravy. It was extreemly thin and runny.  I would have liked a thicker gravy. 4. Add more mushrooms. I put on fresh mushrooms so it looked like the chicken was covered in them, but as soon as they started to cook, they shrunk up and there was hardly any on there. I would have doubled the mushrooms just becuase I like them so much! Over all, I did really like this recipe and will definitely make it again using my revisions.

I used this recipe as a base to create my own sauce and it turned out wonderfully. I pan sauted my chicken breasts and made the sauce seperately with pancetta bacon, shallots and mushrooms in heavy cream.

This was very good~ But I did make a few alterations, I doubled the recipe to make 4 chicken breast, used Garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, 5 slices of bacon layed over the chicken, 2 cans button mushrooms, a whole pint of heavy cream (we loved the gravy). For the gravy I thickened it by using a table spoon of flour at a time while wisking until it got to my desired thickness. Added minced up bacon to the gravy, salt and pepper to taste. My husband said he wasn't hungry then seen the plate I had prepared for him and instantly started eating! We really enjoyed this and will make it again~ with more BACON!!!

My chicken did not look at all like the picture! I thought it was going to be chicken with a thick creamy sauce. I used half and half, but that has never been a problem in other recipes. But, my chicken made very little sauce reguardless and it was: greasy, salty, and thin. The bacon also never crisped up and was soggy. I served it with rice and that was good with a little of the sauce. The chicken was also too salty and bacony to use in other recipes which I thought to do to save it. This just did not work for me.

This was fabulous and a huge hit with my husband.  I added some basil and white cooking wine to the bottom of the pan before putting it in the oven.  The smell was wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Will make it again for sure.

This recipe is a little bland for my family.  Maybe if the sauce had some seasoning to it.  Also, the bacon comes out looking raw and undercooked.

Great taste.  I needed it to be quicker so I altered the recipe to be cooked on the stove top.  This is what I did:  After cooking the bacon in the skillet, I cooked cut up skinless, boneless chicken breast in the bacon grease along with the garlic and half the seasoned salt, adding canned mushrooms near the end.  I had leftover spaghetti noodles so I had those heating up in a 9X13 pan sprayed with cooking spray in the oven while the chicken was cooking.  When the chicken was done, I used a slotted spoon to spoon it onto the noodles.  Since I didn't have cream I used evaporated milk which I mixed with the pan juices (scraping the tasty bits of chicken and bacon from the bottom of the skillet).  I poured the liquid over the chicken and returned it to the oven for about 5-10 minutes at which time my husband walked in the door and said, "Mmm, something smells good."  That doesn't happen very often (which speaks more about my cooking than it does about my husband).  He said he liked the chicken very much.  At least that's what I took his mumblings between bites to mean.  Even the children ate this adult-tasting meal. Thanks for coming to my rescue.

This was delicious! I chopped the bacon into 1" squares instead of using strips, and I made a white sauce with the drippings, flour and milk instead of using cream. It was wonderful!

I loved this recipe. Easy to make with whatever you have on hand. I used asparagus instead of the mushrooms, and homogenised milk with a tsp of cornstarch instead of the heavy cream. It was gobbled up by the family before it had a chance to even get cold. I do recommend pre-cooking the bacon a bit and adding the drippings. I may also use only 1/2 the salt next time. Try this recipe regardless, you will NOT be disappointed.

This recipe is not as good as I was expecting. The sauce is really just a mushroom gravy. It has good flavor, but a lot of grease floating around the plate. Not the greatest presentation there. The chicken was not very tender either. I will probably not make this again unless I'm needing a good mushroon gravy. For a baked chicken dish, try Amy's Garlic Egg Chicken instead!

My husband made this all on the stove-top with a few alterations to use what we had on hand, and it turned out wonderfully!  Used boneless-skinless chicken breast, cooked with 1T butter, garlic, bacon bits, and canned mushrooms; set the chicken aside, put the drippings in the saucepan with 1T more butter and cream, and added a bit of flour to thicken it up at the end.  Served over fettuccine, it was incredible!!!

This was great, my husband loved it.  I did a few things different though.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and 5 slices of bacon instead of 3.  Once I took the chicken out of the oven, I cut up the bacon and cooked it in the skillet until it was crispy.  I removed the bacon and cooked a tablespoon of flour in the bacon grease and then added the jucies from the chicken and wisked it into the flour.  Then I added the cream, which was about a half a cup.  I also cut up the chicken into smaller pieces.  It was good with spaghetti, we loved the smokey, bacon flavor.  I would have liked more sauce so next time I think I will add some chicken broth. Thanks!

This was GREAT, but we did make some changes to it.First I marinated boneless skinless breasts in white wine, garlic, and pepper for a few hours. Then I cooked the bacon for a little bit. Using the grease from the bacon, I sauteed garlic, onions, and triple the mushrooms. Placed the marinated chicken in a dish and covered with the mushroom mixture. I baked at 325 for 35 minutes. For the sauce I used the drippings from the pan and used triple the amount of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of white wine.Simmered and thickened with a little cornstarch. Served over bow tie pasta.

Fantastic..! I changed the recipe slightly though as i soaked the chicken breasts(skinless) in white wine for a n hour or so then pan fried them partially in the wine, garlic, salt, black pepper & garlic. I used single cream instead for the sauce & used flour to thicken. Really tasty result & will definatley make again.

Made this last night with a few substitutions. Used 4 boneless,skinless chicken breasts & turkey bacon. I cooked the bacon a little bit before I put it on top the chicken. I also chopped up about 1/2 of a large onion and threw that on the bottom of the baking dish, layered the rest of the ingredients on top. I threw the butter in the same pan i cooked the bacon in, scraped up the yummy bits, added the mushrooms to that pan. Then I transferred bacon to baking dish. Overally- WONDERFUL FLAVOR COMBINATION!!! Will make again.

This is a very easy dish to prepare.  I did cook the bacon a bit like other reviewers suggested.  I will admit though, there really wasn't that much flavor.  I did think that it would be more flavorful.  Thanks for the post.

I thought the flavor of this recipe was really good, but it was a bit greasy. My husband didn't care for it at all...but he is pretty picky.  I will probably make again, but will try to find a way to make it less greasy next time.

This was pretty good.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting something better.  It definitely did not make enough much cream sauce.  I would also add cheese and cook the bacon first.

I have made it at least 5 times by now and it is very easy.  It comes out very juicy and flavorful.  I use the alternative to the heavy cream (water & flour) and it doesn't change the flavor.  I also add more mushrooms since we are mushroom lovers!

My husband couldn't stop raving about this meal (I liked it too - very easy to make).  I will definately be making this more often.  I did add more mushrooms just because we can't get enough of them in our house and I reduced the juices and added some butter (since it is high in fat anyway why not spurge some more). Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was easy and delicious!  The flavor of the chicken and the gravy is amazing.  The bacon should be cooked a bit before putting on top of the chicken, or left out altogether if you like.  A new favorite!

Yuuuuum!  Hubby and I loved this recipie.  I'm finding that all of the 5 star chicken recipies on this site are awesome (especially the Chicken Jerusalem II). Go on, get cooking! **5/7/01 UPDATE - Made this again and I substituted prosciutto for the bacon (since that's what I had available) and it was even BETTER (hard to imagine but true!)  The sauce had incredible flavor and I served the chicken over rice.

Not a fan. I'm not afraid of dietary fat, in fact I was impressed the recipe called for bone-in chicken with the skin instead of lifeless, boneless skinless chicken breasts. But this was too much fat. It's just fat on fat on fat with no herbs/spices or acid to counter balance all the fat. Maybe use a balsamic or white wine reduction instead of the cream sauce. Serve with some sauteed greens.

Delicious! I chopped the bacon and used the mushrooms in the cream sauce. I did add a bit of flour also with the heavy whipping cream and it turned out perfect. I also used chicken thighs instead of the breasts and they were very moist and easy to debone for serving. 
So glad I came across this recipe!

We loved this! With just a few changes of course. I left out the butter and used PAM as another reviewer suggested. I used boneless chicken breasts w/o skin. I used dried garlic instead of fresh and quite a bit more mushrooms. I followed another reviewers advice and took the bacon off of the chicken to crisp more for the last 10 min. Since several reviewers mentioned the sauce being too runny I prepared the sauce with the mushrooms so I wouldn't have to add flour or other thickening agent. NOT enough sauce...next time I may double the sauce ingredients. We will definitely be making this again!!

Wonderful would be my first word and fattening would be my second.  If you're in the mood to eat like a glutton and enjoy life for a day this is the meal for you.    Seriously, though.  It's incredible.  My entire family loved it and asked for 2nd's.  It was easy to make and good enough for company.    Only change I made was double the sauce and pre-cooked the bacon before putting on top of chicken.  To me, both are necessary or you'd simply have a greasy mess on your plate.  All in all....Five Stars!

Very good. Added extra bacon (2 per breast-microwaved bacon till crispy) and used portobello mushrooms. Served with rice and steamed broccoli.

Came out great!!! After reading reviews I used boneless chicken breast and to crisp bacon I removed from butter and mushrooms (I also added some onions) and broiled until brown.. Also I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken the sauce.. came out fantastic!!!!

YUMMY!  My two year old started to eat his chicken and noodles before I could get everyone else's plates down. I used boneless/skinless chicken breast just because that's what I had; and it cuts down on the calories and fat...but it also cuts down on the sauce:(  I made the sauce right in the 9X13 pan and used evaporated milk (that's just what I had) because there wasn't much drippings, and then pour it over some egg noodles. Very good!

My b/f said this was "fabulous!".  I used 4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves and doubled the recipe. I almost decided to use cream of mushroom soup instead of the sauce but decided to go ahead and make the sauce as directed (adding a little flour for thickening).  I'm glad I made the sauce...it was wonderful! I also removed the mushrooms and broiled the chicken a few minutes to crisp up the bacon, then returned the mushrooms to the chicken before adding the sauce.   Delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

I used boneless chicken breast, which came out very tender.  I also cooked the bacon after baking the dish, so it would be crispy.  The sauce did not make as much as the picture looks, so next time I will make more sauce.  Very tasty dish!

This was amazing!! Such an easy and elegant dish. The only change that I made was I sauteed a few onions and mushrooms and put them in the sauce, it just added another layer of flavor. I think that next time I will finish the bacon after the chicken is done. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is one of the best chicken recipe ever...my husband loved the mushroom bacon combo!!  My whole family and I couldn't get enough of it.  Though next time I think I have to triple or even quadruple the gravy/cream recipe, coz it just wasn't enough otherwise.  Though I used the 1 teaspoon flour mixed with 2 teaspoons water instead of the heavy cream...because I didn't have any..like I said it was good and I just needed to make more :>)  The things that I changed from the recipe is, I used boneless, chicken breasts and I used seasoned salt on both sides then I browned them in a skillet first, that way I cut down on the time in the oven.  Also since I didn't have any other bacon, I used Hormel Real Bacon Pieces.  You wouldn't of known the difference.. everything was delicious!!!  I made white rice, green beans and French Breadsticks with this chicken and WOW  what a meal!!! This recipe is most definately a keeper and thanks sooo much for sharing :>)

Great dish! I marinated my boneless skinless breasts in italian dressing and a little teriyaki overnite, which i think added some flavor to the chicken. I did everything almost the same, its a very greasy dish, but the flavor was so awesome, it was worth it. Next time i will cut up the bacon, cook it first again, and try to cut down on the greases somehow. All in all, very good!

I was pleasantly suprised by this recipe.  You wouldn't think that with so few ingredients, this would have so much flavor!  I doubled the bacon and used boneless, skinless chicken, but besides that, I followed the recipe.  The mushrooms didn't look very pretty like another review said, but they still tasted wonderful!  I will definately make this one again.

I made this last nite and turned out very good. I doubled the recipe so I could have leftovers, but that didn't happen. I also sliced half a yellow onion on bottom. Next time I will layer the mushrooms first, then the onion, chicken then the bacon. Because the mushroom's turned dark too quick. I will be making this again.

I give this a 5 because it can be adapted so many ways.  I needed a quick menu, saw the ingredients and read other reviewers comments.  I had two rather small chicken breasts to prepare in a hurry - I ended up cooking 4 slices of bacon, put that aside and cooked the chicken in the bacon grease, put that aside (drained both the bacon and chicken on a paper towel), added 1/2 small onion - chopped - 1 small can of mushrooms, added some black pepper and thyme, cooked about 2 min. - added 1/2 cup of cream - when it thickened - added back crumbled bacon and chicken to warm up.  Served it over egg noodles that were cooking while preparing the chicken.

I decided last minute to make this recipe for a diner party of 8 and it was out of this world.  Everyone loved it and I gave out the recipe twice.  I highly recommend this dish.  One note though I made it with boneless skinless chicken breast and the meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

Outstanding!  I read the reviews and also added some flour to the drippings before I added the cream.  Without the flour, it would be a great Atkins/ Low Carb recipe!

Flavorful and moist, this is a winner.  My sauce didn't turn out (seemed to want to stay separated), but it was still fabulous.  Next time I'd probably add more mushrooms, but only because we're big mushroom fans.  Also didn't need to cook as long as the recipe stated.

I used diced mushrooms.  I liked it and i hate mushrooms.  Hubby loved it.  I made it once with heavy cream, once with flour and water.  Both times it was good, but the cream made it richer and better in my(hubby didnt really notice) opinion.  also i used store bought bacon bits(the softer kind in the resealible package) next time i will like to try real bacon.  Excellent.

This was sooooooo good!!!  I couldn't stop raving about this chicken while we were eating dinner!  I did use soy margarine since my son's allergic to cow's milk, and it was still great!  I did use the flour and water to thicken the gravy and added crumbled sauteed bacon to the gravy.  I am going to try the real bacon bits to speed up the recipe for the gravy and drain some of the oil from the chicken before adding to the gravy.  Other than that, this is an awesome chicken dish!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe-even those who didn't like mushrooms.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful. The sauce with cream was too rich for me so I will take your advice and use the flour technique next time.

It was delicious. If you're in a time crunch, rock the oven at 375 for about 35-40 minutes and the chicken is so amazing and moist! Yum!

As is, 4 stars. Was good, but too bland for our tastes, and a bit too time consuming. SO, I just made it again, but this time I used boneless chicken, sliced into even and large bite sized pieces. I seasoned it with smoked chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Fried the bacon, removed, added a little butter to the bacon drippings and sauteed/fried up the chicken. Added some mushrooms and cooked until done. Removed chicken and mushrooms and set aside with bacon. Added cream to pan drippings, cooked down a bit. Added meats and mushrooms back to pan to reheat and voila! Took it from 4 to 5 stars.

This dish is AWESOME! My husband and I absolutely loved it. We put it over some leftover rice from the other night and what didn't end up being dinner ended up being his lunch today. I doubled the amount of bacon for two reasons: I'm a stereotypical-bacon-loving-American and it bothered me that the chicken wasn't covered by the bacon.
Anyways, awesome dish and I'm sure I will be making it often in the future. The only thing is that I didn't wait long enough for the sauce to thicken and I also didn't have a whisk, which really hindered that but the soupy sauce was still delicious.

I didn't want to wait for this, so I did the sauce with more butter and added flour and better than bouillon chicken flavored. I used already cooked bacon, diced chicken breast uncooked and mushrooms. I cooked the noodles while the chicken finished cooking on the stove. Yum.

I tried this recipe as is, then tried it again changing it slightly. I give the recipe as is 3 stars.
The 2nd time I tried this, I used boneless skinless chicken breast and I cooked the bacon separately on stove top in a frying pan. Added the bacon bacon drippings to a small pot, along with the chicken drippings and make the sauce that way, adding in the mushrooms and chopped bacon. I would give this way 5 stars, very delicious.

Big hit with my family!  The only thing I did differently was doubled the sauce, but I probably didn't even need to do that.

Delicious recipe. The flavor is wonderful. I followed the recipe but the only thing I did different is add cornstarch to the sauce because no matter how much I whipped the heavy cream with the juice, it didn't get thick. Other than that I am happy. I would make this again.

Fantastic Recipe! I used boneless chicken and it was fabulous, my boyfriend and I just loved it. I baked the bacon first by its self to rid it of some of the grease, and when I made the sauce I poured it over egg noodles, the sauce is a must!!

This was incredible! Especially for how easy it is! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added more mushrooms because my husband loves them. I also added flour to my drippings before adding the cream and then used cornstarch to help thicken the sauce -used around a half cup of cream. The sauce was great with mashed potatoes too.  SO good!

I don't like chicken but my family does. I searched for some chicken recipes that I thought I might like and came across this one. I LOVED it. I added a little more mushrooms than the recipes calls for (we love mushrooms) and did have to add flour and corn starch to the sauce to make it thicker but other than that I didn't change a thing! Great recipe!

Very good and easy recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I added cheese on top, I used mozzerelle slices but I think provolone would be good.  Also I didn't have heavy cream so I just made a regular gravy using the juices and flour

I thought this was great, but a little heavy.  I followed other reviewers advice to cook the bacon before putting over the chicken to make it crisp and cut the grease way down.  I also added a little chicken broth in the bottom of the pan.  I used more cream in the sauce and added just a little flour to thicken and served over egg noodles.  Will definitely make again!

My picky husband loved this!  And it was so easy to make!  I used 4 boneless chicken breasts, doubled everything else except the garlic (I used 4 cloves) and the heavy cream (I used 1 cup).  I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave for 3 minutes, as another reviewer suggested.  I also crumbled up the bacon and added it to the sauce.  I thickened the sauce with 1 Tbsp of corn starch.  My husband wants me to make more sauce next time and serve the chicken cut in bite size pieces over noodles.  This will definitely be a regular meal in our house!

Yummy, this one is definitely a keeper!  I used chicken thighs and seasoned it with the seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper and I also added an onion with the mushrooms.  I didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I substituted with 3/4c of milk and 1/3c of butter which equals 1c of heavy cream and then measured out 1/4 of that for the gravy.  Too tired to do the math!  Worth all the trouble though!

This was excellent!  I used more mushrooms than called for and also boneless, skinless breasts so I cut down on the cook time.  I didn't pre cook the bacon at all, I wanted all the bacon grease:)  But when it was finished cooking I crisped up the bacon in the microwave and crumled it on top.  I also added some flour to the pan drippings to thicken up the sauce after reading other reviews.  We ate it over spaghetti noodles and it was absolutely DELISH!

I did not do well with this recipe.  My sauce turned into a clumped mess.  That was fine, we just ate it without, but I felt the chicken was way too salty.  Not my taste.

Can't say anything bad about this recipe, delicious enough to think you'd find it in a restaurant.  Only thing I changed was to add just a little bit of chopped green onions/chived at the very end.

This was delicious.  The only changes I made were for lowering the fat -- skinless boneless, and used fat free half and half with a little flour instead of heavy cream.  Used one tsp. of melted butter with a little oil spray for 4 breasts.  Added more mushrooms and garlic as other reviews stated.  We loved this one.  Smells great while cooking, and couldn't be easier.  With these modifications it's not that unhealthy, and tastes very decadent.

Outstanding. Very easy but tastes gourmet. I used boneless breasts. I followed the suggestion someone posted to broil them a bit at the end of the baking process which I think made them visually look better and infused them with a bit more bacon flavor. Next time I will add more mushrooms bc it seemed like we were fighting over the few in the dish.

This was a pretty good recipe. I used non-fat half and half and it worked well...I used a little flour and made a quick roux, splashed in a little vermouth for a little added richness. I think this would be even better with skinless, boneless. If I do it that way, I'll just saute the bacon and then the mushrooms and do everything stove top.

I made this recipe for my family. I had to increase the servings to 10. It was ok, not the best chicken I have had. The gravy was very difficult to thicken. Too much water from the mushrooms. Will not make again.

Made this last night.  Very delicious.  Will definately make it again.

Couple of changes:  Used five boneless and skinless thighs since me and my wife prefer dark meat.  Since I was using more chicken, I doubled the butter.  Probably put more garlic than the recipe called for, but that is always a good idea.  Served it over rice.  Sauce was delicious, but needed thickening.

Perfect recipe for a low carb diet. The sauce is a little runny but still tastes good. If you aren't concerned about the carbs, just use a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

This was very good. Chicken was very moist and the sauce made from the drippings was flavorful. I also liked the sauce on mashed potatoes.

Loved this recipe! I loved the ease of it! Followed it exactly, but for the sauce I used cornstarch & milk, rather than cream, as I didn't have any. It was really good, and my kids loved it! I also broiled the chicken after removing the juices, and it was perfect!

This recipe was easy enough but I found it to be a bit bland peraps using different spices to the chicken such as lemon or lime pepper would help

I made a variety of changes since I can't have dairy and to reduce the amount of fat.  First I sprayed the bottom of my pan with olive oil (one of those mister deals). Next I cooked the bacon separately and let it drain dry.  Instead of heavy cream (which I can't have) I used equal amount of rice milk and a bit of flour for thickening.  When the chicken was done, I added the mushrooms and garlic to the rice milk then added the bacon to warm it all up, and served it as a sauce on the side.  It turned out awesome. There was a bit of sauce left over because I doubled it. Had it on pasta today.

This was actually really good. I decided to give it a try even though the picture really threw me for a loop, but the ingredients sounded really good even though, it didn't look too tasty. I added some Parmesan and Romano cheese to the top really added to the flavor. My family really enjoyed this recipe.

Great recipe Thanks :) I took the advice of others and cooked the bacon first. I also added more mushrooms than the recipe calls for ( we love mushrooms) I also added flour to the sauce when to thicken it up to make it more of a gravy. I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

This was delicious.  Although, we didn't add the sauce over it.  I liked it just the same.  The combination of these items was wonderful!

this was an awesome dish. i loved the whole bacon/mushroom theme. i did a few modifications as other reviewers recommended, i pre-cooked the bacon and then i semi-cooked the chicken in it before baking it. i also used skinless boneless chicken breasts. i used emrils' seasoning salt along with minced garlic. also fresh mushrooms. it turned out great. i used half/half and a bit of flour to mix in with the drippings. it was great, my husband said it was really good. it is a keeper and i will defintely be making this again.

Excellent recipe!  One of my favorites when doing low-carb dieting!  Followed others suggestions to cook chicken first, as well as using milk thickened with corn starch/water.  Yummy!!

With a few modifications this turned out great.  I panfried the seasoned chicken in the bacon drippings, i used more bacon then called for - which I cooked before putting on the chicken, & I added some onions.  The sauce in this recipe is WONDERFUL & gives the chicken that extra punch - otherwise it was "just" chicken. All of my family gave it 5 stars but my oldest daughter only gave it 3 - saying that it was too plain for her liking - she didn't use the sauce!

This was great! I gave it a 5 star, the bf gave it 3, but I'm guessing it's only because of some changes I made to make it healthier...  I used boneless skinless breasts and sliced them in half lengthwise (only had to cook for 25-30 minutes that way), used regular milk with flour for the sauce, and turkey bacon. Chicken was moist, juicy, sauce was creamy and good, chicken had good flavor. Thanks!

I've had this recipe in my 'recipe box' for some time now and finally decided to try it.  Well....am I glad I did.  It was delicious.  The only changes I made were, I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh (didn't have any) and cut back on the amount of seasoned salt called for (SO has high BP).  After reading some of the other reviews I see where this great recipe has a lot of potential.  Thank you Sara for a great recipe.

Yum!  Tons of flavor.  I used boneless, skinless breasts and cooked for 40 min.  I also cooked the bacon and crumbled it over each piece.  I used a bit of extra cream and whisked in 1 tsp. flour to help the sauce thicken up.  Very delicious.

I make this with boneless chicken breast,season with salt free seasoning and use reg.bacon.I also omit butter and add some cheese on top for the last few minutes.It is a good low carb recipe.It is better if you brown chicken first also.

Pretty good, but the bacon was not completely cooked.  I would suggest cooking if half way and using the bacon fat instead of the butter for flavor.  My whole family enjoyed this recipie.

This was pretty good.  After reading the reviews, I did partially cook the bacon, removed the skin and all fatty parts of the chicken and it wasn't too greasy.  I also sprinkled the chicken with salt-free Cavender's Greek Seasoning to add more flavor.

My husband is on the Atkins diet and this is a pretty good recipe for it.  My only qualm was it was REALLY greasy.  The taste was a little bland too but a little more seasonings would fix that up.  But overall it was okay.  Thank you for sharing your recipe though.  Trying to find Carb friendly recipes is a bit hard.

Very tasty and easy. A little too greasy though. I pre-cooked bacon half way, and broiled the whole dish for about 10 minutes at the very end. Next time I will try boneless, skinless or trim a large portion of skin to reduce grease. Fresh mushrooms, flour and little more salt are needed.

I made this for my parents and we all loved it.  Usually we disagree on which new recipes sound good, but this one will be made again definitely.  I'd probably add more bacon and mushrooms, but that's what I like.  It's a keeper!

This recipe was easy to make and smelled wonderful while it was cooking. However, my boyfriend and I generally like very flavorful or spicy foods and this was just too bland for us both. The bacon flavor was not picked up by the chicken. Just too boring for us.

Very good.  My husband loved it too.  I used a turkey thigh deboned instead of chicken.  One thigh is plenty for 2 people.  I also used just 1 tablespoon of butter but doubled the cream for more gravy and thickened it with a tablespoon of flour.  Served it with rice.  Yum.

I did not expect this entree to taste as succulent and flavorful as it did.  I chose to cook the bacon first, and use some of the fat with half the butter called for.  Perfect!!!
Also, I had to use more cream to get enough sauce.  Excellent dish!!!!!!

I enjoyed this but it was a bit greasy I think.  I used 3 skinless bone-in chicken breasts and used 4 pieces of bacon.  I forgot to add the cream, so we didn't really have much of a "sauce" with it, but it was quite good just plain.

This was delicious and so simple.  I added twice the amount of mushrooms and it was perfect!  I also added a small "dab" of butter to the sauce reduction.  Very Very Good.  I will make this quite often.  If you have problems with your "gravy" seperating, turn your heat down or add an ice cube and stir while on low heat.  Your sauce will go back together

This chicken was amazing!!!  The sauce was incredible--very rich--but incredible.  Those individuals who complained about the sauce not thickening must not understand the concept of "reduction".  The recipe is flawless and delicious!!!  My boyfriend and I loved it! I will make this one again and again.  Thanks Sara for such a wonderful meal.

This is a keeper!  Don't have to mess with cooking the bacon first - a plus in my book!  Suggest put in upper 1/3rd of oven for the last 30 minutes to help cook the bacon more.  Most people seem to not like their bacon limp.  This would be great for valentine's dinner as it's taste rivals anything a restaurant puts out!!! My kids (5 yr., twins 22 mo. loved it!)

This was so yummy.  I upped the amount of mushrooms to 1 1/2 cups (we LOVE mushrooms).  I think next time I'll cook the bacon just a bit before putting it all in the oven.  But it was still great!  We served it with steamed rice and put some of the sauce over it.  MMMMMMM
Thanks!

I CANNOT COOk !!!!! So when I try to make a new dish, my husband cringes!  But this turned out wonderfully!! We loved it.  I usually don't cook w/ bone-in chicken, but will do more of it since the meat seemed to be moister than skinless-boneless pieces.  We definitely needed more gravy than the recipe called for, but other than that, this was delicious!!!!  Husband has requested me to make this for a family get-together w/ his mother!  WINNER HERE!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe! It was very garlicky which we loved but our picky children didn't seem too enthused! We both love mushrooms and liked the way they were quartered instead of the usual "sliced" it seemed to add even more flavor. This entree will definately have a permenant place in my recipe box!

This was a wonderful recipe.  A great hit with my mushroom loving fiance.  I admit I was not the greatest cook in the world but with all these tasty recipes, my fiance told me I have turned into a regular Betty Crocker.  Will definetly use again.

This was great! I used skinless chicken breasts to cut back fat, and the sauce still tasted good. I love mushrooms, so I added more and it was really tasty.

If your in the mood for a mouth watering, melt-in-your-mouth type of dish then this is the one for you.  I personally LOVED this recipe and my husband...Well, let's just say he's not a big mushroom fan.  He cleaned his plate and asked for seconds.  In other words, it's a great recipe even if your not too fond of mushrooms.  I did alter the recipe a bit. I browned the bacon a bit before placing them on the chicken breasts and I added the bacon drippings to the melted butter for added flavor.  Overall, this dish came out wonderfully.

I did as others suggested and made more sauce and had it with pasta.  The only bacon I had was maple bacon and this put it over the top.

Very heavy and greasy.  Flavor was good however I made some changes.  I pre-cooked the bacon and used that pan to make the sauce in.  I wasn't a fan of the sauce, I had to use way too much flour to "soak up" some of that grease and even then I wasn't too happy with it.  I think with some tweaking this recipe could be a great addition to my books.

I'm not much of  a cook, but this was pretty easy. I substituted and increased mushroom pieces (Green Giant) and pretty much  followed the recipe from there.
My only complaints: 
1- The sauce recipe doesn't yield enough sauce- tasted great but I will double it next time.
2- The bacon I used didn't  thoroughly cook in the oven- I had to finish in a pan before adding it to the sauce.
Overall, my wife (currently enduring the flu and my cooking) really liked it, and that's all that really matters. I will make it again!

This is an excellent BASE recipe.  
Like others, I modified this recipe with good results.
I already had slices of cooked chicken breast so I used it. 
I cooked and drained 1 lb bacon; then cooked cloves of minced garlic & slices of Bella mushrooms in 2T of the bacon drippings.  Layered in the baking pan slices of cooked chicken breast, half the bacon [crumbled], cooked mushroom/garlic and poured over the top a can of basic "white sauce" I found on sale at the grocery. Topped with other half of bacon crumbles and some thinly sliced green onions & dried parsley flakes for color.  Covered and baked 20 min at 350 degrees and then 10 min uncovered. Served over Whole Wheat egg noodles.

It was really tasty and easy to make. My hubby said it needed for bacon. I didn't have whipping cream so did the suggestion of water and flour. I did flour and broth but put more flour  than what was suggested because it was very runny.

Splendid! Followed recipe but chose chicken breasts.  With sauce, yes it does need a thickening flour/corn starch or arrowroot.  I need to remember more mushrooms next time . But daughters loved this.

I have made this before exactly as is and it was delicious! Today I had taken chicken breast out and thought I had all the ingredients but realized I used the cream earlier in the week. So I started to just bake the chicken...chalking it up to a baked chicken kind of night lol but then it dawned on me. I can go with the flow! I seasoned and baked the chicken breasts just as I normally would, but then in a pan I browned an entire package of bacon (chopped) yes it's terribly fattening...but oh well. I sautéed the mushrooms and garlic once the bacon was crisp and then drained all the fat. I intended to use milk and butter (a substitute for cream) and was going to make a gravy just to pour over the chicken, but I came across a pack of country gravy (the white kind) and whisked that into the pan with 2C water and then added about another cup or so of milk. Lots of cracked black pepper also. It was actually delicious! I cannot compare..and that wasn't my intention. It was just a matter of improvising. BUT as I said, both ways were great! Sometimes we can start a recipe and realize we are missing an ingredient or two...but all is not lost. I shredded the kids chicken breast and tossed it with egg noodles. Again, I know this is far from healthy, but not every meal has to be strict! I did serve steamed broccoli on the side to compensate my guilt!

This was delish! I modified a little bit. I used chicken thighs with skin. I also added chopped fresh parsley to the seasoning and some pepper. I precooked the bacon for a couple minutes before I layered onto the chicken and this ensured it would be crispy. I used a tiny bit of flour mixed into the heavy cream to thicken the gravy. The gravy was really good and worked well on rice. Very good recipe!

GOOD EASY FAST  we quite enjoyed. I followed recipe. Turned out well. I was concerned about bacon grease but it did mix well with cream  and turned out fine. Certainly  easy to put together.  I will definitely make again.

I made this for dinner last night and it was really delicious. I didn't add or omit any ingredients but I did increase the amounts of bacon, mushrooms and a little bit more cream. Because people complained about it being too oily, I removed the skin. After cooking, I put the sauce in an separator so the oil wouldn't get included in the cream sauce.

I did throw the chicken under the broiler to crisp the bacon, but I did everything else as directed. The kids loved it, as did the husband. We've had this more than once with great accolades from the family. Definitely a keeper.

Get some real chicken from a small local farm who raises real chickens outside like we all used to do. Aside from that, thanks for the simple recipe for busy people like me! I did use a whole chicken, seasoned and otherwise cooked like this and it is very good. I can't consume dairy so I made my sauce with flour and chicken stock, doubled, because I like sauce of just about any kind!

Awesome Recipe!!!  I used to skinless boneless chicken Breasts and they worked just fine!   I also didn't have any heavy cream so just looked up online on how to make heavy cream - simple fix.  Took no time to make and it was DELICIOUS!!!!  Definitely Recommend!!

Great gravy. I chopped some of the mushrooms up and put them in the gravy.  Would be really good with a roasted chicken.  Limp bacon, maybe stuff under skin to help flavor chicken(see next comment).  Chicken could do with different seasoning and maybe a little pan searing to help get the skin crispy.

Made this with a few alterations, and it is a great gravy! I changed from cream to milk with some flour as per the recommendations, and added a bell pepper and onion. I chopped up the bacon and added it to the gravy, and it was very flavorful. I used a cup instead of a quarter for the milk, and the gravy was great on pork chops the next day. Will definitely be making this again!

Flavor was great, if I make it again I will use boneless chicken - just a personal preference because I find it harder to eat off the bone.  My sauce never thickened for me, maybe I didn't cook it for long enough.  Because the flavor was really good and it was really easy to make I will try this one again.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe almost exact - used boneless chicken breasts and lots of fresh mushrooms.  Definitely worth the extra time to bake and make the sauce - served over egg noodles with mixed veggies.  A definite keeper and elegant enough for guests!!

This was really good.  I did double the mushrooms, but I used 3 boneless, skinless chx breasts instead of 2.  No way was I going to use a full tsp of season salt so I just sprinkled some on both sides of the chicken along with some onion powder.  Used 3 pcs bacon per breast and I partially cooked the bacon first.  Still had to broil it for a minute at the end to get the bacon good and crisp.  The sauce was really really good.  i used some cornstarch to thicken it up and I also added some fresh grated parm cheese to the sauce.  Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used Cheese filled tortelinni from Butoni instead of regular pasta, added a very cheesy texture that went well with the heavy cream. I also added some pepper to taste, made the sauce very robust.

Fantastic!  But, if you do not normally cook with salt, go light on the seasonings b/c it was very salty for my taste.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I chopped the mushrooms and used pre-cooked bacon and chopped it then topped the chicken.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe although I changed it a little.  I cut up the bacon, mushrooms and boneless skinless chicken into chunks.  I cooked the bacon to render some fat and then added the chicken.  when the chicken browned on one side, I gave it a stir and added the mushrooms.  Once the mushrooms carmelized and the chicken was cooked on the outside, I pushed it all to one side of the skillet and melted 3 tablespoons of butter and added 3 tablespoons of flour stirring quickly to make a roux.  I then stirred in the cream, a cup of chicken stock, and a few tablespoons of brandy for flavor.   I added some of Emerils seasoning, pepper, and salt to taste and cooked it until thick.  I served it over egg noodles and it was great!

I only had boneless skinless chicken breasts to use, so was wondering if I would have enough drippings to make the "gravy".  I used 3 slices of bacon for each piece of chicken and had plenty...added the mushrooms to the sauce before pouring over the chicken...a delicious and rather impressive entree.

I didnt like this at ALL....but my family liked it better than I did.  I would have given it a one star because I didnt like the smokey flavour the bacon gave the gravy....it seemed to overpower everything.  I think I focused on that flavour though....so it wrecked it for me.  I was disappointed.  Family gave it 3 stars.  I gave it one....averaged it out to a 2 star rating.  not for us, but MANY others did so it just must not be our families taste is all.

Really good and also really very easy!  I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts, so I reduced the time to probably about a half hour and then a few minutes with just the chicken and bacon under the broiler.  I added extra mushrooms, and added pepper.  To the pan drippings and mushrooms along with the cream I added some parmesan as well.  Will definitely revisit this dish!

This was pretty good! It was fairly simple to make, and both my husband AND my incredibly picky son both enjoyed and ate all of it! I made extra sauce as others suggested cuz I know my boys, they love their sauces. I didn't use cream, I used milk and flour and as other again suggested, I added the mushrooms to the sauce while making it. I also crumbled extra bacon into the sauce and because I had pre-cooked the bacon, I stirred in a tiny bit of the bacon grease and some extra season salt to the sauce to pump up the flavor. The hubby felt it still needed pepper...but he is a pepper-holic. Very good though...will make it again! Thanks!

Easy prep and good taste give this recipie 4 or 4 1/2 stars. The bacon on top is a bit of a problem because it comes out soft, as others mentioned.

We really enjoyed this!  I did make a lighter sauce by using 1% milk since I didn't have any cream and it was still wonderful.  Hubby doesn't get too excited about dinner but did ask for this to be made again.  Thanks!

Great little recipe and simple. It is the bacon that really makes the difference. I only use boneless chicken breasts but they work very well - just a little less oven. Thanks for submitting.

I doubled the mushrooms and added a little cornstarch/water mixture to thicken the sauce.  Served it over and rice and it was pretty good, I will probably make this one again in the future.

Absolutely adore this especially with rice or potatoes. Definitely a regular in my home. I use turkey bacon to ease on the fat and the substitution is not a bad one.

Very tasty, and made for a nice presentation.  Used microwavable bacon so that it would crisp up better. Also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream in the sauce and thickened with just a bit of cornstarch.

This was quite tasty. I had one chicken breast with just the sauce on it, and the second I mixed up with pasta. Both were good. This will also work on rice. The chick is so flavoured by the bacon and mushroom that is really takes on a nice flavour. Will make again!

Wow! Very tasty chicken recipe! Quick & easy to make. Even my husband who hates mushrooms loved this dish. The mushrooms seemed to just take on the taste of the juices and sauce. Definitely a favourite in our house!

Good, but next time I will definetly leave out the sauce and use pam instead of butter to cut some of the fat. The sauce to me wasn't appealing, it was very very greasy.

Delicious! The sauce was a bit runny for me too, but that's easily fixed with a bit of cornstarch.
I wish it was possible to make a healthier version, but that probably wouldn't taste as great ;)

This is a great recipe!  I've made two very minor alterations: 1. Instead of using slices of bacon, I replaced them with bacon chunks (or cut up pieces of bacon, not be confused with bacon bits) that you can purchase at Costco. 2. I will reduce the amount of seasoning salt to half the advertised amount to make it less salty. That being said, it didn't take long for my girlfriend and I to gobble up this wonderful, tasty dish. I will definitely prepare this again!

Thank You , this was so yummy!!! I doubled the mushrooms (I'm a mushroom lover) and added cornstarch like someone suggested and it was perfect.  My hubby can't wait to have it again!! I served with pasta with the sauce on top.

This recipe is the best!  I served it with angel hair pasta and steamed broccoli....great combination!  Next time I make it I will add cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce...mine came out runny.  I don't know if I just wasn't patient enough for it to thicken or what.  But either way it was still wonderful.  I will probably also add some chicken broth so we can have more sauce.  Thank for a great recipe!

This recipe was really good, and you  can use any chicken you have on hand...thighs,breasts,legs they'll all work. It does need a little more seasoning though, just add a little of your favorites! I also seared the chicken on the stove before baking to lock in the juices.

Great recipe.  The only recommendation I would have would be to saute the mushrooms in a little oil before baking them with the chicken to tenderize them  a bit.  One thing I did which I thought made the meal was to put some parmigiana cheese in the sauce, grate a sharp cheddar over the top, and serve it over penne.

BOyfirend LOVED it. I did up the half and half to 1/2 a cup and had to thicken with corn starch. I cooked the back before since it didn't get crispy on the chicken.

I gave it 5 for easy prep and taste.  It doubled the bacon and used fresh mushrooms.  Everyone was disappointed there wasn't more sauce.  I did not cover - next time I will.

This was very easy and quick to make. My husband really liked it. I added more bacon and garlic than it called for. But the sauce just wasn't thick enough-more like water. Next time I'm going to try cream of mushroom soup instead of the heavy cream.

I made this for dinner last night.  I thought it would be great after reading some of the reviews.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It was just  okay.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  I probably would not make this again.

Loved this, but did think the sauce was too salty.  Next time I'll cut back on the seasoning salt.  Also would double or triple the mushrooms.  Served over buttered & seasoned angel hair pasta.

This is the best chicken recipe.  The sauce can be a little too salty from the bacon drippings, so I like to cook the bacon half way on the stove top, pat dry and then place on top of chicken 40 minutes into cooking the chicken.  I use triple the heavy cream and if you're not concerned with carbs, wisk  abit of  flour in the sauce to thicken a little.  If you are on a low carb diet, you can't get a better meal than this.  The chicken comes out so tender and juicy, you could cut it with a fork.

Really good.  How could it not be!  It's got bacon on it for cryin' out loud.  My husband was sad that I didn't make more!  I had to use cream of mushroom for the sauce because I didn't have any mushrooms, but it was still really yummy.  I can't wait to try it with real mushrooms and cream.  Try this!  The chicken has an awesome flavor just by itself.  I served it with Oven Roasted potatoes from this site.

OH-YUM. This was realllly good and very impressive. Garlicky, buttery, and I think the sauce really completes it. For the sauce, I made sure to scape the bottom of the baking dish for all of the bits and pieces from the chicken, added a little bit more cream and also used a cornstarch/water mix to thicken it.

We didn't have mushrooms, so we used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  We figured this would add the heavier, creamer texture, which it did.  Served it atop a healthy dose of mashed potatoes....mmmm...good comfort food.

I love this recipe. Made it many times. I always add more garlic, mushrooms and cream because it is sooo good over the rice. Leftovers are great also.

This was delicious.  My family liked it.  I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, but could be because I cooked the mushrooms with the sauce?  So, I added a tad of flour to thicken it.  Next time I will try NOT putting the mushrooms with the sauce when thickening.

This is really really good. I didn't have thick bacon, so I used 2 pieces of thin, low sodium.  I also broiled the chicken/bacon about 5 mins to crispen the bacon.  My children loved it, so did my husband. This is definately in our menu from now one!

Wonderful! Marvelous! I just can't say enough about this recipe! I made this for my family, and served it to them on a bed of rice. For me, I put it on a small amount of Dreamfield's spaghetti (I'm dieting) It was just phenomenal! Everyone loved it, and likened it to restaurant fare! I didn't have any heavy cream in the house, so I subbed Hood's Carb Countdown milk, and put the heat up just a bit more, and cooked until it was reduced to a gravy. It worked out very well. This is now a PERMANENT addition to our family recipe box!

I always love this recipe. It has reliable, rich flavor and is more like what you might get from a restaurant. The only thing I recommend is using more mushrooms than is called for, but that's because I like mushrooms.

We recently started up the first phase of a low-carb diet and this made a GREAT dinner! I used Morton's Hot Salt in place of the seasoning and at the end poured the sauce over and broiled for about 4 minutes. This would be good with a just a little cheese melted over top also. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the sauce was pretty runny so I might not have done something right, I'm not sure. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I browned the chicken first in a skillet and also cooked the bacon halfway before placing on chicken.  Added a little chicken stock to skillet to deglaze and then added cream for sauce.  Also added parmesean cheese to sauce but was still very runny.

I use Boneless chicken breast. And thick bacon. sometimes i also use canned mushrooms and it turns out great! Oh and I don't use any salt. Bacon has enough salt in it for flavor.

My kids LOVED this recipe (and they usually hate any chicken dish!)...i took advice from other reviews -- my changes:  used 4TBS butter; sliced onion in bottom of dish; pre-cooked the bacon in pan; then sauteed chicken in 2TBS bacon fat; used 2 sm. cans sliced mushrooms instead of fresh; substituted fat free half & half for cream, plus added about 1/4 c. extra; added remaining bacon grease to gravy mixture....everyone loved this dish and i'll definitely use again!!!

This was an excellent recipe.  I made it with tater-tot casserole and a salad to go with.  The bacon left a great flavor both on the chicken and in the sauce.  My husband made this with me and it was easy enough that he said he'd make it on his own.

very yummy! creamy and garlicky.  i took the liberty of sprinkling some dried onion flakes on top as well.  and was in a small bit of rush for the sauce to thicken so i cheated with corn starch, but it was definitely a hit!

Delicious and easy!  I made a few changes, not that this recipe needs it, I think it would have been good as is.  However, I did add a slice of Provolone cheese to each chicken breast in the last 5 minutes of baking, used more bacon and a little extra seasoning. Make this recipe!  You'll be glad you did.

I didn't have much time in the kitchen tonight so I put some sliced onion in the bottom of a casserole dish, added the seasoned chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and topped it with a can of cream of chicken soup mixed with the cream. It was done in an hour, and needed no 'supervision.' Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe, Sara!

This was amazing.  I used frozen, breaded chicken and garlic salt instead of real garlic, and i didn't have any mushrooms, but it was still fabulous.  I bought the chicken for an easy dinner, but it was so gross that i had to try to find recipies to make it better.  This was the first one i liked, and I'm in love wiht it now.  EASY!  DELICIOUS!!  Definatly reccomended :)

The sauce was very good. The bacon and the chicken were soggy and not so great. If I make this again, I'll change a few things.

I don't know what happened. there was almost no juice in the pan when the chicken was finished cooking. The chicken tasted good, but the mushrooms were charred. This is the first thing i've ever made that has flopped completely. If it had turned out right i would rate it a 5. I know it has potential and will make again w/some alterations.

Wonderful, easy meal. My husband loved it, however, he wanted more bacon. Also, if you cook the bacon partially before placing on top of chicken, you should save the drippings for the sauce.

The sauce in this recipe earned it the 5 stars alone!!!!!  I used legs instead of breasts, and adjusted ingredients accordingly!!  The chicken by itself isn't anything to write home about, but add this sauce, and wow!!!!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was very good.  I cooked the bacon ahead of time so there wasn't as much grease.  The chicken turned out very nice, although boneless chicken would probably be easier.  It was surprisingly easy to make and will be on a regular rotation from now on.  Thanks for the suggestion.

Tastes  a lot like the rotisserie chicken from my local market, only better with the bacon and mushroom flavors. Using the drippings was too greasy for our tastes (I even used COOKED bacon slices)so we used very little of the sauce.  But,it had a wonderful, RICH, smoky flavor from the mushrooms and bacon. The reviews that said they did not think it had enough flavor, might want to try with fresh PORTABELLO mushrooms, cut up. I used them and think it was outstanding;they add so much more flavor than just the button ones. This is not low-fat for sure... but it IS LOW-CARB for you Atkins and High Protein dieters.

YUMMY!! We really enjoyed this chicken, and as stated it was very easy to make.  In an attempt to lower the fat content I substituted lowfat milk with a bit of lowfat cream cheese mixed in for the half and half.  We will make this a regular dish.

This was good but it lacked something, but not sure what.  I think if I sauteed the chicken first it would add a little "umph" to it.  But good recipe though.

I thought this was an okay recipe for a quick dinner. I used boneless breasts extra mushroom and bacon. I made the sauce with the drippings and cream and found it to be a little bland. Maybe next time making a sauce using cream of mushroom soup as a base would be better. It definately needs some doctoring up!

I used boneless thighs (they were the only chicken pieces I had on hand), and did season the sauce as it was quite bland when I tasted it.  My husband thought the dish was a bit "rich" but my kids liked it.

This was good, but it probably would have been better if I didn't forget the last step.  When the chicken came out of the oven I just served it like that, I forgot to put the juices in a pan with the whipping cream.  I also added more bacon.  I like the hickory flavor.

Fantastic!  This is a delicious meal and is very easy to make.  The only changes I made were to use frozen chicken breasts and to use two slices of bacon per breast instead of one.

This was excellent,  Hubby couldn't beleive I prepared such a tasty dish.  It turned out to be of restaurant quality.  I used baby portabellas and boneless skinless chicken breasts.  It was very moist,  simply delicious.  I increased the sauce ingredients a little,  so there would be plenty.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  Definitely a keeper!!!!!

I am a beginner cook and I just have to say this recipe is wonderful.  My husband loved it, so I made it for my two children and they loved it also.  The garlic was a little much for my younger one, but overall it was super easy and great tasting.

love this recipe, have made many times.  Even easier use real bacon bits in a jar.  I add a bit of basil and some parsley to the sauce. Also use boneless thighs.  Very good flavor.

nice flavor - chicken was tender and moist.  I would make this again.  I doubled the mushrooms and would add still more next time, also would increase the sauce.  Very good, thanks.

This recipe was very easy to make.  Although I can understand why it would be good for someone on a low-carb diet, my family and I simply did not care for the chicken.  I won't make it again.

It had a funny taste to it, probably because of the bacon. The sauce didn't thicken, but the chicken was okay. Kinda tough, but not too bad.

I am not sure what I did wrong, but my sauce never did thicken.  The chicken was okay, but not anything special.  I might possibly make it again, but will add a little flour or cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

I am NOT a chicken lover AT ALL!...however, this is by far the absolute best chicken recipe I have ever tasted!  I was really impressed!  I will DEFINATELY be serving this one again...and again...and...  I added 3 pearl onions per breast and included the onions, mushrooms, and cut up  bacon to the sauce.  Also added more cream to make more of this wonderful sauce.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.  I can finally eat chicken!

Absolutely delicious! Try with chicken legs instead, they are even juicier and tastier!

I loved this recipe-I wanted to try it because it was so low in carbs.  I did add a little vermouth to the pan-I was afraid the meat would be dry-shouldn't have worried-I did cut up the bacon and put it in the sauce pan to cook it a little more then added mushrooms and made sauce per recipe-very good.  Thank-you

DELICIOUS!!  Long ago for a dinner party I made a time-consuming, expensive dish that everyone loved, but I have haven't made it since because it was such a pain.  This recipe had nearly the same flavor, but I used what I already had (inexpensive) and it was SO easy!!  I used boneless skinless breasts, so it cooked a little faster.  WONDERFUL.  Even the kids liked it. Tastes impressive, without all the headache!!  I will definately make this again and again!
