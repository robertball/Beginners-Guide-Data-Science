I've made sausage balls for years just like this, but I"ve never used eggs.  They made the mixture so much easier to work with!  Next time, I may only use 1 egg and see how it works.

12/18/08 Update: This year, I threw all the ingredients into my KitchenAid and used the dough hook. After a few minutes, everything was perfectly combined!  So fast and easy!! Plus, I didn't have to knead it all together with my hands, which is always my least favorite part about making these.

This was a good recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I used 4 eggs instead of 2, it was just too dry.  The first batch I placed on a rack in the pan, but then part of the mixture fell through.  Just placing them on a cookie sheet worked great.  I also baked them at 425 degrees.  Everyone at brunch really enjoyed these and kept asking me what they were.  No one knows it was so simple to make!

These might be my new favorite thing. I tweaked it a little after reading the reviews, I used 2 eggs and 2/3 cup of milk and they turned out moist and delicious! I also used spicy pork chorizo instead of regular sausage and it made all the difference. I was making them for breakfast tomorrow before work but it's 10:30 at night and they are almost all gone!

This is a family xmas favorite. My two kids are grown now & still ask for these every year. I use 3 C Bisquick, 2 C Pepper Jack Cheese, 2 Large Eggs, 1.25 lbs of Uncooked Potters Hot Sausage (made in OK) & a dash or two tobasco. We like them Hot! Done this way & cooked on Parchement @ 400 for 15-17 minutes they come out perfect.

I have always been uncertain if you use the sausage raw or cook it.  This recipee does not state either.  But I did not precook the sausage and the baking in the oven was perfect.  Great recipe.

After reading reviews I revised this to:  1# spicy sausage. 2c bisquik. 2 cups shredded cheese. 1 egg. cooked at 400 on a broiler pan (slits in it for fat to drop down) for 15 minutes.  They were very tasty. Not dry at all.

Excellent recipe!  One pound made 117 sausage balls.  I used Chorizo and a Mexican cheese blend (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla, Asadero).  I took a hint from another reviewer and used my KitchenAid to mix it all up.  That was a time and a yucko saver!

These turned out great. I used turkey sausage b/c my SO is on low fat for his heart. They were all eaten within 24 hours. So I made some more and wrapped them in pizza dough that i made and baked them til golden brown. These too were gone same day. followed other reviewers advice as always and only used 2 C buscuick and 1 egg.

I like this recipe, however, the according to the recipe, the yield is way off.  I doubled the recipe because I needed more than 12 and ended up with close to 100.

These were good but you do not need 3 cups of baking mix. I only used 2. I also added about 1/4 cup of milk. They came out gooey and soft...but  crisp on the outside. YUM!

Sausage balls are a huge hit around my house during Christmas. I could honesly make them anytime but I enjoy baking them around Christmas and sharing them with friends or family. They're a treat worth waiting for and that deserve to be viewed as special. :-)

These were good!  I also tweaked the original recipe a bit because it looked dry.  My changed included:  I used a dough hook to mix this up, added 3 eggs, 1/4 c milk and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.

Tasty but dry and over cooked! The time is too long for a gas oven on the middle rack. Mine didn't burn but were very dark after 30 min, so the next batch I cooked for 25 min but still came out dark. I lowered the temp to 355 and cooked for 25 min still and had a little less darkness but still darker than I've had them before at a baby shower.  I didn't want to risk having the meat undercooked so I didn't chance lowering the temp or time any lower.

I have made this recipe in many different variations and all were good. The one ingredient that I always stick with is using the "hot" variation of sausage. If you like sausage gravy biscuits, try cheese balls made larger than normal and serving them with a generous portion of country gravy poured over the top. Tastes great.

I used this recipe but I used 2 lbs of sausage, 2 eggs and velveeta cubes mixed than added the biscuit mix pretty much to feel like you do biscuits. I will let ya know how they came out after they are done! Merry Christmas!

Made these just the other day and you could hardly even taste the sausage.. There was just way too much biscuit mix! I'm making another batch today, this time with 2/3 cup milk as a reviewer suggested, and only 2 cups of biscuit mix. Hopefully that will be better...

My husband and I didn't really like these.  The sausage balls were dry and didn't really have much taste.  We ended up having to use a lot of syrup to even eat them.  Probably won't make this again.

I used the suggestions and added 2 extra eggs.  And these were still TOO dry.  I think it would be better with less baking mix, and will have to try them again.

I have made these for years as an appetizer and never even thought about making them for breakfast!!!  What a quick treat and the kids thought they were great with fruit and milk!  The only change I made was to use less biscuit mix because they always come out so dry....next time I will use another reviewer's tip about adding sour cream and cream cheese.  It's also good to try different sausage and/or cheese to make new flavors.

Great on-the-go breakfast!  I added 1/2 cup finely chopped celery and 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, and upped the sausage to 1.5 lb.  It's enough to eat breakfast on the way to work for a couple of weeks.

Too bready. Next time I will reduce baking mix by half. I like the idea to use a dough hook.

Great recipe.  These are good frozen for a quick snack later or for lunches.  For the people who found the mix dry, try using greasier sausage.  Not good for health, but helps the taste a ton.  These are also good if you substitute mozzarella for the cheddar and serve with marinara.

Add a couple tablespoons of milk to make the sausage balls a little more moist and serve with peppered gravy. Fantastic!
