an easy version of a time consuming classic. It's very basic, too. My own version of this has a leg of lamb and uses oregano, lemon, and feta cheese as well as the ingredients you listed. I was taught using the "handful" measuring method, so I'm not sure about quantities. Still, this takes about 1/10 the time and is very tasty :). 

Thank you for sharing! I'll be making this again for sure. Definitely try adding feta if you're looking for suggestions. It does wonders for this recipe.

This was really excellent--simple, quick, and filling. I made exactly as described, but without celery. It turned out perfectly. One note: It may be difficult to find "stewed" tomatoes at your grocery store (it was at mine), so a can of chopped or peeled tomatoes should be a fine substitution.

Very easy, and very good...so good my 5 year old even loved it.  I pretty much made it as is, but used Franks Red Hot sauce in place of the cayenne.  I also used whole tomatoes, instead of stewed...will probably use diced tomatoes next time.  I did try it with the feta, which was very good too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great and easy.  I sprinkled some feta cheese crumbles on top for a little zing.

Made this last night and it was very good.  Was out of celery so added some onion.  Had to add some water to it.  Tasted like lamb shanks with orzo from a Greek restaurant.  Worth fixing again.

This is absolutely delicious and so easy to make. We add spinach and a chopped onion when cooking and then sprinkle with feta when we serve it. It's a staple in our house.

Easy and yummy! Seemed to me we would probably like more seasoning so I threw in some Greek seasoning and a dash of cinnamon. Delicious! Thank you fire00starter!!

Quick, easy, easily found ingredients, and most importantly - YUM! My husband had thirds! You might need to add an additional 1/2-2/3 c. water and cook a bit longer though.  I added some kalamata olives, a few Tbsp of olive juice, and pepper as well.  Will definitely make again...

Not as exciting as I had hoped, but still tasty. Also, this was barely enough for 3 adults, FYI.

I make this all the time. You do need to continually add water to it though so that the orzo doesn't stick. Other than that it's delicious!

Oh my goodness! This is entirely too easy to be this tasty. Excellent flavor (I am a savory kinda gal), and super quick and easy to make. I sometimes saute a chopped onion with the celery before browning the meat. Add a salad and voila, the perfect dinner. I am not a big fan of lamb so this recipe was a surprise. Also, a tip for those of you feeding those with sensitive palates, cut back on the cayenne pepper and allow the fire-eaters to add it separately.

This was very good and filling but a little fatty for my taste. I should have drained the fat after browning the lamb but since I added chopped onions thought I would need the grease to saut√© them. I also added lemon juice, oregano, Italian seasoning and topped with feta and chopped parsley. Served it with a baguette, Greek salad and watermelon/feta salad. Nice combo.

Amazing recipe! We let it cool for 3 more min so the orzo had more time to absorb the tomato juice. Also had it with French baguette, delicious!

I made it with ground beef and topped with feta and it was delicious.  I did add a bit of lemon juice and oregano while it was cooking to give it more flavor.  I would probably use diced tomatoes next time rather than stewed tomatoes because the tomato chunks would be smaller that way.

Loved it.  So quick and easy to make and so few dishes to clean ! I seared sliced mushrooms in oil first, removed from pan, then followed recipe from beginning, adding mushrooms back with the tomatoes.  I had to frequently stir the sauce  as it simmered, else it stuck to the bottom of the pan.  As per other reviews, I added alot (2 tbs) oregano, approx. 1 cup of feta pieces and juice of half lemon.   Feta gave it a creamy texture, and lemon just lightened it a little.  Delicious.

I made this tonight because ground lamb was on sale at my local store.  Never had ground lamb before, but this was a hit! Added salt and pepper to the lamb as I cooked it, also added the calamata olives and a bit of their juice when I added the other ingredients.  I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes and added some extra oregano.  Also added a little chicken stock and cooked a bit longer than suggested.  Was light on the cayenne as we don't like a lot of spice.  I definitely recommend adding some feta on top as it gives a little more saltiness to the dish.  My kids loved it and I loved the simplicity of this dish!

I will definitely be making this again. It was very easy and quick. I did not have canned tomatoes, so blanched, peeled and used fresh tomatoes. This is an excellent dish for me, as I really like lamb!

This is a tasty, easy meal--good for nights you don't have a lot of time to cook. We aren't big lamb eaters, so I use ground turkey instead.
