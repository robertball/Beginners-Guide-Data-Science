Excellent!!!  Easy and delicious!  Better than the yeast recipes that take too long!!!  Thanks!  Had no problem with them sticking...I just used a non-stick spray on the iron.  Cooking for 30 seconds with lid open was a great hint!

These were quite good!  :)  My kids and hubby ate them up!  They stuck some to my waffle iron.  I haven't ever had to grease it before, but I had to with these.  I followed the recipe with leaving the iron open for 30 seconds after putting the dough in and they crisped up fairly nicely.  I had raspberries and strawberries to go on top along with some Cool Whip.  YUM!

These did turn out tender. We topped them with a vanilla butter sauce.
