There is nothing "normal" about this chicken! Amazing. I added 1/2 cup brown sugar as recommended and am SO glad I did. My presentation turned out beautiful. Rice, broccoli, chicken right on top, drizzled with the sauce... When my husband bit into his chicken all he could say was "Wow"! He wasn't expecting so much flavor, and neither was I. This ones a keeper. For kicks I made egg drop soup to make this more of a chinese type meal.

I have been using this recipe for years, the only difference is I use boneless skinless chicken brest, and I add at least 1 Cup of BROWN SUGAR to the recipe as it is cooking,  this makes it EXTRA YUMMY!!!!!

This was a great chicken recipe.
Very easy and will make again!  I followed what others had written and browned the chicken in about 1T Olive oil first.  I also decreased the soy sauce to 2T, added 1T of rice wine vin., 1T chopped garlic and 1T onion powder.  I made everything on the stove top.  After chicken browned, I turned the heat to med., added sauce ingr. and covered the pot.  I cooked the bone-in chicken pieces for approx. 20 min., turning chicken a couple of times.

Update: This is a very good base recipe. However, I was scared that it would lack the flavor I was looking for, so I tweaked it a bit. First, I seasoned the split breasts with garlic powder, ground ginger powder, kosher salt, and black pepper. For the marinade I used 4 TB of soy sauce, 2 TB of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 fresh garlic cloves (grated), a small piece of fresh ginger (also grated), and topped the dish with fresh pineapple (cubed). OMG, talk about good! The gravy that was made from this dish was delicious with white rice! Made a yummy Asian-style dinner.

The best recipe I know of with this number of ingredients -- so simple, in fact, that I've memorized it for those occasions when I have to cook and I have no access to a recipe book/file/website.  I add sliced carrot and parsnips, and they come out perfectly in the time the chicken takes to bake.  Thanks for this!

Wonderful, wonderful recipe.  So easy, so good.  I did increase each sauce by 1 tablespoon and added approximately 1/4 of brown sugar.  This made a wonderful au jus.  Definitely a part of my cooking rotation.  My husband absolutely raved and so did I.  Thanks for offering such a simple, yet tasty dish!

After tweaking to our taste this was very good. I substituted A-1 steak sauce for the Worcestershire, I do that for everything calling for Worcestershire because the idea of eating anchovies or anything with anchovies in it absolutely disgusts me and I find the steak sauce to be the perfect substitute. Also I added 1/4 tsp of black pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1 Tb molasses. Like some others I used thighs 2 for 1 instead of breasts because I just like dark meat better. The whole thing was quick and easy and while the chicken cooked I made rice and broccoli to go with it.

I made this dish on the stovetop, rather than in the oven. I just browned the chicken, then added the sauce and covered it. It cooked on medium for 35 minutes. It was really good! The sauce was great on rice, as well.

Such a strange name for an easy chicken dish! I think I will marinate the chicken over night in the  sauces and then bake it for a more tender chicken breast. We pourd the additional cooked sauce over rice and it was pretty good. Thanks a millon!

This chicken was AWESOME!!! It had SOO much flavor.  This is what I did differently:  (1) I used chicken pieces-drumsticks, instead of boneless chicken breasts.  Since that's what I dad on hand  (2) I seasoned the chicken pieces with salt, pepper and granulated garlic  (3) I added a 1/2 cup brown sugar (add more for a sweeter taste)   (4) added 1/4 cup water  The result was a "teriyaki" sauce that is WAY better then the ones you buy at the supermarket.This smelled SOO good cooking in the oven. I'm sure it would be awesome with sliced onions and bell peppers added to it. My husband ABSOULUTELY loved this dish, he's already asked me to make it again and i already made it FOUR nights ago. This will for sure be one of the regular meals at our house.   Thanks for the great recipe.  This one's definitely a keeper.

Not a bad recipe...took the advice of others and added 1 cup of brown sugar.  My boys thought it was a little too sweet.  Maybe next time I will only use 1/2 cup brown sugar, but I really think it needed the sweetness to the sauce.  Served with steamed broccoli and white rice...almost like a Chinese dish.  Had a nice flavor and will probably make again, super easy!!!

This sounded so good but didn't turn out that way. :( It was definitely easy but turned out tough & dry and the sauce only cooked in the bottom of the breasts.

This chicken was delicious.  Similar to many of the other review, I added 1 cup brown sugar, and increased the sauce measurements by 1Tbs as well.  I used whole boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooked it at 375 degrees, and kept it in the over for about 1hr 15. min.  I also flipped the chicken approximately once every 20 minutes or so.  This disk came out delicious, thanks for the recipe!

Oh my! Was this ever good!! I followed others' advice and added brown sugar to the soy sauce and worchestshire. I doubled the soy and worch. sauces ( so we would have extra sauce) and mixed in 1 cup of brown sugar. I then poured it over the chicken. I used boneless-skinless breast so it only took about 25 minutes in the oven. When they were done the tops weren't too good looking so I flipped them over and let set on top of the oven for 5 minutes covered with the foil. Delish! We served with rice and frozen stir fry veggies. My kids mixed everything together on their plates to make it a stir fry.

Very good. I added the brown sugar as suggested by others, and then when it was done and the chicken was resting, I strained the sauce and boiled it down to make a sticky, thicker sauce. Yum. Served it with garlic roasted potatoes and steamed green beans.

We love normal chicken! I have to say this is the easiest and quickest way to make the chicken disappear. After the first time making it the kids talked so much about it I had 2 mom's call to find out what it was. Much thanks

It wasn't the best chicken I've ever had, but it was really good.  I gave it a 5 because it is so simple, easy, and fast.  I also added brown sugar (1/2 c).  I will make it again and maybe try more of the modifications suggested in other reviews.  But, this recipe is great in a pinch!!!

This was a little weird.   The taste of soy was overpowering. We added brown sugar and put it back in the oven then poured the sauce into a pot and thickened it with cornstarch. It was ok, but not something I'll make again.

I was surprised when I came across this recipe.  I've been making this for years with drummies and wings, then broiling them, baking them, and grilling them - depending on the flavor I want.  Sometimes I add the brown sugar when I want something a little sweeter, sometimes I use only soy sauce.  I always serve with rice, and sometimes pineapple.  They are always a hit.  Thanks for posting!

Easy recipe with good flavor. I used light soy sauce and added two tablespoons of brown sugar. I sliced the breasts into thinner fillets. I also flipped them over during baking and basted them a couple of times to improve the light color on top.

Fantastic chicken!!  Upon some other reviews, I also added brown sugar (only 2 TBSP) to the soy/wors mixture.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1 tsp of fresh ginger for some kick.  Used bone in skinless as that's all I buy and seasoned before hand with garlic and pepper.  These were moist, tender and full of great flavour.  I did baste with the sauce during cooking...my only complaint is that I didn't have rice or something as a side to drizzle the extra sauce over, lol!!

Very good. I gave it 4 stars because I altered the original recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken and cooked it at 350 for 20 minutes which made them juicy and cooked through. I used the same amount of worsh. sauce and soy sauce but added 1/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkled liberally from a goya lemon/garlic seasoning. Was the perfect amount of taste without taking away from the chicken. Great base to work with!

Chicken came out moist and juicy. The second time I made this recipe, I added 2 Tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar at the beginning, baked for 40 min, then added a can of Pineapple Chunks (drained), returned it to the oven for the remaining 10 minutes. Served it with Broccoli and white rice, and it was delicious.

very, very fall-of-the-bone good chicken. I used drumsticks (I though i bought breasts!) and they came out great. Will be making this again. I added honey to a batch (rather than the suggested brown sugar), and stuck to the recipe with another and both were fabulous.

This gets 4 stars for being SUPER simple and quick to throw together. I did add about 1/3 cup of honey to the sauce to make it a little sweet. All 7 of my kids liked it, and my husband said it was pretty good. Thanks.

This was extremely bland.  I took the foil off of the baking dish half way through in hopes that the sauce would thicken and stick to the meat.  No luck.  I added brown sugar as was suggested along with a little garlic powder and ginger.  The sauce tasted good, but didn't really flavor the chicken (and I basted several times).  If I try this again, I will probably marinate them in the sauce and season the chicken breasts before baking.

I loved this a lot, but not the biggest "wow" from my family I was expecting.  I used 1/2 c. brown sugar, and broiled these for 4-5 min. after they were cooked through.  I think some fresh ginger, and maybe some pineapple would give this a little more of the unique flavor my family was wanting.

I made this wonderful recipe tonight for dinner. I made a mistake and didn't cover the chicken while it was baking, so I didn't get any wonderful juice. But I did add 1 1/2 teaspoons of mince garlic. It had the best flavor.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is possibly the best chicken recipe I have ever made. My super picky husband inhaled it and wants it again (and again) I just made a few changes. I only used 1/4 C. brown sugar and I added a dash of onion powder. Other than that, I just baked it as per the recipe. I served it with Maryellen's Baked Onions from on here and white rice. I was worried the tastes would be too similar but wow, did they ever work together!

I actually use this recipe when i make chicken wings. I add about a 1/2 cup of Brown sugar and I also coat the wings with Garlic and Onion powder. Let Marinate for a few hours and cook.
They are a big hit!

I have made this chicken as instructed and again with the brown sugar and garlic.  Although they are two different recipes, my family gave both of them a four on a scale of ten.  I, on the other hand, thought they were both delicious and would make it again with the brown sugar and garlic.
I have rated the original recipe as I do not think that the rating should be given to a recipe that has been changed to end up with someone else's recipe.
Thanks for sharing.  It is a good basis chicken recipe with room for variation.

I used thighs and baked 45 minutes. Good, but the flavor is not as strong as I would prefer. The drippings have a lot of flavor, but the chicken itself might benefit from marinating a few hours. I added  brown sugar, but only 1 tablespoon, because I didn't want it too sweet.

I made this for dinner last night.. it was quick and easy. I followed some of the customized recipes changes suggested and did a few changes myself. First I used only 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tablespoon of butter, garlic powder to taste, 1/2 teaspoon of chili peppers, small chopped onions and the 3 tablespoons of soy sauce.. I did not have Worcester sauce but that was ok.. I also used thinly sliced chicken breast which cut down on the cooking time... it only took fifteen mins for the chicken to cook down and not fifty mins as suggested in the original cook time stated. My family loved it .. there are no left overs.

We loved this!  I read the reviews and thought the 1c of brown sugar sounded like a bit much, so I added 3/4c. I think next time I will cut it down to 1/2 and marinate a few hours ahead of time. Very tasty over brown rice with some broccoli.  My 2 year old sang "I love chicken, I love chicken!" all through dinner. :)  Thanks!

Followed the advice of so many others and doubled the Worcestershire and soy sauces and added approx. 1/2 cup brown sugar and some garlic powder.  Super simple recipe that resulted in very moist chicken - will definitely make again, but will play around with additional flavors in the future.  Thanks!

Even I couldn't mess this up.  I am a lousy cook, ask my family.  This was So Easy and So tasty, I still can't believe it. I used a family package of boneless/skinless chicken breast and doubled the liquid ingredients. I did add a couple of pressed garlic cloves and sprinkled brown sugar over the top before putting it in the oven.  50 minutes @ 350 and they were perfect.

Nothing wrong with the ingrediants- the dish was very tasty it's just you cannot use a cover in the oven or it does not cook. It took me an hour and a half to bake it when I realized after 50 minutes of baking that it was still very raw. Over than not using a cover the recipe is good.

Wow! This was great. Of course with some modifications: in lieu of Worcester Sauce, I used Chip Davis's Bry. I added the brown sugar, topped it all off with sliced green onion, a little cilantro and crushed salt.  I used thin sliced breast halves and baked it for 30 minutes. A definite winner!

Nothing special. Would have been the same with salt and pepper. I gave it 3 stars only because it was really easy, otherwise it's absolutely nothing special.

I love this!  I also added the brown sugar but then I added a corn starch and cold water mixture (about 1TBS of each) to the sauce after the chicken was done, covered it and microwaved it for about a minute to thicken it up. I would make this again!

As is 2 stars. Odd taste with the worchestershire. Second time I made it this way.  Cut chicken into large cubes. Wisk together soy sauce, minced garlic, 1 t brown sugar, onion powder, pepper, 1/2 t lemon juice, 1 T olive oil. Pour over chicken and let set over night. Put on skewers.  Grill for 5 minutes on each side. Delicious.

I'm giving the recipe a three because without the suggestions of the other reviewers, this would have been very bland.

I used the advice of several others here and added a quarter cup of brown sugar (which I think I'll halve next time), and added onion and garlic powder. I used boneless, skinless breasts and baked for half an hour at 350 degrees. The modified recipe turned out great, but for extra EXTRA flavor, my boyfriend and I used the excess sauce for dipping. I was kind of disappointed with the look of this dish, though. It had a sickly, almost unappetizing color. I'll make this again soon because it's easy and convenient for a busy student.

I've always used soy sauce for my recipe, and adding the worschester sauce really adds a nice taste to it.  I usually bake my boneless skinless chicken breasts at 325F because I'm paranoid about overcooked chicken.  I use a thermometer and cook until the chiken is at least 175F.  It was really moist and even after nuking leftovers.  Really good basic chicken.

Delicious recipe! My only mistake was I added brown sugar to the excessive. Thinking that the soy sauce and Worchester sire sauce would be so bitter I overcompensated. Quick , simple and delicious.

Family loved it. I double the sauces and added 1/2 cup Brown sugar and some lemon juice. I flipped them every 15 minutes and the last 5 I took off foil. Good. It wasn’t as juicy as I would have liked, but it was good. I think next time I’ll add honey and garlic!

I like soy sauce, I like Worcestershire sauce. I do not like them together and on chicken. I made the recipe exactly. No one in the family like it

We doubled the sauce. To counter the salt we added 2TB of dark brown sugar—we didn’t want it to taste like teriyaki. Cooked it on the stovetop to better control the chicken temp and reduce the sauce some. Worked great over rice and broccoli.

Very good choice made it for my family and they loved it. But i added the 3 tablespoon of Soy sauce and 3 tablespoons of  Worcestershire instead of just 2 with also 1/4 of Brown Sugar.  Made some White rice ( 2 cups ) with a dash of Cumin and Pepper.  Will be making this again......

This is a nice dish. I looked at the reviews and changed it to 4tbs soy sauce and 2tbs Worcestershire sauce. I also added 1/4cup brown sugar and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, ginger, salt and pepper. I did this on stove top with frozen chicken and cook time was 30-45min.

I was looking for a quick meal with little to no ingredients and found this recipe! I added brown sugar like the reviews said and flipped the chicken in the sauce a few times within 50 minutes to be sure it was covered all over because otherwise the sauce will just cook at the bottom of the pan but my boyfriend loved it!!! As soon as he bit in to the chicken (I used drumsticks) he was like "this is really good!" I was hoping I could pack some for lunch the next day and he ate some and took the rest to work! Lol! No leftovers ????

I thought this dish was pretty good and I loved how simple it was!  I didn't think it was anything that special though.  I saw all the posts suggesting modifications but I am currently staying away from sugar and wanted to try the recipe as posted.  I would probably make it again.

This is the best chicken recipe!  I do mine in a slow cooker. Shred chicken and pour sauce over rice. I have 3 picky eaters and this is their favorite.

I cook for a family of five, with three growing boys so I made a family pack of breasts (~4 pounds) with a 1/4c worcestershire and 1/4c 2Tbsp soy and 1/4 cup brown sugar mixed together, cooked at 425 for an hour and 15 min.  It was so tender it could be cut with a fork!!  My whole family loved it!!  Making it again tonight!  Thanks so much!

Great with the suggested changes by other reviewers -- add about 1/4 cup brown sugar, some minced garlic, a dash of olive oil, and some minced garlic. Also, a few shakes of ground ginger finished it off. Smells fabulous and tastes even better! Served with rice and broccoli. My 3 and 5 year old non-adventuresome eaters were very complimentary and ate everything on their plates!

I made exactly as written; my husband said it was ok, but I didn't care for it.  Would try it agin with some modifications like pre-browning, spices.  Not a bad recipe, for my own personal tastes I would need to tweak it to make it again.

Good enough that I'll try again with maybe a twist or two.  Following the cooking directions, this came out extremely dry and tough on the inside.  Maybe it was my chicken from frozen, which I nuked for a minute to help thaw them out.  I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1t each garlic and onion powders.

This was really good, but I did make some changes.  I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the sauce as well as some canned pineapple tidbits.  As a side, I stir fried some red and yellow peppers with more pineapple and we drizzled the sauce over this when the chicked was done...yummy! Even my 5 and 3 year olds loved it!

This is a yummy recipe.  I followed the instructions provided by the other reviewers and added brown sugar and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt before.  I also double the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce super yummy.

This was so salty we could not eat it even though I used low sodium soy sauce. I have tried it twice, modifying with broth the 2nd time and still it was too salty. We won't try it again.

This recipe was alright.  Everyone ate it with no complaints, but we found the chicken a little dry.  It may be the recipe's fault...I think next time I might add some brown sugar as another reviewers did.  On it's own, a little on the "boring"side.

This was simply incredible. I marinated the chicken for about an hour with soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, some pineapple juice, garlic and onion powder as well as chili powder. I added canned pineapple chunks just before cooking. So delicious. Will most definitely make again. Thank you for sharing this.

I made this exactly how the recipe calls for. It was the blandest chicken ever! It needs a lot more than soy sauce and worcestire sauce.

I followed some revewers and added a tbs of rice wine vinegar and some brown sugar (didn't measure).  I put the chicken in the pan on some chopped onions.  I served it with white rice and broccoli.  I thought it was just ok but DH loved it.  I thought it would have been better with more brown sugar (should have measured it), and I wished I'd put the onions on top of the chicken instead of under it.  DH will have the leftovers for lunch.

Very good! I have an 8 yr and 6 yr old, not to mention a husband that are all VERY picky eaters and they asked for seconds! The fact that my 8 yr old ate more than two bites says everything in my household.   I did add and extra tbls of each sauce plus 1/4 cup brown sugar. I will double next time b/c the sauce is too yummy not to have extra. I am not the best cook and this turned out perfect. Very easy to make and delicious.   Thanks for sharing!!

I've made this twice now, both times I doubled the liquids, added 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar, half a chopped onion and a few minced cloves of garlic. The finished extra sauce is sooo good drizzled on jasmine rice. Delicious dinner!

Very good, simple,  juicy chicken.  I actually marinated the chicken for 2 days (by accident..I was planning on making it the next day and then our schedules became too busy).  That might be why other people felt that it was too bland.  2 days was a perfect amount of time to marinate!

Disappointing - after reading all the reviews I thought this would be great - but it wasn't.  My husband actually asked if I did something wrong in the recipe, which I didn't. Nope, not making it again.  Shake N Bake is just as easy and way better!

Gave it 3 stars, because it was to salty for us. The flavor was good if it had not been so salty.

My kids really loved this chicken. I made it with both white meat and dark meat chicken and also added some powdered ginger. My family prefered the dark meat which was more flavorful and tender. Overall, an easy successful recipe.

The chicken was good and tender but not particularly flavorful and the sauce was too salty to use.  I added the brown sugar like the others suggested.  My son didnt like it.  Leftovers made a good salad

Okay, this has potential.  I tried it last night and while it was rather salty, it wasn't inedible.  I would consider making it again with a low sodium soy sauce.  I took the recommendation of others and added the brown sugar, hoping to cut the salt, but it didn't do enough.  BUT...my 3 year old ate it and that speaks volumes.  I'll try again one of these days.

This was pretty good with the added benefit that it's easy! I used 3.5 lbs. of chicken pieces so I doubled the sauce along with 1 cup of brown sugar.I seasoned the meat with onion powder and a garlic pepper blend. I used low sodium soy sauce. Thru in some carrots. Delish! I think if I make it again I will marinate to get the flavor more into the meat instead of the skin, maybe use skinless/boneless.

This dish is Yummy!!! and will definitely go in my recipe binder.  I made this with 4 boneless breasts. I cut each one into 4 thinner pieces. I used the 1 C. brown sugar, 6 T. Soy Sauce and 3 T. Worch. sauce, some onion flakes and minced garlic. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  The chicken was a rather yucky color but I just flipped the pieces over and wala!  They were a nice brown color. No one was here to try it but me so I'll have to wait and see how they like it when they get home.

This is a great basic no-fuss recipe.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and minced garlic to the sauce.  Can also add minced onion.  Served it with rice and broccoli.  Everyone loved it!

Ewwww - this wasn't good at all.  I knew it wouldn't be good with just the soy and worcestershire and so I followed the other recommendations and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Sauce tasted bad so I tried to "cover it" with soy sauce.  It ended up edible - just not good.

Made this once, very bland.  Made it a 2nd time, added oriental sour seasoning before cooking then topped it off with a pinch of chicken rub, and it was very good.  It's a good basic recipe, but add to it for more flavor.

I, too, took some of the others advice and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and made a sauce out of the marinade. It was really good. I'll keep coming back to this one.

This recipe sounded good, and it was very easy to prepare; however, it came out of the oven looking very unappetizing and the flavor was only so-so.  It was o.k. to eat but I will not make again.

I was not impressed by this.  Yes, it was super easy but I'm not sure the flavor was what I expected.  I made the recipe as written.  We all ate it, so it's not horrible.  It's worth a try if like soy and worch. sauce like I do!

I doubled the sauce, and I think I added garlic salt and lemon pepper (since that is how I season everything). It tasted ok but it looked unappetizing. Think dark gray chicken.
