Delicious. I added two tbsp of sweetener to the cream instead of 1. Also, it's important to really beat the egg yolks well. I didn't do that the first time and the custard was soup like. Second time I made sure to beat the yolks with my mixer and it was perfect.

This is SO good.   I make it once a week and it’s my Keto dessert for the week (a little goes a long way, it’s very rich!).    It takes longer than 30 minutes.   I cook it about 45 minutes otherwise it doesn’t set.  Definitely refrigerate and eat it cold.   Sometimes I sprinkle cinnamon on the top (with the sugar!).  And lastly, if you don’t have a torch, just broil the sugar topping for about 30 seconds in the oven or until it gets caramelized.   Great recipe!

How is something that has 16.9 g net carbs per serving considered keto? I hope I'm missing something because I'd love to make this!

The best thing that has happened to Keto since cooked meat, very surprising. I added 6 egg yokes as it makes it a little thicker. Also you cannot burn Stevia so you will have to use Erythritol for the topping. I might try adding Irish cream next (is that keto approved?) and some raspberries. Cooks perfectly in 7 minutes in my Instantpot... Get one!

I made these for the first time last night and they were very easy to make, I kept thinking I messed it up but they turned out perfect. 

Also I didnt have a kitchen blow torch to make the top glazed sugar part so instead I added cinnamon  on top before serving and they turned out even better than the glaze of sugar on top

I followed the recipe as is and it was ok.  Creme Brulee is my favorite dessert and I may fix this for myself on occasion but won't serve it to guests.  It is much better fresh than if it sits over night.  I used Stevia, which only burns on top and isn't that good burnt sugar taste.  I tried using a torch so maybe under the broiler will work better.  The next time, I will add more sweetener to the pudding as it wasn't quite sweet enough for me.

I've used the custard base for both creme caramel and creme brulee with fantastic results.  I would recommend some type of tart berry to balance the extreme sweetness.

It was delicious!! I made it with Splenda. I even put in broiler to get a crusty top and it did ok with Splenda but i like a lot of the crusty part so I will try a different sweetener on top. But other then that i wouldn’t change anything. I also baked it in a small cake pan because that’s all I had. It worked out fine.

I divided the recipe by 4 to make only 1 serving. Turned out amazing! It was a little softer than regular creme brulee, wasn't as set as what I've had before. But it wasn't runny and the sweetener on top still hardened enough. Definitely a fan and will make again. My hubby and mother-in-law thought it was delicious! I used monk fruit, right at 3.74g Net Carbs, 267 calories, 2.70g protein, 24.51g fat for my 1 serving.

Not sure who did the nutrition info on this, but these ingredients only have about 4 carbs per serving, not 17!
Not a bad recipe but the vanilla is a bit light and so is the custard. I would up the sweetness as well, a bit.

Excellent,  especially with using Splenda brown sugar on top.  I torched it and it had the perfect crunchy texture!

This was delicious, the only thing was the I used the   stevia and it was difficult to caramelize.  But after wrapping them with the  plastic wrap for 24 hours it was a bit easier to caramelize with the torch.

Just put it in the oven. Had 5 yokes left over from the weekend so I adjusted the heavy whipping cream to 19.2 oz total. The bit I tasted after pouring it into the ramekins tasted fabulous... Can't wait to try it after it sets and cools!

We loved this! I was looking for some good dessert recipes and this one was good and elegant enough for company.
