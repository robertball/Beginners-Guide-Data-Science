This was absolutely wonderful.  I made it as directed except I didn't use potatoes as I am trying to watch carbs.  I used dried thyme as I didn't have fresh and used chicken broth instead of water.  This is going to be a winter go-to soup.  Thanks!

I used butter instead of bacon fat and added more savory spices such as oregano, rosemary and sage along with vegetable bullion for the broth....it was delicious!

This is a great recipe as is. For convenience, I omitted the bacon and used olive oil to cook instead, but did add Costco's precoooked/crumbled bacon bits as topping. Delightful. Even my picky eatting daughter enjoyed it. Great way to add the nutrition of turnips to our diet! Thx.

I used a combination of 1 oz. bacon and 6 oz. turkey bacon; chicken broth instead of water; italian spice instead of fresh thyme; coconut milk and half-and-half instead of heavy cream; and baby spinach, kale, and swiss chard in place of just kale.  I loved it!

Made exactly as written and it was very good. We had fresh turnips and onions from our CSA share and fresh thyme from our herb garden and this was a good way to use them. The whole family enjoyed this. Very hearty with some fresh baked bread and a green salad.

Delicious!  I sautéed the onions in butter and then added the turnips and potatoes.  I also used chicken stock instead of water.  And I left out the kale step and added the cream alone.  This will be my go-to when I have turnips in my CSA box.  Absolutely delicious.

Yeah, it was ok. Maybe I'm just not a turnip fan. I didn't have cream and used cream of chicken.

The family loved this.  I didn't use as much bacon (1/2 pound) and instead of water I used chicken broth.

Made this today, and it was AWESOME! Used turkey bacon, a can of collard greens instead of fresh kale, and chicken broth instead of water.

Really had to cook the turnips and potatoes much more than the recipe called for.  The original recipe was very bland and needed a lot of additional herbs and spices to make it appealing.

I subbed the bacon with sausage because that’s what I had on hand, and added garlic. Also used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water. Incredibly tasty. Recommend.

Turned out great. Only substituted chicken bouillon instead of water. Otherwise followed exactly. My children ate it, which makes it a win.

Made this soup with a couple replacements to make it a much healthy hearty soup. I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, collard greens instead of kale and fat free heavy cream. It is freaking delicious!

I made this recipe, but added vegan adjustments! I used a cup of light coconut milk for the heavy cream, and Upton's Naturals "Bacon" Seitan. Also Earth Balance's "butter spread". Very tasty, added a lot of salt, and healthy! Eating my second bowl now.

We belong to a CSA and an abundance of turnips this year.  This was a great way to utilize these!  We loved it and all of my family and friends loved it!  I've copied your recipe and given it to many friends!  Thanks so much for sharing it!!

Absolutely delicious! Loved the turnips in this dish. The bacon contrasting with the kale was also wonderful. It took a lot of willpower to save leftovers for the next day's lunch. Can't wait to make it again.

I subbed the potatoes for sweet potatoes, and used basil instead of thyme (only because I was out). I also added lots of garlic, because I like garlic. It was amazing.

Instead of butter, I used bacon drippings to wilt the kale. I added a carrot. Even the kids had two bowls. Great recipe!

This is the best soup I have made at home. My husband goes absolutely crazy for it and it doesn't last long no matter how much I make. I recommend this soup to anyone and everyone I can and I frequently take it to parties and make it for dinner when large groups of family are coming over. It is delicious and savory!

This was wonderful. Very simple and not very time consuming. I hate when people change the recipe and then say how wonderful it was but I find using chicken stock instead of water added flavor.  I add 2 bulbs of minced garlic with the potato/turnip and add whatever fresh herbs I have on hand with the thyme. Leeks work really well for the onions. To save calories you can put some of the soup in a blender to thicken it instead of adding heavy cream and it is delicious that way as well but it obviously changes the texture. Either or this is a go too recipe on those cold winter nights.

This was truly delicious! I added extra seasoning: garlic, thyme sprigs, fresh oregano, and used chicken broth instead of water. I also sprinkled in bacon bits instead of real bacon. My WHOLE family loved it! Kids eating turnip soup and asking for seconds: Priceless :-)

This is very good. I had never had turnips before, and I was a little apprehensive, but they were quite tasty. I wasn't too fond of the greens, but I didn't use kale. I used the tops of the turnips and some other greens I had laying around. I skipped the bacon and I used milk and butter instead of heavy cream. I will make it again.

good flavor in my opinion, my husband said it was ok. Probably would have been better with the bacon, but I didn't have any. I also used 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup 2% milk to cut the fat a bit. I also used chicken broth instead of water and added a bit of garlic salt.
