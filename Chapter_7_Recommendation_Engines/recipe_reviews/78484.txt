This recipe made for a great dish.  I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5, though because I think there may be a mistake.  Eight POUNDS of smoked salmon?  Really?  That's what the recipe calls for, but I'm thinking the writer meant 8 OUNCES.  Number one, 8 pounds would require about $85 worth of salmon.  Number two, I don't think you'd be able to roll it up with that much meat on it!  Anyway, I used about 1/2 - 3/4 pound of smoked salmon, and the flavor was great and well-received by my company.  Thank you for a unique dish.
