Great recipe. I made the butter mixture in a mortar & pestle rather than the processor. Also, I used parmesan cheese instead of the gorgonzola. The flavours really worked well together.

A very tasty dish. The spicy gorgonzola butter is delicious, it melts to the meat if you add it right away after taking the meat off the grill and the way the flavors blend is marvelous!

This was really good and really easy to make. I didn't have gorgonzola so I used Maytag blue cheese instead and it came out great!

Great recipe. The butter has lots of flavor. I made a good amount of butter and also used it on veal chops and pork loin chops and both of those dishes came out very good as well.

Very good!  My fiance didn't even want to try this because he didn't think it sounded good.  Well, he was very pleasantly surprised!  This recipe is a keeper.  I only used one clove of garlic because I'm not a garlic lover, but it was still really good.

The butter spread was delicious!!!  This recipe was easy to make and brought out wonderful flavors in the beef.  I am a *real* novice in the kitchen and this dish made me look like a pro!!!

INCREDIBLE!!!  I can only imagine how good it would taste if I had enough fresh herbs on hand.  I only had 1 TBS of fresh thyme, and had to use 2 tsp dried.  I had all the fresh rosemary, but had to use all dried parsley.  I was a little heavy on the garlic, but followed the recipe otherwise.  SOO GOOD!!  I'm sick right now because I put tons of butter on my fillet mignon...  :)

Wow,this was
delicious. I am not a blue cheese fan so I used parmesan as suggested by another reviewer and my husband and I both could not eat enough.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was phenominal. I served it over filet mignon and my kids literally licked it off of the steak! (We don't go out much for this reason). My husband made yummy noises the entire time. Seriously, amazing. Thank you!

Absolutely wonderful! I love this butter! We made 4 servings of butter & only two steaks so I'm having the leftovers for lunch today on egg noodles...should be good!I made no changes to the recipe except to use a bit of hubby's roasted pepper hot sauce instead of the crushed red pepper & I coated the steaks w/ just tad bit of EVOO before sprinkling them w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder). Started the meal off w/ a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, pesto bruschetta, Asparagus Wrapped in Crisp Prosciutto (from allrecipes), then this fabulous steak recipe & a huge salad w/ Sweet Cherry Soup & Butterball cookies (both are recipes I got from a friend at my cooking forum...Cooking Friends) for dessert. Loved every bite....thanks Ryan Nomura!

I think I would have been happier with just a gorgonzola butter, or just a garlic butter.... there was too much going on in this recipe.

I served this superb butter recipe on my barbecue party buffet table. People spread it on their chicken breasts, roasted corn on the cob and on their grilled crusty bread.  Fabulous flavour and sooo many uses. Definitely will serve again and again.

Excellent recipe. Very easy, with a ton of flavor. I skipped the pine nuts (don't care for them) and substituted blue cheese so I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but nonetheless had great results. Even the guy who "hates and cannot stand" blue cheese thought this was to die for (I just didn't tell him the ingredients =). Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I had to use Smart Balance "spread" because I was out of unsalted butter.  I left out the parsely/garlic b/c I didn't have any and did not add salt/pepper.  I thought it was a little "herby" at first but the more I ate, the move I LOVED it!  Will definitely be making again!

I used a whole tenderloin roast that we
just grilled over mesquite coals. Nothing on it other than s/p and evoo.
We all absolutely loved it!
I am now trying to think of another 
use for the leftover butter. 
I did toast the pine nuts, but otherwise,
followed the recipe. A keeper!

My husband isn't a big blue cheese fan so I had to sneak this one in.  He'll eat it if he doesn't know what's in it.  So he had a bite and said, "This is pretty good."  A great compliment from him!  
I liked it a lot. I couldn't find pine nuts in my rural neck of the woods and it was still great.

The gorgonzola-pine nut-herb butter is the shining star in this recipe.  I used Amish blue cheese in place of the gorgonzola, but that was the only substitution I made.  I am usually a steak purist; just salt and pepper, please.  But this cheese herb butter was beyond fantastic with the filet mignon...delicious enough that I cannot envision eating a filet without it!  Thank you SO much for this recipe!!

Delicious!
I used less herbs than called for (should have done less of the red pepper flakes too) because I was lazy! It was still great and made a good addition to our sirloin tips.

I worked with the herbs and cheeses that I had on hand, and my family (including kids as young as 7) loved it!  My version: used 1/4 C gorgonzola and 1/4 C freshly-grated parmesan; fresh basil instead of rosemary; a little ancho chili powder instead of crushed pepper flakes; no pine nuts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Loved it on our meat.  I'm freezing the unused butter to use later. :)  Oh yummy day!

That compound butter was to DIE for. I made the full recipe amount of the butter but only half the steaks, and used the surplus to put on baked potatoes. We still have more in the fridge that we're using up on toast for the rest of the week. YUM.
