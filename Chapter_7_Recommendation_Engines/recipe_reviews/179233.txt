These were great!  Almost like S'mores.  I made them using the oven/stove method instead of the microwave.  I also broke the graham crackers into fourths when I put them in the bottom of the pan.  When they got set up in the fridge, I flipped them out upside down on parchment and cut them apart where the seams of the graham crackers were.  That makes them perfect finger food sized treats.  Then I store them upside down in the pan so the graham crackers stay crispy (never tried them the other way).  I also take them out of the fridge an hour or so before serving, so the marshmallow/chocolate part are softer.  Everyone loves these!

I LOVEEEEE THIS!! It's soo easy that I let my 5 y/o brother help me make it. Just make sure you spray the pan you make it in because it sticks to it. Also you might want  to let it sit out until it's room temperature before you eat it because when its cold its really hard to chew and scratches up your mouth!

Perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter.  

The only change I would make to the recipe is to use a tad more marshmallows.  Maybe 3 cups total.

Gooooood Stuff! Don't be afraid to use more marshmellows than the recipes calls for; the chocolate layer is thick. Lot's of compliments from the family and they were gone in 24 hours.

So yummy, and super easy and quick to make. I used Honeymaid Graham Crackers, and they worked just fine. After 1 hour in the fridge, cut and placed in container. Graham crackers cut just fine. Will definitely make these again!

I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit. The only thing I do different is melt the chocolate mixture in a double boiler on the stove.

These were great and my 4 year old loved them. I made these when i was trying to clean out my pantry before the holidays so i used Golden Graham cereal instead of the graham crackers. The cereal became stale after a couple of days but it was easy to pick off.They were still good. I rated it 5 stars because the staleness may not have happened if i'd used regualr graham crackers.

Awesome! and super easy, the missionaries that were over dinner asked for the recipe :) I forgot the rice crispies but it was still delish! I did add a few more marshmallows to make sure the crackers were completely covered and my daughter and I thought we could still put more but that's just our preference. I might try it with milk choc chips too.
Update: another reviewer said the crackers went soggy the next day, I have no idea why hers did. I covered my pan with plastic wrap and the were just as good the next day.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated (used the oven method for the marshmallows) except that I didn't put it in the fridge. I learned long ago that its the fridge that makes marshmallows overly chewy. I just let it set up on the counter (if you need it to set faster, put it in the freezer, this will keep the marshmallows from going hard. Pull it out and let it warm up before serving and you'll have a nice texture). The square was good and cut easily, but be warned that it is quite sweet! I like sweet, so I liked this bar.

Used enough marshmallows to cover the gram crackers so I may have put it more than suggested. Either way it was really good.

These were super easy to make, the kids loved them, and they are easy to store.  I (an adult) thought they were a little too sweet but my intended audience gobbled them up and that's what I was aiming for.  I used two 8x8 pans because the 9x13 didn't fit in the microwave, and it worked just fine.  I shaved down a few crackers easily with a knife so the bottom of the pan was fully covered.  I will definitely make these again when I need to please kids!

AWESOME!!!! FYI...I did two batches, one with the peanut butter and one with out (for those who are allergic). The one without the peanut butter was hands down the favorite! I made them for a bake sale and they were the first things to disappear. I am making them again for camping only without the peanut butter it was our favorite too!!!

Like another view said, these are so/so...I will never make them again and you have to eat them the day of, otherwise the graham cracker gets soggy and stale.

Everyone loved this even the adults. Used half a cup of corn syrup. I was worried about it being too sweet but it turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good! Next time I will cut back on the corn syrup, because they're pretty sweet! But, overall..pretty tasty :-)

Made this for a party and everyone loved these, I had to change the recipe because I didn't have all the ingrediance.  I substituted 6 oz of the choc chips with butterscotch chips. And I didn't have marshmellows so I used 16 oz marshmellow cream which I would not use because it was very gooey.With the butterscotch chips it was very simalar to a half smore, half scotcharoo.

The taste of this dessert is okay, however, the cracker crumbles, at any attempt to cut into squares.  So, essentially you have a crumbled mess of graham cracker, instead of a square of dessert.  My kiddos weren't even impressed with this one.  I'd rather just make crispy treats, as they take less time and are less of a mess to cut and eat.

I've made these a couple times for different functions and there are never any left.  Very quick and easy dish to make.  We forgot about a pot luck we were invited to until the morning of....it didn't take me any time to whip up a batch of these and of course they were a hit.

These turned out exactly as pictured. A definite hit on our family campout this weekend. I followed some of the other suggestions listed. I used a metal 13 x 9 pan, lined the pan with foil and used a butter spray for easy removal. I broke each graham cracker in half. I put the pan in the oven for a few minutes to melt the marshmallows. Because they were for a campout and wanting them to be more like s'mores, I omitted the peanutbutter as some of the others did. After cooling the chocolate topping, I lifted out the foil and inverted them onto a cutting board and cut with a chef's knife between each graham cracker and then cut each one in half.  Definitely satisfies the chocolate craving. Yum!

These were okay, family thought it could have been better with regular milk chocolate morsels. the rice crispies didn't have much crunch after being refrigerated, and the graham cracker was soft too.  would just stick with the regular rice crispie bars next time

They were good, not fantastic.  I did not do as the instructions said and cool the marshmellos (to big of a huryy)  I do suggest that you do that though.  If you don't there will be no "layered" effect as the chocolate mixture will blend right in with the marshmellos.  I will make again, just can't say I would crave them.

I made this today for some friends that were joining us for lunch. I also used the oven method instead of the microwave for melting the marshmallows, that way I could make sure I didn't over cook them. It was SOOO Yummy. I could have eaten the whole pan. I only had 8 0z of semi-sweet chocolate, so I used an extra 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate.  I think this was a nice change to the recipe as it wasn't quite so sweet. I will definitely make this again. A side note, I had made coffee and didn't have enough grounds, so my friend mentioned to put open a packet of chai tea to add to the grounds. We drank this while eating th chocolate yummies.  Together they were sooooo goood. It was like Christmas. LOL>

Did NOT like the rice krispy addition- the cereal just got soggy under the layer of chocolate.

YUM!!  Just made these with a few modifications... I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used peanut butter chips and Nutella instead of the peanut butter, plus I added a little cocoa powder (didn't measure).  I did use the conventional method and halved the recipe, but I should have either microwaved the chocolate mixture or used a double broiler (could have been my substitutions, but was not easy to stir or spread -sort of clumpy) all in all it still turned out really good!!  I did follow the suggestion to break the crackers apart then turned over to cut.
