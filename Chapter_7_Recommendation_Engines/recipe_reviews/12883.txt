The flavors in this soup are so delicious and heavenly.  The only change I would make is to make sure you peel the tomatoes before putting them in the food processor to get rid of the skins and make it smoother.

I found this to be the best roasted tomato soup recipe I've tried.  We doubled the garlic to add additional flavor.  We also blended 1/2 the tomatoes/garlic and chopped the other 1/2 to have some chunks in the soup.  Yum!

It had the taste I was looking for.  I used regular tomatoes, not romas.  I only used half of the chicken broth because I wanted it thick.  I felt if I used the full one quart it would have been too watery and less tast.  I also used about 8 or 9 cloves of garlic.  Soooo gooood!!

I love planting, growing, harvesting and cooking tomatoes...I'm not such a big fan of eating them unless they are perfectly ripe or as spaghetti sauce.  I made this strictly because I had bowls of tomatoes - mostly cherry and grape - that needed to be used NOW, and they were just beyond the stage that I would eat them raw.  So, I roasted about 5 Roma and two medium beefsteak, cut in wedges, and maybe a pint and a half each of cherry and grape, leaving them whole.  Doubled the garlic and when it came time to add broth, just used a cup or so of vegetable stock.  I could not believe how delicious this soup is!  And despite the fact that I added no cream or milk, it actually looked creamy!  I didn't mind the skins, as others had mentioned, as the food processor mulched them up pretty good, but it does have lots of seeds that, unless you're in the mood for a real rustic soup, you may want to strain them out before adding the basil.  Tough call though, because if you strain the seeds, you're straining the tomato pulp and pieces of garlic, so I just chose to live with it.  Delicious and healthy, and now no garden tomatoes will ever go to waste in my house - Thank you!!!

Excellent recipes. I would recommend adding the broth a bit at time instead of all at once. That way you can control how thick the soup is.

This recipe is great!    I make this all the time now.  It is a light soup so it is not a meal in itself but the roasted garlic and tomato and the basil just taste so fresh.  Make sure you roast them till they are browning nicely.  Yum!

I'm making my second batch in three days. Last time I used less broth, and was out of basil---but every drop was so delicious! We like it warm. Today I'm doubling the recipe and I plan to keep a batch in the fridge & freezer, because it's not only great as it is but this will make a great base for other soups and for sauces.

The adjective 'hearty' in the title of this recipe is a little misleading. Try 3x tomatoes or 1/3 broth.

My "roasted" garlic was charcoal by the time it spent an hour in the oven, and I drastically cut the stock (used more like 2 cups, not 1 quart). Nice flavour, though, and a great way to use up tomatoes.

This is really good on a dreary, rainy day like today. I only had minced garlic so I placed it in foil & added it about 30 minutes in, so it didn't burn. I put it all in my blender because I don't like the tomato skin. I also de-seeded as much as I could. Used celtic salt & a bit of strong dry garlic because I'm a garlic nut. I used a low sodium chicken powder & heated it with a bit of water in the microwave. Eyeballed the broth because I didn't want it thin. Great recipe, thanks!

I tweaked this recipe and made it Old Mother Hubbard style, and it came out super thick. Having only one pound tomatoes,I used the size bigger than cherry, roasted them with the garlic cloves until they began to split, soaked five sun dried tomato halves in some hot broth, and keeping the tomatoes in their skins, I tossed the works into the blender along with 4oz tin of tomato paste.  I used the full amount of broth.  Added a tbs of garlic soy margarine, and a tbs of pesto. Also, to reduce tomato acidity, I added 1 tsp sugar.  And just for variation, I added a cup of aborio rice.  My soup is super thick, in fact I had to keep adding more liquid as the aborio cooked in the soup.  Amazing. For my daughters lunch tomorrow I plan to add milk, it is soooo thick. Yum :o)

This was a nice soup.  I used veg broth and cut back to 1 cup per the other reviews.  I would prefer a creamier soup but if I have to save on calories this is a keeper.

I had a lot of tomatoes from the garden that I needed to use up, so I tried this recipe. It was good, but not amazing. I added a little cream to the soup and had to add some tomato paste because without it the soup was very runny.

I love this soup. I do use a whole ball of garlic and add tomato paste to thicken it up. I also added some dried tyme and rosemary on tomatoes before I roasted them.

We had this cold for dinner one night. It was a terrific, summery soup that my family enjoyed, and would probably be better hot. Instead of chicken stock, we used water, and three more cloves of garlic. We used very little water and it was thick and tasty. We had a good dinner that night.

Fantastic way to use up garden surplus tomatos.  My family hates tomato soup but we tried this and we all loved it including picky 6 year old and even more picky 2 year old.  i doubled the garlic and left out the vinegar as i didn't have any and it came out perfect.  haven't tried it cold yet becuase there is never leftovers.  Thanks!

I didn't use much oil, no balsamic, & added 1 tsp of agave syrup. I also roasted a head of garlic along with the tomatoes & used 4 of the cloves in the soup. So simple, creamy & delicious!

This was ok.  For all the good stuff in it, I thought the flavor was a little bland.  I only used about half the stock and it was still watery.  I finally added some half and half to it which helped a little.  I won't make this again.

WOW!  I have used this site for many years without posting 1 review (lazy?) but I feel the need to post this!  Outstanding!  I used less stock (2 cups) because I wanted it thicker, & more garlic becuase I am a garlicaholic.  Great recipe!  Amazing!

Amazing recipe!  I didn't have Roma tomatoes, so I used some vine-ripened ones and I removed the peels after roasting.  One of my favorite recipes!

This is easy, quick and better than Safeway!.  I added a bit more garlic and a little less butter.  It's a great way to use up tomatoes that aren't great looking.

Mmmm...so rich, warm and good! I was surprised at how strong the roasted garlic flavor was, considering it's only 4 cloves. I didn't keep an eye on the tray while it was in the oven, and my garlic was pretty well done by the time it had had it's hour roasting time, but I tossed it in the food processor anyway, with no negative affect. I added some whole wheat alphabet noodles in which made it fun for my kids and they LOVED it. Thank you for this easy, totally delicious recipe!

excellent soup, so flavorful!!! I used my vitamix blender to mix everything after roasting (no need to peel tomatoes with the vitamix) so we ended up with a delicious creamy soup.  added the chicken stock a little at a time because we like thick soups.  very tasty!!

Really great summer soup! I followed the recipe exactly, except roasted my tomatoes and garlic for 20 minutes at 400°F instead of an hour (I was short on time). They still had that distinct roasted taste. I also served with avocado garnish and crusty garlic bread. Next time I will peel the tomatoes and remove the seeds, but will definitely be making again!

I added 2 jalapeno peppers to the mix(also roasted) and used only 2 cups of water. It is now my favorite soup and I can't wait to make it again. So good! Thank You!

This soup was so very good! It was so easy to make. I did double the amount of garlic that the recipe calls for. Watch the tomato and garlic cooking time though. Depending on your oven, it takes less than an hour like with me. I will make this again and again.

I made this soup as a first course for a group of 60 women and it was a hit!  I mostly followed the recipe except I added the cloves, skins and all, to the blender with the tomatoes, and made it the day before then I added chicken stock an hour before when I warmed it up and just enough to give it a good consistency.  I will make it again (for myself).

Very good tomato soup.  I also sauted some onions in a few Tablespoons of olive oil.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme from my garden and alittle crushed reds for some kick.

I'm not a huge fan of tomato soup but this was good. I removed the skins, and used an immersion stick to blend the tomatoes with a couple of cups of the stock. I then added the stock a little at a time until it was the right consistency for us. As always, I used white balsamic vinegar. Nice recipe, Rosa. Thanks!

This is a good soup. I didn't blend it thoroughly for a chunkier result.  I also added in 1/2 cup velveeta for a creamy effect.

This soup was the best soup that I ever made. 

I added a little bit of Jamaican pepper and my family finished the entire pot in one day.

The flavors are excellent. There is a little bit of spiciness in the back of your throat, but not enough to make your mouth burn.

Over all, this soup was very tasty, and I will definitely make it again. 

Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Loved this soup! So easy to make, too. I do recommend decreasing the amount of chicken broth to 2 cups, in order to maintain strong flavor, though. Will definitely make again.

Loved it, it was simple, I used more garlic cloves (about 6), and I also added evaporated milk to add creaminess to the soup, I think if I would have used chicken stock, instead of chicken broth I may not have needed to add as much though. Thanks for sharing!!

Easy to make but too intense. The garlic was charcoal at the end of an hour, so next time I will just put it in or 30 minutes or so. I will probably try to soften the intensity with a nut roux or some milk next time as well.

This soup tasted pretty good.  If you want a thicker soup, don't add all the broth, maybe 1/2 of it.  This would be a great base for more hearty versions.  I removed the skins after the tomatoes roasted so it would be smoother.

This was very tasty, and like a lot of other people have said, DEFINITELY add the stock slowly or else it might get too liquidly. I think I only added about one cup.

Not sure if I would call this "hearty", it was more "brothy" to me.  I really had to doctor this one up to make it stand up to my other tomato soup recipe.  It earns three stars just in case it was due to half of my tomatoes being a little bland.

I had lots of yellow tomatoes, this year from my garden and used them instead of red roma's.  I also added one chopped and sauted onion, and about 1/2 cup of feta cheese before I blended up the works.  It so delicious, my husband ate up the left overs for breakfast the following morning!

Very good, will definitely make again.  I like the roasted taste in the soup, so I'll use this one.  Perfect for when basil and tomatoes are still coming, but the weather turns cooler.  Made with cheese straws, nice combo.

This came out terrible for me. Giving it three stars because it was the first time I had tried to make a soup this way, and others said it came out well for them. I loved the idea of roasting the tomatoes first, but it came out too liquid and tasteless.

The best soup I have eaten!  My co-workers are fighting over the leftovers.  The combination of the roasted tomatos, basil, garlic and balsamic vinegar gives this simple soup a very sophisticated taste.

Excellent soup! I used homegrown tomatoes and minced garlic spread over the top with the oil, salt, and pepper. I did peel them before putting them in the processor and to make the soup a little thicker I used a can of cream of ckicken soup instead of the chicken stock. Delicious!

This is a great soup.  I used less chicken broth when I blended it, and then boiled some pastina in the rest of the broth to add a little more texture.  Stirred the two together and it was a winner!  Next time I will add Israeli couscous instead of the pastina... Mmmmm.

This recipes was fantastic! I did use less broth, as recommended but other than that I followed it exactly. It was so fresh and creamy...it went perfectly with my baked grilled cheese (also from this site). I might have to start growing my own tomatoes just so that I have an excuse to keep this around!

I made this soup as directed and it turned out way too thin.  I put it in the fridge and roasted another pan of tomatoes the next night, pureed and added them to the thin soup.  That helped a bit but it was still a little too thin for me.  The taste was great so I will make this again, however I will add the stock a little bit at a time until it reaches desired consistency.

Five stars actually, but I made changes based on my preference for a hearty cream of tomato soup. Doubled the quantity of romas, added roasted garlic, and replaced the oil with light cream (2/3 cup), and the  chicken stock with water. I've made a similar italian vegetable soup that calls for no cream or garlic, but a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, added at the last moment before serving.

Used less chicken stock and removed skins after roasting as suggested and turned out to be a thin tomatoe flavored chicken soup.  Not worth all the time to make.  There are better uses for 2 pounds of plum tomatoes.

This is an awesome soup, and if you use olive oil instead of butter and low sodium chicken broth, the health factor goes sky high. I've made it for several people and I love to watch their expression when they take that first bite! EXCELLENT and easy!

This was delicious.  Helpful hint - when roasting garlic I use scissors and cut the top about 1/4" and peel some of the skin off.  Get out your muffin pan & aluminum foil.  Wrap each head of garlic in aluminum foil & brush with olive oil.  Close at the top leaving a tiny space to open when you want to check your garlic.  When it is ready, let cool, unwrap & your garlic is ready.  No mess, no burned garlic.  Easiest method yet

Delicious flavor. I used heirloom tomatoes rather than Roma and I added a bit of heavy cream when heating it in the stock pot. Next time I make this I’ll use less chicken stock to thicken it a bit more.

Nice flavour, but a little thin. I added about a Tbsp of sour cream and a Tbsp of tomato paste, but didn't thicken it much. I pictured a much creamier soup.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I just use a lot more garlic which is my taste. Otherwise I follow the recipe and eat it cold. I love it. I love gazpacho but that is more time intensive. This is a quick and delicious alternative.

This soup was really relish and super easy to make. I made a few alterations because the recipe disappeared mid-soup but I did my best. Roasted the tomatoes and garlic. Added a couple onions and two potatoes to thicken the finished soup. Then dumped everything in the soup pot, added four cups onion soup mix (I didn’t have any other soup stock) and blended it all up. After it had boiled I added a cup and a half of milk just to make it nice and creamy. Threw in some black pepper, oregano and paprika. The balsamic vinegar was a nice touch that I had never thought of before but it was really good. This is a keeper.

I just took this tomato soup out of the food processor, stored it in a container and it's now in the fridge. Filled a bowl for me to try.  I am totally impressed and will make this again. I followed the recipe and used the 4 cloves of garlic called for (they were large) I love garlic.  I did add the chicken stock gradually until I got it to the thickness I wanted.  It taste great without adding heavy cream or half and half that most recipes call for. and this recipe is healthy.  Roasting the tomato and garlic gives this soup an amazing flavor.  Can't wait for another bowl. Yummy!

Wow!  I'd never made tomato soup prior to this recipe; I couldn't make it better if I tried.  Tomatoes straight from the garden; it is definitely worth the effort.

I made it  following the instructions. The flavor was lovely but ,after putting it into the food processor and "blending until  smooth", the soup was watery and there were little bits of tomato peel  floating everywhere. Next time, I would peel the tomatoes and leave it a little chunky.

super tasty for something so simple.. garlic shriveled up to nothing while roasting so i had to leave that out.. used romas that were on the verge of turning.. used chicken bouillon in place of stock.. and dried basil in place of fresh.. such a yummy soup.. would love to have tried it w/the garlic.. maybe next time i'll have better luck.. ty for the recipe

While this is not a 'hearty' soup as stated in the description, it was wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and loved it...restaurant quality IMHO.  My husband added some hot sauce to his taste but that was not necessary for me.  Might try the suggestions of other reviews to go with a less bit chicken stock (or try vegetable).

This turned out well with a major tweak.  First of all I doubled the recipe, but only used a fraction of the chicken stock called for.   I didn’t want to dilute all that wonderful tomato flavor.  After roasting I pureed it along with some of the stock with my emersion blender and forced it through a fine sieve to eliminate the skin and seeds.  I then added the remaining stock, basil and vinegar, and blended again.  Because I reduced the chicken stock significantly, my double batch only yielded 6 cups of soup.

I  loved the tomato taste, but my family likes more neutral tastes, so I cooked and pureed a large  white eggplant. I had  4 pounds of  tomatoes to the large eggplant. I also followed the suggestion for 2 cups of broth. Can't wait for a cool day and a hot loaf of bread. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe did not work for me at all. I went to the farmers' market and had two pounds of Romas measured out for me, but after following the directions to the letter, I found that the soup was much too thin after I'd added only one 14-ounce can of chicken broth.  If I'd added a quart, the "soup" would have been tomato-flavored water.

So I did not get four servings out of this.  The flavor was good--how can you not love toasted tomatoes???--so I'm going to use three pounds of tomatoes next time and one 14-ounce can of broth.

I joined just so I could post this review.  This soup is phenomenal.  I added only a small amount of stock -- I wanted the soup a little thicker -- and did everything else exactly.  OMG I am going to make this soup every day.
