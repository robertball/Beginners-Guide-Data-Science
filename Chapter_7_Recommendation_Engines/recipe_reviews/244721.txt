The only things I had to change was I had no onions so I used McCormick minced onions about 1 or 2 Tablespoons and had a little bit of New York texas toast croutons seasoned brand that I crushed about a 1/4 cup left and I add a 1/4 cup of water.  This was by far the most moist and flavored burger I had in a while.  I loved it.

I made this exactly per the recipe, adding only 1/4 the called for bread crumbs. My husband thought it needed more ranch seasoning, and he prefers the onion as a slice on the burger rather than diced in it. All said, it was still a good burger for a weeknight meal.

These were very tasty burgers.  Did not use the bread crumbs.  Will make these again.  Did add a slice of cheese.

These were pretty good but next time I'll skip the onion.  For some reason, it almost overpowered the ranch flavor.

I have made this a few times in the past and wow they are crazy good. We had some ground Elk, and Antalope... Yep, and we didn't really want that game taste so we made Ranch Elk Antelope Burgers and they are the best thing EVER!!!
