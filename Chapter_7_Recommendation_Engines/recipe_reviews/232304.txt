Excellent recipe! I really thought that the Old Bay would overpower it but it didn't. I omitted the bell pepper and onion and it turned out great.

Being from the east coast Old Bay is something I grew up with. When I made this coleslaw OMG ! For those who don't care for bell pepper, try using celery instead. I use lemon juice instead of vinegar sometimes to switch it up. Add some shrimp or crab and it's completely over the top. Thanks for posting

I really liked this coleslaw. I dont make it much, because I have to adjust the sugar so much until it isnt as sweet as candy. This one was great with only 2 tsp. I also really liked the addition of the Old Bay seasoning. I had the garlic and herb flavored one and that worked fine. For ease I used a 10oz, un-measured bag of shredded cabbage from Trader Joes. I also used pre-shredded carrots I always have on hand anyhow. I minced the onion and blended with the vegetables I kept separate from the dressing until serving. I tried some with and without the green peppers. I much liked it without. The green peppers sort of make it taste different than classic coleslaw. I would make this again for a family bbq. Only change is, I would probably double it as this only makes about 6 servings. I would also leave out the green pepper and mix in the dressing, again, right before serving. Ty!

This is a very good recipe, and quick and easy to make.  I made the sauce exactly as listed, though used light Miracle Whip.  The Old Bay Seasoning gives it a little bit of a refreshing bite.  I used a bag of shredded slaw cabbage with carrots instead of chopping my own.  The recipe made a perfect amount of sauce for one bag of slaw cabbage.

The Old Bay seasoning is subtle, but certainly recognizable.  Nice option for coleslaw, we liked it!

The flavor on this was very mild. The next time I make it I'm probably going to add more seasoning. I also ended up tripling the recipe to feed my family of six as a reasonable side dish. It's 8 servings if you maintain a very small portion size, which doesn't work for a family of farmers. On the whole though, it wasn't bad. Just needs a little tweaking to serve my family's tastes.

Mixed reviews here.  3 stars and 4 stars so giving benefit of doubt.  Probably due to the mayo vs. Miracle Whip opinions.  Didn't use the bell pepper and would add the suggested celery next time for an added texture and flavor.

I am not a huge coleslaw fan, but am learning to eat it.  This was good and the Old Bay made it a little different.  I halved the recipe and there was too much dressing, so that's something to keep in mind next time.

Had some imitation crab meat and added it to this. Was great. Think real crab would even be better

This is our favorite coleslaw recipe!  I had tried different types of ingredients with my coleslaws before coming across this one.  Sometimes I do add some green, red or yellow pepper if I have some to use up. My husband and I both love it.

The Old Bay makes this different for the usual cole slaw but I really liked it for a change!!  Wonderful flavor!  Not too spicy or too sweet!
