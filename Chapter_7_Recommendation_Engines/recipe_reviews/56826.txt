Changed the injected liquor to suit the tastes of my guests.  Instead of brandy, I injected rum into the strawberries, let them sit for about an hour to marinate, then dipped them into chocolate.  Did not try to add liquor or cream to the chocolate mixture, just dipped them into chocolate that was melted over a simmering water. This recipe is very versatile as you can insert what ever liquor you prefer into the strawberries.  Excellent idea!  These are always requested at girls night.  But as another reviewer mentioned, there are occasions of escaping streams of liquor while trying to inject strawberries.

I've made these twice and learned a few things.  Very Fresh Firm strawberries are best (pay extra for the quality).  1 pound of choc is too much-use 1/2 to 3/4 pound and adjust the added Grand Marnier.  The more GM in the choc, the more is looses it's smooth texture. Don't even try to get 2 tsp of GM into a strawberry unless it's extra huge, settle for 1/2 tsp and move on.   With those adjustments...WOW! This was a fabulous treat!

My friend and I made these strawberries for Valentine's Day as gifts.  I felt the strawberries were too strong and would probably change them by not adding the grand marnier to the chocolate.  Also by not adding the grand marnier the chocolate would have had a more smoother look to it. Or it may just be that orange brandy isn't my type of liquor.  My friend on the other hand loved them.  And people we gave them to as gifts thought they were fabulous.  I also made a batch of plain strawberries just in case people didn't like the bradied ones.  So they were still enjoyable regardless.  I would definitely make them again to give out as gifts. Something to keep in mind... while infusing the strawberries, watch for shooting streams of alcohol :-)

These strawberries last about 2 seconds once you bring them out!  You can only inject about 1/2 tsp in a regular sized berry.  You'd need "frankenfruit" to be able to put 2 tsp in a strawberry.  I used a thin shishkabob stick to make a hole at the middle of the strawberry leaf down into the middle to make more room for the liquor.  Be careful not to poke the hole through the strawberry!

I gave this 2 stars because of all the pain this recipe put me through.  I had to make 3 trips to the store and paid over $35 for chocolate and spent half the day making them.  Great idea for strawberries, but do yourself a favor, just melt the chocolate and DO NOT add anything to it.  Even tempered, the cream and grand marnier will harden the chocolate instantly.  With all said and done, they came out beautiful and they tasted wonderful.

These were very good. I just used dipping chocolate without the other liquids, because I didn't want to mess with trying to keep the chocolate from seizing. I didn't have a syringe in the house, so I took another reviewer's advice and used a skewer. I poked 3 tunnels in the small end of each strawberry, and they stayed upright on the leaf end. I used a pastry tip as a funnel to pour the liquor in. After a half hour in the fridge the liquor either soaked into the strawberries or solidified enough that it  did not leak out when I turned the strawberries upside down to dip.

I made some with rum, some with rum cream, and some with Bailey's. I thought the ones with Bailey's were best, but they were all delicious.

I used 1 pound of milk chocolate with 2 tablespoons shortening.  I also infused the strawberries with Godiva Cappuccino Liqueur.  Let me tell you, these were fabulous!

Roommates barely let the chocolate set before they gobbled them up! I used three different liquors: Grand Marnier, Kahlua, and Bailey's Irish Cream (which we ended up liking the most). Before I injected the strawberries, I used a toothpick to dig a small "well" in the center of each strawberry as previous reviewers have suggested. After I injected the strawberries, I placed them in separate compartments of an empty ice cube tray, which helped keep things neat and tidy. I also didn't add any GM to the chocolate, and opted instead to drizzle the chocolate over the strawberries. Delicious!

I was looking so forward to making these and although they tasted alright they were a pain to make (Sorry!  I planned on about 30 min since it was my first time to make them but I spent the entire day)  I followed the recipe exactly and as soon as I added the Gran Marnier and heavy cream (which both were room temp), my chocolate/shortening mixture thickened up like my chocolate crackle cookie mixture.  I tried to thin it out with heating but ended up throwing it out and making another trip to the store.  This time, I used 1/2 the amt. of chocolate (because I purchased the last of the chocolate that the store had) and once again, it thickened.  I thinned it out somewhat by adding more Gran Marnier and cream but had to keep heating and stirring in order to keep it at a consistency that I could dip my strawberries.

IMPORTANT!!!!! WARM YOUR CREAM TO PREVENT CHOCOLATE FROM SEIZING!!!!!!! Cream brought to just below a simmer will stop it from seizing the chocolate. Cold fat doesn't do well with warm fat.

These strawberries are wonderful!! They do take a bit of work, though.  I made these on 3 different occasions. I used them to garnish a cheesecake.   I used Godiva Chocolate Liquor instead of the Grand Marnier last time I made these.  They were great!
One of my new favorite recipes.

I thought it was hard to infuse the strawberries.  In most of the berries, the liquor just sprayed back at me from the syringe.  As when melting chocolate, use a very low heat, because melting chocolate gets ruined quickly if heat is too high.

Although this is the only recipe for chocolate covered strawberries that includes liquor on allrecipe.com, I really had trouble with it. The brandy tended to squirt out (and Grand Marnier is really expensive), and when I went to make the chocolate it was way to bitter, even with extra cream. I'm not sure what I did wrong but it really did not work out for me.

Too much trouble for results. I have made simplier microwave chocolate covered strawberries that came out better. The strawberries were too mushy and wet after injecting with liquor. The white chocolate didn't add much flavor and didn't melt as easily as milk chocolate.

We made these for a party and they needed a few adjustments. I was only able to inject a max. of 1 tsp. of liquor into the strawberries and those were the big ones. Also, when I added the cream and liquor to the melted chocolate it became clump and did not stick to the berries. After throwing that away I remade the chocolate with just the shortening and it turned out better.

Decadent! Used Grand Marnier because I love that stuff. I just melted regular chocolate chips and I thought it worked fine.

It was definitely more time consuming than I wanted, so I made a short cut: instead of making my own homemade chocolate dipping sauce, I just mixed some Kahlua with whipped frosting (I used cream cheese flavored, but chocolate would have been great!).

These are addicting! I took the advice of CHEFMARGARITA & used a skewer to dig a little tunnel out of each strawberry. A bit time consuming but effective. I used an injector to inject Godiva white chocolate liquer & even though I had tunneled them out, there was still no way I could get 2 tsps in. I refrigerated them for a couple of hours & then just melted semi-sweet chocolate to dip them in. (I had already spent so much time on them & I ws afraid my chocolate would seize if I added liquid). I did not drizzle them w/ white chocolate but if I were serving them to guests, I would for presentation.

Didn't go over as well as I had though however will try this again in the summer. Only took me 30 min to complete this recipes.  Was not hard at all.  However the chocolate was a little thick and I had to brushed the chocolate onto the stawberry.

The best chocolate-covered strawberries I've ever had!  The strawberries were out of season and therefore a tad tart and firm, but the liquor made them seem as juicy and sweet and if it were July.  I did reduce the amount of chocolate since it was way too much - based on other chocolate-covered strawberry recipes I decided on 5 oz. and it was perfect.  I also skipped the cream, cause I like my chocolate dark.  Used the specified amount of shortening and brandy in the chocolate, and injected each berry by feel - no real idea how much but less than 2 tsp.

This is a good idea but turn out to be super messy! I used a flavor injector to infuse the strawberries. they became soggy the next day and really were not all that great. I will make regular chocolate dipped strawberries next time.

I used a 'flavor injector' syringe and found out it depends a lot on the size and type of strawberries as to how much you can inject. Large organic ones worked the best for me, and I placed a dab of chocolate over the hole to hold the liquid in because even after sitting for hours it wasn't completely absorbed. The orange liquor was fun (Grand Marnier) but I also used a whipped cream flavored vodka...very fun as well!

My tips:

1. Just use melted chocolate without adding cream or brandy. (MUCH easier!)

2. I find that I get better results if I dip them in chocolate and let them set BEFORE I inject the brandy.

As others have stated, you can use whatever liquor you prefer. Always get compliments on these.

Tried making these last night. When I added the GM and cream to the chocolate it became a big blob. Could not even dip strawberries. I will omit this step next time. Any ideas as to why this happened.
