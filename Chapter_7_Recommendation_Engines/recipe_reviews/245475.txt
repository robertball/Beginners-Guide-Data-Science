This didn't turn out quite like I expected but it was still pretty good. The tortilla's come out of the oven the first time nice and crispy but are soggy when the come out the second time. They taste good but I would have liked a crispy outcome. These turned out similar to Chilaquiles. If I make again I would probably use a corn tostada shell out of personal preference.

This is awesome! Only thing I would do different is leave the tortillas in for less time in the beginning because when you put them in the second time to melt the cheese they get a little dark. Also the cheese doesnâ€™t melt good but it tastes good. I may use the Mexican blend with cheddar next time.

I mad this for lunch I though it looked good. My family loves it. My husband is mostly vegan so I made his with no cheese and baked chalupa corn tortillas he really enjoyed it. My children and I added the cheese and it was great they definitely want me to make it again. I think next time I will add some green onions to the topping. I thought the shells were great baked however I did flip them and brown both sides that helped with the soggy problem.
