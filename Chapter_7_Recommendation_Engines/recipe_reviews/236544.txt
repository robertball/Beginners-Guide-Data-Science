Tastes good but too much stuff in it for me. I would rather have the simpler version.

I doubled the batch, added a pinch of scotch bonnet hot sauce (Sriracha will do) and DEFINITELY used light brown, not black, soy and No pepper.. The store did not have any bok choy so I had to settle for fresh brussels sprouts... Believe it or not?? The peeled leaves of a few worked perfectly, and were not too strong in flavor. I used a whole carrot and shredded instead of julienne. I also used 1 large clove of garlic and added a pinch of basil. I polished it off with 3 eggs instead of 2 and gave it a touch of pepper spiced vinegar ( rice vinegar preferred ). It was magnificent.. This recipe is very good, but has some development needed.

My daughter wanted Egg Drop Soup like the soup at her favorite Chinese restaurant.  I used a dash of ground ginger in place of fresh ginger and added a dash of granulated garlic.  I doubled the cabbage, added frozen peas, & reduced cornstarch to 1/2 tsp.   It was just like the restaurant!  I will definitely make this again!

Great!  I added mushrooms and used Better Than Bullion Roasted Chicken Base.  Adding the corn starch before the eggs worked great.  Thanks!

I've made this twice. The first time I forgot to pick up the ginger at the grocery store, but it was still really good! This time I made it with the ginger, followed the recipe & the ginger was way too much! All I could taste. Next time I'll just do it without. I also made the recipe bigger than what it calls for, otherwise it's not really that much soup.

Very bland, although that may have been the broth. Will add more carrots, water chestnuts, and mini corn next time, as well as experiment with different broths.
