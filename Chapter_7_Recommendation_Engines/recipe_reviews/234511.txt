I always love it when I’m the first reviewer of a recipe and I can enthusiastically report that I loved it.  And the reverse is also true.  I very much dislike having to review a recipe poorly, and no more so than when I’m the first reviewer. I wouldn’t call it cake – and I wouldn't call it bars either.  It wasn't moist as a cake should be, but it wasn't chewy as a bar would be either.  I rate these two stars because frankly, after trying these we didn’t think they were good enough to keep.

I made this for a "Happy First Day of School" treat. It was easy to make and turned out great! I kept the leftovers for snack bars. I am overall very pleased with the taste. The consistency is somewhere between a cookie and a bar.

This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing. I changed two things that seemed to make this more of a equal split between cookie and cake. I added 1 cup of quick cooking oats (food processed down to flour,substituted for one of the cups of flour). And instead of 1 cup of butter, I used 1 stick of unsalted butter and 1 stick of margarine. Also I like to add one bag of chocolate chips (regular size) and one bag of mini chocolate chips, bc it gives a almost saturated chocolate texture to the cookie cake, and the Kids LOVE it! Excellent recipe!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party, and it was a huge hit.  It is not a cake consistency, so if you're expecting it to have the mouth-feel of a cake, you will be disappointed.  It's more like one of the giant, soft cookies that you get at the mall, which they decorate for birthdays and such.  It was chewy inside, with a little more crisp at the edges.  It was definitely not a bar cookie, either, but it was exactly what I was looking for.  It's the same as the Tollhouse recipe with two extra eggs.  The pieces were about 1/2 inch tall in the middle, a little taller at the sides.  We omitted the nuts, but they would be wonderful.  Thank you for posting!

This recipe is terrible. I had to cook it for 10 extra minutes.  I thought it was done because it sprung back when touched, but turns out it is overcooked around the outside and raw in the middle. Not great since it was supposed to be a birthday cake for my daughter. Now I have to figure out what else to make her. Very disappointed.

The only change I made was to use two eggs instead of four and in a 10x15 baking pan and it turned out perfect. Everyone went back for seconds, and some for even more than that! The consistency is like everyone has been saying-- somewhere between a bar and a cookie. If you're looking for more of a cake, this won't be it!

I really enjoyed this recipe and was a little nervous going into it considering how many people had a bad experience. That being said, mine turned out great and I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was instead of using a 9x13 pan I used a medium sized bundt pan. This is my goto recipe for potlucks and holidays, and now my partner requests this cake at least once a month! I also used delicious dark chocolate my husband brought back from England. I would suggest giving this a try! I always add a touch of cinnamon!

My kids(hubby,kids&grandkids lol) and I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I have made it 4 times now, each time adding different things(toppings, ingredients, sizes, etc) and it's been a hit everytime 8) I was on the fence in the beginning on whether to make it or not bc of some of the reviews I read..... Idk what happened with theirs but I'm sure glad I gave it a whirl.  I've done the following with it so far: First time made it strictly by the recipe & as I said it was perfect for us! 
Second time I added Peanutbutter Chips rather than Chocolate ones...Again Perfect!
Third time  I made it with a combination of both chips and drizzled melted Chocolate & Peanutbutter on the top. This so far has been our favorite as my group loves anything with the combo taste lol!
Fourth(last time) I made the original recipe version but baked them in my Mini Loaf pans( the individual Brownie ones). This would have been perfect but I miscalculated the baking time by about 3-5 minutes (no fault certainly of the original recipe). Although edible, they weren't as moist as the previous ones   
So overall I give the recipe a 5Stars & a Big Thumbs Up! It certainly can be made in many many various  ways as w/most recipes. I will add that the timing is crucial on this recipe but as long as u know how ur oven normally bakes at it should be fine 8) This recipe is a keeper in my goody box8))

I was a little worried about this recipe because some people seem to have had trouble, but mine turned about absolutely perfect. I made this for my son's birthday party and I simply followed the directions, used a glass 9x13 pan, greased it, and it was absolutely perfect! I couldn't be happier! Super easy!

I read a review or two and decided to mess with the recipe. I really wanted a  cake. Like a snack cake. So I omitted one egg and added  a half cup of milk. It turned out delicious and cake like. Yum.

I followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out AMAZING!! The center acts a bit doughy when it’s first pulled out of the oven, but it is actually quite done once cooled. It seemed to me like a chocolate chip blondie, not the cookie I was expecting, but quite a pleasant surprise. All 8 kids who tried it loved it, and I do too! I will definitely make it again.

Baked to the appropriate time, checked for color and bounce as per the instructions. BAM, completely raw inside. You need to cook this thing much longer than stated on the recipe.

I put this on a large pizza pan with sides. I was a little nervous it was going to expand over the edges but it held up. The cake ended up about 1.5" tall. I was a nice compromise for cake and cookie. It was very soft and chocolatey! The family loved it.

They were rather dry and the consistency was more like that of a specialty bread.
