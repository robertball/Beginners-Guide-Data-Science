This should really be called fish balls instead of shrimp croquettes. A croquette is usually a cone shaped product. This is formed into balls and also uses cod. It is impossible to roll the balls in the cubed bread. Use bread crumbs instead.

When working with seafood, I try to follow a new recipe as closely as possible because fish and shellfish are definitely not in my wheelhouse. Overall the flavor was fine, but the amount of salt was far too much. 1/4 of a teaspoon should have been sufficient. Was that a typo originally?
