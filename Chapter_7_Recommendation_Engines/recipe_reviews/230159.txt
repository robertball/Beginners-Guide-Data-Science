OMG, these are delicious and they're not even cold yet!  I followed the recipe exactly, but have had to really watch them in my fan oven!  I had to pull them out well before the first ten minutes was up because they were threatening to burn, so turned the oven down (to 125 degrees C) for the final six minutes.  I would recommend that, if you have a fan oven, lower the heat proportionately.  And watch them closely whatever oven you're using!  I would also suggest that you take them off the foil whilst they're still warm and sticky.  Seems to me they'd be murder to break off if they were left on the foil to get cold.
For my taste, they're not quite spicy enough (although they may become more spicy when they're cold)!  I think there's plenty of cumin, but next time I think I'll heap the quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper and use a little less sugar - perhaps 3/4 of the half cup.  That's just me though - I love spicy but am not so keen on too sweet!
Otherwise, these come highly recommended by me!  Thank you so much for sharing, Chef John!

These are delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I bought a big jug of deluxe mixed nuts that contained pecans, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews and Brazil nuts and measured out four cups of that since this recipe called for 1 cup of 4 different types of nuts. They turned out really well, and are so easy to make. I'm giving them as gifts and will have to make at least another batch, if not more.

These nuts are really good.  Next time I will add a little more cayenne pepper as I like them with a little more kick.  However if giving these as a gift or serving them for friends the spice is just right.

P.S. If you have any kind of juvenile sense of humor, watch the video (I used to teach Jr. High, I can't help it).

Love, love love these.  Very addictive.  I did change the prep a little as I couldn't see how the spices would evenly distribute if applied directly to the nuts, so I stirred them into the butter mixture before I put it on the nuts and mixed.  I also made sure I loosened them from the foil and broke them apart while they were done and still warm.  Have made several times and will make them again.  Thanks for the post.

These were ok but could be alot better. I didn't read any of the reviews first so didn't see that you should NOT let the nuts cool in the pan. So I did let them cool in the pan and they turned into a solid block of  nuts!I had to literally pry/hack them apart and then try to peel off the foil bit by bit. A total disaster. I then just reheated them in the pan to soften them and was able to get most of them out but it wasn't easy. So be SURE to put them in a bowl as soon as you take them out of the oven. Secondly there's just not enough spice. I added a little more of everything and they still tasted way too mild. If I made these again, I would put double the spices and salt (if not more) and add garlic powder. 1/4 tsp? That's just not enough. You can heat the butter and sugar mix in the microwave instead of on the stove. I would also add the spices to the butter next time instead of on the dry nuts so it blends better. I liked the fact that these were not too sweet.

Yummy!  Made this twice over the holidays, and everyone loved them.  First batch used almonds and walnuts (still 4 cups total) with smoked paprika instead of cayenne (only because I'd never used smoked paprika, and wasn't sure how much heat it had already).  They were really good ... my husband's first comment was "tastes like bacon" !  Second batch used cashews and almonds, with all seasonings as listed, plus a teaspoon of smoked paprika.  We liked this batch even more, and can't stop eating them!  For the people that mentioned them "sticking together", I suggest you missed watching the video, which explains that when you take them out of the oven to stir, it's a thorough 3 or 4 minute process ... not a quick stir like when you're making party mix.  After that cooling and stirring, I had no sugar/spice mixture left on the parchment sheet I used, meaning it was all adhered to the nuts as it should be.  After the final baking and cooling, every nut was perfectly coated and separate as they should be.  Great recipe!

I made three batches, the first as the recipe states, the second I made Cajun spiced, the third I made Chipotle spiced and put some dashes of Worcestershire and Hot sauce in the sugar mixture...boy did that add a nice flavor. This is one of the easiest spiced nuts recipe I've ever made...get creative with it and add whatever spices you like.

DO NOT LET THESE COOL ON THE FOIL!! These nuts taste great, but the are really hard to get off if you let them cool on the foil, even if they are well separated. Parchment paper may also be the way to go, as another reviewer suggested. 
Other than that, these are easy to make and tasty, so I'll probably make them again. I might reduce the salt next time and mix them with pretzels before serving

We loved these nuts.  If you had problems breaking them up, try separating them a little more before they go back in for the last six minutes.  As Chef John stated in his video, you could use any varieties of spices.  Since cumin isn't my favorite, I used a specialty mix of Cajun spices gifted to me by my friend ~Lissa~.  I might try adding the spices to the butter/sugar mixture to see if it will more evenly coat the nuts and then the salt at the end.  These would make a very nice hostess gift as stated by other reviewers.  I would also perhaps like some snipped rosemary added to these.  Thanks for this recipe!  Yum!

Excellent, easy & delicious treat! Making second batch for holidays (& may take some to the movies!) to share with friends.  Recommend using Silpat type baking sheet liners- no problems with sticking & cleans up easily. Bought nuts in large bags at Costco, or could buy in bulk (if fresh?)- enjoy!

These are very, very good and simple to put together.  I get asked for the recipe every time I bring them to a gathering.  Occasionally I use brown sugar instead of white sugar and sometimes add some tabasco sauce for an extra kick.  If you use store bought mixed nuts, you can reduce or eliminate the added salt in the recipe.  I recommend stirring them occasionally as they cool to keep them from sticking together too badly. Definitely worth a try!

I wanted to replace the intensely sugary spiced pecans I always make as Christmas gifts and tried this recipe. I was concerned that friends would be disappointed with a healthier gift, but not for long. These were a HUGE hit! Initially I thought they needed more spice but the second batch I did add more and now I'm back to the original mix. I DO add an extra cup of nuts, filberts and macadamias, because there's plenty of syrup to coat more. This will become my new holiday tradition!

Made exactly as written except that I used parchment paper. As it cooled I occasionally mixed it to prevent any sticking to the sheet and to each other. Worked like a charm. Very delicious, have already gotten 2 requests for the recipe!

Awesome recipe!!!!!!!! Love the combination of flavors. If someone has a problem with them sticking to aluminum foil, I recommend using the only foil I ever use: Reynold's non-stick. Then you have no worries and no complaints.

USE PARCHMENT PAPER NOT TIN FOIL!!! Seriously, parchment paper is my best friend! I never use tin foil anymore, haven't for years. Makes a HUGE difference. Recipe is awesome! What I like about it is it's a good base recipe. You can add or decrease any spices. Chil powder is awesome to add as well.

Awesome! Awesome! And addictive! These things are killer-good. Followed recipe EXACTLY. If you listen carefully to Chef John's instructions, you will have no sticking problems, even with foil.  And as the man said, you can tailor seasonings to your tastes. I enjoyed reading the variations suggested by others. Thanks C.J., for another "keeper".

Excellent.  Used non-stick foil and had no trouble at all.  Did stir during cooling.  Used Old Bay instead of cumin...just a personal preference. As did another reviewer, I used 4 cups of deluxe mixed nuts.  Because of this, I did omit the salt, which I found to be just right for us.  My husband can't stop eating them.

Easy recipe. I took the advice of others and added the spices to the butter/sugar mixture. I thought it needed more spice after tasting the  mixture, so I doubled the pepper and cayenne. I also added a few shakes of cinnamon. Bake on the parchment paper - that avoids sticking. Stir again when out of oven. I sprinkled the nuts with a little more cayenne and sea salt while cooling. Perfect!

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I followed the directions exactly and loved it!  So good!  Today I used chipotle chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, and added a little paprika with a little less cumin and they also came out delicious.  I used non-stick foil and didn't have a problem with sticking at all in case that helps anyone out.  I'd definitely make these again, and they made great gifts for teachers and our mail carrier.

I guess I'm Jr High cooking level as I overcooked the first batch abit.  Upon seeing the video Chef explained that the little nuts need to remain together.  I single layered mine right out and poor lil buggers are too toasty.  I was watching the timer like a hawk!  Thankfully my husband of 28 years has acquired a taste for "over done".  

Batch 2 (AFTER seeing the video) was much better. It gave me an eye for the visual of finished product!  Keep an eye on the oven!  Nothing should get too dark.  I like the addition of worcestershire.  I splashed in 1/2 teaspoon in.  Otherwise held true to recipe.

Wow - HOT!  Chef John likes his cayenne pepper!! I also added 1/2 tsp cumin & 1/2 tsp coriander & 2 tbsp. honey  which my favourite brought nuts have on them!  However, the honey probably made them more sticky! Next time I would cut in half the cayenne and maybe just add an 1/8 tsp coriander & cumin and add more salt.  I'm not in real spicy things, and I felt the spicyness took over the sweet & saltyness.  Otherwise great idea.

Very tasty but I didn't get the pretty glazed look that is shown in the photo.  Mine have sort of a crystallized sugar look, but they don't taste grainy.  They taste great.  Any suggestions for me?  I'd like them to look glossier.

I have to laugh.  Made these for the holidays which we all loved, but I was watching Chef John’s video and my husband,from the other room, was like “I don’t know what you’re watching but all I’m hearing is “it’s ok if your nuts are touching!” Hahaha. So funny. Thanks John for yet another great  keeper.

OMG can I tell you how good these are! I made a batch for a baby shower and they were half gone before I was able to put them away. Had to make a second batch. I baked them on parchment paper for exactly the time prescribed and they were perfect! No trouble with sticking to the foil or stirring them in the middle. Definitely making these again.

Made exactly as recipe states. Thought they had just the right amount of sweetness; maybe could use a lttle more spice for my taste but otherwise excellent and easy to make. Just watch them closely so they do not burn. I took mine out of the oven 2 minutes early and they were just slightly overdone but still tasted great! Will definitely make again!

These nuts are always a hit. I've made them two or three times now for parties. I'm quite the chili head so if you want extreme heat, here is what I do - and 1/4 tsp ghost pepper hot sauce (Daves Insanity) and 1/4 tsp of Cajohns Trinidad (Scorpion) Hot Sauce to the mixture and then mince 2-3 habanero and 1 large red jalapeño peppers with membrane removed and sprinkle in some ghost pepper flakes when coating the nuts. People still eat it up and my wife and I love it. Delicious!

I realized I never reviewed these. This recipe is amazing. The only thing I have changed is what I put the sweet and spicy mix on...almonds, pecans, peanuts...I keep changing the mixture. Well and I add a bit more cayenne. I posted a picture of pumpkin seeds because I used this recipe for Halloween this year...the only difference with the seeds is that I cooked it for 30 mins. As others have said, do not let it cool on foil. So good!! As usual with Chef John's recipes. :)

Pretty tasty recipe! I used parchment paper as another reviewer suggested and I also set the nuts outside for a few minutes to cool faster.  I did stir them around every couple of min also.  They were not sticky at all!  Yum

Very easy recipe to make.  My guests liked the nuts, especially the mild spicy aftertaste.  I did have a little bit of a problem with the nuts sticking together in the bowl, maybe I didn't roast them for long enough?  I just put a metal serving spoon in the bowl with the nuts so guests could sort of jab at the nuts to break them apart.  They were delicious nonetheless.

For our humid Florida weather, I used "sugar in the raw" and reduced it to 1/4 cup.  This ensures the nuts do not become too sticky.  I also put all spices in with water sugar and butter so it combines well.  I always have these in my refrigerator.  They are THAT good!

Delicious. Once on the pan I sprinkled the spices over it again (same ones in the recipe) and I added a dash of brown sugar. I couldn't keep my guests out of the mix

This is fabulous, and easy. As someone suggested, I mixed the spices in with the glaze for better distribution of spice. I read many of the comments and took the advice to be sure to take the nuts off the baking sheet immediately after the second baking. I stirred them around, dumped them into a bowl and broke them up by hand, then onto a cold, sprayed baking sheet to cool further, breaking them apart frequently. Each batch made two and a half pint jars (I made four batches as gifts). The spice was just right for us. Has anyone ever made these ahead and frozen them for later use?

I was hoping they would have a kick to them, I should note I used Berbere & tasted the spice ahead of time to make sure it was going to be spicy.  Mostly tasted sugar & a little bit of salt.  Next time I'm going to reduce sugar a bit & up the spice. I added the spice to the sugar mixture right before adding nuts to ensure all nuts were evenly coated.  I also used a Silpat.  Overall these were okay & will make them again with some changes.

I made these for a friend's Thanksgiving day get-together and they were a big hit.  I didn't bother measuring the nuts; I just eyeballed them.  Everything else was done as written.  I did find the nuts were a bit sticky to the aluminum foil, but folding the foil off the nuts worked fine.  The nuts came off in big sheets which were easily broken down by hand.  

I really liked the "slow heat" of the spiciness; I'm very sensitive to that type of heat, but was able to tolerate this well and really enjoyed them.  My friend is already asking for me to make them again, and Thanksgiving was just four days ago!

This is exactly what I was looking for. I started with a large container (30 oz.) of Mixed Nuts with sea salt so I omitted the salt that was called for. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they are wonderful!

The nuts taste fine enough, but the foil stuck to the cookie sheet and the nuts stuck to the foil (yes, I oiled it).

This is the recipe I've been looking for, for years!  The glaze is perfect, and I like the little cayenne kick.  I used parchment paper instead of foil, and had no problem getting the nuts off the sheet when they were still a little warm.  I have scads of walnuts, and I'm always looking for good ways to cook them.  This is one of the best yet!  Thank you, Chef John.

I made these the day before a party and left them out on the counter. My family ate all of them as soon as they cooled. I had to make more for the party the morning of, and once again my family ate most of them. That's how good these were. Followed the recipe exactly. My family told me I could open a peanut shop, sell these, and make a fortune-- thanks for the great recipe. They were the biggest hit at the party (thankfully the guests were able to eat some before my family did) and will definitely be a pantry staple when we buy nuts in bulk. Work great with only walnuts too.

Not sure what possessed me to purchase raw mixed nuts. w/ NO seasoning but they were so boring! I  could not decide if I wanted salty, spicy, sweet and this had it all.  I'm avoiding sugar as much as possible so i subbed cinnamon and just a teaspoon of swerve (erythritol). Very tasty & satisfying.  Plan to make more. I gave 4 stars only because I have nothing to compare them to since this is my 1st attempt at seasoning nuts.

Every year at holiday time I make two batches of "Sugar Coated Pecans" from this site.  They are outstanding.  But since I know so many people who love a little spice with their snacks, I thought I would try these for those folks.  I followed Chef John's recipe to the letter, started the baking at 350 for the required ten minutes, returned to the oven for the required six minutes, and when I took them out of the oven, they were not-ready-for-prime-time.  They were dripping and the nuts were still soft.  I turned to the pecan recipe I usually make, and turned down the oven to 250, and stirred the spicy nuts every ten minutes until the syrup/sugar mix was  absorbed and the nuts were crunchy.  They were delicious.  And my spicy friends loved them.

These are very good and easy to make!  If following Paleo diet replace the sugar with Maple syrup, that's what I do sometimes, and equally as good.  Play around with the seasonings of your choice and add a splash of vanilla with cinnamon for a sweeter version,

This was really easy to make and it turned out great. The key is like some other reviewers and the video instructed: stir the nuts for 3-4 minutes to prevent them from sticking together! I didn't have any problems. Also use parchment instead of foil.

The spices, once butter/water/sugar combo is added, is very watery.  I wasn't entirely sure I was making it correctly.  I wish it mentioned this in the recipe so I had an expectation.  I did not watch the video - so it may have been apparent on the video.

I did these for the very first time today because I've been looking for a really good recipe for sweet and salty nuts, and I definitely found a keeper!!  These are fantastic!!!  I did change it up a bit though and it was flawless!!  Like some of the other comments here, I heated up all the spices, butter, water and sugar all together!  Instead of just white sugar, I did half white and half brown and also added about 2 tbls. of real maple syrup, just a tad bit more coarse salt and a dash of garlic powder to the recipe.  Then, instead of pouring the mixture over the bowl of nuts, once the mixture was bubbling a bit on the stove I added the nuts to it and cooked for one minute, stirring constantly and then poured in on the parchment papered cookie sheet.  Once finished roasting and out of the over, I stirred a number of times to make sure there was no sticking and then transferred to another cookie sheet to finish cooling, still stirring a few times.  They turned out perfect with absolutely no sticking together!!  Now I have to somehow save then for company on Christmas Eve!!

Followed the recipe except for adding the spices to the melted butter/sugar mixture.  Be sure to watch the video.  I transferred from the foil lined pan onto parchment paper as soon as I took them out of the oven.  

Everyone raved about the nuts and I was asked for the recipe.  Just the right amount of spice for me.  These would make a great hostess gift!

Just made these and they are too delicious.  Hope I have some left for my guests tonight.  I hid them, but I know where they are.
I used pecans, almonds and hazelnuts and added a wee bit more pepper.  
Thanks for the recipe.

Next time I will mix the seasonings together in a small bowl and put the nuts in a plastic bag and toss them with the spices. The spices did not cover evenly by mixing in the bowl. Was delicious! I had lots of compliments on theses.

These are the best nuts, just the right amount is sweetest and spice. I used 3/4 teaspoon each  cayenne pepper &  cumin . The technique is spot on. Beautiful, delicious tasting with just enough kick!  I did these in my wind oven and turned them after 10 minutes then back in the oven for 10 more minutes  turned again then back for 7 minutes. I removed from the pan and cooled on parchment paper being careful to separate large clusters. I will be making these again for sure.

Tasty. Not very spicy. More like a mild heat on the tongue. I did add 1/8 tsp smoked paprika to the mix. Used Fernsong's method of adding spices to the butter mixture then coating the pecans. I also subbed pure maple syrup for half of the sugar.  Not too sweet, but enough.  Easy cooking method.   Personal preference; would up the cayenne to 1 tsp. and maybe use brown sugar instead of white next time for richer sweetness.  Another good recipe by wonderful Chef John.

10 stars!!  This is so easy and delicious. Used peanuts instead of walnuts because that was I had. Any nut will work. Easy cleanup.

This recipe was surprisingly easy to make. I added a bit more salt and cayenne pepper than the recipe called for as I wanted a bit more kick. As others have said, do not let the nuts cool on the foil.

I've made this recipe several times as-is (once I added more cayenne for additional kick, 8 year old didn't like it). Its DELISH! I've also doubled the recipe...they're VERY addictive!  I added the spices to the butter/sugar mixture for even coating and used parchment. Just let it cool on the pan and get ready to pig out!

I found that adding corn starch (tsp) to the water made the spices -water-butter mix better sticking on the nuts before putting in the oven. 
It was a bit spicy for me, I will try it again with different spices and I would like to have sweet glazed version and savory version with light spices

I have made this type of recipe many times.  It gets better and better.  This time I added equal amounts of cardamom as cumin.  Adds something extra to the flavor.  Use parchment and stir often, even while the mix is cooling.  Also I add 1.5 x the seasoning to pick up the flavor.

This recipe is the best! I've made it twice in one week for the holidays! I added a little more cayenne pepper the 2nd time. Parchment paper the way to go! They won't last long at any gathering, trust me! Karen

These nuts were literally gone in 3 minutes at a party when I set them out.  Maybe even 2. My doubts about the cooking technique proved pointless. (I seem to have had an issue that others didn't with the method.  After the second six minutes, the oven smelled of pepper and not roasting nuts. I stirred/left/stirred the nuts and watched them carefully, finally deciding they were done after TWENTY MORE minutes. They were really coated/sticky and I lost a few to the foil (couldn't separate).  Next time, after the first 10 mins, I'll drain off the sticky stuff in the pan, plus they won't harden so firmly to the pan when cooling. )

I made this using maple syrup instead of white sugar and water.  They are fabulous, if a little spicy but that suits our taste.  The trick is to keep stirring as they cook. I used parchment paper and clean up was a breeze. No sticking.

I took these to a party and everyone loved them.  The only thing  I left out was the cumin.  You can really tweek the spices to adjust the heat but there were good with following the amounts in the recipe if you don't like a lot of spice.

Not enough spice by a long shot. I increased spices on my 2nd batch but still not enough. I compared this recipe to my sister's spicy recipe and I see the problem. (For instance--4 cups of nuts here with 1/4 t. cumin. That would equal maybe 1 grain per nut? Other recipe has 4 c. nuts with 1 T. cumin.) The technique described in this recipe works for me so I will use it. Use parchment paper ---no sticking even when completely cooled.

2nd batch just came out of the oven, and dang they are good!  Followed the directions exactly on the first batch, and then substituted Chipotle powder for the cayenne on the second along with a dash of worcester added to the sugar mix.  You HAVE to stir these thoroughly (I used a spatula) after the first 10 min to get as much of the sauce onto the nuts as possible.  And when done, I remixed again thoroughly; by the time I was done, there was no sauce left in the baking sheet.  Also helps if you spread them WAY out on wax paper to cool... saves time breaking them apart.

I love these nuts!  Making my 4th batch now-using my favorite walnuts, pecans and sliced almonds to equal the 4 cups.  I've added ginger to the spices ,  and I dump all the spices into the pan with the sugar and water, boil it all a few minutes, and then stir thru the nuts.  Follow original recipe from there.   I enjoy a half cup with my morning yogurt daily. :-))

Very easy to prepare... makes great hostess gift. I cooked these on parchment paper and had no "sticky" problem. They're cooling now -- I don't know if I can wait!

Delicious, but I made them for friends that don't like sweet things. The first batch was a little sweet and not spicy enough for me. The second batch I doubled the cayenne and cumin and cut back a little on the syrup. Much more what I expected. To prevent sticking I would also suggest not using the foil and stir them several times immediately after you take them out of the oven as they cool.

The first time I made this (yesterday), I used almonds, cashew halves and left out the cumin. I paired these with a bourbon vanilla caramel sauce in gift baskets  and cumin didn't fit in. I'm making it again tonight for more gifts and I'm using cashews, almonds, pecans, and peanuts. This time I'll leave out the cumin AND the black pepper. It's just too dominant a flavor for me. I really just prefer the cayenne for heat. The cooking method is quick, easy, and I had no problem whatsoever with it sticking. I followed the recipe for the caramel, the prep, and the cooking time and it worked beautifully for me. Humidity does play a factor so that may have been the problem for some folks.  Awesome recipe. :o)

I poured all of the dry spices into the sugar/water/butter mixture and let that all simmer together; I also added about 1/8 tsp of dried rosemary that I crushed between my fingers, and also added just a short shake of ground cinnamon from the bottle  as well.  I poured that warm mixture over the nuts and stirred until they were saturated.  Followed the rest of the recipe but after the 10 mins of cooking in the oven I lightly dusted the entire batch with more cayenne pepper and stirred some more (you can over-dust if you don't know what you're doing.)  Topped it off for the last 6 mins of baking and now they are cooling on the stove for my husband to find when he gets home from work!  I know he will love these!  (I sure did!!)

Excellent!  I add a bit more chili powder for extra zing.  If using a nonstick cookie sheet, the foil is optional.

I went to a swanky bar years ago, which served nuts similar to these, and I've been dreaming about them ever since. Now that I've made these nuts, I'm in heaven. I've found the recipe to the nuts of my dreams. The only thing I did differently was to double the amount of cayenne pepper (after reading some of the comments) and the nuts are perfect! Thanks for the recipe AND video!

Simple way to make a great treat.  I'm adding it to my recipe box with notes to spice things up next time.  I would definitely add more cayenne as a personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved them.  I added cranberries to mine.  hen they came out of the oven I also removed them from the tin foil onto another pan and stirred them every few minutes or so during cooling so they remained separate.

Great Recipe!  You need to bake them longer though.  More like bake for 25 - 30 minutes; stirring every 10 minutes.

hahaha, chef john i SOOOO love your sense of humor, and i love your recipes even more!  i've made these about 4x now, and the only thing i change is that instead of almonds i use peanuts (they're way cheaper!), and i add a very healthy dose of chipotle pepper, cuz thats the way we roll.  highly recommend, don't pay outrageous "gourmet food store" prices for delicious nuts like this, make these instead.  they're SOOOOO easy, delicious, and not exhorbitantly priced to make yourself.  we all are really lucky to have chef john and ar.  thanks!

The recipe was easy to follow.  Flavour was delicious and enjoyed by everyone.  I would add a bit more cayenne next time. However, I had to bake it for almost 20 mins before it got to a nice golden brown colour and all the liquid got absorbed.

This is a killer recipe for mixed nuts.  I amped up the spice a bit (not quite doubled) and followed the directions exactly.  It's important to mix and stir the nuts after the 10 minute baking time as directed until the glaze is incorporated into the nuts completely.  Had to ration these!

I'm no longer including cashews and almonds because they are much more dense than pecans and walnuts and require either a higher or longer cooking time. I also bumped the oven temperature up to 375 for an additional 12 minutes to get much crispier results. The Walnuts had the best results as their surface area is such that the seasoning packs into the gaps.

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a gift idea for my dad for Christmas.  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, then I read the reviews.  The only reason there are four stars and not five is the cooking method.  I agree with other reviewers -  remove the mixture to a glass bowl while it's still warm. Otherwise it's practically impossible to get it out of the pan when it's cold and if the syrup gets under the foil, it's almost impossible to clean the pan.  I thought the finished product was great though.  My dad ate it all in about three days.  Per other reviews, I would also add the spice mixture to the melted butter mixture instead of directly on the nuts.

These are so tasty! Served them on New Year's Eve and they all disappeared. Would recommend making a double batch if you have a large crowd. I used mixed unsalted nuts from Costco and it worked great.

I looooove spice, so I added about 1/2 tsp of creole seasoning, a few dashes of chili powder, and a few shakes of cinnamon. 
Made these earlier today for the family to snack on and they're already gone!

I would definitely use parchment or wax paper instead of foil as I had a problem with the nuts sticking to the foil. Next time I make these, I will up the spices a bit as these were more sweet than spicy for our taste. That all said, these are very good and addictive.

The best!   Everyone has loved it!   First pass I followed recipe.    Was good but I thought more pizzazz would be better.  So next round I added more  cayenne and more cumin.  I used Trader Joe’s grinders for both lemon pepper and garlic salt!   Fab!   Today I tried adding some Worcestershire and we’ll see.   Super yummy.   Also first time I used deluxe mixed nuts, raw.   Next time I used roasted unsalted and I think they were better.

Easy to make but not as spicy as I expected so will increase the cayenne pepper or may ale add some Tabasco sauce. 

The cumin imparts a rather stinky smell so I will Drop it from the recipe next time

This recipe results in spiced nuts with a nice light sweetness and excellent crunch!

I made these a few minutes ago & they are great!  I used parchment paper and had no stickiness problem.  Followed the recipe to a "T" except I got a jug of mixed nuts that included peanuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts and pecans.

Will definitely make again!

I cut the recipe in half just to test out the flavors before I made an entire batch.  The flavors are good; not too spicy, not too sweet.  I can see where people who are used to a sugar cinnamon coating would find these to be odd.  Hubby, not a nut lover, liked them.  I would definitely make them again.  Nice recipe, Chef John.

The end product is delicious, but....
If you use untoasted nuts, it takes 20 minutes of oven time to get the cashews, walnuts, and pecans to taste delicious. Otherwise, they are not crunchy.  The spices and syrup are perfect. Be sure to taste the 'finished product' as the recipe suggests before you serve the nuts because they can be starchy and chewy.

These nuts are fantastic and are now my go-to Christmas goody to give to my family and friends.  I'm glad I read several reviews before beginning as it helped know what to expect.  So I used a Silpat mat on my baking sheet and had absolutely no problems with the nuts sticking.  I also added all the spices to the butter sugar mixture as I thought that would make for better distribution and it worked well.  I immediately transferred the finished nuts to another baking sheet lined with Silpat mat for faster cooling.  The nuts will tend to stick together at this point so just break them up with your fingers once cool enough to handle.  These are not very spicy at all so if you prefer spicier flavor, double up on the spices.  Delicious!

I made 90 servings as I had 2 x 1.13 kg jars of deluxe mixed nuts. I halved the cumin as I am not a huge fan and omitted the salt since my nuts were salted. I baked for 20 minutes, stirring and turning the pans halfway through. They were still pretty wet, I turned off the oven and left in for another 20 minutes which was perfect. I lined with parchment paper which made it very easy to stir and break up the nuts. Taste was good, at first I thought no spicy at all but it snuck up, I think chipotle powder would be nice too as it would add a smokiness to the nuts. I hope everyone enjoys this addition to their Christmas baskets.

WONDERFUL!!!   Perfect balance..  not too sweet.. not too spicy.  made it with walnuts and pecans ( I have picky people who only eat certain nuts)..  It works perfectly..  I did not have a sticking problem.  I stirred them when I got them out the last time and set the timer again for 5 minutes and stirred them again..  no problem..  I love them warm and if I still have any left, I am sure I will love them cold.

These are awesome, and your guest will love them.  I strive for an equal balance in flavors, because you’re might not always know your audience.  I like sweet/ hot, while my relatives like salty/ savory, so I try to give just a little to everyone’s taste buds.  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: reading reviews, everyone talks of sticking.  I had no problems and here is why. He says to stir the nuts and hot mixture 5 minutes until the liquid starts to stick to the nuts.  This is key.

My family absolutely loves these! First, I made the recipe as written and the mix was so good I started experimenting. Now, I substitute the almonds with pistachios and add dried cranberries and dried cherries to the mix. The fruits are delicious after baking with the nuts and the spices (I used chipotle pepper, coriander and cumin) and this is the combo we like the best. This one is a keeper for us!

These are so delicious!! Definitely use parchment paper. I use extra spices because I like the after burn. I also bake a little longer so they aren't as sticky.  Always a hit and keep well.

This is the absolute best technique for spiced nuts because boiling the the sugar and butter makes a glaze that helps the spices stick to every single nut. With every other recipe I've used there is inevitable a pile of spice at the bottom of the bowl. Not with this recipe. Flavors worked well together, too. I added 1/4 tsp of cardamon because it adds a warm smokiness.

I did not have cayenne pepper but added smoked paprika.  I used unsalted nuts.  The recipe needs more salt than what is indicated for my taste. I could not add garlic salt or garlic powder or onion powder because one person who may eat these nuts has allergies.  Still rather bland. Added pepper and Maggi seasoning and curry powder.  Could not add Worcestershire because it contains onions. Next time I make a batch just for my husband and me, I will add garlic salt and Worcestershire.  I think this would be good also dusted in Ranch dressing powder and omit some of the other spices. I will also go a buy a small container of Cayenne, even though I don’t like very spicy food.  It’s fun to experiment.

I used pecans, peanuts, cashews, almonds and some macadamia nuts.    I gave them as part of  gift baskets to co-worker and got rave reviews.   Next time, however, I will increase the nuts -to-coating ratio; they were a bit too moist

Excellent recipe, I always double it as they are a huge hit.  I use the Costco salted mixed nuts (remove the Brazil nuts) and omit the salt.  Using parchment paper is the only way to go.  Love the kick of the cayenne but when I’m making them for the grandkids I only use about half the cayenne.  Excellent recipe!  Always get asked to share it...

I just made my first batch an it was easy and delish!  I have to be careful not to eat the whole batch in one setting.  I keep going back.  I think some one mentioned in their review while cooling the nut begsn to stick together.    I decided to let set for a few then stir again so the nuts separate and continue to cool. Worked fine

I didn't make it but, even better, I sent the recipe to my sister and she made it and I got to eat it! It was for a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it. A wonderful recipe without too much heat for those of us who don't like super spicy food. Highly recommend it.

Would definitely "spice" it up a bit next time.  Even double the spices as others recommended!

I accidentally made more glaze than I should have, but it was delicious!  The seasoning is nice...even my non-spicy loving family loved these nuts.  Next time I'll try other flavor combinations...maybe with some fresh rosemary.

They're really good!  So addicting that I had to put them in the cellar so I'd still have them for Christmas!
The only thing I would do differently would be to use a lot more spray on the foil as the nuts stuck to it.

My first try at making spiced nuts and they turned out delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but added 1/8t of smoked paprika. I’m glad I watched the video because I think stirring them for a full 5 minutes after the first 10 minutes of cooking is key to not having them stick to the foil. (I used heavy aluminum foil which I sprayed). Once out of the oven I transferred them right away to two vinyl cutting boards.

These will be the best when I double the spice- the cayenne pepper and more so that they have a bit more zing. But the pecans and walnuts are a great combination. Great topping for salads, too.

Make these every year for holidays.  Couple of recommendations -- put the spices in the butter, sugar, water mixture and cook -- they spread more evenly on the nuts.  

Don't use foil -- use parchment paper -- much better for cooling and removing from pan!

This recipe for sweet-salty-spicy nuts is THE best!  I made the simple syrup and my spices were coarse salt, ground pepper, dried minced garlic and garlic powder.  WOW.  I gave some to a friend who was supposed to share them with her husband, but she ate the contents of the entire container!  He did not get 1 nut!  Shame on her!  She said they were SO good, so delicious, that she could not help herself!

Just made this for the first time and my husband can't stop eating them. I followed the recipe as instructed. Once it came out of the oven at the end, I let it cool for 3 mins then stirred it up. I probably stirred it a about 3 times but it didn't stick at all.

Definitely will make it again; so easy and tastes great as written. Very helpful tipsters regarding removal from pan before cooling; mine turned out perfectly after cooling on parchment paper. Next time, I will increase the ground pepper by 50% for personal, extra-spicy tastes.

I made these using planters delux mixed nuts.-they are salted so i didn’t add salt. I substituted chili powder for cumin because I don’t like cumin. Next time I would add another layer-maybe some rosemary or lemon thyme to brighten them up a bit.  But they candy nicely and should be good at my brunch tomorrow!

I made these nuts to take to Thanksgiving dinner with family.  I used nuts I had on hand: Pecans, hazelnuts and black walnuts that I had shelled and also pecans.  I watched the video first and am glad I did.  I had no problem with the nuts sticking.  I used generous amounts of spices and it was just right!

Terrific. Read the reviews of people having problems. I followed the video, stirring after 10 minutes and again at the end. Not a single nut stuck and I forgot to spray the foil.  Stir  well people.  Yummy. Not a single nut left at the end of the evening.

Followed the recipe as is for the first try - a total success! Now I can adjust for sweetness/spiciness depending on who it’s for.  I used non-stick foil and skipped the spray.  The ingredients have a spicy note after chewing, the sweetness is not strong and neither compete with the taste of the nuts.

This recipe is yummy. There is a subtle spice (and I added 1/8 more of cayenne) but it is perfect if you are giving as a gift as it is not a turnoff to those that don't like a lot of spice. With that said, I may add additional cayenne when I make this again.  Other changes I made were 1.5 cups of cashews (raw) and 1.5 cups almonds (raw). Also, I added a 1.5 cups of a mix of pretzels, chex mix and bagel chips. I used parchment paper and mixed 4 minutes prior oven and 4 minutes after 10 minutes of baking (before returning for 6 more minutes). There was no sticking and they turned out terrific. Now, I can't wait to share with friends. Going to the movies tonight and will bring them for snack.

Added a dash of worcestershire but that's all. Not spicy at all. Too easy to burn if following the recipe exactly.

no changes at all, very good, just used my silicone mat, worked perfect, next time will add different spices, chili powder, garlic, just mix it up, add the seasonings to your sugar mixture and taste before adding to your nuts, enjoy!

I had trouble with the syrup not setting up, should have cooked it longer. No one really like the cumin so I willleave that out if I make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I only used Brazil nuts, but followed the spice mix and directions as written.  They have a great flavor and love the tiny sweet glaze coating.  They WILL stick to your pan, so remove them right out of the oven or at least stir around to break them up.  I'll be making these again, especially for parties.

I haven’t made these myself, YET! A neighbor made them for a party yesterday & they are to die for. Several of us wanted the recipe so she printed it out for us. It is now one of my pins. The only change she made was adding some middle of the road Franks. I would go with the cayenne since Hubs loves thing HOT!

Made a very large batch Christmas to put in the goody bags for  my grandchildren.  They were a big hit.  Did not change anything in the recipe.  Keep stirring, it is worth it.  Delicious.  Held out enough to serve at a family event, they quickly disappeared.

These are great. I started eating a low carb diet, and wanted things to munch on that were low-carb. Plain nuts just didn't do it for me,  but these jazzed-up nuts hit the spot. I know they aren't totally low-carb, because of the sugar as an ingredient, but eaten in small doses, and made with honey or coconut sugar instead of white sugar, I let myself cheat a bit sometimes.  ;-)  I shared them at Christmas time with people, and everyone liked them.  They do tend to get a bit sticky after the first day, no matter how you store them (I've made them three times, and every time stored them differently, but still got sticky).  The only nut in the mix I don't care for is the almonds, so I use more pecans and walnuts.

Made some of these delicious nuts to give as Christmas gifts. They were a big hit!  I used a mixed nut combo from Bulk Barn and doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers for myself!  So glad I did! They are totally addictive! I will make these again for sure!  I reduced the sugar by a tiny bit and I feel like you could easily use half the sugar if you want something a little less sweet. I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce as well.  They'd be great with a bit of garlic powder also.

As others, I used salted mixed nuts and omitted salt as an ingredient. Perfect mix of heat and sweet for most palates. Would up the heat for just us.

Theses spiced nuts turned out perfect.  My family loved them because they weren't too sweet and just the right amount of spicy.  This will be a regular holiday treat.

My favorite nut mixture! Also makes a nice gift. I have used a variety of nuts, including some pumpkin seeds. I cook them on the foil, then take them out and put in glass or ceramic casserole dishes. Keep stirring occasionally while they cool and they won't clump or stick to the pan.

This is a holiday favorite of mine!  For convenience, I microwave the butter and water together and then add the sugar and it turns out just fine.  They're always a hit at work!

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was ok but they never really set up.  I ended up with a sticky mess and had a really hard time getting the nuts off the foil.

These are DELICIOUS. I’ve made them at least a dozen times and everyone asks me for the recipe. I mixed the spices in with in the butter and water so they’d be more evenly distributed. I’ve also made with refined (the organic WF brand lends no coconut flavor-just make sure it’s refined) coconut oil instead of butter when serving to dairy free friends and no one could tell the difference. I also transfer off the pan lined with parchment, to a fresh sheet of parchment so they don’t stick. They also freeze well and can be made well in advance of use.

I will definitely make this again... I didn't have walnuts or cashews so I used pistachios and macadamias instead. I goofed and used 2 TBS of butter instead of one so I added a pinch or 3 of additional sugar. I cut the cumin in half. Just my personal preference. Also I used a heaping 1/4 tsp of cayenne... This turned out great! Heeding the cooling warnings from other reviews, I stirred them frequently while they were cooling in the pan, which didn't take long... There are so many variations I want to try now. Cinnamon, vanilla, rum, my mind is just racing with ideas... But alas, it's off to work. I can't wait to hear what everyone thinks!

I love the taste of these, HOWEVER, I mix all spices in with the water, butter, and sugar, then toss to coat. I then use cooking spray DIRECTLY on baking sheet. I use convection bake for 30 minutes @350 then REDUCE oven temperature to 200 and continue baking in 5 minute increments using a metal spatula to SCRAPE pan and mix until nuts have “dried” out. Once cooled completely, they are crispy and easy to transfer to storage container or gift bags.

I’ve never rated a recipe, but am compelled to do so now.  These were super easy and totally yummy.  My husband loves to snack on nuts, so I asked him to be the taste tester.  He rated these vastly improved over two other repeat recipes that I’ve made for years. So, I doubled the recipe and prepared them for our annual neighborhood Christmas party.   I love every Chef John recipe I try and look forward to working my way through the CJ recipes I’ve stored in my Allrecipes favorites.

These nuts are easy to make and delicious, even right out of the oven. (I had to sneak a taste.??) I’m going to serve them at a cocktail party and will definitely make more for holiday gifts. Thanks, Chef John.

I made these because I had accidentally purchased some unsalted mixed nuts.  I had six cups of nuts so I made the recipe x 1 1/2.  I used parchment paper.  It turned out perfectly.   Will absolutely make again.

When I initially searched for this recipe, I had in mind the really sweet, candied nuts.  Soooo, my first bite of these was a shock, and I was disappointed for about 3 seconds.  These are fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly.  They are sweet, but not overly.  They are just as the title proclaims:  sweet, salty and spicy.  They them, you'll love them.

The BEST!  Made just as recipe called for. Except, parchment paper is the way to go. Bake them the times just as listed in recipe. They will dry as they cool. It is easy to over roast them.  DEE- licious!

Easy to make with just a touch of heat. I used cashews, almonds and pepitas because they were available.

I have made this recipe several times, and I’ve been experimenting with adding other flavors.  My favorite so far is to add a cup of dried cranberries and orange peel into the syrup while cooking.  I bake all of it together at 325 degrees.  I love the sweet, citrus, and spice all mixed together...perfection, if I do say so myself.

Chef John you nailed it with this recipe! I tripled the amount for an office party at my Sister’s workplace. If the partygoers like sweet, salty and spicy then this is the recipe for them. Like you Chef John I bumped up the heat adding more cayenne pepper and threw in smoked some paprika, as well. I felt also a little more salt was needed to equal the spice. I also used non-stick tinfoil and sprayed it with a little Pam. Worked like a dream! The hardest part of this recipe was finding the specific nuts you recommended in my local supermarket. After tasting the results the difficulty I had was definitely worth it. Thank You once again Chef John!

Was pleasantly surprised! Very good outcome after following a few other reviewers used half regular sugar and half brown sugar, added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and at least doubled the spices blended into the melted mixture then tossed.  I used Cajun spice and chili pepper with the intent to make less spicy.  It was more sweet and salty. Also used another reviewers recommendation and lined bake pan with Reynolds Wrap No Stick. The only beef with this recipe.......wow!! The nut stick together even after cooling. Will definitely make again for the holidays.

Easy to make.  I followed the recipe without any changes.  I would probably bake them a little longer next time as they were a bit sticky, but everyone loved them.

Very tasteful and very easy. Stir as they cool so they do not stick. I followed the recipe exactly for my first batch. In my second batch I added 1/4 cup sweet baby rays barbecue sauce to my butter-sugar mixture, 1/4 tsp of chipotle seasoning, and another 1/2 tsp salt to my dry ingredients. I think Chef John is right, using this process, you can continue to play with this recipe every time.

I made them slightly spicier and less sweet (increase cayenne by 50%, decrease sugar by 50%).

My nut mix was almonds, peanuts, sunflower.

Do NOT, ever cool in the pan. they will become permanently bonded to it.

The next time I will mix in an equal quantity of popped popcorn.

This recipe is addictive. Be warned!

I used pecans, walnuts and cashews and followed the recipe. I took it to a gathering and it was well received and eaten. I would lessen the chili powder to make it  suit my taste but it was well balanced and as easy as it was described. I will make it again.

Great as is. I spiced up with double the cumin and a bit more red pepper. Very yummy.  For my nut allergic friend, I substituted pumpkin seeds . She loved that.  These nuts are always finish at my bridge club.

Exceptional!  I had my doubts about the cumin, but was proven wrong.  I added 1 tablespoon of dried rosemary and did not allow the nuts to cool on the tinfoil.   Truly addicting.  Next time, I will pull the nuts at 8ish mins (10 mins and they were on the brink of burning).

When it says 10  minutes .. closely check it after seven !!!
 The first batch I made it burnt 
 The second batch was very good !!
 But I really think the sticky batch should be doubled to coat the nuts better!!
Also remember that nuts  retain heat so they keep cooking after you pull them out of the oven !!????

Excellent recipe.  Definitely recommend viewing the video first as some of the verbal/visual cues are helpful.  Have made this recipe on three separate occasions, tweaking spices  each time as I like it pretty zippy , but basic format and directions are quick, easy, foolproof, & DELICIOUS!

I added more butter and less water.  I also subbed curry powder for the cumin and added garlic powder.  They were gone in 10 minutes!  Amazing.

Took these to two holiday events and everyone raved about them!  Watch the video and pay attention to how long Chef John stirs the nuts at the 10 minute point -- follow his instructions and you will have beautiful frosted nuts that don't stick to each other.  When the last 6 minutes of roasting was complete I gave them one more brief stir and spread them out as much as possible to cool on the pan.  No sticking at all.  Will definitely make again!

The glazed nuts were beautiful to look at but texture and flavor were lacking for me.  I followed recipe exactly except that all I had on hand were pecans and walnuts.   I like roasted nuts crispier and did not care for the spices.  I prefer roasting in an egg white-sugar combo.

Easiest  spiced nuts I have ever made. Everyone loved them so much that they were fighting over the bowl. So, as a holiday project, all the kids from all the families gathered into the kitchen and we made a huge batch that everyone could share. LOVE IT! Thank you Chef John!

Excelente!  I watched the video a couple of times to make sure that I get it right.  The reviews had me scared that the nuts were doing to stick all together, but not so.  I made them as directed and the flavor is wonderful.  After the first 10 minutes, I stirred the nuts for 6 minutes.  Then when they came out of the oven for the last time, I stirred them until they were cooled to avoid the possibility of them getting stuck together.  I plan to make these over and over again!

Fantastic!  I love the technique.  They came out perfect.  I changed up the spices though and used erythritol instead of sugar since I eat low carb. I used salt, pepper, onion powder, and smokey paprika for the spices.  Perfect.

This was my first time making spiced nuts, and they came out perfect!  I am so glad I read all the reviews/suggestions in advance.  I mixed all the spices into the butter/sugar/water mixture rather than mixing them into the dry nuts.  This ensured even distribution of the spices.  I doubled the recipe and used two baking sheets in the oven.  I used parchment paper on one, and foil sprayed with cooking spray on the other.  Both trays came out just fine.  I cooked them an extra 5 minutes or so (total cooking time 20+ minutes rather than the 16 minutes suggested in the recipe.  I took them out at 10 minutes, stirred, back into the oven, out to stir again after 6 more minutes, then back in the oven for another 5 min. or so.  As the trays were cooling on my countertop, I kept stirring and separating the nuts during the whole cooling time.  This ensured that the nuts didn't stick together.  As for the spices, I added an extra dash of cayenne pepper, a dash of garlic powder and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  Delish!

Wonderful nuts!  For best results, watch the video.  Boil the syrup for 1 minute and after the initial baking toss and stir for about 4 minutes.

Loved these! Made them with brown sugar instead of white and used deluxe mixed nuts that already had salt so I omitted the salt. I love the sweet with a kick. I put into pretzel bags and sold at school fundraiser.

Absolutely fantastic and easy!  I followed some suggestions of other reviewers: 1) use parchment paper, 2) after the first baking, stir slowly and continuously for 2-3 minutes making sure all nuts are covered and separated before returning to oven, 3) I also added some spicy Worcestershire sauce and put all of the spices in with the sugar, butter and water.  Worked great!  To prevent sticking together, once removed from the oven continue to stir turning nuts.  I did this for 3-4 minutes to help them cool and to prevent them clumping.  My husband LOVES these although they are a bit spicy for me.  I put them in pint Mason jars to give as gifts; hope I have enough left after my husband keeps "taste testing".  This is a keeper!

I doubled the amount of cayenne and cumin, roasted for an extra 3 min (high altitude adjustment). I let them cool in the pan, no problem,  I had to break up a few nut clusters. I made  batch for my vegan son using olive oil instead of butter. Excellent recipe! This is an addendum for everyone who is having trouble with the nuts sticking to the pan. Get a silicone baking matt. Perfect! I use it for everything and never have trouble with anything sticking anymore. I also used chipotle this year instead of cayenne. Tasty!

What an easy snack!  I used Salted Mixed Nuts so skipped the salt in the recipe.  I added the spices to the sugar, water, butter, then poured over nuts.  Baked it on Silpats on a sheet pan.  After the 10 minutes, stir, 6 minutes bake, stir, I thought there was still quite a bit of sauce so I baked it another 5 minutes.  Left it on Silpats on a wire rack to cool.  Yum, it is cooling right now and I am glad I am taking it to a church function tomorrow night or I would be sneaking tastes all night!  Certainly will be making this again and again!  Would be an easy quick gift!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions in the following areas:

-stirred the nuts a few times while they were cooling; otherwise, they would have stuck to each other like bricks
-mixed the spices into the butter/water/sugar syrup to evenly coat the nuts

Otherwise, a good recipe. Nice balance of sweetness and heat, and I find myself returning to them over and over--not sure if they'll make it to the party.

If my guests rated it, it would've been 5 stars.  I'm not a huge fan of cumin so I gave it four stars.  We added some extra heat (cayenne) which I thought was great.  I would've liked a bit more sweet, too, but really the proportions are fine.
Definitely a big hit with our guests and I can see our making it again.
We pretty much followed the video which was a big help.
We let the nuts cool on parchment paper and continued to separate them by hand as they cooled.  Worked perfectly.

I made the 1st batch according to the recipe except I used 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds & 1/2 cup walnuts; it was very good & a winner at Thanksgiving.  For the 2nd batch I added a few dashes of Worcestershire & Frank's hot sauce & it was even a little better.  For the 3rd batch I increased the hot sauce & Worcestershire to a little more than 1 tsp each, heaping 1/4 tsp cumin, & heaping 1/4 tsp cayenne. So good if you like a little spice & goes well with a beer! Experiment for your taste. I used parchment paper instead of foil - just a personal preference. After the 2nd baking time I let them cool for a few minutes & then transfer the nuts to a cool baking sheet lined with parchment. Spread them out with a spatula to make sure there aren't any big clusters.

These were tasty, however, next time I will double the spices (couldn't really taste much) and increase the roasting time by about 5 minutes for crispier crunch.  Also, nothing was mentioned in the recipe about cooling the nuts which is important, because if you just let the nuts cool on the foil after you pull them out of the oven, you'll end up with large chunks of nuts stuck to the foil (not fun to deal with).  I found it helpful to pour the nuts onto a large, nonstick, rimmed cookie sheet and stirring them every couple of minutes while they cooled.  This ensures that you get separate candied nuts instead of "nut clusters".  Also, do not let them cool on waxed paper either... or you'll be picking waxed paper bits off of your candied nuts.

Today was my 3rd time making these; I follow John's recipe exactly - although I have used more/less of any particular nut, but always to equal 4 cups. These are awesome! I've given them as gifts and served them when company comes as well, and everyone loves them!! Unfortunately, I didn't get them made before the holidays this year:( Thank you John for sharing all your recipes & knowledge!

I love this recipe but I made some adjustments for me and my husband's taste. I was looking for a spicy nuts recipe and didn't want any "sweet" so I omitted the sugar altogether, used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead and doubled up on the cayenne pepper. Spicy spicy! I mixed with Cheddar Chex Mix and sprinkled Nacho Cheddar popcorn seasoning on top. I'm tellin' you if you like spicy this is so good.

Wonderful as written, but skip the cooking spray and foil, and use parchment instead--no spray necessary, no fear of foil bits.  These are mild in their heat, I might jack up the cayenne a smidge for next time.  Super fast, and the timing per the recipe worked perfectly.

The second batch, I doubled the spice.  Much better.  They're a little sticky so I probably won't do this recipe again.

These are absolutely delicious!  Makes a quart sized bag full of nuts.  Spices are low key, these have a little bite but it's not overwhelming.

This recipe is great! I added the spices into the sugar/water/butter mixture to make sure they blended well. I used tin foil and it worked well for me. As the nuts were cooling, I stirred them every 3-4 minutes so they did not stick together in one clump until they cooled and dried. Worked great and I am already planning to make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good. I made them on a silicone baking mat and they didn't stick. I also added chinese five spice for extra flavouring.

These are outstanding. Second time I made them, I swapped maple syrup for sugar and omitted the butter and water. No extra stove heating for the syrup needed either. I used all organic, raw nuts.

My first rating was two stars. I had tasted them when warm. The next day they were much better and I had someone ask for the recipe.

these are fabulous! My husband won't leave them alone. I didn't roast them for the 10 mins before adding the coating, I cooked them for 12 minutes and they are perfect. definitely company worthy.

Yes!   This is the greatest & best nut mixture ever!   I like more spicy seasoning, so I added 1/2 tsp cumin & 1/2 cumin pepper.  What a great chef you are and I'm looking at the rest of your good recipes.  I made my first batch for a party and now they want the recipe.   Wow!!  One Q? how do I print and not have all these ads?  Thanks!

Hi;To roast nuts without the burn spots use a dry ff maker that uses one tablespoon of veg.oil (sub the oil) works really well it keeps the nuts moving.

Loved this.  I was given 24 oz. of walnuts, so I wanted to glaze them for salads and snacks.  I changed up the spices to only 1/4 tsp. salt and cinnamon. and added an additional 6 mins at the end for a deeper roasting.

I decided to try this because I had a bag of raw almonds I needed to use up. I roasted them first. I love the seasoning, and I thought it could have had a bit more kick - but the balance of sweet and salty is perfect. Step 5 is a bit confusing - he mentions stirring the nuts to coat but they were already coated in the bowl. Spray the aluminum foil - that's important. And these will dry and stop being gooey as they cool. Stir every few minutes as it cools so the nuts separate. I had to extend the cooking time on mine to 20 minutes. I will make these for my next party! And what a great Christmas gift!

Love this recipe! Have used this twice now and I get rave reviews and recipe requests every time.  Super easy also.  This may become my signature appetizer.

Huge hit at a football party.  Did not have any cayenne pepper, so I used a little Hatch chili powder.  Wish I would have made them more spicy.  Absolutely yummy.  I removed them from the foil before they totally cooled.  Afterall I had to sample to make sure they were satisfactory.

I really liked these. I thought the spice was perfect but then I'm a wimp. The men seemed to think that they could use some more spice. So next time I'll add extra cayenne. I just bought a container of mixed unsalted nuts instead of separate nuts.

Wow. I couldn't let them cool..they are just fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a bit of sea salt. I am pregnant, and craving salt like crazy. Next time I will add a bit more cayenne pepper, as well, for more of a kick. hinking of making another batch to give as holiday gifts. Try them, they are THAT good.

So easy and so wonderful!  I took the advice of others and increased the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon and it seemed like the perfect amount for those that like things spicy.

Yummy, perfect balance of sweet & spicy! quick & easy to make. Will definitely make this again. I used raw mixed nuts - cashews, almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts & walnuts.
