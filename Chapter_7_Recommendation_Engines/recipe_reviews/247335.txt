As a professional cupcake Baker, I was very intrigued by this recipe. It sort of remibds me of a chocolate angel food cake cupcake. I went ahead and made this exactly as written but halved the recipe and baked at 300 for 20 minutes using Dark Chocolate chips. 
I would make sure to beat your egg whites properly and be very gentle when folding the chocolate mix into the whites. Do not over mix and it's fine if you see ribbons of the white still. I would give these a 5 but the appearance is lacking a bit.. 
The taste however is really phenomenal. The dark chocolate I used gave it a nice rich but not too sweet flavor. It's practically a guilt free dessert for chocolate lovers. 
I will make this again when I'm in need of a nice chocolate fix, perhaps will add 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar next time to stabilize the whites. This may help in the appearance department. 
Would be nice served as mini cakes on a plate with some ice cream or a nice Berry compote. 
Thank you for sharing.
UPDATE: after having these in the fridge..they take on a whole new world of yumminess. .. dense and brownie like!

I changed it up a little bit and it was delightful! I added 1/8t Cream of Tarter to the egg whites and used powdered sugar and a pinch of salt. It raised really fluffy and melted in our mouths.

I decided to add a little cream of tartar (1/2 tsp) and how I put them in the muffin tin was how they came out after being in the oven. They did collapse a little once cooled but they were a huge hit at the family reunion especially now that so many people have issues with gluten. Great recipe.

I have never made a gluten free recipe before and I have to say while they are very tasty, they don't look so hot.  I may be making these for a bake sale, can any one give me some tips for  the appearance?  Also, if any one has frosted them, can you tell me what you used?  Thanks!

4 stars, only because I followed other recommendations to use  cream of tartar and powdered sugar (because I was short on regular sugar).  These cupcakes stayed SO moist, even after breaking them open & sitting for several hours.  I plan to try using milk chocolate to appeal to other tastes, & varying the types of fats & sugars.  Definitely a keeper.
