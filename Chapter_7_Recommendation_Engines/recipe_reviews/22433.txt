Fantastic dish!  It's very spicy, which my family loves, but others should beware.

I used canned chicken stock instead of making the shrimp stock and I still thought it was excellent (and much faster!).

Good stuff!! I only had 2 lbs of tiger shrimp on hand, so sub'd 1 lb of chicken breast (cubed), adding it halfway thru the 1-hour covered simmer. Can't buy good tomatoes now, so used 2 cans (15oz) Diced Tomatoes in Sauce and 1 can (15oz) Tomato Sauce. Used 1-1/2 tsp salt. I know how much fire is in 1 tsp of cayenne, so to please the family I cut cayenne down to 1/4 tsp, Tabasco to 1/2 tsp. Still had a good ZING! Served with rice. Leftovers were even better the next day. Thanks for a great recipe, Stefanie!

VERY GOOD!  I DID OF COURSE, MAKE A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.  INSTEAD OF TOMATO SAUCE AND 4 TOMATOES, I USED 1 LARGE CAN OF DICED TOMATOES AND 1 6OZ CAN OF TOMATOE PASTE.  ALSO, WHEN SAUTEEING THE ONIONS, GARLIC, CELERY ETC, I ADDED A CUT OKRA.  LASTLY I ADDED SAUSAGE TO HAVE A MORE MEAT VARIETY.  OVERALL A GREAT RECIPE.  WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN, I'M SURE!  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

I was surprised how wonderful this recipe turned out.  I used the creole seasoning recipe from this site (3 tbl) instead of the spices listed.  Also, if you do not chop up the veggies for the stock...much easier.  Unfortunately, I shared some with my friends and am having to make a HUGE pot for our monthly dinner.  Thanks Stefanie this recipe ROCKS!

I am sorry...but for the amount of work it took ( roughly 2 hrs ) to make it, somehow, something was lacking.  I cannot explain what exactly is lacking....but there is an underlying ` blandness ` to the whole recipe, despite the amount of spices and salt I put into it.  I am knowledgeable of other types of cuisines, that usually use a lot of spices with their food, to create the flavour...such as Indian and Latin American ethnic dishes.  I will try the recipe again and possibly re-rate the recipe, but this time, maybe I will use a richer tomato sauce and add something else to the shrimp stock to give it that boost.

Very tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and found that the servings are extremely generous (it was more like 4 or 5 servings rather than 3).  Added a bit of hot Italian sausage about 1 minute after the onion/celery/etc.  Like others, I used a can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh.  I found that I had to let it simmer uncovered for ~15mins to get it to reduce to a good consistency but that is likely because I didn't drain the canned tomatoes.

This had great flavor and was easier than I ever imagined.  I added 2 teaspoons salt and 2 teaspoons Tabasco.  Also, I messed up and added the green onions in with the other onions, but it was good.  I used a vegetarian bouillon cube instead of making the shrimp stock.  I would make again!  We're thinking of serving this over linguine, orzo or risotto next time instead of rice.  
*I did not use bacon fat.  I substituted olive oil.  We used the leftover over linguine and baked it with feta cheese and mozzarella.  Yum!

This was REALLY good!! I had to adjust according to ingredients I had on hand, like using chicken stock instead of shrimp because I had bought the peeled and deveined shrimp, a few T's of EVOO instead of the bacon grease, and I had to omit the basil and green onions because I didn't have them either, lol. Oh, and I also cut the black pepper down to 1t. I can't imagine this recipe being any better than it was when I was done! The best shrimp creole recipe I've ever made!

My dude thought this was delicious.  So did I.  We had fresh prawns and I decided to try something new.  It was pretty easy to make and didn't take too long.  Delicious with a bowl of rice.

Delicious! Take the time to make the stock from the shrimp shells, you won't regret it. I cut back on the spices so the children would eat it...they loved it. One note-when served over rice, it seemed to make it bland, maybe that was some of the issues with the previous reviews? I used canned fire-roasted tomatoes because of the season, and did not have any bacon, so used smoked paprika per another review. I will definitely make this again.

This is RIDICULOUSLY good.  It looks like a lot of work but really isn't.  And is sooo worth it.  There's a lot of cooking time where you can do other stuff inbetween.  I did not put it on the rice as in the picture, but just ate it as a soup.  I bet the rice would cut down the spice.  I like spice, but there is a lot in this!  When I give it to my boyfriend I'm sure he'll complain there's not enough ;)  I *mostly* followed the recipe to a "t"...uhm, the shrimp I bought came peeled already so I had no shells to save...so I just cut up a couple shrimp and stuck them in instead.  I also didn't feel like making bacon for the bacon grease, so I put it cooking oil and some liquid smoke.  Smelled AWESOME, and definitely tastes good.  I would probably put more in next time (I kinda eyeballed it, so, I maybe put in 1.5 tsp?)  I think this would also be good with chicken in it.  Thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper!!  EDIT : Whoops, I forgot.  I also put the shrimp in during the last 15-20 minutes of cook time and eliminated the last step.

This is fantastic.  I'll admit, I'm lazy and I use two cans of chicken broth.  But otherwise I follow it exactly and it's AWESOME.

This was great!!  I had black tiger shrimps that had already been peeled, so I used the tails for the stock and added a little bit of chicken bouillion powder at the end, it made a really tasty stock.  I omitted the cayenne and tobasco for my 5 year olds portion and he gobbled it up and for the adults I reduced the cayenne by half,  added a perfect amount of heat.  I would definately make this again!

Excellent recipe, I made a few changes just to suite my taste. I used chicken broth instead of water to make the shrimp stock and I used Rotel (pureed) instead of fresh tomatoes. Very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even my picky 9 year old enjoyed it.

Hooyah!!  I was surprised how good this was.  I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter, although I may have been a little heavy handed when the hot sauce bottle was tipped up, plus I added more shrimp.  Very rich tasting, in part I'm sure because of the stock.  Thank you!

This is a very tasty recipe, although a little too spicy for me. I only made two changes to the recipe. I used a 14.5 oz can of chopped tomatoes, rather than fresh tomatoes, and used vegetable shortening rather than bacon grease.

I made it with 4 lbs of fresh Florida Lobster tails, shelled and diced. I had to use butter instead of the bacon fat, I wish I would of been more prepared, I could only imagine how much better it would of been with the bacon grease.  Still, I got thumbs up from everybody. I used half a tsp of salt for the whole thing. No hot was used, that was put on the table for anyone to add to their liking. Served over white rice, was a total hit. Great dish.

This is excellent!!  I only had 1 lb of shrimp so I used 2 lbs chicken breast.  I made 1/2 cup seafood stock and used 1-1/2 c canned chicken broth. I didn't use fresh tomatoes, only 2 cans (15oz) diced tomatoes and 2 small cans 8 oz (since the recipe doesn't state the size)and a bag of frozen okra. The flavor is wonderful.  I looove shrimp but my husband hates it.  He thought it was really good (I gave him just chicken).

This was really, really good.  Perfect level of spice.  I bought shrimp that were all ready peeled and deveined, but I still wanted the benefits of the homemade stock, so I simmered the tails in the same amount of chicken stock for about a half hour.  I'm not sure if it was the same, but it sure was good.  I didn't have bacon, so I sauteed everything in butter and added a couple of dashes of smoked paprika.  Served this over texmati rice.  The best!

Very good.  I did have to substitute red bell pepper for the green as none in the frige.  I also sauteed the veges in olive oil as I did not have any bacon.  I am sure that the bacon would have added some smokiness so next time.  I cut the cayenne in half since my husband and I don't like really hot food- we like spicey but not hot and it was just right. It did take a while with the cleaning of the shrimp and making the broth- I did this the night before, but if you are short on time I would suggest buying your shrimp already cleaned and deveined and there are some good fish stocks available.
