This is the first review I have ever written, because I have never had a problem before and have loved previous recipes. BUT BAKERS BEWARE. This recipe is messy, sticky, and not tasty at all...and Almond Joys are my favorite candy bars. I would never recommend this recipe for anyone to make. YUCK!

These were a sticky mess! You don't bake this type of cookie. And they DEFINITELY don't taste like the popular candy!  The one I know, You add the coconut to the milk with a box of powdered sugar and the vanilla mikx together well. Chill until firm. Use small cookie dough scoop and scoop out balls. If you need to, roll in hands to shape a little better. Place on cookie sheet and place in fridge to firm back up. Melt semi sweet or milk chocolate chips in bowl in microwave. Dip coconut balls in chocolate, place back on cookie sheet and imediataely place a ROASTED almond on top and slightly press down. Let coating harden either at room temp or speed up by  placing in fridge. Now these will taste more like the popular candy!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I thought they would taste like Almond Joys, but they didn't.  They were very messy and sticky and lacked the yummy Almond Joy taste :(   They really aren't a "ball" but more like a drop cookie of some sorts.

These are really tasty!  You have to wait until they cool down all the way or else they fall apart.  Easy and delicious!

I read the reviews before baking these and I was a little hesitant about them. I have to say that this is the best coconut cookie I have ever eaten. Thank you very much for your wonderful recipe.I will definately have this cookie in with my box of the best.

This recipe is VERY easy.  I mixed in 1 1/3 cups sliced almonds instead of the whole ones and it was just a simple drop cookie then.  Can't keep enough to even give some away!!!!

Use a Pampered Chef mini scoop to make the balls.  Place the almond in the middle of the scoop before you pop it onto the parchment paper.  It's much cleaner this way.  Also if your ball spreads out too much, add some more coconut.

Taste is good but quite a lot of work to make those balls hold together.

These were so easy and I thought they were tasty, although they didn't really go over all that well with my guests.  I left out the almonds and used this really finely shredded, dessicated coconut.  Tasted like chocolate macaroons.  Had no problems with the dough or cookies sticking to the baking sheet, but I did remove them rather quickly to try to avoid that.  Will try with regular shredded coconut next time.

These were really messy to make but worth it. I made cookie plates for the holidays and these looked very nice.

For taste I give this recipe 5 stars but I didn't stick to the recipe exactly. I grated the chocolate and used almond pieces and mixed all ingredients together, lined a baking dish with parchment paper and baked it just like you would brownies, let it cool and sliced it into bars. Came out excellent, my neighbors loved them. I also used Bakers German milk chocolate.
