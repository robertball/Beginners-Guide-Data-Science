I hate the reviews that state:  this was a great/awful recipe, but I didn't follow any of the directions or use any of the right ingredients.   

That said, I love this recipe.  However, I use about 4-5 cloves garlic in place of the powder, double the chilies and add celery.  I also saute the garlic, onion, celery, and chilies, add the broth and boil the chicken in the broth.  (Because of this, I usually add a few cups more broth.)  When the chicken is cooked, I shred it and put it back in the broth and add the beans.  I also mash up some of the beans for a thicker soup.  

I've made this the night before, refrigerated and heated in a slow cooker the next morning.  It's very yummy.  This is excellent for left overs also.

I submitted this recipe years ago, looked it up on a whim and WOW!  I can't believe so many people have tried this recipe.  Just a few notes on how I have changed it over the years:  

Now I use a combination of navy beans, pinto beans, and great northern beans.  

I use a lot more broth than 2 cups, I periodically add broth to cover the ingredients as I add them.  

If I have time, I boil the chicken breast whole and then shred it by hand, it really adds good texture.

I no longer use the bean juice.  Instead I take a can of beans, drain, rinse and food process or mash by hand and it makes the broth thicker.   

I'm so glad so many people have enjoyed this chili.  Chili can be a comfort food and healthy at the same time.  Enjoy!

Excellent Recipe. I replaced one can of green chili's with a can of jalepenos instead, and it added even more spunk to this recipe. I added garlic as well.. because I love it! This was great, and it sat in my crock pot for 6 hourss on low and maintained perfectly all day. Great as a leftover too. One recommendation *** drain the beans so the slimy consistency is gone, replace liquid by using the remainder of the chicken broth(I used a whole can of fat free chicken broth), then use your blender or a fork to mash the last 2 cans before adding them in.

This was a really good chicken chili. My family loved it!  I always read reviews and make a few changes based on what I read.  Here is what I did:  I made this in the crock pot so I used whole chicken breasts.  They were easy to shred at the end which gave the chicken the texture I wanted.  I also added more garlic, cumin and oregano.  I find that any dish with beans often needs more spice when it cookes so long.  I added a can of Rotel Tomatos (spiced up chopped tomatoes) to it as well.  Before adding the beans, I drained them and rinsed them.  I always drain and rinse canned beans before using them.  I served this with white rice (my husband and son like chili on rice) and grated cheddar cheese.

This is a great recipe.I do mine with a few changes,instead of browning the chicken,I start with a quart of chicken broth and cook the chicken breasts in it until opaque.Then I remove the breasts and shred the meat,continue boiling the broth until reduced by half.Everything else is the same.A nice garnish is sour cream and seeded and minced fresh jalapeno chilies

I've been searching for a chicken chili recipe.  I've tried others that bored me to tears because they were so bland.  This one is wonderful!  I did poach then shred the chicken.  I used one can of diced chili peppers and one can of Rotel tomatoes with green chili peppers because this was what I had on hand and because another member did the same and said it worked.  Great recipe!  Thank you!!!

This was very delicious.  I followed other reviews suggestions to poach the chicken breast and shred them rather than cubing them.  Definitely worth the extra effort..YUM..love shredded chicken.  This receipe has a very generous amount of chicken in it and could make do with less.  In fact I didn't put all I had in.  The seasonings were just a touch to heavy for my taste and probably would use a little less next time...cumin is a very potent flavor.  I substituted dried cilantro as I didn't have fresh and was surprised to find it tasted pretty good.  Fresh cilantro would be better, though.  I would add something to give it a little heat next time as we like spicy foods.

I was excited to make this because of all the stellar reviews and because I've never had chicken chili and it sounded pretty healthy. This is a TON of chicken and a TON of beans. I wish I had cut recipe in half. I did poach and shred the chicken (which took a while - 3 pounds of chicken!!) and then mashed the last 2 cans of beans. Also, added more broth. This stuff might be the most unappetizing looking recipe I've ever made. The little pink wormy things from the great northern beans don't help. :-( And, this was very bland to me. This is edible, but won't make again.

DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELISH.  This is one of the foods I mark as "better the second day."  I placed the leftovers in the fridge and when I ate them for lunch all of the spices and delishiousness had blended together even more.  I served this with whole wheat chips.  YUM!

I won the Celestial Chili Award at our first annual chili cookoff at church with this recipe. I wasn't even planning to enter till a couple of hours before, and so this was literally thrown together at the last minute. I threw in a bunch of cheese (it was actually the kids' cheese sticks, cut up into small pieces) to melt into the chili, and think it added a great depth. Not to mention a lot of sinful calories... so I don't do that every time. But I do sprinkle some low fat mozarella cheese on my serving most times, and it's just the ticket. This is such an easy, forgiving, and delicious recipe, and I love telling those who beg for the recipe how easy it is to just dump several cans and a few spices into the pot. I don't have to be an amazing cook (which admittedly I'm not) to make scrumptious food! YAY! Thank you Michelle!

This white chili rocks!  However, me being who I am, I did play with the recipe a little...melted 3 tbsp butter , whisked in 3 tbsp flour, stirred in the chicken broth and 1 c half and half and brought to a simmer for a thicker "base" before adding the other ingredients.  Didn't cube the chicken; cooked it whole and then pulled it into pieces with two forks (turns out exceptionally tender this way).  Also cheated and used a pack of McCormick White Chili Seasoning instead of the dried spices called for (still used the fresh cilantro).  My entire family is nuts about this stuff...in fact, my son took the last bit to work with him today and my daughter (who works at the same place) called and asked if I would make more to send with him tomorrow for her lunch!  Thanks Marshmom!

This is a very good base recipe, and I'm giving it 4 stars for that.  I am giving 5 stars to the recipe I made, based on other reviewers' advice.  I didn't want to make quite so much so I used about 1-1/2 lbs of chicken breast, 4 cups of chicken broth to start, 1 can of chopped green chilies, and 3 cans of great northern beans (drained).  I took the advice of some and mashed one can of the northern beans before cooking, then cooked everything together for about 8 hours on low heat in the slow cooker.  Afterwards, I took out the chicken and shredded it, then mixed it back in the chili.  We were planning to eat the chili that night, but got invited out to dinner instead, so I stuck it in the fridge until the next day.  In the morning, I put the chili back on the crockpot for about 10 hours on low.  By dinnertime it was really ready!  The flavors had really mixed together by then, and everything was so delicious!  I had it topped with sour cream and a side of cornbread.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was just what I was looking for. I used to buy the "chicken chili" packets from the store, but no longer. This was great and gone in a couple sittings with just 2 of us eating it. 
I added chopped red, yellow and orange bell peppers and used a store bought roasted chicken. YUMMY. I'll definately be making this again once the weather turns colder.

I tied for first place in my company's chili cook-off with this recipe.  I did boil and dice the chicken breasts.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Thanks, Michelle.

Oh, this WAS so good.  I'm convinced that the green chilies and cilantro makes this recipe stand out.  I changed it up a bit just because I've gotten use to having certain ingredients in my chili.  I include cooked brown rice, green papper and hot turkey sausage in mine and I toppped with sharp cheddar.  I also added chopped tomatoes.  Very hearty and yummy.

My family loved this meal, it was so good and my family is very picky. of course I did change a few things that just enhanced it all the more -  2 TBS fresh cilantro, 1 can of mexican style diced tomatoes,I did use 4 garlic cloves instead of powder. I used rotisary chicken already cooked. Made it a lot easier and faster to make. I topped with sour cream, a squeeze of fresh lime juice, chopped green onions, and shredded mexican cheese. Yummy,Yummy, Yummy It was simply the best meal and I will definitely make it again and again. Thank You

I like this as a base, but found it needed to be brothier.  This may be because I shredded the chicken instead of cubing, but I liked it better this way.  I will just add more broth next time.  I also accidentally bought a can of tomatoes with green chilis, but I actually liked it this way, so will continue to make it with those. :)

This is pretty good - just a touch on the bland side though. I did only have one can of chiles, but I'd like more flavour rather than more spice. Perhaps more garlic powder or more coriander (which I used in place of fresh cilantro). Not bad though, makes a nice dish to portion out and freeze for lunches or quick dinners!

My wife makes this about once a month.  It's very good.  She uses fresh garlic rather than the powder and puree's some white beans to thicken the receipe.  It's always a hit with the family and guests.

I wasted lots of food on this recipe.  It was very bland and was totally missing something...too bad I didn't know what was missing cause I would have tried to fix it before tossing it out.  I guess its not for me, or my kids, they wouldn't eat it either.

I made this chili for a Super Bowl tailgate party at my church.  It was amazing and I didn't change anything except to cook the chicken in my crock pot prior to adding into the chili.  It took 2nd place in the chili cookoff.  Loved it!!!

I've tried several variations of white chicken chili & this is the best by far.  I never follow recipes exactly but I think I stuck pretty closely this time. This will definitely be my go to recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.  As far as my changes, that I can remember, I added some chopped celery, more cumin, oregano & garlic powder (I'm not a huge fan of measuring spices) & more chicken broth.  Yummy!

This was ok, but really lacking flavor.  I ended up layering this chili with tortilla chips and cheese and baking as a casserole, then topped with sour cream and jalapenos.  Now that was good!

Made a double batch of this for the crew at work. I did tweak it a bit by adding some black beans and frozen corn. Can't wait to have it for dinner with my friends from work. They're gonna love it! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

This was very so-so for me.  I followed the recipe and it just came out very bland.  I tried adding more spices but it didn't do much for it.

LOVE IT!!!  I used leftover baked chicken and used 1 can of green chilis and one can of green enchilada sauce that I had sitting in my cupboard.  I served it with grated cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.  It is awesome.  My husband even raved over it - his part of the review is to crumble up the chips into the chili just like crackers.  Thanks a bunch!

This recipe was great.  A little spicy, but I added a can of cream of chicken soup to help thicken the chili and take away a little of the spice.  But overall I recommend this recipe and will make it again !!!!!!

I made this for lunch and followed recipe.  However it didn't look like "chili" to me, so I took another can of beans and a small amount of chicken broth and made a smooth paste in food processor.  I also poached my chicken tenders in water and chicken broth mixture.  I then shredded my chicken.  I was worried it would be too spicy for my family, so I didn't add the entire can of green chili's.

Changes. Drained/rinsed the beans, used 2 cans of broth, and simmered about 1 hour. 

In my recipe box. Enough said?

This is a great recipe to use for soup or even a dip for tortilla chips.  I usually add roasted red peppers and it gives the soup an boost of color.  Be sure to sear or evenly brown the chicken-it makes a difference in the taste.

I have been making this recipe for years and it's AMAZING. I've made it for many potlucks and always get compliments. It's nice to have an option other than traditional chili. The main change that I make is how I prepare my chicken: I place all of the chicken in boiling water for a few minutes. It cooks pretty fast-- seven minutes, maybe. I take one out and cut it in half to make sure there is no pink remaining. Once done I cut each breast in half and shred with two forks. This sounds like a pain but is really quite simple and quick. I prefer shredded chicken in a chili versus cubed. Also I always play how much Great Northern beans I need by ear-- add a can at a time until it's the consistency you like. I never need as much as this recipe calls for. Garnish wish shredded cheese, sour cream, and the colored shredded tortilla chips are yummy with this too! Enjoy!! :)

I've tried a few white chili recipes and this one is the best so far. I only had three chicken breast (probably just under 2lbs), so had to cut the beans down to two cans. I cooked my chicken first in a pressure cooker, adding some of the same spices called for in the recipe. I used that broth instead of canned broth and shredded the chicken. I then dumped it all into a stock pot together, keeping the rest of the ingredients including the spice amounts at the ten serving suggestion (I did use fresh minced garlic instead of powdered). I did smash one can of the beans to give a bit of thickness to the sauce and minced one jalapeño pepper and diced two scallions. I simmered it all for an hour on low. Topped it with fresh cilantro, Monterey jack cheese and some avocado slices. The flavor was just right, chicken so tender and the broth had a great flavor. I contribute the flavor to using real homemade chicken broth and simmering longer than 30 minutes. Served four adults and we even seconds. So still quite a bit of chili.

This was so good. I make chili all the time for my kids, usually the beef variety, and it's always lacking, and someone always has a complaint.  This time, everyone ate it, and loved it.  It was super easy, and sooooo good.  I will definately make it again.  I did tweak it abit, i didn't have oregano and no red peppers so, i didn't add them.  I did add Frank's red hot sauce though.  Absolutely amazing.  Thanks for sharing.  My kids and me thank you!

This chili was pretty darn good!  The only changes I made were to sub 1 can of the green chilies for 1 can of diced jalapeños, add fresh minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder and I only used 3 cans of the beans instead of 5.  If you add the beans right into the chili without rinsing and with their canned juices, there is no reason to add anything to thicken the chili up.  The starchy juice does that for you automatically without compromising taste (I know we're always told to rinse canned beans, but trust me!).  I also just used chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken I got at the market, which I shredded.  Was wonderful and easy this way.  I topped with the monterey jack cheese as suggested, sour cream and fresh cilantro and served with cheddar garlic biscuits.  If I make this again, I don't think I'll add the crushed red pepper if I add the can of jalapeños.  Was very spicy with both, almost too spicy.  But overall a great recipe which I'll add to my recipe box!

I had to remind myself that I was making chili, not tortilla soup because that's what it reminded me of...  And it's a great chili!  Mexican/monterey jack cheese is huge in adding to the flavor of this.  A little sour cream helps too! I made this in the slow cooker. I put in everything on med/med high, let the chicken cook, then shredded it and put it back in to cook longer.  I halved the recipe as well and still had dinner for four and lunch the following day.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of chicken, 2 T dried onion, 1 cup broth, 1 can chiles, 2 cans beans, 2 t. minced garlic, 2 t. cumin, 1 t. oregano, 1 t cilantro, 1/2 t. red pepper and 1/2 t. chili powder. I also added a can of mexican style tomatoes- added flavor and eye appeal!  My husband loved it too- as many have said, better the second day!

I had ground chicken and used that, it was good, but I do think a shredded chicken would work best with this recipe.  My 9 year old loved it and wanted it the next night!  We also skipped the cilantro as this is not a flavor we care for.

This was so quick, easy, and good!  I only made one change -- boiled the chicken breasts in water and then shredded them.  We decided that if we ever opened a restaurant, this will be on our menu.    Thanks Michelle!

I printed this recipe over three years ago but just found it in my recipe folder. I whipped it up and can I say WOW! Until this one, I had yet to find a great WCC recipe. But this one is my fav now -- I just love the green chili flavor! 

Also, the second time I made it, I accidentally added too much chicken broth and realized it also would make a flavorful chicken soup. Just replace the beans with any bite-size pasta or rice. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Super delicious.
Added large jicama (cook with chicken, onions, etc)
Add carrots (4 large)
Try adding a few pieces of celery
After adding the final beans (and liquid) I used the immersion blender to pulse it a few times, this ground up some but not all of the beans/chicken and made it thicker. Was like 222 cal and 25 gram protein/cup.

This is honestly the best chili recipe that I’ve ever had. Absolutely knocked our socks off! This was a super delicious experience. Since I was only cooking for two, I cut the portions in half. I decided to boil and shred my chicken. I drained and rinsed the beans. To give my broth a little consistency, half the beans were processed. 
I added 3 times the amount of broth plus 1 tsp of salt for more flavor. Cover and simmer to complete this amazingly flavorful recipe. It was garnished with sliced avocado and fresh cilantro. This will be added to the hall of fame. 5 stars!!!

Great, GREAT white chili! I didn't trust your measurements & only used 2 lbs of chicken but I should've used the full 3 lbs. It would've been a perfect bean to chicken ratio! I used a little less than half the red pepper flakes cuz I'm a wimp. Cooked it all in 1 pan, cooking the diced chicken & onion first then adding the rest of the ingredients. Simmered for 30 min & it was perfect! Thank you!!

I've been making this one for a while now.  It's my family's favorite.  I get lots of requests for this one!  I do use more broth (about 4 cups of the low sodium kind).  It's sooo yummy!

O.K. To start, I committed the cardinal sin of not following the recipe exactly as written because, for the life of me I could not find canned great Northern Beans, so I went with white pintos andwhite kindneyu beans.  That having been said, I think we can agree that a bean is a bean, and it is the flavourings that really add the taste!  Wowsers, this was a spectacular recipe.  Toothsome, just enough spice to make it edible, and yummy in my tummy.  Oh yes, I did decrease the red pepper to 1/2 tsp, as I don't like things too, too spicy.  I will use this recipe repeatedly.  It was fantabulous!

This was wonderful! The only thing I had to change was I was out of chicken broth and had to just use water. This will definitely be a keeper and I'll make sure to have chicken broth on hand when I make it again.

Made this for a soup lunch at work.  Brought in an 8 quart crock pot full.  GONE IN 10 MINUTES.  Served with sour cream and medium green salsa.. Yummy !!
Anyone who was late for lunch, didn't get any and they were mad !!  This is keeper. Poaching the chicken was a great hint since I had 4.5 lbs to do !! Much easier shredding.

Awesome with some prep changes! I used the same pot (saving dishes here!) for browning the chicken and cooking the actual soup. Adds alot of flavor with the bits from the bottom of the pot. I also drained the bean juice from the cans as I dont like the taste.

This was great!  We are not cilantro fans and left it out - made no difference.  Brought it to a potluck and several asked me for the recipe.  I serve it with a flour tortilla lining the bowl, add the soup, and top with any combination of salsa, sour cream, and avocados or guacamole.  Very warming - excellent for cold days.

YUM!  I used a whole fryer chicken, boiled it in onions, garlic powder, s&p and numerous chicken boullion cubes.  I shred it and used that broth for the chili.  Also cooked onions, chopped garlic, celery and green chilies before adding to chili.  Taste got better throughout the day, left in crockpot 6 hours on low.  GREAT!!

This recipe always reminds me of Halloween.  I don't know if it's the color or because it's when I start making soups and chilis but this recipe is really good.  The only changes that I make to it is that I don't use as much chicken as called for and I usually add grated Monterey Jack cheese in it at the end.  Very yummy!

Very very good.  My first try at chicken chili and it is yummy!  I had poached a whole chicken and shredded some, didn't have any green chilis on hand but next time I will use.  I made a small batch and adapted the recipe, I will definitely make this again and again.

This chili is wonderful!  I made it for company and it was a huge hit.  One guy even told me that he didn't like white chili, but really liked this one.  I boiled and shredded the chicken and used four cans of beans.  Definitely serve with shredded monterey jack cheese and sour cream.

Oh my goodness.  My family loves this recipes.  My husband and brother-in-law beg for this all the time.  I did make a few changes.  Since I'm not a big fan of cilantro, I just skipped that and then I added just about 1/2 cup half and half at the end.  It's a big hit with my family.  I make it all the time now.

Very good. I pulled apart the chicken(after cooking) insted of cubing so it was a little thicker, so I had to add the rest of my 2nd can of broth, then adjusted spices. turned out great, topped with shredded cheese and sour cream(add the dollp of sour cream you wont regret it). will make again, thanks.

The only alteration I made was omitting one can of green chilies and adding a fresh jalapeno and I drained the beans since they can get slimy if you don't. Good recipe!

Very tasty and very simple.  I made some changes recommended by others:  poached the chicken in broth, then shredded it; pureed the last two cans of beans to thicken; added a can of Rotel tomatoes w/chili peppers. I did not have any fresh cilantro, though. After mixing it all, I put into a crockpot for a potluck lunch the next day. Delicious.

My husband and I were looking for something different for a local chili cook-off at the firehouse.  He entered this recipe and won a Blue ribbon~ awesome taste.  It's been a family favorite ever since. Many members of our family have requested the recipe, or even better, for us to make it for them!  Love it!

This is so delicious!! I tried it in modified portions (yes, I am one of those cooks who doesn't really measure)and it turned out delightful for me and mine. It was so easy and a great introduction to using cumin in the kitchen. Thank you so much for sharing :)

Amazing!!!!  I couldn't believe how much I liked it.  The only things I did differently was nix the onions...I HATE onions and I used ground chicken.  When I calculated all the ingredients it actually came out to 315 calories per serving when broken down into six servings.  Not sure why my calcs are a lot lower.  I am guessing it is because the ground chicken has less calories and fat.  Right now I am experimenting with a vegetarian version.  Which looks and smells just as good!

This recipe is similar to my own, but I like to stir in a package of cream cheese, let it melt in.  Then top with grated cheddar or Monterey Jack.

This dish became an instant favorite at our house.  I blended 2 of the 5 cans of beans to thicken the broth and next time, I'll back off a little on the amount of chicken and red pepper flakes.  By using low-sodium beans and broth, this will now be a staple on our heart healthy menu!

Very yummy chili!  Served it with cheddar/jack and sour cream.  Took others advice to puree two cans of the beans. Only used 4 total.  I scaled back to one can of chili's thinking it would be too much.  It wasn't and I would add both cans next time.  We also used canned chicken because it was in stock in the pantry and it worked just great.  This will become a regular in our house.  We are looking forward to the leftovers!!

Very good! I only added 1 can of Green Chiles to mine due to my familys personal taste. I do think it was a little to much chicken, so next time I will reduce the chicken. I will make again.

I'm not really a chili fan - but I'm a chicken fan, so I tried this recipe for a recent chili cook-off at work.  I made many of recommended changes by other reviewers...I added a can of white corn, I added two cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies, and subsituted one can green chilies for a can of jalopenos.  I receieved many great compliments.  I'll continue to make this recipe with my alterations.  I'm also anxious to see if dried cilantro has any difference than fresh cilantro.

I love the chili!  I shred my chicken which I find a better texture than cubed.  I add many more spicy peppers to my version, although I do remove the seeds prior to adding them.    I have now added a can of black beans for variety.  Great to freeze leftovers since this recipe makes a bunch!

I have loved using this recipe over the years. Just recently, I started "killing 2 birds with one stone", by using a whole chicken, simmering it in water to make my own chicken broth, then using said broth and boiled chicken to make the chili...delicious! I add salt to my broth, so no additional salt needed. Definitely better the 2nd day!

The only adjustment I made to the recipe was reducing the crushed red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. Perfect amount of spice for our family. This was very good and different than my traditional chili, so a nice change. I may try draining the beans next time to see if I can get a less "pasty" texture.

Great recipe!  Tasted even better as leftovers.  Put it on top of rice and topped with shredded cheddar.  Good comfort food.  I omitted the peppers because of my son, but I think it would've been better with them.  I boiled and shredded the chicken.  The only thing I wasnt' too crazy about was that the beans just kind of disappeared.  I could still taste them but they were just all mashed up.  I'll be making this again.

This was very good - I went ahead and boiled the chicken, then cut it into cubes after it was cooked.  I still followed the directions to "brown" it with the onions.  I only used 3 cans of beans - that was plenty!  This soup was so yummy - I made a huge batch and froze it in individual servings to take with me to work for lunch.  Delish!

This is a delicious recipe already, but I did tweak it a little bit to my liking.  I used to have a similiar recipe and lost it, so I was really glad to have found this one.  I added about 2 cups of mild chunky salsa to the chili as it was simmering.  When serving, add some shredded mozzarella cheese to the bowl, it adds to the flavor.

Okay, so I really modified this recipe - but the core flavor is what I give a 5 stars. 

I dont like most beans - so what I did was substitute the beans with just ONE can of rinsed black beans and added 2 cans of FF chicken broth.  This produced quite a bit of liquid so I thickened it a touch with some flour.  

But the way the flavors mixed together were fantastic!  I really enjoyed this recipe and will definately make again.

I made this for dinner on Sunday and it was a BIG hit - even with my 20-year old son who hates it when I deviate from "the norm".  I made several small changes: I used olive oil instead of vegetable; the store I shopped at did not have northern beans so I used cannellini; I used minced fresh garlic instead of the powder and I left out the cilantro because I forgot to buy it.  The results was still AMAZING and I will be making this on a regular basis!  Thanks!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it taste great.  I have never had Blonde Chicken Chili before...only the beef with the tomatoes and this tasted really terrific and I will be able to serve the left overs to my friends who are allergic to tomatoes.  I will be adding this dish to my repertoire.

This is the 2nd time I've tried chicken chilli and after this one I have decided to give up.  Not very good; too mushy and not enough flavor.

I got mixed reviews from my family -- my husband wants me to make it again, my kids didn't like it and I thought it was so so.   It's definitely easy to make though, so if your looking for something quick and easy, this could be it.

WONDERFUL!  and we enjoy it for days to follow.  I boiled the chicken, then shredded, then sauteed with the onions.  I like the texture of shredded chicken better then cubed.

This is the best chicken chili recipe and a great crowd pleaser.  The only thing I would do differently with this recipe would be to start with 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and add more as needed

This is a go-to recipe in our household, especially in the cold months.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I halve it using three cans of beans.  Because there are only three of us, half is enough AND there are still leftovers for lunches.  I’ve learned to cut the chicken into very small pieces for this recipe and it has helped with the consistency.

An excellent recipe.  I've made this at least a hundred times over the past few years. It's a family favorite.  The recipe makes a lot of Chili, but it freezes and reheats very well.  For my family of six, four adults and two children, we'll get two meals out of it.  I changed one thing in the recipe recently, instead of buying canned beans, I bought dry and cooked them up in my Instant Pot, which saved me $3.00. I used one and a half pounds of dry Great Northern beans.  I leave the seasoning as-is, and have Jalapeno hot sauce on the side for me and my son-in-law.

WOW WOW WOW!!!
What a simple yet scrumptious dish.  Someone gave me a bag of beans and I found this recipe and yummy!!
This will be my bring to a party dish. Simple yet versatile.
Even better the next day.  
I used dried beans so I had to cook them longer but it had the opportunity to get the flavors really melded into the beans. 
This recipe will not disappoint anyone!!!

I know reviews don't mean a lot when people have made a bunch of changes to it, but I wanted to be able to remember what I did so I could be sure to repeat it.  So this is more of a note to myself than a review (didn't Allrecipes used to let you add personal notes to your saved recipes?)!  Take that for what it's worth.  I (sort of) halved the recipe, but used the following:  40 oz chicken broth, 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (1.5 lbs), 3 cloves garlic, 3 stalks celery sliced 1/4" thick, 1 small chopped onion, 4oz can chopped green chili peppers, half of a 4 oz can jalapeno peppers, 3 cans great northern beans, drained and rinsed, 1 pkg McCormick white chicken chili seasoning mix.  Boil the chicken breasts in the broth, then shred.  Smash half of the northern beans, then add with the rest of the ingredients and cook on low for about a half an hour.  Serve with a dollup of sour cream and a sprinkling of mexican cheese, alongside some restaurant style tortilla chips.  SOOOO GOOD!!!!!

Pretty bland as written. I doctored it up with more spices, more green chilies, avocado, and a can of roasted tomatoes w/green chilies. It needed more broth too.

I made the recipe using the same ingredients except swapped out the chicken breasts for thighs and threw it all in a crockpot.  This is some of the best chili I have ever had!  Will definitely make it again.

I’ve tried to write this review. Third time is the charm. I made it with homemade bone broth. I halved it because I didn’t have 3 lbs of chicken thawed. It was fantastic!  For reference, I used 1, 4 ounce can of green chili. I don’t like super spicy food. 1 can of chilis was mild to moderately spicy for half of a recipe. If you like spicy, great!  If you don’t maybe use 1/2 can.   I served with Avocado. This soup was fantastic. I will be making it again.

As usual, I made some adjustments to increase the spiciness of the dish.  Sauteed jalapenos with the onion, and cooked the chicken in crock pot with bone broth and tomatillo sauce.  Cooled the broth overnight, removed the fat. before putting the other ingredients together.   It was a prize winning dish!

This is a great alternative to traditional chili. The changes I made were to use 4 cups of chicken broth, add 2 stalks of chopped celery, and instead of canned peppers I used 4 jalapeños seeded and chopped. Top with shredded cheddar. Hubby thought this was the best chili he’s ever eaten!

Used 1 lb cubed chicken, 3 cans drained beans plus 1 can drained and mashed, 1 can Rotel subbed for 1 can green chiles, 1 cup chicken broth.  1/2 tsp crushed red pepper was too much spice.  Try omitting next time.  Serve with crushed tortilla chips and cheddar cheese.

I thought it was way too thick and pasty, and the flavor was both too bland and unplesant. Once was enough.

Good base recipe.  Needed some salt, about 1tsp.  I also doubled the amount of chicken stock.  It needed a little kick in the chili department so I also added 2 tsp of ancho chili powder.  5 cans of beans was way too much for us, so I used 1 can pinto and 1 can great northern beans, rinsed, more than enough. Used a previous idea and started with a roux of 2 tblsp butter and 2 tblsp flour and cooked for 2-3 min then sautéed the onions and then added the chicken and cooked it in the stock, when cooked just shredded with two forks right in the pan.  Served with avocado slices, diced fresh cilantro and Mexican blend cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  My husband went back for thirds!

I wanted to love this recipe but it just doesn't have enough flavor.  If I make it again I will add tomatillos or limes - needs more tang and salt.

It was very tasty and make sure you serve it with your favorite bread. The only change I made was parsley instead of cilantro.

Excellent!  Highly recommended.  We garnished it with shredded cheese and sour cream because we didn't have an avocado on hand.

I made this in the crock pot and it came out great! I pureed two cans of beans in the food processor and the other three cans directly into the crock pot. The beans I  used were 1 can of navy beans, 1 can of pinto beans and 3 cans of northern beans as well as a can of Rotel hot diced tomatoes with habanero and only one can of green chiles . Very good recipe!

I used a pressure cooker for mine, I don't know if that makes a difference. I was pretty faithful to the recipe. However I wanted to halve it and I used precooked chicken chunks (1 pouch) and only one can of green chillis. I used the same amount of stock plus 2 cups of broth and one of water as I used dry beans (2 cups). I had no coriander. I cooked for 20 minutes and let sit for 10. I would have been ok with a soupy version but was surprised that it thickened up really well. In retrospect, I would have used the second can of green chillies. I did add salt and pepper and a little more of the chili flakes. I think shredded chicken would be nicer too but it was fine this way also. I topped with grated mild cheddar and it was great and filling.  I will make this again.

I actually used the ingredients from this recipe with one from a slow cooker chicken recipe.. and the two together were pretty good. I guess it's not fair for me to rate the recipe!

This was great. I made the meat mixture with the spices the day before and let it rest in the refrigerator. (I actually prefer for the flavors to blend at least overnight before eating so I plan ahead!) The next day, I completed the recipe and let it simmer for about an hour.  For garnishes, I served with shredded cheese, sour cream, fresh sliced jalapenos, cilantro and lime. Fantastic!

I used roasted chicken breast already cooked at the grocery store.  Saved me a huge step and worked perfectly. I also used four cups of broth and only two cans of beans.  It was great. Looking forward to my leftovers tonight

Only a few things were changed with this recipe. I used pre-minced garlic, I only had two pounds of chicken handy and used a little less that 4 cans of beans and it came out perfect!! We had enough for leftovers the next day. When the chili was gone my husband said he was sad, lol. Definitely a keeper!

Good...I followed the recipe exactly...good recipe.  However,
it turned out pretty bland (slow cooker all day).  Had some left
overs...added some cayenne...more red pepper flakes and a dash of salt.  Reheated left overs...much better.  Good base 
("starting point") recipe.  Thanks for posting.

I roasted a whole chicken in the crockpot all day, shredded the meat,  used 1/2, saved 1/2 for another dish and strained and used the broth in the recipe. It was great! Followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper! My kids and husband all loved it too.

Delicious even with dried cilantro instead of fresh. Other than that, we follow the recipe as is. We've made this many times and it always satisfies. You might want to halve the recipe unless you're sure you want that much.

I made this last week. It was alright. Not as good as I'd expected and really salty. So I made it again last night with some changes. Rather than canned beans which are really salty I tossed some great northerns into the crock pot on low to cook during the day.  I prefer not to use packaged chicken stock since it's so easy to make. The chicken I used for this batch was leftover from shredded chicken I made the day before. I simmered the chicken so I had the broth from that to use. Again, not as salty. I used fresh garlic, hatch chilis I had in the freezer, added in sliced fresh mushrooms with the onions when I sauteed (because we love mushrooms in everything I can work them into),  reduced the oregano to 1 tsp. , added 2 bay leaves and simmered for 30 mins. It turned out.. Amazing !!! My total time tonight from start to table was 45 mins, 30 of which was simmering time.

This was yummy and very easy on the prep and clean up.
I did cook the chicken in broth in my slow cooker during the afternoon and shredded it for the recipe.  Also, next time I make it, I will significantly increase the broth amount for more sauce.

Great flavors, nutritious and reasonable calories when plugged into MFP!  I used all five cans of beans, and added two cups extra of homemade chicken broth.  Other than adding extra both, followed recipe.  Great for leftovers the next day!

I was very disappointed as the end result was bland, other than the heavy cumin taste. I added more broth and mashed some of the beans. I actually added a few extra fresh garlic cloves.  It needed salt. 
I wish I had added shredded chicken from a roasted chicken. The cubes were pretty tough and shredding was out of the question. 

What a bummer with all of these great reviews.  On to the next recipe I suppose.

This was soooo tasty! I could have kept eating it until it was all gone! I did like another person said and added the ingredients to a slow cooker for 3 hours on low. (My chicken was already cooked and shredded.) We topped our soup with sour cream, cheese, and cilantro. Served with cornbread on the side.  Fantastic meal!

Tried this tonight, exactly as written...it was really good.   I did add some shredded jalapeño cheese on my husband and I's to make it a little spicier, and it was great.  Will definitely make it again.

I used a combo of this and Cha Cha's chili- was excellent!  I drained and rinsed three of the four cans that I used.  I also blended most of it, just left about one can of whole beans for texture.  One pound of chicken was plenty for four cans of beans also, more would be over kill.

Loved this recipe! I'm new to the whole "review" thing, but I had to comment. I took other reviewers' suggestions, and added a can of rotel (drained) as well as a can of white corn. I also mashed the beans to give it a thicker consistency, and added a little white pepper, to taste. My boyfriend actually went back for seconds, and then asked if he'd have enough for lunch the next day. I'll definitely cook this again!

Love it....with a few changes....added some frozen....doubled the recipe but only used 2 cans of small white beans. I also used lean ground chix breast. Added a chopped green pepper, and some chili powder. So yummy with extra shredded cheddar and sour cream on top.....served with   tortilla chips. Thanks!

Very nice recipe - I used leftover chicken that had already been cooked. Didn't have any green chilies on hand, so I used plain ol' green pepper to give it some color. I think the chilis might have spiced it up a little more, but it was still great. Nice, fast recipe with many staple ingredients - I'll be making it again.

This was so good even my finicky kids loved it! I only altered it a teeny bit, substituting a can of Rotel chili seasoned tomatoes for one can of the green chilis, just because I was afraid 2 cans of chilis would be too much for the kids. And I added a can of sliced carrots, just because I sneak veggies into their food any way I can. Will definitely make this again!

I just wanted to say thanks for a great recipe! I was unsure about the spicyness but it wasn't spicy at all. I've used all the same seasonings and two cans of beans (undrained) w/ no additional liquid to make enchiladas, yummmmm!

Wonderful recipe. Instead of all northern beans, I substituted one can for a can of corn (drained). Other than putting in more red pepper than I was supposed to, it turned out fantastic!

I've made this several times, and it is delicious!  I halve the recipe, but use 3 cans of beans and 1 pound of chicken.  I always end up adding a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up at the very end.  We eat it with tortillas.  I can't comment on the leftovers, as we always finish it!

Excellent and easy. I cooked the chicken and onions in a large pot then just added the rest, brought it to a boil, then set it to simmer. I substituted minced garlic for the powdered garlic and only used 1 can of the green chilies (all I had on hand). Otherwise, I followed pretty closely. Easy dish that doesn't taste so easy. Served with the Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site.

YUMMY!!!  My husband made this chili last night and it was wonderful.  Spicy and filling.  He added the whole box of chicken broth(4 cups instead of 2).  Definite addition to my menu!!

Yum! The blend of flavors is great in this chili, and I can't wait for the leftovers. I used cooked dried beans, canned chicken, and added celery, corn, minute rice and a can of tomatoes. We'll definitely have this again.

I have found it is easier to boil the chicken and shred it. I also have used navy beans as a cheaper alternative and it tastes just as great! I also drain and rinse my beans before I add them to the pot.

This recipe was a hit. I made it the night before and brought it into work for a luncheon we were having. Now I have to share the recipe. I did thicken it a bit using corn starch but other than it straight from the recipe. I reheated it using a crock pot which worked great. 

Thanks

A good, healthy recipe.  It was a little mild so I had to add some extra hot sauce to my serving.  I did rinse the beans and added extra chicken broth to make up for the loss.  I also added some fresh minced garlic.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good recipe!  It's basically the recipe on the side of a can of northern beans, but with added seasonings.  My husband and I like a little more kick in our food, so we added more pepper and garlic powder.

I tweeked this recipe...I added chili powder, sugar substitute, salt, and white pepper.  I also used can chicken breast, cooking it in a frying pan first, so that it would separarte and shred, which turned out PERFECT for the chili.  I also sauteed the onions separately in oil.  I like more garlic and cumin, so I added minced garlic and more of the cumin than the recipe called for. I also added flour to increase the thickness. I think the sugar really increased the flavor of it all.

My family like this quite a bit.  It didn't blow us away, but I'll make this again.

Great soup. Unusual flavor. Nice aroma. Sort of Mexican taste (I guess because of the chiles). I used bonelss chicken thighs because they were cheaper. Soup turned out great. Will definitely make again.

Good flavor...but mine had no moisture.  I halved the recipe but it was much too dry.

This was spectacular. I have always wanted to make white chili and this recipe was very easy and very delicious. My husband and I ate it three nights in row. I will be keeping this recipe.

This recipe is simply delicious!  I followed the directions to a T.  It was delicious without the cheese so I didn't add any.  Also I added a little salt.  The blend of spices was perfect.  I will make this again tonight!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was better the next day, especially after serving in a flour tortilla w/sour cream and sharp cheese. I originally rated it lower, but didn't serve it with anything and the flavors hadn't meshed, the beans took over. Next time I'll try some of the suggestions from other reviewers -- shredding the chicken, increasing the spices, maybe try adding some non-bean addition like corn or celery to add some texture, and of course, fresh garlic vs. powdered. Love that fresh cilantro. The Flatlander chili is one of my favorite chili recipes - more of a traditional chili (w/red beans and tomato) but this recipe is a nice change of pace.

I added a 4.5 oz. can of jalapeños in addition to the green chiles, and a bag of frozen corn. It tasted good, but was not very visually appealing. It could have used something more in the spice department.

This was terrific.  I used some chicken tenderloins which I had smoked in a Cameron Stovetop Smoker. (EVERYONE should own one of these!!!)  I also put in the juice that was in the drip pan of the smoker.  Since I had the smoker out, I smoked a couple of fresh tomatoes while the chili was cooking and added them at the end.  Absolutely to die for!  Too bad there's not at 10-star rating,'cause that's what this one would get!!!

This recipe is perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. In fact, I thought it looked nice enough to serve to company, unlike some previous comments. I served it with cornbread.

I cooked 2 big pots of NOrthern Beans.  Then I did one pot of the Northern Beans and Ham off this site.  Which everyone loved.  Then I had all those unseasoned Beans left cause I reaalized I had cooked too many.  So I was looking what to do and found this recipe.  I cooked for my friends and their kids.  They all loved it.  The picky 16 year old told me This is the BOMB!!

What a big hit!  My family loved it... even my finicky co-worker loved it.  I added mushrooms to the chicken/onion grill and it was great.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!  I make this regularly and it's a favorite in our house.  We like to serve it with shredded cheese and sour cream on top.  It's even better left over!  Thank you so much!!
