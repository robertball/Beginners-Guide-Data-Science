Rave reviews every time I make it! Almost a dessert disguised as a side dish but so delicious. I make it at Thanksgiving as well as Christmas.

It tasted good, but was more like a soup than what I am used to.

This recipe after being baked was mushy with way too much butter floating throughout the yams.
