Fabulous! I made it for Christmas dinner at a friends house - they asked for an 'authentic American' holiday dish but I just can't do candied yams as they are far too sweet. I couldn't be bothered with peeling and chopping so I put the potatoes in the oven instead; the peels fell off and they mashed easily. I reduced the sugar as suggested by others and because baking tends to make for sweeter veg than boiling, so I used 1/2 cup demera sugar. I mixed it up the night before since I had to bake early in the morning before traveling. My husband won't eat tree nuts, so I put crushed honey nut cornflakes on top instead. It baked up beautifully rising up the full height of the dish, but I did have to bake it a good 30 minutes more than the recipe.  Overall, easy to make and wonderful results. EDIT - made it again for dinner with friends without the topping but it was still brilliant! EDIT - Had a friend make it but they pulled it out too soon so more like spoon bread than souffle.

I've been making this forever and everyone always loves it.  I usually top it with chopped pecans for some extra crunch.

This was a nice side dish. It wasn't quite what I expected though...I've never made a souffle before, but I thought it was supposed to 'pouf' up.  This came out like mashed sweet potatoes with pumpkin pie flavour.  Everyone said it was very tasty.  Next time I may try to add candied pecans as someone suggested.  This took a lot longer to cook in my oven than the recipe suggested...90 minutes total!

I noticed that some people complained of a mashed potatoes texture instead of a fluffy look and feel. if you whip the mixture, like you are trying to make a whipped cream it helps a lot! I got raving reviews for this dish and have decided it's a family staple recipe. I also topped it with crushed grahm crackers, brown sugar mixed with melted butter since there are family menbers that don't like nuts in their food. another thing is that i used actual sweet potatoes instead of Yams. which made it not too sweet. love love love this dish!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and everyone absolutely loved it!  It's been requested for all holidays going forward.    I did make a few changes.  I used about 2/3 the sugar called for in the recipe and used half white sugar and half brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  Also, I took others' suggestion to top with chopped pecans and brown sugar which really made the dish.  I baked for 1 hr 15 min.  Another suggestion if you don't like vanilla extract is to substitue maple syrup.  Great recipe!

This dish had an amazing flavor!  Everyone raved about it at Easter dinner.  I made the whole thing the night before and refrigerated overnight.  I also sprinkled with pecans as others suggested.  Bake time was about 10-15 minutes longer in my oven.

Made this for Thanksgiving today and it was a HUGE hit! Highly recommend this recipe, it's just like my southern grandma used to make. I used brown sugar instead of white and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also whipped the eggs before adding them, made it very fluffy. It took about an hour total in my oven at 350 the whole time. Before putting it in the oven I sprinkled some brown sugar on top, and after 50 minutes I took it out and put mini marshmallows on top, then put it back in for 10 minutes. Next time I'll probably add some pecans to the topping too. :)

Made this recipe at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Got many compliments from family members and friends.  Many compliments came from people who claimed they didn't much care for sweet potatos!  Really makes a lot so if you are having a small party, cut in half.

Excellent....I used brown sugar instead of the white and decreased it to just 1/3c which made this plenty sweet. Also used 4 eggs instead of 5, fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, omitted the cloves and upped the cinnamon to a full tsp. Wonderful flavor and nice and creamy. Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for...something w/o the sugar and nut topping. Thanks!

I made this dish for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. This is not a real souffle, however this makes a very light and tender dish. Something that everyone raved about. It makes a large amount so next time I cut it in half and it worked out great. This dish will become something that I will made on special occasions regularly.

Absolute hit at Christmas last year....making today for Thanksgiving.  The only thing I do different is substitute white sugar for light brown (its a little richer and not as sweet) and I omit cloves because I dont like the taste. Fantastic!

This is the first time I've hosted Thanksgiving at my house and I decided to skip the candied yams and make this instead. My whole family is so glad that I did! Everyone had seconds and thirds of this recipe, even people who normally don't like sweet potatoes loved this. It tastes almost like a pumpkin pie. 
Some changes I made after reading previous reviews:
I used only half the sugar called for in the recipe and used both brown and white sugar.
I cooked mine in a convection oven and still had to increase the cooking time by 20 minutes.
I used an overflowing cup of half-and-half because I wanted mine a little creamier and smoother and it came out wonderfully.

My family has since put me in charge of this dish for every holiday now!

This was way, way sweet, and I even had more yams (I couldn't find sweet potatoes) than the recipe called for, and used only 2/3rds of the sugar.  other than that it was good - I think next time I might omit the sugar completely.

To think, I could have been actually enjoying sweet potatoes all these years.  Really, really good.  The pictures look more like mashed sweet potatoes than the actual souffle I made.  My only guess is others aren't getting it mixed up enough.  If it's too thick, it won't rise.  I just threw everything into my Ninja and blended it into a thick liquid, poured it into the casserole dish, and cooked as directed.  It rose up very nicely like a souffle should, and was still moist when you break into it.  I do suggest cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup (1/4 white, 1/4 brown).  At that, it's still almost desert grade sweet.  I also left out the cloves because I didn't want it to taste like pumpkin pie.  Personally, I feel like boiling potatoes makes them too mushy, so I peeled and cubed the potatoes and nuked in the casserole dish (covered) to soften.

This was absolutely delicious! The only changes I made were using pumpkin pie spice + cinnamon since those were the only spices I had on hand. I also added a mix of brown sugar, butter, flour and pecans for a topping. Mine took an extra 12 minutes to bake. I got rave reviews and but unfortunately there were no left overs!

With all the eggs and the name, I expected this to rise up like a souffle does, but it didn't at all.  Was still very good though.  Used milk instead of cream and Splenda instead of sugar, but I don't think you could have told the difference, especially with 1/2 cup butter in the mix.  Was very good, spices were well balanced.  Will probably make again.

This was a hit at a family Easter dinner. I left out the cloves and nutmeg and half the cinnamon to avoid a Thanksgiving/Christmas taste, but I plan to make as written for Thanksgiving next year.

Never tried a sweet potato souffle before but the ratings were so high I had to give it a try.  It was beyond delicious.  No leftovers.  Nuff said!  Followed recipe except made it the day before and added the pecans on top.  Superb

I have been making this recipe for the last two years and it always gets rave reviews.  We ate all of it up at this thanksgiving.  My family is asking me to make another to go with some of the other leftovers from Thanksgiving day. I prefer to bake my potatoes in the oven rather than boiling them as I feel baking brings out more flavor.  It is still really good even if you boil the potatoes.

Made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Did not change a thing. My sister in law was upset when I did not leave left overs.  Was asked to make again at Christmas.

We love this recipe.  This is the second year I've made it.  I was reheating leftovers and saw a bag of pecan chips I used for the pie, well I sprinkled them on my soufflé and it was so good. Next year I will serve them with a bowl of pecan chips on the side ;).

This was delicious! More like dessert than a vegetable side dish, but I'm okay with that! It tasted much like pumpkin pie and was very smooth and velvety (I don't have a food processor so I used my Vitamix blender). The middle wasn't done though...I'd say about 10 more minutes would've been perfect.

Tasted great but did not rise for me.  Instead I ended up with yummy sweet potato pie.

I made this for Easter and it turned out great! I really loved the hint of cinnamon, and I also covered the top of this recipe with marshmallows. It was a big hit and I will absolutely be making this again.

Ran out of white sugar, so used half brown sugar. Will make again, but I think I'll throw a few chopped pecans on top next time to dress it up a bit.

I liked this recipe. I admit I made a few changes like I do to most any recipe.  I cut the amount of sugar and used half brown and half white.  i sprinkled chopped nuts with some brown sugar on top.  I made it the day before, put it in the refrigerator and baked it for about 1 hour.  it doesn't inflate like a souffle but is very tasty.

First time I ever made a Souffle and my littlest nephew had 3 helpings of it. So I guess it's a success, I used a submersible blender instead of a food processor, not as much lift, but still pretty nice.

I gave this dish 4 stars, it was almost a 5 star, but I think it could have used a little more seasoning.  Other than I didn't have any heavy cream so I used butter and milk to make my own, I followed the recipe exactly.

I will make this again but will add a little more of all of the seasonings next time.  It had a great texture and I could have eaten it for dessert too!  

Great recipe and can't wait to eat this again.

Too sweet for my taste.  Also took much longer to bake than stated in the recipe  Was still very liquid in the middle.  Should increase baking time by 30 minutes or more when using over 3 lbs. of potatoes.

This was really good. It is rather sweet like a dessert or pumpkin pie. My husband asked for whipped cream! Will definitely reduce the amount of sugar next time and will likely only make it at holiday time.

It definitely needed to be cooked longer than the recommended time- the middle turned out to be a little soupy. However, the taste was wonderful, almost like pumpkin pie.

Really good...add some shaved coconut to the sweet potato mixture (about a cup if making the entire 16 servings) and it's even better.

I'm not used to eating sweet potatos, but made this on thanksgiving because i wanted to incorporate some of the traditional foods along with what I usually make for thanksgiving dinner. My husband and I thought it was just ok....my one year old ate most of it, he really likes sweet potatoes! Will not be making this again though. thanks.

This was the hit of Thanksgiving....What a great dish and very easy to make.  Of course, I added the marshmallows on top -- it's a tradition in our family and what's a few more calories at this point.

Easiest was to cook the potatoes! My family loved this, light and fluffy! Tweaked it 1/4 cup honey, 3 Tbls brown sugar instead of white sugar so it wasn't overly sweet.  3 eggs and 12oz can evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream.
