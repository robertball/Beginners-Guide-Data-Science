I've never reviewed anything on this site but I have never been as impressed!!  Even though the filling didn't firm up as much as I generally like the flavour of this pie was phenominal!  Add a little fresh whipped cream and you may want to skip dinner!

I made this pie for our Thanksgiving dinner tonight and it was delicious! The only thing was the pie didn't quite set in the cooking time per the recipe - I left it in an additional 10 minutes and I think it could have used another 10.  But, the flavour was wonderful and the praline crust added something special.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was terrific. The pecan layer in the pastry is a nice touch. I had no mace, and it didn't seem to lack anything

I made this pie just to surprise my DH and BIL. They absolutely loved it! My Hubby said it was the best piece of pie he has ever eaten! I used half shortening and half butter for the crust and it was very flakey. I was worried after reading the reviews that the pie filling wouldn't set properly so I baked it for an hour (not including the pre-bake) at 325. It turned out beautifully and the filling was perfectly set. I definitely recommend that you should try this pie. Your family will thank you!

OH MY!!!  I am not a baker so I love how easy this recipe is.  I made one last week before Thanksgiving to see how it was before bringing it to my family.  Holy Moly was it good.  I gave a few pices to my friend who called me right away for the recipe.  I ate the rest myself.  Yes I ate 1/2 a pie before Thanksgiving was even here.  I made 2 for my family and one for my bestfriend.  Everyone loved it.  My besfriend called the day after and said she had it for brekfast.  I like it a bit less chilled so I took it out as we sat down for dinner.  I will make many more of these pies over the holiday..

the pumpkin part of the pie had a good flavor, but the praline section could be more pronounced. Next time will at least double it!

OMG, this is delicious.  I didn't have light cream so I used 3/4 c. of heavy cream and 1/4 c. skim milk and it worked fine.  Also didn't have mace so I just omitted it.  I had no probs with it firming up and the added praline mixture on the bottom is to die for.  I don't think I'll make a traditional pumpkin pie again.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!!

This is great!  Just like my mom used to make.  You haven't had pumpkin pie till you've had this one.  Never a slice left over.

This is by far the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. I used homemade pumpkin puree because my husband wanted "real pumpkin." I have made this twice now and the second time I didn't give the crust time to cool after it came out of the oven with the praline layer and it became swirled into the pumpkin. It was still very tasty but not nearly as nice looking as the first time I made it and there were two distinct layers.

THIS IS GREAT!! The praline crust adds the little extra something I think has been lacking in pumpkin pie.  I was asked for the recipe by everyone in my family.  One note...I used my regular recipe with the crust and it worked out perfectly.

Excellent pie. Could've used a bit more of the praline component to really make it shine.

This pie was fantastic tasting.  I roasted a fresh pumpkin from my garden and pureed the flesh rather than using the canned stuff.  My only problem was that the bottom of the pie stuck to the pie plate.  I read all the reviews and no one else seemed to have the problem, so perhaps my pie shell had a crack on the bottom and some of the sticky praline goodness leaked out.  I think I will probably try making this again though because it was so tasty!

I hate pumpkin pie. so when i was asked to make it for my families thanksgiving i went searching for something very different.

This pie is amazing. previous reviews called to double the praline, which i did. The praline really kicked this pie out of the park! 

Everyone in my family who is a Pumpkin lover said this is the best Pumpkin pie they ever had. Even my grandmother who is a stellar baker herself.  I didn't mind it either, which for  a pumpkin hater, is a big breakthrough! A definite must try!

A little too sweet, praline layer floated up and mixed in.  Use old method.

The spices were overpowering.  I almost cried because I used fresh organic sugar pumpkin to make it, and I didn't even want to finish my first piece!  My husband said he liked it okay, so I rated it 3.

I would so love to give this a five star rating because it was really loved by everyone at our post pumpkin picking party yesterday, however, not one person even noticed the praline part of it. From all of the reviews this was what I was most excited about so I was just a tad disappointed it wasn't more prominent. I do plan on making this again, however, I'll increase the amount of nuts and rough chop them rather then grind them too finely. The filling was perfection however, and I thank you MFDay!

Everyone I have served this pie to has fallen in love with it!! I found the recipe on this site about 5 years ago and have been making it ever since. It does take a little longer to bake than the instructions suggest. The Mace makes a huge difference in the flavor so don't skip it unless you have to.

I did double the praline portion based on other reviews.  This pie received a thumbs up from everyone, even those that don't typically choose pumpkin pie.

I made this pie this week and followed the directions exactly on both ingredients and cook times. After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about how it would cook and set up, but it was cooked perfectly in the 45 mins. We all loved it and think it is a great alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie recipes.

I have been making this pie for Thanksgiving for about 8 years now.  I am not a great pie baker but this one is amazing and foolproof.  Everyone raves about it and won't let me stop making it.  Like others have noted the pie takes a long time to set - I usually cook for an hour.  I never liked pumpkin pie before I made this.

Pumkin pie is not one of my favorites, but this variation makes it a must have!  This is the only way my family wants pumkin pie now.
