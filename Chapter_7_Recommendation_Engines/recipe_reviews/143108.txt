The easiest Bearnaise Sauce yet!  For my family's taste, I did add a little fresh lemon juice, a touch more tarragon and salt, and a good dash of cayenne pepper.  I poured the sauce over grilled beef filet mignon which was topped with an artichoke heart. I loved the ease of this recipe; super creamy too!  This will replace the recipe that I grew up with and use with beef fondue.  Thanks!

Terrific!  Followed as written.  Made to use with steak.  Was also delicious w/brocolli.  Love this sauce and will be making some batches, to keep in frig, then adding egg yolks & butter (to 2T of pre-made refrigerated ingredients) when we're in the mood for this sauce with steamed veggies, chicken...who knows what else ;^)  Update:  Made a dozen batches to store in fridge:  Still tastes great.  Very handy.  No prepping(!) and takes about 5 minutes to cook.

Very easy and quick.  (Have your hot melted butter ready before you start whisking the eggs.) Yum - can't wait to make this again to serve with crab legs for new years!

A super easy recipe with an incredibly beautiful result!  Follow the recipe exactly and you'll have no problem recognizing the various cooking points of this sauce.  I added a bit of fresh lemon juice to complement Steak Oscar - my clients' loved every drop of this luscious sauce!

We loved this sauce! My brother made this for a family get together to serve over steak, and it was DELICIOUS! The only change that was made was omitting the taragon (we didnt have any on hand). Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Great sauce! A little bit too tart, so I added 1/4 tsp of sugar to get rid of some of the tartness, and this made it outstanding!  I also learned the hard way that you CANNOT stop whisking, no matter what.  Not even for a second, or else the sauce will separate.

This sauce was not that easy to make. You should use a mixer to blend the melted butter and add2 tbl spoons of whipping cream to make it creamy.

I made this sauce per instructions, but I found it too vinegary. I added a teaspoon of cane sugar to cut it, and even my 5-year-old liked it. I will make it again, but I will halve the vinegar.

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Didn't have tarragon on hand but made it with tarragon infused vinegar. This was SOOOO good and so easy. Very creamy and fantastic flavor. We had it with filet mignon and it just really elevated the flavor of the meat. I've made bearnaise before but this one was super easy and the most delicious!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I love bearnaise sauce in the fancy steakhouses and tonight when my husband and I decided to make really nice filets from Whole Foods, I thought I'd give it a shot.  This was so simple and tasted so good.  The whole experience was better than a fancy steakhouse because we made everything ourselves and could enjoy in our own home.  I loved it!!

This sauce was amazing. It tasted just like a bernaise sauce we had at this really nice steakhouse my husband took me to where the sauce was on top of a tender piece of salmon, which was on top of garlic mashed potatoes. If you like this sauce, this an awesome way to try it, if you like salmon.

I followed the recipe nearly exactly (used Tarragon Vinegar instead of wine vinegar, and fresh tarragon instead of dried) and it came out very nice.  Color and texture were perfect. Do make sure you keep whisking until you're done - don't stop for a second.  Not as tangy as I like but I can adjust that in the future.  A keeper.

Sorry, but this recipe did not work out for me at all. I made the reduction the night before, and then I reheated it before proceeding with the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, whisking for all I was worth, but the sauce separated anyway. It did not become "thick and creamy"; it remained sort of curdled-looking. I tried blending it in the blender, but it did not change consistency. I added some chopped fresh tarragon at the end, and apologized to my dinner guests. The flavor was not bad, but was more mild than I was expecting.

Although this is a decent recipe, I hate to say it but I still like the packet mix you can buy at the store better. My mix was a little lumpy, the yolks scrambled on me just a bit, even though I followed the recipe instructions precisely.  One tip, it does not take long for the vinegar to reduce, we're talking just a few minutes so keep an eye on it.

Great recipe and instructions on how to make my favorite steak sauce. I couldnt find any white wine vinegar so I had to substitue tarragon vinegar. Great but definately not heart healthy! :) Tips: I would say the way I like it is to save the bits of shallots and tarragon and add that to the sauce when it finishes. It makes it a little chunky but I think it adds more flavor. Also you need to watch the heat while you are whisking the egg yolks, be ready to pull it off the double boiler for a few minutes it needs be. You can't start to make this sauce and walk away from it!

The flavor here was great. I think i overcooked it just slightly because it was a tad too thick, but overall very yummy. We ate it with steak and I will be using the leftover to put over some asparagus. Very versatile!

Very simple recipe, easy to make, only rudimentary culinary skills are required.   Not as fast as "rip open a packet, add melted butter, serve" but doesn't taste like it either.  The "effort" to make the reduction is worth it.   

Mine curdled as béarnaise is sometimes prone to do, but I just added about a tbsp of cold veggie stock (water works just as well, but I happened to have some homemade stock in the fridge) and whisked that in and you would never know.

This recipe was awesome. The only slight changes I made was that I used clarified butter. I clarified the butter first, then measured out a 1/2 cup. I also reduced the vinegar, but I think that was a mistake so next time I won't. Great recipe!
