This is my recipe, just wanted to note that as written this has a tasty but mild flavor.  It's so easy to change up this recipe according to your personal tastes- personally, I generally up the garlic, chile-garlic sauce, lemon juice, sesame oil, and vinegar when cooking for my husband and myself.  I enjoy eating this plain with a fork, but it's also good served on a bed of lettuce or on a sandwich.  Serving in a bread "cup" makes this super easy to eat and easy to send with my husband for lunch.

This is really different from your ordinary chicken salad. A little kick and a nod to oriental cuisine. I really like it!

A little spicey even though I cut back on red pepper a bit, but everyone loved it.

Completed as instructed but omitted the cabbage as I didn't have any on hand.  Just spread  the mixture on a four tortilla, sprinkled chopped romaine over the chicken and rolled them up.  Excellent flavor!
