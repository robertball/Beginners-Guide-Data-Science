I picked this recipe because it had close to 5 stars and besan ladoo is my favorite Indian sweet. I was making this for a party and the consistency was all wrong. I think its supposed to have granulated sugar, not powdered. I am so disappointed because now I have to scramble and figure out another dessert for my guests.
