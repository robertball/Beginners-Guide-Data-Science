I made several loaves and gave them as Christmas gifts.  Big hit and so easy!  I used real rum instead of rum extract, increased the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp., and added 1/3 cup vegetable oil (was too dry otherwise).  I agree - fresh eggnog is key!  I also made this with lowfat eggnog - was SUPER dry, even after adding oil.  You must use the real stuff!  Thanks for the recipe!

Especially after it sits overnight, this bread has great flavor.  With guidance from previous users (gotta love allrecipes's devoted reviewers!) and my own intuition, I made the following changes:

1/2 c. of butter plus 5 T of oil

1 T of rum instead of 2 tsp. rum extract

2 tsp. vanilla extract instead of 1

extra nutmeg

This bread is less moist than some kinds but is plenty moist with the changes I made.  The crust is also deliciously crunchy.

This recipe is SO tasty!  I used 5.75" X 3.25" pans (for gifts).  The gift loaves were a HUGE hit!  Be careful using the smaller pans -- I almost lost my first batch because they were close to burnt at 25 minutes.  After I learned the hard way, the rest turned out wonderfully!  YUM!

I made this bread and gave small loaves away at Christmas--it was wonderful!!  I made 2 batches--one with rum extract, and one with real rum and you couldn't really tell the difference--they were both excellent.  I topped them with confectioner's sugar and added cinnamon to one batch--I want to make them again soon!

I have made this bread for a couple of years--it is better after a couple days but a little dry.  This year I decided to experiment--overall I used canola oil instead of the butter,cut the flour down to 2cups, and then made banana eggnog bread using one medium to large banana mashed - I made cranberry eggnog bread using 1 cup of grated cranberries.  This seemed to make any of three varieties more moist. I gave them as gifts and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.

This bread tastes REALLY good, but the recipe definitely needs to be tweaked. Even after I added extra oil, as another reviewer did, I found this bread still very dry. (Maybe a little less flour?) Anyway, this was really good in a trifle, because the custard made up for the dryness of the bread.

After reading both recipes and reviews for Eggnog Quick Bread, I combined reviewers suggestions. I added: 1 package (1 oz size) Vanilla instant puddding, 5 Tbsp oil (instead of using the melted butter), 1 tsp nutmeg,  just 2 Cups flour, 1 1/3 Cups eggnog, 2 Tbsp Rum and 2 tsp Vanilla.
  The batter is very thick  and I made muffins instead of loaves yesterday.They are delicious, moist and tastes just like eggnog but isn't overpowering. My family loves them.

Yummy!  It smells great too.  I didn't have any rum extract and it was still good.  Next time I'd use a pinch more nutmeg.  I didn't put in a full cup of sugar and I used only 2 cups of flour (one cup white, one cup whole wheat).  I also put in an extra 1/4 cup of eggnog after reading the other reviews.

This is such an easy quick bread to make for others as gifts and tastes yummy.I recieved many compliments off of this bread and will be doing it again next year.The only thing I would do is add 5-6 Tablespoons of oil to it as it was too dry otherwise.Try it~

This quick bread turned out VERY dry and tastless.  I may retry it with more spices and a different eggnog recipe.  I wish I hadn't wasted the homemade eggnog on this.

This is a good not-too-sweet bread.  I used premium eggnog made by a local dairy and spiced rum instead of extract.  I always add more vanilla and use soft-wheat flour (makes for more tender baked goods, and I upped the nutmeg a bit (using fresh nutmeg is key, also)  I tried a slice after cooling (haven't stored overnight yet), and the bread is finely-textured almost a cross between quick bread and pound cake and is not dry at all.  The flavor is very nice, and I'll make again.
UPDATE:  I have made this recipe 3 times now with the adjustments from my original review.  Each time it's turned out a tender, finely-textured loaf that's not dry.  But I passed the recipe on to my mom, and hers turned out very dry.  My advice:  have your butter extremely soft but not completely melted and use soft-wheat (or pastry) flour.  Remove the bread from the oven just before you think it's done (the top should still be just the slightest bit soft in the center). I also bake mine between 325 and 350 so the crust doesn't overbrown.

I don't know how anybody would know that this bread improves with age....at my house it's gone before it's properly cooled!  A very nice quick bread.   Gonna have to make double batches of this one from now on.

Very good---I added bananas to this because I needed to use them up. What a great idea to use eggnog instead of milk! I made mini-loaves and sprinkled them with Christmas-colored sugar for my cookie tray. I also used real rum as I did not have any rum extract.

Quite good!  Didn't have any rum or extract, but still liked the flavor.  Made one following the recipe (sans rum) and was good, but a little crusty.  Made a second load adding a banana and va va voom.  Much softer and moister.  Either way, try the bread with some ice cream and whipped cream; delish!

This is indeed a cake, not a holiday bread.  It is on the dry side, and should be served with fresh whipped cream.

This was soooo good. I had to bake it an extra ten minutes, but that may have just been my finicky oven. The outer crust tastes like Nilla Wafers, and the bread is so lightly flavored. I can't wait to make this again.

I've been making this recipe for several years with no problems. It's almost more of a pound cake than a quick bread. My family loves it toasted with a little butter. I made two loaves last night, and one was completely gone by morning! I made two more loaves today with the last of the eggnog, and I'll be freezing them for later use.

This bread smelled wonderful while baking.  While it was good right out of the oven it didn't have alot of eggnog flavor.  The next day after sitting in the fridge, the flavor was more intense and even better.  I will definetly make again.

One of the best bread recipes I've ever made.
 It is quick, just a hint of sweetness, and I love the crisp crust.  Froze rest of eggnog in 1-cup servings so I can make this throughout the year.

This bread came out ok fresh from the oven.  After that it was definitely too dry for my liking.  The taste wasn't bad if only it had been more moist.

I tried this recipe 3 times because I loved the idea of eggnog bread and wanted to make it for gifts for the holidays. First time, I listened to other reviewers who said it was too dry, and added more wet ingredients as well as the pastry flour. It came out way too moist, like french toast, and did not taste like eggnog at all. Second time, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out, as predicted, very dry and did not taste good. Finallly I tried something in the middle of my two previous versions, and both my partner and I deemed it inedible. I should have known this recipe might be problematic as so many reviewers tried to alter it; usually I stick to recipes that have good reviews with tweaks for personal preference.

I was actually looking for a recipe to use up 2 reeeeally ripe bananas, and some eggnog in a carton. After reading the dryness issues, I used brown sugar and the bananas and otherwise stuck to the recipe. Sprayed a bundt pan with Pam and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it and it turned out just fine!! I also added spices, because I can't stop myself from it....cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger.

A good tasting bread, pretty easy to make. I took it to a New Years party and everyone who tried it liked it, even those who don't care for egg nog. It is a bit dry and crumbly, but it tastes great.

Awesome!  This will definitely be in my favorites list. 

I'm giving this 5 stars, however  I must confess that it is rated with the following changes, as per other reviewers suggestions. I added: 1 package  Vanilla instant puddding, 5 Tbsp oil (instead of using the melted butter), 1 tsp nutmeg, just 2 Cups flour, 1 1/3 Cups eggnog, 2 Tbsp Rum and 2 tsp Vanilla. I put it into 2 loaf pans and it took 60 mins. 

Caution: it goes from being wet on the top to being done very quickly. So watch it carefully.

My first batch turned out really dry.  So, I kicked up the eggnog from 1 cup to 1 1/4 cups.  Totally made a difference in the texture!  I also used longer bread pans (from Ikea), and baking time came to roughly 25 minutes.  There's room for interpretation, but this is a great recipe for the holidays!

I added banana and added oil and I agree with the other reviews that this bread is a bit too dry for my taste. However it definitely gets a little better with time. Try the other quick eggnog bread on this site - I found it to be a bit better.

I wish I had read the modifications others used. Mine was dry and the rum extract seems too overpowering. I think I will try again with applesauce, that always makes my other breads so moist.

At first it sounded original, but after I took it out of the oven, it didn't rise like most breads would.

Will not make again.

I liked this recipe; it's a creative holiday recipe. The rum extract is KEY to getting the eggnog flavor, so if you leave it out or skimp on it, it probably won't taste like eggnog. I did find that it was a bit on the dry side, and next time I might add a little extra vanilla and sugar.. it was very good, but it could use a little extra something.

I decided to try this recipe because I LOVE eggnogg.  It was a hit with the whole family this past Christmas, and everyone wanted the recipe. I added some canola oil and extra nutmeg and it was wonderful. I agree that fresh eggnogg is really key, also.  It made the kitchen smell heavenly!!

The eggnog flavor really comes thru on this bread, very nice. I had forgotten to buy the rum extract, but made it anyway with fine results. I'm going to make sure to use it next time, though, just to give it that much better flavor. Looking forward to finding out what Mary intended it to taste like.

I made this for x-mas morning and we liked it alot! It filled the house with a wonderfull eggnog scent as it cooked. It is very mild but it was moist and yummy. I think we ate the most of it that morning. The only thing I did different was I used the "light" eggnog instead of regular, and it still tasted good.

This is a great recipe!  I DID make some changes, so I didn't think it would be fair to give it 5 stars (however, I think the alterations make it a 5 star recipe!).  I added the 5 Tbsp. oil as recommended by some other reviewers.  I cut back the flour to 2 cups, increased the eggnog to 1 1/3 cups, and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I used half brown sugar, and half white, and instead of rum extract, I put in 1 Tbsp. Bailey's Irish Cream.  Heavenly!

I made this in mini loaves to give to my neighbors.  We loved it!!  I didn't have any rum extract so I didn't add that.  I put in the 5 Tbl of oil like the reviews said and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  The only thing was it seemed to be more dense then I'd of liked.  I will try this recipe again!!

My mini-cakes tasted like snickerdoodles but that might be because I used 1/2 c. of pumpkin pie spice eggnog & 1/2 c. reg. eggnogg. They do seem a bit dry though & more cake-like texture than I was expecting from a quick bread. I think I'll add a little oil next time to try to moisten it up a bit.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Can be a bit dry if you over cook.  Made into mini-loaves.  Made a trifle out of it with strawberries and white chocolate pudding.  Excellent.

This is a favorite of mine for gift giving. Everyone I give it to raves over it.  Add a sugar type strudel topping (with white instead of brown sugar) and it is a great holiday bread.  The topping also keeps the top from getting sticky when you wrap it up in plastic wrap.

I love this recipe.  I did make some changes which made for a moist bread.  First I did not melt the butter I just softened it and with the 6 tbsp of oil whipped them with the whipping attachment of my mixer  til creamy and well incorporated.  I then added the other liquid ingredients that were room temperature and whipped them in also.  I folded in by hand 2 cups of flour, some eggnog flavoring,  real rum and the vanilla along with the other additions from my fellow allrecipe members. I baked the bread till toothpick came out clean about 1/2 hour and it is the moistest bread ever!  I believe the whipping and folding made the difference.

Someone sent this recipe to me this year and I tried it with bought eggnog, full fat type, and it was outstanding.  My kids and grandkids all loved it.  I don't think a homemade eggnog would give it much of that real flavor we are looking for.  Adding fruit would take that flavor away as well. This one is a keeper just as it is written, and mine was plenty moist.  I will add that my DH toasted it and put PB on it, but he puts that on a lot of things.  He loved it too.

I only give a 3 stars because i made many changes to get the recipe taste like a quick bread super moist and made my home smell wonderful.  It does remind me alittle bit like a cornbread texture.  I cut the sugar back and used health alternatives to the butter and oil suggestions.  I will use this again it helped use up the gallon of my favorite dairy homemade egg nog.

This is such a great christmas bread. I made little ones and give as gifts! I followed the recipe except for the rum extract. I didn't have any and didn't want to buy just for a couple teaspoons so I used spiced rum that i had in the cabinet. Tasted great and not too strong. I will make this again for sure.

Yes, it tastes like eggnog, so if you like eggnog you will probably like this bread.  I made three smaller loaves and found them to be on the small side, so next time I would make only two small loaves.  I didn't find it to be at all dry, as some others have remarked.

This bread is a light tasting seasonal treat - delicious warmed and with some butter on top. It was perfect for mini-loaf gifts this season. As far as changes, I followed another poster's suggestion to add dried cranberry and loved it. This makes the bread even more flavorful and gives it a nice touch of color.

I made this in my bread machine for timing convenience, and it did not get cooked enough so I put it in the oven for an additional 10 min.  It still tasted great, but next time I will just stick it in the oven and forget the bread machine.

This had a lot of flavor and my family liked it. I used eggnog in a carton, but I whipped it for 6 minutes before using.  I also used 1 1/4 cups of eggnog. I doubled the amount of nutmeg and I added about 1/4 tsp of allspice to up the flavor

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added extra nutmeg and vanilla, used real rum & doubled that, and added oil. Yet this still came out very dry & hard. The texture was okay the night I made it, and the flavor was excellent; however, by the next morning the loaf had turned into a brick. The taste was yummy enough that I’ll try to improve further on this in future, but future cooks ought to know that the recipe as given is only a starting place.

As others have said, it's a bit dry. I thought I was going to be okay because I added actual rum instead of rum extract (I didn't have rum extract in the house). If I make this again, I need to remember to add a pinch of vegetable oil like people suggested (I forgot to this time!).

Using suggestions  from other reviewers this was a hit and it's almost gone  with 4 of us working on it this evening. Easy to make.  My tweaks were adding vanilla pudding mix, using 2 cups flour,  using 1/4 cup rum, using 5T oil instead of butter, and 1 and 1/4 cup eggnog.  It took 1hr to bake in a 9x5 loaf pan  until just a few crumbs on the toothpick.  After removing from the pan I drizzled a glaze made with powdered  sugar and a little eggnog.

Great recipe! I made the suggested alterations - added 1/4 cup of eggnog, added 1/3 cup of oil with the 1/2 cup of butter, only did 2 cups of flour and increased the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. (Of course, my first time making it I goofed and only used 1 cup of flour and ended making an accidental eggnog pudding cake...still tasted great. :D) After finally getting it right, it did seem like it might  still be a little dry and it  had formed a crust, but after covering it in a butter rum glaze (1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 2 tbsp water, bring to a boil for a minute or two, then add 1 tsp rum extract) it was perfect!

I used a bit less flour and I just added more eggnog til the batter was wet enough to suit me. Honestly, if your batter isn't wet enough, just add more eggnog or oil or melted butter or water or whatever. If the bread comes out too dry then there is a pretty good chance you could've avoided that by following your gut instinct. If you haven't got a gut instinct yet to tell you when the bread is too dry, then put the batter into a few muffin cups and bake it off and see how it turns out. (Start checking muffins/cupcakes at 16 minutes @350+ and don't bake them any lower or they won't dome.) If it doesn't turn out to suit you in muffin form, stir in 1/4c more eggnog or water or milk or buttermilk and try again. This bread is worth the attempts, mine was definitely 5 stars but it definitely required a flour:eggnog ratio adjustment so I docked a star. Thanks for sharing! (PS this is identical to the other recipe of the same name on this site that has many more reviews so you can read those for more ideas).

After reading some of the changes made by reviews ...I too made a few of my own.....I used 1 1/2c of eggnog, 1egg, 1/2teaspn nutmeg, 1 Tlbspn rum and only 1 Tlbspn oil...no butter. The cake was moist ...I served it with vanilla ice cream and homemade blueberry sauce. The family enjoyed it and even had seconds...It a keeper!!

This was excellent.  I followed the recommended changes (cutting down flour and a little extra oil) by others and it wasn't dry at all.  The flavor was incredible.  I won't wait for leftover eggnog next year--I'll make the bread early and often.

Turned out dry. Next time I'll add 1/2 cup applesauce to make it more moist. Good flavor though!
