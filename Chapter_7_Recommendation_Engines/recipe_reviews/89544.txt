This was good, will make again. I pretty much followed recipe, but based on others having problems with zuchinni, I melted a little butter & sauteed the zuchinni until the started to brown slightly. I browned the turkey in the same pan I sauteed the zuchinni in & also added some chopped onions & garlic. I mixed in 2 cups of ragu spaghetti sauce w/mushrooms & green peppers & a can of corn & poured over the zuchinni! Covered & baked for about 30 minutes, removed foil, let cook another 10 minutes to thicken it up a little more & then put some freshly shredded cheddar cheese over the top, cooked until bubbly. I served it over wild rice (uncle ben's) & made garlic bread to go with it. My fiance liked it & said he'd take some to work today for lunch..(he is picky & will not take leftovers if he thought the meal was just ok) Nice change from hamburger meat & chicken & pork!

This was such a good, simple and nutritious recipe. I did omit the corn, added onion, garlic, and italian seasoning, and served it over large macaroni noodles to increase the kid appeal. My kids refuse to eat zucchini, but they tried it and admitted that it was pretty good. The zucchini takes on the flavor of the sauce. Had the leftovers for lunch today and they were great! I will make this again.

I don't know about this dish... it needs seasoning and a few tweaks. I added 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, while browning ground beef (had it thawed out already, so used it instead of turkey). I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, but wish I would have omitted the corn. It really doesn't seem to go with the rest of the ingredients. I think to make this work better I would do the following: precook zucchini until tender. Scoop out insides, leaving shell. Spoon beef/turkey into shells. Add zucchini guts to tomato sauce, along with seasoning of choice, and pour that over the top of the zucchinis. Forget about the corn. Then, bake as originally directed. Just some thoughts, but I think that would turn this into at least a 4 star recipe.

My family liked this recipe even if they are not fans of zucchini however I did make some changes because of the reviews.  Here are the changes I’ve made……I sautéed onions, garlic and fresh mushrooms in a little bit of olive oil then added my ground turkey, salt and pepper and browned my turkey.  After my turkey was browned I added my pasta sauce and some Italian seasoning I also added my zucchini to the sauce and mixed together.  Because my family is not fans of zucchini what I did is I shredded the zucchini which once mixed in with the sauce and ground turkey you can hardly tell it’s in there and it also cooked much better then sliced or cut length wise.  I topped my casserole with a bit of parmesan and light cheddar cheese and baked uncovered at 350 for about 25 minutes. I served it over broad egg noodles…..next time I will add a bit more spices because it’s still missing a bit but over all very good and healthy.

My husband and I loved this, although I did make one change: Instead of using halved fresh zucchini, I used a bag of frozen sliced zucchini. It still came out great, though, and I can't wait to try it with fresh zucchini.

This is the BEST squash recipe ever! My family isnt really big on squash - however, everyone loved this! I moted the corn, sauteed the turkey with garlic powder, italian seasoning, and a bit of ground red pepper. I sliced the zucchini and then layered it, lasagna style in the pan with the sauce and cheese. It was a bit runny but nothing to complain about. Super recipe that I will definitely make again!

I ended up slicing the zucchini in circles, though I don't really remember why now (I think it had something to do with the shape of my baking dish) and I added onions, mushrooms and more cheese than the recipe called for and it ended up being delish!

My husband liked this.  It wasn't to watery for me.  When I covered it with foil I poked a few holes in it to let the steam escape.  It seemed to work.  I will do this one again.  Maybe add some olives and mushrooms instead of the corn.  Corn makes my husbands blood sugar go up.  With a few substitutes this will work good for us.

This was a great kids meal served over rice.  My four year old and 1 year old really liked it.  I cooked zucchini first then cooked turkey, onion, garlic, mushrooms, and oregano.  Added corn to the top.  And then cheese.  Good, easy, and best off quick meal.  thanks.

Not bad. I added garlic, oregano, basil and onion powder, and subbed cheddar for the Mexican blend, and might add spinach if I make it again. I realize this totally takes the recipe in another direction, so I am going to try it again and add peppers, cumin, chili powder, etc. All in all, a good basis.

This recipe is wayyyy off.  I should have read the comments before I made it. I followed the recipe exactly, and I had to bake this about 20-30 minutes more than suggested to even get the zucchini cooked. And even so, it was extremely watery. It's only edible on a bed of rice or small pasta. 
Could this recipe work if you omitted the corn, cut the zucchini smaller, added onions and spices, reduced sauce, etc.? Perhaps. But then this is not a good base recipe to work from at all. The rating is deceptively high and should be much lower.

Perfect for a cool day. I sauteed onion with my turkey and incorporated salt, pepper, green onions, fresh parsley and garlic powder into the layering. Super delish!!!

Boyfriend just said "that's a recipe I'd keep" so it gets 5 stars! I did make some changes though...omitted the corn, added jalapenos, garlic, onion and basil like some reviewers suggested. I sliced the zucchini and pre-cooked it too. Great recipe!!

Excellent. Chloe's Grandma loved it. 1 thing though, it became a common side dish more often than the main dish.

We thought this was great! Served it over rice and the kids asked for more. I had used leftover cooked zucchini & squash because I had it. Cooked ground turkey in garlic and seasonings. Added it to the baking dish and topped with veggies & sauce as directed with the cheese at the end.

My family really liked this recipe.  I had some ground turkey in the fridge and I needed a fast dinner solution.  I chose to make this recipe and I am happy that I did.  First, I browned the ground turkey turned off the heat, then added shredded zucchini and set aside.  Then in another pan I softened onions, diced roma tomatoes, portabella mushroom in olive oil.  Once they were nice and soft I combined with the browned turkey and zucchini and  added 1/3 can of corn and ragu spaghetti sauce (it's the best in my opinion).  I decided to add some extra seasonings because some other reviews said the recipe could use seasoning.  I added all seasoning, garlic salt, italian seasoning and garlic and onion powder.  I mixed it all up topped it with shredded mexican cheese and then topped it off with a little ground black pepper.  I baked it for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  While this was baking, I steamed some white rice and when everything was done I served the white rice with the zucchini bake on top with some parmesean texas toast.  It came out sooooo good!  My husband can be a bit picky when it comes to taste and texture, and he said it was great.  My 6 year old liked it too.  This is an easy, tasty recipe that will be a crowd pleaser.  You have to try this!

My zucchini didn't cook as much as I would have liked, so I would say cook time 30-35 minutes, then uncover and top w/ cheese, bake another 50-10. 

I don't know if it was the dish I used (pyrex circular), but after 25 minutes, it was cooked but not HOT.

The taste, however, was delicious!

This is a good, base recipe. To make it 5 stars: Cook turkey with onions, add garlic, pepper, paprika and oregano. Then, add about 1/2 of the spaghetti sauce until well heated. Then, pour mix onto the zucchini. I topped with black beans (no corn) and a few dices of jalapeno...Topped with cheddar and it was much better!

I enjoyed this, but my kids weren't crazy about it.  I didn't have corn so I added black beans instead.  I added oregano and garlic powder as well, and used canned crushed tomatoes instead of spaghetti sauce.  I will make this again, but I will spice it up a bit more.

It was a very easy and good recipe to make.  I followed the other readers reviews and kicked it up a notch with the seasonings.  I only gave it a 3 out of 5 not for flavor but it seemed to be missing something.  It was watery even though I cooked the zucchini separately...I will have to play around with this recipe.

Great easy meal!  I did add minced garlic and onion to my turkey, while it was browning.  Then add a can of diced tomatoes w/ onion, celery, and green pepper, along with the spaghetti sauce.  I quartered my zucchinis and cut into large chunks, and it took about 45 min at 350 to fully cook them.  Still it was worth the wait.  Even my husband, who isn't a big veggie guy, went back for seconds.  Thanks!

This is a good, easy recipe, but a bit bland. Next time will add some spices like cayenne pepper and garlic powder to give it some kick.

This is a very easy and delicious meal.  My kids like it, as does my husband.  The second time I made it I only had a partial jar of spaghetti sauce, about 2 cups, and the dish turned out less watery but just as tasty.  We love cheese, so I added more to taste.  Very good, and I will make it again and again.

Recipe is a good base but needs some added touches like garlic, onion, salt & pepper.  I used fresh corn instead of canned and shredded the zucchini.  Served it with tortilla chips.  Would make a great party dip!  Made this a 2nd time tonight; this time I 1/4" sliced the zucchini and it was still a hit!

Used this as a base for an excellent dinner! We make our own spaghetti sauce so first we sauteed 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 2 tbsp chopped spanish onion in a tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. Added ground turkey and browned. Added 1 cup shredded carrots and 2 medium tomatoes cubed. Spices added: 1 tbsp basil, 2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1 tbsp dried crushed chili peppers, plus salt and pepper. Simmered for 15 minutes. Layered in pan as per recipe. Baked for 30 minutes. Added cheddar, mozarella, romano and parmesean reggiano cheeses, increased oven temp to 400 and baked an additional 15 minutes uncovered to brown. This was excellent and VERY filling!!

Mine turned out very watery! I sauteed the sliced zucchini in a little butter, garlic powder & basil and put n 8x8 dish, then sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter & a little salt to make them sweat, and put on top of zukes. Then cooked turkey and added some creole seasoning for flavor. Topped with spaghetti sauce and baked (covered) 25 mins, did not add corn. Removed foil & added shredded cheese, baked 10 mins. Kids thought it was okay but I liked the low-carb-ness of the dish.

I reluctantly tried this because my son is a very picky eater, but he absolutely loved it.  I also think it was a great lesson for him that things that taste good don't always look great.  He thought it tasted a little like pizza.  If I made it again, I would likely shred or dice the zucchini so it would cook up easier, but either way, the recipe is great.

I also changed it up a bit, I sliced the zucchini and sauteed with onion and garlic, and used mozzarella also omitting the corn.  served with angel hair pasta (all that I had on hand).  My boys and husband loved it and hubby is not big on spaghetti type dishes. thanks for a new way to cook up some of our bumper crop of  fall garden squash.

I changed this one up after reading the reviews- used 1/2 pound lean ground beef browned with about a cup of chopped vidalia onion. Put this atop the zucchini (sliced into bite size pieces) and then a layer of sliced pepperoni, then sauce, then another layer of pepperoni, then the cheeses- mozz, asiago, romano and parmesan. This variation added just enough flavor and went great with corn on the cob and fresh bread to dip in the juices! Whole family loved it!

I've made this a number of times and love it!  It's quick, tasty, and nutritious.  I do use ground beef and slice the zucchini in thick chunks.
Thanks!

This meal was super quick and easy to make.  I stacked slices of zucchini instead of halving them and they cooked perfectly.  I also used a lot of seasoning (onion powder and garlic herb mix from Costco)in the turkey.  My husband and I enjoyed it and will most likely have it again.  i think the next time I will use less sauce.

This looks great. I have tried a similar recipe.. but for it to be low carb.. the corn needs to be left out. I think i will try it with mozzarella and parmesean cheese on top.

This was easy and tasted great. I used a vodka sauce instead of regular marinara, and it tasted great. It was a little soupy though, so I would think about adding something else (rice or pasta) to firm it up a little more. But it was delicious!

Love it! I looked at this and thought "um, really?" but it's fantastic! I tried it the way it says the first time. The second time I sliced the zucchini thinner and layered it with a cottage cheese and egg mixture in the middle and it was great. I like it becuase I can make lasagna now but don't have to do all the work of boiling noodles :D

I made this last night for me and my husband with a few changes. I cut the zucchini in rounds and spread them out on the bottom of the baking dish and I sprinkled parm. cheese on it,also I used ground beef (my husband hates turkey) and used mozz cheese. But it was good and it customizable

I was looking for a vegetarian side dish, so I made this without the ground turkey.  Turned out on the watery side, so I will cook the zucchini 1st as others have done.  Might skip the corn too - didn't seem to add to the dish overall.  Did add some seasoning & used mozzarella as I was using that in a pasta dish I was making at the same time.  Overall, will try again with some changes.

I should of followed the other reviewers suggestions and pre-cooked the zucchini.  After oven baking, the dish had a lot of liquid.  I made this with reduced fat cheese.  Other than the extra liquid, this zucchini dish was very good.  I will make it again.

Great, even my 10 year old ate the zucchini and I thought he would pick it out. Added sliced onion and diced garlic on top of zucchini, used mozarella cheese and broiled it to make it more "Italian" (no corn).  Was a bit runny, but it didn't bother anyone at my house.

My husband and I loved this dish (and he normally grimaces when I fix zucchini). It was a bit watery though. Maybe next time I'll serve it over rice to fix that. 
Overall. . . delicious!

I made this tonight with a few changes.  I browned the ground turkey, added finely chopped fresh spinach, chopped zucchini, and frozen corn.  Following another reviewer's suggestion, I added cumin & chili powder to season it.  I skipped baking it in the oven & skipped the spaghetti sauce (totally forgot about adding it, but liked it without), but still added shredded cheese.  The casserole was served over brown rice.  My kids gave it two thumbs up, though my son picked around the zucchini.  Next time I'll probably add some minced garlic to give it a little more flavor.

This was very good.  I ended up using cream of chicken soup instead of spaghetti sauce and omitted the corn.  I thought that I had a jar of spaghetti sauce when I started cooking, but I didnt.  I also sliced the zucchini and cooked it with the turkey because of other issues with it not being tender.  I also added garlic and bread crumbs to the zucchini/turkey mixture.

I used a huge zucchini cut in quarters, salsa, and fat free cheddar cheese and served it with a little brown rice. The zucchini was still too firm after over 45 minutes of baking. If I try this again I'll try sliced zucchini as the base. Overall, it was a good healthy alternative, but still a little strange. I liked it, but my husband wasn't too crazy about it. Maybe next time.

I only used 2 cups of marinara and smaller zucchinis.  I also added chopped jalapenos, black olives and feta cheese.  When I browned the turkey burger, I added garlic salt, pepper and italian seasoning.  Cooked for 25 minutes under foil, then 10 minutes uncovered.  I had no problem with the zucchini being tender or the dish being too watery.  I think next time I would just quarter up the zucchini in bite sizes.  It didn't seem to absorb any of the flavor.  Tasty but needs tweaking.

We were not wild about this.  It seemed to be missing something.  I browned the turkey with onion, basil, garlic, etc AND added some noodles.  Still kind of bland.  I wouldn't make it again.

This recipe was okay...but not great.  I added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the turkey while I was browning it and that turned out great!  I also added a 14.5oz can of corn (I don't know where you find an 8oz can) and that was good too.  Everything was great until I added it to the zucchini.  The flavor (or lack thereof) of the zucchini made the rest of the casserole bland - even with the extra spices that I added!  I think that this would taste much better over pasta rather than zucchini.

This was fantastic!  We both went back for seconds.  
I cut the zucchini in quarters so they would cook quicker and it still took about 40 minutes.  Was a little watery, maybe pull the foil off sooner so the excess water can evaporate.

This turned out pretty good, except the zuccini didn't cook all the way through. In fact, i doubled (to 50 minutes) the covered cooking time, and then cooked 10 minutes uncovered, and it was STILL way underdone. I'm not certain about how to fix it (maybe higher temp for 40 minutes?) but if it were softer it would be pretty good. It wasn't bad as it was.

I started out w/a HUGE zucchini from my garden, lopped off the ends so it would fit in the dish and pared off flat spots on the bottom so the halves wouldn't wobble.  The zucchini didn't cook enough but that was probably due to its size, the parts that did cook all the way through were tasty, other than that it was good, not great.  I wouldn't mind making it again but it wouldn't be my first choice.

We try to eat low carb, and it was easy to adapt this recipe.  I left out the corn and sauteed the onions with some quartered small mushrooms before adding ground turkey to brown.  I also made zoodles out of the zucchini and the total cooking time was 30 minutes.  Mozzerella cheese and some parmesan cheese worked well too.  Lots of leftovers, but it was good.

Yes, it was easy to make, but I deducted a star for the inconsistent blending of flavors.  It tasted great after I had placed the leftovers in the refrigerator over night and the flavors had marinated.

This was delicious. I made it with our eggplant from our garden instead of zucchini and served it over spaghetti.

Comment continued: I made this recipe when counting cabs. It was my lasagna substitute. Like others I've sautéed the zucchini to reduce the liquid and shorten the bake time. Because ground turkey tends to be bland, I don't skimp on the seasoning while brown in the skillet. I sauté with garlic, onions, Adobo seasoning, pepper and crushed peppers. Oh and I also as a layer in a ricotta cheese and egg mixture. Layer 1- meat and spaghetti sauce; Layer 2- zucchini strips; Layer 3 ricotta cheese. Repeat until all ingredients are

I used eggplant instead of zucchini.   It had to bake 50 min for the eggplant to become  tender.  I also substituted fresh broccoli for the corn, it was WONDERFUL.  

This is going to be a regular dinner for us.

this is a yummy recipe but does need some tweaking for my family.  I shredded the zucchini as other reviewers suggested and added my own spices. Overall a very well received low carb meal for my family of 6 , including teenagers!

Made this tonight and boy was it delicious. I changed it up a bit. I cooked the Turkey with some Montreal steak seasoning and salt. Then for the zucchini I cut them up into small jubilee pieces sprinkled with a little olive oil salt and pepper. Now it did get runny so next time I'll put in a can of paste to make it thick. Otherwise very tasty and kids will love it!

My kids loved this, I made it with the zucchini sliced like lasagna noodles, but it was hard for my littles to cut. I think this go around I will grate it to make it blend in a little better and they won't have to fuss with cutting it up. I think it is a great recipe especially when you have a family that doesn't want to eat their veggies. We really liked the corn, so I left it in. I think its a superb idea to add a little garlic to the turkey while browning and maybe some Italian seasoning. Otherwise great, and easy recipe!

Pretty good stuff.  I read the reviews and omitted the corn.  I also added garlic and onions - I sautéed them with the ground meat.  I used summer squash rather than zucchini (because that's what I had available in my garden.  I wish I would have cooked the squash longer.  I cut it into strips and sautéed it before layering.  I also used ground chicken rather than turkey.  I just like the taste better and find it easier to digest.  All in all, pretty good and healthy.

Wanted to add so many additional ingredients. Just felt it needed more. Totally followed other reviews and added Mozzarella cheese, jalapenos (a must), onion and mushrooms as well as omitted the corn. We also cut up the tortillas. After the changes would so rate it 5 stars!

We LOVED this!  I recently was put on a low carb diet, & pasta is my favorite foods.  This really satisfied my craving.  I didn't miss the pasta at all!  Next time, I want to add fresh mushrooms.  My husband ate his with a side of seafood sauce that he'd dip each bite in & he said it reminded him of fried zucchini, which he loves.  Super easy recipe that smelled devine as it was baking.  Even though I thoroughly dried the zucchini after washing it, there was quite a bit of 'juice' in the bottom of the dish, which I will freeze to use as part of a vegetable soup base, as it has great flavor.  This will be one of our favorites!

Not very impressed.  It was watery and the zucchini was not cooked.  I should have read all the reviews and known to cut the zucchini into smaller pieces.  Definitely needs some seasoning too.

Loved it!  My whole family loved it.  From my 2 year old to my 30 year old husband.  It's hard to get my kids (and hubby) to eat zucchini, but they all loved this.  I probably would add a bit more spices next time, cause it could have had a bit more flavor.

Great dish, but the zucchini needs to be pre cooked a little before being put in the oven. I microwaved it for two minutes first and it came out perfect. Still had a lot of liquid but it was still real good.

This was very easy to make and pretty good, I must say. Some more flavor wouldn't hurt, next time I'll try some of the suggestions some of the other reviwers mentioned. All in all, this is a good and quick meal to make for a weeknight dinner.

I made this, and added a little green and red pepper, onion chopped and minced garlic, I sliced the zucchini thin with a veggie peeler added Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese made it almost like a lasagna layered the meat, cheeses and veggies and spaghetti sauce and layered more zucchini etc. etc.  It was really good the sauce was runny so we soaked it up with some garlic bread on the side.

After browning the sausage, I added to the skillet, diced zucchini, fresh mushrooms, onions, and spaghetti sauce, when the vegetables were done I thickened it slightly with corn starch, and left cook another few minutes.  Served on plates with cheese piled on top.

I thought this recipe was simple, which was great.  Hubby liked it, so also a plus.  Might try to add a few things next time.  Can be easily varied.

This is a good recipe, just a bit bland. I kicked it up a notch (groan) by sauteing the zucchini halves in olive oil, black pepper, thyme, basil, minced onion and garlic powder. After I made sure they were 'soft' enough I placed them in the casserole dish and used ground chicken (cooked in the same pan as the zucchini so that the seasonings were still around, I just added salt). Mixed the corn with the chicken for the last five minutes and then poured that mix over the squash. Topped with some Bertoli's Sun-Dried Tomato sauce. Baked for the time suggested and then addded a bunch of cheese on top. It turned out pretty good, but I think next time I will just cut up the zucchini instead of halving it. It's just too bulky and hard to serve. Plus, I had an overabundance of juice for some reason. Weird.

good and easy.  I used ground beef though, as I didn't have any ground turkey at home.

This was pretty good.  I would suggest slicing the zucchini VERY thin - or blanching it before placing it in the bottom of the baking dish - and I would suggest seasoning it as well.  Otherwise, a simple dish that gave us leftovers for lunch later in the week.

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this, I definitely would have made it like a stuffed squash, instead of the bake.  One thing I did do differently, to the ground turkey, i added and chopped onion and chopped 1 1/2 med red potatoes, that gave it an extra goodness.  I served it over whole grain rice, which made it wonderful!

Easy and quick.  I left out the corn as suggested by many others.  I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and it was great!

I made this like lasagna, cutting the zucchini in thin strips and layering with the meat sauce.  I also used green pepper, onion, garlic, oregano, and thyme to season the meat.  I did not put any corn in the casserole because I'm diabetic and corn makes my blood sugar soar.  Lastly, I used a small jar of Ragu pizza sauce (because I didn't have any spaghetti sauce on hand!) and added a drained can of diced tomatoes to it.  Everyone raved about the flavor and my husband said, "It's a keeper!".

Glad I bought ground turkey by accident or I never would have tried this. Pretty basic, nothing over the top. I sauteed the zucchini with olive oil and garlic and browned the turkey beforehand.  I thought it was great.

I wasn't crazy about this. It was very watery and bland. The zucchini was hard despite the longercooking time as othrs have suggested. I don't understand why this one got such good reviews. My kids thought is was tasteless. Hubby thought it was okay. Won't make this again. I will stick with my turkey meatballs recipe for ground turkey.

It was pretty good, a little bit of trouble with the wateriness, but not too much to notice.  I didn't bother layering, just dumped one mixture on top of the other.  I did add olives before adding cheese, and it was a definite plus.  Everyone loved it, and it felt healthy, and so chocked with veggies.

Every year neighbors drop off zucchini and I'm always left wondering what to do with their over-grown vegies. I decided to try this dish and I was not disappointed. It even got a 'This stuff is good,' from my 14 year old son. I used chopped Italian turkey sausage, diced in a few garden-ripened tomatoes, and used fresh corn straight off the cob. Because of other reviewer's remarks about the time it took to cook the zucchini, I sliced and sauteed it for a few minutes with salt, pepper, and a few cloves of crushed garlic. I also decreased the sauce by about half because of the tomatoes. Served with biscuits it was delish. I'll definitely make this the next time I find a basket of zucchini on the porch.
