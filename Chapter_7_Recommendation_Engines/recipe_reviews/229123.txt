Oh gosh, these were fabulous.  I used a whole packet of taco seasoning (misread the recipe), green chilie enchilada sauce (I've been craving it), and omitted the chili powder.  Melting the sour cream and cheddar with the beef on the stove makes a creamy, lovely filling.  And laying the black beans and olives on top (instead of incorporating them into the filling), is genius.  The beans retain a nice little "snap" that hits your tounge at just the right time.  I topped my enchiladas with jack cheese.  I can't say enough good things about this dish - it's beyond delicious.

SOOOOOOOOOOO good!!! Listen to the awesome additions I added!!! So just like many others are also saying, I accidentally used a whole packet of taco seasoning. MAKE SURE YOU USE THE WHOLE PACKET! It was soooo flavorful and we all agreed it would NOT have been nearly as flavorful if I only used 1 Tb of that. I didn't use parsley. I added almost a whole green pepper to the beef with the onion. After I pulled this out of the oven, I topped it with: chopped cilantro, green onions, tomatoes, Mexican cheese and I could not eat this without sour cream on the side! I will be making this every time I want enchiladas! Beef is so much better than chicken! Thank you!

I did not enjoy these at all and I think the reason why is that with flour tortillas they weren't enchiladas, they were burritos. Not great.

OMG! My favorite recipe on this site so far! I have had two servings and I usually don't even feel like eating after cooking! I made minor changes....I spooned some enchilada sauce into the baking pan prior to adding tortillas.....I also added diced tomatoes to the meat sauce.  After the tortillas were in the pan I spooned some enchilada sauce over the tortillas and than added the cheese. It was delicious!! I had some left over meat sauce, so I added the remaining black beans and chopped olives and I will use the leftovers for nachos tomorrow night!!

Ok, prepare yourself.  If you don't like reviews from people who alter the recipe, don't read this.    I used a differnt meat and method (stewed beef roast).  But I followed the recipe exactly to make the filling and the enchiladas.  Oh, wait, another mod:  I made my own sauce from the site, "the best red enchilada sauce."   So, still felt like I needed to share how great the components of this recipe are.  Really made a delicious enchilada.   I'm sure ground beef would've been great also, but I had a small party to feed.  No leftovers!!!!!

I made this to take to friends house for a Mexican evening and it was a hit.  I did not change a thing.  It's very easy and so very good!! Will make again soon as I only got one enchilada!! That was NOT good!!

Really great recipe.   I almost always have all of the ingredience on hand.   The 1st time, I followed the recipe to the letter except that I used corn tortillas.   I cannot use flour tortillas for enchiladas.   I have images of a gummy, soggy leftover.   The 2nd time, again followed the recipe almost exactly but I added the olives and cheese into the meat mixture.  So much easier and it made the meat more of the star instead of olive.  Next time, instead of using canned enchilada sauce, I am going to make one on this site.  I will update my post if it makes a big difference.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I began with homemade enchilada (10 min sauce from this site).  I used 1.5 lbs ground beef and 1 can corn in place on black beans because I did not have any black beans. I skipped the olives because I don't like them.  I used Trader Joe's taco seasoning which is spicier than others so I skipped the chili powder.  Very tasty.  Teenage son and his friend devoured it.

These are really good as written! The only thing I changed was to use a whole package of taco seasoning and some fresh cilantro. Awesome for a nice meal that looks like you spent lots of time on!!

These were  delicious! I can't believe someone said these were bland. My boyfriend came home from work and said it smelled like a Mexican fiesta  as soon as he opened door before he even knew what I was making! I used all ingredients except for the parsley and oregano.

These were really good and tasty.  I will be making them again.  I suggest opening a can of diced tomatoes and placing the shells in the juice before rolling and baking to prevent a dry shell.  I also put some of the left over tomatoes on top of the shells before putting the cheese on.

‘Put it in the rotation’ were my husband’s first comments after a few bites.  That was high praise, indeed, as we don’t typically eat Mexican food and he doesn’t like really spicy food.   I kept the enchilada sauce mild but added the other spices.  I was in the same boat as a lot of reviewers in having a lot of meat sauce left over after filling the enchiladas.  I poured it all over the top which tasted great but will spoil the traditional look of cheese-covered enchiladas.  If that matters to you and isn’t the option desired have a second use (tacos?) for the leftover sauce, adjust the meat sauce ratio down or use a bigger dish than a 13x9x2 and add a couple more enchiladas.   Yum!

As other reviewers said I used a whole package of Taco seasoning but everything else by the letter and it was outrageously good. I used red enchilada sauce cause I didn't think it would look right with green and I'm glad I did. It had a bit of a spicy bite on the back of my tongue but it was the perfect amount of spice for hubby, in fact it is back by popular demand again tomorrow night.

Excellent beef enchilada recipe! I used ground venison instead. Fantastic. Also poured some enchilada sauce into the baking pan before adding the enchiladas and then a bit more on top of everything. A meal for the whole family!

It tastes fantastic and takes less time than other recipes.

The only criticism I have is that the sauce is pretty thin, and that makes it hard to get onto your plate.

Once it's on your plate though, delicious!

These enchiladas are absolutely delicious, exactly as the recipe is written.  I've made them 3 times now in the last month, and everyone that has tried them raved about them.  I've tried both red and green enchilada sauce and, while the red may look better, the green chile enchilada sauce was our favorite flavor.

My family LOVED this recipe BUT I only used ONE POUND of beef.  In my opinion, 2 would’ve been entirely too much unless you doubled everything, including the number of tortillas.

Made these according to the recipe with one exception. I used two tablespoons of taco seasoning instead of one. The chili powder was overpowering, so next time I will use less, probably one teaspoon only. Also, I would increase the cheese on top to 1/2 cup instead of a 1/4. Good recipe, only minor changes necessary for my family’s taste.

My husband really liked it! I found it had too much chili powder for my tastes (but next time I could adjust)

I will for sure make these beef enchiladas again because of how great the taste was. Also while making these I made some vegan enchiladas which turned out pretty great too but not as good as these.

It sounded good.  I usually make sour cream chicken enchiladas but I thought I'd try meat.  I'm sorry but I just didn't care for this.  It didn't really have a 'kick' and was bland.  Everyone's taste is different.  Hubby agreed, we'll go back to our chicken enchiladas.

No changes from the original recipe. Overall, ended up being a little too greasy for our liking. Also lacking in flavor. Might up the seasoning next time and go with a leaner meat.

Came out pretty good, I will try to make this a second time to see if I can do a better job as this time I think I made the filling too runny.  I used a taco seasoning and enchilada sauce recipe from this site, neither of which have I tried in any other recipes to this point, so any flaws could be from those recipes.  Over all, though, I like this dish.  Once I get it down, I will make double the beef and freeze half prior to adding the cheese and sour cream as a shortcut for the dish the next time I make it.  Would like to get the enchilada sauce right so I can freeze or can it and have that done ahead as well.

Made with what I had on hand.  No black beans or olives around but I sauteed some onion, red pepper, drained rotel, cumin and garlic with the ground beef.   Really tasty and would be even better if I had black beans.  Whipped up the 10 minute enchilada sauce on this site.  Husband said "this is excellent"

It was very tasty. Unfortunately I can't find enchilada sauce so I used salsa which still was very good.  I put 1/2 cup of salsa on the bottom of the dish, puts the enchiladas on top and then added some more salsa on top with a sprinkle of cheese and sliced olives.  It was excellent. Oh yes, I also added 1 tsp cumin and Chalulua sauce. :)

Really good.  I used regular canned beans instead of black ones as that is all I had in the house.  My husband loved them.  A little difficult to roll, but worth it in the end

I made these enchiladas for my family tonight. My husband is not much of a Mexican food person. He loved them. When I made them, I found I had no taco seasoning. I found a recipe for taco Seasoning by KATHYESG called "Homemade Taco Seasoning Mix". It gave the enchiladas great flavor. I give it a two thumbs up and will make this recipe again.

I made this receipe last night and my husband thought it was great.  I used cilantro instead of oregano.
I also made a black bean and corn salad and put that into the wraps instead of just black beans and olives.
Served extra salad on the side.

This was delicious! The only thing was that I ended up with way too much leftover meat, even after putting it over the top of the enchiladas. But that's ok, it made two extra lunches for me :) I also didn't have any black beans, so I used refried beans instead, and that worked just as well, so this is an adaptable recipe, too, which is great.

I made the dish minus the flour tortillas (subbed corn tortillas), black beans, parsley, and oregano.  I did take the advise of others and used the full packet of taco seasoning and added extra cheese.  The enchiladas were very flavorful, and the black olives give it a great taste too.  I highly recommend!

This was so easy and very good. I did a couple things differently. Used a 20oz can of the sauce, covering the bottom of the dish with a thin coating. And used a lot more cheese, cheddar and mexi blend. Also made it half there's just 2 of us. It is a keeper!

My 3 sons & husband all have different tastes, needless to say they’re all very picky. My entire family complimented me time & time again while eating dinner & I agree it was delicious & full of flavor. I opted to use the entire taco seasoning packet & I’m glad I did!! I highly recommend to try it!

I had ‘mystery meat’ in my freezer. I knew it was hamburger and onions with some kind of seasoning, but that was it. Made this recipe with it and my guy ate two HUGE servings of it. Next time I will use corn tortillas, not flour.  The flour were a bit tough to cut through. Good recipe!

I have made this several times and everyone loves it. However, I did make a few changes. I used about 2 1/4 pounds of hamburger, a pkg. of taco seasoning, and a large can of enchilada sauce.

This is a great recipe!  I followed it as written, but instead of using store-bought enchilada sauce I made the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce taken from this site.  I also omitted the black olives as I didn't have any on hand, and I am limiting my salt intake.  The finished dish was very, very tasty.  I served it with zucchini pasta sauteed in a little EVOO, freshly minced garlic, cilantro, parsley, scallions, diced onions, chopped baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, and fried ripe plantains on the side.  I will certainly be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Made it with pork tenderloin. Brazed the pork and shredded.  It turned out great. Will make again, perhaps with beef, probably not with burger but a brazed chuck roast.

Well I had to do my grocery shopping the day before a big snowstorm was forecast. Couldn’t get sliced olives. Used green enchilada sauce. I had bulk taco seasoning so I used 2 tablespoons. These turned out great and my family loved them I will definitely make them again with the sliced olives next time!

I had a big package of taco seasoning and I am not sure how much I put in but I added the other seasonings as directed. Then I goofed, I was thinking 10 ounces was 2 1/2 cups  enchiladas sauce so I put on about two cups of taco sauce on top. It turned out great.

I’m not the best at measuring ingredients, so I probably had more than 2lbs of hamburger and I definitely had more than 1/4 cup of onion.  I also used a full 28 oz can of enchilada sauce and more olives than the recipe called for.  Because of that, I had more than enough to fill 10 flour tortillas which is what I did.  I also added chopped green onions on top as others suggested.  My taste buds are either defective or extremely sophisticated.  Very few foods get them to stand up and take notice.  This was good, but just average for me.  My husband on the other hand loved it!  His first comment was “I hope you saved this one”.  Then he said it tasted more authentic than our local Mexican restaurant.

I most likely won’t make these again. I am not a fan of taco seasoning so did not care for that flavor. Also mine stuck to bottom of baking dish. I would recommend spraying the pan first. I thought they needed more sauce, too dry!

This is the best recipe I have found! These ingredients give the mix the best flavor! I use this recipe once a week at least! The only thing I change is that I add a whole package of chili powder and the taste is unbelievable! Love this!

This tasted good but I wouldn’t call it enchiladas because I don’t think meat sauce belongs on top. I expected red sauce only on top. It lost its enchilada sauce taste with the taco seasoning too.

Delicious recipe.  I omitted the olives (not a fan), but pretty much stuck to what was written.  Very well-received by the family.  I'll make it again.

One of the best beef enchilada recipes I've tried, including some from restaurants.  I used 2 large cloves of garlic instead of the recommended 1 clove.

This was very good. The whole family liked it. I did use more garlic (we love garlic so whenever a recipe calls for 1 clove we use 3-4) and added more cheese on the top. It was delicious! This will be added to our regular rotation, for sure!

Thought it might be too soupy at first but added more cheese — Swiss slices — and added some creamed corn and man was in good. Like review suggested I used a whole package of taco seasoning and it had a kick. Too spicy for our Thai student so we just added sour cream and voila!

Very disappointed, lacking flavor. I did use corn tortillas, they did add flavor that flour ones would not have. I did use mild, red enchilada sauce,  maybe I should have used hot. Might try again in the future with a few changes.

I made this recipe exactly as it's written. There's too much chili seasoning. Far too spicy. Also, it's bland, which was a surprise considering the ingredients. Very disappointing. Won't make again.

This was a huge hit! I used the whole packet of taco seasoning as recommended. I also added green, red and orange bell peppers. I made half with beef and half with shredded chicken. Put the peppers and onions in with the meats to let them cook down. Family said it was a 10 pout

I did not add meat mixture to sauce. Put  sauce on each side of tortilla before adding meat sauce. By far the best I have ever had and my family thought the same.

These were the best beef enchiladas I have ever had. I followed the recipe but excluded the black olives. I made homemade enchilada sauce (recipe on allrecipes). I used some of the meat mixture and poured it on top.

Made it yesterday for us but shared it with another couple as since living on a farm something always comes up.  It was really a hit ….. didn't change anything but olives ….only because my husband doesn't care for them but am sure they would make this even better if possible.  Plan to make again soon.   Love it !!!!!!!

These were very good. I think a little more sauce poured on top would have been good but next time I'll just make more. The flavor was great and my husband loved this meal as well. Leftovers tasted great too!  They reheated well. Oh, and as many others did, I used the whole packet of taco seasoning as well. Glad I did.

My husband called these Yankee enchiladas. I agree. They’re nothing like Texas enchiladas. They’re a Texas burrito you eat with a knife and fork. Good flavor, but I won’t make them again.

Not spicy enough. Next time add more chili powder and maybe jalapenos. I couldn't roll tortillas so next time just layer them for a layered enchilada. I also added chopped green onion on top.

This is the first review I've ever done,  but I had to comment just because as written this recipe is extremely frustrating.  I had WAY more meat than could fit in the tortillas, and what did fit completely spilled all out when you tried to put the enchilada in the pan.  And after that, the tortillas completely opened up or broke into several pieces.  I wound up layering the remaining meat and tortillas on top like a Mexican lasagne.  This is what I would suggest for the entire recipe.  Once baked, the casserole had good flavor, but I would never attempt to make these into enchiladas again.

I absolutely love this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to follow many other reviewer's suggestions and use the entire packet of taco seasoning.  These enchiladas are divine!  The seasoning is JUST RIGHT when you do this.  The combination of the ground beef, olives, and black beans is right on.  (and I'm not a huge fan of either olives or black beans)  The texture and flavor couldn't be better.  I'm going to frame this recipe to use it again and again!!

I actually made almost no changes to this recipe!! That very rarely happens! I added a bit more taco seasoning and more chili powder because we like a little more kick. And of course I used more cheese than called for!  But basically any changes to this recipe would be to tweak it to your taste. Otherwise it's great as is!

Excellent go to enchilada recipe! I did use the whole packet of taco seasoning and added cayenne pepper to give it just a little kick. Will definitely make this again.

Made a mistake and accidentally added enchilada sauce to meat mixture before the cheese/sour cream.  We don't like black bean so I substituted refried beans. Had a big amount of meat mixture left over after filling tortillas so I used that over the top along with the shredded cheese. I think the sour cream put me off a bit with the taste. Wasn't bad - but I don't think I'd make this again.

I made this as an Enchilada Torte. I used CORN tortillas and dipped them in the enchilada sauce then layered them alternating meat, extra cheese and tortillas. I  poured the extra enchilada sauce over the whole thing and added the olives and more cheese on top. I baked it for 30 minutes and put it on broil for an additional 5 minutes. I had sour cream, shredded lettuce and salsa to add on top and it was terrific!

Made these last night with homemade flour tortillas that I had made earlier in the day. Not thinking, I opened the taco seasoning and dumped the whole packet in - came out great anyway!! Wonderful flavor, great sauciness! Will be a keeper for me. Going to make with shredded chicken next time.

Three days later, and these just keep getting tastier. I did not have any cilantro, but everything else was prepared as directed. Served with fresh avocado and sour cream on the side. Most definitely the best recipe for beef enchiladas on this site. Yum!

This is just assembly instructions. Share a recipe of enchilada sauce with this and you've got something I'm interested in. This recipe reads like one would see on the back of an enchilada sauce can.

This was great -- I stuck to the ingredients listed (except I used ground turkey meat) and adjusted the proportions to my liking (I upped the taco seasoning  and herbs). My advice would be to start with the exact recipe and adjust to your taste as you go --NOT when you're finished!

The first enchiladas I've ever made.  Used the recipe as a general guideline for example used one whole onion rather than less.  Added more garlic just because.  I was concerned that the filling was going to be too soppy but no, it was just perfect.  My family loved this recipe as well.  Will absolutely make it again!

I used the whole onion and only 1 lb of ground beef (5%fat).  I made 6 taco size flour and 6 corn. Making 8 with 2 lb of beef - they must be huge.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to use a whole packet of taco seasoning. I used corn tortillas instead of flour and used pinto beans with jalapeños instead of black beans. The filling was a bit runny. I warmed the tortillas up before filling them and put a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan before starting. I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and topped with sliced jalapeños instead of black olives. These turned out pretty good. Thanks for the recipe:)

This was very good, I used 3 tbsp taco seasoning and it was great. Also, make sure you line this dish with parchment paper or spray with Pam so it does not stick. I learned this the hard way...so take note folks! ** served on top of brown calrose rice.."yummm", was the response.

This was my super delicious first time making Mexican food! I used small white corn tortillas. 1.5 lb ground beef with generous minced garlic. I also used a large can of las palmas red enchilada sauce, spreading the baking pan with it and then topping off with it since there was quite a bit extra. I used an entire packet of taco seasoning, I think the brand really determines the majority of your flavor. I used way more cheese than called for because the lady at target said "the cheesier the better." And I always listen to my elders

This is not very spicy so I added a little hot sauce to my portion. Other members of the family don't like much spice. I used corn tortillas instead of flour ones. We all enjoyed it. I'll be making it again.

These turned out so great! I made the taco seasoning & doubled the amount of it in the recipe. I also put more cheese on top. Put half of the sour cream into the mixture & dolloped the rest on each portion, right before I served them. Other than that, followed the recipe pretty closely.

it was good. the sauce ends up more like a spaghetti sauce than enchiladas sauce. I like the sauce and meat filling seperately, making the sauce stand out from the meat filling.
I won't make it again. it just wasn't my cup of tea. did I have leftovers? yes. Well I eat those leftovers? absolutely!

I made this using rice on the bottom, I used grilled lime/cilantro marinated chicken, and. It was really amazing. I also topped the enchiladas with chopped Hatch chilis before I put the cheese on which made the party in my mouth complete.

Very good.  Made the ground beef pretty much as stated except used taco seasoning and salsa along with the sour cream and cheese. Mixed cooked rice with refried  beans and layered in the shells with the beef mixture.  Baked with more cheese on top and drizzled enchiladas sauce on top.

I'm always looking for enchilada recipes that don't call for a can of soup. I didn't care for this, and now I know that I don't like ground beef in my enchiladas.

These were good, liked that they didn't have cream soup in them, and used low calorie sour cream. I tried to cut  the fat, also  just sprinkled with black olives, and also used the pkg of taco seasoning, and chili beans instead of chili powder and beans. GOOD

This was my first time making ground beef enchiladas and this recipe was delicious! I made a few modifications to work with what ingredients were on hand though . . . I used corn tortillas (fried quickly in some oil first to soften), I too used an entire packet of taco seasoning, I omitted the chili powder because the enchilada sauce I used had quite a bit of heat, and I omitted the olives. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was tasty, will definitely make again!

This is the only enchilada recipe I use. I've made it multiple times and it is always a hit. I always end up using a whole packet of taco seasoning so I don't have to save a little, but it doesn't hurt it at all. I finally bought a reusable container of the stuff so that I don't have to keep doing that.

My husband and I really liked these enchiladas.  The flavor was wonderful.  The only changes I made was to use corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.  I also used a different enchilada sauce.

I'll admit I didn't have a good idea when I made these, seriously mixing sour cream and cheese into the mixture sounded weird, regardless I went ahead. I didn't read where I needed to use the left over meat, beans, and olives on top. Regardless these were amazing! I think shredded beef might be an interesting take on this recipe also. I used the ten minute enchilada sauce from Allrecipes which really upped the flavor! Thanks for sharing!

I like this one and have made it twice now. Mix and match your favourite stuff - meats, cheeses, level of spice. Topped with melted nacho cheese instead of shreaded cheddar. Use red pintos instead of black beans. Mild sauce once and medium the next. Good stuff.

I made this last night and for never having made enchiladas before, I was thoroughly impressed.  I omitted the olives (cause I don't like cooked olives) and added some fresh diced tomatoes to the top along with excess beans.  I will definitely keep this as my go to recipe.

I thought this was very delicious and easy to prep. Even the leftovers were awesome.  I, too used an entire packet of taco seasoning and doubled the recipe.

We absolutely love these! we took out the olives because nobody in our family likes them but added more cheese on top. They're really great and I have this recipe saved.

Very tasty!  We omitted the olives and used cumin and cilantro for the taco seasoning.  1 pound of ground meat was enough for us.  Everything else was the same measurement though.  I held back some of the enchilada sauce to use right before baking.

Really great!

Wonderful, many variations possible but basic recipe is great.  I used small can green chili enchilada sauce, kidney beans (loved the color addition), corn tortillas.  Even my kids liked it and wanted to know how I'd gotten the "real" mexican taste.

These were delicious!  I used ground turkey and you couldn't tell the difference.  Like one of the other reviewers I also mistakenly used the whole taco seasoning packet out of habit but it wasn't a problem.  That combined with the chili powder made them a little spicy but again, no problem for us.  I added the cheese topping with 5 minutes left because I didn't want it to get too hard.  Yum!!! I will make these again.

Great recipe.  Also easy and versatile.  I substituted cooked rice for the beans.  Since I only had 5 flour tortillas  I used half of the meat mixture and made enchiladas, and used the remaining meat mixture and stuffed a couple of  poblano peppers,  using about 1/2 cup if enchilada sauce to pour over the peppers before baking.   The enchiladas were excellent and the stuffed peppers were the best!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

No changes to the listed ingredients but even after simmering, filling was still too thin;  an extra half cup of cheese fixed it right up.  Great flavors and the flour tortillas were perfectfor me since I don't care for any other.  Served with a Mexican rice dish (also from All Recipes), refried beans and thick slices of fresh tomatoes.

This was very good and the perfect dish to make with leftover taco night.  Made as directed, but threw is some ground taco meat I  had in the fridge.  Topped with sour cream, shredded lettuce and cilantro.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!!

Amazing & easy. Used one lb. of beef by accident, but used a slotted spoon to fill the tortillas and had extra sauce... Only had 1/4 c. of sauce go to waste, but the 7 enchiladas was MORE than enough for our small family!

I enjoy making enchiladas for dinner, but didn't have a good beef recipe.....until now! Made this tonight using about half of the original recipe resulting in 8 yummy beef enchiladas. I made my own taco seasoning and homemade enchilada sauce - did not use the olives as I'm not a fan. One thing I did was to mix in my own cooked-from-dried black beans in with the filling. Two other changes: I mixed half sour cream and half Greek yogurt instead of straight sour cream (don't think we could tell any difference) and I used less enchilada sauce than usual and spooned it sparingly on top of the filled enchiladas then topped with enough grated cheddar, but not a heavy amount. These enchiladas were in the ranks of the best that I've ever made! I don't know if I have seen a recipe that included sour cream in the filling but my son and I are very happy with this recipe! A big thanks to the country_cooker!

3/3/17 made this recipe again last night but added in some fresh veggies for a change along with 1/2 lb ground beef; I used diced zucchini, diced bell pepper, diced onion, and a handful or two of frozen corn --- so good!

Third time making it, twice with red chilli enchilada sauce and once with green. All times were really good and super easy.  frying the tortillas for just a little bit in oil before you roll them is a nice addition.

This recipe is a hit! I did, however, sub. the standard tortillas for the Old El Paso "stand n stuff" tortillas. There are eight to a package and, like a bowl, you just fill them up. This worked great.

This was amazing!  I made some changes since I did not have some of the ingredients.  I did not add enchilada sauce, and I did not add the black olives or black beans.  I made a sour cream sauce that I poured on top.  Sour cream sauce: Melt 1/4 c of butter on a skillet.  Add a 1/4 c. of flour.  Slow pour 2c of chicken broth.  Once it starts bubbling a little bit. Reduce heat and add 1c of sour cream.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.  Amazing!  It was a hit with my kiddos and hubby.

I'm just learning how to cook. This was perfect for me as a beginner. I made 4 enchiladas as I'm usually cooking for one. It was DELICIOUS and very easy to make. I did not change one thing. It's very filling, I couldn't eat more than one!!

This recipe was great. I have made it at least 4 times. Each time I edit it accordingly. Each time Ive made it my husband says WOW. This is a keeper. Make sure to add cilantro, red onion, and lots of cheddar cheese. Jalapenos, and avocados are also a must I made my own guacamole. ENJOY!

So good, and so much easier than the way I made it previously! I used homemade taco seasoning, and nixed the olives and beans due to preferences, and I am actually starting to crave these just thinking about how good they were!! I recommend to everyone! :) *I also poured some enchilada sauce in the pan first, as my family loves saucy enchiladas!

very delicious and flavourful! my man and i aren't a huge fan of black olives, so i omitted them. everything else in this recipe is perfect! in an attempt to knock up the spice, i added cayenne pepper and hot salsa to the meat sauce. also added cumin and corn. will definitely be holding on to this recipe, it's awesome!

Great recipe, I found a recipe for enchilada sauce as well and just used my own spice combination in lieu of storebought enchilada sauce or taco seasonings. As I've never even seen enchiladas before in my life I can't speak as to how authentic these are but I personally found them kind of dry. Will use more sauce next time.

Really easy recipe and extremely tasty even for picky eaters.  I substituted taco sauce for the seasoning and left out the sour cream...and they were awesome!  Thanks for share..this is something we will be making again.

It is hard to please my family with any Mexican meal, but they loved this one!  I followed the recipe as is.  The only suggestion I might make is to reduce the amount of enchilada sauce to 2 cups.  The amount suggested here made the dish a bit too runny for my taste.  Yummy!

These were delish! I didn't really change anything, other than poured leftover enchilada sauce over the top after serving(kiddos were eating them too so I had to watch the spice). I think this was the first time my husband didn't request hot sauce to put on them to!!!

I have been cooking for 38 yrs. & I get bored with cooking so I like to hunt for new recipes to try...I tripled this recipe & turned it into a casserole because I had run out of time.  I followed it to the letter except, instead of rolling, I layered.  I thought I was being smart by tripling the recipe...1/2 for tonight and the other 1/2 for another night.  Wrong!!! My family loved this so much that they ate the whole thing!!  I definitely will be making this again!!  Thanks so much for sharing it!!!

Very good - I did add some Cayenne Pepper per Winston's comment.  I made 4 on a bed of Spanish Rice and have well over half left; going to try and see how it works as a freezer meal.
