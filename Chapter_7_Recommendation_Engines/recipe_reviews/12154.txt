This was a very good pie.  However, this is a very sweet, dark chocoate pie.  Not a creamy, milk chocolate flavor.  I like the milk chocolate flavor better, as do most people I know.  This is great if you are a dark, bitter-sweet chocolate lover.  I probably won't make this again for myself or my husband (will just use pie filling for a creamier chocolate).  However, my mother-in-law loved it.  She likes the dark chocoate and said it tasted just like her mother used to make.

This recipe was very good. I added an extra 1 oz square of chocolate and 2 tablespoons of almond extract and it came out heavenly.  I think next time I'll add 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk to make it creamier.

This was wonderful-I served it to some friends who are chocolate lovers who declared it was the best pie they had ever eaten.  I used a chocolate cookie crust and topped it with Cool Whip.

Delicious!! Very creamy and chocolatey. Family loved this pie. I had found another recipe that called for 8 oz. of chopped bittersweet chocolate...but hesitated as this recipe called for only 2 oz. of unsweetened. Glad I followed this recipe...the 2 oz. was the perfect amount of chocolate...could only imagine what it would be like with 8!! The custard thickened up with no problem...chilled in a baked pie shell and topped with whipped cream and shaved hershey kisses (all I had )..will make this again! Thanks for a fabulous pie Debbie!

Absolutely delicious pie!! I have made it many times and want to thank you for sharing the recipe. Tastes just like the old fashioned ones my Mom-in-Law made. Unfortunately, Mom never wrote much down, so I am stuck with lots of ingredient lists and not many instructions! Like anything else the quality of the ingredients determines the end results. I have made this pie with Ghiardelli Dark Bars, Valhrona and Lindt 83% Dark and Scharffenburger. Both individually and in varying amounts of each mixed. All with excellent results. They cost a bit more, but the results are worth it. I sometimes cut down on the sugar just a smidgen-1 tablespoon-- depending on what kind of chocolate I am using.

Perfect chocolate custard pie recipe.  I suspect that those reviewers who had texture issues had trouble with bringing the custard together. You must temper the eggs by slowly adding hot chocolate mixture while beating rapidly, otherwise, they will start to cook and you will end up with a rubbery custard.  This custard can also end up runny if you don't cook the eggs enough after returning to the stove top.  If you have a candy thermometer, bring your mixture to 170 degrees.  If not, make sure the mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon so that if you drag a fingertip through the mixture the spoon retains a clean line for several seconds.

Best Chocolate Pie I've had!  It has been a hit with friends and family.  The best part is that it is really easy to make for those "inexperienced pie makers".

A wonderful pie recipe that all of my friends and family enjoyed very much! Use a graham cracker crust just to top off that delicious dessert flavor. Pile high with Reddi-Whip for a straight-from-the-bakery look. No one believed that I made this pie myself; they accused me of ordering it from a gourmet restaurant. It's THAT good!

Added ~1/4 tsp salt.  Delicious.  I made it in the microwave w/no problems.  This is a dense chocolate - I suppose if you wanted a lighter pie you could fold stiffly whipped cream w/some gelatine into the chocolate before pouring into the crust, but I like the whipped cream on top.  Fudge-y chocolate, crisp crust, and the whipped cream...mmmmm! I've made it 2x already!

Well, I must confess I am the world's WORST baker. Seriously, even if I am cooking ready made cookie dough or a cake from the box, somehow I find a way to mess it up. That said, I was so delighted to find dessert recipe that turned out great, no matter how I butchered it. I did add an extra square of chocolate. I mean, what's not to like?

I was disappointed in this pie. Mine came out too bitter, and had the taste and texture of fudge, not a cream pie. Sorry, but will not try again.

This pie was exceptional!!  The only changes I made were instead of adding 2 cups of milk, I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream.  I also used a "heaping" 1/3 c of flour as well.  Next time I will probably cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup as it was very rich.  I made some fresh whipping cream and got rave reviews from my family.  Will add this to my favorites for sure.

I've made this twice now and it is the perfect chocolate pie.  Mine turned out very rich and creamy.  The second time I used more milk and an extra square of chocolate to make more filling and that one was almost too chocolately, so I will stick to 2 squares in the future.  I will say I think the cooking times listed aren't enough.  I stirred the mixture for at least 5 minutes, if not more before it thickened enough, and then I cooked it for 3 more after I added the warm yolks.

I made this pie twice.  The first time exactly as the recipe was written.  It was good but didn't set up quite as well as I wanted.  Still very good.
The second time I made it, I used Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet chocolate and after adding all ingredients together, instead of cooking only 90 seconds, I cooked for 3 minutes.  When I turned the burner off, I let the mixture "rest" for an additional 2 minutes.  When I poured into the pie shell all it had to do was cool completely in the fridge.  Add the whipped topping and shavings of the same chocolate and it was great.  There wasn't any left.  Everyone loved this recipe.  Will definitely make this again and again.
Thank you.

Recipe does need a little salt.  This pie was too dense for us; prefer a nice creamy, silky pie.

I have made various versions of this and i have a few tips. If you want to use white chocolate add an extra oz. Start it of as if you were making bechamel, the indicated amount of butter, then the flour and cook it till it smells nutty. Then add the sugar (no need to add less sugar, it won't turn out as sweet as you'd think), then the milk and chocolate. That way you won't taste the flour, since white chocolate isn't tasty enough to cover it up (i learnt it the hard way and it took a more than generous splash of vanilla to fix it up) I top it with chopped strawberrys and it's a hit when entertaining (anything topped with strawberrys looks so conneticut you'll leave everyone thinking martha stewart catered) once i also felt like eating this and didnt have any chocolate, turns out half a pot of chocolate frosting (betty crocker, but that's just cause i had some in the fridge for late night picking) does the trick (cut a bit of sugar off) One other thing, don't waste the eggwhites make a pav top it with some more stbrrys.

This was a pretty easy recipe to follow.  The only thing is that I had to add a little more sugar to it, since it wasn't as sweet as I had anticipated.  I think the next time I make this, I'm going to use semisweet squares instead of unsweetened.

The taste was pretty good but it was very runny.  I followed this recipe exactly and have no idea where I went wrong.  I even made it two days before I was serving it and it never set. Oh well.

I live in Joplin, MO and lost my home in the May 22nd tornado.  Of course I also lost all my cookbooks and recipes.  This is a pie that I used to make every holiday - I have to make several so folks can take them home.  I'm very happy to find this.  It makes a great, dark chocolatey pie!

I've made this pie twice now. I found the original recipe too sweet for my liking and not quite enough quantity to fill a shell, so the second time I used 3 cups of milk and 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate instead of 2. I left the sugar amount the same, but threw in a wee bit extra flour and egg yolk. It set up perfectly and this time it filled the shell right to the rim. If you're a dark chocolate lover like I am, you'll be really pleased with this recipe.

I was hoping this would be alot better than it was. To me it was just like a Jello pudding pie, so if you like that, you'll love this.  But I was really hoping for something lighter and creamier.

Fabulous pie! I doubled the recipe and used half and half because I was out of milk and added an extra square of chocolate.  My husband said he would marry me if he already hadn't !

This is an excellent pie! We are not dark chocolate fans in our home so I modified it a bit and used 6 oz of chocolate chips. It turned out wonderfully, rich , creamy and smooth. I also made another one and used butterschotch chips and it was very yummy! My husband wants me to try using the peanutbutter chips soon!

Made this just as the recipe stated. Definately a keeper easy and good. I will use a regular pie crust next time though not the deep dish. Served it with cool whip and it was first pie to go.

Not sure I would make this again.  It tastes good, but it did not set up that firm and I think it's harder to come together using flour.  I ended up pushing the custard through a sieve to remove the lumps.  I will probably search for a recipe using cornstarch instead.

I am an excellent baker.  I know my way around baking pies, cookies, cakes, etc.  However after I followed this recipe to the letter, the pie absolutely never set.  I tried chilling it overnight and then I tried to freeze it and it really lost the consistency. It was a shame because the crust was absolutely scratched baked awesome.

Delicious. It did set up nicely. While it was a darker chocolate, I did not think that it had a bitter dark chocolate taste at all. It was rich and creamy.

This recipe turned out great.  I used 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares.  Otherwise, used exact ingredients.  I made it all in the microwave.  Easy, just watch and stir often.  No worry of burning.  It thickens quick, but just stir often and it works great.

This was delicious as far as taste goes but just didn't set up well.  I cooked it for a long time to try to get it to "bubble".  It kept getting thicker and thicker and was afraid that it would burn.  Saw where another reviewer said to cook it longer after adding the yolks or it would be runny.  I will try it again to see what happens.  Ended up making meringue, baked on parchment paper to add to top of pie since one reviewer said her pie was runny after putting it in the oven with meringue.  This worked fine.

This came out great.  I substituted the chocolate with 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 2 (instead of 1) teaspoons of vanilla, and grahamcracker crust.  I ate it right out of the bowl!

Good, I made some changes though. 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour, 2 cups half and half instead of milk, 1/2 bar 98% cacao chocolate with a handful of dark chips for chocolate, and I skipped the butter. Kept the sugar, yolks and vanilla the same. Amazing!

This pie was so good! Mine came out pretty thick, which was fine. I put in extra dark chocolate and covered the bottom of my crust with banana slices, I also topped it with banana flavored whipped cream. It was very good.. Everyone who has tried it has loved it.

Modiifed this recipe for a DEEP DISH pie pan.  Simply double all ingredients EXCEPT the milk . . . use only 3 cups of milk.  Filling went nearly to the rim, which is good if you want more chocolate filling than whip cream.  We let set over night and had for dessert the following evening.  Yummy, we will make again.

I made an oreo crust for the pie and it was good. I didn't think it was really a dark chocolate like many others did, but a nice chocolate pie. I had issues with lumps, but no one could tell because I covered it in my homemade whipped cream, then added some chocolate curls on top.

Tastes good, but the day after I tried the recipe, the pie started «melting» ... kind of. I consider myself a good cook and I bake quite often, maybe I made a mistake or something, I don't know, however, the filling got set and all, but started melting the day after... has this happened to somedoby else??

I suggest using a graham cracker crust and use the egg white for mirangue (sp sorry)...very good.  Mirangue is simple, beat whites til foamy then add, slowley 6 tbs of sugar until stiff.  Put on top of pie and back (in pre heated 350 oven until mirangue is brown)

Don't change a thing.  Follow this recipe to the letter.  This pie is the BEST ccp I've ever made and tasted.  Most people I serve this to say, "Oh, I thought chocolate cream pie was made with instant pudding."  Instant pudding?  YUCK!  This pie is a labor of  love and I am so happy to have found it.  It is rich and creamy and best served the next day.  I also put a sheet of plastic wrap over the hot pie to prevent "skin" on the top.  Excellent.

This is a pretty good recipe. I've used it about six times. The only change I make it to actually use Semi-sweet chocolate chips (Preferably Ghirardelli chocolate chips!!) instead of unsweetened chocolate. This adds a creamier lighter taste to the pie so that it's not SOOO rich like with the unsweetened chocolate. Overall though, it's a great recipe.

Definitely not the best cream pie I have ever made.  For the end result, it would be much easier to just make an instant pudding pie. I was expecting something that tasted like it was homemade, and the extra effort wasn't worth it for a run of the mill pie.

I made the pie today. Instead of using unsweetened chocolate, I used 2 ozs of semi-sweet chocolate morsels and I used the egg whites for meringue. My husband said it was the best pie that I ever made.

This is an awesome recipe. I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving in a graham cracker crust. My dad went back for thirds, and he usually only does that with pumpkin pie. I'll definately make this one again; plus, it's super-easy.

I made this recipe for a friend who loves chocolate pie.  I used a ready made crust for this and it was very easy and came out delicious!!  My friend really liked it and my family did as well.  The chocolate was so tasty!  We will definitely use this recipe again.

The taste was very good, we topped it with peppermint whip cream and used a graham cracker crust, however the directions were not the best. After making the pie, I realized I should have watched the video. When combining the milk, flour, sugar and chocolate, the flour was getting all lumpy and I had to eventually strain the whole thing. Such a waste of time! Upon straining the mixture, it never settled and the next day it was basically a pudding pie! Author should have been more careful with her directions, as was the video. After reading reviews, next time  I'll use 3.5 tbl corn starch in lieu of the flour and cook the yolks for 3 minutes instead of just 90 seconds. I'll make again with these changes and watching the video...

The filling is very tasty, but it never set properly. I put it in the freezer, and now it has more or a sorbet texture to it. Definitely worth the shot, but it was just overall ok.

This is a keeper for me. The only variation I made was using cocoa (3 TBSP + 1 TBSP vegetable oil = 1 square of chocolate) instead of chocolate as that is what I had. I made 1.5 times the filling for a deep dish pie pan and it was the perfect fit. It may not be as sweet as other pies but I didn't want really sweet. If you like it sweeter add a little more sugar. Make sure you are patient making the filling, whisking the whole time until it gets thick like a thin pudding. Made a Crisco crust and pre-baked for 30 minutes. This reminds me of my aunt's recipe.

It is the best I have ever had. People who say they have used  cool whip on this pie are NUTS. First of all why would you go through the effort to make this and then put cool whip on it....Fresh cream only cooks.....instant pudding is the same I read...are you joking. This is worth every minute rich and creamy. I would also think a coffee flavoring would work as well.

This pie was delicious as is! My daughter made it and wasn’t careful while tempering the eggs causing some little “chunks” in it but you didnt even notice.  I would definitely make this again. Very easy.

I attempted to make this pie as it is one of my favorites.  It did not come out very well (my poor baking skills); it did not set up and I had to throw it out, but I ate a great deal of it "on its way out."

This recipe was definitely too sweet, if I use this recipe again I would decrease the sugar to one cup or less. Not only was it way too sweet, but it barely thickened at all. I let it boil for 2-3 min, and it was still thinner than most puddings. I might use this as a base recipe again, but with quite a few variations.

I made this recipe for family, and now they ask for it all the time.  We love it, sweet and creamy, I top it with cool whip, and shredded Hershey's Candy bar.  I tried to top with hershey squares of the bar, but you want to refrigerate the pie after making and they are too hard to bite into after refrigeration.  I recommend not topping with cool whip until the day you are serving, and do not cover in refrigerator with plastic lid, it gathers moisture.  I am not sure what another baker did wrong that it was not sweet enough.  My family loves chocolate and are sweet lovers, and they love this pie, but it has to be Chocolate Cream Pie I not Chocolate Cream Pie II.  For some reason I did not like that recipe as much as Chocolate Cream Pie I.  I have also had requests made by people where I work, because I brought it to a pot luck meeting one time.  It has been requested as a birthday gift for workers.  Thanks for the recipe, and the availability to change servings sizes.  I come from a family of 12 : )
Happy Easter

This was a huge hit at my house.  The chocolate was more like dark chocolate, which I loved.  I did use 1/2 square of sweeten chocolate and I think that might have made the difference.  At the demand of my family, I will be making this again this week.

Loved the base recipe. I only had semi-sweet squares so I cut down on the sugar to 1/4 cup because I used two cups of chocolate milk instead of regular.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it is beautiful! The texture is just right! I dont know how different the flavor is from the base recipe, but mine was delicious! Thanks for a great starter!

This a great chocolate pie recipe if you want something relatively simple.  I don't have electric beaters and didn't feel like whipping cream by hand, so I was excited to find this recipe.  It came out great!

The filling was fine when put into the pie shell, but I added a meringue and baked it for an additional 12 minutes. Big mistake!  After cooling on wire rack for an hour, and 4 hours in the frige, pie became runny. Will try again without meringue and hope for better results.

This particular recipe was pretty easy to use and very tasty.  I added a couple tablespoons of very strong (day old) coffee while cooking. Topped with whipped cream w/almond extract. .....To the reviewer who complained that this was simply chocolate pudding on a pie crust: Yes, that's basically what a chocolate cream pie is. Beautiful simplicity.

I made this using Cocoa Powder instead of the baking bars. I also added in about 1/2 c. Whipped Heavy Whipping Cream and Cream Cheese mixture to the finished product before it cooled using a hand mixer. Then I added it to a Graham Cracker Pie Shell. This pie was trying to set before it even got in the refrigerator. When it was serving time, it was the perfect texture! It was the best pie I've ever had. My husband said it was better then his mom's. Woohoo!!! This is #1 on our desert list!

I made this at my 9 year old request for a pie she would actually want to eat.  I followed the recipe exactly to the T and it was very easy and quick to make.  We used a Oreo premade crust.   It is a bit too sweet for me but my daughter and mom loved it and ate most of it with lots of milk.

Sorry but I was rather dissapointed with this recipe. I made this twice in the past week. One I gave away for a birthday and the other I made yesterday for my family. I have no idea how the first one turned out since I did not eat it. The second one never set up right for some reason. It was just like choc. pudding on top of pie crust. One of my children would didn't even like it (which is CRAZY since they all LOVE anything sweet)

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and I felt there was very little flavor in the dish.

Make sure you double this recipe to fill a pie plate up!  Little bit skimpy the way it is, also, cut the amount of sugar used by 1/3 - way too sweet the way it is.

Followed the directions exactly how they are and it came out perfect!  First time making this kind of pie and I will definately be doing it again soon!  Used Graham cracker crust and topped with cool Whip and Chocolate Chips.
UPDATE: Make sure that you use whole milk with this recipe because anything less and it won't come out as good. I learned my lesson the 2nd time I made it.

I made this and it didn't come out very good the chocolate was soupy and lumpy and never set and the flavor wasn't that good either. Next time I will try a graham cracker crust and I will beat the ingredients before I heat them to get it fluffier. Not sure how to get it to set though. Homemade whipped cream on top was a nice touch to my chocolate glop.

This pie was excellent, very chocolatey.  Just what I was looking for.  It was so easy to make, don't know why people settle for pudding pie filling when they can easily make this.  FYI:  I found that the pie taste better the next day.

Fantastic, Quick, and Impressive!!  This pie fit the bill for me!  It is smooth and silky.  I of course wanted a pie at 7pm at night and went in search of a dessert to match the ingredients I had on hand.  This was almost perfect.  I did have to use self rising flour and chocolate chips, but the result was amazing.  I used a graham cracker crust which I think really made it almost like smores and I whipped up fresh whipped cream and spread it atop the entire pie!  I finished with grated chocolate on top and WOW my husband and I both savored every bite.  I put it in the freezer to "chill" for 2 hours, since of course I was not going to bed without a slice.  But after I cut it I put it in the fridge to finish chilling and cannot wait for dessert tonight.  I put it in my favorites cook book and I will make it again.  Next time with the correct flour and chocolate and see how that works out!  But I will stick to the graham cracker crust, I think the regular crust would not be as good as the buttery graham cracker crust!  Thanks Debbie!!

Great recipe and so delicious.  I made this with 1 cup 2% milk, and 1 cup fat free half & half, used the 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate but did add an additional 1-2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips to make it a bit more chcolatey.  It was a total hit at the party I took it to with several asking for the recipe.  Thanks so much Debbie, I will be making this for years to come!  So easy!

I found this same recipe in my old Red and White Betty Crocker cookbook. I only made one change, instead of unsweetened chocolate squares I used 2 ounces of ghiradelli dark chocolate squares because that was what I had. They were serious dark chocolate though like 85% cacao, I kept the sugar the same figuring it would be almost like unsweetened chocolate. I topped this with a 3 egg white meringue. This is an awesome pie. Simple recipe and the chocolate filling is soooo good!

Absolutely decadent!  I used skim milk and lite cool whip topping; other wise, I followed the recipe to a "T".  This was my first attempt at chocolate cream pie and I wouldn't make it any other way.  I didn't find the chocolate too dark or not sweet enough, as other reviewers suggested.  Perfection in a pie shell!

This was a deliciously chocolate pie.  I may have cooked it a little too long as the texture was a bit too stiff.  I am going to try it again and hopefully get a little bit softer result.

This pie tastes wonderful, however, it did not set and was rather runny. I think it needs longer than 90 seconds to cook in order to thicken.

This came out GREAT on my first attempt!.  The instructions are very spot on, and the flavors are incredible.  The only danger is really when you temper the egg yolks, but I was slow and patient and it worked out fine.  This is now my go to for chocolate cream pie.

This was really good. I added a touch more sugar(as I do to all desserts), and it turned out well. The batter was thick, so it didn't leak out at all when cut, but it also wasn't dense.

It tasted pretty close to the taste of half cooked brownie batter, which I personally loved.

My brother said it tasted like it had peanut butter in it. But  I didn't get that impression at all.

My kids felt this was too much chocolate, which is crazy to say. It is very rich and not super sweet. I added Cool Whip to the top of the pie and it helped balance it out. I loved how easy it was to put together.

My pie is cooling as we speak. Generally I do not like to make changes to original recipes,  but I had no regular milk, so I used silk coconut milk. It does taste good, but a tad on the coconut side… Not what I was after – but go figure! I read a reviewer  say she had added a quarter teaspoon salt. That was the first thing I thought of after tasting mine. Oh! And I did have to use unsweetened cocoa powder as I had no unsweetened chocolate! I do think I got enough chocolate in there. I will top this With real whipped cream – now wondering why I didn’t use whipped cream or even the half-and-half that I have in my fridge in lieu of the coconut milk! Oh goodness. 
Well,  don’t count my four star rating toward a pie that is sure to be five star if made correctly! I’m sure we’ll  enjoy this one – – just won’t be quite what I  had intended to make! Happy baking all!!!  ??

I made a diabetic-friendly version for my husband.  I used sugar-free shortbread cookies with Splenda and butter for the crust.  Then I just substituted  Splenda (1 cup) for sugar in the filling.  Oh my goodness!  My hunnie thinks I have received a recipe from Heaven.  He LOVED  it.  Wants it every week.  So easy to make too.

I used the 3 egg whites to make meringue for the topping. I heated the pie with the meringue for 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven. After that it should cool in the refrigerator overnight. The pie tasted superb.

Sorry, but this review is of this general recipe, and not 100% as listed.
We did not have enough Nutella (we only  
had a  half-jar of Fundelina actually), so we had to substitute  the other half using Biscoff creamy spread. This gave it a graham crackery smores-like flavor. It was good the first night, but even better the second night as the pie had a thicker, less moussey consistency that we preferred. 
Bottom line. Easy. Quick. Tasty dessert without a  lot of fuss.

I made this with a graham cracker crust (1 1/2 cups of crushed crackers and 6 Tbsp.  melted butter. Baked at 350  for five minutes or so.) Next time that I make it, I’ll try reducing the amount of sugar in the chocolate cream.  This was a big hit at the party.

Use semi sweet chocolate and this will turn out incredibly fluffy and sweet. I crumbled up some cosmo brownies (removed the candy topping) and pressed into a pie crust. Baked the crust at 375 for 5 minutes then poured the topping over to chill. I only added powder sugar for my topping. No whipped cream. It was incredible.

I used dark chocolate squares 70% cocoa instead of the unsweetened squares. 1 tbsp of cocoa powder and 1 tbsp of dark roast coffee (from cup of coffee).

This is an absolutely perfect Dark Chocolate pie.  Don't change a thing.  It calls for UNSWEETENED chocolate for a good reason.  It needs real whipped cream if you are going to add a topping.  My family and friends love it, and one of my nephews offered to go to the store for the ingredients if I would make it.  Grandma would be proud!  Thank you Debbie for sharing.
This is an update, I used almond milk instead of regular, and I used the egg whites and made a merengue.  Delicious.

I  followed the recipe exactly as it is written. This came out so delicious that my family finished the entire thing in one evening. I woke up this morning and realized I had just enough ingredients to make a second one so I'm going to do it again because it was so good! I've tried a few different recipes but none compare to this one. Best of all, it's so easy!

So I quickly decided on this recipe at the grocery store because I had most of the ingredients. While it was on the stove I was reading the reviews and my heart sank a little. People were saying it was too dark and not fluffy. I added a tbs of sugar (maybe two?) and a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips. Like I literally panicked and started throwing things in. I then super-mixed the egg yolks in a blender with some of the filling (it makes things fluffy), meanwhile burning the bottom because I wasn't mixing anymore. It actually gave it a little burnt marshmallow flavor that was pretty much the most awesome mistake I've ever made. This was the most amazing chocolate pie ever and also chocolate crust is a must. Thank you!!

I made this pie tonight for tomorrow's dessert.  I adjusted the recipe (using the recipe adjuster on the page) to serve 10 to make sure there was enough filling for my 10-inch pie crust.  I added a pinch of salt and about 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon (it just sounded good tonight).  Once the filling was hot, I tempered the egg yolks, then added them.  Cooked on high for another two minutes, but stirred after every minute once it was hot.  Very easy to make and thickened up beautifully.  It's delicious!  Can't wait until tomorrow night to eat it!  I will serve it with homemade whipped cream.  I cooked it in the microwave on high, stirring with a whisk every two minutes.

I haven't tried this yet but I'm going to tonight a little other thing that you could do to give it ore of a crunch and better tasting is you could crush up some Oreos and roll up some cookie dough and put it in the chocolate pudding!

I read reviews.  I tried 3.5 TBS cornstarch in lieu of flour, and also slightly more chocolate--and that was fine. One review suggested 2 TBS of almond extract, and that is tooooooo much.  I wonder if the reviewer meant 2 tsp--that would have been fine.  I also added the tsp of vanilla.

This pie was really easy to make after I got the chocolate chopped up! It had a great consistency reminicent of my Meemaw's chocolate pie! Would be good with meringue as well as the whipped topping suggested.

It really was delicious. The texture was a little dense... but it was really tasty.

Amazing! Decadent and rich. I subbed one cup of milk for heavy cream, and it was worth it! Easy and tastes like a million bucks.

I like using 6oz semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of flour use 1/3 cup cornstarch. I also like to cool pudding and then whip a small container of whipping cream up and fold into the pie. Much lighter pie and chocolate taste is just right.

Delicious!  I am a chocolate lover but my husband prefers a lighter chocolate taste.  This satisfied us both.  I made a graham cracker crust which worked well.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent pie! Not too sweet, and it was enough filling to sufficiently fill the pie crust. Will definitely use recipe again.

I did not like this at all.  I made this for Christmas, and luckily I sampled the chocolate filling before I served it.  It was not a good filling at all.  I ended up scooping half of it out and adding some melted semisweet chocolate with milk.  The original filling just wasn't sweet and decadent like a chocolate cream pie should be.  I would not recommend making this pie by following the recipe.  It turned out alright, but only because of all the improvisations I made.

I have made this a few times and it is great, I make a graham cracker crust and never seem to have unsweetened choc so I substitute that with bakers cocoa and butter.  Works great - use whole milk or the pie can be runny.

This is an awesome recipe. Yes, it has a dark flavor, but even my husband, who despises dark chocolate, loved this enough to get a second piece. It didn't fill the pie crust all the way, so I used an excess amount of whipped cream. Love it!!

I followed this receipt exactly and was making it for Thanksgiving. When I was done this looked like raisins and was thick like fudge. The next day we added a little more milk to loosen up this mess. There was nothing creamy about this pie. The milk helped alot but still was not what I was expecting.

Awesome!  I turned the heat a little higher than medium to speed up the melting process, used a pre-made graham cracker crust, and topped with cool whip after the chocolate had set.  Everyone loved it!

This was a nice pie that was easy to make. I served this to my guests with Dream Whip and grated chocolate on top and they enjoyed it. Because it is a basic recipe, it can be "jazzed up" with a banana sauce, or strawberry sauce drizzled over real whipped cream and with some real fruit. Thanks for the recipe--it is fast and easy in a pinch!

I made this recipe twice. The first one looked really nice, but I underbaked the pie shell so it was a little off. The filling though was tasty, set up pretty nice. The second one I overbaked the crust so once again it was a little off, but the filling was just as good. It was served with homemade whipped cream both times.

This pie was good, but extremely rich. I  recommend making this a day in advance as it tasted much better after being refrigerated for at least 12 hours. Also, instead of a traditional pie crust I'm going to try an Oreo cookie crust nest time. For a little extra zip, add banana slices to the top of the pie and homemade whipped cream!

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I served it at a recent family gathering and got nothing but praise.  Instead of topping it with whipped topping, I made stabilized whipped cream flavored with Kahlua.  That was a nice touch.

Better than my grandmothers, in a different way.  It's very runny, I'd cut the liquid a little or possibly add a thickener like flour or corn starch.

Yum!!!  I made this for a Thanksgiving feast and fortunately everyone was too full to eat most of it, so I took the nearly whole pie back home and have been enjoying it ever since.  I made this with the Basic Flakey Pie Crust and it's delicious.  Really easy to make, just keep stirring!!!  My arm was killing me from stirring but it was worth it.  Delicioso!

I made a 5 egg white merengue to go on top.  Hubby said the pie was too chocolatey for him.  I thought it was about perfect--even better after being refrigerated for awhile.  It cut well, not too runny at all.  Better than those pies made with cornstarch and flour.

My family did like this pie but it was more like a pudding than a creamy pie. I was not overly happy with it but if you like a pudding pie then you'll like this one. One alteration I did make was to change one cup of milk to one cup of half'n half. Will not make again... the search continues :(

I love this pie.  I cooked it last year for Thanksgiving at my in-law's house and I came back again looking for the recipe.  It is delicious, thick, creamy, just perfect.  Will definitely use this every year.

too chocolatey for me but my husband
liked it. I was stirring the mixture for
what seemed like forever. Will make again
only if requested by him.
