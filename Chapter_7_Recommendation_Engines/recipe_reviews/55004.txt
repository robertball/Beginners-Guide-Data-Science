This was somewhat of a pleasant surprise. I was looking for a way to help use up a bottle of dill weed, and ran across this. It sounded kind of odd, especially since I'm somewhat new to sauerkraut, but I made it exactly as written, and it turned out to be "different", but fairly tasty. I cooked the meat until 3:30, before cutting off a couple of ribs because I was really hungry, and I let the rest cook until almost the entire 4 hours. The meat was nicely cooked, and the flavors were interesting. The whole thing lasted me for four days, I think. Not the most awesome dish, but it was definitely worth trying.
