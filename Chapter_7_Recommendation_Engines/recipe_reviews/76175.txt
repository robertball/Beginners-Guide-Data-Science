I just made this and my house smells so good!  Here is what I did...I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white to give a darker color.  I also added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon b/c it just seemed like it needed more!  On top of that I used cinnamon apple sauce.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk b/c I usually use buttermilk when baking breads and it makes the bread even more dense & moist!  I did not add the cinnamon sugar to the bottom, instead during the last 15 min of baking I added it on top to give a nice sweet crunch.  The end result?...YUMMY!

This bread is fabulous - SO delicious and very moist. I do make a few changes. I'm a huge cinnamon fan so I use 1 tablespoon of it,  1 c brown sugar, 1 c white, and only the 3.4 oz package of vanilla pudding mix. I make 1 loaf, which usually takes 70 minutes in my oven and 1 dozen muffins which take 20-25 minutes. I've been asked for this recipe many times. Thanks :)

I made this recipe with only splenda and a light applesauce so that my girlfriend's father, who is a diabetic, could eat it.  Everyone loved it!  My girlfriend is my test subject for all of my new/try if for the first time recipes...and she said this one is definately a keeper!!!  I agree!!!

Excellent find! This is delicious! I may give these loaves out at the holidays instead of the usual banana bread. I used a 4 oz./individual size cinnamon applesauce from my son's lunch packs - so easy! I didn't measure the cinnamon sugar out to dust the pans, I just sprinkled the amount I liked. I topped one of the loaves with cinnamon sugar, the other without; we preferred the taste of the one with, but thought that the without looked prettier - go figure! My oven is rather hot, these were done to perfection in 55 minutes. Thank you TS for taking the time to post, this will go in my recipe box! Mmmmmmmm :-)

This is wonderful.  It seems simple enough, and it is, but it comes together very nicely.  Not too high in fat, either.  I have to recommend a streusel topping to really kick it up to ultimate: mix oatmeal, flour, sugar, butter and sprinkle on top.

this bread is great and so forgiving!  I only had a 3.1 oz. package of french vanilla instant pudding mix and used that and the batter was still nice and thick.  I used half brown/half white sugar for a darker looking loaf.  In lieu of the sugar mixture on the bottom, I borrowed the cinnamon sugar mixture on top from the cinnamon bread I recipe here on allrecipes.  It smells wonderful baking and came out so nicely from the pans that I sprayed with baking spray.  They rose very nicely and look like a picture.  These are off into care packages so I am not sure of the taste but the batter sure tasted great! and 5 stars for presentation!  this recipe is a keeper and I'll try the sugar bottom mix. next time.

Delicious!  Even better on day two.  The only changes I made in my futile attempts at cooking healthier was to cut the sugar amount to just over 1 1/2 cups, and a cup of that was Splenda.  I also used cinnamon applesauce since thats all I had.  I made 9  muffins and one medium sized loaf.  The muffins took about 22 minutes.  I had just purchased Country Crock Cinnamon spread and I had myself a little slice of heaven for breakfast!  Thanks so much... this is a keeper!

Very good and extremely easy for a novice baker!  I increased the applsauce to 3/4 c. and decreased the oil to 1/4 c. but other than that made it exactly as directed.  Has a nice "spicy" flavor and is great eaten warm with cream cheese.  Thanks!

FABULOUS!  So moist and delicious!  I used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar, a tablespoon of ground cinnamon and added some pumpkin pie spice to the bottom of the loaf pan.  I'm sure this would be good with cream cheese, but it was great served warm with butter.  We'll be having this for Christmas breakfast - thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night as a trial for Christmas gifts.  I thought it was excellent.  My dad can't stop eating it.  Instead of using the applesauce I used a full cup of oil because I didn't want any apple flavor.  It was really moist.  I took it out of the pans after ten minutes and the crust has a really nice crunch to it.  Wonderful.

Oh my goodness, WHY AREN'T THERE MORE REVIEWS OF THIS DELICIOUS BREAD?! I've been making this quick bread for the last 3 years and it's a hit everytime. Freezes perfectly too!  I generally use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, up the applesauce to 3/4 c and add more like a tablespoon of cinnamon. Sometimes I toss in some cloves, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, etc. if I feel inclined. I generally use the french vanilla pudding as well. I never do the dusting of cinnamon sugar, as my experience by doing that always results in a burnt-tasting crust. This quick bread is a great stand-alone bread, but it's over-the-top great with a drizzle of melted butter, cinnamon and brown sugar just after removing from the oven. As the bread cools, the drizzle will "glaze" the bread. Honestly, this is in my top 5 favorite all-time recipes from AR. Outstanding!

This is so amazing! I didnt change anthing except I did 1 cup of butter and no applesauce. My family said it was the best quick bread I'd ever made. ********I made this again tonight. It was still amazing. I was thinking though, you could play around a lot w/ this recipe. you could add mini chocolate chips to make chocolate chip cinnamon bread or you could add choped apples to make apple cinnamon bread or you could glaze the top w/ icing to make like a cinnamon roll type bread. I also think this would make really good muffins.

This stuff is wonderful!  It tastes like the Amish Friendship bread that I receive every once in a while, but without the work of the starter.  Mine doesn't come out pretty, the middle always sinks - but it tastes delicious.  I had to use a cup of oil as I didn't have any applesauce, and put in 3 tsps of cinnamon instead of 2, and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on the bottom of the pans and the top of the loaves.  Thanks for the recipe...well, my waistline doesn't thank you...we ate it all in one day its so good!

This was so moist.  I skipped the pudding (didn't have any) and had to use Pumpkin Pie Spice and cinnamon sugar in place of the cinnamon (I ran out) I made a dozen muffins and a full loaf of bread.  It was so goo, the house smelled wonderful!  I can't wait to make it acording to the directions.  THanks for sharing

Excellent recipe!  Even with the changes, it was delicious and has stayed moist for several days.  I halved the sugar with Splenda to lower the calories and used a small pkg. of pudding mix (all I had), and increased cinnamon to 1Tab. (I love cinnamon!)  Also, I ommitted the cinnamon sugar step after reading the reviews and added 1 C of plumped raisins (a very good addition).  Since it turned out so well, I will continue making it with my changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good and easy! The only think I changed was use 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 of white sugar like others had suggested. The top had a nice crunch to it! Goes great with a glass of milk.

Yes, this bread was moist, but it was not a very good tasting bread. In fact, I believe the vanilla pudding made this bread have a horrible aftertaste. I would not make this one again. Too bad because it sounded so good and tasty.

I made this with no changes to the recipe the first time.  After making it as is I decided I'd like it to have a little more flavor, so I changed a couple of things.  Instead of vanilla pudding I used banana cream and I used 1 TBSP cinnamon.  I also sprinkled my pans with cinnamon and sugar and before baking topped the loaves with more cinnamon and sugar. I used mini loaf pans and a mini muffin pan which didn't take long to bake.  I liked it much better with the banana cream pudding vs the vanilla, just my personal preference.    I rated this four stars because I found it better after changing some ingredients.  I will be making this again!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this again, after I was mixing everything up I realized I was out of milk, so I used a 12oz can of evaporated milk, it turned out just as good as the other times I have made it!

This was actually a very good recipe!! I was a little skeptical b/c of the pudding mix, but my whole family loved it!! The one thing I did do different, is instead of doing 1/2 c. oil, I just did 1 c. of unsweetened applesauce and added a little more cinnamon. I made one loaf by itself and added raisins to the other. I think next time I will add some fresh chopped green apple!!

This was tasty, and I love that you don't have to have fruit on hand (except the applesauce) to make it. I did also sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top, and that was the best part. I think this would be wonderful with nuts, or with other pudding flavors, etc.

Absolutely delicious! My kids: 12, 9, and 15 months (and husband), love this bread for breakfast. I am usually not a crust person, but I stake claim to the ends on this loaf (I butter the pan). I've it for my husband's office, the kid's teachers, friends, and family alike...the response is always the same....Mmmmmmm! I make it once a week. When I've been out of instant vanilla pudding, I have substituted more apple sauce and it still comes out good. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fantastic!  We ate one loaf and froze the other - just a great recipe.  Based on other suggestions, we substituted buttermilk for milk, added 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon, used 1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar and dusted the top with more cinnamon sugar with 15 minutes left.

I LOVED this recipe! The only thing i changed was I put half a cup white sugar and half a cup brown sugar. I made it in a train mold so it was adoreable and delicious.

OMG this is great!  I like cinnamon swirl bread, but this is much better, moist, with a soft texture better than like pumpkin bread.  I'm surprised it turned out, since it seemed jinxed from the start, but it seems very forgiving.  I made it cause it used up some stuff that was getting old, specifically some vanilla pudding mix.  So I grab the mix and see it's only a 1 oz package.  Huh?  I thought pudding mixes were all the same size box.  It finally dawned on me it's cause mine was sugar-free.  So will this ruin the texture?  Great, it's already got aspertame in it.  So I look online and discover aspertame is killed with high temperatures.  So I added about 3 oz. more sugar (about 2/3 cup) and hoped that would work.  (It probably would've been fine with the sugar-free.)  Then I discover I only have one egg!  (Sleeping on the job there.)  So I jump back online trying to figure out what to do about a missing egg, and used 2 T. cornstarch.  Is this ever getting finished?  I was originally going to use my mini loaf pans for half, but at the last minute used one 9x5 and one 8x4 (wondering if the 8x4 is not going to get done in the middle).  By this time I'm getting paranoid about the whole thing.  But it all turned out wonderful!  It was done in 55 minutes.  I gave one loaf to the neighbors - the wife said she wasn't much into cinnamon but DH would eat it.  Later report reveals that she ate some as well!  I ate 3/4 of my loaf in one evening!  (Great dinner LOL) Thanks. :-)

Delicious!  We love cinnamon & this bread makes for a perfect healthy, moist, cinnamony treat!  Didn't change a thing (ok, sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the loaf in addition to the bottom of the pan but that's it!) & we loved it.  Thank you for this recipe!  Will definitely be making again & again!  :)

This bread is easy and amazing!  I used a pumpkin spice pudding instead of vanilla....an amazing substitution!  I made two small loaves of bread and two dozen mini muffins...I could have made an additional dozen mini muffins but put too much of the mixture in the bread pans.  I wish I had, because my 3 year old kept running into the kitchen and grabbing a mini muffin per hand....a new favorite fall recipe!

What I really liked about this bread is the TEXTURE. The consistency was perfect. And of course it tasted great as well. I halved the recipe (was skeptical about pudding mix) and baked about 45 minutes, but it was slightly undercooked. Next time I will cook 50-55... I did double the cinnamon and added chopped fresh apple pieces tossed in brown sugar and cinnamon. Next time I will add raisin or pecans!

ABSOLUTE HIT!  I made this just as the recipe directs and it was (and continues to be) a HUGE SUCCESS!  Anyone who has it RAVES about it and wants the recipe!  I am thinking about trying chocolate pudding (or maybe pistachio pudding??, hmmmm) just to change it up, but it's SO GOOD as it is, I just don't want to mess with perfection...

This is the best quick bread I have ever made.  My husband and kids absolutely loved it!  The only changes I made were to increase the cinnamon to 1 Tablespoon and I added a little nutmeg.  My daughter asked if she could just eat the bread for dinner.

Very tasty!  I did half white/half brown sugar as recommended and brushed a little sugar/cinnamon mixture on top as it was coming out of the oven.  My house smells so good!  Not too sweet like a cake, a perfect healthy snack.

Awesome recipe. Not super cinnamony or overpowering, just really good. It is the first loaf recipe I have found in a  long time that leaves the top nice and crunchy and the inside moist. So many loaves get kind of soft and mushy once they are cooled, then put in a container. Not this one! Beware though, the recipe makes 2 loaves...I missed that at first and wondered why I had so much!

This is so good. I didn't have instant pudding mix but I did have cook & serve and it still worked out great. I took the advise from others to put     1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar. Made 1 loaf & 12 muffins. Great recipe. Thanks!

Very good recipe. I added a little more cinnamon and some nutmeg to the batter. I also used butterscotch instant pudding which gave it a deeper flavor. I was able to divide the recipe into 3 8x4 loaf pans (the aluminum ones from the store) and still baked it for 55 min. I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar inside the pan and on top of the loaves. I make 15 of them for Christmas. The bread stayed very moist for over a week.

I cut this recipe in half, used half a stick of butter, cut the sugar in half and used pumpkin pie spice. The batter was custard-like in consistancy. But the end result? Amazing. I bet the flavor of this bread would be even better the next day.

This bread is amazing!  I followed the recipe as written, adding only a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  The results were perfect.  I would not change a thing.  Everyone in my life expects cinnamon rolls from me for special occasions: housewarming, new babies, etc.  This will be my new go-to gift as it's much faster, simpler and just as satisfying.  My next effort will be to add apples just to see how it turns out.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I didn't have vanilla pudding so I got adventurous and used chocolate instead. I  used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and increased cinnamon to 1 T. It was FANTASTIC. The brown sugar, applesauce and cinnamon with the chocolate flavor was out of this world. Very moist and tasted even better the second day. I would definitely make this again. Next time I'll try the vanilla pudding.

This is a nice, moist snack cake.  I modified the recipe replacing one cup of flour with oat flour, half the oil with ground flaxseed, and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  The flavor and texture were nice, but I think I will keep tweaking to get more of a cinnamon punch.

This receipe was a real find! Everyone that has tasted it desires more. I admit that I used the tip of added the cinnamon and sugar to the top 15 min. before cooking time ended. I found the bottom burned with I put it on the bottom. Thank you TS for adding this, it is awesome!

Made one small loaf & 12 muffins.  YUMMY!  I didn't think they were "plain" tasting - just very simple.  Easy to make, and easier to eat :)  I sprinkled the muffins with cinnamon & turbinado sugar (the coarse grained brown sugar) - looks great & gives a nice texture on the tops.

This was so easy to make and tasted great - both loaves were gone in hours! The texture is very similar to banana and zucchini bread (the pudding is key for making it moist). I added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a little nutmeg, and sprinkled some additional cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

This is amazing! My family loves it and my son actually requests that I make it for him when he is home from college so that he can take some back with him to have for breakfast. He says it helps him get through the week(yes it stays well kept for that long). The only changes I make are using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce & I add about 1/3 bag of cinnamon chips (going to try butterscotch chips next) and a little extra cinnamon. This bread is super moist and even better the 2nd day. Also, no one usually likes the "ends" of breads, but the ends of this bread are fabulous. This will probably be the only "sweet" bread recipe that I will use from now on. It's so versatile and that's what makes it such a great recipe (aside from being delicious). I even forgot to add the baking powder once, still turned out just as good, that's how forgiving this recipe can be. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This ones a winner!   It is super moist and has great flavor.   When still warm, I took a bite without butter and it was fantastic, then I buttered a slice and I think the butter actually detracted from the flavor of this lovely bread.   I will definitely make again.

Easy to make and delicious.  Substituted pumpkin spice pudding for the vanilla for an extra special holiday kick.

I used splenda instead of sugar and 1/2 wheat flour & 1/2 white flour.  I was out of vanilla extract, so I used almond extract. I added 1t of cinnamon extra to the recipe along with 1c of raisens. Baked 1/2 hour at 350 deg and 1/2 hour at 325 deg and put cinnamon sugar on top of loafs at begining of cook time. They came out perfect at 55 mins!  Yum yum!

This bread is perfect! Sweet enough to be dessert, but still makes a great snack! Instead of making two loafs, I put it into muffin tins and cut down the bake time to 35 mins. It was perfection! I want to eat all of them myself!

My family liked the bread but we all agreed it didn't have enough cinnamon. I'm going to try this bread with more cinnamon. pumpkin pie spice and possibly cinnamon applesauce depending on how this second batch turns out. If left alone, it's rather bland.

This was really good! I jazzed it up by adding ginger, nutmeg and cloves to taste, and replacing the vanilla pudding with pumpkin spice pudding. The compliments won't stop rolling in!

I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  Perfect as is.  I've made this twice this week and everyone really enjoys it.  Moist and tasty sweet bread.  It did require a little longer to bake...1 hour 7-10 minutes.  Thank you for sharing.

This is sooooo delicious!!!  I started to make it and realized that I didn't have apple sauce, but i DID have apple butter, and i used it instead, and that's the only way I have ever tried it, with the apple butter you get the dark color and you dont need to add brown sugar MmmMmmmMMmm

Love this recipe - have to make it twice a week! It disappears quickly! Try some cream cheese glaze... also I don't sugar the pans... it makes the edges too gritty.

I liked this bread but I so badly wanted to love it.  I thought the flavor was pretty bland. It needs a little more spice...perhaps pumpkin pie spice and a touch more cinnamon and salt. I did like the texture of the bread. 3 stars.

Yummy! I didn't have vanilla pudding on hand, so I used butterscotch instead. Additional changes that worked out great too: 1c. white & 1c.brown sugar, decreased oil to 1/4c., increased applesauce to 3/4c., added 2t. pumpkin pie spice, and sprinkled the sugar cinammon on the pan and on top. When I checked the bread at 52 min, it was perfectly done. Check your bread early to decrease the chance of burning. Wouldn't want you to miss out on perfection :)!

I cannot find the words to describe how incredibly awesome this bread is.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Thank you AK Serena for a killer recipe.  And that sugar cinnamon that is added to the pan before you pour the batter makes this bread that much better.  What an awesome touch.

Extremely moist and flavorful! I used one box of instant vanilla and one box of instant butterscotch pudding mix. Perhaps next time, I'll add a bit of nutmeg or allspice, but the recipe is excellent as written.

it was yummy! My bf likes it who doesn't like cinnamon much. I baked 1 loaf, so i put half of all the ingredients in the recipe, except using brown sugar for half instead of all white sugar, as somebody suggested.

This was fantastic.  I made it exactly as written, but it took about an hour and 20 minutes to bake.  I will definitely be making this bread again!!!

I made this recipe with no alterations.  The flavor was nice, ingredients simple, preparation easy.  But it was a little sticky for my taste-HA, wait, it said it would be in the description *smacks self in forehead*.  Not sure I'd make this again, but it is a pretty good recipe-thanks for sharing!

This bread came out looking perfect, smelling delicious, and tasting, well, delightful. 
This a true winner. Didn't change a thing. Don't have to.

I wish I could give it five stars but because I made changes and tweaked it, I only gave it four.  First, I added 1 TBSP of cinnamon and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  It really helps to add the pumpkin pie spice (it seems to bring out the flavor of the cinnamon).  I also used  cinnamon apple sauce.  I didn't put cinnamon sugar on bottom, because I have done that with other recipes and had burnt crust.  Instead, I topped the loaves with a strudel topping.  The recipe made 2 large loaves and 1 mini loaf. I covered 1 large and the mini loaves with the topping.  On the last large loaf, I just sprinkled only down the center.  The bread turned out great.    
I love the taste and moistness.  The strudel topping really jazzes it up and makes it taste like bakery quality.  This will definitely be a fall staple in my recipe box.

Wow, I was surprised at the mild flavor of this bread. Moist, fluffy, looks & smells great. But even with the substitution of brown sugar, some nutmeg & additional cinammon added, it's rather...bland. Good, no doubt. Just not the WOW factor I was hoping for. I'll definitely make it again, maybe with chocolate pudding instead. Per recommendations, I used 1 cup buttermilk & 1/2 a cup whole milk; 1/4 oil, 3/4 c cinammon applesauce; 1/2 c white, 1/2 c brown sugar. Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, an additional tsp of cinammon. Baked for 50 minutes, came out lovely! Added the cinammon/sugar mixture on the top 10 min. before done.

This recipe is very good.  I made loaves for all my neighbors at Christmas and they loved it.  I also made it for a Christmas brunch we had and it was a huge hit.  I omitted the applesauce because I didn't have any...it was still very tasty.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I made it as written, and was taking both loaves to my parent's house for Thanksgiving. We actually ate one in the car on the way there...
One recommendation I would make is to make it a day ahead of time and wrap each loaf in plastic wrap individually over night. Straight out of the oven it did have a nice crispy outside, but the moisture all through from the overnight sit made the texture wonderful.

This bread was wonderful. It made 3 loafs & was gone the next day. I took one loaf to my Dad & wanted more by that afternoon. I did make a few changes. I used 1/4 c. oil & 1/4 c. cinn. applesauce plus the applesauce that it calls for & I added vinegar to the milk to make buttermilk. It turned out so moist. I also added nuts. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this bread!  I halved the recipe and made only one loaf.  I added more cinnamon and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top like suggested and it turned out perfectly.  I will definately make this again.

I only give it 4 b/c I would like it to be more cinnamony! So next time I will be sure to double the cinnamony. 
I was also concerned this would be like Amish Friendship bread with the pudding, but nope! :)

Have made this bread a Christmas tradition, thanks for the post! Original review: 12/24/05 I only had a small box of vanilla pudding mix intsead of the larger size (5 oz) and it still turned out amazing---2 beautiful golden loaves. I love the cinn./sugar coating on the bottom of the pans---made a sugary, spicey crust.

this was a wonderful recipe! i made one loaf and the rest into muffins and my family loved them! I would suggest adding a little more cinnamon in the batter for flavor and maybe some nutmeg. But it was very moist.

This is so yummy!!! I also used half white sugar and half brown and I sprinkled a little of the cinnamon sugar on the top as well. Everyone here loved it. I think I will make muffins out of them next time so I can eat them on the go.

My husband wanted something to bring to work with him and I had all these ingredients on hand so this is what I made and what a big hit it was with all the "boys"!!  I even had a request for the recipe.  
This is a really easy and really delicious bread.  I will undoubtedly make it again soon.

This really makes two nice loaves of bread, and couldn't be easier to make. I'm not sure if I like the cinnamon on the bottom of the pans-it tasted a little burnt-but the texture and flavor of the bread is right on.

I have made this recipe so many times, it's memorized. My entire family loves it. I've done with sweetened applesauce, unsweetened, cinnamon, added apple bits, tossed in extra cinnamon, and it still comes out a winner every time. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!! Thanks for sharing!

i goofed up by buying the cook & serve type pudding mix instead of the instant variety but decided to give this a try anyway. my breads turned out okay except the tops baked a little uneven & the corners turned up like the tips of a wooden shoe. regardless of my error, the overall flavor was still very good with the applesauce & cinnamon combination. i could also taste the lightness that the (wrong) vanilla pudding added. nice touch with the gooey cinnamon sugar on the bottom. i'd planned to give one of the breads away as a christmas gift & still did. thanks t.s.!  :~)

Great bread!  I have made it twice, but used one large pan instead of two.  I also accidently forgot to add the pudding the second time (my 2 year old son was helping), but the bread still turned out sweet and moist.

This was great. It tasted similar to the Cooking Light zucchini brad recipe, but better. I love cinnamon, and I became addicted to this bread. It's great with a nice warm cup of coffee.

I was searching for a recipe that would give me a bread similar to the Amish Friendship bread without having to fool with a starter and this fit the bill!  I experimented with other pudding flavors as well.  My favorite version is to use banana cream pudding mix and pecans (omit cinnamon).

We love this bread. It is one of our favorites. The teenagers beg for this to be made. This is perfect to throw together and you don't have to worry about having ripe bananas on hand! Why would you rate this lower just because it doesn't compare to a cinnamon roll? Duh, they are two totally different things. This is a bread, not a pastry.

I will make it again. I liked the fact that it made two loaves, one for me to taste and one as a gift. I also took it across country and lugged it around for two weeks and it was still very moist and tasty. No instructions for the cinnamon sugar on the upside, but I mixed at least 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to  two tablespoons or more of sugar to place on the loaves.

Yummy but VERY sweet. Next time I'm going to reduce the sugar from 2 cups to 1.5 cups and see what happens.

I made the bread with a few changes suggested by another
reviewer:  used buttermilk instead of reg milk, added a snack
cup of cinnamon applesauce & increased the cinnamon &
reduced the oil to a 1/4 cup.  Very tasty!  Will make again.

I've made these several times, & it always comes out great. I had 2 requests for the recipe today when I took it for snacks at my daughter's club. I use fat free pudding mix (2 small boxes or 1 large). I have used 1 c of whole wheat flour (with 2 c. white flour) without any noticeable change. I add 1T of cinnamon, sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on top instead of inside. I did 1 c. white sugar & 1 c. brown sugar. Muffins are great too 325 X 22-25 min.

The recipe as is, I give a 4...I tweaked it and took away some things....I took away the pudding mixture suggestion and added  one half teaspoon more cinnamon, one-half teaspoon more vanilla extract and lower the milk to 1 cup from 1 and a half cup, because the pudding mixture was left out.
My ohio family members tasted it and loved it with the additions...I made it with my granddaughter at her request by recipe and she said she didn't like it, not enough cinnamon. So my first decision to change it to a little more flavor as listed above was a good one...she loved my changes, not the original recipe! Everybody who tasted my version without the pudding and added cinnamon and vanilla "loved it".  I loved it more my way, but  still a great recipe!

Did the recipe as written-really great!  I can see using the Cinnamon on top as some have done, or just dusting  the whole pan after greasing as well, not just on the bottom. Great bread using lots of things I almost always have on hand. You could tweak it with maybe nutmeg in the batter as well for sure. You could really do lots with different sugar toppings/glaze, or even serve it with a custard sauce maybe? Thanks so much!

This recipe taste super close to the Amish Friendship Bread I make for my neighbors each Christmas!  My husband even preferred it over the friendship bread.  I  made no changes and really loved not having to make the starter batter!

Made this for friends at our monthly ladies crafty group. Followed the recipe, but used half white sugar and half brown sugar as recommended.  It was delicious and very moist.

Great fall recipe.  Cinnamon flavor is not too intense.  Moist, light-colored bread, sticky on the bottom.  Baked in 5 mini loaf pans at 325 for 40 minutes.  Used skim milk, half wheat flour, splenda, sugar-free pudding mix, and all applesauce (no oil) to lower the calories.

this was pretty tasty.. i cut the recipe in half and it made 12 decent sized muffins.. i didn't do the cinnamon sugar thing on the bottom but maybe i should have.. i took another reviewer's suggestion of putting it as a topping but that didn't really work.. it still tastes good though! i added another 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and did the half white half brown sugar.. used almond milk for regular milk.. i resisted the urge to use pumpkin pie spice but now wish i would have.. i had about 3 T of chocolate chips left in my pantry and threw them in there.. hardly noticable but i wanted to use them up.. this was better than okay hence the 4 star rating.. ty for the recipe

This bread is a total winner. I followed the recipe as is.  At the end I threw in a handful of cinnamon chips that I had just bought. It was heavenly!  Thanks for the great recipe.

YUM!  My family really likes this bread.  The only thing they complained about it was how dense it was.  I followed what other people said and used 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar.  For one bread pan I coated the bottom with cinnamon and sugar and the other was plain, but for both loaves I add streusel (1/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 cup soft butter). This amount coated both loaves.  I think I will make it again for breakfast for a sleepover.

I tried this recipe yesterday.  I made as is, except with slightly more cinnamon.  It's an amazing, moist bread.  A little plain to be sure, but it has flavor.  When I try this again (and I will many times) I'm going to try it with chocolate chips, raisins, or dried cranberries.  I think they will all be great.  This is an amazingly versatile recipe and I cant wait to experiment with it! Thanks so much for sharing!

I got a craving one night for something sweet, did not feel like going to the store, and did not want to make anything too complicated. I found this recipe and WOW! It was better than I thought it was gonna be. And EASY, with ingredients you usually keep on hand!! Tastes exactly like the Amish friendship bread, except, you don't have to wait 7 days to make it. :)

Sooo good!! A must try recipe! I'm surprised it has less than 200 ratings because it reaaly is a fantastic recipe. I have made this many, many times. It freezes nicely, if it makes it that long! Try it for a back to school treat for the kids. Thank you AK Serena for such a yummy recipe!

Wow! This recipe is a keeper! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used buttermilk instead of milk, cinnamon applesauce, and replaced one cup of the white sugar with brown sugar. Hubby and I ate four loaves in four days! Moist and dense and delicious.

I have had this recipe for several years now.  It is a quick version of the amish friendship bread that you pass around the starters for.  You get the same great result with half the mess.  Try different flavors of pudding.  Chocolate is wonderful or add 1 c. pumpkin.  YYYUUUMMMMMMYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!

Sooo good - and easy to make! I also added a bit more cinnamon and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top ten minutes before coming out of the oven. Also, I realized in the middle of mixing that I didn't have any applesauce. I thought I would be creative and substituted a packet of prepared "Quaker Apple Cinnamon instant oatmeal." It was awesome! My daughter loved it and wants it packed in her lunch every day. I will be making this again for sure.

This bread reminds me of the Amish Friendship Bread without the 10 day process.  It is very moist, and the cinnamon/sugar on the outside adds the perfect crunchiness.  My whole family loved it.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 which yielded me 3 mini loaves.  Just made last night, and we're down to 1/2 loaf left.

So yummy. I think I underbaked mine a little, and it was super crumbly. Still tasted amazing. I'm going to make it again, most certainly, and I'll make sure that I bake it properly. I served it with corn on the cob and maple meatballs. Thanks!

I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top of the loafs as well as the bottom. My guests were very impressed with the resulting crust.

It was okay, but the pudding mix gave it a somewhat gummy texture and a slightly chemical taste.I have used several other, better cinnamon bread recipes. (I made it exactly according to instructions, except for using half brown/half white sugar, as many commenters suggested.)

This is easy to make and delicious!  I only had sugar free pudding and that did not seem to cause a problem.  This is a recipe that will be added to my favorite recipes.  I can picture gaining a few pounds from this one!

I'm not sure what happened here, but I suspect that an 8x4 pan may be the problem, mine wound up overcooked (taken out at 65 min) except that the middle was still so undercooked that the center of the top actually collapsed. I also wasn't very impressed with the flavor. Not inedible, but I won't be making this again.

My daughter and everyone who taste this bread just LOVES it.  We have altered the recipe so that our gluten free friends can eat it too. (Rice flour, rice or soy milk, 3/4 cup of apple sauce instead of 1/2  and 1/2 cup of brown sugar in stead of a whole cup are also alternatives we've baked.)  Good luck and Enjoy!

i followed the recipe exactly. Super easy. Super delicious!!! very moist and sticky. Yum! I made 1 large loaf and 5 miniloaves, and baked for 70 min these came out perfect.

My boyfriend loved them but suggested the next time i put a glaze on them like cinnamon rolls.

This is really good. Instead of 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce, I used 1 cup of cinnamon applesauce(that is all I had.) I also sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar on the top instead of the bottom. Would be good with some cream cheese. YUM! Thanks for recipe!

I FINALLY just signed on as a member, so now I can tell you that this was the BEST cinnamon bread!!  I made several loaves over the holiday season as gifts for neighbors and family.  Everytime I made a loaf for them, I kept one for the family because they couldn't keep their hands off it.  I'll absolutely be making every holiday season from now on - this has started a new tradition!!

I did add a little more cinnamon than asked for and I also made a struesel topping that was suggested from other reviews.  The addition was lovely and it made the bread just a little more festive-looking.

moist, a decent basic bread...somewhat bland in flavor, i think additions would help this become a good bread, streusel topping, some nutmeg, raisins/chopped apple...something...it needs more :)

This is the MOST delicious bread!!  I have made it several times.  It is so very moist and also freezes well.  A WONDERFUL recipe for giving as gifts (if you don't eat all of it before).  EXCELLENT!!!!!!

Awesome recipe! I baked this for my boyfriend, who loves cinnamon, and it was an instant hit. Because I was using ceylon cinnamon and not cassia, I added an extra teaspoon, but otherwise the recipe was perfect. Thanks so much!

It's hard to rate this one, I don't have anything bad to say about it but The best thing I have to say about it is it's OK. I don't see it as something I would make again. To be fair, I was looking for that Wow...OMG recipe and to me this one is just OK

Pretty good!  This was my first attempt at making homemade bread--very easy directions to follow!  My house smelled WONDERFUL by the time it was through cooking.  I took it on a family camping trip--gone almost as soon as I brought it out.  Will definetly be making this one again--but maybe with a smigin' more cinnamon next time.

I love this recipe, it is so simple.  We have made it as bread and as muffins, both are moist and delicious.  I skip the cinnamon sugar on the bottom of the pan and use way more cinnamon, more like 2 tablespoons rather than teaspoons.

This was the second cinnamon bread recipe I tried - It is the best!  Very moist and the cinnamon is evenly spread out - another reciped left clumps of cinnamon/sugar on the bottom. This is very moist - and goes very fast!

It was not unusual for my husband to give this recipe a compliment the first time he tried it.  It was unusual when he complimented the bread a second time when he had another slice the next day.  My family REALLY likes this bread.  It is a good thing that the recipe makes two loave so that I have an extra one on hand.

Awesome recipe!  Turned out great and a big hit with most.  I might reduce the cinnamon by maybe a half teaspoon because it was a little too spicy for some.

Awesome - I did exactly what the recipe stated and it was delicious. I made four mini loaves. They were the best looking loaves I have ever made. They cam right out of the pan and looked beautiful and tasted even better. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

What a fabulous cake! It had an intriguing flavor, was moist and delicious. Next time I would add a bit more cinnamon to the batter, and some more cinnamon sugar to the bottom - that was our favorite part. I'll be making this a lot.

My husband has been asking me to make cinnamon bread ever since a friend of ours gave us some.  Her bread was made from starter though and I didn't have the recipe for it.  This isn't quite the same but it did the trick!  My husband and I love it and I will definitely continue to make it!

I made this with chocolate pudding as it was all I had on hand, I also used half light brown sugar instead of all white sugar. It was excellent, the girls just loved it!

This recipe is great. Next time I am going to try adding either pumpkin or some apple to it.

This was nice, but it didn't wow anyone.  I made it as muffins instead of bread as we had company leaving early and the muffins obviously cook in less than an hour.  The taste was nice, the flavor was strong without being overbearing, but they were plain.  For what they were, I give them five stars as there was nothing wrong with them.  But, I think I'd try them again with something mixed in (pecans or dried apple bits) and maybe with a streusel topping.

This bread was good ... a nice alternative to banana bread.  It was moist.  Nothing super special though - certainly nowhere near as good as home made cinnamon rolls!
