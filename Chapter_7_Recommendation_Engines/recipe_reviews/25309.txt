So yummy and very easy to make! Instead of frying, I baked them in the oven. Preheat the oven at 400 degrees F. Spray the baking sheet and then the falafels with vegetable oil cooking spray. BAke 10 minutes, flip and spray again, then another 10 minutes. Then broil each side for 2 minutes. So good and much healthier! Thanks!

I like the fact that this uses canned chickpeas.. as it's easy to prepare.  However, both times I've made it, the falafels have fallen apart in the oil. I recommend doing a test falafel... and if it falls apart, just add another egg. I would use very little bread crumbs, if any.

Another scary problem is that the baking powder (which may be a typo.. as every other falafel recipe I know uses baking soda), cause the oil to bubble up/foam... one batch it foamed over creating a fire hazard on my stove.

As for the sauce, I didn't use the dill, but I added two cloves of finely chopped garlic. The second time I left out the mayo and didn't miss it at all.

All in all, this is a good base... but be wary of the falling apart and foaming issues.

Wonderful recipe!

I didn't have any coriander or enough parsley, but it still turned out great.

I suggest, as others have, that you make the cucumber sauce first so that the flavors can mix well.  The sauce tasted great, but, a tad too sweet for me.  So, I added in some more salt to even it out.  Plan on using the sauce for salads in the future!

I mashed the chickpeas without a blender, as the recipe says, and the texture was nice.  This is really laborious, so if you're short on time, just use a blender on a gentle setting.

I also made the following preparation changes:

1) After forming the falafel balls, I covered them in bread crumbs.  This creates a nice texture.  Form the patties after this.

2) To make less fatty, baked the falafel patties in an oven instead of deep frying.  I covered an oven pan with aluminum foil (easy cleanup!) then very lightly greased it with olive oil.  Bake the patties at 425F  for 20 minutes then turn over and baked for another 8-10 minutes.  They brown well and turn out great.

Enjoy!

I had to make a few alterations... this recipe would best be used as a "guide" for making falafel.  

First - DOUBLE the recipe!  The mixture will hold for a few days in the refrigerator and also freezes well - especially important for busy individuals/families.

Mashing the chickpeas by hand is very important for texture/consistency.  I used 2 (15 oz) cans of chickpeas and it took less than 5 minutes to mash by hand - so it's not as laborious as others have stated.  

My best recommendation:  Use a generous handful each of fresh parsley and cilantro for great flavor.  The seasoning measurements are perfect.  DO NOT use egg or breadcrumbs, use flour instead.  You will need approximate 4-8 tablespoons - start with 4 T and add additional flour as needed until you are able to form a small ball and it doesn't stick to your hands.  I recommend test frying one ball (or disk); if it falls apart you must add more flour.  It is also highly recommended to refrigerate the mixture for a few hours to allow the flavors to mingle.  I typically make the mixture the night before or the morning of - and fry in the evening for a quick fix meal.  These can be baked but are must tastier fried!  Fry in 2-3 inches of oil at 375 degrees.  Traditionally falafel is served with a tahina sauce - but I much prefer using homemade Tzatziki instead (made with strained yogurt, strained shredded cucumber, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and dill).  MMMM delicious!

What a great recipe! I completely disagree that it's laborious to crush chickpeas - I used canned organic ones and it was the easiest part. I would say the whole thing is a bit labor-intensive so do it on a slow night, but TOTALLY worth it.  I can't cook at all and I still managed to make this perfectly.  I followed the first reviewer's great suggestions to roll the balls in bread crumbs and to bake (at 425 degrees, 20 minutes then flip then another 8 minutes) instead of fry.  I also replaced the baking powder with baking soda.  Finally, I skipped the dill weed and used a sprinkle of coriander on the cucumber sauce and it turned out delicious.

This was good with a few changes. I left out the egg, used 3 cloves of garlic, fresh cilantro and add hot sauce. To cut back on the fat and time i also baked my falafels.  For all thoses that found that it made it dry heres what i do: I soak some stale bread in some milk, squeeze out the excess and then kneed into the mix. then let it sit for an hour or until i get home from work. With damp hands shape into balls and put on a sheet brushed with olives oil. I bake at 425 for 15 minutes on one side and 10 on the other, the outside was crispy and the inside was moist. Tasty, healthy, easy and quick to make!!!

Both my husband & I like falafels, and thought this was a good recipe. I made a few changes, most note worthy would be warming the beans in the microwave for a minute 1st so they mash quicker and only using 2/3 cup of bread crumbs. I will make this again.

Best falafel ever!!! Very tasty... I just made another batch. This time I omitted the  salt since the canned chickpeas already have enough salt in them. The prepared mixture keeps well in the frigde for a few days, so you don't have to fry it all at once. To cut back on the mess and the fat, I used the George Foreman grill instead of the deep fryer. Just use some of the spray oil, and the patties still come out moist and golden brown. Thanks for sharing!!

Great Falafel recipe! To cut down on the fat, I used Egg Beaters, only 2 TSP olive oil, browned the patties in a skillet with Olive Oil Flavored PAM and then baked them at 400 for 30 minutes. For the sauce, I used fat free sour cream and eliminated the mayo. Thank you for the recipe!!

Everyone loved this recipe, even those who had never heard of falafel.  Best I've ever had- very fresh tasting.  Next time I will add more garlic and make more than 8 balls.  The smaller ones were better and more cooked all the way through.

After reading such rave reviews, I found myself very disappointed with this recipe.  The mixture should sit for a while prior to cooking, 30 min. to several hours, to develop more flavor. Also, the patties totally fell apart when we tried to cook them. This is such a healthy recipe before it gets deep fried. Falafel is just as good cooked in a skillet with a light amount of oil. The main problem I had was with the cucumber sauce. REAL Tzatziki is so much more delicious and worth the effort. Start with plain greek yogurt. Or, strain plain lowfat yogurt in a sieve lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter overnight in the fridge. Next, chop up a seeded but not peeled 1/2 English (seedless) cucumber and toss with 1 t. salt. Drain in a colander over a bowl 1 hr. at room temp. or 8 hours in fridge. Then squeeze out liquid and pat dry and add to strained yogurt. Mash 2 chopped garlic cloves to a paste with 1/2 t. salt. Add to yogurt. Toss in 1 T. chopped fresh mint or dill, 1 T EVOO, 1/2 t. red wine vinegar, and some ground black pepper. Stir, cover, refrigerate 2-4 hours. Enjoy chilled or at room temp.

We enjoyed this recipe and loved the sauce. I did have a difficult time with the patties breaking up in the oil but with reading other reviewers suggestions I will try again.

Incredibly easy for such a nice meal.  I first blended the parsley, garlic, and onion in the food processor, then I added the garbanzo beans right in and processed until they were the right consistency.  Certainly saved a lot of mashing.  I made about 20 small patties and baked them as other reviewers have suggested.  The kitchen smelled amazing!  Left out the cucumber sauce and instead served with tomato, cucumber, lettuce, and hummus in warm pitas for an easy -- if not messy -- high protein vegetarian meal.

These were fantastic!  I was nervous making them for our guests because they regularly make falafal, but they said their boxed mix didn't even compare to this recipe.  I made a double batch and froze half the dough--we'll see in a few weeks how it holds up.  I will definately put this in my rotation of dinners.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe, but next time I may try baking as others have suggested to cut down on the calories.  7/31 UPDATE: I used the rest of the falafel dough about a month after I froze it and it tasted as good as the first time. From now on I will always make a double batch and freeze half the dough to be used later.

Very nice falafel recipe - I have my own tzatziki recipe. I followed all the falafel ingredients and steps as written, then baked (15 min @ 425, flipped for another 10, then flipped back and broiled until nicely brown) instead of fried. I leveled the mixture into my 16 scoop and it made 10 patties. Really great flavor. Frying would make them even better.  It's going into the 'do again' list.

I haven't eaten a lot of falafels in my life, so I don't really have anything to compare these to, but I thought they were delicious.  Very easy to make and they were still good the next day!

I used baking soda instead of baking powder, and it came out perfectly.  Many people are suggesting baking instead of frying here, but I tried both and FRYING produced the best flavor hands down.  I say leave the baking for other things, heat up the olive oil, and allow yourself to enjoy these falafel as they're meant to be enjoyed!  (On that same note, someone suggested rolling the falafel in bread crumbs before baking, but that just made it taste dry and bready, so I'm going to suggest not doing that.)  The seasoning combo in this recipe is perfect, the final product rivals the delicious falafel at my favorite restaurant!  Other recipes say to use only dry chickpeas, as canned will be too wet and not hold together, but the breadcrumbs seemed to do the trick (although 1 cup really wasn't enough, I probably had to add about 3)!  Thank you, Sean!

Loved it! As others did, I baked the falafels instead of frying them. Worked great. (425 for 20 min. on one side, then flipped and baked 10 min. more.) I also made smaller falafels (maybe 15 patties instead of 8). Omitted mayo from tzatziki sauce, and it tasted good. It was a simple sauce, but that's all the dish needed. Will definitely make this again!

The first few times I made this recipe I followed it exactly and found that I needed to use more oil then necessary in order to have the falafel hold together in the pan. I started to experiment after that and now instead of mashing the chickpeas, I put the can of them in the food processor with the onion, garlic and parsley, a little bit of the liquid from the can and some lemon juice and blend until fairly smooth. I then combine the egg and spices, add to the mix with bread crumbs then I roll the falafel into balls. I preheat my deep fryer on the highest setting and then deep fry the balls until golden brown. The end result, they end up less oily and the inside of the ball is a light, fluffy texture - my fiance loved the change and I always make them this way now!

REALLY good, but I have nothing to compare them to since I'd never had falafel before =)  Had them on a whole wheat pita, with Chili-Lime Chicken from this site.  Looking forward to having it for leftovers.  Kind of reminded me of a veggie burger, but more moist.  Will definitely go in the dinner rotation.  (Only fried them in a spritz of olive oil.)

I made these as written, except that I added more cumin because I could not find corriander in my area.  I do not own a food processor, so I finely chopped the veggies.  I mashed the beans by hand but left some chunkiness.  I was very happy with the texture.  They made nice patties and held together.  I thought the flavor was a little lacking (bland).  The falafel I've had in restaurants was much more dramatic in it's flavoring.  The sauce, however, was excellent.  I do not think I'll make these again, although I may use the sauce a lot.

This was a great recipe, but being a cook, I needed to tweek it a bit.  For the cucumber sauce I used nonfat yogurt, 2 cloves fresh garlic, non fat sour cream, and lowfat mayo, I increased the dill weed and used splenda as a sweetner.  It gave the sauce a very distinctive flavor.  The measurments are to taste, so don't be bound by "exact meausurements." Actually, the sauce tasted like the sauce served with gyros.

LESS FATTENING (far more nutritious) and ANTI CANDIDA DIET acceptable, I did NOT fry, but baked in oven @ 400 (approx 30 mins). They actually taste much better! I substituted 3/4 C quinoa flour and 1/4 buckwheat flour for breadcrumbs. For the dill sauce, I substituted plain Kefir for the yogurt, I did not use mayo and added 1 T. chia seeds to thicken. 

If you are on an anti-candida diet, you can forget the pita, cut a wide slice of avocado, and layer on lettuce, crumbled falafel, diced tomatoes, and dill sauce. 

Store the falafels in a storage bag. So, thanks Sean. It was a great recipe for me to be able to eat on my Candida diet.

Great recipe!  Needed about half the bread crumbs and added extra garlic.  Also, I used a double batch of the sauce to go with the falafel since it was so tasty.  Like others, I baked in the oven at 400 degrees for twenty minutes (ten on each side).  Making again next week!

Very tasty and easy.  One note - if deep frying, be sure to form the dough into balls, not patties.  Patties tend to fall apart in the oil, while balls hold their shape perfectly.

Only changes: I used baking soda instead of powder, a suggested by other reviewers, used far less bread crumbs, and added chili paste to the falafel "batter" to increase the spice.

This recipe is absolutely AWESOME. One of my all-time favorites from allrecipes. I have made this at least half a dozen times since discovering it a few months ago, and it is always a huge hit. The tzatziki sauce is SO YUMMY. I serve these in warm pita bread with chopped lettuce, tomato, chili paste, pickled beets and some of the leftover parsley. Even the big meat eaters in the family love it when we have "falafel night." This recipe is a keeper- I know I will be making it for years to come!

I did not add the mayo to the cucumber sauce which I made first to meld the flavors.  I did not fry my falafels instead I baked them at 425 for about 18 minutes, then flipped them for another 5 to finish them off.  I tossed some salad greens (and purples) with a little lemon juice, salt and pepper and placed it on the plate.  Topped the salad with about a teaspoon of feta cheese and placed the falafels on top and topped those with the cucumber sauce.  Served with some nice juicy tomato slices... Mmmmmm... Falafel Heaven!!! :)

Instead of deep frying, we baked the falafel in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes per side.  Very tasty!

An excellent falafel recipe!! My son is allergic to eggs, so I omitted them and added a handful of flour instead. Friends of mine who've made this with the egg also needed to add flour to make them stick together better.

They turned out perfectly! I chilled the mixture for about 30 minutes before frying it so it could "solidify"...it was fantastic and easy!

This was very good!  I have never had falafel before and my husband was a bit concerned when I said I was going to make it! He was wondering where the meat was! But WOW! We both liked this alot!  I served them in pitas with the sauce(which was yummy!) and tomatoes! I made 12 total falafel. Because I dont like to fry things, I greased a pan with EVOO and baked at 450 for 20 min total(flipping after 10min)! They were perfect! As my husband said...this recipe is a keeper!

This was good, but has a lot of moisture in it and therefore needs a lot more than 1 cup of bread crumbs to keep it together.  I don't think the tablespoon of olive oil is necessary nor possibly the egg.  My first batch just fell apart in the oil.  I had to add a lot more bread crumbs to keep the shape.  Other than that, the flavor was nice.  I doubled the garlic because we like things garlicky around here.  Also the sauce was very good.

This is really good! My whole family loved the falafel. Wasn't super font of the tsaziki though. However, I used fat free greek yogurt and I think I might go for 2% next time.

Yummy, I baked them instead of frying according to one reviewers suggestion.  400 degrees, 10 minutes, flip, another 10 minutes.  I will make these again.

This was probably the best falafel I've ever had. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Here's what I did that may have made a difference (or not): I used the cheapest canned chickpeas. When I blended the onion, garlic & parsley, I threw in the egg so that it had enough liquid to blend. Finally, I (hang head) used extra-virgin olive oil to fry them (only about 1/4" though). Delicious. No, simply incredible. Didn't make the sauce, but I'd leave out the mayo & strain the yogurt for 15 min or so in a coffee filter - huge improvement I find.

I really enjoyed making these and the sauce was out of this world! My son and I went to a Greek resturant and had falfel--I KNEW I could make them better and I did with the help of this recipe. Even though the recipes says not to use the blender, I used the food processor and it came out very good. Mine did fall apart but I do not think that was due to the food processor. I think mine were too moist and I needed one more egg. I did not use canned garbanzos. I made them from scratch. Delicious!

Thanks Sean - this was delicious- i had my husband mash up the chickpeas then added the rest of the ingredients except the bread crumbs, then just added and mixed till the texture was right. They held together fine.  First batch browned quick! Watch your oil temp. Love the sauce too.

I like to pulse partially cooked chickpeas in my food processor so they aren't too mushy for the mixture.  I also use a piece of day old bread rather than bread crumbs.  I agree with Muslim Mom that baking powder must be a typo, because I have always used baking soda.  If your mixture is not holding together, add a little water and then flatten the balls into patties.  I didn't use this sauce because I make my own tahini dressing.  Typically, we put the diced cucumbers, diced super fresh tomatoes and some of the dressing in the pita before adding the falafel, then add more dressing, if desired.  Heating the pita in the microwave helps give the pita bread a nice chewy, distinctive flavor.  I hate a dry pita.  ETA: I also never deep fry these.  Usually quickly pan fry and finish in the oven or bake and broil in the oven.  Both ways are good!

/gasp! SALTY! I followed Sean's recipe exactly except I used 1/2 the breadcrumbs, & baked at 375 deg. for 35-40 min. flipping once. These would've been mouth-watering-ly-perfect had the recipe not called for 1 tsp. salt. (or that much breadcrumb?) Maybe my family & I have a weaker tolerance for salt, but wow, the flavors in these falafel were to die for ... but alas, they were drowned in a salty sea.

Wow!  Definitely restaurant quality!  This was really great...I was having a falafel craving and I decided to make these.  I took the canned garbanzos and took two sandwich bags to put on my hands and smushed the beans between my fingers.  I thought that this technique made the texture interesting.  Followed the seasoning amounts to a T and used about 2 T more olive oil than called for.  Used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs to get the right moldable consistency.  The other 1/4 cup I spread on a plate to hold the patties and "kebab" shapes I made.  Then I lightly rolled or flipped so the outside had a crumb coating as well.  This made for a great uniform crust after frying.  Next time I will definitely try making the cucumber sauce and try to broil the patties (so I can enjoy them more often!).  Thanks so much for sharing!

Really good recipe.  I used the food processor to chop the onion, parsley, and garlic and added the chickpeas and pulsed until they were chopped.  The texture was perfect.  I also had to omit the cumin and coriander..didn't have those as I don't care for them and don't keep them stocked.  I used a spice blend that had both included in it, however.  I also upped the cayenne a bit.  I used 2 slices of whole-wheat bread, processed until finely ground.  I omitted the mayo from the sauce and served the falafel and sauce with fresh tomatoes on greek flatbread.  Very yummy...I'll be making again soon and regularly!

I baked these to be healthier (450 F for 15 min., flipped them, another 15 min.) and had to omit the coriander as I did not have any in the house..and this is STILL the best falafel I have ever had! I don't have a food processor so I did everything by hand. I didn't use the recipe for the cucumber sauce so I can't comment on that.

Love this!!! I have never made the sauce, but I make the falafel all the time without changing a thing. I actually do broil them about 4-5 minutes on each side instead of frying though. I serve them on whole wheat buns with cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, alfalfa sprouts and a little mayo. My husbands favorite dinner!

O.K. I waited tell I make this several times because I had some problems with the Falafel falling apart like a lot of you did.  I found that if you put it in the frig. and get it cold it cooks wonderfully.  I made the recipe just as written but did have to add more bread crumbs but the recipes says add more or less.  
Thanks Sean for the post.  Love this recipe.

This recipe is fantastic.  I baked half and fried half - I prefer them baked because for me its easier to cook them evenly, but both ways work. My dough seemed a little dry so I added an extra egg and used only half the salt. Made the following changes to the sauce: Suibstituted soy yogurt,used 2 and a half tblspns mayonaise, 2 tspns lemon juice and a little over 2 tablespoons **fresh** chopped dill (all to taste really.  You'll never miss the dairy. I dipped the hot patties straight in the sauce...but for sandwhiches tomorrow I will put them on toasted whole wheat sour dough bread and stuff them with the sauce, parsely, mint tomatoe. YUM!!

Delicious.  Use a food processor instead of a blender for the garlic, parsley and onions.  I baked the falafel about 9-10  minutes on each side.  I also added a little lemon juice to the yogurt sauce to make it thinner.  I used lowfat yogurt and mayo to make it a little healthier.  I used the falafels in a salad.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe!  To make the beans easier to mash, before I drain the can, I boil the beans for about three minutes.  I then drain out the liquid and mash the beans.  It makes them softer and easire to mash.  I made falafel hummus wraps with whole wheat wraps, tomatoes and a yogurt dill sauce.  Very filling.  Yum!

USE FLOUR INSTEAD OF bread crumbs!!  Like others, when I used bread crumbs, it fell apart in the oil - using about 1/4 cup of flour in the place of the bread crumbs gives it a great solution, firms it up some, and definitely keeps it stuck together.  If you don't know the temperature of the oil, just start at mid/low (4 out of 10) and go up from there.  This recipe makes about 12 balls slightly smaller than ping pong balls.  I also used fresh cilantro in place of the ground coriander, and used dried parsley instead of fresh (just had that on hand) - turned out perfect. I have served on pita like a gyro, but also have served with a yogurt/avocado/cilantro dressing as an appetizer.  They are good now matter how you serve them!  Great recipe!

We were rushing at night so we used the processor to mix up everything. It turned out very light and smooth.   We added baking powder and plain flour to make it to be able to stand with the bread crumbs. At the end, it turned out so crispy and smooth inside which is well done :) superb!

Delicious!! Only made a couple changes; did not have bread crumbs so used multi-grain cracker crumbs instead, green onions in place of regular onion, added some chive to cucumber sauce and used thin multi-grain sandwich buns instead of pita because that is what we had. Will definitely be making again!

I didn't make the cucumber sauce, as I used a store bought version I love, but the falafel is excellent and not nearly as difficult to make as I'd thought. It made for a great and much more interesting Ash Wednesday dinner.

I liked it a lot! It was tasty but a bit dry, so next time I'll skip the bread crumbs..! Also, I didn't try the sauce, but instead I served them with same fresh tomato chunky sauce and plain greek yogurt! My husband loved them! So, it's 4.5/5 for us!

My first falafel, it was soo good. I added my Cajun seasoning mix to it (pepper/paprika/oregano/sage/garlic powder/cayenne) and it was most delicious! Will make again and again!

Absolutely great! We didn't make the cucumber sauce, because we don't like it as a rule, so the 5 stars are for the burgers themselves.

This was pretty bad.   I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it, which would account for the dryness, but not the taste and texture, which were both pretty awful.  Maybe it was the breadcrumbs I used.

Oh my lord...after years of dry, hard, boxed mix falafel, this was a revelation!  And easy to make, too.  I'm a twenty-something who likes to try new foods in the kitchen, and this is definitely something I will make again.  And, you can do it gluten-free if you use crushed Chex cereal for the bread crumbs!

I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I used gluten free breadcrumbs.  It was a complete disaster.  I wish I could upload a picture to show what a disaster it was.  They completely fell apart in the oil and ended up just being falafel crumbles.  I was so sad!

Rating for the falafel only - I used a different tzatziki sauce.  It was moist and flavorful, and did not fall apart at all.  I had to add nearly double the bread crumbs to make it "not sticky", however, which was weird for me... but perhaps it's an issue of humidity where I live, I don't know.  I also baked at 400degrees for 20 minutes, then flipped and baked another 15 minutes.  They were wonderful.

The flavour of these falafel was spot on, but the texture was a bit off and they fell apart a bit during cooking.  I think about half the breadcrumbs would be more correct and I will do this in future.

The flavors are great, but the consistency of the batter is hard to get right.  
I make the falafels much smaller than this recipe recommends because they seem to hold their shape better while frying than the bigger falafels do.

This basic recipe was good but was a little bland for falafel. For my next batch, I added more cumin and added a pinch of garlic powder that gave it more of an authentic taste (at least it tasted more like how falafel should taste.)  I'll definitely make this again with my adjustments.

crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.  
i followed the directions for the falafels exactly, except, i rolled them in bread crumbs before cooking them, this gave them that extra outer crunch.  also, i baked them instead of frying.  i did not use any extra oil, simply used parchment paper in the oven for 20 - 25 mins at 400 (half way through, i flipped them over).  you'll love these.  enjoy!

I made the falafel without the cucumber sauce and it came out great! My mom is prone to heartburn and sensitive to certain spices, so I left out the cumin, coriander and cayenne pepper, but it was still flavorful without them. I substituted matzo meal for bread crumbs and only needed 1/2 cup. As for the chickpeas, I microwaved them for 1 minute and then mashed with my fingers. This is the first falafel recipe I have tried that has actually managed to hold itself together! My brother complained that they were patties rather than balls, but that's okay because they tasted great and I suspect that leaving them in ball form would have left the inside uncooked and the outside burned. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these following recipe to a "T" except used half onion because the only onions I had were huge and they were yummy!  Why people are substituting baking powder for the baking soda I don't know, if you know anything about baking these two leavening agents are NOT interchangeable. Also why anyone would need 3 cups of breadcrumbs to get these to stick together is beyond me, unless they are not draining the chickpeas.  I could barely get 1 cup mixed in without being too dry.  The sauce was great too.  Served in pita bread with lettuce and tomato.  Will definitely make again.

Yum!  If you enjoy falafel try these at home...I added an additional egg white to the mixture because the first couple starting falling apart in the oil; the egg white helped bind the patties together.

This is a FANTASTIC falafel recipe.  It's quite easy to make, yet comes out looking and tasting amazing.  The falafel isn't too dense, and it has great flavor and texture.  I added some garlic, fresh dill, and fresh mint to the yogurt sauce (and I used fat-free strained Greek yogurt), and the whole thing added up to a delicious meal.  I had some leftover mix, which I covered with Press 'n Seal and stored in the fridge overnight.  The next day I made another batch, and it was even better than the day before!  Thanks for sharing.

I have made these several times. When I make them now I add 1-2 tsp of curry powder to it. Role them into balls a little bit bigger than ping pong balls and bake. They're great the next day served in a pita with veggies and left over cucumber sauce.

The falafel was great, and I've used the recipe several times to great success. The tzatziki wasn't as good, though. It lacks an acid bite, and doesn't call for garlic. I prefer Ina Garten's recipe instead, using thick Greek yogourt.

This was an awesome recipe! I followed the falafel recipe to a T, except my only change was to add half the amount of bread crumbs. I made them into smaller patties (about 1 and a half tablespoons with a cookie scooper!) and baked them. I ended up with about 24 patties and baked them at 425 for 15 minutes on each side. I made my own tzatziki sauce and this was so good in a pita with red onion, lettuce, tomato and the tzatziki. I will use this recipe over and over again, thank you!

Delicious!  All of my past experiences with falafel were that it was really dry.  Fresh out of the fryer (although not very healthy) was terrifically yummy.  We had ours in pitas with the sauce, tomatoes and fresh parsley.  (The sauce really ties it together.)  Originally mine fell apart during frying, but separating them in half (making 16 instead of 8) kept most of them together.

I ignore the directions and mix this way:  Throw 2/3 can chickpeas into the blender with the onion, garlic, two tablespoons peanut butter, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil.  Puree.  In a large bowl, mash the remaining third chickpeas into a rough mash with a potato masher/squisher.  Add the seasonings, baking powder, egg and stir to combine.  Dump in the puree'd stuff and then mix well.  Add bread crumbs until mix is on the stiff side (think caulk/spackle) and not sticky to the touch.  I use a #40 cookie scoop to portion and then pat into little flat patties (instead of the traditional ball shape) and then fry in oil.  I use about 1/4C olive oil for the whole batch and they come out crispy, not soggy with oil.

These are absolutely amazing!  This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. I've used Sean's recipe for years, and just tried making them vegan.  I used ener-g egg replacer with the falafel instead of eggs, and I used a combination of plain silk yogurt and vegan sour cream for the cucumber sauce.  They were definitely a crowd pleaser.  Thanks again Sean!

Delicious! The only things I changed was adding some green onion (I only had half of a regular onion on hand), I didn't have any corriander so I used a Mrs. Dash spice blend that had corriander in it, and I baked them at 350 for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them occasionally until golden brown on both sides. They came out great! I didn't make the sauce because I don't like cucumber and didn't have yougurt. Will make again. UPDATE: I just had four of the patties (roughly 2-3 in in diameter) for lunch with the Whole Wheat Wrap (recipe found on this site) and I'm STUFFED and satisfied. They are delicious and healthy and filling. What more can you ask for?

This was a really great recipe! I was looking for a good falafel recipe after having some while I was at a festival, and they were exceedingly dry, leaving me with a craving for a good falafel. I used dry parsley, simply because that's what I had, and halved the amount of cumin because I was worried about too strong of a cumin flavour, but next time I would definitely put the full amount in. I would like to try baking them as well, to reduce the fat.

Great! Very tasty. Made it healthier though by flattening it out in a pan (like a pizza)and putting it in the oven. Brushed olive oil on the top and baked for around 20 mins then turned over for another 10-15 mins. Healthy, tasty- what else could you ask for?! 
Also, didn't like the idea of mayo in the dressing so i switched it for a little vineger and added dried mint.

Six Stars! I love this recipe! Warning though! It's so good, that it might just ruin your favorite restaurant Falafel! I love adding a little extra cumin for an added kick. I also do mix the chick peas in my food processor, I prefer the smoother texture that it creates. All in all an A+++ recipe!

My husband makes the best falafel ever. He makes a large batch and then divide it into quort size freezer ziplocks. He lays them out flat untill they freeze and then moves them to the door. this way we always have the mix ready to be fried.also we enjoy it in pita with tahini and Israeli dalad which is made with cucambers,tomatoes lettuce, pickles or for that matter any vegetable that you have on hand.The key is to cut it very very small and to add olive oil, salt pepper and lemon juice.

I will use this recipe again.  To cut back on the fat content, I baked mine.  After making the patties, I placed them on a foil-lined baking sheet (sprayed with PAM) and put them in a 425 oven for 20 minutes then turned them over for another 8-10 minutes.  They browned nicely and held together just fine.  Also, I used a food processor to chop the chickpeas, removed them, and then combined the onion, parsley, garlic, and egg in the food processor together, before adding the other ingredients to the mixture in a bowl.  The texture was just right for me.

INCREDIBLE!!  At first I wasn't sure how it was going to come out after tasting the mix before cooking it, but it came out delicous!  I browned it on both sides with PAM and then baked it in the oven at 400 for 25 min (like an earlier review suggested)  
Then I put two patties into a pita pocket, smeared some of the cucumber sauce into the pita with the patties and sprinked some diced tomatoes into it also, it was so delicious!  The sauce really makes it awesome.
Thanks so much for the great recipe - this is one I will be making again and again :)

This is a very good recipe and tasted fresher than what I've had in many Greek restaurants.  I used a little more cayenne, as I like spice.  The hardest part is getting the oil temperature right...to low and it soaks up too much oil, too hot and they don't cook all the way through.  Definitely one I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly up until the frying part. 
I formed the balls, pressed them into a patty, put them on a baking sheet fitted with a cookie rack (so air can go underneath). You do not need to flip them and they did not fall apart. They are drier when you don't fry but it is an option for people who don't want to eat too much fried food.

Delish!  I have been making baked falafel for years.  Last night I tried Sean's recipe - the difference being the addition of breadcrumbs and frying.  What a complete difference - they cooked in about 90 seconds, and were so light and crispy.  Absolutely delightful.  They absorbed little of the hot oil.  I won't make them this way all the time, but I sure will some of the times.

Really good! Used very little olive oil to pan fry. Oh, and I used a food processor instead of mashing it. I really like my falafels to have a very smooth texture. (And I also like them slightly burnt:)

I followed the advice in the reviews and used baking soda instead of baking powder. I fried half of them and baked the other. They both tasted terrible. Like baking soda and bread crumbs. The baked ones all stayed together, where less than half of the fried ones did.

loved it! I agree with other reviewers: one cup of bread crumbs wasn't enough, used whole wheat flour. I used fresh greens: parsley, cilantro, and dill. Baked in the oven 400F for 20 min then turned them over and cooked for 15 min. Broiled 2 min each side. loved it! Also loved the sauce!

I also amended the recipe.  Used panko bread crumbs and flour to bind the dough. Used 4 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of parsley. This recipe is really flexible.  I also baked at 425 for 20 minutes, then turned over and baked an additional 8 minutes. Then did a quick pan fry to crisp the outside. I would definitely make again.

I just made this tonight! It was absolutely awesome! I added diced jalapeno to the falafel mix and instead of frying also baked them. 10 mins. on each side at 400 degrees.  They turned out beautifully.  Wrapped them in extra large pita bread with hummus, cucumbers, lettuce, and sliced red bell pepper strips. Drizzled on the dill sauce, couldn't be happier! I will be making this again :)

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe but I followed the instructions just to end up with a mixture that as soon as it was put in the pan to fry, it fell apart. Besides, it was so oily. I am going to give it another try but I will broil it in the oven and will see.

I skipped the sauce and just used plain yogurt instead (I'm not a huge fan of cucumber) while my partner used store bought tzatziki. The falafel themselves turned out great with a few minor adjustments. I skipped the parsley because I did not have any, did not add baking powder, eyeballed the amount of spices I added since I didn't have my measuring spoons and just finely chopped the onion and garlic. I also used only half an onion and fresh lemon juice. I made the falafel patties quite small (about 1.5 - 2 in across and .5 in thick) and made sure the oil was very hot before frying them. I used much less oil than the recipe called for, about .5 in, and even less the second time (just enough to cover the pan really). They didn't fall apart, were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I ate them in pita bread and, the next day for lunch, on their own just topped with yogurt. The mix keeps well in the fridge, so when I made it for lunch I just fried up a new batch. Next time I will add some fresh chilli pepper to the mix since I like things on the spicy side. Overall this recipe is tasty as is, difficult to go wrong with and a great base to experiment with.

First time making this recipe, and it's a winner! I had no trouble with the little patties falling apart (made as written), and I did not have to refrigerate them. I used panko crumbs, though. Maybe that made a difference? I have just a few other recommendations: cutting the salt in the falafel mixture by at least half, and using fresh dill and a couple of cloves of minced garlic in the tzatziki. Lastly, I suggest doubling the recipe and freezing the second batch between pieces of waxed paper for a very quick fix the next time you crave falafel!

This was delicious.  I did change some things just because I am watching my calories.  My changes included: omitted salt, reduced breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup, and baked the patties at 375-400 degrees for 10 minutes on each side.  I also made smaller patties, this recipe yielded 16 smaller patties.  For the sauce I used Hellman's Light Mayo.  I made everything the night before, then kept in fridge until ready to bake next day.  The sauce was beautiful, and probably benefited from making a day ahead.  Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will make a double batch and freeze half.

Very tasting with a few minor changes,I left the covered in the frige for a few hours, then lightly rolled them in bread crumbs. I did not deep fry but instead baked with a spritzer of peanut oil on the each patty in the oven at 400`. They were fantastic!

Had to join allrecipes to post this comment.

Simply put, SIMPLE & DELICIOUS! made it for the second time - the family devoured it. I used a food processor. First processed the onion, garlic and parsley then added the remaining ingredients and pulsed, came out just fine, otherwise followed the recipe as written had no problem with the falafel falling apart or anything else.

This was a big hit for a no meat, "Friday in Lent" meal.  

I recommend making the cucumber sauce first, and put it in the fridge to let the flavors mingle.

We substituted the baking powder with baking soda, per the comments regarding foaming issues.  Also added 2 small cloves of garlic to the cucumber sauce, and made one batch with and one without the dill.  The one with the dill was our favorite.  I actually mashed the cucumber sauce mixture with a potato masher to squish up the cucumbers more and let the flavors get released.

Had no coriander, but it still turned out great!  We used 1 tablespoon dried parsley instead of fresh (no fresh on hand) as well.

We baked the falafel instead of fried, per some suggestions of reviewers - 400 degrees for 10 minutes on a nonstick sprayed pan, flipped and another 10 minutes.

This recipe is great.  We did do some variations, but that is not to take away from the recipe - loved the texture and flavor of the falafel and the sauce.  I think this is a very versatile recipe, so don't be afraid to make it your own!

The cucumber sauce was excellent.  The falafel tasted fabulous, however, no matter what I found on Google and tried, they did not stay together once they hit the hot oil.

What a great recipe!  I accidentally doubled the coriander, but it didn't harm the taste!  
1) I did not end up pureeing the onion, just left it finely diced.
2) I used two cups chickpeas from those that I had cooked in the slow cooker and frozen.
3) I mashed the chickpeas with a potato smasher in a flat-bottomed pot.
4) I used 2/3 of the breadcrumbs in the mix, then left the rest in the measuring cup to roll the balls.
5) Because my pitas were so small, I made eighteen golf ball sized falafels.
6) Following another review, I sprayed them with oil and baked at 425F for 20 minutes, then flipped them, sprayed, and baked another 8 minutes.
6) We stuffed them in the pitas, spooned a thin layer of tahini over them, then topped with CAYCE's Tzatziki I (upping the garlic 50%), lettuce, and tomato.

Made as directed except for the following changes: Used baking soda instead of baking powder, and put the patties in the oven for 15 mins at 425, flipping halfway through. Next time I will add some tahini and be more generous with the spices. It was just a touch on the bland side for me. I used another recipe for the cucumber sauce.

Very yummy! I think next time I'll chop the onions much smaller because although they held their shape some fell out. Hehe! I'm thinking these would be delish baked too. Less oil.

Good!  Tastes just like the expensive store bought imported mix I had been buying.  My picky kids ate it all up.  I omitted the flour/breadcrumbs and it was just fine.

These were fantastic!  Flavors were spot on.  Next time, I may pan fry quickly to brown then try baking them in a 400 degree oven to save some of the grease, but they were delicious as is.

I loved that these are pan fried in a small amount of oil.  These were so yummy!  My kids tend to be picky eaters but they enjoyed these dipped in sweet and sour sauce, rather than the traditional cucumber sauce.

This is AMAZING!  We loved it.  I seriously have an addiction. I did everything pretty much the same as the recipe. I doubled it and that made like 9 large pancake-sized patties.  I used one very large onion and about 3/4 cup parsley for the doubled recipe, and did not double the cumin.  Everything else I did the same. I think the coriander is quite important to the overall flavor.  I also used half breadcrumbs half flour, since I did not have enough bread.  I fried in vegetable and olive oil mixed, and only had about 1/2 inch oil and flipped them half way through.  It worked fine!

I put salt in the yogurt sauce, but would not next time.  

You have to try these!!!

This recipe is excellent! I doubled the recipe and made this as a Superbowl appetizer. Since it was doubled I had to cook them in batches. I filled the pan with 1/2 inch of olive oil fried until both sides were brown then put each batch in a 300 degree oven while the next batch was cooking. This helped to firm up the falafel and give it a nice crunch and burn off some of the oil from frying. I definately would fry/bake again as you were guaranteed every batch was hot!

divide into 16 patties instead of 8 and be sure and use a strainer ladle to scoop out finished falafels!

Very good recipe for falafel.  I baked mine in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.  I'll probably look for another cucumber sauce recipe - I wasn't crazy about the mayonnaise, and I'd rather have the cucumber shredded, so the sauce isn't so chunky next time.

I made this as is (just using panko instead of breadcrumbs) and it was amazing!  I love the texture of the smash not blended chick peas!
The sauce was also very good - I used an English cuke and didn't peel it, I did blend it though instead of chopping and it was delicous!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The falafel part of this was amazing. I doubled the recipe and added an extra egg (so 3 with the doubling); I added a bit more than 2 cups of bread crumbs with this addition.  I substituted baking soda for the baking powder after looking at other reviews.  I also cooked them in the oven at 425 for 20 min and then flipped them over and cooked them for 5 (as approx suggested by others).  My husband thought that maybe they were cooked a bit too long because one was a tiny bit crispy on the bottom, but I thought they were perfect.  And they were really really moist inside.  I made my own tzatziki sauce instead of the one below (greek yogurt, some sour cream, cucumber, dried dill, pepper, minced garlic, and feta).  I also cut up tomatoes and ate them with it.  Will definitely make again!

Really 2.5--I know I'm in the minority, but I didn't really care for this.  I even made it twice because I had all the ingredients--once pan fried, the other time in the oven.  Both times they came out nice, looked good, too, but the flavor was extremely bland.  I found I needed to overload them with the cucumber sauce to make it edible.  One time I had the falafel in a pita with cucumber and onion, the other by themselves with just the sauce.  For people wanting to try it, dusting your hands with flour before forming the falafel helps a lot, with maybe a sprinkle of flour on the falafel before it goes in the pan.  Mine didn't fall apart either time, but I won't be making these again.

I actually think this recipe is better than the Falafel I have had at the restaurants.  I made them both ways - flatten and in balls.  I prefered them flattened.  Also I made the "Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce" from this site instead of the one listed.  Very good.  Served with french fries!  :)

an excellant recipe! I love the coriander and cumin in them! but YOU MUST cut the bread crumbs down to 1/2 cup or less, or they completely crumble in the oil! My blender has some trouble with just processing the onion, garlic and parsley so I also added in the oil, spices and some of the smashed peas to form a nice, blended thick paste and then mixed it in with the rest of the peas and other ingredients. I didnt have yogurt, so I mixed a little mayo with cream cheese, ranch dressing and cream until yogurt consistency, omitted the cucs and added in a spice packet and let sit for 30 minutes. It was awesome paired with homemade pita bread, tomatoes, lettuce and radishes...perfect for a hot summer day's dinner!

I've made falfel a couple times in the past and it has not turned out good. I was weary of trying another recipe but i'm glad i did, for once it did not turn out dry and bland. These had a nice crispy outside and moist inside. I left out breadcrumbs entirely because I did not have any, but i rolled them in corn meal. I had no issues with them falling apart while cooking, they stayed perfectly intact. I'm not sure breadcrumbs would of really added anything to it anyway. Will definately make this again. I did not make the sauce though, I just added cucumber to greek yogurt.

This was pretty good.  I've never had falafel before, so have nothing to compare it to.  I think next time I will take the advice of many other reviewers and bake it instead.  I ended up draining the oil and browning a crumbly mess in the pan.  My daughter loved the falafel but not the sauce.  My husband liked the sauce and made some comment along the lines of "its a good thing I'm not a vegetarian," but he did have seconds!

thought these had a lot of flavor but next time I would make more smaller balls instead of 8 huge patties. I prefer the texture better when they are smaller. Did the cucumber sauce, it was aight but I prefer hummus.

Family loved these!  I followed others advice and baked them, also made into smaller patties, otherwise followed recipe.  I also used another recipe for tzatziki sauce as I like it with garlic.  I will certainly be making these again!

Word of warning: do not fry these in a deep fat fryer unless you can control the temperature of the oil. No matter how thin I made the patties, the outside cooked too quickly leaving the inside uncooked OR the whole thing was fried to annihilation if I tried to leave the patty in long enough to cook the inside.

This recipe also makes up fantastic with gluten free breadcrumbs!  I put everything in the food processor.  First, I pulsed the chickpeas a few times and then added the rest per the recipe. Dumped everything in the bowl with the egg and spices.  Added about 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, baked at 400 for 10 minutes on each side and they were perfect!

The falafel turn out really good but i wasn't to crazy about the cucumber sauce. From this recipe i actually got 11 falafel patties but maybe it was because the falafel can i used was 19 oz. Next time i will look for a different recipe for the sauce.

Excellent.  I sprayed the flattened nuggets with cooking spray and baked them as another reviewer suggested.  They were a bit crumbly this way, but flavor was great & they were guilt-free.  Mixing them up was a bit more time consuming than using a box mix though.

Delish!  I did as others suggested and baked them.  Husband is a huge falafel fan and claimed they were better than the ones at the authentic local joints.  Some said the recipe was time-consuming but honestly it doesn't take any more time than the average meatloaf!  :)

Didn't have time to make the sauce and I was bummed about it but the falafels were YUMMYY!  Will probably use slightly less cumin next time and I did coat them with bread crumbs.  Mashing the chick peas was really easy for me as I warmed them in a small non-stick sauce pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not all that fond of the recipe mainly because it fell apart when I fried it. I'm currently baking the rest now. It does taste wonderful, but I would definitely add some flour to the mix to help bind it. Also, you apparently use dried chickpeas that you soak overnight and that will help keep it together. Canned is bad it seems. Also, make sure your oil is at just before the smoking point before you put the falafel in. Tasty recipe really.

These were pretty good.  I baked them as other suggested, but next time I would make sure to use foil on the baking sheet since they got a little stuck.  The only problem I had was that the baking powder gave it a weird after taste, but maybe I didn't add it correctly. 

I also used a food processor to mash the chickpeas because my masher doesn't work very well.

Have made this recipe multiple times. Have mashed the chickpeas by hand and in my food processor and either way is great, but one is much faster! I have to add an extra egg to keep the falafels together and I add additional salt to the sauce as it is too sweet for my tastes.

next time, I think i'd double the spices, as it's a little bland for falafel. The cucumber sauce is great.

I didn't think the falafel would stay together when I fried it so I stuck it in the fridge overnight and it worked out quite well.

I've been looking for a great falafel recipe since I can't find the veggie patch falafels anymore. I tried the boxed version and it was not good at all. This recipe however was a hit even with my family who are not vegetarian oriented at all. I used a different tzatziki sauce also found on this site instead of the cucumber sauce in this recipe. As for the falafels; I fried half and baked half and I myself prefered the baked version, my husband of course liked the fried patties better.

This was really, really good !!  When you fry these, get the oil HOT...just this side of smoking.  If your oil isn't hot enough to get a quick crust on the patties, they WILL fall apart.  And make sure you get a good dark, golden crust on them.  It matters.

fantastic, just add the bread crumbs a bit at a time until you can make patties/balls out of the batter and it holds. I doubled the recipe, used one onion instead of two and it turned out great. My husband begrudgingly tried them and came back for THIRDS!

This falafel recipe was yummy and easy to make! The original recipe does not include chilling the patty mixture, but I found it much easier to work with after it sat in the fridge for about half an hour. Also, I used an ice cream scoop to make the falafel round instead of flat patties. In the end there were 12 falfel balls about the size of a golf ball. Unfortunately I didn't have the ingredients for the cucumber sauce on hand, so I ate the falafel with red pepper hummus instead. I'll be trying the cucumber sauce next time though!

Great summer recipe! I barely used any oil and browned them on the range before finishing them off in the oven. After refrigerating the leftovers, I thought for sure they'd be a soggy disaster but they were still fabulous.

These tasted really good but they wouldn't stay together in the oil.   I tried frying a couple and they kept falling apart.   I then switched to cooking them on a slightly oiled griddle (later finishing them in the oven) and they came out nicely.     My son is a vegetarian and I'm always trying to find protein rich dishes for him that he will love.  He loved these and even his meat eating siblings were fighting over the last couple.  I gave it 4 stars because the frying didn't work.

These didn't turn out too bad. I ended up using a red onion since that is all I had on hand; and it made the mix very watery. I also left out the fresh parsley. It took 3 cups of bread crumbs to get the mix to stick together (and I think that's because of the red onion) and even after then the first one mostly fell apart. I added spoons of cornmeal until it got to a consistency that fried nicely. I really liked the sauce; I didn't have any cucumber to add, and left the mayo out; added about 1/4tsp of garlic powder. It was a nice crisp flavor. The Falafel itself definitely had a traditional taste. I will try making these again for sure!

This is by far the best falafel I have ever had and the best part is I made it myself! I would not change a thing. It is absolutely perfect as it is written. If you are on the fence about trying falafel just do it. This recipe will not disappoint. I have served it plain or in a pita with the cucumber sauce and a little shredded lettuce. Yummy!

I literally just finished up dinner and thought this recipe was simple and delicious. The recipe also leaves space for tweeking. I added about 2 cups of baby spinach to the blender to add a little more nutrition. Also, I used a half cup of Italian Bread crumbs and half cup Panko Bread Crumbs (which added a lot of flavor). I served the Falafel on a whole wheat bun(the 100 calorie, super thin ones) and dressed it with roasted red pepper hummus, lettuce, and light catalina dressing. It was delicious and I'm really trying to resist getting a second helping.

This is the best falafel recipe that I have ever used.  I have made it a few times now and every time I make it, I make a larger quantity because it is never enough!  Today I tripled the recipe so we'll see.  I cook my own beans and grind the coriander which I think adds to the flavor and I also bake it for health reasons but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly (and I never do that)!  You have to try this recipe!  Thanks so much for this.  It's my husbands favorite. Even my 2 year old eats them right out of the oven. :)

A great falafel recipe.  The only change we made was to bake them at 425 - 15 min. one side 10 min. on the other.  It will now be a standard in our house.

These were delicious.  I had never had falafels before.  Made the recipe as written & it had a little too much cumin in it for our liking; but that's an easy fix.  I will definately be making these again.

This was the first time I ever made falafel.  And I started with dry chickpeas.  I was a little concerned during the mashing process that I was not smooth enough.  But with each step it got better, it turned out great with lumps still in it!  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. A few things that helped me--before frying the falafel, coat each side in bread crumbs. Also, if you are having trouble getting them to stay together, try using a microplane (or a cheese grater with tiny little holes!) to grate the onion. This adds moistness while still keeping the flavor, and seemed to hold together fine in the pan! Great recipe.

Very good falafel. Mine cooked much faster than the other reviewers who baked theirs (as I did). Next time I would use fresh dill in the cucumber sauce, and add a little garlic to it as well. Thanks!

Great recipe! We serve this with spanakopita. We only fry on special occasions and try to stick to oven baking the rest of the time, although they come out a little dry in the oven. Tend to make more sauce too as this goes fast.

My first time ever having falafel - i was pleasantly surprised.  Next time I'll bake them because they really absorbed the oil i fried them in.  The cucumber sauce was awesome... except i added a teaspoon of salt following the wrong part of the recipe...  wish i'd had more yogurt on hand to just make more sauce...  served them in a pita pocket with sliced tomatoes and a side of couscous.

Loved this recipe!! I did the prep work a little different. Put all the wet ingredients in a food processor first and mixed those together, adding one additional egg. Added the parsley and onion next and pulsed a few times. Added the garbanzo beans next and pulsed. Then by hand, added the bread crumbs to combine. Using a medium scoop, made about 12 patties and baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes on one side and then 5 on the next.  Made the sauce with Greek yoghurt and a little garlic (no mayo) and served in pita breads with onion, tomato and spicy olive salad. So delish!! Tossed the leftover patties in quick salad the next day and they still were great!! Didn't even realize we were eating meatless!!

AMAZING!!! I brought this to school (I'm a grad student) the next day for people to try the left overs... I have passed the recipe around to several people now!!!  My only addition would be to use an extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to thicken it up.  Even though I added enough for it to stick together and not be stick, it was still not enough to hold them together...  STILL AMAZING!

Making this, I really thought it was going to be way too much onion, but I wanted to give the recipe a chance and I'm glad I did.  I might bump the seasoning up a notch for the next go-round, but this was delish!  My mother thought I was crazy serving falafel, which she had never had and only heard of.  She asked for seconds and suggested I serve it more often.  The sauce really made it great.  The recipe is right that too much bread crumb can make the finished product too dry.  Be careful.

Not sure if I had enough liquid in the crumbs/mixture and the batter seemed to come apart slightly while I was frying the patties... but regardless of that - these were so tasty! Thanks for shaaring!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I usually cook the chickpeas first in the slow cooker in bulk, freezing leftovers later for hummous.  Sometimes fried foods that call for assembly can fall apart in your hand even before they make it to the pan, but not this one.  These falafel stick together well, making frying a snap.  We never have leftover cucumber sauce and I even add a bit more cucumber to make it last a little extra with this.   We pile it into pitas with chopped tomatoes, a little onion, sliced pickles, the cucumber sauce and a little hot sauce.

I'm sorry, but I did not like this recipe at all. I did not have coriander, and slipped in a bit of cilantro, but that only improved the dish to my tastes. Perhaps I am not a Falafel person. Thanks for the recipe.

Not only is this recipe absolutely simple, it's delicious too!  Even though the recipe doesn't recommend adding the beans to the food processor, it's okay if you do.  I've tried both ways and find that processing the beans with the onion/parsley/garlic mixture is not only a lot faster, but gives the same results.  You may have to add a bit more breadcrumbs in the end, though.  In the sauce, I add a touch of lemon juice, vinegar and cayenne pepper to give it some zing.  I serve the falafels with pita, sliced cucumber, tomato wedges and sauce.  Absolutely adored by everyone, and I make, on average, once a week.

Amazing!  I used dried parsley and baked instead of fried - followed a reviewer's suggestion, and baked ~20 minutes at 400 degrees, flipping once.    I will make this again and again....

5 stars for taste. Best falafel recipe ever! I'd give 3 stars for prep time though. Blender, lots of bowls, etc. Would be nice to be able to make ahead and reheat, but these taste best fresh. Thanks for the recipe.

I haven't had falafel before, but always wanted to try it. These were great! I doubled the recipe and it took a long time to prepare, but they were worth it! I forgot the coriander and added a pinch of curry. I also squeezed out as much liquid as I could from the onion/parsley mixture. It think that is the key to the patties not falling apart. I used a piece of wax paper to form a log then sliced (like you would for slice and bake cookies). I then laid out the patties, folded the wax paper over, and pressed them lightly with the bottom of a glass.  I dipped them in oil and baked them @ 350 for 10 minutes each side, then broiled for a couple mins each side.  Turned out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sauce is awesome as well. To that I added juice of half a lemon and a few liberal shakes of garlic powder and used sour cream instead of mayo. I squeezed as much liquid out of the cucumbers as I could and the sauce wasn't thin at all. I let it sit for an hour or so. Served in pitas with lettuce and tomatoes.  Will be making these again for sure!

I first tasted falafel in a Greek restaurant and really enjoyed it. When I came across this recipe I figured it wouldn't taste as good as the resaurant  but I tried it.......I was wrong.....not only was it easy to make it tasted great.  Being a vegetarian I now have another dish to add to my menu.  For the meat eaters I prepared souvlaki as well. I made a Greek salad and along with the falafel (and souvlaki) stuffed it all into a pita.  It was very, very good!  I've made it tonight again so I'd better get in there before it's all eaten.

This tasted GREAT.. I noticed that there were no tomatoes in the recipe, but they were in the picture, and I do remember tomatoes being in a falafel, i have to pop that in next time.

But other than that, it was perfect. Great recipe!

I love falafel and this is a great recipe.  My husband, who is usually not a fan of my vegetarian recipes, likes this also.  Easy and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  Have made 2 times and fried both times with no problems, but next time will bake to see how it goes.

Fantastic! The only change I made was to cook in less oil. Next time I will try to brown them in a skillet and then bake like some other reviewers have suggested. My whole family loved this, including my 4 year old!

This is a great recipe! I did not change any of the ingredients but I did take other's advice and fried in a pan to brown and then transfered them to the oven to bake at 350 for 20 minutes. My husband and I had them for lunch and loved them! Thank you!

This is the first falafel I have ever made in my life and I am so impressed with it!  It turned out to be perfect..in fact, better than most falafels at gourmet restaurants!  The falafels kept their shape easily and it was so tasty.  Recipes like these make me appreciate vegetarian meals a lot more ( as I actually used to look down at vegetarian recipes!  Hahahaha! ).  Anyway, this has become a favourite in my little household...my boyfriend can`t get enough of them.  He actually ate 3 full naans ( pitas ) stuffed with 2 falafels each.  Amazing!

I have tried many Falafel recipes before even the boxed mixes and mixes obtained from Middle Eastern stores.  They were all horrible and ended up throwing them out.  This recipe is great! I did leave 1/2 the cumin out because I felt it might be overpowering since I am not really a great lover of alot of cumin. I think next time I will try all the cumin it says.  This recipe is definetly a keeper and I will be making them often.

We ate this for a month.  I loved it so much I just kept making it.  My 12 year old son pleaded for a meal with meat finally so I had to find a new recipe that was more his speed.  Just to keep the peace for a little while.

This recipe was great!  I didn't have any fresh parsley on hand, so I threw in a handful of fresh cilantro- gave it a nice flavor.  I also threw in a jalapeno pepper in to get chopped up with the onion and garlic to up the spicy factor.  Since I love curry flavor, instead of 2 teaspoons cumin, I did 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon garam masala- WOW.  It really made the recipe pop.  

As for the sauce, I strained the yogurt in a coffee filter for a half an hour or so to thicken it.  I also added a little paprika and chili powder to make it flavorful.

To trim down the calories, baked the falafel and used fat free yogurt and mayo in the sauce.  Tasted PHENOMENAL!

Fantabulous!!!  My first time trying falafel and it was great.  Love the cumin flavor, texture, moisture.  My boyfriend has been trying to find a good falafel recipe and is very pleased with this one.  A few modifications:

1) Mash chickpeas with a food processor.  Also you can chop the onion, garlic and parsley in there to save time.
2) We only used half a small onion.
3) We found 1tsp salt a little too salty.  1/2tsp was better.
4) Took a reviewer's suggestion and rolled the falafel in breadcrumbs before cooking.
5) Omit the mayo in the yogurt sauce.

A wonderful keeper!  Thanks for posting!

I used 1/4c dry parsley, didn't make the yogurt salad, and only had 3/4c bread crumbs. This was okay but I don't like it enough to repeat it.

Very good falafel.  The sauce needs 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic and the juice of one lemon though. And no mayo!

I guess I set my expectations too high after reading all the reviews. I was prepared to be blown away but was sadly disappointed. The falafal had only marginal flavor and the pita bread washed that out. I wish I had liked them as much as everyone else.

I've lost track of how many times I have made this dish. I love it! The only part I have changed is that I've increased the bread crumbs by quite a bit (usually around 1/2 to 1 cup more - eyeball it). Even the cucumber sauce is delicious. I can't say it enough - I love this recipe.

Addictive and easy, we like the falafels served in pitas. I cut down on about half of the oil called for due to personal preferences, and sometimes I get lazy and use store-bought tzatziki (cucumber sauce). It still tastes very good!

Better than the falafels I get in some restaraunts. I used store bought tzatziki sauce (from trader joe's) and I add cilantro to the falafels (about half parsley half cilantro... but a little more cilantro because I like the flavor).

I made these last night--my first attempt with falafel. They were excellent. I mixed everything in a food processor--first the onion(I only used half an onion)/garlic/parsley mixture, then the chickpeas. The texture worked out fine with no need for two separate bowls (much easier that way). As other reviewers suggested, I baked them instead of frying. In a wrap with lettuce, cucumbers and some tahini dressing (which I used in place of the cucumber sauce) I didn't notice any difference in taste or texture between these and fried falafel. Thanks for the great recipe!

Extremely tasty.  Made the cucumber sauce with Greek yogurt and no mayo.  Baked the falafel and they turned out fine, though next time might fry in a bit of oil.  Served with grilled flatbreads lightly basted with olive oil.

This was delicious, although I didn't have the ingredients to make the sauce (next time though!) and only topped with a bit of sour cream. I used half a pound of dried garbanzo beans, soaked overnight and then cooked for 3 hours in place of the canned ones.

This was soooo good and pretty easy to prepare.  I think the next time, I might try baking the falafel to make it more healthy.  I didn't try the sauce, I bought it pre-made.  Thanks!  Update:  I made these again (I used about 3/4 c breadcrumbs btw) and baked them at 425 for 20 mins and then 8 more minutes.  They came out really good and much healthier.

Very tasty! Used cilantro instead of parsley. I found trying to blend just the onion, garlic and cilantro to be impossible, so I added all the ingredients except the garbanzos and breadcrumbs to the blender and with more liquid ingredients, they mixed up fine.  I baked them per another reviewers suggestion and they were delicious.  Thanks!

Fantastic! I had to make a couple of substitutions, since I'll be moving soon, and I didn't want to buy groceries.  I used dried parsley (about 2 tablespoons) in place of the fresh and some ground up oats and whole wheat pancake mix (unsweetened) in place of the bread crumbs.  I cooked it in my George Foreman grill (brushed with a little olive oil) and served it on pita with the cucumber sauce, a little hummus, and fresh spinach. I reheated the leftovers in my toaster oven and served them over a bed of spinach with mushrooms, cucumbers, tomatoes, and the yogurt sauce for a refreshing salad.  I'll definitely make this again, and I bet it will be even better with the right ingredients!

These were very good. Lovely blend of aromatic spices. Somewhat of a nice change from the usual burgers. I made the patties ahead of time and put them in the fridge. I think this helped them stay together when fried. The cucumber sauce really sets up nicely when made an hour or so ahead. My man, who hates yogurt, liked the sauce very much.

I thought this worked very well and we will use the recipe again. We used three cloves of roasted garlic, b/c we made some earlier in the week and we like garlic. We used 1 1/2 tsp. of cumin, b/c other reviewers mentioned it and husband doesn't like cumin. We used Greek flatbread iso pita, b/c we had a lot of it (thanks to Costco). We carefully used an electric chopper and couldn't imagine not using it. We used 3 Tbsp. of mix to form each patty, which gave us 9 ovals. We chilled the patties for 20 minutes before we fried them. We think that worked well b/c it gave the patties time to "set" while we were making the tzatziki and it gave the tzatziki time to flavor while we were frying the falafel.

Wow, wonderful aroma while cooking and flavorful.  The sauce I added garlic to mine and the combo was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe.  Though I did use the food processor to "mash" the garbanzo beans - I was very careful not to overdo it by pulsing.  I got a nice chunky like texture, I also added more than a dash of cayenne pepper, didn't use the olive oil and only used about 2/3 of the bread crumbs as it was already manageable at that point.  In addition, I shallow fried them as another person suggested.  The best - thank you for making my Lenten season better :)

This was my first attempt at making Falafel, and this recipe was well received.  I made a double batch and took the advice of a previous review about boiling the chick peas in their own liquid for a few minutes to soften before mashing.  I also cut the cumin down to 1 teaspoon since others had commented on how strong it was.  I substituted cilantro for parsley and skipped the baking powder (I didn't see the point). I used panko bread crumbs and made my own cucumber sauce. I made a salad of sliced cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions tossed in lime juice and salt to go along with these. We really enjoyed this recipe Sean, thanks for sharing.

I tried fried and baked versions; both were good, but the fried was more falafel-like.  The Baked got pretty hard on the outside.

Pretty good, but the cumin was really strong. Also, I used about 3/4 c of cornmeal instead of breadcrumbs due to a gluten intolerance. It worked pretty well, but my falafel was a bit like a hushpuppy. Still good, will tweak more to my tastes.

AWESOME!!  I've made this dish 4 times in the past week.  This was my first foray into falafel, now I'm hooked.  I eat these with a little garlic hummus on top, layer with avocado slice, my version of the yogurt cucumber sauce, topped off with diced roma tomato.  Y-U-M-M-Y!

The most colorful falafel I've ever eaten! Don't overdo those breadcrumbs because that's all you'll taste. Sauce fantastic.

cumin was too overpowering.  The sauce was nothing but dill flavor.....served this to my husband and friends (who are from Jordan) and asked them if they use dill in their yogurt sauce and the answer was 'no'....I should have known that when u only have a 6 oz (single serving size) of yogurt and add 1 teaspoon of dill...that is too much.  Perhaps this is supposed to be fresh dill?  I served these on garlic oregano pitas w/lettuce, tomatoes, and red onion.  Could not taste the garlic crushed in the sauce even after 2 hours in the fridge so added another small clove....was edible but will search for another recipe.  I did find it easy to mash the beans with a pastry blender.

Thank you.  No more boxed stuff more this household.  The only change we did was bake them instead of frying.

I didn't try to make the falafels using this recipe--I have an excess of mix lying around--but the sauce is great! Update 4/1/12:  I finally made these falafels!  I didn't make them by frying them, though; I used the crockpot lady's technique of dipping them in oil, then cooking in the crockpot on high until done.  It worked perfectly!  Even the bf, who used to hate falafels, pronounced them good.  Excellent falafel recipe, thanks!  This time I didn't make the sauce--used a storebought one.

This is definitely a five star recipe. I found it an easy recipe to prepare. It tasted alot like the falafel that I ate on Porabello road in London. It is unlikely that you will use the entire cup of breadcrumbs. I rolled it into 1" balls and deep fried for about 3-4 min. stuffed them into whole wheat pita with veggies dressed in a tahini lemon dressing and a touch of extra salt. Bon-apetit!

WOW! I'm a BIG fan of Mediterranean food, and I've been buying the falafel mix in the supermarket for years. NO MORE! This recipe is easy AND delicious. I'm a beginner cook, and this was really fun to make! I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was perfect! I served it in whole wheat pitas with lettuce and tomato. I make my own sauce by combining shredded seedless cucumbers, drained yogurt (using a cheesecloth), dill weed, lemon juice, garlic and chopped onions. But Sean's sauce is similar to mine, so I'm sure it's just as great tasting as the falafels! Thanks Sean!

Wow - I can't believe I was able to make falafel that tastes this good. I followed the recipe, but used fresh coriander instead of the parlsey. I made lots of little patties instead of 8 big ones. It's a good idea for anyone who doesn't have experience making falafel like me to test fry one alone and see how it comes out. My first pattie fell apart while frying, so I just added more breadcrumbs to the mixture & the rest came out perfect! Thanx for this delicious recipe :)

These were fantastic!! Even though the recipe specifically says not to, I used a cuisinart on the chickpeas. Oops. Makes the falafel a bit too dense. Will mash next time around, which will be soon! Wonderful with hummus, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, black olives, and banana peppers in a pita. Am so happy I can finally make them at home!

Being on the Low Carb Diet Falafels were the hardest thing to give up, so I took this recipe and made it low carb replacing the garbanzo beans with Eden Black Soy Beans (you can find them at Organic stores)....I also added lots more garlic :) It is a really great recipe!!!

These were yummy!  I made the patties as stated except instead of frying them, I baked them on a cookie sheet brushed with olive oil at 425 degrees for 18 minutes on one side and 8 on the other (until browned).  We ate the patties in pita with lettuce, tomatoes, thinly sliced cucumbers and the cucumber sauce.  I served them with homemade tabbouleh as a side dish.  I'll definitely make these again!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe pretty much to a T except I baked them instead of deep frying them, and they were absolutely worth the prep time. I might have made the patties too thin because it only took about 25 minutes at 425 in the oven. I found the cucumber sauce to be superb- I used fat free, sugar free yogurt and added a small amount of stevia to taste to make it even more fat free. I'd make this again in a heartbeat! THANKS!

This was absolutely delicious. My eyes lit up from the first bite. It's simple enough to make at home and tastes like something you'd buy at a food stall in a Middle Eastern market or restaurant. I followed the recipe as is. My suggestion would be to make the cucumber sauce first to let it chill as you prepare the felafel.

Everybody should try this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I like to bake the falafel, coated in oil or baking spray, @ 400 degrees for 20 min. on each side.  Try adding a little feta to the falafel when mixing---it's awesome!

This was a great recipe. Very tasty! I doubled the recipe, increased the seasonings a bit, and used 2 eggs. Cucumber sauce is fantastic. Fried the falafel in small amount of oil, did not deep fry. Falafel was very crumbly in texture.

Really enjoyed this.  Very flavorful and easy to put together.  Use store-bought tzaziki sauce instead because I couldn't happen to find plain yogurt, so I can't comment on the yogurt sauce.  But the falafel were wonderful.  Even got my un-adventurous husband to give them a shot!  Will make again.

Excellent falafel when all is said and done.  I doubled (at least) the garlic and added more lemon juice, but it really was great.  Cucumber sauce was quick, simple, and pretty  good.

This recipe was a little time and energy consuming (especially the bean mashing- phew!) but it was worth it in the end.  I added about twice as much bread crumbs as indicated in the recipe, and I didn't have any baking powder so I had to leave it out- my felafels were a rather delicate and crumbly as a result, I think.  But they tasted great, especially with home-made hummus.

It was good! Personally, I preferred it the second time when I made it with Meatball sized falafels instead of the large patty sized ones(easier to manage while cooking and more delicious crustiness in every bite!).

Made two batches at the same time. Mashed chickpeas with a fork as suggested, and did the onion/parsley/garlic in my food processor. Added 1/2 cup Panko to one batch and 1 cup Panko to the other instead of bread crumbs, then chilled for an hour. Used my George Foreman grill to eliminate frying in oil. The softer patties (less Panko) became quite large on the grill, which took 4-5 min to cook. These were suitable over rice or grain, and were appealing with a softer texture to eat. The firmer patties stayed thicker and smaller (more suitable for pita stuffing. Served with fresh veg, grain and topped with tzatziki and corriander / cilantro chutney - which was amazing. I could eat this every day.

Turned out exactly how I hoped it would but didn’t think it would. People like their falafel certain ways. Most places I go to it’s very dry, hard and bland. Time perfect falafel is fragrant, dark brown and crispy on the outside, cake-like on the inside. This recipe gave me exactly that.

I am focusing on feeding my family more of a plant-based diet and this was very good! As many others said, it is a bit time intensive.  I served it with mango salsa, fresh greens and warm pita.  Nice change from our typical dishes.

I absolutely love these! I will often double or triple the recipe and freeze what we don't eat for supper. They are good baked or fried with or without the sauce. These work well as veggie burger patties too.

My husband and I love middle eastern food and made these together.  Truthfully it was much better than most falafel we have had in restaurants.  I would advise to make thin patties instead of balls when cooking.  Much easier and then you get the right consistency and outside coating.  Wonderful recipe!

Very yummy. Baked mine. Doubled the sauce because it's so yummy and never enough!  I eat mine on a lettuce wrap, but we've used pitas as well as made thick crepes.

I Just made this. I had made tzatziki sauce (another recipe) yesterday and was craving falafels though I hadn't had them in years. Used the bake at 400 for 10 mins on each side version. Put it together on pita with tomatos and my sauce...took one bite and literally said "WOW!" So SO delicious and so easy to make. I am beyond grateful for this fabulous recipe!

This is our favorite falafel recipe!  I skip the pita bread and eat the falafel and cucumber sauce right over a green salad with lots of cucumbers.

I didn't care for this, but my husband absolutely loved it! I don't have a frier, I just attempted to pan-fry but it didn't exactly work. I ended up with a bowl of falafel makings. That being said, the flavor was DEAD ON.

I made this exactly as written except my blender wouldn't blend the parsely, onion and garlic, so I added the olive oil to it and then it blended up well, and I baked them as some others suggested because frying can be so messy.  delicous with tomato, spinach and olives on flatbread.  The cucumber sauce is a must!  Oh, I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic in the sauce because I don't like raw garlic.  I doubled the recipe and it made more than 8 falafel.  I don't know why people complained about mashing the chick peas, I used a potato masher.  It isn't necessary to mash them completely, I had some whole chick peas in my falafel and it was great.  this tasted a lot like other falafel I've had, no need to change anything.

I thought this turned out great! Way better than anything store bought! I did make a couple changes to the tzatziki sauce- I added a dash of lemon juice, ts of garlic, and I diced up some Jarred jalepenios to give it some spicy and  salty hints.i also baked the falafel instead of fry. Turned out great!

I love this recipe! These falafels are better than any falafels I've bought in a restaurant and anyone I've ever made them for agrees. I always make a double or triple batch because they get eaten up so quickly!

Rinsed the beans and fried  the patties till they’re crispy. The flavor is good and I usually add more cumin.  Topped with tomatoes and used Arnold’s thin sandwich buns.  Frying them is my guilty pleasure but I’ve also cooked them on a waffle iron.

This is a great recipe.  I have never made falafel before and this was very easy to make.  I didn't use as much bread crumbs but they still held together just fine.  I also omitted the mayo in the sauce.

I'm giving this dish 3 stars because it is more involved than 20 minutes and the patties tend to crumble unless enough bread crumbs are used. The sauce is delicious. The chopped tomatoes are a must!

Rating the sauce only.  Used the sauce recipe over falafal balls that I bought.  I did include the optional mayo.  We enjoyed the sauce, but I think a little bit of spices would have added more flavor.

Family loved it! I made about 15 small falafels. Used 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, instead of garlic cloves. I used 6 tablespoons of flour instead of 1 egg, as other reviewers suggested. I used baking soda, instead of baking powder.
AS for the sauce: I used 1/2 cup parsley, instead of dill weed. I also added 1 tblsp of minced garlic. I omitted mayo altogether. Sauce turned out great!

The sauce was good. I used Greek yogurt instead of regular. The mix seemed to be missing something so I added a squeeze of lemon juice and a dash of lemon pepper, which seemed to do the trick. It's a really good, mild sauce and I like it a lot. Next time, I'd make 1/3rd more sauce because I like cucumber sauce so much.

For the patties, I added two eggs and had to substitute cilantro for coriander. Hand-mashing the garbanzos was a bit of a pain because the beans slipped through the space in my 'coil-style' hand masher. I found that quick, angled strokes worked best. It didn't take much pressure to make the soft beans burst.

I baked the patties at 400 for 10 minutes a side and then broiled them for two minutes. The texture was good. Having whole beans that slipped through the mash didn't seem to matter. No problem with the baking powder, but I wasn't frying them.

Together, the patties and the sauce taste really, really delicious. I'm adding this to my regular meal rotation. I'm hoping the mashed stuff will freeze well so I can have a big tub of this for lazy nights when I don't feel like cooking.

I baked these at 425 for 20 minutes on an oil spayed, foil lined cookie sheet. Then flipped them and cooked 5-10 min more. Turned out so yummy! Only down fall was I should have doubled the recipe!

I use this as my standard falafel.  Like someone else said I not only double but I triple this recipe.  I don't even mix by hand!  I throw the chickpeas and onion into my food processor until it's just crumbly but still wet.  I triple my spices, add cumin and either bake or fry.  Delish!!!!!

Very Delish falafel recipe.  I needed a Lenten dish and we love falafel and I had everything on hand so I tried it.  We truly loved it. There is a local place here that sells falafel balls and we love them. They are the size of cocktail meatballs,  maybe a tiny bit larger. I decided to make mine the same size and shape as those.  Falafel: changed nothing except added an extra clove of garlic for good measure.  Sauce: we love tzatziki sauce with falafel however, I wanted to try this entire recipe. Usually tzatziki is shredded cucumber and this was chopped and of course tzatziki has garlic and this doesn't. . So I made the sauce exactly as written only used fresh dill (is that really a change???) Tasted it....I HAD to add lemon juice. Just a smidge. That was a change so I'm sorry for changing it. Well, we loved loved loved the sauce like this. Some of us even liked it more than my tzatziki because there wasn't that "raw garlic bite" yet still complimented the falafel. I pan heated pocketless pita breads.... 1 minute on each side. I cut each in half and put a dollop of sauce, the falafel ball, and then tomato on top. Folded and enjoyed immensely. Thanks for a truly great recipe. Will make again and again.

Yum...thought it was quite good.  Definitely easier when you bake it as suggested, but also drier.  Next time I'll sprinkle more oil on top before baking.

I solved the issue of the falafel patties falling apart in the oil by reducing the bread crumbs to a half cup. I also added a 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro instead of the ground coriander, which helped even more. The falafel mixture is much wetter this way, so I rolled the patties in a little whole wheat flour before frying. Use baking soda NOT powder. The cucumber sauce needed salt for balance,but it got better everyday. This was a good base-line recipe.

My falafel were amazing, but I give it 4 stars because the falafel fall apart when frying and I had to substitute the baking powder for baking soda as other viewers mentioned.  If they fall apart, just add another egg.  It helps to make small balls and have the pan covered with a thin layer of oil.  For the cucumber sauce, I excluded mayo and dill weed and used plain Greek yogurt.  Yield: 18-20 small falafel balls.

Awesome recipe! I did omit the eggs and breadcrumbs instead I added flour as one reviewer suggested I allowed the mixture to set in for about 30 minutes. The seasoning is just right. Soo very good I doubled the recipe, cooked up whole batch and have in the freezer for future lunches! 

In the future I think I would not cook the falafels then freeze, there is a texture issue. I would make the whole thing shape patties, then flash freeze. I would cook frozen patties so the freshness and crispness wouldn't be compromised.

I really like the way the falafels turn out when I get the oil temperature right in my pan. My kids love these and so do I. I've never tried the cucumber sauce.

I have been looking for a recipe that would come close to my favorite resturant's falafel...THIS IS IT. My husband, a falafel junkie, boosts this recipe is a keeper. I have been making these even since and never any left overs. Awesome.

This recipe is fantastic and simple. I've changed it up a bit and it always turns out great! I suggest fresh dill or the goop in the tube for the yogurt sauce. Sometimes I used cilantro instead of parsley and I double the recipe. I'm a fan!

Was not a fan!! I always been a fan of falafels but never made it myself. This one tasted nothing like it..I made it exactly as stated, except I did bake it as other suggested. Not sure if that was what made it so dry and tasteless.

The best falafel recipe that I have found.  I cooked  dried chickpeas  seasoning them with onions and sea salt and  followed the recipe.  My meat loving grandkids devoured them. Best ever!!  Waldine

Great flavor!!  Some adjustments I made based on other reviewers: for the sauce, I used fresh dill, omitted the mayo, added lemon and salt to taste.  For the falafel, I used 3 cloves instead of 2 cloves of garlic, added 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, and used 2/3 cup of bread crumbs.  I microwaved the chickpeas for 1 min which made mashing easy ~3-5 min. I made about 16 balls and tossed them in breadcrumbs prior to frying - this prevented them from falling apart. I didn't flatten them into patties since they were smaller balls.  Crunchy on the outside and moist flavorful deliciousness on the inside.  Thanks!

I got 16 falafels out of this, not 8.  You have to be sure they're 1/2 inch thick or so, or they won't cook in the oil in the time it takes the outsides to brown.  I found them a bit dry as well, but maybe because I have to make them so thin to get them to cook through.

The 5 is for the falafel itself (fantastic!) but I would give it a 3 on the cucumber sauce (meh). I use this falafel recipe & cooking instructions exactly as it but use a different recipe for the cucumber sauce.

I had been messing with a prepackaged falafel mix over the years, each time being disappointed with the results (actually throwing it in the garbage!).  So I decided to try it homemade.  This is the first recipe I tried and I am very pleased with it.  No need for me to look for another.  I have made it successfully twice now and I will definately make it again.  I didn't make the sauce so I have no comment on that.  But the falafel is a winner for sure!

This was delicious. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked them instead of frying to save some calories. They came out fabulous. My husband loved it, and my picky kids even were willing to eat it, which says a lot. I will be making this many, many times in the future.

I consider myself a falafel fanatic, and this recipe was not only quick and easy, but absolutely delicious!  I used a deep fryer with canola oil to cook them and they came out just perfect!

I never, repeat.. never, write reviews. But for this dish I'm really compelled to say something. It's really very easy, makes a TON (I didn't realize a single can of beans go make so much), and it tastes delicious. I make these for my wife and I on a weekly basis! Thanks so much!

These were fantastic! Ive never had falafels and these were a wonderful surprise! Great texture, stayed together well, fried great. I would leave out half the amount of salt next time though, otherwise, they were GREAT!

My family really liked this meal & I was surprised at how easy it is to make. MUCH better than the packaged falafel mixes I bought at Middle East markets. I will be making my own falafel from now on!

One of the best things about a recent vacation in the middle east was the delicious falafel. Since then, I've tried the box mix and it just wasn't the same. This recipe however is every bit as good as what we had over there. While still hot, I coated the falafel patties in sesame seeds for a little extra crunch and it was yummy. I also used dried garbanzo's that had soaked overnight in water and then simmered for about 10 minutes. Very fresh and delicious with the sauce. A true winner in our family!!

This is the first time I have ever made falafel with canned chick peas. We really didn't care for it. Falafel made with soaked dried chickpeas are crunchy around the edges and soft in the middle. These were just soft. The flavor was decent but the texture really fell short. I tried this recipe because grinding chickpeas in my 3 cup capacity chopper isn't too fun lol. But after eating "real" falafel we just can't make it this way. This is better than using a dry mix though. Thanks for sharing.

This was AMAZING! I used dried garbanzo beans. Cooked them and drained them well. It was fine to food process them...not being canned they were not too moist. I baked them at 400 for about 12 min..sprayed with canola oil spray flipped halfway through. The sauce was good, but I spruced it up with some lemon juice and garlic! Served with tabouli! LOVED IT!

I really like these.  Next time I'll try baking them in the oven as suggested by another reviewer:  Preheat the oven at 400 degrees F. Bake 10 minutes, flip, then another 10 minutes. Then broil each side for 2 minutes.  I served with tomatoes, lettuce and pita bread.  Delicious.

So good! Used baking soda instead of baking powder as someone suggested. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written, although I eyeballed the bread crumbs. Very yummy!! Will def make again.

These are fantastic! I did make some changes based on what I had on hand (grocery day is tomorrow :/). Here's what I used:
- a chopped green pepper and shallot instead of the onion 
- dried dill (1/2 t) instead of the parsley
- whole wheat panko for the breadcrumbs
- I baked the falafels at 350 for 15 minutes instead of frying. When I took them off of the baking sheet, some of them fell apart, so they probably could have benefited from more breadcrumbs (I used the cup that is called for).

I also didn't have the ingredients to make the cucumber sauce, but the falafels are great on their own! I'll definitely make these again & actually follow the recipe ;).

Really nice flavor.  Even my fussy eater liked them!  I omitted the salt in the falafel, and I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used about 3 tablespoons of dry parsley.  I cooked them in less than 1/2 inch of oil, and they came out fine.  Blot on paper towels to soak up any excess oil.  I made the yogurt sauce a couple of hours ahead so flavors would blend.  Next time I would mix in blender to puree the cucumber for a smoother sauce.  Will make again!

much too salty for me, I couldn't eat it.  I don't eat much salt so I am sensitive to it.  I still gave it 3 stars because I will try it again and omit all salt.

SO DELICIOUS!  Thank you, Sean!  I never thought of making homemade falafel, but I saw this recipe and was immediately inspired.  I used 2 good tablespoons of dried parsley instead of fresh (the parsley in my fridge had seen better days).  That was the only change I made to the recipe.  I smashed the chickpeas with a potato masher.  I added *almost* the full cup of breadcrumbs, but left maybe a tablespoon or two behind.  I scooped the mix with a 2-tablespoon scoop (like an ice cream scoop, but smaller) and flattened them on a floured surface with the bottom of a floured glass.  I fried them in corn oil.  I ended up with 22 or so patties (hard to know - I ate probably half a dozen of them while I cooked). I repeat - these are SO DELICIOUS.  I didn't even bother with the sauce.  I plan to eat these on salads for lunch during the week.  By the way, the only time these started to fall apart in the oil was when I overcrowded the pan halfway through the fry batches - I think the oil was too cold, maybe?  Otherwise, they fried up perfectly without any issues.  (So delicious.)

Out of the three recipes I've tried this is by far the best for the Falafel.  I'm Greek by Heritage so I've got a better recipe for tzaziki (Dill Cucumber Sauce).  FYI you can freeze the dough if you want to have it ready to go for a later date.

These are really good, I used curry powder in place of just straight up cumin. The spices are a little weird, so next time I will follow to a tee. I also baked them (425 for 20 minutes then flipped and baked for another 10). I bet these are way better fried. Perhaps I will pan fry the ones I baked when I reheat them.

Delicious flavourful recipe! I started out mashing the chickpeas with a fork, but I didn't like the consistency, so I used a food processor. This made it easier to form into patties.

This is the first falafel recipe I've tried that actually came out right!  I'm stoked!  My girlfriend said it was the best homemade falafel she's ever had, now I just have to figure out how to top the Israeli guys at our favorite falafel spot.  Great recipe!

I made this with four green onions in place of an onion and doubled the spices.  I also added 1 t paprika.  I put everything but the beans in the food processor and blended it to a slurry.  Then I added the beans and processed them at med-low speed until they were chunky, but not a paste.  I served them on whole wheat pita with lettuce, tomato and feta.  I also added a tahini and Greek yogurt sauce (2 T tahini + 1 T lemon juice + 5oz greek yogurt).

I really enjoyed this recipe!  So I doubled up on the recipe because as mashing the first can, it didnt seem like it would be enough (in retrospect it really was more than enough).  I realized I didnt have any eggs, but thought I would try it without as I have seen other recipes that don't use eggs.  Also, I substituted cilantro for parsley for two reasons (1. i like the flavor more, and 2. if there was leftover cilantro, I had a use for it unlike parsley).   Since I doubled it, I actually used one onion because it was a larger one. 

As for the tzatziki, I doubled that as well (as my fam loves sauces!).  The only thing I added was a bit of garlic paste (about half a cloves worth).  It made such a big difference to the sauce!

As for cooking method, I baked a small batch to see how it would turn out (I had read this on another review for this recipe).  I formed patties and then slightly liberally brushed it with oil Though slightly dry, I really did like the baked version as it cut the grease.  Even in terms of the frying, though, it turned out great.  I made pita pocket sandwiches out of it and found it to be a very enjoyable meal.  The family really loved it too, which was great!  Will definitely be making this again.

My fiance made this for dinner last night and it was awesome!  Appropriate amount of spices, and the falafel did not fall apart - the cucumber sauce is so good you could eat it with a spoon.

My first time making falafel was last night, with this recipe, and it was GREAT! We will definitely be having this again! I used panko for the bread crumbs, otherwise no changes to the ingredients. And instead of frying in oil, I basted them with a small amount of olive oil and broiled them. YUM! THANKS for the great addition to our regular meal plans!

I'm giving it 4 stars because I only made the falafels.  I baked them in the oven @ 400 for 10 min and flipped them once, they didn't need to be broiled but I would if need be.  I used tzaziki sauce instead of making the sauce with the recipe.  The falafels were good and really easy.

The falafels taste good, but take some time to make. I had two big issues with this recipe: 1) the chickpeas I used did not want to mash, and 2) without liquid, the onions and parsley would not blend. I had to move the onions and parsley to the food processor. After they were pureed, I added in the chickpeas and pulsed them until mashed. 

Next time, I'm going to make smaller patties and bake them as other reviewers have suggested. The bigger patties I made broke apart when I flipped them, as I used a shallower fry than what was called for.

This recipe is outstanding! It was easy, fast and super delicious. We used homemade yogurt to make the sauce. My husband said these falafel were better than what we get at our favorite middle eastern restaurant ... works for me! We wouldn't change the recipe at all and will definitely make again. Brilliant!

Wow! This recipe is fantastic. I only changed a few things. I substituted baking powder for baking soda as others have suggested to do and it didn't foam, added minced garlic to the yogurt mixture, and used a mini electric food chopper to mash up the chickpeas; it makes them a nice even size. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty falafel and cucumber sauce.  My 5 year old really enjoyed them too.  I followed everything in the recipe, but as per the instructions, I just added bread crumbs until it was the right consistency so definitely didn't need a full cup.  The one change was the cooking method, didn't deep fry them, I baked at 375 as some other reviewers suggested and they turned out lovely.

I can't thank you enough for this recipe - I didn't have any issues with the baking powder. I only filled the pan with 1/2 to 3/4" of canola oil and used one JUMBO-sized egg and a little more than 3/4c. bread crumbs.I only had one piece fall apart but I started with 9 balls so it's all good! The only other changes I made was to use fresh dill and miracle whip for the mayonnaise - I will say this, though - if you normally don't use mayonnaise, you'd be better off just using one of those packets from a fast food joint. And I also didn't use salt or pepper in the sauce - completely unnecessary! One other thing, if you fry, you need to wait until the oil reaches at least 375, otherwise they won't cook right! And second batch always comes out better than the first! :-) Cheers!

The cucumber sauce is called tsatsiki in greek restaurants.  To keep it from being watery put the cucumbers into a cheese cloth or bowl that drains for a couple hours.  Lightly salt the cumbers to pull out the extra water.  We put garlic in the tsatsiki.

I made this for friends who had never even heard of falafal - we all liked this recipe!  It had a nice flavor without being too spicy or any one ingredient standing out.  I didn't have any trouble shaping the patties and frying them, and I even saved some of the mix to make later this week.  The only difference in my recipe was that we didn't have fresh parsley, so I used the last of my dry parsley and something else to substitute (don't remember now...).  Came out great!

Made this exactly as written except tripled the recipe.  It was wonderful...I used mint however in the sauce instead of dill just because it was my preference.  It was WONDERFUL!..Thanks for the recipe.  It does take a bit of work to mash up the chickpeas by hand...but well worth the work for the result.

Absolutely delicious! I'll admit, I was a bit hesitant to make these even with all the great reviews since I'm not a huge fan of chickpeas but they were amazing. I made homemade pita bread as well. I fried them in the tiniest bit of oil, not 1 inch like the recipe called for. And we didn't have any dill weed.

This was excellent.  I recently discovered falafel, and this recipe is just like what I have experienced.  I made exactly as directed:  it was easy, quick, and very very tasty.  I smashed the falafel inside a warm pita and topped with shredded lettuce, cheese, cucumber sauce, and a tiny bit of hot sauce.  My boyfriend said it was probably the first meal he had without meat in years and is looking forward to having it again.  You won't be disappointed in this!

I love this recipe. It was so simple. I don't know why I waited so long to make it. Instead of processed bread crumbs I used 3 pieces of toasted wheat bread that I put in the food processor. My son enjoys the patties also. I feel much better giving my family falafel rather than giving them meat.

i'm so delighted - thank you for sharing this recipe!!  i'll never make falafel from a boxed mix again!  these were easy to make and totally delicious.  crispy on the outside and moist and yummy inside.  i followed the recipe exactly - except maybe adding more than 2 cloves of garlic.   i saw some reviewers had a problem with the falafel falling apart in the oil, and here's my advice - don't make them patty shaped.  make very round balls.  throw the ball into the palm of your hand, like you're making meatballs.  and put each ball directly into the hot oil, instead of forming them all at once and letting them sit until you're ready to cook them.  my husband experimented with making them more patty shaped and we had falafel crumble - which still tasted great as a sandwich with tahini sauce!  but the balls were round, crispy and perfect.

I found these falafels easy to make, and very yummy.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly , except I used dried parsley instead of fresh, and dried chickpeas instead of canned (which I prefer, flavor-wise).  I doubled the recipe for my family of 9 and we had one falafel left over -- and everyone liked them.  Will definitely make again!

I made these for my picky eaters last night,(my husband, 9 year old & 3 year old) to my surprise they all loved them. I used two cans of chick peas, 2 eggs and 1 cup of whole wheat dry bread crumbs and had no problems with consistency. I fried them in canola oil and they stayed together beautifully. I drained them on paper towels then held them in a 300 degree oven on a wire rack over a cookie sheet and they were not oily at all. I did take the advice of another reviewer and used baking soda instead, I too noticed the use of soda not powder in several other recipes. For the sauce I added minced garlic, a little lemon juice and a teaspoon of olive oil mayo. It had great flavor and just the thickness I was looking for.

This recipe is so tasty and easy to make. Followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I did however modify the sauce by not adding the mayo. It was still great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Wonderful and easy recipe!  I've made it at least once a month since I first tried it.  I use dried chickpeas and soak them overnight.  Have never had any problems with them falling apart or making the oil foam like some have mentioned - perhaps those that had them fall apart were not rolling them tightly enough.  You have to work the dough a little.  I would omit the mayo from the yogurt sauce, and add some lemon juice and garlic or garlic powder.

I made these last night and they were excellent! I followed other suggestions and baked them instead of frying, and I dipped them in bread crumbs before spraying them with olive oil and baking. They came out flavorful with a crunchy outside. I used a different sauce, but I highly recommend the falafel! Will definitely make these again.

This is the best home falafel recipe ever! I havnt tried the cucumber sauce because i have my own recipe... but the ingredients for the falafel are awesome!  Here is how i changed it up a bit to avoid frying and cut some calories.  So i mashed up the chickpeas in a separate bowel.  I have a Ninja as a foodprocessor or blender.  So i used it to blend the parsley, onion, and garlic.  I poured it into the mashed chickpeas and stirred it together.  Then i added the other ingredients.  I formed 8 patties and baked them in the oven at 400 degrees F.  You can place them in a nonstick or silicon baking pan too which molds them nicely and prevents cracking.  But anway.. i sprayed canola oil on them, then baked for 10 minutes and then flipped sprayed again and baked for another 10 minutes.. then broiled for 2 minutes on each side like another review instructed.. and they came out awesome!!!

I feel like i'm crazy for leaving such a bad review, but honestly, I followed this recipe closely except I baked, not fried it. But the flavor should still be good. It was extremely bland and tasted mostly like onions. I even only used 1/2 an onion (I had a large onion) and I doubled the spices (because I like a lot of cumin). But it was still bland after that. Really peculiar. To eat it, I'm dousing it with yogurt sauce. I've made falafel before, as well, so I'm not exactly a novice. I would say the best thing about it? The texture. Spot on. That's about it. I was generous with my 2 stars.

Making falafel was SO MUCH easier than I thought it would be!! I had trouble getting my veggies to chop in my blender, so I transferred them to my mini food processor and had no problems from there. I didn't have to add a whole cup of bread crumbs, either. These were quite good, the cucumber sauce was simple and we really enjoyed our meal! Thank you...we'll definitely be having this one again.

Good falafels, but I will add more garlic next time. Also, the sauce needed some help as it was a little bland so I added fresh lemon zest and lemon juice as well as some chopped parsley. Next time I will also add tahini to the sauce to make it more authentic.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out fantastic!!!  Falafel does tend to be crumbly so make sure to mash the beans real good into a paste and get the oil very hot before putting them in. I made hamburger sized patties so they would fit perfectly into the whole wheat pita bread I served them with.   The only thing I did change was the sauce.  I prefer a traditional tzatziki sauce with falafel.  Will definitely make this again.

The taste of the falafel was quite good.  I used ground sea salt and eyeballed it, so mine didn't come out as salty as some seemed to claim.  However, because I mashed the chick peas into a thick paste (as instructed) and blended the onion, garlic, and parsley, my falafel rounds were very pasty inside.  I didn't like that texture at all.  Next time I will mash the peas until they just break down into small chunks and i will go through the painstaking work of finely dicing the onion, garlic, and parsley.  I'd prefer it if it were more crumbly and less pasty.

A recipe that I have been wanting to try for some time but, wasn't sure how the rest of  family would like it....well, they LOVED it!  Not the best falafel I've had, but, still very good & looking forward to making this for a 'veggie' meal every once in awhile.  I made the Naan bread from AR to go along with it.

I decided to try my hand at making falafel, because I didn't want to keep spending $10/day, going to my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant for lunch every day. This turned out rather well. I baked mine on parchment paper at 400 degrees for 10 minutes on the top and bottom. With the oil and the paper, I didn't need to do any spraying; they'll brown anyway. I would recommend cutting the salt to 1/2 tsp. I found that adding the olive oil to the parsley/garlic/onion mixture made a better consistency for mixing with the chickpeas. These also go well with homemade hummus. I ate this with a side of homemade Kushari, homemade hummus, warm pita, and a fresh salad. Don't forget the rose water lemonade!

Delish! I did not peel or seed cucumber or add coriander. I added a little garlic powder to the sauce. It could have used a little raw red onion to serve it with. I also froze the left over balls before frying. We'll see how those turn out.

This was my first taste of falafel. This recipe is very good! My fellow and I both liked it. The sauce was also very light and refreshing. We just ate it plain and just dipped into the sauce. It would also be excellent with a few in a warm pita with some feta, lettuce, red onion, and the sauce.

Awesome, The best we have ever had. I made it gluten free by substituting Bob's Red Mill GF Cornbread mix for the bread crumbs. Also, I used the pulse mode on my food processor to chop up the beans, and then added the chopped onions, and cilantro. Yummo! Highly recommended!

WOW! I've never had falafel before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but these were AMAZING!!!! I made them exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. I served them on pita bread with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, onions and the cucumber sauce, which was also AMAZING! I know I will be making this very often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really good, baked mine as well to be a bit more healthier at 400, 10 min per side like another reviewer, less bread crumbs next time, maybe 2/3 cup instead, very yummy though:)

This is the first recipe in a long time that totally failed on me.  I was cautious adding bread crumbs because the recipe seemed to be warning you not to add too many.  I made exactly as the recipe stated.  I made 4 patties which used about half the amount of the batter (for lack of a better term).  Well when I put them in 1 inch of oil I watched them literally boil apart before my eyes.  All that was left in the pan was an oily sloppy mess.  I was really ticked off.  It's my first time trying to make falafel (I've eaten them many times) and I was expecting much better results.  They were truly inedible.  Back to the drawing board.  I went back and added in more breadcrumbs.  Then I made very thin little patties and very lightly coated my pan with olive oil.  This time they fried up without falling apart.  They tasted pretty good, though not as good as the ball kind from a restaurant.  My opinion may have been tainted by the fact that I only had half of the batter remaining to work with.  All-in-all I'll keep looking for a different recipe.  My warning,  DO NOT try to fry these in 1 inch of oil!

Quick and easy to mix up; the cucumber sauce was especially flavorful.  Added some garlic to give more flavor.  This is a keeper for us to enjoy!  Thanks

This was excellent. I used the top rated Naan recipe off here for the pita bread- a lot of work but really made the falafel perfect! I made several changes based on what I had available. 1) no mayo in the sauce- didnt see the need for it. 2) used minced garlic rather than dill-i dont like dill. 3) use Italian bread crumbs because thats all I had 4) used dried parsley 5) didn't put this in a blender- just minced onion 6) used two eggs to help it hold together  7) used baking soda, not baking powder- because i saw a review about an explosive chemical reaction between oil and baking powder- it scared me lol.  I kept all of the spices the same, so i think this tasted pretty closet to the original. I will be making this again for sure. The addition of homemade Naan bread really made this special rather than just quick and easy. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!!

Yummmm!! These were so delicious!  Used basil instead of parsley since that was all I had.  Also pulsed chickpeas in food processor and the texture turned our perfect!  Only change I'll make is to bake next time!

So good! I heated up the chickpeas - as another reviewer suggested - it made mashing much easier. I didn't have fresh parsely so I used dried. I didn't use the entire cup of breadcrumbs because it just seemed too much - used about 3/4 cup. Lastly, I baked them instead of frying for a much healthier verison. Oh, and try them with Trader Joe's tzatziki cucumber and garlic sauce if you don't want to make the sauce too - its so good! Enjoy ladies!

I used garlic & onion powder instead of fresh, & dried parsley as well. It still turned out amazingly well. I cooked them in extra virgin olive oil.

Super easy and just as tasty!  Like others, I baked instead of fried.  Some of the best tzatziki sauce I've ever had!  Served in a whole wheat pita with sauce, feta, lettuce, and tomatoes.  Mmm!

I made falafel since I was 10 years old (not from canned beans ), and I did`t like this one at all, they were greasy and tasteless, may be it`s ok for people who did`t try the real authenticated falafel or used to make falafel from the falafel powder.  I just tried this recipe coz it`s easier but I`m not going to make it again.

Made this again and did a few modifications....cut the cumin in half, used whole wheat bread crumbs and for the sauce I subbed honeydew melon for the cucumber (family member is allergic) and used Greek yogurt and it was a huge hit!  

I love this reciped and make it at least twice a month, so good for snacks, meals, appies at a party

The first time I made this, I followed another reviewer's suggestion to bake them. I found them too dry. This time, I made smaller patties (about 18) and pan fried them in olive oil until brown on both sides, and then baked at 400 for 3 mins. They were moist and delicious without being oily! I also made the cucumber sauce a few hours ahead and the flavours married perfectly. A keeper!

So delicious! Non-falafel-fans were converted. We fried these to save time and some of them fell apart, but even what came off was delicious.

I really really wanted this recipe to work, but it fell apart. Even after taking out an extra cup of the breadcrumbs it was so very dry. I think if I had added a third egg it might have worked, or not added any breadcrumbs at all.  I did bake them, and substituted baking soda for powder.  The taste was very good (other than the dryness).  I think maybe climate? might play a part.  I live in a very dry state, and maybe that was a contributor?  I will definitely try these again in hopes of a better turn out.

Pretty good, I baked mine, at about 400F for about 10 minutes on each side. I also used dried chickpeas, and next time I make it I'll cut the cumin in half, it was overpowering for my taste. Overall, very good flavor and texture and easy to make.

Excellent falafel recipe.  I'll never buy from a restaurant again (unless I'm back in Israel).  Good tzatziki too.  Wife and three year old loved it.  I made it into little 1.5" balls, cut some red onion, tomato, lettuce and toasted pita for little sandlwiches.  Improvised some dill basmati rice and had a great healthful dinner!

This was hands down the best falafel I have ever had. It was beautiful in the center (which seems to be my problem with most falafel recipes) and it wasn't as dense as most falafel recipes I've tried. Add in the forearm workout and it preburns the calories you get from deep frying! I did waste half the batch when it fell apart in the oil (:(), so a test falafel like someone suggested would be a good idea. I just added more bread crumbs (definitely more than called for in the recipe) and the second batch was AWESOME! Thanks for sharing.

Very good and flavorful.  I baked in the oven (425 and it took mine about 30 min).  I did end up drizzling some olive oil over the top as they were sticking a bit with just pam spray.  I didnt make the sauce - so just rating the falafel.  My first attempt at homemade falafel, it was very easy and I will definitely make again - with sauce and all the fixings.  I got 12 decent sized patties out of the mixture

This recipe was amazing. I did this in the food processor, used dried parsley. I just pan fried these. I highly recommend this recipe. Unfortunately, my husband didn't like it (no surprise there). It's a great quick meal that I will still make frequently for myself I think. When I first made it, I just fried up 4 of the balls, and put the other 4 in the fridge to fry up as needed. It took about 5 minutes to fry them up to eat for my lunches, so to me its just as quick as a sandwich, but a little bit special.

Very good recipe.  I did bake mine and doubled the batch after reading many of the reviews.  I used 2 cans of chick peas and made over 2 dozen falafel patties!!!!  I also used my food processor to quickly chop up the chickpeas with the onion, garlic, parsley mixture and the texture was perfect.  I used 1/4 cup of egg beaters and 1 cup of whole wheat panko crumbs.  I also added 2 tsps of cornstarch in addition to 1 tsp of baking powder to ensure they held together.  I baked them at 425 degrees, 15 minutes on one side and 10 minutes on the other.  They were lightly browned and crunchy on the outside and perfectly baked on the inside.  I made the cucumber sauce and my own hummus.  Both were delicious.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

We fried our falafel, and for the first couple of patties the oil was too cool.  When we cranked the heat more towards the high end, then they got nice and dark brown and hot in the center without getting soggy with oil.  Amazing recipe!  Also, make sure you make the cucumber sauce BEFORE you make your falafel so it can cool.

I've made these many times now. I follow the recipe as written, with the following three amendments: 1) I measure the parsley very generously (1/2 cup firmly packed, plus some), 2) I microwave the chickpeas for about a minute before mashing (makes it much easier) and 3) I double the recipe for the cucumber sauce. We eat the falafel in pitas with lettuce, tomatoes, whatever other veggies we have on hand, plus LOTS of the sauce. Fabulous!

This was my first attempt at making homemade falafel.  I usually use a mix.  The flavor was awesome and I loved that they were moist in the middle and crunchy on the outside.  My husband said he prefers them a little lest mushy in the middle but that could be that I didn't cook quite long enough.  I only gave this recipe 4 stars because it was alot of trial and error to get enough bread crumbs and I ended up needing nearly twice as much as called for.  That would not have been a big deal but I ran out of bread crumbs and had to mash up crackers in their place which just required more work but the taste was still wonderful.

This turned out so well!  I didn't use coriander or parsley because I didn't have any in the house.  I personally felt that the amount of cumin was too much, and plan to cut it in half next time to suit my personal preference.  The cucumber sauce is to die for!

This recipe is a fast favorite in my house. We divide up the chickpea mixture into smaller portions so the falafel is crispier throughout. We also like to make the yogurt sauce with greek yogurt instead of just plain it adds a little more flavor. Excellent dish!!

This was delicious!  I did end up adding an extra egg.  I found that if I reduced the size of the balls, they stood a better chance of not falling apart.  I omitted the mayo in the cucumber sauce and it was delicious.  Also, I double the recipe because the 8 balls didn't seem like enough.  Now I have falafel to eat tomorrow!  The original recipe definitely makes enough to feed a 4-person family.

This was great!  I did not have coriander, but it still came out great.  I did make some changes though after talking to the falafel guy in my neighborhood and looking at another recipe online.  I soaked an entire bag of chick peas overnight.  I measured about a can's worth of beans using an empty can and cooked them for 1 hour before I mashed them.  I didn't have coriander, so I did not use it.  Also - I used italian seasoned bread crumbs because that is what I had.  I eyeballed the (dried)parsley since I did not have fresh.  I made balls instead of patties and baked them and had about 14.  I know of a place that sells them really cheap downtown, and usually get one when I'm in that area, but it's nice to know how to make it yourself.

Sean - thank you!! I have always been a fan of falafel, but I had no idea how it was supposed to taste. Wow - moist, lemony, herby, fresh, crispy... It is completely different from what I have known as falafel. Of course now that I know what I'm missing, I will always have to have homemade!

I love this recipe because it turns out delicious every time. The falafel is very flavorful. I only change the yogurt sauce to have chopped mint instead of dill, a clove of garlic, and no mayo.

Turned out very nice.  Great for meatless meals during Lent.  Doubled the recipe and it seemed to keep well in the fridge for a few days.

I didn't realize how easy falafels were to make.  My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I didn't even bother to get the food processor out.  Just chopped the ingredients in small pieces and mixed with the beans.  I grated the peeled, seeded cucumber and squeezed some of the water out.  I drained the plain yogurt for about an hour and I think the sauce was a little thick.  Next time I will use as is.

I use this recipe to make falafel burgers.  I reduced the cumin and onion by half and I use 1-2 Tbs of dried parsley rather than fresh.  Then, I pan fry it on a lightly oiled griddle and serve the burgers on buns with tomatoes and spinach.  My husband likes them with honey mustard.

My first time making falafel and the entire family loved this recipe.  I eliminated the salt & cayenne for diet/preference reasons, and added extra spices & lemon juice instead. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. My blender wasn't working, so I took an onion chopper to both the onion/garlic and the chickpeas which worked just fine.  And I baked them at 425 on a Pampered Chef bar pan for 25 mins, flipping them once. I didn't have fresh dill for the sauce either, so ground some dill seed in a pestle & mortar and used that instead. Served it all in pita-bread halves with cucumber, tomato & grated carrot.  Kids thought it was great fun - like a Taco dinner - and ate it all up without a murmur of complaint!  Everyone agreed I should make these again!

Wow is all I can say!! I made these just the way it said to make them. I spent about 15 minutes or more reading through the reviews to make sure I got them just right but in the end just followed the recipe. Mine came out moist and flavorful. These even made a hit with my youth group!!! The only thing I did different was use low fat sour cream instead of the yogurt in the dip. YUMMY, I will be making these again and again!!

These were very good, I served them in a pita with spinach & tomato.  Instead of deep frying we pan fried them with a couple tablespoons of oil in an effort to reduce some of the fat.  They truned out great this way.  I also reduced the salt by half and they were fine with less salt.

These came out great! I did a quick pulse on the chickpeas in the processor rather than mashing and almost pureed the onions and garlic since my husband doesn't like chunks. I used dried parsley since I didn't have fresh and pan fried in grapeseed oil. A good tip to try is to have a plate with flour on it and when you make each patty, pat flour on each side to keep it together and it will form a nice crust as well. Next time I will try adding some fresh mint and try sour cream instead of mayo for the sauce. This recipe did not take very long at all for me, I plan to make this at least once a month from now on. They were also a great leftover snack!  Next time I made this I added lemon juice (half squeezed lemon) to the sauce as well as a tbs. of sour cream in addition to the mayo. Delish!

Excellent! After reading the reviews I was a little worried about these falling apart but I had no problems. I made one batch pan-fried and one batch baked; the baked batch was too dry for my taste - pan-frying is the way to go I think. I made the mistake of throwing unseeded cucumbers into the sauce and throwing all that into the blender and it came out thin, but it was the perfect flavor so the consistency was not a big issue. If you like things flavorful, add a bit more spice - I added 50% more of everything. I served this with the Couscous and Cucumber Salad from this site and my meat-eating boyfriend loved our vegetarian dinner! I will be making this again for sure.

I'm only rating the falafel; we made our own tsatsiki to go with these.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I made my falafel's a bit smaller, so I came out with 15.  I browned them in some olive oil on the stove top and then transferred to the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  Delicious!

Very good I made this tonite and we put the falafel in fresh syrian bread with homemade hummus, pickled turnips, and mediteranian salad.  To make this a little healthier I still cooked the falafel patties on the stovetop but reduce the amount of oil. Thanks Sean for a wonderful recipe, no more store bought dry mix for me.  I also made the cucumber sauce which was easy to make and good but my family and I prefer the hummus in its place.  Can't wait to share this one with my vegetarian Sister-In-Law.  Thanks again!

This was a long recipie to make... But worth the wait! the falafels came out well the ones that I coated in breadcrumbs, and some i dusted with flour held together better than the ones i did not. I added 1/2 stalk celery, and 1/8 cup of sweetpepper to the mix. I used geram masala as it has in both corriander and cumin. For the sauce i used an alternate version, where i added 1 tsp lemon juice I clove garlic some parsly and cilantro to the sauce. YUmmy this is my "midnight" snack lol

We had this for dinner a couple of nights ago and are already planning to make it again. Followed the recipe exactly, but cooked it in the oven on a lightly oiled pan and brushed it with olive oil at each turn. After dinner and the next morning we just ate them cold out of hand! Overall, this is a delicious, easy to prepare, inexpensive and still very interesting meal.

Great quick and easy meal.
Instead of making the cucumber sauce I use creamy cucumber salad dressing.

Delicious!!  I have had better sauce, but it still tasted good when tasted together with the falafel and some feta and lettuce in a pita.  I pan fried mine and it does soak up a lot of oil. I'll try baking next time to see the difference in flavor. Edited:1/22/09= This time I used the food processor for the chickpeas, formed them into balls and did not flatten them.  Deep fried them, and they did not get greasy at all, nor did they fall apart.  Perfect!

This was good served in a pita with sunflower sprouts and tomato, but the falafel by itself was just so-so. I baked it, but it was the flavor that wasn't right. I thought the cumin was too heavy, and it could have used more garlic and maybe even a bit of tahini (I don't know exactly what was missing; it just didn't taste nearly as good as others I've had). I used Greek yogurt for the sauce, and it had a nice flavor, but it tasted much better before I added the mayo.

Very good! I used 1/2 of a large onion, and a few tablespoons of dried parsley. I had to add an extra egg for moisture, and still only used 1 cup of bread crumbs. 
My only complaint is that this was pretty salty. Since the beans are already salty, I will omit the added salt next time.

Great recipe!  Both kids (4 & 2) ate it with a different Tzatziki sauce from this site, stuffed into Peppy's pita bread recipe. Wonderful!
My only alterations were I used maybe 1/3 cup cilantro instead of the parsley (none at the store) and I baked them for 20 min., then broiled for 2 min/side. I also mashed the beans with my pastry blender, which was quick and easy.

i really liked the falafel - the only changes i made were i didn't add the ground coriander (didn't have any) and i baked it instead of fried it - but i didn't really care for the cucumber sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I baked them for about 30 min instead of frying them. They had great flavor and great texture. The cucumber sauce was okay, but it was a nice compliment with the falafel.

For my first falafel recipe this was good...and even though they tasted good, I was really disappointed with the LONG preparation time for this one. I found myself mashing the beans for some time...though I can admit that I didnt need to mince the onions as finely as I did.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I served it with a hummus and this site's Crisscross Salad (made without cheddar... add feta instead with a touch of Greek dressing). Was a great meal!

i gave this 3 stars because i wasn't a fan of the sauce. Let me state, however, that i'm not a big yogurt person, but I figured i'd try it.  Note to those other non-yogurt lovers---I ended up added a little shredded cheese (melted) on these and topping with a little sour cream.  My husband liked the sauce so he ate it.  

I make something like these with black eyed peas...might want to use the same recipe (minus the evoo in the mix) with them for a change.  

I will make these again. Thanks.

Falafel, not so much.  Tzatziki sauce, very good.  So, we tried to make the falafel, and it just didn't work.  Even though a small part of it not working was us doing it on the George Foreman Grill (as one reviewer suggested) to cook, the taste was what killed it.  It wasn't horrible, but it tasted more like a fake Stove Top Stuffing than it did actual falafel.  Wasn't our cup of tea.  However, we did make the Tzatziki sauce, and it was wonderful.  I will use the abundance of leftovers (we made more than just a 6 oz cup of yogurt) with Gyros tomorrow.

This is a great falafel recipe. I baked instead of frying, and they were great. I shredded my cucumber instead of chopping and added just a little lemon juice to the sauce. Served in pita pockets, so good!

This is the first falafel recipe I have tried, and it turned out great! I've made a few changes to it, such as omitting the egg, using 1/4-1/2 C flour instead of the bread crumbs, using cilantro instead of parsley, etc. It still tastes delicious! I've found that a happy medium between deep-frying and baking it is to pan-fry the falafel. I heat 1 or 2 T olive oil on medium heat in a skillet, then spoon a small amount of falafel into the oil and gently press it flat with the back of a spoon. This way, there's the flavor and crunch of deep-frying it, but with much less fat and effort. Great recipe!

Wow!  This was delicious.  After reading so many great reviews today, I couldn't wait to make it.  I didn't have any coriander but it didn't matter.  I used half parsley and half cilantro.  I cut the salt to about 3/4 teaspoon since many said it was a bit salty.  I used a little more bread crumbs.  I didn't have all of the ingredients for the dip but followed another's advice and used sour cream.  I used the mayo, salt, pepper, cucumber and a little chopped cilantro and it was very good.  I baked the falafel as others suggested and after taking them out of the oven, I fried them for a minute in some olive oil.  I never liked falafel much because it was always so dry, until I ate at a Jerusalem restaurant while vacationing in Toronto, Ontario last week and they were delicious. I've been wanting some ever since.  I see how these can become addictive.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I didn't use the cucumber sauce from this recipe, instead I used Tzatziki found on this site. The falafels held together well even though I baked them. The mix of flavors was outstanding. I might use the combination to spice up our burgers.

Not only was this recipe easy, but these falafels are probably the best I've had.  I must say that my onion must've been a juicy one, because I had to use almost a cup and a half of breadcrumbs to get the right consistency for the mix.  Just a suggestion:  I used the other half of the cucumber (seeded) and chopped it into quarter-inch pieces, sliced a tomato into wedges and mixed about a quarter teaspoon of the dillweed and added that to our falafel pita.  Very nice cold and crisp bite to compliment the warm falafels.

Very good... Make the cucumber sauce first so the flavors have time to set before serving.  We baked the falafel patties to reduce the fat and it was wonderful.

These were great! I've never had falafel before and I really liked it! The only changes I made were that I did not use coriander, because I dont have any, and no peppers, because I dont like it. Also I did not make the sauce because I already had some from Trader Joes. So yummy! Will make again!

Great recipe! I made the cucumber sauce first, as others suggested, and it was really good. Probably will make more of the sauce next time because everyone used quite a bit. For the patties, I browned them in a skillet with olive oil spray and then baked them at 375F. for 20 min., flipping after 10 min. They were great this way, although a little more crumbly than if they had been fried. My family loved these so I know I'll be making them again. Thanks Sean!

Can't get enough of this! I haven't tried baking yet, but will next time. Takes a lot of time to fry all(I don't have a good big pan) and makes a bit of a mess.

I doubled this recipe and I will say the falafel itself turned out great (except the last few fell apart, maybe form sitting out longer?)

The sauce was very good but I wish it was a little more tangy, it was a little too sweet for me but the cucumbers and dill were great.

The prep time on this recipe is totally off though, it took me about 2 hours to make these from beginning to end! Granted, I doubled the recipe but I did not expect it to take so long.

Overall the falafel was very tasty and had good flavor but definitely count on at least an hour and a half to make this  if you make the amount the recipe indicates, longer if you make more.

I was shocked at how good this was! I used half an onion, no parsley, 1 tsp garlic powder, ½ tsp cumin, no coriander, and I followed the rest. I served it with rice and salad. It was really good! The falafel was awesome! Our four-year-old helped mash the chickpeas with a potato masher and then she scarfed two patties! The sauce was excellent, I added a little extra dill. What a great way to eat healthier! Thanks for sharing, Sean!

This is our favorite falafel recipe!  It's not too time consuming either, if you have a food processor!  I like to used green onion in place of other onions for a more herby flavor.  Yum!

The flavor was pretty good.  However, like other reviewers, the first batch was fine, then the subsequent batches fell apart.  The oil foamed up and all I had left was falafel crumbs.  Not sure what the problem was, but probably won't use this recipe again.

Best falafel recipe I've made (and I've made quite a few)  Make sure you smash up the chick peas - has a great texture.

I used club crackers instead of bread crumbs.  It really boosted the interest of the falafel.

I followed the recipe as stated except I pan fried them and didn't make the sauce as I didn't have dill so I just made tzatziki sauce II from this site. These weren't too difficult to make but I didn't think the end result was worth the effort, they were missing something in my opinion. Regardless it was a good meal. Thanks.

Great recipe overall but only 4 stars due to the sauce being too runny unless you sweat the cucumbers (grate the cucumber, place in a bowl, sprinkling salt all over the cucumber and let sit for 30 minutes, then drain the water from the bowl and squeeze extra water out of cucumber).  I also felt the sauce needed a bit of garlic and the falafels needed a bit of curry powder.

This was SOOO good!  Yummy!  I'm a bit of a novice at pan frying things, but I was trying to follow the recipe exactly, so I did it that way.  I think I would have been more successful with the oven method.  Even though mine weren't the best looking falafels (due to my frying skills) they tasted GREAT!  Oh, and the sauce was spot on!  Will definitely make again (in the oven).

Good, but definately not the best. Mine turned out a bit bland and some of my patties fell apart after sitting uncooked while the first ones were cooking. I used dried beans, and they were a pain to mash. I think the canned beans would have been easier and less time consuming. I think i will stick to the powdered falafel mix because this took a lot of time and was messy. The sauce was killer though.

This is the best falafel I have ever tasted, to be quite honest. It was unbelievably simple to put together, and it tasted great. I didn't make the sauce, though. I made tahini sauce instead, since I'm not a big fan of cucumber.

This recipe was fantastic! These were some of the moistest falafel I ever had, it was a huge hit.  One word of warning -- maybe no one else is as silly as I am to throw the parsley in the blender with the onion and garlic -- but it turned my falafel green! (Maybe I threw too much in, I don't know.)  Either way... just a word of warning, I mean, unless you want to serve green falafel.  These were fantastic though!  Thank you so much!

Great falafel! I omitted the mayo from the yogurt sauce, and made it the night before.  Very tasty. Also baked the patties in a 425 degree oven on a lightly oiled pan. Don't be afraid to use the quantity of spices listed in the recipe, because the chickpeas will taste bland without it. Love this! Will be making it often!

I've come to allrecipes for years, but never signed up until today...this falafel is absolutely FABULOUS, the best I've ever had! 

I didn't blend the onion, etc because I like mine to be chunky, and it still turned out flawless.

This recipe was a tad time consuming, and it made a large amount of falafels-- almost too many for our family to consume. I made around 20 or 25 patties, made the baking powder to baking soda change, fried my falafels (then baked the leftovers the next day to heat up; they were actually better with a bit of crunch), and dipped it in a simple yogurt sauce that used the plain store bought yogurt, a dash of salt, a dash of pepper, and a tiny bit of lemon juice (I didn't have cucumbers). The taste of the actual falafel was a bit bland, but that could have been my fault; I added only half of a small onion, and 1/2 tsp of salt. I added a tiny bit of curry powder as well, and used penko (japanese) bread crumbs instead of the regular (which we didn't have either). All in all, I might make it again, but I think I'd go to a restaurant first before I invest all my time in making this dish again.

These were great!  I used a sauce with mint, but loved the falafel.  I baked them at 425 for about half an hour and they were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

Wow.  Excellent recipe.  I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking, so I was shocked when I made this and it tasted almost exactly like the falafels I buy.  Next time, though, I'll use less salt.  Also, my falafels looked more green than brown, so maybe I'll use less parsley.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was my first attempt at falafels, and it was very successful!  I baked them instead of frying, and they browned nicely, with the outside crunchy and the inside somewhat soft.  Next time I will cut the salt in half, but I wouldn't change anything else.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I will never use the instant stuff again!  This recipe is very easy to make and tastes wonderful.  My husband is allergic to yogurt so as a Texas twist to this dish we eats it with our favorite Ranch dressing.  The cucumber dressing included with the recipe is also tasty. :)

OMG Sean!! This is sooo delicious. I only made a few changes: used just 1 tsp of cumin, I baked on a preheated pizza stone in a 425 oven for 10 minutes, then flipped them and baked for 5 more minutes, and i made probably 12 smaller patties instead of the 8 bigger ones to keep them together better. This is going to be a regular in our house!!

This was a great recipe. I've tried several different ones. I found this one to have the best seasoning so far. And my roommate who is pretty sensitive to onions and such even had seconds!! My only complaint would be that it was a little mushier than I like (may be my fault). I did end up making 16 or so small patties and found it fed 5 people with leftovers for one more.
I didn't make the cucumber sauce because I already have a tzatziki sauce that I like.

Mmmmm, the falafel were yummy. I'm at a loss as to how anyone could screw this recipe up. I browned them first and then baked them for an extra 10 minutes - so they weren't raw inside.  I ended up with 20 and served them as a side dish with greek salad and souvlaki.  As for the cucumber sauce (tzatziki) - it really needs a clove of garlic squeezed into it.

It should be 4 stars as the recipe does contain the afore mentioned powder vs.soda discrepency but this is so easy and so tasty I give it 5 stars. Will certainly make it again.

I have made this recipe twice now and the first time we weren't very impressed. The second time I made them I was blown away - I used the exact ingredients the recipe calls for both times, but the second time, I made much smaller falafel patties and made sure my oil was very hot before I put them in. They were so good, they haunt my dreams at night.

I made my own falafel recipe, but used this cucumber sauce.  Very yummy!  The second night, we used barbeque sauce instead - which was also yummy.

Yummy, my meat-eating husband loved this!  I did make some changes, though.  I cut the cumin to only 1 teaspoon (just because I don't like it enough to put 2 teaspoons in anything) and I didn't use any coriander.  Instead, I used a teaspoon of curry because we had the best falafel of our lives from a street vendor in New York and it had a curry flavor.  I was very, very satisfied with those changes.  We liked the sauce but next time I'll reduce the amount of dill.

(Update 3/3/10)  I've made this several times and I now just follow the recipe exactly.  Everyone who ever eats it loves it.  The process can be kind of time-consuming so I buy one of those huge cans of garbanzo beans from Costco (sounds ridiculous, I know, but they only cost $2.76), make a HUGE batch and then freeze it in meal-size portions.  That way we can have awesome falafel all the time and I don't have to "gear up" for making it.  It freezes great.

Very good, tried both baking and frying and preferred pan-frying with a little oil. If you do not like chick peas you will not like this, my boyfriend is such a meat eater. He does not like falafel though, oh well more for me!

I tried frying a couple of these but they fell completely apart. I ended up baking then in the oven and they came out pretty good but a bit dry, luckily I had the sauce which was very good by the way. I gave it 4 stars only because it is a little time consuming for the end result.

Awesome recipe! (only tried the falafel) I tried them baked and pan fried, I definitely liked the pan fried better, they end up crispy on the outside and moist inside. Once baked they ended up mostly dry. Could be my oven or the way I baked them though. I've gotten great compliments and thumbs up for this falafel recipe! Thanks!

The only changes I made were to use coriander seeds instead of ground coriander and to use 1 tsp of cumin instead of 2 tsp. I also baked the patties. The patties were okay but the flavor was lacking and bland. The patties tasted slightly better with the yogurt dip but that that much better. I don't know if frying the patties would have helped, but I probably won't make this again.

This is a pretty good recipe. I thought I had parsley, but all I had was cilantro. It was very good with it, so I might try doing a mixture of both next time. The sauce was okay. Not sure if I would make it again; I prefer a garlicky sauce. Overall, a good meal. Make sure that you use thick pitas for the falafel; the pitas I had were thin and fell apart. (It was a tasty mess though.)

There aren't any Falafel restaurants near me but now that doesn't matter!  This recipe is very easy and makes the best falafel C=:-)

I made a couple of personal preference changes, a little less salt and onion.  I also made twice as much of the delicious cucumber sauce.

I never knew how easy it was to make middle eastern food at home - this recipe was great and easy! I (gently) used my food processer for the chickpeas - I tried mashing them, but it was tough! I pan-fried the patties on both sides for a couple of minute before baking them at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. Served it up with some tomatoes, cucumbers, hummus, pita and tabboulleh for a great meal :)

Wow!  So good and so easy.  I made these for a middleastern dinner party where one of my guests was vegetarian and I was serving lamb so I had to come up with a veg dish. Everyone wanted to try them and they all commented how moist they were.  I didn't serve them with the cucumber sauce (which I'll try next time) instead I served a persian yogurt sauce which went nicely.  By far the best falafel I've ever had.

This recipe is awesome!  They came out perfect.  My boyfriend said that they are as good as the one's from this resturant we go to.  I loved the cucumber dill sauce, but my boyfriend is loyal to hommus.  So he piled that on instead.  Loved it!  Would totally reccommend it to anyone!

A nice easy recipe - we really enjoyed this served with a green salad and hummus.  Next time, I may add more cumin and/or corriander (personal preference).

We eat falafel from time to time and this is an outstanding recipe. I prefer shredding the cucumber and squeezing out the excess water for the sauce. Throw in some hummus & tabouli and you have an awesome meal.

Other than substituting coriander for dill, I don't change a thing and it is a hit every time even with company.

I had never had a falafel before so I didn't know what to expect but this was very yummy!  I used a lot less oil and they did fall apart a bit but that was ok since I wanted them broke apart a bit when put in the pita.  The sauce was really good to and I will be using the rest of it for salad dressing.  I can't wait to make these again.  Such wonderful flavor!

I tried this recipe, because it had many great reviews.  Unfortunately, it didn't work too well for me.  I followed the recipe word for word.  However, the batch turned out to be too watery.  I added more bread crumbs to soak it up and hold it together.  But by doing that, it became more like bread crumb patties than falafel, and it lost a lot of flavor. Next time, maybe I will use dried chickpeas instead of canned, double the spices, and add one more egg than using more bread crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe though.

Yum!! This is a really awesome falafel recipe-I seriously could not stop eating them! Like many other who left a review I did not have any coriander on hand, which would have been wonderful, so left it out and it was still really great.

Falafels vary in flavor, depending on the region of cuisine (Israeli, Greek, Lebanese). I'm no expert, but my son, who fell in love with the fresh falafels made by immigrants in New York, was very happy with this rendition. A greek chef once told me that when making the tzatziki sauce, it is important to shred the cucumber, very lightly salt it and drain it in a cloth, squeezing out and discarding the liquid. This way the sauce won't get watery. The flavor was really nice and I will definitely keep this one in my files. Thanks!

Fabulous!  Tasted just as good as any i've had anywhere.  Only change, didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed crackers. Next time will reduce the amount of oil-mixture was very sticky and difficult to form, placed mixture in the freezer for a few minutes then fried, will try baking them-too greasy.  Served on whole wheat pita bread, hummus, lettuce , tomato and store bought cucumber sauce. Will make again.

I have not made the cuke sauce just yet, but these falafel are great.  I bake them at 400 degrees in a toaster oven 7 minutes to a side.  Quick and easy to make, really!

This is a great falafel recipe.  I am Lebanese, so I'm quite picky when it comes to authentic Lebanese dishes.  This one is pretty darn close. I tried them both fried and baked, and I have to say that fried is MUCH better. When I baked them they lost some flavor and tasted dry. The cucumber sauce was pretty good too.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used a food processor and mixed the garlic, onion and parsley until smooth and then added the chick peas. I used the pulse setting as to not make it too smooth and it worked perfect. I took the advice to bake instead of fry and they were great! We aren't dill fans so we skipped the sauce and topped them with fresh spinach leaves, spicy red pepper hummus and tater tots. When my husband had them in Israel he had them topped with fries and loved it. I doubled the recipe and froze half of it. I also left out the coriander and didn't miss it. Great recipe, I will definitely make again!

Tastes great, especially with lots of cucumber sauce. This is a great vegetarian alternative to burgers. The only problem I had was that I had some trouble getting the patties to stick together, even with lots of breadcrumbs. And the breadcrumbs seemed to overpower the taste of the chickpeas slightly.

Really, really good. I did not use the egg or baking powder as they seemed unneccesary.  Baked them in the oven at 425 for 12 mins per side.  I served with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, hummus and store bought tzatziki.

Falafel perfection.  I made them into little balls and fried them up.  Served it on warm, whole wheat pita's with lots of fresh tomato, and the cucumber dill sauce, which I used a whole cucumber for.  SO GOOD!!!! I was craving falafel and this really did it!  Thanks so much for an awsome recipe..

This was delicious!  I needed to add an extra egg to help it bind better, but other than that I made no changes.  I had never had falafel before but I cannot imagine it getting better than this.  I served it with tzatziki sauce instead because I happened to have some I needed to use up.  YUMMY!!

This was sooo good!! I won't be buying falafel anymore! Even my husband loved it, and he claims to hate chick peas.  I did add a little more cayenne pepper since we like spicy, so the cucumber sauce was a delicious balance. Thanks Sean!

This recipe is great! I followed it to the letter, except I changed the baking powder for soda as another reviewer recommended, and I doubled the cucumber sauce. Served it with Tabbouleh III and Real Hummus from this site, along with pita chips. I was worried my "Meat and Potatoes" husband would turn his nose up, but he loved it as well! Next time I might throw the chickpeas in the food processor for a light chop, (I had my son taking turns with me to get them smashed up). I can't wait to make this again! Thanks Sean!

Thank you, Sean! This is the best falafel I've had since I used to buy it from the street vendors in Jerusalem! I like to stuff some fries in with the other good stuff, the way I learned to get it from the vendors.

Excellent!! I added chopped cilantro (very fine--I put it in the blender with the onion and the egg/oil mixture) and also added two tablespoons of peanut butter, which added to the flavor!  I baked, as many suggested, on a baking sheet with a bit of olive oil.  Turned out crispy and delicious.

Added cilantro to falafel dough and substituted cilantro for dill in the cucumber sauce. Excellent! Due to my lack of culinary skills, had some problems frying the falafels. Found it worked best frying no more than 2 at a time.

Follow this recipe exactly and you will not be dissapointed.  I did not care of the Cucumber Sauce, so I found a tahini sauce that was perfect!  It's easy: 1/4 c tahini paste, 1/4 water and 2 T fresh lemon juice.  Mix with a fork and pour on the falafel -- wonderful!!!!

This recipe rocks! I made is just like it is, and I was so impressed with the taste and texture. It's better than some food stands I have been to. I made the sauce to go with it as well, along with hummus to spread in the pita. This recipe is a keeper!

This is awsome. kids don't even realised that they are eating beans!! I didn't use can of Garbanzo, instead I soaked dry beans for few hours, and then processed in a blender,added onions, Cilantro and garlic. That gave a very good texture. baked them instead of frying. kept sauce, pattice,Tomatoes, lettuce and hummus ready. When we were seating down for dinner, I warmed up the pita bread, added layer of hummus and sauce. I made small pieces of pettice, so it will be easier to fillin Pita and eat. In a small saucepan I warmed pieces of pettice, tomatoes and lettuce for 30 seconds, fill in Pita and served.  It was a great meal.

I changed the recipe a little and these turned out really good. Instead of bread crumbs I used Fiber One crumbs, 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg and left out the T of oil. I baked half of them and lightly pan fried the other half. They fell apart a little, but were still tasty. I didn't try the sauce, but everyone said the sauce made the dish.

Who knew making falafel could be so easy!  My falafels stayed together nicely and the flavor was good.  Next time though I will cut back a little on the salt and parsley, and definitely cut back on the amount of oil.  Or maybe I will bake them in the oven as others have suggested.  It was just too greasy cooked in an inch of oil.  As for the sauce, I really liked the mild cool cucumber flavor.  My husband however missed the tahini sauce often served with falafel.  I will definitely make again... I will just have to make a few minor modifications and I may even try adding a little tahini to the cucumber sauce.

This falafel came out amazing.  I couldnt've asked for anything more from the falafel itself.    The sauce was so-so and I think I will try to find something else to match with this.  But the falafels were ace.  8 big crisp balls served in a pita with shredded lettuce, sliced onion, and grape tomatoes.  Giving it 4 stars for the so-so sauce.

Once I discovered a sharp edged pastry cutter was the ideal tool to mash those pesky chickpeas--the recipe assembly was pretty effortless.  I have to say that this is so much better than any falafel I've ever had from any eatery.  I'm totally impressed.  The only thing that I may change the next time around is to add a bit more cayenne pepper--but that's just my personal preference and not a reflection of this totally awesome recipe!  Thanks ever so much for sharing this one!

These are fantastic, and i have made them many times. I have added refinements as follows:
1. I always use the food processor with no texture problems.
2. I double the recipe (my son is a food processing plant) and just cut back on the spices/bread crumbs a wee bit.
3. I fry the falafels but remove them to a 300-degree oven until mealtime, which and an extra crispiness. 4. To the sauce I also add a large tablespoon of tahini, a large stalk of celery, extra mayonnaise for a rich taste, and seasoned salt (Herbavore).
5. Serve with Greek salad, saffron rice, pita bread, and sour pickles.
6. I break up the (few) falafel leftovers over a salad for lunch and use the sauce as dressing!
YUM

I first tried this in Jan 06--after talking my husband into going vegetarian for 2 weeks.  He was horrified that it contained chickpeas but I made the recipe & it has seriously become a staple in our house.  :)  I quadruple the recipe, though, because I have a husband & 2 boys to feed so I use 4 cans of chickpeas......YUMMY!  Anyway, I don't always have the listed spices onhand so I improvise.

This is a very tasty recipe with a strong smell that filled my apartment for days!  It's rare that I can feed my husband a vegetarian dinner that satisfies him, but he liked this.  The dill sauce is absolutely fabulous and gets 5 stars.  I only gave the falafel 4 stars because it fell apart when I fried it.  I think it'll stay in one piece if I bake it, but then I'm not sure if my husband will like it as much.  I tried refrigerating the patties before frying them, but that didn't fix the problem.

My boyfriend loved this.  I thought it was pretty good, but in spite of using only 3/4 of a small onion, I thought it was wa-ay too oniony.  It pays to be careful while slowly adding the breadcrumbs if you don't want the patties to crumble.  I made the cucumber sauce with fat free Greek yogurt and it was awesome.  Next time I may have to double the sauce.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the mixture wouldn't firm up into patties. So, although it tasted okay, it didn't look good. Probably won't make again.

These were great. After reading another review, I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes to cut the fat content, but did everything else according to recipe. They were delicious fresh and leftover.

Excellent recipe, the dill sauce is key to making the falafel recipe come together.  Minor changes--  i used reduced sodium garbanzo beans, and I halved the amount of salt.  No reason to use more salt than you need.  Also, I added extra garlic clove, and gave the mix a dusting of garlic powder (we love garlic).  Very very tasty recipe, and one that I like to make regularly.

My husband and I loved this.  We've made falafel from a box mix before and we'll never go back now.  We add some thin sliced tomatos and feta cheeze to the pita and it's awesome.  We also added more cucumber to the sauce and a little lemon juice.  Looking forward to trying the baked tips next.

Both the falafel and sauce were amazing! I don't have a food processor, so I could not make the onions, garlic and parsley as small as it calls for, so the larger pieces of onion made the balls fall apart in the pan, but for the most part they stayed together. I used multigrain wraps, spread the cucumber sauce and some hummus on it and put some lettuce. SO GOOD.

These were one of the best falafels I've ever had! I've often had this sauce at middle eastern and Afghani restaurants and always wanted to know how to make it.  Loved it!  Also, I didn't use a cup of bread crumbs (that would have dried them out), instead I used 2 tablespoons of flour.  I didn't have dill or parsley, either...everything turned out really well w/o them. For those wanting to reduce carbs, this is what I did the 2nd time: take out the pita. I made a salad with chopped up cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce.  I then made several miniature falafels.  I used the cucumber sauce (w/ nonfat yogurt & low fat Hellman's mayo) as salad dressing, and had the tiny, crunchy falafel balls as croutons!  Soooo good.

This was okay.  I was expecting something stellar, but alas, it wasn't.  I feel awful to say that I actually prefer some of the stuff you can get in a box to this particular recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but these completely fell apart when cooking, as both balls and patties.  I was able to salvage enough for one small patty each for three people by coating each one in a large amount of flour and pan-frying in barely any oil.  Beside the falling apart, I also didn't find the taste quite right, definitely not as good as those in restaurants.  The texture was okay, but I'm going to look for a different recipe, or try to adjust the spicing and bake these if I try them again.  I didn't try the cucumber sauce - I make my own that I prefer.  One last note - the baking powder seems to cause foaming in the oil and could make for a dangerous situation - I would only put it in if you're baking it.

Very good- very similar to the popular local falafel joint that's been in business for many years.  I really like to load up on condiments when I have falafels, so make sure to have plenty of the cucumber sauce, I can't take a bite without tons of it on.  and lots of tomatoes.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought they could be slightly smoother in texture and stick together better.  But I never thought they could be homemade so well on the first try.

Awesome!  I used cooked & mashed lentils in place of chickpeas, added a pinch of turmeric, a little curry powder, quite a bit of finely minced cilantro, and a generous sprinkling of red pepper flakes to spice 'em up.  A total hit in my hosue, definitely will make again.  Thanks!

SOOOOooooo good!  I made the additon of adding cilantro the mx and it was fantastic.  Served them in a pita w/chopped lett., tom., onion and a drizzle of tahini.  Reminded me of Mamoun's falafel in NYC- might have even been better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Growing up with a mother that was from the depression era. She could cook great dishes with inexpensive foods. Thats how I felt when I made this recipe. It was Delicious considering the ingredients. Thanks for the recipe, worth my time to see how the other side( of the world ) eats.

Doubled the batch and made these in advance for a camping trip. Flash froze them so they wouldn't stick together, then put into freezer zip locks. Then it rained, so we ended up staying home and having our fellow campers over for dinner. There were 8 of us, so the double batch was absolutely necessary. You could make smaller balls with a single batch, but it really doesn't make very much. Sauce was good even though I'm not especially crazy about dill. I threw in a little white vinigar for more tangy flavor. Lemon juice would have worked well, too. I baked half and fried half. I had one of each in my pita and couldn't really tell the difference, especially once it's all doctored up with the sauce. My husband said that the baked ones were mushier than the fried. Someone suggested baking then flash frying for some crispiness. Served in pitas with tomatoes and sprouts. Overall a hit. Was definitely easier than expected. Will have the only two leftover balls for lunch today. Can't wait.

This is a very good recipe! I baked my falafels and they still tasted really good. The only other change I made is that I used some dried parsley instead of fresh because that is all I had. I used to buy falafel mix in a box but from now on I will use this recipe instead.

I've made this twice now.  As written, I would give this recipe a 5.  We tried baking it (other reviewers seemed to not mind it this way) the most recent time and it was tasteless and cardboard like.  Didn't even need the pitas!  Follow the recipe otherwise you'll find it very bland and not worth making.

These were awesome!  They took a little while to prepare, but it was well worth it. (My 21-month-old son insisted on "helping" me.)  I used home-canned garbanzos, so I didn't have any problems mashing them with a potato masher.  At the supper table, our son refused to eat his own (specially prepared) mashed potatoes in favor of  more (and more and more) falafel!  My husband was very enthusiastic about them too.

This is fabulous! Easy to make (make the cucumber sauce first and chill it while you make the falafel) and extremely safisfying to eat. Even my picky kids loved it.

I'm only rating the falafel as I didn't make the sauce (didn't have yogurt or even sour cream..), but this recipe is delicious.  I added an extra clove of garlic - 'cause I love garlic - and added the bread crumbs a little at a time, allowing the moisture to absorb (probably used about 3/4C total).  Made into flat-ish patties and baked.  Will make again since this was so easy to put together.  Thanks for the recipe.

i baked these after rolling them into balls. they were still a little soft, but the taste totally reminded me of summer camp, when every year the israeli scouts would come for a week and make falafel. this is a great recipe (but i did use another tzatziki recipe!). thanks!

These are great! I tried both methods of frying and baking in the oven, as a previous reviewer mentioned. Both ways are very delicious! The only thing I can say I didn't understand was how to make the parsley, onion and garlic smooth. My blender didn't quite get the right consistency. I ended up using a hand beater. Great blend of spices and flavor all around though.

This sounds like so much work, but it really is quite easy. As another review said, if my kid enjoys it... it's a hit!! I am anxious to try them baked, rather than fried. The sauce was good, but I've since found a mint yogurt sauce that we prefer to make with this. Thanks, Sean... I always keep garbanzo beans in the pantry now!

What a wonderful recipe! I used dried parsley, ground dill seed, and tried both patties and balls, I think I'd do the balls again. I still have to work on the consistancy but TASTY!! Definately a keeper!! Thanks!!!

This was a great homemade falafel - easy to make, though a messy cleanup.  I added more garlic - but we love garlic.  The sauce was ok.  Will definitely make again.

I finally successfully made falafel using this recipe!  (After three previous failures with other recipes.)  Fantastic.

I would only caution that the mix will still be slightly sticky when you're rolling it into balls.  I wouldn't add more than a cup of breadcrumbs or it will probably fall apart in the oil.

I listend to people's advice and only put in one teaspon of cumin. I also only used about 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs. They had no flavor. I felt like I was just eating fried bread crumbs. I suppose I should have gone with 2 tsp of cumin for extra flavor. Very bland!

This recipe seemed to be lacking something though I'm not sure what. Also it was a bit more mushy on the inside than I'm used to. Overall a good recipe to make when pantry is about bare.

Wow! My husband and I cannot believe how good this came out.  I did not use any cumin or coriander and I doubled or tripled the amount of fresh parsley.  I cooked them on a cast iron griddle pan with just a little olive oil.  Mine started out more on the wet side  -probably because of all the extra parsley, but it worked out great because they were moist and stayed good for days.  The sauce was really good too.

Very tasty.  I had a helluva time frying them (because I ran out of bread crumbs) but they were delicious anyway, and tasted remarkable authentic.  Beware trying to make this for large quantities of people, though--it gets tricky!

I loved this.  I made this to the recipe, frying half and baking half and both versions were excellent.

These falafels came out wonderfully and everyone loved them, along with the cucumber sauce!  I made them into small balls instead of patties and baked them at 400 degrees, 20 min each side like others had suggested.  They did burn a little on the outside, but still tasted fine.

These falafels come out salty and soggy inside, not fluffy like restaurant falafels no matter how long you fry them.  The cucumber sauce is good however.

Spices were great, but had a major breadcrumb taste.  Taking out the crumbs and egg helps a lot!  The sauce was a nice change from tahini, but i only used 1/4 t of dill.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made too much and froze the dough.  It perfectly thawed then cooked perfectly.  I cooked by own dried chick peas in the pressure cooker which made them very easy to mash by hand.

Very, very good! I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used cracker crumbs and it still came out fabulous.  I used the food processor to blend the onion, parsley and garlic.  I was a little nervous about putting in too much cracker crumb so they were not as firm as they could have been, next time I won't be so shy.  The cucumber sauce was perfect as well.  I'm sharing this one with my vegitarian friends.

Yummmmmm-E, with a capital "E". I used three cloves garlic (my preference). When my kid enjoys them, I know it's "Mission Accomplished". Yeah...they're green (parsley) going into the oil (I used canola to cut fat), but once browned -- after 2-3 min./side, turn carefully and keep an eye on them to avoid burning -- they're golden, crispy and delicious. Served sandwich-style on folded pita with shredded lettuce, thin sliced tomato, thin sliced red onion and the yogurt/cucumber sauce. I did substitute 2 T. fresh chopped dill for the dried. Why use dry when you can use fresh? Plus, it was cheaper. Also crushed a clove of garlic into the sauce for added flavor/bite. My friend even enjoyed the leftovers reheated the next day (350 for 10 minutes or so, then quick under the broiler to crisp again). Thanks, Sean, for demystfying a Middle Eastern treat.

Very delicious and authentic! I used my George Foreman Grill to cook them as another member suggested and they were great. I mashed the chickpeas with a potato masher, it was quite a task but made for a great final texture! Well worth the extra time and effort! Next time I might cut back on the cumin a little but other than that I can't wait to make again.

I've had this recipe in my box for a long time, but I've been very hesitant to make them.  I really thought this would be difficult to make as well as time consuming.  I was so wrong.  These were so easy and did not take much time at all.  To top it off, they were so delicious.  I will no doubt be making these on a regular basis, although I would love to learn how to bake them.  Thanks for the great recipe, Sean!!!

Everyone raved about this one.  I had to add quite a bit more than a cup of bread crumbs, and the beans didn't mash, so I ended up using the blender and adding olive oil helped.

Everyone gravitated towards this dish at a party. They absolutely LOVE the sauce and falafel balls which I think tastes just like the falafels you get here in NYC. This recipe needs NO changes.  I even had a fight with my uncle who hogged up too many servings and did not leave enough for others.  ;)

My first attempt at falafel...yay!  It was a little time-consuming, but well worth it.  1/2 cup of bread crumbs were enough to hold the patties together.  And I baked them at 400 for 20 minutes, flipping them over in between.  They were a little overcooked, so next time I will only bake them for 15 minutes.  Thanks for the keeper!

The falafel was great! (Can't comment on the sauce -- I didn't make it.)  So easy to make.  All the other recipes I found called for dry garbanzo beans, soaking them for hours, grinding them up, etc.  This one was fast and good.  I was a little concerned that the falafel would be greasy since they were fried but they weren't, they were great.  Even better the next day.  Two thumbs up!

This was a very easy recipe to make, and the falafel came out great.  However, I didn't have the ingredients for the cucumber sauce, so instead I spread mayo on the pita and sprinkled it with dill weed.  This tasted great and wasn't nearly as messy as the sauce would have been!

Very tastey.  Made A TON!!  Could have easily halfed the cucumber sauce and still had more than enough.  Cucumber sauce could double as veggie dip.  The falafel took some toying with to figure out how to fry it without it falling apart... but don't give up, it's possible!  You will want to lay it on a paper towel to drain some of the grease!

Outstanding!!!! I even munched on the leftover patties cold, without sauces or condiments, while watching TV!

I did process the whole batch in a processor for just a sec or two, to thouroghly mix, and did not at all affect the excelent dough quality.

Try one with ketsup, a slice of tomato, and a romain leaf on a hamburger bun.... good!!

The best falafels!  Even my hubby really liked them.  I would probably just buy tzatziki sauce next time (less work and tastier)

I made this in two batches - the first batch didn't fry properly and turned into a soggy mush, so I had to throw it out.  With the second batch, I dusted the falafel liberally with flour and also flattened them (I had made them round, as they are in restaurants).  Then I shallow-fried them.  They turned out great.  The sauce was really good too.  The only change I made was that I used coriander instead of parsley.  I think that's more authentic.

A lot of restaurants here also garnish falafel sandwiches with fried aubergine.  To do that, just cut a few half-inch thick slices of aubergine and sprinkle with salt and lemon juice.  Leave to rest for half and hour and then shallow fry.  These are really nice with falafel.

This recipe is outstanding.  The falafel's were full of flavor.  I sauteed the patties in Pam as one reviewer suggested, then baked in the oven for 30 minutes to reduce the fat.  Thank you Sean!

Very good.  I also made the pita from scratch.  This is very time-consuming recipe, in my opinion.

Nice flavor. The dill sauce is excellent. One suggestion: Don't use 2 eggs like some reviewers mentioned. Too much of an 'eggy' taste.

This is the best falafel ever! My husband and friends loved it. And the cucumber sauce is perfect with it - the only thing to remember is to make the sauce first so the flavours can mix. I just realized that I used fresh cilantro instead of fresh parsley (because I was distracted) - maybe that's what made it exceptional!

This was okay, but difficult to make. The oil needs to be VERY VERY hot before deep-frying. However, the cucumber sauce was absolutely excellent.

This is a tasty recipe, but not as spicy as I'd have hoped. If you like falafel with a lot of flavor, you might want to increase the garlic and cayenne. I'd make it again, but with modifications. It's a good place to start.

This is a great recipe for falafel.  If you have ever tasted the box mix falafel, You will find this one to be very fresh and delicious. I have served it to other fans of Middle Eastern food, and they agree that this recipe is excellent.  The cucumber dressing is a nice companion.

Oh my Gosh! This was a major disaster!!! 
My taste-buds are still suffering! 
The combination of flavors are all wrong and the flavors are way too intense.
It all took a long time to prepare,and I was very disapointed.
I let my little sis taste-test it...hoping that mabye she would like it and that it 
would not end up going to waste.  She rejected it as quickly as she put it in her mouth
"Tastes like DIRT!" was her exclamation.
I ended up chucking it all in the rubish :(

It ended up more like falafel soup.  Tasty, but dude, you need to figure out how to keep the patties bound.  It took a lot of paper towels to soak up the excess grease from the falafel crumbs floating about in my pan,

The taste was great! The mixture was still too wet and frying it broke down. So I think next time I will bake them because I resorted to frying on the skillet. That being said the taste was pretty good.

Mine also fell apart in the oil.  I added another egg as MM suggested.  These are very soft, and I miss the crunchy, firm, dense nuggets I used to enjoy at a Los Angeles restaurant!

Delicious-I used Greek yogurt and fresh dill and left out the mayo and salt and thought it tasted great! ... I also baked them and used parchment paper so I didn’t have to spray any oil.

Yum, yum! This will be part of our regulars! The only thing I will change is using a potato masher to crush the chick peas. Using a fork took forever!! Although my chick peas were still a bit as chunky, as was suggested in the recipe, they didn't stick together very well in the pan. I will try adding a bit more water next time.

Five stars on taste but like others, they crumbled to bits when frying so I transferred to a pan fry and, while still too crumbly (ended up with a falafel hash), the sauce was perfect and resulted in a pita full of flavor. Looking forward to leftovers!

I liked this meal. My BF not so much. The spices in the falafel are good. I had no problems with the patties breaking and I followed the recipe exactly. I did try half of them baked and half of them lightly fried. The baked ones were good. The fried ones were better. It’s like comparing potato chips. You know the baked ones are “better for you”, but the regular fried potato chips are just better tasting. The oven- baked patties needed the sauce. I found them kind of dry. 

The cucumber sauce was okay. I added more lemon to heighten the flavour a bit. I didn’t bother making my usual tzaziki sauce because I wanted to try this recipe and it included a cucumber sauce that doesn’t pretend to be  tzaziki. All in all this was good, but not overly delicious or remarkable. I may try this again, but not routinely. I think I will leave my real falafel fix to the Lebanese kiosk/store in the market of our nearest city.

You definetly need to add the bread crumbs or your patties will fall apart if you follow the recipe as is.    I used Near East Falafel mix as a filler instead of bread crumbs and I only used about 1/4 of the mix.  Didn't want to, but it worked.  These were delicious flavored, and the cucumber sauce was super good with fresh dill.    I'll keep this one.

I baked them 10 mins per side as another reviewer suggested and broiled them for 2 mins to crisp the patties up.  It worked great.  I couldn't find any dill at the store, so I used a cup of plain yogurt, the sliced cucumbers, and added a "dill dip seasoning packet" to make the tzatziki sauce.  I served it with a cucumber and grape tomato salad.

My family loved it. We had a light dinner of falafel, naan, and blueberries. I have a one and two year old! My husband has eaten nearly half the falafels. They didn’t fall apart and I made them exactly as directed. Will make these againZ

Great recipes!
This is the basis for all the “cucumber sauce” (tzatki?sp!) that I make with the surplus summer cucumbers. Falafel is good too. Thanks for sharing.

Flavour is fantastic and it’s very easy to make which is good for me! It was difficult to keep together once I put it in the oil. Maybe I did something wrong but they fell apart unless I made them tiny.

Really delicious!  I didn’t have ground coriander or fresh parsley, so I used cilantro instead, and baking soda instead of powder.  I prefer to use yogurt with garlic, salt, and cucumber instead of the dill sauce, but that was good, too.  Will try with flour as others have suggested!

When I started to put this together, I was a little timid with the seasoning. I made a test falafel and decided the mixture was a little bland so I added the rest of the seasonings that I left out. Success! I used my food processor on pulse to "mash" the chick peas and it worked perfectly.

Absolutely love this. Add breadcrumbs slowly at the end to reach desired texture. first time was very wet and needed more breadcrumbs, next time was a little drier. they don't need to fry for long before they are done. golden brown is enough.

I followed the recipe exactly, minus the coriander and lemon juice as I forgot to add those, they turned out amazingly well. I baked instead of frying, and I got a nice crunch to the outside. I am not really a fan of chickpeas, but I will definitely make these again.

The flavor was really good, the only problem was it kept falling apart in the oil. Next time I'll add more bread crumbs.

I’ve been making this recipe for years. Canadians take note that our cans are  19 oz. so you may want to pay around with your other ingredients. The main one being bread crumbs. You can also make the patties and store for a week in the fridge in waxed paper and pull them out as a quick last minute meal. Pair really well with Chef John’s pitas which are abother winner.

This is the best falafel recipe I've ever used. However, the prep and cook time is a  LIE. I'd say its 20 – 30 minutes prep, and 20 – 30 minutes cooking. I set aside a solid hour and a half to cook and eat these guys.

I have made this 4 or 5 times now.  Delicious every time!  The first time we used Panko crumbs and that didn't work out so well.  The Panko is too course and it won't hold together.  We had falafel crumble that evening!  Regular bread crumbs work much better.   My stomach is no longer able to handle onions, garlic or cayenne so tonight I used onion powder, garlic powder and skipped the cayenne.  Still delicious!  I have found that the easiest way to smash the chick peas is to use a rounded ladle to smash them in the bowl.

Like thew other reviewers, I did not want to deep fry. I fried them in just a little olive oil. They fell apart, but I simply let them and cooked until a little crispy. And, while I used a favorite tzatkiki recipe (also fromAllrecips), these were really delicious!

This was my first time making falafel and they turned out great. I followed these two suggestion from other reviewers: 

• I cut the amount of bread crumbs in half. 
• I sprayed a cookie sheet and the patties with vegetable oil spray and baked at 400 for 12 mins each side instead of frying.

I also pressed the falafel mix into a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scooped out with a spoon, and pressed them down well on the cookie sheet to get the patties all one size. I was able to make 9 patties using this method. 

I will definitely make them again!

I followed the recipe except for the bread crumbs.  Typically I substitute wheat germ which I process in a blender to bread crumb consistency.  After combining all the ingredients I let it rest in the fridge until I was ready to cook.  The falafel mixture became firm enough to form into balls and didn’t break apart when turning them over.  I also took the suggestion to bake instead fry.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe! Will make again. I only thing I didn’t measure was the salt. With the saltiness of the chick peas already I just sprinkled salt in the mix. Then I tested one falafel to adjust for salt later. Also the bread crumb amount was just about right, but probably varies with the amounts of liquid ingredients and eggs used.

Amazing! These are as good as any great Greek restaurant.

To note, 1) used Panko bread crumbs, and 2) got everything chopped, mixed kitchen aide mixer, then ran through the accompanying sausage maker.

For people with the issue of them falling apart in the oil, 1) after forming, be sure to chill in fridge for 30 minutes. It changes the consistency of the ball. Honestly, freezing them would be better than trying to cook them at room temperature, like good french fries. 2) Use an appropriate thermometer to ensure your oil is hot enough. If it isn't 350+ the oil will just soak in and destroy your balls instead of resisting as a result of the water content rapidly evaporating.

I did a last batch after eating and not only did the balls warm up, but I was lazy and didn't let the oil get all the way up to temperature. The first 3 batches were perfect, that last batch not so much. The good ones had a distinctly serious sizzle to them, the bad batch was lackluster.

Good luck!

Tl;dr chilled balls and properly hot oil temperature are critical to quality results.

Blame science.

The flavor of the falafel was great. After reading the reviews, I chose to use 1/4 cup flour instead of bread crumbs. I baked the patties on a pan greased with olive oil at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, turned them over and baked for another 10 minutes. They were golden and great. For the sauce. I do love sour cream but not a fan of yogurt. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt, added powered garlic and used English cucumbers (no peeling or seeding). I had corn tortillas to use up so that was my substitute for pita bread. My husband thought they were delicious.

My absolute favourite thing to make for school lunches. I serve them cold on a bed of couscous with sliced cherry tomatoes, shredded spinach, and tzatziki sauce and they are amazing. I tried baking them once and it was not the same at all - definitely fry them

No changes and I make it regularly. This is truly the best falafel I've ever had, including the world famous falafel place in Paris. Sean's Falafel wins hands down. We eat it in pita, on flatbread, or just on a bed of greens with feta dill dressing drizzled on top.

Very tasty. Hubs and I loved it as is. Tastes better than the prepackaged mix for sure. I doubled the recipe and froze the rest for later. Yuuum. Best thing to is instead of dry pita bread, I used Papa Pita’s Greek Pita flat bread. It’s softer and moister and tastes better.

Everything turned out beautifully! The falafel was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, and the cucumber dressing was the perfect addition.

I love this recipe. It is very simple and consistent. I have had issues with falafel disintegrating, but discovered that as long as I maintain an oil temperature between 350 and 375, it works perfectly every time. Much lower and the falafel fails to form a crust quickly enough and just disintegrates in the oil like my heart disintegrates in my chest while I helplessly watch.

We love this recipe. We don't use the food processor as we don't mind the chunks of onion in the mix. We also prefer to cook ours in the waffle maker. It is healthier than frying in oil and crispier than baking in the oven.

It is fabulous! I've made this for several friends and the reaction is always the same: OMG this is wonderful!!  The only change I made was to use plain almond and coconut milk yogurt for the cucumber sauce as I'm unable to eat dairy. No one even suspects!

Absolutely great falafel recipe! I also followed many wise and healthy reviews and baked them in the oven, they turn out yumm and still crispy without all the oil. I didn't change any ingredients (my chickpeas were cooked and well drained, therefore the egg was a must to make the falafel and avoid having a crumbly texture before baking). What a delicious way to enjoy falafel at home!

Will make again! Mashing with my masher was next to impossible, but getting in with my hands worked wonders. I fried for about 4 minutes per side.

A hit - I had to remove the cayenne pepper because my husband is allergic, so I doubled the lemon juice to compensate - still delicious.  The recipe is perfect, thank you!

The taste was good.  Mine fell apart, as others have said. Prep wasn't as simple as I usually like but may try again with some of the tips others have tried.

Wow, great recipe! I read all the reviews and made a few minor adjustments based on that information. I added more herbs, used 4 TBS flour and approx 1/2 c bread crumbs as binder, rolled in breadcrumbs and refrigerated 30 min before cooking. I used an air-fryer to cook (brushed patties with  bit of olive oil). I will definitely make again, make a double batch and freeze half ! Even the meat eater hubby approved :)

Fantastic recipe. Maybe a little more cayenne pepper for some added depth, but I also did not have any coriander, so that might’ve been what was missing. To keep it from falling apart in the oil, continue adding breadcrumbs until it is sticky in texture.

I made this tonight for my husband and five children, I was prepared for a battle with them turning their noses up at this new (to them) and meatless dish. Boy was I surprised when my pickiest eater took one bite and exclaimed how much he loved my cooking, half of my family even wanted seconds. This recipe was a big win in our house.

The taste was pretty good. Next time I'm going to bake them in the oven so they would be more crispy on the sides.

I did not have any coriander in the house so I went without it. I also did not follow the breadcrumb measurement. I added the bread crumbs until I got the consistency I desired, semi firm not cracking when smashed down. With the extra leftover bread crumbs I used them to coat the outside and gave it that extra crunch layer. The falafels came out great! I doubled the recipe which allowed me to make huge falafel cakes that worked great with my hamburger buns.  I will be making this again, but next time I will have coriander.

Great recipe!  I baked half the batch at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, flipping them after 10 minutes.  I pan-fried the other half with olive oil.  Both resulted in great falafels.  I only added 1 tablespoon of parsley instead of 1/2 cup, I cut the salt in half, and rolled each falafel in panko crumbs before baking/frying them.

These were ab-fab.  Whilst a couple of them did fall apart, those crispy bits added to the flavour.  I made them for me as a vegetarian dish, but the carnivores in my life stole my lunch for the next few days.  Made it as written.

I've made this a few times now and it's delicious!! I looove falafel but I am no chef, so I was pretty proud of this one. I used a potato masher and just did it all by hand. We prefer smaller patties, fried crunchy as possible. The last time I added more bread crumbs until they were less sticky, which made a less mushy finished texture. The flavors are right on! A little time consuming but now in my regular dinner rotation. Thank you!!

Delicious falafel! I made my own tzatziki sauce so I can't judge the sauce that they have listed with it, but the falafel was great. I didn't fry with as much oil as they recommended and used grape seed oil to cook other than that I stuck close to the recipe.

I've made this several times and it always turns out great. Last night I was out of parsely and coriander, so I subbed kale for the parsely (dipped in boiling water for thirty seconds to remove any bitterness) and used  fresh cilantro instead of coriander. Still delicious!

Wow! Delicious! Definitely going to be making this more often. Thank you for such a great recipe. I baked mine, oven 400f 10 minutes each side on sprayed cookie sheet. Lightly sprayed patties and placed under low broiler for two minutes each side. I swapped out the baking powder for baking soda. 
Yum Yum Yum!

Great taste. 
- I used baking soda instead of baking powder.
- Added one more garlic clove
- Do not blend in blender but do it by hand to help with it keeping together. 
- I refrigerated mixture over night for flavours to blend well. (can freeze the dough and use the next month)
- Use thick yogurt.

Did what others suggested by omitting egg and bread crumbs:
- when frying it all disintegrated and had to all be thrown out. 
- When baking, they did not hold together very well - had to be very careful with them. (Make sure to oil the dish well each time you flip them. 

For baking:
- Spray baking sheet and falafel
- Bake at 400-425* for 20 mins --> flip and spray again and bake for 8-10 mins.

Next time I will:
- try the egg and breadcrumbs as stated in recipe or use only flour as another person suggested. 
- Someone said use less breadcrumbs if any. 
- Make in balls and not in patties and see if that makes a difference. 
- possibly cover patties with breadcrumbs for a better texture. 
- Others say that it is tastier fried than baked.
- Someone suggested a handful of each fresh parsley and coriander.

Made these for dinner the other night and they turned out amazing...better than our local restaurants. I used them for leftovers at lunch, and they reheat well although they lose that crispiness, they still make a good sandwich. They weren't dry at all and had a perfect texture. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly (although I estimate instead of actually measure most things like spices). 

Only small change I made was using dill & chives in place of the parsley because I didn't have parsley on hand. I went based on feel for the bread crumbs (I think this is key)...so when I got just to the point that I was happy with the consistency, I  rolled the falafel into balls and fried them in hot oil--had no issues with them falling apart. 

These are a little bit of work because mashing the chickpeas takes some time to get the right texture. Next time I think I'll make a much larger batch and freeze.

Amazing!!! I baked them as suggested by one reviewer and they were so good. I would also recommend double or tripling the recipe for the yogurt sauce. One falafel fits in half of a pita bread bread, with sauce, tomato. Red onion would be good to, if you like onion. I also made the mistake of putting the chickpeas in the food processor however it turned out fine. Will be making again

The three others I made this recipe for loved it!  I didn't use any peppers nor coriander.  Also, my cucumber sauce didn't have mayonnaise & was chilled for over 1 hour.  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of the regular.  It was delicious & turned out just right!

I will make this again.  I thought I did very well following the recipe to the letter, but I did use a very small onion.

The mashing of beans for me, took a while.  I took a natural approach and mashed with a potato masher a while, and then my hands to break up any large bits.  My beans were coarse in parts and fine in parts, which I thought would make it hold its shape better... and later, it did.

I found the recipe very similar to a cookie recipe, where you start with dry and add wet, mix, and form into balls.  I made tablespoon full balls and I got my hands wet any time my hands got sticky.  Compact the heck out of those balls!  You don't want the hot oil pushing in the gaps.  I put the balls on waxed paper.  They looked like peanut butter cookies before you press them.  However, I like mine round, so I left them be.

It's very important you fry in the right temperature oil.  We have a stick thermometer for steaks we used to check 365 degrees.  We used a 12" cast iron skillet.  They will brown nicely and do not fall apart!  

I do not see any advantage to baking, and it's  my opinion that it's surplus carbs like bread, sodas, etc., not fat that builds fat on your body because carbs turn into fat stores depending how much surplus you have... I do not skimp on oils, especially healthy oils (canola is my go-to unflavored oil).

The end result is restaurant quality falafel, just as good as in any mid eastern restaurant.  I am pretty sure any Israeli or Jordanian friends of y

I replaced the bread crumbs with matzo meal (I have weird allergies) but followed the rest of recipe faithfully and my husband could not stop praising the falafels  and the cucumber sauce.  He said it was the best he'd ever eaten and he doesn't normally like the cucumber sauce that comes with falafel or gyros anywhere because it's too yogurty.  The texture of the falafels is much smoother than any mix or even restaurant makes.  He has asked that I make sure I never lose this recipe and to keep the ingredients always on hand in case of emergency falafel cravings.

These were great! Easy to make and quite tasty.

To make the chick pea mashing easier, I put the chick peas in my food processor and carefully pulsed them so I would break them up but not too much. 

I baked the falafel per another review's instructions (400 degrees. 10 minutes, flip, 10 more minutes). I also halved the bread crumbs.

Everyone enjoyed them. Would definitely make again and recommend to others. Next time I might add more in the way of spices just to kick it up a notch.

I LOVED this recipe! Only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is because this recipe is what I used as a starting point when I made falafel for my first time. I try to use the ingredients already in my cabinets when possible. I know my palate and I like to cook intuitively. These are my variations: I used panko bread crumbs, used my own premixed falafel spice blend (but still added the cayenne, salt & pepper), added 2 Tbsp tahini and 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds. I did not make the yogurt sauce because I already had my own recipe in mind (garlic-tahini sauce). I made some quick sweet pickles to garnish the falafel inside a pita. Finally, I made a simple dressing of lemon juice, mint and Za'atar to dress the salad which also went inside the pita wraps. This came out superb! It was among the best tasting falafel I've ever eaten, and I've tried it at many Middle Eastern restaurants. The best part is that I actually got 10 good sized falafel out of this recipe which fed myself and my boyfriend 2 nights in a row. I will definitely make this again sometime very  soon!

This was pretty good. The yogurt sauce is a little bland, but the falafel were great. I swapped the bread crumbs for coconut flour to lower the carb count, and it was delicious.

I'll preface the review with saying I did not fry the falafel as was in directions, but took the suggestion of making it healthier and baking at 400 degrees per another reviewer. That said, these left a very dry taste in my mouth, and trying to eat it with pita was a bit much. The cucumber sauce is phenomenal and a staple for any future greek recipes, but the falafel was mediocre at best.

This was the first time making and having falafel for me. These were a dish of delish! I only added the bread crumbs until the mixture held together but was still moist as suggested in one of the reviews. I would decrease the salt next time. Maybe I will try baking them in the oven next time too. Thank you for posting the recipe!

Pretty good! I used a different herb in the sauce because we're not fans of dill, and only used maybe half of the bread crumbs total. They turned out great.

I have made this  recipe  as written three times now and the falafels are outstanding!  Such an easy and great recipe. I have had no issue with them holding together. I think the secret is to let the falafel mixture sit in the fridge for at least a couple of hours before frying. This is what I have done each time with great success. My husband likes them better than the ones at the local Turkish restaurant  and my son "who doesn't like falafels"  loves them.

Great recipe!  As suggested by others, unused baking soda instead of powder and baked them for ten minutes a side at 400. I tried using a blender for the onion, parsley and garlic step, but found I needed to break out the food processor to do the job well. Will definitely make again!

This is the best recipe I have used for falafel! I did decide to bake and not fry. Everything came out great. The bottoms browned just a little and the patty held together nicely. I baked on parchment paper for 12-15 minutes at 400.

I only used half of an onion. Did not change anything else. Good consistency and they did not fall apart while frying I think because there was less moisture. Served with homemade pita, tzatziki, Greek vegetable salad, shredded cabbage, feta, and a splash of hot sauce. Awesome! Will definitely make again.

Uber easy and delicious.  Make a double batch and freeze the extra patties with wax paper separating them. They make a fantastic after school snack - just defrost for 1 minute in the microwave and cook as normal and your teenagers have a healthy snack to get them through. Keep a container of store-bought tzaziki sauce in the fridge.

Both the sauce and the falafels were delicious and a hit with my 3 kids (ages 4, 10 and 12). The falafels were pretty mild in flavor (I went easy on the cayenne), but tasty with the added cucumber sauce and tomatoes.

Beware of an addiction to this recipe. Fortunately, I soaked too many chickpeas and had to keep making Falafals for the next 4 days. The kids and I enjoyed this immensely. I even went to the Farmers Market and tried out the authentic version. His was good, but this recipe was way better.  I agree with another reviewer, double the recipe and it can sit in the fridge. Just ball it up, fry it up and nom nom.

This was AWESOME!  My picky kids even ate it.  I didn't make any alterations to the recipe whatsoever and this was my first time attempting to make falafel.  Seriously delish.

Very good. Followed some other people's advice. Added some flour to the mix because it was really soft but also added the breadcrumbs. Rolled in breadcrumbs after making them into a ball and before flattening them. Baked at 400 for 10 min each side then broiled for 2 min each side. Served in pita with a slice of tomato on top, some cucumber slices and some baby spinach. Added the cucumber sauce and it was delicious. I plan on making these again only hamburger size to put on a bun with the same toppings. I think that would be really good too. Thanks for a great vegetarian recipe that even my son and husband liked.

OMG! Sooo good! I copied the guy from the food network and made a falafel waffle. I brought it to work and my coworkers tore it up before lunch even began. Must try.

I made this and accidentally doubled the recipe. I think this needs more moisture. i added another egg to half the mixture and another tablespoon of olive oil. Perfect! Flavor wise it is A+. I added some lemon zest to the batch and doubled the garlic. Homemade tztatziki sauce served with tomato, cucumber and hot sauce.

I usually don't make recipes "as is"....I did this time. This recipe is OK. It isn't great. I'm not sure if it's the coriander or what but I feel like there is something missing....I'm won't be making this again.

i didn't care for this recipe.  I fallowed the directions to a T and it all fell apart in the oil. 
Also- "1 onion" is very subjective.

Delicious! I followed everything exactly for the recipe but put mine in the fridge for 15 minutes before frying to firm up slightly.  I used a small fry pan to cook, so the same amount of oil will slightly cover the entire patty. My family loved it! Thank you!

This recipe is great! I added a bit more cayenne and cumin because I wanted the falafel to be spicier. I also coated the balls in panko, sprayed with coconut oil cooking spray, and baked them instead of frying. They were crunchy and delicious.

The only changes I made was I added dill to the falafel mix because I love the taste of dill.  I also made the chick peas from dried because I don't use any canned items.  Wonderful recipe.  Everyone loves it.  Also, if you take the time to make the pitas yourself you will really have an amazing dish.  I also add fresh dill to my pita dough.

I have made this dish twice, once exactly as the recipe is written and another time with minor tweeks. The tweeks made a huge difference that we really preferred. We preferred using a food processor to more finely chop the garbanzos, I have never had falafel with noticeable chucks of garbanzo beans. I also was heavy with the spices and used more heaping measurements. I also used just under a cup of bread crumbs. Then, as we are not used to eating fried food, I heavily sprayed a pan and baked the falafel for a little over 20 minutes at 425 degrees. We also preferred eating them as a main course and not a sandwich. We will be making this often!

I have fried & baked the falafel; we prefer it baked. 
I add a least a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce, a little garlic & omit the mayo. The lemon gives it more of the flavor we get at Mediterranean restaurants. My husband will eat this sauce on just about anything. The sauce makes this dish.  (It's really good with rosemary chicken kabobs.)

Fun to make this international dish and have it turn out so well!  I did not have dill this time, but will add it next time to the sauce.   I did  not have a full amount of parsley, but added about a 1/4 cup which worked well, and I followed suggestions to switch from baking powder to baking soda.   Kids helped me to smash chick peas and mix ingredients and we were all pleased with results.  We will definitely make again!

We had these for dinner and they were good.  But then I reheated them the next day and filled the pita with lettuce, tomatoes, olives, pickles, and avocado (essential) and squirted in some mayo and plain yogurt.  Divine.

Made as written, and will make again without the egg or bread crumbs. Falael fell apart. I find it easiest to crush garbanzos in a food storage bag with a french rolling pin. Hope that helps someone else.

Yumilishious!! I only made the falafel part. not  the sauce. I am trying to avoid dairy. If you saute the onions and garlic first, this is delicious without cooking. I used it as a "sauce" and put it on a sweet potato.

We used this recipe to make falafel burgers (double the recipe made about 6 good size burgers). We baked in the oven as some other reviews suggested. The texture was good, but we felt like the cumin was over powering, and they were otherwise a bit bland. This might be because they were baked instead of fried, but we are trying to eat a little healthier. If we make them again we will definitely dial back the cumin and maybe add fresh cilantro or some other fresh veggie to boost the flavor.

Made a double batch of everything, and it turned out amazing. Definitely a huge hit and I will make it again soon.

I love this recipe!  I've made it a few times now. The only thing I do differently is that I do process the onions, garlic, and chickpeas in the food processor.  It comes out great every time!  Thanks for sharing!

Made these last night..... the we're excellent! Rather than frying them I baked them in the oven.  Lightly oiled a baking pan and baked them at 350 for 25 minutes.... flipping them once.  They were tender and stayed whole.

delicious falafels. even though the recipe says not to put the chickpeas in a blender, I still put them for a quick spin in a food processor... I couldn't be asked to smash them with a fork. :)

Absolutely fantastic - It turned out much like the falafel I had when living in Israel. I used dried, chopped onions instead and just added a little extra water to compensate. No problems with them falling apart.

Very tasty, but drydrydry. Thankfully, I forgot the bread crumbs or it would have been worse, but then the mixture didn't want to hold together so maybe not. 

Oodles of the cucumber sauce helped with the dryness. 

I will try this again.

My boyfriend is usually afraid of my vegetarian food (and onions), but he loved this as did I. I baked it according to a comment I found. (400 F 15min on side 15min the other) I wish I knew how to make them more moist because one fell apart on me when I flipped it. I also cut back on the dill for the cucumber sauce just because I am not a huge fan of it. It made 6 patties total.

I made it in the oven as recommended.  Came out good.  Was really hard to mash the peas but I did use dry chickpeas.  Will try it with the can peas to see if there is a difference

I've been using this recipe for a long time now and i make them in batches of 80 or so, freeze them, so handy after coming in after a day on the road, pop them in the oven, then drop them into a  wholemeal pitta add tomato, lettuce, onion and voila!!  It has never let me down.  

Just a note to anyone who is having issues with the falafel crumbling or falling apart : make sure the mixture is moist and the mixture is well pressed between both hands - making sure there is absolutely no air in the ball of mixture, making a ball a little smaller than a golf ball.  And to almost eradicate any breaking up or crumbling - bake the falafels, not to mention that they are healthier, you do not lose any of the flavours.  Enjoy.  Nobody, that i have made these for, didn't like them.  In fact, i'm getting a requests for them, from my mates!!

Good flavor, but I baked the falafel and it came out with no crunch at all. I was hoping for a crisp shell but instead I got a pasty bean patty. Next time I will reduce the bread crumbs and fry them instead.   Also, quick tip on the sauce: after you grate the cucumber, macerate it in some salt for about 10 mins to draw the juices out, then drain and squeeze the cucumber. The sauce will be much thicker and won't lose flavor or add too much salt (most of the salt drains off in the water)

Very good and easy recipe.  The only change I made was using 3Tbsp of flour instead of the bread crumbs.  But I baked the paties on 425 degrees oven for 20 minutes one side and 10 minutes another side.  Don't forget to brush oil on both sides. Thank you!

Very tasty, easy, and depending on how you make it, healthy! I baked instead of frying, as others suggested, and used panko breadcrumbs to cut  back on the calories and salt even further. The cucumber sauce is also wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was soooo delicious and so easy to make.  Made it along with the Quinoa Tabbouleh recipe from this site for dinner for my in-laws and they were quite impressed.  The only changes that I made were that I used fat free plain Greek yogurt instead of plain full fat and I baked the patties instead of fried.  Flavor was great and felt like we had a nice, healthy meal.

These were super good. I substituted and used green onion and Sriracha powder instead of cayenne because that's what I had. His tips on crushing the beans by hand but processing the garlic/onion/parsley into a paste was the key to it all. I think the paste helped bind the ingredients and kept these from becoming dry.

This was the best falafel I have tasted! This was my first time ever making falafels and they came out delicious. It was very light and moist. I did not expect that. For the cucumber sauce, I could not find plain soy yogurt, so I used vanilla and it still came out great. I am making this for my visiting friend this weekend!

I never made falafel before but this is a great recipe. Followed as is (with the exception of blending the yogurt dill sauce in the nutri bullet) and it was great. Will be making again.

Great tasting.  Be careful that you don't make these too big.  They will slightly expand while frying and you want the middle to get done

This was my first time making falafel and this recipe was quite easy to follow and the end product was quite good. The falafel itself was bursting with flavor and the sauce was on point.

Excellent recipe - I changed nothing! The portions were perfect. My picky 14 year old, who has never seen a falafel loved it. Thanks for sharing!

Wow these turned out great!  It was my first time making or eating falafel and my husband and I loved them.  The cucumber sauce was also lovely and went well with the falafel.  I would definitely make these again!

A great simple and healthy lunch item. I enjoyed it chilled on a hot day, but serving the falafel warm with cold sauce is also tasty.

Very tasty, but next time I think I will try baking them - I had problems with them falling apart in the fry pan.  I did add extra cucumber to the sauce, as well as a small clove of garlic and some lemon juice.  Also used a tablespoon of fresh dill instead of a teaspoon of dried. Very nice flavor!

Oh my goodness, Soooo good! We substituted ground pumpkin seeds for the bread crumbs and it turned out great! I highly recommend adding a clove of garlic to the sauce. Yum!

My mother and I thought this was delicious, but my husband and father thought it was okay. This coming from two major meat eaters LOL Like other reviewers, I added two cloves of minced garlic and more dill to the sauce. The "dough" came out quite runny, so setting up in the fridge for an hour or two is essential. I also brushed a baking sheet with olive oil, and then used an ice cream scoop to scoop out the patties and flattened with the back of the scoop. Baked on 425 for 15 minutes, flipped, and then baked another 10 minutes. The outcome was that the falafels were very dense and hearty. The sauce is very light and creamy. We stuffed pitas with sauce, baked patties, lettuce and tomato. YUMMY!

I followed the recipe for the flafel ,but without the dill weed, and it came out perfect.  I don't know where people get the idea to not use the baking soda.  It didn't cause any problems and almost every falafel recipe out there calls for it.  I used the Trader Joe's Tzatziki as my sauce.

We loved this recipe, both the falafel and the cucumber sauce were amazing. The only thing I changed was omitting the coriander, since we don't like it. The second time I made it, I gave in to temptation and used the food processor on the cucumber sauce. It lost most of its appeal, so I highly recommend not doing that. Definitely follow the directions on this one.

Great recipe for falafel.  I wound up using DEBNJAMES' recipe for tzatziki sauce instead of the one in this recipe, however.

This recipe was so easy and fast and my family loved it.  I am ashamed that I ever used the boxed mixes now that I know it is this easy.  I made the mix without the egg in the morning and it sat in the fridge all day.  When I got home from work, added the egg and fried them up.  I made 6 patties and my husband said next time to double the recipe so he can have leftovers!

Tried this recipe several years ago when catering a Mediterranean-themed vegetarian dinner for my church.  Loved it!  Added some minced garlic to my tzatziki (cucumber sauce).  This appetizer was a hit all the way around!

I have been looking for a good falafel recipe and this one is very good. The only thing I do different is instead of the cucumber sauce I use fresh cucumber and tomato. I also spread some hummus on the inside of the pita before assembling.

Some of the best falafel. Very close to my favorite restaurants falafel. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make. The sauce is basic but good. I like a cilantro lime sauce on my falafel. Thanks for this recipe!

I love this recipient as is, but a friend is gluten free and can't eat spicy foods. Substitute gluten free bread crumbs, easy. I eliminated the onion and all spices, instead use sweet potato and add extra eggs to get the right consistency. My friend loved it.

The only issue I had was blending the onion, parsley and garlic. I had to add the olive oil and lemon juice at this stage in the recipe to get the leafy stuff to stay at the bottom of the blender and, well, blend. Also, the recipe seems to warn about using too much bread crumbs, but that's wrong. You add bread crumbs until it becomes like a dough and can be handled without sticking to your hands too much. Other than that, this recipe gets 5 stars! NOTE: I baked mine to cut back on the fat. Really, really yummy!

I wish I'd heeded muslim mom's review before proceeding. The flavor was good (not great), but the patties completely fell apart in the oil. I ended up adding more bread crumbs and an additional egg, which necessitated adjusting the seasonings. Sigh.

I've made this falafel twice: once baked, once fried. Baked is good but fried is phenomenal. This recipe is on par with falafel I've had at restaurants in the Middle East. I followed muslim mom's review, using baking soda instead of powder and only need about a 1/3 of a cup of breadcrumbs to hold the mixture together. Thanks for this delicious recipe!!!!

I love falafel, and this was very good.  I recommend making the cucumber sauce, because it was really refreshing and added a lot.  I did not even skin or seed the cucumbers (because the skin is where most of the nutrients are).  I just finely chopped them.  This recipe will become a staple for me.

YUM.  I made a few changes- I added a clove of garlic to the yogurt sauce to give it more flavor.  I also used about 1/2 an onion in the mixture (instead of a whole), I substituted baking soda for the baking powder, and used only a 1/2 c. or so of breadcrumbs.  I also formed the patties and dipped them in breadcrumbs- I thought it would help make them crispy but it didn't do much.  I made 9 patties and put 2 on each pita.  (Served with chopped cucumber, chopped tomato, feta, and chopped green onions)  Will definitely make them again!

Really yummy! Instead of frying I put a tiny but of olive oil in a muffin tin and baked them at 375 for 40 minutes. Served with raw veggies to dip in the cucumber sauce.

I fried these in olive oil at 350°, which a) does not smoke at that temp, contrary to popular belief, and b) made these a bit healthier AND c) tastier. I also mistakenly added a can of cannelloni beans when doubling the recipe, which was a fabulous mistake—the falafel had a creamier texture and stayed more moist than they usually do. I also used baking soda instead of powder (I think the powder is a typo), didn't add olive oil to the batter, I used Panko bread crumbs simply because I didn't have regular, and I used a couple teaspoons of dried parsley instead of fresh. Fresh would've been better but they were still delish. These stuck together beautifully, tasted fantastic (bravo on the spice mixture) and are only four stars because the yogurt sauce wasn't my thing. Otherwise this would be five stars, especially with my happy accidents. Thanks for the recipe—definitely a keeper! Just need baba ghanoush and hummus recipes to match!

This was so delicious! I didn't have any coriander so I skipped it, and I thought I had cayenne but didn't, so I added a pinch of chili powder instead.  I think it made no difference at all.  Also substituted dried parsley (1/8 cup) instead of fresh.  Even with those changes, the falafel was outstanding! Next time I'll try frying them in a pan just sprayed with PAM and see how that goes.  Also, the cucumber sauce was fabulous too.  I'll definitely make this again!

I love this recipe. I've made it multiple times and it always turns out great. I think my only modifications are in regards to the sauce. I use a little sour cream, garlic, some lemon juice and lots of fresh dill. Thank you for the recipe!

Okay so I wanted to try it your way first, however I'm not a fan of frying since I'm doing the whole weight loss thing. Still, I don't like tweaking other people's recipes until I've tried it at least ONCE the way that it was written. I noticed that Heavensnt86 mentioned something about baking them and I was curious about that method. Seeing as your recipe makes eight, I decided to half and half it---that way I could try both the baked and fried versions and would still follow the directions...err.. somewhat. Fried is fantastic! This was my very first time attempt at trying them homemade. The directions were simple and they were super duper tasty (err though I burned the holy  out of my arm during that frying process but that's all my fault... and thankfully mustard helps). As the Heaven's baking.. well it was still pretty good but it was drier. Luckily the cucumber sauce will help with that. Both are great and I'm definitely making this again. The sauce is incredible though next time I'll try using Greek plain instead of the more watery non-Greek one. This went well with the homemade pita bread that I'd made earlier today. Hands down, a great meal and superb snacks for a later date.

We've discovered that the falafel balls stay together better in the pan if you coat them in flour before frying them. Great recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out amazing! The first one I fried fell apart but then I remembered that I forgot to refrigerate the mixture. Refrigerated for 15 minutes and they didn't fall apart again!

Yum! First time making homemade falafel and I loved this. I just made WAY more than 8 patties....The first batch (about half the mix) made about 8 large patties, and then I made a second batch with the remainder into smaller balls (about half the size of first) and got about 10 out of that. So I would recommend ignoring the instruction for 8 patties and go with the size you find manageable. I liked the smaller balls, more crisp!

Amazing falafel! My family was so happy, and the recipe is really quite easy. I had trouble with the balls falling apart in the oil, but only a few. Thanks to others' reviews I figured out that the smaller you make them the less they crumble and it worked out great!

This was awesome! I made one batch, cleaned the kitchen, then after tasting, promptly got out all the ingredients for another go round. I had only half the parsley needed this time, so used fresh cilantro and baby spinach. Also forgot the oil, but didn't taste a difference, so won't use in the future. I also baked as a commenter suggested at 400 degrees for ten min on each side. I made mine using rounded tablespoonfuls, about the size of a chicken nugget, and each batch made about 35 delicious nuggets!

As I write this I have a huge mess in my kitchen that I am dreading cleaning up....I made the recipe exactly as stated except that I switched the baking powder for baking soda.  I made 8 nice patties, heated my up the oil and carefully place the patties in the oil. after about 2 minutes they completely fell apart.  I ended up with an oil mess of mush that I had to strain.  The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the cucumber sauce was good and I did put some of the mush in a pita and ate it with lettuce, tomatoes and the sauce....it was ok....definitely NOT worth the mess I am looking at right now!

I made the falafel but not the cucumber sauce. The falafel was amazing. The only difference I made was I baked them on parchment instead of frying. I will make them again.

This was awesomely delicious.  Unlike my past attempts at falafel they stayed as tasty balls when fried and did not disintegrate into a goop of tiny bits.  I followed the recipe as written except I added 2 T of flour as suggested and made them 1" diameter balls (~ 2 dozen) instead of patties.  They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Try this recipe!

Well, I only used the sauce part of the recipe as I had a box Falafel mix in the pantry, but the sauce was AMAZING!  I'll try the Falafel recipe next time along with the sauce.  Yummm!  Also, I served mine on a bed of lettuce, added some smashed avocado and diced tomatoes and it turned out great, the avocado really adds something nice to it, I'll also add some sprouts next time! :)

It was good, but it was hard to keep the patty together.  I only had 2 out of 8 survive.  Even with the falafel broken into pieces, it still tasted good.

Super delicious! My husband requested to have this recipe multiple times a month.  Even my 2 year old loves the falafels.  I didn't make the cucumber sauce- the mayo turned me.  We use Tzatziki Sauce I with this recipe and they are amazing together!

It's a decent recipe, but I found the mixture too bland. I added 1 TB flax seed - ground. Then I added 1/2 tb of oregano for flavor. Lastly, I added 1 cup basmati rice half cooked for thickening. Then I let it set in my fridge for a hour or so. Now it's perfect. Thanks!

This satisfied the need for a "meatless Monday" dinner and my craving for falafel lately! Made almost per recipe:  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I tossed a couple handfuls of organic baby spinach leaves into my food processor, which worked perfectly! I used  1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 Panko (the full cup) and baked them according to the top reviewer's suggestions. Next time (oh yes, there will be a next time), I'll reduce the salt and cumin a bit. Due to lack of needed ingredients, I had to sub out light sour cream for the plain Greek yogurt and use dried chives, as I didn't have any fresh (or dried) dill. Added a little minced garlic and some onion powder to the cucumber sauce and it was incredibly tasty! Served with tabouli and fresh diced tomatoes and feta, this was perfectly filling and will definitely remain on the Meatless Monday rotation!

Delicious.  I used HEAVENSNT86's suggestion of baking at 400F for 10 minutes on each side, then 2 minute broil.  Not as crispy as I like my falafel.  I'll definitely have to try frying it.  Still, really good, and my normally picky parents both loved it.

Delicious! This is the recipe I have been looking for for years. When I used to work in Manhattan eons ago, there was a tiny Israeli restaurant that is no longer in business. They made falafel that I was addicted to. These taste exactly like them. I took one bite and was transported to Fulton Street! You Must Make These!

This is a family favorite.  I make it exactly as written, & it is delicious!  My 4 kids (ages 6 - 19) all love this, even the carnivorous teenage boy!  Also, we use the cucumber sauce a LOT.  As a veggie dip, on sandwiches...it is fresh & absolutely yummy!

I've tried several versions, but this one is by far the best.  The only changes I made was to use leeks instead of onion, and I used less bread crumbs.  My Egyptian husband declared it "wonderful".  Thank you for this special treat.

I could tell everyone was nervous that I was making this for family night dinner.  They all were happy that I did after the meal.  I followed this recipe but used the "baked falafel" recipe method of cooking for less fat (on pan with 2 tsp. of olive oil for 3 mins on each side and then baked @ 400 for ten minutes). I did not use this cucumber sauce but made the "tzatziki" by Teina P.  I can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow!

This was an excellent recipe! The only change I made was to add baking soda instead of the baking powder. I also did like the recipe said and added the bread crumbs little by little until it was the correct consistency to make patties. I think I ended up using a little less than 3/4 cup. I fried the patties. The sauce was good too. My husband liked it better than the regular yogurt cucumber sauce I normally make for falafel. This falafel recipe along with the sauce will be my new standard. We didn't use feta cheese to top it this time and agreed it would be better if we did. So, I would suggest adding it on top. It gives it a really nice, salty zing! Thanks for the recipe!

Only needed 1/2 of the sauce. The spice and bread crumbs were the correct amounts for me. I made the patties and put them into the fridge until I was ready to cooks them. Next time I will make them into little balls --like mini meatballs. My kids even ate this (one with ketchup).

Sean, you are right! I did not alter the recipe in any way. My boyfriend, who is very meat-&-potatoes and who I am sure has never even a chickpea, was so in love with the cucumber sauce that I almost didn't have any for the falafel cakes when they were done. The flavor of the cakes was very, very nice but the cucumber sour cream sauce is "the bomb". It will be our new holiday dip; it deserves a recipe entry all of its own!

These are restaurant-quality falafels. I follow the recipe exactly, making my "pinch" of cayenne pepper and "dash" of black pepper very generous. The seasoning is spot-on. I use a pastry cutter to mash the chickpeas (it's faster than a fork). In one batch I took the time to remove the skins from the chickpeas, but I didn't notice any major textural difference so I just leave them on now. I once pressed the mix into burger-sized patties -- falafel burgers! Everyone loved them.

This was really good - I usually get the mix but it's nice to have a from scratch recipe.  I didn't have bread crumbs so had to use panko but it worked.  I also used baking soda as others had suggested and used cilantro instead of parsley as that's what I had on hand.  I think I would use the cilantro again.

I drained and rinsed the chickpeas and they remained too firm despite vigorous mashing so I put them in the food processor and pulsed them.No way they would have "mashed". As for the am't of pepper I suggest much more than a dash. These held together and fried well but were missing some zing,- very bland in my opinion.The arab/israeli falafal I have eaten is denser and stronger tasting.

I attempted to make this falafel following the recipe as given, but found the resulting mixture (before cooking) to be more liquid than solid. I suspect the onion was the culprit, though the onion i used wasn't overly large.  I ended up adding chickpea flour until the mixture became a manageable dough, froze as small patties, and then later cooked. I felt the flavor was pretty good (but a bit too much onion left a strong taste in the mouth), the texture was lacking due amount of flour I had to use.  Will reattempt, hopefully with better results.

Perhaps a measurement of onion would be useful for others like me. If anyone has a suggestion it would be appreciated.

This was seasoned absolutely perfectly.  I, like others, baked mine.  I only had dried herbs, but these still tasted amazing, especially with the tzatziki!  Keeper for sure!

I absolutely LOVED this!  It turned out PERFECTLY (even the sauce), and I followed the directions to the T ... did not skimp on anything, including the PATIENCE required in mashing the chickpeas by hand!  It does require some patience, but it is SO worth it, and much-much better than anything I have ever purchased in the store.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!

This is the best falafel recipe I have tried. I have 3 kids and they all loved it, even the one year old. I did not have trouble with them falling apart when I cooked them either which I have had with other recipes. I will definitely be making these again soon.

Fried the first batch, baked the rest for lunch the next day.  Of course they are better fried! But clean up is easier when you bake them and they are still good.

amazing Falafel.  I did actually puree everything in the blender but the chickpeas, oil and bread crumbs then stirred it all together and shaped.  I also did bake them at 400 for 10 mins per side and that was perfect.  Will make this again & again.

Great taste! I went the baked route and didn't think they were lacking any of the crunch of the crust and they were perfectly moist inside. Will definitely make again.

I increased cayenne to 1/2 tsp. Decreased baking powder to 1/2 tsp. (only because I live over 6,000 ft. elevation). Then instead of frying I sprayed Pam in a pan, then brushed each one with olive oil. Baked @400 in convection oven about 25 minutes. Such a great recipe! Delicious!

These were definitely falafels but they weren't amazing. With the works (Pita, hummus, lettuce, tomato tzatziki sauce) they are great but alone... Not so much.

Made this as-is, though I forgot the bit of cayenne. Baked instead fried as per other reviews. This is my official falafel recipe from now on (chose a great recipe for my first try at making these!) and won't try any other. I used a different sauce though... I'll try this one next time. Thanks Sean!

I thought they were great.  I did bake them instead of frying them.  The cuke sauce was excellent.  Unfortunately, neither hubby nor the kids really liked them, so I probably won't make it again for the family.

This is a great recipe and I was thrilled with myself for making something that comes so close to the great falafel I have had at restaurants. I wish I had read the comments prior to making this because I also experienced the problem of having them fall apart while frying. Next time I will bake them.

Also a great cucumber sauce, but I added some crushed garlic (1 clove) for added heat and flavor.

This was really good and easy.  I put the onion and garlic in the Ninja and when they were chopped I added the chickpeas and just chopped them a couple of times.  I also baked them at 425 for 12 minutes on each side.  They were great and so was the sauce.

AMAZING!  I followed the directions almost exactly, except I didn't have access to a blender and so I was just chopping and chopping and mashing until my arm almost fell off.  It was worth it though!  The only change I made to the ingredients was to use half parsley and half cilantro, as I had both and noticed both were used in a lot of other falafel recipes.  The sauce was great too, I added more dill than called for, I think; I just did it to taste.  Served as suggested in a pita with tomato and some shredded lettuce.  I couldn't even finish a serving, and my boyfriend eats huge portions, but was stuffed after one two-patty serving of these.  Very filling and very good!  I'm so excited this turned out so well!

Delicious! My 6 yr old loved it. He had falafel in a mediterranean restaurant and hated it, so I told him these were chickpea patties and he ate it up. The parsley, onion, and garlic in the blender did NOT work; needs a food processor or the oil added, which is what I did. I still ended up with some huge chunks of onion though. I will finely mince the onion next time, as I don't have a food processor. Definitely will make time and again!

Made Falafel for the first time ever and I surprised myself how easy it was. My changes: Omitted baking powder, used chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 T) in lieu of coriander and substituted breadcrumbs with 4 T of Panko. My boyfriend devoured it and asked me to make more.

Awesome, did half panko and half reg breadcrumbs. Was going to make a different sauce but this one was pretty good. Made mix early and put in fridge. Added bread crumbs right before cooking and it was fine. So not alot of mess after dinner. Def will make this again. One other thing, did the parsley, onion and garlic in the magic bullet, which usually sucks but it worked awesome. chop a little first

YUM! I folllowed HEAVENSNT86's suggestion and baked instead of fried them! I topped the patties with some leftover mango chutney and a sprig of parsely! Beautiful and Delicous! Only change I made was I used a few teaspoons curry powder in place of the spices since it was pretty much the same blend anyway.

These were excellent!! After reading other reviews I modified slightly by adding 2 eggs rather than one, and leaving out the baking powder (didn't seem to be a common ingredient in other recipes). I also didn't puree the onion, garlic, and parsley as I like a bit of texture (okay I was lazy and didn't want to take out the food processor for such a small thing).

Mine turned green from all the parsley and then when I baked them, they were falling apart as I flipped them and took them off the baking sheet. Overall it looked pretty unappetizing but still tasted pretty good. Also, I would recommend looking up a different cucumber sauce recipe.

This falafel recipe is great. The flavor is to die for! A little trouble with keeping it from crumbling while frying, but I can deal with that. The cucumber sauce didn't go over so well though. Perhaps it was the organic plain yogurt I used. Will definitely try another go at the sauce, and there's no doubt I will use the falafel recipe again and again!

My husband usually complains when I make a meatless meal. He told me he really liked this meal without me even asking. 

I made some low fat substitutions to the sauce and baked the falafel instead of frying it. It still turned out delicious and brown, though not super crunchy.

Why fry? This is the best falafel I have ever had... husband agrees! I followed others advice and baked at 420 for 20 minutes, turned and continued baking for another 10 minutes. I didn't have any problems with crumbling using this method. I used fresh-toasted ciabatta bread for bread crumbs and I also used baking soda instead of powder. For the sauce I added garlic and used fat free plain Greek yogurt. SOOOO YUMMY!

This recipe was ok.  I tried frying one, but it feel apart and the remains tasted very oily.  Then, I followed the suggestions to bake them at 420 in the oven for 20 minutes, flip, and then continue baking for another 10 minutes.  They came out pretty good that way.  I also think this recipe called for too much salt.

I made this for dinner and it was AMAZING!!!!!!  I only made a couple of changes.  For the cucumber sauce I shredded the cucumber and used parsly instead of dill weed.  I also wasn't paying attention to the amount of chick peas I was supposed to use and accidently used a 28oz can and they turned out great.  I highly reccomend these!

So easy to make and sooo good. My whole family enjoyed it my husband thought it was the best falafel he ever ate(and we just came back from a trip to Israel). I did not make the sauce but served it with Tahina and Israeli salad.

Outstanding idea. I changed some of the ingredients so suit my taste and our food allergies. The crispy little patties got raves. They are best done very crispy and quite small.   As for the changes: Brown rice bread cubed and then crumbed in a bladed coffee grinder; a few shakes of ground roasted cumin, garlic powder, ground oregano, tumeric; no coriander. For the sauce I used tofu sour cream and mayo with a half cup cooked chopped spinach. I would use cucumbers if I had them. Much less dry dill weed.

These were excellent!  It was the first time I have ever made them and both my husband and I loved them.  Thank you for the other comments as we used baking soda as suggested and formed them into balls rather than patties.  The sauce was very good too.

These falafel had a great taste, but fell apart a little on me.  I think I did not add enough of the bread crumbs.  I made the cucumber sauce with lowfat sour cream because I live in Japan and I couldn't find unflavored yogurt in the store.  Overall this was great!  Made home made pitas to go along with it, made a nice lunch.

Absolutely delicious and satisfying.....can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.  Followed the recipe as written but I sauteed the patties and then drained them on paper towels and finished off baking at 400 as others advised with a couple of minutes under the broiler.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe though my falafels didn't stay together and so it became more of a "stuffing" consistancy. Next time I am going to try and add more bread crumbs and maybe throw in the freezer a little so that they stick better together.  Otherwise, everything tasted wonderfully.

This was delicious exactly as written. I fried mine in a little oil for about three minutes and then baked them to reduce the fat content/calories, and served it with Peppy's Pita Bread and a cucumber, tomato, red onion salad with mint from this site. Yum!

Yum. Followed the recipe except for using dried parsley that I had on hand and subbing dried cilantro for coriander. The results were delish. Per the boyfriend, "These were better than the one's we got from the stand in downtown Brooklyn." I might have to agree. Enjoy! =)

I only made the Falafel but it was amazing! Didn't change a thing except I baked it instead of frying.  10 min on each side of a greased pan @ 400 degrees.    I topped it with Tzatziki sauce from Trader Joe's. I made mine as a salad and my fiance had his in flat bread. I'll never use a box mix again! My meat eating fiance woke up this morning asking for me to make him the leftovers to take to work!

Delicious falafels. I doubled the recipe and found (1/3 of the way through frying) that it needed another egg to bind. But, once I did that, they were great. Try serving them with also with a little bit of harissa or even Vietnamese chili sauce and Goddess dressing.

Delicious and easy recipe for falafel at home. It uses a lot of oil but it is reusable. I used homemade yogurt and fresh mint instead of dill in the sauce. The combination is delicious! I baked a few in the toaster oven instead of frying them. They were good, but of course fried is better! I served with pita, a garden salad, and rice seasoned with cinnamon, cumin, and chicken broth. Everyone enjoyed it, including our friends' toddler who called the falafel "cookies"!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, but only used 1/2 an onion.  I still thought the amount of spices were overpowering, & generally I like a lot of flavor.  I may try this again & cut back on the amounts.

These are really, really good! The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I did have to double up on the spices after taste-testing the original mix.  I fried up a few for my father and they tasted great.  I'm trying to be as healthy as I can so I did what other reviewers did and baked the rest of the batch up.  Both methods are very, very tasty. Thanks for the recipe, I'm never going back to the boxed/powdery stuff!

I highly recommend baking this recipe instead of frying it. 1) It's easier 2) It's heathlier  The cucumber sauce is also very good.  I stuck to the recipe and everyone loved it.  I'd make this is large quantities and just eat with pita or cucumber/tomato salad.

Great recipe as is, didn't change a thing. I've never had falafels before and this was my first time making them. They were really, REALLY good. Even my husband, who says he hates chickpeas, thought it was quite tasty. The cucumber sauce is fantastic!

Excellent falafel recipe. These are great baked or fried. I recommend using panko breadcrumbs - they'll absorb more moisture and are a little more subtle than regular breadcrumbs.

I am really happy to have found this recipe. I love falafel, and these are so much better than the box mix.  They were very fresh tasting. I added 2 eggs because the one I tested before cooking the rest fell apart. Otherwise, put it together as written except that I was out of cayenne. I used a food processor and pulsed the beans into the parsley mixture with no problems.  The sauce was made as written and was really good. We made sandwiches out of it with flatbread and tomatoes. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Good and easy. I had some extra garbanzo beans that were fresh (not canned). It took me a lot longer to mash. Should've used the blender. I followed the advice of others who said to: 1) use baking soda instead of baking powder and 2) bake instead of fry. Glad I baked. It came out beautifully-good color! But substituting the baking soda made it too salty for my taste. Cucumber sauce was awesome!

The Cumin makes ALL the difference! What a great flavor. I did what others did and instead of frying, baked in oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes on each side and broiled each side for 2 additional minutes.

My "vegetarian" daughter was home from school for a week, so I tried quite a few new vegie recipes. This one was excellent. I ate the leftovers for lunch the rest of the week. The sauce was simple and really good too.

Delicious. I too baked them like the other reviewers. Really easy to make, I ended up microwaving the chick peas and throwing them in the blender (even though it says not to) and the consistency was fine. Also I didnt have coriander or parsley so I left those out but the falafels still came out great.

We've made this twice now.  Both times we baked it instead of fry- 10 minutes each side in 400 degree oven and then 2 minutes each side on broil.  Much better than box mixes we have used, but not as good as the local Lebanese restaurant.

I  loved this recipe!  It was easy to make except smashing the beans. Maybe a morter and pestle would work better? I used organic beans but it was still labor intensive.  The falafel was sticky without the flour so I kept adding it and mixing. I also used a different recipe for the taziki.

Very easy. Not labor intensive at all. I baked them as well and they turned out fantastic. I made a double batch and it still took no time at all. Kept a little extra of the mix and bagged it up--it's in the freezer now for a quick dinner moment.

Quite lovely, I didn't have quite enough bread crumbs so I just used stale bread and crackers until the right texture was achived.  I reduced the oil to a light coat on the bottom of the pan. Flavor was outstanding!

I love this recipe!  It tastes so much better than any falafel i have ever had. I do like to change the recipe a bit, but the first time I made it to recipe and it was yummy as well. I use baking soda instead of baking powder, which makes your egg mixture grow a little but helps the falafel stay tender inside and crunchy on the outside when eating it. I also do not use the mayonnaise I just use more yogurt and I add tomatoes to the yogurt mixture.

This was a great recipe. My family loved the taste! I did have trouble using the blender to blend the onion, parsley and garlic--it wouldn't blend. I ended up using the food processor, but it wasn't very smooth--I wonder if anyone has any suggestions about that. I ended up having to add water. Mine also fell apart in the oil, but I think I will try baking it the next time.

Amazing falafel and cucumber sauce. You need to play around with the amount of bread crumbs a bit until the falafel mix feels ready to go. My version came out excellent... the falafel all stayed together and the sauce was very tasty. Great recipe!

These were fantastic!!! The only thing I realized after the 1st batch was that you need to be careful when you shape them for the frying. Be sure to tightly shape the falafel's, otherwise they will break apart in the oil. Otherwise, everything about this recipes was wonderful. I will definitely be using this as my go to falafel recipe.

This is a great recipe! I baked it this time as others suggested and it is just as good and not so messy or greasy. They were room temperature by the time we got around to eating them on New Year's Eve, but every last one of a double batch was gone in short time. Thanks, Sean, for a falafel that tastes almost exactly like the one at my favorite farmer's market stand!

Made this today & served it in pitas with a modified dill sauce, feta cheese, cucumbers, and tomoto slices. It was tasty and very filling, with a couple adjustments. I added more bread crumbs and used the Fry Daddy instead of on the stove. Next time I will add more spices just because we like it that way.

Great recipe!  I made this tonight for visiting family since meat was not an option.  Everyone loved it, I tweaked it a little bit by doubling the garlic.   Used fresh cilantro and dried parsley.  Also, I forgot the baking powder.  I made them into balls and deep fried them in my fryer.  They did not fall apart, they looked perfect.  They were crisp on the outside and moist and soft on the inside.  Served them with a dill yogurt sauce and hummus in whole wheat pitas.  There were no leftovers.

Great recipe! I left out the coriander but otherwise I followed the recipe almost exactly. I had no problem with them falling apart, but I did add a little flour because the mixture seemed a bit wet. I also drained the yogurt for an hour or so before making the sauce, and added a bit of lemon juice. It was perfect! I eat it on a pita or flat-bread with lettuce and tomato, yum! Even my husband liked it, and he doesn't like chickpeas.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used Middle Eastern yogurt as a base for the sauce and I oven-fried the patties as suggested in other reviews.  Other than that I made no changes. My dad, who was a falafel virgin, LOVED these.  I will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe!

I have always used the box of falafel mix and will no longer.  This was simple and delicious.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of choosing not to blend the veggies and to just chop.  I was tempted to fry them up without the bread crumbs or egg because the consistency was so good, but I was too weary. I used my own tzatziki recipe and the result was great.  Even my meat and potatoes boyfriend approved. Thanks.

I love these. I baked them at 425 for 20 min on one side and 8 min on the other as another reviewer suggested. I wouldn't like them as much without the sauce; I'm glad the falafel and sauce are both part of the recipe.

great recipe! this is my first time making falafel and they turned out great.  I added at least a 1/2 tsp of cayenne (i love the heat!), but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe.  i also kept everything kinda chunky (did not blend onions and parsley until smooth) adn the texture is way better.  I baked some adn fried others - the baked ones are good for a healthy alternative, but the fried ones are better (of course :).  Also, the "cucumber salad" is essentially a tzatziki sauce - just add some garlic and you're there!  I would also suggest to grate the cucumber (i buy the euro cucumbers and leave skin adn seeds in for less work) adn then drain in a colander for 10-15 to let some of the liquid drain...it will give you a way better, thicker tzatziki.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Falafel Perfection!  I've had trouble in the past with falafels.  This time they turned out great.  I went through the effort of removing the outer skin from the chick peas, and it made a lot of difference in the end.  I also followed other posters' reviews and added baking soda instead of baking powder, and only added 1/2 cup bread crumbs.  They were awesome!  Thanks Sean for sharing this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I love falafel but try not to eat fried food, so I baked it, and it turned out wonderful!  The cucumber yogurt sauce is great too - I didn't have any dill, and I added a clove of garlic.  I will be making this recipe for years to come.  Thank you so much Sean!

Very good. I baked this instead of frying. I added dill to the sauce, and added sour cream instead of mayo, and added a tsp of garlic. Delicious. Thank you.

Made as is. Tasted great especially the cucumber sauce. I used fresh dill rather than dried. Next time I'll double the sauce because, well, it tasted so good.

I have been craving falafels for a long time...I used to make them out of the mix but haven't been able to find the mix lately.  This recipe was sooo good.  However, I recommend doubling it if you want more the next day.  I ate it for dinner, and finished it in the middle of the night.  Soooo good!

Spent the 4th on my brothers boat and I brought these for appy's. They were a huge hit with everyone and the cucumber sauce was so refreshing! I replaced the baking powder with self rising flour and because I had it in the house and needed to get rid of it, I minced some red bell pepper and added that to the mix. Delicious and thank you Sean!

I used to make this all the time when I was obsessed with falafel. I simply didn't like it any other way than this recipe. Some people said they tasted good baked, and I've tried that and I didn't like it very much. Had a weird taste rather than when they're fried. I'd sacrifice those calories, anyway =P The cucumber sauce is absolutely amazing. It's definitely my favorite part of the recipe.

These came out perfect!! I made no substitutions, except soy yogurt for the cucumber sauce. My husband requested them everyday until I made them again. This is now at the top of the list of our favorites!

Good recipe.  In addition to everything in the recipe, I used; whole wheat pitas and chopped romain, cucumber and tomato.  Tasted like a falafe, from Iraq. The only ingridient I omitted was the lemon juice.

This was pretty good. I baked it in the oven and the centre was soft...I prefer mine hard and crispy though. But I did use two extra large eggs. Also, they turned funny colour of green from using frozen parsley cubes, which I didn't mind at all.

I give it 4 stars for the cucumber sauce alone.  I must not be a huge fan of falafel or I did something wrong because it was not very good to me.  I've only had falafel one other time and that was from a mix, so I'm not a falafel expert.

I had some serious logistal issues with the falafel. We added about 2 cups of bread crumbs and the first batch that we fried completely fell apart in the pan. After added another cup of breadcrumbs to the remaining ones they were fine. I think maybe one onion is too much.  This was tasty and good but I will have to modify it if I make it again.

This was great! I was making this and realized that I was out of Cayenne Pepper and lemon juice so I used hot pepper sauce and lime juice. The taste was great and I'll make sure I have the correct ingredients on hand next time I make this!

Very good! While preparing this, I almost cut down on the amount of onion as it really seemed like a lot while I was mixing everything together, but the one medium onion was just right after they were done cooking.  I used 1/4 cup of egg substitute in place of the whole egg and ended up using about 3/4 cup of bread crumbs.  I pan-fried the falafel in a little canola oil (much less than in the recipe) and, boy, did these things soak up the oil! I'm going to try baking them next time.  Surprisingly, I was not so impressed with the sauce - I felt it needed something extra so I added a little lemon juice and some chopped mint.  I think I'll use a different sauce next time, but all in all this is a very good recipe!

My boyfriend and I were going to use a box mix, but came across this recipe and decided to try it. It was so good! We baked them instead of frying, see Heaven's review, and they turned out perfectly. Easy, healthy, and delicious! We also liked the cucumber sauce- we used regular lowfat yogurt. I will try greek next time.

Delicious! I made a few changes.  I only used half an onion due to personal taste preferences.  I used my food processor and blended the onion, garlic and parsley at a high speed and then added the chickpeas at a lower speed.  The texture turned out just perfect and I saved myself from hand mashing the chickpeas.  I did end up adding an extra egg to help everything stick together.  With 2 eggs, I used the full cup of bread crumbs as called for.  I pan fried, and got about 12 falafels.  I cannot comment on the sauce because I used the tzatziki sauce from the Chicken Souvlaki Gyro Style recipe (it was fabulous!!) instead.  I may try baking next time but wanted to try it this way first.

Falafel was excellent.  I never made the dip and just used store bought.  I also baked and they came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Husband loved it and I will definitely make again!

This was very good! I just added a little bit of olive oil to parsely & onions in my food processor because I couldn't get a smooth consistency. Evrything tasted great and my 3 1/2 year old loved them! I served with pita bread and avocado. I skipped the mayo in sauce, and it was still yummy.

These were awesome!  I'd never had falafel before, but I've been looking for high-protein, high-fiber snacks to make and anything with chickpeas seemed like a good idea so I gave these a try.  I didn't make the cucumber sauce because of food allergies, but the falafels themselves were fanastic.  I had to add closer to 2 cups of breadcrumbs and I found that cooking them over medium heat worked better than medium-high.

This is yummy, and a good base recipe, but the falafel itself is pretty bland. After trying it as printed, I now double or triple the cumin, add a pinch of salt, and an extra pinch of cayenne. This seems to do the trick.

This is a GREAT recipe for falafel! I followed the recipe to a T and it came out delicious! I think I made my patties a little too big though cause I only ended up with 6 and they fell apart a little while frying, but it didn't affect the flavor. Next time I'll make them a little smaller. I served them in pita halves with lettuce, cucumber and tomato slices, feta and tzatziki. Due to some of the not so great reviews of the 'cucumber sauce' I skipped it and made AR's Tzatziki Sauce I which went perfectly. I've been trying to make at least 3 meat-less meals a week lately and this one's definately going to be a regular! Cheap, easy and delicious, what more could you want?

Sooo good! I'd never made falafel's before, but I wanted to make something different for a "girls night" and decided to go vegetarian. I was really happy with how they turned out (I baked them instead of frying), and the girls were also impressed! I'll definitely make these again.

Good sauce. I always add a little garlic and red wine vinegar though.

I too blended even the chickpeas/garbanzo beans, and it all turned out great.  The falafel taste reminds me of the ones I make out of the box, so it was familiar and tasty!  I, as well as both my girls, ages 9 & 7, enjoyed them very much.  I didn't make the cucumber sauce, maybe next time, but still a recipe I plan to make again and again!

This was my fisrt attempt at falafels and they turned out great!  I omitted the parsley simply because I didn't have any.  I also ended up putting the chick peas in the blender which had no ill effects on the recipe.

I thought these were fantastic!!  I didn't have coriander or cayenne pepper, but even without those, these were still very tasty and very easy to make.  The sauce was great - a little thin, but great with the falafel.  We had them in pita pockets and they were delicious!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  I wasn't sure at first when I was putting it together but these have a very crisp, fresh taste even though they're fried.  I used red chilli flakes instead of cayenne because I like the random bites of heat throughout and green onion instead of white.  I also lightly breaded the patties before I fried them which gave a really crispy outer shell.  The sauce goes perfectly with these and the leftovers make a great veggie dip.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Actually, I have not made the falafel yet but I was looking for a cucumber sauce...this one is great with "greek chicken" kabobs. I omitted the mayo and it tasted awesome without. The sauce would be excellent on chicken or lamb gyros, meat kabobs and of coarse falafel. Thanks for good recipe!

My husband loves falafels, and agreed with another comment: These are much better than the ready mix. I nevertheless think something is missing, to give it more taste... But it was really GOOD.

I thought this was really good. I didn't add the coriander because I didn't have any. I don't usually measure spices but I know I put more than a pinch of cayenne and unfortunately didn't even notice it. I pulsed the chickpeas in the food processor a few times and the consistency was perfect. I also tried cooking them both ways, frying and baking and the baking dried them out, so I wouldn't do it that way again. I will definitely make this recipe again and fry them.

Really, REALLY good... and I know falafel :)  Based on other reviews, I decided to cut down on the amount of fat and bake the patties instead of deep frying them.  They turned out a tad dry on the outside, but still moist on the inside. Still, they were very, very tasty. Also, I doubled the amount of sauce the recipe called for, too.

Yummy!  Very easy to make!  I made it vegan by using soy yogurt and panko (japanese bread crumbs).  It was so good I made it twice in once week!

In the past I have made the sauce with just yogurt and some blue cheese (mashed and mixed in -just add a little of the cheese and keep adding to your individual taste). The very first time I had a falafel it was made for me by a roommate who is a vegetarian friend and he used the yogurt/blue cheese sauce- it really gives the falafels a good kick! Add diced cucumber to the pita with the falafel and the sauce.

With so many ingredients I was sure that this recipe would be complicated - not the case.  This recipe is so easy to follow, and the results are fantastic.  As good a Falafel as I have ever tasted ... even if I did make it!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  It was the first time I made falafel at home, and it was better than any of the professional ones I've had.  Very easy to do!  Its simple to make minor adjustments so it suits your tastes; but I think overall it's great as is.  One hint; if you make the patties into balls, pack tightly!

I wouldn't seve this to my kids, but my husband and I loved them. They're as good as any we've had out in town. Very fresh and very easy.
