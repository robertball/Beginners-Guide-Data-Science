As much as I love every single ingredient in this recipe, it still seemed to be lacking something.  I made it as written except for adding the milk because I didn't drain either the tomatoes (I used mild Rotel) or the hatch chilies that I used.  It was plenty moist enough, but I'm thinking I was maybe missing the tomato sauce (or something along that line) on the top as it was baking---or maybe it just needed more salt.  Or maybe both.  I would make this again with a few changes.  But I would definitely try it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an EXCELLENT twist on your normal meatloaf! I actually had to reluctantly make this one, to appease a crowd, and I do NOT regret! This is now a staple. 

My suggestion: follow the “stacking” method of the jalapeño meatloaf recipe- layer some cheese & chilis about mid-way through. You won’t regret that hidden “surprise”! This is total treat from your normal rotation. Absolutely worth a try!

I  haven't made it yet. I just wanted to let people know that you can get Hatch Chilis from them. Look them up online and you can get them year round.
I will be trying it soon.
