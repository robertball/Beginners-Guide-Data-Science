Well I made this last night for dinner and it was absolutely terrible!  I have no idea what the others who rated this recipe were eating, but this was not good.  It wasn't the flavour....although that wasn't great either.  It was the texture!  The flavour of the butter/brown sugar was lost and my pineapple all stuck to the bottom of the dish (not burned on, just didn't stick to the ham, but rather the dish).  We will never make this dish again.

After seeing this site on our local news, I decided to visit to see if I could find a recipe for ALL the extra ham I cooked on Easter!!  Boy was that my lucky day!!  This recipe is wonderful!  I had to substitute pineapple chunks for slices and sliced swiss cheese for grated, but it was still wonderful.  My adult daughter had stopped by just after I made it and had a taste of it....she then asked if she could have a couple of slices to make a sandwich for work.  She told me the next day that it is as good cold as hot.  My hubby who is a "meat and potato" guy, also loved it and made a sandwich for his lunch too!  In fact I misplaced the recipe so returned to re-print it and fix it for dinner tonight and rate this recipe...I WILL NOT LOSE IT AGAIN!

Very good!  I didn't have any pineapple, so I just made the brown sugar-butter mixture for the top and substituted water for the pineapple juice.  I added some dried minced garlic, as my husband won't eat onion.  Can't wait to try it with the pineapple, and will definitely have a sandwich with it for my lunch tomorrow!

I was just checking out something for dinner, I ran across this one for the recipes of the day. I asked my husband of 12 years have you ever had ham loaf. He is not a meatloaf lover, so why not ham instead. I was a little leary at first, but let me tell you this is great. Nice flavor and texture. Easy to prepare and the whole faimly liked it. Something different I added was the cheese, i didnt have swiss, i had horseradis montery. It was a terrific punch to it. I will make this again, and cant wait to tell others about it. I am sure they will put there noses up at it, but when they taste it! Great way to use up your extra ham! Thanks!

My family loved this recipe especially my 17 year old son .It is moist and has wonderful flavor. I use the leftover honey glazed ham from a meal and grind it in the food processor.That adds alot of flavor and sweetness to the loaf.

I would give this a 4.5 if I could. We shredded a turkey roast (cured like a ham roast..) and used some Swedish cheese. We were unsure of the amount of cheese and pineapple to use, but next time we're going to omit the brown sugar, use 3/4 of a large tin of pineapple, as well as probably 4 slices think of cheese. 
This was the first time I made a recipe without any preconceived idea of what it would turn out like, but it was great! And as other reviewers have mentioned, the leftovers are awesome on sandwiches. Thank you, I can't wait to make this again!!

My husband loved this - but I hated it - so we agreed on 4 stars because he liked it so much.  I don't know why - I just didn't like the flavor and couldn't eat it.

This was pretty good, although I found it to be a bit crumbly. I think I didn't grind the ham fine enough. I thought it made a great sandwich the  next day too.

Perfect combination of savoury and sweet, nice texture.  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used cheddar instead and it was great. Looking forward to trying it cold.

This was great and even my picky eaters loved it.  The only changes I made was that I didn't have any pineapple slices so I used a can of crushed pineapple instead.  I will definitely make it again.
