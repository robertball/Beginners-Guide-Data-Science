It was really easy to put together and make.  The pork chops came out incredibly tender.

I made some serious changes to this by necessity.  I didn't have fresh which I would have preferred so I used canned mushrooms.  I didn't have an onion so I was going t use onion  soup mix.  But I saw a ranch dressing mix in my mix bin  and decided to use that instead.  Really good.  And the gravy would be good on anything, even a steak.
