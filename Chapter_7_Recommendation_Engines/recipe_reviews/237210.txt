Great taste!  Love the contrast of te crunch in chia seeds!  Very easy to make!  An interesting option instead of syrup on pancakes!

I love this recipe. It is the easiest thing I have ever made and it turned out delicious. I am not at all a morning person and normally skip breakfast. This is a lightning quick recipe and is super delish... Not to mention healthy!

I don't care for the crunch of the seeds so I made them into flour.  The color of the spread isn't very appetizing, so I added some hazelnut spread to mask it.  Yum!
