This is the way I've always made my roasted chicken.  I think you can't beat the flavors of rosemary, garlic, thyme,  lemon, S &P, and butter.  Please remember that the size of your chicken will affect the cooking time and amounts of seasonings.  I figure that this recipe would be perfect for a 4 lb chicken, so a smaller or bigger chicken would require adjustments]

Turned out wonderfully. I made a gravy using the drippings 1/4 cup flour and 2 cups of broth and it was amazing! My chicken was 5 lbs and took about an hour and 15 minutes. My daughter wouldn't stop raving about how moist the white meat was. Thank you :)

Wow.   This was so easy.  And very tasty. I did cook it for an hour, flipped it to brown the back side for another 30. Perfect.  Thank you.   The lemon and herbs just set it off.  Yummy

Our family loved it! Was amazing. Chicken was very moist and flavorful. I added a stalk of celery cut in 3 pieces to the cavity with the lemon. And added sliced carrots and onion in the pan. Will do this recipe as a regular for our family.

Delicious! Chicken was so moist an flavorful. I followed recipe exactly except I added garlic to outside on skin, cooked on a rack and added a sprig of fresh rosemary to the lemon in the body of chicken.  Great recipe! My husband liked it too.

Delicious!  I was out of lemons but I did have some zest frozen for that part.  I substituted stuffing the bird with onions instead of lemons.  Also I had the fresh rosemary but only dried thyme.  Worked great!  Yummy recipe :)

I only added a smudge of garlic butter on top of the chicken the last 15 mins of roasting for a flavorful, crispy skin.

This is the best chicken I have ever eaten.  I made it exactly as written.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe.  It is the only recipe I will use in the future and I am thinking it may be great used on a turkey.  YUMM!!

I made one change due to dietary restrictions. Instead of butter I used Earth Balance® and only half the amount specified.  The timing was a bit off, mine took 1 1/2 hours. Great recipe that I'll make again. Thanks for sharing. Update: I've made this a few times since my first review as hubs requested it and he seldom requests any dish. Tonight I put potatoes around the chicken and then broiled them while the chicken was resting for more colour. Loved it, thanks again.
