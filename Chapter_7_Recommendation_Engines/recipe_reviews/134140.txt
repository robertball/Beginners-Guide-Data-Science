Pretty good. I added extra brown sugar to the sauce.

Good!  I cut the beef in thin strips and it turned out great.  Would make again.

I had to use pork shoulder blade.  You should probably pound the meat before putting them in the pinapple juice until they're all even.

The lovely smell of this dish is still hovering in my kitchen.  I'm a big fan of cooked pineapple dishes, but I rarely cook meat other than chicken.  This was a very simple recipe.  I used very thin steaks, maybe quarter-inch, and while the meat wasn't tender, it wasn't tough enough to distract me from how delicious it was.  The sauce was spectacular.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

The recipe was made accordingly, the meat was NOT tender at all...but the pineapple and brown sugar "juice" left in the skillet was excellent over the wild and brown rice - THAT juice I will make again, but not with the meat

It was just okay.  The Eye of Round was still tough and pretty flavorless.

Not BAD! It was pretty good. I could not find a "THIN" eye of round steak, so I ended up using a big round sirloin tip steak.

Made it according to recipe. Meat was extremely dry and tough. I will not make it again.

It was eaten but no one really cared for it.  Meat was not tender at all and I even let it marinate about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  Won't make again.  Sorry.
