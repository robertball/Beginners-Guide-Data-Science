These are very good but very rich. I only had 1 c. of caramel topping, and even that seemed like a bit much. I also used a 13x9 pan, since I didn't have the larger size, and it worked out fine. I also recommend dishing these out in small servings! I also used Granny Smith apples to try to balance out the sweetness of the caramel. Very good!

I made this last week and it was great. I added a generous amount of cinnamon and I will also add raisins the next time.

Based on the reviews, I increased the apples to 3 cups.  I still found it way to sweet.  If I make again, I would decrease the caramel topping to 1 cup ande increase the apples to 4 cups.  The caramel does make it very hard to cut and eat around the edges.  Took this as a dessert to friends house last night and many guest left some of the dessert on their plates -- not something I like to see when it's something I cooked!.

This recipe was good, but the crust part was a bit bland. I added cinnamon, but it also needed a bit of salt.

Dissapointing. Lacked flavor. Maybe using Kraft Caramels in place of the ice cream topping/flour mixture would help.

My family/guests loved this.  I definitely thought it needed more apples, but loved the texture of the caramel and bar parts!

This is an easy, delicious recipe. I use this and it is large enough to take to church and share.  I like using pecans and use a bit more carmel.

Extremely sweet.  I used Granny Smith apples which helped cut the sweetness but if I make this recipe again I think I will use 3 cups of apples instead of 2.  Also the caramel sauce got hard around the edges so I couldn't even cut those pieces in to bars.  Maybe I baked it too long.  Not sure I will try this recipe again.

iT WAS A HUGE HIT AT MY PARTY.  The only thing I did differently was drizzle carmel on the top of the bars after I cut them.  They looked kind of boring so I dressed them up with the drizzle...

I made this recipe and got rave reviews!  I, however, thought it was quite dry.  I thought there was too much topping or maybe it could use a bit more butter in the topping.  The flavor was good, just a bit "crumby".
