Good stuff!  As per another reviewer, I substituted (real) maple extract for some of the vanilla.  I also added about a teaspoon of corn syrup to keep crystallization at bay.  It was very easy to make.  If you have a heavy enameled pot, such as a LeCreuset, this is a great time to use it...you can turn the heat up some.

Made this recipe twice. Fisrt, using heavy cream instead of using half/half and milk.  Second time, I used light cream instead of half/half and milk. (2/3 cup of light cream.) Second time it came out so incredibly creamy amd caramelly. So perfect that I will never use any other recipe fr tgis fudge. Make sure your pot is big and heavy. Watch your candy thermometer closely and don't try to get it to the soft ball stage as quickly as you can. I turned my knob down a bit once it started to boil and let it bubble slowly. It came out just unbelieveable. You must try using just light cream....no milk....and use 2/3 cup. Whip it very well with a large heavy whisk when you add vanilla, and you will find it to be like caramel when you pour it into your pan. UNREAL!

SO yummy.  But you have to be careful not to cook it too long or it will be crumbly.

This recipe is fabulous!!I have made it four times already for the holiday season and have gotten lots of compliments. I altered it slightly by omitting the nuts and using 1/2 teaspoon maple flavor instead of the vanilla. It tastes as good or better as anything from a fudge shop.

Loved this recipe. My husband ate almost the entire batch. He's asked me to make more for hist Christmas stocking. Tasted a lot like pralines.  I might add more pecans next time around.

This is a strange recipe, very smooth and caramel-like before setting, then turns very sugary after stirring.  I wouldn't make it again.

I have eaten it every Christmas for 65 years. It is a family tradition. But when you make candy you must always guard against it turning grainy and crystalizing. It can happen easily. In my family it has always gone by the name Patience, because its difficult to consistently turn it out right. Always cook on a cold clear low humidity day and never let any raw sugar grains come into contact with a turned out batch or it will turn to sugar only patience and repeated attempts will make it turn out right.

something is wrong with this recipe. I too followed it carefully and came up with very tasty powdery mess. IF i were to try it again I would not wait for it to get all the way down to 110 degrees (this took a long time), then stir in vanilla  very briefly then immediately add pecans and "pour" --if you wait until "not glossy" its toast.

well, dont beat this with an electric mixer, after about 30 seconds, this turned into a huge crumbly mess. I'm working on my second batch, and i decided to add a bit of corn syrup, and see if that helps. will also try to use the condensed milk. hope that works out better. it seems like alot of other people had a lot of luck with this one, so i will try again. but if it fails again, i'll let you know

the second attempt failed! this turned into a huge crumbly mess again! i tried to stir with a spoon, checked the candy thermometer, did not overcook. not sure what happened, but i spent several wasted hours, and wont try this one again.

Couldn't locate "my" tried and true penuche recipe so went looking online and found this one.  Prior to shopping for ingredients I tried one last time to find my recipe.  When I found my recipe, filed in the wrong section of my recipe file, I was surprised to see that "my" recipe was the Brenda Clark recipe from AllRecipes. I had not remembered where I had originally gotten the recipe, but apparently I have Brenda to thank for it.  This is the best penuche! Don't change a thing; Brenda's recipe rocks.

My grama made the best penuche fudge and this is right up there. I didn't change a thing, except make sure you use a candy thermometer. I tried it without the first time and it was to dried out. The second time was perfect.

An awful experience for someone who has a lot of experience making fudge and other similar candies!!! I had never made Panocha (or Penuche) so I decided to try this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and everything appeared to going perfectly.  After my candy cooled down to 110, I added the vanilla and started beating it.  Just as it started to lose its shine, I added the pecans and it seemed to come together perfectly.  As soon as I got ready to spread the candy, it turned to a dry, crumbly, sugary mess!!!  Please enlighten me and tell me what I could have done differently.  I tasted the dry, crumbly, sugary mess and was able to tell that had it turned out correctly, it would have tasted delicious!  I would love to make this recipe again but not until someone explaines to me what I did wrong.

I followed the directions exactly! I even took out the candy thermometer. Don't know what happened but just as someone said before started out creamy wen it was hot but cooled into a soft but sugary grainy mess. I think there must be something missing. I don't see how it went wrong. followed to a T. and it was awful.

By the way, if you wonder about the rule about candy “sugaring”, see cookingstackexchange.com to verify.  High Altitudes may be different.  I never needed it.  This is almost a duplicate of the one gramma made every year until my mom had to take over, & then myself, & now my 28 year old granddaughter uses it!!!  Tried and true!!!  Hope this helps!  I can’t tell you how many times I tried to send this advice, but my fingers are slow now because I’m older than dirt!

We were underimpressed. It didn't set up well and the flavor was just okay (good, but not like the traditional Penuche fudge we've had before).

I’m not sure how I feel about how it turned out. It’s not horrible. But didn’t remind me of my childhood favorite. It looked pretty, but when cutting it did seem a bit crumbly. Reminded me of smoother sugar cubes. I’m sure my kids will love it though!
