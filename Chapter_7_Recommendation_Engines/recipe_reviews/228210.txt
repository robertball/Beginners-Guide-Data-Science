Here are some things I've learned while making these caramel apples. 1. If the caramel is not sticking properly, you need to heat caramel up again to 248.  The caramel will stick perfectly until it starts to cool then the butter separates and it will not stick.  It really is useful working with a candy thermometer because you can monitor the temperature closely. With one of the batches I overheated the caramel when reheating and it turned into hard toffee.  2. Placing apples in the boiling water made them seep juice, will try them without following that step the next time.  I had many extra apples and kept them near a cool door, that made the caramel hard but once it was placed in a warm room they started to soften again.  Definitely worth trying, flavor is far superior compared to store purchased caramels.  Also, it is useful to have a helper hold dipped apples upright to cool a moment before placing on parchment otherwise you will have the hot caramel puddle.

Sorry but the caramel slid right off the apples.  I even took it off right as it reached 120 degrees C. Picture shows the best we got.  You can see how the thick caramel pooled at the bottom.  The opposite side of the apples is completly not covered with any caramel at all.

I was very impressed with this recipe! The consistency was wonderful and coated the apples beautifully. I also made sure to twirl the apples on the bottom of the pot (held at an angle) to remove any excess caramel. As written, it made enough to coat 12 medium apples and have enough left over to fill a small jelly jar (For spoon-fulls later ;) 

I get frustrated when searching for recipes only to find them calling for melting caramel candies. I rarely try recipes that have so few reviews, but this was definitely worth the try! Thank you for the great recipe!

I loved these!  So much easier to make than I would have guessed.  I made sure to drop my apples in boiling water for a bit and dry them off really well, letting them get nice and cool before i dipped them in the caramel.  I think I over cooked the caramel just a tad - I did not have a candy thermometer!  But I used a knife and cut slices and it was every bit as delicious and not as messy! LOL  I used Karo Light Corn Syrup, but I think i would like to try it with Karo Dark syrup.

We used to drive 30 minutes to an orchard for their caramel apples because I hadnt found a recipe that was as good as the orchards.  I found this recipe last year and the caramel tastes exactly the same.  I had to figure out how to get the right technique down to get a nicely covered apple but I have it down.  Once the caramel is done let it sit for about 5 minutes then use room temperature apples and roll the apple for about 10 seconds in the caramel and then pull it out of the caramel and let the caramel come off and roll it a bit.  Place the apple on sugared parchment paper if you are making plain caramel apples.  AWESOME...just made them tonight (first batch of the season) and the kids loved it!

Yum-o! So good, followed everything except (I know, I hate when people do this) I didn't dip apples in boiling water and I didn't have sweetened condensed milk. I subbed 1/4 cup 2% milk and it worked beautifully on the apples. Will definitely use again, I would have given it a 5 but I didn't follow everything as listed, so I can't really.

This took quite a long time to get to temperature because I was afraid to burn it.  I used organic apples washed with vinegar and did not dip them in boiling water. The apples taste pretty good and the caramel stuck fine, but even better I had quite a bit of caramel left over so I poured it in a 8X8 square pan lined with parchment paper, put semi-sweet chocolate chips on it while it was still hot along with pecans and a bit of sea salt. That is really good!

it is the best recipe ever!!! just finished making them and they look fantastic....  thanks for the tip in step #3, I didn't have a candy thermometer so I just kept cheking my caramel by dropping a bit in cold water and sure enough, when the ball formed, I turned it off and it was done, I also didn't have vanilla extract on hand so I left it out and it still has an amazing taste...   can't wait to try it next time with  the vanilla extract and the different topping variations, thanks!!!!!

The caramel recipe alone gets five stars!  It was fun to make and tasted delicious!!  My friend took a bite and said "you didn't just melt squares to make these- this is REAL caramel, isn't it!"  The caramel came off the apple when we ate them but it was so good.  I sprinkled my finished product with kosher salt and they are the best I've ever had.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Perfect. Thick, chewy caramel that coated the apples beautifully. Didn't slide off at all. I found that it only took me about 8 minutes on medium heat to reach 248 deg. So, be sure to use your thermometer rather than a stated time as I'm sure all stove tops heat differently. Lastly, I didn't actually dip my apples into boiling water to remove wax, and my apples still held the caramel well.

Made this twice so far and it has gone well both times. I think our first batch was best, and we didn't have a candy thermometer so used the bowl of water trick. I think we overcooked the second batch slightly, our error not the recipe's. Thank you for posting this recipe. It took a long time to find it through all the "unwrapped 16 store bought caramels and melt..." versions.

I tasted the caramel before adding the vanilla it was so good and buttery that I cut the vanilla in half.  I like a more buttery tasting caramel. This really  is the very best caramel apple I have ever had.  I just had one from Rocky Mounyain Choco. It had absolutely nothing on this recipe. I will never buy already made caramel apples again.  This was so good I had to give them away because I would have went into a coma eating them.  Lol. One other thing is the recipe says med. heat , I had my electric oven on 5 and it took more like  45 mins to an hour before the caramel was ready, and it never passed the cold water test but, the candy thermometer did go up more when I slowed the stirring down . The less I stirred it the hotter it became.  I did use a nonstick pan for easy clean up. I let the caramel hardened in the freezer for a few minutes before wrapping them.  They became harder and easier to wrap and they will actually soften in room temperature. This is so good it's crazy unbelievable. I say it qualifies as a #sinfullydelish dessert.

Followed the directions precisely and the results were precisely awesome.  Made 9 apples and poured the rest over some fresh popped popcorn and it was awesome too.

The best thing about this caramel is that it is firm enough to stick well, but stays soft enough to easily bite through its creamy goodness.

Made too much caramel for only 8 apples, have too much left over. Also wasnt really the caramel taste i expected. The dipping in boiling water nonsense made my apples softer than i expected.

Overall, pkay, but wont use this recipe again.

It felt like a long time between waiting on the candy thermometer to go from 225 to 248 but I'm glad I waited it out. Keep stirring!. Once you get to 248 degrees,  it's pretty simple. I poured the remainder on pretzels. There is alot of caramel left over. I bet I could have made 4 or more additional apples. It is very delicious! I also boiled water prior, dipped each apple for 4-6 secondseach, and wiped wax away with paper towels. Caramel stuck no problem.

I used this recipe for the second time in the past month. I stumbled across it looking for a better recipe than I used last year. The reason I wanted to try it was because I didn't have to use Carmel and wanted them to taste homemade.  Well I hit the jackpot. It was easy and  delicious. My family & friends LOVE IT!!!!!!

This was GREAT!  Among all the recipes for caramel apples that just have you melting caramel, this was an exciting find.  I tried it and had perfect caramel the first try, and a lot easier that I had anticipated.  Great recipe.  Didn't change a thing.  LOVED IT!

I followed the recipe to the T , but this carmel "sauce" wouldn't stick to the apple even the ones I dipped in hot water to take the wax off of. A candy thermometer was used with this recipe that turned out to tasting great, just not a good one to cover apples. It's great for an ice cream topping.

This was my first time using a candy thermometer. I was very careful to take it off the heat right at 248°, but I ended up with caramel that was far too hard for eating. The recipe is delicious, but next time I will only take the caramel to 245°. Also, take heed to work very quickly when dipping the apples - by apple #5 the caramel was too thick for a smooth coat.

I followed the recipe and the caramel tasted great.  Just like other reviewers, I struggled with it setting up a little too quick and the caramel was a little too hard for my taste.  Next time I think I will stop a little closer to soft ball temperature.  The left over I put in a silicone candy mold that I sprayed with a little cooking spray and they came out great.

I tripled this recipe for my Cub Scouts, they loved it! I brought it to the meeting in a large crock pot (set on warm) and had the boys dip the apples themselves . Make sure you de-wax your apples before dipping by dropping them in boiling water and rubbing the wax off with a paper towel.

Mixing the ingridients was the easiest part. However, covering the apples with the caramel was somewhat if a challenge, because it caramel thinkens immediatly! Suggesting: have everything prepared, so when the caramel is ready... You dip the apple in the caramel:)

Fantastic recipe, just what I was looking for!  To the person who gave it a bad rating for the caramel sliding off, it was your fault.  You need to put the apples in boiling water for 30 seconds to remove the wax.  If you don't the caramel won't stick.  This is true for any caramel apples.  To anyone wanting to try homemade caramel apples give this recipe a try!

The caramel turned out great. The caramel apples, not so much. I used the leftover caramel to make turtle brownies. So good!!

FANTASTIC homemade caramel apple recipe.

The reason for boiling the apples is to remove any food grade wax that may be coating them.  (can probably skip this step if you sourced your apples directly from an orchard or the tree!)  otherwise this step will help the caramel stick.  If you do not boil off wax 1st hot caramel will melt it and cause wax and caramel to "slide" off as some people experienced.

Heated sauce on my stove set at 8.0 until boiling, then reduced heat to 3.0 and continued boiling while stirring basically nonstop with wire wisk.  (ok to leave for 10-15 sec to grab something quick)

After about 20 min, temp was not rising above 240° so I increased stove to 3.5 for 5 minutes then 4.0 for 5 minutes.  

I'm not sure if my thermometer is off, but I was not getting the "ball effect" when dropping caramel into cold water, so I continued to heat until temp of 255° and then IMMEDIATELY  turned heat to low.  People who get hard or toffee like caramel are letting it get too hot.  (Its science / chemistry people!)  the hotter it gets, the harder the result when cool.  (make peanut brittle!)

No prob coating apples in caramel. Spin-dip them and cont twirling above pan 10 sec with the stick straight up, then horizontally 10-20 sec and finally teirl upright 10-20 sec then place on paper.

Coating in nut topping was kind of tricky.  After just a few seconds the nuts would not "stick"  and I had to help by "pressing " the nuts into the apple (kinda burned my fingers)

A+++

This is kittencal's recipe, just so you know.  If your apples are sliding off, this means you did not take the wax off of the apples beforehand.  I clean it in a sink full of water with about 2 Tbsp salt and 1/4 cup vinegar (also a kittencal recipe) and let it soak for 15-30 mins and then rinse and dry them well.  It may seem like a lot of work, but so is making caramel, so it's worth it. 
This is the best recipe.

This is the best recipe I have tried. Smooth creamy caramel. Definitely have to coat fast but stuck beautifully and cooled in about 30 seconds to set down so I could do the next one.

Love this recipe! I poured boiling hot water over my apples while they were in a strainer instead of putting them in the boiling water for a couple of seconds and it worked great! I didn't have a candy thermometer, but dropping the caramel into the cold water worked perfectly for telling when to take it off the heat! Something I found while coating the apples, is that the ones that I coated first had a lot more caramel slide off. To fix this I coated the apples and then put myself somewhere cold while spinning then upside down slowly so the caramel hardens while on the apple and less slides off once placed on the tray.

These were easy to make and very delicious! After the caramel set I followed with melted bittersweet chocolate and finished them off with Heath, chopped candy corn or a white chocolate drizzle.

Maria gave some great tips.  Whenever I make caramel, 248 degrees always makes it too hard so I take it to 245 and it turns out perfect every time.  I make candy every few months and as a result, I have stopped using a regular candy thermometer and only use digital now.  Takes out the guesswork.  Had no issues with sliding caramel, until the last 2 apples.  Reheating it in the microwave seemed to help get it hot enough to stick to dip the last of them.

This recipe requires moderate baking/cooking skills. I got frustrated a lot trying to get the caramel to stick; however, once I did it was smooth sailing. I didn’t try any but I heard they were delicious.

My mother's recipe I've shared with many and you just can't be beat!  It's good for all kinds of caramel recipes and fool proof really!  Her recipe has you mix the brown sugar with the butter mixing well then add Karo (or corn syrup) mixing thoroughly together.  Slowly add the Sweetened Condensed milk and stir til soft ball stage or as instructed here.  I think mixing like this helps it to cook faster.  
I wondered where my mother's recipe came from and tried to find the source and here it is on ALLRECIPES!

Recipe worked great.  I washed the apples in cold water and then dried them well.  Stuck the sticks in and stuck them in the fridge.  I made the caramel by the directions but added a pinch of kosher salt....just for balance not salt taste.  I may have taken it over the temp a bit, but not to the point of being hard candy.  They were Delicious and the kids loved em!

Tip: careful with brown sugar! I made this recipe with white sugar 5 times, each batch was amazing, thick and flavorful and didn't slide of the apples. 
Last time I tried using brown sugar and the caramel curdled :( it still tastes good but looks horrible, with lumps. After some research found that sometimes molasses in brown sugar cause milk to curdle.

Love this recipe.  The first time I made it I think I cooked it a bit too long, and then let it cool too long. It was very thick and a little too hard once on the apples. It had to be warmed up a bit before cutting. The second time I took it off at about 245-246 degrees and dipped apples once the bubbles subsided. PERFECT!! Everyone loved them, young and old!

We loved these! A friend told us where to find the recipe after she brought some over, so my kids and I tried these tonight. We don’t have a candy thermometer, so I used the water trick, and I’m still not sure I got that 100% right. The caramel tasted unbelievable, but it did pool considerably at the bottom of the apples. For most of them, I went back over the apples with a second try after the caramel had cooled about 15 minutes. Ours definitely did not set up too quickly, even though it does have a nice thick texture. After I refrigerated the apples for 15 minutes, I pulled them back out and used my hands to pat the caramel back on them  it was still pliable. Then we sliced and ate the apples. The caramel had to be held onto the slice, but they were so unbelievably delicious no one minded. Several of them we sort of frosted with melted chocolate chips after we pulled them out of the fridge, and I think as the chocolate cools and sets it may hold the caramel in shape better. I was nervous about burning the caramel on the stove, so it took me about 35 minutes of stirring and boiling at medium heat. Don’t worry if as you’re boiling the caramel, darker flecks appear, like little brown crumbs in the caramel. That happened with mine, but they cooked back out by the time I was done. My kids and I all thought this was five stars!!

Perfect and so much better then store bought caramel. The only thing I did differently was I used gala apples instead of Granny Smith. It only took 15 min to get to 248 degrees. This is a keeper.

Great recipe!  I've been making caramel apples for years and this recipe literally created my prettiest apples ever!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Caramel stayed put on the apples - no running at all!  And they tasted amazing!  I will definitely be using this recipe each and every time I make caramel apples from now on.

so good, We had too much, and ended up pouring the leftovers on a tray, lined with parchment paper and just ate pieces of caramel.

These worked out perfectly and were delicious.  I added boiling water to the leftover caramel and turned it into pancake syrup.  Delicious and wonderfully soft and chewy.

This recipe was spot on. Delicious! Amazing. Follow it exactly and use a candy thermometer. It took about 36 minutes for me to get to 248 degrees. You have to be ready to move fast when the temperature hits 248. Getting the nuts to stick was tricky. The flavor is so yummy. Real caramel.

Absolutely easy and no problem - just make sure you follow the directions, and an added tip is to refrigerate them also after boiling them in water and drying them!  I covered them VERY QUICKLY with any toppings I had - pretzels, peanuts, Maldon Sea Salt - though the chocolate chips started to melt a bit!  Great!

The caramel is delicious. Mine got a little dark and hard. But I'm fine with that cause it tastes like score bar toffee. A couple things I might change next time so it turns out better are:
1) Use white sugar not brown, and
2) Add a half cup of water so that the sugar cooks more evenly.
I have a ceramic stove top that gets very hot, so it was ready in ten minutes. I'm gonna try it again at a lower heat next time.

2 stars because the caramel tasted delicious, however, the caramel slid right off of the apples. ended up letting it cool and drizzle on top of the apples.

I make hard candy apples all the time so i dipped them in boiling water with 2 cups of apple cider vinegar. Only about 8 secs to remove the wax. I used a silicone mat instead of parchment paper so that i wouldn't have a puddle of caramel. Be sure to bring your mix to 248 (soft ball) and dip quick if not your caramel will not stick to your apples

If you want stickier caramel, lessen the amount of corn syrup. A Tbsp or two so will do. The flavour can't be beat though!

I give this caramel 3 stars because it hardened TOO quickly. I followed the recipe to a T, did not scold the caramel, yet it was already stiffening before I could dip my apples. Also, the caramel was too hard to enjoy eating.

This was absolutely delicious. This was also my very first time EVER making caramel--or anything that required a candy thermometer, and it turned out perfectly! I even forgot to add the vanilla and no one even noticed. I did use DARK brown sugar so the caramel would have rich flavor, maybe that's why I didn't notice. You do have to be patient to get the temp up to 248 and on my stove it took about half an hour of stirring and standing. I used the leftover caramel to dip big pretzels in and drizzled chocolate over. Yum! I would definitely make again.

I didn't change a THING, and the caramel stuck to my apples perfectly, and tasted amazing! As the caramel set up more, I even drizzled more caramel on the apples. And, wrapped what was left in waxed paper. PERFECT caramels!

Ok so I found a very similiar recipe online from taste of home website, only it had 1/2 cup butter and 1 tsp vanilla, I like the idea of cutting down some calories, so delish! Toasted some pecans and salted them and did some with peanuts and drizzled with chocolate. Had some left over caramel as expected as you need enough to dunk them. I put the remaining in a pan and made soft caramels :)

Used dark brown sugar and a mixture of dark and light corn syrup because that's what I had on hand. So delicious and fairly easy but it definitely didn't take 25-30 minutes for the caramel to come to temp so just keep an eye on your thermometer. I will never go back to melting store-bought caramels for apples nor will I bother experimenting with any different recipes. So good!

I loved the look of these apples, and they were very easy to make. I thought that these apples would turn out great with their exceptional look and consistency however, when I bit into one Apple it was extremely hard, and unbelievably sugary.

I'm not sure why the recipe tells you to dip the apples in boiling water??  The caramel will stick better if you chill the apples thoroughly first.

First time making caramel apples. I did t have candy thermometer think I overcooked it. But  other than that followed directions it worked beautiful, it does thicken fast and had 3 kids all wanting to help. I need to practice getting it on apples better less sloppy but it stuck no issues. Mine didn't even cook 25min. Very tasty too. Will be keeping recipe.

Whew! After years of sub-par caramel apples and weeding through "buy caramels and melt them" recipes, this is the one for us! Two of the tips that really helped: dip the apples immediately and keep the caramel up to temp. And dump the leftover in a buttered pan. Caramels for later!

I followed the recipe exactly except I made half the amount. I happened to have 1/2 can condensed milk in the fridge that I needed to use lol! This tasted absolutely great!! Best caramel apples I've ever made!!

I was very impressed with how this recipe turned out! This is the first carmel apple recipe I've seen that doesnt use pre made carmel. I LOVE it. I would deffinetly make these again.

not sure what happened, but mine burnt to the pot before it even reached 215 degrees!  Had it on 4 on the stove, so slightly less than medium heat. I realized it was burning at the bottom right away so I didn't stir it further, and poured it in it's soft state into a pie plate and sprinkled with chopped nuts and grated chocolate so I can use it as an apple dip instead.  A little disappointing since all the apples are ready and have the Popsicle sticks in them.  :(   Guess I will make candy apples for the kids with those.
