The rolls turned out beautifully, light tender crumb. I proofed my yeast with the water and sugar before adding the other ingredients, mixing it by hand and not with a mixer, I also used half all-purpose flour and half bread flour. I only had active yeast, not the rapid rise, so I allowed an hour or so for the first rise, then gently formed a log and cut 12 pieces with my bench scraper and loosely placed them in the cake pan then let them rise another hour. Love the way they turned out, next time I will add a bit more salt, but other then that wonderful!

This recipe was so easy and yummy! I used the dough hook attachment on my Kitchen Aid mixer for the kneading.  I made two changes to the recipe.  First, instead of a muffing tin to cook them in I used a pie plate.  I weighed the separated dough on a kitchen scale to make sure they were all about the same, (a little over one ounce each) and spaced them out in the pie plate to rise.  Next, I brushed the tops with melted butter before putting them in the oven.  When they were done, they were golden, moist, and pulled apart (plus they looked like I bought them at the store).  My mixer makes the kneading so easy, and with the rising time being so quick, I will make these for dinner on a regular basis, and not just for special occasions!  Loved this recipe!!!

Quick and easy dinner rolls! Good flavor and hearty texture; my family loves these rolls. To add variety, I also brush with melted butter before cooking, and then sprinkle chopped rosemary and sea salt on top of about half the pan of rolls. Other good toppings are fine grated Parmesan cheese, poppy seeds, or sesame seeds.

These did not work for me... I followed the recipe EXACTLY even using the same brands, and they just would not rise. I have never had a problem with rising before, even at altitude, but I usually mix the yeast in with liquid first before adding to mixture. Next time I would dissolve the yeast in with the warm milk mixture and then add that to dry ingredients. As is, these only came out like little balls about 1.5 inches in diameter, not enough for two people! These also are a little sweet but bland, I would reduce the sugar and maybe add a little more salt or some herbs. Won't use these again.

These were the best dinner rolls I've ever made- so fluffy and soft, with just the right amount of sweetness, not too much. I used my KitchenAid dough hook to knead them for 6 minutes. I brushed them with a little melted butter before baking and again when they came out of the oven. I baked them in a Pampered Chef stoneware deep-dish pie pan (buttered); the bottoms of the middle ones didn't brown, probably because of the pan, but they still tasted fantastic. I made them at lunch time - we were going to have them with dinner tonight, but we tore into them and ate every single one of them up right then & there! Good thing I still have plenty of time & ingredients to make another batch in time for dinner...

These were about as good as the packaged kind you see rolling around Walmart at Thanksgiving time.  Had to use quite a bit more flour - probably another 1/2 to 3/4 cup - as dough was incredibly sticky and virtually impossible to kneed for the alotted time.  Next time will try and knead with KA as someone else mentioned.  If you're like me and use a scale, I ended up with exactly 1# of dough which evened out to a little over 1 1/4 oz per roll.  I'd probably shoot for 10 next time at 1 1/2 oz instead of the 12 rolls.

Fabulous dinner rolls that are quick and easy to make! Light, fluffy and just plain good - what more could you ask for? Plus, I have to admit warm dinner rolls are hard to resist. I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer with the dough attachment to make easy work of the kneading. I brushed these with melted butter before baking and the result was wonderful. You could easily add a variety of herbs or top with Parmesan cheese and change the recipe to suite your tastes or to compliment your meal. Great recipe!

I admit, I love to bake but I had yet to make yeast rolls. This recipe was simple, easy and turned out ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! This will definitely be my go-to roll recipe. Sweet but not too sweet, soft and fluffy. YUM!

These turned out really good!  I melted about an ounce of Dill Havarti with the milk and butter, and added powder garlic.  It gave them a nice flavor!

Love this recipe.  It is so easy and simple. I followed it exactly (with the exception of rapid yeast, I only had instant).  It's an easy to work with dough that turns out perfect every time.  I've also used this same recipe for making garlic knots and cinnamon rolls.  I would totally recommend this recipe any time.

I really love these rolls. I was a bit upset at first because they did not work for me until I realized I was using regular and not Rapid Rise Yeast. They turned out perfect and melt in your mouth. If your's do not rise, that's probably the reason why.

Love these rolls, make them alot for my family.  I use to never get dinner rolls to turn out because of over heating my wet ingredients or never rising dough.  My sister told me this trick, just use tap water as hot as you can get it, don't warm it on the stove if it's to hot it will kill your yeast. With this recipe, I do warm it on the stove because of the milk, but just enough  enough to put my finger in with out burning it, it should be very warm not scalding or hot. (like warm to hot tap water) If I over heat it I leave it sit for a bit til it cools off enough that a can test it the same way. Just a helpful tip, if you can't get them to rise.  I do this everytime now and they always turn out great.

I just made these rolls for dinner and all I can say is "Wow!"  They were delicious as well as simple.  I actually simplified this recipe further by putting all the ingredients in my bread machine and using the dough cycle.  I left all ingredients the same and followed the instructions for heating the water, milk and butter.  I put all the liquid ingredients in first, followed by the dry and then put the yeast in last.    Once the dough was done, I followed all other instructions exactly.  The whole family loved them!  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

This has become a family favorite for making dinner rolls when I don't have the time to make traditional ones.  Very easy recipe to follow for a novice (Me!!) bread maker.

Very easy, straight forward recipe. I proof the yeast out of habit, which may help for those that are not using "instant yeast".
I sometimes double the recipe and use half for cinnamon rolls- get dinner and breakfast out of the same recipe. :-)

These had a good flavor but they are not as fluffy and they should be. You really need to proof the yeast, even fast acting yeat, for at least 5 minutes.

These rolls, for some reason, didn't taste as good as I thought they would.  I doubt if I left any ingredient out, but I'll try it again to make sure.  Thanks for this one.

My family of 4 devoured these!!! After trying many of the bisquit/roll recipes...These are by far my favorite. I let the dough rise next to my wood stove and drizzle melted butter over them before putting in the oven. Moist, tasty...absolutly YUMMY!!!

Nice, light rolls..just like you would expect from a homemade, yeast roll!  Very easy to make.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to do the mixing and kneading before I let it rest.

Very good rolls.  My family of 4 wiped out a dozen of these in minutes.  I have 4 batches of them rising right now as I'm writing this.

These were amazing!  I served them with Thanksgiving dinner, and my husband can't stop talking about them (or eating them).  They are slightly sweet--much like a Hawaiian roll--and very mild, so they are perfect for topping with Thanksgiving leftovers like cranberry sauce and turkey.  I made them almost exactly as written, except that I used hemp milk and Smart Balance Light in place of the milk and butter (to accomodate dairy allergies).  I also used white spelt flour instead of AP (wheat allergies).  As far as the recipe itself, the only change I made was to proof the yeast with the water and 1 tbs. of the sugar for 10 minutes before adding it to the dry ingredients (along with the warmed milk and Smart Balance).  I also used my stand mixer and dough hook instead of kneading it by hand, which took about 5 minutes total.  These came out light, fluffy and perfectly golden brown--exactly the dinner roll I was looking for.  Fantastic, easy recipe!

Loved these rolls - they had a hint of sweetness to them.  Excellent and quite easy.  I don't buy rapid rise yeast, so used my traditional active dry and let it proof how I normally do.  So nice to have fresh rolls with dinner every once in awhile!

These were fantastic.  They were so easy to make and turned out light and fluffy.  Made exactly as the recipe instructs and baked for 20 minutes.  They were just sweet enough with no overly yeasty flavor and were still moist and fluffy the next day.   Will definately make again.

THE BEST ROLL RECIPE...ever. :) Sometimes I'll substitute half of the flour with wheat flour, and they turn out wonderful.

I too used regular dry yeast since I did not have RapidRise yeast and used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook.  I simply let the buns rise longer than the recipe called for and baked.  The buns were awesome and my husband could not stop eating them.

I made in the bread machine on express bake. I added all the wet ingredients first and yeast last (per directions of my machine) I did have to keep a keen eye on wetness and added quite a bit more flour. Tasted great, didn't fill the whole bread pan but that's expected! Also used Rapid rise yeast.

These rolls were fantastic! I made them as a side to a sphagetti dish when I had a friend over for dinner and she could not stop raving about them. They were heavenly soft and fluffy. Definitely making these again.

These were good, nothing exceptional, but I think I may have treated the yeast wrong as it didn't rise as well as it should have.  Could be the area we live in.  I will try again.

We've been enjoying these rolls so much that today I decided to make a loaf of bread with the recipe. I used all of the same ingredients and placed the loaf in a loaf pan for 22 min at 375. Perfection! We've been eating sandwiches for every meal just because we want this delicious bread! Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

OMG... these are soooo good! I used these to make jalapeno cheese kolaches (which is a glorified hot dog pig in the blanket) they came out big, fat and wonderful. I followed this recipe exactly, only I didn't have rapid rise yeast, only active dry yeast. So, to speed up the rising process, I heated my oven a bit to warm it and turned it off.  After I kneaded the dough and let it set the 10 minutes or so, I wrapped my kolaches, placed in a glass baking dish, covered with foil, and set them in the warm oven (turned off) for 10 - 15 minutes to rise. Then I pulled off the foil, cranked up the oven to 375, and baked for 20 minutes until golden brown... My kolaches are the bomb! I had a bit of leftover dough, so I made 2 plain rolls, just to see how they are as just plain rolls, and to me, they taste as good, or better than store bought rolls, could use a bit more salt though.... This ones a keeper!

This recipe is delicious. The rolls are slightly dense and still light. Great with soups, stews, fried chicken or just butter and honey. I made these rolls while visiting family out of state. I doubled the recipe and there where no rolls left. My aunt said they tasted just  like the rolls her grandmother used to make.

These were excellent, and so easy to make! It was last minute before Christmas Dinner, and I realized I had no potatoes. Nowhere was open to get potatoes, but I still wanted a starchy sort of thing, so I thought I would try my hand at making rolls! They turned out perfect! 
The only problem is I will have to keep myself from making these all the time now and devouring them!

I followed this recipe exactly and found these rolls to be tasty and beautiful. The texture is reminescent of those soft, homemade schoolhouse rolls-- tasty, but not exactly healthy. I'll try this next time with white whole wheat flour with some added gluten. For an old-fashioned treat, these rolls are delicious & easy to make.

I prepared this recipe a little then as written but kept the ingredients the same. I did not have RapidRise yeast, only active dry yeast so I bloomed the yeast in the water, milk and sugar then mixed that into all the other ingredients. Knead for about 8-10 minutes. Cover and let rise for 1 hour. Shape into balls and let rise for another hour. Baking degrees and minutes are the same. They turned out beautiful, soft and delicious!

This is a great, simple recipe... I prepare my dough a little different though. I combine the warm milk, water and sugar with the yeast until it foams, then I add most of the flour and salt, and mix it together in my mixer, adding extra flour a little at a time until my dough pulls away from the bowl all over. Then I add the butter last and knead it on high for 5-10 min. I really think waiting to add the butter last makes these soft and fluffy. I've made them several times this way and no one believes they're not store bought the first time they try them! I do think they're better with a little less sugar but that's just my preference, they're good either way.

OMG! These are the best dinner rolls I have ever made, and I have tried SEVERAL recipes. I just took them out of the oven, and immediately went to my computer to write a review. These rolls are sooo light and delicious. This recipe is a keeper, for sure. I did use active dry yeast; proofed yeast in warm water with a half teaspoon sugar; melted butter in milk along with 1 teaspoon salt. One egg was also used. The rolls are not real sweet- used the 2 tablespoons as recipe stated. Baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Brushed on butter halfway through baking and again at the end of baking. I will makes these again. Love, love, love these rolls! OMG, sooo good! Winner, Winner. Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe as an egg free dough to make cinnamon rolls (egg allergy in the house).  It was outstanding.   I used my bread maker on dough only, exactly two cups flour and the bread machine yeast-- look at the equivalent amount to an envelope printed right on the jar.   (I think its 2.25 tsp.)   Perfect dough.  Will most definitely use over and over.  UPDATE 6/17/16:  Still making this awesome dough, tonight as intended--dinner rolls.  Still my perfect go to dough for any kind of bread item.   Used bread machine yeast and my Zo breadmaker on "quick dough," then portioned into rolls, let them rise for 30 minutes, then into a 350 oven for exactly 30 minutes.  I literally am in another room of the house avoiding the kitchen simply because I don't want to continue to eat more rolls tonight.  So good.

I didn't have instant yeast so I changed rising times accordingly. Also, I dissolved the yeast and half the sugar in the warm milk mixture. I used a bit more flour than called for but there are so many variables in flour that I always look at the amount in recipes as a guideline.

Out of everything I cooked this year for Thanksgiving, these were the star of the show.  So easy, and so good.  I doubled the recipe, used my stand mixer, let the dough rest in the mixer bowl, shaped the dough into balls, and used 2 round cake pans for the rising and baking.

I don't mean to be mean with the two stars.  I put my rating at two so others may use the method I stated below when the rolls don't "rise:" Based on the lovely photo of your rolls, I soo wanted this recipe to work out!  I, however, experienced much the same as Cooksfor5 who stated that her rolls simply would not rise.  Because it is January in Phila., PA, my kitchen is somewhat cool.  When checking on the rolls after the 30-minute rise time, I noticed that they had not risen.  I removed the rolls from my cool, dark oven and cut the oven on the pre-heat cycle.  When the oven reached 100 degrees, I cut it off and placed the rolls back in.  After about 12 minutes, I checked to see if the rolls had risen some.  Sure enough, they had.  I am leaving them in for another 10 or so minutes to see if they will rise more.  Here's hoping they do because, again, they look so delicious in your photo.  Wish me luck!

I was searching for a good dinner roll recipe. After two not v. successful attempts with different recipes I tried this one - rolls came perfect and I didn’t change a thing (except yeast brand). I made them twice so far for two different parties and rolls disappeared in minutes both times. Made them small (a “two bites” size). Also one batch sprinkled with some Parmesan cheese. Will make them again and again. Thank you v.v.v. much.
PS: I used my bread maker to make dough.

Really great and really simple directions. I could definitely see myself making these in the future. Next time I would like to see how Wheat flour works in this recipe.

These baked up just like Fleishman's original picture here. I thought that an 8" round pan would be too small, but 12 rolls, tightly placed, made perfect sized dinner rolls that rose nice and tall.

so easy and turned out perfect.  I ran the dough cycle in my bread machine, divided them into 12, then put them into an 8 x 10 casserole dish and let them rise again.  store bought no more!!

This recipe has to be the easiest and tastiest roll recipe ever! I kneaded the dough in my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook for 5 minutes. If you are using a mixer for kneading, you can usually cut the original kneading time in half. After 20 minutes in the oven I had fluffy, golden-brown picture-perfect rolls. This is the only roll recipe I will use from now on!

Wonderful recipe, I used every single ingredient as instructed but used my Kitchen Aid to knead the dough for about 7 minutes or so. If you are not used to handling though, make sure you powder your hands with some flour so it doesn't stick to your skin while shaping the bread balls. I have to admit that they were not as fluffy as I wanted them to be, they had a biscuit type of texture so that's why I gave it 4 stars. I will be proofing the yeast next time to see if they come out fluffier.

I just made these rolls tonight and they were just OK! The yeast flavor is not popping as I thought it would be. I have never made rolls without eggs! and they weren't as light as some of the reviews stated.  I might make them again, but I would like to try something else.

These are easy enough, but they sure don't pack the flavor I wanted. Bummer! Fun to make and quick as well. I will be experimenting with these because they have unrealized potential...

The problem with this recipe is that it doesn’t have you proof your yeast - it doesn’t give the yeast a chance to activate because it has you add all the wet ingredients and all the dry ingredients at once. Instead, make sure the combined warm liquids are between 105-120 degrees, then add the yeast. Let it sit for five minutes before you add it to the dry ingredients. Or, just follow another recipe that has you proof your yeast first. I followed the recipe by the ‘t’ and was sad to find after all that work, they didn’t rise and were very dense (although the flavor was good). Then, I followed another dinner roll recipe that had me proof my yeast and was very happy to see them get nice and fluffy!

I made these for dinner tonight and they were fantastic.
I didn't use the rapid rise yeast....I just had the regular yeast.  After I kneaded the dough, I let it  sit in the covered bowl in the oven for an hour.  Then I weighed the dough and cut up into 12 pieces each weighing the same amount.  Put in a 9 in cake pan sprayed with cooking spray and covered with dishcloth and let sit for an hour in the oven .  Put melted butter on and baked at 375 for about 25 min.  Covered with melted butter again.  They were soft and chewy and delicious.  First time I ever made dinner rolls and it was so easy.

This recipe was awesome. Simple. Easy quantities (I hate when recipes call for 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons flour, for example.) 

I brushed with butter before and after baking and sprinkled with a pinch of salt on top. 

The rolls were golden, fluffy, and so delicious we ate every. last. one.

Was looking for a simple recipe and this delivered. I didn't have any packets of rapid rise yeast so instead used 2 1/4 tsp of the original active dry yeast and adjusted my rise times. Did an egg white + water wash and they came out beautiful.

I only had active dry yeast,  so I proofed the yeast in the water/milk and sugar until foamy, then added the dry ingredients and the butter and mixed it all together in my stand mixer. I let the dough rise once for an hour, then shaped into rolls and let rise for another half hour and baked. Oh my goodness. These are the best rolls I have ever made. They are light and fluffy and delicious. I made a double batch and formed them into slightly larger rolls for sandwiches. I will be making these frequently!

I only gave this 4 stars because , If my mom ran across this it would  her off. I'm an Executive Chef,  Although I create disserts, I leave the bread to the bread makers. This was a fine recipe. did not do anything diff.  This is an easy roll recipe to start early and have ready for dinner.Bragging  rights for  home made!!

I let the yeast get good and foamy in warm water with a bit of sugar before mixing it all up. I also cut the sugar in half and added about a half-teaspoon of Penzeys Mural of Flavor spice. After baking, I topped 'em with olive oil.
The rolls were deliciously fluffy and flavorful!

This recipe didn't work for me. They just never rose, despite waiting double the time. I baked them anyway. They had good flavor but because they never rose, they were extremely dense.

First off, I want to say thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us. Wow, we love them. We make all kinds of rolls with these, we make pizza rolls with meat, cheese, and even bread with this recipe. Amazing! I have tried so many recipes before this one and this was the first one that I had success the very first time. I am new to this whole bread making thing and have tried about thirty times with other recipes before trying this one. I wish I hadn't wasted my time with these other recipes, but I guess that is how we learn, by making mistakes. I kept trying these old recipes over and over, hoping if I changed something or needed the bread more or did something different it would work and I kept getting the same result, dense bread; tasty, but dense. I really think it is the temperature of the milk mixture that makes it rise properly. I do have to let it rise twice the time to get them just right and I do not use the full amount of flour (almost, but not quite; I am sure it is just a guideline). I quadruple this recipe and put one envelope of yeast in. However, this time I am trying two envelopes and seeing if they rise faster, but I was told you only need one tbsp of yeast no matter how much you double a recipe.

I changed the recipe a little bit to my liking, and made only half of the recipe since it's just the two of us. I proofed the yeast with the milk, water, and sugar. Then I added only 3/4 cups of flour, because sticky dough=lighter rolls. I didn't make any other changes besides that, and they turned out great!

Made this tonight with the only variation being in rise times...I was in no rush so I let the first rise go for 1hr, then formed the rolls and let them rise for another 30mins. Brushed with milk and sprinkled some poppy seeds on top. Cooked for exactly 20mins. They came out perfectly...soft and fluffy. The are definitely on the sweet side, which is fine by me for a dinner roll. I think you could play with the recipe plenty...mixed italian herbs....bacon and cheese etc. I'll definitely use it again.

Truly a classic roll in every way.  They are easy to make and have a perfect texture.  I used my KA to work the dough.  These would be great for sliders/mini sandwiches as someone else may have suggested.  If you need a yeast roll that doesn't require alot of time and fuss, this is the one to go to.  Will definitely make them again.

This recipe was so easy!!  I loved it i have been trying out different bread recipes trying to find that right one and I think this is it.  When the dinner table was all set and food down I had moved the rolls from the pan to a plate my husband took 1 bite and asked if they were store bought!  This recipe went into my card immediately!!  I did as some other reviews and brushed with butter before hand and added a touch of honey as well and refreshed with butter afters as well.  They were soft and Chewy and not one was wasted!

Update to this review 11/7/2016: I made these again after not having made them over the Summer. I bought a Kitchen Scale in the late Spring, so this was the first time I've made the rolls since getting the scale. I converted all of the measurements into grams and it was completely worth it. The rolls were even better; lighter, more tender, more tasty, and higher rave reviews! I also used King Arthur all purpose unbleached flour this time which has been making a positive difference in my baking lately. But if you want some major positive results, convert the measurements for dry cups into grams. You'll get much more accurate measurements, and the dough will behave better. AND don't forget to make sure that your yeast is live. Proof it, proof it, proof it.  
*****************
4/19/2014
We love this recipe.  It's delicious, not too sweet, and satisfies every palate (even picky ones).  The texture is nice and soft, with a melt-in-your-mouth texture.  We bring this recipe to holiday events with high praise from everyone.  They've become a special request alongside my cheesecake. 

*I usually use bread flour and spritz the top with olive oil from my kitchen diffuser

For those saying that these are "bland", keep in mind that they are just dinner rolls, not some fancy artisan buns.  This recipe makes soft, mildly sweet rolls that are quick and easy to make.

I used active-dry yeast because that's what I had at home, so I had to change up my method a bit... I let the yeast proof in the warm liquids and sugar for 10 minutes, then added the flour/salt mixture. I did all the mixing and kneading in my stand mixer.

I'm always crunched for time by the time I decide I want a bread to serve with dinner, and have to be very selective about ingredients.  This recipe requires virtually no forethought and only one rise.  They were soft, lightly sweet and delicious...not to mention gone!  Everyone loved them, no leftovers :)

These rolls turned out PERFECT! I made them according to the directions until it came time to knead the dough. I put my dough in my Kitchen Aid mixer and used the dough hook on high for 6 minutes. I had read in the reviews that another member did it that way. I have to say it was so easy and absolutely delicious!

I didn't have Fleischman's yeast but used my "go to" yeast.  These rolls were great.  I'm so glad that they make a small batch.  My other go to recipes make way too many.  

I made these to go with a good, southern dinner; ham, string beans, squash and pound cake for dessert.  Oh, it was just for me, myself and I and we all loved it.

Very simple. I heated milk, margarine, sugar, and 2tbl spoons honey to 110 degrees and then added yeast to make sure yeast was active. Egg wash before baking and basted with melted margarine and honey mixture after. Other than that, I followed the directions.

Absolutely delicious! These melt in your mouth rolls don't last long around our dinner table. I proofed my yeast, and used the packets instead of from a jar as find the yeast is fresher and recipes rise better.I also added an egg creating a fluffier roll.This ones a keeper, Thank you to the contributor.

These rolls are an easy quick dinner roll. They would be good for immediate consumption, but they don't stay fresh for long. I use another tried and true recipe for pull-apart rolls that I've made forever. They use the regular yeast, not the quick rise. I think my old recipe makes a superior, better textured roll. In future, I think I'll stay with the bread making methods I started with...  Of course, nothing could be better than freshly made homemade rolls, no matter what method!

It tastes good, and it's tender yeasty, but I wish I could get them fluffier.  Also, the tops are too hard for me(I glazed them with butter the first time before baking, and after the second time I baked them.  Both ways still produce a hard top(not burnt). My church gets these type of rolls from a restaurant and those are brown on the top, very very soft and yeasty with a slight sugar taste to the tops(which are soft and shiny) I am killing myself trying to recreate these rolls and I just can't get it, even though the flavor is just about spot on.  Trying to get the texture is getting to me, but I am determined not to give up.  Also, I went to a fleischmann's affiliate site called Breadworld that has the same recipe, but they added an egg.  I emailed them of my dilemma and asked them if the egg makes a noticeable difference.  Will see what they say...

Tasty rolls. Very easy. I did let the dough rise after kneading it for about 45 minutes since I had to run and pick up my daughter from school. Went really well with my potato soup.

I had never made bread before, and the first couple times I tried this recipe, it didn't quite come out - the taste was ok, but they didn't rise very much and the texture was kind of thick and chewy as a result. I finally found out what I was doing wrong - I wasn't getting the water/milk/butter mixture hot enough! I bought a food thermometer and got the temp. to 130 and they came out beautifully! This is probably obvious information for most on this site, but if you are like me and new to baking and having trouble with this, try buying a thermometer and getting the temp. exact! Also, try covering the bread with a damp cloth when you let it rise - apparently the dampness helps for some reason, according to another baker who helped me problem-solve on this one!

So delicious.  I cut the sugar in half, using organic cane sugar and dissolved the yeast in 1/8 cup water before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.  I then cut the water down to 1/8 cup to compensate for the yeast/water.  Next time I will double the recipe, since my husband ate over half of them by himself!!!

These were surprisingly really good! I am new to bread making in general, but can cook anything else easily. So I took the time to make these with a little extra butter to the tops of the bread once they were done and greased the bottom of the pan with butter. I also used the dough hook on my mixer to knead the dough. And the result was they were really tasty! The bottoms were nice and brown and buttery and so were the tops! My husband, son and I polished the whole pan off at dinner! They actually were comparable to Texas Roadhouse's rolls. Definitely a go to for dinner rolls!

These are so good and so easy to make! I made the mistake of not letting the dough rise for 10 minutes, but tasted good and weren't as pretty as the picture. I am making them again. They are a  staple in our home now.

This was a great recipe. I make at least every other week and are so light and fluffy. Sometimes I like to let them rise a little longer so they are more tender and soft. Tip: Kneading is the key. Make sure to knead for the directed amount of time. It makes a difference. MAKE THIS RECIPE!

Delicious. I found the instructions unclear in terms of the mixing. I used the paddle on my Kitchenaid and then switched to the dough hook. The next time I make them I will try the dough hook from the get go but I will definitely be making them again.

Amazing!! This was my first time to ever attempt homemade rolls, I followed the recipe exact, thermometer in the milk, water & butter to the exact temp. Turned out beautifully!! Family loved them! If I can do it with no cooking skills whatsoever, with a broken mixer, & a YouTube video on how to knead, then you can do it too!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

When I told my mom I was making dinner rolls for the first time ever with my new KitchenAid on Christmas she looked at me like I was crazy and told me I didn’t have enough time. (And she used to own a bakery) I showed her this recipe and she shrugged and told me to give it a try. Everything worked out super well and I had beautiful rolls. Personally I liked the rolls but I wasn’t in love with them(reason for 4 stars instead of 5) . But My partner on the other hand absolutely adored them and ate every single one that was leftover after dinner. Will definitely still make again!

These were a yummy, dense roll.  Maybe my yeast was old and I  I only kneaded for 4 min or so(?)  But, still was a very good roll and easy to make.

I only used 1 tbs of sugar and the yeast had been in the fridge since the first Christmas. They did rise but not what I expected. They tasted great and 17 min was almost too much.

So, I have not made rolls from scratch before, therefore I don’t know if what happened was my mistake or not. For that reason I am adding 1 additional star. These taste really good, but for me they came out more like a biscuit than a roll. Crunchy bottom, firmer texture with a softer center. I tried 2 batches and both came out the same. I followed everything exactly (so I thought) but there may have been some inferred things I overlooked

I ended up using a full 2 cups of flour and found it to be dry.  That being said I kept dripping a few drops of water into the mixing until I got the right tackiness.  They were a hit!

I have never made yeast rolls before and this recipe is very easy to follow and they turned out great. I made them into pumpkin shaped by cutting into the balls all the way around as I rolled them into balls. They turned out great. Also, made my own honey butter glaze for the top of them and stuck a pecan slice in the top to make it look more like a pumpkin. They are awesome!

Wonderful white rolls! Great texture! I made 8 rolls instead of 12 and they turned out great with the same cooking time.

My first time making rolls and this recipe is delicious! Brushed the rolls with melted butter, garlic powder and parsley. My daughter says I should make these everyday. Definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing this wonderful and simple recipe.

I made these for my Thanksgiving meal.  I was able to freeze dough balls a couple of days before our get together.  Took out of freezer the night before and placed in fridge.  Buns rose quickly when placed by warm oven.  Many compliments and will definitely use this recipe again.

This has become my family's favorite dinner roll. So easy to make whether you do it by hand or in the Kitchenaid mixer, they always turn out perfectly. They are easy to switch up by adding garlic, rosemary or other herbs and spices without a worry of something not turning out. Perfect every time!

This recipe is simple to make! It was my first attempt at making dinner rolls and they turned out great...maybe a little flat, but overall great! I just feel like they're missing a little something with the flavour.

12 dinner rolls out of 2 cups of flour? It made 5 roughly standard sized rolls for our dinner. Going back to our usual roll recipe and will just try whipping the starter as this recipe does for a lighter crumb. If you really wanted to stick with this recipe, double it to make 12 regular rolls.

Yummy yeast roll.
I did use active dry yeast and let it rise twice. Once after making the dough and once after forming the rolls. Turned out great!

I altered the recipe to work with powdered milk and vegetable shortening instead of butter; not out of preference but necessity, it worked out well.  I did end up adding 3 tbsp of shortening instead of the 2 and I kneaded by hand, the extra shortening made it easy to work with.

This recipe is quick and easy, compared to the traditional dinner rolls recipe I’d always used. The only reason I knocked 1 star off is because these aren’t quite as fluffy as the traditional ones, which may be the result of a lessened rising time. Overall, a great recipe as it cuts prep time in half, with almost the same results.

So yummy. Would have probably been 5 stars without my changes but I can never leave well enough alone. The alterations I made were: 
1) I added honey instead of sugar because I have heard that it makes baked goods softer? IDK if true.
2) I used all purpose flour and subbed about 1/4 cup of the flour with Vital Wheat Gluten. So did I just make bread flour? 
3) I don't know how much flour I ended up using. I started with 1 cup and just kept adding until the consistency was soft and no longer sticky. 
4) Once done, as others also did, I added melted margarine and sprinkled with salt; because salt and fat makes everything taste better- am I right?
At any rate these were so tasty I felt compelled to leave a review. Make these. You won't be sorry you did.

First time roll makers here! The first time I made these last week I was excited because I had never made rolls and my husband had gotten me a kitchen aid mixer for Christmas. They turned out great! But since it’s definitely not my first time eating rolls, I felt like they were lacking something... next time, I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and they turned out even better! I think that was the little extra something. I brush mine with melted butter just before they went in and right after they come out of the oven.. so happy with this recipe!

I did exactly as recipe said, and they worked beautifully.  The only thing I’d say is when I was mixing in flour it was probably just shy of the total 2 cups.  

Otherwise I warmed my oven slightly and then let them rise in there (winter time).

I'm not sure how to rate this recipe. My dough did not rise and the rolls were very heavy. Did anybody have theirs turn out looking like the picture shows. They sure are pretty. They actually don't look like yeast rolls. They look very fluffy.
It was probably my fault--does anyone have  tips on what to try??

I proofed the yeast first  and used my Kitchenaide Mixer as others noted. I also made a vegan version which turned out just as nice.

I don't know what I did wrong, if anything, but they turned out doughy and heavy. I doubled the recipe but wasn't able to add the last cup of flour because there would have been no moisture left in order to work the dough. I won't use this recipe again but there are plenty of others out there.

I used a different brand of yeast, but these didn't rise for me. I tried giving them additional time. They were still good, though.

This recipe is wonderful!  The fact that I can have tasty, beautiful dinner rolls in less than an hour is even better.  The texture is perfect, the taste is so good, much better than any store bought.  Like some others, I followed a yeast proofing process with water at 110 (my safe temperature).  My rolls took about 12 minutes to be completely done.

Turned out pretty good, and it was easy! Much faster than other bread recipes as well. This seems like a really versatile dough recipe to me. After making it, I could see myself using the same recipe for a cinnamon roll base or especially soft pretzels! I'm going to try it for cinnamon rolls this week. That being said, this bread is not good the next day sadly and becomes a sort of stale run of the mill tasting white bread, but I'm using my leftovers to make homemade stuffing so I'm not at all unhappy! They were great rolls that night with the chili I made for dinner... And now they will get to be delicious stuffing tomorrow night! I will also say that for mine I used a little too much flour by accident, so that may be part of why they dried out on me so quickly. But even with the extra flour I'm not disappointed in them. Flexible and versatile recipe- I like it!

I did a trial run of this one night for my wife and I for dinner and we put one roll in the refrigerator at the end.  

So I made them for Thanksgiving dinner and doubled it.  Everyone loved them and the left overs were all eaten over the next couple days.

FOllowed the exact recipe. Not working.... The dough turned out to be a bit of dry and not smooth even after 15 mins knead. And it only raised minimally, about 1.5 inches, dense balls...  Not my first time making dinner roll but first time failed...

I have a hit or miss when it comes to working bread.  I used rapid rise. Did not proof ahead as shouldn’t need to. I’ve done lots of reading and research on yeast and breads and I’m really not certain what I did wrong.   I made the copy cat Texas Roadhouse rolls the week before no problem. These Rolls didn’t look anything like the picture but were tasty. The dough rose as it was supposed to but my only thought is maybe it was over kneaded in my kitchen aid.   After this mishap I watched a YouTube video about rolls (she also has a blog... feast and farm check it out if you need help like I do) and she does it by hand and said if you’re just starting out don’t use your kitchen aid.  Will keep on trying.

2nd time making these roll and they were fantastic. I added sage & Italian spices to one batch & only Italian spices to the second to add some flavor. I brushed both batches with butter and sprinkled garlic salt over them to make them even more savory.

This is a simple recipe and quick unlike many other dinner breads I've made in the past. The taste is pretty decent but the dough is a lot stiffer than what I'm used to. I will likely make again with some modifications.

I followed the recipe exactly as it stated. I noticed the ball of dough was pretty small when I first let it rise. Once I put it in the baking pan, the balls were tiny. They could have made 9 decent sized rolls. But as 12 they were extremely small. I have always dissolved yeast in the liquid prior to mixing. So maybe this is why it did not rise as the original poster says it should. But if I do use it again, I will be adjusting it to dissolve yeast first and let rise longer.

These turned out beautifully.  I baked 12 rolls in a 9x13 pan. Gave them 40 min rise time in pan before baking. Very easy and delicious. Only thing I'd do differently is add a pinch more salt.

This makes a very, very, very small batch of rolls.  I doubled the recipe and got 15 smallish sized rolls. I'm hosting Thanksgiving dinner for 10 and will need to make another double batch to have enough.

These were DELICIOUS!!! I did a few things differently but I followed the ingredients. I let the yeast sit in the warm milk/water/sugar/butter mix till bubbly then added salt. I also used 50/50 bread flour & all purpose. But the rest of it I followed. Totally worth it, our family of 5 give it 5 stars!

Very good! I halved the recipe so I had 6 small rolls. I baked them in a loaf pan and stuffed the empty part of the pan with some tin foil (I didn't have any smaller pans). The rolls are SMALL! Each roll was about palm sized, so 6 rolls is perfect for 2-3 people. They came out very fluffy. I brushed the tops with melted butter when they came out and that really enhanced the taste. I think I would have preferred if they were a bit sweeter. I might have to bake them larger and with an egg wash on top next time.

Did not work for me and I made it twice. First time they were like little balls but did not look like the rest of the other photos. Did not taste great either. I followed the recipe just the way it was written. Second time follow the same recipe but yet came out wrong. Don’t know what I did wrong. Right now can’t give it any too many stars. Sorry. All in All I will try it again another time. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I had to double my recipe but followed the recipe exactly! At high altitude I added a couple of tablespoons of flour and baked it about 18 minutes. 
Rolls came out perfect! I bushed the tops of the rolls with a stick of butter while they were hot and that made rolls nice and shiny.

The recipe does not have too many steps and is not complicated, but my rolls are small, raw inside and took about 1 hour to bake.  How do I make light and fluffy?

I followed recipe the first batch and it did not turn out well. For the second batch I followed the ingredients, but I skipped departing the flour and using the mixer. I used a wooden spoon and my hands and I could already see and difference in the dough. The dough was the texture and constancy it should have been. When I let it sit to rise it worked. The first batch felt more like a flakey dough for something else not for rolls.

Excellent rolls. Fast and easy. Light and fluffy. We ate them with beef stew.  So good dipped in the gravy. Its so nice to know we can have these fantastic rolls so fast and don’t have to wait for hours (just 30 minutes) for them to rise and perfectly baked in 20 minutes. Thanks for this great recipe.

This recipe was awesome!  I made 2 batches in the cupcake tin today. Used them for BBQ chicken sliders. I used coconut oil instead of butter and added garlic butter when they came out of the oven. Instant fam favorite!

Great!  I’m not a baker but I was making queso stuffed monkey bread and it called for yeast rolls (frozen raw dough).   I bought a bag yeast rolls and of course they were already cooked so I had to figure out yeast roll dough.  This was EASY and not as scientific as I feared. I’m making again today and doing garlic knots! Thanks!

They were amazing, so light and fluffy!  I didn't have rapid rise so I used 1 T of bread machine yeast.  Very quick and easy and the timing was bang on. I let these rise in the oven with the light on. These will be a repeat, thanks for sharing.

These did not rise at all!  The dough was dry.  I made them as recipe directed but sometime has to be wrong with the directions.  No rolls this Easter.i

Super easy! Only made 8 rolls cos I like them a bit bigger for bun-wiches. Next time I’ll use a 9” round pan and rise for an extra half an hour so they’ll be fluffier. Brushed with butter before baking and a little more upon taking them out from the oven. Made a fresh ham and cheese sandwich.... yum!!!!

I had to use 1/3 c. less flour and rolling the dough into balls left them kinda misshapen and not smooth. I have better luck proofing yeast instead of using it dry in the recipe.

This was my second time trying to make this recipe. For some reason the dough would not rise. The rolls comes out flat, and they really didn't taste that great. Maybe I'll try them again for a third time. Hopefully it comes out better.

I didn’t have any milk...so just substituted with water. Despite this they came out fantastic. Don’t skip the 30 minute rising. Perfect for a family of 3 or 4 people. Went great with my crock pot cream cheese chicken & egg noodles! Otherwise for a large crowd I use Angie’s Perfect Rolls.

These were delicious! This was my first time making rolls, and they tasted great. They were denser than the store-bought ones, which is not a bad thing. The flavor was excellent. For some reason mine were done after 15 minutes, so I do recommend checking them early.

These were very simple to make and absolutely delicious! I only baked them for 15 minutes, but I suppose they could’ve used another couple of minutes. Moist, fluffy, buttery and yeasty. My dad proclaimed them, “better than biscuits!” And my four year old daughter ate two slathered with butter with her dinner.

This recipe is great for beginners like me! I would recommend adding the remaining flour gradually (by 1/4 cup) until the dough is barely sticky and easy to knead. The first time I made these I added the full amount of remaining flour and the rolls turned out a bit too dry.

They were kind of dense and didn't rise enough.  I even let them sit for nearly an hour to see if they would rise more.  The taste was still good, but they were small and not as fluffy as I would have liked.

I made this recipe twice. Both times they did not turn out well. I make bread every week and have done so for years. I will not make this recipe again and stick to the tried and true recipes that have worked for me in the past.

wow!   Easy to make, fast and just delicious.   I double the recipe and put them in a very large round (wedding) cake pan, because no matter how many I make, it isn't enough. And the doubling makes no difference to ease and yumminess.   They reheat nicely too for use with leftovers.

One tip...don't cover the rolls after forming and rising in the pan.  They formed much better this way.

As I was kneading this recipe I was convinced it would not turn out; the dough was stiff, and did not have much elasticity to it. I did not use a standing mixer, but rather mixed by hand. With little hope, I let the bread rise and it did actually do quite well! I made 6 instead of 12, the balls were big and slightly misshapen but fit the pan nicely. Once cooked, the dough was quite tasty, however it was a little dry, and not as dense as I would have liked. I believe dinner buns made with potato are more my style!

Amazing!! Few ingredients and very forgiving. I accidentally mixed the yeast, salt, and sugar with ALL the flour instead of just 3/4, only had Active Dry yeast, and accidentally boiled the milk, and they still turned out super fluffy and they taste SOOO good. I'm at high altitude, so they were done in 15 minutes. Definitely replacing my frozen rolls with this recipe.

Followed the directions exactly. No complaints. I wasn't blown away with the result but it was easy and relatively quick. Soft traditional dinner roll. Exactly what we were looking for to accompany a roast.

I made a beef stew to go with these. I did not allow enough time for  the dough to rise as I didn't fully read the recipe. They turned out great anyway. I also found that the dough got caught up in the beaters of my hand mixer so I ended up mixing the flour in with my hands. This may have also been user error ;)
I will definitely make this recipe again as it was easy to make and only makes a dozen rolls which is perfect for two or three people with a few leftover to go with the leftover stew

These rolls were the perfect texture, light and fluffy but there was not enough sugar. I did double the amount of sugar required for the recipe but there still was not enough for me. Also, after the 2 cups of flour were added, i still needed to about about a half cup more because the dough was too wet and soupy. Next time, I will add more sugar but overall this recipe is a good base recipe thats simple for dinner rolls. Thanks for posting.

Didn't turn out for me - they didn't rise and were hard as a rock. I don't know what I did wrong. :(

I used half and half in place of milk, but I can't believe that would be the reason these didn't rise. I won't be making this recipe again.

This was awesome!! Nice crust and soft and fluffy on the inside. I brushed butter , garlic , and green onion on one half and just butter on the other side. My house smells so good right now!

Instant yeast and doubled it to speed it along and have with supper.

I've been searching for a good bread recipe for a while. This is the fourth one I've tried, and it is perfect! They came out soft on the inside, crusty and brown on the outside, and completely delicious. A big hit with my husband--and he's a picky bread eater. I did have to knead it for a bit longer than ten minutes, and I mixed it with spoon and with hands as opposed to a mixer. It's a great recipe.

I am so happy with how this recipe turned out. It was a little too sweet, so I suggest just barely cutting the amount of sugar in the recipe. I was very concerned that these would not make enough, and unfortunately, my prediction was correct. The recipe was just barely enough for 11, and my rolls were all very small. I thought they might rise while they were set aside, but they remained the same size. Flavour was good, and beside the minor flaws listed above, I loved this recipe!

My very first time making any kind of yeast roll and I am so happy. They were delicious!!! I am getting ready to make them again for dinner. I am going to add a little more salt to my second batch...I think that is the only thing it may need.

These rolls turned out beautifully, if a tad on the sweet side!  
I didn't have quick rise yeast so I bloomed the dry yeast in the milk mixture before adding it to the floor mixture, letting it rise longer (about 30 minutes instead of 10 on the first rise) then used my mixer to knead the dough, everything else was exactly as written.
I will definitely make these again!

Made in a bread machine, only issue was 1st part was so watery it splashed all over.  Other than that the rolls came out perfect.  I baked in a shiny metal pan so I took them out a little early.

Very good!

This is a very simple recipe, and the rolls turned out very well.  I recommend this for quick rolls, especially if you do not have much time.  My only recommendation is that the dough may need more time to rise than indicated.  Make sure they are in a warm place.

Great basic roll recipe!  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 bread flour and they came out nice.  I made 9 total in an 8x8" pan.

Good yeast roll recipe. I did use "Ultragrain" (25% whole wheat) and they were good, but perhaps a bit too dense. I'll try AP flour next time. I selected this as it was egg free. Easy to follow directions and I used the Kitchen Aid with dough hook for the kneading. I would suggest possibly doubling the recipe might be a good idea as they do dissappear quickly.

I tried this recipe because I didn't want more than a dozen rolls.  I think one mistake I made was to place them in a 9x13 pan.  They don't rise enough to fill the pan.  The instructions say to use an 8" round pan and that would have been better.   Making eight rolls instead of a dozen might be better too.  The flavor is ok.  Pretty standard.  However, they go together easily and are ready for the table in about 90 minutes.

Most of the bad ratings on this recipe are yeast related, and thus it is not the recipes fault that some peoples did not turn out. THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE!!!

I followed the recipe except that I let the water, yeast, and sugar get foamy before doing anything else (I was too afraid they wouldn't rise properly). These came out absolutely perfect! I have never made rolls before because they always seemed like such a pain, but I will definitely be making these from now on. Way better than store bought and not too much trouble to make. Thanks for sharing!

I made it with pizza yeast instead of the suggested yeast and they turnd out hard and didnt rise at all.  I'm sure had i used the correct yeast it would have been better.

Great!  Thank you for sharing.  Made with rapid rise yeast and then regular yeast.  Both were great.

Great dinner roll recipe! I made this for the first time tonight and even after reading all the reviews, the only changes I made were letting the dough sit for an hour instead of 30 minutes after dividing.  I also made 8 hearty rolls instead of the 12 the recipe calls for and brushed the tops with butter before sticking in the oven. Because I live in Colorado too, I had to bake for an additional 8-10 minutes but that was nothing. Love this recipe, will definitely make again. Thank you!

Just okay.  Hard as a rock on top and doughy on the bottom.  The taste was fine.  Probably need to try and make it again.

Lovely easy recipe. The rolls have a hint of sweetness which makes them perfect for breakfast.  A sachet of yeast is equivalent to a teaspoon. I made this using my bread machine dough setting.

I've made this a few times, comes out great!

I times it by 1.5. I also double and proof my yeast and add 1 Tbs garlic powder and half of 8oz bag of shredded cheddar cheese, makes perfect Cheddar garlic rolls!!

The rolls tasted amazing! I learned that they are best fresh out of the oven. ?? The one flaw I noticed was that they did not rise as tall as I wanted, but that could have been my own fault. My family said they looked like store-bought rolls. All in all, they were a great success! ??

These rolls are fantastic!  Just pay attention to what kind of yeast you have, because active doesn't expand as fast as rapid rise.  I use active yeast, so I just let the dough rise an hour instead of ten minutes.

Dough would not rise for me. Maybe the temp on the liquid was too high? They were dense but edible hence the 3 stars.

Very quick and easy yeast rolls. Found it to be a little sticky to knead on the counter, so had to add additional flour, a little at a time while kneading, to get a smooth elastic ball. This produced a slightly denser roll than I was expecting, so next time I will cut back the liquid a bit. Otherwise delicious.

Outstanding. Everything about this is perfect...I doubled the recipe for  15 fat rolls in a Pyrex rectangular glass dish and had enough dough left over for a tin mini-loaf pan. I also sprayed tops before and after baking with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray for even browning.

I kneaded the dough with the hook on my KitchenAid. The dough was really easy to work with, though I may have needed a little extra flour. I accidentally turned my oven off midway through and the bottoms continued cooking, so the bottoms ended up burned when I turned it back on. Still, the taste was great. They maybe needed a little more rise time than 30 minutes - probably closer to an hour - but they were yummy. I also used about an extra half teaspoon of salt.

I tried this recipe for Easter 2016 and they were the best rolls I've ever made. They were soft and tender and the fact that it uses alot less fat  than most yeast rolls is a plus. I did let the dough rise 2 times. That is the only thing I changed. I gave it 5 stars even though I altered the rising time. Not sure if that is why some didn' t like it.

these rolls were so fast and easy to make.  I proofed the yeast in my milk before adding. Added everything to my Kitchenaid stand mixer and let it do the work.  I will definitely make these again. My family loved them.

Followed the recipe for the most part, substituted honey for sugar, used butter and gradually added the flour. Only needed about 1 and a half cups of flour and ended up with nice, fluffy rolls. Delicious right out of the oven.

I made these rolls exactly as the recipe describes.  The rolls were great--light, tasty and most importantly, from the moment I started assembling the ingredients to biting into the hot rolls, only 90 minutes had elapsed.

Seemed a little too yeasty to me, but everyone else raved and ate them up quickly!  I used a packaged yeast and proofed it in the warm water and sugar prior to mixing with other ingredients since that is what I am used to.  Perhaps that is where I incurred more yeast flavor than intended?  The texture of my finished rolls was so amazing though!  My mother in law even told me she was impressed... and that says it all.   Also, they cooked very quickly and evenly.  While the first rising wasn't as big as I thought it would be, my 2nd rising was quicker and better and they baked up perfect.

I need to be a good netizen and review these dinner rolls. I make them twice a week. My husband loves them and he's not a bread person. Everyone I've made them for just devours them. They're perfect as written.

Wow!!!! These are YUMMY!! I make a lot of bread, but my rolls have always been kinda dense, but not these! I will keep this recipe, it's nice to have a recipe that I can make in a hurry. I didn't use a mixer as I don't have one. So I mixed by hand :) I will have to keep my hands off of these until my husband and children get a taste lol.

This recipe is almost too easy! I've avoided yeast rolls for over 30 years (my last attempt produced NHL worthy hockey pucks) so I needed a recipe that was simple and fool-proof. I doubled the recipe and used my food processor and dough hook to make the dough, folded it out onto a kneading surface and hand-kneaded it per the instructions, and set aside to rise and rest for an hour. I also punched the dough down an extra time and let it rest before cutting it into twelve sections and letting rise for one more hour before baking for a perfect, large, fluffy, light roll. I will make these again and again!

This is the first dinner roll I have ever given a 5 star rating or any rating above a 2 star!  These came out perfect!  The only change I did was proofing the yeast with the water and sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients and I mixed it by hand.

Rating this at 4 stars as written (didn't find them moist enough for our preference especially next day, however adding in an egg and an extra 1/2 cup flour did the trick perfectly. I also always proof my yeast and used my bread machine on the dough setting. Now this is a keeper recipe!!  :-)

Perfect.  I put everything into my breadmaker, let the machine knead it and then rest for 10 minutes, and followed the rest of the instructions. They came out light, fluffy, and delicious. I'm considering trying the same recipe for hamburger or hot dog buns, as it came out so well for rolls.

These rolls were very easy to make! Quick to get going as a last minute idea.  My little men(3 and 5) were able to handle it really easily when using it outside the box as blankets for their cheesy dogs!
I used my KitchenAid to make these by putting the dry ingredients in first, then the wet. I used the paddle for the first part, and instead of turning it out to knead it, I just popped in the hook. Very simple while I got other things ready with the boys.

10 stars!! So freaking perfect and delicious! Make sure to brush the tops with melted butter before baking. Also, I had active yeast so I left it to rise for an hour.

I've made these twice.  Make sure you you the Rapid Rise Yeast.  Regular yeast will not work as I found out the first time I tried.  Once I bought the Rapid Rise Yeast I had no problem with there rising.  So yummy and easy to make.  I made using the dough hook on my mixer.  My family loved them.  Will definitely make again.

They tasted good, but we're very very heavy and did not rise much. Yeast was well within expiry.  I think next time I would proof the yeast with the milk and sugar before adding to flour.

Amazing results!! I am a great cook and a home professional baker of desserts but I'm still an amateur bread baker. These rolls were so easy and came out so soft like store bought. Very impressed. I believe less flour means more with this recipe. Thanks!!

My rolls turned out hard as golf balls. The only change I made is that I used dry yeast instead of instant yeast. But I let it rise first in tepid water with sugar. Even though I buttered the tops they were not shiny like the picture, the butter was absorbed instantly and left them dull again.

This is like my grandmother's except she used cake yeast and an egg. I have made these rolls many many times now with these adjustments. I add an egg when adding the 1/4 c. Flour. I transfer the dough  ball into my small mixer bowl with dough hooks that have been sprayed with PAM. After starting the kneading, i usually add 1 more tablespoon of flour. Knead with mixer for about 6 minutes. Spray dough with Pam, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes. turn on oven to 200 and put some water on to boil in a saucepan.Form 12 rolls in a 8 inch sprayed baking pan. Brush tops of rolls with melted butter. Cover with lightly sprayed plastic. Turn off oven. Place rolls in warm oven with boiling saucepan of water. Let rise for about 25-30 minutes. It usually works for me to let rise for 25 minutes and then remove while over is set at 375 degrees to bake. Remove plastic and saucepan of water.  Bake middle rack 18-20 min at 375. When done, remove and invert on cooling rack. Brush with melted butter or use end of a stick of butter. If left in pan after baking, bottom of rolls might become soggy with moisture. I usually cut a paper towel in an 8 inch circle and place in bottom of clean pan. Then I flip rolls back into pan for serving on table.

This is a great recipe and gets a long overdue 5 stars from this house... I tweak this recipe (the sugar and salt amount) depending on what the rolls are for and what we are having for dinner.  I also let the rolls rise longer than the recipe calls for. I make italian bread, garlic knots, regular dinner rolls, sandwich rolls, hoagie rolls... Shall I continue? All with this recipe. Love it!

Just made these: my apartment smells of butter and dreams. The texture is great but mine didn't come out as smooth as I hoped. Also, I would definitely add another half tsp of salt if using unsalted butter.

I made these rolls on the weekend. They were very simple to make. The texture of the rolls were perfect. What I could not get over was how sweet they were. I think if I make them again, I will try adding less sugar and a tiny bit more salt.

These came out just okay for me. They tasted extremely yeasty and were not as "toasty" as I was hoping. It was my first time making bread though, and it was pretty good.

Amazing recipe, the rolls are not too fluffy but are also not as dense as bricks, just right. The bottoms got a little brunt when cooking using the instructed temperature so I would recommend cooking at 350 for a slightly longer time. I will be making these very often in the future, love it!

I love the recipe as is! It has become my go to if I don't have time to make a loaf of bread to go with dinner! That said, I added about a tablespoon of garlic spread from Costco after the first mixing and then brushed with plain butter after baking and it was amazing!  Next time I will have to make 2 pans!

Great recipe!  

Some minor adjustments I made was to add an extra tablespoon of sugar and an extra teaspoon of salt.  Really found this helped the overall flavor.

I am trying to double the recipe now.  Wish me luck!

I made the recipe using exact ingredients.  The only difference is I did proof the yeast and add wet to dry ingredients.  The recipe was delicious!  I topped them with garlic and butter.  YUMMY!!  The kids definitely loved them too!  Will definitely make again.

Best homemade rolls ever!! Will never buy rolls again! 
The only thing I changed was a little of the flour - I used 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup bread flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Gives them extra flavor!  I've only made them twice so far, and had a little trouble with them rising, but next time I will try doing what other reviewers said and proof the yeast in the warm milk mix first.

I tried this recipe twice and it just doesn't work. One time I followed directions as written; the other, I proofed the yeast. Neither time did they rise well. Flavor was ok, but texture was halfway between biscuits and rolls.

I'm so glad I came across this recipe. I have never made my own dinner rolls before, but with this recipe I will be making them often. I only had 'bread machine' yeast in the house so I did proof it and  it worked great. The only other change was that I used coconut oil instead of butter and they were absolutely flakey and delicious! I baked them in my pampered chef pie plate as mentioned by another reviewer. I made 2 batches and they almost all went! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

A quick and simple roll recipe for family dinners. I followed the recipe exactly and used my KA with dough hook to knead the dough. They turned out light and fluffy.

I have tried this recipe multiple times. I have put basil in it, oregano, made garlic butter for the rolls, and each and every time they turned out incredible! These batches can easily be doubled without any problem. They can the frozen in airtight containers heated in the oven just a little and they are amazing! The one thing I did find, that is very important, is to make sure that the water, butter, and milk mixture is no more than 130 degrees. That seems to make all the difference in the world. I will be using this recipe again and again for years to come. My family loves

Outstanding!! 3 days later they are still soft and with just a few seconds in the microwave, they  taste like they just came out of the oven all over again. The best dinner roll recipe I've tried so far.

These were fabulous. My husband and  can't say enough. Best dinner rolls I have ever made.  Easy. Followed the recipe to the letter. I used my dough hook on my Kitchen Aid. I made them plain this time but I will use some seasonings next time , just to try something different. They are wonderful plain.I made them into balls and put three in each muffin tin. I made 12 cloverleaf  rolls. We could eat the whole pan.

Never made them before and they turned out awesome.  Better than I ever imagined.  Family at thanksgiving loved them and even after we put the couple left overs in the fridge over night and microwaved the next day they were still great.

This was a very easy and basic recipe for dinner rolls. They came out really good. I brushed it with some melted butter before baking. Came out golden. Very good. Will try next time as other reviewers suggested with different herbs and cheeses before baking.

I tried this today and was very disappointed as the rolls didn't raise like they should have and I followed the directions exactly.  They did have a good taste, though.

So easy and they turned out perfect!  I made mine twice as big and it only took half the time as my over was very hot from broiling my turkey just before.  But how wonderful to have fresh warm home made dinner rolls with your meal!

Addicting. Did not have rapid-rise yeast, so followed instructions as written, allowing 1 hr for first rise and 1/2 hr for second rise. Also don't have a fancy mixer, so all mixing & kneading done by hand. Came out fluffy, with the classic flavor I was expecting.

Absolutely delicious.  I changed only one thing and that was I subbed the flour with half bread flour and half whole wheat.  The rest of the ingredients I kept the same.  They turned out wonderful.  I folded them under into roll shapes and placed them in a 9x13 dish and let them rise.  They turned out light, fluffy and delicious!  Everyone loved them.  I'll be making these again.

This recipe is awesome. I fallowed it to a "T" and they came out perfectly. Only flaw: it only made 11. Next time i make these i'm going to have to double the batch. They didn't last 30 mins after they came out of the oven.

I don't give many recipes five stars.  This one deserves it.  I have been trying to find the perfect dinner roll recipe.  This one comes very close.

Best of all, I made it in my bread machine.  Put the wet ingredients on the bottom, the dry on top and turn it on.

When the cycle was over, I rolled the dough into balls and tranferred then over to my cast iron skillet to let them rise.

30 minutes later, I brushed them with melted butter and tossed them in the oven until browned on top.

These rolls are seriously delicious.

These rolls are super easy to make and SO yummy!  The only down side to them is that within about an hour they turn rock hard, so they are definitely just for making to with your meal and not save any for later.  Not that you COULD save any, since they are so delicious you will probably finish them all before thinking about it!

Oh my goodness! These are amazing! They tasted a lot like the Sara Lee ones, just better. I highly recommend them, and I will definitely make them again and again.
I did not have rapid rise yeast though, and used regular active dry yeast instead, took a bit longer, but so worth it. And I did brush them with melted butter after baking.

This recipe was so easy to make. I used my Kitchen Aid for kneading.I added italian herbs and garlic powder while kneading. I brushed butter on top with sesame and poppy seeds before baking. They came out looking like something from a bakery. YUM!

Very tasty. I used honey instead of sugar, let the rolls proof for 30 minutes, and brushed the tops with milk so they would be shiny before putting them in the oven. Turned out very good. My apartment smelled like a mom and pop restaurant!

This recipe could be easily adapted for cinnamon rolls, or herb/garlic rolls as well.

My husband made these, he used all the right ingredients, although we added parmesan and Italian seasoning to ours, however he only ended up needing half of the flour. So we used 1 cup of flour, and it worked perfect for us!

Too easy to believe! And just as TASTY! Made for my family on Easter and they were a huge hit. To make 12 rolls fit in a 9x13 pan (larger size than recipe), you'll need 1/3 more of the ingredients. For those not familiar with RapidRise yeast, it is different than "Active Yeast." Follow the recipe exactly when using RapidRise OR adjust your processes and timing to use "Active Yeast" (which will take longer). BUT you're not sacrificing taste using the RapidRise version.

Sooooo so good! I have to make these almost everyday because they never last more than a few minutes! Using this recipes ingredient measures though, I've only been able to get at most 11 rolls out of it, so I usually stick to about 10 so their a decent size. Go great with anything and just delicious!

Double Duty - I loved the dinner rolls, but I also use this recipe to make hamburger buns. Divide dough into 8 pieces, shape into flattened balls and lay on a cookie sheet. Bake - cool - slice. Better than store bought and the heartier texture holds up to juicy hamburgers.

I was upset with this recipe at first because I thought the rolls weren't going to rise. After giving them an hour to rise, I gave up and stuck them in the oven. There they finally rose some, and the end result was a little roll with a lot of flavor. I feel like they should have risen more, but they were still very good. We ate them with honey-butter. I followed the recipe this time, but next time, I'll proof the yeast first--as others suggested.

Just made these. I followed the instructions exactly up to the proofing. After shaping into 12 rolls,   I placed them in my oven on "proof".  It took almost an hour and 15 minutes to double in size.  Otherwise, this is a five star.

Great recipe! Light, flaky rolls even taste wonderful the next day.  Rolls came out perfectly with recipe followed as-is.  No proofing needed if liquids are at 120 degrees and using rapid yeast.  Did use kitchen aid for most of kneading, hand kneaded for about 2 minutes.  Rose beautifully on a covered, warm stove top.  I did only get 9-10 rolls with this recipe though.

I just took a pan of these out of my oven.  Prep was remarkably easy.  I used a different brand of instant yeast and unbleached flour.  The recipe made 12 rolls in a 8 inch pan although I considered using muffin tins instead.  Maybe I will do that or turn them into Parker House rolls the next time.  They were not too sweet as some doughs can be, and they rose very nicely. I might try another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of sugar the next time so that the taste more like my mother's recipe.  The rolls closely resemble the photo and I am completely delighted with them!

Made approx 500 grams of dough. I made 10 rolls at 50 grams a piece. This fit well into a 9" cake pan or pie pan.

excellent.  The family is ALWAYS asking for it.  Great as cloverleaf rolls too.  I just double the recipe and make sure I don't overwork the dough when kneading.  Cloverleaf rolls are made by placing 3 little balls in each section of a prepared muffin tin.  Such a treat !!

I decided to give theses a try remembering the ones my great grandmother used to make me. I made these with my two and four year olds. I followed the dirctions except i let them rise 30 mins the first go round and close to an hour for the second. The were delicious and almost all gone as sone as they cooled.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Easy, quick, and the a great light, classic dinner roll.  I made them yesterday to go with our Thanksgiving turkey.  Everyone raved.  I made them in my KA mixer with the dough hook, then hand kneaded for a couple of minutes just to feel the dough.  They rose nicely in the time the recipe said and just took about 10 minutes longer in the oven.

Success!  Be sure to use RAPID RISE yeast.  If you use active dry yeast you need to proof it before adding to the dry ingredients.  I brushed with melted butter and sprinkled on salt before baking.  They are so good right from the oven!
