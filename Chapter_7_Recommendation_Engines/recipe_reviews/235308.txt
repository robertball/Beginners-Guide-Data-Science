I've been skeptical of cauliflower recipes claiming to be as good as mashed potatoes, because of a failed attempt at a recipe several months ago. I decided to give this recipe a try after having some thing similar at a friend's house. This time was a home run! So good I at most of the dish in one serving! Yom!! The only thing in the recipe that I did differently was to use a food processor to mash and blend every thing together! Makes the consistency even more like mashed potatoes! I'm making this for a second time today!

I made this a couple weeks ago and added some milk and Parmesan cheese. I used a hand mixer and that was messy and it turned out just ok but I just made it again and puréed it in the blender with a half cup of heavy cream and parm again. It was amazing!!! Tasted just like mashed potatoes!!! I baked it just to keep it hot but it really didn't need it. Will be a staple in our home from now on but I'll just purée it closer to everything else being ready to keep the temp up.

Yummy substitute for mashed potatoes. Did make a couple changes. Used 1 clove minced garlic, 1\2 cup Greek yogurt, and baked at 400.

This potato substitute is excellent! I pretty much made it per recipe. The only thing I did different was add a bunch of green onions to the garlic & olive oil while it roasted in the oven. Outside of that, just follow the recipe. I didn't see any reason to add instant potatoes, after all, it was my intention to replace the starch with a healthy alternative. This is also a great way to increase your veggie intake! I Loved it and will definitely make it again!

It was a big hit.  Even my teenagers liked it. 
I roasted my cauliflower instead if steaming it so it wasn't quite mash but it was great.

I loved the roasted garlic in with cauliflower!.  I added some extra sharp white cheddar in the mix before I baked it just to add some smoothness to the texture, but it really didn't make it smooth!  but added some nice additional flavor.  I will definitely keep this on hand for a great side instead of potatoes!

I roasted the garlic and cauliflower and then steamed them together.  I didn't mash with a mixer... just chopped finely after cooking. It was yummy and great flavor!  Served with a chicken recipe with gravy and it was a great alternative to a starch.  Will make again!

I used truffle oil and it was amazing. My husband said it was as good as mashed potatoes. I might add some cream cheese next time.

Very nice! Changed mine up a bit by using the new Greek yogurt cream cheese and I added some snipped chives at the end.
