I've been looking for this recipe.  It is like my deceased mother-in-law, a lady that taught me to bake.  Thanks.

Definitely worth the (relatively small!) effort.  The dough is very soft and rises well. I microwaved the milk (both times) rather than bothering with a pan. Substituted allspice for mace. Because we only had one 13.5 ounce can of poppyseed filling (the only one I could find, checking several European delis! you can find the finished cakes everywhere here, but not, apparently, the ingredients), we made one roll with that - the can was plenty, wouldn't need 21 ounces - and one roll filled with a cinnamon/brown sugar/butter/walnuts mixture. Yummy!

I love this bread, but I have to warn you that not everyone will.  I made this as a 6th grade project when I did a report on Czech (living in SC at the time).  I grew up on poppyseed breads and kolace, and I thought it was a real treat, but the other kids thought it was weird and one girl asked, "is this caviar?"  I'm still haunted by this memory 21 years later. Poppyseeds get stuck in your teeth, so do a mirror check before smiling.
