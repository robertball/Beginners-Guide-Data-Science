This is an awesome recipe for fried okra. I have also made this without the potatoes and it is just as good. Something about the okra being fried in the cornmeal that really sets it off. I have also used this same recipe with out the corn muffin mix just using corn meal and flour. Wanted fried okra and didn't have the corn muffin mix. Fried okra is just good eating. oH, the Yukon Gold  potatoes are fine but I have used what ever potato I have on hand and works great. Just good.

Tasty spin on an old favorite.  The onions really give a lovely sweetness.  I, too, used a mixture of flour and cornmeal, and it turned out fine. Added a bit of salt and pepper.  Grew all my ingredients in my home garden...they're all really easy to do...even in containers.

My Grandma always made just plain fried okra, which was amazing!  I never knew her recipe, so I decided to search for one.  This is a very good recipe!  I really recommend trying it WITH the potatoes and onions!  The only thing I will do differently next time is cut the potatoes smaller.  Also, two onions will seem like a lot, but cooks down to almost nothing!

Love this! Although I use about half as much onion as called for in any recipe, then add black pepper for extra spice.  If you add some sausage, this makes a great one dish meal.  I've also used frozen, pre-breaded okra and then didn't bread the potatoes. It's a flexible recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. Nothing at all like fried okra is supposed to be.  Jiffy and other such mixes are sweet.  For good fried okra, skip the mixes and just use cornmeal.

I did this with only okra... I think you can make the pieces bigger than a quarter inch. I used Jiffy mix, and rinsed the okra just before coating it so the corn mix stuck well. Instead of putting it in a pan and flipping it, I deep fried the okra.

Definitely a keeper! First time cooking okra and now I have high expectations.  I cut the potatoes smaller, like 1/2" pieces and added salt, pepper and paprika.

Thank you for taking the time to type this up. This is my husband's favorite summertime meal. I think you have be from the South to really appreciate fried taters & okra.

Craig! Great recipe!  Did not change a thing in this recipe and my family totally loved. it.  My late mom in law made a great fried okra.  Not sure if it was as good as hers, but my family loved it. Thanks!!

I'll give it a 4 just because it was a little messy and after the first batch, they didn't cook as well.  I have cooked fried okra several times so I know it can be a hard thing to cook so I didn't mark it lower.  I thought the taste was great and it was nice having it a bit different than my normal fried okra.  I didn't have a potato this time, but I will certainly try it next time.  I did need some extra meal mix, so I added some reg cornmeal to the jiffy mix.

Southern fried okra at its best.  Skip the muffin mix, just use cornmeal mixed with flour.  Just like Grandma used to make.
