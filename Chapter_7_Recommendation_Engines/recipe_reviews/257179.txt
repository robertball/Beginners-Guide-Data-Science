Awesome seafood dish! I added a teaspoon of red curry to turn the heat up a little. Wonderful dish.

Substituted sole for the sea bass. Pleased by how easy and quick this was to make, about 30 mins from prep to serve! Even quicker if you use instant rice. This stew tastes amazing, even with the less expensive/fancy fish. Very flavorful, nice and spicy (without being overwhelming so). I normally can't stand my own cooking, but this dish tasted like I'd ordered it at a pricey restaurant. My husband took leftovers to work and coworkers asked where he'd gone out to eat the night before because it smelled so good. 

Making it again tonight, I'll be sure to snap a photo this time!

Bold. And not Brazilian, I`m Brazilian and I don`t recognize this dish. Muqueca, or Moqueca, first of all, use Azeite de Dende, or Palm Oil. And tons of onios, green peppers and FRESH TOMATOES.
Why you American are not originals when create a dish Do you need to invent another one using a famous name - and in this case - from the  other Country .Shame on you!

One of the best dishes All Recipes has ever listed.  I did, however, change it up a bit...Did 1 pound of Sea Bass, 1/2 pound of Jumbo Shrimp and 6 Sea scallops.  It was amazing!  This will definitely be a keeper!

Excellent.  I've had moqueca in Brazil (Bahia) numerous times over the years and this is pretty darn good, albeit not dripping in palm oil (for better and worse) like "true" moqueca.  I used cod and shrimp.

Amazing! The perfect recipe. If you like spice, a full teaspoon of cayenne is the way to go. The pairing with rice is perfect. keeps really well in the fridge. I used mahi and cod instead of sea bass. I couldn't really taste the difference between those two, and cod is way cheaper, so I might go all cod next time. The cod does flake apart into little baby pieces though, the mahi held its shape as big chunks. The soup is so flavorful the subtle differences between fish are really not detectable, so I would just use whatever fish is readily available to you.

This was so delicious. Very flavorful. Even my picky husband liked it. I followed the recipe exactly, didn't add anything. It was pretty easy. I made it with an ancient grain rice blend. Thanks!

This is simple and amazing. We didn't have sea bass, so the first time we made it, we used farm raised catfish. Since then, we tried it with the sea bass. It's very good both ways. The very expensive sea bass is more traditional but for a  quick weeknight meal the catfish worked great. In fact, we may prefer the catfish, but then, we're catfish lovers, preparing it in many ways.   This is one to try. Do watch the video at least once.

I followed this recipe as closely as possible other than using smoked paprika instead of regular  & also I used  Cod instead of sea bass since I can't get that here. I used 1 full teaspoon of cayenne for the perfect heat.  Not only does this dish look incredible with it vibrant colors but has a very nice, kind of exotic, dark, smokey flavor with just a hint of heat. My wife said it looks and tastes like something from a nice restaurant and that she would pay for a bowl of it if on a menu.  Great stuff, this is going in the "keeper" file!

**Update: I just made a batch tonight with some blackened chicken breast. I dare say it tastes even better than the fish batch...  awesome flavor! I blackened the chicken breasts (the kind you get in 3lb bags frozen) separately on a foreman grill,. I  coated the chicken with olive oil and then used a home made blackening rub (using smoked paprika).

I was watching another Chef John video and I had to walk away for a few minute.  When I came back, this one was playing.  WOW!  One of the best dishes I ever made.  I did substitute Tilapia in place of the bass but I can't imagine it would turn out any better.  Instead of serving the rice on the side I would put the stew over it.  You will want to be able to scoop up every drop of the sauce.  Outside of that I substitution I followed everything else to a tee.  Nice job Chef John!

My husband said this is the best seafood dish I have ever made. I used mahi mahi fish. I also added a bit of chicken broth just to cut the coconut milk a bit. It was delicious. I swear I could sell this in a restaurant. Loved it and have added it to our family recipe collection!

Just made this tonight and it was a hit!  I forgot to buy jalapenos so I stirred in a tablespoon of Sambal Oelek  for heat.  I think this has a really Thai flavor profile, and it is delicious!  I used leftover cod for the fish.

This was my first try at making a fish stew and Chef Johnâ€™s recipe did not disappoint. I used monkfish and scallops as the seafood ingredients. These worked out fine. The stew was appropriately spicy but had a nice smoothness to it. We loved it, served with brown rice and a slice of French bread on the side. Thanks Chef John!

It's quick and easy. I liked slightly more lime in mine. I've never had Brazilian food really so I don't know what to compare it to. I felt it was missing something, maybe some textural contrast. Anyway, I preferred Chef's Tuscan stew, but this was enjoyable as well.

The very best. I  used coconut cream instead of milk but only half a can. I did not have lime so used lemon. I would not add too much, liked the taste before the sour. 

I added shrimp and salmon and both were very tasty

The stew was really good. I made it slightly spicier by adding more chilli powder and crushed red peppers.

I make this often.  I add shrimp and whatever fish (if any) on hand.  I also preboil potatoes and add them in after the soup is ready.  I love soup so I add extra cans of coconut milk.  (And extra seasoning of course.)  One can never go wrong with a recipe of Chef John !

This is addicting! I was hesitant to make a fish stew, but this was like crack. My husband didn't even get a bite. I made him a container of it for work, but ended up eating it. I will make this again.

I don't know what this is supposed to taste like but I liked it.  I used talapia and shrimp.  For me it needed much more spice and I used roma tomatoes.  To the Brazilian nay sayer I would say read the description it says "my version" not authenic.

Used 1/2 salmon, 1/2 cod. No other changes. Did all the chopping before starting to cook (recommend). Dish is truly Brazilian: hot, spicy, sweet and succulent. Keeps well for leftovers although it only lasted a couple of days around here because Iâ€™d keep having a bite here and there. Definitely a keeper. Will try with snapper and again with mahi mahi.

This dish came out pretty darn good.  I didn't have bell pepper on hand, and I only had one jalapeno.  I also didn't want it too spicy, so I only added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper.  Lastly, the sea bass was a bit too expensive at the grocery store, so I bought cod instead.  The dish still ended up being delicious.  By the way, adding the lime juice definitely added zing to the dish.   The husband loved it too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Donâ€™t hesitate on making this. Itâ€™s easy, flavorful and a delicious. My family killed it. I did add less lime juice and added more smoked paparika, and snow peas. Will add this to the top of the go to list. I also used cod in place of the sea bass. You could definitely use shrimp too.

Delicious...everyone loved it. Added 1 tsp of red curry paste because I had no jalapeÃ±os as well as 1/2 tsp of cayenne for a double recipe. Used grouper and added scallops...very nice flavour.

I didn't have some of the ingredients such as jalapeno peppers (substitute it with red pepper flakes for the heat), and green onions.  Delish!  It was quick and easy to prepare quickly on a Friday night!

This is fabulous. Followed the directions and it turned out to be a very special dinner.  Just make sure that your fish has the bones taken out.  Next time I will use a few different fish.

Quick and easy to prepare. Very tasty, used cod, shrimp and mussels. Probably added a little too much cayenne in addition to the hot peppers. Would try again using alternative species of seafood.

Whole family loves this dish, made following the directions as written.  Sometimes I use half fish, half shrimp, but that is my only variation.  Does the trick when we need an easy substitute for the Brazilian version.  Thanks!

I love this. Simple to make and delicious. I used cod and sole and would use the same recipe with chicken instead even. Unfortunately my fish hating husband still hates fish, though he did eat the rice with the sauce and veggies.

This is my new quick meal choice.  I used frozen Costco Seabass, carrots, brocollini and spinach.  Always have coconut milk and lemongrass on hand, and I added 1 cup of Trader Joe's Hearty Vegetable broth because I prefer more of a soup than a sauce.    Husband doesn't like heat, so I'll add pepper flakes to mine.

Amazing dish. My husband, who's a picky eater, luuurved it! I made a few changes however. I cooked the peppers in a little red palm oil with the saute'd onions. I did put the fish as is, but would definitely marinate in some lime juice and salt next time.

I didn't think this would be a hit with my fish picky family...but 4 or the 5 really enjoyed it.  I used Tilapia as the only really change.  It was a hit and we will have again to get some seafood variety.

Definitely 5 stars!  We loved this dish.  I used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper as another reviewer suggested.  I think this would work with any type of seafood.  I used grouper, because it was what looked freshest at the grocery today.

I donâ€™t care for fish, but this stew was excellent and company worthy.  Used Cod instead because no Sea Bass available.  Went light on the heat, but heavier on the coconut milk.  Quick & easy.  Definite keeper.  Next time I will add a few extra veggies.  Would also be good with chicken, shrimp or other seafood.

This was so delicious.  My daughter and husband (both picky eaters) absolutely loved this.  I used grouper instead of sea bass and also added shrimp to make it very hearty.  The flavors were wonderful and I am back to make it again.

excellent recipe! used sea bass for the first batch. we loved the sauce so much that I'm going to use up the rest of my leftover coconut cream (I diluted to make milk) and tomato paste this evening and use chicken instead of fish!

Did it like in the instructions but used Cod Fish instead. Tasty pretty god but think I'd prefer it to have more of a kick to it. Definitely gonna try it again later and maybe with Sea Bass to see if it tastes any different

This was very, very good - I rated a 5, but spouse rated a 4.  I followed the recipe using mixture of sea bass, halibut, cod and scallops. As a previous reviewer said, it's almost impossible to distinguish the fish in the sauce, except for the scallops. I used Thai sticky rice and served with hearts of palm/mango salad, and cheese puffs - both Brazilian. Great meal accompanied by Brazilian music.

Used some fresh caught sea bass, everyone loved it. Has a real nice slow burn kick to it, so dial in the spices to your liking.

This was fabulous!!  I used one large jalapeno and it was just the right amount of spice for me.  I used swai fish and it worked great.  Yum!

Delish. Go Chef John!  I didn't have groceries. Had to make a few substitutions : no Tomato paste so I substituted  1 tbsp red curry paste & 2 tbsp  sun dried tomato pesto. I had coconut cream instead of coconut milk. I also added peeled, deveined shrimp after cooking the fish for 3 minutes. Could not put it down.

Did not make any changes with the exception  of adding more cod. The coconut milk I used was a 19 oz can  .It is not spicy or hot . if you like spicy wait & add after you have tasted it ,  will make this often

I made two small changes; sea bass was unavailable for four (I only caught one) so I used swordfish tips, bay scallops and shrimp. And, I added a half can more of coconut milk so there was plenty of sauce and also because I feared it would be a four alarm dish with all the 'heat' his recipe calls for. In the final analysis, it wasn't too hot (I was going to say 'it wasn't so hot' but you'd get the wrong idea). This was perfect. The fresh onion garnish is pretty, but I'm not certain it's needed when some lime zest would provide the color and add some zing. I might try that next time; and there will be a next time. I have made this three times and every time my hubby tells me to make more.  Make a double batch; it's definitely worth the effort.
