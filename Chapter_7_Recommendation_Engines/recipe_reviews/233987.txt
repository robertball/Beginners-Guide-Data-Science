Who doesn't like a peanut butter-banana combo?  It works in this smoothie.  I didn't have any flax seed, so I doubled the wheat germ, and garnished with some chopped peanuts.  It's an extremely sweet smoothie (at least for our tastes), and I'm not sure that I'd add any honey the next time.  You may want to give the blender a whirl and then taste before adding the honey.  I'm a smoothie lover, and this is a good one.

Liked it better with out the honey we like this one for breakfast or lunch on the go. Approved by 3 of my 4 kids - the 3 yr old is extremely picky. If it had been nutella w/ his peanut butter I'm sure he'd have drunk it up!

This is excellent! I love peanut butter and banana sandwiches: this is just without the bread and butter. Less calories.

I did not use wheat germ and it turned out great. Used almond butter instead of peanut butter. Added protein powder. Very filling. Loved it!
