Oh, Chef John, you made my morning! I put butter on the toast but it wasn't necessary. Don't change a thing! Ooey, gooey, crunchy, spicy....... just perfect. I was going to do two eggs at once as I had a big piece of toast, but I wasn't sure I'd be able to manipulate the extra egg. No need though; plenty of yolk to cover the whole toast. (The last time I tried to manipulate my eggs, they accused me of emotional blackmail, so there's that!) 
Triple yummm!

Excellent! I added a bit of sliced ham and some sliced black olives, which added to the flavour nicely. Surprising, after having tasting a few "stray pieces" I didn't reach for the salt shaker I do so automatically. Which I shouldn't do.

This fit perfectly on a toasted buttered English muffin.  Without the red pepper, this breakfast would have been too bland for us.  The cheese hardens quickly as soon as the egg is released from the pan resulting in a cheesy crunchy texture.   I think I would have preferred crumbled bacon on top to just give it a little more complexity.

I made this two days in a row and did not make any changes the first time, the second time I added a bit of smoked paprika, delicious! This would be a great quick supper.  I love this and will make it again and again!

I liked this. I used sliced bread and that didn't do what a nice garlicy toasted Italian bread could do with this.   I will have to see if several eggs can be made simultaneously.  FYI  I used Muenster cheese and it worked well here.

Almost perfection! I separated the egg as a YouTube guy had suggested and slightly scrambled the white before I put it on the cheese then add the yolk. White spread out over the age of the cheese too much so Iâ€™m going to go back to chef Johns method

Simple, filling recipe. I served this for dinner with tomato and bread stew. I didn't add red pepper flakes or the salt.

Only change I made was to use shredded mozzarella because that's what I had on hand.  It was so delicious!  Can't wait to try it with cheddar!  I also omitted the green onions but that's just due to personal preference.

I made this yesterday and it was was a great change from the norm. I always add turmeric to my my eggs. Bacon bits would have been good too!

The only change I made was add thin sliced mushrooms to the close to being done fried cheese.

I would recomend shredding the cheese small for quicker melt.  Short strokes instead of long strokes.

Like  Chef John says. Make this your own. I agree. I didn't count or set a timer. Just watched, waited and flipped when I felt it was time.  

Make your eggs like you prefer them cooked. Only differnce really is you cook the cheese first instead of putting it on top of the cooked egg

Delicious!  I added bacon as you suggested and used cayenne pepper, which really spiced up the cheese toast.

It turned out okay but not exciting.  The cheese starts to harden quickly after removing it from the pan.  Nothing very special about it.
