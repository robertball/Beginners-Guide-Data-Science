I made this for our staff here at an elementary school.  Everyone loved it!  I would also recommend taking the dessert out  of the freezer at least a half hour before serving.

Absolutely delicious! I wanted a thicker crust so I increased 1 1/2 times the crust amount ( 1 1/2 c flour, 3/4 c br sugar, 3/4c chopped walnuts and 3/4 c butter). I chopped up 2 c. of fresh strawberries and sprinkled 1T of white sugar over the strawberries  to help make it more sweeter and release its' red juices. Instead of a ready made topping, I whipped 1 c. of heavy whipping cream, added lemon juice and 1 c. of sugar. When I folded the strawberry mixture into the whipped cream, its' juices made a pretty pink color. And when I poured the filling over the crust it made nice pink and white swirls throughout the filling. I froze this dessert for at least 8 hours before cutting into it.  Once frozen solid I had no problem cutting into the squares. I placed a dollop of homemade whipped cream from this site,"Sweetened Whipped Cream". This dessert makes a pretty presentation with flecked strawberry bits in the pinkish hue filling. The strawberries are definitely sweet and juicy. The filling itself is light, fluffy and creamy. I like the crunchy toasted walnuts in the crust as well as the topping. It adds a nice texture to the dessert. It is not too sweet -just right. The crust ended up being the right amount for this size dessert and I am glad I increased the amount. We all enjoyed this cool and creamy dessert. Frozen whipped cream blended with chopped strawberries and topped with a crunchy walnut topping, is a refreshing and perfect way to end a hot, humid day here in Hawaii!

My mom made this when I was growing up and I always thought the crust was the best part (she made it with pecans). I still love the crust. This is a nice light dessert, not too sweet. If your berries aren't the sweetest, you might want to add more sugar.

DELICIOUS!! Young and old alike loved this recipe. I would reccommend that you bring the dessert out of the freezer 20-30 minutes before serving to soften a bit.  Chris Coffman

YOWZA!!!  I had some strawberries I had to use before they were going to go bad, and this was an excellent way to make use of them!  I added a few more chopped pecans to the crust (I didn't have walnuts), and like others, enjoyed it a lot better when thawed.  If this treat doesn't satisfy your sweet tooth, I am not sure what will!  A new summer fave!!

This recipe is so easy and so yummy.  Just make sure you freeze it the whole six hours it says or it will be too soft.  This is a big hit with my whole family.  A nice alternative to making a cake.  I highly recommend it!

We liked this recipe, but my husband suggested letting it unthaw for about one half hour before serving as it is difficult to cut and eat when it is frozen, otherwise it was quite good!

I love this recipe...I use any kind of chopped nuts I may have on hand (last time I used ice cream topping nuts) and instead of the pan I do individual muffin papers...much easier to serve this way !!!!

I actually used pecans instead of walnuts, and it came out fine. This reminds me of the strawberry and pretzel dessert I make. This seemed to have wierd instructions on why you had to remove the crust to cool. I didn't, and it came out fine.

The hardest part of this recipe is chopping the berries.  The rest is so easy and fast.  I have made it twice and the next time I may try my electic chopper.

This recipe is delicious, easy and 
everyone loves it.  
It is perfect for Strawberry season, 
and can be frozen for a long time.

My family prefers it softer, rather than 
frozen, so we freeze it, then thaw it out 
before serving.

I made this yesterday because I was given a package of whole frozen strawberries. I let them thaw for only about an hour then I pulverized them in my food processor and added them to the egg whites. There were no pieces of frozen strawberry "ice cubes" when I served it. 
I used Cool Whip instead of whipped cream and it was fine. Like a few others I was amazed by the number of mixing bowls  and pans it took, but , It's Worth it!!!

YUMMY, YUM, YUM. Loved it. I used Pecans instead of walnuts (just a person nut preference). Delicious. My kids goobles this down and my quests thought it to be the best freezer dessert ever. Great recipe. Thanks!

The flavor lacked the "punch" I hoped it would have.  This wasn't very popular, even with my pink-loving daughter (for whose b'day we had made the cake).

Everyone who tried this has asked for the recipe.  
It is so easy that my children made it for me on my birthday.  
This is a great way to use fresh strawberries!
