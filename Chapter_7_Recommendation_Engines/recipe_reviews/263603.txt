These were very good. They are a lot like corn tortillas. I wasn't able to use my food processor so I mixed them by hand and they turned out fine. Make sure that you don't cook them very long or they won't be flexible.  I wrapped mine in a towel when they finished cooking so that they could steam in the towel and soften a little bit.

Just made a batch from this recipe and they came out great!  I didn't use a food processor to mix the ingredients. Instead, I used a whisk to mix up the dry items and a spatula to mix in the wet items until the dough was firm. Once I rolled each ball with a rolling pin,  I used a 5" plastic lid to make the disk.  I cooked them for 1 min on each side at a lower temperature since I used coconut oil on the skillet . Too high of a temperature will cause the coconut oil to smoke, which is not good.

Great starter recipe. I have been playing around with it a little. One batch I reduce coconut flour to 2 tablespoons and added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. It cut the carb count even lower and gave great flavor.

i made these and they were delicious. I think there is too much water so I will add less next time. Way different then traditional flour tortillas, sweeter. Very filling!
