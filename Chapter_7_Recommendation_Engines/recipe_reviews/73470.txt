Good recipe, however, in Greece we tend to sautee the diced onions in oil first and add some crushed parsley. Then add the green beans, and tomato juice with diced tomatoes, for 5 minutes. (salt&pepper) Then add water just enough to cover the green beans and boil for 50 minutes till the sauce is thick. This makes the green beans softer.
Serve with feta cheese and bread for that extra something! Perfect.

This is a GREAT side dish. I used canned tomatoes.  I added more garlic and garlic salt, along with some Oregano.  My husband is Greek and adding the Oregano makes it more like the green beans we have been served at Greek restaurants, weddings etc.

Oh my goodness.  Tastes like home!  I could eat fasolakia (as we call it) every day.  I was tempted to add sliced potatoes, but I will do that next time.  This time I followed to the letter, except I upped the garlic to 5 cloves, used an extra tomato, and added about 1/4 of broth (I would have liked to use white wine, but had none).  I simmered the beans for a solid hour, maybe an hour + 10 min.  Also sprinkled a generous amount of parsley.  What a nectar the sauce became... I could hear my Greek father's voice telling me to soak it all up with bread.  And this dish is not complete with a big chunk of feta cheese on the side.  Delicious!  But for those who omit the sugar, beware--it serves the purpose of balancing the acidity of the tomatoes.  Just a little goes a long way.  I actually cut out 1/2 a tsp from the recipe, and it was just right.  Yaya would be proud!!!

This dish reminds me of my grandma's cooking. It's one of those classic Greek vegetarian dishes that tastes better the next day (after all the flavours have blended). In Greece it would be eaten at room temperature. I love to crumble some Feta on top and eat it as a main course with some crusty bread to sop up the juices. With a glass of dry white wine, what could be better? Yum!

I love the idea of this recipe.  I even use it with a can of green beans.  I use a small amount of evoo and add onions, tomato, and sugar to taste.  I let them soften and add a can of green beans to heat. Taste great!

My sister had some extra green beans that a friend gave her so I made this recipe.  I did add more garlic because I love garlic and I also added some Oregano as another reviewer suggested.  This was very good and I will make it again.

I have to change my review a bit: I agree with the other reviewer, the onions should sweat a little before cooking the beans.  You should use two small onions, 4 ripe tomatoes, and a whole head of sliced garlice for these beans -- one clove is definitely not enouh.  A note to the other reviewers that do not like this recipe after cutting back on the oil - the name of this recipe in Greek translates to "Oily Beans."  You must add the oil to get the flavor, then do not transfer the oil to the plate when serving.  This dish must also rest for a period of hours to meld the flavors - as with most Greek dishes.  Parsley should be added and the addition of oregano is a big no no.  This is a main course, typically served with feta cheese and bread.

I'm not a big fan of green beans, but I loved these! Used canned beans, a can of tomatoes w/onion & garlic + 2 small onions and garlic. Omitted the salt. Delish!

These were QUITE tasty!  I made it easier on myself, I'll have to confess.  I used two cans of green beans (drained) and two cans of diced tomatoes (partially drained)and followed the recipe from there.  It was excellent.  Yes, that's a lot of olive oil but you can use a slotted spoon to serve.  Will make again and again!

We love this recipe - we do however add diced tomatoes with green chilis - to spice it up and as another person suggested we saute the onions and garlic and spices in olive oil (plus a little butter) before adding to the tomato mixture. Everyone loves it - even our 4 year old son!!

I watched an authentic Yaya make this once and she put a plate over the beans to squish them all down into the cooking liquid.  At the end, the beans should look extremely soft; no longer any crispness.  Because they are saturated with delicious sauce instead!

I loved this!  the only changes I made were to use a 16 oz can of stewed tomatoes with juices that I chopped. (good fresh tomatoes were not in season)  I also added a little chicken stock to add a little more moisture since it had to cook for so long.

very tasty. I used a little less olive oil and no sugar, plus I used canned diced tomatoes and only cooked it for about 20 minutes.

I will definately make it again.

Follow the advice of Pureshores and add a lot of fresh parsley about 1/2 cup or a smaller amount of dried parsley when adding the tomatoes.  Cut the the sugar to 1/2 tsp or possibly 3/4tsp.  You can use a small can of diced tomatoes if you do not have any fresh tomatoes.  You may need to add a little water because typically the beans will not be soft in 45 mins.  It depends on the beans but a few times I had to cook them for 1 1/2 hrs to get them as soft as they are typically served in Greece.  You can use frozen beans too.  You will need about 1/2 -1 can of water to cook until soft.  Serve with a slab of feta and some crusty artesan bread and you have a typical Greek peasant meal.

I didn't measure anything, but using the ingredients these greens beans taste similar to the kind i've had at greek restaurants.  The trick is to cook the beans all the way down until tender.  I added a little less than 1 tsp vinegar.  I also sauteed the onions in oil before adding them to the already boiling green beans.  I think the only thing that could improve these beans is cooking them in a little chicken broth.  Otherwise, very good.  Also, I was concerned about the sugar but it added something very subtle and good to the dish.  Enjoy!

These are my new favorite way to have green beans.  I didn't have fresh green beans so I used a can of organic french cut style green beans.  I didn't add salt or sugar.  Just seems odd to have sugar on green beans.  I did sprinkle on some organic garlic powder.  I cooked in the onions in the olive oil first, then added in the tomatoes as I diced them.  I diced the tomato into small and medium sized pieces.  After all the tomatoes were in, I added in the can of organic green beans.  I drained all the water in the can before adding them in.  Only took about five minutes after that and it was done.  They turned out delicious.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

I doubled the amount of garlic, added oregano and let it cook about ten minutes longer (I tend to like my beans on the softer side). Better than my Nouna's.

I first made this dish several years ago, and I have made it more times than I can count since then.  It's a favorite of mine, and I never tire of it.  I still add more garlic (usually about 3 cloves), and I always use either fresh (my own Romano ones are best) or frozen if it's winter.  Please, I beg you...don't use canned--it is NOT the same flavor. You want those beans to cook until they soften, and they become so sweet and meltingly tender you won't believe it.  This is not the time to go crisp-tender.  I always use sweet onion, and I don't add the sugar, and unless it's the height of summer, and my tomatoes are in, I usually use  high quality, fire roasted whole ones that I crush by hand.  Sometimes, I add a touch of bacon grease if I have it on hand, and I don't usually use the whole amount of olive oil.  But I DO recommend you be generous with it...it really does make a difference.  Smoked paprika is also great in these.  Bottom line, this is one of the best vegetable dishes ever, so grab some beans and a pot, and get cooking!  This tastes best slightly warm or room temp to me. A loaf of crusty bread to soak up those lovely juices and a hunk of salty cheese, and I've got the perfect meal.

What an easy and tasty recipe.  I could eat these as a meal all alone.  As it was, had them with marinated portabello and quinoa.  Picky meat-eating son even said they were "really good".  I left off the sugar and used a mix of fresh/canned tomatoes.

Perhaps it's because I have never had this while dining out or anywhere else for that matter, but it was lacking for me.  It was ok, but not sensational.

This was pretty good. I've had a potato dish that was very similar, but this was a different way to cook green beans. As suggested, I added oregano. I halved the recipe, but did 3 cloves of garlic and used one 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes. Because of that, I didn't add any sugar and went light on the additional salt since canned tomatoes have plenty of both. Cooked for around 30 minutes (my beans were frozen), and that seemed fine.

These were perfect, and very easy! I've pestered my Greek in-laws for years for their recipe but they don't have one written down and I never seem to be able to watch them cook these beans! Anyway, the flavor was just like we're used to from Greek family & restaurants. I used a 15oz can of whole tomatoes that I diced, instead of fresh. Worked great! This is a keeper.

This recipe has enough potential that I'll probably make it again, but it needs changes. I love olive oil, but it calls for WAY too much. Next time I'll probably saute in 1 tablespoon oil, then add one more with the beans (maybe a little more if the tomatoes aren't very juicy). Also, they weren't even close to done after 45 minutes. I ended up covering them and letting them cook another 30 minutes. Next time I'll try cooking with the lid on from the start. On a positive note, my husband and I agreed the flavor was very good!

Tasted like this needed something.  It was just okay.  Everyone finished it but felt like it was just meh. I've made these again with a few changes and upped the stars.  First, I completely cheated.  I didn't have fresh green beans so used a can of French cut green beans and used red onions.  I also sprinkled in a little Mediterranean Basil (dried).  My husband's eyes rolled in the back of his head with the first bite.  This will now go in the rotation more frequently.  I think the BIG difference were the onions not the canned beans. lol

Love it.  I did add oregano, parsley and liquid just to cover the beans as other reviewers suggested. (im not sure how they can cook so long with no liquid but the original recipe doesnt include any  ??)  This was very yummy.

This was an interesting way to snaz up the frozen green beans I had in my freezer.  I used diced tomatoes (15 oz can) instead of fresh, and omitted the salt and sugar.  Tasted great with the gyro burgers.

simple, quick and yummy. What more can I say? This is a very nice recipe for a fast, healthy dinner over rice. The only change I made was to add a can of diced tomatoes, since I had no fresh ones.

This is very much like one of my favorite recipes (just like Mom's). I use much less oil, and saute onions (1 small, chopped) and garlic (2 or 3 cloves). Then I add salt, pepper, and a ton of oregano, and when the onions are soft and clear, I add the green beans. Once they're soft-ish, I add 1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes and let it cook. Then add a handful of sugar. After awhile, take the lid off to allow the sauce to condense. And that's about it. My favorite side ever!

Another bean favourite in our house. I don't use that much oil and I peel the tomatoes before dicing.  Canned tomatoes work well too.  I add fresh parsley, oregano and a sprinkle of hot chili flakes.  And of course the feta and crusty bread is a must!

I normally fall in love with every Greek recipe I try, this one was just okay. I basically followed the ingredients as states except I added 1/4 cup of oil rather then  the 3/4 cup called for. No way was I adding that much oil. I added some oregano to give it more of a kick. Tasted good with pita and tzatziki though, just no real wow factor.

Good, but WAY too much olive oil. Next time I'll just boil the green beans a little first and maybe just coat them in olive oil. Otherwise, delicious.

This recipe uses way too much olive oil. It ends up making the green beans taste greasy. If you use fresh green beans you will have to add more water and more seasoning also. I recommend cutting the amount of olive oil and serving this with the Rachel Ray Cheesy Orzo recipe. It tasted great topped on that.

I do add parsley & oregano if I have it. This time I  put 1 cup of V8 and a big bowl of assorted garden cherry tomatoes because we have too many instead of the 3 tomatoes. I put all that in slow cooker.

I felt the amount of olive oil was excessive so I cut the suggested quantity by 1/3. I also covered the skillet after the beans were added, which meant the cooking time needed was much less. Those were the only charges I made and I will make the recipe again. Thanks.

Made this as a side dish for Traditional Gyro Meat (meatloaf) and it ROCKED! Even the kids liked it. Added a sliced red bell pepper because I saw it in another recipe and I happened to have one. Was skeptical that the beans would be total mush if I cooked for 45 minutes as recommended but I'm happy to say I was wr-r-r. They were perfect. Having the leftovers tonight. Might top with some Feta, but then again why mess with a good thing??

Substituted canned tomatoes. Added garlic salt to taste. The sauce was slightly sweet but a wonderful, savory substitute when craving pasta.

THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE! In addition to following the directions I also drained the oil after sauteeing the garlic and onions. Then before serving I also drained some of the water created by the cooked string beans and garnished with shaved romano cheese. EVERYONE ENJOYED THIS SIDE DISH.

Excellent!  Following other reviewers, 5 diced garlic cloves were sauteed after onion was soft.  Then added the beans, 3 larged diced Roma tomatoes, 1/2 can tomato sauce, 1 cup chicken broth (could use water if going vegan), 1/2 cup diced parsley,  sugar and salt.  Cooked covered over low heat for 1-1/4 hours.  The smell in the house was heavenly, and they could not have tasted better.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Perfect as is. I'm Mediterranean and this was and is one of our staples during late spring,  summers and early fall. Always served with poached fish and poached lamb or mutton. Thank you for sharing.

I had 2 cups chopped leeks left over from my leek/potato soup, and a half an onion, in they went. Ditto 2 sweet banana peppers from my garden, so all sautéed together. Even, at the very end and after tasting, plopped a tablespoon of balsamic into the dish. Did follow recommendations of parsley - have so much - and chicken stock (for sure). In no way was this "oily". Very important to cook the beans thoroughly. Yay, the next day.

These were fantastic. Super easy to make and great flavor. I didn't have tomatoes, so I used a pint a stewed tomatoes. Loved the flavor and the extra sauce I got.

I cannot believe how good & simple recipe is. Thank you for sharing it. I have made this twice. The first time, I made it as written, except, (as some reviewers suggested) I added more garlic (about ten cloves) and some chopped, fresh, Italian flat leaf parsley, (a handfull, approx. 1/4 C)). I used a can of organic tomatoes, as the tomatoes in our grocery store in the winter are not ripe, and I added enough water to the tomatoes to fully cover the beans. The second time, I did the same,  but I didn't have the full two pounds of green beans, so I added some potato & mini-portobella mushrooms to what I had. Both times I simmered for about an hour and fifteen minutes. Both times delicious! I served this as a side dish, but it could easily be a main. Next, I will try it as several people have suggested and serve it  with bread and feta.

Not a horrible recipe, but just didn't do it for us. Something is missing. We expected more flavors to come through and will try to fix the next day with a little lemon and toasted almonds.

This was amazing!  I served this with Greek Lemon Chicken and Potatoes.  Based on the reviews of others, I used 4-5 cloves of garlic instead of just one.  I used liberal amounts of parsley and oregano.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.  I sprinkled feta cheese on top and it was delicious!  My only regret was not having any fresh bread to go with it.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These are fantastic! Just like the green beans I used to eat at the outdoor tavernas in Glyfada, Greece: swimming in olive oil and fragrant spices. Don't change a thing in this recipe......top it with good quality feta cheese and use a piece of rustic homemade bread to soak up the juice. OPA!!!

Greek style green beans are one of my most favorite things.  This recipe is really easy to throw together and doesn't require any babysitting while it cooks really.  I've made it now using fresh green beans, fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes and frozen green beans.  I think my favorite is fresh tomatoes and frozen green beans OR fresh green beans and canned tomatoes.   The other night I also threw in about 1/3 cup chicken broth that was left over from making the main dish and that didn't hurt a thing.  I also top the finished product with a little feta cheese which makes it extra delicious.

Absolutely the best recipe for string beans. I used canned tomatoes with garlic and onion but also added the amount of onion and garlic from the recipe, DELISH. Served the beans with breaded pork chops and mashed spuds, YUM.

Really good and I love two things about it: made from pantry ingredients and gets better overnight. I made it by sautéing the onions and garlic in the olive oil until soft and translucent.  Then I added 29 oz canned green beens and 29 oz diced canned tomatoes.  Plus a healthy dose of oregano.  +S&P to taste. simmered 3 hours+.

My husband called this dish "outstanding".  I used home canned green beans and tomatoes and used vegetable broth instead of olive oil as we are on strict plant based diet that does not include oil of any type.  I also added oregano suggested in another review.

Best. Beans. Ever. Never been a fan of beans, but these were amazing! I halved the recipe and used 2 cans of cut green beans and a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. Based on other comments, I cut the olive oil by 1/3 and doubled the garlic. And instead of the salt, I used 1 tsp. of the spice mixture left over from the Roasted Greek Chicken from this site (equal parts of dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper). I think this will be my go-to dish for my next pot luck!

These are the best Greek Green Beans (Fasolakia).  The secret is to give them plenty of time to simmer to really fuse the flavors.  I cook them for at least 60 minutes.  I used i large onion (diced), a bit more garlic (3 cloves, diced) and 1 can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil.  A good tip is to add a good glug (maybe 1/3 cup or so) of red wine the last 20 minutes of simmering.  I serve them with roasted lamb from the grill and crispy oven roasted potato wedges.

I made this tonight using canned green beans and it was excellent.  I can't wait to try it with fresh green beans when they are in season.  While I didn't use all the olive oil in the recipe, since I was using canned beans, what I did put in really did make a delicious 'sauce' once everything was assembled.  Too bad I won't have any left to see what it tastes like the next day!

Absolutely love this recipe. Only thing I changed was omitting the tomatoes. I'll use this recipe every time I make green beans.

Forgot to mention in my previous review just a few minutes ago ... it may be called "Greek" green beans but could just as easily be called "Italian", since that is what mama was and who taught me to cook.

Great dish! I was lookig for a vegan dish for a school event, when I came across this one. After reading the reviews and comments, I decided to try it.
I know that, as an authentic Greek dish, the beans are supposed to "float" in olive oil, but I still decided to cut the oil down to 2 tablespoons. I added some parsley to the onions, and a tablespoon of tomato paste for color. Last, I added about one tablespoon of lime juice to the beans before I added them to the dish, to maintain the nice green color (I used frozen green beans), and some black pepper to taste. Came out just wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

I will make this more often, perhaps adding diced egg plant, potatoes, or sliced mushrooms for variations.

Fabulous recipe!  I thought that the beans may become limp cooking for so long but after 45 minutes they were perfect.  I added about 1/3 cup of feta on top of the beans and put the lid back on the skillet to melt it.  This was the added touch that it needed to become over the top perfect.  Thanks for posting such a lovely recipe.

Delicious green beans! I love the greek style green beans at a local restaurant, so was excited to try this recipie. Texture is perfect! Used can tomatoes and turned out great! Great go to dish year round!  made them on a cool summer evening and they were great. Paired with roasted chicken and potatoes, but see how they would be just fine on their own.  thank you soo much for sharing!

This was very tasty, and even the picky eaters in the family ate it.  Next time, I will try adding oregano as other reviewers suggested, but it was already very good without that.

I love Greek cooking so I was excited to try this recipe - it didn't disappoint! I did add some tomato paste as my hothouse tomatoes were rather anemic. I also added oregano. Crumbled feta on top completed this delicious dish.

Absolutely delicious!  However, I did decrease the oil to 1/4 cup as it seemed excessive to me.  Although this dish tasted great, I was a little disappointed with the appearance - after cooking for so long both the green beans and the tomatoes lost too much color for me.  I added about a tbsp. of tomato paste to boost the tomato flavor.  Next time I will cook the "sauce" for a while and toss in some steamed green beans to see if they retain their bright green color.  Appearance was the only thing holding me back from giving this one 5 stars.

This was a nice way to use frozen green beans from the garden.  My husband said he would like to try this recipe again with green beans straight from the garden, not frozen.  We used petite diced canned tomatoes for convenience...no fresh tomatoes on hand.

I was looking for a health way to eat green beans and found this recipe.  I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe.  I used only 1 tsp of Olive oil and added fennel seed, ground mustard and crusted red pepper.  It was very tasty and something that I will make again.

I don't love green beans, but I loved them in this recipe.  I would only clarify that if you cover the dish while it's simmering, it will cook faster.  Delicious.

I used only about 1/4 cup olive oil and sautéed a chopped onion a few minutes then added the garlic for another minute or so til aromatic. Add a healthy tablespoon of either parsley or oregano (or Italian seasoning) and a pinch of red pepper flakes and a can of fire roasted tomatoes (including the juice). Cook that all down about five minutes, then added 32 oz carton of chicken broth, a tablespoon of tomato buillion powder,  salt and pepper, and the green beans. Bring that to a boil, then cover and  simmer for 1 & 1/2 hours. Sometimes I add a quartered potato during the last 30 minutes. This is my husbands favorite dish, fasolakia, like his mother made in their Greek village. Serve it with crusty bread.

Yuck, I won't be making these again! For all the time and preparation involved the end result was not worth it! These were too oily (had to drain them before serving!), didn't have enough flavor (in spite of the extra garlic and black pepper I put in) and 45 minutes wasn't long enough to make the beans tender enough for my taste.

Delicious! Made this recipe as a side dish for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. A nice alternative to the traditional creamy green bean dish most serve. 
A great addition would be toasted slivered almonds on top after serving.
I would make this again.

Very good, but I'd definitely cut down on the oil.  I added more garlic and some pepper.  This reminds me of a recipe at my favorite Chinese restaurant.  All I'd have to do is add chicken, hot pepper flakes or oil, and serve over rice!  I would definitely make again, with a few changes to my taste.  Thanks!

These green beans were delicious, but as others said, cut back on the olive oil.  I'm making them again tonight!

This is a great recipe that is a very different way to cook green beans.  I had a huge batch of fresh green beans and this was a great way to use them up.  I have tried a few green bean recipes, and this one's a keeper!

I gave this one four stars, because my husband and kids didn't really care for this recipe.  I enjoyed it, and I ate them three days in a row!  I did add the oregano as others suggested.

Delicious. I made this according to the recipe directions, but I would probably add oregano as others have suggested.

Delicious...
Added oregano, but otherwise made it as suggested. 
My boyfriend hates green beans normally, but liked these. Hurrah!

Way too much olive oil so I reduced the amount. Easy to prepare, used a package of haricourt verts from Sams Club. Reduced the onion and used frozen, diced onion as a timesaver. Used canned diced tomato and eyeballed everything. Went nicely with the Baked Chicken and Stuffing recipe from this site.

Excellent as a side dish to the Prune and Olive Chicken dinner (be sure to check that one out). It added color and variety to the table, and, more importantly, my guests all raved. Thanks for a WAY better than average way to serve the common green bean!

I think I was expecting more flavor than there was. It was different, but didnt knock my socks off. Not bad... but not what I was expecting.

Didn't think this was that great. Not much flavour. Maybe I was expecting too much as had this dish in turkey and is was so good!  Will keep on looking.

This was good. Nothing amazing, but the tomatoes did add something a little different and good to the green beans.

This recipes was alright.  It's definately a side dish.  It seemed like it was missing something.  Not enough "kazam", if you know what I mean.
