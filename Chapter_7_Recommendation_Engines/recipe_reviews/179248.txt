I wanted a different recipe for a work bake sale and this one did the trick!!  I had to modify it so it didn't have to have anything that would melt inside the cup so I made them into peanut butter cups by adding peanut butter in the center and melting chocolate bark to pour over the top.  They were a hit.....sold before they hit the table for the bake sale!!  Wonderful idea, Thanks~

These things were sticky and hard to make.  They did work out in the end but were soggy by the second day.  I won't make them again.  They looked really cute though!  I put a dab of chocolate icing in the center with sprinkles (instead of pudding).  The kids enjoyed them though (that's what really mattered).

Fun little treats.  Work quick because they cool fast.  I made about a 1/2 recipe and used snack pudding packs for the filling.
