Excellent!  We thoroughly enjoyed it!  I have a question; are you supposed to take the white wrapper off the brie?  I didn't and it was a little hard to cut through.

I modified this to make small bit size rolls for a wedding dinner and these were the ONLY thing that was completely devoured. Not a single leftover!

I sliced a round brie into wedges, and topped each one with a small amount of mango chuntney. I used butter instead of olive oil, and about a half sheet of phyllo per roll. Roll up the cheese and chutney in the phyllo and seal with butter. Bake until golden in the oven. Heaven!

Thanks for a great idea, it was a big hit!

I have made this several times.  I once ran out of red pepper jelly and used apricot jam.  It was a hit.

Great recipe! I let my baked brie sit for a few mins before serving so it didn't ooze everywhere after cutting it. I served a balsamic glaze as well as a ginger apricot marmelade with it. Yum!

This tasted sooo good, my whole family liked it!! I actually substituted the brie for camembert, which tasted great. I used the left-over phyllo pastry sheets, painted them with butter, and bunched them into little "ronettes" and tossed them in the oven for dipping. Sliced apples and pears for dipping are absolutely delicious.

The chutney I bought was a little too tart, but still good.  I used pastry dough instead of phyllo and it worked beautifully.

Very good, although I'm not sure if the phyllo dough adds much to the brie.

Made this with triple fruit jam and it was a huge hit at our little dinner party.  I plan to make this again and again.

Meh. With ingredients like brie and mango chutney I expected it to be more flavorful, instead I found it very bland. It wasn't bad, I just would find a better use of my ingredients for next time.

Was delish. I acutall used some pear chutney I made this summer. I sliced the wheel of Brie in half and spread the chutney on one half, placed the other half on top and then wrapped in Phyllo dough. Baked for 20 min. @ 350. Yummy. Saving this one for sure.

it worked! and was good. the only things i would change would be to cut down the oil...at least by half (just enough to lightly coat the dough). then, i would trim the white outer coating (as well as the thick exterior) on the brie. makes it taste old if left on. never used phyllo before... it wasn't nearly as hard as i imagined! thanks! one more thing, my husband had the idea of spreading minced garlic on the brie (both sides) before folding the phyllo dough around it. i suppose you could spread anything you wanted on it, like fruit, etc...the flavor does soak in just enough.

Very good.  I like the chutney layered in the brie before wrapping with phyllo. Then I lay the phyllo sheets across each other in all different directions  and then gather the points up to form a flower on top.  Tie while baking if you wish and then remove the string for serving.

I slice the brie in half and put the mango chutney in between the brie, then I wrap it with the phyllo and bake it.  It is delicious. I tried it the with the chutney on top as the recipe says and did not like itl. Everyone likes it my way better.

Family loved this!  I tried unrolling the phyllo frozen, and ended up with broken sheets ~ they still worked fine!  I used butter instead of olive oil and organic canned cranberry jelly for the topping.  Yum!  A great how-to base recipe.
