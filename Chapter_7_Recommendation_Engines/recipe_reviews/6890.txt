I have to be honest and say that this
recipe did not meet my expectations.
I feel the sherry flavor is too over-
powerering.  The currants all sunk to
the bottom of all of my muffins. These
muffins are pretty good right out of the
oven.  When they are room temperature,
they're not so good.  Also:  too high
in fat.

instead of sherry i used vanilia and almond extract,used raisins and currants but combined them with dry ingredients first so they won,t sink.  they are yummy and hubby can,t stop eating them.  enjoy
