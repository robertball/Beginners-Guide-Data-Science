Very Tasty and easy to do.  Had a bit of trouble finding the right flour by the right name. Ended up with Chana Flour which is Besan which is chick pea.

Used this recipe tonight - instead of mixing the vegetables in with the flour mixture, we just dipped the veggies in the flour mixture, then put them in the fondue pot.  Had to thin out the flour mixture with extra water - but the  combination of cumin & chili powder was delicious with the veggies (we used sweet potatoes, potatoes, broccoli, onions, zucchini, mushrooms, & cauliflower - yum!).

Where I lived in England and Canada these were called Onion Bhagi's (spelling varies). This recipe was good. I'm sure there are many ways to make these and I thought I followed this as directed, but something was missing.  I will keep searching for the "perfect" recipe.

Fried in very little oil so they looked a little less 3D,  and I used sambal instead of fresh chillies. Will definitely do again.

Very simple to make.  I used 1 serrano pepper instead of jalape√±o.  Also, ground coriander (1/2 tsp) instead of the seeds.
