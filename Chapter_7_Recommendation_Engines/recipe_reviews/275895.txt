I made exactly as written. Great flavor but even when baked for 22 minutes they seemed a little too "wet" so next time I make them I'm going to drop the cider amount by 2 T. to see if that helps and I'm going to up the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp. just because I love that apple pie spice flavor these had but could use some more.  Love that they puffed up to a nice cap over the muffin liner and that the batter and topping was the correct amount for the 12 muffins. Really nice flavor and the apples were a nice addition. I left out the nuts in the topping because I didn't have any, great without but I'm sure it would add a nice crunch and flavor with them.  Be sure to chop them small - almost to a mince. I used a Gala apple.
