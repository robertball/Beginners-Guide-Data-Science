3.11.16  My husband's grandmother was from Bavaria, and his mother learned how to cook their Christmas-Day sauerbraten meal  from her.  I learned from my MIL, so that tradition has continued.  That being said, I know how tasty, homemade, long-marinated  sauerbraten really is supposed to taste.  First, I have to say that it just doesn't get much easier than this slow cooker version but, of course, the tradeoff really comes from the way the beef tastes.  It just tastes like stew beef with sour gravy, not marinated beef, and that's not to say that's a bad thing.  You don't need red wine vinegar, cider will work fine, and I'd recommend that you taste before you add 2 Tbsp brown sugar.  I went ahead and added about 1 tsp, and it simply doesn't need any sweetening, at least for our tastes.  The gravy was too thick, so I added some beef broth to get to the right consistency.  Also, don't cut your beef into small chunks because it does break down quite a bit  with the long slow cooking time.  This recipe is  a compromise for sure, and although it's not the "real deal," you will get sauerbraten flavor.  So if you have a yearning for sauerbraten,  you just might find this slow-cooker version scratches that itch!

This came out really good.  The only change I made was adding more ginger snap cookies to gravy than what recipe said.   Will definitely make this again.

I liked it but it was a stronger vinegar taste than I prefer.

This was really good! I had a few issues with mine though and improvised, not due to the recipe. Firstly, I forgot to start my crock pot, so I browned the meat in a Dutch oven. I added the vinegar and beef broth as well as about two cups of water and let it simmer on low for two hours with the bay leaves. I removed the leaves, crushed up ginger snaps, added 4 cups of water and my noodles. The noodles absorbed the flavor and excess water boiled out gently. The meat fell apart, but it was so yummy! Even the kids said they were sorry for doubting me! Thanks for a nice German tasting dish!
