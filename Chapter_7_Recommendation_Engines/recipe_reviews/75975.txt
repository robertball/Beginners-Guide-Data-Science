I just want to thank everyone for the comments on this recipe. I have enjoyed reading your reviews, and so glad to hear that each meal was a success. It's one of my favorite dishes to fix. And, by the way, you can use whatever parts of the chicken you wish, the editor of this site is the one that put chicken breasts on there. I usually use leg quarters. But it depends on whose eating it, as to what I use (some people prefer white meat to dark). You might could even venture to try other types of meat such as pork or beef. If anyone tries it and likes it, please let me know.

Happy eating! :)

EXCELLENT! I was attracted to this recipe by the combination of ingredients and the EASY prep! Talk about simple to put together (it took all of 10 minutes) and exceptional results! The aroma while baking in the oven was wonderful! I was a little leary of putting sliced potatoes in the dish, but when served they were a nice compliment and I wouldn't skip adding them! The chicken was noticeably tender and cut with a fork - not sure if it was just fresh chicken or the pineapple juice which made the difference. I'm so glad I tried this recipe! YOU SHOULD TOO! You won't be disappointed! Nice presentation! I did used diced pineapple instead of sliced and put them on top of the chicken rather than on the side with the potatoes. I used Bulls-Eye Honey Mustard BBQ sauce. My husband couldn't stop complimenting this dish! Thanks ladies for a tasty recipe!

I decided to try this recipe based on my pal KOALAGIRL's recommendation, and I'm so glad I did!!!! I have to concur with her review. AWESOME! Yes, line your pan with foil, slice those 'taters as thin as you can and IMHO, double up on the amount of pineapple juice or all you're going to taste is chicken in BBQ sauce.I've made this twice in two weeks and the hubby and kids are still licking their lips. This "easy-pleasey" recipe's going into our rotation for sure. Thanks Joy!

10 STARS!  This is awesome!  I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, but otherwise followed the recipe accordingly.  Baked at 375 degrees for one hour.  Even though I lined my baking pan with foil, it still leaked and I see 3 days of soaking ahead.  But who cares!  This dinner was absolutely wonderful -- causal company worthy!  I served with mashed potatoes because we had no red taters.  Homey, comfort food!  You have got to try this one, folks!

This was great! The juices from the pineapple and the bbq sauce really kept the chicken moist. I thought the temp and time were too high and too long so I lowered both and I wish I had just listened to the recipe. I kept turning up the temp and I left it in for over an hour! Thanks for the great recipe :-)

WOW!!! This is one of the easiest and most delicious recipes I've ever tried. As others mentioned, it smells wonderful while cooking. I used brown sugar BBQ sauce and I didn't have any red potatoes, so I threw in a package of frozen mixed baby potatoes and other veggies, and it turned out much better than I expected. The chicken was very moist and just peeled apart. Thank you for this recipe!

I read a variety of reviews before trying this recipe, and I've made a few modifications myself as well. I've made it three times now, once for a dinner party, and it has been very well received every time. I add a bit of soy sauce, Worcestershire, and white vinegar to the sauce, and reduced the pineapple juice. I add the vegetables only for the last 15 minutes of baking because they could, indeed, be soggy and overcooked if they sat in the sauce for the whole hour. Oh, and I marinate the chicken in the sauce for 24 hours before cooking. In any case, my family and friends and I LOVE this recipe! It's easy and delicious; I highly recommend it!

I will make this again, pretty tasty! I used chunk pineapple and probably would have added more than one can as I really liked the pineapple flavor. You definitely need to bake/parboil your potatoes. I microwaved mine a little thinking they would finish cooking with the rest of the ingredients but they were hard as a rock... we put them back in the oven for at least another hour. Hubby loved it, will make it again.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I was a little nervous about combining all of the pineapple, potatoes, bell peppers and bbq sauce.  I didnt think it sounded to good but after I read the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  I thought it was very flavorful and I loved how the chicken turned out so tender and moist. The pineapple and the bbq sauce gave it just the right... ZING! My family and I agreed that we didnt care to much for the potatoes being cooked along with the other ingredients. So, next time I am going to serve the chicken over mashed potatoes as one reviewer had already mentioned.  You could also serve it over rice if you want.  I also thought that I might marinate the chicken in the pineapple sauce for a little while.  It just added such a good favor to the chicken the first time.  I think marinating it longer would make it even better. The cooking time was perfect.  I took the advice of other reviewers and lined my pan with tin foil.  But, before I did that I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray..BOY AM I GLAD I DID!  It still leaked through the foil some, but because I had sprayed the pan previous the clean up was no big deal.
If you are looking for a dish that is different and pretty darn tasty then give this one a try.  I will be adding this to my recipe box for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delish!  My husband said "The sauce in this is great!"  I did as one reviewer stated and lined my dish with tin foil.  That was a great idea.  Will have this again.

I modified this recipe according to other reviewers' suggestions: I left out the potato and peppers; I let the chicken marinate in the pineapple juice and BBQ sauce for about an hour before cooking, and I cooked the dish for 40 mins at 425. 
I prepared white rice as a side dish, and it was a great compliment. I will make this again, but next time I will use less pineapple juice. I would have liked the sauce left in the pan to be thicker.

Overall, this is a simple, quick prep recipe, using pantry items that I almost always have.

I am also stingy with stars :)
Thank you for sharing!

this was easy and good, will definitely make again and again, we loved it!  

but i would suggest par boiling the potatos or just leaving them out b/c my potatos were thin sliced and came out crunchy, but the chicken was cooked perfectly (i also left out the green pepper).

This was a scrumptious dish!  It does sound weird pairing potatoes with pineapple and bbq sauce, but it worked!  I loved the sauce on the potatoes and chicken!  My husband loved the pineapple chunks in it, but for me I think they clashed a bit eating them along with the potatoes.  So I just ended up giving all the pineapple to my husband and he gobbled them up.  I do think next time I will add in sliced onion and another potato....maybe omit the pineapple chunks or put them on the side for hubby!  The first 30 minutes I left the chicken out and covered the dish with foil to help cook the potatoes faster.  Then the last 30 minutes uncovered and added the chicken to cook.  Doing it that way, it didnt risk over cooking the chicken and making it tough, and it made the potatoes perfectly cooked even being sliced into normal sized chunks.  It was perfect at that high of heat, and made the sauce nice and thickened.  I served this with a side of rice.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will be making again!

This was absolutely delicious. I microwaved the potatoes for 4 minutes before I sliced them and they came out perfect. You also need to season the chicken with basic salt and pepper to get a little more flavor.

Excellent.  Made it just as written except I used red instead of green pepper, and pineapple chunks instead of rings.  Turned out perfect...had no problems with the potatoes cooking..they came out just right!

IF I COULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS I WOULD. AS THE KIDS SAY, OMG...THE BEST MEAL I HAVE MADE/EATEN IN AGES, & I'M AN AVID/EXPERT COOK! MY HUSBAND, WHO NEVER LIKES SWEET WITH SAVORY, PROBABLY COULD HAVE EATEN IT ALL...& I USED 8 SKINNED THOUGH BONE IN THIGHS [OUR FAVORITE]. I'M A LITTLE EMBARASSED TO ADMIT WE FINISHED IT ALL! SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD, REAL SOUTHERN COOKED COMFORT FOOD!!!
JUST A NOTE: WE DON'T CARE FOR PEPPERS, & I HAD SEVERAL SHALLOTS, SO I PUT THEM IN. ALSO, LIKE OTHERS, THE THINLY SLICED POTATOES WEREN'T FULLY COOKED, SO I PUT THE LID ON FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR OF COOKING....TOTALLING 1-1/2HR. COOKING TIME [SINCE I USED DARK MEAT, & DOUBLED THE AMOUNT].  I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW THE SAUCE THICKENED AS WELL. APPARENTLY THE WORDS WRITTEN ON MY KITCHEN WALL ARE TRUE....COOKING IS LOVE MADE VISABLE!  THANK-YOU JOY!

I had half a rotisserie chicken to use and didn't have time for the oven, so I modified it for the stovetop, and it turned out beautifully. I started with sauteed peppers and onions. Then I cooked the potatoes separately (20 minutes in boiling water), shredded the chicken, and cooked it all in the barbeque sauce and pineapple. Was ready in less than 30 minutes and tasted great.

I am newly married and attempting to cook delicious meals for my new hubby. This was such an easy recipe - I figure anyone can do it! Now my hubby refers to me as an awesome cook and I didn't even have to go through any hassle to make him an amazing meal!  Plus, we both LOVE pineapple! I made it for my family and they really enjoyed it. It's so true that the pineapple & juice makes the chicken SO tender. 1 time I was out of pineapple and just used OJ. Still wonderful but would prefer the original recipe. You can add so many things though: potatoes, onions, carrots, or bell peppers (capsicum). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

This recipe was surprisingly good! Didn't think I would like pineapple and chicken but since I was looking for something new, I decided to try it anyway. It had the house smelling yummy after only two minutes in the oven. My daughter loved it and so did I. Can't wait to try it out on my husband when he gets back from his deployment. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

WONDERFUL! I loved this recipe! The only change I made was I used a can of whole potatoes instead of slicing red potatoes. For the BBQ sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet ’n Spicy. Next time I might try using fresh green beans instead of a green pepper just to see how that would taste. Overall a wonderful, easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I'm a new to cooking and I've always been a little afraid to cook chicken for some reason so this was a perfect starter recipe for me. I made this for a group of people one night for dinner and everyone loved it! The chicken turned out so juicy and the BBQ sauce complimented the pineapple juice perfectly. I'm actually making this again tonight. So good.

This was absolutely excellent! My husband loved it too. I made a couple of changes and used Red Garnet yams (sliced fairly thin) in place of potatoes, and red bell peppers in place of the green peppers. For the barbeque sauce I used original Sweet Baby Ray's, and pineapple tidbits instead of slices. It was really great served with rice cooked in chicken broth with lots of sauteed celery in it.  I wish I had taken everyone's advice about lining the pan with foil! :) Next time for sure!

The chicken was very moist and fell apart. The flavor profile was not to our liking. Almost a creole flavor. Maybe I used the wrong barbeque sauce. There are so many variants on the market maybe more specific guidance would be helpful. This was only OK...

This is my first review, I just had to say how AMAZING this recipe is.  I make it almost every week.  It's one of my favorite dishes I've ever had in my life and my bf loves it!  I dice the potatoes small and heat them in the microwave with some water for 4 mins before so that they aren't hard, and I dice green pepper and red onion, but don't add until the last 20 mins of cooking or they get too soft.  I use Diana Sauce for Ribs and Chicken and it with the pineapple is perfection.  When I'm low on bbq sauce I add teriyaki sauce and spices to the bbq and it is great like that too. You can experiment with your type of potatoes and veggies, and even adding nuts os great. You must try this!!

Excellent recipe! Yummy and so easy! I sauteed an onion and added that only because I had time. (I will definitely add an onion every time, though, I just may not  sautee it every time.) I followed other suggestions and sliced the potatoes fairly thin and they cooked perfect.

This recipe was really good...it was nice to find a recipe that the whole family enjoyed.  We just had it last night and our son already asked when we're having it again.  I made the chicken and served it over rice...so simple and so yummy.  Thanks ;)

Made this for dinner this evening and the entire family enjoyed it.  I added half an onion and put the veggies on top of the chicken since I didn't have space around the chicken.  I didn't have potatoes so I served over rice which was great with the sauce.

I would have given it 2 stars but my mom liked it so I'll go with 4.  It was way too sweet for my taste (and I used an original flavor BBQ sauce-one that was not sweet to begin with).  I can't imagine what it would taste like with a sweet BBQ.  I felt like I was eating potatoes with syrup on them, quite gross to me.  But, like I said, my mom really enjoyed it--enough for seconds.  It is an easy recipe and I just threw everything in a baking bag (baked the potatoes for 30 minutes first then added the chicken and green peppers and cooked about 30 more minutes).  Very easy but not suited to my taste...perhaps with some chili pepper in it...

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added onion and carrots to mine and it was just excellent. My husband really enjoyed it. He's not into carrots and peppers but he really liked them in this dish. It was so simple to make and I will definately be making it again!

This was pretty good. It was certainly easy and fast. It smelled great in the oven. I added more potatoes and less bbq sauce- basting occasionally/adding more sauce. Hubby and toddler liked it too!

This was delicious. I followed the instructions (except for adding the pepper, and we used and we used pineapple chunks), except I scaled down everything because I'm only feeding two. My husband is super picky and he loved it. The sauce came out a little thin, but it was delicious.

My Husband could not stop raving about this.  I used 4 large chicken breast and Honey Mustard BBQ sauce.  I cooked it for an extra 15 minutes b/c the chicken was so thick. I also let the meal stand for 10 minutes or so so the juices would thicken.  There is barely any clean up and I was finished prepping it in 10 minutes!!  SSSHHH...don't tell my husband that :)

Easy and yummy.  My five-year-old loved it, which for me, is always a huge bonus. (So did my 11 month old, but she'll eat anything!)  I thought the potatoes, which I sliced VERY thin, were just a TINY bit undercooked, and I didn't love them coated in BBQ sauce, so next time I might just do them separately or make some rice instead.  But the flavor of this was quite tasty and the chicken was moist and delightful.

We loved this recipe at home... I made a few changes to it. Instead of using green peppers I made it with red peppers, added some carrots, potatoes, and pineapple chunks- I stuffed a whole chicken with the veggies and slow cooked it in the oven for a few hours... it was awesome! Thanks.

My husband liked this, but I wasn't impressed.  I didn't have green peppers, so I added carrots instead, and added extra pineapple as some other reviewers recommended.  Still, I thought the BBQ sauce overpowered the pineapple, and that's all I tasted.  I doubt I'll make this again as there are better 'Hawaiian Chicken' type recipes out there.

AWESOME!! We make this meal at least once every two weeks.  The combo between the BBQ sauce, pineapple and pepper is fantatic.  We did up the amount of peppers, potatoes and pineapple in the mix.  Use two cans of pineapple for the juice, may not use all the pineapple.

Great over white rice!

This was quick and easy...chicken comes out tender from pineapple juice, tastes like sweet barbeque chicken...maybe cut back on the barbeque sauce. But I can't say it was phenominal. I agree with another rating that says it would be better with different cuts of chicken. It worked in my limited pantry night pinch. Thank you for the suggestion!

This turned out really well. I served this with potatoes on the side so I omitted the potatoes in the dish and instead added sliced onion. I reduced the oven temp to 425 but followed as written otherwise. The result was very good. I think it would also be good with different cuts of boneless chicken (thighs, bone-in breasts).

I tried this because a friend of mine said it was terrific.  My family and I also liked it.However, I would make some changes next time. I would leave out the green pepper and the pineapple pieces- after an hour of cooking time, they were very very soggy, we didn't like the texture of it. The overall  flavor was wonderful. The chicken was so tender and moist, we cut it with a fork!  All in all I would make this again.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  The mixture of sweet and hot was perfect.  I can see why some people would take this to a potluck.  I used Famous Dave's Rich and Spicy BBQ sauce.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe SOUTHERGIRL5!

This was quick, easy and had a great flavors.  I used both red and green bell peppers and 1/2 an onion sliced longways. I also used chunk pinapple and combined all the veges together then put them on top of the chicken in a  dutch oven pot with a lid. Also added garlic powder on the chicken. As another review said you could cut the chicken with a fork.  Will definetly make this again.

This recipe is fantastic! We've had it twice this week. I was leary about the potatoes at first, but once I tried it, I wouldn't change a thing. Thank-you for the great recipe!

Simple, easy, basic good food.  I left out the potato as I was serving the chicken with a roasted sweet potato and papaya salad.  Dinner was delicious, but not something I would make again.

I tried this recipe a few different times. I thought that the oven temp would be better for bone in breast so thats what i tried first. It was awesome! However i did microwave the potatoes a few minutes before slicing them and used only half the pineapple juice. I also added red onion and mushrooms. My husband perfered to try it with boneless breast. After a few failers i managed to get it right only it took alot longer than 1 hour. I tried tasting the chicken after 1 hour and it was tough. I used the whole can of pinapple juice this time and it was still watery. I continued to cook it at 450 to thicken up the sauce. I had a rotisseri chicken in the fridge as a back up. About a half hour later the potatoes were tender and the sauce was thicker and to my surprise the chicken was even tender! My husband and my 25y/o son loved it!

I made this tonight and it was a big hit!  so easy and very tasty, served with rice, peas and corn.  I added brown sugar soy sauce and worch. sauce to the pineapple juice (used to cans) to give it an Asian flare, than drizzled barbecue sauce and a hot and zesty marinating sauce over the chicken!  it was so yummy! Kids loved it!  :) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Tried it twice. It turned out perfect the first time and we loved it.  The second time the potatoes never softened and I cooked it a half hour longer to try and get them softer but no luck.  Not sure why but it still tasted good.

Successful! I think it would take approximate 45 minutes of baking. Potatoes and chickens were completely done within 45 mins. Potatoes would become burn if I decided to bake for an hour. I think it is depending on what kind of stove we have. I enjoyed this dinner! I would love to eat it again. Many thanks for your recipe!

Yummy and easy!  What could be better than that? I was reluctant to include the potatoes, but they were great.  I added baby carroh which I highly recommend.  I only had a small can of pineapples, so added a small can of mandarin oranges along with its sauce and that worked well too.  Loved the combo of fruit juices with the BBQ sauce!

Awesome!  And so easy!  I added some onions to it also and a can of crushed pineapple.  And new baby potatoes.  My husband raved about it.  Also good with pheasant.

So delicious! A new family favorite! I doubled the amount of peppers, potatoes and pineapple. I added one sliced onion (thanks for the tip!) and extra BBQ sauce. It was perfect. The next night I had some chicken left but not a lot of sauce and veggies. In a heavy pot, I put in onions, peppers and potatoes. Since I only had a couple of pineapple slices, I used some of my kids' fruit cups- 2 peaches and one fruit coctail. I topped it off with more BBQ sauce and heated it for an hour. It was just as good! This was a hit! THanks!!

I tried this recipe months ago and now we have it at least once a week. It's so easy and delicious!
I just pick up a bag of frozen chicken breasts, defrost them, put them in a pan and cover them with pineapple chunks and a bottle of barbecue sauce and bake them at 375 for 45 minutes if I don't have time to add the veggies :) 
 Never fails to be fantastic!

Fantastic recipe... what a great combination of flavours. My only comment would be to boil the potatos a little before cooking just to soften as they were quite hard.  Will definitely use again.

The veggies were great, but the chicken didn't absorb much flavor even though I marinated it in juice and sauce as recommended.  Also, I sliced the potatoes thin, but still seemed to overcook the chicken before the potatoes were done.

it was very easy, and the hint about lining the baking dish was incredibly helpful, but this dish was too sweet for my taste. i would've liked a little more flavor to the chicken.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I cut it in half (except for the pineapple), and instead of placing the veggies around the chicken, I layered everything together in a casserole dish.  Make sure you THINLY slice the potatoes so they are sure to be cooked. It turned out beautifully!

This recipe gets points for ease.  I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I used baby yellow and red bell peppers instead of the green and I omitted the potatoes. (I served this with rice balls)  It was good, the kids liked it, but at the end of the day it was  just chicken with barbecue sauce and pineapples poured over it.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I loved every bite. I cut the chicken into 2" pieces, used pineapple chunks, and used red pepper, green pepper, and onion. The sliced red potatoes had a great taste with the bbq sauce. My husband and I both loved it! I will definitely make again. Simple and delicious!

I made this for dinner last night since I had taken chicken out of the freezer and didn't know what to do with it!  I had everything on hand and it was great!  The only changes I made were to use 3 pounds boneless, skinless thighs, 2 green peppers, and about 1 cup of BBQ sauce instead of the whole bottle since one of my sons does not care for BBQ sauce.  The result, the sauce was a bit thin but over rice this was a hit with the whole family.  The pineapple juice makes the chicken so tender! We are actually happy to eat the leftovers tonight!

Amazing! Very Simple and Easy to cook. I loved the combination of BBQ and Pineapple. I added more pineapple juice than recommended because i could never really taste the pineapple as much as i would have liked. It also didnt take me an hour to cook. It only took me 40mins so keep a look out to make sure they dont over cook. Thanks so much for posting the recipe. Its our new favorite dinner!

I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it made a very nice dinner.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and foil lined my pan and I also par boiled my chunky potatoes before adding.  I topped with just 3 rings of pineapple since I am not a fan of cooked pineapple but the barbecue sauce on this made it so delicious.  The chicken turned out moist and flavorful, and l hr on 400 was plenty, husband ate more than his share.  Make sure you use your fav barbecue sauce because that makes all the difference.

This turned out really well, all my roomates ate it right up. At first they were kind of put off by the ingredient list but after they tried it they really liked it. The only reason i don't give it a five is because no one said "Wow" and I'm stingy with 5's.

This is a fantastic recipe which I made today for the first time. It was a big hit with my family. I used masterpiece brown sugar barbecue sauce and also added some frozen sliced carrots. The aroma from the oven was heavenly. I can't believe something so easy could taste so wonderful. As my husband said during dinner, " This meal is a home run".

Review of this recipe is mixed.  But maybe it is me??  I followed the ingredients exactly, kind of:  chicken tenders instead of breasts; pineapple tidbits instead of slices; white potatoes for red.  I thought 450 for one hour was too high for too long, but didn't see the time and temp mentioned in any other reviews, so went for it.  The green pepper was way overcooked; the potatoes were not done.  I removed the green pepper and chicken and returned the potatoes to the oven for another fifteen minutes.  I may have cut the potatoes too thick.  The potatoes were barely done.  The sauce was way too acidic.  I liked it, but it gave me a tummy ache.  And, was the dish supposed to be covered or uncovered?  The recpe didn't say.  I started with what I would consider a larger casserole than the medium size indicated, and the covered casserole boiled over in the oven.  (I was not surprised at 450!) I removed the cover about half-way through.  I want to try this again, but next time with less pineapple juice, maybe half, parboiled potatoes, and a lower temp.  And I will add the green peppers for the final twenty minutes or so.

I made this for dinner tonight and served it with rice. I liked it but thought it was a little watery. Maybe next time I will only put half the pineapple juice in.

I thoght this was very good.  The potatoes, pepper, and pineapple all went together really well.  I wouldn't change a thing except maybe experimenting with different bbq sauces.  I used regular flavor- thought it was a bit sweet, but overall liked it and it was soooo easy to fix.  Thanks!

Had this for the first time at my daughters.  It is delicious.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  My husband is very picky and he had seconds so I think he enjoyed it.

This was delicious!  I was looking for a super-easy, minimal-ingredients pineapple chicken, and this is it!  I really piled on the potatoes, peppers and pineapple.  I didn't marinade anything and it turned out just wonderful!

Thank you Joy for the great recipe. I was wanting to do something with Chicken and Pineapple. I added some jerk seasoning to the chicken for a little kick. the pineapple juice and the bbq sauce thickened up a made a great sauce.

I made this recipe for a large family gathering, several people had food sensitivities and this dish was PERFECT. Can easily be made gluten free and as long as you make sure your pineapple juice is 100% (no syrup added) it's pretty much perfect!
I added carrots (yep, they taste great cooked in pineapple juice!) and added jalapeno to spice it up the second time I made it. :)

This is my second time making this dish and my family loves it just the same as the 1st time. The only changes I made was I seasoned my chicken legs and leg quarters with onion and garlic powder, ground pepper and creole seasoning before mixing in the bbq sauce and pineapple juice.  Lastly I included some dark brown sugar  in  the mix .Great recipe, moist chicken sweet and savory!!

My family really liked this recipe. The prep is so fast. I used Sweet Baby Rays Hawaiian barbecue sauce. I did look at other reviews and microwaved the red potatoes for a few minutes prior to adding them to the chicken. The potatoes came out perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

Substituted orange juice for pineapple juice because we used a fresh pineapple. Marinated the chicken with about 8-10 ounces of orange juice, and half the bottle of BBQ sauce for an hour, then put the rest of the BBQ sauce on top of all the ingredients before putting it in the oven. A word of caution, we used a black pepper BBQ sauce, and it ended up being unfavorably peppery, so be aware. Overall, very delicious, would make it again for sure!

This was really good. I can't believe how easy it was to put together and everyone loved it. (The second time I made it I left out the potatoes and served the chicken and sauce over coconut rice.) Thank you.

This recipe was awesome!  The only thing I added was salt and pepper to the chicken before adding the pineapple and BBQ.  Despite the limited amount of ingredients and simplicity I was pleasantly surprised by the great flavor.  I loved the potatoes (had to slice them very thin) and bell pepper with this.  Will be adding this to my repertoire of recipes.

I hate to be the one to say this.  But I feel that it's necessary.  My entire family did not care for this.  I fought with my children to eat this, and my husband said "well at least our stomachs will be full".  I think I'm a pretty good cook, but it just tastes like cooked chicken and potatoes with a bottle of barbeque sauce dumped on it.  That's it.  No offense to the seemingly nice lady who submitted the recipe. It just did not suit our taste. P.S.  I followed the directions as is and did not make any alterations.

This recipe was okay. The chicken was very tender and moist, but the rest of it just wasn't that exciting. If I use the recipe again it will be for the chicken and pineapple by themselves.

We did not like this very much.  The combination of the ingredients didn't seem right.  I am giving it two stars because I realize that the barbecue sauce you select can make a big difference.  It just seemed way too sweet for our tastes.
