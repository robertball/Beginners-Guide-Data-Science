My 9 yr old daughter is a type 1 diabetic, so I used Splenda instead of sugar and diet lemon lime soft drink for a completely carb free treat for her!! She absolutely loves this drink, this recipe is a keeper in our house.

This was a pretty good drink that my kids and I liked. I used green food coloring for St. Patrick's Day. So I guess that made them greenies, but still good no matter what color you choose. Since it's just a vanilla flavored syrup, it is also good with a coke or pepsi. Of course you will not have the pretty effect. Thanks for sharing!
