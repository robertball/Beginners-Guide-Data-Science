I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and the sugar (I cut the sugar back to a quarter cup) for ten minutes, then added the potato flakes, milk, salt, eggs, flour and melted margerine. I kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes, then set the dough to rise for an hour or so in a large greased bowl on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and mixed the softened butter together with the brown sugar and cinnamon before I spread it on the dough. I sliced them up and set them in baking pans, covered them with foil and set them either on the warm heating pad or over my warm oven (I put six rolls in each pan. The reason I did this is because I wanted room for them to rise and I didn't want to worry about some rolls being undercooked in the end). 400 degrees for a little over 15 minutes and they were done. When I made the icing, I used milk instead of water and I did increase the vanilla a touch. They look beautiful. One pan is a gift for my in-laws, one pan is for my son's birthday breakfast tomorrow. EDITED REVIEW: Everyone loved them, especially the birthday boy.

I love these cinnamon rolls! They're not too sweet, or too fat, just perfect. Of course you could add more filling, if you like.

These rolls are in the oven as I type this and they look and smell delicious! But I do have to comment on the fact that I think this recipe is referring to Florence Henderson, not Hendrickson. Anyway, great rolls!

To be honest, the reason I chose this recipe was because I had all the ingredients on hand.  They were very easy and my boys (4 of them) devoured the first batch.  I used my Kitchenaide pastry hook to knead the dough, and a Pampered Chef stoneware jellyroll pan to bake them.  

I've never done any yeast breads before, but now I'm encouraged to try more.

The first time I made these (shared with the neighbors in trade for melons) everyone raved and even claimed  they were better than infamous county fair cinnamon rolls-there a little time consuming but worth every minute. They are now a treat in our house.
