I thought it was very good.  I used rum instead of the vanilla.  It will be a regular holdiay dessert.

This was all right.  I LOVE creme brulee, so I guess I shouldn't stray :o)  I also like eggnog, and wanted a "festive" dessert for my Christmas Eve dinner. The directions were good, I had no trouble, it set up nicely, the consistancy was good- I don't know, it just was kind of..... not creme brulee.  Maybe it was TOO eggnog-y or something.  If you ADORE eggnog, this may perfect for you!  If I were to make it again I think I'd add some southern comfort or brandy or something, and replace some of the eggnog with cream.

SO GOOD!  The marscapone makes it amazing.  I also used a lot of rum instead of vanilla and it was so delicious.  If I make regular creme brulee again I will absolutely use the marscapone.

I was craving an eggnog pie, so I used this recipe as the filling. I made it as listed on the site, except I added brandy in place of the optional vanilla. I baked the filling in a deep dish regular pastry pie crust, in a water bath, until firm, approximately 55 minutes. Just awesome - great rich eggnog flavor, with a firm creamy texture from the marscapone. Since there was no burnt sugar on top, I would compare this more to a custard than a creme brulee. I will definitely make again, as custard or pie. Yummy!!

I thought this was fantastic.  I love creme brulee and eggnog and this combines the two well.  I covered the top in a half white/half brown sugar topping and torched it to give it that restaurant creme brulee taste and it turned out marvelous.

It was very good.  I liked the idea of adding Mascapone cheese.  However, it's pretty pricey, so I substituted cream cheese.  The recipe said nothing about the brulee sugar on top so this was more like an Eggnog custard.  I know how to brulee so I just added some white sugar on the top of each and torched it.  Very simple.  I used it for a pre-Christmas dinner party and everyone said they loved it.  I know I'll make it again so long as the eggnog is still available in the grocery store.

this was delicious and I did add 1/4 cup Brandy to take it over the top.....  I doubled the recipe - plan alcohol accordingly! an additional note is that normally I place the ramekins in a 9x13 inch baking pan with 1 inch of water for very even baking.

I loved this! My kids thought it was too "eggnog-y", but IT'S EGGNOG CREME BRULEE, for goodness sake! I did add the optional vanilla, but not the nutmeg or cinnamon. I was able to get 6 ramekins instead of 4. Once they were set, I sprinkled each with a couple of teaspoons of sugar and then used a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar. Topped with a couple of fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint. Yum!

Very festive! Everyone loved it. I thought I would keep it basic though so I didn't use cheese. I also cut the egg nog about 50:50 with half and half cream, then used a pinch of cinnamon. Once it had been refrigerated for 3 hours, I spread a thin, even layer of white sugar on top and caramelized it with a brulee torch. It worked out perfectly. Very interested to try it with spiced rum!

this was easy and a great way to use up some leftover eggnog and mascarpone cheese I had bought for a holiday dish. It tasted great and came out super creamy. Would definitely recommend!

Delicious!  Kind of formed its own crust.  Made more than it says, but I certainly didn't mind. :)

Delicious custard, but really thin in my pie crust... Do not use in a 10 inch pie plate! Next time, I will make it as custard and not pie.

With this delicious recipe, think "custard" not "creme brulee" and I think you will be happier with the outcome. If you are expecting a creme brulee texture, you will be a bit disappointed, but if you make this with the expectation that you will have a delicious eggnog custard, you will most likely be very happy. I make this as written with the exception of using Neufchatel cheese in place of the mascarpone and it is a family favorite that is absolutely delicious! I do not brulee the top, but that is just personal preference. I just think it is perfect as is!
