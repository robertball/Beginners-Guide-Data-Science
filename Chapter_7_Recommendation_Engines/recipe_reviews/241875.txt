There are so many different aromas and savours here, each unique on its own, yet they come together so nicely for this earthy blend - it seems like they have always belonged together. Much better than any store bought blend. Thank you TheBritishBaker for this recipe.

I went all over town and couldn't find this spice, I was happy to find this recipe to make my own.  I have no idea how close it is if I would of bought it, but don't really care.  I trusted the reviews on here.

I cannot find this locally. I use it in Easy Indian Butter Chicken and it has a delicious flavor.

If you love Indian cooking,  you will love this homemade spice mix. This is the best tandoori recipe I've run across.  Just love it!

I have tried numerous recipes for "garam masala" spice mix , but hadn't heard of Tandoori Masala.  In the past I have toasted the seeds and ground my own.  Today I got lazy and had all the pre-ground spices (except I did have to grind the fenugreek).  I'm very happy with the taste of this blend, as is my husband who enjoyed it in a "Butter Chicken" dish just as TheBritishBaker  (who shared this recipe) did.  I didn't change a thing.

This spice mix is AMAZING! So many flavors that all compliment each other perfectly. Sprinkle it over everything. It's particularly delicious over chicken thighs and cauliflower for a quick and easy sheet-pan dinner.

This is the second time I've made it. I used it in butter chicken the first time; this time I'm making tandoori chicken. I added a tsp of paprika this time for a bit of colour and a bit of zip.
