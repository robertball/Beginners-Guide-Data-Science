I normally don't like to try a recipe that has no reviews but any recipe that starts with a jar of marinated artichoke hearts is worth a try! My family and I were not disappointed! I didn't have Madeira wine so I substituted Chicken broth. Also most of the spices I had dried from my garden so I only guessed the amount I put in (I may have been a little heavy handed). I would love to try this recipe with sausage instead of chicken and add some fresh spinach to the mix and some feta cheese along with the mozzarella. But it was very good the way it was written. Thanks Melissa for sharing!

I thought I'd try this with hot and sweet Italian sausage (bulk meat-no casings) and substituted sliced green bell peppers for the artichokes.  Delicious!

A huge hit with my husband & teenage son! Made just as the recipe was written (used a cab instead of Madera). Served with fresh green beans & garlic parmesan biscuits. Will definitely be making again!

This is a nice simple prep dish for a weeknight family meal. I prepared in the morning covered with foil and then just poppped in the oven at dinner time. I found it a bit on the bland side even with some doctoring. I added orange and green pepper stips to the mix a very pretty presentation. I also marinated my chicken in italian dressing for even more flavor and used some extra spices. Depite these efforts this just didn't knock me out. The wine was lost perhaps more in the sauce? Maybe some red pepper flakes too. And I might add some chunks of hot italian sausage mixed with the chicken pieces. Hubs said this was "not up to my standard" OUCH! But I sincerely thank you for sharing this recipe I think it was just the wrong dish for our tastes.

This was absolutely AMAZING!! I did substitute thyme for rosemary...my personal preference. I did not add in the mushrooms or olives. Other than that I made the recipe as stated. It was phenomenal and I will make it again in a heartbeat. My boyfriend suggested using the leftovers as a pizza topping and it was so tasty!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Excellent, with the following changes.  Throw a whole chicken in the crockpot and add the rest of the ingredients (except cheese).  No need to cut up the chicken or brown it. Cook on low for 8 hours. Serve over spaghetti sprinkles with parmesan cheese.  The chicken falls of the bone and is very tender and tasty.

Actually didn't realize the time frame for cooking. Put it in the crock pot on low for 2 hrs until we returned home and the juice soaked right into the chicken making it an awesome dish! Thx

Excellent and easy to make. My husband loved it except for the olives because he doesn't like olives but there is only 1/3 of a cup so they are hardly noticeable. Great flavor.

This was delicious! So happy to have come upon this recipe. I was in search of a faceless recipe and was pleasantly surprised to find one this delicious! I used sherry instead of the Madeira wine and I left out the olives as we aren't fans of them. So many wonderful flavors in this dish. Thanks for sharing!

We LOVED this but I did make a few changes! In addition to the chicken I also added in some sweet Italian sausages cut into chunks that I boiled for a bit and then cooked in the pan w/ the chicken to brown. I didn't use the amount of oregano/basil that was called for b/c I didn't want a strong herb-y flavor so I just used some Italian seasoning to taste. Also didn't have the wine that was called for so I just used a nice splash of white wine and that worked for us. Totally forgot the mozz. cheese but will add it next time (not that it even needed it). Everyone really enjoyed the flavors of this and I it was so easy to make! This is a keeper for my family YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

I made this recipe for my husband and myself last night. It was merely excellent. Other than adding extra mushrooms I followed the recipe exactly. I will certainly make this again. It is an excellent comfort food with good mouth feel and interesting flavor notes.

Loved the base combination. Using a rotisserie chicken I skipped to step three as I loved the idea of using the tasty marinade from the artichoke hearts to saute down the vegetables of choice. I added a home grown diced habanero and a dash of cumin and tumeric as we love those flavors in a tomato based sauce. Also added the zest and juice of a lemon and a chopped green pepper and capers ( almost a puttanesca sauce) and never bothered with the baking step since the chix was cooked and we omitted the cheese. After the tomatoes were added I let it cook for an hour to take the raw out of them and allow the whole mix to marry in flavor and then added the cooked chicken.

I left out the mushrooms added a green and red pepper and zucchini. I used chicken broth in place of the wine. I didn t think in the first step(browning the chicken in the marinade from the artichoke hearts) actually browned the meat although it didn t seem to effect the final dish. I will definitely be making this again.

This was excellent even though I didn't have any chicken breasts so I had to use leg quarters. I also added 16 oz of fresh spinach to the onion cooking stage. I will definitely make this again.

I did not have artichokes so just browned the chicken in olive oil and then added the other ingredients. Used more tomatoes than the recipe called for as we like lots of sauce for the pasta. I did not add mozzarella. Good flavors but the chicken was rather dry. Next time I will use chicken thighs which would have better flavor and be more moist.

This is really tasty. It's the first time I've made it. I made the mistake of thawing boneless thighs instead of breasts. Outside of that I made it just like the recipe calls for. Next time I'm going to use breasts. It's a keeper for me.

I worked for a caterer that made a wonderful chicken cacciatore with black olives. For years I've been trying to duplicate her recipe. This one comes pretty close. I followed the recipe with the exception of the added wine & cheese. It didn't need it. I served it over polenta with a side salad. Yum! This dish was even better the next day as leftovers. So good! Thanks for the great recipe!

So good! With just a couple extra ingredients beyond what I usually have. I used green pepper instead of mushroom and didn't add the wine. Turned out great! Would love this with the sausage suggested by another reviewer. Leftovers tomorrow too!

Very different from other chicken cacciatore recipes I have made in the past but definitely a keeper. Made recipe exactly as stated as I like to do when rating. I used a cheaper Madeira wine for cooking that was very sweet. I am no expert on this wine but have read it can be very sweet or dry. When I make next time I will opt for a dryer version but that is just my taste. Thanks Melissa great recipe very tasty!!!

The flavours are great although I feel like it needs some kick in terms of red pepper flakes or sprinkling of cayenne pepper - that is if you are a spicy food fan.

I really loved this recipe. I didn't remove the sauce from a pan and put in a 9x13; I really didn't see the point of dirtying a lot of large dishes so instead when I removed the chicken I just put it in a bowl then put it back in with the rest and popped the whole pan of sauce into the oven (I used an oven safe skillet that I use for Shephard's pie). I had limited time when I made this and had to walk away so I didn't end up putting any wine or cheese on this dish but I can't say I noticed the lack at all. I did add more olives than called for ( a whole can) and left them whole as hubs does not care for olives. I don't care for mushrooms though so I also left them whole; he had my mushrooms and I had my olives so it worked perfectly. I will probably make this again and perhaps will remember the wine and cheese this time. I served over spaghetti. This makes a lot of food but the leftovers are just as good I don't mind. Thanks for the recipe!

I used boneless chicken thighs. It was good over egg noodles. I didn't have much cheese so I did not bake it with cheese. I used provalone cheese on top instead of mozzarella and shredded cheddar on the last bowl of left overs We will use this as our go to. Excellent made ahead of time. Next time I'll try it with chopped pork.and extra garlic. Guess it won't be chicken cacciatore then!
