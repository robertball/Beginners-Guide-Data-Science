I am anxious to try this recipe.  I have a much more basic recipe. It suggests you use a jar of carmel ice cream topping to pour over the top which might be easier.

I make a similar version of this cake but I use a chocolate cake mix for the cake, top the poked hole cake with butterscotch (caramel) sauce (and sometimes sweetened condensed milk in addition to the butterscotch sauce), sprinkle it with Heath / Skor bits, and top the cooled cake with Cool Whip.

Sinchy cake. Very easy to make. Check cake before the 50-60 minutes are up. My cake came out in 45 minutes. I used two 7 oz bags of Werther's Original Chewy Caramels. Took about three minutes to melt in the microwave. This is a VERY rich cake. I recommend Dryers Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to go with it. Yum! A little slice of this stuff goes a long way! Definitely better when warm.

Great tasting cake.  Will try cake recipe with other fillings or glazes also.  I think next time I make this recipe I'll use the carmel ice cream topping instead of melting carmels since it's easier.

I love this cake.  It goes together so easily and is delicious!  I took a shortcut and used caramel ice cream topping.  It was good but if you have the caramels, definitely use them because the topping was soaked up by the cake instead of being gooey caramel with cake.  Thanks for sharing!

Using Werther's Original for the caramel topping was sooooo good!

I don't know why but the cake came out tasting like clay.  I don't think I will try this recipe again.

I made this for Fathers Day and it was a hit! I substituted 5 oz milk chocolate chips melted in microwave instead of unsweetened chocolate, 3/4 C. plain nonfat yogurt and used only 1 1/4 C sugar.I also used regular ice cream caramel topping. My family loved it!!I only gave it four stars because the middle was still a little sticky and the edges were almost overdone. I didn't think it was too sweet- just right with either vanilla ice cream or milk.

this recipe was ok but a letdown. the flavor was nothing outstanding. I would have been happier with turtle brownies. by the way, I only had to bake mine for 35 minutes. Also, I poured the caramel all over the top, as getting it perfectly into the holes was a bit tough.

This cake is so rich that I can't eat it without ice cream.

Living in England I had to convert this recipe to metric. I think this may have been the reason why I seemed to end up with tons of caramel sauce, (which was absolutley gorgeous). It seemed to settle in a large pool in the middle of the cake. That being said the cake did go down extremely well with my work collegue. I will make this recipe again, only this time with less sauce!

Sounds like a winner and will taste similar to what I created. I used unflavored gelatin made with strong coffee to pour over a box mix cake, then drizzled with caramel topping. Whipped cream for frosting. I'm going to try yours out on my Grandson! Thanks!
