Wow!  These are great!  I made them for an annual cookie exchange, but my family ate them all before I got them wrapped up.  Luckily this is a quick recipe and didn't take much time to make another couple of batches, one for the exchange and another for my family.  Delicious! Thank you!

The "cookie" part of this dessert was not very tasty. There are so many yummy chocolate desserts out thers, I won't waste my time on this one.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The cookies spread way out and did not come easily off the pans and the taste was brownie-like at best.  Sorry I will stick to candy.
