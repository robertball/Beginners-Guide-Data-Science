I was skeptical about the sausage in here, but just curious enough to give it a try. Not a fan of the corn called for, I substituted chopped celery and added some minced garlic. I don't use turkey sausage, so I used Italian sausage instead. As it browned I added a good glug of Chardonnay. Both the garlic and the wine, I believe, contributed to what might have otherwise been a "flat" tasting soup.  Once the soup was done, I was not happy with how thin it was, so I cooked another cup of rice in chicken broth, added that to the soup, and it was MUCH better.  I garnished it with a squirt of mascarpone cheese and fresh chives.  I like this!  It's different!

Blended squash with cream of chicken soup and added skim milk to thin.  Cooked sausage with onions, fresh garlic, celery and red wine as advised by other reviewers.  Seasoned meat mixture with southwest seasoning, cumin, basil, flaked chili peppers and cayenne b/c I couldn't find spicy turkey sausage then added to squash mixture.  This soup was absolutely delicious.

I thought this was very tasty, but I did make some changes.  I added some minced garlic, used brown rice plus more than a 1/2 cup to thicken up the soup.  I used sweet turkey sausage and sauted it in chardonnay and topped off the soup with some mascarpone cheese as suggested by otehr reviewers.  My hubby liked it as well...I will be making this again as butternut squash is my favorite.
thanks Dena!

this soup was the BEST SOUP i've had in years. it seemed like sort of a strange combo, but trust me, amazing. you could make it a lot faster with a couple cans of pureed butternut squash, too, if you're short on time.

This soup was a big hit with the growups, but my daughter said it was a little too sweet.(Imagine that!)I used brown basmati rice, precooked in my rice cooker, instead of the white, and it added a nutty flavor and texture. I also added chopped celery for additional flavor and crunch. I did have problems wrestling the squash out of the piping hot skins, however, but I plan to peel them before roasting next time. Even better the next day! Yummy!

Great soup, I haven't served it to hubby yet, but I can't stop "testing" it! I only had low fat breakfast sausage and the seasoning are very pleasant with the butternut squash. I left out corn (personal preference) added garlic, celery and chopped fresh green beans-also didn't bother blending.

***6 years on, and this is still a favorite in my family.  I stumbled on my review when I was pulling the recipe to forward on to yet another friend.  I stopped measuring ingredients long ago, and now double this as a requirement for my people :)  We have used all manner of leftover rice in this soup (I throw leftover rice in the freezer in prep for this soup!!), but yellow rice is our favorite.  We are actually having this again tonight for dinner.  I only wish all my boys would leave me leftovers for lunch the next day...***


Original review from 2014:  Great soup!  I used regular pork sausage b/c I couldn't find turkey and I was afraid my young ones wouldn't like the heat - although I can see where it would really add alot!  My husband added some hot sauce to his bowl and again to his second. :)  I added not quite twice as much rice, but I was also short on corn.  Will definitely be making this one again!

I wasn't sure about this recipe because I've never cooked butternut squash before, but it was excellent!  Hearty and delicious.  Even my husband couldn't get enough, and he's not a big soup eater.

I used a little less ground pork sausage and it turned out great!!
You could also add other veggies like celery and carrots or even potatoes.

I followed some of the other reviews by roasting the squash, which makes things much easier. I'm not a big fan of rice in soup, so I substituted cubed red potatoes & it was fantastic.  It became more of a chowder, but it was perfect for a cold winter night!

This was my 1st time cooking any kind of squash - I followed the directions exactly and it was amazing!  My only critique is that the rice soaks up the broth, so now I don't add it to the pot, but instead add some cooked rice right before I serve it.

Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Took advise for others b/c i too didn't spicy sausage on hand, only turkey sausage. Added cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika, and crushed red peppers.  In small amounts.  Didnt want the spices to be overpowering.  I did add a small amount of cream at the end just to make it a little more on the creamy side. Thanks for the recipe and for the extra input. I'm enjoying this community of true and tried recipes!!!!!!!! :-)  Family is loving all the new and improved foods. :-)

A wonderful delicate balance of sweet and spice! It is surprisingly filling (especially after the 3rd bowl since you can't quit eating it) and it is even better as left-overs, that is if you have any left over.

Ok, this wasn't great. Actually the taste was ok, it was just kind of strange. Not certain if I agree that the sausage goes well with the squash. Next time I will try the plain creamy squash soup I think.

What a great combination of sweet and spicy!  Instead of rice, I used barley which added a great texture for a hearty soup.  As suggested, I used cumin, basil, cayenne and red pepper flakes with ground turkey and cooked with copious amounts of white cooking wine.  Roasted squash PEELED - easy to chop and blend.  I also added a hint of cinnamon give a warm spice to sweet and spicy.  To make healthier and less spicy, add plain yogurt instead of cream.

I don't like squash, but I had to give this a try. It was definitely worth it! I used pork sausage and added chopped celery. Also, to make it much quicker, microwave the squash. Cut the squash in half, remove the seeds. Put a little butter in each half, sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 5-7 minutes or until squash is tender. Then just scoop out of the peel and let cool before putting in the blender.

Great Soup!  I made it with Johnsonville Italian sausage and deglazed the pan with white wine per some other reviews --and it turned out delicious!

This soup was so good for a fall day! My only change is that I thought it had a bit too much pepper. Next time I'll just cut back on the pepper and give it 5 stars!

I added about 12 oz. of cream cheese instead of heavy cream, and added a little garlic, celery and chardonnay, as others suggested.  It was delicious!  I also deleted the corn.

Absolutely 5 stars for this one! I just made this and it was incredible! I made a few changes - I didn't add rice or corn and I used a can of fat free beef broth and some vegetable bouillon as well. SO GOOD!

Used Antelope Sausage instead of Turkey - so that definitely changed the flavor a bit. I didn't follow directions exactly, is the likely reason that this is not my favorite recipe, but I'm enjoying it nonetheless and would highly recommend trying it in your home as well!

It was great. I used acorn, butternut and spaghetti squash. I also added 2 minced cloves of garlic after browning the sausage. My picky husband called this "restaurant soup".

Very good. Made as directed except used spicy venison sausage. Did not use optional cream, as it was rich enough without. The butternut squash as a soup base is something I'll try with other recipes.

OH My GOODNESS, this soup is amazing! I made it as stated, but instead of corn, I added chopped spinach, I added garlic like other reviewers stated and added a little bit more brown rice than it called for. It was DELICIOUS...even my hubby, who normally doesn't like soup, had seconds. I usually don't leave reviews, but this was too good not to review!!  I didn't add the cream at the end, but did put a little so cream in my bowl and a little italian cheese shreds. DELISH!!

Made a few modifications. Spiced the sausage with cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, garlic, sea salt and pepper. I added baby bellas, and celery with the onions. I made jasmine rice and used 1c. sour cream in place of the cream.

I loved the taste, and so did my husband. He just doesn't care for the texture, so it won't be made again, unfortunately! I used brown rice. I couldn't find spicy turkey sausage, so I used regular turkey sausage & added approx 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and pepper. I also added 1 cup sliced carrots, steamed, and added them to the squash to puree. The mixture of ingredients is really what makes this soup stand out!

This soup is super yummy. My husband commented that it was like two different soups I've made before combined in to one. He loved it. The sausage goes great with butternut squash and the heavy cream is a yummy addition but definitely not a must for taste.

This was pretty good as written.  I did make a few changes based on what I had available, but overall stayed true to the base recipe.  Butternut and spicy sausage turned out to be an excellent combination - sweet, spicy, salty.  Yum!

This was the best squash soup I have ever had.  I made it without the cream to cut down on the fat and added a small spoonful of light sour cream on the top.  It was exceptional.  Both husband and 12 year old agreed.

This is a great recipe - I changed it up a little. I only had spicy italian sausage when I made it so I sauteed the onions and then the sausauge then added a little crushed red pepper flakes to make a little more spicy. I pureed the squash in the blender and added in the chicken stock with the rice and then added a little heavy cream at the end - YUMMY. My husband loves this dish!!!

Wow - this was fabulous! My husband, who doesn't like squash, really liked it, too! I couldn't find spicy turkey sausage and used regular sausage instead. To make it spicy I added a little cayenne while I was grilling the meat and onions. Be careful though, a little bit goes a LONG ways! :) We will definately have this again soon!

This time of year I enjoy soups very much and make a lot of them. This one I will not try again. Texture and flavor just  is not what we look for in a soup. Some may like it but, I don’t recommend  it.

Wow - what a great recipe! I went with mild sausage because of my kids and I thought I wouldn't like it (too bland) but what a surprise.  It was excellent - I can't wait to make it again and I haven't even finished the first pot!

I made this with roasted squash left over from thanksgiving, and subbed turkey broth for chicken broth, and added some chili flake.  I like to add yogurt after serving for added creaminess.

I love soups in the fall and this is one of my new favorites.  I did add a couple of dashes of crushed red pepper for a little more spice and to soften the sweetness.  I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 which left it creamy, but without the calories

In all fairness I had made a roasted butternut squash soup based on a mix of Red Drummond’s recipe for southwest version and Chef John’s version including vinegar but a much smaller amount. So, that soup was okay but missing something. I ran across this recipe and since I had hot Italian sausage on hand  I sautéed chopped onion, a bit more garlic and the crumbled sausage added it all to the soup which proved to be fabulous. BF loved it and he’s super picky about his food. Please note I did not add corn or rice or obviously follow this recipe as written but I chose to review as I think it’s a good guide and was very pleased with the sausage addition! Happy cooking!

This is a soup I will make again.  I gave it a five-star rating, but that rating is based on how I modified the recipe to my taste.  Reading so many comments about the rice, I decided to have it prepared and on the side for those who like rice (not me).  I used sweet turkey sausage because I'm not a fan of things that are too hot/spicy.  This left the soup a bit bland.   To compensate, I added garlic powder and chili powder.  Instead of heavy cream, I used a can of condensed milk.  The soup was delish!!!

Added one garlic clove and mixed frozen vegetables.  Tasted good but the addition of the cream did give a smoother consistency. Had to find a recipe with meat in it cause my husbands not crazy about butternut squash soup and I am.  This fit the bill.

The sausage was a little strong for me--maybe a bit less next time? Otherwise, this was a nice change from the many super smooth, almost sweet butternut squash soups out there.

I added a splash of white wine and sautéed two cloves of garlic with the onion.  It was very hearty, tasty soup.  Next time I will omit the corn.  I don't think it is needed.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 because it was awesome but I made a ton of changes to it.  First, I used smoked sausaged that I halved and sliced instead of loose, spicy sausage.  I also sauteed onions, celery, and carrots along with the sausage.  Toward the end I added about a cup of cheese and doubled the amount of rice called for.  It was five stars for sure that way.  Will definitely be making this again.

I must have done something wrong because this was inedible. I even tried to salvage it by adding cheese to it. Maybe it's possible that I had a bad butternut. I'm really sorry but I did not care for this at all.

I have made this twice and each time it's deeeeeelicious!! I have no idea what size or the quantity of squash to use so i've just added more or less water/broth. I love how thick and hearty it is. Great wintery meal with so many great ingredients. i recommend it all the time!

Following the recommendations of others, I added wine, celery, garlic and more rice to this recipe. This is definitely a recipe with a sweet and spicy taste--if that's a flavor combination you enjoy, you'll probably like this soup. Most of the flavor comes from the sausage, so make sure you take that into consideration. I definitely enjoyed making this unique recipe and I'm sure I'll make it again in the future.

This is one amazing soup, exaclty the way it is!!  I used it last year, and got rave reviews at thanksgiving!  I couldn't wait for squash season this year to break it out again.  There is no need for the cream, it is plently thick and creamy enough without it!

Delicious!!! My boyfriend & I made it for a little family dinner, & everybody loved it. Made some changes: replaced the turkey sausage with chicken sausage (the kind with chunks of apples in it, which made the soup sweeter), ditched the corn, & instead added 2 potatoes, cubed, as suggested by some other users. Thank you for the great recipe!

I really liked this soup, I did use tofurky italian sausage and soy creamer instead of heavy cream. (to make it vegan)  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and cumin.  Left out the corn and added celery as some others mentioned.  Very good!  Served with a slice of cornbread.

This recipe was amazing!  I did everything exactly as the recipe called for, except that I used chicken boullion instead of broth, and no cream.  I used chicken italian sausage, which was great!  I was really unsure as I have never cooked with butternut squash before, but it turned out fantastic--even my husband was pleasantly surprised!  Oh, and make sure you bake the seeds, just like pumpkin seeds only better!

Outstanding! The only changes I made were to use chopped andouille sausage (what I had onhand) and finished the soup with half-n-half. I bet kielbasa would be great in it, as well.  I added a cup or so of extra cooked rice to make it thicker. Soooo good!

I really liked this soup and thought it was so perfect for fall.  I felt it was a little bland, though, so I added some garlic powder and a few other spices, which seemed to help.  I also doubled the rice, and thought it came out much thicker and nicer.

I submitted this recipe, you will need to use one large butternut squash or two smaller ones.  Try blending the squash with one can of soup first and check the consistency, add more depending on how thick or thin you prefer your soup.  Sometimes when I'm feeling very lazy I'll just buy frozen or canned squash to cut down on time.  The soup is highly adaptable.  Any type of rice you have on hand and other vegetables you want to throw in work fine I think.  I just posted as my favorite way.

Excellent!  Butternut squashes come in many different sizes and mine was obviously smaller than needed for this recipe.  Weight would have been a good idea for the recipe.  I did roast it, just do it with enough time for it to cool off a bit to work with.  I used less broth because it was pretty runny after two cups.  I also used some left over brown rice from PF Changs which made it even easier!  I added a little half and half at the end since I didn't have cream on hand.  My husband and I raved about it.  However, my two year old wouldn't touch it.  Oh well, we liked it so much we'll be making it again soon.

This was a hit at our house.  Even my 3 year old liked it!  After the squash was cooked, I let it cool while I cooked the rice.  Then I peeled the skin off instead of scooping it out.  Also, I used a pretty spicy sausage and reduced the black pepper by half.  This took me 2 hours from start to finish, but I also have two young children (many interruptions).

This was *so* good.  I used two cans of cream corn instead of frozen corn and cream (because that is what I had on hand).  My husband and daughter really enjoyed it.
