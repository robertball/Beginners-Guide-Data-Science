Luscious is the best way to describe this frosting. As I read through the recipe I was a little skeptical about the fact that it called for no butter, and indeed, as I mixed it up, I couldn't help but add a couple of tablespoons which I found made this a lot creamier.  Rather than opening up a can of evaporated milk for such a small amount called for, I simply used half and half (milk would be fine too) until I had the desired consistency to pipe it onto "Banana Cupcakes," also from this site. Rich, chocolatey, creamy and not too sweet, this was simply perfect.

Excellent recipe and easy. You can substitute half-n-half or milk if you don't have evaporated milk. Not too sweet and very creamy, but I had to add a little more half-n-half to get the consistency I wanted. And it's more than enough to cover a large cake and sides.

This was very quick and easy to whip up and spread over a layer cake.

I used half fat cream cheese for a less-sinful result. I also only used around 1/3 of the sugar suggested. Even with a small amount of confectioners sugar it was a great consistency. I used 87% cocoa swiss chocolate and also added a couple of squares of white vanilla chocolate instead of using condensed milk.

I changed the servings to 6 as I was frosting an 8 inch layer cake and it was to be swirled with the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting. I had a tonne left over so it was more than enough; I think there would have been plenty to frost the 8inch layer cake on it's own.

This was all used on the "Fudge Cake" recipe. It was so rich and delicious. It was perfect for a special occasion cake (in this case a birthday). I actually found the frosting quite tangy, but this might be because I didn't use condensed milk and I cut the sugar so much. I do like a good tangy frosting.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a chocolate lover, and I think it would probably actually work best on a non-chocolate cake in order to appreciate it fully.

THIS FROSTING HAD A GREAT CONSISTENCY AND SUPERB FLAVOR. ABOUT THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS I ADDED 2 TEASPOON OF INSTANT COFFEE TO THE MELTED CHOCOLATE TO INTENSIFY THE FLAVOR. IT WAS SUPER SWEET AND FLAVORFUL. NEXT TIME I MAY ADD MAYBE 3/4 CUP LESS SUGAR. I ALSO USED LOW FAT CREAM CHEESE AND IT STILL CAME OUT FABULOUS. THIS IS A KEEPER FOR ANY BAKER. KUDOS TO THE RECIPE CREATOR.

This recipe turned out great for me! The best part about it is that it's not too sweet. For those of you who are the type to scrape some of the frosting off your birthday cake. This is the recipe for you!

This frosting is out of this world yummy. My husband asked for some brownies with frosting and i found this recipe. I made half a batch and it was more than enough for a 9 x 13 pan even though he likes a lot of frosting. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

SO good!  It turned out thick and rich, almost like a fudge icing.  I used it to frost David's yellow cake, also from this site.  Beautiful combo.  I was short one square of chocolate, so I used 3 TBS. cocoa powder + 1 TBS. butter and melted it with the rest of the chocolate.  This recipe worked out very well in my Kitchenaid.  I made it for my little guy's 2nd birthday today, and he loved it too!

Loved this recipe!  The only substitution I made was heavy cream for the evaporated milk.  I only used the cream since I had some left in the fridge from another recipe and wanted to use it up.  Not sure if the cream made it taste different . . . but it was delicious.

I made this to top a Chocolate Mayonnaise Cake for a friend.  Everyone LOVED it, and mentioned that the frosting wasn't sickeningly sweet.
Now they all think I'm a gourmet baker!
Thanks for posting it!

This was not as good as I had hoped, it was just okay.  It was more of a dark chocolate flavor, a little bitter tasting.  If you are looking for a dark chocolate flavor, you will love this.  If you are looking for more of a fudge flavored frosting try the recipe Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting--it is amazing!

Loved this! My changes were: Whole milk in place of evaporated and 1TBSP more than called for; 1 tsp softened smart balance butter; 2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder to give it a deeper chocolate taste that helps detract from the powdered sugar flavor. I also think this icing is best when left refrigerated overnight so that the flavors have a chance to mingle, but this isn't absolutely necessary. Thanks for sharing!

Super tasty and has that cream cheese tang. I backed off by 1 cup of the powdered sugar at the suggestion of other reviewers. Also subbed half&half for evaporated milk. Turned out fine & dandy when paired with "One Bowl Chocolate Cake" from this site.

This worked out wonderfully.  I made several changes though.  I doubled everything but the sugar.  I only added 4 cups instead of 8 after doubling.  I also used semi sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened.  I completely left out the milk.  The consistancy was thick enough that I could spread and pipe decorations on top.  When I finished I put the whole cake in the refridgerator.  The icing became a rich "fudge" that encased the cake.  It tastes amazing.  Thank you!

Whoops! I started to make this frosting before I realized that I didn't have nearly enough icing sugar. I substituted sem-sweet chocolate squares instead of the unsweetened ones and only added about 1/2 cup of sugar and it turned out great. I love a flexible recipe! I also added a heaping teaspoon of instant coffee as it was going onto a Mocha Chocolate Cake. I also put a little frosting aside and added some fresh blended raspberries for a layer in the middle of the cake. Oh my! The final product got rave reviews. A new Valentine's tradition!

Did not like the consistency of this frosting and the taste was a bit off.. you could definitely taste the tangy-ness of the cream cheese and was a bit bitter so I had to keep adding sugar to make it sweeter.

My theory in life--cake was invented so we would have something to put frosting on!!  I absolutely love cream cheese frosting but never tried a chocolate version until this one.  Why, I don't know.  It can't get any better than this!!  I've made this twice so far, didn't have squares of chocolate the second time.  Used the substitution of 3 level T. cocoa to 1 T. oil and it worked fine.  Used neufchatel (less fat) cheese to lessen my guilt:-)  Also 1% milk.  Turned out SO good!!

I needed frosting for a box cake mix since I didn't have any on hand, and didn't really want to use the traditional whip cream version i have (which uses shortening - very messy and time consuming). This recipe seemed simple enough and I had a bar of cream cheese that needed used. Like another reviewer I added butter (about 4 tbspn). I needed enough for a layer cake, and I actually ended up with enough extra to frost a pan of brownies with. Used half and half, maybe more like 3-4 Tbsp - amount of liquid needed will depend on the amount of sugar used. Followed the directions otherwise, turned out great. This was a birthday cake and I used a piping bag for added decorations, had no trouble piping this, although you do need to work fast since the icing dries almost like a sugar cookie icing once it's applied. Delicious, this is a keeper for my baking box!

This recipe is so versatile. I used dark chocolate chips instead of unsweetened squares, mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese, and half and half instead of evaporated milk and it was fantastic. You control the stiffness with the amount of cream or evaporated milk you put in. I used this to frost my gluten-free king arthur chocolate cake mix and it was perfection. Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Richard!!!

Very good frosting! I didn't think it was bitter but then again I love chocolate. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it frosted a 9" 2 layer cake. Very good recipe, I'll keep this one for lots of cakes.

This frosting was really good and very spreadable. I used the 1/3 fat neufchatel cheese rather than full fat cream cheese which still worked out well and tasted rich and creamy.

This is a great recipe. Smooth & creamy. Tastes wonderful. Makes a pretty cake. The one thing I did differently was, I substituted the squares of choc. with 2/3 cups of semi sweet choc. morsels.

I love this stuff! I will never go back to store bought frosting again. I never have any cake left over when I use this recipe for parties. I do not use the full amount of confectioner's sugar, I just make it to taste and am always very happy with it. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I made this with bittersweet chocolate squares, because it was on hand. I used Neufachel (low fat) cream cheese.  The taste was great.  Don't use Neufachel, the frosting doesn't set up well.

Excellent in both taste and consistency.  I used only 3-1/2 cups of sugar which, to me, seemed to be perfect and didn't need to use the 2 tablespoons of milk.  Very easy to spread--holds its shape.

This recipe is wonderful!  I cut it in 1/2 and there was plenty to frost a 9X13 pan of brownies.  The taste of the frosting was excellent without being overwhelming.  The only change I made was I used heavy whipping cream as I had it on hand versus the evaporated milk.  I will never buy a can again.  It is very cost effective!

This tastes wonderful! I've made it a couple times now, and here are a couple things I've learned from my mistakes: (1) Don't add much milk to thin it -- just keep beating it with the mixer. (2) You can substitute orange liqueur instead of vanilla, and/or add pumpkin pie spice. (3) The pumpkin spice and orange liqueur mix added to frosting is really good over the Chocolate Pumpkin Cake recipe on this site. (4) It's hard to not lick your fingers with this recipe!

Love the cream cheese tang and it spreads beautifully. My only problem is that I ran out for my 3-layer 8-inch-round cake. Will use again and again and again.

I made this to go on a chocolate cake-- Dark Chocolate Cake I, I think, but I'm not sure-- and it was pretty good. I was looking for a more cream cheesier taste, as this was quite fudgey, but it wasn't a bad taste; just not exactly what I was looking for. Very rich and smooth. It just barely covered 3 layers, but the frosting and cake were soooo moist and chocolatey together there was no need for excesses of frosting (though I am fond of them). I would definitely make this again to frost a dark chocolate cake for a quasi death-by-chocolate experience. :)

Tasty frosting but consistency more like a glaze - wish I had stopped at 1 tablespoon of cream (or stayed with none) because it was too runny to hold a shape at the end.  I used a good chocolate and my frosting was very light.  Perhaps because I used 1 oz of chocolate, which with my bar was only 2 squares?  Used to top pumpkin bread III cupcakes from AR and the combo was fantastic.

While this frosting had an excellent consistency, the taste of the unsweetened chocolate was far too bitter for my family's tastes. I'm sure a dark chocolate lover would probably enjoy the chocolate "punch" this frosting provides, but it just wasn't for me. I would like to try it again with semi-sweet chocolate and I think it would be wonderful.

I used bittersweet chocolate chips, added orange flavoring, and stirred in some coca to make it thicker.  Good taste.  It needs more vanilla to soften the chocolate.

Sooo very good.  It is important however to make sure you do a slow, low temp melting of the chocolate...especially if you do it in the microwave.  The taste is wonderful...and I would venture to say, I would add even more chocolate!

Great starter recipe! I made it with dark chocolate for my dark chocolate monster of a boyfriend for a chocolate cookie cake. I wanted it thicker so I added more sugar and less milk. With 85% cocoa dark chocolate, the extra sugar definitely didn't make it too sweet (a little too bitter for my taste). The dark chocolate monster will love it!

This is very good for someone who likes a very sugary icing. Creamy and sugar and delicious. If you prefer something subtler, this isn't the recipe for you, though.

It was good!  It had a little bit of that chalky powdered sugar taste, but i threw in the dregs from my french press (the silt on the bottom of my cup of coffee, not the actual grounds) and that evened out the flavor nicely!

I made this frosting for some Devils food cupcakes. I had way too much left over but that's not a bad thing at all! It taste great, very smooth. I used half the sugar and added 1 1/2 Tbls sour cream, I also used lite cream cheese to cut down on the fat, cannot taste a difference.

I've made this recipe several times and loved it each and every time (even cut it in half).  As I do with every frosting recipe is always taste as I add the sugar because I often find Frostings too sweet for my liking (so I did not end up adding the full 4 cups).  I've also used the evaporated milk as the recipe calls for, half and half and just plain milk...good each and every time :). Easy to pipe onto cupcakes as well - Thanks for sharing!

OK, I forgot the evaporated milk at the end.  I put it in the frosting tube and found it on the counter.  Oops.  Even without that, it was very good and was able to squeeze through the frosting bag tips with ease.  I frosted 96 mini cupcakes and saved 3/4 cup remaining for use in the next couple of days.

I made this to frost my David's Yellow Cake. When I first tried it was a little uncertain if I liked it, but the more I tried it the more I liked it. My friend said it tasted like real frosting and not that junk in the tub off the shelf. We all thought it was really tasty! I will definitely make it again, super, super easy.

This frosting was a complete bust for me! It was incredibly thick and bitter and not very good at all.  I ended up doctoring it up with milk and even melting some milk chocolate into it, but it still wasn't very good.  I wouldn't recommend it.

This is an excellent recipe. Easy to follow and to do. My husband LOVED the frosting and he normally hates frosting. Rest of the family loved it as well!!

This is great!  My great aunt had a wonderful chocolate frosting that I loved and it was not sickenly sweet, like most are.  This recipe is the closest I've found to hers yet.  Loved it loved it!  I used milk because I didn't have evaporated milk or half & half on hand.  No problems and the kids loved it too.

I melted the chocolate in the microwave & used regular milk instead of evaporated. I halved the recipe (enough for a 9 x 13 cake) and didn't want to open a whole can for such a small amount of milk. Everyone loved this - thanks!

Fabulous!  I don't usually like to alter a recipe too much before I've tried it once, but since I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, I had to.  I only used half the sugar and doubled the chocolate using semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Turned out perfectly rich and chocolatey and I will use this all the time!  Thanks for the recipe!

Well this was just sinfully good!  I wonder if the reviewers who found this frosting bitter realized that there is supposed to be one tablespoon of vanilla in this recipe.  I almost bypassed that myself and would have tossed in the usual teaspoonful.  The only problem I encountered with this recipe was in the mixing.  However, I must admit that I didn't let the cream cheese come to full room temperature.  Also I don't have a stand mixer which would have helped as this is a very sturdy frosting!  Anyway, a couple more tablespoonfuls of evaporated milk took care of my problem.  Try this on one of the dark chocolate cake recipes from this site.  It's to die for!

I prepared this recipe for layering a cake and prepping it for fondant.  It has wonderful flavor, and after a long bit of sitting in between work of many layers and fondant preparations, I added just a bit more condensed milk and mixed again which turned out to be very helpful.  The only note I might add is to not get too worried about how dry and hard the frosting is before adding the milk.  I used my mixer and started to worry it wasn't going to turn out right  when the mixer started to struggle.  I might consider alternating between adding milk and powdered sugar to prevent this in the future.

Amazing.  I normally use another chocolate frosting recipe from this website, but, for her 12th bday, my daughter Jennah asked for chocolate cream cheese frosting for her cake, so the search began.  I ended up with this one.  I think it has a really gourmet cocoa flavor.  You don't taste the cream cheese a ton, but it is seriously luscious.  In fact, its my fave now, and everyone at the party agreed.  It does have a slightly bittersweet taste as someone mentioned, but I don't think that is a bad thing, I think it adds to the flavor.  I just subbed regular milk for the evap since I didn't want to open a can for 2 tbsp.  worked fine, nice and creamy and perfect. Thanks!

Exactly what I was looking for! I used this to ice strawberry cupcakes (Strawberry dream cake from this website) and it was perfect. This is NOT a super sweet icing. Though if you used semi-sweet choc rather than unsweetened chocolate it might be sweeter. I also used milk (skim milk b/c that's all i had) instead of the canned evaporated milk and it still turned out great.

Great frosting recipe, extremely easy to make. For those who don't like super sweet frosting, I would recommend tasting the mixture while added the confectioner's sugar at half cup intervals. I stopped at two cups, and still my colleagues (who all love sweets) found it just slightly on the sugary side. Like many others, I didn't have evaporated milk and just used full cream milk. Had no problems with the consistency even with the changes. Turned out great! Thanks!

very good...only problem i had was that the melted chocolate firmed up, making tiny chocolate chips (i didn't have time to let the cream cheese hit room temp, which i'm guessing caused this)...this actually turned out very yummy that way!  I'll just call it chocolate chip cream cheese frosting!  the "chips" were so small, they just added little bittersweet flavor and some texture.  This frosting was very yummy, and made a very good sized portion.  half of the recipe frosted the top of my 9X13 white cake.  Oh..and I only used 1 tablespoon of evaporated milk, I was happy with the perfect consistency at this point!

It tasted delicious on the Black Magic cake! However, it was too liquidy. I pretty much poured it all over the cake and after an hour a crust formed making it look more solid but underneath the crust it was still liquidy. I'm not sure if I messed something up, I did use 1/2 cup less sugar.

This frosting is TOO good! I made a Devil's Food Cake and used this to frost it, while I was making the cake my girlfriend made the frosting. Everyone assumed that the cake would overshadow the frosting and I would be named a fantastic baker. However, the frosting totally outshined the cake and I was left feeling inadequate...but full! :D One of my friends said that it was the MOST decadent cake she had ever had, and that's entirely thanks to this frosting, I don't think I've ever had anything quite like it!

This was an excellent addition to my flourless chocolate cake that I made over the holidays.  I will add a note that I had enough frosting to frost about 10 cakes, but the frosting would have been worth it!  For a holiday touch I substituted peppermint extract for the vanilla extract, it gave it a nice holiday touch, and something a little unexpected for the tastebuds!

This was awesome.  I used it to frost my mother-in-law's birthday cake and it was a huge hit.  My husband had to restrain me from eating it straight from the bowl.  It was pretty soft the night that I made it, but set well in the fridge overnight.  I wish it was a bit darker, mine was a very light brown... I may use a bit more chocolate next time.

Delectable and so easy to prepare.. beautiful consistency.  I added a tablespoon of butter to the chocolate before microwaving.   Other than that, didn't change a thing.   It's perfect as is.  I used this icing with the "Black Magic Cake."   Yummmm!!!!

Excellent!  I had to substitute the 4 oz of baker's chocolate for 12T/4T of cocoa powder and oil, respectively, but it worked fine as always.  Also, I used skim milk instead of the evaporated.  Even with these small changes, the recipe delivers on both ease and taste!  I won't ever buy another can of frosting again!

This is exactly what I was looking for! It makes a good amount so I had some left, but not for long. Beware: you'll want to eat any left right off of the spoon!

I made this recipe and it was perfect!  I did not have evaporate milk so I used some skim and I don't think it affected it at all.  This is a rich, creamy icing, which is my personal favorite.

I will never, ever use another frosting recipe ever again. This one is "it"!!! I melted 4 squares of white chocolate instead of dark, and did not have evaporated milk so I substituted heavy cream and it worked perfectly. It sets up well and does well holding up to decoration, but needs to be refrigerated. Thank you so much for the incredible, versatile recipe.

I was disappointed with this frosting.  I followed the recipe completely.  The flavor was average.  The consistency was thin.  I guess if I experimented with it, I could make better.  However, I don't think the base of the recipe was good enough to keep trying.  I will look for another recipe when I need a frosting again.

Everyone like this frosting except for me. I'm not much of a chocolate fan but I made this for my cousins birthday who of course loves chocolate. I didn't have the squares of chocolate so I substituted 3 Tbsp. cocoa powder plus 1 Tbsp.cooking oil or shortening for each 1 oz of chocolate needed(this is the formula Better Homes and Gardents gives).It actually worked very well and if it seems to thick just add more oil until the right consistency of melted chocolate. This recipe reminds me of Costcos chocolate cake if you've ever had that. Great recipe for CHOCOLATE LOVERS!

Delicious! Not too sweet, and very creamy! I love it how it is written, but I now add in a tablespoon and a half of butter and switch to half & half. This is one of the best frosting recipes I have found. Thanks

Only 4 stars since I altered the recipe to make it a mocha frosting by adding 1T of instant coffee to the chocolate and I also added heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk. Still wonderful in my dark choc cake as a filling.

On my tongue, I first tasted sweetness.  Then came the tang of cream cheese.  This was followed by a slight bitterness that is often characteristic of chocolate.  Complex flavor and very smooth.  Not your usual chocolate frosting.

this frosting was pretty good - i especially like that it is so versatile.  i had to substitute a lot of ingredients just based on what  i had available - unsweetened cocoa power and oil for the chocolate squares, whole milk for evaporated, and i only had about 6 ounces of cream cheese.  it still turned out rich, fluffy, and easy to spread.  yummy!

The recipe turned out and was very easy to prepare. I think a little less chocolate would be ok. It was a little bitter. I added about 1/4 cup of white sugar and it helped.

Just a comment. My unsweetened chocolate was 2 squares per ounce. Other reviews mentioned it was too bitter. I wonder if they add too much chocolate. mine was good. I did add only 3 cups sugar since we like things a little less sweet these days.

The perfect frosting for vegan chocolate cupcakes. Dense, rich and simple to whip up. I make it with just regular milk instead of evaporated, sometimes with heavy whipping cream. I've also made it with splenda for a lower sugar frosting. Reminds me  a lot of the dense frostings found on Sprinkles cupcakes - my favorite!

I used half the sugar, and non dairy creamer instead of evaporated milk - my mistake was not using that at room temp, but it actually made the chocolate into little "flakes" which made the frosting look amazing, almost like an oreo shake.  I used whipped cream cheese instead of the block.

Excellent!  I made the following changes; 3/4 cup of cocoa powder plus 1/4 cup vegetable oil for the unsweetened chocolate, added two T butter when I beat the cream cheese, reduced the confectioners sugar to 3 1/2 cups and used 2% milk in place of evaporated.  Even with all these changes, it was great!

The texture was very good.  My only issue is that the confectioners sugar overpowered the chocolate and cream cheese.  I first tasted it after 2 cups of confectioners sugar and it was great.  After adding the extra 2 cups, I soon regretted it.  Next time I'll add an extra square of chocolate or two and reduce the sugar by one cup and see what happens.

Too bitter with the unsweetened chocolate in my (and my families) opinion.  It was very easy and quick to make. Next time I'll go with with a German chocolate and hopefully cut down the bitterness.

I was a little hesitant to give this 4 stars, because I made 3 different frosting recipes at the same time for comparison and this was our least favorite of the bunch. I almost went with 3 stars, then changed my mind because I feel this has great merit for certain applications. I was looking for a chocolate frosting for a yellow cake and this one wouldn't be good for that, in my opinion. The texture, color and flavor didn't meet my criteria for a yellow cake. It was a bit frothy/airy, and I preferred a more "slick"/dense (but not shiny) texture. It was a bit tangy (because of the cream cheese, duh!), and I wanted more of a pure chocolate flavor. Lastly, the color was quite light, and for a yellow cake, I think a darker color looks best. If you look at the photos, there are several that show a light color and that is how mine came out. I also have a picture of it in my photos.  Now...if you are looking for a light, sweet frosting for a chocolate cake or cupcakes, or you are a cream cheese fan, then this would be a great option...thus, 4 stars.  I followed the recipe as written.  I used the following brands --- Chocolate: Baker's Unsweetened; Cream Cheese: Philadelphia; Butter: Lucerne salted(usually use Plugra unsalted for baking, but I was doing a test and didn't want to spend the $); Sugar: Imperial; Vanilla: Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Bean Paste.

I made this recipe and followed the ingredients to a certain point.  I used all but 2 squares of a Ghirardelli white chocolate baking 4 oz. bar and about 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also added 4 TBSP of unsalted butter as some reviewers suggested.  Then, when I got to the evaporated milk, we had none.  I decided to add some coffee and milk, so about 2 TBSP hot coffee, cooled down with an equal amount of milk.  This did affect the consistency, so I added some cocoa powder and powdered sugar til we thought the flavor and consistency was what we were pleased with.  It was fabulously delicious!  I think the point is that this recipe is easy, good, and can be played with and not affect the deliciousness or use of the frosting.  I frosted 24 large and 12 small chocolate cupcakes from the Chocolate Cake II recipe on this site.  They were all devoured at my husband's 50th birthday celebration yesterday.  :)

This a great recipe;  You can make it sweeter if you so desire by using semi sweet choco chips instead of all the dark chocolate.  I didn't, because sweet makes me gag.  It is so easy a child could do it. You also do not evap. milk as any milk will do just fine. Any decent cook could figure a lot of this out. Thanks richardwass

I found this frosting to be super sweet, a little gritty (yes I did use icing sugar) and it did not have a strong enough flavor of chocolate. Next time, I will cut the sugar, add coco powder and a little butter to tweak it.

I tweaked this a bit.  Had a box of Wilbur semisweet and milk chocolates (kind of like hersey kisses) so I melted a full cup of those with 2 tablespoons of butter and added that to the whipped cream cheese.  I only added a cup of powdered sugar since I didn't need the sweetness.  No milk, since I had the butter.  It was very good, creamy and spread easily.

Ummm.... It didn't really turn out as good as I thought it would... It was impossible to spread on to the cake that I made!! When I looked at the picture I thought it would by a little more liquidy and easy to spread on to a cake but noopee!! And the taste wasn't that special.

I used semi-sweet chocolate, a little butter and half'n'half (as it was what I had on hand).  The frosting was "gorgeous" as my English husband said! Very rich, sweet and topped the chocolate cake in a lovely way!

This was quick easy to make.  Also very creamy and easy to spread.  I did not have the unsweetened chocolate squares and used Dark Chocolate chips instead.  I also doubled the amount of chocolate because it needed more chocolate in my opinion. I will definately use this recipe again

I am currently in Chile, and realized that there is no cocoa powder here... So while making a chocolate cake for my family, I decided to make this. It turned out wonderfully. I did not add the milk as I felt it wasn't needed. I also did not measure anything (as measurements also do not exist here) but I think I used a bit less powdered sugar. It had a wonderful flavor and I ate the leftovers with strawberries :) It made a great Halloween cake!

Realized I was out of butter when I went to make a frosting for my son's birthday cake.  Couldn't get to the store so I made this frosting.  It reminded me of chocolate cheesecake.  I liked it, but I prefer regular chocolate frosting on cake.  It was interesting, however.

I made half a recipe for this to frost one dozen cupcakes (there was a bit of frosting leftover).  Also, I omitted the chocolate to have vanilla frosting.  Good and easy, and without all the preservatives and weird ingredients that are in store-bought frosting.  Since I only needed 1 TB of evaporated milk, I froze the rest of the milk (it lasts for up to 2 months).

I really liked this.  Although I did make changes.  I added butter and left out the chocolate.  Only because I didn't have any.  So I made a white iciing.  I also used regular milk instead.  It turned out really good.  Will def use again!! thx.

I used milk chocolate chips and this was delicious! It took a little while for the frosting to set, so just be sure to leave yourself a little time between frosting and serving.

Very good! I found myself out of butter (!) so I was glad to have found this recipe. Perfect balance of cream cheese / sweet chocolate taste. I used all 4 cups of powdered sugar and the recipe made plenty of icing to frost & fill a 9 inch 2 layer cake.

This is the best chocolate frosting!  My husband, who HATES cream cheese,  said it was the best he has ever had.   I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will probably not add quite as much milk.

Loved it!! Great flavour.  I did add 3 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa, and used less sugar.

SUPER GOOD!!! So rich, but not too sweet. After refrigerating the remainder, it got almost fudgy!! So... there's a though if you have excess frosting!

Easy to make. Tastes like fudge. For me it was just too much, too rich and too overpowering even on a chocolate cake.

Pretty good. I think I should have mixed it on high a little longer because mine was a tad grainy. Not quite as smooth as I thought it should have been. Also, followed the recipe exactly and mine wasn't as dark a chocolate color as the picture shows. Better than store bought but may try another recipe next time.

This icing was so yummy.  I had only 85% chocolate so I added some cocoa and 2 tbsp of butter to the icing. I also left out the salt. It came out creamy and every one loved it.

Super tasty!  Nice and rich and full!
I followed people's advice and used a little less sugar (more like 4 1/2 cups)

I paired this frosting with the luscious lemon cake.  It was very good, however, very sweet.  I didn't even use the required amount of sugar.  I liked each item separately, I don't think I'll pair them together again.  This frosting would be very good on perhaps a butterscotch cake or maybe even cheesecake brownies.

This is okay, I guess I like sweet frostings because this was too bitter for me. I added more powder sugar and milk to get it to the flavor that my husband and I enjoy. I am not a fan of dark chocolate but am crazy over milk chocolate, so maybe this is why I wanted it sweeter.

This is good frosting recipe to start off on but needs tweeking.  It definitely needs more chocolate.  I would almost double the chocolate because the cream cheese and the sugar dominate the flavor.  Others have suggested reducing the sugar amount and even adding some coffee.  If you are a true chocolate afficcianado you are definetly going to want to make some changes.

Really good except I used whipping cream instead of condenced milk. Also, I didn't measure the sugar, but I'm pretty sure I didn't use as much as the recipe called for. I just added as much as I thought would be good, and it was!

This just didn't do it for me.  I think it was too tangy.  I prefer either a chocolate frosting, or a cream cheese frosting, but not a combination - it seemed like it cancelled each other out.  I kinda feel like I wasted my cream cheese!  Sorry.

Way too sweet - I didn't use half the sugar and it was still very sweet.
