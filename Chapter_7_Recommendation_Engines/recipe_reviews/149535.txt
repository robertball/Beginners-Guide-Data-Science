"Yummy" - classic comfort food at it's best! I did add a bit of butter and cracked black pepper, but other than that I didn't change a thing. These were creamy and delicious. A perfect side dish for just about anything!

I used four cloves of garlic--we REALLY like garlic. I also cut back on the milk just a little and added some cubed butter and a little fresh ground pepper. Yummy. Went really well with homemade barbeque meatballs.

These were ridiculously easy! While my potatoes were draining I warmed a little melted butter and milk in the pan before returning the potatoes. Can't go wrong!

These were so quick and delicious! I, too, added sour cream to them and served with steamed shrimp. Getting ready to make them again right now!

These potatoes were so good!  I cut back on the milk a little and added sour cream and butter, and used dried parsley flakes instead of fresh but the potatoes were still very flavorful.  Perfection, and I will definitely make again.

Very good! Like the others I added butter. These were a nice change to regular mashed potatoes. Thanks!

I scaled this recipe back to 2 servings and prepared this recipe as written to get a healthy potato side dish.  The only deviation from the recipe was using two small cloves of garlic which really boosted the flavor.  Unlike other reviewers, I added NO butter because I didn't want to alter the nutritional breakdown by adding more fat.  Honestly, I  didn't think it needed butter.  Try this one time as written, and I don't think you'll be disappointed...at least we weren't.  For anybody on the Weight Watchers Plus program, this calculates to 2 points.

I cut the recipe in half and speeded things up by putting the potatoes in the microwave. I put the salt, parsley (not fresh), added pepper and a tablespoon of butter in the milk. Stirred that and then added it to the mashed potatoes. Had to play around with the ingredient amounts but we did like it.

Great I love it, pretty quick and simple. I was just making it for myself by now. I didn't add parsley since it's hard to get in my area but i added more milk on it. Thanks for the quick cook recipe.

Great mashed potatoes!! I use dried parsley and I do add more garlic because more garlic is always good. :)

This recipe is good. I liked it. Unfortunately, my family did not. I used half a tablespoon of butter to mildly sautéing the garlic. I added spring onions in lieu of the parsley. Then, followed the recipe to a T. Sad I will not be able to make it again.

We used those "little potatoes" and left the skin on. Followed everything else and it tasted great.

This was a yummy side dish with BBQ Steak Recipe (also from this website). It was a bit bland and went wonderfully with the flavourful steak. I used 1/3 cup cream and some butter. Added just enough milk to make the texture smooth.

Easy to make! will definitely make more. Though next time, I'm planning on using more garlic to add in some flavour.

To make this even better, I add a few more cloves of garlic , some chopped dill and then whip the potatoes with your hand mixer.  Incredible!
