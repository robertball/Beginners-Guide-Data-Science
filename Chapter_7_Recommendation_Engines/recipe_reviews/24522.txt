This recipe is great the way it is but here is a quicker version of this recipe.
Use 2 packages of cresant rolls instead of the frozen bread.  You don't have to wait for it to thaw, you just put one can cresant rolls on the bottom of 9x13 pan and do the layers as stated in the recipe and put the other can of cresant rolls over the top.  Adjust baking time accordingly.

This is a great recipe that I have made for years, and is particularly a favorite when I take to Sunday school breakfast-- with one major change.  I always mince and saute one whole onion in butter before adding to sausage mixture.  I also use Cheddar cheese or a Colby-Jack mix, which keeps it from tasting so much like pizza.  Be sure and use the defrosted whole bread loaves, too.  Crescents will not give it the same flavor.

Very simple and a huge hit! I made it for my future father-in-law and he told my future mother-in-law that she had to add this to her rotation. (She didn't seem too impressed with that! ha ha ha.) I made it as written first, but I prefer it with a 14.5 oz can of Italian diced tomatoes. It seems like a giant pizza pocket. A definite keeper.

A man-pleasing favorite at my house.  I did modify a couple of things - I switched the cheese to a combination of monterey jack and sharp cheddar, and I rolled the bread like a jelly roll.  It turns out perfect every time!

I adjusted this recipe and have used it at ALL gatherings...by request...family & friends expect it...HOWEVER, I always use rolled out crescent rolls dough...flour a surface and roll thin...substituted FRESH chopped onions and FRESH mushrooms as well as not so rubbery cheese...I used either a combo of swiss and mild cheddar OR parm....roll up like a jelley roll and brush top with egg white...THIS IS A SLAM DUNK!!!  May be frozen after partially baking and ready to go at a moments notice.....TRY this alteration !!!One lb. of sausage(spicy) and a pkg of crescent rolls make at least 4 nice size sausage rolls...great for buffet breakfast OR appetizers with cocktails.

Made this last night and baked it this morning for breakfast.  It's only the two of us, so I halved the recipe, and it's still a lot!  I liked it, but there is a lot of sausage for this roll.  I would prefer some more veggies, and chopped tomatoes might be good in this too.  I used homemade crescent roll dough.  I should have seasoned my sausage a little--it's from bf's parents farm and they don't season their sausage.  Some fennel, garlic, and onion powder would have been sufficient to jazz it up a bit.

I cannot find the white bread dough in my country(Italy) so I use a standard refrigerated round of puff pastry instead.  This is very good as written but my favorite is the option mentioned up top with the pizza sauce (I sparingly use VERY thickened tomato sauce with salt and garlic, otherwise the liquid pools at the bottom and the bread becomes soupy and doesn't cook properly).  This recipe usually feeds us twice and so I freeze one half the mixture for a later date.  It is excellent!

I think this recipe is excellent!  I have made the breakfast and also the more pizza type/lunch version.  I use lean meat, less cheese and often add in more veggies.  You wouldn't want to eat it for breakfast everyday - but it is wonderful for a special occasion!

Taste was very good. I was hoping that it would stay together better so that I could serve as 'finger food', but this is better with plate and fork.

Excellent breakfast and anytime roll!  Used rosemary and herb seasoning that I had instead of the 4 herbs (little over a Tbls) and it was perfect.  Can't wait to try the "pizza/italian" way :)

To keep this as a breakfast meal, I didn't use Italian sausage/tomato/pizza sauce, etc.  Used crescent rolls; cooked the pork sausage; saut√©ed the green pepper with some finely chopped onion; added the mushrooms and topped the filling with cheddar cheese.  Also, I did add 6 eggs (scrambled) to the filling.  Made a really good meal with some fresh fruit.

I substituted a french loaf of bread....hallowed it out a little and then stuffed the bread with the ingredients.  You can vary the ingredients to suit your tastes.  After stuffing both sides of bread, put back together and bake in tin foil for 20 minutes at 325.  Gets crispy and the cheese is melted.  You can also "dip" this sandwich in a  hot broth for added flavor.   Great recipe...thanks

Sausage bread has been a Christmas tradition in our home for the last 25 years...the only thing I do differently is use onion instead of bell pepper, 1 lb hamburger, 1 lb sausage, 2 different kinds of my favorite cheeses & sliced black olives.  Crescent rolls will not taste the same as bread dough.  If you can't find frozen bread dough you can use hot roll mix or if you have a favorite yeast bread recipe use it.  Pizza sauce makes it to wet & messy. But you could use it for dipping, my son pours buttermilk ranch dressing over his.  But whichever way you fix this, its all good, after all its sausage bread.

Excxcellent, Eespecially enjoyed the  Italian twist. On another note, why can't people stick to the subject and offer good objective critiques instead of lecturing and preaching about daily salt intake, calories, portion control, yada , yada yada.

I have made this for years as a dinner item.  It is best made with a roll of pizza dough which you can get at any real pizzaria or in the frozen section of some supermarkets in the northeast.  Roll pizza dough into a rectangle   Also add sauted onions for a bit more flavor.  Combine cooked Italian sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms and mozzarella and spices and toss with 2 lightly beaten large eggs.  The eggs help to hold the filling together(there is no eggy taste) up jelly roll style,pinch ends and bake till golden and it sounds hollow when thumped.   It may seem like it is too hard when first out of the oven, but it softens right up.  Serve in slices as is or with marinara sauce for dipping.  I have also made this with chicken and cheddar.  Delicious!

I made this for breakfast yesterday. I sauteed green peppers, onion, mushrooms, garlic and fresh roasted green chiles. I then scrambled eggs. I layered the eggs, veggies and cheese. I also made my own bread. Very good! If I were to make as directed, I would add pizza sauce, as other reviewers suggested. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I have been making a different version for many, many years. One loaf of dough and shaped into a wreath at Xmas. Or, fill with canned apples and cinnamon. Very versatile.

It's been awhile since I made this; I just realized I never reviewed it.  I used home-made whole wheat bread dough instead of frozen and added chopped onion and celery.  I also used fresh mushrooms because we don't care for canned.  I hesitate to confess this, but I also added a couple of squirts of ketchup to the sausage mixture.  I really like ketchup with sausage, it's one of my guilty pleasures.  The roll came out great and we ate it for breakfast several days in a row (there are just two of us).  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, but as I thought it would be, there's way too much bread. Especially for us. I made this as written except for the egg wash. I'm not one to put egg wash on crusts, etc so I chose not to here as well.  We did enjoy it , though. Leftovers reheated nicely in the nuker, and we had/still have leftovers from a couple days ago.

I can't believe how good this was!  I don't care for spicy so I just used 2lbs of mild sausage.  My family loved it and it looked so pretty when it came out of the oven.  I'm already thinking of other fillings....chicken, broccoli and cheddar cheese?  Ham and swiss??  The possibilities are endless!

My family loved this!  I halved the recipe for the 3 of us and we still had some left.  I used 1 lb. sausage.  I added celery, which I sauteed first and added to the previously cooked sausage.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and finely chopped red pepper before adding to the sausage mixture.  I made it jellyroll style and it was good, but I may make calzone style next time.  We had it for dinner but it would be great for any meal.

I haven't made this yet........ but sounds very good as is. I personally think the bread dough sounds better than the crescent rolls.

I have made this for years, usually for special occasions, bc it does make quite a lot.  Everyone LOVES it and it is a frequent request from my guests.  I follow the recipe as written except for maybe a few extra veggies. I agree it may not be the healthiest recipe on this site but it is easily adaptable to lower fat versions.

I tried this but made it with Italian sausage, peppers, pepperoni, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese. It came out great but might try the crescent rolls the next time. It took a lot of time to roll out the dough and get it shaped.
