I love this recipe! I've made it several times and I've made these adjustments...First, I crisp the bacon and drain it, so the dish isn't so greasy, then I cut the sugar WAY back to 1/4 of a cup. In a pinch, I used an apple instead of a tomato and it was PERFECT. For a full meal, I also chop up sausage and mix in with the kraut/apple mixture. Just awesome!

I substituted the bacon with 1 lb of Poska Kielbasa cut into bite size, browned and drained.  I also cut the pepper back to 1/2 a tablespoon and will use a little less next time - a bit too hot for my taste.  It is a wonderful change to the usual sausage and kraut!

We had this tonight with our meal and loved it! I only changed the pepper amount. I just sprinkled a little bit and stirred it in, the hubby is sensitive to it!

Very different and excellent. We doubled the recipe and loved it! Recommend cutting down on the pepper (about half would do).Will make believers out of people who don't even like sauerkraut.

This was fabulous!  My husband, who claimed to not like sauerkraut, loved it.  I did not rinse the sauerkraut and cut down on the sugar.

I am in shock! My 3 year old tried this and asked for more!! He is the world's pickiest eater other than my 6 year old who did not like it--but that means NOTHING! LOL!  I loved this--did rinse and drain the sauerkraut, cut back on the pepper and used real bacon bits and petite diced canned tomatoes ( I am lazy!)--this was AWESOME!! I loved it and will make again soon--will cut back on sugar next time just to reduce calories but it was great and I enjoyed it sweet! I am German and this is the real deal!!! :)  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I often take this when we're invited to friends for a barbque. The Slowcooker Sauerkraut and Sausage recipe on this site is another favorite.

This was fantastic! I also reduced the amount of pepper to about 1 1/2 teaspoons, and rinsed and drained the sauerkraut before using it. I made this for an "Oktoberfest" luncheon we had at work. I made two pans, one with the tomatoes and one with a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce because that is what I had in the kitchen. I am glad I made two because all of it was gone at the end of the hour. People liked both types and I have had to give the recipe to numerous people and still have people asking me for it. Great recipe, will definitely be making again. Thanks!

I tried this recipe and loved the flavor, however think it would be greatly improved by reducing the amount of pepper in it.  Could 1 tablespoon be correct?  Seems like 1 teaspoon should be more like it.

I loved this recipe, except for one thing. The sugar was way to much. I cut it in half and it was perfect. if not for that it would be five stars.

This was very good. I wasn't sure how the tomato would be, the flavors blended nicely. 
Instead of doing this in the oven I threw a center cut pork loin roast in the bottom of my slow cooker & threw the sauerkraut mixture on top and let it cook all day. 
I drained/rinsed the kraut, I used brown sugar instead of white and cut back some on the amount. The bacon just kind of cooks into the sauerkraut and pretty much disappeared. I also cut way back on the pepper. I will make again.

This was OK.  I used kielbasa browned and drained instead of bacon.  I enjoyed the sweet/sour flavor.

This was a good recipe but a little too sweet even for me. I love sweet and savory dishes- so next time I will at least half the sugar if not more. I can't eat tomatoes so I left them out and added chopped onion and polska kielbasa. Other than being a little too sweet- it cooked well and there was not a hint of bitterness to the kraut. I'll make it again for an easy dinner.

This casserole was a New Year's Day hit with our family After reading all the pepper cautions, I opted for a 1/2 tsp and this was perfect.  I also did 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar which was also perfect.  Used diced tomatoes and packaged read bacon bits for convenience. My husband put the leftovers on a hot dog the next day and loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe to use on New Year's Day meals.

I've been making this recipe for years.  The only difference is it calls for a 14 oz. CAN of diced tomatoes, undrained.  I do slightly drain the kraut - otherwise it's too wet.  It's fantastic with thick sliced applewood smoked bacon.  I mix in about half of the bacon & use the rest to layer on top, which results in a nicely crisped top.  Baking in a large, shallow, uncovered casserole is important to get the correct texture.  It comes out salty/sweet/sour & silky from the bacon fat.  I have never cut back the sugar because the dish is not supposed to be "sour".  I love the sweetness!  My hubby will eat this even though he won't go near regular kraut.  It is a perfect accompaniment to a salty ham or any pork dish.  It goes well with southern dishes like black-eyed peas, greens, cornbread, etc.  I make it every year for New Year's dinner.  It's always well received by guests, even those who claim to not like sauerkraut!

I was certain I'd like this recipe, since I (and my family) love sauerkraut. It sounded somewhat like the Kielbasa, sauerkraut and apples I make so I thought I'd give it a shot. But this was just sort-of gross -- greasy and oddly both too sweet and too tart at the same time. I've always found the secret to cooking with sauerkraut is draining and rinsing it before cooking, but I didn't do that this time because the recipe didn't call for it. Maybe it would have turned out better if I had. Maybe not. It probably still would have been far too sweet. The next day I doused it with chicken stock and made soup out of it and we were able to finish it off. I won't be making this again.

I finally found a way to tolerate saurkraut.  I did what the other reviewer mentioned about adding kielbasi. It is sweet but I liked it b/c the whole reason I don't like saurkraut is the bitterness. My three guests enjoyed it and took some home. Do not use the whole teaspoon of pepper. Perhaps a half would be better.

Pretty good.  It was very sweet, which my husband liked but I liked less so.  Unfortunately even all the sugar didn't get my kids to like it.  I cut the pepper down to 1 teaspoon and it was still peppery.

Made this with the following options. Apples and sweet onions instead of tomatoes (this time). Omitted the bacon and roasting mild Italian sausages (Nextdoor) raised to Drain Grease. Will add to kraut after baking both for an Hour. Ground sufficient black pepper over kraut along with a dusting of sugar (2 tablespoons.

I will likely make it again.  When I do, I will reduce the pepper to 1 teaspoon (I used 1/2 tablespoon this time) and reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup or less (I used about 1/2 cup this time).

I made 1/2 recipe as a test.  This recipe is yummy.  My only change was to cut back on the pepper as my spouse will add his own pepper, anyway.  As I ate my test batch, I imagined serving this on a plate topped with grilled bratwurst or slices of roast port loin.  I will definitely make this dish again and again.

Tasty with spicy sausages off the grill!  I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and I think it was just right. Didn't completely mask the sour in the sauerkraut, but gave it a new flavor for sure. I fried the bacon first, but I think I would use a couple of pieces more next time,.  We liked it. Easy and something different.

I had my doubts about this recipe, but the reviews were good, and I did make a few minor adjustments.  I cut the sugar to less than half because I used really sweet fresh tomatoes, and reduced the amount of pepper, as well, knowing that if more were needed, it could be added at the table.  I scaled this down to 4 servings, and this was done at 2 hours, so watch your time and check often, as you certainly don’t want this to dry out.  That mild sweetness and the flavor that the bacon brings to this casserole is simply delicious.  Served this with grilled brats which I added toward the end of the casserole cooking.  If you’re a sauerkraut lover, you really should give this a try.  Thumbs up in this house!

This is my favorite go-to recipe for potlucks! Everyone loves it and there are never leftovers to bring home. Just as a matter of taste, i use about 1/2 the sugar. If there are going to be kids, i cut back on the pepper too. I love this recipe!

This didn't turn out very good for me.  I followed exactly, except I cooked the bacon first as I wasn't sure if it should be or not.  It turned out quite dry.  Maybe the uncooked bacon would have added some fat to the dish.  I'd try again.

I like my sauerkraut sour and this made it sweet. It just wasn't for me but my husband who is Dutch and grew up with sauerkraut in all kinds of ways loved it so I guess it's up to the individual.

Terrible - to strong on the pepper and I put less than the ingredients

This was great!! I was looking for a sauerkraut recipe for New Year's and will definitely be making this again. I did like some of the other reviewers did and used real bacon bits ( I think it may save some calories)and reduced the black pepper. I used Splenda instead of sugar and reduced the calories considerably. The taste was fantastic. I did drain the kraut as some of the others had suggested but may leave a little bit in the next time. My husband commented that it looked a little different when I was serving it(because of the tomatoes) but was wowed when he tasted it!!!

This was good with a few adjustments.  Per other reviews I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup.  Will cut it to 1/4th next time.  I also added left over pork roast.  Meat was wonderfully tender and flavorful.  Did enjoy the casserole...but it was still a little to sweet with the 1/3 cup sugar.

very interesting flavor -- very tasty!  Unfortunately, mine turned out a bit greasy, which is the only reason for the 4-star.

I doubled this recipe and cut the pepper and sugar in half like the other reviews said.  I sitll couldn't get past the fact that it was sauerkraut (I'm not a fan), but everyone else said it was great and my husband said to try cutting the sugar back even further - he prefers sour to sweet.

This was an extremely easy recipe to make AND my family enjoyed eating it.
We ate it as amiddle-of-the-week main dish with potatoes.

I used bacon blocks instead of bacon strips and cut down on the amount of sugar (when I was measuring it out, I was shocked at the amount I'd be putting into the food). Even using 1/3 the amount of sugar recommended, the caramalization was just as it should be.

This is a very tasty and interesting dish.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and a can of stewed tomatoes.  I drained the kraut and tomatoes also.  It turned out great!  This is perfect with grilled metwurst and beans.

Because I didn't have tomatoes, I used a 14oz. can of tomato sauce. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup (next time I'll try 2/3) as it was still very sweet. Used crisp bacon leftover from breakfast and cut the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. It was still peppery. Even after all these changes it was still good and it carmelized after the two hours. We liked it and would make again. Thank you for the recipe.
