Yummy Yummy.  What a pleasent taste and so very moist.  I've made this so many times and it's a keeper.

Hints:  I always use 3 good sized banana's, which is a lot more than what the recipe calls for.  I use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, and I ommit (usually) the pecans.  Takes a little longer to cook with the extra banana's, but it's worth the wait.

Thanks Pam Hall

This IS a very creamy bread, but i think it lacks flavor. I made it for the first time today, in a large rectangular cake pan, and it took only 30 minutes. I added 1TB vanilla because usually like more than recipes call for. It turned out great, except next time I will add some spices to the mix, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice. I will also mix up a small dish of cinnamon and sugar with melted butter and spread on the top of the bread. It was good, but it needs a little kick. Adding a little more banana couldnt hurt either.

Moist and creamy! But, I guess that's no surprise with banana bread. I've never made banana bread with cream cheese before so this was a nice change plus it was a nice way to use up the last of it along with some really ripe bananas. I cut the recipe in half and added a tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and kept the vanilla at 1 tsp. I also mashed 3 ripe bananas so that was definitely more than 1/2 cup! I subbed walnuts for the pecans as that's what I had on hand. I used one egg and added a couple of tbsp. of veg. oil. I baked in a 9x5 glass baking dish and it took an hour. I love the nice nut/sugar mixture in the middle when you cut into the bread - delish!

I used 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of margarine, used an 8 ounce package of fat free cream cheese, mashed 3 bananas, used 1/2 cup of applesauce with 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in instead of 2 eggs. I also omitted the pecan mixture, and instead chopped up 1/2 cup of walnuts, and threw them in the banana bread mixture.

This was very good.  I left out the nuts and mixed in the cinnamon and brown sugar.  However next time I'll cut the cinnamon in half and add an extra banana.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've found.  The cream cheese makes the texture wonderful.  Plus, the bread freezes really well.  So, with the two loaves, I put one in the freezer and leave another out for the family.

This came out great!  I liked that it was more "moist and fluffy" versus "heavy and dense".  I like my breads nice and sweet.  If you do to, here is what I changed to make it perfect:  For the bread I dropped the white sugar to 3/4 cups and added 1/2 cups brown sugar.  
To the filling: I doubled the amounts and used 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/8 c. white sugar, 1 1/4 c. finely chopped pecans, 4 tsp. cinnamon, and 3 T BUTTER.  I used a pastry cutter to mix it until coarse and crumbly.  I sprinkled a little around the greased pan.  Then I put 1/2 in the middle of the batter and 1/2 on the top of the loaf.  It came out sooooo delicious!  More like banana coffee cake...  but oh, so good!  I brought it to a party and it disappeared instantly!  This has become my permanent recipe!

I wasn't particularly impressed with this recipe.  I found the batter to be somewhat thick, and the bread wasn't as moist as I thought it would be with the addition of the cream cheese. I also added 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon to the batter, instead of all of it in the crumb filling. My favorite recipe is still the Banana Sour Cream Bread found on this website.

I don't care for nuts so I skipped that part of the recipe, instead I added the cinnamon to the batter and I added my own little twist and added some oranged rind to the batter also.  Will make time and time again, it's so easy.

I really loved the cream flavor in this bread.  I did do a few adjustments however.  I really love bananas and knew that 1 cup of mashed bananas would not be enough flavor so here is what I did:  I added 2 cups mashed bananas, 3 eggs, 2 3/4 cups flour, 3/4 tsp baking soda and 2 tsp baking powder and I added 1 tsp of salt.  Everything else remained the same.  It came out with so much banana flavor and creaminess!  It was delicious!

I have been searching for a new banana bread recipe. The one I have been using for years was never moist enough. I stumbled upon this one and tried it because of the cream cheese. I am SO glad I did!
I love the texture- very smooth, but there's some bulk to it which I like. I like the crunchy topping and am going to try something with oatmeal in the topping the next time.
One note- when pouring the batter in, make sure to fill the pans 1/2 full. They will cook more evenly and the loaf will be done in the middle.
I also recommend "dropping" the loaf pan to settle the batter.
My family just loves this recipe- we never have to freeze the second loaf- it is gone the next day!

Excellent 'Nana Bread!  My two cents- always add extra banana to what is called for. A MUST to double the 'filling' and extra cinnamon in it , real BUTTER a must for me, reduced sugar in 'bread" by 1/2 cup - half brown sugar/half white sugar.  Dust greased pan with cinnamon/sugar mix.....everyone loves it!!!

Have made this recipe twice so far.  Both times, I have used almost 2 cups of bananas and 2 t vanilla.  The first time I did the layering with the cinnamon/brown sugar and pecans.  I had no problems with it holding together.  I thought as another said, that it would taste better with the cinnamon mixed in, so that is what I did the second time.  The second time I also sprinkled brown sugar around the bundt pan before putting the batter in and left out the nuts.  I prefered the second way.

This bread is so delicious! The only ingredient I changed is I used Turbinado sugar instead of white sugar (personal preference). The only step I changed was to add the pecan mixture to the batter and stir it in, didn't feel like making the ribbon. Wonderful recipe! Thank you :)

The texture is more "cakelike" than
a banana bread, but very moist and
light and tasty. I didn't use the pecans
or brown sugar, but it was great. I made
it into 24 cupcakes for my son's baseball team and they enjoyed them.
Will definitely keep this in my recipe file. ** lynn **

Good flavor, but very crumbly.  The pieces fell apart when I attempted to cut the bread.  I won't make this one again.

I make this bread a lot, but I don't follow the recipe exactly.  I use sour cream instead of cream cheese, I don't use nuts, and the sugar/cinnamon filling I put on the top instead of in the middle so that there's a sugary crust (plus it makes the house smell amazing while it's cooking!) :)

Amazing!  This really smells fabulous, a wonderful banana aroma that drew my family in.  The one recipe made two large loaves for me, much to my family's delight!  This was delicious, easy, clear and concise directions.  I highly recommend it and will be making it again soon.

Great banana bread, especially liked the swirl in the middle.  I did make a few changes:  Added some nutmeg to the batter, and doubled the cinnamon swirl mixture. Used 2 large bananas because that what I had.  Yummy!!!

I have made this three times in two weeks because my family cannot get enough of it! I skip the pecan layer due to dietary restrictions, and really don't think it needs it, anyway. The cream cheese makes it so deliciously moist, and we love it right out of the oven with a little butter. We even sliced it and made it into french toast topped with sliced, fresh bananas. Sooo good!

This came out moist and delicious and wonderful!!!  Thank you!  I left out the nuts because of personal preference.  Very enjoyable.  (Just a note: if you're looking for something with a cream cheese undertone, you can't really taste the cream cheese)

This is a very nice banana bread. Since some reviewers complained of blandness, I added 1/2 tsp. salt and 2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter. I also used closer to 1 1/2 cups banana. Even with the extra banana, it wasn't as moist as I was expecting. I really liked the cinnamon pecan swirl though, which partly made up for what the rest of the bread was lacking.

Made this last night to use up some frozen bananas and a block of cream cheese I had left over from Christmas baking. I changed it up a bit according to my family's personal taste:  decreased the sugar amount w/in the bread to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown and doubled the filling amount. My first time mixing cream cheese w/banana bread and it was great! So moist and flavorful. This recipe is the perfect amount for one 9 x 5 loaf pan and it baked up in 45 mins. As mentioned in previous reviews, you can make "flavor" changes by adding crushed pineapple or chocolate chips. Thank you for a deliciously different banana bread!

I knew  soon as I added the sugar and eggs that this was going to be a good one. It looked so yummy! It smelled great baking and tasted perfect! I only have one bread pan so I made muffins too. Can't wait to eat these and make more!

Loved this recipe! I used a bundt pan though. I sprinkled the sugar mixture to dust the bottom of the pan then sprinkled chocolate chips around it. I poured half the batter then more sugar/chocolate chips and topped it off with the remaining batter. Just a different presentation but same wonderful taste!

This is an excellent banana bread just as written.   This time I took a hint from TV Chef, Giada, and added 2 T balsamic vinegar to batter. She makes a EVOO muffin with balsamic vinegar which I've enjoyed many times.  So, whyt not try BV in BB???   The addition gives an amazing dimension to banana bread.

So, I am an avid baker.  I always keep frozen bananas in my freezer, 3 to 4 of them per plastic bad, with the air sucked out (I use the ones that are hand held from the grocery with their bags) because my family loves banana bread. This recipe will be all I use from now on.  Everyone in my family and extended family loves it!  I use a 9x13 pyrex, bake at 25 to 30 minutes because it is easier to serve to my large family.  My search for the perfect banana bread is over!  I do add about 1/2 t. of sea salt to the batter for flavor intensity.  Also, a tip for everyone is that most groceries sell overripe bananas really cheap.  I buy two to three large packs and freeze them immediately.  Ususally doesn't cost more than $3 for several pounds of bananas.

This bread is super yummy!  I had two bananas on hand that I needed to use up so I tried this bread today.  The two bananas were a about 1/4 cup shy of the 1 cup bananas that it calls for so I added 1/4 cup vegetable oil to make sure that it would still be moist enough.  I also had whipped cream cheese on hand instead of regular and it worked fine.  Just for fun I tossed in some chocolate chips!  The bread came out GREAT!  I am trying to stop eating it so that there will be some left for my husband when he gets home!

Ok I thought I had the best banana bread recipe ever, but I have been beat.  This is awesome!!  It's moist and flavorable and not too sweet.  Dessert tonight is a slice dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup and whipped cream.  It will make us think of the funnel cakes from the fair while we are staring at 7 inches of snow.

Although this came "okay" with a few adjustments (added milk to batter as it seemed dry, more banana and vanilla) I wouldn't call this banana bread creamy. Even with adding the extra liquid it was dry (I tested for doneness several times, so I didn't overbake it.) I 
like the pecan/sugar/cinnamon layer, I added about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to it. I might make this again, but with more liquid and/or banana.

My husband, who is not an easy critic to impress, absolutely loved this banana bread.  I took some of the recommendations of the other bakers and added the cinnamon to the bread as well as the streusel-like center.  I liked the center of the bread but the next time, I would make extra and added it as a topping as well.  I had a little left over so I added it to the top and it gave the bread a nice crunchy contrast to the creamy, moist bread.  I also used more than one cup of banana, since some bakers said there was not enough banana flavor.  I believe I used closer to two cups of banana. Maybe next time, I will add some chocolate chips and more walnuts for more textural contrast. Awesome recipe though.

This was delicious.  I am not a real banana lover, but this bread was so good, I ate half the loaf!  I took the other half to work and it was eaten very quickly by my coworkers.

This bread is great, but it was a little dry so I added 1 cup of applesauce and when making the brown sugar layer, I loaded it with cinnamon, brown sugar and pecans so you could really taste the layer.  Turned out great!  Have made 3 times now!

I enjoyed this recipe, though I could've used more banana flavor. Loved the addition of the pecan mixture on top - will have to do that with banana bread recipes I make in the future. --Otherwise, nothing really set this apart from other recipes for me.

I made this recipe exactly as written when I needed to use up some cream cheese I had in the fridge.  I thought it was a little bland and it came out dry and crumbly.  I think it would be much better with an extra banana, brown sugar instead of white, and bake for less time.

This bread is pretty good.  I do think it lacks a flavor though.  I even added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter in addition to the filling.  It is very moist though.  Not sure that I will make again.

I have banana trees, so I've tried alot of BB recipes. This is very moist & delicious. I didn't think it was dry @ all as some suggested.  I made it exactly as recipe dictates. Next time I would add nutmeg to the batter & I'll double the pecan layer; personal preference. But, it's great as is! The texture is light. Thanx, Pam!

Made this exactly as written, it is excellent!!!  My only suggestion would be to make sure you don't take the nut/sugar/cinnamon mixture to the edge of the pan because the bread batter need to adher top and bottom so it doesn't fall apart when you cut it.

I made this in a 9 x 13 cake pan. Turned out great as a coffee cake.

Awesome recipe.  I have nearly tripled the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture though.  I simply put about half in the middle and the remaining half on top.  It always seems to turn out better also if I increase the bananas by about 50% (about 3 medium bananas or so).  I also bake for 38 minutes only so that it isn't dry.  Thanks for the great recipe!  "Grandma's"  I am told, has now been replaced!

I've baked a lot of banana breads in my 59 years. This is the BEST EVER! 
I did add extra bananas and once mix was in bread pan, "dropped" the pan to tamp it down. No problem cutting it at all. 
I love nutmeg so I added a tsp. of it ground fresh to batter and put some of the filling on top of the bread before baking. This is a recipe you can play with. WOW!

Wonderfully moist! Cream cheese adds to the flavor but is not overwhelming, and adds the extra moistness. Very good and will make again.

Very moist.  I loved the touch of cinnamon and brown sugar.  First batch I made I only did one loaf with the cinnamon/brown sugar addition, but due to popular demand all future loaves are to have it.  ;)

I have made a recipe like this that was in my family, and I add more bananas when needed.  When my bananas start to turn brown I throw them in the freezer and use these for my banana bread.

Wonderfully delicious and moist! The cinnamon brown sugar layer makes it extra special.  Made four mini loafs and sprinkled tops with raw sugar before baking, this gives the bread a nice crunch on top. Baked on bottom rack of oven for about 45 minutes.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times have come out delish!  The first time I tried to make one 5 x 9 loaf, but no matter how lo and ng I kept it in the oven, the center wouldn't cook - my oven's fault and not the recipe's.  The second time I made as muffins and they came out absolutely wonderful with no issues cooking.  My only changes were I exchanged about a 1/2 cup of brown sugar for white sugar and added the cinnamon and nuts directly to the batter.  Definately use this recipe often!

Really like this recipe - the cream cheese is a really nice addition. I did up the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and used two heaping teaspoons of cinnamon, left out the pecans. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Will use again!

OH my soo good! I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar. ( Cream cheese and brown sugar are amazing together)  I didnt have nuts and my family doesnt like cinnamon type things too much so I sprinkled peanut butter and chocolate chips in the layer instead... OUTSTANDING~

This is the best banana bread I've ever had. It was so yummy. The only change I would make would be to add a little more banana. I made this for work, and it was gone by lunch.

This is one of the creamiest banana breads i have had.  I am more of a cream cheese fan then sour cream. My kids loved it and wanted seconds. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the mixture with the mashed bananas and vanilla. then instead of mixing the pecans ,brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I didnt add the pecans at all.

This is definitely a nice take on banana bread.  bf really likes it--not a surprise, as he enjoys cream cheese.  I liked it too; makes for a different, yet still banana-y, flavor.  I left out the nuts because I'm planning on taking this to a Christmas Eve party tonight where there are young kids--and I didn't want to keep them from eating it if they want it.  So, I did everything as called for except left out the pecans.  I bet they'd be good, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious!  I mixed the cinnamon into the batter and omitted the 2 TBS brown sugar.  I also baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 40 minutes (so I could slice it into small cubes for a party) and topped it with a crumb topping (1 C flour, 3/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 C butter).  Oh, and I omitted the pecans since I didn't have any.

This banana bread was delicious!  (Even without the pecans, which I omitted for my guests.)  I used real butter, instead of margarine.  After my party, I froze the leftovers and it was still tasty when I thawed it the next week to finish it.

Great taste, but I think I would double the filling. Mine didn't make much of a ribbon.

This bread was very good.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon for more flavor.  I made one 8X4 loaf and one pan of muffins.

This bread is so moist and dense; delicious! A great way to start the day: a slice (or two) of bread with some cream cheese on top.

Fantastic recipe.  I used a tube pan for the whole recipe instead of 2 loaf pans and it cooked perfectly.  Full body, full taste.

This is great bread. If you dont like cream cheese have no fear because you cant taste it- it just gives great moisture and a cake like texture. Very good. Love the nut mixture. Looks beautiful baked in a bundt pan- great gift.

Yum! Very moist! I used 2 cups of mashed bananas and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice to the batter.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon for the nut layer. I used walnuts instead of pecans, just because that's what I had on hand. I broke the walnuts into small pieces and did not have a problem cutting into the bread as others did.  So maybe that is the key.  A keeper!

After trying several banana bread recipes, this one is the best by far! It's even still good if you use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour (to make it a bit healthier). Delicious!

very tasty.  We like the cinnamon layer in the middle, it has a nice banana flavor.  I read some posts that said there wasn't much banana flavor, maybe it was the bananas used, I use the black bananas and they have a much stronger flavor.  I didn't add nuts as I wanted to give this to friends and I don't know if they have allergies.  I also made it in 6 mini loaf pans.

This is very good banana bread, very very much like coffee cake.  That's the best way I can describe it.  I made as directed, two small loaves.  They got a little overdone...I think I will make them next time and reduce either the time in the oven, or the temperature by 25 degrees.  Overall very good, a lot of reviews said it didn't taste 'banana-y) I didn't find that to be true for my bread.  I did use more banana than was called for though, and added a little bit of cinnamon to the batter.  Will make again!

Up until today, I had a favorite go to Banana bread recipe that called for sour cream.  The idea of using cream cheese intrigued me so I made this recipe.  The only changes I made was to omit the nuts because hubby doesn't like them and I used butter instead of margarine.  
This banana bread is so moist and flavorful, OMG, we love it!

To those of you who said you'd add more bananas, please be careful.  Too many bananas changes the entire loaf and you may find as I did, that the loaves do not bake all the way thru because of too many bananas in the batter.  Try using banana extract instead!

This is, without a doubt, the best banana bread recipe I've ever made!

It was PERFECT! 
I made a sugar-free version because I don't eat sugar and I'm the dessert maker in the house, and it was magnificent.
With the cream cheese present, sugar wasn't such a key ingredient.
I added just a bit of honey to the mashed bananas and made sure they were extra ripe. And I also added 100g dates while mixing the cream cheese.
Everybody said it was the best banana bread I have ever made, even from the my sugar days!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I tried this for the first time tonight and it was so moist and flavorful. I've tried many banana bread recipes and this by far is my family's new favorite, I will always use this recipe now. I love that it makes two loaf pans, and I used 3 bananas and followed the recipe. The cream cheese and banana combination is delish!!

The batter is to die for - it smells wonderful BUT it needs to bake a lot longer than 45 minutes - I tested it but not well enough - the insides fell though the cooling rack and I had to reassemble it and return the pan to the oven

This was very yummy. When I was making it, I kept thinking to myself: "what do they mean by creamy?" It's a really different texture, and it really is 'creamy' as weird as it sounds. I thought about it and then it hit me: it's the same texture as a rich pound cake! It's virtually banana pound cake. (but more banana-ey). The only thing I didnt like about it was that the brown sugar on the outside burned. It wasn't like a coffee cake where it's still sugary, I had to cut the crust completely off. However this isn't the first recipe I've had trouble with when it called for a sugared coating on bread, so it might be my oven.

This was a very good banana bread! I love cream cheese so I just had to try it, and it didn't disappoint! I followed some of the reviewers suggestions, adding the 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter. I also omitted the nuts b/c I don't like them, and added mini chocolate chips. Next time, I will probably make it without the center all together.

Great recipe. I usually don't use a recipe more than once but this is a keeper. For those who said it lacks flavor, add more bananas. I use about 4 bananas, no measuring. Some cinnamon, nutmeg. I don't make the middle layer but this is still delicious. Didn't have any butter once and substituted olive oil and it still came out great (healthier too). Add some chocolate chips  for the kids but they love it without choco chips also.

Great Bread! I added Craisins instead of nuts, because I don't like them. Very awesome!

Just made these and they are extremely moist and had good flavor. Instead of sprinkling the cinnamon/brown sugar mix on top I actually made a glaze with brown sugar, cinnamon and butter. It was AWESOME! I also baked them in a mini muffin tin, the cook time was 6-8 minutes.

Ok, I am usually not a banana bread person, but I had some over ripe bananas, and wanted to makes something nice with them. I made this recipes as called except that I put probably 2 cups and a tad more of banana(4 bananas) as well as I added one teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and used only one to the filling..and NO NUTS, as I do not like them..so instead added some chocolate chips. :) Just a touch! IT IS FABULOUS!! :) Thank you for sharing!! I love it! :) My son who is 3yrs old, had eaten his first piece like it will run from him..so I think he agrees with me!:) Thanks again!

I used this as a guide for my bread.  I turned out awesome!!  I didnot have pecans, so I used coconut instead.  If you like coconut, it goes really good with this. I also used sour cream instead of the cream cheese. Bread came out super moist.  Love it and so does my boyfriend :)

Wow!  So good!  Best banana bread I've made yet!  I did, as did others, use 3 large size rip bananas.  I also omitted the pecans from the center swirl, but next time will definitely add them.  I'm not a huge nut fan, but I think the center of nuts would work...not too much and not too little.

The brown sugar and cinnamon really complete this.  I doubled the amount of the inside mix and used walnuts and it was delish.  The one thing i learned for the next time is that I underestimated half of the mix and I did not have much for the top portion.  I will make this again.

The bread itself was fantastic but...I allowed my husband to make it and he accidently put the cinnamon mixture on top of the bread instead of putting it slightly under the top layer of batter....which would have been great if...there would have been more brown sugar added...we came to the conclusion that we will make it again but...we will add 1 teas. of cinnamon to a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and sprinkle that over the top...The mixture on top made the bread look pretty but the cinnamon ratio to brown sugar ratio was off.

This banana bread is the best that I've ever made. The cream cheese makes this moist, and   I added a small amount of chocolate chips, and a small amount of walnuts instead of the pecans. Everyone that ate it, loved it and the 3 loaves I made were gone in two days.

FANTASTIC! I LOVED everything about this bread: how easy it was to mix up, how great the batter smelled, how WONDERFUL the house smelled while it was baking, how it was sweet, but not too sweet...the list goes on and on! I made this in my tube pan and it fit perfectly. Also, I doubled the nut filling (I used walnuts), because I wanted a nice layer in between. This bread was so good on so many different levels. This is definately my new go-to banana bread recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

By far the best banana bread recipe ever! My family loves it! My dad who absolutely hates cream cheese loves this bread, even asked for a second loaf of his own.  He still doesn't know what's in it. We will just keep that our little secret. ;)

I absolutely loved it! I'm not much of a banana bread person but this one won me over! Normally banana breads and carrot cakes are dry, but this recipe HAS NO SALT, so it doesn't dry it out. Then, the banana and the cream cheese give a wonderful moistness and texture.  As for adjustments, I used 3 bananas, lt. brown sugar instead of white, and only 2 cups of flour so it wouldn't be so dense. My family loved it and just hours later, there's hardly any left! I will definitely make this again!

This was the best banana bread I've made in a while. I only had half a package of cream cheese so I subbed sour cream for the remaining four ounces. That was the only change I made. Seriously creamy and rich. Bonus was I had no issues with cranky loaves. They just about fell out of the pan. Wonderful recipe!

VERY creamy and moist. To make it healthier I subbed 1/4 applesause for 1/2 of the butter, 3/4 wheat flour and 3/4 all-purpose, and REDUCED FAT cream cheese *never bake with fat free cream cheese. I used 3 medium ripe bananas, cut in 1/2 inch pieces. Since the bananas make it heavy be sure to use 3/4 tsp baking soda for it to hold up the crust.

Yum!  I mixed the nuts and brown sugar into the batter instead of just on the top and I used walnuts rather than pecans (forgot to buy pecans, but had walnuts on hand).  It came out so good - I think the cream cheese really adds something that makes this extra great!  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy and EASY - made it with my four and two year old. I just put brown sugar in the middle layer (no nuts or cinnamon) and chocolate chips on top... next time will put the choc chips in the middle in place of the pecans. GREAT recipe, will make it whenever the bananas go bad! N

Excellent banana bread--I added more brown sugar, cinnamon and bananas.  The only thing I was disappointed with was how my bread sank once it came out of the oven.  I added more baking powder but it still did not hold the shape.  If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.  Other than that, this is my new banana bread recipe--thanks Pam!

Update: 2nd time I made this, I did the br. sugar, cinn., sugar in the middle of it. Turned out very nice! Thanks! Original review: I used the last of my Thanksgiving bananas with this recipe. They were black and liquidy, and I almost threw them out they were so gross, but I am glad I didn't. Those make the BEST banana bread, and this was wonderful. I love the addition of cr. cheese to the traditional BB also. Thanks for a great recipe! And no more banana bread around here, I think if I make another loaf of banana bread, my family is going to start picketing...

Totally love thyis recipe - i would add more banana's next time, also what i did was add rasins in one batch and then used some of the nuts, cinnamon and brown sugar mixture i added butter and oatmeal for a oatmeal nut crust, also i used Splenda instead of regular sugar, my husband (mr sweettooth himself) loved this.  Taking one loaf to work.  Would make this again and again.

My hubby and friends really liked the cream cheese flavor.  I put 3-4 bananas in and add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and some times choc. chips instead of the nuts.  I also substitute half of the white flour with whole wheat.

Wow a banana bread I actually like! I usually HATE banana bread, but this one was moist and well spiced. I followed some other reviews and made a double batch of the cinnamon mixture. I used half the cinnamon to mix in with the batter and the other half as stated in the recipe. It turned out fabulous!

This was a moist bread that was made pretty and delicious with the streusel ribbon in the bread.  We made more streusel using 1 cup brown sugar, 3T flour, 2t cinammon, and 3T butter cut in.  I am making it again this week.  Thanks!

This is wonderful banana bread.  You must try this recipe.  I have made it several times.  I always mix the pecans, cinnamon and brown sugar directly into the batter.  Yum!

We absolutely love this recipe! I've made it many times in many different ovens. When I first started making it, it was really gooey but the top was over cooked. I then found out that the bottom heating element of my oven wasn't working. Anyway, after getting that fixed it comes out perfect every single time. I've started making then into muffins and they are wonderful!!! I don't add nuts and I sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar on top of batter before baking. Sometimes I add a layer of chocolate, white choc, peanut butter or butterscotch chips in the middle. About 30 minutes in the oven is perfect timing.

OH MY!!!  I'm sitting here now with a cup of coffee and a creamy banana muffin and I am literally ooohing and ahhhing.  The recipe provided made one 8x5 and then I made 4 giant muffins using the rest of the batter.  This one is a true keeper and I think I will replace my favorite banana bread recipe with this one.  I didn't bother measuring the 1 cup mashed banana; just threw in 3 ripe bananas and 1/4 tsp banana extract, as I wasn't sure that my bananas were as ripe as I usually like them.  It baked up beautifully and it actually does have a 'creamy' texture while being so nice and flaky and light.  I absolutely love this recipe!  thanks so much.

I am so sad to give this only two stars since I had such high hopes for this recipe. The outside was almost overdone, the inside wasn't done, the flavor was ok, but nothing special. The house did smell heavenly while baking! I will go back to my previous standby recipes or continue to make the excellent Banana Crumb Muffins from this site. So sorry.....

Excellent! I did make a couple of changes, I used three bananas and I did not add the cinnamon, but instead mixed in the brown sugar and pecans and added a diced apple.  I also added an additional teaspoon of vanilla.

I didn't have a loaf pan so I made 24 muffins from this recipe. I made the first dozen layering the cinnamon/nut mixture between the two layers of batter, and the second dozen I just mixed the cinnamon and nuts with the rest of the batter.  The first batch tasted very plain, the second with the mixed batter was much tastier and flavorful. I also added nutmeg to give it a little zing.  This was a good recipe for banana bread, but I'm more fond of the moister gooier recipes.  This was more cakelike.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe.  Some hints:  Use overripe bananas - I store them in my freezer when they start to turn black and they work beautifully.   Go ahead and double the bananas, add the vanilla when mashing the bananas (seems to infuse the flavor more).   Baking basics:  EVERYTHING at room temperature before you start.  It makes a huge difference.  I go ahead and make a double batch each time because I like to share!

no nuts, added cinnamon and extra vanilla to the batter. used 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Need to use my smaller loaf pans, these turned out a bit flat, adding some sugar on top would have been a nice added texture.  Yummy

This was my first time making banana bread.  It turned out pretty good.  The bananas were ripe enough to be fermented, so mashing wasn't required.  I also used oats instead of nuts.  It turned out so good I made two more batches.

I used butter, low fat cream cheese, and one additional banana.  I forgot to add the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  This is very moist, even days after being in the refrigerator. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This bread is very moist! I made it without the swirl in the middle. Could have used some cinnamon added to the batter. Otherwise, quite tasty, but not the best banana bread out there.
 Tried this recipe because I was out of sour cream, which is needed for most other banana bread recipes.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have made EVER! Mixing it with the cream cheese and adding the middle layer is what put this bread at the top! 

Adjustments:  I doubled the sugar/pecan mixture.  The flavor was amazing and I personally didn't feel like it was enough.  And to make and even fluffier bread mixture, use the whipped cream cheese at room temperature. 

Thanks so much for the recipe  :)

I love this recipe. But I made a few changes. I put the chocolate and nuts and brown sugar and cinnamon in the entire mixture so it adds to the entire flavor of the bread. Also I use whole wheat flour and Splenda for a healthier option. (wheat flour is a bit dry so I add in a half cup of sour cream in addition to the cream cheese and butter to keep the moisture)

I didn't care for this bread.  I added the cinnamon and brown sugar into the batter instead of in the middle.  I thought the bread lacked flavor.  I would add more bananas if I were to ever make it again.

This version of banana bread is delicious!  I made it exactly as written, except I added closer to 2 C of mashed bananas.  I also didn't have 2 loaf pans, so I made it in a 9x9 pan.  Turned out great!  Would definitely make again.

This has been my favorite banana bread recipe for over a year now. Everyone I make it for loves it. The pecan ribbon in the middle makes it unique & I love the flavor that the cinnamon adds, too.

I have made banana bread now and then and have never found a recipe that claimed it was 'moist' and it WAS! This is absoltely delicious. Only changes I made was to add the juice of 1/2 a lemon and zest of a whole lemon. I also made this recipe into one loaf not two and baked for 1 hr 10 mins apprx. Perfect, moist and YUMMY!

This is the best recipe for banana bread I have ever tasted! Sooo moist and cream it practically melts in your mouth! Only thing I changed was I use 4 very ripe bananas (more than a cup) and about a half a cup of brown sugar. Made mine in a bunt pan, as I have no loaf pans! Family is requesting it for Thanksgiving.

Hands down the best banana bread I've ever made! This is my favorite recipe. I make this one in mini loaf pans so I can pass it around. One twist to try: I was seriously craving some banana bread, but I had no regular cream cheese, so I used an 8oz tub of Philly Strawberry cream cheese instead. It gave it just a hint of strawberry flavor in the background. Delicious!

I don't give out 5 stars very much, but wow this was great!   It was moist and delicious.  I added extra banana and some chocolate chips.  I am on Weight Watchers, but this was worth spending my points on this...One of the best recipes i've made on this site.  Truly a 5 star...

I used two banana's, put the cinnamon/brown sugar in the batter but left out the pecans.  Did one pan plain, and added cherry craisens to the batter of the second pan. It tastes awesome, I was able to bake it for only 35 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.  Brushed the tops with butter as soon as they came out.

I made this into muffins and topped them with the brown sugar mixture (I used Splenda brown sugar). Cooked the muffins for about 30 minutes. My husband loved them; I thought they were slightly above average.

Wow!  This delicious bread just came out of the oven and it was as moist as promised.  I didn't add nuts, but it was still spectacular.  I didn't change anything else.  I will make this again for sure.

Im used to dark banana bread, so when this lighter colored loaf came out i said to my boyfriend that this was a waste of ingredients.  After it cooled and sat for a bit, honest to goodness this is the BEST banana bread ive made, my 4 yr old cant stop eating it! (neither can i)  As yo gabba gabba would say "try it, you'll like it!"

This was certainly a differant way to make banna bread, it was also NOT very good. I did not like the end result, it turned out crumbly and hard to eat without making a mess. My family gave this a two of three thumbs down. There was alot of left overs with this one. :(

FANTASTIC!  I ommited the nuts (hubby doesn't like them) and just added the cinnamon to the mixture. Used 3 good sized bananas and split the sugar 1/2 brown 1/2 white. YUMMERS! Oh, I used applesauce 1/3 cup instead of margarine. Perfect..moist, lovely.

This, by far, is the best, and most moist banana bread I have ever had!  Good thing it makes two loaves because me and my husband almost ate a whole loaf by ourself!  I used butter instead of margarine and I didnt have any nuts so I left them out but will def. make this again with the nuts! I would give this 10 stars if I could!

I love this recipe. The cream cheese makes it moist and the brown sugar and cinnamon breaks the monotony of normal banana bread. It's like a little surprise. Of course I use a little more than it calls for and put a little on top too. I gave loaves of this as Christmas gifts .

Wonderful! My boyfriend asked me to make banana bread once and I must admit to not being very fond of bananas myself. This recipe sounded the most appealing, and I am so glad I chose it! My boyfriend absolutely loved it and I even enjoyed it, I have made this recipe quite a few times now and have never modified a thing. Lovely!

I tried this recipe when making my first banana bread. It was so easy to make. I love it (and I'm not even a big fan of bananas)! My parents really enjoyed it and my three-year-old couldn't get enough. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Excellent. Made the recipe exactly as printed.  However, I didn't have two loaf pans available, so I made it in a bundt pan, and it came out beautifully with the same bake time.

This is pretty darn good.  I followed all the ingredients.  The only thing I did do different is the nuts, bsugar and cin I just mixed in, I did not layer.  That is just way I roll.  It was great.  I was looking for something just a little different, put on some butter and you have a great treat, its nice and moist.

Delicious! Per a friend's advice, I doubled the banana. Put half the nut mixture in middle and other half on top. Has more of a coffee-cake appeal than bread, but excellent flavor and moistness! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great Banana Bread. It was almost like a banana bread pudding. I actually cut a thick slice and topped it with some vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate sauce and served it as a dessert. It was very decadent.

Absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf, but I guess I could've just kept it since apparently I have a very large bread pan. My sister nearly devoured the whole thing in a day! Will definitely keep this recipe.

I didn't have a bread pan, so I halved the recipe and baked the batter in a bundt pan.  Worked nicely.
Then I got a bread pan, filled it about 3/4 and put the rest of the batter in muffin cups.  Worked nicely as well.

I stopped looking for other Banana Bread recipes after we tried this one.  My family loves it!  I have made this recipe as-is and it turns out great.  To get our favorite version, like others, I usually increase the banana and put the brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecans right into the mix.  If I have an extra banana on hand that is less ripe, I cut it up into chunks and add it to the batter.  
I was out of cream cheese last time I made this and put in 1 cup of sour cream in its place - still turned out great!

I baked this in a bundt pan for 40 minutes, that was sprinkled with cinnamon sugar in the bottom, for an added extra crunch. Great recipe, we just loved how moist this cake was.

By far, the best banana bread I've ever had (or made).  I ate two of these right out of the oven.  Even good without the brown sugar center.  I'd give this 6 stars if I could!!

I have made this bread many times and am now just getting around to reviewing it. I follow the recipe except i do sub butter for the marg. Today i used 3 bananas and walnuts instead of pecans and made muffins with it. They are DELISH and took 22-25 minutes to bake.

This banana bread was awesome! I made it for my fiancé and he LOVED it, too. The only thing I did different was I took the nuts out (don’t care for nuts) and I didn't do the cinnamon center as suggested. I did the "Banana Crumb Muffin" (on allrecipes.com) topping. (In a small bowl, mix together 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle topping over muffins [loaf]). It was delish! I will make again for sure!!! Note: I have bigger loaf pans so it only made one, but took longer to cook. Don't "walk" away, try it!

Wonderful! This is the only b.b. recipe I'll make from now on. Very moist. The cream cheese flavor is very subtle. I used only 2 cups of sugar, instead of 2.5, and that was fine.

I see that this doesn't call for salt; I'll add 1 tsp next time. I think salt reacts positively in the chemical process with the baking powder and baking soda.

The pecan/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture was a little too much, so next time I'll make less of that. When you do make it, don't make it in a shallow bowl. You need to have something deep so you can break up the packed brown sugar, and really stir up the cinnamon.

Thank you for the recipe.

I've made so many different banana breads over the years, but this recipe has replaced all the others.  Made according to the recipe (doubling the topping) this is the perfect banana bread.  I've had so many requests for this bread!  It never lasts more than a day (and I make two batches).  Thanks so much for a wonderful banana bread recipe!

My Husband started this recipe a year ago and since then we have given the recipe to over 30 friends. It is a huge hit. We lowered the temp to 325 for an hour to give it the perfect color perfect taste.

Perfectly good, moist, and easy banana bread, although I'm still looking for one with more depth of flavor to it. To note the changes -- I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, used low-fat (not fat free) cream cheese, used 1/4 cup brown sugar plus 1 cup white instead of all white, 3 mashed bananas (probably a little more than a cup, but it's how many I had), and I didn't make the streusel layer but instead mixed the cinnamon in with the dry ingredients and folded in the pecans at the end. Oh, and the recipe doesn't call for any salt, so I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients. I also had one larger loaf pan, and put about 2/3 of the batter into that (bake time of 55 minutes), and put the rest into muffin cups (in liners) that baked for about 35 minutes.

Just made this recipe and it smells great. I added one extra banana and also made it in a fancy cake pan so that I can present it tonight for some friends. I did manage to taste just a little of it and it is awesome. I think I have found a new recipe.

Awesome!  This was sooo good.  I usually don't actually come back to rate the recipes but just had to for this.  Very moist and wonderful!  I did change one thing:  omitted the pecans and added frozen thawed blueberries for extra goodness.  This will certainly be my go to for banana bread.  The cream cheese gives it that extra something.  YUM!

Very Good. I wanted more of a banana taste so i halved the cream cheese and doubled the banana...the bread was a little crumbly so I think maybe I should have left all the cream cheese in and just doubled the bananas. I was heavy handed with the brown sugar and nuts also. YUM!

This is a great recipe. I found it to be better the next day.  I followed a reviewers suggestions and made a larger batch of the filling. I put some in the middle and on the top. I also sprinkled a little white sugar on the top. It smelled great, it looked great, and it tasted great.  Good recipe!

I really like this recipe.  Sometimes banana bread can taste so bland and the brown sugar and cinnamon definitely add something.  I used 3 bananas (2 cups) and omitted the pecans and it came out really moist.  I also used real butter, not margarine.  The vanilla gave it a little more of a cake flavor than I sometimes want in a bread; most quick bread recipes don't add extracts, it the cake recipes that do that.  So, if you want it to be more bread like, you might leave that out.  Also, you could cook this in a bundt cake pan and put brown sugar/cinnamon mixture in the bottom of the pan before you put in the batter.  That might make for a really pretty and yummy banana bundt cake.  This is my new favorite banana bread recipe!

It was a very good recipe; however, it was almost a little too moist for the bottom part of the loaf did not cook all the way through.

This is a wonderful banana bread recipe.  I used macadamia nuts instead of pecans because it is what I had on hand.  YUMMY!  It's better the next day after it's been wrapped in saran wrap and cool.  Very moist!

I used fat free cream cheese and they were still very creamy and good. I made some of the batter in a mini-muffin pan and just sprinkled the brown sugar/cinnamon filling on top. Turned out great. I used four bananas but thought the muffins were more "creamy" than "banana". The flavor was mild but very nice.

A moist and creamy banana bread for sure!  I took some suggestions of reviewers and added extra banana.  I also substituted walnuts for pecans and ground them in the food processor to make a fine paste and swirled through half of the bread.  YUM!  I think I may tweak it a little more next time, but this was really a delicious, simple recipe.

This is a great banana bread recipe that I have made several times and always get raves on. I usually substitute 1 cup of wheat flour for all purpose and add 3 T water. I've used 2 or 3 bananas depending on what I have and how much banana flavor I want to come through. Recently I also made this in a bundt pan instead of 2 loaf pans and it came out great. I pressed some of the topping mixture into the bottom of the bundt and it looked great when I turned it out onto the plate.

Made it for afternoon tea and everyone loved it.  I liked the texture, which was nice and moist but I like my banana bread to have more banana flavour-which this one didn't.  Added lemon rind to mixture and would add more bananas next time.  Other than the lack of banana flavour, the bread was good.

Just made this tonight  in a college dorm kitchen and lots of people were coming in to find out what smelled so good.  I replaced all the butter with more mashed banana, didn't put in vanilla, put in a pinch of salt and a lot of cinnamon, and stirred in butterscotch chips.    It was very good, but tasted the same to me as the Banana Banana Bread recipe, which I'll probably continue to make instead.  However, this recipe gave me a good idea: next time I'll make a regular banana bread recipe without cinnamon, but mix cream cheese, honey and cinnamon together and then swirl it into the unbaked bread.  Should be good!

This was the best banana bread recipe I have come  across yet! I used walnuts instead of pecans because I find that walnuts and bananas make a fantastic combination. Also, I made a little bit of extra cinnamon,brown sugar, & walnut mixture to put on top of the loaf as well as in the middle. It turned out great! It is more like a coffee cake with that because of the crunchy topping. Also added more bananas and a little bit more vanilla. This is a great recipe truly!

What a great recipe! I served this to a bunch of my girlfriends and they went wild! It's also really easy to heat up and tastes just as delicious! I always brush on a bit of lemon juice on the top just as it comes out of the oven. I will definitely make this one again!

I made this using 3 large bananas and it was just right.  My parents loved it and between the 3 of us we ate the one of the loaves in one sitting.  My mom said she couldn't stop thinking about it.  I am saving the 2nd loaf for tomorrow because quick breads are always better the next day.  If this one was so good on day one it is bound to be even tastier for day 2.  If you live in high altitude, please add about 1/4 cup more flour and sugar so it doesn't sink.  If you want a pretty loaf for giving this is a nice choice too as the filling looks "gourmet".

Wow...how great.  I made this recipe and made one loaf of bread for my daughter's class for a snack.  I omitted the nut mixture because of the whole nut allergy thing.  I used the rest of the batter to make muffins and I put the nut mixture on top.  Both the loaf and the muffins were a HUGE hit.  Even my sister whos thinks she makes the best banana bread in the world said it was really good.

This recipe is very good.  The texture is very creamy and moist, and it all of my coworkers raved about it.  However, I agree with other reviewers that it tastes too much like coffee cake and needs more sugar.  Next time I will add more and see how it tastes.

Oh my word this is soooo delicious! I was a bit hesitant at first because I thought the cinnamon & brown sugar filling sounded a bit odd so I only added a small amount to each loaf. Now I wish I would have added lots more! What an awesome combination. This recipe makes a very mild flavor banana bread with a light texture - it's almost like a coffee cake. I did make two changes and one was to use butter instead of margerine.  I never cook with margerine and I love the taste and results of pure butter! I recommend using butter definitely. And I used walnuts instead of pecans and the walnuts were wonderful but I think either of those nuts would result in a superb bread. This will be my new all time favorite banana bread recipe.

I'm throwing away all my other banana bread recipes.  This one is the clear winner!  My family has requested it three times in one month. It definately will be one of the breads I give as gifts for Christmas too.
Excellent texture, moist, wonderful!

This was my first time making banana bread.  The only changes I made was mixing the brown sugar & cinnamon into the batter, and leaving out the nuts.

My husband really liked it.  I don't even like banana bread and I've been snacking on it!  My husband's only complaints is it's kind of crummy, he likes a more dense banana bread.  I prefer this lighter version.  The taste is awesome!  This will surely go into my recipe book.

Okay, I have found the very best Banana Bread recipe! I know I rated the other banana bread, The Best Banana Bread as five star but this one over rates that one by five more! The other is great if you aren't a person who likes a lot of spice. This one tops them all and is very moist. Who knew that cream cheese would be the key? I loved it and so did everyone else. I am making it again today because I was ordered to do so! You have got to try this one you won't be disappointed! Thanks again!

Am I the only one whose bread rises beautifully only to shrink into 2 inch loaves when cool?  The flavor is fine, but mine turns out very dense...almost "wet" it's so moist.  I have tried making this just as written and also by adding more bananas...same result.  I will stick to the banana bread on this site with the sour cream.  Thanks anyway.  To each his own...

Loved this recipe....I added 3 bananas (1 1/2 Cups because I had already mashed them up and had read that some thought it didn't have enough banana flavor).  I also baked it in a pan that made 8 small loafs.  Might add a little more Brown sugar and cinnamon mixture next time-was a little bit bland for my taste but loved the texture and it was very moist. Just need to adjust a little to your personal tastes.

Thanks for a great recipe.

The cream cheese adds a slightly different texture, but I still prefer a more traditional banana bread-I agree with one of the other raters who said that there wasn't much banana flavor (I used three bananas)

Although good, I found the bread heavier and the texture not as moist and without the same "mouth feel" as others.   Sorry I can't think of a better description.  Also, not much banana flavor and I used three very ripe/soft bananas.  I think I will try it again, but will add a 1/2 cup of oil and maybe even more banana.

I have tried many different banana bread recipes and this was the best so far.  My husband couldn't get enough of it. He said it was the best I have ever made.  I did increase the mashed bananas to 2 cups and the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I also mixed the topping into the batter.  Excellent.

this is the most moist awesome banana bread i have made yet.  i even messed up the recipe and threw the brown sugar nuts and cinnamon into the total mix and it came out great!!  the second time i made it, i skipped the pecans, added the brown sugar and cinnamon in w/the rest of the ingredients and it is wonderful.

This is good, but not necessarily a favorite.
I put the pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the batter and just cut it in a little.  

I think the bread could cook a little longer even though the toothpick came out clean when the checked.

Not sure if I'll make it again.

Maybe my expectations for this bread was too high. But after reading the reviews I was a little disappointed with this one. The batter was thick and difficult to spread on top of the cinnamon sugar layer and the finished product was not as moist as other recipes I've tried. Will not make again.

Good, very moist.  I dont have a loaf pan so I make all of my breads in a 9x9 glass pan.  I know, its strange, but it works.  Had to cook it a bit longer, and it was still a little undone in the middle.  But we loved it anyway!  One thing I would add is salt.  The flavor is kinda bland without it.  I would make it again!

I have never made banana bread before-this recipe was soooooo good the bread came out creamy and moist. I will definitely be making this again! (one problem-I had to keep the bread in the oven an extra 12 min, but it still came out great).

I made my 1st loaf yesterday with regular cream cheese. It was SO DELICIOUS! I wanted to experiment a little so today I made with the lower fat Neufchatel cream cheese...I couldn't tell the difference! Next time I'm going to try making with fat free cream cheese! I also like to mix the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture throughout & sprinkle some on top. I LOVE this recipe! I will be making this quite often!  Thank you Pam!

This is by far the BEST banana bread I have ever made or eaten!!  Most banana breads are all heavy and gooey in the middle, but not this one!!  It's so light and fluffy and the nuts and cinnamon in the middle give it a real nice look.  A definate KEEPER!!

This is a recipe has great taste but I 
don't much care for spliting the batter 
with nuts and cinnamon, I just mix those
items in with the batter. It tastes
better and makes the overall recipe
 easier.

The first time I made this, I didn't realize it was suppose to make 2 loaves. I made one and it was big and amazing. I also did 1/4 cup brown sugar with 2 TBSP cinnamon, and 1 1/2 cups of smushed bananas,as someone else suggested.

This is by far the BEST banana bread EVER! I did make a few changes. I substituted semi sweet chocolate chips (1 cup) for the pecans. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, increased the vanilla extract to 1 Tbsp, 2 Tbsp cinnamon, 3 bananas. Took a lot longer to cook but so worth the wait. It really is addictive!

My Mom requested banana bread for her birthday. This recipe is most excellent! I think I used extra cinnamon on the top, but otherwise stayed true to the directions.

One thing I would try to get right is the middle layer of pecans. Mine was a bit too high and the top of the loaf wanted to peel from the rest of the loaf. This was entirely my error. It still tasted great.

Yummy. The cream cheese gives it a creamy flavour. Will make it again.  I used butter instead of margarine and used only 2 cups of sugar rather than 2 1/4 cups.

Yum.  Made this whole wheat, and used up five overripe bananas.  I skipped the cinnamon filling and put about 2/3 bag of chocolate chips in.  I made one 10 inch loaf and one mini loaf.  The mini loaf was gone within minutes!  I'm not sure if the cream cheese really did a lot for this recipe, but I had a lot of cream cheese I needed to use up, so this worked for us.

Don't bake much, because every time I try I end up with super dense cakes :( BUT I tried this recipe yesterday (adjusted the servings to 10 only) and it turned out to be amazing! The bread was so moist, soft, everyone loved it!
Although it sat in the oven for about 55 min or so, but all in all ended up tasting great! Must try :)

Yummy! Moist and surprisingly fluffy. I halved the recipe and used 1/3 cup WW flour, 1/4 cup sugar and walnuts instead of pecans. Although my batter turned out rather stiff (and that made me a little nervous for a while), the end result turned out great. Would make this again for sure.

This was very moist.  I used four bananas; which I think now I could probably have used one more.  But its all in your own taste.  My husband ate 1/2 of the loaf!  Thank goodness you have enough for two of them.  I made one loaf with nuts and one without; just to see the difference; since I don't really care for nuts.  I used pecans which I think complement the brown sugar. This is a must try!

This recipe is the "bomb".  I always wanted to say that.  My family loves this recipe.  I do not put nuts in it because of some of my kids do not like nuts in bnb.  Note of change ...I mix everything together not layered like this recipe calls for.  Never tried it layered. Very yummy with the cream cheese, cinnamon and brown sugar!
I always make this recipe and no others!  Kraft has this one too but without the cinnamon and brown sugar.  
Next time I am going to use less sugar to cut down on calories.  Yummy.

So moist and delicious! You really cannot go wrong with cream cheese. My family loved it and everyone agreed it's better then my mom's decade old recipe. Love to beat ma in the kitchen! The cream cheese as well as the crunchy, flavorful center makes it one step above. I will turn to this recipe anytime my bananas get too ripe. Thanks for sharing!

This is, by far, the BEST banana bread I've made so far.  Super moist, delicious flavor.  I used 4 large bananas and omitted the cinnamon since my husband is not a fan.  The middle layer makes the bread awesome!  Thank you for such a great recipe, Pam.

So yummy! I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out amazing. The only thing I did different was 3/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c b sugar. I also added in some chocolate chips into the batter and in the middle section. So moist and fluffy!

Just made this for the family and for my son to take to work tomorrow. Followed the recipe exactly as written, only thing I had to do is add to the cooking time, I did so at 2 min increments until such time the toothpick came out draw.

Just sliced a piece of it off, amazing (and I am not a big fan of bananas)!!!

This is a great banana bread recipe.  I used low-fat cream cheese but added semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I sprinkled the mixture between two layers and then on top of the loaf.  I'll be baking this again for sure.

I very much prefer the Sour Cream Banana Bread on this site over this one.  This has more cream cheese flavor than banana flavor and it is very sweet.  I even made it twice before reviewing, making sure to use very ripe bananas.  Threw away the first batch and gave away the second.

This bread is alright. I found the loaf to break in two pieces when I tool it out of the pan due to the nutty cinnamon middle. Next time I make this I will swirl the middle around, so it will be like a banana cinnamon bread, yum!

This is the first time I've ever made banana bread and I was super pleased with the results.     I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, doubled the middle/filling part (which I may not do next time), doubled my banana usage and left a tiny bit of space between the edges and the filling so that the bread would seal up nicely.    I initially thought that I'd be able to taste the cream cheese - I definitely could not! The bread was super moist though and rich and the layer in the middle was really beautiful.    I would definitely make this again, but it made SO much I think I'd try and make half the recipe next time.

Wonderful recipe!! The more bananas the better flavor of course, but this is so moist. This is a no-fail recipe...you can't go wrong! I DID add 2 tablespoonfuls of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the flour mixture. I also substituted the 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. My young boys and husband love this recipe.

This was really good, although it needs just a little more flavor.  I added 3 ripe bananas and cooked it for about an hour.  It's very moist and the topping is an extra special treat!

This was very tasty and very moist. It came out of the oven fluffy,but collapsed soon after. This may have been user error, but it was very heavy.

I made this recipe tonight because I had some very ripe bananas I needed to use ASAP.  This recipe was very easy to follow, quick and easy to make the batter and boy oh boy is it good! I actually made this batter into muffins and did some with cranberries and some with choc. chips. I used the brown sugar/cinnamon for the tops of the cranberry muffins. These are amazing!!!! SO MOIST!! I will definately be using this recipe again!

I try every banana bread recipe I can get my hands on.  This one is definately in my top 5.  I've never had a recipe with cream cheese; that really added something good to it.  I also liked the "stuff" in the middle.  My mom didn't really care for that part but I thought it was different and added to the overall result.  I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe but when all is said and done, I may come back to this one!

My husband and 17 year old daughter loved this.  They loved to spread the butter and eat it.  I used one big loaf pan so it did take a long time for it to be cooked through......

Super, super good!  I too cut the butter in half and used applesauce for the other half.  Then, just for the heck of it I added 2T. of Malibu rum and a little extra flour.  For the brown sugar / cinnamon mixture I sprinkled half of it on top of the bottom layer and then mixed the rest into the top layer of batter before pouring it on top.

This was good, but I don't know that I would say it was the best that I have ever had.  I have to say it was nice and moist, which I love but is was also very dense.  All in all, I would make this again.

If this could be 10 stars I would most certaintly rate it that high.  I have made 4 loaves in the past 2 days and cannot keep a crumb of this more than a few hours.  Honestly....this has got to be THEE best banana bread there ever was or will be.  Everything you could want....flavor, texture, moistness, tenderness, little flavor boost with the brown sugar/cinnamon/pecan ribbon.  I just can't say enough about this must try recipe.  I only bake for 40 minutes and it is perfect!!  Thanks for sharing an absolute wonderful recipe.

This is a pretty good banana bread, and I didn't mean to but I picked up the self-rising flour instead of AP and it came out just fine! Tasted the cinnamon more than banana I'll say.

This bread came out nicely.  I baked it for 45 minutes in a bundt pan and also used almond extract in place of vanilla extract only because I had run out of vanilla extract and didn't know it.  Nice texture, not too dense.  :)

Best banana bread I've had.  I used half the cream cheese and made up for it by adding sour cream.  I skipped the strudel part and added some chocolate chips.

i thought this recipe was wonderful! i never would have thought of cinnamon in banana bread but the way it was incorperated in this recipe was just enough. i thought it would be even better, if there were just a little more cream cheese and banana,which i may try for the holidays. it truely was moist,fluffy. my family loved it! thank you for a great recipe.

I also changed this a bit by following the suggestions of others. I used 1/3 C applesauce instead of the margarine; I also substituted 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 tsp baking soda for the eggs as other readers advised. This worked out fine and perhaps would only have been improved if my mixer hadn't broken!

This was such a moist and tasty banana bread! I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I used crushed almonds instead of pecans! but i loved that little suprise in the middle. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top to give the top a bit of a crunch!! Such a great and easy recipe! Thank you so much!

Great recipe and easy to follow.  For those who don't get enough 'banana' flavor; I like to leave bananas in the freezer until they're black.  When needed, just thaw and clip the the end of the peel and a nice, flavorful, already mooshed banana can be squeezed out.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever found.  It is comes out light and very moist.  My husband does not like banana at all but loves this bread.  We double the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture because we don't add the nuts.  Everytime I make this recipe it does not stay around very long.

Excellent!!  I don't think I will ever make another BNB as this one is fantastic.  I couldn't even wait until the loaf cooled down....I had to try it even hot!!  I can't wait until breakfast tomorrow morning.  I had all of the ingredients at home, including 2 very ripe bananas.  I used walnuts, which is my preference over pecans.  I don't care for the recipe title.  It should be "Streusel Banana Bread".  Thank you for the great recipe!!

Absolutely the best I've ever had.  I only made one with an extra banana in it.  Used walnuts instead of pecans in the center filling.  I've already eaten two pieces and can't wait for breakfast tomorrow.

This turned out really well.  I made two batches.  One of which i did normally, and the other one I added half a bag of chocolate chips.  I like the ones with chips better, but both were good.  I would make this again.

Another great BB recipe!  I have to say this is my favorite AR BB recipe so far.  This is so moist and so full of flavor. I used smart balance butter and used half brown sugar and half splenda for the sugar in the batter.  Also used half white and half WW flour and this bread still rocked.

Very moist! I made mini muffins (minus the brownsugar and cinnamon mixture) and these were simply delicious. I used three medium sized bananas, used half brown sugar and half white sugar (because I like the "crust" you get from using brown sugar) instead of all white and cut that down to just two cups. Plenty sweet. A little trick for those of you with picky kids or veggie-hating hubbies (I have both!): I threw in a 1/2 cup of butternut squash puree to up the vitamins and such.  You can't even taste or see the squash, but you get all the goodness of that veggie. Anyways, five stars!!

This recipe was really good and moist. I had to change it because I did not have the pecans. The first time I made it, I added chocolate chunks that had caramel in them. It was so good!  After that, I usually make it with mini chocolate chips in them.

I made this recipe today and can't say enough about it! It has a great taste and texture. I added chocolate chips instead of the Pecans and my family loved it. Will definitly use this one again!

Pretty darn god as it reads.  I thought that it could be a little sweeter and have a little more flavor.  I will be making this again but I will probably making some slight changes due to preferences.

I was looking for a muffin recipe and when I came across this I decided to try it. This makes great muffins and I'm looking forward to repeating as bread. I did add and extra banana and banana extract for my husband, but I'm sure it would have been just as delicious with no changes.

I didn't get to try this creation I made but the ones that did loved it so much.  I dropped it off at one location, then I got a call 20 minutes later that it was already gone!  I didn't have pecans or baking soda so I added another teaspoon of baking powder.  I also added sugar free vanilla pudding, raisins and about 1 cup of milk.  I dusted the loaf pans with cinnamon and sugar and sprinkled flax seeds on top.  You can also substitute the butter/margarine with flax seed meal.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

Good bread - my husband especially liked it.  The only change I made was to bake it in a greased/floured angel food pan for 55 minutes @ 325.  It came out beautifully and looks more like a coffee cake.

I had planned to make this for a bake sale at my college. I cut up two slices and let my friends try some, and the one kid thought it was so good, he bought the rest of the loaf (approximately 6 inches) for $20! 
The only thing I did differently was use banana extract instead of vanilla. The flavor was excellent, and I still only used 2 bananas.

This makes amazing banana bread. I actually love to make it into mini muffins which are great for breakfast and lunch boxes. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe and the only reason it's not getting five stars from me is because I would feel like I'm cheating on my grandmother's banana cake recipe (which is unbelievably good, too). So 4 3/4 stars for this one.

Very good recipe.  I liked that is was easy too.  I agree with others that this is more cake like than bread like, but that didn't matter to me... still delicious.  I like it even better with plain cream cheese spread on a slice.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand... Will make again for sure.

YUM!  Great, great recipe. This really should be called Banana Crumb Cake, though.  Consistancy is more like cake. Having said that, you could serve this for breakfast, brunch or as a dessert as it goes really well with a cup of coffee. I made the recipe as directed in a bundt pan and it came out perfectly. Not your typical banana bread, but this one is a keeper for sure!!

Well, I read all of the reveiws saying it wasn't moist enough so I added some sour cream and now it is VERY moist. VERY good but almost too moist (if there can be such a thing). I will certainly make again but stick to the recipe sans sour cream.

I thought this turned out wonderful! I did add just a bit more banana, but it would've been fine without it. I also mixed in the nuts, cinnamon, and brown sugar instead of just having a layer. I will make this again!

I think this is an amazing recipe, thank you!  It was so good!  I find that I like to mix in the little crumb-filling stuff though, it spreads the flavours around better.

Pretty good.  Not the usual banana bread.  It's more like a cake.  Especially reminded me of a coffee cake with the cinnamon/pecan/brown sugar in the center.  I agree with other reviewers that it might be even better with the middle cinnamon part doubled.  It was kinda moist, but not really moist.  Maybe next time I'd add some applesauce or sour cream or something to it to make it really moist.  Worth making again, but maybe just with a few little changes.

This bread is sooo good! I have made it quite a few times with awesome results each time. A heavy, good, filling, deliciously rich bread. I double the pecan/sugar/cinnamon mix and use it in the middle of the bread and on top. I also use 3-4 bananas. It travels well, we slice it and take it to Disneyland in our snack bag. Never lasts more than a day or 2 in my house. A family favorite!

I was surprised at how light & fluffy this bread was.  I considered it more cake-like than bread.  The banana taste was not overpowering either.  I also doubled the pecan mix.

This recipe was FANTASTIC.  I only made a few slight modifications:  butter instead of margerine, about 1.5 cups of smashed banana, and no pecans.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and sugar--I put it between two layers of batter as suggested, then used a butter knife to swirl it around.  Also, the recipe made only 1 large loaf for me--but maybe I have big loaf pans.

Wow!!! Fab recipe! I, like other reviewers, added about 1 cup of extra banana. It turned out so moist and wonderful. I added chocolate chips instead of nuts, and then I iced it with Chocolate Cream Cheese icing. YUMMY! :)

This bread came out so good! I used 2 cups of bananas instead of 1 and I used whipped cream cheese. This bread came out extremely moist and heavy. The cinnamon and brown sugar in the middle gave it a yummy touch. Very good!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe and it always gets RAVE reviews!  I substitue dark brown sugar for the white sugar, halve the cinnamon and double the vanilla.  I bake in one 9x5 pan for at least an hour and 20 minutes.

This bread was wonderful!!  I only had 4 oz. cream cheese, so I added 1/2 C sour cream too.  Very moist, baked well ... was done in 45 minutes.  I baked my bread on the bottom shelf of the oven.

This recipe is so easy to follow... I made 2 loafs and left the cream cheese out on the second one and put the filling through out the whole mixture! They smelled and tasted wonderful! THANKS!!!

I've made this one several times & it never lasts more than a meal with my family! My only complaint is that it doesn't make more!

I tried this recipe because all of the great reviews but it was just okay, nothing special. I probably won't make it again.

I've tried a lot of recipes for banana bread, but I must say this is the best one that I've ever made - very moist and rich.  I love it.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe now. Don't be dissuaded by the pictures, mine was more browned on top and looked good enough to give as gifts. I used mini loaf pans and made 5 to give away. The cream cheese makes it moist and flavorful, not cheesy. I was very impressed! Thanks!

I love this recipe.  Thank you Pam for sharing.  I have made it several times since finding it and now my husband won't settle for any other banana bread.  I have shared the recipe with several friends who all love it.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

I loved this recipe. Looking at other reviews, I did add more banana than was called for. I also omitted the nuts because my husband doesn't like them, and in one load I added some chocolate chips to the cinnamon/sugar layer. Very yummy!!

I'll definitely make this again.

I had about 10 brown bananas to use so I doubled this recipe.  It made two loaves plus a dozen muffins.  The muffins were delicious because they each had a yummy brown sugar surprise inside!  This just may become my new favorite banana bread recipe!  Very moist.  I added cinnamon to the batter in addition to the filling.  Loved it!

This was my first time ever making banana bread, and I was nervous since my husband's Mom is famous for her recipe, but I was very happy with the way this turned out.    I took advice from other reviews and used 4 bananas. It had to cook it longer than 45 minutes, and the outside was a bit crumbly, but it was creamy and delicious! I loved it! I will definitely keep using this recipe. (and my husband had 3 pieces right out of the oven)

Excellent combination of flavors.  The addition of cream cheese is a definite plus.  I did not include nuts and it was fine.

there goes by diet. I made this for my son because he loves banana bread but my guess is he won't even get a sample. thanks so much- this is by far the best banana bread I've ever made. must be the cream cheese.

I want to give this more than 5 stars!  My little boy who never eats, loved this!!  I doubled the batch and made 24 mini muffins (15 minutes to cook), 14 regular muffins (25 minutes to cook), and a loaf of bread (50 minutes to cook).  The mini muffins were tough to make because this batter is very sticky.  THANK YOU for posting this recipe!!!

This recipe is a great spin on traditional banana bread.  I chose to mix the ingredients all together instead of layer the ingredients, and it turned out very moist and good. My family loved it so much that they beg me to buy overripe bananas! Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious, Delicious, Delicious! I can't say that enough to describe how this banana bread tasted. I would never have expected cream cheese to be in the recipe. But the bread tasted moist, light, and fluffy. Just the way I like it! I changed two things, though. One thing I changed was instead of using pecans I used walnuts. Another thing was I added the walnut, cinnamon, and brown sugar mixture to the batter. That was an accident because I read the instructions wrong, but it still came out great. It was odd though because the batter I put in the 8x4 loaf pan never really seemed to bake completely. I put the rest of the batter in another baking pan, and that baked fine. But, it was still great, and everyone loved it. Thanks for a teriffic recipe!

This is a beaut bread next time I will cook 1 only in a pan 9 x 5 as I found that BAKING 2 were a bit thin. Definately a keeper. Anyone in Australia packaged cream cheese is "PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE".

This was so tasty - even better the second day!  I used 6 oz of Neufatchel cheese, unsalted butter in place of margarine, and increased the bananas to 1 1/4 cups.  Turned out perfect!

I have to admit I was skeptical adding cinnamon to banana bread, I like a true banana flavor, but it was really good.  I took it to work and got raves.  This is definately a keeper!

I wish I could give this more than five stars, this turned out to be really good, I love the ribbon of brown sugar and nut mixture in the bread sooo good!!  I was a little leary about the cream cheese in the batter...but it turned out very well,it made the bread very moist.  My husband now prefers this version than the other banana bread recipe I use all the time that I discovered off this website.  Thanks!!

This is excellent. It is very smooth and is super moist even on the first day. It is more expensive to make than regular banana bread, but the texture is worth it if you need a dessert that day.

Very moist, but very cake like.  I agree with the others, not much banana taste & I used more than a cup of very ripe bananas.  Will stick with the recipe that calls for Sour Cream, it's more banana-y & still very moist.

I have looked long and hard for a steadfast banana bread recipe because mine always turned out too hard on the outside and uncooked in the middle.  This is the BEST BANANA BREAD I've ever had.  It cooks evenly and the consistency is light and creamy.  Absolutely fantastic!  So good that it only lasted a couple of hours the first time I made it and my family was begging for me to make more.

Seemed kind of bland. I'm not a fan of banana bread but liked it, although my son and husband who are fans did not. Seems like a lot of work for nothing too exciting.

Lighter in texture than traditional banana bread.  The banana flavor is not as strong, but very pretty with the layer of pecans and brown sugar/cinnamon running through the middle.

I made this recipe for my girlfriends family. Everyone loved it. I substituted the sugar with Splenda and it still came out excellent. The cream cheese is a nice touch. I am going to make it again really soon.

I did not care for this recipe.  But my husband really liked it.  The center was really gooey and the top was dark.  It really didnt have much flavor.  If your looking for a good banana bread recipe try the banana banana bread recipe on this site.  good luck!

I would call this recipe pound cake/banana bread. If you're looking for a very banana tasting, nutty, dark bread, this isn't it.  I loved the pecan "ribbon" baked in the middle, although it came out a little dry and I'll try to mix in a little butter into the pecan mixture the next time.  The cake itself, while not super banana-y, is delicious!

I made this recipe without nuts (my husband hates nuts!) and it did not have enough banana flavor, or the density that you usually think of with banana/pumpkin/zucchini bread. We certainly ate it, but it wasn't what we were expecting. We'll keep looking!

This was so delicious!  I always seem to have a problem with my banana breads not being cooked throughout, but this one came out perfect!  I used glazed pecans in the nut mixture, and it was fabulous!  I will be using this recipe from now on.

Very nice 'spin' on the standard banana bread recipies I've always used. Less banana-y and a bit elegant with the swirl of sugary nuts through the middle.

I thought the texture of this banana bread recipe was excellent -- it did not fall apart when slicing it like other recipies Ive tried. Also, when making banana bread I always use the quick bread method of mixing it and NOT the creaming method like this recipe calls for. Mix dry ingredients in one bowl and wet in another and then FOLD FOLD FOLD. The more delicately you mix the wet and dry ingredients together the more heighth you'll get. The batter should be chunky and mixed just until the flour disappears. Hope this helps! Also, some reviews had said to add more brown sugar -- Because I didnt have time and mixed everything into the batter at once the 2 extra T brown sugar I added was WAY TOO MUCH for my taste. My husband, on the other hand, said it was the best banana bread recipe he has ever had! ( but he always says that!haha )

Yummy! A hit with the teachers at school. I did make more of the cinnamon/brown sugar/pecan mix and bake it on top. That was very good.

Everyone always gives me hell for messing with traditional recipes, but no one could complain when they tried this bread.  It was a HIT.  I added more banana like others said. I also added a 1/2tsp of allspice and put half the cinnamon in the batter.  Turned out wonderful!

No, HOLLYMAMA, you are not alone! I made this bread, and I had enough batter for one large loaf, plus 3 muffins. My bread rose beautifully also, only to shrink. The bread was very moist as stated, but also VERY bland...hardly any banana taste at all, and I used 4 very ripe bananas. Sorry to say...this is not worth the fat and calories either. I will stick to my favorite; Whole Wheat Banana Nut Bread, found on this site. Thanks for sharing though Pam :0)

Wonderful recipe!  I love how moist this bread turned out.  I omitted the nuts and used a light cream cheese and baked it in a 5x9 inch bread pan (that's the only size I had) for roughly 50 minutes.  It would be very good with raisins.

We love this quick bread!  Living in Haiti means we have lots of bananas, and often they become over ripe before we can eat them all.  I made only two changes to this recipe: I doubled the brown sugar in the streusel and I used four bananas.  This recipe made four mini loaves.  I will use this recipe often, especially when serving a light breakfast to guests.

Very good banana bread.  For extra moist recipe, I used vanilla yogurt instead of the cream cheese.  This went very well with the cinammon sugar topping and made it very moist indeed.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted in my life! I have a recipe similar to this one, packed-away,so I tried this one, and this one is much better than even the one I had. Super moist. The only alteration I made was not adding the nuts, because we do not care for nuts in things, and just added more brown sugar and the required cinnamon, and it was perfect. Excellent recipe, and I highly recommend it.

Very good. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used 2 c. of bannana and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. When the bread came out it sank a lot, but was really tasty. You definately need to allow some time for the bread to cool before slicing it.

I baked this wonderful banana bread this afternoon and we love it.  I used a reader's idea to use a bundt pan instead of loaf pans, and it worked out great. I highly recommend this recipe to banana bread lovers everywhere.

Good but not great. It was a novelty to try. We like the traditional gooey, even more moist banana bread.

Mmmmmm! This was delicious. One of the best banana breads I've ever had. I did need to cook about 15 minutes longer than called for. But they came out perfect! I will be making this one again.

This recipe is outrageous.  It is much better than the banana bread recipe that calls for sour cream.  It is moist and very light.  This will be the only banana bread recipe I ever use.  No changes, perfect the way it is.

We loved this!!  One loaf was gone in one day.  I skipped the cinnamon and nuts and added chocolate chips.  I also cooked for ten minutes longer.  This is really one of the best recipes I have ever made for banana bread.

I was trying to find a banana bread recipe to rival my grandmother's and this is it SOO tasty!!  I used walnuts instead of pecans and i think next time I might use a little more brown sugar in the middle, but it was fantastic anyway!

I have been searching for a yummy banana bread recipe for years and finally I have found it!!!! I tend to like things sweet, so I added a TBS of brown sugar to the nut mixture, but both ways are delicious.  I tell everyone that I have the best banana bread recipe in the world now.  Thanks Pam!!!

Tihs is really delicious - very different from the usual banana bread.  Creamy is a very accurate description.  I will make this recipe again often. Since the recipe makes two loaves, I made one loaf with the nuts and the other without nuts and just sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture on top.  Both ways, it is delicious!

Best I've ever made. Didn't have 2 loaf pans so put all mixture into bundt pan and it turned out great. Cooked same amount of time (45 min.) Drizzled icing over top. Looked and tasted good.

This is my second review on this B.B.  After reading other reviews I decided to try it again and follower the recipe.  The first time I used more banana and flour and it did not turn out well.  This time it was fine,but I think I will mix in the nuts next time instead of putting in the middle.

Loved this, so soft and delicious! Not too dense, and not too fluffy. I added a tsp of salt, cut white sugar down to 1/2 cup, and used 4 med bananas. for the Cinnamon sugar mix, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3+ tsp Cinnamon, and 1 cup chopped pecans. I then layered the bread batter - 3 layers, and Cinnamon sugar mix - 2 layers between the 3 batter layers. I baked about 45-50 minutes at 350.

My daughters favorite. She requires that I make it at least once every fall. We replace the vanilla with almond extract. She loves it so much that I make extra to store in the freezer for her to have throughout winter.

Excellent recipe! I made this in a 4 mini loaf pan with the hopes of freezing some for the kids lunches. The bread just came out of the oven and 2 loaves are gone. So much for freezing some. Definitely will make this again. I recommend swirling the cinnamon and sugar mixture throughout the bread instead of layering it on top.

Best banana bread I’ve ever made!  I’m sure it’s wonderful just as it’s written but I did make a couple of changes.  I added a large spoonful of molasses and an extra cup of banana to the batter and I omitted the pecans from the cinnamon sugar filling (simply because I had no pecans on hand) and it was the best banana bread I’ve ever eaten!

As good, and as easy, as everyone says.  I did add a small can of crushed pineapple, when I added the bananas.  It enhanced the flavor, but did not overwhelm, or mask the 3-banana flavor.  I will definitely be making this again. Yum.

Wonderful!  Took others' advice & used 3 eggs, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 3/4 tsp baking powder, 2 cups mashed bananas, 1/4 cup of dark rum, used walnuts instead of pecans (mixed in with batter, not separate on top of loaf), and added nutmeg.  Also used up to 1/2 cup of coconut milk. Very moist!

This is by far my favorite recipe for banana bread. I have found that some bananas aren’t very flavorful so I always add a teaspoon of banana extract.

This is a very moist and flavorful bread.  The pecans which I candied ahead of time made a nice crunch to the center.  I recommend layering them on the final step before baking.  Also, I used a little banana extract, very ripe bananas and mascarpone cheese instead.  I will definitely make this again!

It came out sooo good! Everyone loved it, even my mother-in-law. She came back for seconds! Two changes I made though were, I changed the sugar to only 3/4 of brown sugar and I mashed 6 bananas for more banana flavor.

Very good!!! I only did 2 things different :

1) used 4 TBSP brown sugar
2) used about 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas 

Started checking at 30 min and ended up baking about 45-48 min. Moist and delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly even though it seemed like it did not have enough liquid. Batter was very thick and hard to spread in pan.  It did not rise right, and was dense like coffee cake. Fortunately, it tasted fine, so we did eat it. Won't make it again.

The only change I made was I divided the crumb filling between the filling and the top of the bread. So moist! Will definitely make again. The only think I would change is to reduce by at least half the crumb filling. Only because - for me and my taste - the cinnamon over-powered the banana.

This has been my go to recipe for several years now. When it comes to the strudel I double it and do the middle and the top of the loaf.  Also when I am out of pecans I will substitute walnuts.  
FYI  I just made pumpkin bread using this recipe trading 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin instead of bananas.  I also added 2 tbsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the bread and of course doubled the strudel.  It took an extra 5 mins to cook and was extremely moist.  This will be my go to pumpkin bread recipe from now on.

Forgive me Pam Hall but this is the the driest banana bread I’ve ever made before.  Nobody in my family wanted a second piece.  I only tried this recipe because it had cream cheese and I really like cream cheese.  The addition of cream cheese didn’t help this recipe.  I won’t use this recipe again.

I’ve tried this recipe twice now.. exactly as instructed, and the middle of the loaf ends up raw and caves in....even when given more time in the oven.

My go to recipe, although I just add the cinnamon and brown sugar right into the batter and leave out the pecans. It's great both ways, but my kids don't like the nuts.

Very moist, tender, and yummy!! That said, I did not add the but part, though I did add cinnamon to the batter. In lieu of the nuts, I added a streusel top made with 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 flour and cinnamon to taste (I added at least 1 Tbsp), and I cut in 2 Tbsp of cold butter.  

Next time, I will use 3 bananas instead of 2 (I only had 2 at the time), and I will cut the white sugar down to 1 c, since the topping added extra sweetness (as will an additional banana).

This is my favorite banana bread recipe. My mother-in-law loves it too and she doesn’t like cream cheese at all. I like to make muffins but sprinkle the mixture as a topping. Super yummy!!

This is the best banana bread recipe I’ve ever tried and I’ve tried many.  It was the perfect recipe to use with my Pampered Chef Mini Bundt Pan.  It’s a hit at home with my family and at work with my co-workers

Delicious! Like others, I added an extra banana. I omitted the cinnamon swirl event...not my thing. Baked at 350 for 45’ and came out perfect. Texture of a cake. Love it. Not heavy and compact like bread. I did use parchment paper to line pan. Easy lift out after baking. Cools in the paper. This batch makes two loaves. Re-line with more paper and pop in oven. Easy, easy and so very, very moist ??

Very dry and stale.  I think this recipe needs some oil or buttermilk. I don't understand the all the good reviews. I followed the recipe perfectly. Now I have two loaves that no one will eat.

Using this recipe, my banana bread has become "world famous". The only thing I change is I double the entire recipe because it's so popular and freezes very well. And, I add a bit of nutmeg and add copious amounts of brown sugar and cinnamon for the swirl

This is my go to for banana bread, it's so moist and richly delicious. Admittedly I don't measure out the bananas, just mash whatever over-ripe ones I have and I sub walnuts for the pecans.

This is my 1st time making  banana bread! I saw cheesecake as an ingredient, and was immediately excited to try. While I was making the batter, I was concerned that it wouldn't be sweet enough when I kept tasting it. I had to remember that it was bread not cake lol! I followed the recipe exactly. I added an 1/8 cup of chocolate chips with the pecan mixture for added interest. I will do this way again. I will make a cream cheese frosting next time. Oh this is lovely with milk or coffee! YUMM!

Oh my this banana bread is delicious!! It was a genus move and I commend thee creater of this banana bread recipe who was inspired  to add cream cheese to this banana bread recipe. 
I had to make a few adjustments to make this banana bread gluten free by using 1 1/4 cups of Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour,and 1/2 cup of coconut flour and the other half cup of finely ground almond flour,plus 1 teaspoon of Xanthan Gum powder to thicken the batter for baking. I forgot to mix the brown sugar and pecans to mix in the middle of the bread before baking ,so I added the chopped pecans on the top of the banana bread loaf,and left out nuts on the 2nd bread loaf. This banana bread made two nice sized loaves, that I took one loaf to work,and the one loaf with nuts for us to enjoy with a cup of coffee. I used half sugar,and half organic coconut sugar,and by mistake put the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar mixed into the banana mixture.  Even with those mistakes,my banana bread had a nice carmelized texture,color and tasted exquisite! This moist and flavorful banana bread will be our new found favorite.

Love this, it is delicious, just finished cooling and my youngest already came back for seconds!  

I did mess up the middle layer putting to close to the top and didn't  have enough nuts, but it's still good, but definitely will get more nuts for next time. 

Oh and I used butter because we don't eat margarine here.
 Also I hate had an issue with my zucchini bread recently so i adjusted the cooking temp/time in hopes to avoid that issue with this and it worked out perfect.  I cooked it at 325 for 1 hour.

Loved it.  This is now my new Banana bread recipe.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and added a few chocolate chips.  Also used 3 bananas.   I usually freeze extra bananas and then defrost before using in recipes.   They really add a lot of liquid to the recipe then.  Very moist.

I make this bread. I use walnuts instead of pecans, just personal preference. I was out of butter once and substituted butter flavor Crisco, liked the flavor and texture better. 

This bread tends to be a little dry. (Probably why I liked it better with Crisco) The recipe makes two loaves, so unless I freeze one, I end up throwing the other one out, because it dries out fast.

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I made it and both loaves were gone in one day!!! — Tip: I layered both loaves with the cinnamon mixture twice, and then once on the top, but I also sprinkled semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top to give it more flavor (I doubled the ingredients for the cinnamon mixture). Also I used 3 large bananas instead of 1 cup of mashed bananas (3 large bananas are over 1 cup). And I substituted the pecans for walnuts, which, I'm sure, tasted just as great as pecans would have. — Overall, this is a really great recipe for banana bread! I love the cream cheese that is added into the bread, it really made the bread more moist and added more flavor to the bread. Definitely using this recipe again!

We loved this.  Makes two beautiful loaves that are delicious.  Gave one, while it was still warm, to our friends. Made a couple alterations that only made it slightly healthier but didn't change the taste.  Used Truvia white sugar and brown sugar to replace regular sugar. Of course, when substituting with Truvia, you cut the measurement in half.   Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Used 3 bananas - didn't even measure that.

Added cinnamon to the bread a little extra vanilla and folded in chocolate chips instead of the nut mixture. It was delicious but plan on trying with the nut mixture next time!

OMG I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
I will totally make this again. My whole family loves it and it is super easy to make. I didn't do one layer of the brown sugar, pecan, cinnamon stuff though. I did two and one on top that turned into a "glaze" so to speak. I love it!

I used organic coconut flour as I cannot have gluten.  The taste was good, but a bit dry.  I'd like more bananas as well.  It also adds moisture.  If I try this again that's what I'll do.
I'm going to let it set over night to see if it will allow the cooling process to make a difference.

I added the brown sugar and cinnamon to the mix instead of layering it. Delicious! (allergy to nuts so they were omitted)  The bread was more pale than what we are uses too but once we tastes it we fell in love. Thanks for the great recipe.

Oh my word!! This is amazing!! I tweaked it a little by using pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon in the streusel and in addition to adding the streusel to the center, I also added the leftover to the top of each loaf. I also used closer to 2 cups of mashed bananas as well, which made the dough a bit stickier but made a great flavor in the finished product. It was perfect in 45 minutes!! This is now my new go to recipe for banana bread!

I was skeptical, but it was great.

I added an extra banana because I had a bunch to use up :)

3 ripe bananas was not enough, I recommend 4.  Added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice based on other reviews to add some flavour and it was wonderful. The pecans worked perfectly except next time I would simply add pecans into the batter and use the sugar/nut mix on top. Will make again!

My son loves this recipe! I'm  not a big fan of bread but this is delicious.  I add three ripe bananas and omit the toppings since my son doesn't like nuts.  I use this recipe to make my banana rum nut muffins for me. ;-)

This is a great recipe for moist banana bread.  I too, mashed 3 bananas (approx 1 1/2 cups) and I added 1 tsp salt, which helped bring out the flavor.

This is our favorite banana bread!  Not a heavy, dense bread but more light and creamy.  We actually like it better without the nut mixture.  Makes it even lighter and you get the most banana flavor.

This bread was ok, nothing special. The banana flavor was very mild even though my bananas were very brown. The moistness was average and it did crumble when slicing. I will not be making this recipe again.

Made this for a coffee morning and it was well received.  I read some of the reviews and made the following changes - six small bananas, doubled the filling and cut 3 T butter in to make it crumbly, and added some cinnamon to the batter. I also used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I had some salted pecans that I chopped up and that bit of saltiness with the brown sugar really worked for me in the filling and on top.

I had a big tub of cream cheese to use up so thought I would try this recipe. It was just okay for me. It doesn't have a very banana taste (so maybe add some banana extract if you want more, but I won't make it again. I skipped the pecan mixture - maybe that adds the finishing touch. It was good, but I'll stick with my tried and true banana bread recipe instead.

This bread was gone in no time...both loaves in just a couple of days.  Planning to make again this week!  The only thing I did differently was not add pecans because I don't care for them.

I loved it! I did alter it a bit to make it a little more healthy. I used 1/4 c apple sauce & 1/4 c light smart balance instead of margarine, Neuchatel instead of cream cheese and 1/2 c & 2 T truvia instead of sugar. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla because I love the flavor it adds.

Unbelievably good! I also added 1/2 cup of blueberries on top of the cinnamon mixture because we love blueberries. I WILL make this again. (Note- it's not quite as sweet as some banana breads so I might add another 1/4 cup of sugar next time- but that is definitely personal preference.) YUM!!!

This is, by far, the best recipe I have found for banana bread. It is so moist & yummy I definitely consider this dessert worthy all on it's own! The only thing I did different was added more banana (because I love them) and I increased the cinnamon, added a dash of all spice both in the batter & into the pecan mixture. Love it! Thanks Pam!!!!

Awesome! And easy. This was my first time making banana bread (or any bread) and it turned out awesome. I used 3 large bananas and used half brown sugar, half white sugar. I also skipped the pecan filler in one loaf and added dark chocolate chips to the mix, and sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top. Completely and totally delicious.

I also added three riped bananas instead of cup. I have never used cream cheese in banana bread and must admit it was great. I also love the fact the banana bread was not heavy but light n fluffy. Thanks

THE best banana bread recipe I have ever made!!  I LOVED the added flavor and "depth" that the sour cream adds, and using the sugar/cinnamon mixture to coat the pan adds SO much!  My family absolutely LOVED it.  I have never heard them rave so much about my banana bread.  Now that I have found this recipe, I think I can toss all the others!  --ShellGram

I t was very good, but I had to give it only 3 stars because I was looking for a much stronger banana flavor in my banana bread.  The extras in this drown out some of the banana flavor.  It is a very moist and sweet bread though.  Still worth making.

Have made this recipe twice now and both times made different adjustments. The 1st being I was a bit short on the cream cheese so I subbed sour cream for about 1/4 of it. I also ended up adding sour cream to the 2nd batch once the batter was mixed as it was a bit too thick, i added approx 1/4 cup. I, along with several other reviewers, also added more bananas. I went with 5, yes, 5 full bananas both batches. The result was a VERY flavorful bread. I went with 3 eggs instead of two for both batches as well. I added about 1/4 cup more flour to compensate. I pretty much just eye-balled it and taste tested it, adding a bit more flour until the consistency was perfect. I added nutmeg and just a dash of all spice to the batter, again, just kept taste testing small amounts until I had it just right.  I also only did one loaf with the pecan cinnamon mixture. The second loaf I mixed in pomegranate juice infused craisins, and then this last batch I added mini chocolate chips to that loaf. I'd estimate I used about 1/2 cup of each. Bear in mind the amount of batter I had was quite a bit more than the original recipe will yield. I will go ahead and toot my own horn and say both loaves were hands down the best banana bread I've ever made or eaten and all family and friends agree. Thank you for this recipe. It's perfect for adding your own personal touches to and I have more ideas for the next batch! I'll try and add pictures next time as they were eaten within minutes of emerging.

The cream cheese makes this bread AMAZING!! I have made this bread for years and it always gets the crowd pleased.  However, I was looking for something "new" to do to it and came across the addition of cream cheese...not sure I will ever go back to making this bread without it!!  LOVE IT!!

Nice flavor, but dry and crumbly.  I was expecting a moist bread. I substituted wheat flour for about a fourth of the all purpose flour, so this may have caused the dryness ... I don't know.

My husband says this rivals his mother's recipe (one that uses mayonnaise to keep it moist), and I tend to agree.  For a fuller flavor I subbed 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole wheat, and 1/4 cup flax for the stated amount of flour.  Also, I poured the whole batter into one 5x9 pan instead of two 4x8s, and it turned out great with just a bit more time and a slightly lower temp than the recipe stated.  (I always have issues turning quick bread out of pans, so I put parchment on the bottom of the pan then greased the sides, and it turned out nicely).

I made this because I not only had bananas that needed to be used up but some cream cheese as well. So glad I did! I was quite impressed with this. Especially with how moist and fluffy it was. It was like biting into a banana flavoured cinnamon entwined cloud. I reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and used walnuts instead. Came out plenty sweet for me and I'll continue to make it that way. Then I baked them in mini loaf pans since I had in mind of giving some away. Didn't happen! I didn't find it bland as some others had complained about. Just light and delicious. If you're looking for a mega flavoured banana bread I would suggest the "Banana Banana Bread" found on this site. My bananas could have been a bit riper so at first I was a bit uneasy about making this but I was already in the process. Still came out great. Remember, when you're making banana bread make sure your bananas are super ripe. So ripe that the house reeks of bananas and guests ask if you have a pet monkey! Also be sure to beat everything very well. This is important to making fluffy baked goods. Do not underestimate that!

Made this for home and work. Everyone loves it! Very moist. I made more of a swirl w/ the brown sugar and cinnamon- as I poured too much batter in for the first pour. The baking time was exactly right. Will definitely make again and again!

I've tried several different banana nut bread recipes and am always on the lookout for something new.  This sounded interesting, and the reviews were encouraging.  Maybe it was my baking "talents" (or lack thereof!!) but I wasn't wowed like I had hoped to be.  Probably won't make again.

This bread is delicious! I added an extra banana, 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, cinnamon & a handful of dark chocolate chips...yum! I also substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour. Nice change to our usual banana bread.

Makes excellent banana bread.  I used 2 cups mashed bananas (~2 medium bananas) instead of just one, added 2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter, used walnuts instead of pecans, and baked in a 9x13. By trial and error, I have found that the bread has the best consistancy when the dry ingredients are mixed in by stirring with wooden spoon.

A very good banana bread and the cinnamon line adds just that extra something special!  I did, however, take a lot of previous reviewers advice and added more bananas - probably triple the amount!

We didn't care for this - disliked the texture and the stripe of brown sugar/cinnamon through the middle.  Seemed like kind of a waste of a package of cream cheese since it didn't do anything to improve the recipe as far as I was concerned.

I think this is a great recipe. I did add some cinnamon to the batter. I did not put nuts in it because my husband does not like them, but I made a butter, brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and put in clumps on top.....This was insanely good.  I will make again and again! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Awesome!  I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to the batter to add flavor.  I also doubled the brown sugar and added nutmeg and allspice for the filling.

Great recipe....I did make this in one regular sized loaf pan....and yes it was huge....but delicious....I also put half of the nut/sugar/cinnamon filling in the middle and the other half on top of the banana bread.  Thanks!

the layering of the mixture in the middle is awesome. I subbed in some healthier choices like:  whole wheat flour for all-purpose carton egg product for eggs non-fat yogurt for margarine(I'm going to try applesauce today) hazlenuts for pecans (not necessarily healthier, but nice) 5/6 cup agave nectar for white sugar FF cream cheese for regular  additionally, per other reviews, I used 3 bananas, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and a bit more cinnamon and vanilla. I also added a dash of ginger and nutmeg. Overall great recipe.

THANK YOU allrecipes for making this the recipe of the yesterday. I made it last night & it's all gone, so I am making it again today. Beats my old recipe & it really is creamy.  Replaced the margarine w/applesauce as suggested by others & I used a mix of different nuts b/c that was all I had. I am throwing my old recipe out!

I reduced the fat in this recipe by substituting 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for a 1/4 cup of butter.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and skipped the nuts.  I didn't have 2 loaf pans so I baked in a 13 x 9 pan for 25 minutes. Very moist.

This is probably the best banana bread recipe I've made and I've made at least 10 different recipes (most from this site).  I was so excited to be able to use the package of cream cheese I've had left from the holidays, as well as a couple overripe bananas I had (keep them in a bag in a freezer).  I sub'd applesauce for half the margarine, used only 1 c of white sugar, and left out the nuts.  I was scared I didn't have enough for two loaves but it worked out.  After 45 mins mine was still not completely cooked, so I put it in for another 8 minutes and it was perfect.  I've had just 1 slice so far but I know my husband is going to love the light texture and cinnamon and brown sugar surprise in the middle!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This recipe is amazing!!  I was looking for something quick for my husband to take to work in the mornings - and this is PERFECT.  I didn't measure the bananas, and added about 1/4 cup of sour cream, because I didn't have enough cream cheese... added some of the center mixture to the actual top of it...and it was PERFECT!!  Will definately be sending this to my friends & family!

Oh, yum.  I love this recipe.  I didn't make the brown sugar filling or use the pecans, but the bread is just scrumptious and moist as is, light in color.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt with the dry ingredients, a cup of chocolate chips, and topped it off with turbinado sugar, which gave it a nice caramel color on top and a crisp sugar crust. I split my batter between two bread pans and baked for 45 minutes and they came out beautifully.

This is be best banana bread recipe I ever had.  Thanks Pam!!!  The cream cheese really makes a difference.  I've made it twice now, and got rave reviews both times.  The first time I made it I didn't change a thing.  The pecans kept falling off the top of the slices, but it was still yummy.  This time I did something slightly different.  I make 1 loaf, 6 muffins and 24 mini muffins.  I added half the batter to the loaf pan, and the muffin pans.  The mini muffins just filled.  I added 2 T. melted butter to the nut mixture so it would be a little moist.  The mini muffins had the nuts on top but the muffins and loaf had the nuts in the middle.  Turned out great!  It's like a nice surprize inside.  (Just like to photo is right now.)

I'm not a big fan of banana bread, but gave this a shot. It turned out great.  I used a larger bread pan and had to cook it a bit longer than 45 minutes.  It was a hit at the office.

I'm about to start letting my bananas over ripen just for an excuse to make this bread more often! I left out the nuts and added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar to the filling, also added a tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and a bit of extra vanilla to the wet ingredients, and then sprinkled a bit if the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture on the tops before baking. I always use mini loaf pans, so this recipe is a little bit too much batter for my 3 minis, it made 3 muffins too, which turned out great! Next time I might ditch the loaves all together and just make muffins!

This is a wonderful recipe. My whole family loves it. I usually don't care much for banana bread but i could eat my self into oblivion with this recipe! My mother-in-law gave me compliments on it. We all know how rare it is to get compliments from the mother-in-law! I am making it tonight again along with homemade ice cream. A Texas treat for the weekend!

i used whole wheat flour - i omitted the nuts, brown sugar and cinnamon because my husband hates nuts - i will try this recipe again replacing the nuts with raisins instead - i was worried that the bread would come out dry or have a wierd texture since i used whole wheat flour - but it came out tasty and moist and my husband loved it

This was great banana bread.  I used 5 bananas & added cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice as mentioned above.  I also used walnuts with 1/4 cup brown sugar because I didnt't have any pecans.  Definately a keeper!

I have gotten a ton great compliments on this, I have to say though I have skipped the pecan mixture in the past out of laziness but will get to it next time.

Can you say YUM!  Both my husband and I love this bread.  I used sliced almonds instead of the pecans and added a little extra vanilla and mashed bananas.  This bread doesn't have a real strong banana flavor to it.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times now. I use some wheat flower and some brown sugar to substitute for some white flower and white sugar. Next time I'm going to try to sub some honey instead of the white sugar.

Delicate but full of flavor; smooth, moist and delicious, this banana bread is the tops.  I too, was wary of how thick the batter was, but once I tasted it, my fears were put to rest.  I didn't use an electric mixer, but it may have been helpful.  Make sure that you have enough to cover two loaves at the end.  I almost didn't have enough!

This is a good basic recipe. Try a little taste-test before it goes in the oven, so if it's not quite to your satisfaction, you can add more spice/banana.  Do try coating the greased pan with the sugar spice combination as per video. Works so well and the taste is wonderful.

I have made this bread countless times. It is my favorite as far as banana bread goes (minus the nuts). And whenever I make it, everyone gobbles it up quickly. Excellent recipe!

Great recipe.  Instead of putting the cinnamon/sugar/pecan mixture inside, I sprinkle it on top of the batter and pat it down with a spoon. I also add a little more banana.

Perfect! I've tried other banana bread recipes and this is by far the BEST.  However, I did make one change on the cream cheese.  I didn't have the original but what I did have was cinnamon swirl so I used that.  I'm not sure if this is why it was so good but we are all sold on this recipe.  I will definitely make this from now on.

Was okay, but not something I'd go out of my way to make again.  While it's edible, it doesn't have the 'wow' factor for me. It is pretty, though! Thanks for letting me try.

I made this every couple weeks to send to my husband in Iraq - it was a big hit! I always add a top cinnamon layer, which adds a little extra something.

Wow! Wonderful bread! I made it a bundt cake instead and it was incredible. I used 6 frozen(then thawed)bananas. I added a little banana extract too. I was perfect. Moist and dense. Hubby loved it!

This recipe was great! I tweaked it a little by combining some of the previous comments made. I added an extra banana, so overall I use 2 medium bananas. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the BATTER in addition to using it in the pecan mixture.
I make the bread in mini-loaf forms, baking them for 20 minutes. Turns out delicious!

Great Banana Bread!! I cut the recipe down to 10 servings only because I only had 2 very ripe bananas. I did double the recipe for the pecan/brown sugar/cinnimon topping. I swirled it into the mixture and baked it as directed, then topped it with banana liquor. This made an awesome dessert with vanilla ice cream.

Easy to put together, I will make thia again and again!

This is absolutely the best banana bread recipe ever.  The only thing I did different was not putting the pecans, sugar and cinammon in the middle.  In my house this bread is gone within 2 days.

I absolutely love this recipe! The first time that I attempted to make banana bread I made three batches using different recipes and of all of them, this one was by far the favorite of all my family and friends. I have recieved nothing but compliments and requests for this bread and it is easy to multiply for very large batches; I never make less than two batches at once. This recipe is perfect the way it is, but it is also a great recipe to play with. Sometimes I add mini chocolate chips to the batter and it turns this amazingly moist bread into a dessert.

Tasted good, but didn't rise.  I don't think I have ever made banana bread that was this moist.

I did not love this recipe.  I added an extra 1/2 cup mashed banana, and it still did not have enough banana flavor.  Also, the layer of cinnamon, brown sugar and pecans was good, but the rest of the bread simply did not have enough spice or flavor.

I agree with another "reviewer" who said the Banana Sour Cream Bread on this site is by far the best Banana Bread.

This recipe is amazing!  Definitely my favorite banana bread!  I love the cinnamon and brown sugar center and the topping - the only thing I'd add to the recipe is a little shredded coconut on top.  And the texture of this bread is perfect!  I've made a lot of banana bread and this is my favorite by far!!

It tasted good and all, but wasn't at all moist like the preview proclaims.  Not very dense like banana bread should be either.  I guess I'm going to have to just call my mom for her recipe, LOL!

This was an awesome treat! My husband doesn't like nuts, so I leave them out of one of the loaves, then we both can be happy!  I also double the Brown Sugar and Cinnamon mix, makes it a little more moist and sweet! I make this Banana Bread often and it will always be the best! Thanks

I make about 100 mini loaves of bread for my husband's employees every year. I added this recipe to my holiday bundle 2 years ago and had nothing but rave reviews. I make some with the pecans and without! No matter which way, however, everyone who recieves it comments on how moist this bread is!

I made this bread without the pecans, and used 2 1/2 bananas, and it was great!  Very moist and tasty.  I will make it again (as soon as I have over ripe bananas)!  My son suggested a cream cheese frosting to go with it next time I make it.

Excellent!  Very very good.  I didn't have any pecans, so I followed some others advice and added a handful of chocolate chips with the brown sugar and cinnamon- it was great!  Next time I'll make sure that I have pecans and I'll still add the chocolate chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Like usual I had to change something so I took the recommendation of one reviewer and added the extra banana, substituted pecans with walnuts (had then on hand) made about double the mix and added  half  
directly to the mix and sprinkled the rest on top, also drizzled some honey over the top just because I had some near where I was making the bread! Came out very good.

Absolutely wonderful. I did take it out after fifty minutes even though my knife didn't come out clean when I inserted it. I just left it wrapped tightly in a dishtowel   and it finished cooking perfectly in the middle without getting overdone on the sides.

WOW!EXCELLENT RECIPE.I MADE CHANGES AS I ALWAYS DO. I HALVED THE RECIPE USING 1/2 C BUTTER, 6OZ OF CREAM CHEESE, BROWN SUGAR AND 3 BANANAS. I STIRRED IN CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND CHOPPED PECANS AFTER BEATING IN THE FLOUR MIXTURE. I JUST PULLED IT OUT OF THE OVEN AND IT IS HEAVENLY! MY KIDS CAN'T GET ENOUGH AND NEITHER CAN I! NEXT TIME I'LL USE SMARTBALANCE AND LET Y'ALL KNOW HOW THAT TURNS OUT. GOD BLESS!

I absolutely loved it. I didn't actually bake it myself - a friend brought it in to work and well, let's just say it didn't take long 'til it was gone.  It's so moist and every bite yells yummy banana - the fact that there's cream cheese and a wonderful struesel mixture in the middle is BONUS!!!  I have already printed out the recipe and am ready to bake up some loaves.....

This was just ok for me, nothing spectacular. I used more bananas than called for. Was hoping for more of a "wow" factor.

Great banana bread recipe. Made just as stated only I omitted the nuts cause I didn't have any on hand. I also decided to add a strudel topping which added a sweet crunch to the top (mixture of sugar, cinnamon, butter and flour).

Excellent recipe!  Mine came moist, but a bit crispy on the outside.  I may skip the topping since my family enjoys the softness of bread better.

The most moist banana bread I've ever had! Cream cheese is a great addition. I left out the nuts though. Not my favorite nut.

This was a different spin on banana bread. Very moist! great way to use up bananas. The only things i changed was using three bananas and i put cinnamon in the batter,just a pinch.

Very good bread, although the banana taste wasn't quite as strong.  But it was certainly moist and soft.  Love the pecan and cinnimon in the center.  Thanks!

Very moist and tasty, nice addition to banana bread with the cream cheese. Used unsalted butter instead of margarine, no nuts and used 4 very ripe banana's I had in the freezer, threw in a handfull of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Will definitely make again.

A very nicely textured coffee cake, thanks to the cream cheese, but not nearly banana-y enough for us. Instead of nuts, I used orange-flavored dried cranberries in one loaf and chocolate chips in the other. A shame about the flavor, because I had extra mashed banana I could have used up.

This turned out well, though not stupendous enough to take the place of my other banana bread recipes. It is somewhat unique though, so I may make it again. My husband loved it and devoured most of the loaf but then he had skipped lunch so was very hungry. I confess that I did accidentally double the bananas and the vanilla, which I'm sure made the end result more banana-ey, but I'm rating it anyway since it wasn't THAT big of a change...

Absolutely the best banana bread I've ever had. I didn't have any pecans so I made one with walnuts and one with mini choc chips. Both are fantastic. I knew it was good when I couldn't stop eating the batter!!!

Fantastic recipe!  I had to halve it since I only had 1/2 cup of mashed banana, but it worked perfectly.  Since I forgot to put the brown sugar in the middle, I put some on top before baking - YUM!  I will probably continue to do that even when I remember the inside layer.  This is a fantastic recipe and is probably the closest I've found (taste) to my grandma's recipe which I lost years ago! Thank you!

I really liked this bread, although I would say it is a little more cake like, but it was so very moist and yummy that it will be going into my recipe box. The topping was just okay; I think I may try the topping from the Banana Crumb Muffins recipe  next time with this bread, as I like that one much better (with the addition of some nuts, of course).

By far the best banana bread that I have found! I made one change though, I  put the pecan chips, brown sugar and cinnamon in the batter before I added the bananas and flour instead of just putting it on top of the bread. Adds a little sweetness throughout!

Hands down the best Banana Bread I have ever tasted!  I did not have any pecans, so I left them out.  I also used half Splenda, half Sugar.  It is most and delicious and the cinnamon/brown sugar in the middle adds an extra scrumptious touch.  Will make it again and again.

I had never made banana bread before and I tried making this one and it came out perfect. I read a reviw that said the cinnanin centre was too much cinnamin and it broke back memories of an apple pie I once made with too much cinnamin, so I didnt put in as much as the recipe called for. HOWEVER, It could have used more cinnamin, so next time I will follow the recipe exactly. I made it and took it to a dinner and everyone loved it. Since I never made it before, please take the following into consideration: As a child I never liked banada bread because of the "little black stringy looking" things in it. I am not sure if this one didnt have those because my bananas were not rotten, or this recipe just made a lighter color bread. either way, Ill be making it again! Yummy!!!

I never review recipes, but I have to speak out for this one: this banana bread is so good you will want to CRY when it's gone!  It is rich, nutty, PERFECT!  The only change I make is to layer the cinnamon/pecan/brown sugar mixture through the bread twice, and then I sprinkle the leftovers on the top.  A+!

The cream cheese is the "secret weapon" to ensure that the banana bread stays very soft and moist. So very good!!!!! Instead of making a bread loaf, I made muffins to take to my son's preschool holiday party. I knew the muffins were a huge hit when most of the children passed up the store bought cookies and brownies for my homemade banana muffins!!!! Thanks 4 a great recipe!!!

This is absolutely the best banana bread I have tasted in my life. The only thing I did different (and it wasn't on purpose) is that I mixed the pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon in the batter. I added the pecans before I read the rest of the directions so I decided to just mix it all in. Very yummy. I don't think I will make it any other way!!!!

It was good, and certainly creamy, but I prefer more of the banana flavor (I used 3 very ripe bananas) you get in a heavier, more traditional banana bread.  For my 3 bananas, I think I prefer the "Banana Muffins II" recipe. I did freeze one of the loaves, and it defrosted very nicely, tasted just like the fresh one did.

Boy, the batter tasted great, the finished product...not so great.  The banana flavor is very light.  I really think this should be baked in a single pan, instead of divided between two.  I would prefer one large loaf.  My husband, who is a banana bread fanatic, said it was "okay."  My reaction also.  I have other recipes we prefer over this one.

This was the absolute best banana bread i have ever had!  It was completely moist and pecans with the brown sugar really made it different.  My roommates went out and got more bananas so i could make it again and they took it to work.  Lots of compliments!

This was good not great. It was a bit bland for me not a lot of flavor of any kind. I like a more intense banana taste and it wasn't there. Sry.

I overcooked this just slightly and it was still moist and it was still very good!  Not to sweet, just right bread!  My kids were my guinea pigs and they both loved it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a pretty good banana bread.  Not my favorite, but good.  I followed the directions exactly and it looked beautiful.  This went well with a cup of coffee in the morning.  I made it while my in-laws were visiting and they enjoyed it also.  Thanks!

This was good;  tastes almost like banana pound cake.  I would prefer a more intense banana flavor.  Next time I'll leave it plain without the topping.

when i made this recipie, i made muffins instead of the bread  so it would appeal better 2 the kids. i used walnuts in the cinn/sugar mixture. the muffins cooked in @30mins. i customized it to make 10, it made 14. the cinn. flavor gave them the upper hand, i liked the creamy texture as well.i followed the other suggestons and layered most of the mixture inside the muffins. i served w/butter and everyone devoured them. i will make these again.

This banana bread was great!  I used butter instead of margarine and no nuts.  The time in the directions worked out great.  I usually have to take it out sooner or let it stay in longer with other banana bread recipes.  The outside was nice and golden and the inside moist.

The banana bread was really moist and flavorful.  I added almost 2 cups of mashed bananas after reading the reviews.  My young children do not eat nuts, so I made one loaf with the nut mixture and one with chocolate chips.

This turned out so much better than I thought! Very moist & had a nice creamy taste to it. I also added more brown sugar/pecans/cinammon than was called for to swirl in the middle of the batter and to add on top.
Excellent recipe & I will def. use it again!

It was excellent.  It took a little longer than 45 mins to cook, I think it was the cream cheese.  It was so light and fluffy.

My son loved this and I really like it too. It doesn't taste too much of bananas, but it is so moist and better yet, no crumbles!  It was great for a picnic and doesn't need any butter because it is so moist.  I think it has more of a coffee cake taste due to the cinnomon.  This one is a winner with us!

It was good, but I was hoping for a super moist bread with all the cream cheese, which it was not. It is not the best banana bread recipe that I have done. I will keep searching.

I like Banana Bread but rarely make it.  With this recipe, that will change!  I had saved 3 recipes from this site and tried this one because I had the cream cheese and it included the cinnamon/brown sugar.....Great!  I can cook alright, but I cannot bake!  I used the adjustments submitted by Rachel Severson because I needed to cook in a 9 x 13 inch pan and figured I might need a little bit more substance...it was better than I anticipated! I brought it to a social function which I would never do if I thought the recipe was under par!  Thanks So Much to the submitter! and to R. Severson!

Great moist banana bread! I did alter a few of the ingredients.  I use half white and half brown sugar, added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough mixture, and just sprinkled cinnamon/brown sugar on top of the loaves! Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Hold the Recipe..It's zucchini season and substitute 3 cups of grated zucchini and/or yellow squash in place of the bananas and replace oil with Apple Butter and OMG...You have the most amazing zucchini bread!!!  otherwise, Excellent recommendation with the 2 cups bananas, extra egg, flour, soda and powder.  I used oil instead of butter or margarine and used Chinese 5 Spice instead of cinnamon, popped it into 9x13 pan and watch out, Momma's more popular than ever.  Totally rocked and cleaned house at my friends shower.  Thanks so much.

I used reduced fat cream cheese and 3/4 cup of sugar for one batch and 3/4 cup of splenda for the other 2 batches, both were excellent.

This got rave reviews from all!  One suggestion, divide the crumb and nut mixture in 2 so you know how much you should put in each.  I was conservative and had a lot left over that I put on top that I think would have been better if it was inside the bread.  Great despite this.

I made this recipe today because it sounded wonderful!  After reading the reviews, and before baking, I decided to follow other reviewers recommendation and added more banana to enhance the flavor.  Unfortunately, that didn't help and what I ended up with was edible, but bland and pretty boring.  I will continue to look for other recipes and will not be making this again.

This is a lighter banana bread than I'm used to, but it is very tasty. The 1st loaf is almost gone, it's been out of the oven for maybe about 10 minutes

This recipe was really good! I omitted the nuts (didn't have any) and used 2 over-ripe bananas and the flavor was great. It is definitely a lighter-textured bread, so if you are looking for that dense banana bread, this is not it! I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

Turned out delcious, moist, and a real crowd-pleaser.  Soft enough to be one of my few food sources after my wisdom teeth were removed... Though I did stay away from the center line of nuts, sugar, and cinnamon.  Husband loved it, fantastic!

Well, I had planned on being the first to submit a photo, but my family devoured the banana bread before I had a chance to pull out the camera! This was a fantastic recipe. I made minor adjustments to fit my family's tastes and the bread was still incredibly moist. Thank you, Pam Hall!

This bread is absolutely delicious.  I used two bananas instead of measuring out 1C mashed - probably came out to be like 1 and 1/2 C or something... followed the recipe EXACTLY, and YUMMMMMMM.  By far the best banana bread ever!!! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

this was excellent.  I made only 1 bread as I only had enough cream cheese for 1.  Next time I will make sure I have enough for a few loaves as my family demolished in minutes!  My daughter is allergic to nuts so I substituted nuts with chocolate chips her fav and my family went nuts!!

This was an incredible banana bread...I don't know how anyone can give it less than 5 stars!!  It is super moist and tasted very much like banana (I only had 2 medium bananas that were ripe, only came to little more than 1/2 cup).  Absolutely delicious and it will be my only banana bread recipe from now on.

This bread is DELICIOUS!!!  I will definately be using this recipe again!  I used 2.5 decent sized bananas, which was a bit more than the recipe called for.. Next time I will probably just make some crumbs for the top instead of using the pecan/cinnamon/brown sugar mixture in this recipe.. This is an EXCELLENT, very MOIST bread!  THANKS!

This recipe was very bland. It needed more sugar, but my husband really liked it. It could have been that I used a bundt pan because that was all I had at that time.  Overall it was okay.

Awesome!!!  Tastes great, so nice and moist and easy to make.  I was a little worried when I first cut into because it is so much lighter in color than the typical banana bread but one bite and it quickly became "my banana bread recipe"

This is the best banana nut bread I ever had. Used Walnuts instead of pecans, and just mixed the nut mixture in the batter instead of making it in the center. It was fab! I love the cream cheese it makes it very creamy. I will making this again and again.

This is not what I expected, not at all like regular banana bread, but nice none the less.  A little on the dry side for my tastes.  I doubt I'll make this again, unless I need to use up bananas and cream cheese at the same time.  It tasted more like a coffee cake than a banana bread to me.

This was the best banana bread I have ever made or tasted. It was very moist and delicious.  I added an extra banana and a tad more vanilla and it was perfect. This will definately be a favorite of our family.

I have made so many versions of banana bread and this one rocks my world! This banana bread is almost the consistency of a cake and I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked it in a bundt pan. Absolutely delicious!!!

I was looking for a " different " banana bread recipe, when I saw this one.Followed the recipe exactly, and I was not too impressed. Bread came out very dense. It did not rise very well, and actually was lacking flavor. The brown sugar middle added a bit of taste, but as I started doing....Im STILL looking for a different and yummy banana bread recipe. Sorry....I dont think I will be making this one again.

Banana bread is one of the things I love most in the world of food.  I was completely astonished at how WONDERFUL this recipe turned out.  I added a couple handfuls of roughly chopped pecans to the actual batter, & I doubled the vanilla & added an extra banana.  I loved how quickly my breads cooked, & I simply cannot get over the flavor!!!!!!!

This is a VERY good recipe, but I wouldn't compare it to traditional banana bread. The one I made was more like a coffee cake consistancy.
I halfed the recipe for one loaf and that made it difficult to do the layering. Loaf wasn't very tall but "bread" was very light and fluffy. Will make again as a coffee cake.

I made this recipe last weekend. Everyone loved it! Both loaves were gone in one day. I did make some modifications: I added another mashed banana and I added some cinnamon to the mixture. I highly recommend this banana bread recipe, it was very moist.

I really liked this recipe. The bread was very moist (not dry like some banana breads can be), which was exactly what I was looking for. However, I thought there wasn't enough banana flavor just using the amount called for.  Having said that, I WILL be making this again, just adding more bananas - it really was very good.

First time I ever felt the need to rate a recipe! O-MY this was fantastic! I followed the instructions almost to a T. The only thing I did differently was I poured it all into 1 bunt pan because I only had one bread pan and sprinkled the stuff on top instead of inside. cooked up fantatic. Nice and moist. My daughter helped me make it. Quick Simple and TASTY!!!

Delicious! We did end up using a *touch* more flour, maybe a little les than an extra 1/4 cup, to stiffen it up and we also left out the pecans since we didn't have any, but other than that we followed the recipe exactly. It turned out beautifully!

Sorry, this recipe was not as I anticipated.  The bread was very dense, the top came out almost over-done and even though I left the bread in the oven for longer than the recipe stated, the bread was under-done.  I thought the pecan mixture would caramelize more.  The bread also sank after it came out of the oven.  All-in-all, it was ok, but I won't make this again.

I give it four stars only because it tastes more like a cinnamon bread than a banana bread. Next time I will add more banana. My husband said it was the best bread he had ever had.

Loved it! So moist--will definitely make again. Added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, and I halved the cinnamon in the streusel topping and replaced it with nutmeg. So good!

This is my new default banana bread recipe!  

I made a few substitutions: 1) I used Rapadura instead of refined sugar, and cut it down to 1C.  This is still plenty sweet!  2)  I used butter instead of margarine.  3)  I used Rapadura instead of brown sugar.  4) I used Neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese.

My friends and I absolutely loved this bread-- it disappeared fast.  The Neufchatel gives it amazing flavor, and the ribbon of pecans and cinnamon running through the bread is delectable.

We all love this recipe. I used a bit more brown sugar and 4 bananas per other's suggestions. My muffin baking stone was filled three times, giving me 36 full-size muffins (some to freeze!) and my mini muffin pan was filled twice, yeilding 24 mini muffins. Thanks for passing this goodie along!

This bread was soooo good!  It was very moist and the flavor was to die for.  My kids had a blast helping make it and taste testing.  This bread did not last the day.  The second time I made it I made it into muffins.  
This will be a keeper.

oustanding recipe-- I wonder if you could make this with another type of fruit as well...very very good. I did not make it with the layer of nuts but imagine that is good too. The best banana bread recipe I have ever tasted

Everyone I have made this recipe for really raves about it, and I've had a high percentage of recipients ask for the recipe.  Very very good and moist.  Made on a weekly basis in our home--a new staple for dessert and/or breakfast!

Wonderfully different!  Moist, pretty, flavorful!  I like the fact it makes 2 loaves---one for you/family and one to share with co-workers, neighbor, etc.

This is a great, easy recipe.  I used both a glass loaf pan and metal loaf pan to see if there was any difference.  None.  They both turned out great!  Thanks!

This banana bread was good but the cream cheese was just added fat because you could not taste it and the cinnamon competed with the banana, I would cut way back on the cinnamon or someone will think you made a cinnamon bread not banana.

It was tasty enough but not phenomenal. And it hardly rose at all. I followed the directions (having never made it before, I didn't want to improvise until I knew how the recipe turned out). If I make it again, I'd stir in the cinnamon-nuts-brown sugar mixture rather than layer it.

I took the advice of other reviewers and did not layer.  As was previously suggested, I added an extra bananna  I added walnuts to the mix and I put cinnamon in the mix as well.  I would make again!

This was delicious.  I added extra banana and left out the pecans because I didn't have any.  I will try next time with the pecans.  Sliced nicely.

very delicious! I had no problem putting the layers together to bake, however when I cut it, the layers fell apart. Parts of the cinnamon layer were on both halves though and it still tasted great. rave reviews when I took it to work!

What an amazing recipe! I made some for us and some to give away to friends. This bread received rave reviews all around. I changed the recipe in one minor way: I used about 5 oz. low-fat soft cream cheese and added a small container (3.9 oz) of unsweetened apple sauce to make up the difference. This made the bread very moist - and it saves a few calories. Thanks for a great recipe. This is a keeper!

A good cake without overpowering taste. The kind of banana bread kids would love. I like lots of bananas in my banana bread, but this one is a good one for company or when I want to rest my mouth. Very moist, which is a required quality to me in cake.

This is fantastic!  I made 2 loaves (one to keep and one to share).  My husband usually does not eat banana bread.  He loved it so much he didn't want to give away the second loaf!  Definately a keeper!

This is  a  brilliant  recipe  for  banana bread, I  will  definitely  use  it  again. I  had  wanted to make a  banana loaf  but couldn't find  a  decent  recipe in my (English) cookbooks.  I  made  two loaves which disappeared quickly. I used  sultanas  instead  of  nuts,  mixing them  into the rest of the ingredients which seemed to  work well.

Really good bread - the cinnamon/pecan topping would benefit from the addition of 2 T. of melted butter stirred into the mixture before sprinkling on top.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This bread was OK, but not one that I would make again.  Too moist and not enough banana flavour.  Didn't even taste like banana bread.

Exceptional! I make jumbo muffins rather than bread. The cinnamon is a nice surprise. I've made them three times now, and the last time my daughter was very upset that they were for my co-workers. She says they're too good to share...
