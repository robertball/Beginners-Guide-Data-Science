TRY THIS RECIPE! Simple and easy to make, all natural and delicious. I've been making my own almond milk for a few months thanks to another recipe on this website yet I wanted to try this because it adds dates and loved the idea of an unprocessed sweetener. This is a great way to have fresh, inexpensive and incomparable taste than any store bought almond milk. The nutrition from the dates alone should convince you to stop buying the store-bought, chemically sweetened/preserved version. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. The dates make it much sweeter than I had anticipated. My daughter was able to help me make it and she hasnâ€™t stopped talking about how good it was.
