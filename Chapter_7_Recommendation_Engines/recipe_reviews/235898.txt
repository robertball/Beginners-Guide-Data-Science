I adore bread pudding and I love eggnog, so why didn't I ever think to combine the two before??? lol This recipe is absolutely delicious! I did add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, but beyond that, I followed the recipe as written and the resulting dish was a huge hit with my family. Next time I think I will add a bit of rum for a little extra kick. Thanks so much for this keeper of a recipe!!

I liked it, but it was not sweet enough for my taste.  I added freshly grated nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon which others suggested.   I also added raisins, but I did not include apples.  I used dinner rolls as the bread and they worked great.  Next time I will add about 1/3 C of sugar to the eggnog mixture.

This was a great idea for using up the leftover holiday eggnog. I halved this recipe and baked for the time directed in ramekins that I put in a hot water bath. I liked the flavor but I do think I would skip the apple next time for a more pure eggnog flavor. Flavor did develop further as the custard chilled. and we preferred it cold. Will def make this next eggnog season. Thanks for sharing!

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  I doubled the eggnog and eggs as my 10x15 pan was full to the brim with cubed hotdog buns.  I did not add apples.

I made it with raisin bread, added a little rum extract and cinnamon. I think some of my eggs didn't blend well, so a little cooked egg white in center. Can't wait to taste! Smells really good!!

Yum! I'll definitely be making this again. I wasn't sure if the apples and eggnog would go together well, but I was happily surprised! I did cut down on sugar to about half of what the original recipe said, and it was still plenty sweet.

The first time I made it according to directions and it turned out wonderfully. My grandmother who is quite the bread pudding snob even said it was the best she ever tasted. I now have to make it for her every year when I visit for Christmas. I have made it several times now and I have tweaked it a bit. I now add a shot or two of Bourbon to the egg and eggnog mixture. I also sprinkle the top with cinnamon. My mom likes to add soaked raisins when she makes it. Also great with a handful of walnuts or chocolate chips or both. Have fun exploring and I hope you enjoy making this for your family as much as I do. So glad I came across this recipe years ago, it has now become a family holidays staple!

This recipe was delious. I had a lot of dinner rolls left over and I didn't want them to go to waste. I only had one apple on hand so I added a cup of plumb raisins.

I was just okay.  It needed some kind of seasoning for flavor.

Thanks to other comments I baked for 40min covered and 10 min uncovered. I also added agave syrup  plus cayenne pepper  to add sweetness and a nice hint of heat. Made it for brunch. Yum!
