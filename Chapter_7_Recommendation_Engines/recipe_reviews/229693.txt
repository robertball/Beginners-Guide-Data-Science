When I came across this recipe I just had to make them. Had no clue what these would look or taste like. Surprisingly good. The cookies are not sweet and taste like granola with bacon. I made them with whole wheat flour and real bacon.

Surprisingly good! I left out the sugar entirely and used Frosted Flakes instead of corn flakes. Just the right amount of sweetness and the bacon flavor really comes through. I will make these again!

Taste is okay, but they completely flattened out to make one giant "cookie" on the cookie sheet.  I made these to use up some cornflakes, I won't make them again.

These were surprisingly good! I made them exactly to recipe. My 10 year old twin boys and 16 year old daughter all liked them a lot! I had doubled the recipe because I had a half pound of bacon to use up. Definitely go with real bacon! I have enough for the kids for breakfast for the next few days!

Mildly sweet
Reminds me of oatmeal cookies
Zerobacon flavor
Zero cheddar cheese flavor
Overall, I was extremely disappointed

The recipe did not say melted butter. In the picture the corn flakes look broken up. I melted the butter and did not smash the corn flakes. I used unsalted butter, the recipe needed salt. I can see the need to lower the sugar.  I like the crunch and bacon.

Very odd when you're expecting a cookie to taste bacon and cheese savory flavors but good once you adjust. :)

Followed the recipe exactly, and the mixture was very dry.  I hand-formed spoonfuls into balls and flattened them a little.  The finished cookie was OK, nothing special.  Maybe I should have melted the butter before adding?  Or maybe use 2 eggs instead of just one?  Oh, and I got a total of 12 cookies.

Not something I hated but not something I'm likely to make again. I followed the recipe exactly but maybe I needed a bit more detail or something. Te bacon bits, I bought actual bacon bits but now I'm thinking it might have been better to get bacon, fry it and cut it up rather than use those the bacon bits make it kind of salty and a little bitter-- they are definitely the dominant taste. The cookies themselves flattened and kind of mushed together to look like a giant cake but maybe that's my fault, I'll just put less cookies per baking sheet next time I make cookies. The overall taste at the end? Bacon with a hint of flour-- the cereal added a bit of crunch but that's about it

We tried 4 different batches in our commercial kitchen and each time they tasted like a granola bar (with bacon)
Bland! No shelf life for texture or softness.

I've made this twice.  First time, meh, but Hubby loved them.  (He loves anything with bacon.)  Second time, I used real bacon and added some of the bacon grease to the butter.  Wowzers.  Much better.

I didn't care for these cookies. These "cookies" were far too sweet. I followed the recipe and was skeptical about the amount of sugar. I would decrease the amount to 1/4 cup or leave it out completely. Sweetness overshadowed the flavor of the bacon and cheese. Placing the "cookie" on the cookie sheet was a bit of work because it was difficult to incorporate the Cornflakes into the batter  and not have the batter fall apart.
I will not make these again.

I didn't have any bacon bits, so I fried up three strips of bacon and used it instead. My bacon-loving-son was not impressed, he didn't like the cornflakes texture. However my husband loved them and so I will be making them again :-)

Used real bacon and white flour. Ok for breakfast on the go, but don't know if I'll make them again.

I'm still unsure how to describe them. They're not "oh how delicious" but they're not bad. It is literally like eating breakfast in a cookie. You taste the sweetness and the bacon.  I may switch to all purpose flour instead of wheat flour to see if that makes a difference (I'm not a big fan of wheat flour).
THey are worth a try though, people who tried them said they were "interesting".

I used all unbleached flour and real bacon.  These had a wonderful buttery taste, but not enough bacon flavor.  Not much cheese flavor either.  Instructions should indicate butter melted or not.  I did, and also crushed the cornflakes a bit.

A little too sweet. Next time I will use 1/2 C sugar and double the bacon. I used bran flakes and white flour and was very happy with that substitution. Good find!

Ugh!  even with cutting the sugar to 1/4 C., these are too too sweet!  They might be good as cocktail treats if the sugar were omitted, salt and cayenne pepper added.

It's unfair for me to rate this recipe because I dislike most sweet things for breakfast, but love bacon and cheese.  I eliminated the sugar altogether and added some crispy rice cereal to the mix.  They turned out well and more suited to our tastes.

I thought this was pretty bland.  It might be better with sausage, the herbs would jazz it it up.  Just not a hit for me.

yum!  2 kids and the husband loved them   easy to make.  i used real bacon not the bits and they turned out perfectly.
