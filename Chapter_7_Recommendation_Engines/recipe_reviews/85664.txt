Left out the scallions and added olives.  Delicious!  I took the suggestion of spraying the potatoes with Pam like someone said and that worked well.

Just got done eating these.  They were good and filling.  I am rating it 5 stars because how easy and tasty they are to make.  I had to omit the scallions because I had none.  I tried to replace it with cilantro, but it just wasn't right.  If you don't have scallions, I recommend you leave it as it is.

I think these were missing something, but they are great for parties nonetheless.

Quick, easy, tasty.

Hooray...No more ordering these at the restaurant!  I can finally make them at home.  This was very simple to make, but I made more than what the recipe suggested.  I piled on the cheese and used more than just 4 slices of bacon!  Mmmm mmm good!  I didn't have scallions, but used what I had on hand, Spanish onions, and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

What I did was after i cooked the potatoes then i dumped out the middle i used that to fill the potatoes. using the onions, sour cream, cheese, and bacon. then i load that potatoes like normal then sprinkle cheese on top, broil then eat. :) Its such a great recipe!
