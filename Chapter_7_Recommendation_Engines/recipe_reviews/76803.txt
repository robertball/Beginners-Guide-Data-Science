OMG!  This was excellent!  Big hit at my party.  I made a jug of it and put glasses and ice nearby and everyone helped themselves!

Little sweet for me, so I added another shot of vodka. Took the edge off a stressful day and made a rainy day seem brighter. Thanks! (Nice to find a recipe that used banana liquor. Found it on clearance at my local liquor store and no idea what to use it in.)

After vacationing in the caribbean, this sounded like just what I wanted. However, it was a little too strong for my tastes. I added some pineapple juice to mellow it out enough to enjoy; in the future I would leave the vodka out and substitute the same measurement of pineapple juice.

I couldn't wait to make this, but Holy Cow you can taste the vodka! So I added 2/3 of one of those small cans of pineapple juice.  Don't get me wrong, I like vodka, but I would like to try it next time without the vodka.

I personally can't stand banana liquor so I switched it to a wild berry schnapps.  Yummo!  My change made it a bit sweet, so maybe a splash of lime juice, but thanks for the inspiration!

The banana liquer was over powering we tried tempering the "cough syrup" effective with pineapple juice but this is drink is very strong.

I had the ingredients on hand and made it for my husband.  He enjoyed it, but wasn't "ga-ga" over it.
