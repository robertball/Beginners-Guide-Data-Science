I think this recipe is the best. I used fillo dough instead of crescent. In the filling I used a dash of nutmeg,and a dash of cinnamon. Before I put it in the oven I sprinkle some cinnamon-sugar before puting it in the oven. I let it bake for ten minutes. Then sprinkle on the other side.When it was done I covered it with lemon-cream cheese icing. Delicious!!!

After reading the ingredients, these didn't sound like anything special but, wow, they were delicious!  If you have trouble sealing the dough just brush with a little egg wash on one side.  I pinched two large crescents together to make a large rectangle, then cut it into squares and sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on one side.  I put each square into a muffin pan (sugar side up), filled them with some blueberry pie filling and folded the flaps of dough over to make a little dumpling like shape.  Then I sprinkled the top with more cinnamon-sugar before baking.  The temperature seemed a little high so I lower it to 350 and baked about 12 minutes.  After cooling, I put the glaze on (and make sure they're completely cool or your glaze will just drip right off) and man, they were so good!!  I bake A LOT and I have to say for the effort, these resulted in a fabulous treat!  They tasted like they were from the bakery!  I also made them filled with the "Sauteed Apples" from this site, served warm with some ice cream and they tasted like a restaurant dessert!!  They can be stored in the fridge for a few days and warmed in the micro and they taste great! Excellent, easy base recipe!

So easy, fast, and a great way to use up some leftover cherry pie filling.  The only thing I had trouble with was that I did not seal the seams on the crescent rolls well enough, so a little liquid seeped out, but they were still a big hit.

My family loves these!! It just doesn't get any easier than this for a delicious, fast, easy dessert on busy days. I use puff pastry (each defrosted sheet cut into 4 equal pieces) in place of the crescent rolls. Perfect.

Continuing my baking frenzy, I found myself flush with bits of chocolate and other chips.  I subbed the cherry filling with Dark Chocolate, drizzled with the same, then Milk Chocolate, drizzled with same, Cinnamon (chips) drizzled with same and the knock out fave, Andes Mint Chips drizzled with dark chocolate.

My coworkers are currently in a comma, but at least I don't have all those remaining bits of chips!  Going to try the cherry tonight.

absolutely fabulous! cooked them and served as a desert. I'm usually not a big fan of cherries but loved this. i did tweak the recipe though. i used real cherries, quartered them and pitted them, added enough sugar to coat them (thinly), and added about two-three pinches of cinnamon. i mixed it together and used a potato masher to mash them up a bit and let them sit in their natural juices covered for about two hours in the fridge. cooked them for ten minutes at 375 and wha-la! a delicious desert!

I gave 5 stars for the ease of preparation and simplicity of ingredients. These make a tasty and very easy dessert for a weeknight. I even had my preschooler help me make them. Oh, and I added a couple of drops of almond extract to the cherry filling. Thanks!

These tasted good, but I thought the ratio of cherry filling to dough was a little off. That may be my fault though, as I decided not to push the triangles together into squares. As a result, they didn't roll too well, and some of the filling oozed out. Oops!

I thought these were pretty good, but not as mouthwatering as I'd envisioned.  The crescent rolls just didn't do it for me for the crust.  For as bland as they were, they need a better-tasting glaze.  They also looked really easy, but I found them to be kind of a pain to put together, with filling constantly squirting out the sides.  So then you add less filling which made them even more bland... It was a conundrum.

Very quick and easy! However, if you use the refrigerated crescent rolls, realize that they actually make 4 rectangles (not squares). Therefore you have to be creative in folding them and it can get a little messy if you're experimenting. I sprinkled with cinnamon and popped them in the convection oven for 10 minutes.

A lot of times when you have something this easy, it's not necessarily really good.  But these were quite good!  I'll make them often - and with different fillings.

Very quick and easy snack...only tried it once so far and learned a lot about qty and working with the dough. I too want to cut up the whole cherries so they're not so unwieldy.

Very good. Might add cinnamon/ sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Used cresent rolls; was a bit messy, and didn't need all that much filling for each turnover-- would suggest filo dough. A little messy. Icing melts when turnovers are warm. I might try different filling flavors next time, just to see.

Tastes pretty good, but be sure they are not undercooked.  Pretty messy and not super easy (I actually believe it would be easier to use Bisquick rather than the crescent dough)

These were great and super easy. I used reduced fat crescent rolls and lite cherry pie filling and they were perfect.

I make these all the time using apple pie filling.  My husband LOVES them.  Sometimes I even cut the crescent roll triangles in half to make smaller bitesized treates.   I don't ice them but I do sprinkle with a little cinnamin sugar.

Very easy. My oldest and I made these in a matter of minutes. I did stir in a little nutmeg to the pie filling and I used the light. My boys loved them. Next time, I'd use phyllo dough.

Great simple recipe! I omitted the icing, and used an egg wash on top. I put both a cream cheese and the cherry pie filling. (pick out the cherries, cut them up, and dont put in too much filling!)
