Have used this recipe a couple of times...and love it in the slow cooker.  I also have used various types of chicken and they all work, if you don;t mind the bones.

Too mild for my taste. If Iâ€™m going to eat curry, I want the spices to come through more strongly. The flavor was good and the recipe is quick and easy. Next time, however, I will either use hot curry paste or double the amount of the mild.
