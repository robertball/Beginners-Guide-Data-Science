I'm shocked this recipe hasn't been tried and reviewed yet! This is a winner! I'm a chili lover, but I usually make mine with meat, and lots of it. This was my first time making quinoa chili or chili with no meat! This recipe sounded super intriguing, so I just had to whip some up.  The recipe couldn't be easier, and it's ready fairly quickly.  I couldn't find a tri-bean blend, so I used Bush's Mixed Beans (mix of Pinto and Great Northern beans). For the chili seasoning, I used McCormick's Tex-Mex flavor. The only thing I might change is to add a bit more broth (at least another 1/2 cup) bc I found the final product to be very thick. Also, next time I will omit the first step of pre-mixing the broth and seasoning mix. These ingredients can easily all be tossed in together in step 2. Thank you ciao bella for the great recipe and providing me with some delicious and nutritious lunches all week!

So great and fast to make! It's a little spicy using original chili seasoning. Next time I will make with mild for a little less spice. You have to try this!

The whole family loves this, especially my teenage son.  I cut back on the canned chilies and substituted diced fresh jalape√±os and tomatillo salsa. Served over baked potatoes.  Delicious!

I made this 11/2018 as written--even found the tri-bean blend.  It's easy to make, tastes OK.  However, it was more like a casserole than a chili.  The quinoa absorbs most of the liquid--even seemed to do so after it was cooked and in the frig.  Don't know if I'll make again as there are lots of other recipes out there for chili and/or quinoa.  But, if I were to come back to this recipe, I'd probably add more liquid to it.

This was excellent! It could easily be made vegetarian by using veggie broth.  I could not find tri-beans so I was going to use a 1/2 can of lima (which I had open already) and 1/2 can black and 1/2 can kidney but decided to add the full cans of black and kidney and it was excellent as well.  I will definitely make this again! Had to add some extra liquid at the end as it was getting dry, made it ahead and put it in the slow cooker.

My family really loved this. It was very easy to make, especially when you want to make something filling. We added left over hamburger meat in ours and use black beans. We don't add the chilies due to my toddler, but we do put in a can of diced tomatoes. When we serve it, we like to add a little cheese and plain nonfat yogurt mixed in. Yummy!
