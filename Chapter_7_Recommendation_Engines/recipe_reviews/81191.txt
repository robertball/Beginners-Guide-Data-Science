This is my mom's recipe, and my sister submitted this, so I have to leave my comments about what I do differently...I usually sub sour cream for the cream cheese, its easier to stir. I also let this mellow in the frig a bit before serving. I love the kick the cayenne pepper gives this! Thanks, Mom! Love you!

Scrumptious!  I used real cheddar in lieu of processed cheese food and reduced fat cream cheese and mayo.  I increased the pimento to 3 oz. and added freshly ground black pepper as well as a dash of worstershire.  TIP:  try it on bread with juicy tomatoes and crisp lettuce.

I was looking for a good recipe for Pimento Cheese, and this was TERRIFIC!  After reading other reviews, I decided to use sharp cheddar cheese (two 8-oz. blocks) instead of processed cheese.  Even my husband, who's hard to impress, raved over this recipe.  There's no doubt I will make this again and again...Thanks for sharing! :)

Great simple recipe. I used lite ingredients so I saved a few calories but it tasted as good as the first time I made it. I used 4 oz. pimento's, 2 cup of low-fat cheddar cheese,low fat onions & chives cream cheese, about 1 tbsp of light sour cream, lite mayo not quite a 1/2 of cup.lite mayo.cup, Cayenne pepper to taste. I also added sliced salad olives just for fun. Put in middle of tray with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and party rye bread. Simple and easy appetizer.

So easy and so versatile!  I use shredded Colby-Jack and change up the seasonings depending on my mood.  Some days it's onion and garlic, some days it Greek, some days it just salt and pepper...and always it's delicious!  Using sun dried tomatoes in place of pimentos is a tasty change!

I had my doubts but this turned out so good.  I changed a few things but I chalk it up to personal taste so I still give it 5 stars.  I used a little garlic salt instead of garlic powder and light cream cheese and half light mayo/half regular mayo.  I used the small block of Velveeta shredded and it wasn't enough cheese so I added some mild cheddar.  The only thing I might advise others to change is to add more cheese if you prefer yours to be less mayo"naissy".

This is the best pimento cheese spread I have ever made. I fixed it for my husband to take on a fishing trip, we couldn't stop sampling it. I didn't have the American cheese, so I used what I had on hand which was shredded mild cheddar cheese. I don't see how this could be any better!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Thanks Dayluce!  This is an awesome recipe.  I cut down on the cayenne pepper to about half.  I tried the mayo and today I am making it with sour cream - so not sure which one I will prefer.  I buy Price pimento cheese when I am in AZ - and my neighbor said that she preferred mine over Price!  Unreal.

The best pimento cheese spread I've ever made, and I remember making several. Definitely adult-oriented, as the spiciness made it appealing to my parents.

Being from the south, I kind of grew up on this and it was always purchased this from the grocery store.  I had a hankering for it as I wasn't feeling well and I didn't want to go out.  I made it the 'recipe' way the first time and it got me through.  The next time I changed the processed cheese for sharp and mild cheddar cheese.  I added fresh finely diced onion instead of the onion powder.  This is a staple food item in my refrigerator!

Try it as sandwich spread.  Cut the sandwich in four parts.  Great snack for kids (just eliminate the cayun pepper).

This was a first for me. I used mild cheddar cheese, and more like a cup of mayo. Very pretty to look at and yummy to eat. Thanks for sharing.

This has become my "signature" for all parties and no one can get enough of it. I make double batches for small parties and there are never leftovers! It couldnt be easier, the kids can help with the mixing and measuring, and you just cant mess it up. Genius!!! I serve it alongside crackers, celery, and most recently on cucumber slices with additional paprika and a sliver of jalapeno... Yum!

I made this with sharp cheddar because I really don't like Velveeta "cheese food." The flavors were good with the onion and garlic. But the consistancy was too creamy for me. Maybe as a filling for celery it would be OK. It didn't have the texture I like in a sandwich.

I'm not sure if you have to grow up eating Pimiento Cheese in order to enjoy it; if so, it explains why my husband and I didn't care for this much.  But since I've never eaten it before, I can't comment on how this Pimiento Cheese rates in comparison to others.  I used sharp cheddar, but added a lot more than called for because the original just tasted like mayo to me.  I made tea sandwiches and took them to church, where they met mixed reviews. Some loved them, but a few of the kids threw theirs away. Sorry--won't be making this again, but you might like it if you already like Pimiento Cheese.

OK pimento cheese.  I've never tried it with cream cheese before....I like it.  This needs to be served room temperature because straight from the refrigerator, it is not spreadable.

I have never been a fan of pimento cheese but my husband LOVES it. When I started looking at recipes this one jumped out at me because of the cream cheese and WOW what a difference it makes. I am now hooked!! I add white pepper, paprika and a little powdered garlic to mine and it is DELICIOUS!! Thanks for sharing!!

I love pimento cheese.  This recipe was not only very quick and easy, but also very good.  The only thing I changed was instead of using 1/2 cup of mayo I used 1/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream.  Next time I might even try only sour cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!

this is a great recipe but I grew up with the Kraft kind of pimento spread so I use 1/4 of a brick of Velveeta instead of the shredded American and I just cube it add everything to a pot and heat it up then it becomes smooth and yummy...its terrific hot or cold!

I have tried several recipes for pimento cheese and this is hands down our favorite.  I substituted sharp cheddar for the processed American and packed up sandwiches for a long flight from the east coast of the U.S. to the west coast.  They were devoured before the plane took off!   Simple and straightforward, this is the recipe I will be keeping!

I have never tried any kind of pimento cheese and decided that I wanted to see what my mom was fussing about.  Picked this recipe over others due to the great ratings and I am so glad I did.. Absolutely wonderful!! Followed the reviews of others and used shredded sharp cheese instead of processed and added a smidge more garlic (never can one have too much garlic) This came out perfect and is going into my recipe box for sure!! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!!

This is a big hit in my home.  A friend had recommended a brand of pimento cheese and we tried it.  It was good and the wife loved it but when I looked at the ingredients I figured that I could do as good or better.  I found this recipe and it is definitely better.  I use extra sharp cheddar by the pound, heavy on the cayenne and light on the mayo.  Let it sit for an hour or so for the flavors to develop then dig in.

Definitely spicy with 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  Kids present would not eat it, but DH and I, and rest present really enjoyed! Thanks.

WOW! I absolutely loved this! It was SO easy and tasted great! I used sharp cheddar shredded cheese instead of processed. I put it on my bread, and cooked it like you would a grilled cheese sandwich to brown both sides of bread. It was wonderful! Thanks :)

I thought this was fantastic! I normally don't like pimento cheese because of it's strong mayo flavor, but this was great!  I used about 1/4c mayo and 1/4c sour cream and a 4 oz jar of pimentos and I also used cheddar cheese instead of the american pasteurized cheese product. Absolutely delicious!

Really, really, really liked the flavor, but bought shredded velveeta for my cheese and I HATED the texture of it.  It GROSSED me out completely. I love extra sharp cheddar cheese so next time I will just use that in place of the processed cheese in this recipe.  I think it will make it much better.

Oh my was this good!  I used reall cheese instead of cheese food.  I actually used a few different kinds of cheese(all that i had) like cheddar and monteray.  it turned out fantastic. any kind of cheese would work.  from my experiments though cheddar seems to be the best.  a fantastic recipe

I have made this at least 6 times this summer. Each time I tweak it a little one way or the other. This is a great recipe and I have used it both with processed or shredded cheddar cheese. It really just depends on personal preference. I am going to try subbing the sour cream for cream cheese next!

I have been making this way for a couple of years since eating some like this at whole foods. I use real cheese tho depending on what I have on hand.  I hand mixed several kinds together etc.I have also used chopped red bell pepper or sun dried tomatos when I have been out of pimentos. This recipe is awesome and gives you room to add your own twist.

It was just ok.  I've only had pimento cheese twice before in my life so I don't have a lot to draw from, but this seemed a bit bland to me.

I loved it.  I used cheddar like some people recommended - I'm not a huge fan of processed American cheese.  And I used Onion & Chive cream cheese, which was great, and I think plain would be great too.  I loved the cayenne kick.  I will be making more soon.

Instead of American cheese food (aka Velveeta), I used New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese. After taste testing it, I doubled the spices. Uh, YUM. We loved this. LOVED THIS. Nothing remains, we ate it all. Great spread on Wheatables Nut Crisps. This recipe's a keeper.

WOW! I have never cared for pimento cheese, but my husband loves it. So we decided to make this recipe for our New Years Eve party. We made it 2 days before the party, and I can already see I will have to make more! We mistakenly put in 8oz of cream cheese instead of 4, and used 1 cup of yellow cheddar & 1 cup white cheddar, instead of the cheese food. The consistency & texture were great! Very light, fluffy & spreadable. We may even try using this recipe as a base, and adding bacon! Thank You for such a simple yet wonderful recipe!

Really, really good.  We used low-fat cream cheese and low-fat mayonnaise and it turned out great.  Next time, I will cut back on the cayenne pepper slightly since I'm not too keen on cayenne, but I will definitely make it again.

I only changed one thing, just a personal preference for the "tasters" in my crowd, instead of the jarred pimentos, I subbed roaseted red peppers, very thin sliced/diced.  It was wonderful and went in about 1 minute flat!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great dip, spread or just by itself. I graded extra sharp cheddar, used the whipped cream chesse and added pepper jack to it as well. We like it a little spicer. The pepper jack got it done to perfection.

My changes were using shredded mild cheddar instead of proccessed cheese, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, only a dash of cayenne and used a whole 4 oz.jar of drained pimentos (i did reserve the juice from the pimentos and added about 2 TBS of it to my recipe for flavor and bit of moistness) I was out of onion powder so I used two pinches of onion flakes. My garlic powder shaker came out more than a dash and at first I thought it would be too much but everything has blended perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. Goes to show you can tweak to your liking or preference.

This recipe turned out very moist and very creamy - too "wet" for my taste.  I tend to prefer my pimento cheese a bit "drier" and so I had to keep adding shreeded cheese. That is my only reason for the 3 stars. Taste was great once I reached a consistency I liked. My advice would be to make sure you have a bit more shredded cheese on hand than you need, just in case.

Love this!  I made it twice in one week.  I use reduced-fat ingredients, including 2% milk sharp cheddar.  The first time, I used sour cream in place of the cream cheese, and the second time I used part-skim ricotta.  It was delicious both ways.  Thanks for the great twist on an old favorite!

Wow!  This is an exceptional recipe.  I thought to myself before trying it, "How good could this really be?"  But, wow.  It really is yummy.
I used 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, and half of the cayenne pepper.  (I was making it for children and worried about the hotness of the pepper)

Definitely a keeper!!!

Yummy. I used a mixture of sharp shredded cheddar and the processed cheese. Also added a dash of worcheshire sauce. It is also so much easier to put everything into a food processor. Try adding some jalepenos in with it too to make it spicy.

Tasty! I used shredded Cheddar, because I'm not a fan of processed cheese, and it turned out great,considerably better the next day..

I made these as finger sandwiches for a potluck.  I ended up with about 30, 1/4 slice sandwiches with enough for a hearty whole sandwich for myself! I added a full tsp of cayenne, and 1/2 tsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added a few dashes of paprika for added color and smokiness. I went with the shredded cheese instead of cheese food and it was awesome. Yummy!

Good.  Has just the right amount of kick to the dip.  Next time I may use sour cream and grated instead of shredded cheese.  I used regular cheddar in this recipe.

This is simple to make and delicious. 
This is great as a sandwich, spread on 
crackers or with celery sticks.  We love the kick from the cayenne pepper.

I've been making this recipe for the holidays since about 2005 and it is a family favorite. We like it extra spicy so I always up the spice. My husband and I lived in Scotland for a while and we couldn't find pimentos there, so we made it with fresh red chili peppers and it was divine. I cannot thank you enough to this. It has brought years of yummy holiday memories to my family.

I am from the South and we love our pimento cheese y'all.  I use sharp cheddar and grate it myself in the food processor.  Do not use the preshreded cheese in a package from the grocery store.-it has cornstarch in it to keep it from sticking together. Yuck !  i use lots of pimento and also some lemon pepper and a little garlic powder. Try it !

I’ve made this many times over the last few years, with lots of raves from my friends and family.  The only change I make is I use mild cheddar cheese because I can not find grated American cheese in my food stores.

Love, Love Pimento Cheese Spread and this is just right. If I made a larger batch, I'd eat it all so I like this size of recipe. It is as good or better than the boughten stuff. I didn't change a thing except to use bagged shredded Cheddar.

I made this by the recipe:  for me, there was not enough pimento flavor and I did not care for the processed cheese.
Next time, I shredded block sharp cheddar cheese and used a 4-oz jar of pimentos, adding about 1/2 the pimento juice to the mixture.  I let the cheese mixture sit refrigerated overnight.  Loved it!  My friends finished it off so quickly that I wished I had doubled the recipe.

Very, very good, but I needed to add some diced jalapenos to give it more flavor. I also used  cheddar instead of American (personal preference). Served it on Ritz crackers, but would be good with Fritos Scoops, too. Will make again.

I've made this a couple of times and I think I like it best when I use a variety of cheese (at least three) for the processed cheese portion.  But it is still delicious as is.  I reduced the cayenne for my kids and they still thought it was too spicy, so the next batch I didn't use it and it was great without it (though personally I liked the kick.)  While at my parents recently, my son commented that the pimento cheese my dad has "wasn't as good as Mommy makes."  That's the highest compliment!

The Cadillac pimento & cheese was very good!  The only thing I changed was to add over a half cup of extra cheese...it was a bit too creamy at first.  Next time I think I may cut back just a bit on the mayo and use cheddar instead of velveeta.  I liked the velveeta but I think the cheddar, as some other people have used, will create a great flavor. But the recipe as written is very good, just with more cheese!  Thanks for sharing!

I am rating this as fairly as possible because I used sharp cheddar in place of the processed cheese, because I just don't like it. It is delicious with the sharp cheddar, and was much better after sitting overnight. The onion powder and dash of garlic powder are a very tasty addition. Thanks for the recipe!

I am a HUGE pimento cheese fan!  This recipe is easy and oh so yummy!  I have to double this recipe when I make it at my house.  I use part sharp shredded cheddar cheese and part mild shredded cheddar.  I add a fresh ground pepper and have used hot sauce in the past when I do not have any cayenne pepper on hand.  Absolutely awesome!  I like to eat mine with celery!

So delicious, it makes the store-bought obsolete! I made the following substitutions to make it lower in fat/calories: shredded 2% cheddar cheese for velveeta, fat free mayo, and lowfat cream cheese. It turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy to make. Used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light mayo to reduce fat and everyone still raved about it. Would make again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, even the pickiest members!  I followed the recipe exactly, however I found that I had to microwave the spread in order for it to spread.  Will definitely make again.  Really good on crackers.

This is wonderful! I have done as others suggested and used a bag of shredded cheese. I have made this several times now and each time I make it, it is gobbled up fast. Thanks!

REALLY tasty cheese spread.  Because of the saltiness of the cheese and the salt that's in mayonnaise, I like the spread best on bread, toast, or celery/carrot sticks.  Most chips/crackers would add too much salty flavor.  I like using half Velveeta and half mild Cheddar.  Yum.

This is absolutely wonderful and reminded me of my Nanny's Pimento Cheese spread.  I don't care for Velveeta cheese food, I used shredded Cheddar Cheese, and it was perfect.
