These sound great.  My son loves cinnamon, sugar and white bread.  These sound great.  The intro says something about dipping them in egg.  The recipe doesn't mention that step.  Could someone help me out please?

Not bad, but not impressed enough to try them again.  Messy to prepare.

I made these for a bridal shower and they went quickly. The smell is also very enticing. As a variation, I cut the rolls into slices making small pinwheels.

I had this recipe at my grandparents and they were AMAZING!  So I made them at home.  To die for...although one small hint, make sure to roll out the bread first, makes it SOOO much easier to spread and roll them for freezing.

Delicious!! I didn't change a thing about this recipe and found it fantastic (as did my entire brunch group). The only tip I would give, as someone did before me, is to make sure the bread/cream cheese mixture is rolled first before coating in cinnamon sugar. This prevents almost all the mess than if you try to complete roll by roll. I also pressed down the bread slightly after cutting off the crusts to obtain a tighter roll.

Wonderful little treat! I made these up yesterday and put them in the freezer overnight, and they cooked up perfectly without even thawing first, of which I was skeptical, but it worked! Super simple to make these and they were delicious too! Thanks!!!

I used our local markets firm white sandwich bread from our bottom shelf...inexpensive...however, I did use only one package of softened cream cheese and one egg yolk with unsalted butter instead of margerine.  They went VERY quickly.  Made another batch last week and left out the cinnamon but used strawberry flavored cream cheese...YUM!!!  Thank you for the recipe.

Very easy to prepare, kind of messy. I found I had a lot of filling left when I used the 2 packs of cream cheese, maybe use only 1 and a half packages for less extra filling!

This is very good, a favorite of ours.  Most recipes suggest rolling bread out flat with rolling pin, I prefer that method. It's much easier and looks better.
Either way, the roll-ups disappear quickly.
