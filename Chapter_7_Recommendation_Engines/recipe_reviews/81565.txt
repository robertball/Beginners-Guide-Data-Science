This is a wonderful salad and very forgiving as you can add almost any fruit to it and it still comes out superb!  Try adding mandarin oranges - you won't be disappointed.....  Side note:  A little oily for my taste so will probably cut back on the amount of oil called for next time!

AWESOME is the only way to describe this salad.  I have brought it to many social events and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews, looks very pretty and many requests for a copy.    My "tweeks" include:  Spread the cashews on a foil lined cookie sheet and bake @ 350 degree for 10-15 minutes until lightly toasted/browned.  Saves time, uneveness and greater chance of burning when cooking on stove.  I cut back the olive oil to 1/3 cup (use very high quality olive oil) and maple bacon.  I use a whole pear sliced then cut each slice into halves or thirds, depending on how large the pear is, and toss.  For a more formal presentation, toss the greens with the vinagrette, place on a decorative plate, then sprinkle with the bacon, grapes & pears, leaving pears in slices vs cutting in pieces and fan out in a circular pattern.  Use a firm pear and make sure to wait until the very end to add the pears to prevent browning.  If desired, blue cheese, roquefort or gorgonzola sprinkles can also be added.  YUM!!

The thing that makes this salad awesome is the curried cashews...wow!!!!  I added some goat cheese and craisins as well.  A keeper!!!  Edit: After making this salad a bunch of times, I found that the dressing is best when cutting back to 1/4 cup olive oil (otherwise too oily tasting) and adding 1/2 tsp of paprika.  I also like to add fresh raspberries to the salad.  Good stuff!!

i have made this recipe multiple times over the summer and people always ask me for the recipe.  here are my changes: (1.) reduce oil to 1/3 cup (2.) use Bac-O's instead of bacon (for those who don't eat pork) (3.) use Maille brand dijon mustard (for those who don't want white wine in their mustard) (4.) bake the cashews for 9 mins at 350 degrees (they come out perfect and you don't have to stand over the stove) (5.) use a full cup of halved red grapes (6.) peel and slice up an entire bosc pear  --- so delicious!

This is an absolutely amazing salad! The blend of flavors is very creative and super delicious. My husband and I ate it all in one sitting! I didn't have fresh rosemary and used dry instead. There was a lot of dressing left over. The next time I make this I'll only make half the dressing. I'll also try adding some goat cheese.

This salad is awesome!! I had it at my Mom's house and everyone loved it. This recipes is missing a few ingrediants compared to our recipe. For the dressing we put in 3 tbls toasted sesame seeds and 1 teasp. minced garlic. It also suggests you use peanut oil if you have it in place of the olive or veg. oil. With these extra ingrediants I give this recipe a 5 or in my rating system a 10. Second note: Try including Arugula (rocket) in your salad mix. It has a great nutty flavor when it is picked young and will really compliment the flavors in the rest of the salad.

This was a delicious salad!  My husband and I both enjoyed it!  We made a few changes.  I noticed that we were out of curry powder so I used lemon pepper, which turned out great on the cashews and worked well with the salad.  We also used veggie bacon.  My husband had his with chicken, which makes it a great main dish salad!  We will make this again!!

Concept is good; execution -- not so much. Came out *way* too sweet for my taste; I like a salad that tastes like vegetables, not dessert. Halve the honey and oil, and eschew the brown sugar entirely. Another reviewer's suggestion to add goat cheese was right on. It lends a nice tang to the dish.

I'm dying to give this recipe a 5, but I can't quite do it. The overall flavors are awesome - the dressing goes beautifully with the sweet curried cashew mix and the saltiness of the bacon (yes, goat cheese would be nice). I felt there was quite a bit more olive oil called for than needed, so I cut it back to about 1/4C. Next time I would mix the buuter, sugar, etc. in a pan over med-low heat to get a good caramel going; as written, the sugar and butter tend to clump together and don't want to coat the nuts as I believe was intended. All in all, this is an excellent salad. I would definitely make it again with these very minor changes. Thanks!!

Wow!  The bold flavors in this are awesome!  If you are a fan of Indian cuisine at all, you will love this salad.  Relatively simple.  I cheated with precooked bacon and two bags of lettuce.  It took me two tries to get a handle on toasting the cashews, but well worth it.  Low low heat I think for those.  My new summer picnic salad.  The fruit balances the zap of the the cayenne and curry.  A meal in itself.  Go for it!

This is crazy-stupid-g-o-o-d! My tennis team hosted playoffs and this salad received so many kudos from some very seasoned women chefs slash athletes.  I added carrot shavings to give it a tad more color. Thank you for sharing!  XOXO.

I made this for a party this weekend and it was a big hit. Here are the modifications I made to the recipe. I used pancetta instead of regular bacon----it is leaner and has a mild flavor.I think it is "meatier" than bacon. I used white balsamic pear infused vineagar and half the olive oil (as suggested by other reviewers)  in the dressing. I also added goat cheese. I didn't dress the salad--left dressing on the side. Everyone loved it. I will make this one over and over again.

Best salad I've EVER made - and I've made some good salads.  :)  That nut mixture is to die for!  It's unusual and for me that is a very big plus - I really get bored with the same thing all the time.  I won't use this too often bec/ I don't want me or others to get tired of it - but I know when I do make it, guests are going to love it. (I made it for a group of people with fairly conservative tastes and without exception they all liked it.)  EDIT: Made again - for a group of people who like to try different things and they loved it as much as I do. If I could give a 10, I would!

This was good - the cashew mix was certainly interesting - I'm still wondering if I liked it as much as I wanted to.  No complaints from those I served it to but no one went gaga over it either.

This salad is delicious! It's a great mix of sweet and spicy and is quite a complex blend of flavours. I've taken it a few times to potluck dinners and it received rave reviews and requests for repeats and recipes. Can't beat that with a bucket of R's. The only modifications I made were to leave out the bacon, and to use roasted unsalted cashews so that toasting them was unnecessary. I also used cider vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar as that's what I had. This definitely goes in my list of favourites.

Lessons learned: walnuts are NOT a substitute for cashews in this salad. Aside from that, the salad was good... but I thought the bacon was a bit much and the dressing really, really vinegary. Reducing vinegar to 1 Tblsp and oil to 2 Tblsp next time.

I was asked to bring a salad to our Home Group & wanted something fall-ish when I came upon this recipe.  I'm not fond of Honey-Mustard dressing/dips nor of curry, so I decided to tweek this a bit, using many other reviews as a guide.  The result was really good & I know my husband will like it because the cashews ended up being pretty spicy!  So, here's what I did: I used 1 1/4 cups cashews, substituted Lemon Pepper for the Curry Powder; also roasted the cashews in the oven @ 350 for 10-15 mins.  Increased the Bacon to 6 slices & always cook my bacon in the microwave about 1 min per slice for the crispiest bacon!  For the dressing I wanted to be sure to have plenty, so I used 6 T. Vinegar; 1/2 C Honey; & kept the oil at 1/2 C. For the seasoning, I used 2 T Ground Dry Mustard powder (rather than the Dijon); 2 t. Poppy Seeds; 1 t. Sea Salt; 1/2 t. Black Pepper; 1 t. Paprika.  It had a "kick", but nothing like the Cashews! I also added 1/2 C Cranraisins; 1 Lg Can Mandarine Oranges, drained; & 1 tub of Feta Cheese to the salad.  I chose to dice the pear, rather than slicing it.  I also only had Romaine, but would love to have added other greens, as I'm sure it would be even tastier!  (I actually did only a test-run-taste for myself, so I don't know how others will like it, but I will give an update as soon as I have it.  I liked it & I'm pretty picky, so I'm sure it will be a hit!)  I've also renamed it: "Fall Festival Salad w/ Spicy Cashews & Honey-mustard-Poppy seed Dressing"!

With regard to the cashews: I like subtle Indian flavors, so intead of the curry powder I used 1/2 t. garam masala and 1/2 t. tandoori masala with only 1/8 t. cayenne.  The cashews were WONDERFUL--even plain.

This salad was a great change of pace and was relatively easy to make.  I would definitely make it again - even my mother-in-law enjoyed it and she is a very simple eater who doesn't like to try too many things outside of what she knows.  Next time I would decrease the dijon in the dressing b/c the taste was too strong for my liking.

I was uncertain about trying this for the first time for a family picnic, but thanks to the other reviews, I was convinced I had to try it.  And I am sure glad I did!!!  I love the unique flavors and fruits combined with fresh salad greens.  Definitely adding to my recipe box!

This salad was SO great.  I loved all of the flavors.  I only used 1/4 cup olive oil and I would probably reduce the vinegar next time to 2 Tablespoons.  It's just my preference as the vinegar seemed to overtake the mustard and honey flavor.

I am definitely on the "awesome" train of thought over this, and I somehow didn't even notice that there was supposed to be bacon in it!  My other change, and I highly recommend it when they're in season, is that I substitute fresh peaches for the other fruit.  SO good!!

Six thumbs up!  I followed the recipe as written then added chicken breast pan fried with a bit of the dressing for flavor.  The addition of chicken was to satisfy my husband's need for protein; it was an amazing salad with or without the chicken.  Whenever I try a new recipe I ask whether it is a thumbs up recipe, that is, should I make it again or not?  The answer:  six thumbs up!

Delicious! I loved the cashews & so did my parrot!  I was worried about the rosemary, but loved the taste it added. I went a little "light" on the spices, but used the full amount of brown sugar.  I'll use the full amount of spices next time. I couldn't quit eating the nuts (so many I had to toast more!) Thanks for a different salad - I think grapes are a great summer ingredient!

This salad is AMAZING! I followed the recipe exact, with the exception of adding *more bacon* (I used a maple bacon, about hlaf of the pkg)... for convenience I toasted the cashews in the oven at 350 for just over 10 minutes while I cooked the bacon. The dressing is very good! it would also be a great basting sauce for chicken or pork on the grill... It is a impressive salad, with a bit of a spicy kick. I tossed the salad with the nuts/dressing, but left the pears out. I put the salad on each plate, then added the pears in slices ontop of each serving.. about 3 fanned-out slices. makes for a nice presentation. Served the salad with 'Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks' from this site and mini roasted potatoes. the salad went FAST.. people were squabbeling over who got the last bit.. excellent, thanks so much!! definite keeper :))

Very good, but too salty for my taste. Next time, I'll cut the salt to 1/4 tsp, maybe even just 1/8 tsp... I used a whole pear and 1/3 cup crasins instead of grapes. I also added 1/3 cup feta cheese.

I made this salad for a pot luck at work and everyone loved it.  I toasted the cashews in the oven, reduced the oil  and added dried cranberries.  The flavors were amazing!  I can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving!

A friend served this at a dinner party and my husband and I thought it was delicious, so I made it for my vegetarian daughter and son-in-law the following week.  They think it is the BEST salad they have ever tasted!  I have made it two more times, once without currying the cashews for picky eaters who thought it was wonderful.  I did not have any grapes the last time I made it so used nectarines I had on hand and they were terrific.  I apprecited the comment about toning down the spices for people who are not as into ethnic flavors as we are.  Will definitely make this salad again and again.

This salad was tasty enough, quick and easy to make, so I guess I'll give it 4 stars. Frankly though, I don't see what all the hype is about. It's good but it isn't THAT good. Everyone that tasted it felt the same, and couldn't care less whether or not I make it again. Oh well.

Oh my.  This is fantastic- the cashews send this over the edge!  I did omit the bacon (not a fan of that texture in salad( and instead of white wine vinegar I used balsamic vinegar (same measurement) and instead of olive oil I used vegetable oil.  YUM!  I will make this again!!

I made this for a church gathering, and got raves from everyone. The dish came home empty - so it doesn't get any better than that. The only change was using an apple instead of pear. This is definitely a keeper.

Everyone loved this.  The nuts were the biggest hit, followed by the dressing.  I cut the curry powder and cayenne in half because I'm a spice whimp.  Folks commented that the nuts are good enough to make and serve as a party snack all by themselves.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Good! I liked it a lot! The nuts had a good taste to them (maybe a tad too spicy for me, but I'm a major wimp when it comes to spices) and worked well with the grape + pear combo. Yum!

Dude. I have 5 boys to feed and they LOVED this salad! It tastes like Summertime! I copied other reviewers and only used 1/4 cup olive oil -  it was plenty. This will go on our menu AT LEAST monthly. Just REALLY a good salad!

I love this dish! I'm a huge fan of spicy foods and the cashews added the kick to the salad while the fruit balanced it out. I used veggie bacon (faken) as well as some veggie chicken. I also added some apple slices and dried pomegranate cranberries. The recipe on its own was wonderful. My addition to it was solely based on my taste. Kudos to the chef!

So yummy! This is going to become a regular in our house. I substituted Morningstar meatless bacon for the real stuff, since we're vegetarians--it worked well. Served with the Curried Butternut Squash and Pear Soup from this site.

Awesome!! I used sunflower seeds instead of cashews and turkey sausage instead of bacon (that's what I had on hand) and boy was it good!  This salad has the perfect combination of spicy and tart, soft and crunchy.  Even my husband (who isn't exactly a salad lover) went back for seconds.  Bravo!! :)

Thank you, Christya!

Like so many cooks, I changed ingredients to suit my needs.  I don't eat mammals, so there was no bacon or meat substitute in mine.  All the other substitutions were based on what was in my pantry: instead of cashews, I used walnuts; instead of rosemary, I used tarragon (dried!); instead of kosher salt I used regular salt.  And it was delicious!  Next time I'll try it with the original ingredients (except for the bacon), and I bet that'll be delicious as well!  It was surprisingly easy and quick to make (and clean up after, although that might not be the case with the bacon).  Worthy of being on a menu at a nice restaurant.  I'll make it at my next social gathering, and I know everyone will be impressed.

We are always looking for different salads to eat and this one was just perfect.  I shook my head when I saw the ingredients for the cashews but I followed to a "T" and they were amazing!  Dressing was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - will definitely be having over and over again!

This was good but some bites had a very strong flavor of something not so great.  I think it was maybe too much curry on the cashews.  I will definitely try it again and update my rating if it's better.  The pear was a great touch and next time I will use at least 2.

Made this for a block party over the 4th of July weekend.  Turned out very well.  I used red wine vinegar because thats all I had in the cupboard.  It was a big hit and it was the only healthy dish at the table.  I quadrupled the recipe and it was gone within 30 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a very nice salad, but I wouldn't slice the pears too thinly. They got a little soggy in my salad. I didn't slice the grapes. The fresh rosemary probably could have been substituted for dry to make one less item from the store. Otherwise, a fine blend of tastes for my dinner party.

It was excellent.  I added a little chicken to it to make a main meal.  So many salads taste the same after a while but the taste & texture was deliciously unique!  It will be a great salad when we have guests!

This is excellent!  I thought it would fall flat with so few ingrediants but I was so wrong.  I toasted the cashews in the oven and everything came out perfect.

Stellar!! I'm a vegan so I substituted agave nectar for the honey and left out the bacon but added about 1 tsp. of liquid smoke to the dressing and used vegan margarine instead of butter. The candied cashews are amazing on their own but may be too spicy for some guests (I suggest cutting the amount of cayenne in half).

Oh my gosh is this good!  I did make a few changes.  I left out the bacon as it seems a bit too much here.  I melted the butter in a small pan then added the cashews, curry powder, brown sugar and cayenne.  I substituted fresh basil for rosemary,then let it all come together.  The kitchen smelled heavenly!  Also added a bit of chopped fresh basil to the salad so every few bites you get this hit of basil with grape or pear.  Please give that a try, it really is fantastic.  This is going in regular rotation and can't wait to spring it on my MIL!

This was an excellent salad. I loved all the different textures and flavors in this and how well they all went together. The salad dressing wasn't much by itself but it was mellow and sweet and paired so well with the hot spicy cashews. I used bacon flavored bits instead. I cut the olive oil in half for the dressing and used red curry powder for the cashews. Boy were they ever hot and spicy! The sweet dressing cools their heat some. This is restaurant quality. So delicious.

The different flavors in this recipe are great! The cashews are pretty delicious, I may consider just making them separate to snack on! My only complaint is the salad-to-dressing ratio. Needs either more salad or less dressing.

Really delicious!  Hubby and I just had it for lunch.    The only downside for me is that this is a labor-intensive salad so I will simplify the dish next time.  The bacon didn't add much so will leave that off in the future.  Next time I'll use the butter for toasting the cashews and save a step that way.   Used balsamic vinegar, vegetable oil, and regular mustard cause they were on hand and they worked fine.

We loved this salad, but next time will make two changes.  First, this is a very flavorful salad and I didn't think bacon was really necessary.  I never really tasted it in the salad (and this is coming from someone that believes everything is better with bacon).  Second, I'm not a huge fan of curry.  Next time I will eliminate this and I think it will be just as tasty without it.  Thanks, we will make this many more times.

I served this salad at a recent luncheon and it was the best.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and I wouldn't change a thing about it.
The salad can be presented beautifully...i.e. fan 3 or 5 thinly sliced pear slices on the top before serving.

I thought this salad was really strong. It's good, but strong. I served it with Macadamia encrusted sea bass in mango cream sauce and it over-powered the fish dish. DH liked it, but I think that if I make it again I will need to cut down on the cayenne pepper a bit. The fruit cuts some of the spiciness, but it was still too strong for me.

This salad was a hit at our dinner party. I substituted real bacon bits for the bacon to save time and so I didn't have to dirty another pan. Highly recommended.

Good Salad did not care for the dressing.  Probably better with a vinagrette. Cut the salt in half when making the cashews.

This is sooooo good!  I used half the olive oil called for as some people suggested.  I also baked the cashews on a cookie sheet at 350F for about 6 minutes or until the spice and sugar mixture bubbled.  YUM!

I made this salad for my Red Hat group last night, and received rave reviews! It was delicious, and the cashews were good enough to eat for an appetizer! In fact, that's what some ladies did; I left the salad undressed, and had guests add their own dressing and then top it with the curried cashews, so the cashews were there for the nibbling! 

After reading review suggestions, I included all recipe ingredients, and decided to add mandarin oranges, goat cheese, and dried cherries.  I noticed that several reviewers thought the dressing had too much oil, or too much vinegar. I thought it was perfect, as is. I think the secret is lightly dressing it, rather than drowning it in all the dressing. I always get my dressing on the side when eating out, and serve salad that way at home, also. Now I have leftovers for this evening! I'll just add some grilled chicken, and be good to go!

I probably won't make this oftn, but I did enjoy it. I will try substituting almonds for the cashews and reducing the oil in the dressing.

Yummy!!!  The only thing I did different was use lemon pepper instead of curry powder as someone else had mentioned in a review - I'm not a curry fan.  My nine year old son said it was the best salad ever!

Fabulous!  Very flavorful. Almonds instead of cashews.  Added blue cheese and sesame seed. Go easier on the dijon next time.
Joe likes, but doesn't love.  Actually likes the nuts!

This is a fantastic salad.  I had made the cashew mixture a few hours ahead of time and put it in the refrigerator, and that may have made the butter harden up, because when I went to put the salad together, the cashew mixture looked a bit dry and "goopy".  I added a tiny amount of water and microwaved the whole mixture for about 25 seconds, stirred it up, and the problem was solved -- the cashews looked fresh and golden again.

Too much dressing and the curried cashews were too strong.  Would be better to add more greens to dilute the flavor.

No one would ever call this salad boring!  The flavors are amazing.  I will cut the dressing in half next time and probably go a little easier on the cayenne (what I buy is very strong!).  My mouth is burning right now, but I will definitely make it again.

I added cooked chicken to make this a main course.  The chicken helped take some of the edge off--the flavor of the spices may have been too strong otherwise.  I will definitely make this again, but will be selective about who I serve it to.

This recipe is great. I even got my mom to try and like something curried! I don't bother with the bacon and it is super easy to pack a container of the cashew spices, add a little butter, microwave and then shake it to coat the nuts. Easy, creative salad to bring for lunch at work.

This salad was so good, I had to make it again and keep it to myself. The nuts are great and are even better when you play around with the spices a little. I now make larger batches of the nuts to snack on. But best in the salad combination!

This was just delicious! I didn't make the dressing as I had a newman's honey mustard dressing in the house and I only had turkey bacon in the house. I also added some seasoned grilled chicken to this to make this a complete meal, with a garlic cheese breadstick on the side. I can't wait to have the leftovers!

What a unique salad! I toasted the cashews in the oven at 350 spraying Pam on it first and sprinkling them with curry and chili powder to give them an extra kick. I also added craisins, feta and had some fresh corn (sliced from the cob)to sprinkle on as well. Awesome!

Wow- this was a very good and different salad!  I made it twice, once with the required ingredients and the second time with 1/4 of the butter in an attempt to make it more healthy.  You need the butter!  It cuts the vinegar and spices just perfectly enough.  Wonderful salad- not many times you can day that.

Everyone loved this salad. I used pistachio nuts because that is what I had on hand. Next time I may not add the bacon. I don't think it made that big of a difference in the taste, so why not make things easier. I'll be serving this one again for sure!

Yum!  Pretty simple to make.  I added the nuts before tossing - which I will not do again.  Every bite of the salad was super spicy.  Next time, I'll add the nuts after tossing and some more grapes.  Anyways, absolutely delish.

This was a great salad.  One thing to note, the dry ingredients for the cashews should be mixed first, then pour the melted butter over the nuts, then pour the dry ingredients over the nuts.  When I mixed it all at the same time, the great seasoning clumped together because of the butter, instead of coating the nuts well.  Super tasty still!

I have to agree this salad is wonderful. I took it to a dinner party and we all loved it. I used balsalmic vinegar in the dressing because it is what i had. Will be making again. The nuts were perfect.They made the salad, I don't like spicy hot and they were perfect.

This salad is absolute perfection. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit.  I was a little bummed out by how much of a hit, I was hoping people wouldn't eat it so there would be more for me :)

WOW.  Wouldn't change a thing, loved every part of it and my poor husband didn't eat any dinner, just salad and ate so much he was stuffed!  It got better with every bite.  If anyone knows how to make the curry mix stick to the cashews, please let me know!  I plan to make that up and store it in a container for use anytime!  YUMMMMM

This was SOOOO good!  We used 1/4 oil for the dressing and it would have been really tasty with goat cheese.  My husband even said that this is the kind of salad you serve for company.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Served this at a potluck and everyone loved it!  Conversations would stop just to complement the salad and a couple of people asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper.

This salad is awesome.  I was at first a
little leary because of the ingredients.  Wasn't sure if my family would like it.  Boy was I surprized! They ate every bit of it and asked for more.  Definitely a keeper.

This salad is INCREDIBLE!  Here are the slight modifications I made:  used green leaf lettuce, and added 1/4 c oil, instead of 1/2 c.  I made this for just my husband and I, and we ate the entire bowl!  We actually wanted to lick the dressing out of the bottom.  Oh, I did add a whole pear, and some extra grapes b/c we like lots of yummies in our salads.  I will definitely make this again!

Incredible salad dish. Only changes were the use of dry Rosemary instead of fresh (couldn't find any), and doubling the coating for the cashews as well as the dressing. Although I love 'sweet', the doubling of the brown sugar made it a little too sweet. Next time, I'll halve the sugar. GREAT salad!

WOW!!  This was much better than I was expecting!  I left out the bacon, added grilled chicken, and used only about half the amount of olive oil.  This is definitely a salad that will impress company.

One of the best salads I've had in a while. Great flavor combinations. I agree that a bit less oil should be used in the dressing.

AWESOME! I made a few changes that were suggested: cut the oil to 1/4 and it probably was still too much; cut the pepper to 1/4 t., but probably will use less next time; used the whole pear and added a few more grapes. I poured some dressing on the salad before serving. One son added more. Next time I'll skip the bacon - loved it but it would be great without and adds more mess, trouble and calories. I may try adding chicken, goat cheese and paprika like other suggested. Thanks for an amazing salad!

Excellent.  I followed other readers' recommendations and decreased the pepper greatly and reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup and added goat cheese.  I used store bought bacon crumbles and decided I prefer the salad without bacon.  I used Planter's lightly salted cashews and found 1/2 tsp of salt to be too much and I will leave it out next time.  I am looking forward to sharing this salad at summer reunions.

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  I did not change a thing, though in future I think I would cut down on the oil in the dressing just a bit.  Great taste and the cayenne gives it just the right amount of bite.

The reviews are on target. This salad is really, really good. Three of us ate the entire thing which is supposed to serve eight. The dressing would be delicious on any salad - that recipe alone is worth keeping. This is a winner.

This was SO wonderful!!!!!  Everyone loved it - even people who aren't real fond of salads had seconds.  Incredible flavor!  I tried it with and without the bacon and personally think it's just as good without it.  Thanks!

Took this salad to a party and was asked for the recipe.  I added bleu cheese and doubled the salad dressing portion.  Really enjoyed the spiced cashew topping.

This was really good and I would not have thought to mix these flavors.  I just used store-bought, lite, honey-mustard dressing because I'm lazy and added blue cheese for some pizzazz.

I stay true to this recipe with exception of leaving out the rosemary, I’m not a fan.  I’ve been making this salad for my family for years, it’s frequently requested and is definitely our favorite salad.

Great salad!  didn't have any pears so I used a Granny Smith apple.  Am making a big batch of nuts that I am going to spread out and roast in the oven to add to salads & buddha bowls!  Everyone really loved this twist on a green salad to accompany dinner!

I added fresh greens the second day to freshen it up and it was still great. Make it!

Made it without bacon and still loved it.  Used whole pear and a few extra grapes.  Volume of dressing was a little more then I personally care for.  I would reduce a bit next time.

I found it too spicy & will reduce the cayenne pepper to less than 1/4 tsp. next time. Dressing made enough for twice the amount of greens.  It was a pretty salad that was very tasty.  There were no leftovers.

I love this salad, although it is a bit fussy to make, I found I can do the nut mixture ahead of time, and refrigerate, then warm in the microwave just slightly before putting over the greens.  I used 1/2 the cayenne pepper for our tastes.

This is delicious!  I used Harry & David pears so it was especially good.  The only change I made was to reduce the cayenne to 1/8 -1/4 tsp since I like less heat.

This turned out so beautifully! The only change I made was the type of vinegar I used. I had an orange muscat champagne vinegar and it paired excellent with everything! The cashews were out of this world! Everyone loved them, this salad was paired with a fabulous semi dry white wine and it won out on the pairings for the wine dinner I hosted! I even had extra cashews leftover that I placed on the charcuterie board! They were delicious!!

I doubled the pear and grapes, and halved the greens and only tossed in half the dressing (I made the full batch of dressing to be used later this week in another salad).   This is a delicious recipe with just the right amount of heat.   Yum!

Updated:  I tossed the cashews with the melted butter to completely coat them, then sprinkled in the sugar/spices/rosemary mixture.  This gave me a much better results and prevented the big clumps of butter/spices.

I followed the directions exactly and only used spinach.  It was excellent!  Husband loved it also!!  I didn't put all of the cashews on the salad because I thought they may be too spicy.  Nope!  Husband ate the rest of them out of the bowl.  Next time I'll make more, and I may just make the cashews for snacking or for other salads.  Great recipe!!! Thanks   :-)

This is definitely a keeper. I should have read the reviews first that would have saved time in the preparation. For example, using  the oven instead of doing the cashews on the stove top. Next time I'll use the microwave for cooking the bacon using paper towel under and over the strips to soak up the oil as it cooks. This is my new favourite salad.

Loved this!  Disagreed that it was too sweet as some suggested.   The cayenne pepper offset  any sweetness.  Wish I had had goat cheese in the house, as I definitely would have given that a try.
I didn't add salt or pepper to the salad dressing, though I generally do.  I tasted it and decided since bacon was in  the salad it wasn't necessary for my taste.  Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic salad! I served it with goat cheese instead of bacon. Along side Jay’s Jerk chicken and a Jamaican curry, this salad took the meal to a whole new level!

I came upon this recipe a few years back and it looked worth trying (even though it's a more complicated recipe than I usually take on- I guess I'm lazy lol-- it promised a celebration of flavors).
I made it as written, with one caveat: I'm not find of pears at all, so I substitute apple.
This salad is definitely worth the time it takes to make! Rave reviews and pleas for the recipe every single time I bring it to a meal. Enjoy!

This was almost like eating a CPK salad. Really good & not as tedious as copycat CPK recipes.  Dressing was easy. Ina Garten has similar cashew recipe, but I liked the curry powder this called for. Chicken instead of bacon made this a meal that everyone liked.

This is an amazing salad, great flavors and healthy. No changes yet, its pretty  perfect as is. You could use pecan nuts I guess.
Quick and easy to prepare. My favorite salad at the moment.

I took others suggestions, used a can of mandarin oranges instead of pears, did not use sugar on the nuts and used less oil and honey in the dressing.  I served it to the family for Fathers Day and everyone loved it.  I had extra dressing and gave it  to my niece and her husband to use up.  They were thrilled.

I loved the spiced nuts, but though they kind of fought with the flavors in the salad.  Next time I will use plain toasted or candied nuts.  And I'll save the recipe for the nuts and make them for snacking -- delish!

liked it, used roasted salted cashews and didn't need to add any salt to the seasoning mix.  Decreased the oil to 1/4 cup.  Doubled the recipe and definitely didn't need to double the dressing

Great salad - lots of raves and yes, someone did ask for the recipe!  The only change I made was I added blue cheese crumbles to the salad.  It just felt like it was crying out for them.
My wife wants me to make it again and add some grilled chicken and have it as a dinner.  Seems like a good idea to me.

I have made this a couple of times now, once for a pot luck and once while entertaining guests. It has turned out fantastic both times. People who love spicy foods really enjoy the spiced nuts, and those who are a little less keen to spice don't find it to hot. I do find the dressing recipe makes about double the amount I need so I don't put it all in, I dress it a little lighter and have the dressing available if someone wants a bit more. I buy the freshest looking salad mix at the store and have found it to taste great on different mixes, not just the one specified.

Lovely refreshing salad.  I omitted the mustard from the dressing and used orange infused vinegar.  Be careful cooking the nuts so they don't burn.  Pecans can be substituted for cashews.

Delicious and easy to make. Love the curried cashews, it adds a nice little "spice" to balance the overall sweetness of the salad.

Everyone at two different dinner parties loved this when I made it. I did make changes: I did not add honey to the dressing b/c I used a champagne vinegar which had plenty of sweetness for us. I added more pear and some avocado instead of grapes. I also added dried cranberries and feta cheese.

My dinner guests loved this delicious and different salad.  Minor changes: In the brown sugar mixture I reduced the kosher salt and cayenne to 1/4 tsp each (if using salted cashews I would suggest NO added salt).  I added a pinch of salt and about 1/2 tsp grated ginger to the dressing. Suggest making the dressing a day ahead if possible, since the flavors seemed to develop better after sitting at room temp.

Excellent salad.  The contrast between the savory cashews, sweet fruit and fresh greens is wonderful.  We had this with two different holiday meals, one with beef Wellington and the other traditional turkey, this salad paired well with both.  I made it with pears once and used grapes and apples the other time.  Bacon was omitted once and it is good either way.  I look forward to trying different combinations in the future, but pears will be hard to beat.  Also, the dressing is a good light dressing for a simple lettuce salad.

Everyone loved, although I tweaked it a bit after reading the suggestions below. Did not add sugar as I did not want it too sweet. Also added half the olive oil, used coconut vinegar instead white wine vinegar. And yes the dressing was a tad too much. Awesome salad; will make again!

My spouse said it was the best salad she has ever ate! I didn't add as much brown sugar as there is already enough sweetness in the salad.  I added red chili flakes simply because I didn't have  cayenne on hand.

This is an excellent salad.  Sometimes I mix up the fruit depending on what I have or omit the bacon depending on the day but it is always tasty. Always get positive comments when I take it to a potluck.

Loved this salad.  I made it several times and I prefer it without the bacon.  I also used half the oil as recommended.  Really nice with plain or flavored chicken.   Key to the salad are the seasoned cashews and the salad dressing. Everything else can be mixed and matched.

Absolutely amazing.  The seasoning on the nuts really adds interest and the combination of salty with the sweet fruit is delicious.

Would recommend placing fruit on top in a decorative fashion as it tends to migrate toward the bottom if tossed into the salad

This is an outstanding salad!  A perfect balance of flavors, from the wonderful curried cashews, to the juicy pears and perfect dressing!  This is a STAND OUT recipe and I'm sorry I let it sit so long in my recipe box before making it!  Thanks for sharing this gem, CHRISTYN!

Great recipe that is gobbled up at every party I take it to.  The cashews really make the dish, I could eat them on their own though!  I find that I have to taste the dressing and adjust the vinegar, adding 2 or 3 more Tbs as needed.  I used Baltic Curry, precooked thick bacon, the whole pear and a full cup of grapes as other reviewers did.  I did use only half of the amount of salad since my salad bowl was not huge, but it was perfect anyway.

Wow, what a salad! The layers of flavors make the combination mouth-wateringly delicious. I also reduced the olive oil to around 1/4 cup (there's too much dressing for one bag of salad) and subbed dried thyme for rosemary, added a whole sliced pear, and left out the bacon. It was still amazing! I'd leave out the grapes next time, as they seemed unnecessary, or maybe add dried cranberries as someone else suggested. A totally wonderful holiday or winter salad.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving lunch at my office and it was a huge success. I used a mix of romaine and arugula, skipped the bacon and added crumbled Stilton cheese.  Also added toasted sesame seeds and garlic, as recommended, to the dressing, plus a touch of sesame oil.

This was okay, but a little spicy, (even for me) & I like spicy/hot foods!  Cut olive oil to 1/3 & kept everything else the same...even with this change I only needed 1/2 the dressing.  Overdone spice...might be better with less cayenne & subbing plain yellow mustard.  I was really looking forward to this salad, but think I'm moving on to something else.

Overall it was a delicious salad!  The only problem I had was the step to coat cashews.  I guess the melted butter got cool and it became more like paste rather than sauce.  Some cashews had more paste on them and much hotter!  I put the sign saying "Cashews may be very spicy hot!  Eat at your own risk!!" which people thought I was being funny.  I will definitely make this salad again!!  Thanks :-)

The cashew mix makes such a nice contrast to the sweetness of the fruit and tanginess of the dressing.  Everyone loved it, will definitely make again!

Wow! This has got to be just about the single best salad in the whole entire world.  I will definitely make it again, and again, and many more times after that.  I didn't have fresh Rosemary, so I used oregano instead.  It was delicious.  I would recommend doubling the seeds and making half of the dressing though. Great recipe!

I am not a big fan of curry or fruit in salads but this is my favorite salad! I have made it for two family get togethers and even the picky eaters loved it and went back for seconds and thrids. I only put a little dressing on the salad when tossing and put the rest in a decorative decanter and let everyone add their own dressing. I had lots of dressing left over but I kept it in the frig and have used it on other salads.

Very tasty salad.  Only need to use about half the dressing though.  Substituted dry roasted peanuts for the cashews.  Will try the cashews next time, but the peanuts were a comparable substitute.

This is one spicy, delicious salad!! I'm eating my second serving as I type. I omitted the bacon and followed others' suggestions and only used 1/4 cup olive oil. I've already phoned the husband to tell him he's in for a tasty treat when he gets home from work.

Doubled the recipe for a birthday BBQ and got great reviews. I think I could have cut down on the cayenne because with the amount it called for, it was a little too spicey for little ones but all the adults loved it. I also used half the oil.

Fabulous salad! I used walnuts instead of cashews & they worked just fine. My sister, who doesn't cook, asked for the recipe so she can top it w/ some rotissirie chicken & impress her boyfriend. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this salad.  I  made it with chicken and craisins instead of the bacon, grapes, and pears, but it still made an excellent main dish.  My husband thought it was a little too spicy so you might want to cut down the cayenne pepper if you don't like things too hot.  I loved it and will make it again for sure!

Had a potluck East Indian dinner with a dozen people. Everyone raved about this salad. It was a hit.

My best friend made this salad for me over the weekend and it is to die for. If there were 2nds I would have gone after them!

My vegetarian friends absolutely adore this dish when I make it for them without the bacon.  My meat-eating friends adore this salad when I make it for them with thick-sliced bacon.  Once I ran out of white wine vinegar/ fresh rosemary, so I substituted with rice vinegar and dried rosemary, and it was still quite good.
