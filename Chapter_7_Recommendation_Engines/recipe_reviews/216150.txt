I love corn nuts and was very interested in trying this recipe.  Unfortunately, it did not turn out AT ALL.   A number of the kernels popped during baking and ended up laying all over my oven floor.  The seasonings turned into a charred black coating.  That said, I still gave this recipe two stars instead of a flat zero.  I'm hoping the main problem was the high oven temperature.  When I roast pumpkin seeds, I use a 250 degree oven.  I think I'm going to try the hominy on that temperature and see if I get better results.  If so, I'll post again and let you know!

This was really tasty. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used less garlic and chili powder and added salt. I stirred every 10 minutes and they were done at about 40 minutes. I had 2 or 3 kernals pop , but nothing bad.  I'd say play with the seasonigns to suit your taste - and taste it before you roast it. If you don't like it before you roasted, you probably won't like it after. This does shrink down a LOT so I don't see how to get 6 servings out of this.. more like 2-3 :D

After reading the other reviews, I turned the oven temp down to 275 and slowly roasted the hominy for about an hour and they turned out crispy and delicious. I also subbed the vegetable oil for a combo of 1 tbsp butter melted with about a tbsp of olive oil. I added a dash of Worcestershire and Johnny's seasoning salt.  Great snack!

yes I  made it. It tuned out really well love the taste. Reminded me of corn nuts. I would of liked a heads up on it popping all over the oven lol. The only changes I made were to the seasoning I did seasoning salt, garlic powder, garlic granules, black pepper, cumin I didn't  add chilly powder.
Next time I'll  find some way to cover it so it gets crunchy  instead of soggy any clothes or tips on that.
any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Tasted good; popping was an issue. I stopped at 30 minutes and left them to cool. You can cover with parchment paper once they start popping.

Thought I would give this one a try because I love baked garbanzo beans.  This recipe is down right dangerous.  No indication that the hominy would POP!  All over my oven (burnt crispy mess to clean up), all over my kitchen - I had to send my three young children out when I took it out of the oven for fear they would get hit with hot oily hominy.

I followed a fellow reviewers recommendation about lowering the temperature. The hominy did not get crispy AT ALL .

Not a lot of flavor and it was really messy.
