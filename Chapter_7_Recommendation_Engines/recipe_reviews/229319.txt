I usually do tea with honey and lemon for sore throats this is a great option for when I'm out of decaf tea :) It's sweet and tasty.

This is the exact drink I make for my kids when they are sick. It's a great way to get fluids down as well as soothing a raging sore throat.

When I just recently had the flu, half apple juice and half water was the only thing I could drink. It was pretty much what I had for 3 days. I hadn't thought to add honey or lemon juice. I am leaving a review to bookmark this. It works well because it is less acidic then other drinks and easy on the stomach. I drank it warm and with ice, but preferred it cold. Doctors recommend juice be diluted for young children, because of the sugar, so mixing it with half water is a good idea anyway. I did that when I used to do daycare.

My 4 yr old loves this. And calling it a Teddy best juice is a definite bonus for him to want to drink it. He wanted 3 cups in a row he liked it so much. Thank you for the recipe!

My kids love this drink and it really does help make them feel better. Before finding this recipe, I always tried to get my daughter to drink hot lemon water with honey but she hated it. adding the Apple juice makes it more sweet so kids will drink it. And Apple juice has vitamins which is also great for your body to fight colds.
