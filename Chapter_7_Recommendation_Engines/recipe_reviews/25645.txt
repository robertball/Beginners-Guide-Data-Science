I have made this recipe twice now and while the flavor is great, I could not figure out why when I followed the directions exactly my rice was not fully cooked. Turns out, this recipe does not use enough liquid for the amount of rice needed. With rice you need a 1:2 ratio. So instead of 2 cups of broth you actually need 3 for the amount of rice needed in the recipe.

What a great and easy recipe! I used half turkey sausage and half shrimp. Didn't have the cajun seasoning so made due with what I had on hand. It was really good. There were no leftovers! Thanks!

I make this meal for my family all the time, and we love it!  Because I don't like spicy food, I make a few substitutions:

1.  smoked sausage for the hot turkey sausage
2.  Mexican-style diced tomatoes instead of the Italian style
3.  2 teaspoons Italian seasoning instead of the Cajun seasoning

If I don't have Mexican-style diced tomatoes, then I use the Italian-style tomatoes and just cut back on the Cajun seasoning.

This is great comfort food, and it is also great for those times when your husband calls you on the way home from work to mention that he invited a friend for dinner.  I can have it simmering by the time they arrive, and I always get compliments.

Instead of grilling the sausage, I cut it up and stir fried it in the pan, removed and cooked the veggies and then added it back in. I cooked the rice separately as directed on the package and then topped it with the veggie/sausage mixture. This was so quick and easy  for a busy night. The leftovers were even better the next day. Served over rice.

This was good.  Made it with mild sausage & cooked the rice separately in chicken broth.  One of my children loved it, the other picked out all the sausage & left the rest.

This was very good, even my eight year old gobbled it up!  The only thing I did different was I used sweet turkey sausage instead of hot, b'c my family doesn't like super spicy food.  The cajun spice added just enough zing for us.  Excellent!

I made the following substitutions: used a red bell pepper, forgot the onion, added mushrooms, non-spicy sausage, 2 bay leaves, and basmati rice.  I also homemade my Cajun spice mix.  This dish came out great.  I did have to cook longer because my rice wasn't done in the time alloted.  It was so simple to make though that I didn't mind waiting.  This can also be made in a slow cooker, so it's great to make on a weeknight. Thank you for sharing.

Rice DID NOT cook as recipe indicated. I ended up using another can of chicken broth and about another 45 minutes and STILL it wasn't all the way cooked. We were so hungry, we just gave up and ate it, and the chicken broth dominated the entire dish. I'm sure it would've been delicious had I cooked the rice separately.

Followed exactly except I did not have a bell pepper (will definitely add one next time) and I think there was too much rice.  I will cut it back to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 another time - it was way too dry.  I will definitely make this again (dh said to not mess with the flavors any) but the rice was a total disaster.

This was fabulous!  I did it a little differently-- cooked the rice alone and mixed it together before serving.  Thus I used only 3/4 to 1 cup water with chicken bouillon granules.  I did add 1.5 cups of frozen okra, and used yellow pepper instead of green to add some color to the dish.  I used smoked extra lean turkey sausage ring.  I added extra salt but will not next time.  Great recipe, will make again for sure!

This meal is great!!  We aren't big fans of turkey sausage in this household, so we used hot italian sausage instead.  I love the flavors of all the veggies mixed with the rice!!

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars as I did not make it as stated due to what I had on hand.  I agree with other reviews...this was definitely ready in under 30 mins (used basmati rice).  Unfortunately, I didn't have hot turkey sausage, only had regular turkey suasage and I think the hot would add alot more flavour.  I didn't add the bay leaf as I didn't have one and used red pepper instead of green (didn't have).  I do think it needed a bigger can of tomatoes (I also didn't have italian ones, so used regular diced tomatoes), so I will likely try again, but it was quite quick to throw together on usual rushed week night!

This was good, although the sausage I picked was a little too hot for us.  Will try again with something a little tamer.  Also had to cut back on the cooking time -- rice was done in ~20 minutes.

I made this for a party and none was left!! Huge hit! I used brown rice and a mixture of sweet and hot sausage.  I also used Emeril's  essence seasoning as for the cajun seasoning. I've already been asked to make it again!!

The easiest Jambalaya I have ever made. Very quick...sauteed celery, garlic, onions and poblano pepper together with turkey Andouille.  Used Better than Bouillon to create the stock. Added rice, Tony Chacheres seasoning, and canned tomatoes.  Rice was not done to my liking so I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Great Recipe!!

Great recipe- easy to individualize and work with.  As other reviews say, make sure you use extra chicken broth or water to ensure rice is fully cooked.

Great recipe, especially for using just 1 pot! I didn't have cajun seasoning so just added salt, pepper, cumin, oregano and chili powder to the mix. Simmering for 40 minutes is way too long and definitely not enough liquid. My rice came out a bit too sticky and mushy. I think next time I will cook the rice ahead of time or use leftover rice and just simmer for a few minutes. Or just serve over rice! Overall a great tasting recipe!

This was a very tasty recipe.  I will make this again and make a few variations of the same. I did not have any trouble with the rice, however I did use three cups of broth and it was fully cooked in the time stated.

I use the green onion turkey or chicken sausage the local grocer carries.  I use brown jasmine rice cooked in chicken stock in the automatic rice cooker.  That takes about two hours on the brown rice setting, but it's worth it! This is one FINE recipe!!

I substituted turkey sausage with fried cubed summer sausage and it went surprisingly well(i have gobs of it that i don't know what else to do with). I cut out a few ingredients that I didn't have. So, it pretty much went like this, can of Italian diced tomatoes, fried sausage, 2 cups chicken broth, 2 tsp cajun seasoning, handful or so of chopped celery, bring to boil and simmer until celery is soft, then add 1 1/2 cups of minute rice, cover and let sit for 5 or so minutes. Turned out great with the minute rice, which I was afraid of using at first (I'm just a beginner in the kitchen). It's also good without any meat at all. The celery gives it a surprisingly great flavor that I love. Thanks for sharing.

Made this with turkey sausage and it was very tasty.  Tasted even better with a little hot sauce.

My family really liked this!  I doubled the recipe and, after reading everyone else's reviews,  I put in way more liquid.  Probably 2 or 3 cups more of chicken broth.  I also used brown rice instead of white.  I will make it again!

Made  this for dinner tonight. We all loved it. It tasted great and was easy to make. I added 3 cups broth because the ratio of rice to liquid didn't seem right to me for 1 1/2 cups of rice so I used 3 cups to the pot. Came out fine will make it again.

Also on South Beach, this was great! Kind of spicy for my husband, but he liked it. Omitting the rice makes it more of a yummy vegetable turkey soup. I'll definitely make this again!

This was GREAT! We have been on south beach for some time now, and this recipe is a definite keeper for that. I ommitted the rice (obviously for south beach!) and I substituted a red bell pepper, so I only let it cook for 15 minutes after adding the sausage. I didn't add celery because I didn't have any. For my husband, I also added shrimp for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Awesome!!

This is a delicious, quick, and economical meal. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of time cooking during the work week. I had to adjust the amount of Cajun seasoning because the specified amount would have been too spicy for me.

Delicious!  Even better the next day!  I used boil in bag brown rice so it cut the cook time to only ten minutes once the sausage was cooked.  A great, filling, healthy dinner in practically no time at all!  Will be sure to have this again!!

This was great! Even though I fudged some ingredients, like skipping the bay leaves, I found this to be a filling, flavorful dish. I think next time I'll try adding some Rotel mexican tomatoes for a good kick of spiciness. Like many other reviewers, I also found that the rice was done at after 30 minutes (not 40 as the recipes states).

I liked the ease of this recipe and the fact that it was a one dish meal.  I originally made it for only 3 servings which is basically cutting the recipe in half.  However, I did not use less on the tomatoes.   I am afraid if I did, it would have been much dryer.  I thought it was perfect with a whole can and if I make the recipe for 6 I would probably double the tomatoes.

Sounded kind of too simple to be special, but wow, everyone loved it.Didn't have cajun spice, so I used a few drops of Tabasco instead.

Pretty good, I would probably make this again to my taste with more a little more garlic and use 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock instead.

Wonderful!  I had this recipe for over a year before I tried it, and shame on me!  I used lowfat Turkey sausage and I seasoned it much more than the recipe called for.  My 8 year old loved it.

This was not too difficult to prepare and tasted great.  I used Emeril's spicy turkey/chicken sausage and found it a little too spicy for my tastes (but everyone else loved it).  Will make this again.

Pretty good.  I think it needed some chicken.  i used Emeril's spice for the seasoning. Used 6 pressed garlic. It was done in 1/2 hr. vs. 40 to 45.  If I left it that long, it would have burned.  i topped w/a bit of monterrey jack.

Serve it w/broccoli or carrots.

Really good!  To make it more like jambalaya I've added shredded chicken or turkey in addition to the sausage.  Made it with fish once and didn't care for it, but husband did.  This is now a staple in our house.  Thanks!
