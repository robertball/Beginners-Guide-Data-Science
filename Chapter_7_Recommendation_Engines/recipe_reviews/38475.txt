This recipe was delicious!!  My husband loved it.  I took the advice of the other reviews and added alot of italian spices, such as oregano, basil, thyme, & italian seasoning, and also fresh garlic and about half a can of chicken broth.  After all that it was amazing and I will definatley make this again :)

Excellent. Quick and easy. Used diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning. Used sweet basil Italian sausage and added additional amounts of garlic, oregano and basil. Served on top of bow tie pasta and topped with fresh shredded parmesan. Will make this many more times and for company.

Now this is supper in a flash!  Good, simple dish with just a few basic ingredients, good for any reason, but especially when time (and energy!) is at a premium.  In the interest of preparing this as quickly as possible I simmered the sausage in water for 15 minutes before browning them in a little olive oil.  I also added fresh minced garlic to the vegetables. The aroma was intoxicating. I had mine on its own (well, except for a nice glass of Cabernet Sauvignon), Hubs had his over penne pasta. Flavorful and satisfying.  (Some of that red wine would also have been delicious added to the dish itself!)

This is really good.  I cut up my sausage before hand.  I cut up a whole sweet onion.  Browned my sausage in butter with onion and fresh garlic.  I also added a half bullion cube to the stew.  It was so good.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was great! It had lots of flavour and very colourful. I used spicy italian sausage over a bed of rice. The best part was how easy it was to make! I assumed that the limited ingredients would make it bland, but I was definitely wrong!

I thought this had great potential but made some modifications. First, I don't see why you would need to brown the whole sausage first and then cut them up. I chopped up hot italian sausage, a whole sweet onion, and a yellow pepper and threw it in the fry pan. I waited until sausage was cooked/brown and onion and peppers were almost tender and added the chopped zucchini and a clove of chopped garlic. When veggies were tender I added a 28 oz can of italian stewed tomatoes (with juice), a tbsp of italian seasoning on top of that and some salt and pepper to taste. I covered and simmered for maybe 10 minutes while cooking extra large egg noodles. I buttered them and served the sausage/sauce over them.

This was so easy and delicious!  Great low carb dinner by itself! Does not even need pasta or bread. I will definitely make it again. Note: My dad thought this was a bit too greasy, however. FYI

We made this with wonderful fennel-seasoned Italian sausage from the local butcher and served it atop bow-tie/farfalle pasta.  Lacking summer squash, we did without and it was still great.  We'll see how the leftovers are tomorrow!

Everyone enjoyed this. I made with bow tie pasta and added an extra can of stewed tomatoes (I used italian style for extra flavor).  Definitely wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the extra tomatoes, and the extra seasonings in the tomatoes.

Very good. I will use Hot Italian sausage next time and add Louisiana hot sauce to the sauce. I also added some Italian spices and garlic salt. Very good served over pasta with crunchy rolls. A complete meal with some yummy dessert.

Yum! This was SOOOO good!!! I I just LOVE finding recipes that use fresh, seasonal (and minimal) ingredients, require very little modification to suit my tastes and are a snap to prepare! This recipe delivers on all three! Even my picky, squash hating hubs liked this. :) Although nearly perfect as is, I do have a couple of suggestions to make this even BETTER. To start, add a couple LARGE cloves of minced garlic to your veggies (when you sautee them) and then season to taste with s&p - that's really all you need to do! You can also substitute a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes or add a t or so of Italian seasoning for added "oomph." I did all of the above (and used HOT Italian sausage to add some "zip"). Served over bowtie pasta with a sprinkling of shredded Parm cheese and garlic bread on the side, this was an incredibly delicious and filling meal. Thank you SO much for sharing your recipe, Michelle. I will be making this often for sure! :-)

So good and so easy to make.  I took the advice of previous reviewers regarding letting it sit for a day.  I made it earlier in the day, the just reheated it for supper.  It was wonderful.  I served it over bow tie pasta.

Good but needs a little help.  Adding some Italian seasoning is a MUST!  The sauce is pretty runny but it didn't bother us.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I served this over some heart shaped pasta (valentines is coming up ;)  Easy and very easy to adapt to your taste preference.  Don't forget to salt to your taste.

This recipe was good, only I think I would add some tomato sauce or something next time. It just seemed a little dry when I put it over the noodles.

Wow, I knew I would like this but I was blown away by the intense flavors.  Needless to say, I love this and it will become a regular part of my vegetable intake. I used 3oz of hot italian sausage, 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash, 1 can of tomatoes with chilies and jabanero cubes, 1/2 an onion,1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp montreal steak seasoning, and two cloves of garlic.  I cooked the sausage  and onion together until sausage was browned and onion was transparent.  Added the remaining ingredient. To the pot and covered. When it started to boil, I turned down the heat to lowand let it cook for 20-25 minutes. To stir I would merely twist the contents withou lifting the lid lest all of the built up steam escape and hinder the cooking process.  As I served up this delectible vegetable medley, I will top it off with greated cheese.

Excellent low carb recipe. Made a few changes to spice it up a bit. Sauteed the onions, zucchini and squash with some minced garlic. Also added dried oregano, basil, and marjoram. Came out great. Very colorful and easy to make.

This is easy and great.  I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, cut the sausage into 1 inch lengths and added the onion.  Once browned (and drained) I added all the veggies, 1 tablespoon of garlic plus 1 teaspoon each of oregano and basil.  For a final touch I sprinkled mozzarella cheese to cover the dish.  Served over brown rice...awesome.

I make something similar to this as a soup, but add green pepper, a big old can of chicken broth, a very liberal amount of paprika, some thyme, granulated garlic and oregano.  I cook tortellini separately, and add it just before serving.  Adding cottage cheese makes it taste like lasagna!  This always goes over well.

Quick and easy.  I used the Italian style stewed tomatoes to give it a little more flavor and served it over rice.

I made this tonight and served it to hubby and a 2 AND 3 year old and it was a hit. I used 1.5 cans of stewed tomatoes with italian seasoning instead of the one called for and i used 1 large zucchini and one small. Added in some Essence of Emeril Italian as well as some parmesan cheese when it was simmering. served over rice w/ parmesan cheese. VERY good. Will make again for sure.

Very good for a quick, one pan meal.  The things I did differently was instead of using a can of stewed tomatoes I used a jar of my favorite marinara sauce, and I added some fresh minced garlic and fresh chopped Italian parsley to the mix.  I let it simmer for about 20 minutes to let all the flavors mix and served it over whole wheat pasta or brown rice.  My kids enjoyed it, and my husband who's doing the low carb thing was able to eat it without the pasta/rice, so it worked for everyone!

This recipe didn't blow my socks off, but was tasty and easy. I used basil and garlic, otherwise I think this could've been really bland.

Great recipe.  I use sweet sausage, roasted garlic and sweet onion tomatoes as well as adding a little italian seasoning.  All my kids from 6 - 1 love it.  Now that is a winner.

This is a great recipe! I double the squash and serve it over egg noodles. My kids love it. I've even used beef smoked sausage and it's still great (and quicker!).

This was very good, although so much better the second day!  I will make this again, but will either make it a day ahead or earlier in the day so flavors can blend.  Next time may try adding sliced red bell peppers.  Kid's couldn't handle the squash - but that was expected.  Served it over angel hair pasta with lots of fresh grated parmesan. Yum!

This was so good!  I used turkey italian sausage to reduce the fat and it still had great flavor.  Plus with the green zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes, it makes a very colorful presentation.  A definite do again!

Perfect! I used Andouille sausage and added fresh oregano and fennel. Just the right amount of kick! I served it over dried pasta (Tri-color rotini) but that didn't detract from the flavor. Thanks so much for this recipe!
 
*My tip: Use a mandolin to slice your veggies to save time.

This is delicious even without rice or pasta.  Like many others I used Italian spices to give it a little extra zing.  I like the Perfect Pinch Italian spice mix.  Will be making this many more times!

I have tried this recipe quite a few times and I have added some tomatoe paste, peppers, salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano. My husband is in love with this dish. The tomatoe paste thinkens up the liquid from the stewed tomatoes. I add it to extra wide egg noodles and mix it all together. Delicious.

I would have given this 5 stars however I did add 1 to 2 TBs of fresh basil and maybe 1TB of fresh rosemary. I also didn't add the zucchini & squash until about the last 5 mins while it was simmering so that they didn't get mushy.  It was really awesome and tasted amazing!

My husband loved it. I uses 2 large yellow  squashes, 1 green bell pepper, enough tomato sauce to just barely cover the sausages and veggies and a little bit of Swiss chard the last few minutes before serving.  Served it over pasta!

I had a recipe like this from Mullers pasta a while back, it was on the box. This recipe is very very simular and oh so tasty. I did add some italian spices, salt and pepper. Great recipe to use lots of veggies and stretch the budget.

Simple, Fast and Full of Flavor~! Gosh! This is the second time making this and I love it! I use way more zuchinni and summer squash than called for because I love it! I also agree with previous reviews saying spice, spice, spice! You really need to make it your own with your spice rack but you have the perfect base to start with! I also add red, yellow and green peppers to add extra flavor. Great and healthy! Can't beat that!

This was awesome. We added peppers and mushrooms, and did a can of diced tomatoes since we don't care for stewed. I cooked brown rice and served it over that. This will definitely go in our rotation.

Awesome with the suggestions noted, plus my own tweaks.  Had no yellow squash so I substituted a sweet yellow bell pepper that was in my crisper.  Very nice!  Also went with the diced tomatoes, half can of chicken broth, and lots of Italian Seasoning blend. Plus I added one shake of crushed red pepper flakes.  Served over penne rigate in our good china bowls!

I made this for my husband and me and some friends and it was a big hit! We are not even big fans of squash or zucchini, but this dish is delicious. I added sliced pepperoni (good, but would have been good without as well), a little rosemary and about half a teaspoon of minced roasted garlic. Super easy to make and great as leftovers.

I substituted 2 large zucchini for the yellow squash & small zucchini.  After adding garlic, fresh mushrooms, and a small green bell pepper,  I seasoned with Montreal Steak and served over rice. It's a quick, filling, and relatively inexpensive meal.

Great recipe!  I added half a red onion and a hungarian hot pepper both coarsely chopped, and spiced to my own tastes.  The wife loved it and this will be regular addition to our home dinner menu.

Overall the dish was fantastic, but the rotini did not work the way I had foreseen.  I may use rotini again, but I'll add less of it and toss it with the dish, rather than serve one atop the other.

This was good, but slightly bland.  I added a generous teaspoon of italian seasoning, but I think this dish could also use some garlic.  My sausage casings came off easily, so I just crumbled the sausage rather than slicing.  This dish came together quickly and was very filling when served over pasta.

Excellant and easy! I'm sure I would give it 5 stars exactly as written, but I did make some changes, according to personal preferences. I used turkey Italian sausage and squeezed it out of the skins and browned it, so had a crumble rather than slices. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 teaspoon each of basil, oregano, thyme, and garlic - also 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning. I added one red bell pepper, chopped. Prepared it early in the day, then heated it in 300 degree oven for 30 minutes. Served with rice, but will try it with egg noodles next time. Thanks, Michelle.

Love this recipe!  I have been making it for 10 years, I originally found it in a Taste of Home magazine and have been making it faithfully since then.  I typically use only zucchini and diced tomatoes (canned) with or without italian seasoning (whatever I happen to have on hand).  Sometimes I serve it with rice, but the rest of the family prefers angel hair pasta.  I eat mine separate from the pasta (butter & parmesan cheese on my pasta), but my husband likes his on top.  Delicious!

This recipe was great! I had some Italian sausage I bought but did'nt use for another dish (we don't usually eat it) so I looked this up to "get rid of it" I added lotes of spices and the garlic and broth as suggested and served it over rice. Yesterday I went back to the market especially to buy Italian sausage and make the dish again.  The only thing we did different that we feel improved on it was put some Ces't bon cajun seasoning on it.  A new fav at my house!

Like some others I used a lot of Italian spices, and a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes.  I served it the first night with steamed red potatoes, and the 2nd night with rice.  It was great both ways.  My S/O loved it, I thought it was just 'pretty good'.  I would make it again.

This was very good. I wanted to make this because its so easy and I had almost everything it called already! I used what I had and improvised the rest: about 1/2 lb ground italian sausage, 1/2 pound ground beef, and 3 skillet made beef links. I used italian stewed tomatoes (a must!) and only 1 zuccini and 1 yellow squash. It was sooo good even my boyfriend who hates tomatoes and really doesnt like squash gobbled it up! Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was great!  However, my husband wanted it have more sauce so I think I am going to add a little bit of tomato sauce next time and some italian seasonings.  Served it over fresh, angel hair pasta and it was delicious!

This was very good, had lots of flavor.  Was very thin and I recommend making it with rice.  I made it with pasta and there was a lot of liqued sitting in the bottom of the bowl.  Would make again.

I like this better when I use kielbasa sausage instead of italian sausage.  With this, I add some crushed red pepper to give it a little bite.  I use the tomatoes with italian seasoning, but I also add some more italian blend seasonings of my own.  I have also tried  this including chucks of green/yellow peppers.  This is good either served over pasta or rice.

After adding italian seasoning, basil, thyme, oregano, garlic salt, crushed red pepper, and extra garlic...this was fantastic! We made it with Morningstar Farms Vegetarian sausage links and my fiance and I loved it.

Wow!  So easy, and very tasty.  Added the chicken broth (about 1/2 a can; low-fat and salt-free) and used Italian-spiced diced tomatoes.  Added lots of garlic, oregano and italian spices and more than the amount of veggies listed.  Topped with some parmesan cheese when serving over rice, and this was just great!

This was very good, especially with all the veggies doubled.  I doubled all the ingredients except the sausage, and it was wonderful.  The sausage took longer than expected to become no longer pink, and I cut it up before I should have, so it was a little squishy when I cut it.  I'll let it cook longer next time before cutting it.  Thanks for a great way to use up summer sqaush!

We loved this meal! I took some other reviewers' advice and added a little oregano, basil, and garlic. I also added an extra can of no-salt added stewed tomatoes because we love tomatoes, and it seemed like the perfect amount to us. I served it over white rice, but next time I'd like to use whole wheat pasta for something a little healthier. Great recipe!

Everyone liked this meal. I added extra (turkey)smoked sausage, and additional veggies such as: asparagus, and bell pepper, I also put extra zucchini and squash. I placed the veggies and sausage into a traditional italian marinara sause and let simmer for 20 min as another cook had suggested. I then added basil, italian seasoning, salt,pepper, and parmesan to the sauce for extra kick. To end it off, I served the sauce, sausage, and veggies over a wheat shell pasta...
Left overs were even better...

We ate spaghetti last night so we left out the stewed tomatoes tonight.  The recipe was still great!  Next time I want to try it with the tomatoes in it.  Without the tomatoes we used dijon mustard as a condiment.  It was great.  Thanks for the recipe

I've been making this for a few years.  I use sweet sausage, double the squash and zucchini, add a splash of white wine and serve it over yellow rice dinner. It's a family favorite.  Leftovers are good too!

This is a good basic recipe that you can tweak according to how you like it. I found that it needed a little more flavoring and thickness when served over rice. I used hamburger, added crushed garlic, garlic salt, pepper and oregano. I also added some red sauce to thicken. My sweetie devoured it! Thanks!

I've made this three times now and our entire family enjoyed every bit of it.  I did use seasoned diced tomatoes, once the italian seasoned w/ basil, and the other mexican...the mexican gave it a nice little kick.  I also let the mixture sit for a bit on the stove top once fully cooked.  That extra bit of time to get friendly was just what it needed!  I also served over angel hair pasta that had a little parmesean cheese sauce on it....a fab little touch....all in all a new family & friends favorite!

Great!  Super easy!!  I used turkey Italian-flavored sausage links, and increased the yellow squash to 2.  I like to use diced tomatoes with onions and garlic (smaller tomatoes and better flavor).  Since I've made this a few times, I now cook the onions with the sausage so that they get well done, and add about 1/2 cup of white wine as well wow - smells and tastes heavenly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe to be quick and easy. I cut up the sausage before I browned it. I think this gave it a litlle more flavor. Also, I sprinkled parmesan cheese over the sauce, before cooking the last 15 min. A great recipe. Thanx

Easy and tasty! Next time, I'll add some Italian spice to the sauce/tomatoes, to give more flavor. I didn't have canned tomatoes, so used jarred pasta sauce.

This was amazing! We doubled the recipe because we have a large family and everyone loved it! We didn’t use stewed tomatoes because it has celery in it, instead we used petite diced tomatoes and seasoned it with Italian seasoning. We also added baby Bella mushrooms because everyone here loves mushrooms. All in all it was just devine!!! I would recommend this to anyone who would like a great home Italian dish. You may want to consider putting grated Parmesan on top to finish the dish.

Yum. My kids wouldn't touch it, but they fear words like "zucchini." I thought it was fabulous. Made as written. The sausage I had was hatch chili sausage.

I changed it up a bit.  I also added seasoning.  Basil, oregano, garlic.  I made it with penne pasta and put the raw pasta in the pot with some water added and cooked the pasta with all the other ingredients.  Turned out nice.  will make it again.

I made it again but this time cooked the pasta separately.  Still added the seasonings and this time I had three different types of sausages. (breakfast, kielbasa and medium italian.  Very nice with all the flavours of the sausages.

Excellent! We amped up the flavor with spicy seasonings and will definitely make it again.

It is listed as a Paleo recipe, but the main photo up shows it made with pasta - it is a reviewer's photo who suggested serving it over rice or pasta. Doesn't that make it a Non-Paleo recipe?

This was very good.  Followed directions exactly but cooked it a bit longer, probably because I had so much in the pan.  Will definitely make again.

Reduced it to 2 servings so I did make more vegetable and I sliced the onion not chopped. I also added a crushed garlic clove , basil and oregano. Could be served in a fine Italian restaurant! So delicious! Served over bow tie pasta with parmesan cheese.

Delicious!!! I did what other reviewers said and added a couple cloves of garlic, Italian seasoning, and chicken broth. My only suggestion it to reduce or thicken the sauce/liquid as it is very runny. Otherwise a great recipe!

Quick easy meal. I added some Cajun seasoning and also I cooked the onion and veggies together first for about 10 mins then added them to the meat along with the tomatoes. I served it over white rice, I will definitely make it again. Thanks for this recipe ??

I sprinkled garlic powder, Italian seasoning, smoked salt, & black pepper. I wish the juice would have cooked down a bit more- there was a lot of liquid left. I think it would have been too bland without the things I added. I also sprinkled Parmesan cheese on it. I would make it again and drain some liquid after cooking zucchini, onions, & yellow squash. Then, add the stewed tomatoes with their juice. Thanks for the idea for this healthful & easy recipe!

So easy and fast.  Depending on the type of sausage used, it can be rather spicy.  Served it over whole wheat penne and the family enjoyed it.

Make changes to taste. I used loose mild Italian sausage vs in-casing,  1-3 cloves Garlic, Crushed Red Pepper, Fresh Cracked Black Pepper and Kosher Salt, all to taste. I also reversed the quantities of yellow squash to zucchini(irrelevant to recipe, I just prefer yellow squash). I added a 8 oz. can of Tomato sauce w/Basil, Garlic and Oregano(if u use reg tomato sauce, just add Italian seasoning). My favorite variation was to serve this over Bowtie Pasta(Farfalle). I used about 1/2 lb. for this meal, then cooked another 1/2 lb when reheating.

Yummy!  I only had two pounds of bulk Italian sausage, so I browned that and actually used 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash, along with two cans of stewed tomoatoes.  I took other reviewers' suggestions and added some oregano, fresh minced garlic, and I sprinkled some Mrs. Dash Tomato & Basil over the veggies.  I served it over Gemelli pasta.  I think next time I'm going to thicken it up with a can of tomato sauce, but it is delicious.

Wonderful! We added extra spice like other reviewers suggested, and used winter squash, carrots, a whole onion, and a few cloves of Garlic. Also we found that afterward we liked it better garnished with a little Feta cheese and some sauerkraut, with a simple Italian salad on the side - yum!

I thought this was a great idea and it tasted superb! Just a few things I did... I cut my sausage while it was raw. I used 2 regular sized zucchini and 1 reg squash because I love vegetables. I used a purple onion and I chose to season a little with garlic powder, herbs de provence, and italian. I used diced tomatoes since that is usually my preference. I used half of a box of rigatoni. Thank you for this recipe!

I used hot & spicy Italian sausage, so it was anything but bland. I had some leftover spaghetti sauce so I used that instead of canned tomatoes.

Very good and easy recipe! My husband and I both loved it. I did add an eggplant and a green bell pepper because I had them on hand. I also put in a can of canellini beans, but it could have probably used 2 cans. This recipe produced a lot of leftover liquid, so it would also be good served over rice or pasta. Will keep and make again!

I followed the recipe pretty close but made a few modifications.  I took the casing off of the Italian sausage links and cooked and crumbled the mixture in the pan then added the zucchini and onion to cook a little bit.  I added garlic, salt, and pepper (to taste) to the sausage, onion and zucchini mixture and put the lid on the pan to cook for about 10 minutes.  Once I took the lid off I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and some red pepper flakes.  I simmered until most of the liquid was gone then I sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.  OMG...this was yummy!

This recipe is fantastic!  I used diced tomatoes with green chillies instead of the stewed tomatoes - delish!!  I also added one cube chicken bullion and a whole onion.  I served it over rigatoni pasta.  My husband ate it all and he NEVER eats veggies.  So yummy.  Can't wait to try it again.

I thought this was very good.  If you prepare the vegetables ahead of time, this is a quick and easily made meal.  I added garlic and Italian seasoning, and used two cans of stewed tomatoes, but it was still missing something.  Next time I will add mushrooms, and caramelize the onion.  This is an overall good recipe and the tweaking helps.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy & my family loved it.  The can of stewed tomatoes was bland, it needed more "zing", so I added a 15-oz can of Italian-style diced tomatoes.  Next time, I will use 2 cans of Ital. diced tomatoes, and skip the stewed tomatoes.  I also addded 8-oz of cooked rotini to the finished pot & it was a perfect all-in-one meal.

Didn't have any yellow squash but had everything else and added the zucchini to make difference. I used my own canned tomatos. Great easy to leave in skillet on gas stove on low heat to keep warm as I had many different people on schedules the day I made it.  I wish I had some yellow squash because as good as it was it didn't look all that exciting, next time I will make with the yellow squash.

This was absolutely delicous !! I did a few things different though; used both hot and sweet sausage links, stewed tomatoes, and red onion. I cut up all veggies and added some butter, salt, and pepper placed all that in a tin foil pouch and put on the grill! I grilled the sausages separate. When finished, I cut them up and added them to the veggies,served over Penne pasta and topped with parm cheese!!  Even the kids loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

While I only used this as a base recipe because I didn't have the right sausage, it is an excellent plase to start for a quick hearty meal.

Really enjoyed this. Used zesty diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes (all I had on hand), added a bit of salt & pepper, and served with egg noodles on the side. Thanks for posting. Will make in the future

I loved this dish! I used Linguica, a flavorful Portuguese sausage, and it needed no additional seasoning. Served over pasta... though it is delicious on its own. It was WONDERFUL and I will make this again and again.

This was excellent. Granted, I made quite a few changes from the recipe. My modifications: added oregano, basil, and sage; used brocolli and mushrooms instead of zucchini; added garlic; used 2 cans diced tomatoes. I served over rice.

I made this without the tomatoes.  Instead, I added some olive oil while cooking the zucchini and squash.  Heated it through with some penne regate pasta.   Will make again.

This was very good for something different. You do need to add a lot of Italian spices to give it some flavor. I also added red pepper and used hot italian sausage.  I think it's best served over rice.

This was awesome!!  I love the idea of having something else to do with sausage.  I had too many zucchini from my garden so that is all I used.  I added some fresh garlic and had some long grain rice from a few nights ago and added that in the last 5 minutes.  This will be something that I make over and over again!!!!!

I am so impressed.  With such few ingredients, this dish has great flavor.  I followed the recipe almost exactly - used Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes, and had to add a bit of extra olive oil because i used turkey sausage.

It tasted even better the next day after all the flavors married.  I will definitely add this one to the recipe rotation!

Great recipe and very easy! I used one lb of sausage and 1/2 lb of cooked ham. I threw the ham in with the veggies. I used a can of italian style diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes. Also added a bit of oregano, basil, garlic and parmesean cheese before serving. Served over whole wheat pasta.

Awesome! This was a huge hit with the whole family. I cut up the sausage before I cooked it, knocked out one step and I feel like it tastes better this way. I served this over rice and it was excellent!!! Thank you!

So good!! Made this tonight used turkey italian sausage but otherwise followed recipe-my tomatoes were fire-roasted which gave more flavor and used lots of italian spices-put over whole-wheat pasta.  Look forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

Thank You! This was a really tasty and quick dish served over rice.  I love the crunchiness of the vegetables mixed with the tomatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little sugar to the stewed tomatoes.

For some reason I thought, one pot=short time. It took awhile longer than expected. Also I'm a "sauce-everything" kinda girl so I had to add some white wine and chicken broth. Lots of fresh garlic too. Didn't have zuchinni so used cucumber with the squash. I simmered it all for about twice the time too b/c I like softer veggies. Def agree it's good for the diet. All in all this was pretty good. I enjoyed it.

I thought it was somewhat bland.  I did add some spices and garlic and still thought it was bland.  I think it will make a good base recipe that I can build upon though.

I love this recipe and so did my family! I added some garlic and an extra can of diced tomatoes because I had some extra sausage mixed in. Served over white rice is wondeful and easy.

WONDERFUL MEAL!
I added red, yellow and orange peppers and did use marinara over the diced tomatoes.  I also did it ahead of time and fried everything individually (my personal preference) I then put it in a 9 by 11 and baked it later for 30 minutes at 300.  This is a definate keeper.  Even my two year old loved it.  Except for the sausage it is all veggies - so good for her too!
Thanks so much!

I wasn't crazy about this and I really like everything that went into it.  I might try again with more spices and a thicker sauce.

This is a very quick and easy recipe that tastes great.  I do love fresh zucchini and squash, and those flavors are highlighted in this recipe.  I left out the onion due to my husband's preference.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  Highly recommended.  Thanks, Michelle W.

Not for my family. I substituted the yellow squash for mushrooms and added a bunch of spices. The sauce was a bit bland with out it. Didn't care for the italian sasuage, maybe ground beef would have been better. Don't think I will be making this again.

Thanks for the recipe Michelle. This dish turned out great. I added some Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to this. It's great on a low carb diet. No need for rice.

Great, easy meal!  I served it up with rice and crusty french bread rolls and watched my husband dig right in.  I did add red pepper flakes to give it a little more zest; next time I'll also add some italian seasoning.  Yup, I'll be making this one again!

We made this with freshly made sausage from our local grocer and RedGold stewed tomatoes.  Amazingly deliscious.  Everyone loved it.  No leftovers.  Also, if you cut the sausage into bun-size lengths, you can serve this on hoagie rolls.  And, it is also very good with green peppers added.  Just increase the amount of stewed tomatoes proportionately.

I made this sauce ahead of time and reheated it and served it over pasta.  We loved the simplicity of the recipe.  The italian sausages give it a great flavor.  My husband and I both do a lot of cooking and we were extremely pleased with this one.  It is definitely a keeper.
