I enjoyed this recipe and followed the recipe as written except for I added a little almond extract to the batter and put cinnamon on top. Without the extra flavoring it would have been a little bland. But a great base! Be generous with the peach slices on top!

This is sort of like a firm custard, very eggy and very yummy.  I only topped with about half the sugar and I gave it a good sprinkle of cinnamon.  I can see adding some almond extract if I use peaches or vanilla if using other fruits such as strawberries, plums, raspberries, whatever...lots of possibilities.  This is just about effortless and presents itself very well.

I used a chopped apple instead of a peach and it was great! Added a dash of vanilla.

This was easy to prepare and delicious! I tweaked it a little by adding 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter. I also used cinnamon sugar for the top instead of just sugar. I may add some nuts next time! My husband asked for seconds, so you know it was good!

This is an easy and simple recipe that produces a wonderful custard style baked pancake.  I recommend adding a pinch of salt and a little vanilla.  I used half the amount of sugar which was perfect for me.  My husband preferred it with a little drizzled maple syrup.   This makes a very nice breakfast.

This is a good basic idea, but the batter itself is very bland. I recommend adding a half tsp of either vanilla or almond extract to give it some flavor. It definitely needs to be served with syrup or jam, because the dish is not sweet at all. For those looking for a traditional pancake texture, this is not for you. The recipe is like a hybrid between a custard and a pancake. I personally like the dish with the added extract.

I followed this recipe using apple instead of peach.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Should have read reviews before making because I definitely would've added salt.  I sprinkled a little on after baking and it seemed to be the missing ingredient.  Easy to make and not as high maintenance as pancakes!  Will definitely make again and experiment!

Delicious with just a couple additions. Used gluten free flour because it's all I had, and it worked out just fine. Used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla like another reviewer suggested. The addition was PERFECT! I added a dash of salt which I would omit the next time- using salted butter was enough. Lastly, I sprinkled cinnamon on the top for the final touch. This recipe is easy and quick for a weekend.

Hubby pronunced this delicious!  Would give it 5 stars, but it would have been bland made exactly by the recipe.  I added 1/2tsp almond extract to the batter and a pinch of salt;  used only 1/8 cup sugar on top, then sprinkled some cinnamon on top.  I served it with lite syrup, which was very tasty.  I will definitely make it again and adust sugar back to the full 1/4 c sugar.  Maybe with regular syrup you could dial back granulated sugar.  Six to one,  half dozen the other...

Tried it without the addition of vanilla or almond extract and it was very bland.  Without the excellent peach on top, I would have tossed it out.  Definitely liked the cinnamon sugar on top.  Might try again...

Needs some flavoring specially vanilla cause it tends to be very eggy but the recipe certainly holds a lot of promise!
