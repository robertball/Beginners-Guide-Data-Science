This was so good, it did continue to get hotter overnight.  I added 16oz of sour cream the next day to tone it down it a bit.  I wil definitely make again- very yummy!

This was quick & yummy!  However, it does make a big batch, next time I'll make only half.  I really like it on leftover turkey sandwitches, it would also be great on chicken patties.

I wasn't sure how this would come out. If I hadn't read the reviews I probabily would not have made this but I am glad I did! This was most excellent! Even people who don't much care for spicy things liked this dip. It's a "good hot"

This was good & spicy. I had an open can of chipotle in adobe in the frig & looking to use it up. I had used 1 or 2 peppers out of the can, so the rest went into this recipe. I also added the entire bottle of blue cheese dressing (16oz.). I would imagine that with a whole can of peppers, this would be too spicy for some. I really liked it & so did several other people. The flavor was very nice & the heat follows. I served with celery, baby carrots & sliced baguette to help cut the heat.

This is a great, easy to prepare dip. If you don't like very spicy, you might want to cut back on the peppers.

Neither my roommate nor I liked this.  We both love spicy things, but the tastes just did to seem to complement each other.  If I try it again, I'll try it either with no adobo or with a different kind of pepper.

Like other reviewers this recipe does make a big batch and it is pretty spicey. Next time I make it I would add more blue cheese, all I could taste was the chipotle peppers. I did mix in some of the leftover dip with chicken and black beans for enchiladas and it was fantastic!

Very good!  It was very spicy (and I LOVE spicy) as written so I added a bit more dressing.  Other than that, will make again.

If I made this again I would only use 1/2 the can of chipotle! We all like hot but this was just a little too hot to really enjoy. And I added more milk to it.

This recipe tasted really good, but I kept having to warn ppl that it was really hot...maybe next time i'd cut back on the chipotle peppers a bit. Everyone enjoyed it tho and it was a great hit at my party...thanks!

Whoa Nellie this is spicy.  I cut the recipe in half just to try it.  It was great on chips and my ham and cheese sandrich.  Can't wait to try it with veggies.  I'm going to try this one with ranch dressing next.

Excellent...Don't change a thing...the flavor builds the longer it melds together. Works very well with chips (Fritos) or veggies.

This is so tasty, I added cream cheese for a thicker consistency. Everyone loved it and if you live in the North West, use Litehouse Blue Cheese for the best taste:) Warning, this does warm up! Enjoy!

We like hot food but come on now!!! I am just sorry I wasted these ingredients. It was inedible. Unless the whole can of chipotle was a mistake. We only used 3/4 of the can after reading one of the reviews and it was again, not even edible.

I have been making almost the exact same dip for a few years now. I am going to impart a couple of tips; find a bottle of Brianna's (Texas Steakhouse blue cheese dressing) and get your self some fresh blue cheese crumbles to drop in.......MMMMmmmmmm...........
Now, you can also try substituting the mayonnaise with sour cream. Or you can heat the dip with cream cheese instead...........hope that helps.

I bet the recipe is incorrect and should read 1 pepper from a can... I love spicy, I only used about 1/3 of a can and it was plenty spicy.  I have never seen a recipe use an entire can in any way.  VERY spicy hot!

Followed this recipe as written and we love it.  It is hot (and gets even hotter the next day) but if you like the heat, this is a great flavor combination.  We eat it with tortilla chips, pita crisps, and fresh veggies.  I've also been known to add it on tacos or quesadillas instead of sour cream or guacamole.

The salsa is far too hot.  The recipe should jalapenos..not habaneros.

This was interesting, for some reason I couldn't stop eating it, but I wasn't sure if I liked it! I had half a can of chiles in adobo and half a container of crumbled blue cheese to use up. I didn't have milk oops, so I just used some sour cream and mayo, I think it needs the milk because it was kind of thick. I wanted to take a picture, but my camera isn't working. Maybe next time.         ** EDIT ** I still had a little dip left when I got my camera to start working. So I took a pic as I was eating.....
