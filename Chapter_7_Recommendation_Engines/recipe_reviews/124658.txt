Very good - I had to add more milk as my mixture was a little too dry to knead... I also left off the egg wash and topped the unbaked scones with a cinnamon sugar mixture. These were great scones and made a perfect light dinner with homemade applesauce!

Love this recipe - almost identical to the Grandma's Molasses Gingerbread Scone recipe, except that one calls for 1/2 C milk.

I love scones, ginger and molasses but, as some reviewers said, they are a little dry.   Sorry for giving them a lower rating but I feel that the following is an improvement: use 1 whole large egg and substitute 1/3 cup of sour cream for milk (possibly more to get the right consistency).   Have made this version many times with no problem.  Good luck......

Fabulous! So yummy! I used 4 T (1/4 C) brown sugar and added a pinch each of ground cloves and nutmeg. Served warm with a little vanilla whipped cream. They just melt in your mouth! Yummm!

I love this recipe.  Moist, delicious, and good warm or room temp--but better when hot and fresh out of the oven.  I did the egg wash, but put cinnamon and sugar instead of plain sugar--delicious!  Want to try with an orange glaze, as suggested by previous reviewers, next time I make these.

I followed the recipe exact, only because I read through the reviews before making these, I added an extra generous splash of milk to the wet ingredients because I was concerned about the dough being too dry. I did egg wash my scones and then sprinkled them with a cinnamon/coarse sugar mix. I thought these were fantastic as did my two boys and husband. Quite simple and very tasty. I think these would be great with a simple vanilla glaze in place of the sugar on the top, too. Next time I make these (and I will make these again), I'll add a little nutmeg. YUM.

This is a real comfort food!  My family loves gingerbread, and made into scones was neat.  Next time, I might add some grated orange rind.  We will be having this often!

I made these scones as a holiday dessert for friends from England and they loved it. Even their one year old boy wanted more. Great recipe!

Wow, these were out-of-this-world delicious! I did make a few changes based on personal preferences and by what I had on hand. I swapped measurements of ginger and cinnamon, added a pinch of nutmeg and cloves, and used 1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream instead of milk. I also tossed the whole egg into the mixture, and glazed the finished product with a simple icing sugar glaze. These scones turned out tasting more like a thick molasses cookie than a scone, and the texture was absolutely divine! Will definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing :)

I don't know what went wrong--these came out of my oven tasting like hockey pucks. I have made a lot of different scone recipes over the years, so I was eager to try a gingerbread flavor. These were very flat, not crumbly, and lacked in flavor. (I will admit that I added a little extra cinnamon, a bit of anise, and a pinch of cloves to make it more spicy.)

If you make these, eat them warm with a ton of molasses or something else with a strong flavor to make up for the lack of flavor. When they cool they become hard as rocks.

These were delicious.  I could have done with a stronger gingerbread flavor by adding more spices, but they were still very, very good.  A unique flavor for scones.  I also used a light orange glaze.

Solidly good.  Will definitely make again as they go so nicely with coffee.  The only changes I made were to sub in half whole wheat flour and to sprinkle with cinnamon sugar instead of just sugar.  A keeper.

The scones are fairly good.  I love the spicy flavor which goes great with a cup of coffee in the morning.  However, the milk needs to be increased to 1/2 cup.  Also, I'd double the amount of sugar as they weren't sweet enough for my taste.  To compensate, I added a sprinkling of pearlized decorator sugar on top after brushing them with the egg white.  Lastly, these scones are better with less handling.  Next time, I'll knead only 3-4 times; otherwise, they're too chewy.  :-)

Delicious!  I used a whole egg for the scone, instead of using the white for the wash, and substituted canola oil for butter.  I also threw in some grated candied ginger and chopped dried apples.  This was moist and delicious.

We really enjoyed these. However, it's a better scone with the whole egg in.  Just brush milk on before baking and sprinkle sugar on them.  I think the scones could benefit with an increase in the margarine to 1/3c.  I increased the ginger and cinnamon as well - I love 'em both.

This is a very bland scone.  I added a little more milk and extra brown sugar but there's not much taste to them.

I am really enjoying these!  I have never had a gingerbread scone before, but thought they would be the perfect way to warm up the house on this snowy day.  I added a tablespoon of ground flax seeds just to 'health it up' a little, and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were just OK. I even added extra ginger and was expecting a more powerful punch. I didn't like the addition of egg to my scone, either. My husband ate them and claimed them "Good". My daughters ate the top with the sugar and left the scone alone.

These are fantastic scones.  I only realized half way through that I was all out of molasses so I just subbed in more brown sugar.  I made 18 mini-scones.  They turned out great and were not dry at all, as other reviewers have said.  I'll be making these again and again!

Excellent gingerbread taste!  I like these better than the gingerbread I made one time.  Extremely easy, too. I didn't do the egg wash but otherwise followed the recipe. I have a silpat mat so cutting scones is a no no on it--I use a pastry mat I have, shape the dough into a round, cut into scones with a pizza cutter, then flip it onto my cookie sheet with the silpat mat.  Works perfectly every time!  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were pretty good and might have been even better with a little glaze.  I took others' recommendations to sprinkle them with a cinnamon/sugar mix (instead of just sugar).

These are great scones.  I adjust for 1 cup wheat flour and one cup white.  My husband who doesn't like gingerbread will eat them.

Good, but not excellent. I would make them again, but i would probably use them only for dipping with coffee, or i would experiment with more spices.

I love scones, but I was a little disappointed with these. They aren't very sweet and seem very dry. I may try to make these again, but I think I'll stick to more traditional scone recipes.

I made this recipe for my grandma's 70th birthday, and we really enjoyed them.  It took a while for the dough to come together when kneading, but it did.  Also, I started the recipe before checking my pantry (oops!), and ended up substituting honey and extra brown sugar for the molasses.  The recipe still tasted great!

These are wonderful.  Very similar to gingerbread men but I like these better.  My husband warms them up in the am for his breakfast.

I made these great scones following the recipe but next time I'll use the whole egg and probably sour cream.  I thought the flavor was great and texture was good. Will make these again as they are so easy.  Oh yea, I added some walnuts in mine.  Very good.

These were very good.  They were small, I like a very large thick scone.  I have to say, in reference to the other comments saying theses were dry, I really like dry scones.  In fact, I was very careful not to use more liquid than needed to make them moist (like the original recipe calls for).  They were very "gingerbready" but, please do not confuse this for sweet.  They are not a dessert, rather a tea scone.  Overall they were very good, and a nice change from the usual scones.

I made half the recipe because I knew I would end up eating them all.  And I almost did.  I loved them!   I would recommend using unsalted butter, otherwise omit the salt.  I would also add more brown sugar, because I love them sweet!

Tasty, somewhat crunchy/chewy for scones, probably quite healthy as they're low (ish - there's the molasses too) sugar and low fat compared to many scone recipes.  However, you do taste that too; maybe more like a tea biscuit than typical scone, not so crumbly.  But quite quick and nice.  Any dry fruit would be a good add-in; chocolate would clash with the ginger imo.
