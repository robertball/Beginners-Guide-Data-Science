I hate pot pies. I always have. Whether is was homemade with a flour crust or the frozen in boxes pot pies, they were all nasty. My girlfriend's mother saw this commercial and twenty minutes later, we hadn't even known she'd left, she was back from the store cooking them. She followed the recipe to a T and they were delicious. The crust was perfectly flaky and the veggies were firm. This one recipe changed my view on pot pies.

UUUUUMMMMMmmmm ummmmmmmm goooood just like the Campbell's soups slogan promises!!! These mini chicken pot pies are little but they hit with big awesome flavor! I made some changes & additions, I didn't measure out the chicken I just bought a 2lb package of boneless chicken. I didn't want to have fresh tasting chicken so I seasoned my chicken after cutting them up in cubes with garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chicken seasoning and a little salt since I know that cream of chicken has a lot of sodium (regular taste better than the low sodium). I didn't need to pre-cook the chicken because they were cut up small enough to cook in the oven but big enough to feel the bite of them. I was making a double amount of the recipe so I also used 1 can of cream of broccoli and a half container of sour cream with a little of water so that the mixture would still be thick but stretch. I added some black pepper and parsley flakes to the creamy mixture to give it some color and depth, then added the chicken, frozen peas & carrots. After placing them in the biscuits cups I sprinkled pepper flakes to the top for some added zing then the cheese and followed the directions as given. These were also fun to make as my kids helped in the process, one doesn't like veggies so I had to put his into some biscuits cups then add the veggies to the mixture. Try these, you will enjoy it.

My mother used to make her own rendition of this when I was a kid. None of us kids like mixed veggies so she substituted 'flakey' biscuits (our favorite), chopped frozen broccoli for the veggies and cream of broccoli soup and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. When she was feeling particularly patient, she'd even let us kids press the dough into the cupcake tins ourselves. She/we never rolled the biscuit dough out, just patted and formed it into the cupcake tins. Secret tip for moms- kids are more likely to eat something they actually had a hand in making themselves!

Very simple and delicious recipe... Instead of buying canned biscuits, I made my own biscuits using another recipe from this site (Never Fail Biscuit recipe) and added Parmesan cheese to the biscuit dough. Turned out great!!! Definitely adding this to my recipe pile!!!

I've made this mini pot pies 3 times thus far and I have some recommendations. The filling is too salty for me. Use low sodium cream of chicken and add more salt accordingly. Add 2 tsp of thyme, basil, onion powder, and garlic powder to the filling. Instead of topping muffin with cheese, I mix the cheese in the filling. I also blanch carrots before mix them with other vegetables, because half cooked carrots are disgusting. At last, the biscuit cup can be as thin as possible to make more pot pies. Otherwise, you might have some leftover filling for creamy chicken soup. If you like the result, next time try to make biscuit yourself. At last, instead of chicken, I use leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.

Not bad. On accident I bought the jumbo biscuits so these came out very breast. It sort of tasted like a bunch of veggies on a biscuit, just not very flavorful.

I was inspired by the size of the little pot pies. What a good idea for portion control. I decided to make mine healthier and skip the canned soup and lower my sodium intake. I made a roux and used my homemade chicken broth to make a really thick sauce to mimic the canned soup. The rest was made just as the recipe was written. Thank's Campbell's marketing department for the idea.

I doubled the ingredients to make a larger batch. I rolled two biscuits at a time and folded the excess dough over the top of the mixture once in the muffin pans. Delicious!!!!

This was super easy to make, but the combination of the biscuit, cream soup and the Tyson pre-cook grilled, cubed chicken I used for a short-cut made the recipe way too salty. I think next time I'm going to add cubed potatoes too, to help cut the saltiness. Other than than that, hubby loved it. I'll do it again with the changes.

This is a great meal when you don't have alot of time for slicing and dicing. Easy, quick and oh so good! I used canned chicken chunks. I mixed the shredded cheese into the mix instead of just on top and added some onion and garlic powder for extra zip. Very flavorful!

Used canned veggies instead of frozen, as no one  likes peas here. We did corn and carrots and they were delicious!

This was OK. I really liked how easy these were to make, but I would try some tweaks next time. I'm not a huge fan of cream of chicken soup, but I thought cream of broccoli might be better. I also used Grands biscuits, and some of them didn't cook all the way through. Maybe smaller biscuits next time? I think with some small changes this could be a great,easy, and cheap recipe.

It was really tasty! The only thing I'll do different next time is use crescent roll dough so the crust will be flakier, but that's a personal preference.

I am a horrible cook. In stereotypical bachelor fashion, my refrigerator rarely has more in it but a carton of milk, some takeout boxes, and beer. Cooking intimidates me, but if you’re intimidated by this recipe, you shouldn’t be. I not only succeeded in making it (and it was edible on my first try) but I am going so far as to suggest a modest improvement. I thought that mini pot pies sounded awfully complicated for my poor abilities, so I followed the recipe to the letter the first time I tried it. I expected it to end up as a messy, burning disaster in my oven, but the biscuit batter held together and kept the filling from bubbling and burping all over the burner. I felt unreasonably triumphant. Sadly, that triumph was soon followed by an equally powerful feeling of disappointment, if not outright despair. Why? Because while the premade, refrigerated biscuits suggested by this recipe saved some time and provided some crucial structural support, they tasted like stale garbage. I decided that for a dish with such a high biscuit-to-filling ratio, it was worth spending a little bit of time making a better biscuit. I did just that.

I wanted a biscuit that would hold together. A biscuit with a lightly toasted, golden-brown crust. A biscuit with a light, moist, fluffy inside to soak up some of the chicken-flavored goodness inside. So using a simple recipe that Google found for me, I took a leap and made my own biscuit dough. I’m still shocked that I took such a bold step, but it

I make these mini pot pies for my elderly mother who doesn't cook for herself. I put them in the freezer for her, and then she takes them out as she wants them and warms them in the microwave. She loves these and always wants them in her freezer as a choice for a delicious meal. The only change I make is that I use a well-rinsed can of Veg-All mixed vegetables instead of the frozen ones.

I am giving this 3 stars because I am factoring in me and my husbands opinion on this.  I loved it, it was amazing! and so easy.  Then there is my husband.  He hated it.  I asked him why, and he said it didn't taste right.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I really loved it... (I am not admitting if I ate what he didn't:) ).

I tried this recipe because I love pot pies.  It was very good, but I had to bake for about 10 minutes longer than called for. Next time, I will use jumbo muffin pans instead.
Will definitely do this again.

I boiled the chicken while preparing the rest of the ingredients. It needs salt and pepper, and I threw in some shredded potatoes, works best with crescent dough, I made 2 tubes of crescents and 2 tubes of regular biscuits. 
Chicken mixture made a lot more then I was expecting, so luckily I had extra biscuits in the fridge, however I could find 1 muffin tin (half dozen). So these pot pies were gone before I could get the next ones in the oven. All 4 people in the house overwhelmingly agreed that this is a keeper (even the husband who isn't a fan of pot pies)!

Loved this. I did as others suggested,using my hands to flatten the biscuit dough into the muffin tin. This would be a great recipe for young children to help make!

These are easy and a quick dinner for the family. Great way to get the kiddos to eat their veggies too! I added a sprinkle of bread crumbs on top and left them in the oven a bit longer for more browning and crispness.

This is simple to make, and hearty for a cool Fall day.

For the biscuit layer I used Grands biscuits. Knowing they are a little thick, I separated them into two thinner biscuits for the crusts. It made the biscuits go further, made the recipe less fattening, and a little less expensive.

This is the second time I've made this. It is incredible and easy!
This time, I used broccoli-cheddar soup instead of cream of chicken; 4 inch custard bowls, and used the second 4 biscuits as covers. Also, rather than having extra filling, I piled it on in a heap. Baked it for 35 mins.

I finally found a pot pie recipe that I like. I have tried quite a few but this one was delicious. I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions. I shredded a rotisserie chicken instead of using cubed chicken. I also added fresh minced garlic and rosemary to the mixture.

Loved it! My hubby thought it was a complicated dish and couldn’t stop raving about it! I diced chicken and threw it in a pan with seasonings; garlic powder, pepper, poultry seasoning, a touch of celery salt. Everything else the same. It was delicious! As my hubby says; ‘it’s a keeper!”

I make this recipe all the time for my family, after my husband roasts or grills a whole chicken I like to use the leftovers to make this pot pie. (yay for not having to waste food) The serving size is perfect and my two little ones eat it up. They love having their own size pot pies. :-)

I used crescent rolls, canned chicken breast chunks and canned mixed  vegetables along with a cheddar cheese blend which I mixed in.  I sprinkled Durkee’s French-fried onion pieces on top, baked the minis for 20 minutes and voila!  Dinner was served, accompanied by fresh sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and other raw vegetables.  So good!

Easy and delicious! I added about a half teaspoon of poultry seasoning to the mix. I do not have frozen mixed veggies, I used frozen peas, frozen corn, and added baby carrots that I had parboiled and sliced.

This is one of the best things I’ve eaten in a month. Things I changed: biscuit dough is too dough-y so I used pie crust (right next to the biscuit dough) cut with an extra large glass and gently pushed into the muffin tins. I even cut a smaller circle of dough for a pie top.  Darling little pies!  I also added a pinch of curry as someone else said and that was amazing. Cut some liquid from the filling and it was perfect.

With the exception of seasoning the chicken with poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary and baking the chicken and letting it cool and using it the next day, I followed the recipe exactly. I took off one star bc without seasoning the chicken like the recipe calls for, the chicken was bland. However with the revision it turned out great and flavorful & I got my 5 year old to eat her veggies.

They turned out great! I made chicken, potatoes and carrots in the crockpot the day before, so I just diced everything and put it in these cups. Turned out great. Went a bit longer than 15 mins, but they’re tasty!

My 11 year old and I made these. They were great. We could have added more filling to each biscuit. Next time. We also put a little biscuit on top because my daughter likes having crust to break into.

This is a definite make again for us- my picky daughter  loved it! I doubled the recipe (I rely on leftovers to get me through our busy weeks) so I used one can of Campbell's  cream of chicken and one can of cheddar  soup,  both Healthy Request.  I used Pillsbury junior biscuits and skipped the cheese on top. Lots of saved calories that we didn't miss and they were delish! Only 154 calories per muffin according to My Fitness Pal!

The basic recipe sounded so easy but I did add some additional spices as referred by other "chefs".  This is really tasty.  I love to cook but don't do a lot just for me, however recently my mom & I moved in together and I'm having to come up with things I haven't cooked in years. And with all the new sauces & spices available, I'm pretty lost.  So I'm enjoying reading and trying all your expert advice.  I gave a 4* because the original was good but not quite perfection.

Most  of the stars are for ease of preparation. I thought it was heavy and too salty. My husband likes soup-recipe food so I'll update this after I hear from him. I'll make it again if he likes it.

I divided a canister of Grands into 18 pieces rolled on a floured surface. Added black beans with veggies, taco-style seasonings and used Buffalo Chicken (recipe on this site). Baked beautifully in 20 mins. Terrific starter recipe/idea.

Not too bad. Very basic. I did like the biscuits with this as it gave such a good flavour. 
However, I did find that one tube of the biscuit mix was not enough. I could have easily made 20 of these pies instead of the 10 it says you can make because of how much fill was leftover from this! I froze the filling that I didn't use so that I can make more of these again soon and quickly.
Otherwise, it was a good, quick recipe and great for days that I don't want to have to do too much to make dinner, but if I'm craving a really good chicken pot pie, I will probably go to my other recipe.

We use pie crust for bottom, top and sides as. Yummy and quick recipe. It's so easy that even the kids can help. We use ramekins for pot pies. Everyone loves having their own pot pies.

they were delicious, but needed a little more baking time. 15 minutes weren't enough

I LOVE this recipe, but it takes way longer than 35 minutes. It's very tedious, but worth it! I have used it several times, and it's always a crowd-pleaser. I don't buy pre-cooked chicken, I cook and season myself. I highly recommend Rachael Ray's poultry grinder. I use any biscuits (usually Pillsbury original or maybe honey butter if I'm feeling adventurous), but make sure you don't get the FLAKY kind. Also make sure you SUPER spray each muffin tin.

These are awesome! I put my chicken breast in the slow cooker while at work. Once home I mixed the ingredients together added some oregano & poultry seasoning into the mixture. Rolled out the biscuits and placed in muffin tin & added mixture topping with cheddar cheese. These were quick, delicious & filling! Will definitely make again!!

These turned out very good.  However, I used this recipe as a base as I wanted more flavour so I added herb de provence and poultry seasoning to the chicken as it slowly fried.  Didn't have a mini-muffin pan so used a regular one and 2 larger pot pie aluminum trays to hold the mixture. Actually turned out to hold everything just fine.  Hubby really enjoyed these so I will make these again.

First, there isn't anything in the filling to add flavor so I added rosemary and thyme as well as salt and pepper. You can add any herbs -these just happen to be our favorite. The first time I tried this, I used refrigerator biscuits and was disappointed because the biscuits were still doughy and partly uncooked after 25 minutes in the oven. The second time, I made the biscuits myself (Cheddar Biscuits from this website)and used less dough per pie than the refrigerator biscuits were. That turned out much, much better.  With these changes, the family thought these were delicious!

I did use 1 can of Veg-All rather than frozen vegies.  I did not use the cheese.  I just don't think pot pies need cheese and I'm a cheese lover.  Next time I think I will use chicken gravy instead of the chicken soup.  These will also be good with turkey and left-over turkey gravy.   These are easy and fun to make.

It was a good base recipe and a very cool idea. However the recipe as made has too much salt and no other flavoring. Also makes a lot more filling than there are biscuits. We're working on improving this to our tastes. Definitely a keeper though.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and they turned out great for us. My picky eaters loved them. I love that they are the perfect portion for my children. Great recipe for a quick weeknight meal.

This was so yummy and super easy!  Was good as a leftover one day later, but three days later was soggy.  I will definitely make this again!

My husband and kids definitely loved this recipe. we had topped with sour cream which made it taste absolutely delicious (which was my idea lol because eat food with my sour cream lol). I might add tho I would try mixed vegetables in a can I feel like you can taste the artifialness in the frozen vegetables.  unless it was just me lol. otherwise enjoy!!

I have mixed feelings about these. I gave them three stars because my boyfriend and the kids loved them and keep asking me to make them again. I made these twice. The first time I made them as is except I seasoned the cooked chicken. I also used more chicken and vegetables than called for. That didn't seem to create much of a problem except there wasn't as much 'gravy'. I used grands large biscuits the first time I made them, and put them in the muffic tin exactly as the recipe states, and covered with cheese. but when they baked, the filling was hot, the cheese was melted but the dough was not cooked all the way through. And it certainly is not like a pot pie dough. It's a biscuit...very breadlike. The second time I made them, I cooked them longer. This time I had smaller biscuits so I used two for each muffin, and then on a couple I used one small biscuit, experimenting with the idea that maybe there was too much dough. With the one biscuit pies, the amount of dough did not work. They fell apart. With the two biscuit pies, I made sure to leave them in the oven long enough that they cooked, but then they were dry and that dried up some of the gravy as well. Incidentally I used American cheese on the second batch, and everyone said the cheddar is better. So basically the taste is not bad (my boyfriend said it reminded him of his childhood), but I keep workin on the crust.

This is an easy put together dinner that tastes pretty good if you season your chicken well. But if you're looking for that "from scratch taste" this is not the recipe for you.

Yum! Always love a good pot pie during the cold winter, but never want to go through the hassle. These are just the ticket! So easy and quick. I used Pillsbury Grands biscuits, so the crust was extra yummy. Cooked the chicken up with some garlic. Definitely will make it again!

"Soup"er simple and delicious. I used fresh veggies because that's what I had on hand, and steamed them in the microwave before adding them to the filling. Canned chicken made it quick and delish. I did add some garlic since the soup was a low sodium variety. My teen sons gobbled these up and asked how to make it for themselves in the future!

I add my own seasonings I add the veggies and soup in pan after I cook the chicken. Tastes sooo good!
