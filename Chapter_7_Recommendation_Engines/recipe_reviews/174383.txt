The glaze was awesome, though I tweaked it a bit. I used white grape with peach instead of apple juice and pomegranite instead of cranberry juice because that was what I had in the fridge. The consistency of the eggplant was a little mushy for my palate but I will use the glaze again for sure.

These were soooooo good. I did everything I could to find Japanese eggplants, searching the city for days, but no luck. I had to use regular eggplant, but they were very good anyway. Needing them for my NASCAR party, I cut them into rounds. The sauce is divine. For my next party, I'll serve them over little rice noodle nests!  Thank you for the recipe,
