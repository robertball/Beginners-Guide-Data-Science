I rated this a 4 as is, but I make a version that my family & friends give a 5 with giant portobello caps, which I marinate and then grill. My 17-year-old daughter asks for them about 3 times a week! I eliminate the salt, sub honey for sugar, use fresh oregano, omit the msg, use 1 tablespoon minced garlic, sub balsamic vinegar, reduce the pepper to 1/8 tsp and add about 1/4 c. soy sauce (hence the omitted salt, tho I add fresh-ground sea salt at the table), about 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, and a Tbs or so of chopped scallion if I have any on hand. I haven't marinated as long as 3 days; 24 hours seems plenty. I've also thrown in large pieces of bell pepper and chunks of zucchini, all of which have been a big hit among family & guests (including a lot of my daughter's teenaged friends).

I make something like this for summer potlucks, only I don't use MSG, I double the spices and I use a couple tbsp. of balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar. I could eat the whole bowl. You're best of doubling this at least. This recipe is good with baby bellas, too.

I used to buy marinated mushrooms from my local deli market, they were expensive. This is very tasty, same or better than my local deli. I don't use MSG, as probably it is used in the recipe as a food preserver, and my family makes sure that they don't last long in the fridge. I use balsamic, but red wine vinegar is good also. The use of red onions instead of yellow or white onions gives it a mellower flavor. I also add a squeeze of lemon or lime (whatever you have in hand), as it gives it a very fresh flavor. Other variations, use Crimini (Baby Bella) instead of Button Mushrooms, and also try the marinade brushed over grilled Portabella; simply wonderful. Double up on this one, inexpensive to make and extremely tasty.

Simple recipe - I substituted red onion, apple cider vinegar, and eliminated the MSG. We ate it the same night and the vinaigrette is good - gets better in the fridge. Very nice!

Made as directed except didn't add MSG, it gives me headaches. Family couldn't keep out of it for even 24 hours! Had to practically hide it to get it to the 3 day mark. Tangy, tasty, wonderful combination. Daughter even used the liquid to put on bread! Salty, slightly sweet, tangy, peppery, wonderful combination.

I skipped the msg and used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Double the spices and you're all set.  Wonderful flavor.  A little oily but I've never had marinated shrooms that weren't.  Thanks for the recipe.

I originally made this for my mushroom loving daughter who is at college.   She hated it because of the vinegar flavor.   However, I've continued to make it several times for myself.   I like it best the next day, and that's generally how I eat it.   I have been telling my buddies about these mushrooms and I told them that I think that they'd be great deep fat fried.   I followed the recipe exactly again, except this time, instead of leaving my onions in slices (because I like to eat them too) I put everything (except the mushrooms) in a blender to get as much flavor into the marinade as possible.   Then last night we breaded them in a store bought onion ring batter and deep fat fried them.   They were incredible.   That took this recipe and brought it to another level.   You gained about another 6 fans last night. I shared with them all this recipe.   I'm sure that it will be popular at all the camp sites this summer.   Thanks again for a fantastic recipe.

I used balsamic and red wine vinegars instead of white and local raw honey instead of sugar for extra flavor.  Didnt use any MSG.  Marinated one day, used 'shrooms in a pasta salad, really tasty.  Really liked marinating Portabella caps in it and then grilling as one reviewer mentioned.  YUM.  Nice take-along alternative for vegetarians going to a barbeque who dont want to eat a prepared GMO-laden soyburger.  Next time might try adding a little curry powder to the marinade.

I could eat all of 'em in one sitting, but I won't because Momma taught me to share. The only ingredient I didn't use was the MSG. I marinated them for 2 days. I will definitely make these again!

Doubled the spices (except for msg), used balsamic for 1/3 of the vinegar.  Delicious and a little spicy thanks to the red pepper flakes! Much better than the jarred kind from the grocery store.

Initially, I made two batches. One exactly as written and the other without the MSG. I found that the MSG makes this appetizer freaking awesome!!!

Simply wonderful!  Only substitute was red wine vinegar (instead of white).  Didn’t add MSG.  Delicious, couldn’t stop eating it.  Highly recommended.

I've made gallons of marinated mushrooms over the years but this tops any recipe I've used, including my own. I rate this 5 stars as I made it the first time  according to the recipe, eliminating the MSG, but changed a few  things the next time. I added fresh sliced sweet peppers  and simmered sauce ingredients for 2 minutes before pouring it over the salad. This makes the flavor go deeply into the veg,making it delicious and ready to eat a 
   couple of hours later.This is very good  with doubled sauce folded into small, sturdy cooked pasta for a great pasta salad or potato salad.

Now, these are marinated mushrooms. No cooking involved.  Decades ago we used to make these by marinating them in the Italian dressing of your choice.  These are awesome. The taste, the texture is exactly what it is supposed to be.  Bellissimo!!!

These just didn't work out for me.  All I tasted was vinegar.  The mushrooms were rubbery.

I omitted the vinegar and used 2 tablespoons. I also only made half but I doubled the garlic and red peppers. I also added some yellow bell pepper just because I had them already. We let them marinate for 3 days but I was tasting them the second day and they were so good! They were super delicious!! I can't wait to share with friends. We served this with steak and asparagus. I think it would also be really great with pasta and/or salad.
