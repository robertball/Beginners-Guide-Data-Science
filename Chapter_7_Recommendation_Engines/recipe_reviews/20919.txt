These muffins are awesome!  They are a huge hit with the family every time I make them.  They work especially well as mini-muffins.
-------
Update:  I now use this recipe as a base for other muffins, like replace the nutmeg with vanilla and add 1 cup of blueberries.  Delish!

You can check out my daughter making these for Christmas in this video:  https://youtu.be/YzDbEhQXjko?list=UU0RH8Zq9I6SyepTVRaUU1Qw

These were extremely tasty. And i doubt you could mess the recipe up if you tried...and... this was one of *those* mornings. I halved the recipe, using just the egg white, which i added to too-hot butter.. it curdled up... no matter! Except the batter was consequently too thick.. added a little more milk until it looked right... proceed! I also thought i'd cut the butter and sugar down just a little (about 25%), as part of my ongoing quest for calorie-wise baked goods. I then let my 6-year-old manhandle the batter into the pan, stirring and shovelling until well beyond the "barely moistened" stage. After all that, my expectations of the end result were not that high. But, lo and behold, they were superfantastic... could serve to guests.. tasted like something you might get at a classy B&B. My kiddo thought they tasted like "pudding" (the nutmeg flavour reminded him of my rice pudding i guess). Dense yet tender with a fabulous aroma. This will become a weekend staple in my house. Instead of dipping in butter/sugar, i applied the butter with a pastry brush and sprinkled sugar over (you use a lot less that way).

My kids loved these!  They are not light and fluffy like store-bought muffins, but instead they have a nice pound cake-like texture.  They travel well (not too big and not too crumbly) and make a great breakfast or snack on the go.  Thanks, Kelly!

well, it's not like this needs another review, but... i made the recipe as stated and: added generous amounts of ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves to the flour. (i subbed gluten-free flour 1:1) i added vanilla to the egg mixture. added chopped frozen mango and pecans to the flour before adding the egg mixture. they only took 14 minutes to bake. these are a keeper--lots of possibilities to play....

One of the simplest muffin recipes on here!  Very tasty and done in no time.  I wouldn't change a thing...except to make more next time.  Definitely serve warm! Perfect with a cup of tea!

I grew up making these favorites for Sunday morning breakfast.  The only thing we did differently was instead of putting them in muffin cups, we poured the batter into well-greased muffin tins, then immediately after taking them out of the oven, we dipped the whole muffin in butter then rolled it in cinnamon sugar.  They certainly weren't dry!

Yum!  I just made these.  So simple and delicous.  I made mini muffins and baked them for 12 minutes.  My 4 year old dipped them in the butter and c/s mixture.  This is a keeper for sure.

These came out great! I took some of the advice in other reviews and changed 1/2 cup sugar to 1/4 sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I should have taken everyone's advice and halved the topping recipe; there was still a lot of sugar left that I didn't want to put on for fear of making them too sweet.  I suppose they do taste cakey, but I like cakey : )  Excellent recipe!

These are ok. They are small muffins and I filled the muffin pans 3/4 full. For the final step,  I didn't dip them into butter, instead I painted it on w/ a pastry brush and just sprinkled on the cinnamon/sugar.  This way I used less of each ingredient.  They are not that sweet, so do add the topping as it needs it.  It's also not that hearty of a muffin. Accually, it's more like some kind of cake (maybe a pound cake or coffee cake?)than a muffin.   THX.

I used 1/4C white sugar,1/4C brown sugar and added chopped walnuts.  Seems to be a good basic muffin as is or using variations.

There is not enough liquid called for in the recipe. I had to add about another 1/4 cup of milk to make these into muffins.

I was disappointed with these. I guess I should have listened to the reviews that said they were dense, but they were also rather dry and I had to smear more butter on them to eat them. Will not be making again, thanks anyway!

I have no idea what's French about these muffins, but they were pretty good. Like most reviewers, I also agreed the texture of these was a little "Bisquick-y" (crumbly), however, that's generally what happens when you use melted butter, rather than creaming it. No worries, I expected this texture and it was fine. I cut the nutmeg down to 1/8 tsp, and was glad I did. A little nutmeg goes a long way! I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a few extra shakes of cinnamon to the batter (which reminded me of cookie dough consistency), so I added a little extra milk for ease in getting into the muffin pan. I used a mini muffin pan and got 22 minis. For the topping, I melted 4 T butter in a saucepan, dipped the tops right into there and then rolled the tops into the cinnamon-sugar mixture, which honestly, I just eyeballed until it looked right to me. Not too sweet (for me...my husband thought they were). I found them a good accompaniment to my morning coffee. I'll make these again!

soooo good! TIPS FOR VERY, VERY GOOD MUFFINS: 1st, if you don't have any eggs replace it with 1/2 C. buttermilk, and lower the measurement of (normal) milk to 1/4 C.. 2nd, for an amazing icing you will need to have - one 8oz. package of cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1 1/2 C. confectioners sugar. Soften the cream cheese, then mix all the ingredients until smooth and creamy. When your muffins are done lavish the icing on your YUMMY muffin/cupcakes. I hope this helps, ENJOY!

These are soooo good!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I followed other reviewers' suggestion to brush the melted butter on top of the muffins instead of dipping them.  I also used closer to 1/2 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg just because I love the flavor.  My ultra-picky 5 year old wolfed down a whole muffin as soon as I pulled them out of the oven, so I will definitely make these again!

Much like Dianne's Donut Muffins, only on a larger scale, so not as much dipping required after baking.  These baked up light, moist and were a fabulous breakfast treat.  I always use the full amount of nutmeg (LOVE that spice), and the whole family loves these muffins.  We even had a few leftover, and they were great reheated the following morning.

I was looking for a muffin recipe that was easy and that I could adapt on occasion. This is a very easy recipe.  As is, the muffins were good, but tasted more like a biscuit than a muffin.  I made the recipe a second time and added 1 c Blueberries (and omitting the nutmeg for vanilla) - the muffins were scrumptious!  I will definitely be making these mufffins on a regular basis.  Thanks, Kelly!

The end result was tasty, but only because I adjusted the ratio of wet to dry ingredients. I would also add a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda next time. the batter was far too dry when I used the original proportions- if I had kept stirring it it would have been more of a dough. The secret to a fluffy muffin with a nice dome is minimal stirring. I would not make this recipe again.

Very good, we made this for our Christmas morning muffins and everyone enjoyed them.  The batter did seem thick but we stuck to the recipe and they came out just fine.  We were only able to get 11 muffins out of the batter so if you need more you have will to double it.  Also, the amount of butter and sugar/cinnamon called for to dip after cooling was way too much.  I would half it if you are making a single batch.

These muffins are good but not extraordinary. After making so many cakes, breads, etc with pretty much the same ingredients I get picky as to which is a 5 star recipe that stands out in taste and texture. I tend to compare my baked goods with bakeries and always try to get professional results. The texture is light and fluffy. To avoid texture that is tough and dense, be sure not to overmix the ingredients. Although some reviewers said to sprinkle the sugar mixture on top as opposed to dipping them, I dipped them for fear they would not come out sweet enough since other reviewers said the muffin itself wasn't sweet enough. The taste was good and so was the presentation. But again it wasn't like "Wow, these are really something!".

These muffins are better than doughnuts!! they are so good and they are a bit more dense than regular muffins. A very good recipe! I did it as it, but added a 1/4 teas. vanilla to the egg mixture. I'll definately be making these again!

These are good. They kind of remind me of vanilla cake or pound cake, which is fine, but I think I would add some fruit or nuts next time. Thanks for the recipe!

We liked these because they weren't too sweet and though there's nothing wrong with sweet muffins it just hit the spot when we had them. The good thing too is you can add as much or as little of the cinammon-sugar mix at the end.

My boys loved these this morning! I have been meaning to make them for a few weeks, I don't know why I waited! They were excellent warm with a pat of butter. I tried them both ways---with and w/o the cinn./sugar topping and they were a bit bland w/o the topping but soooo good with! I think the topping makes them exceptional. Beautiful presentation, too, they rose really high. I did add more milk to the mix as it seemed dry and I also subbed the nutmeg for half tsp. vanilla as one reviewer suggested.

I wanted to do something a little special and different for my kids for breakfast. I found this recipe ( I've made one like it before and they were disappointingly dry and heavy. I decided to give it one more shot. I subbed buttermilk ,grated the nutmeg fresh, and sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar on the muffins before baking to avoid having to dip them in butter. They turned out SOOO fluffy! They were SO fast to mix up and bake, they're going in my permanant recipe file. Thank you!!

Very good and very customizable.  -1 star because the muffin itself is pretty dry, also I had to use just a little more milk to get the batter consistency right. I recommend using mini-muffin tins. However, this is where great recipes begin. A simple, easily customizable recipe with a simple, delectable flavor.

wonderful...light and perfect!  I followed to the letter BUT added a few of my own touches.  A whole lemon, juiced and rind.  1/4 additional sugar as I was adding 1 cup blueberries.  Added an addl TBs or so of flour to offset the additional liquid.  These are perfect muffins, very very tender.  I'd serve them to Julia or Martha any time.  They are that good.  THANK YOU.

We had mixed reviews in our house on this one. I thought they were good, my hubby only gave them a 3 and my 6-year old said he'd give it a 2 1/2 :) It's definitely not what you think of when you think of a typical "muffin." In our family, we all eat our muffins the same way: we take the tops off, eat the bottoms first and then the tops. You can't do that with these. I wouldn't necessarily say they remind me of pound cake, as others have suggested, but it's definitely a different texture than your typical muffin. We ate them straight from the oven after dipping them in the butter and cinn/sugar mixture. I thought they were pretty yummy when warm but I don't think they'd be as good once they cool a bit more. If you're looking for something that's not as sweet as your typical muffin then you'd probably like this recipe.

perfect with so many different ways to use them.  Instead of topping with cinnamon and sugar you can also use these for strawberry shortcake.

Oh my goodness these are sooooo delicious! Such a simple recipe. I followed the recipe for the most part. I had to add a little bit more milk. I made mini muffins and they were done in about 13 minutes. Before I popped them out of the pan I sprayed them with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and used my McCormick Cinnamon and Sugar grinder. I will definitely be making these again! My toddler LOVES them :o)

My mom has been making these muffins for years, this is the closest I have found to her recipe, delicious! The only thing she does differently, sorry for all you calorie counters, she doesn't use paper liners, and when the muffins come hot out of the oven, pours the melted butter over each muffin (so the butter will collect in the bottom of the pan) then removes the muffins to roll in cinnamon and sugar. Not very healthy, but soooo good!!!

Light and fluffy, I halved the recipe and made about 8 smallish muffins. Didn't have any leftovers so they must have been yummy! Didn't change a thing :)

This is a great muffin recipe.  When they are warm, they are outstanding, light and fluffy.  Definitely best when warm.  As they cool down, they are still VERY good, but they lose a lot of the lightness of a warm muffin.  I took these to work and they gobbled them up.  I baked mine in mini muffin pans.  A recipe that I will be using again.

It's 10:00 at night, I have been dying to make this recipe - whipped them up in no time. I even used a mini muffin tin as someone else mentioned, awesome!!!  Instead of nutmeg, used vanilla, also someone else mentioned.  Brushed on the melted butter and just shook on cinnamon sugar while in the tin still. Loved loved loved this one.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you so much for an amazing and easy one!

These muffins are so simple to make, and soooo yummy. Especially love that all ingredients are staples in the pantry/fridge, so they're perfect to throw together without having to go to the market for anything. I've made them 3 times now using mini muffin tins, and I think they are the best this way. (Reduce baking time to 12 min.) Just made a batch to take to work tomorrow - back by popular demand!!

YUM! Absolute hit with the little ones.....and my husband, to be honest. I made these with my oldest boy this morning and we had a good old time together. This was simple enough for him to follow the instructions almost entirely by himself, with a little help from me. Only made one change and that was adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract but I subtracted a teaspoon of milk so the recipe wouldn't be affected.

When reading the recipe and looking at the picture, I thought it would be really sweet- more like a dessert than a muffin. I just bit into my first one and the texture is thick like a breakfast scone or biscuit. The top with a little bit of butter and cinni-sugar gives it a small crunch on the top of my mouth. I am very pleased.

Meehh...they were okay with the topping, but I would call these a biscuits, not muffins. The batter was like dough; not runny like a muffin batter. I had to reread the ingredients list to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I expected them to be lighter and fluffier, but I've never had French muffins before.  I won't be making them again.

Nice recipe!  I'm always looking for make-ahead breakfast items for the workweek.  These are perfect.  They're light and fluffy (stir as little as possible and they'll come out this way)  and they don't crumble too much, so they're easy to transport on the go. As other reviewers have said, they NEED the cinnamon/sugar mix on the top though if you make the recipe as written. These take about 20 minutes in the toaster oven on 750W.

These muffins are delicious! I don't change anything in the recipe but for a shortcut I buy the cinnamon sugar shaker, and brush the tops of the muffins with the butter and shake this on top. I've made these a couple of time and they smell and taste amazing!

I have made these French Breakfast Puffs since I was in high school 40 years ago! I tried this recipe for a French class I was taking. I can't even remember where I originally found the recipe as I have it typed onto a large index card. They are my favorite muffins and so easy to make. A recipe that has stood the test of time!

Great recipe! Everyone loved these, even my sister's super-picky kids. My nephew dubbed them "churro muffins" which I think is an accurate description of their flavor. They're sweet but not too sweet, fairly dense but not greasy, and curiously addictive. I followed the recipe exactly except that I made them as mini muffins (12 minutes was perfect for the baking time). They puff up nicely, look cute, and taste great!

I omitted the nutmeg and added vanilla -- very yummy! Did not need the whole 1/3 cup butter to dip in when they were done. Wonderful when warm :)

These are SO easy and they are very good.  I made the recipe as is, but will make it again with suggestions from other reviewers.  I will cut the nutmeg in half (and maybe omit entirely) and add 1 tsp of vanilla.  

These are great to make and then warm up in microwave for 15 seconds before heading out the door to work.

Instead of sprinkling with cinnamon sugar, I get a packet of cream cheese, add several vigorous dashes of cinnamon, 3-4 heaping spoonfuls of powder sugar, and microwave. Mix and taste, add more cinnamon/sugar as needed. :) then I either heap it onto the muffins or make little holes in them to fill. Delish!

HOLY DENSE! For a breakfast muffin.. no. I followed the recipe to a T and the batter was so dense I could barley mix it. I was tempted to roll it out on a surface and cut it into "pucks" and stack those in the muffin cups. I ended up adding more milk then spoon dropping them in. 
They have barely any taste which would be ok, if they weren't so dense. And if I were thinking, I'd put the cinnamon and sugar on top BEFORE baking, versus all that work after baking just for breakfast. I will not, ever, make these again.

I didn't care for these much.  I followed the recipe exactly.   I'm glad that we tried them prior taking them to a breakfast potluck.  Had to stop off at the store to pick up something else.  They were dry and heavy.

I had imagined these being light and airy, but they are rather dense, almost like a corn muffin.  I followed the recipe exactly and found them lacking in flavor.  They reminded me of snickerdoodle cookies, which I'm not a fan of.

I'll definitely make this recipe again!  I substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg (didn't have any nutmeg), a little bit of vanilla, and used 3/4 cup sugar because I actually intended to use the recipe for cupcakes.  I got 9 nice sized muffins/cupcakes from the recipe.  We tried them both with vanilla frosting ("cupcake style") and with the butter and cinnamon sugar ("muffin style") and loved them both ways.  I would consider adding raisins or blueberries or something to make different kinds of muffins, but the base recipe is really delicious!  Oh and we've named them Mupcakes because they're kind of muffins and kind of cupcakes.

This was very easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. I followed the recipe exactly and will probably continue to do so.  The batter seemed to be too thick and I used a cookie scoop to fill the muffin cups, but once they started cooking they were fine.  To me they taste like a cake donut.  Yum!

I just made these tonight for dinner (we had Slow Cooker Ham and Lentil Soup from this site) and they are so tasty!  (How could they not be- they're dipped in butter and sugar!)  I think the recipe should make 9 or 10 muffins instead of 12 though, because most of my muffins were tiny.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter for the topping and I had some leftover.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  My Mom makes muffins just like these and I haven't had them since I lived there!

These are amazing! I made them according to the recipe but used cinnamon and no nutmeg but I still think they tasted great! For the cinnamon/sugar topping I dipped the top of it in butter first, then the cinnamon sugar mixture, let the butter soak in for a couple minutes and then dipped it in the cinnamon mixture only (not the butter again) and then they were finished. I will definitely make these again, DELICIOUS!

This recipe did not make 12 muffins--it made 9 small muffins.  They tasted really good, but the recipe did not make enough muffins.  I added cinnamon to the batter to create some more flavor; I think I'll add a little vanilla next time, as well.   Overall, I really liked the muffins--I just wish the recipe had made more.

Life is a matter of time and circumstance I made this without the recipe in front of me and using what I believe is more nutmeg than the recipe called for as I do not appreciate the American manner of commercialization regimented cooking as it matches the extremism of their politics on both the left and right and thinking generally. Again generally I liked it though it was modified for one I did not did make a cinnamon sugar dip nor topped them with butter sugar cinnamon though that may be a good idea in addition to adding the sugar and butter to the batter as I have my one extremes and do well to ignore diets dieting dieters doctors dietitians strict vegans so as to be permitted to use butter, and generally all sorts of "health freaks". As I endure my suffering with a fine palatable life of milk and honey though often also I enjoy creamer substitutes. In any case this will do fine as I enjoyed it as it was easy in my tight kitchen. As I envision making more of these muffins on which I can develop from their fine simple origins as that is what I like about recipes  that can be built on though cinnamon I feel will overwhelm the nutmeg.

These are absolutely delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. I left out the nutmeg just because I'm not a huge fan. My 2 year old is currently licking the cinnamon sugar off of his muffin so I'd say he approves. One note, I was only able to make 9 full sized muffins, not 12.

They tastes good, but i thought they would be a little bit bigger and taster, the truth is that only the butter cinnamon mixture gives some flavor.

Mine didn't turn out as fluffy the photo. They were pretty easy and quick to make but they weren't that great. Just ok. As someone mentioned, they were a little crumbly like biscuits.

light but dense "muffins"- tastes more like pound cake, but bite size. recipe makes less than 12 muffins- might want to double the recipe; and really just needed pantry ingredients- my kind of recipe!
we used mini brownie pans instead and they were perfect size for coating with butter and cinnamon sugar. my family gobbled up w/in minutes!

They tasted like biscuits. No flavor at all.  No one in my house ate them. I rather make biscuits and snicker doodles.

Taste is ok.  Amount of melted butter for topping is excessive, probably only need 2-3 Tbsp. I would make this again with a totally different meal- dinner.

One of the best all purpose muffin recipes ever, especially for food service. The recipe works as well in a batch for 96 as it does for 12. They are not too sweet so without the topping they can also double as a lunch or supper bread. - Wheeler Cook

With the mixed reviews this received, I wasn't sure what to expect (but I had to try them).  I don't know if the liquid amounts have been changed since the recipe first appeared, but this made into a nice batter that easily filled 12 muffin cups 2/3 full. I baked them for 22 minutes, then brushed the tops with butter (less than 1 T.)while still in the pan, sprinkled generously with cinnamon sugar and removed them to a cooling rack. My husband and I both think they're delicious! They have a nice light texture, and a nice spice taste, not overpowering.  I used freshly grated nutmeg. I changed nothing in the recipe except the way I put on the topping.

These muffins were fantastic! One of my new fav recipes from allrecipes.com!! With that said, I only got 7 recipes out of this, did anybody really get 12?! The recipe just says to fill the muffin tins with the batter, it doesn't say 1/2 full or 3/4...I did about 3/4 and got 7.  Next time I will double this!

This recipe is really light and does not have all lot flavor but, these muffin are good to eat with some tea also does not make all lot of muffins so I would double it.If you are in a hurry these muffins bake really fast so keep your eye on them when there in the oven.Overall there are good and bad things about these muffins.

These were delicious, just like the ones I buy from a popular cafe here in the Bay Area (N. Cal). I used 1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup granulated white sugar for the batter (instead of just 1/2 cup white sugar as the recipe requires) bc that's what the local cafe does. Also, this recipe only yielded 9 regular muffins -- not 12!

This recipe is one of the best recipes I have for muffins. I couldn't find milk, so I substituted it with coconut milk. I found 25 minutes of baking time resulted in a crunchy top with a soft inside, but for those who like a soft muffin top, I would recommend baking them for only 20 minutes. These were the perfect sweetness, just right for an after dinner "snack". This one is a keeper!!

Well, although mine didn't come out like in the picture, they were still yummy. I added in some blueberries and subbed nutmeg for vanilla. They didn't seem ready after just 25 minutes so I left them in for 10 more minutes. (I was kind of hesitant because I didn't want them to burn but they came out fine). Good breakfast muffins

These were good, but not quite "puffy". I did substitute flax seed for half of the butter in the batter, so that could have contributed, but they were a lot denser than I would expect, even with the substitution. I love the flavor. It reminds me a lot of a cinnamon covered cake donut. I will definitely make them again.

Not bad! The texture more resembles an American biscuit than a muffin, though. Still, this is a quick, easy recipe for little morsels that go well taken with coffee or tea!

I know some people hate it when you change around the recipe but I had extra buttermilk so I had to use it and I thought this recipe seemed to be a good one to use some of it.  I did all the dry ingredients the same with the exception of adding a little extra nutmeg of course and 1t vanilla.  I cut down the melted butter to 4T to mix with the buttermilk and a little bit of vanilla spice eggnog that I had on hand, being its almost Christmas.    Instead of melting more butter to dip the finished muffins in, I just sprinkled some splenda and cinnamon on them 10 minutes before they were finished cooking.  Yumm, they are light and fluffy and wonderful.  I'll probably be making more for my fiancé and roommate tomorrow.

Best muffin I have EVER had in all my 14 years!! I didn't have any eggs... and I couldn't find any applesauce to substitute... so I used vegetable oil inslead. I also added cinnimon to go with the nutmeg and it turned out great. I topped it with my own very special caramel sauce. Turned out sublime! You really can't screw this recipe up. :)

These are really delicious as everyone's mentioned. I think some orange zest could be really delicious here.  Trust in the recipe and don't do what I did - after 25 minutes, I thought the tops didn't look golden yet, so I left it in for another 3 minutes, and they came out very dry.  I also brushed the tops with the butter (only needed 1-2 tablespoons), and sprinkled the tops with sugar (only ended up needing 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon), and they were perfectly sweetened.  I microwave these for 15 seconds because I like them warm.

Very yummy with a great texture!  My only complaint was that I reduced the minimum bake time by 5 minutes just to make SURE they didn't burn, and they were still burnt on the bottom by the time I pulled them out (standard size muffin tin).  So I would say definitely start checking these around 12 minutes, because by 15, they were burnt for me.

This recipe left me guessing.  It turned out quite dense and heavy with a cornbread like texture. It was also very dry. I'm not sure if I did something wrong of if that's normal for this particular recipe.

The muffin is rather like a slightly spiced biscuit, but it balances really well with all of the buttery, cinnamon-sugary goodness.

Pretty standard muffin recipe. I through in some oat flour and ground flax seed to make them a little more hearty for breakfast. Definitely make less of the topping and brush the muffin tops with a pastry brush -- less waste this way.

These are great simple muffins. The batter makes just enough to enjoy in one morning, but doesn't really leave much for afterwards - which isn't really a problem to me since I think muffins should be enjoyed when they're first baked.

They are okay, not great...I think it is a good base.  If I try to make it again, I will add fresh blueberries.  The changes I made to the recipe were adding 1/4t vanilla and I only used 1T butter to top the muffins.  It was plenty and I would cut the cinnamon/sugar in half.  It is way too much!  I have a regular muffin pan and it did make 12.  I sprayed the muffin pan and the spoon I used to fill the pan.  Very easy.

These muffins are so nice! I followed the directions and measurements exactly and I only came out with 8 muffins, but I'm guessing that it because of the size of my muffin pan.  The nutmeg is delicious and the cinnamon sugar topping ties it all together so well.  exactly 20 minutes at 350 made these perfectly moist and tender. I took the advice of others and used a pastry brush for the butter and then just sprinkled the tops of the muffins with sugar.  I probably used about 1/8 cup of sugar and thought it was the perfect amount of additional sweetness; I'm sure 1/4 cup would have been too much for me.  Thanks so much Kelly!

Very good, but more of a dessert then a breakfast.  I made a mistake and mixed the cinnimon sugar with the melted butter, but I drained some of the butter off then dipped the muffins.  The nutmug over powers the muffins a little, so it either needs more spices, or no nutmeg.

Followed recipe exactly except substituted nutmeg for vanilla extract and it tasted very good.  Would halve the sugar/cinnamon combo, recipe calls for more than needed.

really tasty. I made these into mini muffins and got 24 out of the recipe. I baked at 350 for about 13 minutes, which was about a minute or 2 too long - IMHO. They didnt get too brown, but they did get a little dry.. my fault. I dunked the entire mini muffin in butter and rolled the whole thing in the cinnamon sugar mixture

Made recipe as is w/ no changes. Very good! Light, crumbly texture. Flavor is simple, but good. Great in the morning with a cup of coffee. The batter doesn't quite make a dozen, though. I got 9 medium size muffins out of it, but that's fine.

These turned out fantastic!  I happened to not have nutmeg, so I substituted vanilla, and they taste amazing.  Like the other reviews said I used a brush to put the butter on then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar on.  Additionally, I had my muffins on a cooling rack sitting on a cookie sheet so it could catch any extra butter and cinnamon.  Again, these were fantastic.

These were edible, not great though and I wont make them again. They were very bland and not sweet even with the topping. Maybe more sugar and vanilla might help, I am not wasting the ingredients to find out though.

These were easy, quick and tasty.  My kids thought they were ok the morning I made them but they commented that they were better that night.  Next time I will follow the recommendation to brush butter on the tops and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mix over the tops.  I think these would be a fun muffin to pack as a snack on a car trip.

These were a little "nutmeg-y" for me.  I would prefer a cinnamon-brown sugar crunch mixed in instead.  The C/S crunch on top was good! The texture was also really dense and yummy, and they were nice sized--small, but not tiny.  I think I'll try them next time with a brown sugar/cinnamon mix swirled in (or like one reviewer said, with vanilla and blueberries)

I'm giving this 4 stars because they were so easy and I had everything in the house to make them! I used a mini muffin pan and baked them for 12 minutes. I halved the recipe and got 10 mini muffins. I didn't give it 5 stars because they are kind of plain. Next time I will sub half of the butter for applesauce and I'll add some vanilla and cinnamon to the batter itself. Thanks for the base recipe though, and I LOVE the texture!

i found my batter was really sticky almost doughy, so i added a bit more milk. They baked okay, but they were rather plain and not very good. I'll try adding more spices to the mix next time

These are ok.  I added a tad more sugar to the batter since many said they were not sweet enough and it filled 24 mini muffins perfectly.  My husband asked if I used refrigerated biscuits (which is not a good sign) and he said that all he could taste was cinnamon-sugar.  These are cute, fast and easy to make but they just were not what I was looking for.  They keep well for a few days which is nice -my mom thought they were pretty good with a cup of coffee! UPDATE: To the batter I added 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 tsp ginger, chopped walnuts & craisins.  Before baking I sprinkled raw sugar & cinnamon on the tops.  They were tasty but next time I'll make the same additions but do the butter & cinn-sugar topping instead.

I thought it's a little bit too dry. I'll probably have to add another egg to make it a little bit more moist.

These muffins were awesome! I made them in the mini muffin papers and they were so adorable. Plus, the smaller size allowed more the the sugary-crispy topping per bite than a large muffin. It was a perfect recipe for using things I already had around the house without needing a special trip to the store.

These were very good, very easy muffins to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some cinnamon and a little bit more sugar to the dry mix.  I was only able to get 10 muffins out of it, but they came out perfect.  Some people said they didn't think they would taste as good once they had cooled, but we ate them for breakfast the next morning and they still tasted yummy to me!  It's always fun to find a quick easy recipe made with stuff I already have in my pantry.

These tasted like a cinnamon sugar donut, very good.  They were smaller than I was expecting, and didn't make twelve.  I will surely make again, my young children loved them.

These muffins are simple but the kids liked them very much.  I substituted apple sauce for 1/2 the butter and used margerine instead as I had no butter.  I suggest doubling the recipes as it yields very small muffins that go very quickly. They are quite elegant looking as well.

This recipe will definitely be used again. I just made my first batch this morning, and they're great! I am the only one to try them at the moment, my mom and I are the only one's up at the moment, and she's getting ready for work. I have to be honest, I made them for family members to have something to eat before they go to school/work, but I already ate three of them so far. I did alter the recipe, by adding cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. I was going to add brown sugar, but didn't have any. I read reviews before this, and i don't know if it's the size of the pan, or what, but I was able to get 12 muffins out of the recipe.

I was disappointed. The texture of these muffins were so much less fluffy than I was anticipating and they needed to be sweeter. Without the sugar and cinnamon on top they would have been inedible.

Although I personally did not try one of these muffins, my siblings polished off a whole batch in one sitting, and said that they were really good! These muffins were very easy to make, and went over very well with my picky family! Thanks for a good recipe!

These get five stars for the following reasons:  TEXTURE - It is very donut-like.  EASE - Took all of four minutes to put together.  STAPLES - Every ingredient is always in the house.  I went ahead and added a kiss of ginger, cloves and cinnamon with the nutmeg.  Kids went wild for these, in fact, I got a "Kitchen March 'n' Chant" from the wee lad.

If you like healthy, hearty muffins this is not the one for you.  I thought the flavor was lacking as well.  I'm sure it is just a personal taste thing - mine being different than those who like this recipe.

This turned out delicious and moist! It was so easy to make and for the first time, I have all the ingredients in my fridge! I changed nothing in the recipe. It is true that the cinnamon and sugar coated at the end adds the perfect taste. This is a keeper!

I made a few changes to the recipe.  I substituted 1/2 c of white flour for whole wheat flour.  I also added 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  I think the next time I make it I will add 1/2 c of applesauce.  Overall it was good and easy.  My 10 year old daughter did most of the work.

Good recipe, however I tweaked it a bit. Instead of nutmeg I put 1 tsp. fresh lemon rind and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.
I made 8 muffins out of the recipe which are a nice size, not huge nor small. For the topping I just spread each one with some butter, then sprinkled Demarara sugar mixed with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. They turned out really nice.

These are great!!! I make these all the time and my sister loves them. I have to substitute the milk with rice milk because I am allergic to dairy and they still come out great! They are great to make for the morning if you don't have enough time to make anything else in the morning. Super easy!

After reading everyone's reviews on this French Breakfast Muffin, I decided to make a few minor changes.

First, I added 1/4 cottage cheese to make it moist and light and I also added golden raisins for substance.  This is a recipe that I would definitely make again but I would add fruits, nuts, coconut, whatever I was in the mood for.

I like this recipe. The only thing is that it took longer than 25 minutes to bake.  I let the muffins bake for 35 minutes and they still didn't appear golden brown.  It could have been because of the cottage cheese.

Thanks for the tip about brushing the baked tops with the melted butter and, yes...1/3 cup of melted butter is way too much for the topping.

Enjoying this website very much.  I've found alot of great recipes.

Thanks!

These muffins were okay, but a little bland.  As someone else said, getting 12 muffins out of the batter makes for some very small muffins.  I would probably do 6 from the same amount if I made them again.  Also, for anyone that isn't fond of nutmeg, they probably won't like these.  A coworker that had one thought the nutmeg was "overwhelming" and didn't even finish the small muffin.

Very good! Fast, easy and tasty.  I haven't had a lot of luck with muffins, but these were nice, not pasty at all. I added a quarter tsp.of cinnamon to the batter with the nutmeg.  When I make again, I would brush the butter on and sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar, as another reviewer suggested.  Would be great with fruit preserves too.

These are very tasty. Not too sweet either. Almost like coffee cake in flavor and texture. Very thick batter, very pale color when done. I added a half tsp of vanilla the second time I made these. Barely enough batter for 12 regular sized muffins they were on the smallish side. There was way too much melted butter for dipping though and I used less then half of what was melted. Easy and fast, great little recipe, Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  Perfect for a light breakfast; if you can keep yourself from eating the entire batch!

I decided to make these last night to take to a potluck today.  Foolishly, I didn't taste-test these before taking them to work because I wasn't hungry before bed when I finished making them last night and was in a rush to get to work this morning. Once at work, I grabbed one to try. They were okay but too sweet for me. A couple people came up to me and said that they were really good while others had no comment. I came home with half a batch left. Really, they're not bad, but more like a dense, sugary doughnut...which isn't bad if you like those types of sweets. I plan on sending the rest with my boyfriend who can pawn them off at work. Worth a try though!

These muffins were very easy and quick to make, and the result was a nice muffin -- not an extraordinary taste, but a good texture. The second time I made them, I replaced the butter in the recipe with sunflower oil and added a dash of cinnamon to the batter, along with a chopped apple. The apple was the perfect addition, and they didn't last until noon. Next time, I think I'll make 10 muffins instead of 12, as they were a bit on the small side.

Made these as stated in recipe. Texture was beautiful. They were rather bland tasting. This would be an excellent base recipe to add fruits & nuts to your liking. I think the texture makes this recipe worth keeping.

These are fantastic! Easy to prepare also. Even family members that don't care for muffins were going back for 2nds. Way too much butter used for topping. Next time I'll melt much less and put it on with a pastry brush. It will be easier to control how much butter is put on rather than just dunking the muffin in the butter. But still, all in all, wonderful. This will certainly show up on my table over and over again.

These are absolutely delicious!  Instead of dipping the tops in butter, I simply rubbed them with a stick of butter immediately after pulling them out of the oven.  Then I sprinkled them with the cinnamon mixture.

This recipe is so easy, and so delicious! It's been well over four years since I last made this, and I was really excited to make it tonight.  I'm basically building my new household from scratch, so I didn't have nutmeg when I went to make these tonight.  Instead, I added some cinnamon to the flour mixture and then added vanilla to the liquid mixture.  Delicious!

I used almond milk , unsalted butter and I substituted 1/2 cup of oatmeal flour and only used one cup of the all purpose flour. I also used Mexican Morena sugar instead of white sugar.

Mine don't look as pretty as some of the others pictured. Maybe that isn't important, but I would like to make them again and see if I can't improve. Number one, I'll not use my regular muffin tin, but the one for smaller muffins (and maybe increase the recipe by half). Number two, I will grease the muffin wells rather than using paper, because the paper in my opinion interferes with giving  them a good dip in melted butter and the sugar-cinnamon mixture while they're still warm. Pulling the paper off is a mistake, as it can't be done without damaging the muffins at least somewhat. Number three, I will try to get the dough into the muffin wells and then round the top with a (greased) measuring spoon so that they some out looking even and domed rather than lumpy. After all, we want French muffins to look worthy of Paris, don't we?

This recipe is SOOO tasty. If you put vanilla extract instead of nutmeg and the ln put a splash of vanilla in the bitter that you dip. SOOO good me and my family love it. (It looks cool of you use food dye in a marble effect with different colors)

Love this recipie. A favorite with the kids. I attempted a similar recipie featured here ( donut muffins) to very disappointing, overly sweet results. This recipie is what that recipie was attempting to be. It’s better in every way and is loved by the adults and kids alike. Don’t change a thing, make it as is.

Highly recommended.

One thing I hate are muffins that make your teeth hurt from being sweet. These weren't they.  They were not heavy. They have the perfect balance for coffee, hot chocolate,  tea or juice. I made no changes but already am trying to figure out what to put in it next. Oh! Maybe blueberries. Been wanting one of those muffins. Good job on a not sweet muffin recipe. This is a keeper.

Like many others have said, a good basic muffin recipe.  I made it by the recipe.  Muffins are sweet, but not overly so, the topping adds the needed extra sweetness to make these a sweet treat.  Without the topping they would probably work with savory additions such as cheese and bacon.  This made 12 muffins, not big with large tops, but muffins that rose to fill the cups to the top, but not over them.

First let me say, I don't write recipe reviews. Second, let me say that I enjoy this recipe so much that I felt I should review it! This the ONLY French Toast Breakfast Muffin recipe I use now!! I've tried so many other recipes like this one and for one reason or another, they just weren't quite right. These however, have NEVER failed me! NEVER! Everyone who has ever tried these - breakfast, lunch, brunch, linner/dunch (ha, ha, dinner + lunch), dinner, dessert - has loved them! I've played with the spices, adding cinnamon, allspice, cloves, vanilla and/or vanilla bean - individually or in combination - with much success! The only thing that I don't do is make the topping. Its just not my family's thing. A few side notes: 1) The batter is quite thick, so don't be alarmed and don't be tempted to add extra liquid - that will make them far less plump.  2) When mixing, I like to whip mine as it adds an airiness to them. 3) Do NOT over mix them! They will be dense, tough, and it just ruins the "magic" that are these little cakes of heavenly goodness!! Honestly, for me, this is the "end all - be all" of French Toast Muffin recipes! Enjoy!!

So easy to make. And incredibly delicious!  I usually have to make a double batch or they disappear to quickly. One thing I do after dipping in melted butter is put several mini muffins into a paper lunch bag with cinnamon sugar mix. Less mess.

We liked these. I followed the muffin recipe with one exception. I didn't have any milk so I used what I had, unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  I think I will use the sweetened vanilla almond milk next time so that there is maybe a slight sweet taste to the muffin. I halved the cinnamon/sugar that was called for & used some brown sugar in place of a portion of the white sugar. I used the whole amount of butter, rolling the entire muffin in it before dipping in the cinnamon/sugar.  I will make these again & try adding some other ingredients (i.e. Blueberries, lemon, nuts). Thank you for the recipe.

I made these muffins and my husband 
and I really liked them.  I did make some changes--half brown and white sugar, more cinnamon, no nutmeg, and no topping (own preference).  They just didn't last very long!

I, as well as my family loved these! Every day we have off school and every weekend they're asking for them! I did make one change, I didn't use nutmeg one time but another I did it everyone, including myself liked it without. That's our preference but overall these are delicious!!

Baked these in a mini muffin tin for 14 minutes and the only the I did differently was add a splash of vanilla because...well...vanilla. Oh and I dunked the whole mini muffin in butter and then the cinnamon sugar mixture rather than just the tops. They were delightful! The kids and hubby LOVED them! Perfect for a weekend breakfast.

I switched out sour cream for the milk. Super delicious and moist. I used pumpkin pie seasoning in addition to the other spices. I made in mini muffin tins. My husband (he is picky) loved these too!!!

Just made these.  They are really good!  I used about a teaspoon of nutmeg and about a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I also threw in a little splash of vanilla.
Like other reviewers I used a pastry brush for the butter and just sprinkled on the cinnamon sugar.  Will definitely make these again!  Thank you!!

These little muffins are amazing! They are good for quick breakfasts (if already made) or for a nice sit down breakfast with the family. These muffins don't have a crumbly texture but instead a nice cake texture.

Heated the milk, egg at room temp, and added a half a cup of hot water to batch and they came out super light and fluffy. Good with cinnamon and sugar or jam.

Didn't care for them much - the lumps in the batter remained even after baking, and the consistency was too dry and dense for our taste.

Pretty good! My first bite was a bit dry, but it served it's purpose-being lactose intolerant I was skeptical of putting so much butter on the muffins so maybe that's why it might have been a little dry? Next time I'll add raisins!

Delicious! Fantastic for a breakfast on the run. 

I like a lot of nutmeg and cinnamon so I added some more on my second go round but that's just personal preference. Highly recommend!

These must be incredible when made as written.  I didn't have enough milk for the recipe so squeezed an orange into the milk and egg, and they are fantastic.  Not too sweet (add jam if you need it sweeter) with a great texture and a really nice flavor.  They have an almost biscuit texture, but we really liked them and I will make them again, probably with changes in flavors of fruit and nuts.

I made these for a Superbowl party and they turned out well. I skipped dipping them in the cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture and just added the cinnamon to the batter instead- if I made them again I would probably try that part. I think I also added a bit more milk because the batter seemed a little dry. Overall, not the most fantastic muffin I've ever had but no complaints.

I made these exactly how the recipe states and the were ok-just OK. They are dense and pretty bland so they definitely need the butter and sugar topping. I couldnt  taste any of the nutmeg which is disappointing because I love nutmeg so next time I'll add more and maybe use oil instead of butter inside since they were a little dry.

Love the simplicity of these cake-like muffins. So easy to prepare. Cooked them 26 minutes in silicon cups (makes 6). Cook them 13 minutes in mini cups (makes 12)  Perfect. Really roll them in the cinnamon and sugar, rather than sprinkle. Perfect with a cup of tea, brunch, or freeze for surprise visitors.  Made them again with a touch of lemon extract, and then again with a touch of orange extract.  All delicious.

I added a little cinnamon to the batter, cause I like lots of cinnamon. It was a nice light texture, and pretty yummy.  Everyone enjoyed them. I thought it could use a tiny bit more flavor in the batter, particularly if you don't cut them open & add butter when eating them (I ate mind as it was, my niece & mom both cut then open & buttered them).  So I may play with that a little more. But I'll make them again for sure.

I made a couple of small changes to this wonderful recipe. If you don't want them cakey but fluffy!! Warm (not hot) the milk and wisk it with the butter until melted  in a separate bowl wisk the egg with two tbsp of vanilla extract and temper the egg with the milk, the effect of the warm milk with the baking powder will make them fluffy

Made this exactly as per recipe and it came out perfectly ! I added a slice of cheese on top of the muffins ( cold cheese, not melted)  so that they were sweet/savoury and holy moley it raised these little babies to the next level. DELISH!

I made these yesterday and while the flavor was pleasant,  it was nothing to rave about. I'm glad I used liners and didn't grease a lot of muffin tins because I would have been cleaning the ones that I ended up not using.

I tried this recipe "as is."   I used a larger muffin tin so I made 7 instead of 12.  They were light and very good.  You do need the topping because they aren't very sweet.   I will bake them again, and take one reviewer's change...add 1 cup of blueberries, omitting the nutmeg.  We enjoyed them!

I followed the recipe exactly as it says. These tasted more like biscuits rather than muffins. The batter was sticky and I think the amount of the ingredients (except for the butter, cinnamon, sugar) needs to be increased than what the recipe states. I barely made a dozen out of these and didn't have quite enough to fill each muffin tin. So some of the muffins did not rise to full capacity. They tasted good, but didn't have much flavor except the nutmeg/cinnamon/sugar. I had a lot of leftover cinnamon sugar and butter and ended up throwing them out.

I had breakfast muffins as a kid, mom would make them on Sunday mornings, rolling them in butter, sugar and cinnamon. 
I was hoping this would be that recipe, it is not, but it is still good, not great. I followed the recipe to the T and thought the recipe lacked moisture, the dough looks more like sugar cookie dough. After baking them, rolling them in butter, cinnamon and sugar I felt something was missing. The muffin did rise but is dense. 
So I made the recipe again, I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, changed the milk to 3/4 cup, added 2 tsp vanilla, changed salt to 1/4 tsp and added 1 more egg. The result was a muffin with less texture but more flavor. The original muffins had more texture but less flavor. I will continue to tweak the recipe until I am happy with the result. Thanks for bringing back good memories.

I thought they were quick and easy to make.  When it says may be a bit lumpy, I wasn't expecting almost a bread dough consistency, but it worked.  I only got 8 muffins out of the recipe.  Definitely a do again!

I thought these were good and will make again, the kids loved them.  They are pretty good when fresh, although a dense almost pound cake texture. But they didn't keep well till the next day. I mean they were edible just not yummy. I did brush the butter on the top instead of dipping them so that may have been the moisture difference. All & all a good recipe

I followed the recipe to a "t" when I made these and we weren't terribly impressed.  They were dense and didn't have a lot of flavor.  However, I heated one up later in the microwave and they were fabulous.  Reminded us of a cake donut. I think I will make them ahead next time.  They heat very nicely and were so much better reheated then straight out of the oven.  I think it gave the cinnamon sugar topping time to "set."  If you do make them and want to eat them fresh out of the oven, I recommend that you at least let them cool slightly.

I made pretty much as the recipe is written with one exception.  Instead of waiting for the muffins to come out of the oven to top them, I just sprinkled the cinnamon sugar right on the uncooked muffin tops and then baked. They came out with a nice crunchy cinnamon crust, and I cut out quite a bit of butter and a lot of mess and fuss. Really nice, sweet, delicately spiced muffin. Note: those who are finding these too dense are probably over mixing them. The liquid ingredients should be stirred in with a spoon until the flour is all moistened, no longer.  Never use an electric mixer.

Not at all what the photo shows. Followed recipe exactly and if I make again will only make half dozen. Didn't fill cups even halfway and batter was thick. Didn't rise to full height of cups. No real flavor other than the cinnamon sugar. Had to drizzle butter over tops and sprinkle on the sugar. They are edible but I would only give 2 star for this recipe. Also have boatload of cinnamon sugar left.

Love these! Quick and easy and the kiddos love them. I just sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top before I baked them to avoid adding more butter to the top, they were still so good. Definitely adding these to the breakfast rotation :-)

I am an avid baker and was looming forward to these. A bit bland for my liking. It's more like a biscuit/scone than a muffin. Although very easy, probably won't make again.

When it came to the actual muffin, I followed the recipe...no changes. As far as the topping, I split it up...half of the cinnamon sugar topping from this recipe and a glaze (from this site). I thought the muffins were light, not dense (pound cake like) at all. Definitely will be making this again. You can definitely play (add-ons) with this recipe.

These were edible, but lacked any real flavor.  The only flavor came from the cinnamon sugar coating.  I served them with butter, which made them a bit better, but I was a bit disappointed in the outcome.  Followed the recipe exactly. Probably won't make again.

Not enough liquid. Made a dough not a batter.  Added about half a cup of milk more and it worked out fine. Good flavor not too sweet.

Wonderful. My family loved these and I will definitely make them again. My daughter said they remind her of eggnog.

I filled the tins half full and it only made 9 muffins the dough is very thick like cookie dough. Someone mentioned pouring and they must have added quite a bit more milk because I had to use two spoons to scrape the batter into the tins. Changes I made were using oil instead of butter in the mix and sprinkling the cinnamon sugar over the tops before baking. The picture is very misleading, they don't rise up smooth and tall. They are short lumpy and have a texture like scones. They taste good for a scone anyway.

Tres bon!  A nice light textured little muffin.  (Perhaps our portion controls should follow the French) I'll definitely make these again.   No need to change a thing.  (the photo is not yet updating though, was probably quicker to make the muffins than post the photo, sorry)

These were okay, more like a treat than a breakfast... My kids enjoyed them but then needed to eat something more. Another note- they are very small muffins, I doubled the recipe and it only made 16 "normal" sized muffins.

These were absolutely delicious.  I was worried because the batter was very thick, but after triple checking to make sure I hadn't done something wrong, I decided just to go with it, and they came out perfect - extremely moist, and just sweet enough to satisfy.  I wasn't expecting this to become a go to recipe, but these were a big surprise!

I made these muffins this weekend for company. I wanted to make something a little sweet to accompany sausage & eggs & fruit, but didn't feel like pancakes or French toast.  These were super easy to whip up...no mixer to clean, and they bake quickly.  They were a great addition to the savory breakfast items & fruit...rich texture & lightly sweet.  They're small muffins, but that was great for us, as we feel so many carb foods are far too big and unhealthy. Also, the petite size made them seem extra- special. I didn't change a thing, and I'm glad because they were simple and sweet and perfect.

These were okay. Nothing really special.  They stuck to the paper though so if I make them again,I will definitely not use the cups and just spray the pan.

I made them almost exactly as written with the one change being that I brushed the muffins with butter after baking instead of dipping. Then I sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. They were very good but next time, I will use some vanilla extract as a couple reviewers suggested.

These are simple and delicious.

Love, love, love them.  Found the recipe while surfing my recipes.com this morning and popped out of bed and made them for the family before I even considered getting ready for church.  A keeper.  Family loved them.  They seem more like a light pound cake once completely cooled if you can keep them around that long.  I plan to make them next time with chunks of peaches and add a little vanilla, but keep the cinnamon/sugar topping.  YUMMY!  Highly recommend.

A definite keeper. Very eatable!!!! Followed recipe as directed, but there are so many things you'll be able to add to suit your wants, ie; apples, pecans etc. .
Need to double recipe to make 12 regular size muffins though. 
VERY DELISH!!!!

My family has loved these for years.  I've simplified them by sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar on top before baking.  Makes a nice crusty top and easier work/school days whe we want something special but quick.

I really like these muffins but I find them to be very thick. I think I will cut down on flour cause after they sit its hard to get down without a glass of milk. I love how light these are at the same time!!

Super easy and everything on hand-I subbed in Zylo Sweet for my sugar and almond milk instead of cow's milk (because that is what I had). I added about a tablespoon of golden flaxseed then had to add a little more milk and butter before spooning into the pan.
The batch made 2 dozen mini-muffins and it was perfect! Baked about 15 minutes. The muffins came out a nice light golden color. Adding the melted butter and cinnamon sugar when the muffins were warm was perfect!
Thanks for the recipe-we will definitely be using it more!!

This recipe is SO GOOOOD. I read other reviews and decided to use half a cup less flour and added a little more milk. They turned out PERFECT! With the nutmeg in them, this recipe reminds me of fall and cozy weather. LOVE that. Everyone in my family asked for seconds. I will definitely be making these again and again. (:

Tasted like pound cake.  They were good, a little bland, but people liked them.  Made as directed and were very simple.  maybe in future I'll add some extract or something.

Tried it, loved it.  My five-year-old basically made them, that's how easy they are to make.  They are on the sweeter side with more of a  pound cake like consistency so next time I plan to add fruit  =)  But as with other reviews, I think these muffins can be added to and be the base for many yummy combinations.  I like the size that came out too.  Not too big, not too small.  Just right for little, hungry mouths.

These are the best and easiest muffins to make. The only thing I added was a tsp of vanilla, left everything else exactly the same and they came out perfectly. My children absolutely loved them. They went very well with my morning cup of tea.

This was a very good muffin.  I made mini muffins for my grandson.  They were very easy to make and not too sweet.  Almost a pound cake or doughnut (munchkin) texture.  I found that 1 tablespoon of melted butter was just enough for the mini muffin toppings.  A light dip is all you need.  No need to soak the tops before adding the cinnamon/sugar.  There was leftover cinnamon/sugar which I saved for later use.  Chocolate chips would be a nice addition in these muffins.

Doubled the sugar because my husband loves thing very sweet. Had to bake 5 minutes longer, but these were divine. Also used sour cream in place of milk and add cranberries I had in the freezer.

I made this one morning while my parents and siblings were asleep. The kitched is next to my parents bedroom, and they didn't wake up! It was very easy and didn't require a mixer. The turnout was heavenly...I will definitely be making these again!

I followed the recipe exact except I had no nutmeg so I subbed mace and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Tasted good, not fancy but still yummy.  But the recipe made maybe 9 or 10 muffins, not 12 and the consistency was more of a fluffy tea biscuit.  I did not over-mix ingredients, if anything maybe under mixed them.  Will try out again & see.  I think a grate or 2 of lemon rind would be very nice.

The recipe is super easy to make and takes so little time. It's a little thick and tastes a little too much like butter. I ended up using a sugar glaze instead of butter so I could dip the muffins into the sugar. I added more cinnamon, too, to give it more flavor.

I find it amazing that I am seemingly the only person who ended up with a batter that needed a lot more liquid. When I combined the liquids into the dry mix, I ended up with something that was more the consistency of cookie dough than muffin batter. I had to double the milk just to get the proper consistency. Even more surprising, the muffins turned out! Fresh out of the oven, I used a butter knife and just spread the butter on them one at a time and sprinkled them with sugar (brown, because I loooove the rich taste of brown sugar), and sprinkled on the cinnamon right from it's jar. Delicious!

I tried these without any changes & they came out terribly dry. I knew then I was mixing them that I should add more milk, but I was giving the original recipe the benefit of the doubt. The taste was good, but next time i'll go with my gut.

These came out great with a moist texture. They are very filling. I doubled the recipe and inadvertently added an extra egg (an extra large farm egg that had a double yolk). They rose up very nicely and had a great appearance. Since I use the large size muffin papers instead of the tiny cupcake size, a double batch only made 10 muffins.

This was my first time making muffins from scratch and I was amazed at how easy this was! They were light, fluffy, and delicious! I followed another reviewer's recommendation of brushing on the butter and sprinkling the sugar on top and it was super easy. Will definitely make this again soon!

This is actually my first ever review, but I had to comment on these.  I was in a bind for a quick school breakfast for my 4 children and made these "on the fly".  They were so fast and easy and they turned out great.  They were very light and remind me of Madelines.  The hint of nutmeg was perfect.  I allowed each child to determine the amount of cinnamon and sugar as an accompaniment.  I filled the muffin cups 3/4 full and only got 9 muffins.  I will double the recipe next time.  Thanks Kelly, Yum.

i added twice the nutmeg called for, and used a bit less butter. also, i sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar at the end, rather than dipping the muffins in it.  the muffins were a little more cupcake-ish than i expected, and a little bland (the flavor reminded me of snickerdoodles). but not bad at all. i wasn't in the mood to labor over cooking this morning, so i loved how quick and simple the recipe was

Simple and delish. Good for a morning treat. I made these one time and snuck in some goodness by soaking some bran cereal  in the milk before adding. Still turned out delish and didn't make you feel as guilty for indulging.
I also reduced the butter in the muffins to just a pat melted and added a spoon of applesauce. I don't melt butter to dip when finished I just touch the hot tops with a stick of butter and use a small spoon to sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top.

I made the recipe as posted, except that I did brush the butter on the tops of the muffins.  I only got 9 muffins, though I probably could've stretched it to 10.  These have a nice mild flavor that would pair well with various jams.

Different, but SO good!!!  I doubled the recipe and used 1/3 c butter and a 1/3 c unsweetened applesauce just to lower the fat/calorie count, which worked very well.  Also used leftover butter from the cube to melt and apply for the topping - using a pastry brush.  Didn't even use it all, but the cinnamon sugar mixture stayed on just fine.  These were done in 20 minutes and made 15 large muffins.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks Kelly!

This is a very easy recipe and very good.  My kids loved them.  I tried to make them a little healthier.  Substituted equal amount of oil for the butter.  Substituted 1 cup of all purpose flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup rolled oats and 1/4 cup wheat germ for the 1 1/2 cups flour in the recipe.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger.  There are som many possibilities and no way you can screw up the texture of this muffin.  Have fun experimenting.  I think next time I will let the kids make the muffins...it is that easy.

Great breakfast muffin. I subbed egg whites and light margarine for the whole eggs and butter. I only got 11 delicious muffins from the recipe.

I loves these muffins! I made them for my family, but ate them all before they got home. But i have to admitt i cant figure out the muffin size cups to bake them in. Either normal or the small muffin pan, but i have bake these with both and they still turn out wonderful.

I wish these muffins weren't quite so dense - I'm going to try to figure out how to fluff them up a little. However, they are delicious, and it's easy to add ingredients to them to for a little variety. The most popular were the originals, but I made some with raisins and dried apricots that were also quite good.

I LOVE this recipe! I made it for my family early one morning, and everyone was fighting for the last two muffins. My brother BEGS me to make these muffins for a special breakfast treat. They taste so good that they should be considered dessert. Not only do they taste delicious, but they made the kitchen smell EXTRAORDINARY! My family loves waking up in the morning to the smell of these delectible muffins.

I remember having these as a kid at a friend's house. They make VERY small muffins, I think next time I'll either use mini muffin tins or double the recipe. The topping really made these muffins. Next time I think I'll put a tinge on cinnamon in the muffins themselves. I made them without paper wrappers, I just used PAM in the tin before dropping the batter in and it was a good choice. I think I'll make these over and over again!

great recipe! the muffins are perfectly tender and light. however, this recipe makes way too much cinnamon topping. i only used about 1/8 cup sugar . dont go overboard with the nutmeg! since this muffin has no other strong flavorings, too much nutmeg can ruin the taste. this is a great recipe and i will definitely make it over and over again.

This is really good but I think it makes only 6 muffins, not a dozen decent-sized muffins. Forcing the recipe to come out with a dozen muffins will yield very small muffins. I would also use half of the topping ingredients only and use a pastry brush to coat the muffin tops with butter.

Yummy!  These were so light and fluffy!  I had to make one change because we were out of milk.  I used 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt thinned with some water in place of the milk.  They were perfect.

When I first made this recipe and sampled one of the muffins I wasn't so sure of the flavors.  But, after letting them sit for a day the flavors really came together and tasted so good!  I can't wait to make these again!

This is a very easy to make Muffin.  It is not a WOW recipe but if you are in a pinch you will probably have everything you need on hand. The muffin itself is a little dry. The topping was of course the best part.  I used most of a stick of butter for the muffin mix and what was left of the stick, I melted and used to brush heavily on top.  I had just enough to coat all of them.  In a regular muffin pan, this recipe made 10 good size muffins.  It would be very easy to play with this one to get it to your personal taste perfection.

Instead of the full amount of butter and cinnamon/sugar mixture to dip them in, I used 2 tablespoons of butter and sugar and brushed the butter on top, then sprinkled the cinn/sugar. These muffins are delicious! Light flavor that mellows after awhile, nice texture, and sneakily addictive. :-) I didn't get quite a dozen, but that's what experimentation is all about.
Thanks!

These were very good (and easy)!  I filled each muffin cup about 2/3 full and then added a dollop of homemade strawberry jam, then topped with the remaining batter.  Yummy!  One comment - you don't need 1/3 cup melted butter for dipping the muffin tops after they're baked - you could easily get by with 2-3 Tbsp or so.

I added a little extra cinnamon and sugar to the mix and after the muffins were done, I brushed the top with butter and dipped them into the cinnamon sugar mixture.  They are light and fluffy and and a nice sweet breakfast treat.

The batter was just like a cake.  I let the muffins cool about 5 min before dipping into the melted butter and sugar. Had my son and his girlfriend over for breakfast, he took the rest home to his dorm.  I'll keep this recipe. Thanks.

I made this recipe exactly as specified. (Since the recipe wasn't specific on these points, the egg I used was an extra-large one, and the flour was unbleached.) I baked the muffins for 21 minutes. The muffins turned out kind of smallish, and they were a little dense, but they were tasty - The Woman I Love liked them too. I liked the dip-in-butter and dip-in-cinnamon-sugar steps - I'd never done that before, and the topping was very good. One note: I thought I was pretty generous in using the butter and the cinnamon sugar mixture, and still had some of each left over. I'd suggest that the butter be reduced by maybe a third, and the cinnamon sugar mixture by a quarter. These weren't fancy, and were a little plain, but all in all, these were pretty nice little muffins.

A little dull except for the muffin tops.  My children, infact, just ate the muffin tops.  The batter was a little dry.  I agree with other reviewers in that I could only make about 8 muffins, not 12 with this recipe.

I made six muffins with this recipe (a dozen is way too much), brushed them with butter and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.
They tasted great. Not too bland on their own, and an excellent base for a more sophisticated muffin.

Very yummy, and best served while still warm. Tastes very, very similar to another one I've had...but they deleted the review I had that named the cook book. Combining melted butter with cold ingredients (milk and egg) makes the butter harden again, but this did not seem to affect the outcome.

I would have to agree with some of the previous reviewers that the Muffins were slightly bland and were not very large. But over all, they seemed to be acceptable in my home. I enjoyed them and they were fairly fast and easy to make.

These are wonderful!  I didn't have nutmeg so I used cinammin to replace it.  Turned out perfect and my kids loved them!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will use again and again.

I don't know what it was but these just weren't very good. It may have been because I used soy milk and whole wheat flour, but they were too heavy for me. I'm definetly looking at more muffin recipes.

These are perfect... not too sweet, super simple! I made them in a mini-muffin tin and baked them for 10 minutes. I brushed the butter on with a pastry brush and sprinked the cinnamon-sugar mixture over them (easy, easy!). These should be called Snickerdoodle Muffins :o)

This recipe is a really nice base for experimentation. I added sliced strawberries and a streusel topping, and they were great! I did notice that they were a tiny bit on the dry side, though.

3.5 stars.  Good, nothing special.  Basically tastes like standard muffin batter.  Husband liked them though.

These muffins were excellent!! Everybody loved them. I did add a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and agree that the butter for the topping was way too much. Overall an excellent muffin to have with your morning coffee!

While this recipe has excellent texture in terms of what a muffin should be, the taste leaves something to be desired.  The lack of intense and/or subtle flavors whatsoever seems to leave an opening for jams and jellies, something I feel that muffins should not need on their own.

After making these, I thought to myself: "I know I've made these before!!!" I later realized that I recognized the taste because they are very similar to "sugar and spice muffins," also found on this site.  Yes, they are good but almost like a cake or doughnut flavor/texture. If I made these again, I might try adding a peeled/shredded apple to the batter (which might go nicely with the nutmeg in the batter and the cinnamon/sugar topping).  Thanks Kelly.

Nice muffins for a change of pace, but batter very thick and muffins turned out very heavy.  Not a favourite in our house, but not too bad either.
