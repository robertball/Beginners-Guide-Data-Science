This is tasty, but wickedly rich and sweet, as well.  For my taste, I will probably replace some of the half-and-half a bit with the milk, as well as reducing the sugar a little.  There is a bit of an aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on.  The coconut extract is a quite nice addition to this drink and sets it apart from other hot chocolates.

As it is this isn't my favorite hot chocolate recipe. I like it better with these changes: 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp coconut extract, 1/4 tsp salt, and a tablespoon or two less sugar than is called for. I didn't add whipped cream. If I had, I might have used slightly more cocoa powder.

I didn't happen to have the coconut extract, but this is a fantastic hot chocolate recipe! It's easy and comes out very rich and creamy. I've made it several times with different ratios of milk, half and half, and heavy cream, and it's a hit every time.
