This goes way above and beyond 5 stars.  I have made this recipe twice; once with Hershey brand syrup and the other time with a generic chocolate, trust me you don't want to use a generic chocolate syrup in this recipe or you will be let down.  If you want the full Chocolate affect of this flavor, must use Hershey Syrup..enjoy your brownies people!!!

These are really, really good.  I have to admit that I made a mistake.  I added the evaported milk to the brownie batter and it was still delicious!  They are super easy and taste almost like fudge the next day.  My whole family loved them; thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent, moist, one guest walked off with the remaining brownies on the tray! Still have not had my tray returned!  :)  I think she liked them.

I have an almost identical version of this recipe in an old book and decided to try it when I was craving brownies but didn't have chocolate chips or baking chocolate on hand for melting.  Since one reviewer said it lacked a strong chocolate flavor and I also thought there would be wayyyy too much sugar in this recipe (a cup of sugar PLUS all the HFCS in the syrup?!) I made the following adjustments:  I used 1 1/2 cups of syrup (as opposed to 2 cups which would be 16oz) and I added 1/2 cocoa powder.  The result tasted like brownies from a boxed mix, which honestly I am not particularly fond of but it wasn't too bad for a last-minute brownie emergency.  I would say avoid the frosting on these if you want to actually taste your brownies.  Anything made from melted chocolate like the frosting will have a stronger chocolate taste than the brownie itself and then you end up using the brownie as a tasteless spoon for the chocolate.  I much preferred to eat the brownie without the frosting.

Oh Myyyyyyyyyy, talk about a rich, fudgy, chewy treat!!! This is IT! I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13 x 9 for 40 minutes in my hot oven. This came out like a fudge cake. I had all ingredients at room temp prior to mixing. This is to die for!  Ok, my changes were: I did not use walnuts and I used a total of 1/2 cup regular milk, 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of marshmallows for the frosting. This was out of this world! I will make according to recipe next time and not double, but still place in a 9 x 13. If you have ever been lucky enough to eat at Joseph's Storehouse and Bakery in San Antonio, TX, this is their recipe almost exact for their brownies.

I gave this a 4 instead of a 3 only because the frosting was so good.  The brownies are on the dry side and cakelike in texture, and very thin, I suppose due to the larger pan the recipe calls for.  I guess I like the fudgy type of brownie better.

We didn't have any cocoa powder and really wanted to make brownies.  These were just about as easy as using a mix and every bit as good!

These were very cry and thin.  IF I make these again I will grease he pan and use a smaller pan like 13x9 and cut back on the amount of frosting.

These brownies were dry, spongy and tough. Not very chocolatey. Very disapointing.

These are really a 10 star brownie!  Thin, light, moist and chocolatey! For the viewers who thought they were dry,  start checking the brownies after about 15 min with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the brownies are done.  In my oven they are done in about 22 min.  Everyone's oven temp is different. When trying out a new recipe I always test for doneness about 15 min. earlier than the recipe calls for.  I have been making these brownies for years. My mother made these brownies for years as I was growing up. I have her hand written recipe which is the very same as this one and as I read the reviews and saw some saying these were dry I had to post mine review as well. I made two sheet cakes of brownies this past weekend for an open house. The last few were today were just as moist as they were on Saturday.

Okay, but not what I was looking for.  This tasted more like a chocolate cake.

OMG! These are absolutely delicious! I was hankering for some brownies late one night, had syrup lying around and decided to bake these. Yummy!! They were gone within 24 hours (I ate most of them!).

I had a large container of chocolate syrup leftover from another event---enough to make three batches of this recipe.  The recipe is worth keeping for that reason.  I, too made the recipe in a 13 x 9 inch pan.  I did receive compliments on the brownie, though I have other recipes that I prefer more.

Way too sticky, not 'brownie-ish' enough.  Just more like sticky cake.

The brownies turned out okay, but I prefer a more fudgey texture and deeper chocolate flavor.  They were easy to prepare and we really like the frosting.  Nice for something a bit different.

where's the leavening? not enough flour.  This made a unpalatable sticky dough, thoroughly inedible.  Amazing that some can say this is good??!!?

This was more like a cake than a brownie.  This has too many eggs and not enough flour.  Tastes like one of those spongy 5 minute mug cakes. I didn't make the icing, but I don't believe it would have helped much.

wanted a recipe that was fudgy without baking chocolate squares, not quite what I was looking for the brownie its self was very cakey however the frosting more than made up for it. I used a 9 by 13 glass baking dish and they weren't too thin. when the brownies were outliving their welcome I chopped them up finely and threw them into the chocolate syrup ice cream recipe here on the site and omg amazing
