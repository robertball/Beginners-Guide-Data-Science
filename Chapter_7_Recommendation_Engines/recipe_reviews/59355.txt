Very nice.. must try .. but regarding the quantity of the sugar ... please try the mango before adding the sugar .. 1 cup might be too sweet ...

Fabulous!  I made this for my husband and a guest, and it knocked their socks off.  I would recommend a little salt to balance the sweet, otherwise the recipe is perfect as is.  Keep the serving size small, as this is rich.  I also cut the corner off the freezer bag, and squeezed the sorbet into a dish rather than scooping, and made for a nice presentation.

I changed this a bit. Used 3 mangos, only 1/4 cup of sugar, omitted the ice and added some vanilla. I used my ice-cream maker and it turned out very tasty & creamy. I will use this base to try making other fruit ice-creams.

This was so good and extremely easy to make.  It tastes like the mango sorbet I get from my favorite Japanese restaurant.  It had a great creamy consistency; not icey at all.  I imagine you can make this with any fruit so long as you have about a cup and a half of it.  Before serving, I run the bag under warm water for about 30 seconds and move the contents around a bit more then scoop out with an icecream scooper.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really excellent. I added a pinch of salt, used only 3/4 c sugar, and 1 tsp lime juice for a bit more zing. Fabulous!

I love mangos and this recipe looked quick and easy.  However, I have tried this recipe twice and both times it took more then 45 minutes to freeze to the proper consistency.  The great thing about this recipe is that it doesn't matter what type of mangos you use.  I prefer the Manila mangos since they are less stringy.

I made mine with what I had on hand:  1 1/2 cups frozen mango chunks, 1/2 cup of honey, a mixture of fat-free half and half and evaporated milk, and water.  Three hours later, it was only partially frozen, but it tasted great!  If you get impatient, it would make a lovely smoothie (like a mango lassi). I served it with a little nutmeg on top.

Yum, I made this with Frozen Peaches (All I had) and it came out wonderful. I used about 2.5 Cups of Peaches and 1/2 Cup Sugar, it was plenty sweet!

This was delicious, but I had 3 mangos on hand and feel it could have used another. So, 2 would not have been enough. Plus, it takes a lot longer to freeze than the recipe states. But definitely worth it!!

This is the best sorbet I've ever eaten. I make it at least 3 times a month. I get fresh mangos from our tree, cleam them and freeze for use during the winter months. I also add a teaspoon of vanilla and use one whole can of evaporated milk in place of the cream.

This is not a sorbet, it is an ice cream with very few ingerdients. Made it without the cream but I recommend less sugar as it was overly sweet.

This was a good ice cream but it becomes somewhat icy once you've stored it in the freezer.  I'd recommend eating this as a soft serve, but that's just my preference.  I'm more partial to custard type ice creams.  I did make this in my ice cream maker too, and it took maybe 15 minutes.  Quick and easy recipe.

this is excellent recipe. although my freezer stopped working when i put sorbet in it, and it didn't turn to ice but still it worked out great as a refreshing and cool dessert. and i changed it a little bit ie i gave a layer of strawberry sorbet on top of the mango sorbet....and both flavors were awesome together....

This is amazing! I've never made ice cream before so I was a little nervous about trying this recipe. I was afraid it would come out icy but it wasn't - it was very creamy and delicious! I am giving it 4 stars in place of 5 because it needed 1 tsp vanilla extract since otherwise the cream flavour was too strong. Overall this is a wonderful recipe!

Never pay $5 again for the fancy packaged sorbet - try this fresh and refreshing recipe. Easy to make and ready within the hour.

I layered this with vanilla ice cream using a gingersnap crust. A perfect summer treat.

Very good flavor. I don't have an ice cream maker, so I followed the directions as stated.  It took much longer--nearly the whole day--for the cream to solidify, and it was a bit icy, but it tasted good nonetheless.

I only had one fresh mango so I used a can of sliced mangoes. I mixed it up in the afternoon; using the liquid from the canned mango instead of ice & only using about a third of a cup of sugar (the mango liquid is kind of sweet on it's own). Then put it in the fridge to chill &  ran it through my ice cream maker for 30 minutes when we were ready for dessert. I thought it was a little too creamy for a sorbet & next time will use half & half or 2% organic milk. Great flavor ...it was just a 
little rich & that's not necessarily a good thing in a sorbet. ;o)  Thansk for a recipe we will use over & over again CHANGOFETT!

I think this is a good recipe, and I like the technique (however it did take longer than 45 minutes to freeze up), BUT, I think one cup of sugar is waaaay too much! I used 1/4 c for three mangoes, then added the normal amounts of other stuff. I did use half and half instead of cream. I was snacking on some of the mango when I was cutting it up for the blender, and it was so good that I think I was a little disappointed by how the flavor was diluted by the cream and ice. I've realized that I prefer straight fruit sorbets (with no cream). Thanks for the idea, though!

Love this. Really easy. I added a splash of lemon juice and that makes it better. Also, used strawberries instead of mango and my kisd like it better than store bought ice cream.

In my world, recipes are usually only guidlines, born out of availability and taste preferences.  This was fabulous.  I only had 1 mango and no cream.  I used my unflavored yogurt and 1/3 C. sugar and only 4 ice cubes.  I like a little cardomon with mangos and had just a few pecans,(not enough to use in anything else)so I chopped and added them as well.  Tasted great when it when into the freezer.  Can't wait till dessert!

Creamy, deliciously different. I added an additional 1/2  cup of cream and ran the blender for several minutes. A wonderful way to end an Asian-themed meal.

I made this exactly as stated. - The mango added little bits to the texture and was not smooth at all. The mixture was very liquidy and took a day to solidify. When I took it out - it was too solid to serve so i placed it back into my blender and needed to add some more liquid - so I added a bit of orange juice to get the sorbet moving around the blender. I let it blend a while to smooth out the texture, but the mango bits remained. This was OK but I won't make this again. I prefer the "5 minute ice cream" from this site which is so versatile.

This was the PERFECT light dessert after a heavy steak and potatoes dinner my boyfriend and I made for his parents. Like others have said, it did take a LOT longer than the recipe specified to freeze--even after nearly six hours, it was still quite soft-serve--but provided you plan ahead of time for this, it'll turn out great. We served it in fluted dessert dishes with two of those little Pirouette cookies stuck in each bowl--tasty and elegant! I bet it would be good with many other fruits, too.

Delightful. I couldn't quite get the consistancy but I had alot of people coming in an trying to get a taste of it before it was done, that is probably why.

Its in the freezer right now. Even if it doesnt freeze right, it would be a good topping for ice cream or pancakes or something.

Wow...this is a very sweet and rich dessert. The only problem I had was that it took about 2 hours to freeze.

Original ingredients (used heavy cream as this recipe was not specific) but cut sugar in half.  Didn't time how long it took to freeze... a day later it's solidly frozen like an ice cream/sorbet should be. Tastes good!

We loved it and will make it again! I didn't have cream, so I used a can of evaporated milk. I'm sure it's not that much different than cream! It was mango-y and sweet. We did not find it too sweet, but you could put less sugar since it is pretty sweet. We also felt it was creamy like ice cream, but I would still put it in the sorbet family. I ended up freezing it overnight, and it was fine. I did mush/crush it in the bag a few times.

This is literally in my ice cream maker as we speak. I've taken a few spoonfuls and its very good. I halved the sugar as suggested on here and it's a good thing because it is very sweet! I had to sub the heavy cream for evaporated milk and I believe it may have changed the flavor slightly but it's still good and it does freeze!

I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 and upped the amount of mangoes to 4 then added some cinnamon.
