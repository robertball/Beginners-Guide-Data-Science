These milk shakes were awesome!  They are rich and creamy.  It seems to be a recipe that could be easily modified to use any flavor of pudding and/or ice cream.  I will definately make these again! Yummy.

Not so great.  This recipe is almost identical to just making the pudding using the directions on the box.  The ice cream doesn't change the texture of the "shake" so it's just like drinking pudding from a straw.  If you really like pudding, I guess this recipe is for you.

good flavor, but has too much milk. Start with the ice cream and then add milk and pudding to taste. That'll make it thicker.
