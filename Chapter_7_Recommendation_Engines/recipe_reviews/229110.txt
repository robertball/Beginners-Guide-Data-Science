This was a nice base recipe. I did make some changes, according to what I had on hand. I used pork, so I used a teaspoon of chicken bouillon granules instead of a cube of beef bouillon. Also to save myself a pot to clean, I cooked the meat first, in the sauce, with the oil and water chestnuts with liquid, added. Added the stir fry veggies once the meat was mostly cooked through, and cooked until heated through. I thought it could use some extra flavor so I added curry powder, ginger, cinnamon, and garlic powder, to taste, and a teeny amount of crushed red pepper. Served over drained ramen noodles that were flavored with a packet of chicken seasoning. Garnished with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. This made a great, cheap meal. Next time I'll be sure and add a can of mushrooms, and it would taste good with sesame oil, if you have any. I was out and used canola. It would be good over rice, as well.

Tried this recipe this weekend and it turned out well. The only advice I have is to check to see if your vegetable medley has water chestnuts in it. The one I bought already had it so additional water chestnuts were unnecessary. I also served it over white rice. Other than that, it was amazing!

My husband, father-in-law, and I love this recipe! To save time on the meat, I buy "stew meat" so that it's already chopped up, and half those pieces to make them a tiny bit smaller. My family also prefers peppers over other veggies in a stir fry, so I buy one fresh green bell pepper, one fresh red bell pepper, one fresh yellow bell pepper, one fresh orange bell pepper, and one onion, all sliced. Those all together account for about three servings, so I freeze the other two for later. I cook the veggies in olive oil the same, but add the meat that's been sitting in sauce right in-- no wasted pans and it turns out great each time. One change I made to the sauce was to shake a generous amount of crushed red pepper into it. It gives it a tiny kick. Overall, I'm glad I found this recipe and will continue to make it!

I doubled the bouillon cubes and the meat. I did cook the meat first and added frozen veggies. There were no leftovers. It was great!! I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Family like this....used a very lean and thin cut of steak called chip steak (normally used for cheese steaks) and 2 bags of frozen stir-fry veggies. I did omit the water chestnuts as my family doesnt care for them. Easy and tasty. I also added some sesame oil to the stir-fry cooking process for more flavor. Thanks

Really good! I cheated and bought pre chopped fresh peppers-all colors, mushrooms, onions, broccoli, asparagus and a can of water chestnuts. I also added garlic powder since I didn’t have fresh garlic. I added a beef bouillon cube to the rice. Served with jalapeño pepper corn bread.

I used broccoli and peppers instead of stir fry mix and instead of white rice, I used Knor's Pasta Sides chicken fried rice. It was an instant family favorite! Side note - everything but the rice can also be cooked in a crock pot if you're busy. It's still flavorful and nicely textured. When you get home, just make the rice and eat!

First off, thank you for sharing your recipe. This was delicious and easy, easy, easy to make. I used a frozen broccoli stir fry blend and tossed in some pea pods near the end (wanted to keep them crunchy). Since the blend had water chestnuts I didn't add extra. I used Thai style rice noodles that I added at the end. If you use thin rice noodles be sure break them up when adding to the pot so they mix nicely and don't clump together.

I did change it a bit. I used 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce and 4 tablespoons of soy sauce. I wanted it a little sweeter. Turned out great. My husband went back for seconds. We paired it with ramen noodles instead of rice. I think next time I will let the meat marinade in it for a few hours before cooking it.

1st time:  I used filet mignon. So tender! Delicious!
2nd time:  I substituted shrimp for the beef.  Also added fresh squash and zucchini. Used chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon cube. Cooked shrimp about 2 minutes or until pink. 
Served over fried rice.  Awesome!

This was good, not very spicy but flavorful. Instead of frozen veggies, I used a yellow onion, a medium zucchini, a poblanos pepper and a red pepper - all julienned.  I did add the water chestnuts, too.  I doubled the marinade.

I used chicken cause I didn't have beef. Used asparagus, mushrooms, colorful peppers, garlic and watercress. Used the ingredients for the savory sauce minus the bouillon cube. It was so good and not heavy like a meat and potato main dish.

Very easy recipe for a busy work week. I had to double the recipe for my family.  I did use 2 bags of the stir fry vegetables (chestnuts included). And followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Served it over rice. Perfect!  This was a BIG hit for my boys.

I did not make any changes.  Used all ingredients of the recipe.  It just doesn't taste very good.  Not horrible, but I would never serve it to anyone or make it again.  Husband and I both were very disappointed (our cat, however, liked the meat).  I think maybe part of the problem is that you don't use fresh veggies.  Frozen ones just don't taste the same.

Hubby loved this one.  Would perhaps double the sauce as he really loves a substantial amount of gravy.

Great recipe! I leave out the water chestnuts because my family aren't big fans, and they are often in the stir fry veggies mixes anyway. I usually double the veggies and sometimes double the sauce too, so there's extra sauce to mix into the rice as well. We also sometimes do chicken instead of beef, and if I use beef I don't always actually marinate the nest - sometimes I just brown the meat and add the sauce at the end and it still tastes wonderful. We make this all the time - it's the only stir fry recipe we use!

So good. A hit all around. 

I did end up with a vegetable mix that had water chestnuts, I added the can anyway because we love them. Also added a small can of bamboo shoots. I used beef chuck cut into tiny peices, because that's what I had. We served over white rice.

It made a ton of sauce, which I reserved some on the side, and cooked in a separate pan. We approve of extra sauce!

If your going to make this, use a pan twice the size that you think you'll need! It's so good; you'll be glad you did!  It also keeps well, and might even be better the next day.

Will make frequently in the future. A keeper.

I found it to bland. I didn’t have teriyaki sauce however so maybe that was a huge difference.

I made just the way it states in he directions, although I did add more soy sauce and teriyaki sauce once it was simmering. My husband and I loved it, great recipe, although next I make it  I think I will let it marinate over night. Thanks for the great recipe.

The sauce thickened more than I expected - probably because I used fresh veggies - onion, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots & mushrooms.  So missing the liquid of the frozen & the chestnuts, I'll add more water next time. But the flavor was great and it went together quickly.

A good recipe. We didn't have low sodium soy sauce so I used regular. It was way too salty. I would definitely try it again with the low sodium soy sauce the recipe called for.

This was a great recipe!! I tweeked it a little though. I added beef Ramen noodle season packs instead of beef bullion. I also added garlic, red pepper flakes, red pepper, green pepper strips and even squash. I didnt have any teryiaki sauce so I used worchestshire sauce and a little more sugar. It came out superb!! My family loved it!! I'll be making this again for sure. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This was quick and easy and best of all we all liked it!!  I doubled up on the water and used a broth base. This ended up making a LOT of sauce so if you do that I would stir fry the beef and pour the marinade in at the end. It turned out just fine but was not stir fry with all that sauce simmering with the meat. I used sugar snap peas, it's what we like. Will for sure make again. I can see all sorts of veggie possibilities.

A good basic recipe which is easily adaptable to the ingredients at hand.  The use of frozen vegetables (a bag labelled soup mix) worked much better than expected.  A bit of added garlic and/or ginger would be a good addition.

This was very good. My picky household ate all their vegetables tonight. I added garlic to the sauce. I used gluten free soy sauce. I omitted the teriyaki sauce because I didn't have any. But this was still delicious and gluten free!!

Made this because I needed to make a stir fry Monday, and quick! I omitted the water chestnuts because my your Celiac brother won't eat them. He usually hates stir fry but he actually liked this one! 

Only thing I'd like to mention is that I needed way more water than what the recipe called for because the cornstarch in the beef marinade became clumpy paste rather than a sauce when I went to cook the beef.

I was lacking some of the ingredients, so I replaced the beef bouillon with chicken bouillon, nixed the teriyaki sauce and added a bit of molasses to the sauce. It turned out great and I will make again! The beef was very flavorful, but I'm curious to see how it would taste if I left it in the marinade during the day. Deeelicious :)

Was a good recipe. I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour instead since it's only for thickening the sauce. I also added ginger.

Delicious. I didn't have water chestnuts so I didn't add those and I used teriyaki seasoning instead of sauce. I also did not add the sugar as we don't like it sweet. I also just used the vegetables I had on hand. I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Sauce super thick, had to water down a ton to get edible consistency. Decent base brown sauce

This was great!  I've been looking for a nice, basic stir fry sauce for beef and this is it.  Perfect mix of sweet and salty.

Overall a good recipe! Nice and quick and easy to put together. I didn't want to wash a bunch of pans so I cooked the meet in the juice first along w the canned chestnuts. I added garlic seasoning and fresh ginger that I had on hand. I also kept the water chestnut juice from the can made for a nice sauce. I added the frozen veggies once the meat was basically cooked through and simmered for about 10 mins on low. Meat was tender n flavorful and the veggies nice n crisp! Along w stir fried rice (:

Even my picky husband liked it!  I did use fresh veggies and as I didn't have bouillon on hand I used part of a beef au jus seasoning packet.  I served it over brown rice.  I will definitely be making this again!

We make this all the time but use only fresh veggies.  Most of the time we use venison since my husband is a hunter and we always have it on hand.
