I'm not sure I enjoyed the nutmeg in this drink. Otherwise it was flavorful and had a creamy texture. Thanks Marianne.

I thought this was a great drink high on protein. It's not the average fruit smoothie but for healthy quality it's quite good. Thanks for sharing will use again:)

I thought that this was a great recipe. I eliminated the egg and replaced the wheat germ with flaxseed meal due to having a wheat allergy. All in all it's a nice quick smoothie to throw together quickly in the morning.

I really liked this. I almost didn't put the nutmeg in but it added a nice flavor.

I used 1 frozen banana 1 cup almond milk pasteurized egg whites instead of a raw egg and the wheat germ honey vanilla and nutmeg. It made a thin smoothie so I added some ice. I might make it again.

too much of an after taste from the nutmeg.

THE BEST banana smoothie I've ever had! I eliminated the wheat germ (because i didn't have any) and it turned out fine. You have to try this if you love bananas.

I have experimented with many of the smoothie recipes featured in this site and this is by far the best. Just a few minor tweaks (FROZEN banana VANILLA ALMOND milk and PASTEURIZED LIQUID egg)have made this The Perfect Breakfast Smoothie simple to assemble not too sweet and stick to your ribs until lunchtime. Kudos to you marianne!

Really nice flavor good consistency. Very light compared to other smoothies. Definitely a nice quick breakfast drink. I made with frozen banana plain almond milk and hemp hearts instead of wheat germ. Others are substituting processed egg whites for the raw egg. I kept the raw egg because I prefer the least processed ingredients. Regarding the raw egg - I would advise using organic (preferably Certified Humane) eggs since they are not typically associated with Staph species or other types of food-borne illness. Such bugs are associated with antibiotic dosed chickens typical of cheap commercial eggs.

This is the best banana smoothie I have tasted! I substituted wheat germ for protien powder and substituted the nutmeg for cinammon. With the added protien powder this is a great tasting healthy smoothie.

I sometimes add 1 tsp. lecithin to this smoothie and leave out the wheat germ. I've been making this smoothie for years!

My youngest child is an extremely picky eater and will often turn up his nose at protein items he has eaten in the past. That said I made him this smoothie (cut in half since he's still small) with pasteurized egg whites. I left out the wheat germ and nutmeg. He LOVED it. Hooray!
