This recipe is amongst the worst I have ever tasted. I  ordinarily love acorn squash, but this was the pits. Too tart and was a poor combination with the ginger and nutmeg. Try one of the many other offerings available here instead - please!

The spices overpowered the squash taste.  Perhaps smaller quantities would give it a better taste.

Have been using ginger with squash for a long time but only freshly grated ginger, plus the orange juice, some orange rind and brown sugar to taste.    I think you will find this a little more zippy.

This turned out great!  I really liked the ginger nutmeg OJ combination flavor.  The squash I had wasn't very meaty so that was a disappointment, but the flavor was good.  Thanks for sharing.

In fairness, I used fresh ginger, not dried.  The dried probably would have been zippier.  

A little extra orange juice and nutmeg helped the final version.

Not a bad version overall if you want a change from the overly sweet brown sugar covered acorn squash.

Used OJ from concentrate, and it turned out very tasty. Could have used a little something extra, but the flavor of the squash was not overpowered at all.

I normally just load up my acorn squash with brown sugar and butter, so this was a nice change.  I saw several recipes using orange juice concentrate and I think that might give this recipe a little more orange taste than just straight juice.  I filled the middle about halfway with the oj and added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I sprinkled ginger and cinnamon over the top.  A good alternative recipe.

Wonderful! The flavors are subtle, and complement each other well. I added 1 tsp of  onion powder to the orange juice and spices.  No leftovers! This is a light dish compared to sweet recipes for acorn squash.
