I have never been a fan of bleu cheese dressing,  NEVER! as in, I have been completely grossed out by the concept, the smell, the flavor, everything. After making this, consider me converted. I made this for a holiday family wing-stravaganza, mostly thanks, too, to Chef John's recipes & videos. Seriously, I couldn't be happier... great with wings, the celery & carrot-dipping, great with a wedge salad (with bacon, Chef John! can't forget the bacon!) In this recipe, the freezing and grating of the cheese is key. Thank you, Chef John! You've made my food world bigger and better.

This is an awesome, awesome, awesome blue cheese dressing. I used Duke's olive oil mayo, light sour cream, and fat free buttermilk to reduce the calories, but I used regular blue cheese because low fat blue cheese is just WRONG in so many ways! I also splashed in around 1 tsp. of white wine vinegar in it because I always add that to my blue cheese dressing. With these changes I got the calories down to around 135 calories per 1/4 cup serving size. I did not miss any of the fat I cut out! Thank you Chef John for this great recipe.

My husband stomped his feet and said why why do you have to mess with perfection ... I love your blue cheese dressing and I said because I like to try new recipes.  It will be fine.  He loved it.  He said it is quite good and asked for another salad the next night.  I can't wait to try it as written because I didn't have buttermilk.  I made my own with milk and vinegar.  I didn't have a block of blue cheese to grate.  I had previously crumbled that I added in.  It is really good with my substitutions ... can't wait to try it with the real stuff.

Chef John, I have tried a few of your recipes and they never fail to please.  This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly except I was in a hurry and did not freeze the cheese.  The dressing will be able to sit 6 hours before I serve it tonight with chipotle popcorn chicken.  I can definitely see the advantage to freezing the cheese and will do so next time.  I like all of the proportions of ingredients that you used they are all in harmony.  Thank you for another great recipe!

This dressing/dip is incredible! I made the full recipe w/o the buttermilk then separated the mixed ingredients into separate bowls. That way I could add the right amount of buttermilk to make a dip and a dressing to their proper consistencies. I served the dressing over wedge salads and served the dip with my own version of buffalo wings on NFL conference championship Sunday in January 2014. I also taught my guests Chef John's trick on how to eat a flat wing piece. It was the perfect football meal and everyone enjoyed it.

This was the one I've been looking for...just the right balance of flavors. I made it as a dip for buffalo cauliflower "wings" but it is fantastic on salads too.

Loved this! Didn't have buttermilk so just used our 1% milk. I loved grating the blue cheese in a little at a time & grating a garlic clove into it. This is a keeper!!!!!

I've been making blue cheese dressing for over 35 years using a recipe I developed. I decided to try this recipe and am truly impressed. This will be my go to blue cheese dressing from now on...
I really like the freezing of the blue cheese and grating it into the dressing.

The family loved this dressing when it was served with "Cherry Bomb Chicken". My husband loved the lack of heaviness that is found in many blue cheese dressings. It's a winner. I did use dried buttermilk reconstituted.

Excellent recipe! Could use a tad more salt for my taste. But the creaminess and flavor is exactly what I'm looking for in a high quality Bleu Cheese Dressing. Thanks, Chef John!

I made this exactly as described. Grated the frozen blue cheese and it was wonderful. Letting the flavors meld overnight makes a huge difference! I used Costco's Kirkland creamy american blue cheese.

I'm big on blue cheese dressing and don't particularly like the store bought kind (there is one brand that's decent) and I have yet to master the home made variety so I did a search and found this one (I will admit that the fact that he had "Chef" in his name kind of made him a bit more credible to me). Any way, I was surprised by some of the ingredients, mainly the buttermilk and the Worcestershire sauce. The recipe called for frozen blue cheese and although I didn't have any I still shredded what I had and it seemed to work fine (since I love blue cheese I used the entire cube which was 7 oz. and cut some chunks up and put it in there for a more chunkier taste). 

I let it sit for the 3 hours and took a taste and it is rather tasty. One thing I will do the next time I make it is cut back on the buttermilk amount. I realize that this is a salad dressing however it's a little bit *too* watery for my liking.  

I will definitely make this again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good blue cheese recipe.

I've made this many times and it's delicious! One caution, be sure to use REAL mayonnaise. I made it with mayo w/canola oil and it turned out very thin.

I am my family's sole salad maker and made this salad dressing for my dad on Father's Day and Pop's noted this was the best blue cheese salad dressing I've ever made. The rest of the family was raving about it as well and noted it was literally life altering, in a good way.

I grated in more blue cheese and use low fat Greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream. 

Thank you chef John for another fabulous recipe. I'm always very pleasesd with all of your recipes.

Very good dressing.  Creamier than the recipe I have used for years.  After chilling and tasting the recipe as-is, I added to this recipe about 1 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice which made it perfect for me. The lemon seems to pull all the flavors together - gives it the little twang that you get when biting into dressing that has large chunks of bleu cheese. Bleu cheese lovers know what I'm talking about.   The grating of the cheese is a great option when serving this to a large group such as pot luck style.  The cheese is more evenly distributed.  You can make this as chunky as you want to.  This recipe makes quite a bit.

You never go wrong with Chef John's recipes! I love blue cheese dressing but it doesn't exist in Australia ready made. But I can find all of the ingredients easily enough and make my own. 

It also lasts a surprisingly long time without going bad.

Do not use light sour cream or light mayonnaise or light buttermilk.  Next day was a milky substance...almost blue cheese vinaigrette.  Lesson learned!  Still tasted good!

This is the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had and I won't even buy it in the store anymore. I'm getting ready to make another batch right now. But the crazy thing is because I only needed a small amount I halved the recipe and then by the time I got to the spices I forgot to cut them in half!  It ended up absolutely delicious so now that's how I make it from now on.

This dressing was really good. I also added some poppy seeds, which made it even better. I think next time I will decrease the mayo or add a little more sour cream. It was a bit too much mayo taste for me. All in all, it’s a keeper!

I have one recipe that I have used for years but couldn't find it tonight. This one had the highest ratings so I decided what the heck! Granted I do have a brand-new bottle of dressing in my fridge at the moment I had all the ingredients but the buttermilk so I subbed with 2% milk and didn't have the dry mustard so I used dijon. Let me just say that this is absolutely fabulous!!! I loved the grating the cheese tip, it made a world of difference and you get that tangy blue cheese zip with every bite! Thank you for my new fav recipe, I look forward to making this for several occasions and Buffalo wings of course!

Holy cow, Chef!  I scanned this recipe just to see how it differed from my own.   It is like the recipe I use with the exception of the sugar and no cayenne. (I add buttermilk according to the consistency I need -- dip, dressing, etc., so that might be a different ratio)  Being the curious sort, I got my dressing and added some sugar.  I can not believe the difference it made.  It was subtle but outstanding.  Thank you !!

I haven't been able to buy store bought Blue Cheese Dressing since I first made this recipe. It is the best Blue Cheese I've ever had. I use the shredded and lots of chunks of Blue Cheese in this recipe. It's perfect!

it was really good. I did use creme fraich (fresh) (homemade) cause I always have some in the refrigerator and I like the taste. Freezing the cheese was a great idea I had not thought of before." Old dog New tricks" thanks

This is excellent. I especially appreciate using a micro-planer on frozen blue cheese to make a truly flavorful dressing.

Chef John gives us another winner! So flavorful and
easy to make I don't know why anyone would buy bottled. I was looking for a way to use some leftover blue cheese. I served this over a wedge of lettuce and topped it with crumbled bacon then garnished on the side with some fresh tomato's from the garden.
Thank you Chef John.

I just made this recipe to the t and it's amazing! I am extremely picky about blue cheese dressing since I have eaten at so many 5 star restaurants with the creamiest, chunkiest most flavorful taste. Thank you so much for sharing the secret in the frozen grated wedge, LOVE IT!!!!

Found mine a bit mild, so maybe the blue cheese I used. But still good. And I had accidentally doubled the other seasonings!

I have made this dozens of times. Exactly as written. Delicious and so worth it. Freezing the cheese and grating it makes this so good! I even had a co-worker who is lactose intolerant eat it because he loved it so much. He said his stomach issues later are well worth it!

This is now my new favorite salad dressing.
Grating the blue cheese makes it so much easier to have a smooth dressing with no chunks. 
Excellent on a romaine wedge.

I halved the recipe because I only wanted enough dressing for lunches for 5 days, and the amount was perfect.  I used full fat ingredients and the dressing stayed thick and creamy until the last drop was gone.  If you use reduced or non-fat ingredients to lighten it up, it will turn watery after a day or so.  Please don’t!  It’s bleu cheese dressing-indulge yourself a little!  Oh, and a good quality bleu cheese is a must otherwise you will have to use a lot more to get that nice strong flavor.  Excellent recipe!

This is my fourth or fifth time making it.  I follow as instructed but I can find buttermilk, therefore I add 2 tablespoon of dry buttermilk powder.  NEVER buy another store bought dressing EVER.  DELISH!  Thx Chef...

This was good but a little bland. I will say letting it sit overnight did help. Made as written, may make some tweaks and use as the base recipe next time.

Wow!  I’ve been looking for a recipe that tastes like a dressing from a restaurant in our area that closed.  Theirs was a creamy garlic with crumbled blue cheese on top.  This recipe gives that flavor.  Strong raw garlic with creamy blue cheese.  Excellent!  I did have to substitute the buttermilk with milk and lemon juice since I didn’t have any on hand .  Still very good.  Thanks Chef John!

I made this recipe as written and for me it was a waste of ingredients, especially expensive blue cheese.  I wish I had taken the time to read all of the reviews. First of all, I would have cut the recipe in half and left out the buttermilk.  I made it one day and when I went to use it the next day it was like soup.  Good thing I wasn't planning on using it for company. Did this happen to anyone else?

I've made blue cheese dressing and dips many times but this is by far the best.  Grating the blue cheese is genius.  I made this a thicker dip by omitting the buttermilk.  Just perfect!

gonna have to give it three stars , I do like blue cheese  but don't love it, althought the boyfriend does, he said whew thats strong. We used it to dip superbowl hot wings in, got a 50 /50 response on it, I believe it needed more salt or garlic , just wasn't great .

This is delicious. I used my immersion blender to mix in carafe that came with the blender. So fast and easy. I reserved some cheese back to add chunks, because I prefer that. Will certainly make again.

I followed  this recipe exactly and it was superb! I used Point Reyes bleu cheese. Delicious on a wedge salad with some of the remaining bleu cheese cumbled on top. Yummy.

This is the only recipe I make for blue cheese dressing, never changing anything- although i do sometimes get stuck without buttermilk and have to sub my own (3/4 cup milk + 3/4 tbsp lemon, stir, set for 10 minutes), which works out OK in this recipe. Grating the frozen cheese tastes better than crumbling, and is so easy.

If you like Blue Cheese Dressing, you will enjoy this recipe.  Dressing was creamy with nice bits of blue cheese throughout, and taste was not overbearing.  Will make again for sure!

I made this yesterday for dinner tonight, but it completely lost it's thickness and became soup overnight. What a waste of ingredients. Needless to say, I can't comment on the flavor.

I absolutely love this dressing! I'm usually not a fan of blue cheese but I tried this anyway and it is by far the best dressing I have ever tasted I would eat it on anything.

I have made this blue cheese dressing 3 times now and I love it!  I made it exactly to the recipe twice and the third time I used garlic powder in place of the crushed garlic which tasted just fine.  I love the idea of grating the cheese so that it infuses the flavor instead of a bunch of big chunks.  I have never liked bottled dressing that you buy at the grocery store they always have a vinegar taste or a strong "off" flavor.  I also don't really want to use a dressing that has a laundry list of ingredients such as chemicals, stabilizers and such.  This is so easy to make, try it and you'll never buy Maries blue cheese dressing again!  Thanks Chef John.

I used milk and white wine vinegar as I did not have buttermilk. The grated bleu cheese dissolved into the base. I wanted some chunks so I added some gorgonzola crumbles I had on hand. I also added a splash of pinot grigio.  It's in the fridge for the flavors to blend and I can't wait to try it in a few hours.

I loved this recipe. I already had crumbled blue cheese on hand so I added it rather than going out for a chunk of  blue cheese to grate.

This is the 2nd time I tried making blue cheese dressing.  The first time, the dressing was great.  But the next day, it was the consistency of water!  I saw this recipe, and Chef John has never let me down.  I made it this afternoon. Taste (and consistency) OUTSTANDING right after I made it!  About 3 hours later when I was ready to serve with chicken wings, it was the consistency of water!  AGAIN! What am I doing wrong?OK been google'ing.  I used light mayo, light sour cream, and low-fat buttermilk.  I think this is my problem.  Guess I need to only make the amount that I'm going to eat in the next hour. The dressing was to-die-for when I tasted it right after making.  Guess that just tells you why we don't need to eat this. But it is FANTASTIC!!!

This was very good. I didn't have all the ingredients, but I wanted something blue -cheesey for vegetable dip. this was great. Substituted yogurt for the buttermilk as I didn't have any. I don't really like vinegar/milk substitute very much.  I also added some garlic as was suggested by another reviewer. This came out great and hubby really liked it best for salad dressing. Thanks John and all you reviewers who had some good suggestions.

Oh...My...Gosh...if I could give this 10 stars I would. This is one of the best Blue Cheese dressings I've ever tasted, and far exceeds bottled of ANY kind. The key is to let the flavors mesh 2-3 days in the fridge as it tastes entirely different from when it's first made. It's creamy, smooth, and full of blue cheese flavor and will be a hit for true Blue Cheese lovers. Definitely will make this one again and again!

Absolutely perfect! I buy crumbled bleu cheese, then blend with all ingredients, and it is my jam.

I made it exactly as written, as I always do with most recipes, especially Chef John's because he is usually spot-on for my taste (and I'm a picky foodie??).
I usually only have light mayo in the house but I went w/ full fat as he suggested. It probably would be fine with light since he said yogurt lovers would be OK with that substitution, but I don't feel I can honestly review if I don't try as written first.

This dressing is amazing, and that was tasting after made. I can't wait to see how it melds overnight! We will have that wedge salad John recommends either tonight or tomorrow. 

I made Chef John's Honey Siracha wings and served them with celery and this dressing during football. Hubby LOVED all and gobbled them up. He is a bleu cheese dressing lover and couldn't say enough about this one. It was so easy and so worth the extra time from just opening a bottle. I may even make as Christmas gifts for my friends. Thank you, Chef John!

I am so glad that I found this recipe.  My husband has developed an allergy to garlic.  Almost all blue cheese dressings from the bottle have garlic in it.  I have been trying different recipes for blue cheese dressing and luckily found this one.  This is by far the best.  I just substitute grated onion for the garlic in this recipe.  Thanks, Chef John!!!

I prefer chunks of blue cheese in my dressing, but the flavor of this dressing was delicious! I simply use chunks along with shavings, and it's spectacular! Thanks for sharing!
