This is an easy and delicious twist on strawberry shortcake in elegant form. The orange peel, which we used, gives a subtle burst of summery "creamsicle" alongside the berries, but could be omitted. Also, for the sake of simplicity we layered everything in a trifle bowl. Parfaits are nicer if you have them. This would be lovely garnished with a bit of reserved whipped cream and a mint sprig or sprinkle of orange zest!

Fantastic! A delicious, pretty, and simple way to impress guests. I will be keeping this recipe and passing it along. I made the Coconut Macaroons III recipe instead of buying...amazing macaroons. They are way tastier and easier than going to the store!

I add a dash of balsamic vinegar to the straberries, it adds a subtle but much enhancing taste and helps to draw out the flavors.

This was a hit but two of my kids didn't like the coconut so next time I'm going to add either ginger snaps, oreo cookie or even chocolate chips. White chocolate and/or chopped nuts would work great, too.

Simple, light and tasty!  Can't beat that combination!  These were a big hit at my house over the weekend!  I felt like the coconut macaroons were excellent in this.  Thanks for the recipe!
