It is strange but pretty good. This is not a gourmet meal but it is hearty and filling. I too used lasagna noodles w/ meat sauce instead of spaghetti, added some minced garlic while sauting the onions, no pepper, and only about 3/4 of the bread crumbs (next time I'll use only 1/2c). I wouldn't make this very often but would make again when in a time crunch. Thanks!

I never thought I'd try a recipe with the word "strange" in it, which this combination certainly seems, but it was VERY tasty!  My store was out of spaghetti with meat sauce so I used lasagna with meat sauce instead.  I think I'll stick with that because that shape of pasta is easier to eat anyway.  Leftovers are yummy too!

This was pretty good, though not something I'll make very often.  That amount of pepper made this dish very spicy, so next time I'll probably only put in a 1/2 tablespoon in (instead of 2).  The kids didn't like this one very much, but that was probably due to the black pepper and green bell pepper.

This is a great recipe!  My kids and family loved it!  I substituted shredded cheese on the top for the bread crumbs and it made the dish very cheesy and creamy from the soup!  It was great!  I also cut down on the pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids!

My two year old loved it and he's quite the foody so if he's happy I'm happy. I altered it a bit by sauteing the garlic, onion and pepper first then adding the ground turkey (rather than vice versa). Also added salt, parsley and a little basil to the mix before adding the soup and sauce. I also opted out of the canned spaghetti/sauce and simply cooked spaghetti and sauce separately and then added them to turkey mixture along with some parmesan and mozzarella cheese. It's definitely not a dinner party dish but works for a family meal.

"Strange but true" is right on the mark with this unique twist on a casserole.  My family enjoyed it.  I plan on taking the leftovers and adding it to a pie crust, bake, and make a nice brunch pie.  I would make this recipe again.

Had lots of leftover spaghetti with sauce that I needed to recreate. Family was happy to have it in a different form, but overall not the most exciting dinner.

This isn't anything I would make again. I only made it due to having the ingredients.

I made this recipe last night. The only thing that I changed was that I added some provolone cheese to the top and used leftover spaghetti instead of canned. It was a good way to use up leftover spaghetti but pretty much tasted like doctored up pasta and not very different from dinner the previous night.

I made this for friends that visited for the weekend. I made some substitutions. I used 1.5 cloves of chopped garlic instead of minced, and used bow tie noodles (1.5-2.5 cups) and some spaghetti sauce (26 ounces) that I had in the cupboard instead. I also used stove top stuffing crumbs because it is also something easier to have on hand or buy individual serving for.

I did not care for this recipe. Followed it exactly and it was dry and too spicy. Will NOT be making this again.

This this recipe was just OK.  I can say this much I won't be making it again.  I think it's just a perception of taste.

I thought this was pretty spicy, even though I cut the pepper back by more than half. My 21 month loved it, he had seconds! As for my daughter & husband they each took one bite & asked me not to fix it anymore. I thought it wasn't bad, I may make it again, when my husbands' out of town!
