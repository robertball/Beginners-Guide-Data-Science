This DELICIOUS simple dish makes an excellent, hearty fall meal: healthy too! I substituted curry powder in place of curry leaves, and a bit of onion powder for asafoetida powder. Sesame oil may work better for sauteeing the spinach at high enough heat to remove excess water, as peanut oil will smoke a bit. Some may want to increase salt. Wonderful dish. Thanks SUSMITA!

Oh How disapointing  I recently returned from Southern India  whhere I had Aloo Palak many times, so when I found this recipe I was looking forward to a delicious dinner. No taste at all just tastes like boiled spinach with potatoes  I've seen now  (sure now) several other recipes for aloo palak  that  sound so much  better which have   things like onions and garlic and ginger

This dish is delicious, althought it was very hot for my taste. Fresh curry leaves aren`t available in my area, so I used dry and doubled them. Maybe it was the reason this dish was so hot. Next time I`ll definitely reduce curry leaves and maybe chile peppers. Thank so much for this recipe.

I love this and make it all the time! I leave out the curry leaves because they are difficult to get where I live. I substitute chickpeas for the potatoes sometimes. So delicious...making it for vegetarian friends tonight.

This was pretty good, but I agree with another reviewer that it could use some ginger and/or onions. I did add a little garam masala toward the end of cooking, but it still seemed to be just "missing something." Basically a good recipe that could use a little tweaking.
