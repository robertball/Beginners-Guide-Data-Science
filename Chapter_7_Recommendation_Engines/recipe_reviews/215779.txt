I made something very similar to this but added a bit of brown sugar and used less vinegar. I aso used a piece of real bacon instead of imitation bacon, cooking it in the pan before cooking the onions and garlic.

 It's a nice change from the typical 3 bean salad or baked beans recipe

This was very flavorful and full of different textures. I had to make one change. I was out of red wine vinegar so I used white balsamic vinegar. By choice, I used 2 slices of fresh bacon. (instead of imitation bacon bits) I cooked chopped up bacon in the first step and drained most of the fat. I then cooked the onion and garlic in the remaining tablespoon of bacon fat. The sauce was a bit too sharp for our taste so I added 1 teaspoon of sugar. This was a very nice dish that I will make again. I would be inclined to use all beet greens in the future just for their flavor and texture. Thanks so much for sharing a very good recipe truckersmom!

This was a good idea, but using 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar may be a better idea.  The vinegar taste overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. My husband overcooked to try and reduce down the vinegar, and that made it mushy...so, we put it in the food processor and it made a great bean dip!

SORRY BUT THIS WAS NOT FOR ME. I THINK THIS WOULD BE GOOD WITH REAL BACON BUT THE IMITATION BITS WERE SO SALTY, AND I ONLY USED 1/3 CUP. THEY TASTED VERY ODD WITH THE VINEGAR.

I used fresh bacon and tri-color beans.  Such a lovely comfort food.

This was just o.k. - I was starving and needed to use the beet greens (along with the beets), but in fairness I am vegan so used coconut "bacon" which probably made a big difference.  I think a little sugar as suggested by other reviewers might help also. Thanks for sharing as beet recipes are rather scarce and its very good for us.
