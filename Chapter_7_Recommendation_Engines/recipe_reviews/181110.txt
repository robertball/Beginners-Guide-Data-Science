This was the BOMB!!!!  Great recipe.  I cheated and saw the Jell-O Oreo Cookies & Cream pudding and used that instead of the vanilla pudding, but I know it would be spectacular with vanilla - and plan to try it again soon!  I'm thinking BIG with this recipe - adding cherries, using butterscotch pudding or chocolate pudding, or coconut creme - oh, the possibilities are ENDLESS!!!!

This was very tasty! I did have to make some revisions due to this being a spur of the moment find and what I had on hand...I used a prepared graham cracker crust, 3 squares of the Baker's Chocolate instead of 2 (just because), and I only had 1 box of vanilla pudding, so I halved the pudding portion, which actually ended up being the perfect amount for the pie. I chose to thickly slice my bananas instead of the quarters and topped it with mini chocolate chips and finely crushed peanuts. This made a wonderful, light and refreshing dessert, but I did feel that it could've been a little sweeter, but that could have been because of the changes I made. I think this would also be equally as good with banana pudding instead of the vanilla. Hubby said he would request this again, and it was so simple, that I wouldn't mind making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Pie was very wonderful! I was afraid that I would not be able to taste peanut butter because it call for so little, but the peanut butter taste was very noticable and good. The combinations were awsome together, going to make it again when we have company over!

This pie is just as delicious as it looks!  I loved the taste of peanut butter as well.  I needed a chocolate pie so I just used instant chocolate pudding instead.  I didn't have baker's chocolate so I used a couple tablespoons of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I will definitely make this again, even my banana hater loved it!

This dessert was a hit for my husband and mother in law's combined birthdays! Everyone kept commenting how delicious it was. I followed the recipe except using sugar free banana pudding mix instead of vanilla to give it a more banana type flavor.

Very good pie - everyone loved it!  The peanut butter taste was dominant - if I make again, I would probably add more chocolate...the chocolate flavor was very faint.

didn't care for the choco-peanut butter part.  Didn't taste like a peanut butter cup.  Otherwise the rest was fine.

This was delicious!  Fast and easy to make.  It looked beautiful too.  The only change I made was an already made graham cracker crust because I was short on time.
