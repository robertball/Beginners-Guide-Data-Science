This recipe was suprisingly simple and
mouth-wateringly delicious, not to mention
tender! I have recommended it to all of my
friends.

Awesome recipe...made exactly as instructed. Have already made this twice, as I really like it and it is very healthy. I have another pack of turkey tenderloins in the freezer for my 3rd attempt. Made some brown rice and veggies and served with a raspberry chipotle sauce...mmm mmm good!

I, too, was a little skeptical of soy sauce and turkey. This came out surprisingly good! I didn't want to broil because I've experienced dry and burned food with that method. So I marinated the turkey for 1 1/2 hours and used the stovetop method. First, I browned the turkey on both sides in olive oil, then added close to a cup of chicken stock along with some garlic and onion powders and black pepper. I covered the pan and let it gently simmer for about 17 min, turned the meat over and cooked another 17 min or so, adding a little more chicken stock, and just made sure the thermometer read 165degF. It produced a nice but thin sauce that you would never guess had soy sauce as an ingredient. It was rich and savory and worked well over the meat and some homemade stuffing. The meat also came out moist. This was a great way to prepare turkey breast tenderloin that I'll certainly use again! Thanks Christine!

It was easy to make and the marinade was good, but it was a little too crispy in the broiler.  Next time, I would try baking it or even sauteeing instead.  Also, I would make more of the marinade to use as a gravy.

We grilled the tenderloins instead of broiling them and they were very good. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and we really enjoyed the taste that came from the marinade.

Made this as is, with the exception of marinating time.  We only let it sit for about 20 minutes in the marinade and it was still wonderful.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  The kids all had seconds.  Will be keeping this one in my recipe box for a long time!

Nothing particularly special about this recipe; just okay. Had my hubby grill the meat, which we prefer to broiling.

Great recipe. The soy sauce gave a different flavor for Turkey. It was delicious and flavorful, not to mention easy!

So simple and flavorful!! I doubled the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours. Then my husband grilled the tenderloins. 7 minutes on high for one side, then flipped and turned the heat down to medium (specifically "MOM" medium-off-medium with our three burners) for 7 minutes. The turkey turned out perfect. Super tender and delicious!!

Delicious way to prepare a small turkey tenderloin. I did use low sodium soy sauce in place of regular soy sauce. The meat marinated all day, as I mixed it up in the morning and we had it for dinner. Since it was a nice evening, we chose to grill it rather than broil. Wonderful flavor, and I would use it again. Served it with steamed broccoli and baked mac n' cheese.

This was very tasty. We grilled the tenderloins instead of using the broiler. They were moist and flavorful and it could easily pass for pork tenderloin!

This recipe was very easy and my husband loved it!  I used one cup of plain yellow mustard mixed with the soy sauce and rosemary.  I let the two turkey breasts/tenderloins marinate in a baggy in the fridge for 3 hours. Broiled it for 22 minutes..flipping 10 minutes in.  Really delicious and easy!
