Just thought I'd throw in my two cents worth on this one.  FYI for previous reviews: Chess Pie should have a "burnt" top.  It's the cornmeal that comes to the top and browns that gives this appearance.  
My great-grandmother's recipe calls for only 3 eggs and only 1 1/2 cups sugar.  My mother always removes her pies when a butter knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.  For those of you who have slightly runny centers, when you turn off the oven... leave the pie inside until the oven is cool. As far as I've ever been able to tell.. you can't dry out a Chess Pie.  And for those whose pies cracked on top, this is fairly common. Sometimes mine crack, sometimes not.  May have to do with humidity and that sort of stuff.
Finally, for those knocked out by the sweetness.. Chess Pie is a traditional down-home Southern Pie. If it ain't sweet, it ain't dessert.  I only wonder why T.Knecht put any topping on at all.  Never had it with topping... don't guess I ever will. Hope I helped.  God Bless!!!

This is an excellent recipe and very easy to make.  I am a little surprised at some of the negative comments.  This pie recipe is very typical and delicious for one of the custard-type pies.  Try using heavy whipping cream rather than evaporated milk, this will help with the texture and the cracking.  Also, PRE-HEAT your oven to 450 degrees, place pie plate on a cookie sheet, place in oven and immediately turn oven down to 350 degrees and bake 45-50 minutes.  The top will be a medium brown as the cornmeal surfaces and browns, and the pie should be set.  I had no problems with it and my family absolutely loves it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This pie is still in the oven as I write this, but after all the recipes Ive tried I have yet to come along one that resembled the pies my grandmother used to make.  One of the reasons I searched for so long was that I didnt realize the one very simple fact that set my family pies apart from the "recipe pies" - the commotion.  There was always so much going on in our house during the holidays that this pie was made, that the pie always fell.  Every Chess pie (we call it Vinegar Pie) Ive ever had in 22 years has been flat!  I would recommend stomping to anyone else who has this same tradition.  Also, leaving your pie in the oven while the oven cools is truly the best way to set the center, and the top is SUPPOSED to be brown and cracked.

This is a very good Chess pie recipe, but I did modify it to resemble the pies of my youth.  I have never heard of using evaporated milk, so I substituted buttermilk instead, and I also used 1 C white sugar, 1 C brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness.  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers to guarantee my pie filling set up nicely.  I heated the oven to 450 F and once I put the pie in, immediately lowered it to 350 F.  I ended up cooking mine for 50 minutes and left the pie in the oven the entire time it was cooling down.  Afterwards, I put it in the fridge for 15 minutes, and it turned out the perfect consistency.  Since this pie has to cook for so long, I would recommend putting tinfoil over the exposed crust, unless you like the edges browned.  My husband prefers browned crust, so I just brush mine with half-and-half before cooking and leave them uncovered.

My fiancee asked me to make a chess pie for his office potluck and not only did I not know how to make it, I never even heard of it!  I decided to look it up here and found this recipe, and I am glad I did!  It turned out great!  I made enough for 2 pies.  I did modify with buttermilk instead of evap. milk and half brown sugar/half white. The rest I followed exactly and it was delicious. I was scared it would be firm enough like some other users said, but I left it in the oven until it was cool and it had a great texture!  5 stars!!  Thanks.

I have made this pie recipe several years and the most important tip that I can give is to make sure that no mixer is used to make this pie. As the directions state, everything is stirred together. No whisking. only stirring. I do not put cornmeal in my pie. This is a good sugar pie. Years ago it was said that the name was Jess Pie....or Just Pie..there are a lot of old stories as far as the name goes. However, I have been eating Chess Pie for over 50 years and this is a good recipe. There is also another name...Transparent Pie...regardless of what it is called...baking until a knife comes out clean is the way I was taught to bake it. This pie cooked at the right time and temp that were recommended in the original directions and I used the ingredients that were called for, other than leaving out the cornmeal. I make this pie for Thanksgiving and Christmas and the forks are ready long before the pie is cool enough to eat. I always make 2 or 3 as I know how special this pie is for our family holidays. It makes no difference how many other desserts show up, these pies go out first...I do cover the edges with foil; as I don't like a burned crust or even too brown. It is an old Southern pie recipe and it was made when there were very few ingredients available to even make a pie. Just Pie.

I wish I knew what I did wrong with this pie.  I've tried it twice, and both times bombed by having a beautiful crust only to discover a chess "pond" below.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  Since that didn't work, I tried some of the previous cooks' suggestions and added cooking time and left the pie in the oven while it cooled down. Both results were the same. The flavor is exactly what I'm looking for, but I just can't get it to set.    I'm an old-fashioned southern girl from Tennessee who knows her chess pies and has worked in bakeries, so why is it that I can make a three-tiered wedding cake, but can't get this pie to set?! ha ha

this pie is great, but it really does crack a lot. i used 1/4 cup buttermilk in place of evaporated milk, and it did not crack, and still taste great.  it is the best chess pie ever.  i make it and sell it along with other pies i sell, but i don't let my customers know where i got the recipe (smile).

I found that when I followed the directions, the pie wasn't set in the center so I had to return it to the oven.  Might want to increase the bake time.  Would also suggest that you cover with foil so the top won't brown too much.

FABULOUS!  Make sure you have a deep dish crust...mine made too much filling for my crust, so I added a handful of coconut to it and made a second pie...both were fabulous.  This is for people with a real love of sugary sweet.

Since this was my recipe I would like to elaborate...so sorry some of you didn't have a successful baking experience. I will tell you ovens cook differently when it took much longer to cook I line the crust  with aluminum foil to keep crust from burning and check it at 10 minute intervals till knife comes out clean and it looks less jiggly.  To those of you who were successful and loved it my grandmother would be tickled. Thank you

This was extremely easy and quick to make.  My co-workers raved about it.  It came out a little runny in the middle - so my oven probably required a little extra cooking time.

This recipe has been passed down for generations on my Mom's side of her very Southern family. The trick to baking this pie completely through is a very simple one. After you bake the pie for 40 minutes at the recommended temperature you simply turn the oven off and leave the pie in the oven. Once the oven has cooled to room temp you remove the pie. This is how my family has baked the pie for as long as I can remember and we've never had a burned pie or a runny center! Hope this helps... It is definately a great pie to enjoy and I feel so bad for those of you who were discouraged by the pie not being completely baked! Give it another try and I promise you won't be disappointed!

This may be a good pie, but, when I cooked it and let cool, the center was juicy, returned to oven cooked another hour and top turned hard and dark brown, center was still soft. Something is still very wrong with the time or temp....

I am rating this according to my (new )husband. When he told me he wanted a Chess pie I knew I had big shoes to fill because he bragged on his first wife's pie making skills. I was nervous about making this pie because I have NEVER made a chess pie before..after 1 slice he said it was the best he has ever eaten. It was not runny or grainy, it was perfect!!!!  Thanks for this recipe

Ok, after reading several of the reviews I finally made this pie.  I followed the ingredients exactly except I used about 3/4 tablespoon of jiffy muffin mix instead of cornmeal because it's what I had on hand. I let the milk, butter, and eggs get to room temperature before mixing. I baked it as instructed for 10 minutes at 425 then I baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes at 300 and let it sit in the oven until it cooled. The pie turned out perfect. It had the perfect crusty top and was firm, not gooey at all, on the inside. It is definitely eggy and sweet but if you like chess pie it's perfect.

First off the recipe needs to be tweaked for time. I had to cook for an additional 30 mins @ 325 ( in a toaster oven) to get the pie to set after I brought the pie to a function and then realized it was liquid. Also I could taste the eggs. It was like flan or some type of custard. I am going to try a few more times after i tweek the recipe.
[UPDATE]
I tried the recipe again I did 1-1/2 cups of white sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/4 cup of dark corn syrup and then followed the recipe and added 30 mins at 300 degrees. This pie was fantastic, a nice constistancy. The next day I tried it again with the same time and temp but I omitted the corn syrup and did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar. The result was a pie that had an over powering taste of egg. I am wondering if the order that I am combining ingredients account for the egg taste.

this is a wonderful recipe, for a wonderful pie!!! The recipe has been changed and modified many times over the years. However the original and literally it is and was (JUST pie),, but due to the fact that it is a southern dish,, the name "jes pie" is how it is pronounced in the south,, it comes out chess pie!!

This pie was delicious.  I an not from the south and had never heard of chess pie before.  I have hens and lots of eggs so I was looking for new recipes that call for eggs. I added 1 cup of sweetened shredded coconut (I'm from Hawaii) and cut the sugar to 1-2/3 cup. I also baked it at 350 for about 50 minutes as I do pumpkin pie. It was beautifully browned and perfectly set.  Perfect!

This was the first pie I have ever made- EVER- and even my picky eater of a husband loved it! It's a custardy pie, very rich. It goes great with a big cup of tea or milk. It's very simple to make

I tried twice to make this and both times it turned out with a burnt top and liquid middle!

If you try to cook it longer, the rest of the pie burns.  Something is definately wrong with this recipe!

this pie is so delicious.  the only problem i have is that the top always cracks after it's done. (Does anyone know how to prevent this)? also i think the initial 10 minutes could be increased some to help brown the bottom better.  But we love it, and i make it often.

It's been years since I made a chess pie because we lost my grandmother's recipe.  Decided to try this one.  I used whole milk rather than evaporated and left out the vinegar.  I know a lot of people said this was too sweet, but I have had chess pies even sweeter than this.  This was really good but not as good as my grandmother's.  I hope one day I'll figure out the exact recipe she used.   As for cooking it, I also preheated at 425, then turned down to 300 when I put in the pie.  I cooked it about 50 min, then turned off the oven and left it in for about 20 more minutes. The top was brown but not burnt.  It only had a couple of tiny cracks around the edges.  I didn't cut it until the next day, but it was PERFECT consistency.

we have made this pie several times following the recipe exactly as written, never had any issues with it. also never added any toppings. I'm from the south and this is a traditional chess pie. greatly enjoy it every time. NOTE: if you have issues with it being runny make sure to use real butter not margarine. margarine has water in it to make it spreadable. happy baking.

The recipe do not work for me at all. It had the right consistency, but the taste was a little to eggy. I guess its all according to what your used to in chess pie. My pie firmed around the edges but took forever to firm in the middle leaving me with a slighty burned pie.

Make chess pies all the time.  My recipe differs slightly. I use 1 cup sugar 1/2 brown sugar, 1/4 whole milk and only 3 well beaten eggs.  Because of cook time I cover the crust with either tin foil or crust covers for 1/2 the cooking time.

My boyfriend (who is from Tennessee) told me awhile back that he loves chess pie. Being a yankee I had to look it up to see what it was. I saw this recipe and made it for him for his birthday and it came out perfect! I followed the advice of some of the others here and baked it at the recommended time and temps, but then turned the oven off and let the pie cool in the oven. I also didn't have white vinegar on hand so I substituted apple cider vinegar. No runniness, not too eggy, very sweet, perfectly golden brown on top. He loved it! Thanks for the great recipe. I've got an extra pie shell so I'm going to bake another one soon.

I loved this pie.  Very, very, sweet.  I used lemon instead of vinegar, (I was out of vinegar) it was great. I wanted something sweet and I had to find something I had the ingredients for on hand.  This fit the bill. I will be making it again.

I should have read the reviews first; I followed the original directions and it came out looking like a waterbed. Definitely bake at 350 for 50 minutes and cover the outer crust, and definitely leave it in the oven after you turn it off.

This is the pie of my childhood.  One bite and I was back at my grandmother's table...what a memory it was.  I prepared the recipe as written, with the exception of pre-heating to 450 degrees and then lowering the temperature when placing the pie in the oven.  Next time I will add some coconut.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Here's what happened to me: I made the pie exactly as directed and ended up with "soup pie."  It set for about 5 minutes, and then went completely soupy.  It was awful.  I carefully read the reviews again and took Wilemon's advice and added coconut (fab idea!) and CRIVY1's advice and did the preheating thing and added the heavy whipping cream and what do you know!  I ended up with a great pie that everyone loves!  It was well worth failing the first time.  The only thing I would change for making it again is cut the sugar in half. It is extremely sweet.   Thanks for all the tips guys!

made two of these pies for Thanksgiving this year.  My family fell upon it like ravenous wolves.  My dad said that he just didn't like the pie, he thought it was the best chess pie he had ever had.  What we liked most was the crust that it made on top.

This is very similar to recipe I've used for years and that people at my church ask for frequently.  However, my recipe only uses 3 eggs and 1-1/2 C sugar.  It does crack a lot which I don't like.  Letting it cool in the oven will help somewhat, but I believe the cracking is due to the cornmeal which forms the crust.  A lot of the seasoned-chess-pie-makers I know do not include cornmeal in their recipes.

I have been making this pie for years. Started making it because it was what we could afford & had on hand at the time lo. It is a favorite of my entire family. Never served it with a topping but just may try that. I also make the Pumpkin-Chess Pie version too.

It had a nice taste but it didn't set well for me. It was very runny but the top was very crisp and a dark golden brown. I made another chess pie recipe with only 3 eggs and no evaporated milk and they turned out perfect.

Success must depend on your oven because I had made this before but set the oven at 425 for 10 minutes and finished at 350 for 50+ minutes. That almost worked, but was a little runny. 
This time I followed the directions exactly, let it cool, then poured out the filling which was barely starting to set up at the edge.

I followed this exactly how it's written, well I got some of the same results others got, liquid runny, not setting well I covered my crust edges and bumped up the temp to 350 for about 12 more mins and it set perfect. So instead of 300, 350 for aprox. 30 mins that should do it. I will get back to you all on taste...lol!

This is one of the best pies I have ever tasted!  My Southern Husband's Grandmother makes one every X-mas, but won't give out her recipe!  Living in LA, my husband missed home (and the pie), but this recipe seemed to make him smile!  (I can't wait to make it foe HIS GRANDMA!) Thanks!

I wanted to make this pie for my dad  when he came to visit. I made it with only two substitutions. I didn't have white vinegar so I used rice vinegar. I also didn't have plain cornmeal so I used one tablespoon of cornbread mix. The most important thing is that I followed the baking instructions of another reviewer, KatieJane79, and after baking for the recommended time I just turned the oven off and left the pie in until it was room temperature. The pie turned out perfect. It was a beautiful golden color and had no runny middle or cracks in it. It tasted wonderful. I decided that if the previous reviewer's family had made it that way for generations, I would try her method. Thank you for the tip!!

I made this with Splenda in place of the sugar and lemon juice in place of the vinegar, and it still worked beautifully. Baked it in a part-coconut-flour, gluten-free, short-crust pastry shell, which got a drizzle of maltitol syrup and a scattering of fresh strawberries before the filling was poured in. Very pretty tart, very well-received.

Reminds me of my Great Grandmother Moa(RIP) -this taste exactly like hers- now that I know how too make it:I fear my diet is losing a never ending battle.

A nice add on since I've had time to experiment is lime zest and the juice from one small lime -gives it a pleasant kick!

I was informed earlier this week that I was in charge of dessert for Thanksgiving. I was actually looking for something else when I happened across this recipe.  As a child growing up in north central Kentucky my grandmother, a country girl from a small Kentucky town, would make chess pie occasionally around the holidays. She's been gone many years now and I haven't had a chess pie in a long time. Upon seeing this recipe, I decided we were having chess pie along with the usual pumpkin and pecan pies. I followed the recipe to the letter and was rewarded with a near perfect pie. It wasn't quite as good as my grandmother's but it was pretty close. It was the first dessert gone out of at least five others. My mother and oldest sister (both great cooks) pronounced it wonderful. I have been told to bring two next time. By the way, this was the first pie I have ever baked in my fifty plus years. I had one issue however. The cook time was a little longer than called for. I'll be using this recipe again come Christmas.

I was so intrigued by this recipe and could not figure out how this would taste or how it could be good, based on the ingredients.  So naturally I had to try it.

I actually made it gluten free to accommodate some family members, simply using a gluten free pre-made pie crust.  I also substituted a mixture of apple cider vinegar and lemon juice for the white vinegar, since I forgot to grab it at the store.

I am happy to report that this pie is absolutely delicious.  Even the kids who were skeptical raved about it after they tried it.  It is so rich and satisfying.  This has already been requested for Christmas next year.  It's definitely going on the holiday menu going forward.

My husband,  who will only eat chocolate cake and chocolate chip cookies, thought this pie was good. WHAT??!!! So, I gave it a five. I will make this again without the cornmeal in it. My kids LOVED it!

Just thought I would add my two cents.....

NO..... the top of your pie should not be burnt..... it should however be brown NOT BURNT....so please don't be mislead by people telling you that it should be "BURNT"

Great recipe otherwise

Chess pie is my favorite pie ever. And growing up in the Tennessee back country hills, everyone's Granny makes them. I used this recipe, with 4 eggs but used the buttermilk and half brown/white sugars....Its a lil too eggy for me. I will make it with 3 eggs next time and see how I like it then. Overall very very close to good country chess(buttermilk) pie. :)

This has become my tried and true chess pie recipe.  It is by far one of my childhood favorites.  I have a 10-inch pie plate that I use so when I make it I sometimes double the filling.  This is a simple can not fail recipe comes out perfect everytime.

Nice pie, everything turned out perfectly. However, it was very sweet. Perhaps, I was looking for more of a custard type of pie.

I got very nervous after reading the reviews - the pie turned out perfect! It's a golden brown. I did have to cover the crust to keep from getting too brown and I let it sit in the oven until cooled down and then on the counter for just a bit. Follow the instructions and you shouldn't have a problem.

It turned out great! My husband loved it! I have to admit I was a little worried at first about the pie setting but it did after 1 hour and 15 minutes and cooling in the oven. I also changed somethings in the recipe as well. I used almond milk as a milk substitute , 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2, 3 eggs instead of 4, and apple cider vinegar since I didn't have any white vinegar. After a hour and 15 minutes I cut the stove off and aloud it cool inside and out came a wonderful chest pie.

I made this for work for a themed party. It was well received. :) The flavour of this pie is nice but my favourite part has to be the 'burned' flaky top.

HYPER sweet!!! I know this is traditionally a very sweet pie, but it was too sweet for us. We tried it for the first time in a homey little place in Nashville, TN, so we wanted to have it for Thanksgiving. The flavor was very good, just too much sugar. It worked out though, because our blueberries were very tart last summer, so if you had a fork full of blueberry pie and a fork full of Chess pie at the same time, they were both perfect. I will try it again.

This is my second review that I must share it was so delicious and my husband couldn't help himself and ate 2 slices and he said it was better than a sweet potato pie.  Once again this was a great two thumbs up recipe.

This crust tastes wonderful, but I followed the recipe to the T and it NEVER set. :-(  I even left it in the oven longer than I should have,the crust was beautifully brown and crispy (without cracking) but completely liquid inside.

I've used this recipe a couple times now, preparing to use it again tomorrow for Father's Day, and I absolutely love it.  Chess Pie was something I learned about while living in Kentucky, and I get cravings for it back up here in the North, where no one has ever heard of it.  This recipe fills my need.  Variation: I ran out of vanilla extract one time, so I substituted almond extract -- it was delicious!  I'm baking two for tomorrow, and I may do one almond and one vanilla.  It makes me wonder what would happen with other flavors...

If I remember correctly I made this exactly according to the recipe. I had never had or really known of chess pie until recently. I thought it came out the way I imagined, and was very tasty and sweet (probably appropriately). I brought it to work for a co-worker who said it was very good. Throughout the day I had several people come up to me saying it was lethal (as in extra delicious), and it was gone in no time! Based on everyone else's reaction, this recipe is great!

This was an awesome recipe!  Very easy to make and a simply wonderful pie.    The only change I made was to add an extra egg since I like my custard pies to be a little "eggy."    My Daughter has Celiac so I pulled out a little custard before adding the cornmeal (mine is not GF) and baked it in a custard dish in a water bath - she loved it!  I served it with Cool Whip because our family believes there are not many desserts that can't be enhanced with a little CW.    I will be making this pie again! (and again, and again...)

I had to cook this pie 40 minutes longer than the recipe called for because it stayed liquidy! Then I let it sit in the oven until it cooled down. I followed the directions exactly. Even then, the pie 'wept' liquid when it was cut and the crust was not even baked. I will NOT try this pie again. HOWEVER, IT MAY BE THE SIZE OF THE EGGS WHICH CAUSE THIS RECIPE TO WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE AND 'BOMB' FOR OTHERS. I USED 4 EXTRA-LARGE EGGS IN THE RECIPE. MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH SMALLER OR FEWER EGGS!

EXCELLENT pie. Was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Was a creamier pie than the ones I have had in the past and was a wonderful bonus. The only thing that I would suggest is to cook it longer than the directions because was not set in middle until baked for an hour. YUM!

It did not cook in the middle.  RUNNY!!!  It could be because I used a deep dish pie.  But I did taste the flavor I was looking for, just needed to set in the middle.

I made this pie exactly as is (except I left it in the oven until the oven cooled, thus setting the center a bit more), and it was very good.  It was a raving success at my Thanksgiving dinner, and it disappeared before any of the other desserts.  It is a quintessential chess pie, with a dark, cracked top and a soft center.  To me, it was a bit sweet (which is the point), so I just made another one, substituting whipping cream  for the evaporated milk and adding flaked coconut...which won't make it any less sweet, but it sounds good anyway.  I'll let everybody know how it compares.

My husband made this pie and it was ok but did not set up well and tasted like it was missing something although he followed the recipe exactly.  We might try it again.

Used this recipe.  Pie was very sweet.  Actually sweeter than what we thought would be.  Also after cooking, top cracked and turned very dark.  Would suggest covering top of pie with aluminum foil to keep from burning.

I love this recipe.  I put the pie in a preheated oven at 450,  I turned it down to 350 once the pie went in. I also put the pie on the lowest rack.  Tented it until the last 10 min.  I did add 5 minutes to the cook time.  Let it cool in the oven and it came out perfectly set. Love love love it.

I made this pie with this recipe, but it came out like a melted butter pie with a hard top. I have made it with other recipes, but this one was not a good one.

I don't know if it was better the first day or the second day after it set really nicely in the fridge. This is chess pie like my mother used to make! I will say that I followed some good advice from reviewers to substitute heavy whipping cream for evaporated milk, and because I remembered my mom using dark Karo syrup in hers, I put in a teaspoon and backed off a half a cup of the sugar.  This pie was perfect! The top crusted over and cracked and fell perfectly, as it should.  I had lost and found my best chess pie recipe several times over. This is it! I will not lose it again.  Insanely good!

Well, i finally got it right this time...yayyyy!!! This is for anyone who's had the problem of a "soupy" filling that won't cook: cover your pie with aluminum foil during last 1/2 hr of baking. It keeps the top from burning, holds in moisture and allows the custard to cook and congeal. That being said, this recipe is totally heavenly! You and your family will love it so mich, you'll want to eat  the whole dang pie!!! Mm mm good!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and the pie turned out perfect! After the 40 minutes were up I did turn off the oven and let the pie cool off in the oven for another 30 min or so. My husband and I enjoyed it immensely!

Delicious and easy to make. The recipe make more than one regular 9 in pie shell. Using a deep dish shell or putting less batter in 2 regular shells will prevent cooking over.

Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! For years, I've searched for the perfect chess pie recipe, only to be disappointed every time. They never, ever, set right.... And, if they do, it's simply sub-standard. Until, I tried this recipe! Finally, just like Granny used to make--I can't wait to make one for the next family reunion! :)

Just made this, and it was as delicious as promised.  The only problem was the filling wa soupy after cooking according to directions.  I ended up cranking the oven up to 350 degrees and cooking an extra half hour. The top was extra brown, but still tasted great.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it set properly but there was entirely too much sugar. I would scale back the sugar by at least 1/2 cup. I did't need the extra time in the oven as suggested by other reviewers. I wanted to taste the other ingredients more, though. The sugar content was very over-powering. It may need a 1/4 teaspoon of salt as well if you use unsalted butter.

I have made this Chess Pie about 4 times and 3 of the 4 turned out perfect.  Only once, did it come out a little runny.  Actually, if I think about it, some things I make over and over again don't always have the same outcome.  So, give this one a try.  You will LOVE IT!!

Whooooholy  this is SWEET! Like, a headache in each slice. Not sure if that is how it is supposed to taste, but am going to cut way back on the sugar next time. I agree with the other reviewers to up the cooking time.

I used this recipe and it worked for me. I did a practice round and found that if I use a little less butter and cook on 350 for 50 minutes you get a nice finishing on the top and in the center. It tastes delicious! My family went wild! I would use this recipe again. :)

I did not care for this recipe.  After reading reviews, I adjusted the baking time by 20 minutes, still was not done, so I thought, ok, I cannot eat it this way, so I put it back in the oven and changed the temp to 325 for another 30 minutes, finally, I gave up.  Pie has not set.

Doubled recipe and used two 9-inch stote bought pie crust.  Too much mix for crust so put remainder in baking cup.  Pies ran over, fortunately on cookie sheets beneath them.  Pies very brown.  Tasted pie from baking cup and it is very good! Tlclady

I wanted to fix something like my grandmother used to fix and I tried this.  I guess I mixed it too much, it came out smooth on the top and there is WAYYYYY too much sugar in it.  I am going to try this again but only using about 1 1/4 cup sugar.  Maybe even one cup.  Other than that I think once I fiddle with it more that it will be exactly like my grandma's.  Thank you so much for sharing this.

I made this pie for the first time at Thanksgiving & it was absolutely delicious!  My only trouble was with the cooking time - after I turned the oven down, the pie was in for 60 minutes and was still almost liquid in the middle!  I took it out anyway because the crust was getting way too dark even with a metal pie shield.  Not sure what I did wrong, but it still tasted great!  I'm going to try again for Christmas dinner.

I made two of these pies for my daughter's 8th grade graduation party... per her request.  We also had a cake.  At the end of the party both pies were long gone and the cake was untouched... and it was a nice cake too.  The only caveat is these pies need a longer cook time than indicated.  I ended up throwing them in the over at 300 for an additional 20 minutes.  Then they setup firm.  Thanks.

The pie was beautiful, but the flavor was less than desirable, like egg flavored custard.  I definitely won't make this again.  I'm only giving it two stars because it was still edible despite the flavor.

hi all! this was soupy and gooey! i followed the instructions to a tee, and not only was it so soupy, it tasted like nothing but dissloved sugar. i love sweet things, but this was so sweet with no other taste to it but sugar. We did not eat it. I thought something might be strange when i tasted the batter before pouring it into the crust. The sugar did not dissolve and I tasted the sugar granuals in the mix. Thought it seemed weird the sugar did not dissolve. Would never make again. Like i said, even if it did harden up, the taste is nothing but sugar!! I have made great chess bars before using cream chesse in the mixture and those were amazing!!

My husband thought this pie was absolutely wonderful!  Even I thought it was good and I don't like custard. Very rich!

This actually made enough for 2 pies.  It was good, but it came out a bit runny inside.  I followed Crivy1's advice and turned the oven off to let it set, so I didn't overcook the top.  However, it still wasn't very firm or set inside.  But it had a good flavor and was close to what my husband remembered it to be (he's from North MS).  I would try again and use cream next time to hopefully thicken it some.

So delicious. I didn't have a few ingredients, so I substituted. I only had one cup of sugar, so I replaced the rest with brown sugar. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I replaced the evaporated milk and the vinegar with buttermilk. I didn't have cornmeal, so I used almond meal. It was great. I can't wait to try it as written (although maybe with less sugar).

Follow the recipe to the "T" after it cooled completely down it was runny on the inside not sure what happen. Cook it 10 minute @400 than 40 minutes @300. Half was set the other half runny taste too much like eggs, good thing I like eggs.

I made this pie, EXACTLY TO THE TEE. The ONLY difference was in the baking.  As KatieJane79 suggested, I left the pie in the oven until the oven cooled to room temperature.  It did not burn.  No need to cover the crust with foil to prevent burning.  I will say that for me, whipped topping is not necessary.  This pie is sweet enough and tasty enough without it!

The taste was fantastic, the only issue I had was the oven temps. Mines was not solid at the end of the cooking cycle. I had to put it back in the stove for 35 mins at 350 and it came out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

I made it for my husband today for the first time ever. 
 Happy Father's day, sweetie.  He ate half in one sitting. My son and I don't eat pie.  My husband LOVED it.  I did have to bake it about 50 + mins. The first time I took it out it the middle 'slooshed' in the pie shell. I added 10 more mins let it cool in the oven and about 30+ minutes in the fridge. The consistency was PERFECT.  
If you add the foil on top while baking be careful not to remove it until it's well cool. The top will stick if you remove it too soon.
I give this recipe 5

I made this pie like the recipe with the exception  of the time and temperature. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers. I preheated the oven to 450 then turned the temp down to 350 once I put the pie in the oven for 50 minutes then left in the oven to cool with heat off. It set well and is delicious!

This recipe was great! I ended up making two different pies. The first pie I followed the recipe as written but baked it for about an hour and moved it to the top rack during the last 10 mins. The pie was wonderful but a bit too sweet. So on the second pie i used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and PERFECT. Hope this helps!

Thankfully I read some of the reviews before making this.  I usually try to make as is the first time, but I'm glad I read and made some modifications.  #1 used less sugar (about 1.5 cups) and raised the temp of the oven to 325 and baked for nearly an hour.  Then let it sit in the oven for about 30.   Even so, the center was still a little runny, but not too bad.  Will make this again, but will definitely bake for a little bit longer.

Far too much sugar. Twice what most pies use. It was so sweet it made my teeth ache. Next time I will try half as much sugar.  I believe  it will be an excellent pie after that.

I followed the recipe to the T and I also got a runny center. I upped the temperature to 350 for another 15-20 mins and it was perfect. Next time I'll just bake at 350.

Easy peasy, but cut sugar to 1.5 cups...still super sweet and comforting.  :)

Something went wrong and we ended up with pie soup. Even though the toothpick test was passed, the middle of the pie was very liquid after hours of chilling.

I used sweetened evaporated milk. Cooked two pies and had to leave it in the oven a bit longer for firmness.

Seemed really jiggly when the time ran out, but I did like several comments said to, and turned the oven off and left the pie in there til the oven cooled down. When I took the pie out it was totally set, and done perfectly. This is a delicious pie, and I am so happy it turned out well. Did not disappoint!! ??????

I had to add ten minutes at 300° for the pie to set,and I let it cool in the oven. The pie looked perfect at first but was definitely not done in the middle. After I added time the pie seemed to expand and the pie, and crust cracked. Not sure why but if I make it again I may go to 325° for 50 mins. I don't blame the recipe.

An important note to remember: you would want to make extra. Every time I make it, the family eats it up in one sitting and I always have to make more.

The exterior was beautiful, but the interior was pure soup. Followed the recipe to a T. Very disappointing,  as this was a surprise for my boyfriend. He's been hinting about wanting a chess pie for almost a year.

I made it with brandy. I wouldnt recommend the addition, as it made the pie runny. Gave it a nice flavor though/  Next time ill make it as the recipe suggests, with the exception of the sugar, ill put stevia in instead.

This pie turned out perfect! I followed the recipe exact + followed the tips in the reviews to turn oven off after the 4O minutes to let pie cool in oven + the inside was perfect! Took to my family Thanksgiving + received great reviews.

Followed instructions to the letter. And let it cool down for an hour. 

Though it tasted good, the pie turned out runny. ??

Three stars, for taste, but zero for the turn out.

Make sure you use a deep 9-10” dish!  I baked my crust for 4 minutes before filling. Over all, rich, nice tasting chess pie.  I like using heavy cream vs evaporated milk. I tweaked recipe one time to include orange vs vanilla then added tablespoon triplesec. My hubby loved it!

Reminded me of pecan pie without the pecans. Next time i will make it with all white sugar. I followed other reviews and did half brown sugar.  I don't use evaporated milk so I used butter milk. I doubled the recipe and made 2 deep dish pies they took roughly 80 minutes to cook @ 350, and i left in the oven with it off for an additional 15 minutes. I will use this recipe again.

I made the pie for a Church Fellowship.  Tasted very good but i had trouble when baking. The recipe calls for a 9 in pie shell. The filling over flowed instantly in the oven and started smoking up the house.  I finished baking as directed with windows open. It did seem to set but when cut still was very creamy.  I am not sure what happened but if i was to make again i would cook in deep dish shell.

The only change I made was to make my own pie crust. Pretty sure the store-bought crust may be the source of some bad reviews. But hey,  I don’t judge. At least you made a pie!

It’s also very sweet. That’s just how chess pie is. If you don’t want a really sweet pie, make an apple tart. You can also serve this with unsweetened whipped cream to cut the intense sweetness.

Tracy, I had the same problem with mine not setting after using the recipe EXACTLY as written.  I just made mine today and when I tried to cut it, it was pure liquid.  I NOW have it back in my oven and have been baking it at 400 degrees for 45 more minutes.  It comes out in a few minutes and I certainly hope it's set.  I have made other Chess recipes with great results, I just didn't want to go looking for the recipe I used so I used this one from the internet.  IF it turns out after the additional baking time, I will review again.

This recipe seems to have some holes... where are the instructions regarding the crust? Do you blind bake it? Pour the filling into a hot, warm, or cooled crust? I had to do a lot of cross-referencing with Chess Pie recipes from other websites to make a game plan. In the end, I did blind bake it, and I poured the filling into a partly-cooled crust. Maybe if I let it cool all the way I could have avoided the shrinkage. I took Christopher Kimball's advice and removed the pie when it was still pretty wobbly. It firmed up perfectly as it cooled.

At first, I just thought, it tastes like pure sugar! But the pie was much better the next day, as the vanilla flavor deepened, making it less one-dimensional. It reminded me of a giant egg custard tart, or a "dan-tat" from Cantonese dim sum.  I do like the burnt top.

Next time I will try adding lemon, cinnamon, or almond extract for some added dimension.

Great pie! I just wish I had opened the oven door for a bit when I lowered the temperature. The cornmeal top crust puffed waaay up then fell into something resembling a crumble as it cooled. Affected the look, but not the taste. Plan  to make a lemon version next week.

Before this, I had never tasted-- let alone baked-- a chess pie.  But I was intrigued when I saw a picture of a "Southern Chess Pie" somewhere, and I've wanted to make it ever since.  Being my first time trying it, and having no other pie to compare it to, I would still say it came put wonderfully.  It looked exactly like the pictures, dark golden and crispy on top, and smooth and pale yellow inside.  I made a big mistake in baking temperature because I was too hasty when I first read the instructions.  I accidentally left my pie baking for 40 minutes at 425 degrees the whole time!  But I had covered the outer edges with foil, and thankfully that saved the day.  My crust didn't burn at all, and I guess that high heat baked the rest of the pie just right.  I decreased the sugar to about 1 and 3/4 cup. Also, I used a TBS. of cornmeal muffin mix instead of plain cornmeal because that is all I had.  It all still came out delicious and held up beautifully in nice clean slice, no cracks.

Oh my heavens, this is delicious!
I followed the recipe as written, and it came out perfect.  It had to cook a little longer, just tested with a knife until it was set.
This was exactly what I was craving!

I read these reviews before making it, then read other recipes. I baked it 5 minutes longer and let it sit in the oven. But most importantly, the tblsp of flour called for in other recipes is a must to make it firm. Otherwise IMO this recipe is a 3-Star.

P.S.  I’m going to try a little buttermilk next time.

I'd make this again for sure. The only changes I made was I used a 1/2 Cup light brown sugar and 1 1/2 cup white sugar. I also used half and half instead of evaporated milk because I had it on hand already. It was a hit at a potluck. One woman went back for seconds and usually doesn't eat desserts. Another asked for the recipe. I'd never made it before, but it was so easy. Just follow the recipe and let cool in the oven. Perfect!

My son loves Chess Pie and I made two from this recipe for Thanksgiving.  They were wonderful and made me recall my Great-grandmother's Chess Pies.  He loved them and took the leftover pie  back to his out-of-state home.  Will use this recipe  every time he comes home.

This pie has me stressed out! I made this pie as a nice thing to do for me grandma, followed instructions to the tee even marked ouff things with a permanent marker as I went. Checked on it at the time and it was a soupy mess! I have been reading all of the reviews and trying to increase the cooking time to see if I can rectify this mess before my grandmother gets home. The cooking one is way too short that’s for sure! Waiting for the the pie to come out now no see if anything has changed. In my efforts to fix this I have covered the pie with aluminum foil in efforts to not burn the top and I bumped up the temp to 350. Pray for me! Will be back with final review.

I'd never had Chess Pie before making this, but when I lived in different parts of the south, I always heard people say it was yummy. It reminds me a lot of Pecan Pie - which I love - with white sugar and without the nuts. I had to substitute half and half for the evaporated milk and don't think it affected the end result too much. The custard was a tiny bit soft in the middle. I wondered if I should've left it in the oven 5 more minutes, but, since I've never made the pie before, I wasn't sure what its consistency was supposed to be like. The taste was delicious, but just a bit too sweet for me. I also thought it was a little plain, so I'll be trying the lemon or chocolate versions. Coconut would be great, too, though I've never heard anyone mention that variety. My boyfriend loved it and thought the sweetness was just right, so I'm sure Chess Pie will stay on our dessert list. I love when people submit family recipes, so I thank the poster for sharing.

Did not come out soupy but had very little filling, I used a deep dish pie plate.  Had good flavor but was disappointed with the small amount of filling.  Won't make again but appreciate the recipe.

So good! My notes:•• Use half the sugar •• only use 3 eggs •• add 1 tbsp flour •• Use vanilla paste, add a little extra (2 tsp ••)425 for 10 minutes then 350 for 50 minutes.  ••Open oven door, leave pie in a while to cool down at least to warm, until it's no longer hot. Comes out perfect!

I made this pie twice thinking I did something wrong. I followed the directions exactly step by step and both still came out watery. I also left it in the oven to cool down and it was still the same watery. I will have to try another recipe.

I read many reviews.  Swapped heavy cream for evaporated milk and went with the 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar route with oven preheated to 450 then down to 350 when I put the pie in the oven.  Covered the pie crust with foil - glad I did.  I ended up baking this sucker for 1 hr 20 minutes - just trying to get the soup out of the middle.  Let it cool in the oven.  However, husband loved it, ate 90% himself, and asked for another one to be made.  LOL.  I think I am going to try the next attempt with 3 eggs instead of 4 and see what  impact that has.  But, honestly, it was a good pie and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and thanks for all the helpful reviews.

Great recipe. I was searching for something to make for dessert and came upon your recipe. This sure takes me back. My grandmother and aunts used to make these. Really great for when fruit wasn't in season and you had a sweet tooth for some pie. Kids didn't care for it but my husband was impressed. He's from up north and had never heard of this before. He really really liked it. He calls it chest pie lol. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful old timey recipe!

This is just fabulous!!  My brother in law calls it sugar cookie pie.  It takes on an almost crème brulee quality with the caramelized top.  The only thing that I do differently is to add just 3 eggs, a little less milk and a little less cornmeal so that it will fit into a standard pie shell.  I also cook it at 350 for 50 minutes and then let it sit in the turned off oven until the oven completely cools.  This ensures that the middle completely sets firm.  Incredible stuff!

Hello, 
I am a food historian - but from another part of the world, from Europe, and I have never heard of Chess pie before. I followed the link, because I was curious if it resembles the chess-board cake, which was popular in South-Eastern Europe in the 1980s. I saw that there is no connection, but the recipe made me wonder: why is it called a Chess pie? Does anyone know where the name comes from? Thank you!

I think I would use buttermilk time next instead of vinegar, and regular milk. It had a very good taste, but needed to be just a little  bit thicker.

I have made this pie twice. The first time it came out perfect very delicious with great consistency. The second time it came out as pudding, the only thing I did different was use margarine instead of butter( the 2nd time).  My pie did not set.  I know it had to be butter. I hope this can help someone else having trouble.

This was really good, but next time I'll reduce the sugar. It's not just that it was over-the-top sweet; you can actually taste the straight sugar, which I don't think should ever be the case.

This is very close to recipes handed down to me in NC.  The biggest difference is the cream in it and often one less egg.  Yours is delicious!  I just want to add (for those who had problems) that  traditionally this pie is not done in a deep dish.  That will take it forever in the oven and it may still not set up.  Don't ask me how I know that in front of my mama!

The pie came out perfectly....just follow the bake instructions to the letter and you will have a tasty treat!!! 
The pie will be done when it has slightly risen in the middle
I always try to change up the pieces choices  on Thanksgiving and was pleasantly surprised with this one due to all the reviews on the problem with the bake!!!
Try those pieces and you will have a great choice to your repertoire!

This is a simple yet delicious pie! After reading several reviews, I chose to reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups instead of 2 full cups. Even with 1/2cup less sugar, this pie was more than sweet! I also followed several others' suggestions by using 3 eggs instead of 4 for concern that the pie would be "eggy."  With 3 eggs, the consistency and taste was great. I also left the pie in the oven to cool after baking at the suggested times was complete.

I have no idea what is going on with my pie..After the 50 minutes of cook time, it looked beautiful. Brown cripsy crust..Lake of egg underneath. I then re-baked it another 40 minutes and it looks like its getting firm? I am leaving it in the off oven to cool down as it is still jiggly. 

New oven issue? High altitude? Who knows..

Followed the recipe exactly. It was a big hit. Firmed up nicely with a top "crust". I opened the oven after cooking time and left the pie in for about 15 minutes.  Old-fashioned taste

OMG! I READ THE REVIEWS AFTER MY PIE WAS IN THE OVEN :), I WENT BY THE RECEIPE, MY PIE IS TOTALLY AWESOME. IT WAS SMELLING SO GOOD. ONLY THING DIFFERENT I DID WAS LEAVE IT IN THE OVEN EXTRA 15 MINS,AND I ALSO TURNED IT UP TO 350'. I THEN  LEFT IT IN OVEN TO COOL. MINE DID CRACK BUT IT WAS PERFECT. TASTE AWESOME. I WILL ADD COCONUTS NEXT TIME JUST TO EXPERIMENT:)

I made this for my family and it tasted great, but a little too runny. I baked it for 10 minutes longer than the recipie called for. Next time I'll leave the pie in the oven after I turn it off, to cook a little longer.

I've tried several different recipes for sugar pie, buttermilk pie and chess pie. This is my favorite. The crunchy, brown cornmeal crust on top makes ALL the difference. This recipe is also one of the easiest which is always a good thing!

Love the fact that I'm using natural ingredients.  It's rich and delicious.   The browned cornmeal was perfect and the other ingredients blended together beautifully.  Not sure what the vinegar was for, but I couldn't taste it.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

 The pie wasn't set when I first removed it from the oven.  I slid a sheet of aluminum foil over the top and allowed it to bake a while longer before removing it.  The crust was still golden brown and the filling set nicely.

Very good. I subbed 2 cups of white sugar for 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also cooked the pie for a little longer than stated, while turn the temp up since it was still kind of runny. But minor tweaks, great pie especially for my first attempt at baking anything, lol.

I have made this delicious chess pie but I used buttermilk instead of what this recipe calls for and when the pie is done baking I sit on a wire rack to cool. When I made it for the first time it was kinda runny. I think maybe setting it on a wire rack to cool may help it set well.

First let me say that I really liked this pie, even though I had a bumpy start with the oven with it. If you cannot eat sweets then you need not try, it is sweet. My first taste reminded me of good quality almond macaroon cookies! Yes, I know there's no almond in this but that's the flavor I got, maybe the vinegar had something to do with that, in a good way! 
One point to make for first timers with this, and any other pie attempts. With the oven this hot to start, DO NOT use a cheap sheet pan to bake pie on, it will buckle and spill the liquid filling all over!!!! Use either the rack with a pan on the next shelf below or a good quality double layered sheet pan that will not twist from sudden high heat.......like I didn't use!! What a mess but I caught it in time and saved the pie from further damage. 
I will make this pie again and next time I think I'll try it in chocolate. Enjoy!

I followed directions but the pie never 'set'.  I read one post saying to not use a mixer but I did, does it make a difference in if the pie sets or not?  The pie tastes very good, just doesn't look too appealing since it is runny......  suggestions?

Excellent recipe, the only tweaking I did was cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups,  after making one pie as directed. I will make this again, you can't beat easy and delicious!

I used buttermilk in place of the evaporated, per another review's suggestion, but otherwise this went into the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this website and was phenomenal. It wasn't as knock-down sweet as I expected, which was a good thing!

This was runny and overly sweet. I would suggest reducing the sugar and increasing the cooking time.

My biggest complaint with this recipe (and I should have known better) is that it understates the amount of time, and the importance, of making sure that you cook the pie long enough so that it sets -- 50, 60, 70, 80 -- whatever it takes, it has to set, otherwise, it's ruined.

Like many other people, I followed this recipe exactly as directed two times and both times it would not set. I think the cooking time is incorrect. I'm never going to follow this recipe again, but if I did, maybe cooking it at 375 for 50 minutes would work because as directed it doesn't.

The reason to top the pie off with whipped cream is to cut down on the sweetness of the pie but doesn't affect the taste
