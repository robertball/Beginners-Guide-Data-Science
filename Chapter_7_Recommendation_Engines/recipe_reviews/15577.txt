This is super easy.  I was looking for a pie to use up a pre-made chocolate graham cracker crust and was able to pull the rest of the ingredients from stuff I had on hand.  I substituted whipped topping for the whipped cream and I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4c to compensate for the sweetness of the whipped topping.  I will make this again but next time I will reduce the sugar by at least another 1/4c.  This is a very sweet, rich pie so if you are serving to guests, think small slices ;-).

The filling was delicious.  I thought the crust was a little too thick, but my springform pan might be only 9".  I also think instead of the melted chocolate, chopped peanut butter cups would be really good.

I used a store-bought Oreo pie crust and Cool Whip instead of the whipping cream, subbed fat-free cream cheese and reduced-fat peanut butter. Very quick, a little healthier, and tastes just as great!

and covered w/ whipped cream, drizzled hot fudge and Reese's crumbles.

I wanted to make a peanut butter pie recipe that my mother had but she wasn't home. I decided to take a look on All Recipes and found this one which was pretty much the same. Its so creamy and the peanut butter chocolate combo satisfies your sweet tooth craving. Really easy but looks gourmet.

The first day we found this VERY sweet, I could only have a couple bites. But after letting it sit in the fridge overnight it was amazing the next day! The flavors combined very nicely.

I made two of these for father's day -- one for my dad and one for us : )  The only change I made was to use 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  This may be the best peanut butter pie ever.  Another reviewer said she didn't like that the peanut butter was the predominant flavor . . . that's what I loved!  It is a peanut butter pie, after all.  If I wanted a cheesecake, I would have made a peanut butter cheesecake.  This was very, very rich.  A small slice is all you can eat at once, but that means there's lots left over for later!  My dad called and said he loved it too!  Thanks!

I have been making a similar pie for years, but I lost the recipe.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.  I do have to say that I adapted this for a diabetic using dream whip and splenda.  Still very good

No need to add chocolate, the pie is already super sweet, I just decorated with pieces of reeses
Easy and a hit anywhere because it "tastes like a reeses puff" TRY IT!

I was very very excited to surprise my husband with this. He likes sweets and loves when peanut butter is involved. Well, It was WAAYYY to rich. Very dense. I really wished the cream cheese came accross a little bit more. It seems as though the peanut butter dominated and the other flavors dont stand a chance. In reading other reviews I decided against using this recipe for making the crust and used a store bought one. If you dont have shortening while melting choc. chips chances are it will be lumpy and/ or burnt and crispy. I froze 2 peanut butter cups and chopped. I mean look at the picture, it presents BEAUTIFULLY and the idea is divine, but I ended up with a husband who didnt like it, a mother in law who was trying to tell me the good things about it and me who finally ate it and was getting an upset stomach myself. Im not giving up on this one.. Next time I will use 4 more ounces of cream cheese and maybe 1/2 cup less of peanut butter. Im torn on this one. EDIT: This tasted much better on the next day.

Followed the recipe exactly as written...where can I begin?  Extremely sweet; very heavy and hard to digest; almost impossible to cut with the hard crust of chocolate chips and crust like cement.

Wow!  I thought this would make a good take-along for a block party.  Made it in a 9x13" pan, pressing crumbs only on the bottom.  Did what a couple of others have done; used 16 ounces cream cheese and 1 pint cream (didn't want to have 4 oz. cream cheese & 1/2 cup cream left over), and a whole 18-oz jar of smooth peanut butter.  Thought about chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for garnish, like some others, but just went for the remaining chocolate cookie crumbs.  Just tasting what was left in the bowl gave me a tummy ache, it's so RICH!  But delicious.  It should serve the whole block nicely.  Great recipe!

Very rich and delicious.  The texture was light and mousse-like, thanks to the whipped cream.  I brought this to a dinner party and it was well received.  I used chopped Miniature Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as recommended and that was good.  I recommend freezing the Peanut Butter cups first and chopping coarsely by hand.  The food processor made the cups too mushy even though I froze them partly and used only a few quick pulses.

Fabulous! VERY VERY rich. I could only eat a small piece of this, though I wanted more! I made this exactly as instructed, but added a whipped cream layer on top of the pie and then sprinkled it with some crushed oreos. Beautiful! I did have a little trouble melting the chocoloate and getting it runny enough to drizzle. I ended up burning the chocolate, which is why I did the whipped cream/cookie topping instead. It worked out well, and I probably will do the same thing again next time. Great recipe! I strongly recommend this recipe!!

I made this recipe with high hopes, and was disappointed. Everyone ate it, but with the left-overs, everyone scraped the filling off and ate the crust only. The texture of the filling was too soft and goopy, not firm enough. Almost like a pudding consistency. I will keep looking for a recipe we enjoy.

Great peanut buttery taste.  I didn't have 12 oz of cream cheese so I scaled the recipe down to 11 servings for the filling and kept the crumb portion at 16 servings.  I used a 12oz container of cool whip instead of whipping cream and cut the sugar in half.  I topped it with melted peanut butter as well.  I know my in laws are going to love this.

This turned out great and was SO easy.  I couldn't believe how good it was and I didn't even have to cook it! I used the Reeses Pcs on top like some others and skipped the chocolate.  I'll use both next time.  Thanks.

This was good, very rich.  I think I will reduce the sugar and the amount of cream cheese next time.  In addition, I will use low-fat whipped cream, as I think it makes it too rich.  
Also, I will make 2 pies, one for us and one to give away.  Will make again with the changes.

Simply...this is, hands down, the best of the best recipes!!! A lot of other recipes call for whipped topping but, trust me here, make your own whipped cream!! Also, if you use the pre-made crusts from the grocery store, this recipe will make two pies. Voila, freeze one!

I have made this pie maybe 12 times since I saw this recipe, the only complaint is that the crust is too thick, so I cut it back to 1 cup of cookie crumbs and 1/4 cup of sugar for the crust. For the filling I cut back on the sugar and only add 1 cup, for the topping I love fall colors so I added reeses pieces but sometimes I use chopped up reeses cups.

This did not turn out like I expected. It wasn't as rich and decadent as I thought it would be and it didn't set very well.  I let it chill for 5 hours before cutting into it and it just started to sink in. I actually think it needed less whipped cream. That not only took away from the richness, but also the firmness. The taste was ok, but not what you expect out of peanut butter pie.

Excellent recipe! I made two smaller pies instead of one large one. Just use two 9 in pie plates and follow the directions on the box of graham cracker crumbs to make the crusts, then divide the peanut butter filling between the two crusts. I kept one here, and my husband took one to work and it got rave reviews. It PAINS me to see that people used cool whip in place of the whipping cream! YUCK! That stuff isn't even real food! Do yourself and this pie a favor and get a carton of whipping cream. Chill your bowl and beaters for 15-20 minutes in the freezer, pour in your cream, and beat, beat, beat until you get whipped cream. Easy and so worth it! The flavor you get from real whipped cream is amazing. Real whipped cream and cool whip are NOT interchangeable! (Off my soapbox now. ;-)) Also, I put about a dozen mini chocolate and peanut butter cups in the food processor, and put those on top of the pie instead of the melted chocolate. Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great- I had enough for two pies with one recipe, but I used a pre-made pie shell not a spring form pan. Everyone raved that it was the best food they had all night!

AWESOME! I made this as a frozen desert and it was so good! I used "Cookie Dough for Ice Cream (Eggless)" from this site as the crust and used toffuti cream cheese and non-dairy whipping cream to keep it non-dairy. I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar. I added some cookie dough and chocolate chips to the batter and the top of the pie and drizzled the top with chocolate drizzle. I froze it for 12 hours and served it straight from the freezer! Really good!

Fabulous.Used 16oz. cream cheese, 2 cups each sugar and peanut butter and two cups whipping cream (mostly because i didn't want any ingredients left over).  topped with leftover cookie crumbs and chopped peanut butter cups. It pretty much filled my 10 inch springform to the top. Since there are just the two of us at home now, I gave about half away. this is a keeper.

This pie is so easy to make and it has become one of my favorite desserts.  It is so smooth and creamy!  Sometimes I add peanut butter cups to the top, or some other small candies.  

My boyfriend is always asking me to make this for dessert.  If you are a peanut butter lover, definitely give it a try.

This was very good, and my family loved it.  It was VERY messy to cut and serve, though, because the melted chocolate turned hard and dug into the pie as I was slicing it.  Next time I will use hot fudge instead of melted chocolate, or else garnish the pie with halved peanut butter cups.

Have made this recipe NUMEROUS times; after trying others as well, this one was voted BEST by my family.  The only thing I change is add peanut butter extract (if you can find it) instead of vanilla - just gives a stronger PB taste.  I also do the whipping cream step before the cream cheese mixture step, putting it in the fridge until the PB mixture is done.  Just seems like a time saver.

This is very good and very easy. I made it in a spring form pan and instead of drizzling the chocolate on top, I spread a tub of Cool Whip on top then served it with chocolate syrup. It made for  a very nice presentation.

I made it for a contest at work and it came in 1 st place.  I whipped up some heavy whipping cream with a few tablespoons of confectioners sugar and a little vanilla and spread that on top of the pie and drizzled some squeeze fudge from a bottle and it looked good and tasted good too. My mom liked it too.

I had a couple problems with the execution of this recipe.  I could not get the chocolate chips melted to pouring consistency and added milk to thin it and it gobbed up ( I know this was most likely user error).  Also the crust was hard as a rock to try and cut.

The filling was very good though!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I make 2 or more pies every Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has sort of become a tradition around here. I don't use the chocolate crust or topping though.  It's definitely a hit here!

Very rich! (serves more than what the recipe said...we had 9 adults & there was still 1/2 leftover)  I added peanut butter cups on top of the crust & on top of the pie.  I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes, but it went over very well...I added a bit more whip cream to lighten it up a bit.

The Kids love this pie! I think its pretty good although I did find that the crust was too gritty from the sugar. I would have preferred fine sugar.
