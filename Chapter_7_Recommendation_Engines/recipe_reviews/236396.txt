Because I read the comments  to this recipe BEFORE cooking these absolutely flavorful sweet potato fries,  too avoid mushiness, I: cut pototoes big, boiked only 2 minutes&  skipped the steaming. They werent mushy but still a lil soft but delicious!

Extremely yummy!! I substituted garlic salt for garlic powder and I didn't use cilantro as I thought it would be over powering for my taste.
