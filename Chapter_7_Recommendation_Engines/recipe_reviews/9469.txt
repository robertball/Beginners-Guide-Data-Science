Oh this is the best. I read the previous reviews about how this was too strong, so I started out with 3/4 of a cup. The only problem I ran into with this reduced amounnt of liquid was the inability to stir the fudge at all! So I added the remaining 1/4  of a cup. I didn't find this too strong.. guess it is personal preference. I am sure this will go over well at tomorrow's St. Patrick's Day party at work. Yes it does make more than an 8X8 pan. I also filled a loaf pan with the fudge. I lined both pans with foil and when the fudge was set, it was easy to cut.. just remove from pan lifting the foil.. and slice. Easier than trying to cut in the pan.  Update - this time I melted the chocolate in the microwave. MUCH easier and you don't have the worry of the chocolate seizing up on you as has happened to me before with a double boiler. Just dump the chocoalate and butter in microwave safe bowl, micro on high for like 45 seconds each time, give it a stir and then pop back in until it is almost completley melted. Stirring the chocoalte will get the last few bits to melt jsut fine.

Perhaps I'm spoiled by more traditional fudge recipes but, like other reviewers, I was less than pleased with the consistency of this.  Just not as creamy as it should be. I, too, threw it out. While this is easy to make, I guess you get out of something what you're willing to put into it. True fudge takes a bit more effort, but yields far better results.

YUM!  This is really very easy, and the results are super impressive!  Instead of all semi-sweet, I used half-and-half milk chocolate and semi-sweet.  It was still very rich, but that just made you happy with a smaller piece! (But that doesn't mean you can resist going back for another piece in a few minutes...).  **One note: This was very boozy (but good!) the first day, but I think the flavor mellowed a little as it sat; try to make it a day ahead (if you can resist).

Fantastic!  My modifications: I used 3/4 cup Bailey's and 1/4 cup heavy cream, and I and subsituted 2 tbspsoons butterscotch schnapps for half of the Irish cream in the topping.  I also changed the ratios of the topping...I did 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet, which made it stand out more without going all-white.  It set in the freezer in less than an hour and the people at the dinner party I attended devoured it.  It was easy to make, easy to transport, and required no serving dishes, but still impressed people--what could be better?

Very tasty... However I would make some changes next time I make it. First, I would use a 9x12 as opposed 8x8 - these were way too tall to cut through w/o the top layer breaking off. Secondly, I would definitely line my pan with foil instead of buttering it - so, so, so much easier to get out of pan (and a cxlean pan to boot.

When I was ready to start the fudge, I realized that I didn't have any white chocolate chips, so for the base layer, I used 1/2 semi-sweet, and 1/2 milk chocolate chips.  I used all milk chocolate for the top.  I used a few reviewers suggestion not use the full cup of Irish Cream (because they said all Irish Cream made it taste too strong).  I used 3/4 cup Irish Cream, and 1/4 cup of half and half, and found this made the Irish Cream flavor rather mild (even after a day or two).  Also, since previous reviewers said that it made such a thick fudge, I used two(2) 8x8" pans.  It made a fudge that was just shy of 1" thick, which was the perfect thickness.  It was good; I would try this again, but I think I will use the full 1 cup of Irish Cream next time, and make sure I have white chocolate chips next time. :)

This is absolutely wonderful, but I must agree with other reviewers-if you don't like Irish Cream why would you even try this recipe at all(?!) never mind reviewing it. Iused a larger pan which kept the fudge from being so thick.  I reviewed this once before a few years ago and every time since then when I make it at least 5 people ask for the recipe! It mellows and tastes even better with time, however that's only if it sticks around long enough!

This is the best chocolate fudge I've ever had.  I will definately be making this again and again.  Everyone I fed it to loved it as well.  The only problem is that the recipe called for an 8x8 pan when I think it should have been a 9x13 pan.  The fudge was so full in the pan that is was really really hard to cut and get out.  Next time, I will try it in the larger pan.

Yum! Yum!  This recipe makes plenty for an 11x17 pan.  Use a bigger pan, cut it into more pieces; maybe it will last longer!

Delicious!  Made this for the holidays and it disappeared fast....people just kept eating and eating!  The only problem I had was using the 8X8 dish, which resulted in a very thick fudge.  I had problems with it breaking and ending up wasting a lot when cutting it.  Next time, I'll try a 9X9 dish.  Great recipe, very addictive!

I love this fudge! It's isn't like a sickeningly sweet frosting (thank goodness) Mine turned out with the bottom being melt in your mouth delicious, smooth but not what I would call creamy and definitely not crumbly with a very small hint of the Bailey's (left out the nuts) and the other layer turned out a bit semi-hard because I added in extra butter when I saw my mixture not melting the way I expected. So instead of a ganache type topping I got a thin layer of a semi-hard topping with a strong kick of Bailey's! I found I loved the difference in the texture of the layers and the taste of the Bailey's is not overpowering at all. I left my fudge to sit for 2 days in an airtight container in the fridge before eating so I think it got enough time to mellow out the alcohol taste and marry all the different ingredients together. On that note, this fudge does have a bit of a sweet after-kick to it but nothing too extreme. It just keeps calling me back for more. It is wonderful! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

HUGE hit at Book Club last night.  Did not add the nuts since I wanted it to be really smooth like a truffle and it was perfect!

Delicious! I didn't think this was too boozy, as some others had thought. I made it in a 9x13 pan and cut it into probably between 80 - 100 small pieces which were just as satisfying since it's so sweet. I will say that it was difficult to cut though.

DELISH! Have made several times and it always sets up perfectly. I usually make the bottom layer with semi/milk choc and the top all white choc so I can tint it green for fun.

All I can say is it has a wonderful flavor. I didn't find it overpowering at all. I made 3 batches; one as written, one with caramel Baileys, and one with Mint Baileys. They all went over well.

EXCELLENT recipe!! Definitely "cook" this in the microwave--extremely easy and fast and no worries of burning chocolate. The Irish Cream flavor does in fact weaken over time. Absolutely use an 9x13 pan lined with waxed/parchment paper or foil for easy removal.

This is wicked good as the description says!  I have finally found a fudge that me and my family can eat.  Most fudge is so sweet that I don't like it.  This is sweet but not overly so.  Tastes wonderful and is very easy to make.  This is the fudge to make if you are looking for a great recipe.

This fudge really does have a truffle-like consistency! My daughter is a big fan of buttery nipples so I used half irish cream & half butterscotch schnapps. I used all semi-sweet chocolate in the first layer & all white chocolate in the second (because I made this in a 9by13 pan instead of an 8", I increased the white chocolate to 2 cups)...sifting just a bit of cocoa onto the white chocolate layer to jazz it up some. You really are going to want to make this in a larger pan as it was pretty thick even in a 9by13. I didn't think the alchohol taste was overwhelming.... predominant but not overwhelming. It does mellow out some over time. I let this set up most of the way, cut it & then let it finish setting up before pulling it out of the pan....it's easier to cut that way. Thansk for a wonderful candy, Ruth Crickmer!

I used a 9x13 pan, no way this would have fit in my 8x8, and the fudge was thick enough!  As for the taste...... 
Y U M!  This is right up there with my Jack Daniel Brownies!  I will definitely make this fudge again.  Love the irish creme flavor!  I think the fresher the fudge is, the stronger the taste, let it breathe a little, maybe to some the taste won't be so strong, which I didn't think it was myself, but if your a non drinker it might be.  Great recipe!  Thanks Ruth!

This was easy and really awesome fudge. The baileys was not overwhelming - it's just right. I don't have a double boiler so I just melted the chips in the microwave, at half power a couple minutes at a time. The fudge was perfect!!!

Boy this was awesome!  I made it to give as gifts, and everyone loved it.  Next time I might switch to a 9x9 pan to make it not as thick.  It filled my 8x8 pan to the brim.  Delicious!

Everyone raved about this fudge, but I did make some alterations to the recipes.  I decided to keep the white chips separate (to make the fudge look nicer) so I used 4 cups chocolate chips for the base layer and 2 cups white chips for the topping.  I also didn't add nuts at all.  It does make more than a 8x8" pan...I used a 9x11" and it was a good inch thick still.  Nice holiday treat.

This was very rich, but very good!  It definitely made enough for my 11 x 17 pan.  I am somewhere between a 4 & 5 only because I would like to figure out a way to make it less rich.  Anyway, it was good enough to make again!

This fudge is awesome. The top truffle layer is the best. I'm almost tempted to make just that. my kids weren't wild about this fudge but anyone that likes baileys will love it.

Sorry, this needs another name.  It is not at all creamy like one would expect fudge to be.  The flavor is fine, but it is not the expected consistency.  It is dry, and very rich, almost like eating a chocolate bar, but sweeter. 4.5 stars is generous for this recipe.

Very good and very rich. I followed the recipe and then used a 9X13 and the fudge was still more than an inch thick. One problem encountered was that the recipe for the second layer was not enough for the surface area and I couldn't spread it out to cover all of it. Perhaps 1.5 the top layer ingredients and you'll be fine.

Not good at all!  I made this for a St. Patty's Day party and it was barely touched.  The 8x8 pan is way too small.  Also, the "layers" are not necessary.  All they did was make it crumble when I tried to dig it out of the pan.  The consistency was not fudgy either.  Definitely a waste of some good Irish Cream.

Wonderful!!  Instead of straight Irish Cream, I used 1/4 Cup Irish Cream and 3/4 Cup Butterscotch Schnopps in the bottom layer, thus creating a "Slippery Nipple" or "Buttery Nipple" fudge (although next time I will probably use 1/2 Cup of each).  I also omitted the nuts.  I made the top layer the way the recipe reads.  I used a larger pan, probably 9x16 or so.  Next time I will at least double the recipe for the top layer.  My husband, who does not like fudge (not a plain chocolate fan) liked this, as did my coworkers and friends.  Will definately make this again!

Oh my goodness is this delicious and easy!  My lady friends all took some home and asked for the recipe.  I used all white chocolate for the top layer, just for looks (I can never leave a recipe alone).  I thought that this might be good with Kahula instead of the Irish Cream - just for fun -next time.

If you are in a hurry, this is even great without the top layer.  THE TRICK TO MAKING IT CREAMY use an immersion blender when it is almost melted.  Mine was as perfect as any time consuming fussy fudge.

If you love Bailey’s, you’ll love this creamy and delicious fudge.   The Bailey’s doesn’t get lost in the chocolate flavor, but doesn’t overwhelm it either.  I lined the pan with parchment paper instead of buttering the pan.  Instead of a double boiler, I used the microwave which made it quick and easy.  This is a keeper.

Awesome recipe! Followed recipe for bottom layer but for top layer used 1/2 cup each semisweet, milk, and white chocolate. Used whole amount of Irish Cream stated in recipe. It does taste a little strong at first but mellows out by next day. I also used my hand mixer on the bottom layer when adding powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until very creamy. this was much quicker and easier than stirring and also made the fudge much creamier. I used the hand mixer on top layer also and used a rubber spatula to smooth top layer on and it turned out beautiful. Put in refrig for 10 minutes then sliced into bite sized pieces and returned pan to refrig for another couple hours. If you do this you should not have trouble cutting the fudge when hard. I also used a 9 x 9 pan which worked perfectly.

This fudge is FABULOUS! It does take a lot of work to make it, it is but well worth it. It is very dense, the truffle part is light and smooth and the fudge part is rich and VERY CHOCOLATEY! And you can really taste the Bailey's! All I can say is WOW! I could not believe I made this, and that it was SOO GOOD! I am posting it on my Facebook and emailing it to all my friends. A MUST TRY!

Made this recipe as is for my fiance's parents' annual St. Patty's Day Party.  This recipe made a TON of fudge and it was wonderful - creamy and smooth, but did it ever pack a punch with all the liqueur!  You took your first bite and when you inhaled you could feel the fumes!  Most of the people at the party (grown-ups) liked it, but several people couldn't eat a whole piece because it was too strong, and it is DEFINITELY not for sharing with the little ones.  Next time, I will try using maybe 1/2 cup of Irish cream and 1/2 cup of regular cream to make the flavor a little more gentle.  I don't want to mess with the consistency, because that was just perfect, but it may need to be toned down just a little...

I personally didn't enjoy this fudge very much. The alcohol was way too overpowering and just too sweet. My mother-in-law made her yearly batch of Christmas fudge (made with marshmallows) which was just sooooo much better. I will try to get a hold of her recipe and post it. I'm sorry, I wish I could give this a better review, I just think it needs some work.

I have made this recipe every christmas for the last 3 years. While I love the taste of it I find it very difficult to stir. When I put the semi-sweet morsels,white morsels and the butter together it gets like a brick. I need to have my husband stir it. The first time I made it I threw it out because I thought it had seized up on the double boiler from some water getting in it. I redid the recipe and it did the same thing so I just had my husband stir it and we continued on. I have tried with the double boiler and with melting them in the microwave and it doesn't matter it still is hard. I've read this sites comments but I don't see anyone else complaining about this. Does anyone have any idea of why this is happening or does this happen to everyone? Any Ideals to help this problem?  I also just finished making it for this year and I had difficulty incorporating the butter in the top layer it had a lot of melted butter that I had to soak up- it seemed to separate. Any ideals on why this happened? Thanks for your help in advance. I do like this for the holidays and would like for this to be easier. Everyone have a Happy and safe holiday!

This makes a VERY dense fudge.  It filled my 8X8 pan to the top.  Next time, I will put in a 9x13 pan.  It was difficult to cut such a thick fudge, but once out of the fridge for 4 hours, I managed to cut through.  I don't like nuts in my fudge, so I made both the top and bottom in one and that worked just fine.  DEFINITELY use a mixer to mix this together.  I also don't own a double boiler and it did fine as long as I kept my eye on it all.  The amount of Irish Cream really strikes everyone differently ... I brought it to a holiday party for work and some said it was quite strong, others thought it was perfect.  (Contrary to what others said, I think the flavor gets a little stronger after 3 days.)  Really a good fudge and quite easy to make.  (WITH A MIXER)  Thanks!

I say three stars because the flavor was great...the liquor REALLY came thru, yay!...but the texture didn't seem quite right to me. I think I prefer my fudge to be a little more, what...crumbly? sandy?  I don't know exactly.  This recipe really just came out like a re-hardened pan of melted chocolate, and I totally accept the blame if it lies with my method.  Follow everyone's advice and line your pan with foil, and use an 11x7 inch pan, or your fudge (aka: dense brick of chocolate with booze) will be two inches tall.

This was another recipe for which I'm glad I waited to rate.  I would've originally given it 4 stars.  I'm partial to the Million Dollar Fudge recipe - also on this site.  The Irish Creme didn't seem strong at all like some others had mentioned.  In fact, it seemed too weak in my opinion.  However, after having some the next day I totally changed my mind.  It was perfect!  The flavor was perfect and the texture was just as good as the other recipe I mentioned.  Definitely make this recipe ahead of time to give the flavors a chance to blend for perfect, rich, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.

Wow! This was a big hit at a holiday party we attended this weekend. I followed directions but altered a couple of things. For the bottom layer, I substituted 2 cups of Girardelli milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet, and then added 1 cup Girardelli (when the main focus of a dessert is chocolate, I prefer to use a higher quality) semi-sweet and then the white chocolate as directed. For the top, I used only (girardelli) dark chocolate chips to give the layers a distinct color difference. Lastly, I used Kahlua in the top layer rather than the Irish cream, just do to the fact I think they are good flavors together in drinks. :) You could definitely taste the Irish cream, but if you couldn't, why choose this specific recipe for fudge? Oh, and I used the 9x13 pan, but I did increase the top dark chocolate layer a bit so the fudge was still thick as I agree it should be. The end result was a wonderful creamy fudge that people raved about. It's going to the next holiday party this coming weekend! Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous and easy! I used 4 cups of semi-sweet chocolate for the bottom layer and 1 ½ cups of white chocolate for the top layer. Tint the top layer green for St. Patty’s Day! Everybody just loves this fudge- great recipe.

This recipe was really easy to make!  I would probably decrease the amount of alcohol to at least 3/4 of a cup.  I thought was quite strong.  My mom however loved it.  I thinks she just got buzzed. LOL  I would make again with less alcohol.  Enjoy!!!

I started making this fudge about 3 years ago and it is AWESOME!!!  I usually spread it out into a large baking sheet because it is ALOT and it is very rich!  I also omit the nuts and add  a little extra booze for good measure!  Like I said it is really rich so a small piece is really all you need, but then a minute later you'll find yourself wondering back over for another...

Very good.  Everyone loved it.  I thought the Irish cream was very easy to detect.  Other people asked, "does this have bailey's in it?" so it seemed to be a good balance of the flavor.  The texture was great, too.  I just melted the stuff for the last layer in the microwave all together rather than on the double boiler and it turned out fine.  I put it on for a minute, stired and then I think for another minute or so.

THis was made by a friend of mune for an IRish themed party...sooooo decadent!
This is the type of fudge that is soo smooth and the warmth from the IRish Cream was great!  Not for kids!!!!
We excluded the nuts to appeal to everyone.

Fantastic. Followed the directions exactly except left out the nuts. Makes a TON of very thick fudge. When I make it again, I'll either half the basic recipe (and leave the topping the same), or use a bigger pan.

A great recipe that is great with any liquer (I used Godiva White Chocolate Liquer).  Per other suggestions, I made this in a 9x13 pan and made the "base" with all dark chips and then layered the top with all white.  Delish and a great presentation for gifts!

Needs adjusting the liquer - way too strong, even for some of my friends who are fans of Irish Creme liquer.

I made this as a trial to add to my Christmas treat trays and I was disappointed. I too make the homemade Irish Cream from this site and while that stuff is absolutely heavenly - its flavor is lost in this recipe. I found you couldn't taste it and the overall fudge was exceedingly rich. I think if I tried this again I would use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. It was easy though and I put mine in mini-muffin tins instead of a pan and that worked out quite well.

This tasted OK, but the second layer is not necessary, since it didn't really stand out.  Also, the use of white chocolate is what caught my attention, but it you can't taste it in the end.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It is pretty easy to make and everyone loves it!  I have made it for the last two years at Christmas and get requests for it all the time.  The Irish Cream gives it a kick, but is not overwhelming.  My nephews and nieces eat it up:)

This is a great and easy fudge recipe! Made fudge the first time using this and one other recipe and it turned out great! I did not have a double boiler so I just used a pan on the stove over medium heat. Also did half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate as someone else wrote...since I don't love dark chocolate taste! Great one to make for adults!

This is by far the BEST fudge recipe! Since finding it it has become a family favorite and all other fudge recipes have been forgotten from our cookbooks. Family and friends ask about it every Christmas season and when giving it out the recipe is always requested.

Wow.. I just made these and they're great!  I was thinking they wouldn't taste enough like the irish cream, but alas, I was wrong. Although, I don't really understand all this "double boiler" business in this recipe (as well as others on this site that use melted chocolate) - you can EASILY microwave chocolate.  For semi-sweet chocolate chips microwave on high, in one minute intervals, stirring after each minute (the amount in this recipe took my powerful microwave two minutes).  White chocolate seems to melt slightly quicker, I suggest 30 second intervals to be safe.  In this recipe, I mixed the white and the semi-sweet and micro'd it in the usual one minute intervals, adding the butter for the last 30 seconds.   Gawgeous!

Will never make another fudge recipe again.  I also added a stick of butter (instead of the 1/4 cup) to the initial batch of chocolate chips which makes it creamy (not crumbly at all) and since I was making it for the kids, omitted the baileys and just used milk.  Am glad I used parchment paper to line the 8x8 so it was super simple to pull out of the pan and cut.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

To die for!!!  If you don't like alcohol though, don't try this recipe, because the alcohol taste does come through a bit.  But to me and everyone else at my house, this was fabulous!  I didn't make the topping because it looked basically like the same as the bottom layer, and I also used a mix of dark chocolate and semisweet chocolate instead of white.  This was soooo easy, took 5 mins, and I  will definately make this again!

OH yes...This is very good! I did the half butter shots half Irish cream version. I also put crushed nuts on the top instead of the topping. Be sure you press the nuts down with the plastic wrap, though.

I have had nothing but rave reviews on this fudge since I delivered it to my co-workers this Christmas! Yikes! So many tongues have the taste for the Irish Creme!  I  used one stick of butter instead of the 1/4 cup called for and it made this fudge creamy and melt-away! Yummy!

Absolutely, positively FANTASTIC fudge recipe. I did only semisweet chips for the bottom layer and white chocolate chips for the top layer. Covered the whole thing with red, white and green sprinkles for Christmas. Will definitely be adding this to my Christmas repertoire!

Wow! It's one of these recipes when you are absolutely sure everyone will love it. Very easy, I just microwaved the chocolate which made it fuss free and I also used only white choc for the top layer and added a bit of Coffee liqueur. Thank you, it looks and tastes amazing!

This one gets raves in my house!!   I'm not a fudge fan but I do enjoy a taste or two of this recipe.   My husband is the fudge expert and says "it's the best".  I give it as gifts and people will comment on how creamy this fudge is.  We could experience a nice Irish Cream flavor. For those who do not like such a strong flavor I recommend making your own Irish Cr. with less whiskey than called for as I have learned to do.  (There are some great recipes on this site for Irish Cr.)

This is terrific recipe. Those that say it is too strong liquer wise obviously are "BORN AGAIN" non drinkers. I could not taste anything but the Irish Creme flavor. I also favor the 8X8 dish, as I think fudge should be thick.

I took most of the other reviewers advice and used a 13 X 9 inch pan.  The thickness was perfect. Geez, I can't imagine all of that fudge in an 8 X 8 - that must be very tall. Anyways, I thought the recipe was ok.  Not bad but not terrific.  The texture was not gritty but it was not extremely creamy either. You really can't differentiate between the fudge layer and the topping layer - it looks the same and tastes the same to me.  After sitting for a day, the alcohol flavor definitely intensified. I put out the whole platter of fudge at my office and maybe 2 out of 15 people raved about it.  I make fudge often and I have some fine fudge recipe but I don't think I'd bother to make this again - mostly because Irish Cream is so expensive.  Well, I bought the Bailey's brand - maybe another brand would be less expensive.  I guess if you are crazy about Irish Cream - then this would be a rockin good choice for you!

This was delicious, although I made some modifications.  I took everyone's advice and made the fudge in a 9x13 pan; omitted the nuts; melted the chips over low heat in a pan rather than the double boiler and I whipped up a buttercream frosting with lots of Irish cream in it and spread that over the top.  Yummy!

All I have to say is YUMMY! Just thinking about the fudge makes me want a piece. 
I made this treat for the girls at work and I brought not one piece home with me. Note: I made the fudge 2 days in advance and the strong irish cream taste seemed to lessen by the time I took it to work.

Excellent and potent!  I spent hours preparing goodies for gift baskets, but this particular fudge kept disappearing before it made it into any basket.  It seems that both my mother and my husband were snatching a few pieces every time I turned my back.  I would have to say this fudge has been quite a success.

EXCELLENT. Very smooth & creamy. May try next time using all white chocolate chips, or using 3c white chocolate to 1c semisweet chocolate for truffle. Would still keep topping as recipe calls for.

Don't bother making anything else. 
This is the only one I make now. I
don't bother with the topping step.
This fudge should be illegal. Not
for kids-or people you don't like..

My family and friends wouldn't stop eating this wonderful fudge long enough for it to get into the holiday gift baskets I was trying to prepare.  A sure winner by the rave reviews I kept getting-even by supposed non-fudge eaters! YUM! YUM!

This is absolutely fantastic - It was really easy to make and the fudge tastes superb - and I don't normally like fudge.  I will make it again without hesitation.

Excellent.  I would bet that "GEORGEWASHINGTON" used granulated sugar, not powdered sugar, and if you use the right sugar, it is very smooth.

I was hesitant to make this recipe after reading some of the reviews.  I'm glad I went ahead and made it.  Its very rich and taste like baileys, which I'm ok with.  I followed some recommendations, and used the microwave instead of the double boiler. I heated in small increments, and added about 1/3 of baileys towards the last heating, then the rest once warmed/melted through.  I also warmed the baileys slightly (like 10-15 seconds) before adding it to the chocolate. I did not use foil, I buttered an 11x13 pan.  I let it set for about 30 mins, brought it out to cut, left it in the pan and let set for another couple of hours in fridge.  I did not cover with plastic to get it smooth, I used a plastic scraper instead and it worked well, and made it shiny.

It is not your typical fudge process/recipe, hence the truffle in the name.  It tastes and has a smooth texture like I would expect in a truffle.  No one has tried it yet, but if I get some bad feedback from my taste testers, I will update...

This fudge is awesome - Every time I make it, it turns out perfectly.  I have tried many fudge recipes over the years and this recipe, by far, is the easiest and always turns out amazing.  Everyone who has tried it, loved it.  Every other fudge recipe I have made has either flopped or didn't harden, etc... but this one is great and turns out fantastic every time - LOVE the Irish Cream in it!

Wow, this is sooooo good! Very rich and creamy.  I was a little afraid to use all the irish cream as a lot of the comments said it was too strong. But i used it all and I'm glad I did. To me, it had just the right amount of irish cream flavour I made this exactly as directed and that is the way I will make it again, which will be soon the way I am going through it.

These were really good. Ultra rich and "Irish" creamy! (sorry I couldn't help myself!)  If you love Irish Cream flavor than this is the fudge for you! Thanks so much for the recipe.

Great recipe. I first made this 3 years ago and it has become a must-have at Christmas. It is a bit boozy for the first couple of days but the flavor mellows after a couple of days. This recipe freezes well also. I cleaned out the deep-freeze and found some from the first batch I made in 2006 and it tasted great - not burned or dried out.

Delicious!! This fudge got rave reviews from my entire family.  It was a bit crumbly at first--I recommend letting it warm to room temperature before slicing. Consistency and flavor are even better today than they were 4 days ago. I highly recommend this recipe!

Good fudge. I cut the Baily's back to 2/3 Cup, and you can still taste the liquor. And if you want to make the colors contrast more, change the ratio for the upper layer to mostly white chocolate chips, or mostly regular.  I used pecans, all I had.  Very good!

My husband and I REALLY enjoyed this recipe. I was doubtful at first making this treat for a holiday cookie exchange after I  read some of the reviews. We made it and found it to be very creamy and not too strong on the irish cream. Both layers of this fudge were easy to spread in the pan. The only drawback we found was that it needs to be kept chilled or it gets soft quickly at room temperature. We used a 9x12 pan and it was a perfect thickness. I also took the advice of another reviewer and lined the baking dish with aluminum foil. How easy it was to get out and cut!!! Also, since I have a small double boiler, after I melted the chips and butter, I put the mixture into a saucepan on low heat to add the confectioner sugar and irish cream to mix. It was much easier and creamier. Instead of using just semi-sweet chips, I used half semi-sweet chips and half milk chocolate chips. It mellowed the bitterness. The last change I made was using 3/4 cup irish cream and a 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of the full cup of irish cream. This recipe has already made it into my holiday repetoire for years to come!!! A must have fudge recipe. Friends and family have already eaten all of the extras!!!

This fudge was creamy with an awesome, somewhat strong, Irish Cream flavor.  It's amazing how the reviews are so mixed!  The layers were not as obvious as I thought they would be, but who cares.  It didn't last long enough for anyone to notice.  It was a huge hit!

It was okay.  It set up like a nice fudge, but the taste wasn't 5 star.  Better than typical "easy" fudge.

The 2nd layer needs some more irish cream to be able to spread properly on top of the first layer. I substituted 3 cups of white chips for the semi-sweet on the first layer (so it was 4 cups of white on the first layer) and did the opposite on the 2nd layer (so that it was 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chips). 2nd layer wasn't spreadable, but that was probably my fault because I switched the type of chips. Taste was delicious nonetheless. Could've just made the top layer and it would've been enough even in an 9x18 pan for straight Irish Cream fudge.

Never have I had coworkers rave this much about a holiday dessert...it does pack a punch -- the irish cream liqueur lingers quite a while, while at the same time preserving a bit of the freshness of the fudge.  I will definitely make this again!

I think this is a great recipe and it was easy to make.  I didn't use nuts and I only made the bottom layer because I didn't need as many servings, but everyone really liked it.  The first night after I made it, it was a little strong on the Irish Cream flavor, but the next morning it was better.  I actually used 3/4 cup Irish Cream and 1/4 chocolate liquor.
Thank you.

This turned out sooo tasty!  I took the advice of others and lined the pan so that I could remove the fudge to cut it.  It crumbled a wee bit when I cut it so perhaps I didn't pack it down as well as I should have.  I will take a bit more care pressing it into the pan next time I make it (and there will be a next time in the near future) ... hopefully that resolves the crumbling issue!  Makes me wonder what other liqueurs I could try in this recipe.

I'm not a big fan of fudge, but I thought I would try and make some for Christmas to give as gifts for teachers and I wanted to try the recipes ahead of time.  This fudge I really, really liked.  I thought the texture was great.  Not too rich, nice and creamy.  I did however, think the alcohol was a little strong and I love Baileys, so I'm not sure how others would like it.  And mix I didn't mix it enough. However, I did notice the alcohol taste isn't as strong after a couple of days.  I would definately recommend it and I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm now going to try the other recipe "million dollar fudge" on this site and see how that is.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I used all semi-sweet chocolate for the bottom layer and all white chocolate for the top layer.  Liquor taste was too strong, so I might try again with a reduced amount.  I didn't have any problem with the texture.

This turned out good.  I would have mixed the Bailey's in better.  There were times you would bite into a piece and it would taste so much like Bailey's and slightly bitter and other times it would taste sweeter.  If you don't like super sweet fudge, this recipe is for you.  The Bailey's lightens up the sweetness of the fudge.

This recipe turned out awesome.  I grew up with Mackinac Island fudge from Northern Michigan and I think this stuff is every bit as good, maybe better.  It comes out thick, but smooth and creamy.  Warning, it can be very difficult to cut into squares.  I don't use the term thick lightly!  Your pan will be heavy!

Wonderful texture for this fudge. I made it for a holiday party and it was gobbled up. The irish cream was a little strong for my liking, but other people loved it, so that is all that matters!

Plan to give some away, or you will end up eating it all!  This is fabulous.  I made a batch for a church talent/craft auction, and let samples sit out.  It went VERY well!  It made about 3 1/2 pounds, but disappeared so quick.  I did use a jelly roll pan (10.5" x 15.5") so it wasn't too thick (or thin), I think it was perfect.  This is an excellent recipe, and very easy too.  I plan to make another batch or two for Christmas gift bags for family and friends.  One last note, other than the pan size I followed the recipe exactly and didn't find the Irish Cream too overpowering.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, what a sin this is!  This is smooth, delectible and utterly awesome.  I highly recommend this.  Never had any fudge that was this good.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I think I have a new tradition in our family.  Merry Christmas!

I made this fudge today to give as a gift.  The person I made it for is a non -drinker so substituted Irish cream flavored coffee creamer and it turned out great.   This fudge has a really smooth creamy texture.  I will definately make this again.

Very good recipe.  I cut the recipe in half, didn't use the nuts and did all semi sweet on the bottom and all white on the top.  Very good taste, but not as creamy as I like.

This was good but rich.  Its hard to eat a lot of it. I am not sure if the cooking time is adequate to remove the alcohol so it probably is not suitable for children.  A good adult recipe idea for St. Patricks day though.

It was an excellent fudge and very easy to make.  I did make the fudge in an 8x8 pan because I like thick fudge, but next time will definitely use 9x13 pan.  I also took the advice of some other reviewers and used more white chocolate chips for the top, but did not get a drastic difference in color, however I am not sure if that is due to using European semi-sweet chocolate or not.  I took the fudge to a Christmas party and everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

I really like this fudge! I didn't think mine would set up. It took about 3 hrs. as opposed to the 1-2hrs stated. It is very good and with time, will probably be better (if there is any left to be able to tell by then) I opted not to use the nuts as I wanted a creamy fudge. Made half a batch and used the 8x8" pan. I would like it thicker though unlike many reviewers so I would use a smaller pan if making half a batch next time. I can't wait to try Amaretto in this fudge.

It was okay.  Not as creamy as other fudges I have made.  Some people said that the flavour was good, but no one liked the drier texture.  One person said that it had a more dark chocolate taste to it, even though I used the same semisweet chips that I use in my other recipes.  Maybe the addition of the white chocolate gave it that taste.  I didn't make any substitutions.  I probably won't try this again.

I am sorry for the confusion about the 'green' color-I added a little green food coloring to the frosting-hence the color!  I have made this recipe many more times since I first reviewed it-both 'green' and not--and I always get many requests for the recipe.

I ended up throwing this out. The sugar never dissolved, even after I returned the finished fudge to a saucepan to cook it some more. It was grainy and unpleasant.

This is a great fudge recipe.  I made it for a St. Patty's Day party and it was a BIG hit.  NOTE:  There is a recipe for homemade Irish Cream in the appetizer section that sounds pretty easy.  Might be worth a try for this fudge.

Oh my, I absolutely love this fudge! It is such a different type of fudge than what is usually on a Christmas candy plate and so easy to make. Too strong? I don't think so, but remember, you are not cooking the alcohol out so it will be strong. I have found that the longer it sits the more mellow it will get. So if you can stay out of it (I can't??) it won't be as strong -tasting. 
Will be making this with the salted caramel liqueur this year.
Will definitely enjoy.

Very easy to make.  Very rich.  I've used some flavored Irish Creams for a little different taste, like mint or caramel.

As recommended by others I double the top layer... And I cheat, I microwave the chocolate. I get rave reviews every year.

Full disclosure; I did not make the original recipe as-is.  I read through other reviews first and made some adjustments...but it turned out FABULOUS!  For the first step, I used a hand mixer right in my double boiler, and mixed the  chocolates and butter until it was well mixed and smooth.  Next, added the sugar and Bailey's and continued to mix until it was nice and smooth again.  I added the nuts, mixing by hand, and then poured into my prepared pan.  The pan I used was a 9x12" and lined with a sheet of aluminum foil leaving several inches hanging out on the ends.  It made it amazingly easy to just lift the whole thing out onto a cutting board, once set.  Peeled the foil off, then cut.  East peasy!  For the topping, I used about 2 cups of white chocolate morsels, and about 3/4 cup of semi sweet.  So, basically swapping the amounts, and adding a tad bit more to make up for the larger pan.  I removed from heat as in the directions, but then also mixed the topping with my hand mixer until nice and smooth.  SO YUMMY!  This is a keeper!

Excellent! So very happy with it. I did use a bigger dish 8 X 11, CAREFULLY melted chocolate in Microwave not stove top, used Fireball Whiskey instead of Irish Cream, per reviewers suggestion, used  3/4 C. liqueur  and 1/4 C. heavy cream for 1st half. Delicious, thank you!!

I found this recipe easy to make, and the directions clear. 
 If I was to make it again, I may opt for a microwave, rather then melting in a double boiler.  I found the flavouring very, strong.  I will have to come up with a way to reduce the liquor while maintaining the liquid ratio.  I also think that if I was to make this again, I would line the ban with parchment paper.  It does make more then a 8x8 pan though.  If you can get over the strong flavour the rest of it is quite good.

After reading some reviews I made the fudge using the ingredients as written. The only changes I made was melting the chocolate in the microwave as one of the reviewers suggested & then using a 9x9 pan. This is a very light fudge & everyone liked it. Definitely make again.

Excellent fudge.  Extremely smooth and wonderful flavor.  Only thing I did differently was to use the microwave.

I read quite a few reviews first. I used a 11x13 pan (foiled-lined, a must!) This made a lot of candy! I thought it was the right thickness, as well (about a 110 1-inch squares!) I used the microwave method for melting chocolate and it worked perfectly. I used good quality Irish Cream and did not think it was too strong (my husband heartily agreed!). The only difficulty I had was in spreading the top layer - using the larger pan, the top layer was a little thinner than I would have liked and as it began cooling it became harder to spread. Otherwise, we loved this fudge and will definitely make it again!

I have made this as part of my Christmas candy gift boxes for the last two years, and it's a huge hit! I love the way Irish cream and chocolate work together.

My only suggestion is to make this in a 9"x13" pan (you may want to make a little extra "icing" to get a good thick layer). Otherwise, the fudge pieces are really really thick and are difficult to cut.

A little strong on the Irish cream. I may try this again with milk chocolate  in place of semi sweet.

This is a fantastic fudge recipe. A fudge for grown-ups that is supple in the mouth and delivers amazing Irish Cream flavor. I didn't do the layered approach, I just did it all with nuts and it turned out great! I ran out, so I went back and made it again but without the nuts and it was delicious as well. A+ in my book!

The flavour was good but the texture was gritty from the icing sugar. Everyone else loved it but I wish it'd been more 'traditional' in texture. Will probably make again since the flavour was so yummy.

This was sooooo good!  Everyone was crazy about it.  An important note: I only made the first part of the recipe and it made A TON.  After the adding of the Irish Cream, I stirred it and put it into the pan and called it: "good."  No need to bust the double-boiler out a second time.  This filled a whole large pie pan almost to the brim!

Good, but really too rich to eat more than a tiny bit. Also a huge pain to cut into pieces - sets hard as rocks. I omitted the nuts, however, and the mixing gets a little difficult the more sugar you add. A second person may be required to get the job done without pulling muscles in one's arm.

Every Saint Patricks Day I am requested to bring this.  I leave out the nuts since it is a large party and you never no when a nut allergy may pop up. I don't use a double boiler I just use the microwave direction to melt chocolate off the Nestles package. Plus I am extra generous with the Irish Cream!

This recipe had wonderful flavor (don't change any ingredients in the recipe!), but I didn't like the fact that it softened when at room temperature.  I couldn't serve this, and kept having to refrigerate it, yet if I forgot about it and left it in the refrigerator too long, I couldn't cut it without it crumbling everywhere.  Maybe it needs some parrafin?  I'm not sure, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

I've made this fudge for 3 Christmas holidays now and every time it's a hit! I make it without nuts, and it's still the most popular thing I've ever taken to work! Easy to make and yummy!!! I also add a little more Irish cream and it helps to ease the sweet in the chocolate.

This fudge was a great hit with my co-workers.  I recieved many requests for the recipe, and the office was a cheerier place that afternoon :-)

Delicious! A bit on the strong side, but I think that it really works with this recipe. I will definitely make these again.

AMAZING fudge as it is! Personally wouldn't change a thing; it's worth the calorie count, and it will be replacing my old fudge recipe this christmas.

Oh so rich.  I too agree that there is a bit too much liquer.   I also had a problem getting all of the butter to incorporate and was very skeptical that it would actually turn out creamy.  However, it turned out very creamy!  I did have to sop up the excess butter using a paper towel (while warm) and had to scrape off cooled butter later, which of course just affected how it looked, but a bit of a pain.

This recipe was seriously delicious! The only problem I am having (and I am hoping someone can give me advice) is when I cut it, the top layer seems to seperate from the bottom layer so I get more crumbled pieces of fudge. Am I not melting it enough?

I found this fudge really rich.The kids really didn't get excited over it like I thought they would. I also found it impossible to stir with the amount of liquid it called for, I didn't add enought extra so I ended up with a very hard to cut and crumbly fudge. I will try it again but will alter the recipe.

Delicious!  I made this for a family gathering on St. Patrick's Day - I subbed all semi-sweet on the bottom layer, and all white on the top, adding a hefty dose of green food coloring to it.  Looked awesome, and tasted great.  Everyone loved it!  I made it for Easter, and swirled purple, yellow, and pink in the white chocolate.  :)

I made this for a superbowl party and it was a big success. I went with half and half with the semi/milk because I like it a bit sweeter. I also threw a couple of whole white chocolate chips on the top for visual interest. I also used mint-flavored irish cream and thought it had a good flavor. Next time I might experiment with doing all white, or an all white topping so I can color it to match the holiday. Very very yummy...

Wow, this is good!  I followed the recipe except for using a jelly-roll pan to yield thinner, smaller pieces.  I'm glad I did, as this is very rich.  I cut the fudge into tiny squares to serve.  I also switched the ratio of the white/dark chocolate for the topping.  Will definitely make this again next Christmas.  Thanks.

I like this but it is so rich that we can only eat small pieces and so it lasts forever. I would prefer a fudge that is not so strongly flavored and perhaps more creamy than mine turned out. I will try making again with less Irish Cream and maybe more nuts, just to try and balance out the rich denseness somewhat.

Make this fudge you will not be let down! Was easy to make and  was a big hit. The family loved it. I used half regular irish cream and half caramel flavor its all i had left in the house, you could definitely taste it!!

Absolutely the best.  I have made this two years in a row and my family raves about it.  I use a 1/2 sheet cake pan lined with parchment, and this makes it super easy to cut and wrap.  Be sure to add the amount of irish cream it calls for.  I actually add a little more - it is wonderful.  Also, you might want to check out the IRISH CREAM recipe on this site - it is super good.

Very good!  I agree with the hassle of double boiler.  Microwave would work just as well.  Next time I will omit the butter in the topping.  No need for it, and it made it too greasy.   Great tast.

I substituted a 1/4 c. of butter in place of 1/4 c. of Bailey's.. big mistake. According to many reviews, the fudge tasted very booze-y, so I used less alcohol. When I was done, the fudge really smelled like Irish Cream, but the next morning when I wen to cut it, it neither tasted nor smelled like Irish Cream... disappointing. And I don't really care for alcohol, so I don't know what happened. Wasn't as creamy as I'd like. I'd give this recipe a 3.5 if I hadn't messed with the proportions.

This is definately a 5-star recipe.  I used it in my first attempt at making fudge, and it turned out beautiful and delicious.  I took it for food day and received many rave reviews.
The only thing I would change is to line the pan next time (had to set bottom of pan in shallow sink of warm water for a couple minutes.) And maybe a bigger pan, as it is thick (but oh, so good!)

Made this yesterday for one of my husband's Treat Days at work.  What a hit!  Because some of the cooks had suggested reducing the Irish Cream, i used 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup 1/2 & 1/2.  Totally unnecessary. Next time i will use the full cup.    Other than that, it was amazing and i can only say that if you're not getting desired results, you might evaluate the quality of your ingredients.

When I first made this it tasted really boozy so I was worried.  Even the next day it was still pretty strong but everyone who likes Irish Cream really liked it.  I noticed that after 2-3 days, the flavor really mellowed and I thought it was fantastic as well as my husband who doesn't like Bailey's at all.  I would recommend lining the dish with plastic wrap before pouring in the mixture as it was pretty difficult to cut in the dish, especially the first pieces.

Fantastic! The only change I'll make the next time is to prepare it in a 9X13" pan.  I made it in an 8-1/2" square pan and it was a little thick.

I substituted green mint chips for the white chocolate and used mint Irish cream liqueur in place of the regular Irish cream.  The only other thing I would do different is either line the pan with foil or use a cardboard or foil cooking square that could be cut away.  I gave it to several people as a homemade gift.  It was excellant and well received.

Great taste but poor consistency.  These crumbled and were impossible to remove from pan.  Might be fine for some family "picking" but not for guests.

This is the absolute best fudge I have ever tasted.  I put it in the freezer to keep for Christmas and I had to take it over to my neighbors house because I couldn't stay out of it!  The flavor is just perfect.  I will be making this many times a year!!

This was a really good fudge I think it just had too much "bite" for my husband and I. I plan on bringing it to class on monday and divying it out to my classmates. I want to try it again with about 1/2 c irish cream and 1/2 c evaporated milk or sweetened evaporated milk. And changing the semisweet/white portions because I think it was a little too dark for my taste. All in all, if this is what you like, it is a WONDERFUL recipe! The texture was as good if not better than candy store bought fudge!

Easy to make and well-liked. I heeded the advice of previous reviewers and used a 9 X 13 pan, perfect size. Next time I will use all white chips for the topping (maybe tint it green for St. Pat's Day). I will also try this recipe with Kahlua some time. Thanks.

Yummmm -- This recipe was delicious and super easy.  I halved the recipe and it worked great in an 8x8" pan.  I also took someone's advice and used only white chips for the top layer, just for looks.  Not too "boozy," at least if you like the flavor of irish cream.

This was a hit with many friends. I thought the taste was too strong. My batch was also difficult to cut - I'd recommend a larger size pan.

I liked this very much. My neighbor said it was the best fudge she ever tasted. I would cut back on the alcohol though to 3/4 C it was still a little too strong for me a day later.

As fudge goes, this recipe was great.  Everyone thought so even though my family aren't big fudge eaters.  For the previous reviewer, I have no idea what the other person was talking about regarding the green color.  This fudge looks like fudge.  It is dark brown.

I made this recipe today thinking I would 'get ahead' on my Christmas baking but it has all been eaten already (!) so I am making a triple batch tomorrow! WOW is it GOOD. The ease of preparation makes it simple AND elegant-the green color makes it perfect for a Christmas buffet table. Try this.  Thank you for sharing.
