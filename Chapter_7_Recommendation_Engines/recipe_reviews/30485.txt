This was pretty good if you don't mind something a little different.  This won't take the place of traditional chicken salad in our house.  I really debated between the 3 or 4 stars, but in the end I really did like it, just don't think I'll be making it when I'm wanting a chicken salad sandwich.  My husband also liked it, but asked that I please make my usual chicken salad next time.  I used a little less onion than called for, but that is personal preference as I don't care for dishes with a strong onion taste.  The grilled onion was actually very good in this and gave it a slight sweet taste and crunch.  Overall a mixed review.  While we both acually enjoyed it, it won't be an everyday thing for us.  Maybe next time I'm in the mood for "something different".

I DID NOT GRILL MY CHICKEN. I USED LEFTOVER CHICKEN..ADDED A SPLASH OF LEMON JUICE, A BIT OF FAT FREE ITALIAN DRESSING. I USED MY GEORGE FOREMAN TO GRILL THE MUSHROOMS AND ONIONS. OVERALL I THINK IT TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD.

My Husband and I do not grill in the winter. We only had three chicken breasts. The chicken cooked nicely in a cast iron skillet and then we set it aside to brown the vegetables (in the skillet)...both were cooked in olive oil and we drained well before putting it in with the mayonnaise mixture. The onion used was "Mayan Sweets" purchased at Walmart. Neither of us can have soy, so we used a canola-based mayo. Tabasco was used for the hot sauce. The mixture had a very nice color. We served this salad between toasted English muffins which made for a great taste....I would recommend chopping tiny if done this way (messy). If chopped small, one might be able to do an open-faced sandwich on English muffins. The amount of sauce was perfect-not always easy to get by following the recipe for a chicken,tuna,etc. salad. It tasted great served a little warm-we were hungry and couldn't wait to eat it. I would serve this to guests (with or without some sort of bread) and that is saying a lot about my confidence in this dish as many of our guests have very conservative palates. We usually score dishes out of 10...this got a 9.

Maybe I didn't grill the onions enough because the onions were overpowering in this.  It was still good, and I will re-make, but with half the onion.  Also, the recipe doesn't mention anything about chopping up the onions.  Surely you aren't meant to leave huge vidalia rings in the salad.

LOVED THIS! It is so good to see a chicken salad that is savory(no fruit or even sweet pickles) I like it like that some times, but I prefer this anyday. A keeper. I am making this for a ladies luncheon next week. Thanks.

This was a very good mix of flavors. The overall color was the only downside to it. We put it in wraps with some lettuce and it made for a very good and easy meal.

Loved this recipe; my husband found it! I'm not a fan of traditional chicken salad, so this was right up my alley! Didn't have many mushrooms on hand, so I grilled what I had and then dumped a small can of mushrooms into the mix when I added the mayo. Added a bit of garlic as well and served on fresh whole wheat bread with avocado slices and american cheese; it was delicous and now a fav in our house!

I would not have even looked at a chicken salad recipe except the name appealed to me.  I was all right.  I think it makes a better grilled chicken sandwich w spicy mayo.

This is so good and so easy. My family loved it. I used white onions and cremini mushrooms because that is what I had. I don't see how this could be better. The marinade is so good and simple I will use it for grilling.

This was absolutely superb.  The only thing that I didn't do exactly in the recipe was char the mushrooms but only because I couldn't.  I don't know what a grill basket is and they would have fallen through the grill slits so I put some foil on the grill and cooked them that way.  The onion I was able to chop big enough to throw directly on the grill.  The marinade itself is really good so I'll definetly be making plain grilled chicken with this seasoning.  If you "accidentally" make something else please post the recipe, this one was wonderful.

Great recipe! I added 2 slices of chopped bacon for added flavour and omitted the salt. I also grilled the vegetables on wooden skewers and added green, red and orange peppers for variety. They were great on toast and wraps. My husband is going to try it at the NASCAR tailgate party in June!

Easy, fast, and yummy! I loved the simplicity of a mayonnaise Tabasco dressing. I served on a bed of shredded lettuce, with the salad still warm. A great light summer supper.

This was quite good. Not your typical chicken salad, but then sometimes it's nice to spice things up. This is definitely not a chicken salad to put between two slices of bread; instead, put it in a a big hoagie roll or some thing along those lines! Having said that we put it over a salad of greens, tomato, avocado. The only actual change I made was in using boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts. They're so much juicier. I also used two portobello mushroom caps, not knowing what kind of mushrooms she is calling for. I had one big onion I used instead of two. Two big onions seems a bit much. I used Frank's red hot-probably about a quarter cup, then Hubby added more to his salad. Definitely a go to summer salad!

We do not care for mushrooms so would leave them out. Celery would be good in it also. Didn't have celery so added some fresh green pepper, which gave it a nice crunch. Real mayo makes it creamy.  Yum!

I loved this recipe, it was so full of flavor and moisture I didn't need to add any dressing. The onions and mushrooms were such a great addition.
