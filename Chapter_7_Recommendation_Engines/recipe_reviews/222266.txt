This recipe was easy, and very tasty.  Loved the texture.  I put it in an 11 x 7 pan and it took about 40 minutes and it was well browned and puffy.  The only thing I changed was that I put pre-cooked bacon pieces on the top before baking.

well I sure made a mistake.. thought I could use this recipe as a baseline and add my own things like ham instead of zuchinni etc.. well I ended up with a gaint ham and cheese biscuit.. not quiche texture at all. On the upside though my five year old loved it and didn't detect the minced onion at all.

Excellent excellent excellent!! My very picky teens (the 4 of them) gobbled this up so fast that I am glad that I made two extra pie shells because this is a fantastic meal that everyone LOVED. I will certainly put this in our family favorites list of regular recipes to be served. I love how I was able to make this in the early morning and then all day they were "in it" Everyone prefered it cold too...... Thanks again for the great recipes!

years ago I made same quiche. don't use the breadcrumbs and used Lucatel Cheese it was always great. Now since I live in Ohio and have trouble finding Lucatel I use grated Romano instead and it is just as tasty. I love it with fresh tomatoes from the garden and corn on the cob. I also don't shred the zucchini I slice thin or chop. Very nice taste

My family loved this one, even the grand kids!  I sliced fresh garden tomatoes on top and went a little heavier with the cheddar and Parmesan.  It's a great recipe for a Sunday morning - so easy  to put together.  It' s also good reheated for lunch.

Family ate this one right up. Based on the reviews I read, I halved the oil and added a 1/4 cup of milk and topped the dish with cooked bacon.  Should become a staple.

Good base recipe especially if you are gluten free....I used gluten free bisqick in this recipe and eggs fresh from the coup. I also added 1/2 red bell pepper diced, extra cheese, and 2 extra eggs as they were fresh and not all uniformly sized so I added to the consistancy I thought was right. No soupy but moist, almost like a cake/brownie batter.i omited parsley and bread crumbs, as I didnt have parsley and I didnt want to make my own gluten free bread crumbs. Not bad, next time I will sautee the onions and garlic to bring out more flavor.

I used a couple of different cheeses (what I had available) and substituted fresh oregano from my garden for the dry.  I think the only suggestion I would make would be is to use less oil.  Maybe a little oil and milk for the liquid.  It is very good and makes a great brunch dish.

Is wonderful with fresh vegetables and herbs - I used dill and we loved it. Not really a true quiche, but quick and easy to make and great as make ahead for savoury weekday breakfasts.

The entire family liked this one .  I enjoyed making it because it was so easy I have shredded a lot of zucchini and frozen it for winter so for sure I will make this again.

It was very good.  Instead of shredding zucchini, I sliced the zucchini.  I sprayed a quiche pan, sprinkled it with the bread crumbs, and layered the sliced zucchini.  I then mixed all the other ingredients and poured them over the zucchini. Baked for 45 Minutes.

Really yummy! The spices added a lot. I didn't put in biscuits or cheese and added other vegetables  (carrot and tomato)

This turned out more like a cake and was so dry. We had to drink a lot of liquid to get it down. I am back to my old and favorite quiche recipe.

First I want to say that I love any zucchini recipe that doesn't require me to salt and squeeze the zucchini. This went together very easily and was well received by the husband. The only real changes I made were in how the ingredients were put together. I mixed together the wet ingredients with the spices, and added in some red pepper flakes, then I added in the onions, zucchini, and cheeses, last I folded in the baking mix. After reading other reviewers suggestions I cut back on the amount of oil I used by about 2T, and used more spices than the recipe calls for. I will be making this again and again.

I made this yesterday and my family LOVED it!!  I did change it a little bit - I added some cooked bacon, substituted mac 'n cheese blend cheese for the cheddar and sprinkled more cheese on top of the quiche prior to baking it.  My 16 yr old asked if I could maybe make it again this week!!!  SCORE!

I liked this dish. I made it as the introduction suggested, with half of the zucchini replaced by shredded potatoes. It reminded my daughter and me of potato kugel. I served it with a chopped Israeli salad for a vegetarian dinner. It was very satisfying.

Loved it.  Made as written with the only variation being I used extra cheese and used a high quality Gouda and used a gluten free baking mix as didn't have any regular on hand.  It was delicious.  The texture isn't quite the same as a traditional quiche but it was still wonderful and breakfasty. Did not find it oily at all despite the use of the vegetable oil.

This pie was delicious!  I used about 1/4 cup of feta cheese, 1/4 c. of sharp cheddar cheese, 1/8 c. of fresh parmesan, and about 1/4 c. of mozzarella because these were the cheeses I had on hand.

(We didn't even wait to cut into it.  It was easy to cut inot slices and serve right away.)

My husband loved it, too!

I tried this recipe and was surprised to find vegetable oil as an
ingredient.  I have made many quiches and seen many recipes for quiche,but none of them had oil.  I think milk, cream or such would definitely be more compatible with quiche than oil - the pan was oily, it tasted oily, perhaps will make again with milk/cream in place of oil.

I followed the recipe 100%. If I was making bread I would think this recipe as great 5 star even. This was my first quiche and I was expecting more of an eggy dish. I saw another recipe on this website similar to this except they said add 2 cups milk. I don't know if that will turn out bread like too, but I'll give it a go next. I'll keep this recipe for a savory bread.
