The mayonnaise recipe is delicious!! I added a tablespoon of lemon juice though. The key to is to let the oil drip VERY, VERY slowly in order for the emulsification process to take place. I pour it into the "pusher" attachtment (it has a small hole at the bottom)of my food processor. Unlike vinaigrette, homemade mayo should not separate if made correctly. It "sets up" nicely if you use this process (SEE MY PHOTO). Thank you for the recipe! UPDATE: For those of you who do not have a hole in your pusher, simply poke a small hole on the bottom of paper cup. Place the cup, hole facing the feeder, and pour the oil into the paper cup. This way the oil will dribble which is an essential step in ensuring homemade mayo to "set up".

Just a note from the "author".  My original recipe did not call for mixing the "homemade mayonnaise" with the eggs, but to use as a side to top the eggs.  We have always made the egg mixture with regular Hellmanns mayo and dolloped the homemade mayonnaise on top.  This is the way my mother served it to us in France.  It is excellent.

8 IN THE MORNING, FORGOT TO BUY MAYO, MADE FROM THIS RECIPE. EXCELLENT. I KNOW VINEGAR KEEPS THE WHITE COLOR AND LEMON JUICE DOESN'T. EITHER WILL MAKE EGG CHANGE CHEMISTRY SO IT ABSORBS MORE OIL. I USE TABASCO INSTEAD OF BLACK PEPPER, AND THE MIXER RUINS MAYO, HAND WHISK IS SLOWER AND WON'T BREAK THE EGGS. MY ARMS ARE USED TO THE WHISK...DIDN'T REMEMBER THE EGG/OIL RATIO, THAT'S WHY I SEARCHED FOR THIS RECIPE. I JUST LIKE HOMEADE STUFF BETTER THAN SPENDING MORE AND BUYING STOREBOUGHT. FRESHER. YOU SHOULDN'T REFRIGERATE THE MAYO FOR 8 HOURS TOO, HAS TO FINISH SETTING UP BEFORE REFRIGERATING IT. HOPE THESE TIPS ARE USEFUL. THANK-YOU SO MUCH FOR A GREAT RECIPE, IN MY CASE, JUST THE MAYO.

I'm rating this on the concept, not the use of canned salmon. Yes, canned salmon is very fishy tasting and the only way I eat salmon is when my hubby smokes it. I suggest investing in a good smoked salmon from the grocery store because this appy really is delicious if done properly. I did not make my own mayo; Hellmans works just fine for me. I also added some herbs and spices to the salmon/egg mixture including dill. Lovely appetizer and thank you!

This was AWESOME!!!  I can't wait to serve it at my next party!  I did not make the mayonnaise from scratch though, I used Hellmann's and just added the garlic, vinegar, salt and pepper to it.  I did dollop a little extra on top of the eggs, and used the doctored mayo to make the yolk mixture.  Next time I will sprinkle freshly ground pepper on top too.

When I made this with smoked salmon instead of canned, it was wonderful! Top with snipped chives.

Just rating on the mayonnaise part of the recipe: Not the closest ever made to mayonnaise from the store. Still good, but not the best.

This recipe would have been better with tuna.  The salmon is very overpowering to the flavor, especially after it has sat for a bit.

I used just the mayonnaise part of this recipe as I'm not a fan of deviled eggs.  It was SO easy and turned out SO good!  Before I began, I had my doubts that I would be able to pull it off, but I needn't have worried.  I think the trick is to keep whisking the egg yolks and add the oil a drop at a time.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so used regular white vinegar and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't use the garlic either, but can see adding some roasted garlic, horse radish, whatever you want.  I don't use a lot of mayonnaise, so can see myself making it from scratch when I do need it.  Thanks for a great, easy and tasty recipe.

Easy recipe for deviled eggs; very tasty!  I used the whole amount of mayonnaise, and enjoyed the garlic flavor there!

Not impressed at all.  Had a big party and most of these were leftover.

This was my first try at mayonnaise and it came out beautifully.  Thank you for the recipe! BTW this CAN be mixed up with just a fork and a bowl if anyone is wondering...just put on youtube or something for entertainment because it takes a while! If you're patient though it will come out great.

Be sure you like a very fishy taste!  The guests left 3/4 of them untouched...very surprising as I am used to having deviled eggs disappear right away.  I had requests from my son...to please not make them again!
