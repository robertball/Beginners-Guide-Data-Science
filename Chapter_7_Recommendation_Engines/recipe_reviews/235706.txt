Nice basic beef stew recipe. To me the juice needed a little oomph so I added beef boullion and garlic powder. Good flavor for a cold night.

I ve been making this for several years. What I like about it is that the recipe is just a guide. I rarely vary it by much but then again I don t measure anything. I d tried stew recipes with all kinds of different spices etc. but found through this one that stew is like a steak...basic salt and pepper does the trick! I do add bullion but mainly because I use a LOT of vegetables and the meat alone is not enough to flavor the water required. It s excellent!

There was not enough liquid included in the recipe.  I added about 4 cups of beef broth & vegetable juice for added flavor.
