yummy! ground chicken is probably one of the nastiest things to handle... before it is cooked.  It is kind of hard to keep the burgers together but as long as you form somewhat of a patty and get it into the pan you will be fine (you can reshape as you go).  Also, be sure not to overcook these guys.  Like all overcooked chicken, they will be dry and not as flavorful.  I just check the middle after a few minutes on each side when the meat looks cooked, it usually doesn't take much longer.  I also added chopped jalapenos to the burger mixture, so good!

It was good but not great.  Hint; resist the urge to try to bind the meat with egg or breadcrumbs.  Actually resist the urge to touch it at all....treat the burger like cookie dough and use a spoon when time to fry just drop a large dallop into pan, it will stick together.

Made this last night and my husband LOVED it! He said, "Honey, I am so lucky to have you as my wife!"...needless to say, this is an excellent recipe :) I added chopped jalepenos and a dash of cumin. We aren't "bun" people so we ate them breadless with slices of avocado and topped with dressing: 
For the dressing I mixed a hidden valley ranch packet into plain yogurt and added diced onion, lime zest, and fresh cilantro.
The tartness from the yogurt gives it an AWESOME flavor.

You will not regret making this recipe!

Served this to my son-in-law who doesn't like much of anything, and he said "This is good." Very high praise from him.

Good recipe!! I substituted fresh garlic & ginger as it give a better flavour. Garlic powder tends to smell nasty & strong. Also, I used more chopped Cilantro. Very good!

This was my first time cooking ground chicken.  After I added all of my ingredients together it wouldn't hold together.  Then I added egg and bread crumbs to help it hold together and it became VERY sticky. MY husband didn't attempt to grill them b/c he figured they would fall through the grill.  I panfried them (4 min on one side was too long).  4 min on  one side and 3 on the other.  I was the only one who liked them.  I think if you put a little salsa on the bun it would be even better.  But, really?  What did I do wrong?

I had avocado and cilantro in my fridge... Goggled and this is the recipe I got. YUMMY!! The avocado gives it the right texture And the ranch makes it a perfect blend. I followed the recipe exactly!

Not bad health wise either... Only 7 weight watcher plus points! (okay add the bun and it was 10 but you could substitute something else for the bun!!)

Definitely recommend!

We were split on this tonight - half of us really loved it and half it was ok.  I followed the recipe except cut the garlic in half.  Definitely recommend making ahead and letting rest in the refrigerator to allow flavors to blend and for burgers to set (so they handle easier). Have been requested again but only in smaller slider form.

This recipe is so versatile and it always tastes good!  If you have more time, fresh garlic is always a plus!  Last time I made it I also added chopped and de-seeded jalapeno, it was delicious!  Add or omit ingredients to your liking!  Enjoy!

These were excellent! I wasn't sure what to expect, but needed something quick to make that tasted good. I didn't go so heavy on the cilantro. I only added about a 1/4 cup. Also added a dash of cumin. We are watching our carbs, so we ate these patties on a bed of fresh spinach with the avacado and italian dressing. Very very good. Also great tip from another reviewer...don't even bother trying to handle the meat with your hands to make patties! I simply mixed everything with a spoon, then spooned into the pan and patted them into my desired size with the spoon. Never touched it and it was hassle free! Nothing came apart at all so don't listen to the voice in your head telling you to add breadcrumbs or egg! I will definataly make these again!

I can't believe more people haven't tried this recipe.  It's simple and so tasty!  The only suggestion I will make which I believe others have as well is to combine everything, shape the burgers, and let them set in the fridge for a few hours if you can.  They held together beautifully and were so moist and flavorful.

A new favorite!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts that I chopped in food processor (instead of buying ground chicken). Used fresh ginger and garlic. Olive oil instead of spray.  I turned the raw patties over in Panko Bread Crumbs, lightly.  Let them sit in fridge a couple of hours before cooking.  No problems with falling apart.  They were very good, with seasoned mayo, avocadoes, fresh spinach and tomatoes on whole grain buns.  Thanks.

This was my first chicken burger to try. It turned out pretty good, however I did adjust ingredient measurements a little. The pepper amount called for was way too much, I used a couple pinches and it was still too much for me. I also only used approximately 1/4 tsp ginger, 3/4 tsp garlic & 1/4c cilantro, which was perfect for my tastes. I was a little nervous this was going to fall apart, but I lightly mixed the ingredients, lightly formed into a patty and placed on wax paper. Preheated a gas grill to med-high heat, sprayed grates, and cooked 4-6 minutes on one side, then flipped and cooked until thermometer read 165, another 3-5 minutes. I did top with ranch dressing, lettuce, and pickles.

I was feeling a bit lazy so, I made everything the way the recipe stated. The only thing that I did differently was instead of forming patties I shaped into a meatloaf and baked it. I sliced it up and put it on a bed of lettuce with tomatoes, avocado and low fat French dressing for a nice low carb dinner. Amazing!!

Good burgers. A tad dry and I made adjustments to some of the ingredients. I used 1lb of extra lean ground chicken, decreased the garlic powder to a lil over a tspn, used 1/2 lime juice, and some grinds of fresh cracked pepper, I also added some chopped green onion. Tasty and flavorful, but not the best chicken burger here...and I have basically tried them all since I m such a fan of chicken burgers. Thanks!

I added less than a teaspoon of back pepper.  But, it still tasted like too much. I don't think pepper was the only problem.  This recipe just gets a big yuck from this family.

Terrific! My butcher was closing and only had ground turkey on hand so used that. Will try chicken next time but these turkey burgers, grilled outside, were wonderful.

This was ok, but nothing great.  I thought it was very peppery. That was the strongest flavor by far.  I don't think we will make it again.  I'd probably give it a 3, but my husband says 1 or 2.

I butcher my old girls and grind up the meat so I am always looking for good ground chicken recipes. This one is outstanding! I cut back on the pepper just a tad (heaping teaspoon) and used dried Cilantro. I had an avocado on hand and am really glad I did. Avocado was the crowning glory to this burger. Thanks for an awesome recipe.  Next time I may try to grill it!

It was OK but cilantro flavor was too strong. Husband did not like it much I did moreso. Texture was excellent and topped with salsa it worked for us. Would not make again.

We loved this one. It had a good touch of spice to it and I hadn't thought to put avocado on a burger, but the ranch and avocado helped balance the spice out very well. As other reviewers stated, the consistency of these is hoing to be questionable,  but just trust and go with it, they hold together well and come out very tasty.

I know that the ground chicken can be a little dry. To me, the good fats from the avacado really helps. It's a very healthy meal. Just plain with some greens or on a 100% wheat bun is good also.

I added a few items to the recipe and made meatballs rather than burgers. Added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped bell pepper, 1 egg, and around 1/3 cup breadcrumbs. I also used as much juice as I could squeeze out of a lime- maybe 2 teaspoons. These were fantastic, would definitely make again (even as burgers if someone other than my non-burger-eating son were dining with me).

These were fantastic!  I made the ranch dressing with plain Greek yogurt, as another reviewer recommended, and put avocado and tomato on the sandwich.  It was a delicious, fast dinner!

These were great.  I would add a bit more ginger. Perhaps a tsp. Other then that  everyone like it.  Even the people that "were" against chicken burgers.

First time buying ground Chicken(good deal) and i didn't know what to do with it. This Turned out great! I put 1 1/2 tsp instead of 1 TBSP of pepper though it seemed like alot.  I might try a little taco seasoning mix next time too :) there is alot u can do with this. Thanks for the idea :)

I  think with a little fine tuning it could be 4 stars.  the cilantro was overwhelming, I will cut that down next time. It's definitely missing salt. I think I'll eliminate the soy sauce and just use salt.  I made fresh guacamole and put that on top instead of just avocado. I sprinkled a little cheese. I brushed olive oil  on my cast iron grill and it turned out fine. Put a lid on it so it obtains a little moisture. It was good texture wise. It smelled really yummy. The flavor just lacked a little something. I'll def. try it again.

I had a lot of extra ground chicken in the freezer when I came across this recipe. I am glad I did, it is awesome. I reduced the garlic by 1/2 and left out the lime juice since I didn't have any. My husband raved about it. I will make it again.

Maybe these would be better with the spice level cut in half, everything together was just too overpowering.

These were pretty good, but a bit on the bland side. I subbed crushed garlic for the powder. Next time I'd probably use sea salt instead of the soy sauce. I topped with Avocado and fresh pico de gallo. Thanks for the recipe.

OK, but like a different recipe from this site better because it has a filler so the burgers stay together.  The burgers falling apart was a big problem with these.

This is VERY GOOD~  I also love that I can whip these up in a matter of minutes!!  Even extra lean chicken breast comes out fine here and I did not even have to oil my non-stick scanpan.  I used half as much black pepper and it was enough for me! Love it!

Made as per the recipe with the exception of some of the options. Yes, I prefer fresh garlic and cilantro. Love how versatile this recipe can be. I followed the lead of the Barefoot Contessa and mixed my meat with a large metal whisk (She did it with meatloaf). Important not to over mix.

I used ground turkey breast and gapped out and put in about 3 tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce. Used a teaspoon of garlic pepper seasoning in place of garlic powder and pepper. This recipe made fantastic, moist, juicy burgers.

Using 1 Pd of ground chicken I used fresh ginger and garlic and kept all other ingredients true to the recipe... helpful tip, I let the mixture sit in the frig for an hour and used gloves while mixing and forming 4 patties.... very flavorful! Will definitely make this recipe again... I had these on medium heat in a nonstick pan and cooked for approx 9 min...

So so GOOD!!! I accidentally added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs (I was looking at another recipe at the same time and mixed up the two!) and only 1/4 tsp white pepper. The rest was as the recipe said... DELICIOUS!!!! Will make again!

I made the recipe as written though left out the optional lime juice and ranch dressing as I didn't have any.  I had no issues forming the burgers though found they took longer to cook in my electric skillet than the 4-5 mins per side.  My avocado was too soft to top as slices so I mashed it and used it that way.  I found the flavor to be very good with the different seasonings.  My husband thought the recipe was great as I made it, but I think I will use the ranch dressing next time to tone down the black pepper and cilantro taste.

Added fresh garlic and jalapeño to the meat mixture, used pico de galo as an additional topping and substituted ranch for an avocado/lime crema. One of the best burgers I can think of

I made these tonight because I had most of the ingredients (no avocado but that would have been amazing). I live in Thailand so had fresh ginger laying around, added probably double what called for, no garlic powder so did garlic salt, would have added some finely diced red onions (they're size of garlic here,so easy to chop small), but honestly so full of flavor and nothing more added.  Didn't make it for pictures! Saving to make a bunch and freeze for easy dinners. LOVE

I love cilantro and avocados and expected this to be a very delicious burger but it was just ok ! It needed a good amount of salt, the soy alone wasn't enough. Beside being under salted, it didn't have much flavor. If it wasn't for the home made guacamole that I topped it with, I don't think I would have finished my burger ! If I make this recipe again I will add other spices , such us cumin and chili powder in addition of at least 1/2 t salt .

Made tonight for my husband. I ground chicken instead of buying preground. It was really sloppy when trying to make patties so I added some bread crumbs. That helped a bunch. The DH gave it a 4 but, sure enjoyed having 2 burgers! Will probably make again.

Made this as written...had to cook a few more minutes to get to proper internal temp. This is delicious! We topped the chicken burgers with spicy guacamole and Ranch dressing. I'm going to try using ground turkey.

Tasty! Didn't have the avocado and dressing. Would be tastier with these I'm sure. Just right amount of spice with the changes bellow. I left in fridge for 1.5 days for flavours to set in. Used fresh garlic and halfed it and fresh ginger. Halfed ground pepper. Don't overcook as it will taste like dry chicken. I didn't touch with hands, used the spoon to flatten into round patties.

Next time will try with a dash of cumin
May make into meatloaf next time.

Slight mods, but not much.  Added 1/4 cup diced onion and Italian bread crumbs, some ketchup, mustard and Worcester sauce. Also, I only made three patties instead of four since I was grilling and wanted them a bit thicker. I put the three patties on parchment paper.... enough so that it could wrap around the patties.... put them in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Wrapped the parchment paper around them and pressed them a bit after taking them out to firm them up, taking care to push the edges in. They grilled just perfectly, and the family absolutely loved them. Great recipe! Next time will double if grilling to make 6 patties.

I used an egg and some breadcrumbs to freshly ground chicken it looked sticky and way to mushy put it on the George foreman. Juicy and tender. Good flavor!

My husband loved these. Didn't bother with the ranch as he's not a fan. I asked what he'd like in place of the ranch & he said "nothing" because the flavor was so good without it. TIP: I mixed the meat with a spoon & divided equally onto 4 pieces of wax paper, formed them into patties using the wax paper as a barrier between my hands, then folded the wax paper around them, and refrigerated them overnight. They weren't sticky at all & stayed together perfectly. Plus, my hands never got dirty! I cooked them on stove top level 7, 3 minutes on one side and 4 minutes on the other. Perfect! Great low cal recipe! And super easy!

Yum!!  My kids loved this and so did I. My husband said it was heavy on the cilantro so I would cut back on that next time. Also, I didn't add the ground ginger. I've added this to my favorites!

I made these last night and my boyfriend and I thought they tasted great! I skipped the bun due to diet restrictions and sliced fresh tomato and avacodo to put on top and a bit of franks red hot for a kick! I also broiled mine in the oven with a broiler pan and I added fresh garlic and fresh ginger instead! I plan to make a big batch of the se and freeze them very soon.

I absolutely ADORE this recipe. A lot of comments say that its sticky when raw and that is so true!! I use latex free gloves to form the patties and they come out beautifully. I serve them on toasted buns with a side of rosemary fries. These burgers are extremely intense, but as long as you like cilantro, this is literally the best burger recipe you can find.

I made this as meatballs to mix it up a bit. I left out the ground ginger and added cumin and the whole family harfed it down! I'll try it as burgers next time! The tips on 'don't touch it and don't add binders' are bang on - it drops from a spoon into a pan just like cookie dough.

We all enjoyed this. My only change was turkey instead of chicken (what we prefer) and we also grilled. Tasty!

These are good. The only thing that I would change is that we felt that a Tablespoon of black pepper was way to much. Next time I will only use 1 teaspoon of black pepper.

Hard to hold together but worth the effort.  What could not be good: ginger, cilantro, ground chicken, avocado, and a little garlic.  The best of all worlds.  Had a problem on the BBQ but salvaged all the pieces.  Tonight I will try pan searing and putting on an Arugula Salad.  My wife tried it with ground chicken breast meat and it was dry and chewy.

Cooked on my george foreman. Do not try to form patties. Spoon it like cookie dough and it grills up perfect. My family loved these!

Very tasty.  I did use all the optional items(lime,ranch and avocado), hint: make sure you buy avocado ahead of time so it has time to ripen.  I only used half the pepper (1/2T) and glad I did, for you can really taste it. This was the reason I only gave it a 4(w/o halving it, would have been way to much). I also added a little more cilantro then called for but we really like cilantro. Has lots of flavor. I didn't have the bread it called for but I did have some beautiful potato hamburger rolls that were great.

i want to say this needed salt.. but i used light soy sauce.. so i'm gna give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and say that's the reason why.. other than that we loved the flavor.. next time i'll have to use regular soy sauce.. ty for the recipe.. UPDATE: i wanted to try this again b/c it was easy enough the first time.. i omitted the soy sauce and used about 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt.. next time i think i'd use a little less.. also decreased the garlic and pepper by half.. i sloshed some bottle lemon juice over it and kept the ground ginger the same.. it's very gingery.. if i were to attempt to perfect this again i'd probably go with half the ginger but i guess it all depends on what you want the dominant flavor to be.. and that's a good thing! because you could always change the flavor profile.. herbs, heat, etc.. i have avocado this time so we'll see if that makes any difference.. UPDATE #2: i think i finally perfected this for our tastes.. 20oz ground turkey for the 1lb ground chicken, 1 tsp kosher salt for the soy, 1 tsp of both garlic powder and black pepper.. also substitute a heaping tsp of fresh ginger for the ground.. very happy!

Excellent!  My husband could not stop talking about them.  I followed the recipe as written but added 1/4 c. panko bread crumbs and served them on English Muffins. I will be making these again in the near future: - )

This recipe gives ground chicken (a usually dull meat) a great flavor.  My family loved it.  I didn't serve on buns, but served just as a burger pattie and I made a teriyaki sauce to go over it.  Very good.

I give this 4 stars because we did not like this with ground chicken. It tastes much better with ground turkey and on a whole wheat bun with romaine and ranch dressing. We skip the avacado only because my husband doesn't like them. I also used a low sodium soy sauce. So far I have made these 3 times in the past 4 weeks. A hit in our house.
