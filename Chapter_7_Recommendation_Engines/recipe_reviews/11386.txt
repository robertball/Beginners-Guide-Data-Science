These cookies were terrific with some major tweaking so I can only give them a 4, but after adjustment they are a 6!  I followed the suggestion of adding an extra banana and using the banana butter icing from this site, but the dough was way too thin for cookies so I added 1 c. of quick oats as well.  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar just because I like cookies with brown sugar.  The end result was phenomenal.  I actually only iced half of them because my family liked them plain as well.  They taste like muffin tops!

YUM-MEE!  Like other reviewers I added 1/4 C extra flour, 1/2t. baking powder, and a bunch of chocolate chips.  Dee-lish.  So fluffy and cakelike.  The recipe makes about 36 cookies, but if you eat them quickly enough before your husband gets home, you can say it just makes 24!

These are AWESOME!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I subbed 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup shortening, & next time I will add another banana.  I'm tellin ya, this beats the morning time mess (AKA: crumbs from cutting banana bread that I clean up), now the kids just take them & run!  I also didn't have powdered sugar, so I used "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" (found on this web site) on the top, delish!  They really didn't need the glaze they are good plain.  Thanks Molly!

These "cookies" were delicious. I had to tweak the recipe a little but they turned out great. I used 2 bananas, brown sugar instead of white, butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 cup more flour and cinn. and nutmeg. They didn't need the frosting. I dusted with powdered sugar. They are so fluffy and light. They are more like a muffin top than a cookie.

I tweaked it a little because it was a weak version of banana bread....lacked flavor.And walla! Delish! I followed the recipe exactly...just added 1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar, 1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts and 1 more banana. I think 3 bananas would be even better! Tasted just like good ole' southern "like grandma use to make" banana bread!

This is a wonderful recipe. Not too sweet, moist, fluffy and tasty.  I halved this recipe, along with using margarine, and half whole wheat flour.  I also added more banana.  So good!! Oh- Also added pecans and walnuts!!  But make alot, they disappear quickly.  Another thing- No need for icing, just dust with powdered sugar, it will be all the sweetness you need. ****Edit:The only bad thing about these, is the tops get moist and soggy.  Dont stack them on top of each other, they get very sticky.

These cookies are wonderful! Just alittle note: after you make up the batter, chill it for an hour or so. They come out like little cakes. I didn't use the frosting on them.

I LOVE this recipe!! I'm NOT a baker, but this is SO EASY! I have a daughter who dislikes bananas, but she's OK with this. I make this EVEN EASIER by plopping all the cookie dough (it's very much like BATTER) into a greased 9X12 cake pan and baking for 25-30 minutes at the recommended temperature. Iced or not, cut into bars, these are WONDERFUL!

I was looking for something different to use up 2 bananas and came across this recipe and boy am I glad I did. I read past reviews and decided to follow the suggestions of using half margarine/half regular shortening in place of the butter flavored and used half cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also increased flour to 2 1/2 cups since I had added 2 bananas. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. This recipe makes lots of totally addictive soft cookies that taste like banana bread and the glaze is not needed but since we enjoy spreading our banana bread with butter I did do the glaze which is more like a very spreadable icing. I think of glaze as something you can pour over warm items.  Baked for 15 minutes and last batch stayed in 7 minutes longer (interrupted by a phone call LOL) and they still turned out moist and not burned.

These are great cookies! My husband made them and added Chocolate chips and walnuts and then doubled the bananas. They are light and fluffy. Turned out perfectly and I will use this recipe over the holidays!

yum - these are awesome. I didn't use the suggested glaze though b/c I had some leftover Banana Butter Icing - which prompted me in the first place to go looking for a banana cookie recipe. The two pair together nicely. I highly recommend trying Banana Butter Icing with these cookies -- it's a pity I didn't double the recipe - oh well, I can always make more.

Tastes just like banana bread but in cookie form. Only changes I made was using half white sugar and half brown sugar and I used two bananas (which equaled one cup mashed). I also left the butter out of the simple glaze (because thats how I do it for my banana bread) The cookies are YUMMY!!!!

These are SO easy and SO incredibly good--the only thing I can think of that would make them better is to add some mini-chocolate chips to the batter(making another batch tomorrow to test that theory LOL!). I did not use the icing -- they were perfect without it.

i made this recipe low fat- so i used 1/2c greek yogurt instead of the shortning (dont need a full cup)  and 2 bananas. I added also 1 teaspoon of baking powder in addition to make them more fluffy. They were SO fluffy- like a muffin top like someone said and low fat is always good! I made them jumbo so didnt have 36 cookies. So good to have one with my coffee for breakfast or for a snack. i will make the full fat ones when i have guests over, because im sure they are better :)

I like these better than banana bread!  Easy to carry out to the golf course for early morning munching!  Great with tea or cocoa!  Just the right moistness, and taste just as good as banana bread!  I doubled the banana, added a little extra flour, used regular crisco, and added a handful of crushed walnuts.   WONDERFUL heavenly soft fluffy texture.  I skipped the frosting (they dont need it), will definitely make again!

I used three bananas, added some nutmeg and cinnamon and used half white, half brown sugar.  These were so yummy!!  A little banana bread snack!  I didn't use the icing; didn't think they needed it.

I used 2 medium bananas since thats what i was trying to use up. I followed the cookie recipe exactly other than that. They came out wonderful!! So soft - just like little hand-held banana bread slices. I didnt bother with the icing, I thought they were good plain. I brought them into work and they disappeared in minutes and had 2 ladies ask for the recipe. So easy and so yummy!

These were a hit. I had to use up bananas. I doubled the recipe and modified a little. When doubled:1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 4 mashed bananas, 5 cups flour, 1tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, put parchment paper on baking sheets, used a gravy ladle and made large size cookies and before putting in oven I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top and then put in oven and then doesn't need glaze. My 9 year old daughter said never thought banana and cookies would go together

WE LOVE these!! I made them and used banana extract in place of vanilla and used the banana butter icing from this site. My 3 yr old daughter loves to make these with me and it is not as sweet as other cookies and at least has a banana  in it so I feel not as bad when we make them...:-)

These cookies were so easy and tasted great.  I did use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and put walnuts in them.  I also did not use the glaze.  My husband loved them too.

Delicious with only a few tweeks - light cookies with wonderful flavor.  I used 2 bananas, brown sugar i/o white, and 1/4 cup butter 3/4 cups shortening.  Seriously - these are wonderful!

Really great! Although I did tweak them a bit.  Based on other reviews I used 3 bananas.  I also folded in butterscotch chips and chopped walnuts (and skipped the icing).  Mine had to cook much longer, close to 30 min.  I'm guessing that's because of the extra bananas.   The cookies were had very good flavour and were SOO soft.  Even the batch I thought I had overcooked was still very light and fluffy.  Foolproof!

I made these into bars rather than cookies. Didn't use the icing, used powdered sugar instead. I used half butter/half regular shortening. Half brown sugar/half white artifical sweetner. Hubby,myself and daughter all really enjoyed these. I also used 2 banannas. And a teaspoon of cinnamon.

These are delicious and couldn't be easier! I made half the batch with 1 whole banana. I also used half brown sugar and butter and regular crisco instead of butter flavored shortening. These taste just like banana bread only in cookie form!! I was really pleasantly surprised! I will make again!

Very good cookies! I did a few changes however, using half brown sugar, double the banana, added 1 C. oatmeal and also added chocolate chips. I'm expecting them to be even better the next day just the way banana bread is!

I used two over ripe bananas and these are amazing!!! They get a bit too soft and stick to each other after a few days but they are so worth it! I added chopped walnuts in my batch and chocolate chips in my fiance's batch. This is one of my favorite recipes and I only have two so far of all the cookies I've made. (The other favorite of mine is Russian Tea Cakes. Little tip - keep the Russian cookies and the banana cookies in the same container and the Russian cookies absorb the banana flavor - HEAVEN).

I used butter instead of shortening, like others had said they did, and added 2 bananas and mini chocolate chips to the recipe, even though I halved the rest of the ingredients (didn't want a full recipe).  Baked as bars, like another reviewer recommended, and was so delighted with the final result!  Fluffy is a great adjective to describe the result.  Other banana bread recipes I've tried have always been so dense, even almost rubbery.  These bars certainly aren't.  I was almost sad to have to part with them, as I had made them to give to a new neighbor!  I'm not going to have trouble knowing how to use up my brown bananas again!  Thanks Molly and everyone else who offered their suggestions.

These were a lot of fun to make and even more fun to eat. My family loved them. But I would definitely recommend using 2 bananas instead of one. I also added a bit of cinnamon.

This is a great recipe!  Tastes like banana bread.  I didn't use butter in the icing, just the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla.  Will definitely make again.

These turned out great. I added 1 more banana and 1 tsp. Banana flavoring and 1/2 C. more flour. This way they had more flavor and were nice and puffy. My husband loved them.

Man oh man, oh MAN!:o) These are excellent! We've been dipping the cookies in the glaze which is a bad thing to be doing, bad Cheep! Thankfully I made them for my bro so they're outta the house tomorrow. Maybe. Well, really how much do I love the guy anyway? He can have half the batch & I expect a lot of genuflecting for it too. Thanks so much for this one! :o) :o)o)

These are delicious.  Although I did add the extra cup of flour and added an extra banana as suggested.  But I also added butterscotch chips to it, that completed the cookie.  I will make this cookie in the future.

Good cake like cookie.  doesn't have the normal cookie texture, hence bread cookie title, so if looking for crisp cookie do not make.  I didn't have vanilla, so i added twice as much maple syrup and added the maple syrup to the frosting as well minus the milk.  Great taste!  They spread aout a bit, so don't put them to close on the cookie sheet:)

Great Recipe! I did as other reviewers recommended. Added 2 extra bananas, 1 cup flour, used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. Added alittle extra vanilla and some almond extract. Also, I baked them on stoneware and cooled the pan off between batches. The cookies came out perfectly! I decided to make "banana whoopie pies" and sandwiched two cookies together with the following filling. -1/2 c. butter,1 c. confectioners' sugar, 1 c. Marshmallow Fluff (about 1/2 of a 7 1/2-oz. jar), 1 tsp. vanilla. Blend together on medium speed. My coworkers could not get enough of them!

These cookies were easy and both of my children loved them!  Like others, I used 2 bananas to up the flavor.  I don't think there were any ill effects on the cookie batter- still very light and fluffy.

OMG.. these turned out AWESOME, WONDERFUL, GREATEST EVER!  Ok.. first.. these are not really like any kind of cookie that I have ever had.  Like another review said.. its more like a muffin top.. oh my.. its delightful!  First, I did change some things.  I added 3 cups of flour because people were saying that it was to thin and it ran and spread out.  I also added 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup dark brown sugar.  Also added a splash of Almond extract because another review said it turned out nice.  And I added another splash of vanilla also.  I had 3 ripe bananas so I added all 3 too.  And last but not least I wanted to add Cinnamon but I didnt have any so I put in the Pampered Chef's Sweet Sensations caramel and cinnamon sprinkes.  These were so good my little one woke up while I was making these and started begging for them.  He as already downed 3.  I am not making the icing.  I will serve them for breakfast with juice and a slab of butter on them.. Just lovely.  I now cant wait for the morning to come!  Thanks for this awesome recipe.. I give this 100 stars!

I used 1/2 Fleischmann's unsalted stick margarine and 1/2 shortening.  I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar .... My son has a milk allergy and I'm always looking for new recipes that I can add to his menu.  This one worked out great!!  I poured it in to a pan and baked for bars as someone had suggested.  I then drizzled the icing and spread it using a basting brush.  It definitely has a banana bread consistency, but that's a plus in this household!!  I recommend this one as an alternative to banana bread when you need a change.

These cookies REALLY spread, so be careful!  I even refrigerated the dough to prevent this from happening, but it still spreads and burns easily.  Flavor and texture were okay, but I won't be making these again, sorry!

I made this for my mother-in-law. The kids got to them first though. lol After reading that some said the batter was too thin I scooped the flour and they turned out great. I also added another banana and some black walnut flavoring. My toddler, who hates cookies, ate several before I finally caught her. A wonderful recipe.

OH MY!!  the banana bread cookies are to die for! The only changes I made to the recipe is added an extra banana (2 instead of 1) and added the mini choc chips. I didn't bother with the frosting. They don't need it they are sooooo good.

The taste is wonderful, just like banana bread. I used two bananas, half white and brown sugar, and half butter and shortening. I made them too big and they spread out a lot in the oven, so I will make them smaller next time. It took about 13 minutes to bake. Great recipe!

I give these cookies a 5 star rating using some of the suggestions from previous reviews.  I used 2 bananas, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1 cup oatmeal.  They turned out great!  If you like a soft cookie, you'll really like these.  I frosted half of them with a regular butter and powdered sugar frosting and the other half dusted with powder sugar.  I think I like them with just the powder sugar the best, not so sweet.

Everyone LOVED these (ok...not my husband - but he hates banana)  My kids ask for these all the time.  In fact, I have had to substitute several times because they are begging for them and I don't have all the ingredients.  I have had to use baking powder instead of baking soda - worked out ok-more cake-like.  We have added more bananas (because each kid wanted to add one) and I have had to use all butter, 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and one time I didn't have butter-flavored shortening or butter, so I used regular shortening and butter extract.  They are eaten up before I have had a chance to put any icing or powdered sugar on them.  Thank you for this recipe.

super good!  I did use 2 bananas & all whole wheat flour.  Iced them lightly with the banana butter icing from this site.  FYI....this icing is much better after it has sat for a day.

Two bananas is definitely the way to go.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract along with the vanilla.  Very tasty!

This recipe is amazing! The cookies came out light, and fluffy...just like banana bread! I used 2 bananas, 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2 cup shortening. I left out the drizzle because I found them just perfect with out it!

Good recipe. These cakey, bread like cookies have a nice flavor, aren't really sweet by themselves but don't need much sugar or frosting on top. I've made them a few times and will do so occasionaly.

Wow!  These cookies are so delicious!!!  When I started to mix these cookies up, I didn't have any Butter Crisco so I used margarine.  They turned out great!  I used two bananas instead of one and used more powdered sugar than the recipe said for the icing.  I will definately make these yummy cookies again!

These cookies really do taste just like banana bread!  I had limited success with the icing, but that's probably because I don't have an electric mixer.

These cookies are excellent!!  I thought I'd make the cookies even better by using cream instead of milk in the icing, that was a mistake.  I couldn't get the right consistency.  I drizzled the frosting over the top and it melted into the cookie, making the cookie seem dough-y.  It was still delicious and we ate them all, but next time I'll use a more traditional frosting, or go without.

This recipe was a nice change from banana bread or muffins. I doubled it and made a few changes: I used 3 bananas total [but it would have been better with 4], I used brown sugar instead of white, and for fats I used 1 cup butter-flavored Crisco, 1/2 cup butter, and 1/4 cup Lighter Bake. I also increased the flour slightly, and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and about 1 cup chocolate chips. Before baking I chilled the dough for a few hours, and I baked the cookies on parchment paper. My cookies puffed beautifully, and I had no problems with spreading or unmanageable dough. 

Next time, I'll decrease the Crisco and increase the Lighter Bake [the cookies were a little too greasy for my taste] and I'll use less flour to make them more moist after cooling off. The dough DOES look too batter-y at first, but after chilling it was fine. The texture turned out similar to muffin tops, and the icing added a nice touch.

Ohmigoodness, these are so good!  I'm a college student and all my room-mates just love them.  They're great frosted with peanut butter instead of the sugar frosting in the recipe.  They're light and puffy, just like banana bread.

Nice way to use up the odd banana. I used two and added some chopped pecans. Chopped dates would be good, too (next time). Took the first pan out of the oven just as they began to brown. Tasted OK, but seemed doughy and not great. Second pan, well, I forgot to set the timer, but lucky for me! Letting these cookies get good and brown made them much tastier! Even put the first pan back in to get more toasted. Recommend that you make sure they bake until pecan-colored (about 18 minutes in my oven)--you will be rewarded with that lovely "muffin top" texture on top, too--we didn't even bother with the icing!

Very good!  Named appropriately - tastes just like banana bread, just in cookie form.
Very soft though, kind of tough to store without crumbling.

Sorry, but these just weren't anything special.  Mine didn't even have much of a banana taste (maybe I should've used a bigger banana?).  They were easy to make but didn't look all that appealing.  After helping me mix them up, my 5 y.o. didn't even want a sample.  Thanks for sharing, but I won't be making these again.

Wanted a change from banana bread, so I tried these cookies and was quite surprised at how good they are.  I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe and it turned out great.  Will continue to make these cookies.

I always have tons of over ripe banana's in my freezer.  I do make banana bread quite often, but I wanted to try something different.  These cookies are great.  They are easy to make and my husband and daughter love them!!  Even my neighbours complimented me on them!

After reading reviews, I added another banana, used Kerrygold butter instead of shortening because that is the only butter I bake with. I used 1/2 wheat flour 1/2 regular flour, 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 sugar. Added mini chocolate chips to the batter and a dash of cinnamon into my glaze. Looked like muffin tops. Family LOVED it.

Wonderful cookies! I followed another reviewers advice and did 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening + 2 bananas. Due to the fact that I had a wheat allergy, it seems whenever I convert a recipe 'over' I have to add more of the 'flour mixture' to make it match the consistency needed, so I added approximately 2/3 C more.  My only recommendation might be to cool the mixture for about 1/2 hour before baking for a more formed cookie. We didn't and they tasted amazing albeit on the flat side!

I made these cookies for a church event and the men were almost fighting over them...lol. I did use  2 large, very ripe bananas and an extra 1/4 cp flour. I chilled the dough for several hours, since it is very sticky. Only had to bake 10 - 11 minutes. I did frost them lightly, which I liked,but my husband loves them plain. Great recipe!

Delicious, soft, and just the right hint of banana! We’ll make these again! The frosting seemed to work best on cooled cookies instead of warm cookies.

Tried making these cookies twice.  Was a bit skeptical, as the picture shows powdered sugar on top.  I tablespoon scoops madehuge falt cookies.  Tasted ok. without the glaze, but looked horrible.  Retried the recipe, following it exactly but using a tsp instead.  Glaze from first try never set up.  The second batch turned out better, but I iced them instead of using the buttery goo that was recommended.  These cookies looked nowhere near the ones in the picture.  Then I read the reviews.  People had given it 4 stars, but then said they added extra ingredients, and basically changed the whole recipe! 
Learned my lesson.  Next time Ill read the reviews closely before I invest time and money in stuff that doesn't work.

GREAT BASE RECIPE! I used a few of the recommendations by others: ADD 1C Quick Oats, Use  1/2C butter & 1/2C applesauce, instead of shortening, ADD 1tsp Cinnamon, 1/2C mini Choc chips, & 1/2C chopped walnuts. ADD 1 banana. I also used Banana Extract instead of Vanilla. I dont like to totally mash the bananas because leaving them a little chunky  makes  them more banana-y.  NO NEED for frosting!! GREAT AS IS -TY!

Didn't  have butter flavored shortening so I did half shortening, half butter and they turned out great. I did put the dough in the fridge between batches, but I do that with all my cookies. I also didn't use the glaze since I don't put one on my banana bread. Very tasty.

I had some over ripe bananas I wanted to use up and didn't want to make a loaf of bread, so I searched banana nut bread cookies and came across this recipe.......best idea ever!! These cookies are so delicious I could barely wait for them to cool off before I dove in! I didn't have any butter flavored shortening so I just used butter instead and I read some of the other comments and decided to add 1/3 cup brown sugar and nuts in the last step! I did half with the frosting, half without, both ways are great, just let them cool slightly before you try to frost or it runs off! Don't walk, but run to the kitchen to make these :)

Like most of the other reviewers, I had to tweak these.  The texture was great, very fluffy, but they were so bland!  After the first tray came out, I added a couple extra bananas, a tsp of ground nutmeg, and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  They came out much tastier (though I think they could stand even a bit more seasoning)  To be fair, though, I didn't make any frosting and maybe that's where some of the flavor comes in.  Oh, and I substituted margarine for shortening as I don't like the taste.

I used all of the suggestions below -- extra banana, extra flour, pinch of baking powder, oh and only about a quarter cup of butter bc that's all I had & a quarter cup of coconut oil. I figured with all the banana it wouldn't need as much butter & they didn't! I would probably skip the butter all together if I had extract bc the dough was still super sticky. Made some plain (hubby's fave), some topped with raisins & glazed walnuts (my fave), & some with sprinkles (my 3 year old had fun). All around a great tasting & easy cookie to make with kids!

I use flavored creamer in place of the milk for the icing and it is so good!  Try Southern Pecan or Caramel Macchiato creamer for a real taste treat!

I added 2 bananas instead of 1, could have used 3-not a very strong banana flavor, unfortunately. I added 1/2 C flour extra and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. The cookie was super soft, and chewy, just needs more flavor. Also, I chilled the dough for about 30-1 hour to thicken it up.

I just made them, and I wish I had read the reviews first, which is something I normally do and didn't for some reason.  I agree they are a little bland and would add an extra banana next time and walnuts.  I also like the idea of replacing the white sugar with brown.  The drizzle I would totally omit and just dust with icing sugar.  But lovely just the same, a good base to start with.  I would make these again.

I love it! I made it healthier by using applesauce instead of butter and whole wheat flour instead of white. I also reduced the sugar by half and added 1/4 cup walnuts to the mix. Delicious and healthy!

I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I put a bit of extra butter in the batter, along with 3x more banana than called for.  I was out of baking soda, so I used baking powder.  The difference between the two leavening agents is that baking powder is meant to be used with batter that has a higher moisture content, so the extra amount of banana made it perfect.  I had a bit of a problem with the consistency of the icing, but it still tasted great.  Next time, I will use a different recipe for icing, but the cookie itself is excellent, closer to the consistency of a muffin.

Both my kids LOVED this recipe..It's a new keeper. I did change a few things..I only made half the recipe but still used 1 whole banana. I used 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I think the cookies baked up kinda like just a muffin top, a yummy banana muffin top. I left half unfrosted for one kid and I frosted the other half with a browned butter frosting. Both were good.

These were pretty good, although not the "muffin top" replacement that some recipes promised.  Mine weren't particularly sweet, maybe because my bananas weren't as ripe, so I topped with the Banana Butter Icing which was a great improvement.

I did as other reviews suggested and added 1 cup of flour and used half white and half brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 cup of mini chocolate chips.  The dough was soft and I would have bet money it needed to be refrigerated so the cookies wouldn't spread out as they baked.  But they didn't!  They are PERFECTLY INCREDIBLE!!  I gave my husband one and he rolled his eyes andmade that kind of "growling" sound which told me this recipe is definately a keeper!  I would have eaten 10 but I'm on a diet!  Good thing!  Thanks so much for an absolutely outstanding cookie recipe!

These cookies are beyond amazing! I added an extra smashed banana to it and baked for 15 minutes for a 2TB ball of sticky dough (per cookie). We like them for breakfast.

These tasted great. I did add a banana. Also, the frosting turned out weird with the butter. I ended up making another batch with just powdered sugar, milk and vanilla.

Everyone I know loves these cookies.  They are light and fluffy almost like a little piece of banana bread but a lot more convient.  I highly reccommend trying them for your family.

This recipe was okay, it did need more flour and more bananas, I used 3. It was still pretty bland and not very tasty. The batter was also still very runny even after using 3 cups of flour. I will not make these again.

I thought these were great!  They taste just like banana bread - I liked them so well out of the oven that I did not even make the frosting.  YUM!

If you want a cookie that tastes exactly like banana bread, then these are the cookies for you. The texture is a little off, but they're tasty. Add some chopped walnuts or shredded coconut for a bit of pizazz.

Yum! I really liked these, and so did everyone else who ate them. I added twice as much banana, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe turned out just ok for me.  It was most likely because I used regular shortening and omitted the vanilla because I didn't have any on hand.  I did use 2 very ripe bananas, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Still, it seemed rather bland to me.  Definitely bread like in texture which is good, but something is off about it.  A good recipe to play around with.

These cookies were excellent.  Very moist and cakelike - exactly as picture shows, so no surprise.  Only changes were to use all butter because I prefer to use butter in baking.  Also half white, half brown sugar becuase I only had enough for 1/2 cup of white.  Used 2 bananas - perfect amount of banana taste.  I found that not greasing the cookie sheets (although the recipe calls for it) resulted in puffier cookies that didn't spread with less burnt edges.  Also I refigerated dough and cookie sheets as I do with all cookies in between batches and only baked for 8-9 minutes.  No icing even needed, just simple dusting of powdered sugar was perfect.  Overall, great recipe and will make again!

These cookies are very good; I meant to add some nuts, but forgot.  Nonetheless, they turned out well and are delicious.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful alternative to banana bread.  It made use of some extremely ripe bananas I had.

Halved the recipe, used the one large, overripe banana I had and butter instead of shortening.  The first thing my almost 4 year old son said when he tasted one was- "These are muffins!"  They are the exact texture of a muffin, so don't expect a typical cookie.  They are tasty though!  Great with my morning coffee. :-)

These are so good! They taste just like banana bread...but they are cookies! The first time i made them exactly as the recipe says, then the second time i did half whole wheat flour, half all-purpose flour, half sugar and brown sugar, without glaze(they don't need it!) Overall a nice recipe.

Wow!  I was not expecting these to turn out as well as they did.  They do not taste like your traditional cookie, but are FANTASTIC.  I used 3/4 cup shortning and 1/4 cup butter in place of butter flavored shortning.  I also thickened up the drizzle somewhat with powdered sugar.

YUM! Taste just like banana bread. I used half whole wheat flour, butter instead of shortening, 2 bananas, and added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and nutmeg. Very good! Cover these or store in a ziplock so they stay soft.

Very Good! After reading reviews I made changes including using 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup shortening, two bananas, and half brown and half white sugar. I also added 1 tsp baking powder in addition to the baking soda and used 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 3/4 cup white flour. They were cakey and not at all flat. For the icing I used almond flavoring because I used up all the almond in the dough and it came out great. A nice change of pace and a new addition to the recipe box.

This is a very good and very easy cookie. Keeping in mind the other reviews, I used very ripe 2 bananas - the skins on mine were very brown - so the flavor was full and sweet. I compensated for the extra moisture in the banana by adding 1/2 cup more flour. I also added 1/2t each nutmeg and cinnamon. I also used 1/2C butter and 1/2C shortening instead of the butter flavored shortening. I kept the batter, which is more like quick bread batter than cookie dough, chilled and then baked in a 350F oven... the cookies did not spread. I used parchment paper so I did not grease the sheets, which can contribute to the brown edges, but I suspect these cookies are sensitive to slow oven temp. Be sure to preheat your oven well and check that your oven's internal temp. is actually 350F. The frosting/glaze can vary in texture - thicker can be lightly spread on top, thinner can be drizzled; add the milk slowly, adjusting the amount used to get the consistency you are looking for. Frost/Glaze the cookies after they are cooled so the icing makes a pretty top on the cookie and does not soak into it. I sprinked ground pecans over the icing before it hardened for a fancier look. Thanks for a great recipe Molly.

As the other reviews noted, use 2 bananas and add some nutmet and cinnamon and this will come out great!  It's great for breakfast as well as for snack.  It's probably best to try and make 2 dozen or a bit over that to make the right size and fluffiness.  Anything less will make them flat.  I would definitely make these over and over again!

These are addictive!  1-they are so easy to make and 2-they are so tasty!  I've made them numerous times, my favorite is to use cream cheese frosting and sandwich the cookies together with the frosting in the middle.  I had trouble with the frosting recipe included here seperating, but they are equally as good with no frosting at all!

I liked the taste of these cookies but like other reviewers, mine turned out very flat.  The batter was thin and not like cookie dough.  I thought it needed more flour but I followed the recipe.  The extra flour would have probably helped.  Good taste though.  Kind of like banana pancakes.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I followed it precisely, and the cookies came out flat and way too soft.  I don't mean "chewy soft," but instead, they were unpleasantly soft.  It was a waste of ingredients because I ended up throwing most of the batch away.

Delicious!  I made these without the frosting because my family doesn't really like frosting.  They were very moist and just wonderful!  I love the cake-like texture.  An excellent use for that one left-over banana.  Nice strong banana flavor.

I took someone's idea and made "bars" instead of cookies and it ended up more like bread than anything.  Still, it was really tasty and everyone who tried it like it.  I also doubled the amount of banana used and added walnuts.  I would recommend it.

I really loved these cookies.  They were so easy to make, and they tasted incredible.  I didn't really like the icing.  It had a really good flavor, but I couldn't get the consistency right.  I might try a different one next time.  Very good cookies.

Good cookie. I added a cup of mini chocolate chips and used two bananas. They were almost cake-like cookies. My husband liked how they "sucked up" milk. They do not flatten. Good alternate use for leftover bananas, but no replacement for banana bread.

These are great cookies.  I made them for a christian womens meeting and they were the first cookies gone.  Dough freezes well.  I did add about 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and used walnuts instead of pecans because it was what I had, I also used a little more nuts, about 3/4 cup total.  I drizzled the icing on instead of dipping.  Will definately make many more times.

These were good, but had more of the consistency of banana pancakes.  But when the frosting soaked into the cookies, they tasted better by far.

Cookies are very good. Batter makes a lot, and I doubled it, so I put half in a square baker and made bars.  My 3 year old son and 9 month old daughter loved the cookies!

I just made these last night. Im not sure why everyone else says they are flat, mine puffed up quite a bit actually. My only "complaint" is that they are not overly sweet, tempting me to eat more than I should :)

I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and miniture chocolate chips into the ingredience and it added a little spice to the cookie.  The cookies turned out flat so definately either add more flour or cut the butter in half. But overall, they were a hit.
