This was one of the best squash soups I have ever had!  Full of flavor due to the curry.  I used chicken broth - not the coconut milk - and it was plenty rich, and I could taste the coconut oil.  Garnished it with a dollop of plain greek yogurt, and served it alongside a kale salad with toasted pecans, dried cranberries, pomegranate seeds, crumbled blue cheese, and balsamic!  Great fall/ winter pairing!

I thought this was delicious!  Tastes a lot like butternut squash soup I've made.  Great to know I can also use banana squash.  Love it topped with a little sour cream and toasted sunflower or pumpkins seeds.

Added a dash of Tarragon in the absence of enough bay leaves when I doubled the batch.  Leftovers didn't last long, but were even better once it sat in the fridge overnight.  The flavors came together beautifully!
