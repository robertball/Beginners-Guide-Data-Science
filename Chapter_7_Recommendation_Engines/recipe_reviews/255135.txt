Made these as an appetizer on Christmas day, and everyone inhaled them!  They were delicious, and the red and green colors were perfect for Christmas!

This is a brilliant combo of flavors and textures! I found this recipe via an ingredient search & am glad to have stumbled across it. My husband who is iffy about goat cheese, enjoyed these. I feel so fancy making the balsamic reduction :-D ha-ha! Thanks for the idea, I would love to make these again for a party platter at some point in the future.
