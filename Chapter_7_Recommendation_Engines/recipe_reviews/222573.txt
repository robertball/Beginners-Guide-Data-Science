This recipe is wonderful!  You can add and subtract probably any or all of the vegetables as long as you follow the dressing recipe exactly.  I think the secret to its wonderful flavor is bringing it to a boil.  Also the flavors really need to marry overnight.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a hit. I tend to marinade overnight and then pour it in the strainer to drain the extra fluid. I have gotten creative with ingredients adding apples , pineapple with the juice instead of the sugar radishes or whatever I have.

This recipe doesn't sound like it would be so delicious but it IS.  My friend made it for a BBQ and I haven't been able to stop making it ever sense.  Substitute Chickpeas for the wax beans.  We used tortilla chips to dip.

I really like the dressing for this salad. I used green beans garbanzo beans, red kidney beans, chopped green, yellow and red pepper. Also added chopped red onion. It made a nice color presentation. Will definitely make again.

Love this and it has received very positive reviews.  Great for barbecues.    I do make a few changes, though: 

Canned butter beans instead of wax beans. 

Frozen corn and peas (two cups each) instead of canned.  This counteracts the temperature of the dressing if you haven't had time to cool it totally, or it sort of self-chills the salad.  Plus I like the flavor/texture better.

I changed this up a bit - using Red Wine Vinegar and Maple Syrup instead of the White Vinegar and Sugar. Definitely better after 24 hours in the refrigerator. Definitely a good base recipe that allows for modifying based on what you have available at home.
