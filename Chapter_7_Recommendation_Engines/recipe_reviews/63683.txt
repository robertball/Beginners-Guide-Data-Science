strong garlic flavor, and no salt.  It didn't have the right flavor.

This was a good dish.  I added about 1/2 tsp of chipotle in adobo sauce to the salsa - I'm addicted to the smoky flavor!  Overall, a satisfying and fairly quick endeavor.  I would definitely make it again, next time adding a little salt to the frittata.

I added 5 fresh mushrooms and 2 artichoke hearts to FRESH spinach to the pan, in place of the frozen spinach.  I topped with Queso Blanco instead of Mozzarella Cheese because Queso Blanco has a bit more flavor.  This was perfect!  Wonderful taste and a nice breakfast change!

used canned salsa instead.  bit too much spinach for my liking but the salsa helped to make it less bland.

This is a tasty recipe.  I made it with fresh spinach, about half a bag of spinach salad I had left over that I would've thrown away, so this was a great way to use it!  I heated the oil, tossed in the onion and garlic and sauteed for till soft, then added spinach and cooked down.  I used Egg Beaters egg substitute (1/4 Cup = 1 egg), whisked with salt and pepper and subbed 1/3 Cup cottage cheese for the evaporated milk (didn't have the milk).  Cooked on the stovetop till eggs were mostly set but wet on top, then topped with mozzerella and some quartered cherry tomatoes.  Put in the oven for about 7 minutes, removed, let stand for a bit and then served.  My mom and husband loved it!  Will definitely keep this recipe handy.

I made this recipe last Christmas and it was requested again for Easter Sunday.  I doubled the Salsa recipe and we still ran out.
