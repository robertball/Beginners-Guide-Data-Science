This requires more cooking time for the flavours to become friends with each other; and also for the kale to cook and the chick peas to soften a little.

A++++
This recipe is AMAZING!!! I do agree with one of the other reviewer's, this recipe does require more cooking time. Especially for the potatoes to get soft. I did change 2 things. I used fire-roasted tomatoes instead of regular diced tomatoes. I couldn't find garam masala, I used Shaan Chana Masala from the Indian Store and I think it worked out fine. I paired this recipe with rice. I will definitely make this over and over!!!

This stew was delicious! I used the ingredients search tool to find something where I could use the kale and cilantro I had on hand. I was so happy to find this healthy and tasty stew. I substituted carrots for the potatoes and I added a can of chicken broth instead of tomato sauce (I loved that this made the stew more soupy - and I didn't have any tomato sauce). I didn't have any raisins, but I'll try that next time. The curry seasonings were so good. The cilantro on top added the finishing touch. I'm starting to really appreciate kale. Thanks Mari.

I added more of what I had (spinach instead of kale) but kept the initial recipe intact and loved it. With the leftovers the next day,I added carrots,more spices and canned lite coconut milk! WOW! Great recipe!

This is an amazing recipe!  I did have to cook it longer to soften the potatoes, but it was delicious and I will definitely be making this again. All of the spices combined with the sweetness of the raisins created a wonderful flavor.

Amazing veggie food.  It takes an extra bowl, but it still fills you up because of the potatoes and chickpeas.  Very flavorful, and great as is, but I'd imagine it's a great side to a meal or if you tossed some meat in it'd be just as good or better.

Yum! I'm attempting to eat healthier and incorporate less meat into my familyâ€™s diets. Recipes like this make it easier for sure. I forgot the cayenne and didn't have cilantro and it was still great - the flavors were complex and delicious and even the hubs thought it was a satisfying meal. Will make again for sure!

This was great-- I used a quart of home-canned crushed tomatoes and some homemade "rotel"(with plenty of roasted pablanos) instead of the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, used vegetable broth instead of water, and sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. I also omitted the raisins.

Fantastic vegan recipe!! Made this stew according to the recipe, only slightly reducing the amount of raisins and cilantro (because I was low on the ingredients.)

i was looking for a soup recipe that was nontraditional as i had been sick for a few days and was getting tired of the same old chicken noodle/veggie soups.. i was intrigued by the spices and mostly made this for the broth.. my modifications were to use one potato, two carrots, two stalks celery, half a large red and green bell pepper, add some fresh slices of ginger, omit the tomato sauce and raisins, and instead of adding water i used chicken broth, i subbed three bone in skinless chicken thighs for the chickpeas and spinach for the kale--which i had forgotten to add until i was down to the last two bowls of soup, along with the cilantro.. doh!.. even with all the changes i had to make for what was left in the house, this came out tasting very good and gave me something fortifying to eat while trying to recover from this nasty cold.. ty for the recipe

Superb. This recipe is so delicious. I followed it exactly except I threw in a can of hominy just because I had it and wanted to use it up. I also doubled the garam masala since I added extra ingredients.  It made 7-8 servings for me and I look forward to eating every one. Tomorrow I want to make homemade naan to go with. I wanted to give this six stars. Delightful and soul satisfying. Bravo.

I really liked this. I bought kale for the first time this week and used it also with bacon, potatoes and garlic - not as healthy as this recipe though. Kale is hearty eating and with the potatoes in this recipe its a meal in itself... It seemed to be missing something for me so i added coconut milk but i don't think thats it .. needed a little natural sweetness from somewhere .. I will definitely try it again though.

Was looking for something very delicious and different. Wow! Did this fit the bill!  Sauteed fresh jalapeno in with the onions and garlic for extra punch. Used one and a half fresh tomatoes as I didn't have canned. Used curry and other spices but not ground coriander as I didn't have, but also added Thai spice blend that I had in my pantry. Used regular raisins, not golden. I used four potatoes, but they really needed a lot of time to get soft. (Maybe time differs with types of potatoes?)  Threw in some frozen carrots for extra eye appeal and to balance the spices.  In any case, this was my first recipe ever cooking with kale. Loved it, loved it, loved it. My vegetarian son gives this two thumbs up! A keeper and one that will be integrated into meal rotation! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I both really liked this, and it will be in our regular dinner rotation now. It made more than four servings, so we had more leftovers than planned. Not a problem, though, as this reheats beautifully.

Very tasty!  I made a few changes.  I had some left over eggplant/tomato/zucchini stuff left over so I chopped it up and threw it in also.  It didn't get 5 stars in my book because the potatoes needed cooked more.  Next time i would cut them a good bit smaller or plan to cook it longer.  I thought the greens were really tough.  Next time I'll either use canned or precook the greens.  But my biggest problem with it was that the we had left overs, and the next day the raisins turned into mushy little balls.  I think next time I'll just had a few to everybody's bowl and not to the main pot.  I think it does need the raisins.  They were tasty the first night.

We LOVED this recipe! Took some others advice and cooked the potatoes longer. We didn't add raisins or cilantro but it was still fantastic.Great way to use the super food kale. Next time we will try sweet potatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is really an incredible recipe. The spices are great!  I have made it 3 times and serve it with naan.   The recipe does take longer than it says, as others mentioned, but that's okay because it's worth it.  I also love adding eggplant to the mix.

Amazing! Made a few changes; used half sweet potato & half white. Will use even more sweet potato next time. 
I doubled the curry powder & due to the fact I used sweet potato I omitted the apricots & used half the amount of raisins. 
Omitted the tomato sauce & used my favourite veggie broth. Used fresh tomatos in place of canned.
My only regret is that I did not double the recipe. My kids ate 2 bowls full & there were no leftovers.

This recipe is amazing!!! The flavors and textures are all exquisite!  The kale adds a nice green color to the red of the tomatoes and the white potatoes and chick peas. I am not a vegetarian, but do enjoy a good vegetarian dish with North African-type spices. This one I will definitely make again!

This dish was spectacular!  Great flavor and perfect amount of spice!  The raisins are delicious in here.  I made some rice to go along with it and fed this to my one-year-old son who gobbled it up.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious, and a great way to use kale! I used only one potato, subbed chicken broth for tomato sauce, used chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned and added more chopped garlic and cilantro. Only other change I'll make next time is to double the recipe!

We don't live in a place where kale is available, so we had to omit it. Otherwise we followed the instructions (also added a carrot, which was a nice addition) and really liked the flavor and mixture a lot. As an afterthought we added chopped dried apricots, which often seem to be included in such Moroccan dishes. We'll make it again! Thanks for sharing.

I made this in a pressure cooker.  I did the chick peas on the bean setting by themselves (from dry) for 15 min. Then with all the ingredients for 15. I did not use kale, instead put in green beans.  The cilantro makes it just amazing.

I made this almost exactly as it said. As noted by others the potatoes need more cooking or should be diced smaller. I added salt and used fresh tomatoes. Two things I might change next time is the ground corriander - I will try crushed corriander seeds. And the garam massla can be very different depending on the exact mix of spices and where you buy it. I prefer to try making my own mix so that it is possible to change the spices. Other than that it's great and the taste gets better every day.

I make this frequently for large groups. It is very flavorful. Iâ€™ve substituted spinach for kale when I havenâ€™t had it on hand. People have often asked for the recipe.

Delicious. Did take about double the time to make this. I didn't have Garam masala so I found a recipe to make it and had most of those spices on hand. Served it with homemade pita chips covered in zatar spice. Yummmmm. This one's definitely going into my permanent recipe book! At first hubby complained about no meat in it, but afterward lived it even without the meat.

A bit too sweet for my liking but overall an excellent recipe. I added 3 cubed slightly browned boneless skinless chicken thighs and used only one potato. I couldnâ€™t find garam masala and omitted the curry powder too but added tumeric & cinnamon instead. Next time Iâ€™ll use half the amount raisins.

We really loved this. Only thing I changed was vegetable broth for the water, and didnâ€™t add any salt with that addition. We ate with a bit of freshly shredded parmesan cheese on top and crusty roll. We didnâ€™t find this bland at all. I could see how adding some Italian sausage to this would be a bit more filling. It was perfect for a cold winter day. Next time I will cut the Cayanne pepper back because it was too spicy for my tummy.

Prep time took longer than I planned. Since I cook for myself as wife wonâ€™t eat vegetarian, I had no big hurry. Let it cook about 15minutes longer. I found it onolicious. Leftovers were good over rice.

Made this recipes as described with the exception of cilantro (cilantro tastes like soap to me), in addition I added two cans of garbanzo beans to increase the protein, I also used vegetable broth in place of water. The taste was exceptional and it was not too hot for my two year old grandson. This will be a regular in our dinner plans!

I made this exactly as specified. It's a very good, healthy stew. The flavors are definitely low-key, and it needed a bit of salt, but I will make this again.

Really delicious, great way to use Kale when it is the cheapest green at the vege store.  I only used one large potato & added a couple of Zucchini & about a cup of crown pumpkin cut into pieces ( the grey skinned type Kiwi's & aussies eat as a vege) I forgot to add the raisins & didn't have any cilantro so just garnished with parsley.  Instead of Tomato sauce I used approx 1/2 C pasta sauce(from a jar in the fridge). I added a little vege stock powder to give the water a little punch.  Will definitely make again.  Just ate in bowls without couscous , thinking of putting the leftover in a pie.

This is a good dish. It just seems to be missing that little something to send it over the top and make it really great. Obviously I cut some of my potatoes a bit larger than Â½" cubes and it took an additional 8 minutes to cook (23 total). Everything else was cooked just right, including the kale. I was a little generous with most of the spices and maybe the answer is just not to hold back and add a little more. It's a personal preference and I love lots of flavor. Like with many dishes, this might also be better the second time around. I think that with all the potatoes, chickpeas, tomatos and sauce, that the seasonings might need to be increased a bit. That's exactly what I will do, the next time I try this.

Well it is on the stove simmering and it smells great. Only item I did not add was the raisins since I did not have any. Will serve it over couscous for vegetarian Monday :)

Left out the cayenne and had to cook it probably twice as long as it said to get the potatoes cooked. So yummy. My big kids and hubby loved the raisins in it.

I had to improvise a tad on this recipe, using dates instead of raisins and a few other changes, but the result was a full flavored hearty stew. A nice blend of sweet, spicy, and savory.

This recipe was just ok. I substituted yams for white potatoes, and, combined with the garam masala, it was on the sweet side.  It was also heavy on the potatoes, so it didn't taste very substantial.  I would substitute lentils for chickpeas to absorb some of the liquid and increase the protein portion.

really, really good. we made some subs, because my husband is a wimp and doesn't do cayenne (left that out; put in 1 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes). The coriander in our house seems to have disappeared so left that out as well. doubled the garam masala, and the curry powder, added 1 c unsweetened coconut milk instead of water. We used fire roasted diced tomatoes, which seemed to add some depth. Also, we added the chickpeas with the potatoes and cooked the whole thing twice as long.

Absolutely delicious! I find it is a recipe that you can do a lot with and experiment. For instance, instead of using diced tomatoes and kale I put in salsa and spinach, scrumptious! I also found it took a bit more cooking time than the recipe stated.

Awesome dish. We use half sweet potatoes and half white or purple potatoes - the sweet potatoes compliment the bitterness of the kale. Add some carrots and sautÃ© for a half hour (or a bit more with a double recipe). We serve it over rice and double the recipe since we love leftovers for easy lunches. Delicious!

Agreed, requires more time for the potatoes. Also, it needed some slow cooking at the end to reduce down the sauce, too much water for my liking (didn't add any extra water at all).

Otherwise, it was delicious. I left out the curry powder, garam masala and cilantro, substituted cranberries for the raisins, and used red potatoes and yams. Good blend of flavors; it was spicy and hearty, with sweetness mixed in. The kale added a nice texture and bite. I could easily eat it by itself.
