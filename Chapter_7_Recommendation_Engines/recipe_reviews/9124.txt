I made this recipe for my family for Thanksgiving and we all said, "Mmmmm - these potatoes are GOOD!!!" 
Would make a nice anytime-of-year comfort food! :o) Thanks for the great recipe.

I cant even count how many times I have made this recipe, its one of my favorites! 

My tips... cut the butter in half. Using the full amount tends to make it a little oily especially with all the chesse. 

Mix the sauce and leave in the fridge at least overnight, the potatoes soak up most of the sauce. 

Then a few hours before I cook it I let it warm up on the counter. The potatoes cook much better and melt in your mouth if they arent frozen when you bake them.

Great recipie, a new family favorite. I cut the butter in half to cut down on the grease. I also like to make the mixture and let it sit in the fridge overnight so the sauce can soak in. I have found that the potatoes dont fully cook and  sometimes stay hard if you cook it right away. And of course it reheats really well in the micro or my skinny husband throws a little butter in a frying pan and cooks it that way which is really good too!

ok, I give up. Tried it twice because of great reviews. The potatoes were gummy, not creamy. Even added more cheese the second time..cheese looked curdled like scrambled eggs. Even tried 2 different brands of frozen hash browns...

The best!  My entire family loved this recipe!  It disappeared so fast.  I may make it sometimes with some ham in it, so we don't have to have a meat separate from  this dish.  (Oh, or chicken. Yummy!)

I love this!  It turns out very creamy.  I also added some shredded cheddar to top, about 1 cup.

Hmmm - I don't think this was all that wonderful.  Tasted like boxed potatoes au gratin.  I think with some tweaking it could be much better.  Maybe some canned soup instead of the half-&-half, or different cheese?  I don't think I'll make this again.

I found this rather bland. Don't think I will every make this again unless I make drastic changes.

When I first saw this recipe, I thought that it couldn't be that good, it was just too simple.  There weren't any onions or spices.  Well, I made it anyway because my boyfriend loves hashbrowns, and oh my gosh was it good!!!  It was so creamy--it tasted exactly like my mother's homemade au gratin potatoes--EXCEPT 10 TIMES EASIER!!  It was very easy to prepare and absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this recipe again--lots of times!

The flavor of these were a bit bland, but they were very creamy.  I topped them with cheddar as others suggested.  My one drawback was that they turned to a very mushy consistency-my hubby compared them to cheesy mashed potatoes.  May have to play with this one a bit.

I made this recipe and served it with meatloaf.  I was searching for a recipe that called for ingredients I had on hand - and I was in luck when I found this one!  It was a snap to mix up and we ate it all - a good sign of a good recipe.  I agree that it is best to add some salt and pepper but I always like to let each person season for their tastes so it's not necessary to add while baking.

This is absolutely the best cheesy hash brown recipe I've ever had and to top it off it's soooooo simple!!!!!  I made 2 9x13 pans of it for some hard working farmers along with mock filet mignons and came home with about a spoonful of potatoes left over!!!  I did cut down on the amount of butter like other reviewers.  This is a definite keeper!

My grandsons said it was good! I followed the recipe as directed, except I added frozen peas & carrots to the potatoes.  After it cooked for 1 hr I removed the foil as instructed then sprinkled shredded cheese on top  & cooked for 15 minutes.  The casserole is almost gone.

Made this for a different potato to serve with steaks.  It was a hit with everyone.  Most thought it tasted like Macaroni and Cheese.  I changed some of it because of the ingredients I had in the kitchen.  I used Velveeta Queso  cheese and then sprinkled cheddar on top.  I also added sea salt and course ground pepper.  It was easy to make and we will be having again!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I used store brand shredded cheddar cheese and for the butter I placed cut pieces of softened stick butter throughout the dish. Can't say enough good about it.

I rated at 4 only because this was more scalloped potatoes than cheesy potatoes.  The flavor was excellent!  I made some changes...I didn't have frozen hashbrowns, so I diced potatoes then boiled them for a about 5 minutes.  Then I added the cheese mixture (I used cheddar).  I also used milk instead of half and half.  Next time I would cut the milk and butter in half.  Good recipe, but I'll make with my changes.

Really, really creamy.  If I were to change anything, I would add a dash of salt.  It's the best potato dish yet!
