There are a lot of steps to this recipe but it is so worth it. The sauce is amazing - you have to do it anyway ! I did make it the day before because of the complications and it work really well. On the night of the dinner when my guests arrived I just put it under the broiler for 6 mins. I had put the whole thing together on the baking sheet in my fridge so I just pulled out 40 mins before to get to room temperature before broiling

Fun to make and delicious to eat.  Instead of lemon zest, I added a couple dashes of lemoncello  to the sauce (from the glass that I was sipping, of course!)  Magnificent!!  Will definitely make again.  A wonderful appetizer for a company meal.

In place of tarragon, add herbes De provence to mixture. Used single baking dish, layer bottom with Jasmine rice, then mushrooms followed by scallops. sprinkle smoked paprika on top.

This was absolutely wonderful for a Valentine's dinner with my DH. I did not change a thing. The flavors melded perfectly with main star of the dish, the scallops. This is a keeper.

Awesome wonderful, I got rave reviews for this one. Make sure you have the full 10 inch distance when broiling I did not and it was almost a disaster

This recipe was OK....but a lot of dirty pans were created, and it required a lot of steps.  Certainly not an easy recipe to make; taste was fairly good, but nothing to write home about -- or rave about.  I think in the future I will stick to the simpler recipe I have used in the past with great results.  OK....... I will admit I've become a much lazier cook as a retiree than I was in my 'youth.'

As I live in the middle of nowhere, shallots are hard to come by. Instead, I chop up a bunch of green onions and a "generous" amount of minced garlic (I prefer shallots), use a dry sherry for the wine and portobello's for mushrooms. I've used various cheeses for the topping and top that with crushed Ritz cracker crumbs 
All that aside, this is my favorite meal of all time! I've made this on dive trips in Baja.
The picture I've posted of it is an empty 'dirty' plate, because once it's done, I can't do anything until it is consumed, It's THAT good!

I am not a scallop person but my husband loved this recipe.  He enjoyed the flavor and that it was  something 'different' than the typical breaded version.  Next time I will cut back on the lemon zest (his preference) but  otherwise will follow the directions exactly  (minus the shells--I just threw them in a stoneware pan).   The recipe itself sounded harder than it was, and was actually kind of fun to make.

This was delicious. Made exactly as written, only with dried tarragon. Even the left overs reheated in the oven were awesome. Will make many more times! Watch the video chef Johns soothing tone will take away any anxieties you have over a difficult dish! Haha

One of my favorite scallop dishes,  I had not made them in years, but after I bought a large bag of beautiful frozen scallops, I had to revisit the recipe, it didn't disappoint.

I made this sauce for whitefish (ling cod) with a few variations because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. It turned out wonderful!! Instead of shallots I minced purple onion and added 1 tsp of minced garlic. I substituted evaporated milk for cream but I will make sure to have the cream next time, I don't think it changed the flavor but maybe the consistency. I also used shredded Parmesan instead of Gruyere. I served it with garlic rice and peas, it was amazing and my family loved it.

Absolutely one of the best sauces I've ever had!  Please ignore any comments saying to substitute the tarragon, that is an absolutely essential ingredient for this recipe.  It wouldn't be anywhere near as good without it.

This recipe is perfect. I made it as is, but I used little cast iron pans, prepared everything ahead of time, and waited for company to arrive. Once they did, I popped them under the broiler for six minutes and then served them with crusty bread. It was the quietest dinner party we've ever had. No one spoke until their food was gone. I'll be making this again (and probably again).

I made this meal for my honey on Valentines Day, 2018. She loved it, as did I. I served with a rice pilaf that worked very well. I used Slap Ya Mama in place of cayenne. I cooked with wine and used some in the recipe. A keeper. Thanks.

My Wife and Mother In Law made this for me as a surprise knowing that I love this dish (and most anything Scallops).  To put it simply..........It is the BEST I have ever had and our entire family loved it. Our 13 year old twins have already requested that we have it again...........and who am I to argue :-)

Deluxe! I added a touch more cayenne the second time, just a pinch. Made it for a couple of dinner parties as an appetizer and everyone loved it! Will keep this one handy.

Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious! My husband just said, “let’s split one of the extras, I want more”! The only change I made was leaving out the tarragon. It would totally overpower the wonderful flavor of this dish!

I made this exactly as written with no additions or substitutions and although it looked and smelled wonderful, it had such a strong taste of wine that it was not pleasing to the palate.  We ate it all, but I would not make it again unless I substituted chicken broth or water and cut out 1/2 the wine.    Disappointing to say the least as I wasted 10 beautiful scallops!

Awesome dish.. loved the sauce... i made this as a main with an alfredo pasta, both the wife and i agreed the alfredo was not needed. In fact she got up, discarded the pasta and added rice, absolutely loved it. 

Great meal, she made me promise to add it to our menu.

Absolutely loved this dish. It’s easy and doable for any novice cook. I didn’t have the scallop shells to cook them in, instead I used a  large stone cupcake  pan, worked perfectly!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. I got a great many dishes dirty in the process so it is not a quickie.

Great presentation of fresh diver scallops.  The pound of scallops came out to 10 nice large divers.  The sauce was fabulous with the mushrooms.  I didn’t use Tarragon as I am not a fan, but the cream mushroom sauce was all that was needed.

I used Panko crumbs and Parmesan (didn't have Gruyere) mixed with a little butter as a topping, and shallow individual baking dishes since I didn't have shells. Halfway through eating I realized I'd forgotten the tarragon and lemon, but the flavors of wine, mushrooms, and scallops balanced so perfectly that I'm not sure it needed anything else! I'll have to try again to find out... :-)

I made it with half & half & no egg,  I also didn’t put it into the oven with cheese. I poached the scallops a bit longer, and served it over the mushrooms & shallots on a plate, topped with sauce. I tasted pretty wonderful! Willldo again with rice??

This dish was amazingly delicious and not difficult to make.  I followed the recipe exactly but instead of serving in shells (which I didn't have), I simply used my oven proof Tuscan blue dishes from Southern Living...still a beautiful presentation.

Personally I don’t find it to match the description of one of the most delicious foods ever, but it presents very well and when I’ve made it a couple of times for parties I got great responses.

These were incredible.  Yes, they were a bit involved to make, but that was fun and the results were entirely worth the effort.  I loved them, my  husband loved them and our guests loved them!  I would highly recommend this recipe!
