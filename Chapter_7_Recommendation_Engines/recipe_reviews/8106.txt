First of all, it was way to sweet.  I used the half of the suger in the cream cheese mixture but still it was way too sweet.  Secondly, it was very sticky and just really heavy.  The the "dough" created by the chocolate cake mix was really hard so that it was almost like a dry brownie.  I cannot believe that this is the 5 star recipe.  I will never make this again but I would use only ONE cup of suger in the cream cheese mixture but  use two eggs in the cake mix instead.

I can't imagine what I did differently from the other reviewers, but I was not impressed with the filling of this cake.  I normally love cream cheese filling, but this turned out runny and WAY TOO SWEET.  The cake base/pastry is wonderful, I would concoct a different filling, one more in line with a cheese cake filling that is not so runny and not so sweet.  This smelled much better than it tasted, in my experience with it.

This is a very rich delicious chocolate cake.  We eat it with ice cream and it tastes great!

Yes, it was a simple recipe but I agree with some of the other reviewers-this cake is not all that amazing to me. Way too sweet and maybe the cream cheese mixture is supposed to be runny and sweet but I didn't care for it. I'll make a few adjustments and try again, but I was over all disappointed.
