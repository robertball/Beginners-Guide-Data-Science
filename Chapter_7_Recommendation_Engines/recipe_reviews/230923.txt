These were awesome!  I love the idea of skipping the deep frying, that just makes my house stink, and not to mention the fewer calories.  I used a mini muffin pan and pre-baked the wontons so they would be crispier.  I didn't add the mayo because I love cream cheese and I added a dash of worchestershire, old bay and garlic.  Will be making these again!!

If you kick this up with some Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and add Old Bay seasoning to the mixture or on top and add some canned baby shrimp, a squeeze of lemon, dash of worcestershire, hot sauce to taste and you have yourself a HUGE HIT~! People rave for it! You can use your favorite dip recipe of whatever kind in these cups and it all tastes great!

It's a great idea to bake them! Although i made them with cream cheese, green onion and artificial crab meat they still turned out as great little appetizers!

I used  regular cream cheese not Neufchatel and didn't use any reduced fat products.  I  used 4 oz. canned crab meat, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/3 cup purple onion chopped fine.  I  egg washed four corners and pinched them together.  Baked them  at 375 for 18 min.  Very good for being baked!  Made 3 dozen.

I made this recipe without any changes. The edges were crisp from the first baking; however, when baked a second time with the filling, the bottoms were not crisp.  I would make these again, but welcome suggestions about crisping the bottoms. The filling was delicious.

I love these. I use low-fat cream cheese and usually skip the mayo and throw some Old Bay, garlic powder and sometimes cocktail sauce in there. Whatever I am in the mood for!
