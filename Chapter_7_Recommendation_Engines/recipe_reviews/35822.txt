14 oz. of unsweetened chocolate is really too much. their is not enough sugar in the recipe to off set that much chocolate. the finished cake was very bitter.

This cake had an absolutely delicious flavor, but was embarrassingly dry... I don't know what I would need to do to fix that.

Horid, horid, horid!  I am very sad I wasted the ingredients.   A deeply flawed recipe that didn't make it to the second bite.  Do not waste your time.  Dry, bitter, not even the jam made it palatable.
