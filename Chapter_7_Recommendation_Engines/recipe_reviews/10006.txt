i made these cookies today, and personally i think that no sugar cookies should have nutmeg in them! No offense though. everybody has different tastes. the dough had a very good texture!

I made these yesterday...and today...they are a distant memory. Fantastic and Delicious. Easy to make and disappear like a magic trick. I replaced the butter and shortening with margarine. So soft and chewy.

Despite the shaped cookies in the picture and the review that said the dough had a good consistency, these cookies are a batter cookie, not a dough cookie... in other words, they cannot be rolled out and cut and are a sticky mess to try to get on the baking sheet... flavor wasn't bad (I swapped the lemon extract for orange and ditched the raisins) but far too much of a hassle and not what I was looking for...

Wonderful cookie! I skipped the raisins. They were a huge hit, even had people ask for the recipe. Very good cookies!
