This is very easy to do and it was great! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ instead because that is what I had and everybody loved it. I had none left. Thanks for the recipe

Oh My God ! This recipe is absoultely delicious. I have to admit that I chopped up an onion instead of the red pepper and also added two cloves of fresh minced garlic to the mix.  Also I think it needs about 2 cups of BBQ sauce. One cup of sauce made it be a bit to dry for my like. But then again that's just my personal preferece as I like my foods juicy........... FABULOUS

This was very good.  The whole family loved it.  I made a few changes.  I couldn't fine Bob Evans Wildfire BBQ sauce.  Perhaps it is not sold in Western Canada.  My kids don't like things too spicy anyway so I used Kraft Original BBQ Sauce.  I also used 2 cups of BBQ sauce rather than the 1 cup called for.  I omitted the red pepper but added 1 small minced yellow onion, 3 minced garlic cloves and a pinch of salt and pepper.  I also increased the water to 1/2 cup from the 1/4 cup called for.  With the changes I made this was loved by all members of my family.

While my family and I really liked the recipe, my wife noted that it "lacked a little kick".  We both agreed that a pinch of salt and pepper is needed.  I realize this is probably basic, but we stuck to the recipe fairly closely.  The onion was a great substitution as well as double the amount of BBQ sauce!

This was pretty good.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce because that is what I had on hand.  I also used onion instead of red pepper and added some apple vinegar to the mix prior to pouring it over the pork.  The only real complaint I have is that it wasn't saucy enough for me, but that was easily remedied once the pork was shredded!  :o)  Thanks!

This was very good and I really enjoyed it. The only reason i give it 4 stars is the flavor cooked out of it a lot. I would add more BBQ sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's (as others) because it's what I had, but I would add a little more next time because I like very flavorful things. I also used an onion instead of the pepper. I will make it again! Easy and yummy.

Easy and Delicious!! I added onions and a little salt and pepper on the meat and veggies. I couldn't find Bob Evans BBQ sauce so I used Kinder's hot BBQ sauce.  Worked out great! My husband said I need to make it again... soon!!

This is the best pulled pork recipe I have ever had! The only changes I made were using chicken broth instead of water and using KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce instead of the Wildfire sauce. AMAZING!!!

Wonderful.  I used Sweet Baby Rays regular BBQ sauce because Wildfire is not sold out where we live.  Followed the suggestion of using 2 cups of sauce and did not regret that decision.  My husband thought the regular bbq was a tad sweet still so next time we will try a different sauce with a little spice to it to drown out the sweetness.  Side note:  The recipe states it will feed 12 people, we got 9 normal size meals out of it and the pork was the listed weight.

This is now requested by my kids. I add an onion and some extra sauce depending on the roast I use. I also switch up the BBQ sauce. Thanks for the recipe.
