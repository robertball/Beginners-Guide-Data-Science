Made these this morning and they were yummy! I only changed a couple things because I didn't have some of the items--substituted milk/vinegar for the buttermilk and whole wheat pastry flour for the cake flour. I liked the flavor a lot--just enough spice and not too much. I'll definitely be making these again!

Best pancakes I've had in a long time. Served with real maple syrup and added caramelized pecans sprinkled on top. Definite do-again.

This is a really great recipe! The only changes I made were, I use regular flour because thatâ€™s what I had, and I added cinnamon because I really love cinnamon and we also did half a batch with chocolate chips!

I followed this recipe exactly; the pancakes were soggy and really thin.  The problem I realized later was the proportion of liquid ingredients to flour.  The amount of buttermilk to dry is nearly equal, and when you add in the pumpkin it makes the batter entirely too wet.  This prevented the pancakes from fluffing up and developing a good substantial texture.  To make this recipe work I would recommend reducing the buttermilk to around half a cup.  I will say that the flavor overall was good.

These were amazing! The texture was light but still had substance. Perfect amount of pumpkin and spice flavor paired wonderfully with real maple syrup. Halved the recipe for 2 but otherwise followed exactly. Real buttermilk vs milk sub makes a huge difference in pancakes.

Just polished these off. The whole family loved them. Used regular milk, was not aware of the vinegar trick, but they still turned out great. My 6 and 3 year old wanted seconds, and they never ask for seconds :)

I add more flour, maybe whole wheat, or some cornmeal. They were very well received. I'm wondering if adding blueberries would be too much? I couldn't tell the difference between the time I separated the eggs and the time I didn't...used sour milk instead of buttermilk. Used cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg for pumpkin pie spice. Makes enough pancakes for 6-8 people.

These are entirely too eggy and not light and fluffy.  My boys love pancakes, so they did eat them.  But we won't make these again.

Light and delicious!  Used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached white.  Needs some spice--added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of cinnamon.

These pancakes are such a treat! Like sweet pumpkin bread for breakfast but much quicker and simpler. I have, every time, seperated the eggs like suggested, however in a pinch I'm sure these would be just as delicious with the eggs whisked in whole. Very good recipe.
