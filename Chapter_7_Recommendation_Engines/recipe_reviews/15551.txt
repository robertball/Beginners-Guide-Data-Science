Okay, I cheated.  I used a box of frozen fully cooked meatballs.  However, that sauce is to die for!  A really nice change from our standard sweet&sour bottled sauce.  I put the frozen meatballs and sauce in the slow cooker on low and they were ready 4 hours later.  A double thumbs up from this family.

This is a huge hit in our home, especially around Super Bowl time. My girlfriend gave me this recipe before looking here online. Instead of using the lemon juice, I use 1 cup of pineapple juice. Excellent! If you like the pineapple chunks you can use those as well too. PS - I do cheat though! I've made the meatballs from scratch but I've found the frozen meatballs to be similar in taste and much easier! I throw everything in a pot and put it on low. In 2 hours I have every man's favorite.

Warning: These meatballs are addictive! I made these for a Christmas party at work last year, to which a co-worker said, "You should call these Really *bleep* Good Meatballs!" He even asked if he could have the leftovers. Very easy to make; very yummy to eat! Don't wait for a holiday... this makes a great dinner too!

Easy and delicious!  Took minutes to put ingredients together, cooked for 4 hours on low in crockpot.  I tripled the recipe, used about 3 pounds of frozen 1/2 ounce meatballs.  Believe it or not, 9 people consumed all 3 pounds of meatballs (people were unashamedly going back for third helpings!). I've never produced anything as popular as this dish from my crockpot.

I only rated this 3 stars because not cooking the meatballs first made for a greasy mess.  The sauce is very good, but I would seriously advise you cook the meatballs first, and drain them well, if you're going to use homemade meatballs.  Otherwise, I'd do as others have suggested and use precooked, frozen meatballs.  I prefer to make my own, however, as I know exactly what ingredients are going into them and knowing that there are no preservatives used.

I prefer to make my meatballs with half ground beef and half pork sausage.  It adds to the flavor, but you have to brown and drain before cooking them in the sauce.  I also added some dijon mustard and garlic to the sauce to the cut the sweetness a little more.  Made them recently for a cocktail party and everybody raved about them.

I too cheated and used frozen meatballs. They are good and a great time saver. This sauce is really good and soooo easy to put together and throw in a crock pot.

The chili sauce in this recipe adds an extra "kick" that you usually don't find in traditional meatball recipes.  They are a sure crowd-pleaser.

DELICIOUS 
Made 2 1/2 lbs today, cooked meatballs with egg and bread crumbs. I added a small can of crush pineapples, can of cranberry sauce, 6 ounces each of chile and grape jelly. Meatballs did not faLL apart.  When forming the meatball, fill small cup with water and lightly dip hand in water and roll meatball.  Coming from an italian familY, this is my mothers way of preventing meatballs from falling apart

These meatballs received rave reviews from guests and I ran out quickly. So easy and so delicious! The only thing I'd do differently is that I'd make a larger batch.

I used premade meatballs, dumped them in the crockpot frozen with the sauce and they cooked up just fine in the time allotted. Could not have been easier. I thought a bit bland, but very popular at the adult birthday party!

Great recipe, but recipe should include the following information:  Cook your meatballs in the oven first before adding to your sauce and use the Heinz chili sauce. I bought Asian garlic chili sauce at first. Luckily I tested a small sample and figured out I had the wrong chili sauce.  Finally, the meatballs need to cook for about 3 hours in the sauce so that the flavor will be absorbed into the meatballs.  The end result was excellent!

The base recipe is great--for an even greater dish, saute minced garlic, minced onion, and minced bell pepper before adding the chili sauce and grape jelly.  Add sriracha (Thai hot sauce) and rice wine or white vinegar (I added both) in a small amount.  Cook together to blend flavors.  I also added cooked carrot puree, cooked butternut squash puree, and cooked cauliflower puree because husband doesn't eat vegetables.  Undetectable!  I added ketchup to the meat mixture before making meatballs and substituted onion powder for chopped onions (unless you saute the onions first, they will never get hot enough to become soft).  I baked the meatballs and added to the sauce in the pan--picky husband loved.  I have been looking for a great sweet and sour sauce for ages.  This is it.

The flavor of this dish was good - I had to use cherry jelly since that was what I had on hand and it turned out flavorful. My suggestion for the future is to brown the meatballs by frying them or broiling prior to placing in the slow cooker. The fat that rendered out of even extra lean hamburger was gross and I had to let the dish cool in the refrigerator and skim off the fat as it hardened.Eating hamburger grease is not high on my list of healthful choices. Fat layer aside, this dish was tasty.

I've made these for years.  A tip...once I picked up grape jam by mistake but didn't have time to go back to the grocery.  Well, the jam mixes in with the chili sauce much faster and smoother than the jelly, so it's what I use now.  Always a hit!

Plan to try this recipe over the holidays.  Sounds great to me!!  Also, I think anyone who uses pre-made meatballs is insane and lazy.  They are disgusting, full of chemicals and would make ANY recipe taste bad!!  Can't wait to try these with REAL meatballs.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I have made this same recipe for almost 40 years. It's always great. I usually just heat the sauce in a pot over medium heat, throw the meatballs in, cook for about 45 minutes.

These were fantastic! Although I did use frozen meatballs as I was pressed for time for a afternoon gathering. The leftovers went home with my daughter and her fiance, and he hoovered them up in a flash! Super Simple to make, toss everything into a slow cooker and in about 4 hours - PRESTO! Thanks for the AWESOME recipe, will DEFINITELY make again! Will be great at Christmas time for those inevitable get togethers!

I have made these but used jellied cranberry sauce in place of grape jelly and had a little extra tang.  They were less sweet than with jelly.  Also added some cooked rice.  Family cannot wait until they are done.  I don't use a recipe, just add this and that!

I have been making this recipe for years (sans lemon juice) and it is always a crowd pleaser! I always have people asking me, "Are you bringing your meatballs?".  

If you don't have time, you can always use the frozen, cooked meatballs and you just have to heat them through. You can let them thaw in your refrigerator for a day or cook longer if frozen.  I use 3 jars of chili sauce and a 2 lb. jar of grape jelly to a 6 lb. bag of meatballs.  If you find it too sweet, you can always use LESS jelly.  

You really cannot mess up this recipe. My husband was helping once and mistakingly grabbed a jar of cocktail sauce! The horseradish in the cocktail sauce really gave it a unique twist.  

I have even had people ask me if they could have the sauce after the meatballs have run out.

These are the best, so easy and so often requested!  I do not always add lemon juice....no need really.  I bought frozen meatballs once but, really prefer to make my own with my recipe.  They are so much better and cheaper.  I bake my meatballs and then throw everything in the crock pot. Making enough today for my grandson's first birthday party and 30 guests tomorrow.  Son and DIL have been begging me for a month to make them.  :)

I love this recipe, but really, there is no benefit to slow cooking the meatballs. And it's a must that you brown them in a skillet first. So, I think a bit better way to make them is to prepare the meatball mixture, (I use ground turkey in place of beef to lighten the calorie and fat content and really, they are just as yummy), roll into balls and brown in a skillet. Remove browned meatballs and set aside while you pour off the grease, but leave as many "brown bits" in the pan as you can. Then, to this skillet, prepare the sauce, add the browned meatballs and simmer for about 30 minutes or until meatballs are cooked through. Easy and delicious!! (And you only used one pan for the whole dish - yay!)

The sauce smelled great, however, the meatballs fell apart in the slow cooker and the whole thing was watery and soupy.  The sauce may be good on its own, but next time I would try using frozen meatballs or cooking the meatballs ahead of time.

I had some left over homemade cranberry chutney, so I used some of that instead of the grape jelly. Very yummy.

This is amazing, it's an easier version (and spicier) of my polynesian meatballs. I did half and half ground beef with pork sausage, I think I'll always do it this way. I put a 12 oz bottle of chili sauce and a huge dose of Siracha sauce in it. I was concerned the meatballs would fall apart but they eventually firmed up in the crockpot. This time I think I'll add a half-cup of italian bread crumbs. I will also add a can of chunked pineapple at the end this time, and serve it over white rice. Incredible! You can adjust the jelly or chili sauce to taste obviously for those that said they didn't like the flavor. (NEVER use frozen meatballs they can't even begin to compare!!)

My mother used to make this recipe back in the 60's. It was always a huge hit with everyone and a staple at every holiday get together. I personally always thought it was a little on the sweet side. I started using 12 oz of chili sauce and 6 oz of grape jelly and that made it a little less sweet. Glad to see that the recipe is still out there after all these years.

I was a little bit skeptical about this recipe, as it seemed a little TOO easy, but I tried it out at a work potluck (and yes, I cheated with a box of premade meatballs as well), and they were a HUGE HIT.  Super simple!  Definitely give this recipe a try!

I haven't made these yet, but have made similar.  I too, would pre-cook the meatballs.  350 degrees for about 10 mins.  Make the sauce on the stove top, then mix all together in a casserole dish and bake in the oven until sauce is bubbling.

I have been preparing this since 1967 from The Elegant But Easy Cookbook.  Everybody always enjoys them.  One difference in this recipe is that the original one calls for 2 lbs ground meat.  After I cook the meatballs, I slice up 2 lbs of beef hot dogs and add them to the mixture.  It can be frozen at this point.  Handy to have in the freezer.  Adding the hot dogs doubles the amount and there is plenty of sauce for all.

Sooo good!  I used 2 lbs. of frozen meatballs from Costco (I think they were chicken teriyaki meatballs), along with the chili sauce, grape jelly & lemon juice.  I made them for our holiday potluck at work, and they went FAST!  No leftover meatballs for us.

The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly, but I made the meat balls smaller to accomidate my tastes. The sauce was okay at best.  It was very thin and I almost tasted the grape, which grape jelly is pretty gross in my opinion. (the only reason I tried the recipe was because my husband talked me into it.) The meat balls also fell apart.  I read the reviews and took someone's suggestion of using 1 cup of pineapple juice instead of the lemon juice and I thickened it a little with a flour water mixture. This made the sauce unbelievable! Then, I made my stand by meatball recipe and put the meatballs and sauce over egg noodles. The whole dish was transformed into an amazing dinner that I will repeat time and time again.

My sister thought I was crazy when she watched me make this!  The combination of jelly and chili sauce is odd, but so good!  BTW, my sister went back for thirds!  Thanks!  A great dinner on a cold night.

OK-so I cheated as well and used frozen cooked meatballs from Costco..that being said 5 stars for the easiness and the delicious sauce.  Will keep this recipe for future parties or potlucks.  I cooked on low for 4 hrs or so and they were perfect.  Tossed on some toasted hoagies and sprinkled mozz cheese on top...MMMMMMM!  Doesn't get better than that.  Even the kiddies enjoyed and asked to have again the next night.

If you think this is good (which it is), try substituting Smucker's blackberry jam for the grape jelly.  It takes it to a whole other level.  I tried this when I needed to make it in a hurry and realized I had the wrong jelly.  Try  it and I bet you rate it at 10!!!

Pretty good.  I added one personal sized cup of pineapple tidbits to the sauce (with juice).  Served over white rice.  11 year old daughter loved it!  I thought it was better the second day as leftovers.

Yum! I used frozen meatballs, baked them according to the directions on the bag, blotted them to soak up the excess grease, and then added them to the sauce in the crock pot and let it all blend and warm for a few hours. Made a delicious appetizer and I plan to make these again!

I used frozen meatballs because it's so much easier!  So...I did not know that the chili sauce was the stuff you find in the ketchup aisle. I therefore ended up using the Thai Chili sauce you find in the ethnic foods aise. This was SPICY in a serious way! Everyone loved it. The other way is yummy too, but if you want to set yourself on fire, make the same mistake I did!!

We didn't care for these at all.  
I won't be making these again.  The crockpot dried out the meat way too much.
I did like the flavor of the sauce.  If it was cooked in a saucepan I may have liked it better.

This recipe is perfect as is for excellent appetizers.  My family has been making these exactly this way for many years to great reviews.  Nowadays if we have time we make the meatballs - if not we use the frozen variety.  No one really knows or cares.  And these are not just for appetizers anymore.  We also love these with mashed potatoes and boiled cabbage on the side.  Thanks, Tammy for a great recipe!

This was a huge hit. The only issue was i should've quadrupled the recipe for the party.

Like others I used frozen meatballs and tripled the recipe...some reviewers said they were too spicy,I am not a fan of spicy food. Let me tell you these are not too spicy and they taste fantastic. I'm taking them to a party later but I'm having a hard time not eating them all right now.  So easy to make. Will be a regular recipe in my kitchen.

I've been using this recipe for years, not just as a party appetizer, but also as a main course. I have used frozen meatballs and made my own but my own are by far better (but obviously more time consuming). I usually add chopped fresh parsley and minced garlic to the meatball mix and if I have it, some dried cumin.  Also, for a main course, I spoon the meatballs and sauce over egg noodles and serve with a nice side salad.

I admit I used store bought meatballs. But the sauce was fabulous and so were the meatballs! Quick and easy and perfect for any event. I really thought the sauce would be overly sweet and to my surprise it really was just right.

Getting ready to do this for a second family reunion and they disappeared the first time so making a double bunch!   Added a little hot turkey sausage....very little.....and put a cranberry in the middle as a surprise:
Big hit!  Made them about 3/4" each as an appetizer with picks.  Fun recipe!

This recipe was really, really good,even my picky teenager liked it. After cooking the meatballs, I removed them from the pan, drained most of the drippings then sautéed onions, snow peas & celery (what I had on hand; was wishing I had water chestnuts too) until tender, then returned the meatballs to the pan and added the sauce. Outstanding!

this was top notch, I used Hot chilli sauce and followed the recipe from scratch. 
Could not stop sampling while the rest of supper cooked. I think you could use any chilli sauce you like, hot or otherwise, any brand.

This was a total hit at our house...not a common thing with 7 people to please.  I did take some hints from other reviewers and added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard to the sauce.  I doubled the sauce, added a large bag (like 90 balls) of frozen meatballs, and cooked it all for 4 hours on low in my crock pot.  I served it over rice and watched as the family licked their plates clean.  (Really...some literally did...which gave us a chance to discuss manners.)  I will definitely make this again!

Why would you give a recipe five stars if you don't follow every step and use only the ingredients suggested??? UGH.  This recipe is super simple and tasty, AS IS.  Kids and adults really love it - it's perfect with pasta, rice, or biscuits.

Made these for an open house earlier this year and got rave reviews from everyone.  They will now be an item served at ALL my parties.  I doubled the recipe (I too used frozen "party" meatballs), dumped everything into a crock pot and let them simmer all day.  A Very Big Hit!! and so so EASY!

I have been making these meatballs for over 35 years - my son's birthday is New Years day and I always had a buffet that included these meatballs.  I added a little horseradish to mine.  Delicious!

I was surprised this turned out good. This was quite awesome. A friend of mine hates meatballs but she ate every last bit of it and then demanded I make it again soon. ^^ So this recipe is a definite keeper.

Loved the recipe. Super easy and a real crowd pleaser. The sauce is truly amazing. I know the whole grape plus chili sauce sounds weird, but trust the recipe! It is goooood! The only thing I did differently was to bake the meatballs in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes.

I have made these a few times already.  I cheat and get the frozen meatballs.  The beef and the Turkey meatballs taste great, hardley notice a difference.  These have been a huge  hit each time, and now I've been asked to make them for our superbowl party.

These were so delicious!! I didn't have lemon juice on hand so I used pineapple juice instead and the sauce was really good! I like many other reviewers also used frozen meatballs in the crockpot on low for about 4 hours. They turned out perfect, will definitely be making them again!

These are always a big hit. I do usually pre cook my meatballs first. I usually bake them for about 10- 15 minutes then throw them in the crock. Makes a great appetizer or  for dinner with white rice.

The first time I made these, I did make the meatballs from hand.  Now, I just use frozen.  Great recipe!  Also good if you don't have a slow cooker; last night, I just threw everything in the cooking pot and cooked it all together, bouncing between low and medium heat (I didn't want it to simmer TOO much).  Great!

Thanks for the quick and easy recipe I needed to find!  Used frozen meatballs because it was a last minute request to bring something to the party.  Put evertything together and cooked on low for 4 hours.  Doubled the recipe and used about 130 frozen one inch meatballs.  All were gone within a few hours.

Too sweet for us.  I used bottled chili sauce, but if I made it again I would try my own.  Either that or reduce jelly amount.

I made this recipe once for an anual family potluck.  I was told to not attend again unless I had this recipe with me.  The grape jelly throws everyone off I think.  My co-worker said it sounded gross so I brought her some and she retracted everything she said.  For the chili sauce I used 'Maggi Chilli Garlic Sauce' and for the Grape Jelly I used 'Western Family Grape Jelly' (if you live in Canada - Yes I live in Canada) then Western Family is from Save-On-Foods or I'm sure any grape jelly will do.  I hope everyone enjoys.  

P.S. - This recipe is REALLY spicy using the hot sauce I recommend.

I am very fond of this meal.  It's easy and fun.  My kids and my husband like it well.  The only thing I do differently is that instead of making my own meatballs, I buy the Italian style meatballs.  They are perfectly seasoned for this dish.  I also like to make these meatballs for appetizers with toothpicks inserted on each one for easy pickup.

I liked this recipe.  I think it was a good base for what I was going for, however it could use a little tweaking.  I found the sauce a tad bit too "sour" but that can be played with.  Over all, I enjoyed it.

Made this recipe for my son's birthday party and it was a hit. I made the meatballs a few days before and cooked the sauce on the stove the day of the party. I added it to the crockpot with meatballs and it was great. Will be making again and again!

I worked at Kohls' for Christmas and we had employee food to bring in for our fellow co-workers.  I used frozen meatballs, and contrary to a few people, am NOT lazy by using frozen meatballs.  I DID not use lemon juice, but used two tablespoons of Teriyaki sauce, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, AND put in 1/4 cup of Rasberry Reisling!!  Needless to say, these meatballs FLEW outta that store so fast, and the crock pot was wiped DRY of ANY sauce, that if you wanted to, you could have put that crock pot on the shelf & sold that as new!!  THE ENTIRE dish was a HIT, and I too had fellow employees and managers asking how I made this.  The women in the store were FLOORED that a GUY could cook so well.  A definite keeper for certain.  If making for a large number of people, definitely use a larger quantity of meatballs, and don't be afraid to make more sauce--it WILL NOT go to waste.

Thank you for this recipe, super easy and unbelievably tasty. Im a single living with 3 fast-food loving roomates. Thr most they have ever cooked is reheated fast-food in the microwave. We made a large meal serving 20 and needed something delicious. I decided to take my chances with these meatballs. Our guests were dumbfounded. I have a guy coming over to me like, bro u gotta tell me how u made this, its so darn good. I didn't tell him because chefs never tell their secrets. I listened to another person and put in pineapple juice I also added a bit of ketchup and a tinge of soy sauce. Wow it was good. Thanks.

longer they sit on in crock pot the more they glaze & better they are. I used pre-made meatballs. Sat in the fridge to thaw before putting in sauce.

Delicious! I like to spice up my meatballs a bit more and saute the onion with garlic before mixing into the meatballs. I always bake my meatballs to drain the fat (even extra lean)which, is great for large batches. I liked the use of cranberry jelly too. I don't own a crock pot but maybe I will soon. Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this recipe many years ago in a paperback version of a Better Homes & Garden cookbook I had purchased at a news stand. It was and continues to be a big hit with my family as well as coworkers and friends whenever I have taken to a potluck or holiday gathering. I have even used the sauce on the mini hot dogs and people have liked them as well. I have substituted jellied cranberry sauce for the grape jelly sometimes too...both sauces taste great!

i have tried this receipe many ways...to answer that person in Australia. Jelly is like Fruit spread, like a jam. i have used cranberry sauce, orange marmelade, honey anything of that sort. i have also used homemade meatballs and frozen. This combination is always good but i do add garlic and some red pepper flakes for a little extra zing. Not too much, just a pinch of pepper and about a clove of garlic minced. Party appetizer, or main dish, this is always a hit!

These meatballs were pretty good, in my opinion, although my husband it not care for the sauce.  I made my own meatballs, which barely held together long enough to put in a skillet.  I browned them, basically to get them to "stick" in a ball shape.  Then I baked them for about 20 minutes.  I put them in the fridge overnight and placed them in the crockpot this afternoon.  I would say that without browning them first, the whole thing would have been a big fat mess in the crockpot.  Using premade meatballs would certainly make the recipe quick and easy!  I served these with brown rice, pineapple, and a salad.

I made these for a pot luck function and people loved them (as did I)!  They were quick and easy to make.  I used a little bit less than a whole onion as I felt as though a whole onion was too much.  Also, I made turkey meatballs b/c turkey is what I had on hand.  I will definitely make these again!

Very, very good. I did use ground turkey, doubled the recipe and used a small can of pineapple juice instead of the lemon juice. I also added about 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs to make sure the meatballs stayed together, which they did. My husband walked in the house and said, "Mmmm, I can smell the pineapple!" We both thought they were worth keeping the recipe and rotating with other meatball recipes we love. Thanks!

This was so easy for a covered dish Christmas party I attended. The only thing I changed (by mistake) was I added about double the amount of lemon juice, it wasn't noticeable. Next time, I'll use half the onion, though, because it was a little too much for small meatballs.

Made these for my housewarming party. Made 5 lbs of meatballs, I ended up able to eat 1 (not 1 lb) 1 meatball out of them all. They were a huge success. The only substitution is we used meatloaf mix which is beef, pork and veal combined. Great flavor

I think this is a great recipe.  It comes together very fast but tastes like you worked all day.  I cheat and serve with a pre-packaged Teriyaki noodle packet as a side.  They work very well together.  The kids love them and hubby likes taking seconds or thirds as well!  :)

Made this for a work party-people loved them! Some changes: Use 2 pounds of ground beef and one pound sausage. Cook the meatballs first, then simmer in the sauce. Absolutely delicious and soooo simple! Thanks

I made these for a baby shower I hosted, and they were a hit.  I got lots of positive feedback, so I will definitely make these again.  I omitted the lemon juice and used premade frozen meatballs, so I can't comment on the meatball portion of the recipe.  Almost forgot, I also added pineapple chunks - SO YUMMY!

This was very yummy, and addicting. It is hard to get my 2 1/2 year old to eat meat, but he devoured these going 'mmmmmm' with every bit he took. I used thinly sliced green onions in the meatballs because I was out of onions. Also listened to some other reviews and added pineapple juice/chunks since the sauce I used was chili garlic sauce. Going to make them again with the regular recipe next time.

Easy, easy, easy and delicious.  I love using the slow cooker because it takes too much time to fry small meatballs.  I did use a bit of bread crumbs but sure recipe would have been fine without

My meatballs would NOT form.  It was just a lump of meat.  I have no idea WHAT I did wrong.  From now on I'm just going to buy them from the store.  It was a total disaster.  It ended up being pretty hilarious and everybody called it "sweet and sassy loose meat"

This is one for your recipe box! I overcooked them and they were still good. Im keeping this on hand so that I can bring these to a family gathering. We just ate them with a fork for dinner, and my worst critic, my 2 yr old, ate them without adding ketchup! That passes the test in our house!

This recipe was so tasty! The reason why I took off a star was because the recipe doesn't mention browning the meatballs first and so my meatballs fell apart in the slow cooker. Despite this, the flavor was really good and the meat cooked fine, I made a few changes. I seasoned the meat with some garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and bread crumbs and I also added some sriracha to the sauce to make it a bit spicier. Great recipe! Thank you!

Okay, I seen sweet and sour meatballs. It sounded like a great idea. I actually had 2 bottles of sweet and sour sauce. Figured I would make it a really easy meal. I made 2 lbs of meatballs, 2 bottles of sweet sour sauce mixed with 1 bottle of water, stuck in the crock pot for about 6 hours. i had errands to do. When I came home the house smelled so yummy. I put these over fried rice. Every one thought they tasted like salsbury steaks. Imagine that!  They were good. Not quite my cup of tea though. Now what to do with the leftovers. Since I had almost a pound of them left, just sitting in the fridge, I put them in the sandwich maker on hot dog buns with shredded cheese inside. Now all together wow... 3 stars for the metballs, even though I didnt use grape jelly, 5 stars for the leftover sandwich filler.  MMWWWAAHHH

I used a bag of frozen meatballs.

Substituted the grape jelly for sour  cherry jam and used 375 ml

Used a jar of this wicked spicy chili sauce 300 ml

And added a cup of heinz ketchup

Holy mother of G@d! Was awesome! What flavour! and smelled amazing!

Yay! Just like my mother's- yummy!!! Made these with my 3 year old's help and we loved them.  Had to cook a little longer than stated probably due to meatball size- but fabulous with rice.

My mom used to make this for us when I was a kid and I am so happy to have finally found  the recipe. I made the meatballs with ground turkey rather then beef and so I added about 3/4 c of bread crumbs to firm up the meat consistency.  Also, I didnt have time to do the crock pot thing so I browned the meatballs in the skillet, then added the sauce and let it simmer for about 30-45 min. and it still turned out soooo yummy.
Thank you so much for bringing this recipe back to me!

I don't know what happened, but we did not like this at all.  I didn't have any bottled chili sauce, so I made the sauce using the "chili sauce" recipe from this website.  It tasted fine.  
Then I made the meatballs following the recipe exactly.  The meatballs came out tasteless and had a strange texture, and the sauce turned into soup.

This was INCREDIBLE!  My kids as well as my hubby stuffed themselves!  I didn't tell them until later that I had used grape jelly in it.  (I didn't have any chili sauce, so I found a recipe for chili sauce right on this site and made my own.)  I might spice it up a bit more next time. 

They've already told me that they want me to fix this again!

I really enjoyed this.  I didn't have any chilli sauce, so I improvised with ketchup, taco seasoning, and water.  I'd give this recipe a 4.5 if I could just because I'd give it a 5, but didn't because my husband wasn't impressed.  He said it was good, but doesn't want it again.  I made it for dinner with some sides, but next time I'll make as an app for a party, and I KNOW it'll be a hit.

WOW, what a wonderful recipe. Unfortunantly I was not able to find regular chili sauce at the grocery, and had to get hot, if you are stuck with getting the HOT sauce, do not use the entire 1/4 cup, it is so spicy that it will make you drag your lips on the ground like a dog, and sure left the tongue tingling for some time.  This recipe is wonderful, but will have to send these hot one to the fire station with my husband, and I will make another batch with much less chili sauce.   Wonderful recipe.

We really loved the meatballs. We used a whole can of pineapple chunks instead of lemon juice. I also used the frozen meatballs and they worked out great.
Nobody could tell a difference. It was a HUGE hit in our house.

I received many compliments on these meatballs when I served them at my Super Bowl party. The only complaint I have is that the sauce was more watery than thick.

This was a hit at a potluck. I was hosting and a dozen people and made 3 dozen chicken on a sticks and 3 dozen of these meatballs ( sorry I used frozen). The chicken on the sticks were slow to go but the meatballs were out in no time. I used the 12 oz chili sauce, 6 oz of grape jelly and a couple of squirts of dijon mustard. so so good! i could have made 3 more dozens and they would have went.

Great Recipe. I used Kroger's Chili Sauce to make my recipe. It was super quick to make and easy to prepare. I won't admit it. But, I cheated. I used frozen meatballs. I would say that they have a different texture that homemade meatballs. So, next time I will make them from scratch. Also, I had some leftovers. so I put small amounts of them in ziplock sandwich bags. Then put in freezer bag. So I can reheat them (later) for snacks when the kids are hungry or after school.

I've made this twice....both times I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of beef. The second time I halved the onion amount which helped keep the meatballs together(also if you heat up the sauce in the slow cooker on high and then reduce it to low once you put the meatballs in, it hels keep them from falling apart). YUM YUM YUM!!!!....great served over egg fried quinoa :)

I cooked the meat balls first as others suggested and I was glad I did.  I fried them in a pan but since they are round they were hard to cook evenly.  Maybe next time I will cook them in the oven instead.

I love this recipe as you make your own meatballs. BUT I STRONGLY SUGGEST ALWAYS TO make your meatballs and brown them in a pan in stove before throwing them in the crock pot.

I thought the meatballs were dry and the sweet and sour flavor was awful. Maybe need to try a different brand of chili sauce but I think I’m going to steer clear of this one in the future.

These were definitely a hit.  I followed the recipe but found it a bit too spicy for my husband's taste.  In order to calm it down a bit I added a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks.  It worked perfectly and all enjoyed the flavor.  I would definitely make it again for the crowd

I've been making these for years, and here's a suggestion: you can use pretty much any flavor of jelly you like. My favorite is apricot jelly, but I also love strawberry, and have used peach, raspberry, plum, etc. Each tastes a bit different, but they're always gobbled down so fast it seems not to matter!

I have been making these meatballs for 20 years-never add the lemon juice-but you certainly can.  Absolutely MUST cook meatballs first!  Add cooked meatballs to crockpot--mix jelly and sauce together and pour over meatballs.  Cook on low until warm.  Delicious!

I used red current jelly and it's perfect. I let the sauce cook down and evaporate and get a little dark because of some browning of the sauce at the bottom of the pot.  It's better the next day when reheated.

I’ve been making these party meatballs for years but much simpler — Frozen meatballs, chili sauce, grape jam. 
I found the flavors don’t soak into the meatballs as well if you only use the crockpot.  So, do them in a stockpot on the stove the night before, in the fridge overnight, crockpot the day of the party for hot meatballs!

I've been making these for years! Tip:- Buy a box of M&M's meatballs for a start! (Any kind) Melt the jar of Welch's grape JELLY in a large pot on the stove, then stir in 2 bottles of Kraft chili sauce & stir until real hot!  Put the meatballs in the crock pot, pour the hot 'sauce' over them & set crock pot on high for 1 hour, then low for 3 - stir a few times!  Always a hit, and super easy!  Make great party food, and wonderful served for 'dinner' with mashed potato's and veg's. (Makes enough for at least 2 meals!)

The meatball sauce flavor wasn't necessarily to my liking--the jelly left an unpleasing aftertaste--so I added a scant 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce. Yes, I know this isn't the same recipe then, but my family enjoyed it this way. My sister asked for recipe and says will decide for herself if it needs the barbeque sauce.

This recipe turned out well enough but found the meatballs to be a little dry. I baked the meatballs beforehand as I didn't want any grease floating in the sauce. Next time will use my own meatball recipe with  this sauce which is really tasty.

Definitely Brown meatballs first or keep them in slow cooker for 4 hours at least. The meat balls tend to fall apart if not cooked first. Besides the browning adds a lot to the flavor. 
Good cooks never cut corners. Great flavor!

Made for a party.  I did use frozen meatballs but the sauce was so good.  A huge hit for the party, not one left.

I used the leanest ground beef you possibly can, or (b) buy frozen fully-cooked meatballs. Ultimately, I rolled my own and had to use the "high" setting to make it work alright. Even then, still rather greasy. Maybe if I follow (b) next time, I'll get more of the sauce and less of the grease.

I didn't use the slow cooker, just put everything in my braising pot for a couple of hours on low, added pineapple chunks and used frozen meatballs. It was okay.  I think I prefer homemade meatballs but for convenience, you can't beat the frozen.  Hubby really liked this and we both heated up leftovers the next day for our lunches which went well so will be repeating this one.  Pretty good.

Next time I make these, I'll likely brown them and drain the grease before putting them in the slow cooker.  Also, I think I'll up the savory flavor a little.  The jelly took over just a bit.  Otherwise, great recipe!

The meatballs were simply meat and onion, not much taste and the sauce was nothing great.

YUM! Definitely replacing the ones I used to make. I didn't make the meatballs. So much easier to buy them frozen from Costco.

I have never cooked homemade meatballs. I cooked them for dinner and they were sooooo good that I had to tell my son who DOES NOT like meatballs to save some for others and my mother who said they'd be nasty with ground turkey, asking me to cook more the next day. Due to my inability to find the proper sauce  and reading other helpful reviews about precooking the meatballs first, I tweaked my recipe a little. For the meatballs I used 3lbs of ground turkey, 1 grated onion and 2 large eggs. I baked them in the oven on 350 degrees until browned on both sides. For the sauce I used one 12oz bottle of House Of Tsang - Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce (from Target...so frigging good) and poured it over the meatballs and let everything cook until the sauce boiled. (NOTE: This sauce does not need to be mixed with lemon and/or jelly. Although I bought grape jelly I did not need to doctor the sauce as it already has a delicious sweet/spicy taste)  I served them with homemade mash potatoes and a mixture of sweet cream corn and fire roasted whole corn. There was no trace of food once plates were fixed. lol This will definitely be going in my recipe book that I'm building.

This reminds me of an old recipe that used to be really popular in the 1980's. The sauce was usually served with little smokies sausages. I tried the meatball version & liked it much better. I used the recipe from this sauce except I used a sriracha & ketchup mixture since I was out of chili sauce. It turned out spicy but my husband who is very picky thought it was awesome. I also baked my meatballs in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Cook time really depends on the meat used & size of the meatballs. I will definitely  make this again, & thanks for posting this recipe.

I went by the directions except I used jam instead of jelly and I added 3/4 cup of plain breadcrumbs. These meatballs are fabulous! To me, the homemade ones are a lot better than store bought. Go ahead and follow the cooking directions too: there's no need to brown them first!

I have been wanting to make this for a really long time! The grape jelly/ chili sauce combo is posted almost everywhere anytime you search for slowcooker meatball recipes. I liked the addition of lemon in this one. I added the juice of half a lemon, and minced 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce as well. Also made my own meatball recipe, which i just had to cook quickly for a bit in the oven to brown and drain some fat. I do highly suggest that these are browned and fat drained first. ..but that's a personal preference. I overall loved this dish, and i am not a huge meatball fan.

I wish I had read the reviews before trying this one. I made this recipe to spec; didn't change a thing. One thing I will definitely change is BROWN THE MEATBALLS FIRST and then drain the grease. Otherwise, you'll have a nice layer of fat hovering over the dish. Using a baster, I got most of it out but it could have been easily avoided. The meatballs sure were tasty, though. Will make these again but I'll be sure to brown next time. Thank you!

I followed the recipe to a T, the meatballs did not cook and I left them in the slow cooker on high for over 2 hours. Disappointing to open a meatball and see red/pink on the inside. We left them on low for another 8 hours while we went out to dinner, and they finally cooked, the sauce was good though.

I set the bar high for this recipe but it was less than par. I followed the recipe exactly. There was too much onion in it. The taste was bad. The sauce is just ok. But I am not making it again. I'm glad it was for my husband and I, not for  friends or family. I would be embarrassed.

These were a hit at a Cotton Bowl party for the Fightin' Texas Aggies! The recipe is super easy. I doubled the recipe for a larger group. The meatballs took only a few minutes to roll, and I was able to use grass-fed beef. I also baked them in the oven for 60 minutes at 350 degrees and then finished them off in a crock pot at the party. These are now my favorite appetizers to take parties.

The sauce is spectacular but if you are going to cook this dish make the meatballs from scratch because pre-cooked meatballs is a total waste of such spectacular sauce. It's great with pasta, great with rice, just DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

Made this for the first time....sorta cheated by using store bought meatballs but having said that, everyone LOVED them!!!! Simple, fast and tasty!!! We just added some french fries baked in the oven for a side dish. I will hand make the meatballs next time. The only advice Id have to give is to make sure you use as lean of meat as you can and if you need to precook and drain them, then by all means do so. Its worth the extra hassle.

Even easier, slightly different (and tasty):  Buy Trader Joes cocktail meatballs.  Mix 2 jars chili sauce with 1 or 2 jars of smooth currant jelly.  Mix in crock, toss in meatballs, cook a few hours.  DELICIOUS!   Great as cocktail meatballs with toothpicks, but also very tasty as meatball sandwiches!

I almost always try a recipe as is before I alter it to my taste, however I couldn't wait to try this one so I used what I had on hand.  First, I used ground turkey instead of beef, second I used apricot pineapple preserves instead of grape jelly.  I did decide last minute to brown the meatballs in a skillet before putting them in the slow cooker.  The balls, which I formed using a cookie scoop, didn't seem too sturdy and I wasn't convinced that they wouldn't fall apart.  They simmered for an hour and a half and the sauce still seemed kind of watery so I cranked it up to high with the lid off so it could reduce some for about 30 to 45 more minutes.  They were really yummy.  My hubby rated it a 9 out of 10 and insisted that he take some to his buddy.  I only got one :o(.  I will surely make this again, next time I'll try it as is.

I was asked to prepare "some food" for poker night at my husband's work and decided to do an array of appetizers.  Wondering what to do with meatballs I did an internet search for meatball appetizers and this recipe came up 9 times out of 10.  Who would've thought the bizarre sounding combination of grape jelly and chili sauce could turn out so delicious? But I figured since the recipe came up so many times there must be something good about it.  I too, used frozen meatballs, combined the jelly and chili sauce in a saucepan to melt the jelly first (otherwise you end up with little purple blobs in the mix) put it in the crock pot. It's SO EASY and yummy! Why mess with it? There was no lemon juice called for in the recipe I used so not sure what it's purpose would be but I would think that cooking the meatballs in the sauce would result in a fair bit of grease. If I was actually making the meatballs from scratch for this recipe I would definitely pre-cook them.

Ifound the grape jelly too sweet.  I use low sugar orange marmalade and find it excellent.

Not a fan of these meatballs. I love sweet and sour meatballs but this just did not taste right! I do however have a child who liked them but he would eat just about anything! I am surprised with the reviews of this recipe.

Nuked my meatballs a little to cook them a bit so they didn't fall apart.  Added pineapple chunks and juice instead of lemon.  Don't have slow cooker so I made it on the stove top.  Came out great.  Everyone loved them but agreed the meatballs were missing something... not sure what spice though.  Will make again.

Thought it was just fine. Went over big with the family. Served over egg noodles. Just an FYI, don't get a generic chili sauce, get a good brand. The junk I got from china-mart had so much vinegar in it, it just threw off the whole thing, had to tweak a little to cut that tang. I did prebrown the meatballs to give a good deep flavor and I did saute the onions to get a good flavor out of them. I will be making this again. Thank you Tammy for sharing.

I thought the sauce on these meatballs were delicious. But instead of putting the raw meat balls in the crock pot I think they would have been better if you cooked the meat balls first then put them in the sauce. Other wise It took to long to cook the meatballs all the way through and they start to fall a part, by the time they are cooked enough to eat. But all in all they were good (especially the sauce!!)

This recipe is fantastic! Even my picky 7 year old gobbled them up. I did cheat though and used turkey meatballs from my local store, but the sauce was to die for. Also I didn't use a slow cooker, (mine is too big) I mixed everything in a pot it still came out fantastic.

I've never made meatballs before but decided to try this recipe as part of the first xmas brunch I've ever hosted for my family. Big hit. I doubled the recipes, meatballs and sauce; but with 6 people they went within the first 20 minutes! Simple yet yummy! Will make again...and often! Thanks for sharing.

These were ok but the recipe should state that the meatballs need to be browned before going in the slow cooker. We put over rice and doubled the sauce. I also added brown sugar.

My family and I were not crazy about this recipe at all.  It's the flavors, the sauce is just too sweet, you can almost taste the grape jelly.  I won't be making this again for my family.

I recommend this recipe 100%.
Was easy to made and taste pretty good too.
The chili sauce I also did from another recipe from this website (as another person sugest on her comment).

These were pretty yummy. I just made the sauce and used premade meatballs from walmart. They were much better when I heated them up the next day. Next time I will make them with homemade meatballs and make it in the crock pot. I was pressed for time so I just simmered everything on the stove for an hour or so. Very tasty sauce. My daughter wants me to make it in a pork stir fry next time.

I was leery these would taste like the nasty premade artifical tasting cocktail meatballs people serve at parties but they were very good. I followed the directions exactly and was afraid the meatballs would fall apart without bread crumbs added but they held together well. Very tasty. I used Lauras' lean beef. I think if a fatty beef was used they would make the sauce too greasy.

Even now, as I am writing this review, I am eating these tasty meatballs. I did alter the recipe, and will probably tweak it again the next time. Here's what I did differently. I did make my own meatballs from scratch. Instead of using onion and egg, I used seasoned bread crumbs, onion powder, and garlic powder. Rolled them into about 1" balls, and got about 33. For the sauce, I have never dealt with chili sauce before, so I tasted it before using, and was not impressed. It tasted almost exactly like tomato sauce to me. So instead of using 12 oz of it, I used 8, and 3 oz of this Spicy Thai sauce I got from M&M's and love, and 1 oz of Frank's Red Hot Sauce. It added a lot more kick to the sauce, which is welcomed in my household. We also love lots of sauce, and this recipe yields A LOT of sauce, I almost dare to say too much. I think next time I will either make more balls, or only make 3/4 of the sauce, and probably a little less grape jelly as well. I served it over brown rice. It is enjoyable!

This is more so a review for the sauce then the meatballs as I cheated and used frozen lean beef meatballs (it was a hectic day). This sauce is quite good considering the few ingredients and I would make it again (maybe with homemade meatballs next time :))

Took this to a potluck at work and it was eaten up. I did find the recipe a bit on the bland side though. I added lots of garlic to the meatballs and sauce and also added a few dashes of tabasco sauce to the sauce as well. Good base recipe though that can be kicked up however you'd like.

A delicious, quick dinner if you have frozen meatballs handy!  To make it more healthy, next time I'll try cranberry sauce instead of grape jelly.

I just brought this to a Xmas party and people who didn't even like meatballs ate them. There were none left and others want this recipe. I store bought the meatballs (swedish meatballs). Either way I'm sure it will taste great.

These were very good.  They made for a nice appetizer for my guests.  They seemed to please everyone.

These are great, the first thing to go at my Christmas party, I added a little more grape jelly for flavor.
