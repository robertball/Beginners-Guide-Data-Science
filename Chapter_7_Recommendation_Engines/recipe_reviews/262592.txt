I love this dressing. I made just as it said, but I agree with the other review. I would blend all the other ingredients first then add the whip cream. I will definitely make this again!!!

Had to adjust the sugar and substituted Calamansi lime. Dressing was excellent and we used extra dressing as a dip for junk food

This recipe was simple to make, and tasted great. The only thing I would suggest, blend all the ingredients  together before you add the whipping cream or you will have guacamole flavoured whipping cream like I did. My family loved it.
