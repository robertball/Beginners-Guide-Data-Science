I used the refrigerated Pillsbury Classic Pizza Crust which I patted into a 13 x 9 pan and prebaked for about 7 minutes.  This worked really well since these are some pretty substantial toppings and the pan pizza held up well.  To speed up the process, cut your chicken into bite size pieces before sauteing with the bbq sauce.  I loved the mixture of bbq sauce and pizza sauce.  BBQ sauce alone would be too overwhelming so it was perfect! Used  combo of mozzarella and cheddar and left off the cilantro since I didn't think the kids would go for it.  My teenagers and my husband loved it!

I made this for my boyfriend, and although I was a little worried about how Sesame oil, BBQ, and marinara flavors would work, it turned out great! Much better than I had even hoped! This was very easy, and I'd definately make again. I used to the Boboli crust, and it seemed to be delicious. Buying it prebaked made it super simple. YUM!

Great pizza!!! I am a big chicken pizza type of guy, and this one didn't disappoint. Also, for a change, no alterations were really needed (that impresses me alone). Will definitely make this one again. . .
COOK REFERENCE: You like this one, try the Chicken Marsala Pizza (Inventive and to die for)

This was a great pizza!  I used 2 cups of mozzarella and sprinkled some Cheddar cheese on top too.  I would warn people to be careful when cooking the chicken w/ BBQ sauce---the sauce I used must have had a lot of sugar in it b/c it burned after about 5 minutes on one side.  I just peeled the burnt layer off and it still tasted great.  Just a word of warning!  The sesame oil gave a great taste, but we only used 1 TB and 1 TB olive oil so it wasn't overpowering.  Thanks for sharing!

I really think the combination of the pizza sauce with the barbeque sauce makes this recipe.  I have made bbq chicken pizza before and was overwhelmed by the bbq sauce flavor. This was the perfect taste and my family raved.  We will definitely add this to the pizza night rotation.

I thougth this was fabulous! I left off the onions (family preference), and I sauteed some mushrooms and added them. It was sooo good! I used the "Pizza Dough II" recipe from this site and cooked it alone for 10 minutes, then added toppings and cooked it for another 7 minutes. The crust was thin and crunchy (I only had a cookie sheet to bake it on), and it was awesome! My whole family loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

The name says it all! This IS unbelievably awesome. The only thing I do different is that I use pre-cooked chicken strips and I mix them with the BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) and sesame oil. I use one-third of the Pizza Dough II recipe(it makes 3 crusts) and bake it on a pizza stone at 500 degrees. Yum!

This pizza is actually unbelievable awesome!  My family loves it. It is part of our regular meal rotation.  The sesame oil and BBQ mix has a really unexpected but delicious flavor.  Per other reviewers, I sometimes put a little bacon on top, but not always it’s good either way.  I like to buy a 5 dollar ball of dough from the local pizzeria to make it quick and easy.  Try it you will like it.

Quite good. The sesame seed oil leaves an interesting flavor, and I liked the combination of marinara and bbq sauce.  I changed up the rest of the recipe to incorporate other things from other bbq chicken pizza - used colby/jack and green onion, and then drizzled more bbq sauce on top.  Tasted like a California Pizza Kitchen pizza!  Got rave reviews.

This pizza was simply amazing. Found 2 chicken breasts in the freezer and decided to make this recipe tonight.  I make my own pizza crust that worked great with this recipe,  I did cut up the chicken when I cooked it and found that it cooked much faster.  I have to admit that I did not measure the bbq sauce, I just added it the the fry pan.  Instead of the marinara sauce i used my regular pizza sauce but added the bbq sauce to it and WOW was it good.  Aslo added bacon to the pizza but omitted the onions as I am not a fan.  My mum couldn't say enough about this it was so good.

Simply Amazing! A hit with everyone in the family! Made this with Wolfgang Pucks pizza dough recipe: 3 c flour, 1 c. water with 2 tsp. yeast & 2 tsp honey, 1 tsp. sea salt, 1 T olive oil with dough hook on mixer.  Set out toppings(roasted peppers, red onion, mushrooms, chicken, tomato slices, spinach leaves) and let folks make pizza for one.  The sauce is absolutely to die for!!! DH says it's as good or better than the BBQ chix pizza we ate at Wolfgang's at DTDisney! Thanks Laura!

this was amazing. I made this and I am 13, it was so easy! my dad and I loved it. I did not use the sesame oil, though because I used leftover cooked chicken from the night before. I used Boboli's precooked dough.

Absolutely delicious! My husband ate half the pizza! For my taste I might add less BBQ and more Pizza sauce to the overall sauce for the pizza, next time. I sauted the onions in olive oil before putting them on the pizza and it added a nice touch as we prefer onions cooked. I also mixed some Italian cheese in with the Mozzarella and the flavor was great.Overall great recipe!

This is definately going to be a new quick "go to" dinner recipe for my family. They loved it.  I used a pillsbury crust rolled out very thin.  I used a leftover chicken breast that I shredded and mixed in a bowl with the barbeque sauce.  I pre-baked the crust for about 7 minutes (like another reviewer recommended).  I then added the cheese and the chicken (I left out the onion as my family doesn't like it) The cilantro was a nice touch as well.   It was Great!

Unbelievably awesome is right!!I brushed my chicken breasts with olive oil , seasoned with salt,pepper and garlic powder and baked for 45 min.@350 earlier in the day and let cool at room temp.When I was ready to eat ,I followed the directions the rest of the way.(Although I just sprinkled the top with dried cilantro instead of fresh).Definately will make again.I squirted the top of the pie with some Sweet baby ray's as a finishing touch.

Will definitely be making again! If you make your own crust, make sure and pre-bake it for like 7 minutes before you put on your sauce and toppings to make sure it gets done all the way. The combination of the marinara and BBQ sauce is wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

An awesome and yummy alternative to regular pizza :) I've made chicken pizzas before, but never thought of mixing the bbq sauce with the pizza sauce - I always just used a small amount of bbq sauce - and I think I'll mix the 2 sauces from now on. I also season and then steam boneless skinless chicken breast in the oven, rather than cook it in oil. Other than that, this recipe is perfect. I took another poster's advice and added cooked crumbled bacon to the pizza and WOW ^_^ Will be making this as an alternative to regular pizza from now on :)

Great recipe. I did mine on the grill and used rotissere chicken and Boboli crust and it was very easy. My family loved it and i used a little Boboli crust for our 2 year old and used traditional marinara.

I used Boboli crust and ragu instead of marinara. Other than that, followed exact recipe. It's great for a busy, working Mom. My husband loved it and is already asking for it again.

Just as stated, this is an unbelievably awesome pizza! I tasted barbecue chicken pizza for the first time about a year ago, and was surprised by how much I loved it. Since then, I've been looking for a great recipe to try to replicate that wonderful taste. Of all the recipes on here, this one came the closest to what I was looking for. I made it pretty much exactly as written, except I made my own pizza crust, (quick and easy pizza crust from this site) which I rose and than baked so that it could be pre-baked, just like the recipe calls for. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. Wow...it was amazing. The chicken was tender, with just the right amount of barbecue flavor, and the sauce was fantastic! My family loved it, and it was gone within minutes. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I'll be making it often!

I followed the recipe as written and found the marinara/bbq sauce was too runny. If I made it again, I'd cut back on the sauce.  I used a pizza crust recipe and made my own instead of the pre-made.  Prebaked in a 10" springform pan before topping the pizza and baking again made it much easier to remove.

Made this last night for friends....it is as good as others say. Wow! Carmelized the onions, added cooked bacon and red pepper as others suggested. As good or better as the high-end pizza places make.

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe. One reason I've never made BBQ pizzas at home was the overwhelming BBQ taste....I wouldn't have thought to mix it with marinara. To save calories, I omitted the sesame oil and cooked the chicken in a skillet sprayed with Pam. As another reviewer mentioned, my BBQ sauce started to burn, so I removed the chicken and sliced it while still raw so it would cook rather quickly. I used Boboli, which was great. I eliminated the cilantro (personal preference). Nest time I will use a little less sauce, and add more red onion. Thanks for sharing!!!

I make this all the time but leave off the onions. The chicken in the seasame oil is really great! Using a higher quality darker seasame oil (vs a lighter cheap one) makes a big difference in the taste of the chicken.

Thanks for sharing- great recipe. I also recommend adding crumbled bacon (everything tastes better with bacon). I also used a mix of extra sharp cheddar and mozz- (melts better with less oil). I substituted the chicken with pulled pork I made in the crock pot with a barbecue/beer sauce.

Can cut into smaller pieces and serve as an app for the Big Football game. recommend using less sauce so that it is not dripping on people and more of a finger food

This is delicious!! We added pineapples as toppings after trying that once at dominoes, and it definitely adds a fantastic flavor complement to the BBQ chicken!

This is a great recipe. Followed it right down the line and it came out great. The only thing I would change is step 1, instead of cooking the chicken in a skillet I would barbeque it, after all it's BBQ chicken pizza, and less messy than skillet cooking.

Really loved this pizza! The combo of mixing the BBQ  sauce into the marinara is genius- tones down the BBQ but you can adjust to taste. Already had leftover roast chicken so brushed the sesame oil on the uncooked pizza dough first (just store bought dough) and tossed cut cup chicken with ~2 tbsp straight BBQ sauce. Added sliced red peppers and substituted parsley for cilantro as I can't stand the stuff. So simple but really, unbelievably awesome!

Yummy!  I made personal pizzas on the gas grill using "QUick and Easy Pizza Crust" recipe.  Mixing the bbq sauce with tomato sauce is pure genius! I didn't have tomato sauce so I used pizza sauce and it was to die for.  Thanks!!!

Yes, this awesome...and so simple!  My only change was I grilled the chicken breast, chopped it, then tossed with a couple tablespoons of barbecue sauce.  Also, taste your marinara/barbecue sauce blend before you put it on the pizza.  The spices in the marinara might over power the barbecue sauce, and what would be the point of that?

Turned out so good! I left out the onion and bought dough from a local pizza place at half the price of the grocery store for a way better and bigger pizza. I will be making this one again for sure!

I really like BBQ Chicken pizza, however my husband isn't a fan of anything other than the ordinary, run of the mill pizza you expect when eating pizza.  The mixing of the bbq sauce and the marinara sauce, really toned down the bbq taste.  He liked that, I didn't.  Also, for the thin crust I bought to use, 15 minutes of baking time was a tad too long and it got overdone, but that is my fault.  Overall, I would have rated it 3 stars.  But since my husband liked it and the overdone part was my fault, I will give it 4.

We had never made pizza before, but we went to a party recently where they were GRILLING their pizzas...It was so delicious that we have been looking up new recipes, and ran across this one.  We use pilsbury dough, unroll it onto a greased foil that has been placed on a baking pan, spread it (carefully) thin with fingertips, then flip it over onto the grill, peeling off the foil.  Once crisp, hubby flips it and we pile on the goodies.  This recipe is savory and sweet and we have even served it to friends who enjoyed.

This pizza rocks! You must make this with Jay's Pizza Crust. The sesame oil added so much flavor to the chicken. I made Exquisite Pizza Sauce and added that to a bottled bbq sauce. Used 1/2 monterey jack and 1/2 mozzarella. Left off the onions and cilantro. Best pizza I've ever made. Delicious!

This pizza was wonderful. Gave it 4 stars because my husband and I thought that the cilantro did not go with this pizza at all. We ended up picking off the little flakes of cilantro to finish eating this pizza. The bbq sauce and the pizza sauce together is absolutely wonderful! Will make again minus the cilantro.

I make a very similar BBQ Chicken pizza, and it is one of my wifes favorite meals.  The only differences are, I sautee the onions, then add the chicken and BBQ sauce.  I use a little more BBQ sauce, a little less pizza sauce, and add a tablespoon or so of yellow mustard for just a little kick.

I made this for my husband, it was just OK.  He enjoyed it but didn't ask for me to make it again, which he always does when he really enjoys a new dish.

Great change of pace from the usual pepperoni pizza!  Substituted a rotisserie chicken breast.  Chopped it up, tossed it in a bowl with some BBQ sauce, then spread it over the prepared pizza crust.  Loved the BBQ sauce/marinara combo.  Easy and deeelicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.  If you're a fan of California Pizza Kitchen, the recipe is very close to their original BBQ chicken.  The only difference would be how you add the toppings.  
I'd recommend the recipe exactly as is.  Enjoy!

The name fits the recipe! I made two versions since we had company coming. One exactly as written and a second I personalized a bit adding bacon and mushrooms. Both had rave reviews. For the personalized one I added the onions and mushrooms with the cubed chicken and precooked it a bit. They absorbed the juice and sauce and were incredible. Thanks for the recipe. My wife keeps asking for it and my guests took the recipe home!

Awesome!!! Cooked last night, I did cheat!! Bought chicken already cooked, tossed it in sesame oil and barbeque sauce, used a thin and crusty already made pizza crust! Layered it with sauce, cheese, chicken, onions.  I just happened to have already cooked bacon, and then put more cheese on top!!  How EASY!!  and so delish!!  Thanks so much, will be making again!!  Thanks so much!!

I made the dough from scratch and instead this pizza came out delicious. It was super easy to make and very flavorful. I would suggest if you are making the dough from scratch cook it for a little less than recommend 25 min made it a little too crunchy for my taste would recommend maybe 20 minutes. Will definitely make again.

I thought this chicken had great flavor and texture.  I used a coarse grain mustard.  I will make it again using regular Dijon mustard- not to change flavor but appearance.  It put my kids off.  My son who loves chicken took a very small bite and said no thank you.  My step daughter didn't care for it either and she is not picky.  Still my husband and I liked it.

This pizza was just AMAZING!!!  I used Pillsbury pizza dough that I pre-baked for five minutes.  Other than that, I left the recipe exactly the same and it was just to die for.  It was by far the best BBQ chicken pizza.  Mixing the BBQ sauce and the marinara worked so well together.  I would have like more chicken on it, so next time I think I will make two chicken breasts.  This is definitely a keeper.

The simple addition of the sesame oil made the flavor of the chicken sing! After cooking, I shredded it up and put it back in the pan to coat with the yummy sauce. I used my homemade crust with a little mesquite seasoning mixed in, omitted the cilantro (didn't have any but will try it next time), and added an extra cup of colby-jack cheese. This is a keeper!

I made this tonight for dinner - my husband said it was everything he hoped it would be.  I eliminated the red onions because I didn't have any on hand, and because we don't really even like them.  I also added an extra squirt of bbq sauce for good measure because my husband loves bbq taste.  I'll be making this again!

Thank you so much for your recipe, Laura, because I was looking for a glazing sauce for my 
"Pop's Sauce" BBQ chicken and I did not know how much sesame oil to add. Using your recipe as guide, a tsp to a tbsp to a cup of BBQ sauce works great and adds a fantastic backgroup flavor to an already great sauce.  Thank you so much.  Bill

I have never eaten a barbeque chicken pizza before. I had left overs from Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken from this site. I rolled out my dough to fit in my largest cast iron skillet. Greased the pan with olive oil and sprinkled corn meal over that. Pre cooked my pizza dough on 400 for 15 minutes.
I mixed 1/4 c barbeque sauce with 3/4 c marinara sauce. Topped with mozzerella cheese and then added the chicken. Added diced green bell pepper and pineapple tidbits. Added some more cheese on top of that and sprinkled on some dried cilantro. I did brush my crust with olive oil and garlic powder. I baked an additional 25 minutes at 400. This smelled great, looked great, and tasted amazing. I would have never thought to use up my barbeque chicken left overs on a pizza if it were not for finding this recipe. In the future I will make it just like the original when I don't have the leftover chicken. Thank you so much for the inspiration!

This pizza was so yummy! I had to use 4 chicken breast halves I guess because the ones I had were small. I added a little extra basil and italian seasoning because the sauce that came with the pizza kit I bought (which was all I could find, couldn't find any Boboli pizza crust) was blan. I used light olive too because I didn't have any sesame seed oil, I'm going to try that the next time I make it. I also sauted my onion slices and added some sliced bell pepper on top of the chicken, then I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top of that. My two oldest daughters didn't like it because they're just picky, me and my youngest loved it! It was definitely awesome!

pretty delicious. i butterflied my chicken before cooking, cooked in about 1/2 tbsp sesame, 1/2 tbsp olive oil. used more bbq than recommended for the pizza sauze - probably 1/2 c bbq sauce and 1/3 c marinara. rolled my red onion slices around in bbq sauce before putting them on the pizza. topped the chicken with a bit of cheddar cheese.

This was quick and tasty.  You definitely need that pizza sauce or marinara in there to cut the barbeque flavor and we piled on veggies!

I really like all the ingredients for this dish, but didn't really care for the finished product.  I even made it a second time and it still didn't do anything for me.  And I was all set to love it!  Nothing really wrong with it; oh, well, I guess you can't win 'em all, just personal preference.  Don't hesitate to try this, I hope you like it better than I did....

GREAT!  I made this using the Pizza Crust III recipe vs. the store-bought crust.  It turned out wonderful.  My son got home from his day's worth of college classes, did his usual "pick up a bite to eat and head to the man cave."  Less than 10 minutes later he was downstairs for more saying "This is freakin awesome!!!"  Great recipe and thank you for sharing!

Wow!  This was so incredibly easy and delicious.  Usually I don't like BBQ sauce on a pizza because it's a bit too sweet for me, but the marinara sauce cuts the sweetness.  My husband loved it as well and I can tell we will be preparing this a lot in the future.

I make pizza all the time and my boyfriend and his kids said that this was the best pizza I ever made them. It was really great and so easy to make. I use the Boboli pizza shell. It is so good and fresh and you don't have to mess with dough. I will definitley make this again.

WOW! Winner Winner Unbelievably Awesome Barbeque Chicken Pizza dinner. Anyhoo, this is great! We have made this several times and each time it has been Awesome! I did make some changes. I cut up the chicken before I cook it. This time I used bacon grease to sautee the chicken as we added bacon bits to the pizza. Always add more cheese, we like it cheesy. I used the Pizza Dough I recipe from this site. Next time we might even add some spinach to it. This is a Keeper, thanks for sharing!!

I made it for dinner tonight... Even my grandfather who is usually really picky loved it! I didn't use the cilantro and I caramelized the onions. The mix of marinara and bbq sauce was a really good idea... especially because the sauce I used was somewhat watery and the bbq sauce made the consistency just right. Also, I used thicker chicken breasts and had to cook them for a bit longer after I cut them into pieces (a couple of pieces looked raw after 20 minutes of cook time!) Will definitely make again.

I have never been a big fan of BBQ Chicken pizza, but this recipe changed my mind! I like the combination of BBQ Sauce and Marinara Sauce--keeps the BBQ Sauce from being overpowering. Even my 1-year old ate a whole slice!

Very tasty.  Didn't knock my socks off, but it was a great combination of flavors.  Prepared just as instructed.  Next time will probably add mushrooms (personal preference).  It was just as good as any you'd find at at restaurant.

My hubbie absolutely loved this pizza! It was easy to make, I had made bbq chicken on the grill the night before, so even faster prep time, I still heated the chicken up in the pan with the oil and sauce. Will def make again!

This is wonderful and is now my husband's favorite pizza dish.  This was our first time to make our own pizza and it was so easy to make.  We used a whole wheat pizza crust and added fresh turkey bacon to it...YUM!!!

Very good barbecued pizza, way better then most you would get ordering out. The only change I made was to carmelize the onions before putting them on the pizza. Served it for a football party and everyone loved it.

Wow! What an EXCELLENT pizza!!!! Made this for my bf and I last night (we decided to stay in for New Year's). I wanted something quick and easy to prepare. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect recipe :) To speed preparation even further, I subbed an 8 oz. pkg. of grilled chicken strips (which I cut into smaller pieces) instead of cubing/cooking a chicken breast as directed. I simply mixed 2.5 T (I wanted to finish off the bottle) of Famous Dave's original BBQ sauce with the chicken and mixed the remaining 2 T with the marinara (Prego brand). I also added a bit of left-over bacon (fried and crumbled) and subbed 1 c. of smoked Gouda (shredded myself) for the mozzarella as I was aiming for authenticity (this is how CPK prepares their BBQ pizza). I followed the rest of Laura's directions to a T. My bf and I polished off an entire pizza!!!!! Thank you SO much for sharing this yummy recipe. I will definitely make this again! It's perfect for a busy weeknight :)

I have to give this 5 stars for the ingenious idea of mixing BBQ and marinara sauce.  I love BBQ chicken pizza, but I always found straight barbeque sauce too sweet and strong tasting.  I tried mixing it with regular pizza sauce, and it was perfect.

Great flavour and not over powering.  I did cube the chicken before I sauteed it with the bbq sauce.  The red onion is the best bit - will add more next time.  I did also add some veggies - corn and mixed peppers.  Would make again.

I love California Kitchen's bbq chicken pizza, but now - forget it. This is excellent. Other than the pre made pizza crusts I have this stuff on hand all the time. People , don't save calories and skip the sesame oil when cooking the chicken 'cus you'll be missing out on some of the flavor in this great pizza. Thanks for sharing this.

Great!  As others have said, the pizza sauce cuts the heavy sweetness of the barbeque sauce.  Layered it with the cheese on top - used mozarella and some colby/jack that was in the fridge.  Everyone enjoyed it - a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

We make this all the time and love it.  In addition to the red onion, which should be sliced very thin, I use red bell pepper slices and black olives.  When you need a change of pace from regular take out pizza, give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

This was a delicious way to use barbecue chicken. I followed the recipe, although I put a bit of olive oil on the crust and added some pepperoni. I also added more cheese, it turned out fantastic.  Can't wait to make it again.

Had to try this because apparently Elvis loved BBQ Chicken Pizza and I can see why.  Awesome recipe and totally tasty.  I added way too much bbq sauce though and it was sloppy.  Next time I should follow the recipe and try again. My fault.

YUMMMMMY!!!!!!!!!!! Relatively easy recipe. We accidentally put in twice the amount of sesame oil one time and it still turned out fantastic. I am not a big cilantro fan so I leave it off half of the pizza. This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled.

I used grilled left over chicken and fontina cheese. And I used fresh dough. The best thing about this particular recipe is the idea of mixing the bbq sauce with the regular sauce. Not so over-powering that way.

Fantastic!  I must admit, I was skeptical, but I'm glad I tried this one!  It is so delicious!  I used canola oil in place of sesame oil since that's all I had.   I also had some green onions I needed to use up so I used those also in place of the regular onion.  I also didn't have any cilantro so I left it out, but next time I plan on making this, I will make sure to have some.  I bet it would be wonderful!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe, it's one of my new favorites when I'm in the mood for a different kind of pizza.

Very good.  I liked the flavors of this bbq pizza. Usually for my taste there is too much bbq sauce. This has a great balance.  Will definitely make again.

ths is a wonderful recipe, as suggested by someone else i sauted the onions befor the chicken then i kept the onions in the pan with the chicken. instead on 1 chicken breats i used 2 and i used 1/2 cup bbq sauce just to make up for the other chicken breast. the only thing that i would do different is next time i will definatly make my own pizza crust and not use store bought crust. thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!!

This is my new favorite pizza recipe! I love it because it has only a few ingredients and tons of flavor. Plus, it can be prepared in very little time. Even when I don't have cilantro on hand, the pizza is still delicious. I like to add 2 teaspoons of hot sauce to the marinara/barbeque sauce mixture since I like things with a little heat.  I also use a Boboli Bread shell as a base. I'm  NEVER disappointed with this recipe. Thanks a million. This one is a keeper:)

This pizza was fantastic!!  We used the Kraft "Brown Sugar" BBQ sauce for a little extra sweetness and it was excellent.  We didn't have marinara sauce so we just substituted some Primo flavoured (Romano cheese) pasta sauce.  We used more than the cup of mozzarella cheese and we poured some additional BBQ sauce over the top when we were done.  This was one of the best pizzas I have ever made and ever bought.  For another good BBQ chicken recipe, check out "BBQ Chicken Calzones" (yum!)

I love that this pizza is unique and such a crowd pleaser. Since the first time I made this recipe, my husband has requested it almost every time I've asked him for a dinner idea since. I also served this at a game night we had and all of our friends loved it. I like that it's pretty quick and uses mostly basic ingredients. A new favorite at our house!

Fantastic BBQ chicken pizza. I make ahead of time and freeze them unbaked for a great homemade fro-pi. Try caramelized red onions to give it that extra something special.

I picked this recipe strictly for the sauce because I make my own pizza dough. With that being said, the sauce is amazing!! It has just the right amount of bbq flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

We wanted something different for turkey leftovers and this was really good! Having good quality BBQ sauce is a must. We used grilled onions and increased the onion quantity, added extra pizza sauce and added a little pepper jack cheese with the mozzarella. I agree with the other reviewers that 1/4 c BBQ added to regular sauce is just the right amount. Trader Joe's pre-made dough and pizza sauce made this fast and easy! If you like spicy have a bottle of sriracha sauce to pass around.

Make it often. Use spicy bbq sauce. Use Boboli bread. Add bacon and jalapenos. I also spread a thin layer of bacon grease on crust first. I love it. He loves it.

Hmmm. Okay, this was good. But the sesame oil was overpowering to me. I like the idea of deepening the flavor with it. But I wish I had used a splash of it and relied on olive oil for actually cooking the chicken. That being said, mixing marinara and BBQ sauce was brilliant.

I had a bunch of leftover bbq chicken so I decided to try out this pizza. I was a little worried about the marinara/bbq sauce combination but it was pretty good!  Husband said we should add bacon next time.

I have made this pizza a few times now, it is very delicious.  I mix half pizza sauce/bbq sauce for spreading on the dough as others suggest.  Also using homemade dough makes it that much more enjoyable.

I tried this recipe because of the reviews since I was skeptical of the combination of ingredients but it was great.  I never would have thought to combine the bbq sauce and pizza sauce but it worked well together.  Only used 1 tsp or so of sesame oil but that's due to my own taste preference. I also used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Looking forward to making it again!

Yum! I used shredded chicken instead of chicken breast, and tossed it in BBQ sauce. I also used fresh pizza dough because I prefer it over pre made. Didn't use red onion or cilantro as I didn't have any but didn't miss it. Will make this again.

I think it was the BBQ sauce I used that made all the difference. Homemade from some random small-town bar in MN

This pizza is amazing. Instead of cooking the chicken in BBQ sauce, I cook it with balsamic vinegar which mixes with the BBQ and sauce amazingly.  I also use tortilla shells coated in olive oil instead of pizza crust which gives it a really light crunchy texture. It is simply amazing!

This was a wonderful tasting pizza. I wasn't sure about the tomato sauce with the bbq, but its definitely a keep. I added some sharp cheddar which complimented this already good recipe.

Delicious - the names says it! I actually used leftover slow cooker BBQ chicken (see that recipe on this site) and the flavor was amazing. AND super simple which is a big plus. I omitted the red onions because I had cooked them with the chicken in the slow cooker.

My only complaint was that the crust was terrible, which was totally my fault (Boboli thin crust). Next time I will make my own. 

Very good recipe and will be making this EACH time I have leftovers for the BBQ chicken slowcooker.

This is a wonderful recipe especially if you want to try it for the first time. Very tasty.  I did use Boboli Pizza Crust, and store roasted chicken that I shredded.  Key ingredient is that seasame oil, adds the something you can't put your fingers on but makes it a notch better.  Leaning to cook with it since making this recipe. I do make a wetter chicken mis by adding extra sauce while sauteing the roasted chicken. I use Famous Daves BBQ sauce.

SOOOOOOO DELISH!!!!  My family loved this pizza...my husband said it was the best bbq chicken pizza, better than BJ'S.  The only thing I did differently was use a chedd-mozz cheese mix, added crumbled bacon, and didn't add the cilantro (we don't like it).  My husband requested this again for next Saturday, our pizza night.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe was really good.  My kids loved it and my daughter even said that I should put it in the regular rotation for dinners.  It was very easy to make.  The only down side is cooking with the sesame oil.  It has a very strong smell!  I thought I would try making it with vegetable oil next time, but I don't think it would be as good.  I also am not a big fan of cilantro so I did not use that.

This was a delicious, fairly quick weeknight dinner that the whole family enjoyed.  I thawed b/s thighs by mistake so I used those.  I used a tube of pizza dough, Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, and some leftover Bertolli sauce.  Yum-o!  I added a sprinkle of shredded sharp cheddar on top for extra flavor.  This is a flexible recipe, I could see using better quality dough and experimenting with different bbq sauces.  It was really, really good as I made it and I'll definitely put this in my go-to file.

LOVED this recipe. It was really easy and delicious. I shredded some pre-cooked grilled chicken strips from Costco and just decreased the pan cooking time. I also used walnut oil instead of sesame oil. The flavor of the chicken is awesome. Next time I will make my own dough. Definitely worth trying!

Yummy!  I made it gluten/dairy free by using rice cheese, gluten free pizza crust, gluten free bbq sauce.  I was thinking it'd be good with pineapple too but didn't have any on hand!  I made another and delivered it to my sister today too!  Will make it again for sure!!!

This was very good - will make it again! I had to improvise a bit because my chicken was already cooked and I didn't have a pizza crust. I used ciabatta bread and brushed the sesame oil onto it. Even my 2-year old ate it up after climbing up to the table, seeing the cilantro, and announcing "I don't want the grass!"

I really liked this pasta.  My 13 year old girl (very picky) loved it!  I made my own crust and used some leftover BBQ sauce I had from a recipe on this site- whiskey BBQ sauce (very good).

I made this a couple days ago and it was amazing! The name is perfect! I made my pizza crust instead of buying it and I think it made it even better! We are definitely going to be eating it again and again.  My 6 year old daughter said that she loves it sooooo much she could eat the whole pizza herself.  LOL.  And My Husband I fought over who was going to have the left over piece the next day.  haha

Wow, this really was good.  It was a HUGE hit.  I chose this recipe to use up some left over sauce, and chicken that was already defrosted.  I had all the ingredients in the house, but honestly didn’t know how they would taste together.  I was very impressed and surprised by the result.  I’m looking forward to making it for company one night.  It was very easy and very good.  My boyfriend loved it and said it was even better the next day.

Made with pillsbury crust and came out perfectly. Also added some cheddar because I didn't have quite enough mozzerella. Delish! Could use one more topping like mushrooms or green pepper, so add whatever you like. Make sure to just leave the chicken during first step. Great carmelization. Grown up version: spectacular with red wine.

This was TERRIFIC!  I had a baked chicken breast left over and just tossed it with BBQ sauce.  I used a little extra BBQ sauce than it called for when I mixed it with marinara sauce b/c we like it stronger but REALLY great!!!!!

Wonderful!  Didn't use cilantro, though... but that's my preference!! I also used a little more chicken, but it was delicious!

This recipe was delicious and easy. I added thick slices of tomato with the onions and I think a half cup of cheese would have been better

Didn't have marinara. Used salsa instead and oh my.... yum! Also I used either asparagus or spinach for some green. Thanks for sharing!

I used leftover cooked chicken, sauteed the onions in a bit of margarine before assembling the pizza, and used a bbq/pizza sauce mixture.  Unbelievably delicious!  Next time I will add mushrooms!

So delicious! I was a bit skeptical about the marinara/bbq mix, but it was delicious and not too over-powerful.  I added green onions, caramelized onions, bacon bits, and some gouda cheese to the pizza and it was very very tasty.

I am not a fan of BBQ sauce on pizza but with it mixed with the marinara, the sauce is perfect and not too overwhelming. I added a little bacon to the toppings. The kids liked it but didn't want the cilantro on it nex time. The hubby and I liked it with.  Next time I will have to make more than one pie as it was gone quickly.

Great recipe.  We made mini-pizzas with "Jay's Signature Pizza Dough," also on this site.  The sauce was perfect.  I used minimal sauce as we grilled these pizzas.  I put the dough on the hot, oiled grill for a couple minutes.  We then removed the crust and put toppings on the cooked side.  Then we put them back on the grill until the cheese melted.  We mixed cheddar and mozzarella on top.  Only topped with cilantro, no BBQ mixture.  They turned out great.

I am so impressed with myself with the help of this recipe of course! This was sooooo yummy and tastes just like the bbq chicken pizza I love. I make the recipe exactly except used honey bbq sauce, topped with some crumbled bacon and used a combination of mozzarella cheese and shredded cheddar. Oh...also use Bobolli pizza crust. DELISH!

DELICIOUS!!! YUM, YUM!! Excellent flavor. I would dice the chicken first and then cook in sesame oil and bbq sauce so that the chicken cooks more quickly and doesn't brown too much on the outside. I added diced tomatoes too and it was great!  Thanks for sharing your recipe! I love it!

Delicious! I made this with Jay's pizza crust as suggested - it was amazing. I left out the onions (personal preference) and substituted bacon bits. Next time, I think I'll add more chicken as well, and possibly more cheese. However, this pizza was AMAZING as is! Words can't even describe. My boyfriend was excited that I actually made something edible for once - this is something even a novice like myself can make without messing up!

This Pizza was amazing! I wasn't sure how the pizza sauce and bbq sauce would mix but it turned out perfectly. I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  this one is a keeper, will go into regular family dinner night rotation.  Mixing the pasta and barbeque sauce makes it just right.

Just made it for the first time and it went over amazingly well.  I used Boboli for the crust, generic leftover BBQ sauce, and a mix of left over Ragu and Bertolli for the sauce. The chicken was a previously cooked Costco chicken. I heated it up in a pan with a tbsp of olive oil and the BBQ sauce before using it to top the pizza. I've already received several requests to make it again.

I really like this and I simplified it more by getting the tyson southwest chicken strips that are already cooked.  It cuts down on prep time significantly for a quick meal.
