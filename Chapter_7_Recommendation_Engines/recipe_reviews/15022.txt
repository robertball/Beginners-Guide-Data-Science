Love this recipe.  To serve easier, I cut the crust BEFORE I put on cream cheese mixture. No mess.  I also add finely shredded cheddar cheese and press in slightly.

Delicious.  I added my own combo of veggie ingredients: carrots, sweet onion, cucumber, broccoli, cauliflower, and black olives.

This recipe is great, but if you don't use a processor, you're going to be chopping til Kingdom come!!  I also added black olives and shredded cheddar on top.  Yummy crowd pleaser--and adds a lot of color to your table!

I chose this recipe over the other 5 star veg pizza recipe because of the dill in the spread. As other users have noted, this makes the pizza! Don't fail to add that.

I love mayo in these types of recipes so I did 8oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayo. After mixing the spread, I chilled it for a bit. I let my dough cook 11 min exactly and it was perfect. I let it cool for 15 min away from the stove. Then I began spreading the cream cheese mix on top. It was a bit hard to spread but there was no sogginess. My veggies included grated carrot, orange bell pepper, green onions, broccoli,  and campari tomatoes. I pressed them into the spread. I then chilled the pizza for an hour before serving.

EVERYONE LOVED IT. EVERYONE!

If you do what I suggest above, this pizza will be good for more than 24 hours without becoming soggy. I just enjoyed leftovers and thought they even tasted better than the first day.

My mom used to make a similar veggie pizza for me when I was young, and I'd been wanting to try making it myself.  Luckily for me, I ran across this recipe---it's even better than mom's!  I made it for a party (where it was a big hit); I loved it so much that I made up another batch the next week!  Yummy yummy yummy!

I took this pizza to a Super Bowl Party, and everyone loved it.  I accidently used Fiesta Ranch Dip, so my pizza had a little bit of a Mexican Twist! Next time I am going to try it with the regular ranch!

When I was reading the reviews of this recipe I couldn't believe that it could be that good. Wow, was I wrong. This was delicious. I recently had an appetizer party and this was the first to go. My 7 and 8 year old also couldn't get enough. I will definitely fix this again.

I followed the recipe as it was stated and there was WAY too much of the cream cheese/ranch mixture for the crust.  It made the pizza heavy and gooey.  I really wish I had only put half of the mixture on the pizza crust.

I've been making this for years, and I love it!  One tip:  To make it easier to slice, once all the veggies are on, with clean hands, slightly press down on the veggies into the cream cheese mixture.

Very easy and a big hit. Versatile, you can use toppings to your liking, we generally use... broccoli, cauliflower, green onion, radishes, seeded tomato and cheese. Also to the reviewer that suggested cooling and cutting the crescents prior to topping... YOU ARE A GENIUS!! Works perfectly and it looks so much better for presentation:)

Great recipe.  When I make this for friends and family I don't put the veggies on the pizza.  I just put all the veggies in separate bowls and let everyone make up their own pieces.  That way nobody has to pick anything off!  Other veggies I like to have include mushrooms, olives, green & yellow peppers and cauliflower.  Thanks Merri!

This was good and a hit at the party but in my opinion it was too salty or had too much ranch.  I was going to only add half the ranch packet and wish I would've but since 95% of the reviews didn't seem to have a problem with it I went ahead and added the whole thing.  My choice of veggies were tomatoes, green peppers, celery, green onion, carrot and cucumber.  I was a little unsure of the dimensions that defines a jelly roll pan so I used my 11x17 and I made this the night before the party and didn't have a problem with it getting soggy.  Next time I make this I'll use reduced fat options (crescent rolls, cream cheese and sour cream) as I don't think any flavor would be compromised and only a half packet of dressing.

I have been making this cold veggie pizza for years for my open houses...pleases everyone. I make my own "sauce" and do not use ranch dressing anymore.  use some soft cream cheese, sour cream, garlic S & P....some fresh sweet basil is great in it also. It takes time to cut veggies into small pieces veggies by hand, but is more uniform. best veggies are red or yellow peppers, (cut small and strain some of the water out of ALL your veggies, or it will become mushy) broccoli, carrots, scallions,  and colorful finely grated cheese on top.

I do add a few more veggies here and there depending on what is fresh.  Plus, I toss all of the veggies 1-2 at a time into the food processor and then mix em all in a big ol bowl and then top the pizza with it.  This makes it so that you won't get a huge bite of just onion every now and then.  Plus it is a good way to fool the kiddos into eating veggies!

Ok, I don't understand what went wrong... I made the sauce just as the recipe states (trust me, I've looked at it over and over again) and just used different veggies. (Broccoli, tomato, green onion, carrots) And it tasted gross to me! I don't get it??? I'm so confused why it's gotten such good reviews...what happened?

Excellent!!  I thought this was such a great and fresh tasting appetizer.  I did change a couple things, but not much.  I used a couple of tablespoons of mayo instead of the sour cream.  I used a little garlic powder not salt.  I also only used half the package of ranch dressing because its so strong and I found half was perfect.  I didn't use celery or radishes but used different colored bell peppers.  Instead of the crescent rolls, I used a flatbread which I find just easier.  I guess I changed a little more than I thought.  However, the overall taste was great.  Lots of compliments.

This was a huge hit at a work party.  For the veggies I used 3 different color bell peppers, orange, yellow, and green, tomatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower.  I used roma tomatoes, and I cut all of the flesh out of the middle, and diced the outer meat.  This prevented the pizza from getting water logged.  It was PERFECT.  Very, very colorful, and tasted so good.  It was gone before half of the guests had arrived.

Very good! To make it easier, I used a bag of broccoli/carrot slaw and chopped in food processor before sprinkling on. Topped with shredded cheese. So easy and delicious!

I made this recipe this past weekend for a girls night and everyone loved it!  I even used fat-free sour cream, lite cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls. There was no loss in taste!  All of the veggies were chopped really small for easy eating!!

Really good... only used half of the ranch dip mix.  I think it may have been too salty for my taste if I would have added all of it.

Girls Movie Night last night and the host made this. OFF THE HOOK. It was the first time that I'd had carbs in over a month and a half and it was HEAVEN. I would like to try this myself with a whole wheat crust and re-rate but as is, it was SO good. Perfect for hot summer nights when you really don't want a heavy dinner. NOTE: She also used lowfat ingredients and you couldn't tell. I suggest you cut out the ranch dressing mix all together and stick with 2 tsp. dill weed, 1 tsp. each of garlic powder, onion powder and oregano and a 1/2 teaspoon of basil. Much better and not as salty or overpowering. You only need 1/2 cup of sour cream as well.

This is a great, easily adaptable recipe!  My husband isn't a fan of red pepper or radish, and I don't particularly love broccoli, but the great thing about this recipe is that we can tailor it to our veggie preferences.  On his side: chopped broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and sliced black olive.  On mine: fresh chopped spinach, carrot, celery, sprouts, and cucumber.  We sprinkle shredded cheddar over the top as well.  Awesome!  Great for "fend for yourself" nights!

Always a hit and very easy. I took the advice and cut my squares after I spread the mixture but before the veggies. I also used cucumber but no onion or radishes. Next time I will sprinkle with shredded cheese and maybe try adding a jar of artichokes. A+

This was delicious!  Only change I made (for the sake of saving money) was I used the dressing mix that was already "dill" flavor.  Then I omitted the dill weed.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a great recipe and really easy to make.  You can use basically any veggies you want to suit your audience!   I've also varied the extra spices added to the sour cream/cream cheese.

I've made this for years, but I find the ranch dressing is too strong.  I mix Mayo and Sour cream together along with dill, garlic, basil and various other spices that I have on hand.

Really good.  I didn't use the garlic salt and dill weed.  Just used the package of ranch dressing and tweeked the vegetables to my liking. Used broccoli,cauliflower, green pepper, carrots and black olives and sprinkled shredded chedder cheese on it.  Everyone loved it and no leftovers that went to waste!!

I would have rated this 4 stars but am giving it "5" based on the rave reviews of my guests.  There were other appetizers but this vege pizza was the most popular.  I was out of broccoli so I substituted with cauliflower.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I love this recipe. It's a perfect picnic food. Very tasty. I usually add some bacon pieces to the topping to give it a little extra flavor. You can use cookie cutters to cut these into fun shapes too.

Yum! I took this to work for a potluck and they wouldn’t let me leave until I printed them out the recipe! I love how easy it is to make, and adapt to personal preference… I used broccoli, carrot, tomato and shredded cheddar for the topping. Thanks, Merri, for a great recipe!

Veggie Pizza is always a hit no matter where you take it.  I made this for card club and I brought home an empty container.  I like how versatile it is to make.  I made it as written and also added:  chopped cauliflower, shredded carrot, chopped green pepper, diced tomatoes and finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Will probably be making this for Easter also.

This is always a favorite, but 1 tsp of dill is overkill.  I don't use radishes, but whatever I have on hand in terms of veggies-definitely carrots, broccoli, green onions, and a pepper of some kind though.  I also like to do 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.

Amazing recipe. I make this all the time for get togethers. I do change the recipe a little just to make it a little simpler. I only mix 1 cup S.C. the Cream Cheese and a 1 oz ranch mix. I also only use carrots and broccoli and chedder cheese for the topping. Everyone always loves this and asks me to make it.

this is a great recipe - ive been doing this for years, but i prefer a homemade crust to crescents, because crescents get soggy overnight while a REAL pizza crust doesn't. (it may get slightly stale, but i don't mind that) a homemade crust also packs more crunch, and you can bake flavor into it, giving more versatility

Recipe was good but a little too salty. Next time I will probably use more cream cheese as I saw in another recipe or not use as much of the ranch dressing.

Not sure why this calls for 2 cans of crescent rolls.  I used one 8 oz. can of the new "seamless" crescent rolls and it was perfect.  The cream cheese spread is really tasty and I love how you can customize the toppings to your liking.  I usually use finely sliced (not shredded) carrot, sliced radishes, black olives, broccoli (broken into "mini" florets), sliced green onion, and shredded cheddar cheese.  Cut it into squares, after refrigerating, using a pizza wheel.

Good recipe.  I used my own variety of veggies (red pepper, tomato, green onions, broccoli, carrots) and also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt ... and judging by other reviews I'm glad I did, I did not find the spread too salty when combined w/ the crust & veggies.  Love the ranch & dill together.  Also topped with a little shredded cheddar.

I have made this recipe twice and am making it a third time tonight. It is so yummy! I wish that the crust could be a little thicker, but I will attempt to spread the dough out less when upwrapping it. The flavors are excellent and I am looking forward to having it again for New Year's. A real crowd pleaser too!

We made this as party of our menu for a b-day party.  It turned out great!  Made a few changes.  We didnt have ranch dressing mix so we used italian instead.  We topped the pizza with radishes, carrots, cheese and bell pepper.  Everyone loved it!  We will be making this part of our regular dinner menus.  Thanks

I mostly liked this recipe. I did as another person suggested and used reduced fat cresent rolls and they didn't cook up as nicely, but that's not why I am giving it a 4. It was way too salty. I couldn't finish mine and needed a lot of water to go with it. I will make it again, next time only use 3/4 of the ranch packet and probably use a dash of garlic powder but not garlic salt. I've never had it with red pepper before and LOVED that addition. I also used low fat sour cream and cream cheese and though it was lower in fat it didn't diminish the flavor at all.

I tried this version, but everyone liked my own better. I do the crescent rolls just like the recipe, but then I add just a little sour cream to my cream cheese. I spread the cream cheese on and then transfer to a cutting board and cut into pieces. Then I transfer back to baking sheet and I add chopped up cucumber, red & yellow peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, green onion, and shredded cheese. I press this mixture into the cream cheese mixture and then broil this for a few seconds just to melt the shredded cheese a little so that all the veggies stay on.

I made this up for Christmas Eve as a colorful alternative to the standard veggie tray.  The tip another reviewer left to pre-cut the baked crust worked really well.  I also pre-cut the veggies the night before (and grated the carrot) and wrapped each in a damp paper towel.  Made the "sauce" the night before.  Assembly on the day of the party was easy.  This was not a hit with the kids who came to the party, but they were really picky eaters.

I ate leftovers 2 days later and the crust had softened up, but I still liked it.

I've been making veggie pizzas for years, but have always just used cream cheese and ranch dressing mix. I never had used sour cream before, but it was awesome. This is my future mother-in-law's favorite food, so I made this for her for Mother's Day. It didn't last long! I forgot to take a picture of it (gasp!), but it looked great. I sprinkled a blend of shredded cheese on top of the cream cheese and topped with cucumbers, carrots, green peppers, celery, and sliced grape tomatoes. I arranged the tomatoes on top of everything to spell out 'MOM'... adorable and delicious!

I used this as an appitizer for Thanksgiving with my husband's family. It was the first time I was hosting it, so I was a little nervous. This was a fantastic addition to our all day snacking! I used the lowfat crescent rolls and low fat cream cheese. I also added just about the whole envelope of dry ranch mix (we like a lot of flavor). Make sure you chop up your veggies small enough so they don't fall of the top of the pizza.

Super yummy! I prepared the veggie pizza as directed until it came to the toppings, where I used shredded cheddar and diced carrot, broccoli, tomato and green onion. Thanks, Merri!

This was very good and colorful.  I didn't use celery or radishes.  To save time, I bought a bag of julienned (matchstick) carrots.  In addition, I used a yellow sweet pepper (diced), broccoli, cauliflower, green onion and grape tomatoes (sliced).  It was so pretty & tasty, that all the ladies at my painting group raved!  I really like the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  Be sure to use the dill, as it really makes the dish!

My 3 year old ate preferred this to a table full of cheese/tomato pizza, cheesies and other snacks.  I cooked the crust a couple hours earlier, added the cream cheese and toppings and served right away with no sogginess.. the only problem was cutting it up quickly enough!

This was just ok. Won't make it again. I think the only thing redeemable about it was the crust. Maybe omit the sour cream and dill and sub with mayo and add some bacon?

This was pretty good, but make sure to let it chill overnight so that the ranch blends into the cream cheese all the way.  The flavor seemed much better the second day after letting it sit a bit longer.

Made this for our Super Bowl party.  Could not stop eating it.  Used fat free cream cheese, low-fat sour cream, and reduced-fat crescent rolls and it tasted as good as any I've ever had.  For veggies, I used zucchini, red bell peppers, cucumbers, green onions, olives, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.  Will definitely make this again.  My wife wasn't crazy about the added dill, which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.

Love this recipe...I make it pretty often. I omit the dillweed and garlic salt, only because I feel like the ranch mix provides enough flavor. I also use low-fat sour cream and cream cheese to cut down some on calories. I also usually use carrot, tomato, cucumber, and broccoli, although the recipe is great with any veggies you want to use.

Very tasty. Made it for a pot luck. I used low fat crescent rolls, weight watchers whipped cream cheese, and reduced fat sour cream. I also used grn onions instead of yellow and added bacon bits, tomato, and cucumber, left off the red pepper. You can pretty much use any good blend of veggies according to your own preference. I had compliments on this dish. People especially liked the addition of the dill and garlic powder. I would make again.

I halved this and topped it with red and yellow pepper, broccoli, carrots and a little bit of red onion. I think it is better after it sits over night but that is just my personal opinion. I also used reduced fat crescent rolls and cream cheese and fat free sour cream. YUM!

There are so many ways and recipes to make this but I found I liked the amounts of sour cream & cream cheese used.  Instead of heating up my oven I use pita bread plus instead of dill weed I used fresh dill which really made it tastey everyone asked what did you do different.  Thanks!

I love making this recipe. I think its fun and quick. I use different veggies than what this recipe calls for and I add some cheddar chesse to it as well. Great recipe to take to a party, it is always a favorite!

Awesome!  Instead of adding diced onion on the pizza, I mixed 2 green onions into the cream cheese mixture instead.

This was pretty good but I felt like it was missing something.  Maybe some tomatoes or a little sprinkle of cheese?  Dill was a great herb for this pizza and next time I might even try it with fresh dill!

This was good, nothing spectacular though. I might enjoy it more as an appetizer than a dinner.. but either way I found the cresent rolls to clash a bit with the ranch.

Loved the cream cheese mixture in this recipe.  Really tasty. I used different veggies (carrots, green onion, mushrooms and broccoli) but it was the cream cheese mixture that made it super!

Yum!  I did this on a sundried tomato wrap to cut carbs. I ate it yesterday for dinner, ate another small helping after dinner, ate it again today for a snack, and made my husband eat it for his snack. The next time I entertain, I may roll this in a wrap and slice it for some colorful and tasty pinwheel appetizers. I don't even like veggies, but I loved this. The cream mixture is delicious!!

This recipe was fantastic! I did however change a few things. I only used one packet of Ranch mix for a double batch and I used Pillsberry pizza crust rather than cresent rolls... that was MUCH easier. I also used different veggies as shown in my picture. I left my family reunion with NO leftovers and a TON of compliments. The only suggestion I would make... the "sauce" mixture makes ALOT for the size of the crust and you should not put it on too thick, can be over powering to the wonderful veggies! 

Happy cooking! Cindy

Yummy - I didn't have dill weed so I just added some chives and onion power for the heck of it.  It still tasted great - I used lite sour cream and low fat cream cheese, too!

We make this at least 2 x's a month.  Great variation to the traditional meat and potatoes.  Its also nice for getting the kids to eat fresh raw veggies.

I have made this over a dozen times and everyone always loves it. I've made this recipe exactly as written along with some changes due to what I had on hand.  Now when I make it I always use a pizza crust, bake it for 10-12 minutes allow it to cool then add my toppings. The topping are interchangeable and can be adapted to what is in season.  I've even in a last minute pinch omitted the sour cream but in that case I felt the cream cheese layer was a little over powering. Every time I make it I top it with a little grated cheddar cheese (~1/4 c). Love it!! Thank you for the excellent crowd pleasing appetizer.

I made this numerous times as is which is good. But when I make it with a pre made bread shell such as Boboli, it is much better. It holds up for a longer time without getting soft or soggy.

I've been looking for this recipe for over 15 years. It was made for me as a child because of my tomato allergy. I am so thankful that I found it. After making it, I realize the "adult" me has different taste buds, but it had a lot of memories in it. You have no idea how long and hard I have looked for this over the years. Now, I can move on. Thank you!

Followed the recipe and it came out perfect. I wanted to try something different and saw this recipe. Very delicious pizza. Next time, I would like to try it with shredded cheese and black olives. You can get really creative with this dish!

Oh goodness, I can't stop laughing at the ones that think this was to be served for dinner.  This is an appetizer type recipe.  That may be why you think the ranch dressing is overpowering..it's an appetizer!!!   The thought of eating this as a meal is making my stomach ache. lol

Very good! I like to chop the carrots and then use shredded cheddar cheese to top the whole thing!
I would suggest, like another reviewer mentioned, to push the veggies down so they stick to the pizza better. Or else it is a mess to eat.

I have made this for many gatherings, and its always everyone's favorite. The only change I made was I didn't use radishes, and I did add shredded cheddar cheese. I couldn't imagine it without cheese :) this appetizer is always a hit! Thanks for sharing!

Too salty.  I would leave out the salad dressing mix and just use garlic powder and salt/pepper to taste with the dill.  I pulsed the veggies in a food processor so it was easier to eat.

Awsome recipe.  I did exactly as directed, except I used 3 cans of crescent rolls and made a very large pizza, and had enough left over to make a small pizza for myself and kids before the party. There was just enough cream left for it.   Glad we got to eat that, cause by the time we got through the line to get food, the pan was polished clean.  I also added a large spoonful of mayonaise to the cream mixture to improve flavor and used my own variety of vegetables including tomatoes, onion, red bell pepper, broccoli, carrot and shredded cheddar.    Everyone raved about how good it was.

I always make this for parties.  The only change I make is not adding garlic salt, and of course my personal preferences for what veggies to use.  I always try to make the "sauce" at least a couple hours before I plan to assemble.  Gently press the veggies into the sauce after assembling, it helps to hold everything together when eating.

I originally made this recipe at a pampered chef party and loved it. I use the Dill instead of ranch, has less of a kick I think and goes better with the veggies.

Delicious! I used the Dill Blend from Wildtree with a tsp of their Onion Chive blend. Perfect.  I took the advice from another reviewer on cutting them before the spread was put on. GREAT Advice!
Also fun for the kids to dress up their own piece.  Got them to eat their veggies without the arguing.

I absolutely love this recipe it is the perfect appetizer all year round but especcially in the summer. I like to use whipped chive cream cheese instead of plain it adds a ton of flaver and makes the topping light and fluffy.

This recipe had great reviews so I had very high expectations, but unfortunately this was an utter disappointment. This doesn't taste anything like a pizza, but I figured that going in and made it as an appetizer instead. Quite frankly it would have tasted much better had I just used tomato sauce and cheese instead. This recipe calls for way too much cream cheese, sour cream and ranch dressing mix that it overpowers the entire dish. Nobody complained too much when I made it, but I think people were just trying to be nice.

There was a woman that I used to work with that made this dish and I LOVED it. So, I made this for my cousin's rehersal dinner as the appetizer. There wasn't a single piece left! I used the red and green peppers, shredded carrots, broccoli and cauliflower and lots of cheddar cheese! Best recipe ever for this!

This recipe was a little short on flavor and too dry for my taste. I tried it for the kids as well and they did not find it appealing. I would recommend adding some sour cream to the cream cheese to make it more moist like a sauce.

This was  a hit at a staff meeting potluck.  I made my own crescent roll dough (used the Golden Crescent Roll recipe from this site) and baked a bit longer than directed.  I didn't have all of the vegetables in the recipe, so I just used what I had:  red and orange bell pepper, broccoli, cucumber, and olives.  I also used the idea from the Patchwork Veggie Pizza on here to make it fun.  Everyone loved it and I didn't have any to take home.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never seen a two year old tear into raw veggies like my daughter tore into the ones on her piece of this pizza! I used mushrooms, squash, broccoli, and carrots because those are the general favourites around here. This is scrumptious! She even ate the bread, and she doesn't like bread! Thank you for this recipe!

Very yummy. I didn't put celery on it because the boyfriend doesn't like it but the pizza turned out wonderful. I have had this at family outings and things but had never made it. Another successful cooking experience thanks to allrececipes.com!!!!

Great recipe! I did change the veggies a little, and added cheese. It was a little salty, so I'll use a little less ranch mix.

I really liked the sour cream/cream cheese mixture that makes this dish stand out.  I did change up the veggie combo, I used carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, caulflower and radishes all of which I diced.  The zing of the radishes was perfect and I wasn't going to use them, but so glad I did.

Love the "sauce"/spread, i really like the use of the garlic and dill weed in addition to the ranch dressing mix. For the toppings I use broccoli, red pepper, and carrots, then sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top. Delicious.

I halved the recipe; skipped the salt and used less ranch dressing mix.  I used a lot of shredded veggies and grated cheddar cheese so next time I will make more sour cream & cream cheese mixture.  I made the pizza the night before the Super Bowl party.  It was pretty good but was not a big hit.  Kept it in the fridge for another night.  They tasted even better on the third day.  Amazing!

A Super Bowl party hit and I received many compliments on this. I added some fresh parley to the cream cheese spread because I wanted to use it up, but other than that I made it as listed in the recipe. Will definitely make again...soon! Thank you!

This is sooo yummy and easy.  I made it with whatever raw veggies I had and my son and I loved it.  I also made it for dinner when he had his pickiest eater friend over and his picky eater friend asked for seconds!!

I've always liked veggie pizza but this recipe is my favorite.  I love the added dill.   I used broccoli, shredded carrots, cheddar cheese and sliced black olives for my veggies.

I made this for a New Year's party as specified (with a couple changes in the veggies I used to top) and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone who tried it loved it, and we had none left at the end of the night!  I will definitely make this again.

always a hit to wherever i bring it! the longer the Ranch mixture sits the more flavor it gets (The instructions call for it to sit for at least an hour) so I make it at least an hour before it needs to be assembled. Make sure you give your crust plenty of time to cool.

I made a double batch of this for Thanksgiving for a family post-dinner snack while we played games.  I was hoping to have leftovers, but there wasn't a square left!  Thanks to the earlier reviewer who had the idea to cut the baked crust before adding the cream cheese and toppings--this made it virtually mess-free!

I searched high and low for a recipe that didn't have mayo as an ingredient.  This was a huge hit at my party... my grandma couldn't stay away!  I will definitely make this again in the future.  Some tips: I did add cheddar cheese like some suggested.  I also cut the crust before I put on the ranch/dill spread and veggies.  It made it really easy to serve.  Thanks for sharing!

Took it to a party, and ppl gobbled it up! The crust needs to bake a little longer than called for. Maybe 12-13 mins, at ten mins it was still doughy and 15 made to crust crunchier and fall apart. Needs to go till its just barely a hint of gold... Also, next time I'll use mayb 3/4 of the ranch packet.

Delicious!  I used reduced fat sour cream, fat free cream cheese, and reduced fat crescent rolls, and no one knew the difference!  I used broccoli, red peppers, green peppers, and carrots to top it...used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and also added 1/4 tsp onion powder instead of putting onions on the pizza itself (don't care for raw onions).  It was a big hit!

Delicious!!!  I took this to a friend's party and it was gobbled up!  I only put broccoli, red bell peppers and (matchstick) carrots on it.  I also sprinkled the cream cheese mixture with a little cheddar cheese.  The only other thing I did differently was that I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt...don't need the extra salt.  I will definitely make this again!

I was skeptical.  Yes it has amazing reviews, but I am a veggie-phobe trying to change my ways.  I have NEVER eaten raw bell pepper before, but did so happily with this recipe.  I made a minor change.  I don't like raw onions, but I like the taste of onions so I threw some diced onion with a minced clove of garlic into my cast iron skillet.  I stirred this into my cream cheese/sour cream concoction in lieu of garlic salt.  I added the ranch mix slowly as many other reviews said it was overpowering, but if you add slowly you won't dump and regret it.  :)

Excellent easily modified recipe to adapt to personal taste.  Like others I changed and used what we liked:  sliced black olives, red & yellow peppers, cucumbers, broccoli, onion & shredded cheese.  I also used a bit of spicy ranch mix to give it a bit more flavor.  Excellent recipe.

Great recipe, just made a few changes.  I omitted the dill(not a big fan of dill) and garlic salt (felt it would make it too salty), and added another 4oz of cream cheese.  This gave the sauce a thicker consistency.  Was a huge hit at our family party!

I added black olives and skipped the radishes.  On part of the pizza I also tried adding dried figs instead of olives and that was delicious!  The recipe makes way too much of the spread but you can use it as a dip for ritz crackers or vegetables.  Instead of regular onions, I chopped up some chives and mixed them in with the spread.  Very tasty!  Next time I'll try adding the shredded cheddar cheese and the cucumbers.

I've been making something similar to this for years. Never thought of putting radishes on it, that was great! Too much of a hurry to grate carrots or chop a red pepper so didn't add those. Was still good and enjoyed by all!

Had this at a party the other night and really liked it. I run all the broccoli and cauli. and carrotts through the food processor until they're diced into tiny pieces. I think next time I might try using a tube of pizza crust dough instead of messing with the triangles in the cresent dough. 

This recipe would be a great appetizer. I wouldn't make it the day of an event at my house because it is what my mom calls piddly to make. A bunch of steps dishes and mess. It would keep in the frige great for a couple of days though!

Amazing and simple - a great combo of ingredients.  I make the cream cheese "base" the day before so it has a chance to combine flavors overnight.  YUMMY!!!

I discovered through this recipe that I do not like ranch dressing mix.  It is too salty.  Maybe if you use less it would be ok, but it was really over powering to me.  I dropped it off for a ladies lunch and it was pretty much eaten so everyone else must have liked it.  I think I'll stick to a garlic/dill spread.

This is such a treat!  I used Naan bread for ease.  Delicious! Make sure veggies are cut up well.

This recipe was a big hit at the party I made it for.  Everyone really enjoyed it and I used light sour cream, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls to make it a little healthier.  Didn't notice any difference in taste, in fact people were pleasantly suprised when I told them all the reduced fat items I used.

This recipe was excellent. I made it with a friend so the work went faster. We used green and red bell pepper, shredded carrot, a chopped shallot, and broccolini. It was delicious and the "sauce" is wonderful! Great flavor! Anyone who enjoys eating veggies and dip will enjoy this pizza!

I omitted the sour cream and used 12 ounces of whipped cream cheese.  This worked wonderfully!  This was a huge hit at a July 4th party this weekend.  The platter was empty within an hour and I had even made a double batch! I made the crust the night before as well as the cream cheese mixture and let it refridgerate in a bowl overnight.  I didn't assemble until right before we left. This was sooo yummy!

This was so good! What a great way to use up the leftover veggie tray and dip! My husband cringed when he saw what I was making, but when it was finished, he ate it all up! Add a diced, grilled chicken breast to the top and you have your entire meal!

Made this for the first time for a shower this weekend and everyone LOVED it. You know a recipe is good when you get requests for the recipe!  The only change I made was to top with some shredded mozzarella cheese. YUM!

This is good.  Just make as directed and put whatever veggies on top you want.  I used chopped carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, red pepper, orange pepper, and yellow pepper.  I chopped each up in tiny pieces.  Delicious!

This was great!  I've made this for years, but never did it with the ranch dressing mix.  Mine was always good, but when I tried it this way I discovered greatness.  The ranch dressing mix is absolutely the secret ingredient.

These are great for any party, especially football games. We used 1/3 less fat cream cheese because all the other things that night were quite heavy. It still tasted great! Refreshing and looks beautiful on the plate.

This was great and so refreshing. I used cucumbers, broccoli, celery, radishes and red peppers. I didn't use the dill weed and it still came out great. A beautiful dish! I'll be making it for both of my upcoming tea parties.

I got lots of rave reviews on this.  I used neufchatel in place of cream cheese and reduced fat Pillsbury crescent rolls to cut some of the fat.  I shredded carrots, diced broccoli and red pepper and celery and spread it evenly over the crust.  Nobody complained and most people took seconds.  It presented beautifully at my NYE party because it looked like confetti.  Very pretty and tasty.

I made this for a group of girlfriends and were all trying to lose weight for our weddings. I converted most of the ingredients to fat free or light. I was able to get low free crescent dough,fat free cream cheese and light mayo! They loved it and didn't feel guilty eating it!

I modify this recipe, for the toppings- I only use the ranch dressing, cream cheese and garlic salt.  Then I put cheese, carrots, broccoli, and green peppers on it.  It is always a favorite for anyone who trys it!

This church supper staple is delicious and a hit with my veggie shy kids.

I add a little garlic powder to the cream cheese and seeded chopped cucumbers to make it personal. I usually omit the carrots.

This was wonderful...definitely worthy of the 5 star rating, I followed another reviewer's advice and cut my crescent before I put on the cream cheese and veggies.  I only used half of the ranch dressing and still found it slightly overpowering so I will probably use only about a third of it next time.

We usually have a version of this at family functions and I like this one better than the cream cheese mayo based recipe my grandmother makes.  I only used about 2 tbs of the ranch mix and it turned out perfect, I think the whole package would have been too much.  I also added a few scallions, it made a big delicious defference!

served for a party and got many complements. I used a food processor to chop the veggies and pressed them into the cream cheese with my hands to make them stick. Great for a Christmas party when you feel like you've eaten nothing but sugar for weeks.

This is one of my favorite appetizers to make for parties.  And you can change the veggies to whatever you are in the mood for, it's very versatile.  It's like veggies and dip without the double dipping!

An old favourite.  I don’t bother adding the extra spices, there’s lots of flavour in the ranch dressing package.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the veggies on top.  I used carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower.  Excellent!

My family and friends have Benning making all most this exact recipe for years and it is always well loved. I believe the amounts of cream cheese and sour cream very from recipe to recipe, as do the veggies according to the cook and personal taste

I didn’t have dill so I used Mrs Dash. It turned out great and was the hit at a family gathering. I’ve made it several times, my family loves it and I just use whatever veggies I have on hand.

So good! This recipe was perfect and very easy to follow. I altered the veggies on top for my preference but did everything else exactly as written. One tip: be sure to chop the veggies small, like in the picture. I have had it (made by other people) with larger pieces of veggies and it makes it hard to eat and less enjoyable because you don't get the nice mixture of different veggies.

Every time this is served at my church for social hour, I usually take a slice or two even on the go. I'm so glad I found this recipe here on All Recipes. I've made some adjustments to my pizza: instead of a full pie, I've only did half of the crescent roll. Instead of a full packet, I've used half of the sour cream, skipped celery (don't like it), used orange instead of red peppers, and let it chill for 15 minutes.  Delish! I would make it again-though I didn't make it twice. An error over here.

Best tasting veggie pizza I've ever had! proportions are perfect.  I made it for valentines day and used a small heart cookie cutter to cut some of the veggies. It turned out beautifully and very tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for family and work about 5x. I highly recommend as years later they remember how good this recipe is. The day before I mix the ‘sauce’ ingredients to allow it to permeate. The night before, I cook 2 tubes of crescent rolls on a 12x18” cookie sheet and cut into 18 pcs. It can be challenging to stretch it evenly. I like to made things proportional (the tedious part) so I give myself enough time to cut the toppings  perfect and to make sure the rinsed broccoli etc. isn’t dripping wet. For transporting, I place another cookie sheet inverted over it and strap tape around it. Then I time how long it takes people to eat all 2 of them. My own sister told me last month that it is good which is surprising to her because it is full of ingredients she doesn’t like, but all together...

I made this last night for myself while my family had Dominos (I cut the recipe in half). It was delicious! Super easy which is a huge bonus also! I had leftovers for lunch today and still enough for one more meal.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Very good.  I would cut the cream cheese mix by a fourth since I had some left even though I put it on quite thick and also used a cookie sheet so the crust was larger than 9x13.

Really good but I might use slightly less than the 1 oz. Pkg Ranch.. it may be too strong a flavour for some people using the full thing.

I used an 18x13 cookie sheet so doubled the cream cheese to fit; used the full pkt. of ranch dressing and added 1/4 cup sour cream to make the blending easier.  Astounding recipe!

I make this often for potlucks at work and I always get rave reviews and never any leftovers.  I've found the amount of crust and filling work much better on a 13" x 18" half sheet pan.  It's just too much for a jelly roll.

I have been making this for years.  My mom called it summer pizzia.  We don't roll the dough over the sides of the pan but leave it flat.  Use whatever veggies you like.  If you don't like raw broccoli, you can steam it a few minutes, ice to chill and then chop.  To the review who commented that without a chopper it's a lot of time, it's true, but thats what cooking is about.  It's a dish that you can also have family & friends chop to turn into a group activity.   You can also divide it into halves or thirds, so my husband & I could enjoy mushrooms  and olives but my daughter could have twice the carrots and added some shredded cheese.  We also cut with a pizzia cutter.

I've made this exact thing, though I didn't have this recipe. It's all the same except I never have added garlic or dill, it's always been perfect with the powder ranch packet.

Great receipe ...I forgot to poke holes in the dough before I bake it my crust was a little too thick.   I always add a few more spices to it .. Everyone love it too!  I also padded the vegetables into the cream cheese mixture it did help so everything did not fall off when you took a bite...

My family devoured this veggie pizza.  I made to snack on Memorial Day before our huge BBQ dinner.  It was a huge hit.

This was delicious! Mine turned out a little salty, but I believe it was due to the fact I misread the ingredients and instead of 2 8oz packages of crescent rolls, I only had 1. Which made my cream cheese/sour cream mixture to dough ratio a little off. Other than that, it was great!

I love this recipe! I did use less mayo and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It is a really great way to have your veggies without the boring vegetable tray.

I used to make this with my mom with a few changes.  We used vegetables my brother and I would eat (no  onions).  You can use just about anything (finely chopped or grated).  Re: the mixture.  We mixed to taste.  Basically, we combined all the ingredients in smaller amounts and then continued to add to the mixture according to our preference.  All in all, this makes for an easy, and yummy, meal that the kids can help prepare and,  amazingly, eat (with no complaints).

Really tasty and can be made weight watcher friendly easily.  I have also made it with roasted veg cooled to room temp.  A real hit of flavor for a bit of fat from minimal good oil. Thanks for the  recipe ... very summery as written.

Great recipe and always a crowd pleaser.  I use three tubes of crescent rolls and pat them out in my large cookie sheet that has sides.  That way there is the correct amount of cream cheese mixture to spread over the cooled crust.  Of course I up the amount of veggies to cover.  Always top this with shredded cheddar cheese.  Perfect!

I have used plain yogurt in place of sour cream and knorr swiss vegetable soup mix in place of spices. Very accomodating to my individual taste

Very yummy.  Takes a lot of prep time to cut the veggies.  The crust needs to completely cool before you put the cream cheese spread on.

Absolupely delicious! Chop any veggies to your liking. I do all sliced black olives, no onions, just scallions only. I chop broccoli, carrote sticks, radishes,  celery, red pepper and I am done. I totally agree that you should puch the vegs into the cream cheese mixture. 
Never, never put shredded cheese on it. It ruined it. IMHO. I pretty much stay with the original recipe.

Excellent recipe! I omitted the onions based on personal preference, and added some fresh dill that I had on hand. I made this for a church potluck and prepped it the night before. I baked the crust, chopped the veggies and mixed up the "sauce". I then refrigerated overnight in separate containers so nothing got soggy. Layered it all together in the morning and stuck it in the fridge at church for approximately 3 hours till lunch time. Everyone loved it! I got tons of compliments!

Instead of crescent rolls I use the pre made pizza crusts that are in the isle with the pizza sauce.  That way you don't have to cook them & wait for them to cool.  I also use olives, mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower & cheddar cheese.

The ranch flavor was too strong for my taste - and I like ranch! I use ranch seasoning in many recipes, but it just overpowered this one. I'm not going to give up, though. I may attempt to tweak it next time, maybe less ranch and more dill.

I tried this recipe for a bridal shower. It was a tropical theme, so I tried to make it "Hawaiian". I used less of the  ranch and dill, and used tomatoes, green onion, pineapple, orange and red peppers and Deli ham for toppings. People loved it that way as well.

I'm going to be making it again soon and I think I'll try using French onion dip instead of sour cream and leave out the chopped onion altogether. Easier + more flavor!

This was not a hit at my party.  Nothing wrong with the recipe, but no one really "dug" it.  I probably won't make again.  Make sure you dice your veg really fine.  This is better when bites are easy, and big veg makes for difficult bites.

Great! Made this for my boyfriends birthday party, everyone loved it! I used light sour cream and cream cheese and was still very flavorful! I used less than half of an onion, since I was serving it at a party I knew if it had a whole onion on it people would stay away from it.  Will totally make this again!

The 'sauce' is odd tasting to me.  I didn't use all of the ranch packet and I actually added more sour cream to try and back down the salty taste.  Which is odd as I love salt and could practically eat it from the shaker.  I also love fresh veggies with ranch.  This recipe just fell flat.  Good enough to serve at my party, but I won't be making this again.  I once had a veggie pizza years ago and it was delicious this one not so much.

I used this recipe only for what to put in the cream cheese spread. It is delicious. The cheese spread is even good on Ritz (plain or w/veggies) or just as a vegetable dip. We had leftover spread and veggies so why not try. 

I used the Pizza Dough I recipe by Gudny Bjorg Kjaerbo because I had some in the freezer. I think it makes the pizza even better. My daughter couldn't get enough of it.

I didn't have the dill and garlic salt and I used a green onion instead of a whole onion.  It looked gorgeous and everyone thought it tasted great.  I dont understand the negative reviews. maybe some people thought since it says "pizza" in the title that they expect it to taste like an actual pizza!....i did read one persons review that said "way too much cream cheese, I will only use 8 oz. cream cheese next time!" umm, that's all the recipe called for!?

Maybe I'm missing something, but for me this was barely a '4'.
After a night in the refrigerator, this was great, so I changed the rating to '5'.

Was a hit even with our veggie-picky family. I made it the same, except only used broccoli, red pepper, and shredded carrot on top. Didn't use all the sauce, but saved it and put dollops on mexican omelletes later in the week.  So tasty!

Using 2 packages of crescent rolls really made a big difference and I had 2 folks say it was the best veggie pizza they've ever had!  I was embarassed by how simple the recipe is - but it turned out great and that's all that matters.  Variation: I used Knorr vegetable mix.

Very popular at a recent potluck. Put lots of veggies on top to balance out the thick layer of cream cheese. Used food processor to chop or shred all the veggies.

This was good, but not great. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only added half the amount of creamy spread called for.  Even so, I still felt like it was slightly too much creaminess. Also, I felt like the spread lacked flavor.  Perhaps, fresh dill would have made it more flavorful. I would like to try again with half the spread and fresh dill and maybe fresh ground pepper.

We make this for EVERY party we go to and it is ALWAYS a huge hit. If I don't have the ranch dressing mix, I just use 2 garlic cloves and mix it with the cream cheese. My kids beg for this!

This is a good way to get your kids to eat veggies!! Love the recipe but I did alter it. I bought french onion veggie dip instead of mixing the ranch spread. For my toppings, I used chopped green and red bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, cherry tomatoes, black olives, green onion, and topped it w/ shredded cheddar. Tastes great!!

I made this for a friend for an Easter bento lunch and it was VERY well recieved.  You have to play with the spices a little (I only used half of the package of ranch dressing and garlic powder rather than garlic salt) but overall it was easy and fun and tasty!  I'll definitely make again and vary up the veggies.

I was really excited to make this dish, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  It was tasty, but I probably won't make it again.  My husband didn't even finish his serving.  The sauce is good, but very overpowering.. perhaps I laid it on too thick.  Maybe it would've been better if it had a thinner layer?  At least it was fun to make.

Yum! This recipe was really good and a big crowd pleaser!! Everyone always asks for it now. I did add on finely shredded cheddar cheese and olives for more color. For the christmas season I am cut the rolled dough into 16 circles and create a tree!!

This is the exact recipe my mother used when I was growing up.  I was one of those kids who hated vegetables.  You couldn't get me in the same room with broccoli!  But whenever my mother made this, my sister and I would stuff ourselves full with it and not even be hungry for dinner later.  It's relatively simple, tastes great, very pleasing aesthetically, and appeals to every age.

This was pretty good. Brought to a potluck. One of the few dishes with veggies and a lot of people really liked it.

Boyfriend and I both loved this.  I will cook the crust longer next time, and add more broccoli (we love broccoli) but other than that, will make this every few weeks.

This turned out okay. Next time I will try more/different herbs in the spread b/c I found it to be slightly bland.

Great recipe, I used my salad shooter to chop up the carrots and red pepper. Brought it to a party and they were all gone within 5 minutes! I couldn't believe it! I should have made more. 
Next time I will try using the pizza dough that someone else recommended.

I liked this recipe very much. I made it at night so it can chill in the refrigerator and be ready to pack for lunch tomorrow. (Great alternative to a sandwich!) I did make a few changes: didn't have dill, used a few different veggies that I had in the fridge, added a small amount of cheese, and used low fat cream cheese rather than regular. I will defininatly add this to the regular lunch menu!

I made two of these for a pizza party and it was the first to go! Only change was I added a sprinkling of finely shredded sharp cheddar. Great recipe!

Yummy! I love this! I used the golden crescent roll dough instead of the canned crescent rolls and it turned out good. I didnt have any ranch mix so I just put some green onion, onion powder, garlic powder, dill and salt instead and it turned out fantastic. For the veggies I used the red bell pepper, carrot, and broccoli. Loved it!

I chop the vegatable a little more that the recipe stated for a better blen of flavors.  Also using less than a full package of the ranch makes this recipe less salty.  My family/ friends loved it so much that the extras hid in the fridgerator for  the next day came up missing.

I used broccoli, cauliflower, tomato, and cheddar cheese and it tasted great!  I took it to a picnic and it was the first thing to be eaten.  Even before my father-in-laws special ribs!

I made this for a Father's Day church picnic.  There were many different items at the picnic but mine was one of the few to be totally eaten.  I used the veggies of my choice:  vadalia onion, green pepper, broccoli, cherry tomato halves, shredded carrots, sliced black olives, and a mixture of shredded sharp cheddar & parmesian cheese.  My husband wanted to know why I only make this for special occasions and not for just us.

What a hit!  I did change the veggies to my personal liking.  I used black olives, broc, cauliflower, shredded carrots, and then topped with Mild Cheddar.  This was so very good!

I made this veggie pizza for a snack day at work.  I didn't stick around the food table long enough to see if there was any left, but no one brought me leftovers at the end of the day.  It's a really simple recipe and you can pretty much just use whatever veggies you already have on hand, or whatever you personally like.
