After adding all of the listed ingredients and cooking the sauce as instructed, I thought that it tasted just a little bit on the bland side.  I added a lot more garlic powder, sprinkled some parmesan cheese in it , and also added a heaping tablespoon of margernine to it.  After the additions, I thought that it tasted much better.  I will definitely make it again, and add the extras.

I tryed this sauce tonight and it was so good, my kids even loved it.  But I did a few things different, I added a mushroom finely dices and some spring onions to the sauce and some chopped up left over BBQ chicken and mixed it all with shell pasta. Yummmm very nice, thats for posting this recipe.

Followed directions (except used dried parsley) and found the sauce a nice thick, smooth consistency but bland. Gave 4 stars because it was a nice base to play with... I added more garlic, some seasoned salt, some italian herbs and just kept tasting until I loved it. Nice on tilapia!!

I did not like this at all, but my husband loved it, so it gets a three. To me it was like eating steak covered with fat. He was dipping his pieces in the pan though, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Thanks though, and I will prolly make it again, but just for him.

Like other reveiwers, I found this a little bland as written, so I added some spices and parmasean to add flavor.  I also felt it was a little greasy or fatty tasting because of the heavy cream. If I made it again, I would substitute something else for part of the cream.

I cooked the sauce, and without even tasting it first, decided that a creamy sauce should have some butter. So I added 4 or 5 tablespoons of butter and then a decent amount of parm and it was amazing. I put it over steak and it was great.

I used this sauce on a grilled chicken and pasta dish that I was making and it was FAB-U-LOUS. I've never made a creamy sauce from scratch that was as simple as this one. Thanks for sharing this recipe Aussiedave1. I will be using this one occasionally.

I used milk instead of water and tripled the about of garlic I put in.  I sauce looks good, but first takes bland with a fat oil taste, then has a garlic after taste.  I didn't like this recipe at all, my hubby said that it was okay.

Wonderful. Made as is and I thought it had plenty of garlic taste. I triples this recipe as I used this as a sauce for a vegetarian lasanga. Will always remember this creamy recipe to add to many more dishes!

Bland and no flavor. I had to rescue it by adding a jar of pre-made tomato pasta sauce.

Tried it, loved it. Added chopped garlic (in jar) from produce section of the store and used that instead of fresh garlic - but it has the same outcome as fresh garlic. I doubled the entire recipe to make a double batch then added sauteed garlic chicken and pasta. Served on a bed of fresh greenbeans from the garden - also sauteed in garlic. It was divine. Kids loved it and leftovers were even eaten cold it was so good. Also, I added fresh taragon instead of parsley. Made it delicious. Highly recommend it.

I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I only used garlic powder.  I was afraid that the sauce would be too bland, but was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was.  I used it as pizza sauce, and loved it!

Sauce was goo but if you follow the directions to the T it will not thicken in the 3 mins. I left mine alone for a min or two and it was great.

Nobody in my home cared for this sauce at all. It was very bland and very runny. It made way more then I thought it would also. I tried to add some more garlic, parm cheese, and butter but it was just never right. I would definately not use this recipe again.

Made this, didn't add any garlic powder, so I added two extra garlic gloves minced. After that I added some diced red paprika and onion and let is sit for a while. Next I prepared some fresh shrimps, cooked it a little with some linguini pasta and then poured the sauce in it. Tasted amaxing

It was very easy but I found it a bit bland. Will have to add some strong cheese perhaps next time.

I will DEFINITELY make this again, and again and again! This is an awesome recipe! I like to add chunks of garlic chicken and use it as a sauce on bow tie noodles. Definitely make this! You won't be sorry!

This was OK, but pretty bland. I would use at least twice that much garlic, and even more garlic powder. It also took way longer than 3 minutes to thicken; more like 8. It's a good start. This made about twice as much as I needed to mix with a pound of steamed broccoli, so I can play with what's left for another use.

My son and I just love Garlic, added two more teaspoons of Garlic and a tablespoon of powder. I also added some roasted garlic mix and it came out perfect. (for me) I found this recipe a great start for what I wanted. I am using this to smother my chicken wings. MMM MMM Good

As most of the other reviews stated, it was pretty bland. However, I made many changes of my own which helped a lot! First of all, I used milk instead of water and added about 2 tablespoons of butter. I also added more garlic, paprika, mozzarella cheese, and basil. None of this made much of a difference until I added about 2 ounces of cream cheese. SSOOO MUCH BETTER!!!!

We used milk and butter instead of  heavy cream to make a slightly thinner sauce and it worked really well on a pizza instead of red sauce 10/10 would use again.

Thank you for this recipe, it was a lifesaver at my boss' potluck bbq yesterday! I tried to make this as close to the recipe, but for my purpose I omitted the cream and cornstarch, and added about 3\4 cup of butter to my two medium size bags of frozen corn, 2 oven roasted garlics, otherwise made this the yummiest dressing\sauce to use!! Its very versatile :)

Sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked.  Not a terrible sauce but not fantastic over the top either.  I added extra garlic powder since it makes a very large amount of sauce.  It would have been far to weak otherwise.  Serving size should say for 8 people, not 4.  Will try again sometime with a few extra seasons to flavor it more.

Very easy to make. The cream should not be frozen so only make one batch at a time. If it spoils as it get old, no problem because it's so easy to just make a new batch.

We weren't fans of this sauce. It just didn't taste that great and the consistency was a wee bit too thick, even with the given measurements. Maybe with some additions it could be more palatable.
