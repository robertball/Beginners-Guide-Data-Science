The idea of basil in ice cream seems odd but it really is very good.  A nice refreshing summer treat that is "different".

I have been looking for a way to use chocolate mint from my garden for years!  I used chocolate mint leaves instead of the basil, and added vanilla as the liquer.
You have to be careful not to overcook this.  It went from almost coating to no longer coating very quickly.  It was very tasty though!

This recipe was great. I added some more chopped basil just before freezing to increase the flavor. All of my friends and family loved it.

I love trying new stuff, and I'm very curious about odd food that I always want to taste; so did I whith this ice cream. I gotta say it is a good one... but I'm pretty sure I won't make it again, for it's a bit too special to me. If you really do love basil, try it though, or you won't be able to tell if you like basil ice cream or not (always very impressive when in company ;)  )

I wouldn't eat a huge bowl of this, but it really is great.  It is very refreshing.  It has a nice flavor, but is not heavy and super sweet like many ice creams.  Perfect for a too hot to move summer day.

In Italy they serve this Basil Ice Cream, The first time I heard of it I said "Yuk", but my tune changed drastically after my first taste. Try this recipe you'll love it.

Very interesting flavor and yummy.  I was worried the hubby would be weirded out by the idea of basil ice cream, but he actually ate a good serving!

This is an interesting recipe, but my home-grown basil was clearly more potent than called for; my husband took one bite and said, "this tastes like pesto." I would have preferred a hint of basil, not basil-a-rama. We really didn't eat it and all of the work and ingredients went to waste, sadly.
