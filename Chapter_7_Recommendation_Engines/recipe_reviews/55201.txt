I was leary of trying this recipe using the microwave and it did not work for me.  It is too difficult to keep checking the candy thermometer for proper temp.  I threw out the entire first batch which overcooked, and started again using a pan on the stove.  I let the candy thermometer reach soft ball and followed directions from there and it turned out perfectly.  I also added 1/2 cup walnuts and it was perfect!

This is a perfect Maple Fudge recipe IF you cook in the traditional way..in a pan on the stove till soft ball stage.  Omit the beating in the ice water..just stir for a while until it starts to thicken and pour into a greased pan.  Made the microwave method and didn't work for me!!!  Great flavor and texture.

This was my first time trying to make fudge and I was pleased!  I used the stovetop instead of the microwave as well, and it worked!  I think that I beat it a little too much because the texture doesn't seem quite right to me, it flakes when I cut it into pieces. It still tastes good, and I have used the flaky bits in with a chocolate chip cookie recipe and they were great!

I should have read the other reviews more closely, as I broke my glass bowl when I put it in the water.  Then, obviously, the liquid fudge all went down the drain.  After I calm down and am not so upset, I might try this recipe again the right way - the stove top.

Perfection! This is what we call fudge in my country (Trinidad and Toabgo) First I halved this recipe for two reasons - 1. the amount it claims to make and 2. the bad reviews, but I was really craving this sweet and hoped it would turn out like the type I buy here. First I left out the ice bath step and followed the recipe using the stove top instead of the microwave and I let it cook on low heat till it reached 240 degrees on my candy thermometer. I swiftly removed it from the heat and added in 1 tbsp of butter (yes, I put in more butter, if making the full recipe I'd use 2 tbsps) and the maple extract, then took my whisk and put my strength into it and beat it for about 1 -2 minutes till it stopped looking like caramel and more glossy and thick. From here it is race to pour it into your waiting dish cause it starts to set up almost immediately! I scored my fudge and left it to cool for about an hour at room temp. and it is perfect! Exactly what I wanted. Smooth, melt in your mouth, delicious fudge! Now my beef with the serving size - I got way less than this recipe says, unless you are cutting this the size of mints maybe. I will be making this again and the full recipe too! Thanks for sharing.

I'm not exactly sure why this recipe is called fudge but it is not. I should have realized something was wrong when looking at the recipe but it is missing the bulk....marshmellows, mm cream or whatever. This is much more similar to a caramel recipe but even though i've had my fair share of candy making in the past and followed the directions to a "T" it came out very grainy. It did have a good flavor though.

This tastes just like the maple fudge my Gramma used to make during Christmas. She always added chopped walnuts to hers. I prefer chopped pecans. Good stuff, and very easy. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I got a new microwave oven, and i guess the power makes a difference to the cooking time, because when i made a batch as before, it set faster than i could get it in the dish.  It was crumbly, but i love this recipe so much that i couldnt give up without tweaking the microwave cooking time.  I lessened the time by 2 minutes, and it worked out! 

The original name of this recipe is "sucre-a-creme", but i changed it to fudge so that others would have a point of reference.  I agree its not exactly fudge, however i prefer this to any fudge i have everly tried.

It made 30 pieces.

This is a good recipe, but not for fudge. The end result ends up being much like maple-flavored toffee. My mother-in-law and I decided we would just tell people we made maple toffee instead of maple fudge. :p.
The only change we made was using a half cup of maple syrup (we were out of maple extract) and then just added a half cup less brown sugar. It tastes really good, it's just not fudge. At all.

Makes a great maple candy...not really a fudge (at least for me). Very similar to the Canadian Maple Sugar Candy!

Like the other reviews I made this the traditional way. I didn't have cream so I substituted milk and upped the butter to 2 tablespoons. It's a lovely flavor but a bit too chewy to be fudge! I rolled mine after it had cooled a bit into ball candies.

Fudge? Uhh... no. More like a really, really tasty caramel sauce. Using the stovetop I followed the recipe up to the sink immersion bit because I didn't want to waste a bunch of water and ice. Possibly that affected how it set? I let it reach 236 and then turned off the heat and just stirred it for a while until it cooled. Never hardened into fudge.

Did not have any luck with the fudge. Took others advice and cooked it on the stove and still did not turn out well. Came out very gritty and did not form like fudge should. Flavor was good but I was disappointed with the final results.

I tried this recipe, microwaving for only 6 1/2 minutes, and it turned out just fine.  I also doubled the maple flavoring, which made it more satiating with less.

After reading some reviews I didn't even bother trying the microwave and did it on the stove. It turned out awesome and is everyone's new favorite fudge.
