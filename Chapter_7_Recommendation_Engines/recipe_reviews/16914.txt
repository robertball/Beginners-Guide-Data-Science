I improvised a lot on this recipe.  I needed a quick barbecue sauce.  I only used 1 Cup of ketchup, 1 Cup Water, 2 TBSP Brown Sugar, salt/pepper, 2 TBSP Butter (melted) and mixed them all together and popped the bowl in the microwave and 3 minutes later it was perfect! I used it on pulled pork sandwhiches I slow cooked all day long.

This was pretty good barbecue sauce recipe.  I normally like it a little sweeter and a little spicier. I made 1 batch with the recipe as described, but found it sort of bland.  So I made another, but this time I sauteed the onion with some chili powder in the melted butter, added a tablespoon of brown sugar, replaced the celery seed and green pepper with a stalk of celery, and swapped the lemon juice for lime juice.  That was just the kick it needed!  The second way only took about 5 minutes more.  The basic sauce is definitely worth a try, and lends itself well to some creativity!

A basic bbq sauce should include: 32oz of ketchup, 1 cup brown surgar, 1/3c of worchestershire sauce, and 1/4c vinegar. This recipe would work if you increase brown surgar and added the worchestershire sauce and vinegar. Hot pepper sauce or cayenne pepper optional.

This sauce did not turn out for me at all. It might have been me b/c I added extra ingredients, such as liquid smoke, worcestershire sauce, & a tiny bit of cajun seasoning.  I slow cooked chicken in it all day and by the end, the celery seed was way too overpowering, you could even bite the seeds. Plus it was too ketchupy for me.  I followed the recipe, except for my add-ins.  I ended up mixing in some store bought barbecue sauce just to try to tone down the strong celery taste. I want to try it again using less ketchup and maybe just a little celery salt instead.

I thought this recipe had good flavor, however, I was looking more for a barbecue sauce I could use to dip nuggets in.  This was runny. I tried cooking it a little to try to thicken it up, but it didn't help much.  This may be a great recipe for items cooked slowly, but was not very good for a dipping sauce

I used this recipe as a building block to create my own quick BBQ sauce. I added a splash of orange juice, minced garlic, and drained cut peaches to the sauce. I omitted the green bell pepers, mustard powder salt, celery seed and lemon juice. My version of this BBQ sauce came out quit nice, with a tangy taste. Poured the BBQ sauce over some chops.

It was an ok, basic recipe.  If you want a base sauce that you can then start experimenting your own ingredients with, then this is the one.  I ended up adding 2 TBl worcitershire sauce an additional TBl of brown sugar and then use 2 TBl of cornstarch to thicken.

Loved it!  It was super easy to make and had great flavor.  I ended up simmering some leftover pot roast meat in the sauce and made shredded BBQ sandwiches.  My husband couldn't stop praising it!

Do not shout How could you rate it when you haven't made it! I have a suggestion, instead of using the ketchup, I have made a sauce doing this: reduce a can of stewed tomatoes by half. I will try this and comment (I am also looking for a barbecue that doesn't have all the preservatives; I made one of the recipes for barbecue beans and it was even delicious by itself-one from this site).

Sauce was ok, went well with my shredded pork for sandwiches... but too much celery seed. I would recommend cutting the amount of celery seed or just using celery salt instead.

I thought this was great!  I used it over short ribs in the slow cooker and it was very flavorful.  Loved the peppery taste.  I added 1 Tbsp Worchestershire, but otherwise made as written.   It is a tad runny.

I rated 4 because I did some tinkering to the recipe. I added more brown sugar. I doubled the recipe so I added about another 1/3 cup. I also added Worcestershire sauce. I added a teaspoon of that. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little bit of kick. The flavor is really good!!

This is a great guidline. I blend everything but the water and then add water to get the right consistency. I usually use about half the water. Substitutions that work just fine: lime for lemon, agave nectar for brown sugar, prepared mustard for dry.  I usually add Worcestershire sauce and a few drops of fish sauce for additional flavor.

Great basic barbecue  sauce. Used for pulled pork sandwiches.  Tasted great!  My husband  liked it and he is real picky about barbecue  sauce.  Thank you. My new favorite.

I had just cooked a pork loin and realized I was out of BBQ sauce. Just enough of a brand name for my husband.  I threw this recipe together super quick, I omitted the bell pepper as I have made some in the past with bell peppers and didn't like them personally.  I didn't add celery salt as I am out.  I cut the recipe in half and it turned out perfect.    No ketchup flavor more me at all and a tad sweet.       Love the flavor, I missed the smoke flavoring so added just about a tablespoon of liquid smoke.  Perfect.    This is a great starter recipe for any BBQ sauce.   Possibilities are endless of what you can build on to it for your own personal taste.    I hate vinegar and worcestershire sauce for BBQ sauces, this is one of the first base recipes I've found without it and I love it!

I liked this sauce.  I have to say:  I only put in some of the ingredients.  I put in the ketchup, water, mustard powder, brown sugar, salt, and lemon juice.  I have stomach problems, so a barbecue sauce that is mild, and not too spicy or rich, is a good one for me.  It could have had more flavor, but it probably would have if I had put in all of the ingredients.

I like a spicy bbq sauce, so, I omitted the green pepper, cut the Ketchup in half, I added a Tbsp of pepper flakes, a Tbsp of Tabasco sauce, cut back the salt, since all I had was celery salt. A tsp of garlic powder, about 1/4c of grape jelly, a Tbsp of Worchestershire sauce, a tsp of vinegar, a tsp of molasses, I pretty much doctored it up until I liked it!! oh, & a cornstarch slurry so it would thicken abit since it was so runny, I also tripled it since I needed a big batch! I used it in a crockpot of sliced smoked sausage for gameday!! YUMM-O!!

Overall, this is a nice, pleasant tasting sauce. It is perfect for those of us who don't like hot spicy or vinegary BBQ. The sauce turned out thinner than I prefer so I simmered it on the stove for about 30 minutes. Thank you for sharing.
