I made this for Thanksgiving and it was terrible.  I don't know why they call it "classic" because we never had Cheez Whiz in our green bean casserole growing up.  I thought it sounded good so I tried it anyway and nobody liked it.  It went down the garbage disposal.

I loved the added CHEEZ WHIZ to this dish, it made the whole dish smooth and tasty!  However, my only recommendation would be to use canned or lightly steamed beans, the texture of the beans will be much softer.

Thanks Kraft!

Quite good. I did not put the Cheeze whiz in it tho. I used cheddar cheese and I added some cooked crumbled bacon as well. Everyone liked it.

In a frantic search for "the" green bean casserole recipe, I found this.  My family made this alot, but this one was very rich.  Maybe it was the Cheez Whiz?  And I dont know what happened, but it came out a little watery.  I would have left it in the oven longer, but it looked like it was burning. ;_;  I found another recipe that doesnt call for cheezwhiz, and it turned out ok! It -was- an interesting taste though!

This recipe was a bit rich with the cheese-wiz.  I prefer it with regular cheddar or american cheese instead.  My family liked it though.

I didnt have any cheese whiz on hand so I just used shredded cheddar cheese.  I Thought that is was too soupy.  I got more of the taste of the soup then I did of the green beans and I am not much of a cream of mushroom soup fan, I made it for the beans not the soup.  My kids refused to eat it so most of it just ended up in the trash.

Sorry.  Was really disappointed in this one.  The flavours dont go well together.  I served this as one of the many side dishes for my Christmas dinner, and this is the only one that came back untouched!

Delicious and easy! It was a big hit! Obviously, changing the ingredients will make it taste different... so stick with the recipe! The cheez whiz makes it!

Wow!  Cheez Whiz, who would've thunk it?  I had made the traditional green bean casserole many times as the rather ordinary, expected side dish.

Thanksgiving came around and I was hoping to offer this traditional recipe with a twist.  The best part of the "twist" came quite by accident.  I bought what I thought was regular Cheez Whiz but when the time for cooking came it turned out to be a Cheez Whiz salsa con queso - cheesy salsa!  Well, too late now!  I added it and the results were fantastic!  The guests loved it!  One more for the recipe box!

This received mixed reviews.  Half our crowd thought it was okay and the others did thought it was too cheesy.   Iâ€™ll go back to the original w/o cheese next time.

I usually make the "traditional" side of the soup can green bean casserole but thought we'd give this a try. Not a fan-it tastes like cheese whiz and salt.

I liked this recipe, but did not like it as much as the traditional recipe on the Campbell's can.  I could definitely taste the Cheez-Whiz in it, but did not really like the combo with mushroom soup.

This recipe was a hit this 4th of July!
I dislike green beans, but the Cheese Whiz covers up the green bean flavor.  I though it was good.
I followed the recipe using Cheese Whiz light & substituting cream of celery soup for cream of mushroom.

My whole family LOVED THIS!  I made it for Xmas for last year.  I swore I would never make Green Bean Casserole because I really didn't like it and it was always around during Xmas at my grandma's.  Well I saw this and tried it, and since we all like it so much I will keep doing it!
