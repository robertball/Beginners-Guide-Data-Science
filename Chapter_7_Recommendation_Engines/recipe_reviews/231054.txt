I am not a beer drinker, but this tastes like chocolate milk. As another reviewer stated you have to chug it or it curdles. I live in Ireland and when in the USA introduced this to my Irish husband. He had never heard of it and we got him so drunk, the next morning before awake he was shouting "INCOMING"

An important missing piece to this recipe is that you need to drink the whole thing immediately, because the Bailey's will curdle from the whiskey.

Something about the proportions of this recipe wasn't quite right. I got the idea of the taste, but something was off. I kept playing around with the measurements, and I got a little closer, but I will have to play with it more. If you follow this recipe exactly, be prepared to chug very, very, very quickly. It seems like the Bailey's curdles up almost instantly. Once it does, the drink is no good.

I did this on a dare. I am not a "drinker". Now I do it once a year to remember the occasion. I cannot acquire a taste for beer as much as I would like to as my husband enjoys it occasionally. The important thing in this drink is as soon as the shot glass is dropped in, you have to chug it or it curdles. It really does taste like chocolate milk. As for the name, in response to another review, there are a lot of crude names but I think it is in reference to the whiskey and Irish cream and how much liquor is in this drink. I don't think it was meant to offend anyone.
