I needed a quick sidedish and this was it.  This recipe gets extra points from me for being so quick, easy and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again! I did add about double the amount of margarine and a little more salt.  GREAT!

Why didn't I think of this a long time ago???  These were sooo simple and so quick.  Talk about a time saver.  I sprinkled garlic powder and some italian seasonings over the potatoes and used 4 tbls of butter like another reviewer.  They needed it.  I sprinkled some parmesan cheese over the finished product.  Will resort to this one again when pressed for time.  Thanks Jon.

My hubby and his buds take the trailer to fishing sites every couple months for 5-6 days. I'm always looking for easy recipes for them. This turned out to be something they could do with not much preparation. To cut down further on the prep work, they decided to use baby red potatoes so they didn't have to peel or cube them, and used garlic powder in place of the minced garlic. Needless to say they loved 'em and are taking this recipe on the next trip.Its a definite keeper! Thanks Jon!

As suggested by reviewers, I increased the spices.  These potatoes were easy and quite good, warmed up well the next day, and definitely will be included in future meals.

For being a microwave dish, these were pretty tasty. I used more of all the spices.

I always use my Pampered Chef "micro steamer" to make potatoes when I'm in a rush, I loved the addition of the herbs & spices in this no brainer side dish!  Great for these nice summer nights when you just wanna hang out with some neighbors.  This also works well if you slice the potatoes (with skin on).  Thanks Jon!

I can't decide which I like more about these = the simplicity of the taste or the simplicity of the recipe!! These were great! I was making salmon tonight that bakes in 15-20 min and I needed a quick sidedish! Found this recipe and Bada Bing! I too used a little more butter (4 Tbls) and a little more S&P to taste. I was also pretty generous with the onions and garlic...but we like garlic and onions. Potatoes came out of the microwave just as the salmon was coming out of the oven! Thanks sooo much Jon for this great and easy recipe!! I'll use this one again in the future!!

I don't know.  Maybe if I'd had the "real" thing, I'd think these were close; but, not knowing how fabulous the real thing is, I can't appreciate the big timesaving factor or even the taste.  I had diced potatoes with onions, garlic & butter.  Good, but nothing to go crazy over.

Who thought you could make tasty potatoes in the microwave?  These take a little bit of prep work, but it is very easy and they taste phenomenal.

These were quite tasty. And they certainly take a lot less time to cook than oven roasted potatoes.

Love it, both for its taste and simplicity! Used baby red potatoes, butter, and monterey steak seasoning (which contains garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika). Poured the melted butter over the potatoes & onions. Came out tasting more like roasted potatoes than boiled potatoes, which surprised me. Excellent taste, and only 15 minutes from start to finish.

I thought this recipe was a 5 in ease and a 4 in taste.
Really good if you are in a pinch for time. Next time I'll reduce the amount of butter used. (We don't use margarine)
Really yummy. 3 out of 3 kids under 7 agree!

I wasn't expecting much from a microwaved potatoes recipe, but this turned out great!  I omitted the onion and doubled the garlic and all the spices except salt.  Also used butter instead of margarine.  Once the potatoes were fully cooked (it did take my microwave about 5 minutes longer), I stirred in some Parmesan.  Yum!  Easy & delicious!

Fantastic!!! Since everyone in my household works, this was the perfect solution.  I made a few adjustments; slice the potatoes, melt the butter, use garlic powder. I layered melted butter, potatoes, sprinkled each of the seasonings, onio, then repeated. Took about 15 min. to cook and stirred half way through.

Very easy! I wanted a quick potato recipe for breakfast for dinner (baked poached eggs and apple cake). Easy cleanup and my kitchen didn't smell like grease afterwards, which is what I was looking for. I used more margarine as suggested by reviewers.

Very simple and very good!  Use whatever seasonings you like.  Leftovers make delicious hash browns.

Oh my are these good.  My husband said he honestly can't tell the difference between these and the Lyonnaise potatoes at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I was looking for a potato side dish to make in the microwave while a pork loin was roasting in the oven.  My tips:   I doubled the onion, thinly sliced three fresh cloves of garlic, used 4 TBSP real butter, left the potato skins on, and my best tip is to use red pepper.   Even if you don't like hot things, it doesn't really make it hot, just brings out the flavor.   I use my palm to sprinkle the red pepper in first, and THEN add to dish.  Just wash hands so you don't get pepper in eyes.  These are a keeper... thank you!  Enjoy!

I wanted to have Lyonnaise potatoes and not have to turn the oven on during a 90 degree day. This recipe was the ticket. I added some chopped parsley for color. It was a hit!

This was good, but it took about 20-30 minutes for me to cook in the microwave.  Maybe I had too many potatoes, but for it to have taken that amount of time, I would have preferred to just stick it in a regular oven.

Great recipe! So easy!  I too sliced my potatoes and when they were all done in the microwave, I topped them with shredded cheddar and parmesan and threw it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt and brown.  Really good!

I've made these a little differently before, but I love the paprika and oregano in this recipe. Added some cheddar and parmesan cheese at the end and mixed in.  Will be a regular addition to my meals.

Like another reviewer, I had to cook these for 5 minutes longer than the recipe stated. That said, they were a big hit with the other half who suggested substituting cayenne for paprika next time.

This dish is fantastic!  It gets requested by the whole family quite often.  Only change I've made is to double the seasonings.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It was both delicious and easy!  I added the 4 tbsp butter as other reviewers had suggested and the potatoes seemed to swim in the butter.  Next time I'll cut back on the butter, but I'll definitly make this again!

I was out of fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder . Used 1/8 teaspoon Mrs. Dash seasoning.  Came out great. Easy to make and tasted good.  I will make it again.

I added only half the butter and used the other half sour cream.  It was delicious, but next time I will use only sour cream and water because they were a little too oily for me.

I thought these were okay. I had some mini potatoes, 1 lb, I wanted to use up. I must have a small microwave, though, because these potatoes took 25 minutes! I did halve all the ingredients due to the amount of potatoes in the bag I had didn't look like much. When finished, they sort of reminded me of a breakfast potato with the type of seasonings. They were easy to do as I used the mini potatoes and didn't have to peel them. Before serving, I cut them in half and added a little garlic salt. Went fine with a meal today for an easy side.

Super easy recipe.  We have a dairy allergy so I subbed the margarine for olive oil, and it was fantastically easy.

Took 5 minutes to prep using my food processor.  I used the slice attachment to slice the potatoes and onions very quickly.  I always ate these for breakfast at the dining hall in college, but I might use this as a super easy dinner side.

I've made this twice now and will continue to make it when I need a quick sidedish for the family. I double the oregano, leave out the salt and just use a sprinkle of garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. I also think one small onion is sufficient. Ten minutes was just right in my microwave.

It doesnt get any easier.  I used small potatoes that I just into 4 or six bite sized pieces.  I didnt have paprika but did throw in rosemary that we like.  Super simple while the chicken cooked on the grill for a quick lunch.  Use more spices if you like to really taste them.

I used this recipe all the time.  I take red potatoes and leave the skin on.  Garlic salt to replace the garlic and add parsley.  I also double or triple the margarine or butter, whatever I have on hand. And, I leave out the onions, pepper, paprika, and oregano.  I guess I use this recipe for the base, but it turns out wonderful every time.  Sometimes I use it for breakfast and mix it in with a little scrambled eggs and cheese.  Yum

Pretty good for a microwave dish!  It took more than 10 minutes to cook.  I suppose it depends on the size of your potato cubes.  I cooked mine for about 18 minutes, stirring every 3 or 4 minutes.  For the last 4 minutes I put the lid on and then let it sit covered another 5 minutes after I took it out of the microwave.

I want to say Thank you to the previous brave reviewers.  If it wasn't for all of you, I would never have tried this recipe.  What a lovely surprise! The only drawback for me was a little too much onion but that's probably just me and easily fixed for the next time. Great recipe for when hunger outweighs time.

A great way to make potatoes when you have steaks on the grill & don't want to heat up your kitchen with the oven!  Had great flavor.... I too covered it in plastic wrap & let it sit for a while - very moist!

This was delicious. Recently my "real" oven died, so I have been trying to learn how to cook in the microwave. Although my measurements and timing are casual and approximate, and I should note I covered the dish with plastic wrap and allowed several minutes standing time, and used real butter, the end result was delectable. The onion/garlic flavor is very subtle and throughout the potatoes. This is a great side dish with beef, and does not require additional fat.

Awesome easy tasty recipe. I made this mostly according to instructions but with 2 large potatoes and 1 jumbo onion.  Next time I will make better use of the "potato" button on my microwave to take the guesswork out of the timing.  Also Im going to try using 1/3 or less of the butter OR substituting just a bit of olive oil.  This dish can be as flavorful as you like and probably doesnt *need* very much oil at all.

These were decent, but maybe because they were microwaved we didn't love them.  I would make them again, but my husband vetoed.  Not a bad recipe though for a quick side dish!

Hate to give any bad reviews but...these potatoes were very bland. I followed the recipe to a T and they had no flavor. So then I tried to add seasoning and even cheese to no avail!

Great recipe for a quick side dish.  Even my 11 yr old boy who doesn't like potatoes too much liked this.

Good potatoes!  Never occurred to me to do something like this with the microwave.  What I did differently... sliced the potatoes (next time will just cube the the recipe says), added oregano, salt, pepper, rosemary and marjoram.  Couldn't find the paprika until it was already cooking and totally forgot about the garlic.  Oops!  I'll bet it would have been good with that, too.  Oh well, tasted good anyway!  And I had some leftover sliced provolone so after it was done, I ripped up the cheese and mixed it in.  Tasted even better!  Anyway, give this a shot if you don't have a lot of time but want something better than potato flakes for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were okay, i think there was something missing. They needed a little texture to them. If i can think of a way then i will make them again.

My husband and daughter loved this.  it is very surprising considering it is like pulling teeth to get my daughter to eat potatoes.

So easy!  Didn't make it with onions but added some additional spices: garlic salt, onion powder, minced onion pieces, italian herbs, rosemary and finnes herbes.
