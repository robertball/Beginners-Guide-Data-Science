I couldn't find the cooking creme so I used regular cream cheese and just mashed it on top of the chicken.  Came out tasty anyway.  Hopefully the cooking creme becomes more readily available because I would love to try the real recipe.

As a non cook, will not attempt changes to a good thing - even an inexperienced cook like me can make this delicious recipe!
