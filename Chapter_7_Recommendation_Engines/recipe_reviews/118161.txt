This is one of my favorite taste of home recipes.  I put a little cornmeal on my pizza pan before pressing the crust into it.  It makes the crust crispier on the bottom.  I eyeball the quantities and adjust it to our tastes and cut all of the chicken and veggie pieces into bite size chunks.  If you cut up your chicken and veggies the night before, this is a quick and easy recipe to throw together after work.

It was very good. My sister and I were going to make chicken fajitas but we had decided to try something different. We  made the recipe as is but next time I think that I will cut back on the cumin. But none the less, it was very good.

I've made this pizza a few times and love it!  The recipe I had doesn't have cumin so I haven't tried it with it.  Instead of using canned crust I use a 1/2 recipe of Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and baked it for 20 minutes.  I did not prebake the crust.

Excellent! If you like fajitas, you will enjoy this. The only changes I made were mostly in quantity: I used extra salsa, cut the chicken in bite-size pieces, used a whole onion and pepper, and added some Mexican-blend cheese.

Very good flavor!  I used the breast meat only that was leftover from the Roast Sticky Rotisserie Chicken I made.  I think next time I would drain the liquid from the salsa, as it runs down and gets the crust soggy as you take pieces of the pizza out.  I made this on a 12 in. pizza stone and with all of the toppings it ended up being about 2 1/2 inches tall, definitely had to eat with a fork!  My kids liked it with sour cream on top.  This will be a repeat.

This is a great recipe!!  I made a few minor adjustments.  I cut the chicken and green pepper into bite size pieces.  I also spread the salsa on first like you would normally do with pizza sauce.  I used Cheddar Jack cheese.  I will be making this often!!

I enjoyed this. I spread some refried beans on the crust and then topped it with the chicken mixture and cheese. I left the salsa off since I was hoping that my 2 year old would try it. I topped my slice with salsa, chopped tomatoes and a smidgen of sour cream, diced avocados would be great as well.

This was delicious.  Easy and quick, I enjoyed the flavors together!  SO YUMMY.  I'm saving this one.  I had a slice at one in the morning, while I was up with the baby....it was cold and it tasted even better than it did warm!  Keeper!

Very good. Maybe it's just my oven, but cook time should be much shorter- after 5 minutes in the 425 degree oven the crust was browned, and when toppings were added, only needed 1-2 minutes to melt the cheese. Substituted garlic powder (1 tsp.) for the clove, and added corn meal to the bottom of the crust as another reviewer suggested. We served topped with lettuce & tomatoes. Very delicious, and a  quick weeknight meal. Only recommendation I have is to use a thicker crust or make your own as it has to hold these heavier toppings- the store bought one didn't really cut it.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Everyone else wanted traditional pizza, but I wanted to try somthing a little different.  Guess which pizza was gone first?  It was way beyond yummy, and I highly recommend.

The peppers and onions really make this dish. Make sure they're cooked long enough and you'll have a great pizza.

I'm giving this 5 stars...I thought it was one of the best pizzas I've made...the only thing I did differently was I used homemade pizza crust instead of the refrigerated dough.  2 of my children found it to be too spicy but I also used hot salsa...I'm going to keep thise recipe although next time I may use a milder salsa so more of the family can enjoy it.

I was so happy to find this recipe.  DH loves pizza and I love fajitas, so this was a perfect combination for us.  Instead of refrigerated crust I used Jay's signature pizza crust from this site.  Subbed pepper jack cheese for the monterey jack as that was what we had on hand.  Great pizza, one I will make regularly.  DH loved the flavor of the chicken topping so much he licked the skillet cleaner than the dog does her food dish!

Very yummy! I made my own pizza crust (Whole Wheat and Honey from this site) added red pepper and only used a pinch of salt. Next time I'll drain the salsa because it made the crust soggy in a few areas.

Mmmm delicious...I made a few modifications though.  Grilled the chicken, brushing with BBQ sauce.  Didn't have salsa on hand so I used a can of pizza sauce and chopped up a tomato from my garden.  No cumin or salt, added fresh basil.  Used fresh mozarella cheese (a personal fave).  My Mom said it was the best pizza she's ever tasted.  Thanks for the great recipe idea!

Wow, I made this last night and it was a hit! My husband is pretty picky but he LOVED this recipe! Next time I will strain the salsa so that it won't flood the pizza and make it soggy, but other than that, perfect!

I used cresant rolls because I was out of pizza crust, and also put a thin layer of Ranch dressing on the crust to add a little more flavor when it came out of the oven, then placed all the toppings on. Was a HUGE hit with our family of 5 and my Grandmother even enjoyed it too! :)

My family loved this recipe.  I went with other people's suggestions and lowered the amount of cumin to just a few sprinkles.  This is definitely one that I will make time and again.  It really had a good flavor.  My step daughter said it was the best pizza she had ever had (she's 18 years old)!

Instead of refrigerated pizza dough, I used two whomp-containers of reduced fat crescent rolls and baked them together on a 9x13 baking sheet like one big "crust". I used two organic red bell peppers, and my own fajita marinade, fajita seasoning and salsa. (I did pre-marinate my meat for extra flavor.) I spread the salsa over the crust before adding the fajita ingredients, then the cheese. I broiled it just slightly to melt the cheese. We really enjoyed this. Not really much more complicated than making fajitas and it was a nice new twist. I think using the homemade seasonings and salsa made it even better.

This was easy and fantastic! The only change I made was to put the salsa under the chicken and veggies like a sauce, I also used more than the recipe recommended. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  I had a thin crust and I didnt pay attention to that and the cooking time, so my crust was a little too done but it still had a good flavor.  Thank you for sharing.

2nd time - I used store bought grilled chicken breasts and cubed them.  I used a store bought pizza crust.  It was delish.  My 7 yr old picky niece asked for more.

This recipe is SUPER yummy!  I used canned crescent rolls for the crust instead of pizza crust.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was DELISH!

I made this the other night and loved it.  Used a whole green pepper and a whole onion, and a 16 oz jar of Herdez hot salsa.  I also added some black olives on top over the cheese.  Great recipe!

AMAZING!!  Didn't change a thing.  Brought it to a luncheon with some friends and family.  Everyone loved it better than Papa Murphys pizza that was there. My sister in law asked for the recipe too.

This was quite tasty and even my "vanilla" husband liked it :)  I think I would prefer to leave off the salsa and substitute fresh chopped tomatoes or well-drained petite diced canned tomatoes.  I also followed the suggestion of using a Mexican cheese blend.

My family and friends loved this. I made a few changes though. First, I ommited the cumin and I put the salsa on first and then the chicken mixture and then the cheese. I also used mexican blend cheese. I ended up having to make two of them for 5 of us. Great recipe. thanks.

Made this the other night as written except I had an orange pepper that needed to be used.  So, I used a whole orange pepper plus half of a green pepper.  The salsa was pretty skimpy, I may put it on the crust first so I can spread it around or just increase the salsa.  It worked fine for us since we left one end of the pizza without salsa for our two toddlers.  Our three year old wouldn't touch the pizza and our one year old ate everything we put on the plate.  We enjoyed the flavors.  We'll make it again.

This was good.  My taste buds weren't crying out for more though.  I used homemade pizza crust. Maybe I'll make this again, but it won't be monthly.

This pizza was delicious and easy to make! I made my own my crust instead of using a refrigerated one. I will definitely be making this one again!

Awesome!  I grilled the chicken first, then mixed with the onions/green peppers.  I used red onions.  Great flavor....very good.

I used Jay's signature pizza crust from this site which is terrific, but the pizza toppings were just okay. I will not be making this again.

I followed the recipe, but the crust burned on the edges and was soft in the middle.  Very frustrating!!!
