Honestly, I find it tastes like beans + veggies + tomato sauce... not really my cup of tea. I'd prefer it with meat or pasta!

This is a very delicious vegetarian (don't tell anyone) chili!

I decided to substitute regular tomato sauce for the Italian sauces to better bring out the flavors of the vegetables. For the chipotle pepper, I minced 2 chipotle peppers, and for the mushrooms, I minced them as well.

I really liked this recipe. I substituted fresh tomato sauce because I had 6 Roma tomatoes that I needed to use (saute an onion in oil in the bottom of a saucepan, add minced garlic, slice 6 Roma tomatoes and saute them briefly, add one can of vegetarian broth, bring to boil and then simmer for about 15 minutes). I added about 1/2 teaspoon of basil to the tomato sauce while it was simmering and 1 tablespoon of chili powder to the entire mixture. I cooked this in a crock pot on high for about 4 hours and the flavors came out quite well. I will definitely make this again. This is a good recipe that can be made the night before and then placed in a slow cooker on low for about 4 hours.
