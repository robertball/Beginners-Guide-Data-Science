We really enjoyed this!  It was our first time using Fuyu persimmons, and they are delightful--they have the bite of an apple with the taste of a slightly starchy plum.  Even my 11 year old liked it!  Some crumbled goat cheese would take this salad over the top!!  Perfect for Thanksgiving ;)

I made this salad according to the recipe.  It was fantastic!  I will definitely be making it again.  It is sweet, crunchy, and a little bit tangy.  The dressing is a bit of a hassle to make, but well worth it!  Make extra and save some for later.  :-)  I used an immersion blender in the dressing to make it creamy.

We really liked this!  Different, tasty salad.  I forgot the pecans and it was still good but would be better with the crunch!

I enjoyed this recipe. Refreshingly light and perfect for fall. When I make it again I will likely grill the persimmon to unlock its natural sweetness and add some smokiness and I would bump up the acid with a little cider vinegar. As stated in an earlier, goat cheese would also add a nice tang to an already delicious salad.

Totally a keeper!!  I couldn't find any persimmon at the store so I used nectarines and pears.  Brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  There was nothing left at the end of dinner.  I suggest to use scissors and cut mixed lettuce into bite size so it's easier to serve and eat.
