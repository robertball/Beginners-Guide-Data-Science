I served this on New Year's Day, but substituted 2 cans of mexicorn for the rice and water and used 1/2 jar of hot salsa.  One large bowl of black eyed,pea salsa was gone.

I was looking for a fun way to get in the New Year's black eyed peas and this recipe is a good place to start but very, very bland as is.  Here's what we added and it was a hit at our party: 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp lime juice, 1/2 C finely chopped cilantro and salt to taste.  It was really good.  I will make it this way again for sure!

I followed recipies adding only spices,cumin,minced onion, garlic powder and parsley. It came out great. Delish with or w/o chips.  I think the addition of corn suggested by another reviews would be great!

Bland, bland, bland.  I had hopes for this recipe, but could barely eat any.  The only reason it's getting this high a rating was that I was able to make a meal out of it by adding some chicken and spices instead of having to throw it out.  Still looking for a good new year's b-e-p recipe!

This was not good.  I took it to a potluck and it was avoided like the plague.  The rice was odd in salsa.  And made the mix mushy and bland.

Normally, I don't look forward to eating black-eyed peas on New Years Day, but I tried this recipe to get rid of some stored cans of jalapeno black-eyed peas before moving, and Wow!  I loved it, my husband loved it, and even our 2-year-old son ate some.  And now that I'm pregnant, I'm actually having cravings for this stuff!  Thanks for sharing, and especially for the *healthy* craving!

Good  recipe, however, If you grew up in the South you must know that you must also have ham hock or hog jowl with those peas.

I took the advice of other reviewers and spiced it up a bit with some green salsa, chili powder, jalapenos, and lime juice.  It was good and I'll be making it again soon.
