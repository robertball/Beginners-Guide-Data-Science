I love Mangos, especially in smoothies.  Very refreshing...but tasted like an *icee*. I added plain yogurt, ground flaxseed and protein powder after tasting the original recipe to give it a creamy texture.

To get the true feel of the recipe I didn't add the strawberries or strawberry yogurt I was tempted to - I made this for Hubs this morning exactly as written.  And then I asked him to review it - here it is: "This tastes like pureed mango.  Why not just eat the mango?"

Very good.  I made the recipe as is, but like other reviewers after tasting, I wanted something more creamy so I blended in a cup of strawberry yogurt. Delicious!!!

I also left out the sugar. And I added fresh mint and a little lowfat yogurt. It was really refreshing, and without the sugar, probably pretty darn good for you.

Very refreshing, I did not add any sugar in. I just upped the amount of lime for more flavor. I only made this for myself, so I used a 1/3 mango, 1/2 a tray of ice, 1/2 a lime squeezed (was about 4 tbsps), added a good splash of water in. I blended it until it was slushie. It made about about 3/4 size of a beer glass.

The first time we made this, we added yogurt like all the reviews recommended.  My husband and I both thought the yogurt detracted from the taste of the mangoes.  The second time I made it, I added a little bit of milk instead because it didn't have enough liquid to blend in my blender.  The mango taste was much stronger and we liked it better but the kids didn't finish theirs. This recipe should be called a slushie, not a smoothie!  It's mango season here in the Caribbean and we will definitely be making this recipe again!

Very good, refreshing drink. Everyone loved it. It's mango season in St. Lucia and will make this drink again for my family.
