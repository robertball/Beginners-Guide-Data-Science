this sauce is sooo yummy, ive been making it for awhile already. But i decided to do it a little different this time. I browned the beef,onion,garlic, and pepper together, and threw all the ingredients together into the slowcooker. I used one can of crushed tomatoes, 1 can of diced italian tomatoes, and one can of tomato sauce.  Let it slow cook on low for 5 hours, with a tad bit of water. Then tossed with pasta later and topped with parm cheese. It was sooo wonderful, when you let it cook on low for a long time the flavor is just wonderful!

This is the best homemade sauce I have ever had! It is also much better than anything you can get in the store, but then again, it is homemade.  I left out the green pepper, because I didnt have any on hand, and used only diced tomatoes, because once again, that was all I had.  I also left out the sugar all together and added a can of tomato sauce (I dont care for the taste of tomato paste), 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a pinch of baking soda to take out some of the acidity, which ends up turning the acid to sugar and makes it taste a bit sweeter so it doesnt need the sugar after all!  Wonderfull recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night to go along with baked ziti. It was delicious. Although I did make several changes. I used only 1 onion, 1 tsp. of brown sugar, 1 green bell pepper. I also added mushrooms along with 1 red & yellow bell pepper. I used 1/2 ground beef & 1/2 italian sausage & added a little bit of crushed red pepper. I let it simmer for about an hour & perfecto!! This is great to use as a base recipe. You can add or take away from based on your personal preferences. Thanks Sheri!!

I used this recipe for lasagna. It is delicious! I made the sauce in the slow cooker the night before and let it cook for 4 hours. I added one tablespoon of brown sugar as suggested by the other reviewers. I took leftovers to my parent and they asked for the recipe! Thanks for sharing a terrific sauce that is already added to my recipe binder!!!! I'm looking forward to making another batch to freeze so it will be ready whenever I need it. PS-I used 2 cans of tomato sauce and two cans of whole tomatoes blended them up together; omitted the green peppers.

Absolutely the best and easiest sauce I've ever tried.  Like some previous reviewers, I cut the sugar in half and added a can of tomato paste.  I also had to leave the bell peppers out because my husband doesn't like them (but I'll make it WITH them when he's out of town).  Great sauce!!  I loved it!

My family has been making sauce like this for over a hundred years... sugar isn't exactly a great big secret. We also add just one carrot finely grated... and never, ever add oregano (too bitter)... sweet basil is IT for us, baby, but we do add parsley.. After we've browned the ground meat, pork neck bones, sausage, onion and garlic we then 'brown' one can of tomato paste before we add it to the gravy followed by a can of red wine (or water).  As far as bell peppers...eh, we never use them in gravy.

Yum!  I made this for my husband's birthday dinner and he loved it.  I will cut back on the sugar next time, it was a touch too sweet for me.  I did add crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit and let it simmer for a couple of hours.

Very nice recipe.  My secret weapon was a dash of cinnamon.  Only a dash though!

I didn't blend the tomatoes together, but I did chop up the stewed tomatoes.

I added a tbsp. of white sugar, and dark brown sugar.

I also added tomato sauce (to taste).  It needs salt and pepper for sure, and I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes.

It kept simmering and I kept adding more basil and oregano to taste.  A bay leaf is nice too.

Will make again, and will tinker with it again!

GREAT!  Picky 11-year old enjoyed it.  I took the advice of using 1 tbsp sugar and adding a can of tomato paste.  Also, only used 1 onion and 1 bell pepper and almost a 1 1/2 of hamburger.

This was a great spegetti sauce.  Easy to prepare and my kids loved it.  I don't have a blender so the tomatoes were a little big, but still all in all great stuff!!

I have tried MANY recipes trying to find a good marinara sauce that everyone in my family would like and I have finally found it.  I would cut back on the sugar and bell pepper next time, though, but it was the best so far.

A truly good recipe, made even better if prepared in the slow-cooker.  Instead of sugar, I use the advice an elderly Italian lady gave to me many years ago -- to add a generous spoonful of grape jam.  You'll never be able to detect it, but it makes a wonderful difference.

I am Italian and come from a big family of great Italian-American cooks. I never heard of making homemade sauce using stewed tomatoes, so I tried this recipe out of curiosity....not a favorite, sorry.  I suggest using the crushed tomatoes, tomato puree (in place of stewed tomatoes), a small tomato paste and then fill paste can with warm water, and add that as well.  My family does put 2 TBSP  sugar in our sauce recipe, but stewed tomatoes already have sugar added, so maybe this is why others have said this is too sweet?  And always start your sauce by sauteing the fresh garlic with about 1/4 c. olive oil, that gives the sauce a wonderful taste!

This is an excellent basic recipe. You can either do a lot with it by adding more spices, or you have make "as is" and it is wonderful. I left out the sugar, and added a pinch of baking soda instead, as suggested by another reviewer. What a great tip! If you don't like a real sweet sauce, but want to tame the bitterness, baking soda does the trick. I went with one onion and one green pepper, a bit heavier on the oregano, basil and garlic to suit my family's taste. I also used ground turkey in place of ground beef and it turned out great. Couldn't tell it was ground turkey, the family didn't know. Much healthier, and easier on the budget. I often make this substitution in meat sauces when I want to go lighter.
Overall, this is an easy, versatile recipe.

Very good. However, IT NEEDS SALT. The perfect ratio I've found for our tastes is - 1 tablespoon of sugar = 2 teaspoons of salt. Try it!

I used one onion and one bell pepper. I considered chopping them by hand, but why bother when I've got a food processor? I blitzed it in a few seconds, removed the veges and then blitzed the tomatoes. Yum. UPDATE: I consistently use this recipe every single time when I make spaghetti, it's that good. Always with my sugar/salt ratio also.

This was fabulous all alone but I added some red pepper flakes that came from a pizza delivery and that added a teeny spark to this wonderful recipe. I will keep this and always use it until it is committed to memory!

This is a very good recipe. I am diabetic, therefore sugar is not an option for me. I peeled and shredded 2 med size carrots instead of the sugar. It gives it great flavor and natural sugars. I will use this recipe again. My family enjoyed it very much.

Great and basic sauce and as the submitter advises you MUST add the full amount of sugar.  The secret of any good lasagne, & what makes it different than other Italian sauces, is the sugar.  I use dark brown sugar, light brown sugar, white sugar, sometimes even Karo syrup to sweeten my sauces to different degrees and for different recipes.  That's what separates really "cooking" from just opening up a jar of Ragu!

Wonderful as written.  Only minor changes I made (our tastes) was brown vs white sugar and 1tbs vinegar to meld flovours.  I used crock pot on low for 3 hours.  Company raved.

I made this for dinner and was very disappointed.  Following the directions as written yielded a very bland sauce with little body.  I added more seasoning after the initial tasting, and it really did little to help the taste.  It was requested by my family to not make this recipe again.

Another good hint if you don't want to use sugar is to add a carrott, either small baby ones or a large one split up the middle.  The carrot adds natural sweetness to the sauce and was also from an old Italian lady who my mom got the secret from.  The one who gets the carrott in their sauce is said to be going to have good luck!!!  Enjoy.

Instead of sugar, I added a little milk...a tbs. or a little more.  It took away the acid taste so I could omit the sugar.

Great basic recipe that you can tweak to your heart's content!.  I used 4 14.6 oz cans of varying tomatoes... 1 Stewed Tom, 1 petitie diced garlic & olive oil, 1 diced italian style and 1 fire roasted diced.  I am using spicy Turkey Italian sausage, removed from the casing.  1 tsp sugar as this was already a bit sweet, recipe amts of garlic, basil and oregano and 2 sm bay leaves, only 1.5 peppers (I actually buy these on sale, wash, dice and keep a huge bag in the freezer--red, yellow and green or poblano-so just grabbed 2 handfuls-ish).  It sure smells like HEAVEN....still simmering but we keep sampling.  Great proportions, just watch the sweetness and adjust to your taste!!

It's basic and delicious.  The Italian recipe I got years ago had a secret ingredient in it, which, instead of sugar, called for sweet pickle relish in about the same quantity, a tablespoon or 2, depending on how a big a batch of sauce and how sweet/sour the tomatoes are.  It makes the sauce!

I've been sneaking sugar into my spaghetti sauce for a long time. I think it helps offset the acid in the tomatoes, I learned not to tell people because I usually get eeeooo "sugar in spaghetti", my family doesn't know and they haven't complained about my sauce. It is good to get some validation from an actual Italian cook.

Wow!  I may never buy jarred sauce again!  I believe in giving a review on recipes as they are writtten before making any changes - however I used only one pepper, as they are not my favorite but hubby likes them in his sauce.  This was not just quick and easy but tasted great, too!  Thanks for sharing!

I have been making my sauce this way for 25 years. The only change is to cook the green peppers until they are soft, put them in your blender then into the sauce. You need the green peppers for flavor. When the sauce is done let it sit for 24 hours to let the flavors blend. Enjoy!

I make meatless red sauce in large quantity to freeze in 3-cup portions.  This was the first time I used this recipe and am happy with the result.  I always read the reviews before trying a recipe.  I followed the most popular tips.  One great tip I read was to add baking soda to the sauce to reduce acidity.  Another was, for meatless sauce, add a little olive oil.  I did both, and it really made a difference.  Thanks folks!

My husband loved this sauce. My only change was to cook and puree two medium size carrots and add them to the sauce instead of the sugar.  This curbs some of the acidity and gives the kids an extra serving of veggies without them even knowing it.  Thanks Kay for this delicious recipe.

I left out the meat, garlic, 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, all of the tomatoes, basil, oregano, BUT I added 3 scrambled eggs and some mushrooms and cheddar cheese, and it was the yummiest omlet I ever had!!  Great recipe!!"

It seems to me, that most everyone thinks that sugar is some kind of secret ingredient, it's really  not. If you use 1 to 2 T. of concord grape jelly instead of sugar, you'll not only cut the acid, but you'll be adding another layer of flavor. Trust me. I actually talked a waitress at the Old Spag. Factory in Seattle into telling their secret.

A good spaghetti sauce. I followed the recipe with one exception - I used a 15 oz. can of Italian tomatoes because it's what I had.  If I make this again, I think the recipe could stand for one 28 oz. can to be Italian blend tomatoes, just for added flavor.

My Italian family (mom-in-law and siblings) use carrots in place of the sugar.   The sugar is used to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  Carrots do the same thing and are a bit healthier.  A nandful of baby carrots does the trick.

I was nervous to try to make homemade sauce for the first time, but I will never make anything else except for this!  This recipe made enough for 3 meals for my family of 4.  I always have us eat one batch that night and then I portion the other two in individual foodsaver bags and freeze them (you can boil those bags).  I just use one large onion and one pepper, and that is all I can seem to get passed my children.  I've only used this as spaghetti sauce, but I'm sure it would be great in lasagna too.  Trust me, you really should try this!

This is a great basic recipe, and the only thing I would say is that you don't have to blend the tomatoes.  My family likes it a little chunky!  Also, I add a little red wine to the sauce as it's simmering

This by far the best basic sauce ever! It is identical to my mother in laws with one omission, she adds one tbs. of cider vinegar at the start of simmer. This makes the flavor of the spices just explode! Thank you for reminding me of this great sauce.

I am also Italian. My aunt would grate up a carrot for sweetness instead of adding sugar. I am surprised this recipe is Italian and does not call for garlic????  I remember watching my mother make spaghetti sauce probably once a week. My job was to add a little water and stir while it brewed all afternoon.   My father would say at the dinner table, "you're eating your native dish tonight!"

My home made sauce is very similar.  The difference is that I roast pork neck bones & add it to the simmering sauce.  It adds even more flavor
and always brown the meat & saute the veggies 
before adding to the sauce.

Pretty good basic recipe. My family's sauce starts with olive oil, minced onion, cook for a couple of minutes, add minced garlic and tomato Paste, stir constantly to carmelize the paste, add more oil if dry, no sugar is needed, and I only add bell peppers when I'm making chicken cacciatore.

This is a wonderful base recipe and one I have been making for years. I would definitely use diced tomatoes instead of stewed and skip the blender if you like it chunky, which we do. You can use ground beef, ground turkey, Italian sausage or a combination (or no meat at all). I cut the onion and pepper in half. Also 2 T sugar is way too much, unless you like it sweet. 1 T is plenty to cut the acidity. I love using fresh herbs instead of dried whenever possible and lots more of them. Add a bay leaf or two as well as some mushrooms and you have the perfect sauce. Sorry, I usually don't change recipes so much and then rate them but this one is just so versatile. Never thought of using a slow cooker before but I bet that would be wonderful!

I make this every few months and it is so worth it!  You can't find a jarred sauce at the store that can beat this.  Depending on my mood, I will add mushrooms, more garlic, port wine, etc...  Sometimes I leave out the meat, whatever our tastes are at the time.  It's a very versatile recipe and freezes very well.

this sauce was okay in my opinion. i think if i make it again i will add some red wine and worchestershire sauce for some extra flavor. i used it to top spaghetti and i felt that it lacked flavor. i bet it would be better in lasagna where there are other flavors (ricotta, mozzarella) for it to combine with. thank you for sharing.

Great, easy recipe. Makes you wonder why anyone would spend all that money on jarred sauce in the supermarket. Keep tasting it for salt---it may need a little more. One note:  as an experienced cook, I always add a bit of sugar to anything I cook with tomatoes--fresh or canned.

I must say this was one of the best recipe's for spaghetti sauce I have tried! I only used 1 onion. I also simmered for 20 min, I used 5-8 fresh basil leaves (minced) in place of the dried, and I used ground lean turkey. Thanks for this delicious sauce!!!

Absolutely the BEST SAUCE I've ever had!  I added a "pinch" of baking soda along with the sugar and added a dash of red pepper flakes and some merlot.  I didn't use the meat, just cooked the vegetables in a little olive oil before adding the tomatoes.  I simmered it for about 4 hours.  Incredible!  Thank you for the recipe.

Decent enough meat sauce.  I cut the sugar in half and it was just too sweet still.  ill try again with little or no sugar.  I use chuck for my meat sauces.

This is a great, simple meat sauce recipe.  I add fresh mushrooms and use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage.  Since I was never a big fan of sauces heavy on oregano, this one is just perfect. Although it's ready to eat in 40 minutes, it tastes even better after 2 hours.

Delicious!  I did not bother with a blender.  I drained off a little of the liquid from the stewed tomatoes and added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, as well as the crushed tomatoes as directed.
Used only 1 yellow onion and 1 green pepper.  Kept all other ingredients the same.  Excellent and oh-so-easy.

This is the best sauce I've ever made.  My husband always tells me my sauce tastes like  compared to his mothers.  When I made this he said "Wow!  This is just as good if not better than Mom's!"  So, I will use this over and over.  I'm making for the 2nd time right now, didnt have any stewed tomatoes so I'm using two cans of chopped, I blended one and kept the other the way it was out of the can, I think the little pieces of tomato add a dimension to the sauce.  Thanks for this recipe, it's so wonderful!

This was pretty good and my family loved it.  I didn't add green peppers and I only used one onion.  Next time I will use a little more salt and I might try a little red pepper flakes for a kick.  This is a good basic recipe that can be easily tweaked to your families taste.

Loved this and so did my family.  I used one onion and one bell, tomoato paste and italian sausage. Kept the sugar and didn't think it was too sweet.  My son, who does not like jar spaghetti sauce, actually liked this one a lot.  Finally a an easy homeade spaghetti sauce - I will make this often!

 I made this recipe today & we LOVED IT!!  I did make some ajusments due to what I had. I made a large batch.  So I used 1 lb.gr.beef & 1 lb. reg sausage browned in skillet with 1large white onion & 1 large gr.pepper.  While that was browning I put in food processor Diced Fire Roasted Tomatoes(2cans) 2 reg cans diced tomatoes & chopped it down cause my husband doesnt like chunks of tomatoes. Poured all that into a crockpot. Added a large can of tomatoe sauce I did use the basil & oregano as recipe called for & I used 2TBSP Brown Sugar instead of white.  I used some Mrs.Dash in the garlic blend because I had no fresh garlic as recipe called for. I cooked on low setting for 5 hours.  I think maybe it would of been fine at 4hours. Just make sure you use enough tomatoes to cover all of your meat mixture.  Large batch but we will freeze some of it. I usually use jar spaghetti sauce & doctor it all up but when I got this email from Allrecipes I just had to try.  Fantastic!!!  I WILL be making this for years to come now!!  Make sure to read other reviews cause ALOT of people have good ideas.

This is the same recipe I learned as a child from Itailian wives in Newton Falls Ohio in 1948!  I have so had so many compliments on it and it is so simple!  Sometimes I add a little turkey sausage and it too is well received.

Grew up on this recipe for over 50 years.  Whrn I married an Italian his entire family tried to get this from me!  The sugar cuts the acid.  Its great!  As with another reviewer stated the sugar can be adjusted to your tastes.  Great meatless too, freezes well, so double, triple the recipe and freeze remaining for a quick weekday meal

Loved the recipe. We used crumbled sweet italian sausage instead of beef and it was delicious. just add a good amount of salt and pepper to contrast the sweetness from the sausage, peppers and sugar. Also angel hair pasta with it was awesome. Thank you much.

I liked the flavor of this sauce and would probably like it very much in lasagna.  I served it over pasta last night.  The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half and I'm glad I did.  You just want to cut the acidity of the tomatoes not have a sweet sauce.  I have left overs and I'm thinking about using it in lasagna.  I think I could stretch what I have left.  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect! I've been looking for this recipe forever and am so glad the search is over. Only "tweak" I made was halving the recipe except for the beef and garlic, using stevia in place of the sugar, and then added 1/2 tsp. marjoram. Love, love, LOVE this! Won't be buying canned or jarred sauce anymore.

I've been using this recipe for quite a while -- it's a good base recipe that can be altered as you see fit. Cook all day in a crock pot, use beef broth instead of the liquid in the canned tomatoes, change up the meats (italian sausage, ground beef, ground turkey, ground venison, etc.), add veggies (mushrooms, peppers, etc)... the possibilities are endless.

This was very good! I only had red pepper so I used that and added some chopped carrots too. Per another reviewer, I did not add the sugar but added a bit of baking soda and I added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, which we thought was the perfect amount. I don't see a need for the sugar. Using canned tomatoes from last year's garden, I did add a small can of tomato paste (as they seem to be more "watery" than the canned ones in the store). I used this sauce for Stuffed Shells I on this site...wow, great combination!

Used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, left it chunky, and followed everything else to a "T", and it was awesome. My grandchildren kept saying how good it smelled while it was cooking. They all loved it! I froze the left overs and then used it a week later in a buuternut squash raviolli lasagna, and it was AWESOME! I'm making lots to give as gifts this Christmas. THANKS for the great recipe!

This recipe really could be used for lasagna or spagetti and for me I think more lasagna than spagetti.  The flavor was a bit subtle for me, will try some more intense flavoring next time but overall a good base recipe.

A great sauce!  I only had 2 14oz cans of diced tomatoes, which I pureed, and it was plenty enough for our taste.  Like others, I used only 1 bell pepper, 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 can of tomato paste.  This recipe makes more than you think it will.

We made this for dinner tonight- it was delicious. We made it exactly as the recipe stated except we added one can of tomato paste to the tomato blender mixture. It was fantastic! I recommend doing everything the same but next time I think I will try putting it in the crock pot.

Um, no. Sorry, but I did NOT like this at all. And it's not just me.. the 2 guys I live with who will eat anything didn't really care for it either. I took another reviewer's advice and let it simmer in the slow cooker for about 6 hours. Maybe that was the problem, but I highly doubt it. My boyfriend said it tasted like chili. I'm not so sure about that.. but it definitely didn't taste like any Italian red sauce I've ever had. Not worth the effort of chopping 4 onions! I'll stick to my basic crushed tomatoes/sauteed garlic/ground beef recipe. Maybe simple is best in this application.

Very good! To accomodate what I had on hand, I used one 28 oz can of stewed, 14.5 oz of diced, and 14.5 oz of crushed tomatoes. I only pureed the stewed ones to make the sauce a little chunkier. I also used only 1/2 of one green pepper, as my fiance isn't a *huge* fan of them. I also browned the meat, garlic, and peppers then threw everything in the slow cooker. Cooked it on low for 4 hours and the flavors came together very nicely. Thank you :)

Thank you SHERIMA1! I love this recipe. It's so nice to find a recipe full of fresh veggies. Everyone loved it, even the kids. This will replace the WBLE sauce (from this website), I always use. I did not use the full amount of veggies and I am glad I did not. I used half of what was called for. It would be too much to use the full amount (for us). Thanks again!

This sauce is wonderful!  We found it, and have been making it on a regular basis ever since.  The first time my husband made it, he accidentally switched the amounts of two of the spices, but it's been delicious every time!  Freeze and save for pizzas, marinara, spaghetti, lasagna, everything!

I tried this last night on a whim. I'd previously tried another homemade sauce(not from this site) and it was the worst, so I was skeptical.  However, with this recipe I now have a renewed faith.  This sauce was delicious.  First off, I only used one green pepper and onion and lots or garlic.  Also, because I like a chunky sauce, I didn't blend the stewed and crushed tomatoes.  For those who are worried about a thin sauce, I would suggest using only slightly more than half of the crushed tomatoes.  I did and the consistency was perfect.  I also added extra seasoning like italian seasoning, garlic salt, and red pepper flakes (at the suggestion of other reviewers).  I used two tblspoons of brown sugar (next time I might go with only one, just to see what happens).  All in all a great sauce.  I am soooo looking forward to lunch.  My boyfriend also gave it two thumbs up!

It made the meal! I didn't have stewed tomatoes but i did have two cans of diced tomatoes with garlic onion and basil, I also added a small can of tomato paste(I was worried about the extra liquid from the diced tomatoes). It may have been the seasoning in the diced tomatoes but it turned out great. Careful with the blender though it was filled to the brim! After trial and error, DON'T USE ALL DICED TOMATOES, MADE IT VERY SOUPY, use the stewed for sure!!! This has become the new sauce in the house, so much for store bought sauce. I have made this several times and like I say if you master the base the sky is the limit, add as you will just remember the basics and never forget who you got it from...THANKS FOR AS NEW FAMILY FAVORITE that will forever be attributed to KAY!!!

This was a really good base for a tomato sauce.  I found it a little bland.  My husband says he prefers my own sauce (which isn't saying much), mainly because this one was so runny.  Next time I'll try adding a few cans of tomato paste, a little less sugar, and more spices.

I am a novice cook, so I picked this recipe because of the great reviews, and it seemed like it had pretty basic ingredients.  All I can say is wow! It was absolutely wonderful.  The only things I changed were I used mushrooms instead of green peppers (they give my dad heartburn) and I added about two tablespoons of olive oil even though I used meat.  I also used fresh basil instead of dried. 

I don't know what people were saying about it being too chunky, I thought it stuck to the pasta perfectly and was thick and rich without being overwhelming.

I am going to be making large batches of this to freeze!

The best sauce ever!!!!
This was the first sauce I have ever made from stratch, and both me and my husband loved it! Since I like a little more spice in my food, I added some red pepper flakes to mine, was extremely good!

This was the first sauce I had made from scratch and it was tasty.  I used red and green peppers and added red wine and mushrooms which made for a hearty sauce.  I will use this recipe again, but will add more spices as I do enjoy a zesty flavor.

I loved it! I'm giving a 4 because I followed some other recommendations. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground turkey, 1 onion, no peppers, sauteed the onion and garlic, then added the ground turkey and browned. I did use the recommended stewed and crushed tomatoes and seasoning. I added everything to my slow cooker and cooked on low for 5 hours. Next time, I will add a can of tomato paste, as I didn't think it had enough tomato flavor. I will also try brown sugar instead of white.

This is actually a really good base to go off of! I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes because that's all I had, splenda instead of sugar and after I started making it I discovered I was out of oregano so I used 1 T of italian seasoning and 1 tsp of basil since since the italian seasoning has basil in it. I also added about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and it was really good! I wanted to taste it fairly natural this time and I figured for future efforts (which there will be plenty of those) I'll add things like mushrooms, black olives, spinach, carrots... I love my veggies, lol! This was a nice and thick sauce and full of flavor! So much better than the stuff in a jar and very little effort!

A little bland.  I used 1.5 tbs of sugar and really liked the sweetness, but my husband said he could do without it.  I had to add more basil and oregano, also added some red pepper flakes.  I loath bell peppers so used mushrooms and turkey instead of beef.  Next time I will only use 1/2-1 tbs of sugar and add more garlic.  After the additions, the sauce turned out very amazing.

This has become my "go to" spaghetti sauce recipe. The only thing I do different (but definitely isn't necessary) is double the recipe and use 1# ground beef and 1# ground pork. Perfect sauce recipe and easily adapts to whatever veggies you choose to put in or omit. Thank you for posting!!

nancysj - this sauce actually turns out really well if you read other people's suggestions below. i gave this two stars because i did a lot of modifications - i believe that a recipe can only be rated high based on the ORIGINAL recipe, not on modifications. this might be why it's gotten such a high rating. anyways, i combined a bunch of reviewers' ideas into one. first of all, i used 14 oz cans instead of the 28 oz, and i thought it was plenty saucy. instead of stewed tomatoes, i used a can of pureed tomatoes plus a 6 oz can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. i only used 1 tbsp of sugar which i felt like was plenty, and i only used 1 bell pepper. instead of ground beef i used a pound of chicken sausage (casings removed). it came out pretty flavorful - next time i'm going to add more oregano and some rosemary.

YIKES!  2 whole tablespoons of sugar?  I'm thinking the onions give you sugar - so would the addition of some carrots and grated raw beets.  Then you're adding actual nutrition - a happy trade off for those extra carbs.  No veggies in the bin?  Try adding a single teaspoon of sugar.  Maybe a little milk.  Far as I reckon, Sauce isn't meant to taste like ice cream.  I'd boost the oregano 2 or 3 times, as well as the basil.  Garlic sounds right.  Try using a can of tomato puree instead of the stewed tomatoes, and don't bother blending anything.

This sauce recipe was amazing!  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and now he says we can't eat spaghetti (or pasta for that matter) any other way!  As other users have mentioned, we added tomato paste to thicken the sauce, and we did not blend the tomatoes to keep the sauce chunky.  We added extra garlic, spices, and sprinkled parsley flakes on top close to when the sauce was ready for serving.  Instead of two tablespoons of white sugar, I used a dash of white sugar and a few splashes of red wine to taste, as recommended by other users.  It was delicious!

My family loved this spaghetti sauce!  I will make it again for just the adults in the house and instead of sugar, grate some carrot in the mix when browning the veggies (for sweetness), add a cup of port wine and some red pepper flakes and give it some zing.  My kids don't eat spicy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this exact sauce for years.  It is very good.  This makes exactly 3 loaf dishes of sauce.  I use glass.   Since there are only 2 in our family, I freeze 2 of the loaf dishes and have sauce on hand whenever I need it.

This recipe is almost identical to the spaghetti sauce which I have been making for my family for over 50 years.  And my family thinks that it is the best spaghetti sauce ever.  I think so too, of course.

very good base with minor changes to suit my taste: a little too sweet/would cut down the sugar next time. I added 2 TB olive oil (though I did use the meat) and 1 can of tomato paste to amp up the tomato flavor. I added mushrooms because we like them.

Quite bland.  I did more onion and garlic, added onion powder and black pepper and put in a little extra oregano and basil but still not very much flavor.

Wonderful sauce. This was my first time actually making a sauce.  I only had diced tomatoes and tomato sauce on hand, so that is what I used.  I did not use as much onion and pepper as called for.  Ended up cooking this in the crock pot for 5+ hours since I had to leave.  It was great!  Will fix again.

My daughter made this the other day and it was excellent. I know she used tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes, 1T. sugar instead of 2, and 1 onion and 1 green pepper. Couldn't have been better!

too much tomato, takes too long to cook.  never use lean meat to cook pasta u need 85% or you will get no flavor. I did not care for this.

This was my first attempt at home-made sauce and I will definitely make it again. My husband enjoyed it more than our usual jar sauce. He isn't one to compliment on food items, so this is a victory! :-)  The smell/taste of green peppers makes me want to hurl, so I omitted that. And also used jar chopped garlic.  I felt a little like something was missing. Can't put my finger on it, though. I'll have to tinker some next go 'round.

I just wasn't "wow-ed" by this recipe.  Overall, I thought it was bland and needed a lot of salt to pump up the flavor.  I also wasn't a fan of having to blend the tomatoes before adding them to the meat mixture - I felt it was an extra step that I would have skipped by using something other than the stewed tomatoes.  I might try playing around with some variations, but as is, this recipe didn't cut it for me.

Very good!!!  Esp since it only takes about an hour and a half from start to finish - u can probably get away with telling everyone youve been cooking all day.  I added extra garlic (as I always do) and only used 1.5 tbs of sugar and it was a bit too sweet for my liking, next time Ill cut back to 1 - also I love a meaty sauce but this one actually tastes good w/o it - I mean the meat flavor is nice but I just liked eating the plain sauce, next time I will double all ingredients except the meat as this is prolly a great sauce for lasagna (I made it for stromboli last night and it just wasnt quite right for that) Really good recipe though - thank you!!!

My family loves this spaghetti sauce! I followed other reviewers and always puree in cooked carrots with the tomatoes. I also simmer the sauce with a potatoe cut into quarters and it does wonders in removing the acidity! Very easy to increase recipe size and freeze sauce for quick weekday meals!

This sauce was fantastic.  My family loves it and so do I.  I cooked it in a slow cooker which makes the meat extremely tender.  We freeze individual servings so we can just heat up quickly in the microwave later.

LOVE this! I've made it numerous times, everyone in my family loves it as well. I double the recipe and cook it in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours. I omitted the peppers. For the tomatoes I use canned diced plum tomatoes, canned crushed tomatoes, garlic tomato paste, and a can of tomato sauce.

This was an unusual sauce for pasta.  It would be better used as a sauce over rice and chicken or eggplant.  Instead of sugar use a few carrots to sweeten sauce and another tip put a whole potato in sauce while simmering to take out acid.

This is great!  But instead of cutting up the green pepper, I put a couple big pieces in and remove before serving.  This way you get the flavor but for the pinicky eaters that don't like peppers, they usually love the sauce!

This was a great tasting sauce.  I had a bunch of Roma tomatoes from my garden and I just put them in the food processor and used them instead of the canned tomatoes.  I used the sauce to make lasagna and OMG it was incredible.  I will be making this sauce from now on.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this sauce!  I do make a few changes though.  I brown the ground beef in a separate pan, use a can of italian diced tomatoes and a couple of diced ripe roma tomatoes with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and italian seasoning and saute them in a little bit of olive oil until the raw tomatoes are cooked, then add the meat and tomatoe sauce and simmer (I like chunky sauce, so I don't blend it).  I add the sugar near the end as I'm taste-testing, sometimes I add more, sometimes I add less.  I skip the basil and bell peppers.

I made this for chicken parm. and made without the beef in it.  It was really good as is.  I added some red wine to it and made it even better.  I did not use green peppers I used a red pepper and think that made a big diffence. I will make this sauce again and add itailin sausage to serve over pasta.

I was expecting more from this recipe and was disappointed that I didn't get it :( I ended up having to add a lot of red pepper flakes, more italian seasoning and some red wine to balance the flavors out.

I don't eat beef but my fiance loves spaghetti sauce. So I tried this and he absolutely LOVED it! He said it's better than his mom's (which according to him was the best!!)

Great start for a spaghetti sauce recipe.  I altered the spices and sugar to my liking but I'll be refering to this recipe for future sauce making.

Not bad..... but only use 1 large green pepper,  and be sure to chop it up small.  Otherwise too much like chili.

This homemade spaghetti sauce turned out to be almost perfect! I love the sweetness of this sauce. I will add more seasoning next time, though, since I found the sauce just a tad too bland for my taste. As some of the reviewers suggested, I added a small can of tomato paste next to the canned tomatoes, which helped to thicken the sauce. I made way too much sauce of course (I cook for 2 persons), so I'm going to freeze what was left of it for later use.

Delicious! I used tomatoes with garlic and basil, only one green pepper, and I absent-mindedly forgot to buy garlic with the rest of my ingredients. Even subbing garlic powder for it made this sauce wonderful. I did drain the hamburger before adding it to the tomatoes. Saved us from a little unneeded fat. So, so good.

Excellent sauce!! This is the first time I've made homemade sauce...I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee....other than my husband seasoned the sauce w/salt and pepper right when we were starting to simmer it for the 40 mins.  i actually used my cuisinart mini chopper(instead of a blender) and made the tomatoes smooth.  this was plenty of sauce and would be good for a large group.  The sauce seemed kinda thin and runny after we took it off the stove. but we left it to sit for  a little while we set the table and it thickened up.  Definitely a sauce to make again, and the best part, its not overly sweet and not sour, and not acidic!!

I loved MAKING this recipe but unfortunately, I didn't like the taste so much.

I added:  2 stalks diced celery, 1 finely diced carrot, and cut the sugar in half as recommended.  I found the sauce to be really bland and even though it was chunky (due to the veggies I put in), it was really watery and didn't stick to the pasta.  I later added a 13 oz. of tomato paste, more salt, pepper, garlic powder and some Italian seasoning.

As I said, loved making this recipe but the taste didn't cut it for me.  Really disappointed as I had extremely high hopes for it.

Fantastic sauce! I took the advice of some others and only used 1Tbsp of sugar, and added a can of tomato paste. I ommited the green peppers and added some shredded zucchini. I substituted crushed tomatoes for the stewed and skipped the blending. This made for a wonderful chunky sauce. Simmered for about 2 hours. Right before serving I added some sweet italian sausage. It was great, and made enough to freeze half. Thanks Sherri!

"This is awesome!" This is what my hubby said about this sauce. I wholeheartedly agree. Very very easy, very simple, but amazingly delicious! I simmered mine for 3 1/2 hours for full flavor. I had to make some slight changes. 1. I used a small can of diced tomatoes wth onion and green peppers and a small can of tomato paste in place of stewed tomatoes. 2. I skipped the blender step as I just didn't feel like dirtying it 3. only used 1 onion and added a half tsp of onion powder to compensate. I didn't have green pepper but the can of diced tomatoes I used had them in it. Overall the sauce was on the thin side but the taste was soooo good. Both hubby and I had seconds this was so tasty! This would be a great recipe for the slow cooker. Thanks Sheri for sharing this AWESOME sauce. Update: I took this out of the freezer for a quick weeknight meal after work and a friend of hubby's stayed for dinner, he said, I love spaghetti, "this is BETTER than my mom's"...how's that for a compliment?!!! UPDATE: Cut in half, left beef full amount, used some fajita blend veggies (green and red peppers and onions) tomato puree and a can of stewed, all else as is. Simmered 1.5 hrs. for a great sauce!

I love this sauce!  I have used it for spaghetti four times & I love it.  My husband loves it, my 4 year old & 1 1/2 year old daughters love it also.  It is better than store bought by far for me.  It is simple.  I do everything the same except I put it in a slow cooker & let it sit for 4 hours.  I'll say it once more "I love it"!  Thank you for the GREAT recipe.  I love this site.

Excellent.  Worth the extra time versus the bottled stuff.  Leftovers were gone in no time!  It was slightly sweet (I added one 1 tbls. white and 1 tbls. brown sugar), but I backed off a little on the salt and onions (dietary restrictions) which might have made the sweetness more prominent. As with all good sauces, tasting as you go helps to match it to your liking.  A keeper!

This sauce was OK with a few changes. First I only used one onion and one bell pepper. I also increased the garlic to 6 cloves because my garlic was small. I didn't use the ground beef, either. I used brown sugar instead of white and added just a pinch of cinnamon. I found that even with half of the onion and bell pepper the sauce was still too chunky for my tastes so I pureed about 2/3 of it in the blender before simmering. I usually like chunky sauces but this was a bit much for me. Maybe if I had used ground beef it wouldn't have "seemed" as chunky.

This sauce was tasty, but not the taste I was hoping for. My husband and I found it very similar to that of Fazoli's (but with richer flavor because the ingredients were fresh). It was very traditional, but did not stand out like we had hoped. I served it over spaghetti, and it was just okay. I think we missed the contemporary burst of flavor that is prominent in pasta sauces today. I do, however, think that it would be excellent in a lasagne dish as the title indicates, so maybe we'll try it that way next time. We didn't really enjoy this sauce with our spaghetti, but those who like a more traditional sauce would probably love this, so feel free to give it a try. Thanks for sharing the recipe anyway...it's always appreciated! Thank you. :)

I was looking for a chunkier sauce than the one I usually make, and this turned out great!  I added the tomato paste, and used italian sausage as well as ground beef, and it was a hit!  I will probably make this again.

Too sweet, and the bell peppers overpowered the sauce. Consistency and color were good. There might be hope with a few slight changes.

Very good!  I cut the bell peppers, onion and garlic down a bit and added mushrooms and black and green olives and it was EXCELLENT, my whole family loved it! Oh and it makes a LOT, I froze a huge bowl of it and have another medium size bowl in the fridge AFTER 4 people ate it last night (but that is a good thing because it means we get more delicious meals in the future with no cooking, just heat and serve!)

This sauce is a good reason to make your own.  I never bothered to make my own spaghetti sauce before, but now I know what I've been missing.  It was so easy, and the best thing about it is you don't have to simmer it for hours like other recipes at this site.  It was excellent!

I’m very surprised at the great ratings of this recipe. I found it to be way too sweet. I ended up adding some beef broth to make it slightly more salty. I feel this recipe could have used tomato paste for a better taste and at least half the sugar. I will go back to my other meat sauce on all recipes.

AWESOME! I sautéed finely chopped red pepper and onion in olive oil, added garlic, then tomatoes as directed .  Then 1/2cp.  red wine and only 2 teaspoons of sugar. Had tomato paste left over, so added that also.  Simmered 45min.  Added fresh basil and parsley. K2

Rating  is based on as is...a rarity here!  This is very solid.  I think I'll omit the secret (sugar) next time, or least cut back ..not a fan of sweet sauce.  I will also make it with a meatloaf blend (beef/pork/veal)

Finnaly a sauce I can eat!  I have many food intollerances and this is the first sauce that does not make me sick.  The only adjustment is I did not add in the ground beef.  I used the sauce for lasagna and spaghetti.   The amazing thing is that everyone in the family loved it, even my picky husband!

I was excited to try a meat sauce loaded with vegetables. To make it a full supper, I doubled the ground meat (I used ground chicken). I also used red peppers rather than green, and added red pepper flakes, a pinch of baking soda (per other reviews; it works well), and a bay leaf. The final hearty sauce was enjoyed by the older kids but the little ones wouldn't touch it. So much for sneaking in the veggies...

I made this with no-salt added, diced tomatoes.  My changes: 1 lrg onion, 1 bell pepper and 1 tablespoon sugar.  I didn't use any meat just made the sauce.  This made a very good base sauce on which to build off of.  For a NO salt sauce it is very flavorful.

I loved the recipe. But just like other reviewers, I did a little tweaking. I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 bay leaf, 1/4 of a cup of red cooking wine, 1/3 of a cup of water and simmered for only 30 min. If sauce gets too try add some tomato sauce and a bit more of wine. I also added some freshly grated Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese and mixed all together while mixture was still on pan. Overall it's a great meaty sauce!

Great recipe! My changes included using ground turkey (my friend asked me if I used sausage or ground beef, he couldn't even tell). After adding the meat I let it simmer until most of the liquid evaporated. Then I added a cup of red wine. Wait until it evaporates and then add the tomatoes. I also used red bell peppers (they were on sale). Forgot the sugar. Overall a great meat sauce, and healthier with the ground turkey.

Great basic sauce. Instead of sugar, I use carrots to sweeten the sauce and reduce the acid. For sauces that I cook longer, I use a few spare ribs.

My Spaghetti prayers are answered!  From the time my husband and I married 10 years ago, we could never find a spaghetti sauce we both liked.  Thanks to this recipe, that is a thing of the past!  This is absolutely so yummy!  I've made it 4 times now and always bag the extra in freezer bags, thaw it in warm water, and have unbelievably wonderful pasta in about 30 minutes on busy days.  Each batch makes enough for about 4 dinners in our small family of three.  

I follow the recipe with the exception of cutting out a little bit of the onion and pepper.  I also let it simmer on the stove for hours for the best depth of flavor.  Everyone who has had it at our house, LOVES it!  So grateful the spaghetti dilemma in our house is over!!!

This was a great recipe and was a huge hit at dinner. I did make a few changes which I think made this dish even more tasty and even easier. Instead of stewed tomatoes and crushed tomatoes, I substituted that for one 32 ounce bottle of Marinara Sauce. This bottle had basil in it so I cut back slightly on the dried basil from the recipe. I also cut back the sugar to 1 tablespoon and also only used 1 bell pepper and 1 Onion. I adjusted the salt and pepper at the end and it was super! I served it with black linguine but any pasta would work.

Very good! I used Italian-seasoned ground turkey and pureed tomatoes, and skipped the blender. I let it simmer for around an hour. Needed quite a bit of salt, but that depends on how much salt is in your tomatoes. If you make it with turkey, you'll end up with a lot of water that needs to be cooked off/drained before you add the tomatoes, so allow time for that. (This is the nature of ground turkey, in my experience, and nothing to do with this recipe.) I used the full amount of sugar and didn't find it too sweet, or sweet at all - nice and mellow, but not sweet. Thanks!

This was good, but next time I will do as suggested and cut the sugar in half.  It was a little sweet for my taste.  I think I will also add some red pepper flakes to give it just a little more zest.

I used 1 regular size can of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano, 2 regular size cans of tomato sauce and 1 regular size can of tomato paste.  Everyone raved about it! I made it up on a Saturday night, put in the fridge and then put it in the crock pot before going to church.  Excellent!

This recipe is simple and delicious for a good basic pasta sauce.  I have been buying Newman's own for years because my husband thought it tasted just as good as home made.  When I made this sauce last night he said it was better than out of a jar!  Trust me, that is high praise!

The Best !! The taste is just how I remember my Italian grandmother's spaghetti sauce.   Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe -- it is the one and only I will make for years to come.

My only problems with this recipe was that I felt it called for too much bell pepper. I added an extra pound of ground beef because I love meaty sauces and I've often found that most spaghetti sauces don't have as much ground beef as I enjoy. However even with that extra pound of beef, all the bell pepper made for a "crunchy" sauce. Smelled delicious while cooking, but the end results were disappointing.

I love cooking Italian, and when I saw this recipe had to try it.  This may be a new fav!!  I used 1 box of chopped tomatoes and a small tube of tomato paste.  I also decided to use half ground beef and half bulk Italian sausage (would try to find spicy next time but regular was fine) and also added mushrooms, because I like them and also like lots of veggies.  It was awesome!  I put it over spinach fettucini because I like the visual of the red sauce and green noodles....YUMMY!  Thank you for posting!

I am sorry to give this recipe a 3 star review but I was so disappointed with this recipe. My husband enjoyed it but I think he was being kind. The flavor was lacking and the bell pepper was way overpowering not in flavor but in overall texture. I am sorry to say I will not be making this again.

This recipe is almost like the one I have made for years.  The only thing different is that I use 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes and not so much sugar. 1 tsp.  Will try this one and compare.   I also add medium or hot Italian sausage meat with the ground beef to give it some zing and fresh or canned mushrooms.  My family loves it.

I tried this yesterday with a few minor adjustments and thought it was really good. I used all diced tomatoes because thats all I had, and added in 1 6oz can tomato paste to help thicken it. I didn't add the green pepper to it, and added a little bit more sugar than the recipe said. got compliments all around for it!

The sauce is even better if the sugar is left out. Most canned tomato's are sweet enough.

This is a great recipe. It was a bit too sweet for us and my kids don't care for ground beef. I make the sauce with 1TBS of sugar and add meatballs. I never blend the ingredients; just chop them up and add everything to the crockpot. Delicious!

We did not care for this much. I made it as written, but found it to be too thin, didnt coat the noodles very well. Thank you for sharing. We did give it a try, but its very doubtful Ill make it again.

I will have to say, it was very unflavorful. I used it for spaghetti and was not that impressed. Could be improved upon with a few more spices.

I made this for a work event and it was amazing! I used Italian Sausage instead of beef, 1 less onion, and only 3 cloves of garlic, and it was fantastic! The sugar really is the hidden touch. I put this on homemade gnocchi, and it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made lasagna, spaghetti, and ziti using this recipe for the sauce, and they all turned out delicious (not to mention the mouthwatering aroma of the sauce while it is cooking!). I bought Italian stewed tomatoes, Italian crushed tomatoes, and I cut the number of garlic cloves down to 3. Perfecto!

i just made this tonight. I didn't add green peppers, because we don't particularly enjoy them. I added a dash of cayan, and used fresh herbs instead of dried...This sauce was wonderful and easy. And it made me look like a better cook than anyone I know hehe :).

Very good sauce! Keep the 2 Tbls. sugar, I think it needs it to balance out the peppers & tomatoes ;) I left out the garlic, my Hubby is not a fan. Add in 1 bay leaf as it simmers also. This is a very hearty sauce. We love it, including my 5 yr. old.

delish! i made this w/o beef and it was amazing. I'm planning on trying it next with. I recommend making sure the veggies are chopped up pretty fine and that they are cooked enough before adding the tomatoes. I plan on keeping this in the rotation. I froze the remaining sauce and i'm excited to remember it's there to eat it again!!

I made this today with a slight change. I deleted the sugar. This is an excellent spaghetti sauce and will use it again. Plenty of taste. Depending on the size of the garlic cloves, I think it had plenty. No need to do anything to this recipe. Thanks SHERIMA1. My family really enjoyed your sauce.

this was really good.  I used italian style turkey sausage instead of the meat called for (what I had on hand).  Be careful if you don't like tangy sauce or add more sugar.  To my family it was yummo!

It is to thin. Needs tomato paste. Why does everyone feel the need to add sugar to spaghetti. It is not a desert. I have always used crushed fennel seed instead. It tases so much better. This recipe needs more seasoning. I have my own I have been making for 20 years but always like to try others to see if I may like it another way. This recipe is, I am sorry to say, a complete flop. Too many onions to many green peppers. Though that may work well with rice cooked in. Turning it into a tomato and rice soup sounds like just the thing for this particular recipe. I'll have to try that. Thank you

I needed a quick sauce recipe (my grandmother's homemade can take 5-6 hours to make) so I used this one and it was a huge hit!  I followed the recipe almost as stated, just took others' advice and added a small can of tomato paste to the tomatoes, and added red pepper flakes and a dash of cinnamon with the other spices, and omitted the salt (the other spices were great on their own).  I also used minced garlic rather than crushed cloves, but this substitution didn't really do anything to alter the recipe.  This recipe got four stars just because of the alterations I made, otherwise it would have gotten five.  My husband declared that he wants me to use this recipe all the time from now on, which will save me lots of time!  Thanks for a good recipe!

I kept the recipe mostly as stated and it was awesome! I omitted the ground beef (we are vegetarian), used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and finely diced the onions and bell peppers (which I sauteed in 2 tablespoons of olive oil along with the minced garlic). I put everything together in the crockpot, let it sit in my fridge for 36 hours, and then cooked it on high for about 6 hours in the crockpot. We will get four meals out of one batch -- it makes A LOT. (I froze the leftovers in mason jars.) Thanks for sharing the recipe. It's a keeper.

very disappointing. Extremely watery and very little flavour. Even with a can of tomato pasta the sauce was still runny. I added salt and more spices, still remained flavourless

This was really good! I did make the meatless version and I was really pleased with this. It was still chunky and flavorful enough for meat lovers to enjoy. I do think I might try adding a can of tomato paste next time just to thicken a little bit.

I don't know what everybody is complaining about.  This recipe was absolutely perfect.  It's not too sweet, but I didn't add any sugar.  It doesn't need it.  I used one can of tomatoes and i small can of tomato paste.  Not watery at all.  We loved it!

Canned spaghetti sauce never tastes quite right.  This is such an amazing sauce that you can customize to your personal taste.  We like to add mushrooms, yellow pepper and sausage.  I changed nothing in the recipe and felt like an authentic Italian cook!  No more jarred sauce for us.  This is a keeper!

Wonderful, chunky sauce!  I followed the recipe as written (the only exception being I skipped the blender - too lazy - but the tomatoes break down nicely while the sauce simmers) and love it.  I don't find it too sweet at all and there is no bitterness to the sauce.  A wonderful basic sauce that I will make again and again (I will try adding spinach and mushrooms next time, and maybe some roasted garlic instead of just chopped).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good recipe.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It did come out a little more watery than I like.  I will add tomatoe paste and adjust seasoning to make up for it next time.

I've made this sauce 3 times now and I love it! First time subbed a can of tomato paste for stewed tomatoes and red peppers instead of green due to what was on hand - waayy too sweet! Second time vegetarian with the tomato paste and green peppers instead and it was divine! Third time I halved the sugar, and kept it the same as the 2nd - it is PERFECT! A great base recipe with things you normally have in the house. I cannot say enough good things about this sauce, especially since we are on a budget.

I thought this was a good starter recipe.  I made it w/o meat, since we were having meatballs.  I would use about 1TB of sugar next time....I am a 'more sugar is better' person (4 splendas in my coffee) and even for me, this was a little too sweet.  I added salt to cut the sweetness, and that helped.  I also threw in a few red pepper flakes.  Very easy and good!

very good sauce. Nice texture & flavor.  Only addition to sneak some more veggies in was to add 1/2 can pumpkin.  Can't taste it, just adds a bit of thickness.

Very good sauce. One thing though, this sauce is more like stuffed peppers without stuffing them due to the amount of bell pepers in it. I am going to try to serve it with rice the next time. I think it would go great with it.

I make my pasta sauce the same as Kay's but one thing I do different is I use sweet italian sausage, I cut it out of it's casing and mix it with the ground beef. One really good tip to a good sauce is let it cook all day yummy!!!!

This was really nicely flavored.  Used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp fennel seed in addition to the other seasoning.  The sauce was a little think so next time will add some tomato paste to see if that won't thicken it up.  Either that or cook it down a little bit.  But I will make it again.

Awesome sauce! Afterr eading reviews I revised a bit. I used 1-28oz can of tomato puree(increased thickness) and 1-28oz  can of diced tomatos (which I processed in food processor). I browned 2 lbs of gr beef separately to drain off fat! I used 1 green pepper, 2 yellow onions and 8 garlic cloves chopped and sauted till soft in a little bit of olive oil. i then added the cookedbeef and followed the rest of therecipe. I simmered 2 hrs. Very nice blend!

Nice basic sauce, without too many steps and not overwhelming taste-wise. Good to add the little touches that make a dish your own. This took no more than twenty minutes to prepare. Great for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner.

this has a very good taste. i wasn't expecting it to be quite as watery as it turned out. but i guess it makes sense considering how much tomatoes are in it. it is very colorful with the vegetables.

FABULOUS!  Save yourself some cleanup: dispense with blending the tomatoes, just go right ahead and put them in the pot after the meat has browned.  I added a pound of cut-up sausage and an extra can of ground tomatoes, and this was enjoyed by kids and adults alike to great acclaim.  Thanks for the recipe, this is a definite keeper!

Tasted good. I only made 2 servings of this recipe and didn't use the ground beef and I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. After tasting the results, I added some leftover "Simple Arrabbiata Sauce" from the fridge. Used the sauce mixture for my "Ricotta Stuffed Squash."

Excellent homemade spaghetti sauce!  We had lots of fresh tomatoes from our garden to use, so I blanched, peeled, seeded, and diced them for this recipe.  I used only one green pepper; any more would have overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  Since I wasn't using the ground beef, I sauteed the onion, pepper, and garlic in 2 T. olive oil as indicated in the intro.  I used only 1 T. brown sugar, since some reviewers indicated that it was a bit sweet.  I used about 1 t. salt and 1/2 t. pepper and added a bay leaf.  After simmering uncovered about 1 hour, I pureed the sauce with my stick blender and added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste to thicken to the right consistency.  Yummy!

I like this, but the next time I will leave out the green pepper. I love green pepper, but not in my spaghetti sauce. Otherwise, I would have given this a five star rating.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly with the exception of omitting the salt and pepper as I felt it didn't really need it.  It was a big hit.  My husband said it was my best spaghetti sauce yet!  I did brown everything in a large skillet first and drained the excess fat off.   It was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a truly awesome recipe!  My kids beg me to make it all the time, and we have it at least twice a month!  I also use this for making lasagna and its fabulous!  My son has a low-sodium diet, so I have to now purchase low sodium tomatoes, but its still just as good.  GREAT recipe!

This is our go to sauce. I haven't bought a jar of spaghetti sauce in I can't remember when. This is a great recipe as is or even better to make your own variation of whatever you are looking for (i.e. red pepper, Parmesan, veggie, etc.) This is definitely 5 stars! Thanks for sharing!

Very good sauce. I added tomato paste and blended in some mushrooms as well. I think next time I may add more chunky tomatoes for texture. The sauce was full of flavor and my husband loved it.

This recipe is fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly as is but also added a few changes:  added a can of tomato paste, parsley, cinnamon, couple of bay leaves, and a bit of red wine. I added a bit more oregano, basil, and garlic to suit our tastes.  Overall, it is amazing!!!

This was the first time that I have made a homemade spaghetti sauce...so much better than the jar stuff! I followed the recipe, except that I only used 1 onion and 1 green pepper (just sounded like too much onion and pepper for us). I did decide to make my homemade meatballs to go with the sauce. I let the sauce simmer for 2 hours (adding the cooked meatballs the last 30min.) My husband decided to add some grated parmesan cheese to the sauce, which was good. I will be making this as my spaghetti sauce in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum Yum Yum!  I only used one onion, half a large green pepper, and 4 cloves of garlic.  Used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a 14 oz can of Italian diced tomatoes.  Ended up using a Tablespoon of Kosher salt and probably a teaspoon of pepper, and 1 teaspoon of oregano.  Left the basil as directed.  Also added a healthy dash of worcestershire sauce and a finely diced yellow squash.  Simmered for a couple of hours, stirring occasionally.  Was absolutely delicious!

YUUUUMMY!!! Fast and easy pasta sauce!! I don't care for eating garlic but I love the taste so I used the whole clove and let them simmer and took them out when it was finished. I also used only half the sugar that is called for and added some fresh diced zuchinni. I also added a can of small can of tomato paste and about half a can of water. Put mushrooms in and didnt use the peppers. Added more basil and oregano to my taste. It is soooo good!! This sauce is as good if not better than my granny's and hers took hours to prepare and cook.

A good and basic start to a spaghetti sauce. The nice thing about the recipe is you can modify it to your taste with your own ingredients, a little more of this and perhaps a little less of this. I stuck to the ingredient list and it came out good, thank you for letting me try it out>

This was delicious. My bf and I absolutely LOVED it!!!! I have always used Prego or any other bottled suace when making spaghetti or lasagne. I have tried on several occasions to make my own sauce but have never been able to make it taste very good. This was excellent. I trully recomend it to EVERYONE!!!!

Very good!  One of the better sauces I've tried (and I've tried lots!).  Only alterations were I only used one onion and used more veggies - mushrooms, green peppers and celery.  Also wasn't sure what crushed tomatoes were (strained?) so I used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes and one small can of tomato paste instead.

This was an easy sauce to make.  I made with 1/2 the sugar and used tomato paste and I think I would have preferred to use the full amount of sugar, it was a little bland for me.  I will make again, but I'm still searching for my "go to" recipe for spaghetti sauce.

This is my standard spaghetti sauce now. I never buy the bottled stuff anymore. I do use only one each of the green peppers and onions, but that's just personal preference.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe :( but I did use the most helpful tips, such as, brown sugar and olive oil.  The soda really interested me, but I already put a TBLS of brown sugar in, so I'm worried that it would be too sweet.  Oh what the heck, it's still simmering, I'll add some and make a note to myself!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is great I use it for Lasagna~!  The only changes that I make is using more herbs and I just add them by taste and I use tomato sauce with tomato paste instead of crush tomatoes because I live overseas and crushed tomatoes are hard to find.  I use this recipe all the time and it always tastes great!

This recipe was really good. I didn't add the bell peppers (my child doens't like them) instead I added a can of mushrooms. I also didn't have any whole tomatos so I added a can of tomato sauce and a fresh tomato. It was fantastic!

This is the traditional sauce I have been looking for over the years.  This is a great recipe.  I just added a 1/4 pound italian sausage for the hubby and another clove of garlic.  Just awesome.  It has the perfect texture in my opinion.

I made a double batch of this oh so easy recipe this evening. I don't eat meat (the only one in my family) so had my husband do the taste test. He added 2 tbsp of sugar and a little garlic salt and declared it perfect! He is one very picky man so Kay...ya done good! I will never buy jarred spaghetti again! Bless you!

YUM YUM!  I have been looking for a great sauce forever!  This was excellent.  We are vegetarians, so I used the veggie "crumbles" and I added some red wine and a big pinch of red pepper flakes.  I also let it cook for well over an hour.  I will definitely add this to my list of favorites!  Next time I might reduce the sugar by a smidge...it was almost too sweet.  Absolutely a keeper!!

I made the Spaghetti with Marinara sauce from this site and loved it however when I tried it with lasagna it came out a bit too liquidy, but this one worked great! The chunkiness worked really well with lasagna and provided just the right amount of liquid for the pasta to bake. Instead of adding meat I just sauteed all the veggies in about 2T of olive oil and then followed the recipe from there. The spices worked well however I like a bit of spice so I added in some red pepper flakes along with a sprinkle of baking soda as a reviewer suggested to reduce the acidity. This is definitely my lasagna sauce, and perhaps my spaghetti sauce, from now on!

I was disappointed because my husband said it was bland and preferred my other sauce. I don't know what was wrong with it, but maybe next time I'll use more garlic since I barely had any, maybe more basil, and brown sugar instead of white. I liked it ok, but will try it again to see if I can get it to be better.

I have actually been using this recipe for three years and it is the best! I always make a double batch and freeze half. A good recipe to play with, too. For a more healthy variety, try ground turkey or turkey sausage.

Not as good as the spaghetti my mother made growing up... but pretty close.

Awesome sauce and definately worth a try.

In the beginning it will look like too much onion and green pepper--- it's not. It will cook down so you don't notice the chunks.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  Although the taste was certainly good, I thought it needed more spicing up.  We prefer a more spicy spaghetti sauce so will add additional garlic and oregano next time.  I would recommend this when you want one in a hurry, but still want it homemade.

This was the best sauce I ever made. I used two cans of whole plum tomatoes instead and simmered it for two hours. I also added a pound of ground hot italian sausage in addition to the beef. It was very good and will be making this many times in the future. Thanks for your recipe!

kids i hate to say it but this recipe is bland. everything needs to be doubled and i also used a can of tomato sauce. but most of all i will cook the onions and peppers before i put in the beef, they did not cook clear and soft in the time the beef cooked. im going to try this again but with major changes

This recipe is AMAZING. I like to cook it a little bit longer than 40 min, i find an hour to an hour and half really helps to intensify the flavour. I have also tried this recipie with sausage instead of ground beef, and added red and yellow peppers. Wonderful!

It was a smash hit for my husband and my father in-law. It was a little bit to much sauce for the three of us so I ended up freezing most of it for next time. I bought some fresh parmesan cheese and sprinkled it on the spaghetti. We had garlic bread with the dinner and everything was perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious. Sometimes I add more vegetables to either use them up or just make sure hubby actually eats veg.  :) I also put in shredded carrot if I have it, chopped zucchini if I have it, and a dash of cinnamon.

So simple, yet my hubby raved about it. Didn't use the green peppers as we don't care for them and cut the sugar back to 1 tbl.

Made lasagna and Chicken Fettucine Alfredo at the request of my niece. I used this recipe for the lasagna sauce, made a day in advance and simmered it in the crock pot for about 5-6 hours as another viewer mentioned. Refrigerated it overnight and heated it before using in the lasagna, it was really good and very rich, I made it per the recipe except for adding a half cup of my homemade wine. Everybody really liked the lasagna but especially the sauce. Will be using this sauce recipe from now on.

I made this sauce with canned whole peeled tomatoes. At the time I made it I was in the Philippines so I was limited for ingredients.  I didn’t have access to green peppers so it was left out. Other than that the sauce was simple and delicious. Now i use my version exclusively.

I made it once with Italian sausage instead of ground beef and once with no meat at all.  Both came out good.  I did add Italian Seasoning because I like extra seasoning.  I think it probably had plenty of flavor without adding extra, but I have a weak sense of smell/taste, so extra seasonings were good for me.

I substituted the hamburger for sausage also I added some extra virgin olive oil and crushed red pepper for some spice. I only used one onion and one green pepper then added 3 roma tomatoes to balance the consistency. Next time I think I might add some chopped up pepperoni. The wife and I absolutely loved it and the kids ate it up. Who knew spaghetti sauce from scratch was so simple. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing! I made it exactly as the recipe was written, except a smidge of white cooking wine to the meat and one large onion instead of two, which was perfect for us, and one green bell pepper, as that was all I had. My family thought it was a little sweet, but delicious, so I may cut the sugar in half next time. I liked it that way.

I like my sauce a little more "rustic", so I did not blend the tomatoes before adding them in. Additionally, I diced my onions and peppers a little on the bigger side. Simple, and flavorful. I think next time I'll add a splash of red wine for added flavor.

Love this sauce!  Go to for every occasion.  I changed it up a little by doing 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 ground sausage and adding mushrooms.  Other than that its perfect!

Add finely grated carrot instead of sugar. No oregano use basil, maybe also parsley. Brown meat, included sausage, onion, garlic – even try browning can of tomato paste, add some red wine.
easy and very good

This is a pretty good sauce but still lacks the "wow" factor I'm looking for, I might try it again with some tweaks. One thing I recommend is getting two 14.5oz cans in place of each 28oz can if you do not have a LARGE blender. Mine wasn't big enough to hold all the tomatoes at once so I'm glad I couldn't find 28oz cans of stewed tomatoes as Kroger's and got the 14.5oz instead.

Consider making this without meat. That said, it was not sweet nor anything special. Don't need a recipe for onions and basil and tomatoes.

My family and I LOVE this recipe.  I did use some suggestions from other reviews such as using the grape jelly for sweetness, added red pepper flakes for some heat and a little bit of red wine just for fun!  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

The only changes I made were in regards to the tomatoes -  I used one can of diced, stewed, and sauce.   I let the sauce simmer for 2 hours before serving with noodles.  It was great.  Thanks for a simple, and very tasty recipe!

I made this recipe using ground turkey rather than ground beef, and unfortunately I do not own a blender so I was unable to blend the stewed and crushed tomatoes.  I also cooked everything together, after browning the meet with the onions and peppers, in a slow cooker on High for about 2.5 hours.  I think if I make this again I will use different tomatoes, since I wasn't able to blend them together and I'm not sure how that would have affected the taste.  This recipe was just so-so - I think I will give it at least one more shot to see if getting different tomatoes is an improvement!

This was good but changed it up a bit.  Added Italian sweet sausage,  and hamburger.  Added salt and pepper in the beginning to add to the flavor.  Husband always makes the sauce, this time I did, and he loved it.

I've been making this sauce for years and have made a few changes during that time.  I used to use sugar in my sauce but now I used a red wine.  The hamburger is now Italian sausage with the casings removed.  It makes for a richer sauce and if you like spicy you can add red pepper flakes and/or spicy Italian sausage.

I served this the same day I prepared it and didn't think it was very good. The bell pepper taste was too strong and you couldn't taste the other ingredients, however the next day this was perfect! The flavors came together and my husband raved about it. Definitely a keeper with the note that you need to prep it a day in advance

Made this tonight and even the "sauce from a jar" kids liked it. Had great flavor and the texture was perfect. Only change I did was one less onion because family isn't onion friendly and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and a small can of tomato paste to cut the acidity. For some reason the spaghetti with this sauce didn't make me feel as full as the jar sauce.Will definitely make this again and maybe add some mushrooms. Goes on the kids will eat list!

Very nice, easy to make sauce. The only change we made was not adding green pepper, as a personal choice. Otherwise, I am very pleased and happy to have found a good recipe for making my own home made sauce.

No hamburger, add Asiago and Parmeasan cheese 1/2 cup each to sauce cook and stir till melted. Zesty stick to the pasta sauce then, no grease from burger. I then make sweet Italian Sausage/grass fed beef meatballs which are added to sauce after baking and draining/squeezing with paper towels and allowed to simmer while pasta is prepared. This way everyone picks the amount of meat in each bite and grease doesn't separate pasta from sauce from meat as burger in the sauce is want to do. Meatballs I make are a secret, shhhhh ??

This is a great sauce. My husband and I both love it and it is easy, big plus. I always follow the recipe exactly except for a few times I only used one green pepper and it did not effect the recipe at all, it was still very good. Make it, you will not regret it. Thanks for a great recipe!

It was fair only IMHO, watery and sweet, much like what my Mom made for years.  I have tweaked it a bit and now have taught my kids my version and we get raves.  To the basic recipe I add third cup of good red wine.  Use one red pepper or less as esp. the green ones take over the taste.  One tsp sugar to start [add to taste later] is plenty and add a small envelope or 2 depending on batch size, of oxo, bovril, or other bouillion paste or granules to taste. It enriches the meatiness of the sauce.  We like a thicker sauce so use paste or a jarred sauce as part of the tomato products. We like pepper flakes and or a pinch of cayenne if the wee ones aren't eating it.  My Grandson is esp sensitive so I omit them for his sake. Fresh basil leaves torn over and a good parm. to top the plate. So try my version ...would submit my recipe but I am old and not computer savvy, don't know how! lol.

This recipe is no secret for sure.  I put ground sweet Italian sausage in it instead of hamburger.  Since the Italian sausage is sweet, you don't need the sugar. It has always been a big hit with my family and friends.

Sauce looks very similar to what I've been making for many, many years, but I don't use that much sugar. I take a large pinch, maybe 1/4 teaspoon, and find that is enough, for me and my families taste, to take the acidic taste of the tomatoes away yet still give a rich tomato flavor. For this Sicilian old timer it's NOT sauce, it's GRAVY!  :-)

you know this is a very good recipe it tastes good , its easy to make and it is inexpensive ( three top things in my book when trying out recipes ) ... what isn't good is how people change the recipe or review it like they are a professional food snob.. really ... I don't care that you wouldn't add oregano because you feel that its bitter  or that adding sugar to Italian sauces is not "new" news .. 
Maybe this is the norm here but you don't have my vote that this is a good thing

I loved reading the reviews, it gave me some ideas!  I too make my sauce a little different, but this is a nice sauce as well. I never count the amount of garlic I use, and 5 cloves scared me a little, but it was actually very nice.  I like using crushed, or stewed tomatoes, but I want my sauce to stick to the noodles a little more, so I use one or the other, plus tomato puree, and tomato paste.  I don't use sugar, but if needed, I use agave.  I only use it if the tomatoes are more acidic.  I can my own stewed tomatoes, and sometimes they require a little sweetness.  I also don't use peppers (personal choice), and I add a little fennel seed.  The fennel adds an unusual flavor, I'm sure it is like adding cinnamon.  I really like it, but it's personal preference.  I am excited to try the grape jelly suggestion.  I use it in a meatball appetizer recipe, and I love it in there.  I never thought to use it in spaghetti.  I can blackberry jelly, so I can use agave.  I may try to use a little of that.

We have made this same recipe for years with minor variations.  We use dark brown sugar instead of white being the major difference .  It's just what we prefer. Also we do not use the oregano until the very end.  Good recipe.

This is a great sauce! Here's a few ways to give your sauce a sweeter taste with little or no sugar. Purée bell peppers and Videlia or sweet onions before adding. They add flavor and mild sweetness. Then, just before serving, do the taste test. Slowly add sugar, 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Tasting as you go. Bon Appetite!

This is a very good solid sauce. Will make again. Easy to make spice adjustments if necessary. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes, only petite diced so used those and did not blend since we like chunky spaghetti sauce!

Too much sugar/sweet for my family, we did add red pepper flakes to add spice to counter the sugar and twice the meat and it helped. Cooked the onions and garlic together then blended them in. No green peppers.

This was a great basic recipe. It would be great with sausage instead of hamburger and other vegetables as well. It makes homemade so simple and delicious. Good bye to bottled spaghetti sauce.

Very good. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. Tasty but the second time I used only one green pepper ,ground turkey instead of beef, and add a can of tomato paste to the turkey onion and pepper before adding other ingredients. This is a great sauce !

The sauce was watery and lacked flavor.   I ended up adding another pound of ground beef & quite a bit of additional seasoning.   Even after all the "doctoring" it still seemed to be lacking in flavor.  The biggest problem for us was the sauce did not cling to the spaghetti at all.   I saved the sauce and plan on adding some tomato paste to the leftovers in order to give the sauce some substance and depth of flavor.

Excellent sauce!  I made as written except used low fat beef to cut some calories and used white onion instead of yellow and it was great on my spaghetti.  The only change that I will make next time is to add mushrooms.

It turned out so wonderful. I gave it 5 star but I did cut out the green pepper and oregano. Also I used some of the advice from others  and used italian style diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and crushed tomatoes (in equal proportions) instead of the original recipe. I did add about a teaspoon and a half of italian seasoning, about a generous scoop of crushed red pepper (I looove spicy food) and used two large leaves of fresh basil instead of dried basil. I let it simmer for almost three hours and it turned out amazing!! Great go-to recipe for sure!! Thanks for sharing.

The final product of this recipe turned out really well. The taste of the spaghetti was a bit watered down, but was still overall good. The directions and actually making the dish was straight forward and easy to follow. The picture of the dish shown above looks very similar to what our final product looked like. This dish was cooked in a high school cooking/nutrition class and we were assigned to groups. My cooking group altered the recipe to serve 4 people instead of 8 because that's how many people were in our group. Also, we used less tomatoes than what was recommended in the recipe, which was probably the reason why it tasted watered down. Other than that, nothing else was changed in the recipe. If our group was to make the recipe again, we would most likely use all the tomatoes that the recipe said to use so that the sauce wouldn't taste so watery. The final product looked similar to the pictures shown above, but there appeared to be less sauce so it looked watered down. I would definitely recommend this recipe to another person, especially those who love spaghetti. I'd also say to stick to the recipe as much as possible for the best taste possible.

It was good. I only used one onion, and 1/2 a red pepper. I also added 1/2 tsp parsley, and 1/2 tsp brown gravy mix. Also, 1tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper.

follow the recipe exactly as it is atleast the first time. I always make the mistake of looking at the ingredients and thinking... this is too much or too little. I added an extra can of diced tomatoes and it was watery. had to cooking it on high to dry it up. when I did it was fantastic! Ive been trying to make a sauce like this for as far as I could remember. I'm way better at Alfredo or Rosé sauces so when I finally found this one and made it I cannot explain what I felt. this sauce is a must try and a keeper! My family thanks you a million!!!!

This spaghetti sauce is amazing! I didn't have a green bell pepper so I used a yellow and red instead, the only other thing I did differently was I added a dash of cinnamon. My husband is not a big spaghetti fan unless it's made with sausage and he even loved this sauce! It's a keeper!

This was the blandest pasta sauce I have ever tried. Followed the recipe to the letter. Way too much water based veggies. One onion and one sweet pepper would have been sufficient I don't usually follow any particular recipe when making pasta sauce. I'd just thought I would try this but won't again.

I added 1 green and 1 red pepper because that's what I had on hand  and 2 small cans of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. I also added 2 tsp of parsley and skipped the salt & pepper. The sugar is needed to counter the acid of the tomatoes. I think the longer you simmer the sauce the better it tastes. So good the next day! Definitely a keeper!

I added pork meatballs, and some Italian sausage mild and hot.. 3 mild and 2 hot.  I also added some Italian seasonings to mine.. It was very good both ways. But my house full of boys wanted more meat!!  I didn't add the sugar though, they aren't too keen on sweet sauces, but it was still a very good recipe to start with and make my own.

This sauce had good flavor, but came out a little watery.  I think I would add a small can of tomato paste to try to thicken it up a little.  We also added some additional herbs (marojam, thyme, rosemary).

This is the greatest spaghetti sauce! Is the best out of so many i have tried that didn't taste too much like jar sauce. I follow the recipe exactly though I do cut back on the onion for our preference. I have used this with the ground beef and also ground turkey and is great both ways. It is my favorite sauce and I will continue to make it. I will not buy jar sauce again. With the different types of tomatoes used, the texture and consistency is perfect. Spice is just right. I love to find these great kind of keepers!

Pretty good.  I used 1 onion, not 2- just seemed like too much.  I had to add some extra spices at toward the end of the cooking time as it seemed a bit bland.  Will likely make again- maybe use a jar od sauce in place of the canned tomatoes as others suggested.

It never made sense to me when people would ask why anyone would buy sauce when it's so easy to just make a better sauce yourself.  Now I understand.  Just make it as written and enjoy.  If you don't like bell pepper (like me), at least use 1.  The sauce needs that flavor layer.  Other than that, don't mess with it.  I made the mistake of following advice of adding tomato paste...no bueno.  NOW FOR THE MEAT LOVERS: Buy a pound of ground meat and a pound of Italian sausage.  Use 3/4 of each for a total of 1 1/2 pounds of meat in the sauce.  Here's the bonus: mix the remaining 1/4 pound of each together with a good pinch of red pepper flakes.  Make a couple of patties, or meatballs, or whatever form you like, and sprinkle on a little season salt.  Cook in a hot skillet with a bit of olive oil. I like it with a little char on it for a grill-like flavor.  Serve it on top of the dish for a bonus kick to a wonderful pasta.  Your resident meat lovers will love you for it!

I don't usually review recipes, but after making this, I just had to.  This is the best sauce I've ever eaten.  So very much better than jar sauce any day of the week.  I made it almost just like the recipe says except used 1 onion and 1 green pepper and had to use diced tomatoes instead of stewed because that's the only kind I had.  I'm going to make it just like she says next time.  It is TERRIFIC!!!!!

Great recipe.  I am a vegetarian and I added "beyond meat beef crumbles."  I also use this sauce when I make lasagne.

I may never buy spaghetti sauce again. It was easy and tasted awesome.  I used the suggestion to slow cook it in the crock pot and it was wonderful. I did not blend it either as I like it "chunky" .. perfect!!

YUMMY! I make this all the time. Being from Texas we are meat eaters so I add 2lbs lean ground beef. So simple and my kids adore helping make it and love eating it just as much as I do!

This sauce is fantastic! I now use it every time I make spaghetti or lasagna. The ONLY thing I do extra is brown some sweet Italian sausage to add to it. Perfect!

Made this w/out the meat, but otherwise followed recipe to a T and was so dissapointed! This just wasn't very good and it was so watery. I just read the other bad reviews and see that I'm not the only one that had this problem. The flavor was just okay but nothing special AT ALL. I made the meatball nirvana recipe from this site and was so excited for this meal, and didn't care for those either! :-(

Great recipe!  I love the simple, sweet tast of this sauce and it is VERY easy.  I cut down the garlic a bit, though.  Also, this is great served over spaghetti squash.

For a 'low calorie' spagetti sauce - this was great! Only change was to use cane sugar instead of white.

Cooked in the crock pot for several hours and it came out great - very thick.  Only used one green pepper.  It is a little sweeter than we normally have but enjoyed it very much.

Excellent sauce!  Kids liked it too.  I browned ground beef and onion and then added all the ingredients (minus the green pepper - DH doesn't like them) to the slow cooker and cooked for about four hours on low. I also doubled everything and froze half for another day.  Thanks for a super recipe.  I will not use jarred sauce again! UPDATE - I have now used this sauce to make lasagna too and it is equally delicious!  Some of the frozen sauce has gone back to college with my son.  He loves it too.  Sauce seems to be a little watery when reheated so I just leave the top off for a few minutes and it is fine.

This is the best sauce I have ever tasted!  If the sauce is a bit bitter just add a bit more sugar.  I used a can on tomato sauce instead of 2 cans of paste.  Still came out really thick.  I added some zucchini in for the last hour.  Yummy!

Great! I found this looking for a sauce using stewed tomatoes, which I had on hand. Here are my perfections - added a small can of tomato paste (definitely needed for rich flavor), a dash of cinnamon (for bolognese authenticity), about a cup of sliced mushrooms, and a dash of red pepper flakes. I have fresh basil in my garden, so I used this instead of dried. Important note: Let it simmer for at least an hour to combine and bring out all of the flavor.

This is one of those great and easy sauces that you can add what you want, use less of something else or substitute with other things like spinach or mushrooms.  Just a note, my father used to make a spaghetti sauce very similar to this and instead of the Sugar, he cut up a whole carrot into big chunks and threw everything in his crockpot and let it go all day on low.  Just before serving, remove the carrot, or dice it if you want to keep it in.  Kay, you're a gem for sharing and I was reading other reviews here and I'm glad to see that others are making it their own and using common sense to adjust to their tastes.  For those who think it's too sweet, remember the recipe is calling for FOUR peppers, which also contain their own natural sugars.

i thoroughly love cooking sauces and this one is by far the best!! i did follow some suggestions from previous reviewers and added tomato paste as i did find the sauce a tad runny once finished...instead of green peppers, i used a red and yellow pepper, which i found to be more presentable in the end...this recipe is a definite keeper and i will no longer purchase bottled sauces!!

Great sauce!  One tip I learned from my Mother, who is an AWESOME cook....anytime you are cooking for someone who doesn't 'care for' vegetables in their sauces, simply puree them and mix into the sauce or casserole...they're none the wiser but still get the nutrition from those 'invisible' vegetables.  My mother did this all the time with onions and peppers, as my brother 'hated' them...but always cleaned his plate, none the wiser!

Very good meat sauce recipe. Followed ingredients list closely with the following changes. As others had suggested I held back on the amount of sugar till the rest of the recipe was together and then found 1 Tbs was the right amount for me. Instead of Basil & Oregano I used 2 Tbs of Italian Seasoning. This recipe makes quite a bit and, have 3+ quarts in the freezer. Next time (yes there will be a next time) I will tweekk it a bit more, maybe roasted garlic.

I thought this was way too sweet and very bland.... even after doctoring it up it still was super sweet.  I didn't want to dump a ton of salt in to get rid of the sugary taste.  Very disappointed after reading all the raving reviews.  I guess the positive reviews are from people who like the grocery store sugary sauce.

I used red, yellow & orange bell peppers in stead of green. (Green doesn't agree with me).  It was a little too sweet for me.  I will use less sugar next time, plus more seasoning, salt & pepper.  Good and very easy.

This is an excellent recipe. I suggest you make this recipe 'as specified' in the recipe and then tweak it to your personal taste. I made a batch and really like the flavors. Second batch was modified a bit by removing the green bell peppers, adding more garlic, a splash of wine and I let it simmer for 2 hours. Wonderful!

This was a good standard sauce.  Little to sweet for my taste.  I added 2stalks of chopped celery, 1 fine grated large carrot, and only 1 tlb brown sugar.

Yummy!  Next time I will mix in blender in two batches - too much liquid for my blender - and I put one green pepper instead of two.  Very Good.

It wasn't until i made this sauce that i realized how much i overcomplicated lasagna sauce. I tried this exactly as instructed and it worked out stupendously well for such a simple recipe. The sugar brings out the taste of the tomato wonderfully.

Very quick and tasty.  Nice for a night when time is short.  The sugar makes a big difference (made half the sauce with sugar and half without) mellows the acidity of the tomatoes.

Great sauce!  Depending on how much your family likes the taste of green bell pepper, you may want to reduce this to one pepper.  You really taste it with two.  I added even a little more sugar than the recipe called for.

This is a good recipe that whole family liked. I did leave out the green pepper but that was the only change I made to it. I only gave it four stars because it seemed to be missing something but not quite sure what. I will have to change it up a bit more next time.

We loved this recipe.  I only used one onion, omitted the bellpepper, and added 1/4 C Merlot and used mild italia sausage instead of ground beef.  The only complaint was it was a little too thin.  Will thicken it up next time.  But I have found my new pasta sauce.

This is the best spaghetti sauce ever!!!  The only changes I made was to omit the peppers, add one can tomato paste and I used ground turkey (seasoned with a little worcestershire sauce) instead of beef.  Delicious!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I have never made homemade sauce.... and let me tell you this one was so easy and really really yummy!  I did cut it down to one onion and one bell pepper....and I added one tiny can of tomato paste a little bit of water... I cooked it slowly in the crock pot.  It turned out wonderful!!!!! I'm making it for a staff meeting in a week or so and going to double up the recipe.   We'll see what everyone says.... :)  Thank you for sharing this!

I love this recipe!!  I never made spaghetti sauce before and it turned out wonderfully.  No tomato paste is needed because the meat thickens the sauce the longer you let it simmer.  Thank you bizzy momma for posting this one :)

I made this recipe for a senior citizen dinner.  Thought I was only having about 30-40 ended up with 50 attending, so I had to keep adding water.  It didn't take away from the taste.  I did add 6 small cans of tomato paste and extra ingredients even though I had figured the recipe for 40.  I also simmered it on low all day.  Got rave reviews, the only complaint was that there wasn't more and that it was a little too thin for some.  Not the recipes fault.

WOWZERS!  Yum.  I did not have stewed tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes with green chilies. I used ground turkey omitted the green peppers and used 12 leaves of fresh basil and also went with the 1 TBSP brown sugar.  This was delish!  Love it!

**I made this in the crockpot and simmered it for 6 hours on high and added turkey meatballs instead of ground beef to this to make meatball sandwiches.  WOW, amazing!

Good and simple recipe. I made this dish for my husband and kids and they enjoyed it. I omitted the green pepper because I didn't have any and added some fresh basil. Served over whole wheat spaghetti.

Wow, I didn't think I would like this as much as I did because it sounded just like a basic meat sauce, but I really enjoyed it! I used just a 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes because I like a chunkier sauce and I used just one bell pepper. Will definitely make this again, thanks for a great easy recipe!

I used Italian sausage instead of beef, and ended up grinding the sausage in the blender with the tomatoes because it wasn't breaking into small enough pieces when cooking.  I also like to sneak in a zuchinni blended for extra nutrition.  Turned out very good, and even made enough to freeze some for later.

This should be called a meat sauce, tasted good but not much sauce to cling to the spaghetti, too watery/thin for me.

This recipe was a great base, but I felt it needed a bit more flavour so I added red wine, and let it simmer down a bit. It was wonderful.

Excellent, I loved it!  I waited until the end to see if it needed sugar, it didn't.  Great sauce!  Edited to add...This is still my fav sauce recipe.  I often add zucchini and/or spinach to the sauce and puree with an immersion blender before adding the meat.  Easy sauce!

Bland and dull. I followed recipe and added sliced mushrooms. I will try it again tomorrow; maybe it will be better after it sits. My husband and I both thought it was tasteless. *Update - wasn't good the next day either. Won't make again.

I didn't change anything at all the first time except dropped the bell peppers because I'm not a big bell peppers sort of person.  It had a wonderful aroma and flavor which didn't scream "onion" or other spices when tasted.  It blended nicely on the tongue.  I used it in a lasagna with enough left over for 2-3 people spaghetti in another meal.

Wow!  I've been looking for a good tomato pasta sauce, and this is definitely it!  I don't know how it'll taste on spaghetti, but it was fantastic in baked Ziti.  I try to stick to recipes exactly the first time I try them.  I do eyeball my spices/ingredients, but I'm pretty good at it.  Another reviewer said that the sugar is the key.  I think I under-eyeballed that, because we're not fond of too-sweet sauces.  Next time, I'll measure it out exactly because I could see that it probably won't be *too* sweet with a little more sugar.  Oops.  I lied.  I did make one change, using Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Other than that, I don't plan to change a thing with this sauce.

This sauce is amazing!  I normally hate spaghetti sauce, but my husband loves it.  He begs me to make spaghetti all the time, so I finally gave in and started looking for a recipe I might actually like.  This sauce was perfect.  It was light and fresh, not that super-heavy thick stuff you find in a jar.  I left out the sugar, used one 14 oz can stewed tomatoes, one 14 oz petite diced tomatoes and one 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, didn't blend it and simmered it for about 90 minutes.  My husband can finally get his wish - I'll be making spaghetti on a regular basis!  Thanks Kay!  :)

This was yummy. I didn't have green peppers on hand so I used red instead, and the flavor was great. I also wanted the sauce to be smooth, so after I cooked the ground beef, I put it in my food processor and ground it for a second and then added it to the sauce. Next time I'm going to add some serrano pepper to kick it up a bit!

Good, but not great.  I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes so I wouldn't have to blend everything together, but the sauce was too watery.  I liked the sweetness that the sugar and peppers lent (I used one green and one red bell pepper), but the consistency of the sauce could have been more... well, saucy!  As a result, my lasagna was watery and did not hold together as well as I would have liked.  I probably won't make this again.

This was more like a 3.5. It tasted fine but was too bland for me. I didn't add sugar and it still had a sweetness to it. I added Red Pepper Flakes to help it a bit.

This is just like the sauce I make but I add chili sauce.  It is a sweet sauce but very good.

Awesome and easy homemade sauce!! I made this when I ran out of the jarred stuff; now I will never use the jarred stuff again! I cut the sugar in half and also added a half of a can of tomato paste. Makes a tasty sauce for spaghetti! You can jazz it up with extra seasonings, too, for something more spicy. Overall, wonderful!

This recipe was okay. I personally like onion and bell in my food but this was way too much. I am not sure if i'll do this again.

DELICIOUS!!!  I will use this recipe again!  I didn't have the green bell peppers, and I didn't have the right kind of tomatoes required, but I improvised with what I had, and it turned out lovely!

just OK.  One onion many.  Added shredded carrots and celery as well, and chopped mushrooms.  Doubling the spices and adding a bit of crushed red pepper made it a little too spicy for kids.

I'm a vegetarian who was trying to be nice for my fiance by making him this meat-astic spaghetti sauce! He loved it, but I didn't give it fice stars for a couple reasons.
First, I found the ingredient list lacking a little bit, so I added some sliced mushrooms for flavour.
Also, I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only one Tbsp. of sugar.
Lastly, this may be the vegetarian in me talking, but I thought you were supposed to drain the beef grease -- in the recipe it said to cook the beef with the onions, peppers, etc., so I did. My fiance found the finished product a little on the thin side, so next time, I'll cook the beef separately from the veggies and drain it before combining the two with the tomato sauces.
Altogether, though, very satisfying!

Your recipe is awesome, I also cut the sugar in half, and took it down the border by adding spanish "Sofrito" (Green & sweet pepper, onion, garlic, cilnatro, culantro,and other spices) I must say, the spanish-italian mix worked pretty good with my guests.

Made this for dinner tonight to go with Pasta Casserole, found on this site... I made with Italian Sausage, because that is what I had and actually because of the spices in that I added not only the white but a little brown too.  I only had diced tomatoes, so I put those in and mashed them and then added a small can of tomato paste to the mixture,, it tasted very good, although a little watery.  Now I just have to get the thickness down,, it was VERY GOOD!!!! thanks for sharing.

Husband loves with a few minor changes: add 1 lb of spicy Italian sausage in addition to ground beef(spice and sweet offset each other), use only 1 pepper and 1 onion, and add 1 can of paste. No need to put in blender, but cook all day in slow cooker. Very good, makes a ton of food.

My family LOVED this recipe! They liked it so much that I made it for our work potluck and everyone asked me for the recipe. It is truly wonderful, not too heavy and not too sweet, just right. Plus, I made it with The Best Meatballs recipe. It made a wonderful combination.

I use diced tomatoes and brown sugar. I couldn't believe my family realized how much better this was than canned. This is a much better sauce if you can make the time for the preparation. I'll only use canned spaghetti sauce when I have to. Thanks.

I didn't like this.  It wasn't saucy enough.  It was too chunky.  It didn't have a good enough taste (and I simmered for AT LEAST the amount of time suggested).  I won't be making it again.  I made it for a big group of family, and was embarrassed that it wasn't good.  :(

This sauce was good, but I thought it had too much onion and bell pepper.  The sauce almost needed to be strained.  It still had a good taste; however, I won't make this again.

I thought this was okay.  It was a nice change from the spaghetti sauce in jars that we usually use.
I did think there were too many peppers and onions, though.

I make this every couple of months and the family loves it.

modifications/notes:
I let simmer for 5-6 hours.
Don't overdo the sugar.

Great recipe!  The only changes I made were to replace 1/3 lb of the ground beef with ground italian sausage, added some baby carrots and chopped squash, and let it simmer for about 1.5 hours.

I read through the reviews before I made this and cut my sugar in half but it was still a little sweet for my taste, But will make again just adjust to my families taste preferences. Thanks for a great base recipe.

Everyone thought these meat sauce was great.  I used my own judgment and cut back on the green peppers and it turned out great.

Excellent sauce.  Made it twice and came out the same both times.  I like onions a lot but 2 onions is too much.  Also I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar (made more sense).

Pretty good, although I was hoping for something with a little more spice as it was a little too bland.

I was looking for something a little different for a meatsauce but unfortunately this won't be it.  I think this would make an awesome base for chili if you added some chili powder and cayenne but as a pasta sauce it was lacking for our tastes.  I even added some red pepper flakes after cooking and it still was very bland.  We'll continue to look for another sauce ... thanks anyway!

Very good.  I added Italian sausage as well and free-poured some red wine, added chopped carrots and asparagus.  Also cut down on the sugar.  Next time will try some mushrooms and in the slow cooker.

I USED A CAN OF PASTE AND CUT THE SUGAR IN HALF. ALSO, I DON'T EAT GROUND BEEF, BUT I DO LIKE THE BOCA VEGGIE GROUND BURGER (SOY PRODUCT) AND USED IT IN THIS RECIPE.  YOU'D NEVER KNOW YOU WEREN'TEATING BEEF (MY HUSBAND DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE DIFFERENCE). I THREW ALL INGREDIENTS INTO CROCKPOT; 1 LB FROZEN BURGER, 2 WHOLE ONIONS (I DON'T CARE TO EAT ONION SLICES IN SPAGHETTI SAUCE) AND I USED HALF A SMALL BAG OF FROZEN SLICED RED, GREEN AND YELLOW PEPPERS INSTEAD OF FRESH GREEN AND COOKED ON LOW FOR 5 HOURS.  THIS WAS DYNAMITE!

This was an excellent recipe.  I added some celery and fresh mushrooms and I let it cook all day in my slow cooker while I was at work.  Turned out really well.

This was very good.  I also added black and green olives.  Although I wouldn't say that this was "to die for" sauce, I will be making it again and again.

Very tasty but I would use a little less sugar in the recipe.  I also added mushrooms and wine.  We doubled the recipe, and it still turned out.

This is a great recipe for pasta sauce.  The only thing that I didn't like about it (easily fixable), was that with the amount of sugar added I did end up with a really sweet sauce.  I prefer not as sweet a sauce, next time I'll just cut back on the sugar a little.  Thank you for posting this recipe.
