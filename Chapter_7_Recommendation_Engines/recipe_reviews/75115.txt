This was really good and really fast!  I didn't have any garlic powder so I put one minced garlic clove in with the marinade.  Wonderful!  I will make this again.

The best recipes are quick but don't taste it - and this qualifies!  I used the Kikomann Teriyake Marinade and Saude which is very thin - I wasn't sure how it would work but it was what I had on hand and it was perfect - no need to buy the expensive fancy marinades!  I did add the garlic powder to the melted butter to ensure spreadability rather than sprinkle it on later and it was perfect!  The teriyaki is enough to add flavor but not scream teriyaki.  I would say if you are looking for a recipe that allows the swordfish to shine through with just a hint of flavor, definitely try this one!  I am actually thinking this might be an interesting try on chicken breast this weekend too!!

This was excellent!  Didn't have any teriyaki sauce on hand, so I combined soy sauce + 1 tbls. honey + sprinkle of dried ginger instead and it worked great.  Also used real butter to baste.  Can't wait to make it again.

A great weekday meal.  Only 30 minutes from start to finish, easy to prepare with items most already have in their kitchen, and tasty as you can imagine!  A must try!!

Swordfish was on sale so I figured I'd pick some up & throw it on the grill.  I'm so glad that I took the time to look up this recipe, since I had everything needed to make this quick, easy meal.  I followed everything as written and it came out just WONDERFUL!!!

i will say that as a simple fish recipe, this was great but it needed more flavor (for me anyway). i added some lemon to my teriyaki sauce and i mixed the garlic with the butter. the grilling time was spot on. it was fast, easy, and simple but you may just have to add what you think for something more flovorful. my husband and i had them as sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, and some mayo. my husband thought it was amazing, so if you have a husband who likes simple food, make this.

Sorry, but I just didn't like the teriyaki flavor with swordfish at all. I followed the recipe exactly, but it came out way too tangy and sharp tasting.

I would post a picture, but my family ate it too fast! Very simple.  I combined a few recipes, used a little risling, teriyaki and worchester sauce with minced garlic.  Marinated it for about 2 hours, and then grilled, basting with butter garlic mixture.  My father is not a fan of fish, and he couldn't get enough!

This was super easy and turned out fantastic.  It almost tasted like a teriyaki glaze.  My husband was so in awe of my grilling skills after eating this meal.  A definite keeper.

this was a good recipe.  My husband had the swordfish and even though he wasnt sure how he felt about the taste of the fish (it was his first time) The flavor was good.

The family really enjoyed this one!  It was fast and easy to prepare and cook.  I wanted to grill and the family wanted Swordfish.  They never had it before and I never prepared it before... So Thank you for a wonderful family dinner!

Quite tasty, but I'm not convinced that a teriyaki flavour works that well. There are other grilled swordfish recipes that I prefer. But don't get me wrong. This is eatable.

I thought this great for our first time making swordfish!  I to didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used soy sauce, honey and ginger. It was so good my 8yrs old loved it as well!  Thank you!

Super simple and delicious. I even forgot to use the butter and it still came out perfect. I think next time I'll add some sesame seeds.

Very mild.  I added lime zest like one reviewer suggested.  Did not do the sauce.  Tried another more zestier sauce and it was great with the mild fish.

Awesome main dish!! Had never tried swordfish before & this was a winner!  Very quick & easy.  I used butter instead of margarine & added a little Weber Roasted Garlic & Herb Seasoning. Husband loved it as well!  Will certainly be making this again. :-)

We smoked the swordfish on grill.  It far exceeded our expectations, but felt it needed something.  Next time I'll try either basting fish with honey while smoking or deglazing the remaining teriyaki sauce and adding a touch of brown sugar or honey to drizzle over fish when done cooking.

This was so easy, so moist and delicious, I know it will be a mainstay among my seafood recipes.  Highly recommend it.  I had initially put the swordfish on a cedar plank (which I do for salmon), but soon after realized that it did not need it to remain intact.  A great way -- and a different way -- to enjoy swordfish.  Also, the garlic powder at the end was an essential seasoning that rounded out the flavor.  I wouldn't eliminate it.

Recipe was spot on!
Both cooking times and grilling technique was perfect.

I have to give it 4 stars because I did change the ingredients a bit --going with what I had in the pantry!  I used soy sauce with some ground ginger and garlic powder, 2 tsp. honey, 1 Tbsp. Butter.  Very good.

Outstanding.  Easy and tasteful.  Cooked the fish on the grill (400 F) and removed at 135 F.  Moist.  Basted with melted butter.

Swordfish is my favorite seafood hands down and I am fortunate to live in New England where the supply is good. Until recently I was never served swordfish that was seasoned with garlic. I had a piece today and in my opinion, the garlic seasoning absolutely ruined an otherwise excellent piece of fish. As far as I am concerned, the garlic powder should be deleted from this recipe!

I also did not have teriyaki sauce on hand.  Used 1/2 C light soy sauce, 1 TB honey and a few sprinkles of ginger as the marinade.  Everything else as written in the recipe.  OUTSTANDING

Pretty good and quick, I only had soy sauce but worked like a charm.  I cooked both sides 5 minutes seemed tough so I'll another minute each side.

The seasonings were too strong for the fish. We would rather taste the swordfish than just seasonings. I will not make this again.

Easy, quick and tasty!  Love that in a recipe!  Teriyaki is a nice complement to swordfish, we enjoyed this.
