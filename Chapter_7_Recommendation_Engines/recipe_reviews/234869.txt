I had made a skillet of cornbread and had to try this the next day. I used a pizza cutter to cut the slices thin without crumbling the bread. Brushed some with garlic butter some with just butter. I think my cornbread needed to dry out more as it took 20 minutes just on one side to crisp and brown then 5 more minutes on the other side. Or maybe I was a little heavy handed with the butter brushing! It is delightful and it is a perfect use for leftover stale cornbread. Thanks HotGrandma!

I am the submitter. My usual cornbread has sugar so may make it brown quicker. I make mine to have a golden crust but not dry inside. Cooking time will vary depending on your cornbread recipe & how dry you wish it to be.

HotGrandma - this is the BEST recipe! I now make cornbread just for the sole purpose of making your recipe. My DH likes cornbread but could really do without. He LOVES this recipe as much as I do. I've made it with the garlic without the garlic and the last time with just a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon. All three ways were delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Easy and very good. I cut the cornbread slices into squares. Great with soup or with cheese on top.

This was awesome with chili. I'll never be able to make cornbread any other way for my husband who doesn't really like cornbread but loved this! Such a simple concept; such a terrific result!

garlicky crunchy goodness....this was a perfect way for me to use up some cornbread that was leftover. We needed a little more garlic so I made some the way the recipe was written and then I added some minced garlic to the top of the rest that hadn't been eaten. Good stuff definately try this recipe...I'm glad I did. Thanks HappyGrandma:)
