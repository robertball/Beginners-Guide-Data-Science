Recipe calls for 1/2 tsp salt which is way Too salty.  Next time Iâ€™ll just add a small pinch.  Would have rated a 5 except for the saltiness.  I also added dark 85% cacao chocolate chips to the batter.

I'm giving this a 4 stars when considering it is low carb. If I were to compare to regular brownies, it would get a negative 4, lol. But there is definitely a chocolate taste that helps ease the sweet tooth. And they were easy to make.
