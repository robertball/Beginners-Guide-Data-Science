This is a very good stew! and lovely with all the colors, even if it is a lot of chopping. My comments: there is no need to cook the sweet potatoes separately.  Just peel and cut them up, and add with the rest of the veggies.  They will be done by the time the pork is done. This recipe is excellent (and quicker) with the addition of 2 cups chopped cooked ham, instead of the pork.

I made this recipe for a big party of 30, and it turned out great.  We substituted black beans for the kidney beans and added a bit of white pepper near the end for more spice.  Wonderful mix of colors in the finished stew, and everyone raved about the flavor.

A Winner! Followed exactly except for using 2 cans of beans. Remember this is BUSH's recipe.  They are pushing their beans - which are good. At the end I thickened the sauce by trying a new method (new for me that is!)that I saw the Barefoot Contessa use on TV.  With a fork combine 2 tablespoons of softened butter with 3 tablespoons of flour and then add a little at a time to the sauce to reach the thickness you desire.  It might be adding more calories but it does keep the richness of the stew going!!

This recipe is fantastic and Im making it again tonight. I made minor variations to it and we love how it came out.  I made the broth from a bouillion cube and I used 2 10oz cans of Rotel Mexican Lime and Cilantro Diced Tomatoes. I put everything in my slow cooker on low for the day.  I think the sweet potatoes helped thicken it a little as well.  This was one of those dishes that we just kept says mmmmmm with every bite and kept commenting on how good it is.

This dish is absolutely delicious. It was a bit of a sell to the kids but I think children need to try new flavors or they'll live off KD their entire lives.

I used regular potatoes as we don't like sweet, and omitted the celery as Husband isn't a fan. Also added way more cumin, and stirred in some homemade hotsauce. I made this with just under a pound of pork tenderloin, and I thought one 15oz can of kidney beans was ample. This was an easy, hearty meal. Thanks!

This was delicous and so full of good for you stuff.  I used one can of black beans and two kidney.  Not much heat but maybe I didn't use enough peppers.

This recipe makes a fairly tasty stew. I used an entire jalapeno pepper as I prefer spicy food, especially when the word 'Caribbean' is involved, but it still needed more. The addition of some habanero hot sauce really elevated my appreciation. All in all, there ought to be more spice in this dish, but it's a good starter.

This was wonderful!  I started with the meat and just threw everything else in the pot (did not pre-cook the potatoes).  I did not make the pinapple stuff but put in green apple at the very end.  Loved the sweet spicy taste of this stew!  The pork was to die for and did not have to thicken at all.  A great way to use up leftovers!

This has great ing. but there is something missing in it. I didn't add hot sauce like some suggested just because I'm really not a hot sauce person, but it does need something. I added extra cumin and pepper but it just wasn't enough. I might try it again adding more spices. There is no need to precook the potatoes. I just tossed them in with everything else and they ended up being more than done.

Wow! This was good! Followed the recipe to a T, except i peeled and cubed the sweet potato and added it right to the pot and it cooked beautifully in the simmering stew.   If you like more heat add a whole jalapeno. I Highly recommend you try this!!!

For the beans I used 1 can kidney, 1 can black and 1 can chickpeas. I also used 4 serranos instead of jalapeno. Are supermarket peppers getting more mild or is it just me? I should have put in at least 2 more.  Added a couple bay leaves, touch of allspice and dried parsley.  Followed the cooking instructions as written, but next time I will do the procedure a bit different.  I will brown the meat in batches as the first step. As written the garlic started to burn before I could get a good sear, and the pot is too crowded to get a good fond. Also I think I will peel and cut up the sweet potatoes first before microwaving, just for ease in handling. I found I wanted to thicken it at the end since it was very soupy, and just used some cornstarch dissolved in water. Still, the finished stew even though not perfect was delicious and very gorgeous with all those colors! It just seems these flavors belong together. I feel healthier just looking at it: Nutrient City! I'll be making this often.

This was a very good recipe (with out changing anything) to make on a weekend.  It takes a little too long to make during the week.

This turned out great, wonderful recipe for a cold day!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I did end up adding 2 jalapenos, instead of the 1/4 that the recipe called for and a serano pepper too.  We like things pretty spicy and it turned out just right for us!

We really liked this.  My 17 month old finished his bowl and then some.  I didn't think the pineapple relish was necessary but my husband liked it.  I too would add the entire jalapeno next time for extra spice.

Wonderful flavors and healthy.  I used a can of rotel instead of jalapenos since my husband doesn't like them.  Turned out great.
