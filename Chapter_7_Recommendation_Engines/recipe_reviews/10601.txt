Awesome recipe best ones I have ever had. Only think I would add is the amount of time you should cook while at a boil. I used old fashon oats and it needed to boil for about 2-3 minutes for it to set properly. Must make again

Try this recipe with brown sugar instead of the white sugar.  Yum!

I am sure these would have tasted fantastic had I not used steel cut oats.  The bag said "Ready in 5 Minutes" so I assumed they were quick cooking!  They smelled great but turned out awful!  I did not have any quick cooking oats on hand so for my second batch I used Rice Krispies instead and they turned out delicious!

I can't say enough about this recipe! It's delicious, fast and if you make them tiny (the way we prefer them) you can get over 100. My 3 year old son helps me stir up the batches and the whole thing lasts about 2 days. I dare you to eat just one!

Very good.  Held together well.  If you use natural peanut butter, make sure to add a bit more sugar since there is none in the peanut butter itself.

Thought these were pretty good but much more like candy rather than a cookie. I thought the two cups of sugar seemed over the top, so I only used one and it was plenty sweet. To make the cookie more interesting, I used three cups of Honey Bunches of Oats cereal and just used the oats to help thicken it up as it was too runny as other reviews stated. I think these would be awesome with coconut. Made these cookies into heart shapes for my sweeties for VD. Kids and hubby enjoyed them, so thanks Tina!

these were great and nice to be able to fix while dinner was in the oven. I used natural peanut butter so I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats to compensate for the liquidity of this type of peanut butter. I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking and it turned out just fine. Brought back memories from childhood for both my husband and for me and my 2 1/2 yr. old loved them.

I have tried many no-bake recipes, and this is by far the best! They turn out perfect every time. I actually prefer old-fashioned oats in these. I just add them to the mix and let them cook for a minute or two. These are definitely the quickest way to any man's heart!

These were awesome! My only change was adding 1/4 cup Karo Syrup (this helps the consistency, so they don't crumble as easily). They taste just like back in the day!

Hubby liked these, but I thought they were too sweet.  Will make for him again.  Might cut back on the sugar.  I like the texture.

Quick, easy, delicious!  Great for a fast chocolate fix.  I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar, plus an extra heaping tablespoon of cocoa.  They were gooey and chocolatey and wonderful!

So I've made this recipe twice now and the 2nd time I used 1/2 Grape Nuts cereal and 1/2 oats because we were running low on oats.  It turned out SO good.  I think you could pretty much use any cereal you have and it would be delicious!

With this recipe (and previous reviews) I finally got my no bake cookies to turn out perfect!  I did add about 1/2 cup more oats and left out the peanuts.  I boiled for 2 minutes and let sit 1 minute before I added the remaining ingredients.  I'm not sure if that did the trick but they firmed up nicely but not too dry.

This is a great peanut butter to chocolate ratio.  These are so good I really shouldn't make them again since I have no self control.

These are delicious  cookies! Only problem is you can't really serve them at a fancy party- they come out looking like lumps of dough, not regular cookies. But they are a great, fast cookie to make and we all love them!

This is an easy, fast and favorite school lunch cookie from childhood.  I used less sugar, more cocoa, old fasioned oats and added craisins and walnuts.

This is a good recipe, and I modified it per other people's suggestions and my own preferences. I doubled it, used only 1.75 cups white sugar and .5 cups of Splenda brown. I put in a bit of extra peanut butter, and followed the suggestion of cooking the first 4 ingredients for a minute once they reached boiling and then adding peanut butter and cooking for another minute. Then I after I added the oats I also added half of a bag of dark chocolate chips (used special dark cocoa too.) What can I say, I'm a chocolate nut and I love the creamier texture you get by adding some real chocolate as well as cocoa. Turned out awesome!

YUUUMMEE, Easy, always in your cupboard ingredients....these would make anyone happy....I couldn't wait for them to cool so I froze them and they tasted better than just room temperature. Since my daughter is allergic to peanuts and I can't make them often cause that is cruel to eat them and not invite, I was thinking to substitute the peanut butter with marshmallow cream and call them almos' smores...what do u think?

I use the same recipe called Fudgey Cocoa No-Bake Treats from Hershey's Best Loved Recipes book.  I spoon the mixture into buttered metal cookie cutters placed on waxed paper and push them out after they harden or give as gifts still in the cookie cutters.  I cut the recipe in half so that it doesn't set up in the pan while I'm filling the cookie cutters since this takes more time than spooning onto waxed paper.

When you need a chocolate fix and you need it fast, these work great.  Everyone should try them.  This was the first cookie recipe my mom showed me how to make when I was really little.  I think I was in first or second grade.  She clipped it from the local newspaper, only it called for 'oleo".  Woa was that a long time ago.  Thanks for sharing.  Now we also like to call these Gorilla turds in my family-hee hee.

Have used this recipe for years!  But, I make chocolate OR peanut butter.  Peanut butter alone is really good--leave out the vanilla and cocoa.  And I always add a tiny pinch of salt--because that's the way my mother used to do it!  Also, I always boil it softly for a few minutes before taking off the stove.  It sets up better that way...

This is a really good recipe which reminds me of the no-bake cookies we used to have which school lunches :)  I suggest adding a touch of corn syrup to prevent the sugar from being grainy. I also used half and half instead of milk (because I had it on hand) to make these even richer, but I've made this recipe with skim milk and margarine with similar results.

Super easy and this will sure fix a chocolate craving! You have to work fast getting these spooned out as they cool quickly. Great little recipe for summer when you need a treat without heating up the whole kitchen.

Love em!

I've made these a few times, and tonight I used margarine instead of butter- not good- the cookies won't set!  They still taste yummy as anything, but they are VERY gooey.  So a bit of advice- use butter!

My granny used to make no-bake cookies for me and these are exactly what I was looking for me. 

I did have to add 1/2 cup extra oatmeal.

Perfect easy recipe as these ingredients are usually on hand. Wonderful for a quick chocolate fix! I added shredded coconut instead of peanuts and spread them all out on a wax-paper lined cookie sheet to be cut into bars instead of drops.

We made this recipe last night and it was a huge hit -- tasted just like I remember from elementary school!

I did make a few modifications because we didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used 3 squares of baker's unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa, and 1 cup of extra chunky peanut butter since we didn't have peanuts. We also used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I'll probably reduce it to 1 cup next time. It is very rich and flavorful.

Instead of individual cookies, we put the mixture into an 8 x 8 baking dish and cut it into bars when it cooled.  They didn't turn out as firm as I would have liked, so I'll probably add more oats next time as others have suggested.  I'm keeping this batch in the refrigerator and the coldness seems to keep them firm.

Thanks for sharing!

I have always loved these cookies. I decided to look for the recipe one day because I was on a diet but craving chocolate, and these lend themselves to healthy modifications. I used only 1/4 cup butter and replaced half the sugar with Splenda.  I also used fat-free milk, natural PB, and dark cocoa. I swear you won't be able to tell the difference, and using less butter made them firmer. Thanks for a great (and adaptable) recipe!

I tried this recipe today and it wasnt what I expected. I thought there were too many oats. next time I will try less oats. The taste is good but I couldnt get them to set up correctly. They werent firm when I cooled them. Does anyone have any idea what I might have done wrong? I boiled the mix for a little over 2 minutes and I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again They tasted great considering they didnt set up lol.

I just made these and I found that the recipe needed 1/2 cup more oats. They don't solidify properly without it, even so it's a fine recipe.

After reading what others posted about being too sweet, I cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup (3/4 brown, 3/4 white). Instead of 2 tsp vanilla,  3/4 tsp vanilla and 3/4 tsp maple. 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. They are so soft n chewy. My 1st time to make these. Someone else always made them before and they were always dry and hard. Now I get to eat them all. LoL So very yummy!

Delicious. And it set up great. I used a little more than 1/4 cup of butter and I added about 1/2 cup more oats. I added the last ingredients to the boiling sugar and stirred it really well about a minute. Turned out wonderful.

My cookies turned out with an exceptional flavor but a bit dry and crumbly. I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that I am not sure if the cookies turned out how they did because of the recipe or because I allowed the liquid portion to boil too long or not long enough. Otherwise, they tasted amazing!!

If you don't have quick cooking oats on hand only old fashioned or others. Just put them in the food processor or blender to make smaller that is the only difference. They cook faster cuz they are smaller not cuz their a different type of oat. Hope this helps.

These are great! The only thing I did differently was I used a candy thermometer and boiled until it got to the soft ball stage and I used 1/2 c. brown sugar b/c I ran out of white sugar. Soooo good!

The wonderful thing is they actually hardened.  This is the hardest thing with these no bake recipes.  I used Hersheys dark chocolate cocoa for all you dark lovers out there.  I was out of vanilla and but they still came out great.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

Ummmmm, AWESOME!!!  These cookies were SO good!!  My mom used to make these when I was a kid & I loved them!!  The only change I made was to use 1 C brown sugar & 1 C white sugar. I also used just a little more cocoa than called for.  They set up perfectly and I made about 3 dozen.  DELICIOUS!!  I will definitely be making these on a regular basis!!!

These are YUMMY ! The ingrediants are always in my pantry and they are so easy to make.   For that last minute potluck, try these, they are so much better than bringing a bag of chips, pop, or some paper plates! For a simple touch, add decorative sprinkles of your choice.

The flavor is great!  Love this recipe. I went with other reviews and used 1 1/2 c. sugar - didn't even miss it!  I was in a hurry so I didn't measure the peanut butter, just added a few helping tbsp. and we didn't have enough oats for the second batch so I used what oats I had and some Rice Chex.  Kids loved it!!  It's also good made with pretzels instead of oats!  Wonderful... you should try it.

This recipe really hit the spot! I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added a bit less peanut butter (I thought it would be overpowering if I didn't). It came out very good...not cloyingly sweet, not in need of more sugar either. They tasted like a candy bar to me though...like maybe Snickers or something! But they set good and were delicious! I also upped the cocoa a bit.

Not my favorite cookie in the world, but it sure takes me back to being a kid and making this at home. It was one of the first cookies I ever made on my own. I love it just for that reason, to share with my kids the memories I have making it.

Great recipe!  I used old fashioned oats, and a touch of brown sugar.  Other commenters are right, it needs to boil for a solid two minutes - but starting that countdown once you've got a full rolling boil is key.  I omitted the peanuts and added an extra 1/3 - 1/2 cup of oats.  Also, I bumped the vanilla to 1T.  Super good, super easy to make - using a disher (little tiny ice cream scoop) makes them super easy to drop too!

Excellent recipe. I had lost my recipe and when I came looking for another, I decided to try this one. Really good. If you think it looks a little thin you can always add a touch of powdered sugar to thicken it. ALWAYS use butter.

Made these to take to a girl's night out tonight since my oven in broken and I don't feel like buying anything. Pretty good, and my 4 year old really enjoyed helping me. I did make a few changes, and thus the 4 stars instead of 5. First, I did not melt the cocoa in with the butter, sugar and milk. I mixed the oats in a big mixing bowl with the cocoa (I used 6 T, so just over 1/3 cup), used chopped pecans instead of peanuts (not for any specific reason other than it's what I had), and added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut. I mixed that all together. Then in a saucepan, I melted the sugar, milk and margarine instead of butter (but again no real reason other than it's what I had), and brought it to a boil. I let it boil for 1 minute, turned off the heat and added the vanilla and peanut butter. I only used 1 tsp of vanilla and only 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter. I stirred it until the peanut butter was melted then poured it over the oat mixture and mixed until everything was well coated. Then dropped by the spoonful on waxed paper and put in the refrigerator. It was really tasty. I could have eaten it by the spoonful warm, right out the mixing bowl.

My kids love these cookies and I love how quick and easy they are to make.  I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup and used 1 cup chunky peanut butter instead of the separate peanut butter and chopped peanuts.  I have it on hand much more often!  I also used my ice cream scoop to make the cookies really fast.  I just spritz it with a touch of cooking spray first.

I grew up on these cookies.  My mom made them all the time because they were a slightly healthy alternative to traditional cookies.  However, in her recipe she only used about half the amount of butter listed here.  Also for slightly different flavor, she would sometimes use Nutella rather than peanut butter.  I just made them for my kids and they love them too!

I remember making a similar cookie many years ago but lost the recipe. I love this recipe version of the cookies, it is PERFECT! I also used to buy this type of cookie from Walmart's Bakery, but they recently stopped carrying them, much to my hubby's disappointment, so I went on a search which led me here to this recipe and it's even better than the Walmart cookie. My family loves them. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

I have looked for a long time for a recipe that would make cookies that turned out hard that you could pick up and eat and this was it. 

I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and every batch turned out perfect. I did add extra chocolate because it didn't seem chocolaty enough for my taste. Very good cookies!:)

I came across this recipe whilst looking for one I had helped cook & adored at a kind of holiday camp. This had the same ingredients, so I gave it a go. I made a few changes; reduced the sugar by 1/2 a cup, omitted the vanilla & subbed raisins for the peanuts. I also used crunchy peanut butter (my favourite). However, even after the sugar reduction these were too sweet (the ones we had made before had been really rich, like dark chocolate), and tasted too much of peanut butter. It was easy & yummy, but this recipe needed too many changes for me to give it 5 stars.

These cookies are yummy! Made these all the time as a teenager and decided to try them again.  These didn't come out as fudge like as I am use to, but I may have heated the mix too long.  Try this one it's great!

We have made these in our family for years, except we call them "cookies or candy" They are so yummy and only take about 10 minutes to make. We use peanut butter with peanuts instead of adding peanuts. If you like peanut butter, then these are a must have! You can add more or less milk to make them harder or creamier.

I've loved this cookie since I was a kid. These were just like i remembered, FAB! By accident I used  old fashion cooking oats, instead of Quick oats. They turned out ok, kinda chewy.  I'll be sure to follow the recipe and use the quick oats next time!!

This is my favorite no bake cookie recipe, hands down. I have tried many, many recipes over the years, but the texture of this one is my favorite. This recipe has been used probably 10 times at our house over the years. I think it is the shorter cooking time that does the trick. I don't add peanuts, and do not like old fashioned oats in this type of cookie (use quick oats). Adding a pinch of salt is good. I usually half the recipe and don't measure perfectly, but the cookies turn out wonderfully anyway.

These are amazing. Instead of cocoa, I used a bag of chocolate chip cookies. I also just used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter. Delicious and easy.

Excellent. I needed for a desert to make for family movie night and I was pressed for time. I stumbled upon this recipe which I was able to through together in less than 20 minutes. The ingredients are wonderfully simple; I didn't need to run to the store to buy ingredients. My only suggestion would to use a large saucepan instead of the medium.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE This Cookie!!! So Glad to have found this cookie. I have been looking for almost 7 years for this cookie. This was my & my brother's most favorite cookie growing up. It was on our lunch tray at school, from Grade school thru High School. We LOVE THIS COOKIE! I also made it with Splenda and was awesome this way too. I am diabetic now and still enjoy these as much as I did growing up.

These "no-bakes" are absolutely delicious, but very similar to making fudge, (seems like a LOT of sugar.)  They "sat up" quickly and nicely; I used my Pampered Chef ice-cream scooper to scoop them out quickly onto the wax paper.  (I sprayed the scoop with a small amount of Pam, for easy release.)  I WILL make these again!  Yum!

These are great no bake cookies!! I used old fashioned oats, almond milk, 1/4 cup almond butter, and a heaping 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter, also added a dash of salt, and did not add peanuts. Fabulous :)

Easy and always a success!  I reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and add the oats after the mixture boils.

Awesome recipe! After the first batch, my boyfriend forbid me to make them again (he couldn't stop eating them)! Then, as soon as they were gone, he requested another batch!

Used to make these all the time with my mom when my sister and I were little - so glad to find this recipe again! My husband tried to make them recently but ended up with a recipe that called for condensed milk and they came out much too fudgey. This recipe is closer to how my mom made them (minus the additional chopped peanuts). So good!

This is a family favorite.  I don't put the peanuts in it but I have made it with crunchy peanut butter for a change and they like it both ways.

I made these with my great-nieces and they were a hit!  Easy to do and they liked them.  I can't have the sugar but I'm thinking I could make them with splenda and even mix some protein powder in to make them healthy.  But the kids are already planning what different kinds of ingredients we can add next time.  They called them "Dogpiles"...LOL

We love these! I did use the advise of others and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also added white chocolate chips that I had on hand. My boyfiend's daughter helped and we had fun as always. More like candy than a cookie. Went great with fresh strawberries for dessert at our Sunday cookout. I plan on freezing some for a weekend trip.

I thought these cookies turned out really good.  I had never made no-bake cookies before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The only thing I did a little different was add about a 1/2 cup more oats, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T and they were really good.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I remember eating these at school as a kid. I bought some at the store the other day, and they were not good.  So I found this recipe and made my own and this is perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly and I will be making this a lot more often. My family has almost eaten the whole batch in less than a day!

Quick and easy. I used my pampered chef cookie/melon baller to scoop them out then flattened them out slightly. Turned out all uniform and wonderful. Reminds me of my great grandmother's recipe. Thanks!

Very very good cookies....but not advisable for a group of people over 15. Then you'll spend hours scooping it out and eventually the dough will get to brittle to simply scoop out.

LOVED IT!!  Thanks.

I boiled the mixture for 3 minutes to make the texture smooth, not gritty.

I did not find this very exciting - the texture of the raw oats were not intriguing to me - after dropping several on the wax paper, I decided to add some raisins to pep it up a bit !!  I probably won't make this again !  too many other "better" things !

These were just OK.  I was looking for a richer flavor.  Maybe even more peanut butter.  I found that the mixture was a little runny at first.  So I waited to scoop out the cookies until it cooled for a minute or two.  The texture of the cookies was perfect.  I just wanted more flavor.

Just made these, still waiting for them to cool completely, but I ate one anyways ;) and it was awesome! I did add a 1/2 cup extra oats to thicken it more and turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a good solution for those times when YOU NEED COOKIES NOW and either don't have much time or certain ingredients.  Its definitely quick and easy.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I used chunky peanut butter.  I think these were really good, but not as flavorful as I would've liked and I thought they were just a little dry.  Next time, I might try adding in some chocolate chips at the end.

This came out very good. Because so many people commented on them being too soft, I made a few adjustments to the cooking times. When the cocoa mixture came to a boil, I let it boil for one minute. I added the peanut butter, let it return to a boil and boiled for one more minute. I removed from the heat and let it set for two minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. I made these late at night and let them set on the counter. By morning, they were perfect!!!!! Not soft, not hard!!! I consider these more of a candy than a cookie. Either way, they are delicious.

These are much more liquid then I think they should be and I always have to add extra oats, sometimes to many and make the cookie dry.

i was SO disappointed w/this recipe...it came out really runny-i had to throw it all out--Then i realized i couldn't read my own writing and used 2 cups of milk instead of a 1/2. i managed to mess up no bakes--hahhahaa-2nd attempt was much more fruitful- i love dark chocolate so i used a little dark chocolate cocoa powder mixed w/the regular cocoa powder. also used the tip of crunchy peanut butter. that saved a step. thanks!

These were just super!  My five year old helped me make them (after the lava chocolate stage) and my three year old helped lick the bowl!  We cut down on the sugar quite a bit and they are still great.

VERY tasty and so easy to make.  I could not find my cocoa so the cocoa ended up being omitted.  I will definitely make again but next time I believe I will use about one cup of sugar. The two cups were a bit much.

Good tasting recipe. Just one thing. When you get 1 min. Then take off heat and cool for a 1 min. If you don't do this it will NOT firm up. I think this recipe has a good amount of coco. Very tasty cookies. My boys love them.

My kids and I made this on a whim and they were sooo good.  We didn't want to wait for them to cool, though.  So we just put the warm dough in bowls and ate it with spoons.  The kids said that it was better warm.

These cookies are excellent. I didn't have enough oats, so I did half oats and half plain cheerios. I had to add extra cheerios. The cereal gave it an interesting texture, very very good.

This recipe was awesome! The first time I made it I didn't have any cocoa, so I used two squares of bakers chocolate. I melted them, then poured it on top of the rest of the ingredients, then mixed it together... they were sooo good! Now, I have people asking me to make them all the time!

These are sooo yummy Tina.  I left out the peanuts and reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp.  My kids are not too crazy about this cookie...the oatmeal throws them off, go figure!  BUT, I enjoyed them very much.  Thanks for sharing.

These were yummy and easy, but I found them extremely sweet (from the sugar) and salty (from the peanut butter).  For a cookie monster like me who usually demolishes cookies as fast as they appear, I could only handle about two of these without diving for a big glass of water.  These cookies are good to make if you are serving fruit and/or a light dessert with them, like I did for our work potluck.

Delicious!! Brings back memories from making these as a kid. No changes, but I used extra chunky peanut butter (with no additional peanuts) and 1 min quick cooking oats. Perfection!

Update: I made this a second time, and it didn't set quite as well. I ran out of cocoa after only using 1/4 cup, so I added 1 square of baking chocolate. Maybe that's why, or maybe I didn't let it quite get to a full rolling boil. Either way, they still taste great, and by letting them sit out an hour or longer they are still soft but can hold their shape well enough to be picked up and eaten.

This is a delicious and easy to make treat that with subtle tweaks can also be easy on the calories / sodium!

I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups, and used 1 cup brown & .5 white. I also used low fat, unsalted natural smooth peanut butter and crushed unsalted dry roasted peanuts. You'll never miss the salt when you savor them.

Each 2.5 to 3 inch blob: 147 calories and only 9 sodium!!!

These set up nicely! Nice and thick. I spread mine out just a bit after dropping on the paper. I added just a tad more peanut butter due to preference but outside of that - perfect!

Will make again! The ONLY change I made (based on others' suggestions) was to scale down on the sugar...I used 1 1/3 cup. I did let boil for 2 minutes and waited 1 minute before adding oats. I also used 1.5 cups oats and 1.5 cups Rice Krispies cereal...Was still somewhat soft so I kept cookies refrigerated.

These are a classic.  I always followed my mom's recipe which called for double the amounts since she was baking for a large family.  I stopped making them as drop cookies and use a pan and cut into bars. I suggest using quick cooking oats though.

A real eye catcher! I made this receipe before and it was called dropped cookies or No Bake. I have never seen it shaped like a butterfly with the candy decorations ever before. It is adorable! I would like to make it just like the picture but I read the directions and it doesn' t say how to do the butterfly shape nor does it say what kind of candy is on the wings? I think that is nutty. I am wondering if it is a mistake?

So good! But, unlike what happened to other reviewers, mine turned out too dry. So, next time, I won't let it boil for so long and will use a bit less oats.

Great recipe! I substituted the butter with applesauce, sugar with stevia/maltodextrin mix, milk with lactose free nonfat milk, and peanut butter with Just Great Stuff chocolate peanut powder for a dairy free/ low sugar/ very low fat recipe. I spooned the mix onto the baking sheet with a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon and each large cookie comes out to roughly 30 calories.

Applesauce substituting is a little dicey with no-bakes, but the peanut powder absorbs the extra moisture quite well.

Nice and chewy- not dry at all. I did cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and will try just one cup next time. I also upped the oats to 3 1/2 cups and the pnut butter to one cup.

Wonderful and easy. I used only a cup and a half of sugar and 1 whole cup of peanut butter. Left out the peanuts because I'm not a fan. The cookies kept their shape but stayed slightly soft--the way we like them.

Great recipe!  Added 1/4 c of corn syrup, increased the oats by 1/3 c, cut the sugar to 1 c and they set up perfectly.  I did boil for 2-3 minutes.

I looked up this recipe for the amounts of the ingredients, as I could not find my old recipe.  I made a batch of cookies and they are just as I remember. I have been making these cookies since Junior high.  I hope you find my suggestions helpful.  Just stating what works for me, I am sure there are other solutions as well.
1.  You don't need the vanilla - I did not use it, maybe that is what makes it to runny to set up for some user (?)
2.  I always cook with only butter.  Margarines can vary a lot by brand and variety so they are hard to predict in recipes.
3.  I use old fashion oats with no problem.  They are a chewy, but I like it that way
4.  Use an oversized pan.  It makes stirring in the peanut butter and oats much easier. I melt the butter on low, then add the milk, sugar, and cocoa and bring to a boil on medium.  Then turn off the burner. I do not remove the pan from the heat, and then add the peanut butter and stir it in to melt it before adding the oats.  I do not measure the peanut butter, so i think i add close to 1 cup of peanut butter. I then quickly scoop the cookies with a wooden spoon to a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  30 minutes or so in the refrigerator and they are firm.  I always leave a few to cool on the counter and eat warm and gooey.  I keep the fininshed cookies in the refrigerator.

I hope you enjoy these suggestions and would love to hear how they work for you.

Love these and have been making them for years. Agree with previous reviewers to reduce sugar to about 1 and 3/4 c (I don't care for these with brown sugar - white is better to my taste), no need for Karo, use rolled oats (not quick cooking or steel cut). I combine everything except vanilla and cook together for a minimum of 2 minutes (softens up the oats) and use a whisk to keep stirring. Let sit 1 min and then drop them out. I also leave out the actual peanuts - pb is sufficient. One of my favorite cookies from childhood!

This is a good basics recipe, but I too think you need the boil the initial ingredients for longer, 2-4 minutes, long enough that the sugar crystal's start to dissolve. I personally use only 1 1/2 cup sugar for the full recipe, or 3/4 for half recipe. I don't love these cookies, but it works on a warm summer day when the craving for chocolate and PB hit!

These were SO good!  I've tried other recipes, and this one surely has more of a chocolate flavor.  (I followed the recipe exactly as stated)  I'll definitely be making these again, soon!

Better recipe than the ones I have tried in the past. I don't like to use a lot of sugar, so I used one cup of dark honey and a half cup of sugar. They turned out chewy and good.

Made 1 batch and they turned out perfect, however made a second one right after because we wanted more & they never really set up.  No idea how that happened.  I used 1 cup brown suger & 1/2 cup white, 3 1/2 cups oats, no peanuts and slightly less than 2 tsp vanilla.

great and easy recipe. Next time I will reduce the sugar 1/4 cup because it was a bit too sweet for me. I did double the vanilla and I also used white chocolate peanut butter which made it YUM!

These are very good! I cut the sugar by a 1/3 but they were still pretty sweet --good nonetheless. I live in a country where oatmeal and peanut butter are nearly impossible to get, but these are worth the use of my precious supplies!

I made these for my husband last week because No-Bakes are one of his "desert island" favorites......unfortunately, he said they were "too chocolatey " which I took to mean the cocoa was too much/strong. I also made them with brown sugar as per someone else's suggestion, and that may not have been the best choice.  Oh, don't get me wrong, they got eaten; by me....the lion's share of two dozen! Which brings me to one more note, the yield is a bit overstated here. You may want to double the recipe should you try it.

I had to remake this about 3 times in order to get it right. do not cool for a minute!... add the hot mixture to oats asap... also make sure that the dough is not goopy.. if so add more oats. I tried this recipe with old fashioned oats firt, not a good idea. Use instant oats!

This cookie has great flavor.  However, we felt 3 cups of oats was too much.  They came out a little dry. We'll make again but with less oatmeal.

These cookies are AMAZING, and sooo easy!  I did boil the chocolate mixture for 2-3 minutes like others suggested and also used crunchy peanut butter which eliminated the need for extra peanuts.  The recipe made 3.5 dozen medium-size cookies.  I would make them again in a heartbeat!!!

Fabulous for a spur of the moment dessert!  I added coconut (as suggested by another reviewer), white chocolate chips, and baking m&m's.  I used crushed Crispix cereal with one cup of oats.  Next time I will add more of the cereal.  I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  Seems a little sweet, so I might only use 1 1/2 cups of both sugars next time.

These cookies turned out exceptional. They were super easy to whip up with what ingredients I had in the house. I thought about using the steel cut oats I had to add some tougher texture, but was a little nervous to do so, and stuck with the instant oatmeal. I will definitely make these again and try the steel cut oats. I also added some coconut and some walnuts which added a little something special. These would be great to make with a child. Since they are shapeless, it would be fun for a child to help dollup the batter onto the sheets. I cooled them quickly in the fridge, and they were ready to eat right away.

This recipe was great except that I had to change a few things. I have an allergy to peanuts so I had to change the peanut butter to nutella a hazelnut chocolate spread also left out the peanuts and had to add extra oats. My son loved them as did my hubby and I will be making them again.

Just made them a few minutes ago, and have to say they are delicious. We followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful . Tastes just like a crunchy Reece's Cup. Will make again in the future!

This recipe was on a cocoa box when I was a kid.  I can’t find it any more and have been trying to make it from memory.  I finally have the right measurements without having to guess anymore.  Thanks.

Just like my childhood! I had to add more oats to it thick enough, but I just did until the texture was where I wanted it. I struggled waiting for them to cool - they are SO good!

These were very good.  Boyfriend requested them and was worried I had picked the wrong recipe until he tried them and declared they were exactly like the ones from when he was a kid.  Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and raised the peanut butter and oats a little bit.  Thanks.

I would like to say that i have not made this good of no-bake cookies in about 12 years.  My mother in law makes them but for some reason hers don't get hard enough.  These are perfect.  I will keep this recipe forever!

Very good!  I couldn't find the version of this recipe my sister gave me and was glad to find your's.  I don't like peanuts in mine, but added a 1/2 cup more oats in place of them to thicken it up a little bit more.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe but I did change it a little.  I added more cocoa and sugar, because they just weren't as chocolatey as I remembered from my childhood.

I had an old version of this recipe once, but it was slightly different.  I decided to try this one anyway, and it didn't turn out right... the proportions of sugar and cocoa are WAY off and too much peanut butter in this recipe encourages this recipe to clump up too soon and then to be too dry.

It's so hard to eat just one of these! I'm really glad to have found this recipe, as it has been a favorite of mine since I was a young girl. Simple and easy, the most difficult part is waiting for the cookies to set up. Enjoy!

Very Yummy! My little girl helped and it was a fun recipe to make with her. We only used about a cup and a half of sugar and used a whole cup of peanut butter and more oats ;P. We couldn't hardly wait for them to cool and ate a few warm gooey ones. My daughter did add about 2 t vanilla then was needed and decorated some with Tedddy Grahams. She enjoyed herself!!

When you need that sweet/salty fix, this is terrific!  And if you're trying to cut back a bit, I made these with Splenda ~ no difference!

Definitely satisfied my chocolate craving...but too chewy for my taste.  They didn't set up the way I remember as a kid.  Good cookies, though, and you can't beat the easiness of no bakes!

Great recipe that definately satisfies your chocolate craving.  I was out of cocoa powder so I substituted 2 squares unsweetened bakers chocolate and that worked wonderfully!

I get so many requests for this cookie. They're incredibly simple to make and taste fantastic!! Great for the peanut-butter fanatics in the family! I prefer to keep them in the freezer and reach in whenever I have a craving.

We used to make a similar recipe when I was growing up.  Ours had a bit more peanut butter and less vanilla, but these were delicious!  Make sure you have plenty of milk to drink!

Easy and tasty.  Very rich, however, so be sure to have plenty of cold milk on hand for snackers.  Only 4 stars because they aren't perfect. The oatmeal gives a rather odd texture...not bad, just odd.  Store in the fridge to avoid a gooey mess.

These cookies are GREAT! My husband really doesn't like chocolate, but he couldn't get enough of these. Of course, I love chocolate and I thought they were wonderful as well. I will make these again and again.
