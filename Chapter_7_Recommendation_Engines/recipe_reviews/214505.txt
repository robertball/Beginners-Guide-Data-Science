Thanks, Dylan! I just enjoyed this delicious soup. I used a couple turns of garlic/sea salt and low-sodium chicken stock. I also boiled it longer than the called-for 15 minutes after adding the chicken stock, as I like mushy carrots.   I'll definitely be making this again!

Sounds delicious, but I hate soups that I have to use a blender.  I like more rustic versions.

Very good! Only change I made was using fresh onions and vegetable broth instead of chicken. Very good for lunch to supplement a sandwich. Note: I only give 5 stars if the recipe is fabulous, this is very good!

i've never made soup & used this as a basis for the sort of soup i wanted to produce.  had nothing in the house so couldn't add carrots.  used minced garlic.  added some cumin to give it more flavour since i'm a veg so i didn't use chicken stock. also used my 'magic bullet' instead of a blender--i LOVE that thing1   def. very good stuff, people love it!

It was very creamy, hearty and yummy! Served with whole wheat soup rolls and my husband couldn't stop raving about it.  A great way to use up some carrots.

Tastes great and I really appreciate the healthiness factor of thickening by pureeing in the blender-a favorite trick of mine, instead of making a base with half and half and flour. Thanks!

I like anything that I can make in 1 pot (and I have an immersion mixer, so I didn't have to transfer half to the blender). I didn't have enough broth, so I had to use some water & I didn't have a lot of cheese so I don't know how much I used. Other than that, I left the recipe simple. It was easy to make, it was easy to eat, and it was much better than the last carrot soup recipe I tried. I should have cooked it a little bit longer because I like my carrots a little softer.

My daughter and I really enjoyed this with some warm biscuits after being outside on a cold rainy day.  I also prefer things "rustic" so I just mashed it by hand and added some extra water.  Also used fresh diced onion and garlic.  I think I'll double the recipe next time.
