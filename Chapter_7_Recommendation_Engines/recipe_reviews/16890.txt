Very easy, and a big hit at the party.  Browned the meatballs in a skillet, then dumped them and the sauce in a crockpot.

Made these for New Years Eve gathering.  Used frozen pre-cooked "homestyle" meatballs and a 2-1 ratio combo of KC Masterpiece and Hawaiian Sweet & Sour Sauce plus the preserves (Apricot-Pineapple was all I could find) specified in the recipe.  Was very much complimented by all so will make again, thanks!

These were good,but on the second batch,I decided to throw in a generous amount of garlic salt and worcestershire sauce.What a difference it made! I also didn't have pineapple preserves,so I substituted diced pineapples.Tasty,but I am still looking for an amazing recipe for cocktail meatballs!

These were a huge hit at my birthday gathering!  Not one of the quadrupled recipe was left.  I followed almost as directed but pineapple preserves are expensive in my parts.  So I added just a small amount of brown sugar & about a tsp. of pineapple juice to make up for some more sweet.  This is definately a keeper.

Other than using seasoned bread crumbs, I used the recipe as-is.  I would, however not suggest cooking the meatballs with the sauce as my was on the verge burning after 20 minutes.  I removed the meatballs from the oven and what sauce I could salvage and put them into the slow cooker.  Next time I will cook the meatballs and warm the sauce on the stove top where I can control the temperature better.

I've never been much of a fan of sweet & sour meatballs but wow, these are delicious.  Instead of the pineapple preserves I mixed KC Masterpiece with a bottle of sweet & sour sauce.

These were pretty yummy.  I made them and cooked them in the oven for 25 minutes on cookie sheets.  Then I added them to a slow cooker with the preserves and bbq sauce on low for 2 hours.  They turned out great.  Next time I might add about 3/4ths of a cup of water so the sauce isn't so thick.

I found this recipe about 2 years ago and have made them many times since.  I get a lot of requests for these!  I use my own meatloaf recipe and bake the meatballs in the oven then put the sauce over them in the slow cooker.  I have never found pineapple preserves but usually use the pineapple topping meant for ice cream topping.  Last time I used apricot-pineapple preserves and that seemed especially good.  Thanks for the recipe Lois!!

Fabulous! I think this would work better in a slow cooker but otherwise, the glaze itself is addictive. I used pineapple preserves and Baby Ray's. It's my nature to tweak recipes but I left this one alone except for the cooking method and we loved it. Thanks! :o)

I crunched up a bunch of seasoned toast to make the breadcrumbs, used a honey BBQ Sauce, and omitted the pineapple.

I'm not allowed to go to parties without these anymore.

I mixed 1 lb of lean beef with 1 lb of sweet italian sausage (and the other ingredient in the recipe).  I browned the meatballs in a skillet and then cooked them on high for 2 hours in the crockpot with the sauces.  I was unable to find pineapple preserves so I used 8 oz of duck sauce and 8 oz of sweet and sour and mixed that with a bottle of KC Sweet homestyle bbq sauce. These are excellent on rice and the next day I bought sub rolls and had meatball subs with cheese and ranch dressing.  VERY GOOD!

I tried this recipe 3 weeks ago and I am making it again tonight. I dont want to burn my family out, but this is one of those things you just have to make over and over. I used apricot/pineapple preserves because I could not find Pineapple preserves solo.

I made these for an appetizer party, they were great! I did make some changes though. I used 3/4 cup grape jelly instead of preserves, added 1/2 cup more bbq sauce, and used ground turkey.

These are great.  I added red pepper flakes to the bbq sauce mixture and used the pineapple apricot preserves.  I make a bunch and freeze the meatballs without the sauce and just make a little of the sauce at a time.  They always go first at a party and people rave about them.

I couldn't find the pineapple preserves and used orange marmalade instead.  They turned out very well and had a unique, sweet flavor.

I hesitate to review, since I substituted crushed, canned pineapple- the preserves are very expensive and rare here.  (I don't always like reviews where they have changed everything so much you can't recognize it) However, the meatballs turned out great, with a good flavor.  Slightly less sugar this way too.

These were a hit at our family dinner on Christmas night.  The crowd was huddled around them, and I could hear the words "awesome," "delicious," and "wonderful."  Will definitely make them again for the next gathering.

This is just actually a spin on regular meatloaf. It's OK, but I prefer my own tomato based glaze to this one.
I also added a little brown sugar to the BBQ sauce mixture.

I made this for my office holiday party and they were a hit! The sauce tastes fancier than it actually is to make. People loved it--especially all those people looking for "low-carb" options. I used my slow cooker to heat the sauce over the meatballs and once finished I put them in a foil tray for the party.  This is the type of dish that stays warm pretty well on its own.

This is a great recipe!  Super easy if you use frozen meatballs like I did :)  I baked the meatballs and cooked the sauce in a saucepan while they baked.  Then I set the meatballs on paper towels to get rid of a little grease.  I put everything in the crockpot on warm and served at our holiday potluck tonight.  They were a big hit!  The apricot-pineapple preserves were what I used.  I used 2 jars of the preserves, one small bottle of bbq sauce and about 3.5 lbs of meatballs.  Perfection!

Thes were very good! followed the recipe exactly. I have even used peach preserves when the local grocery store was out of pineapple. They also freeze well as is...then cook when thawed completely:)

I have used this recipe for years. However I use oregano instead of parsley and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  For the preserves I found it is best to use 1 jar apricot & 1 jar Peach preserves w your BBQ sauce. Put in Crock pot. I spice my sauce up with Peach schnapps (alcohol does cook out. But gives a good flavor). Bake the meat balls on a cook sheet in the oven. 350 degrees for 15 min turn & bake another 10-15 min. Until cooked.  Place in your crockpot w sauce. Let simmer. I have found that making a day ahead melds the flavors and is much better the next day. However if your house hold is like mine, nothing would be left.

Used ground pork instead of ground beef and they turned out PERFECT.  Loved the pork flavor with the pineapple.  This has become one of my BLOCKBUSTER HITS.  In fact, I've even put it in my personal cookbook and shared it with others.  Never fails that I get compliments on this recipe.

Great recipe!  I served it as a dinner with wild rice, green beans and a salad...big hit!  We like the sauce sweet so I increased the pineapple preserves to 2 full jars and used a honey bbq sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe quite often using grape jely instead of the pineapple.  I will have to try that.  This is wonderful for a party...they really go fast.

I've made this recipe twice in the last two weeks. The sauce is EXCELLENT! Double the recipe as it doesn't make nearly enough.
 
I'll be reducing the bread crumbs by 1/4 to 1/2 cup next time as the meatballs didn't turn out "meaty" enough; the texture made me think it tasted as though the ingredients were blended into paste. 

I found that apricot-pineapple preserves were better liked by all over the pineapple.

This was very good, gave the meatballs a nice flavor. I used dry parsley instead since I don't keep any fresh & I used pineapple juice instead of preserves since I didn't have any of that either. I'm sure the preserves would have been better & made it a bit thicker & sweet...but oh well this was good either way

The meatballs came out very flavorful and tender. These were a big hit for the superbowl. As with many folks, I didn't have access to pineapple preserves but a combination of apricot preserves and some sugar and vinegar rounded it out.

I tested them with a thermometer at 30minutes and they were done at 165F. 45 minutes would definitely overcook them. That might have been what happened to the person who reported that they were very tough. Another thing that could toughen them up is over mixing the meat mixture.

I would suggest a more savory and less sugary BBQ sauce because you'll already have plenty of sugar in the other ingredients (e.g., more Stibbs than Baby Ray)

Because I already had ready-made frozen meatballs on hand, I was mainly interested in making the sauce. I mixed BBQ sauce with puréed crushed pineapple (the canned variety) instead of pineapple preserves in the quantities  listed. I then put the meatballs and sauce in my mini crockpot on high till simmering then turned it to low and left it on low till company arrived. My meatballs and sauce was a huge hit! Will definitely make again!

The main star of this recipe is the sauce.  The sauce is definitely simple and delicious,  I used large cans of minced pineapple instead of the preserves. I also took the other reviewers' advice and added the sauce at the end in a crock pot for about an hour and a half, and I doubled the amount of sauce so that the meatballs could float in it and really absorb the flavor.

The crock pot actually saved my meatballs because they were rock hard and bland when I took them out of the oven, however they really softened up in the crock pot and took on the flavor of the sauce.  the meatballs themselves still didn't have the seasoning and flavor that I thought they would,  but the crock pot makes them so tender and the sauce was so good, it made up for the lack of flavor in the meatball itself,  and my husband loved them and even had seconds. I know that I changed the recipe and then didn't rate it high,  but had i not changed the recipe and not finished in the crockpot they would have really been bland and/ or the sauce would be burnt. ultimately I may take this sauce recipe and combine with another meatball recipe.

Baked meatballs in the oven.  Added minced garlic, grated parmesan, basil, oregano and used seasoned bread crumbs.  Used apricot preserves and Newman's Own barbeque sauce in 1:1 ratio.  Delicious, smoky, sour and sweet.

Made this for a party.   Big hit.  I added apricot/pineapple preserves and to make it sweeter I emulsified some crushed pineapple into it.  Added some spices and garlic to the meatballs. I roasted the meatballs in the oven then transferred to a baking dish and added the sauce that I simmered on the stove and popped back in the oven for about 10 minutes.  Next time might just add pineapple juice so the sauce stays smooth.   Hint:  when you start rolling out your meatballs, cook one in a fry pan to make sure you are happy with the taste.  ??

These turned out amazing. I did add about 5oz of Mascarpone cheese and a cup of milk to the mixture. I also used some granulated garlic to the meat. I substituted a pound of meatloaf mix ( beef pork and veal) along with a pound of low fat ground beef. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Hawaiian BBQ sauce along with apricot preserves. Will definitely make this again.

I use 1 lb hamburger and 1 lb sausage and then Apricot preserves give it a great taste and they are easy to find in the grocery store.  Also I bake the meatballs until they are almost done then pour sauce on them and then bake them again until fully cooked.  That way they don't get so tough.  SO GOOD!!

I thought the recipe was just OK, lacked something, but everyone else raved about them.   I think some sliced jalapeno may be just what this recipe needs.
