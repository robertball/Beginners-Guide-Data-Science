Thanks, this had a lot more flavor than it sounded like it would.  I used olive oil instead of coconut oil and used 1/2 c cashews.

Easy to prepare, but very boring flavor combination.

Loved it!!! Received 2 giant yellow squash and needed a recipe. I don't even know what paleo diet is, but I eat healthy. This was fantastic and will be a staple from now on. I did increase the coconut oil because I love it so and my squash were so big. But otherwise this recipe is perfect as it stands!!!

I made this side dish and I will be making it many more times. It was so easy and everyone enjoyed the dish.

I added a small yellow onion and cut the squash in circles not shredded. I believe the onions added even more flavor. The walnuts were a big hit with the family.

Was skeptical about how this would turn out, and I was pleasantly surprised. 5 star restaurant quality. Will make this again for sure.

I used summer squash and zucchini--it was a great side to my chicken.
