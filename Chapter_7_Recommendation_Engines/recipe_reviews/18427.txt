I would not use this recipe (as stated) for desserts.  The crust would be too salty for a dessert.  However, it would be great for a quiche.  If you decrease the salt by half and use a generous tablespoon of sugar (instead of only 2 tsp) - this is great!  Fortunately I tasted the dough before pressing it into the pan - and added enough extra sugar to still use it for my pecan pie.  Came out fantastic!    Since pecan pies typically bake for a long time, I didn't bother baking the crust and it came out cooked through after an hour and a half baking.  Rating four stars because  this produced a very simple and quick alternative to rolling out a pie crust - and if enough sugar is added, is very tasty!

I have avoided making pie crusts for many years because I could never get it right.  They were too much effort and always turned out tough.  But I gave this recipe a try and I am absolutely ecstatic to have found such an easy recipe that turned out so well!  It was tender, flaky and flavorful!  My crust was for a quiche and I used olive oil as another reviewer here suggested.  It turned out fantastic.  This is a keeper for sure and I am saying goodbye to Pillsbury crusts!  Thank you so much for a great recipe that will definitely save me time and money in the kitchen.

An update on my original review - I healthied this recipe up a bit by using 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour plus 1 cup of white flour and it turned out great.

FINALLY! A pie crust that works! I just found this recipe a couple of weeks ago and I've made it at least 10 times. I've used it as a cobbler crust, top and bottom layers of fruit pie, even cut up sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It's so so good! I do agree with past reviewers that if you're making a sweet dish, use only a pinch of salt and up the sugar quite a bit. If you're making a savory dish, like a quiche, leave the recipe as is or cut the salt just a bit. Otherwise, this recipe is IT!!!

AMAZING!  BEST PIE CRUST EVER...EASIEST PIE CRUST EVER...

I used olive oil and it turned out great, couldn't taste the olive flavor at all!  So much healthier than pie crusts full of butter and easier too :)

I had given up on making pies until now :)

Thank you Louise!

I was looking for a quick pie crust to make an instant cheesecake... This pie crust has got to be one of the best! It was wonderful. I, too, would decrease the salt a bit, as it was slightly salty. All in all, though, this pie crust is one of the best!

This was very easy and it tasted better than store-bought and frozen crust.  Will make again, but I won't pre-bake it this time- it came out a little burnt on the edges after I baked the filling in it.

I have used a similar recipe for years. My Mom and I went to a pie class and learned it. She never made pies because crust was difficult. She only uses this recipe now. I chill the oil first and then mix in the milk before I add to dry ingredients in pie pan.  For a double crust use  2 cups flour, 2 t. sugar and 1 t. salt. Increase oil to 2/3 cup and cold mile to 4T.  Save 1/3 cup of crust to crumble on top.  Fill with your favorite filling and top with crumbs.  Bake at 400 for 15 minutes and reduce to 350 for 30 - 40 more minutes.  I always get raves for my pie crust.

It was a great crust and so easy.  Before i read the directions, i got out a mixing bowl.  Then, WOW, no need for a mixing bowl.  Boy was i happy; one less dish to clean.  I think that for fruit pies, i might add a little more sugar.  but for all others, it was great.

I used this recipe because I didn't have any butter or shortening, and I was amazed at the crust I got. It has a crisp crumbly texture. I have used it for custard pies as well as beef pot pies.

Wow, it was easy for sure, and I even made two batches of it but gosh it was really grainy/sandy in texture. There was a bit of an oily taste as mentioned by other reviewers -- I made one batch with veg oil and one with olive oil -- the olive was probably the least successful in terms of taste.  This is a fine recipe when you're in a pinch but when I have the luxury of time and a special recipe, I would go for a real crust.  That said, my husband and son didn't mind it at all for my homemade pot pies.  (For the tops, I pressed the dough into rounds on WAXED PAPER and then picked it up and turned it onto the pie - very easy.)

Great pie crust, worked perfectly for me. Any ideas how to turn it into a double crust? I am going to try to do on plastic wrap in the pie plate, pull it out and add it to the top, I will let you know how it works. Any other ideas in case this one doesn't work?
**EDIT** I used plastic wrap in the pie pan first, made the dough and removed it. Then, I made it in the tin without the plastic wrap, baked it for only 5 minutes. I put apple pie filling inside, laid the top crust on the pie and baked it to make a perfect crust. I also used 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. It was the easiest pie I have ever made.

I love this recipe I use it all the time, but there are a few thing I've discovered that make it a lot better, first it needs 1/4 cup milk, more sugar to taste and I use olive oil instead of regular. I also toss in cinnamon just because, I love the stuff.

What an amazingly fast and easy way to make pie crust! I have found that traditional pie crusts have to be handled so carefully (don't overwork them or they become tough!), and can be time-consuming. This one is made right in the pie plate so there is no clean up required! Mine had a slightly different texture than normal pastry crust, as it was more crumbly and cookie-like (my husband thought it was like shortbread). It held up very well for my lemon meringue pie. After reading the reviews I added an additional tablespoon of sugar to the recipe. Now that I have an easier, faster way to make pie crust that is also healthier (no shortening!), I'm going to be making a lot more pies!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I am an avid baker but have never attempted homemade pie crust. This was absolutely perfect. I didn't change it & it was so surprisingly flaky. perfect for any kind of pie.

This is an amazing pie crust as is for meat pies. When making a sweet pie, bump the sugar up to 2 - 3 tbsp and drop the salt to 1/4 tsp.  

Thanks!

This is a GREAT easy pie crust.  I admit that if I see a recipe where I have to cut in cold butter until it resembles course crumbs, I just run the other way. I shouldn't, but I do.  Therefore, I always bought pie crusts (shhhhh).  But this recipe has set me free! I used this this week to make 2 quiche crusts on a whim, and it was SO EASY and good. I literally didn't change a thing, but yes I can imagine you might want to half the salt and double the sugar if you were doing a sweet pie.  Otherwise, don't mess with it, its perfect.

I used this with the Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie recipe on this site.  It was pretty good.  It was so easy!!!  It did fall apart a little bit, but the ease made up for it.  I used 1 Tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tsp salt.  I think this would be perfect for quiche.  But for anything dessert related, it would definitely need more sugar/less salt.  I have never made a pie crust before from scratch, so I was disappointed the directions didn't explain what it meant by "holes".  I had to look it up (just use a fork to poke a bunch of holes about 1/4 inch apart so that the pre-baking crust can let steam out.)

This was fantastic and turned out perfectly.  I used the crust to cover a pot pie casserole.  I know you don't need to roll it out, but it since it was a topper, i tried it.  it rolled out perfectly and was very easy to transfer.  absolutely great.  i also didn't have any vegetable oil, so i substituted half a cup of melted, unsalted butter and everything still turned out beautiful.  i especially love that the recipe doesn't call for eggs!!!  this recipe is an absolute keeper.  thanks for sharing!

Great, easy pie crust recipe! Thank you so much. If the "experts" ranking you down because it's not a "desert" crust; you'd think they'd know enough to leave out the salt.  LOL  I'm just saying.......  Thanks for posting this!

Very good!  I made this in a pinch for a quiche when I realized I didnt have any store-bought pie crusts in the freezer. It was so simple to make and turned out fantastic!  I baked it without any filling for about 10 minutes prior to putting the quiche filling in. It set up beautifully and was so tender and flaky. A keeper!

After a day of baking for a party, I was NOT in the mood to prepare another pie crust. I took a gamble on this one, not expecting it to turn out very well--I should have gone with my instinct. It was so greasy that I had to literally soak up the excess pools of grease with paper towels before sticking it in the oven. Even so, it was quick and easy, and came out perfectly flaky and I was optimistic--till I tasted it. I did not care for it at all. It ruined an entire custard pie, and I ended up having to scoop the custard out into a dish to eat alone. I have learned my lesson...I will never cut corners again. The extra time put into making a traditional pie crust is worth it.

I'm so glad I found this recipe, it turned out great!  It was hard to believe that I could make a great tasting pie crust without having to roll it out, but trust me it was amazing.  I only added a pinch of salt and after reading another review I added a heaping tablespoon of sugar instead of the 2 teaspoons it called for.

I LOVE this recipe. To make it even better and more versatile, I omitted the salt. I've used it with everything from pumpkin pie to quiche!

this is my first oil-crust.
i had grave misgivings looking at the oily lump of dough in my pie pan. as i smooshed it towards the edges of the pan all i could think was "over-worked brick!" then it emerged from the oven as a gloriously tender shortbread crust!!! i made it as directed -i was using it for leek & cheese pie, so the thought of salt didn't bother me. i actually used lawry's seasoned salt, as all else i had was very corse crystaled sea salt. when i tasted a crumble of the edge before filling it tasted sweet enough to me to use on a sweet filling pie -i don't know if this is a factor, but i always add a dash of lawry's to any brown sugar and spice topping destined for sweet potatoes, squash, etc. (try this sometime ! it's so perfect :)

So so easy and such little mess! Made it 3x in 2 weeks for quiche. Salty, good with quiche, maybe add less salt for fruit pies, etc. Wonderful, thank you!

This gets a five for being so easy AND yummy.  I do reduce the sugar though since I use it for quiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never reviewed a recipe from this site even though I've used a ton of them before. I am 67 years old and finally prepared a pie yesterday that was absolutely terrific! My mom could make the best piecrust with her eyes closed, but I never was able to come close. Now I'm planning to make all sorts of pies and quiches.
By the way, this recipe worked in my 10" pyrex pie plate and I did not pre-bake before filling with pumpkin.

I could hardly believe this recipe would work! I've made oil crust before, but always rolled it out between waxed paper. My crust was perfect and pretty too! I guess for a fruit pie with a top crust one would still have to double the recipe and roll out the second half, but this is perfect for those pumpkin or custard pies! I DID however, half the salt and use a tablespoon sugar for my pumpkin pie crust.

This recipe is very easy, and I like the one-dish simplicity. However, I reduced the salt by half and it still tasted salty to me. I used it for a quiche, and don't recommend it for this purpose. It didn't hold up well to twice-baking. I may try to revise it for once-baking purposes, like pudding pies. *Blend very well*, which may prevent the massive crumbling problem I had.

This is a great pie crust, but I would reduce the amount of salt to half the stated amount and add a little butter because it can get a little too crumbly.

Loved this crust!!! So yummy and flaky!!! Better for meat pies, etc. as is, but I was making apple pie, so I will leave the salt out next time, as it was really noticeable to me. Overall the best crust I have tried making from scratch yet! (and SOOOOO EASY!!!!) I won't be buying boxed or ready made again!

Loved this crust.  I will never go through the trouble of rolling out a crust again.  I found that the thinner you make this crust, the better and flakier it is.  Thanks for a great, EASY recipe!

I must admit, I was skeptical at first-I always make my pie crust with crisco shortening, but am always looking to cut back on fats, so I decided to give this a try.  I followed the recipe exactly-made one in the pie plate and one in a bowl for a top crust.  The top crust was rolled out just like I would a top pie crust-I made the meat pie (Tourtiere) from Maggie Rogers on this site and my hubby loved it--he never noticed any difference in the pie crust.  It was flaky and had a great flavor to it.  I'm so glad that I found this recipe-now I won't feel guilty when I make chicken pot pie and Tourtiere--thanks Louise!!!  This one's a keeper!

I chose to make this recipe because I didn't have any shortening.  Now, I will make it even if I do!  It was the easiest crust recipe I have ever made, and it was THE BEST tasting!  Thank you to the person who submitted it.

I tried this out of desperation after I had mixed up a bowl of stuff for a pot pie and realized I didn't have any pie crusts.  It was perfect- and so easy.  I didn't find it too salty as other reviewers did, I think the salt in it would probably give a good counterbalance to a sweeter pie also (like pecan or a cream pie) and I plan to try it with one of those in the future.

I just made this crust for a pumpkin pie and it worked beautifully.  After what others said, I cut the salt to one-half tsp. and increased the sugar to 1 tablespoon.  I pressed it into a glass pie dish, filled the dish with my pumpkin mixture, and baked it for 50 minutes.  The pie was awesome, so this crust also works well for fillings that call for an unbaked pie shell.

Very easy to make! I used my kitchenaid mixer and it was very simple and much cleaner than other recipes I've used. 

I used this recipe to make a quiche and I didn't care for the sweetness, so next time I would omit the sugar.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have all-purpose flour so I used half wheat and better for bread flour; didn't have vegetable oil so I use olive oil; use soymilk instead of milk... my chicken pot pie turned out flaky and delicious... my family love it!

I will never make traditional pie crust again! This was so easy to make and tasted great! I use it for apple pie and I always decrease the salt to 1/4 tsp. and up the sugar to 2 tablespoons. I prebake for 10 minutes and cover the edges with foil during the full pie baking if they brown too quickly. Great recipe!

I recently decided to actually read the ingredients in those pre-made pie crusts -- then resolved that from now on I would be homemaking them, thinking I was in for hours of complicated work (sure to result in rare crust-required dishes to be made...) Then I found this recipe!  I have made this twice, once for a quiche -- recipe exactly as is, except using white whole-wheat flour.  Fantastic!  I can see where people are coming from with the salty comments, it is a little salty though I like that.  You could reduce it if you don't like salty food.  The second time I made this for an apple pie - I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and increased the sugar to 2 Tbsp, and again used white whole-wheat flour.  It turned out great and simply couldn't be easier. It is flaky and delicious. I did not par-cook in either case, though with the pie I did cook it in a glass pie dish sitting on top of a baking stone.  I often will not even eat the crust because I am all about the fillings, but with this I find myself eating every last crumble!  Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

I was surprised that anyone would add an entire teaspoon of salt when trying this recipe. I put just a dash of salt, increased the sugar alittle and used 50% shorting and 50% butter. Good easy recipe that I would certainly recommend.

I made this with olive oil because I was using it for a quiche, I found it to be a bit too oily, but my friends LOVED the quiche and I will definitely use this recipe again with canola oil- making this crust was faster and easier than driving to the store and buying one already made.

I put all my ingredients on the pie plate I was using, mixed them in there, and pressed the crust to the sides of the pan-simple and clean looking. Mine was a little greasy...Much easier than shortening crusts, but I think shortening is worth the extra effort....flakier crust, definitely.

Great and easy crust. Doesn't have the rich butteriness of a butter crust, but it's perfect for savory dishes. If you make a sweet dish, cut the salt and add more sugar.

Very difficult dough to roll, I ended up having to pat it into place.  While the texture was good, the taste was not.  Maybe it was due to using a low grade oil, but it tasted just like the oil.  I'll go back to using a pie crust w/ 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, that seems to always get the best results.

This was so good and so easy! I will never buy another pre-made pie crust again! I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the salt and increased the sugar since it was for a pie. You can taste and go from there depending on what you are making. As is it would be awesome for a pot pie!

This just did not taste good to me...even though I added more sugar the vegetable oil taste was overwhelming...like swallowing a tsp of oil w/ a little flour in it.  On the plus side it is super easy and looks good.  I had high hopes...but they were not fulfilled.

I'm giving this 5 stars with the following modifications: for a dessert pie, you need to use way less salt (1/4 tsp.) and 1 T. sugar.  It was flaky and absolutely delicious.  I got many compliments on this pie crust (I made "Banana Cream Pie I" from this site)

This is the easiest pie crust I've ever made and it takes just as good or even better.  I really prefer using oil since it's better for you than shortening.  The only downside to this crust is that you can't use it as a top pie crust because it won't hold together if you try to roll it out.

I made this yesterday, and following the suggestions other people made about the salt, I cut it in half.  Also, I used my hands instead of a fork to mix it, it was just easier (although, messier!)  It could not have been more perfect.  I had three people over for dinner, and between the 7 of us, not one of us didn't like the crust.  One of my friends said, "I am not a pie person, but I'd totally eat this again!"

I shared three pieces (I made two pies) with my neighbors, and they loved it, too!

I highly recommend this recipe.  I used this crust with two other recipes from this site:  Aunt Bev's famous apple pie, and Strawberry/Rhubarb crumb pie.  I used the apple pie filling recipe and the crumb topping recipe.  I don't think I've ever had a more perfect apple pie!  Thank you!

I used this crust with the crab quiche recipe and it was great.  I modifyed the recipe a little by substituting 1/2 the all purpose flour with whole wheat and it was wonderful.

I love this recipe. It is so easy. I made it for a pot pie, so I used less sugar. I have never made any kind of pie or pie crust before, and this one came out great. Thanks so much.

I do alot of baking but gave up on making my own crust years ago for sake of convenience.  This crust was super easy and really good (surprisingly light and flakey!).  I used it for a pumpkin pie and it was delicious!  I will never buy frozen crust again!

I *hate* shortening. And I have never been able to make good pie crusts using the chilled butter method ... and the frozen flaky pastry isn't quite right for custard pies ... so when I found this ... I just gotta try it. Awesome! It's so easy and good. No need to blind bake too. Just bake it. Only thing it is a little salty.

I've had this recipe for years, since I was a little girl. It may not flake exactly like a rolled crust, but it's a suitable quick-and-easy substitute. It's sweeter flavor makes it perfect for glazed fresh fruit pies, like fresh strawberry. So easy that you'll whip up all sorts of one-crust pies, like custard and chocolate cream, for everyday desserts. Use a hardier crust (like one with egg) for pot pies and the typical French crust for baked fruit pies.

This was the worst pie crust I ever tasted. Sure is was the easiest I ever made, but sometimes you got to do a little work for something good. The texture was awful, nothing but crumbly. And the flavor was bland, bland, bland.

This recipe is wonderful because it's so *simple*.  While the result isn't as good as the traditional methood, it still beats any frozen crust.  I'd definately make this again, except next time add just a little less salt.

I agree with other comments, there are better crusts out there. But I am going to keep this recipe as well, because of course they are not made with oil, and this is definitely a plus! moreover, it is not messy at all: if you really want to keep it to a minimum effort, you don't need a bowl and a rolling pin either. I mean to try it again, making the kitchen robot do all the work; I think it will be more "smooth" and perhaps less sandy and grainy... also, if you plan to use this for a sweet pie, be careful of the amount of salt (I happened to use it on my first try with a caramel filling, and it was fortunate, I declared that I had a "caramel au burre salè" French pie in mind from the beginning, but it was so untrue!

Definitely easy to make. I was using it for a pumpkin pie, and so I followed other user suggestions and cut the salt and upped the sugar. HOWEVER, I still had the taste of vegetable oil in my mouth for five minutes after finishing my slice of pie. If you're using it for something sweet, I would definitely suggest using melted butter as your lipid instead. It would make for a much more savory, less gross aftertasting dessert.

Thank god for this quick and easy pie crust. I was preparing a banana cream pie last night and I made a huge mistake with the pre-made pie crust that I was using... I PUT PAM IN THE PIE DISH! OH NO! Never, ever do that folks. It'll pull away from the dish and make a nice crumbly fried tortilla looking thing. Ha. Anyway, there I was with banana cream filling and no pie crust, so I came online and found this life saver. I did take the recommendation of another reviewer who suggested the use of more sugar and less salt for more desserty foods and it turned out great. I will definitely use this recipe if I ever need a quick and easy pie crust.

This was my first time ever making any type of crust. I needed a crust for a mini quiche and this was excellent. Easy and fast. I used whole wheat flour and coconut milk and it turned out excellent. I didn't have to cook the whole 15 minutes (probably because of the whole wheat flour), and next time I probably won't precook it, but otherwise, excellent recipe. Who knew pie crust could be so easy?

Easiest crust ever, and absolutely delicious for chicken pot pie. I followed one reviewer's advice and covered the bottom of the pan with saran wrap so I could easily flip it over to make the top crust, and let it bake with the filling inside. (Still pre-cooked the bottom crust.)

There's something unpleasant about the way it crumbles in your mouth,kinda like crumbs. Plus after many bites the taste becomes not that good,perhaps it's a little too savoury.

Almost exactly the pie crust in the pie plate recipe a friend gave me years ago.  I finally got the guts to try it and now it is all I ever use.  Obviously could not be used as an upper crust, but I haven't faced that situation yet!!  My daughter, who is not into baking, wanted to make the pumpkin pie from scratch this last Thanksgiving and did the crust without a hitch.  It is SO easy.

Used this recipe because I needed one that was quick and easy for a pot pie.  It is different, but I loved it!  I pressed the top crust between plastic wrap and turned it over onto the filled crust.  I will definately use it again.

It sufficed for the turkey pot pie I was making. I used this for the bottom crust as I only had one crust prepared and needed two.  The end result was very crumbly.  I would not use this recipe again.  However, I am giving two stars simply for the ease of the recipe.

I used this for a pie so I upped the sugar a little bit, since I found it called for it on a sweet. If it was for a quiche or something salty it would be perfect. That being said, it was great, the sides were very crunchy and it was flaky... plus, it is really easy to make! Will be using this recipe again, both for deserts and other dishes! Very good!

We really appreciate this simple recipe for a light and flaky crust.  My little girls make the pie crust for me while I prepare the fillings.  We tried this recipe for pumpkin pie but feel it is better suited to savory dishes in the long run.  With some adjustment to salt/sugar, we were able to still make some good pumpkin pies.  Thanks!

I was short on time and needed a quick and easy pie crust.  I looked up Easy Pie Crust on AR and this came up. Yeah!  I took others advice and lowered the salt and added 4 tsp of sugar because I was making a custard pie. I was pleasantly suprised that this crust was flakey and tasted suprisingly good.  I have already passed this on to my mother who is skeptical but willing to try it.  I can't wait to hear from her. I only gave it 4 stars because it just barely made a pie crust big enough to use on an 8 inch pie plate.

I've tried several variations on this now.  All of them taste delicious.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I think it's actually easier to make a pie crust with butter.  The oil gets pretty messy.  However, I think it's worth it for how much healthier this way is.

I used this recipe to make a crust for an apple pie.  As others suggested, I decreased the salt and added sugar.  In the end all that I can say is, I don't know which was worse, the flavor or the texture.  This crust really tasted like vegetable oil and crumbled to bits when the pie was served.  I could see this working for a quiche, maybe.  For fruit pies, I would sooner use a store bought crust than make this again.

I was making a vegan pie and used liquid coconut oil. Also halved the recipe. Added some maple syrup for additional liquid because it was really crumbly. It's in the oven now but the raw dough tastes like a cookie so I think it's going to be great!

This was super easy, I will definitely use this recipe again just for how easy it all comes together. I cut the salt in half and used 1/2 vegetable oil and 1/2 olive oil. I used this for a quiche, I don't think I would like it as a pie crust, not sweet enough and oil came through a bit more than I'd like, I will probably reduce the oil next time I make this recipe.

In spite of all the good reviews here, I was skeptical about this recipe. Now I am no longer a skeptic! This is a very good pie crust, especially considering how easy it is to make. I used it for a peach pie and reduced the salt to just a quarter teaspoon and added extra sugar as recommended here. It looked like an oily mess going into the oven but came out great. I did find that it is skimpy for a 9" crust and I also had a hard time getting it evenly spread in the pan. Be sure to bake the crust without the filling first, then fill and bake as instructed in your recipe. I was very pleased with the result, although it isn't as good as a standard pie crust. It's very close, though!

Made it for a sweet pie so made it with just less than 1/4c sugar.  Instead of using oil I used melted butter so got that buttery taste without bringing the food processor out :). Could tell it wasn't regular flaky pastry but YUM nonetheless.

I loved this crust. It was easy, flaky, and tasty. I did follow a previous reviewers' suggestion about reducing the salt. I cut the salt down to 1/8tsp. Thanks for the easiest pie crust I've ever tried!

I have been looking for a really good AND easy pie crust recipe for years, & this has got to be the best one out there. Decrease the salt to just a dash, the flour to 1 1/4 cups, and the oil to a little less than the 1/2 cup called for, and you can't go wrong. Also, the secret seems to be to make sure you flatten the crust out so it's not too thick. I had left over dough when I made it because I didn't want the thick, shortbread consistency others had complained about. Mine turned out flaky & not too crumbly at all.  I will never use the pre-made refrigerated crusts again--it is actually easier & quicker just to make my own with this recipe. Highly recommend this recipe.

Really great and I love how you dont have to roll it or get lots of counterspace and dishes messy!! When I made mine the dough was very tough so it was hard to press into the pan without being lumpy in some areas and not in others but it still tasted great and slipped right out of the pan when it was done!!

This was wonderful and easy!  I used it as a top to an apple pie!  I mixed the ingredients in a bowl and then rolled it on the counter and cut strips to make a lattice top for an apple pie!  It was flaky and tender!  Very good!

A cinch to make. You do not need to roll the crust; just pound it in! I made the mistake of using extra-virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used less than 1/2 c. but the taste of olives was still WAYY too overpowering. Next time, vegetable oil it is.

If you are doubling the recipe, make sure not to double the amount of salt. I did, and the crust turned out too salty for a sweet pie. Otherwise, this recipe was really easy and looked wonderful.

I used this crust for chicken pot pie. Super simple and easy even for a dodo like me. I also excluded the sugar since I was using it for the pot pie.

This crust was very fast and easy to make.  No mess!  I liked being able to mix it in the pie dish and press it in from there.  I didn't care for the flavor at all, though.  Don't try to roll this pie crust out; the consistency is very crumbly, and it just isn't meant to be rolled.

I would really give this pie crust a five for ease and a four for taste, but I think that with a little bit of adjusting of the sugar and salt the taste can get even better.  This crust took me about two minutes flat to make and put in the pan. Next time I will try to make it sweeter even though it was for a salty recipe.  Also be careful not to spread it too thick on the bottom of the pan as you don;t want it to overwhelm what you are making.

Awesome! So easy and turned out tasting great. I never tried making a crust before because I thought it would be hard to do. So glad I found this recipe. Now I'll never have to worry about having a pie shell handy! If you're going to do a deep dish pie though, I would do 1 1/2 times the recipe.

I used raw sugar and sea salt so I cut back just a pinch on both of those since they're a little more intense.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly for Sunday morning quiche.  I had to stop myself from nibbling on the crust before I filled it!  I used a glass pie pan since that's what I have and kept the temps. the same so it might've been a little more cooked before I filled it.  This crust stayed dry and "fluffy" under a quiche which I've never experienced with store-bought crusts.  This one's the one that works for me - thank you!

This was the easiest pie crust ever! I always hated making crust before because of all the rolling and chilling it took and they never really seemed to turn out, but this one was fantastic.  Even my picky husband loved this one. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

I've made this pie crust about a dozen times now and everyone loves it.  I'm not usually a big fan of the taste of pie crust but this one is different.  It's a bit sweeter and very yummy.  Not to mention, it is soooo easy to make.  Though, I did make one change to the recipe right from the beginning.  As I don't often use much salt in my cooking, I cut the salt in half.  In my opinion, it doesn't need the extra salt.

This is a great pie crust! I have been using with my coconut pie recipe and its a great combination. The consistency has turned out perfect each time and the taste is superb- so much better than a frozen pie crust, and cheaper. I am wondering if some of the people who had problems didnt measure the ingredients correctly. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Great crust.  I will be using it often as I don't do pie crusts well, and it will be cheaper than buying frozen ones.  I will be decreasing the salt, and probably the oil.  It was flaky, though, and a no hastle at all.  Thanks!

I use to hate making pies until I found this recipe, and now pies are not a problem.  I don't pre-bake it. I usually make apple pies and then just freeze the pie unbaked.  Put in pre heated oven frozen and what a delicious pie.
Thank you so much for making my life easier.

The pie crust was not a pie crust. It turned out as a crumbly mess.  It didn't cook and when it did it cooked very quickly and burnt. I would not recommend making this pie crust.

This was a perfect pie crust for a pumpkin pie! This year I was single-handedly cooking a Thanksgiving meal for 17 people, and I tried to "cheat" and use a store-bought graham cracker crust for my pumpkin pie. That crust fell apart the second I opened it, and with no time to go to the store, I had to find an emergency recipe with ingredients I already had in my kitchen! This was perfect for what I needed it for. I followed a tip from another reviewer and modified it to 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It was great. However, it would be impossible to use if you need to put a top layer of crust on your pie.

The only thing I didn't make from scratch was pie crust. That ended when I found this recipe. I add a little cinnamon and my sweet potato pie was DELICIOUS. I'll never buy frozen crust again.

My first time ever making pie crust. I used it in a chicken pot pie recipe. Very easy to make, but a little salty. I think next time I will cut the salt in half.

I used gluten-free all-purpose flour mix (Bob's Red Mill).  And this was FANTASTIC!  It turned out like a shortbread crust, a little crumbly and flaky...PERFECT DESSERT CRUST! or for any type of pie, for that matter!

The crust turned out crumbly and sandy with a greasy off taste. If you're really tight on time and/or ingredients, I think it would be fine in a strong tasting pie, like a fruit pie or a pot pie or something. I used it for a light egg custard pie, and the weird crust taste was very prominent. The only change I made to the recipe was to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp since I was making a sweet pie.

This is a good recipe but way to much salt, I decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp and added a 1/2 tsp vanilla to give the crust a richer flavor.

I made this crust yesterday to make a turkey pot pie. It was the first time I have ever made a pie crust and it turned out great. It was a nice flakey crust. I did a double batch. But it had a great texture and taste. Definately will use this recipe next time as well!

I've always enjoyed making pies but hate making pie crust. Decided to search for a easier more consistent crust recipe when I found this one. I first used this recipe for a chicken pot pie. I pressed the bottom as  specified and using some of the dough I had separated out I simply pressed it between saran wrap to make the top crust. So easy and tasty. I have shared this recipe with my daughter and she was impressed with it as well. A Winner Recipe...thanks for sharing.

Not only was this the best pie crust I ever made, but it was the easiest!  This recipe is genius! I substituted half & half for milk because that's what I had on hand.  It complimented my pumpkin pie perfectly.  The crust's saltiness balanced out the pie's sweetness.  I loved it.  And the flakiness?  Oh my gosh, I never managed to get a pie crust this flaky in my life.  I used to think that texture was reserved for shortening only, and I refuse to use shortening.  I thought I'd never produce something like this out of my kitchen. I am so excited.  So excited, I had to join this site to make my first comment! Finally! A crust I absolutely love and... remarkably, one that doesn't require freezing and cutting and fussing... oh my...  THANK YOU for posting this.

Normally I use frozen pie crusts by Tenderflake.  I didn't have any in the freezer so searched for an easy recipe. I just made this pie crust for pumpkin pie.  I did not change anything in the recipe.  I poured the pie batter into the crust uncooked and followed the cooking instructions for the pie - 15 minutes at 425 and 35 minutes at 350.  I have been making pumpkin pies for over 20 years because my children love them.  My 9 year old son just told me that this crust was amazing.  It doesn't need any extra sugar or less salt, just perfect as is.  I uploaded a picture of the filled pie shell.

I tryed this recipe to do a pie and I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 and 2 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar instead of 2. I though it would be better for a dessert, and it was delicious. It is very sticky, so if you are planning to do a top to your pie, you should put half the amount of vegetable oil and an egg (only for the top), I did that and it was wonderful.

Perfect!  This was my first time making pie crust from scratch and it was so easy and delicious - plus it's made with ingredients I already had around the house.  It has a traditional pie crust flavor and texture.  I made 2 batches so I could drape lattice over the top.

Great easy recipe! I used it for a healthy quiche so I left the sugar out entirely and only put in 1/2 tsp of salt. I also substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour, which gave it a nice nutty flavor and a bit more fiber! I will definitely use this recipe when I don't feel like using butter. 

I gave it four stars because my crust was sandy rather than the flaky that I prefer (probably because of my whole wheat addition) and because I simply prefer the flavor and texture of a butter crust. No complaints here, though.

I followed the recipe, omitting the sugar since I was making quiche & not a sweet pie, but it was really just okay. It wasn't flaky, but I kind of knew it wouldn't be since it wasn't with butter. Instead it ended up being kind of dry & really crumbly. It works in a pinch if you don't have the ingredients for a flaky crust, but definitely not a favorite.

Just as the three stars suggest, this recipe was 'okay'. I really wasn't a fan of the oil smell/taste, or the texture.  It really didn't hold together well at all, very crumbly.  I used this crust with a coconut meringue pie, and so added a T. of sugar and halfed the salt.  I wish I would of added more sugar and even less salt.  It is a very simple and no-mess recipe.  I'll probably play with the ingredients a bit in the future to see if I can get something that works a bit better. I'm thinking I'll use melted butter instead of oil, very little salt, and quite a bit more sugar.

I needed a premade pie crust for a recipe with a chocolate filling. After I broke the one I bought I panicked and found this recipe. It was so easy and the texture so great! It really was too salty for a dessert recipe, although everyone said it worked well with the chocolate. In the future I'll probably add a dash of salt and keep the rest of the recipe the same. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Flaky! Easy! Takes no time to make or to bake. Great when baked with the filling or when blind baked. Easiest clean-up.
Compared to other crusts using butter, this is practically no work at all, and just as tasty.
I only used 1/4 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp sugar, mixing them with the milk first (inside the pie dish) to allow the sugar to start dissolving so that it doesn't have a too grainy texture.

I don't usually comment on recipes, but this one really impressed me. I tried it last night when I discovered I had more pumpkin pie filling than frozen pie crusts. I used to love baking pies, but I could never make a good crust so I gave it up. I didn't expect to have any more success with this recipe. Wrong! This crust is amazing. It's light, flaky, and tender with about 10% the work that most such crusts require. If it worked this well for me, it will work for anyone.

I've relied on this recipe year after year when needing a quick, no fuss crust for holiday pies (saves time when so busy with so many other menu items for Thanksgiving). It isn't the most flavorful or flaky, in fact, it can be a little grainy. Don't let that discourage you from trying it. Because, still, it's simple and let's the pie ingredients and toppings be the hero. So I consider it more of a practical base for my pies, not a component of the pie I expect guests to comment/compliment on.

Fast and easy. I was happy to find a recipe that used oil an could be prepared in the baking dish just like my Mom makes her crusts. Made a double batch in a 9x13 pan. Required longer to bake. Turns out a bit crumbly but will likely use it again as it is so easy.

Perfect for a quiche! This is the first and only pie crust I've made.  It was quick and easy for a novice such as myself.  I agree it it is better for savory dishes versus sweet desserts, but I'm sure it would be easy to adjust. The first time I made it with whole wheat flour and it wasn't my favorite.  We are trying to eat healthier but this really is better with regular white flour.

I was looking for a quick crust to put a frozen batch of homemade chicken pot pie filling in to feed surprise company and it ruined my pot pie. Neither myself, nor my husband (he will eat anything) could choke down more than a couple of bites. I should have known better than to make a pie crust with oil. Also who uses that much salt in anything? Next time I will wait and make chicken pot pie for guests when I have enough time to prepare a real crust!

Super easy and turned out great.  Was the first time I've ever made a crust of any kind.  I made a Quiche (also first time) and it was so good I couldn't stop eating it, I almost ate the whole 9 inches!

I also customized this with a pinch less salt and a tad more sugar.  Used it for pumpkin pie this Turkey Day and it was a hit.

Glad I found this recipe. Easy and PERFECT! A little salty though but the texture was great! it's flaky and tastes way better than the ones I buy at the market.

Whoa! This is the first pie crust I've ever made. I chose it because there was no waiting time like there were with other recipes. It was still as flaky and delicious as other crusts I've tasted. It took 2 minutes to whip up and complemented the apple pie i made with it perfectly. I cut the amount of salt in half per other reviews and it had the perfect level of saltiness. I would definitely recommend reducing the amount.

I didn't think this would work-IT DID! The crust turned out flaky and tender. It had a nice subtle flavor.  I was making a sweet hubbard squash pie, I added just a pinch of salt so it was not too salty.

I haven't tasted this yet but gave it 5 stars based on the ease of making. I made mine for a savory dish so i did add the salt and the sugar. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and half teaspoon of basil just to give it more flavor. I made a chicken pot pie and it smells heavenly. Will edit once I taste my dish.

LOVE this crust! So amazingly simple. I've used this a couple times for quiche while trying to keep up with all my fresh garden veggies. I agree that the salt and sugar should be adjusted. I made it per the recipe the first time, and both the salt and sugar were too noticeable. I reduced both the next time by half, and it was perfect.

this was so, so easy to do and i paired it with a lemon meringue pie recipe. the taste was fantastic too. the only problem was that it was too crumbly because the crust started to fall off in bits and pieces after it had been baked with the meringue... maybe i won't bake it so long (for the first round) in future.

I found this recipe strange at first due to the fact that it didn't require any butter, but I guess that's a good thing :_) I also found it easier to mix it all together before putting it in the pie pan. We popped it in the oven for 15 and it came out perfect for our homemade keesh...would use less salt though for a dessert recipe and add more sugar. This was fast and easy, love it!!

Easy & delicious. However, it's a little shy of filling a normal pie plate. I'd use 2 c. flour and adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  Don't try rolling this out to use as a pie top crust. Doesn't hold up to rolling out.

Easy and great! I used this for a pie and a quiche last night. As reviewers recommended, I left out the salt and added a little more sugar for the pie, and used the original recipe for the quiche. They were both perfect and delicious! Thanks!!

Easy crust that flakes pretty well but doesn't have great flavor.  We use this recipe often for sweet pies that have a lot of flavor but I am still looking for a better pie crust recipe for pot pies.

I do a lot of cooking and am very comfortable in my kitchen but I did not care for this recipe.  I only tried it cuz I didn't have time to do a "real" pie crust and didn't have any frozen on hand. Save your time and ingredients for another.

Very grainy, salty and just not what you expect a pie crust to be. Normally I make my crust from scratch just thought I would try this because of reviews and quick factor I will never try again. I'm not trying to be mean just honest this is the first recipe I've tried on here that had such high reviews and turned out so bad :(

This was so easy.  I haven't made a homemade piecrust since junior high school ( that was a long time ago).  I had pulled a freezer piecrust out and it smelled funny after thawing, so had to scramble for a crust for a quiche.  I didn't have crisco in the house to make a traditional crust and I hate to roll out the crust, so found this one.  So easy and it was really flaky.  Won't be buying frozen crust anymore.

This was the perfect pie crust.  It was flaky, and tasted great - almost buttery!  The best part?  Amazingly easy, and used ingredients I usually have on hand.  I agree with other reviewers that the recipe as-is is best for savory dishes, but with that knowledge in mind, it's easy to adjust the recipe for desserts.  I'm pretty sure this recipe just earned a permanent place in my kitchen!

This pie crust is ok, but in my opinion is just a bit saltyy. I also thought it was difficult to spread as it is very doughy and make a top pie crust. However, I did like the flaky texture.

I got this recipe from my 85 year old mother-in-law over 25 years ago. the name has changed from E Z to easy and one ingredient is different. It should have a Tablespoon of sugar instead of 2 tsp. I have used this recipe over and over and it is not too salty for sweet pie, as one lady suggested. I am glad to see it on the web now. Esther

I highly recommend this recipe! Like others have said it shouldn't be used for a dessert, but I used it for quiche and it was excellent. So easy to make too! I will definitely make it again.

This crust was great!  I was very skeptical of this one because it just sounded too good to be true.  I was in a time crunch on Thansgiving baking, so I used this recipe in a hurry.  It was great!  I did add some extra sugar however, as i was using this for a dessert. The crust was very flaky.  You could tell that it was different than normal, but it was very good.  I received many compliments on the crust.  Will use again and again.

This pie crust was just what I was looking for!  I made it with a quiche and the saltiness of the crust complimented the quiche perfectly.  I made it exactly as the recipe describes and my husband LOVED it!

I hate making pie crusts & I don't want to buy them.  Until I found this recipe.  I have used this for my French Silk Pie & for my Pot Pie crust (reduce sugar).  My family loves it.  I love it because it is SUPER easy! A must try.

Let's just say I was hesitant to try it but I was wrong.  Much easier and super tasty.  Too salty for dessert so just leave it out for a pie (like others have said).

Made this for this first time today for a chicken and onion pie. It was delicious! It was a bit crumbly but I used a slightly larger tin so I will need to  adjust the ingredients in future. It was so easy to make and anything that uses only 1 pan is great in my book!

My aunt gave me this same recipe when I got married 19 years ago.  I love this recipe!  It's so simple and I've never had it fail.  I love fresh blueberry pie in it because of the salty crust, combined with tart berries and sweet filling.  I have also used it for chicken pot pie.  I do not prebake the crust for pot pie.  I make 2 recipes for pot pie and roll out one recipe for the top crust.  Of course, don't pre-bake the crust for pot-pie.

My mom and dad made many pies and cobblers, one making the crust, the other the filling.  When it was Dad's turn to make the crust, he always used this recipe.  But he went one better - he reserved some of the mixture (about the size of a golf ball).  He then used a grater to spread the reserved dough over the filling before baking.  Great topping for a fruit pie!

Yes, very easy.  I had a smaller alum foil quiche pan so I think my problem was it was too large.  I ended up with enough to cover the alum foil pan and enough to cover the bottom of a 9 inch pie plate.  No matter; didn't faze  me--I just made another quiche!  Only used water instead of milk to accomodate a staff person who is lactose intolerant.  Worked wonderfully.  Thanks for the recipe!

This crust is fantastic!  I needed something that didn't have to be refrigerated for 4 hours for a  turkey pot pie.  The crust is the consistency of cookie dough before baking, which worried me, but it turned out just fine.  Best of all:  after serving the pot pie, I asked my husband if he likes it, and he said that it's really good, and "the crust makes it better than the ones you've made before."  It's ridiculously quick and easy, and not even remotely messy, and best of all, it got 5 stars from both my husband and me.  Thanks B1BMOM!

It IS very salty-I used this crust for pot pies & the salt was very predominate. Also, it doesn't roll out for the top crust, which didn't even occur to me. I still used it, just flattened it w/my hands & laid it in pieces over the top. Not pretty but it worked:)

This makes a better pie crust than any butter or shortening based recipe I have tried.  When making pie crust, it's important to use a good brand of flour. Something that is a little glutenous, so that it will hold it's self together and be flaky instead of crumbly.   Don't scale the recipe for two crusts, make them separately, you won't be able to mix the ingredients quickly enough to make it nice and flaky.  I also usually ad a little vanilla and molasses because canola oil is pretty tasteless, unlike lard or butter.   Also, depending on the sweetness and flavor of the pie, it might be a good idea to halve the salt.    When baking, I've found it will brown faster than lard based crusts, so I would advise covering it with some aluminum foil.  It definitely needs to be in the oven for at least 45min if you are planning on using it without baking it a little before hand for pumpkin and pecan style pies.     Overall fantastic and easy recipe!  Also great for quiches!

This crust is awesome! It is super easy to make and very delicious. Don't forget to puncture so that it vents otherwise it bubbles up (It looked funny).

I keep on using this very tasty, always flaky recipe! (I HAVE ALWAYS MADE IT 1 1 TBSP SUGAR, AND 1/2 TSP SALT). Seems impossible to mess up, except don't pre-bake it. Well, sometimes I bake the crust after pressing into muffin cups for 15 mins or until lightly browned. Then I fill them with boston cream filling I made on the stove, giving beautiful and incredibly yummy custard tarts. I think my favorite this about this recipe, however, is that is can get burned and still taste great! -That is never the case with traditional crusts.

I've never been able to make very good pie crust until I found this recipe!  I made it yesterday for a simple, old fashioned egg custard pie and it was fabulous!  Very tender and flaky! No more store bought pie crust for me!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I gave this a 5 because it is what it says it is...fast and easy. You cannnot mess this up!  The first time I made it i followed the advice of readers and reduced the salt and increased the sugar..It was great for quiche!!!  The last time I made it exactly as written and it was definitely too salty.  I will continue to use this for quiche  but make it with less salt and a little more sugar.

Super easy and very good.  Decrease the salt for desserts, but as written, this recipe makes a fabulous quiche crust.

This recipe really was easy to make!  I always dread making pie crusts because they never come out as expected, but this really was easy!!!  I love the fact that you can mix everything right in your pie pan!  The only complaint that I have is that the crust turned out a little crumbly =(  I expected it to be smooth and resemble a typical pie crust but it looked more like a graham cracker pie crust.

Like a lot of reviewers I am not a pie maker and not very good at the rolling, so when I came upon this recipe today I decided to give it a try, incredible easy!!!!  I followed the advise of the other reviewers and omitted the salt as I was make a dessert and the plus side is that the recipe did not need a crust top.  This is being added to my recipe box and will definitely be used again.  The great thing is everything is already there in your kitchen.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is so darn easy! I'm not a fan of pie crust anyway, and didn't have the energy to make a "real" one, so I tried this. My kids thought it was good, and I thought it was so easy it should have been illegal. :) Will definitely use it for my go-to pie crust recipe when in a rush. Not the prettiest, but very functional. NOTE: I did not put any salt in it after reading reviews. Probably will for quiche though.

Super easy and delisious! I added some almond pouder and more sugar to the mix (it was a sweet pie). I used 2/3 of the mix to make the crust, added some slised almonds to the rest and made the crumbly topping. Thank you so much for the recipe, finaly I can make my own pie crust that is flaky and yummy!

I was not impressed with this at all. I tried the original recipe first, and like others have said its WAY too salty. I tried it again, this time eliminated the salt altogether and using 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2 teaspoons (I like things very sweet). Even after doing that, it had an off taste to it that I couldn't place. I might try this again if I'm desperate, but its not something I would use if I was making something to share with other people.

This recipe is good for pie crust but it's definitely not for top. The dough doesn't stick together, which made it impossible for lattice or any other top crust.

Very easy and tastes wonderful.  Kind of crumbly not heavy.  This recipe goes wonderfully with the poor mans pie recipe.  You could make tw shallow 9in pies with this recipe.  When I make one recipe of poor mans pecan pie, I make 2 shallow pies with one crust recipe.

I will be making pie much more often because of this recipe. Super easy and fast, and the taste, while not flaky like rolled pie crusts, is very nice. I didn't add any salt, and added additional sugar.

This recipe works WONDERS! I loved it! Instead of using the reccomended ammount of salt I subtracted a little.

It came out so light and fluffy like and tasted fantastic with my apple pie!

Very easy to make and it tastes good! The first time I made this recipe I had no trouble. I followed the lead of other reviewers and cut back on the salt (1/2 t) and used 1 T sugar. The second time it was too dry -- I had too much flour as I had packed the flour into the measuring cup. I tried again, didn't pack the flour, and it came out fine.

I used this recipe to make calzones because I did not have any yeastand it came out great. The crust didn't take long to cook, it was not to cruchy or thin and it was perfect for my calzones. I can't say that I had a problem but I did add parm cheese and more flour to get a thicker crust.  After this easy crust recipe I will no longer need to use any other recipe for my calzones.

I love recipes that are rock-bottom simple, and this was it! It was a bit greasy, but still came out nicely. I was glad that I didn't need too many ingredients. If you cut back on the oil, you don't even need to mix in the pan, but can roll it out.

What a winner. I made this as a crust for quiche and it was perfect. I'm often hesitant to make quiche because crusts are such a hassle, but this was a cinch - no extra bowls - and it came out flaky and delicious. Thanks!

I love this recipe. I used it with a no-bake pumpkin pie recipe (located on this site). I did increase the sugar to 3 tablespoons and pre-baked it for 10 minutes before putting my pumpkin pie filling in it. This recipe helped me out so much at Thanksgiving.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy and tasted great! Although I added some sugar to it, just to make it sweeter. It had too much of a savory pie crust taste before the addition of sugar. I messed it up a little bit too I must confess. I forgot to add the oil at first so I kept adding water to make the dough stick. Then I realized I forgot the oil and I felt like a dumb-nut. After I added the oil, the crust turned out great! Thanx for the recipe!

This was a very simple recipe to follow and quite tasty.  I did use my hands, however to flatten down the crust onto the pie plate....the fork left impressions I did not like. I can't wait to make some more pies!!

This is one of the best pie crusts I've ever had, and it was so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it made just the right amount of dough to fill the entire pie plate without being spread out too thin. It was flaky and had a slightly sweet taste that would probably compliment any type of sweet filling you'd want to put in there. I'll never buy frozen pie crust again!

This is the easiest, healthiest, and best-tasting pie crust I've discovered. I'm so glad Louise shared! My husband and I used this crust on a whim when we made "Cheesy Quiche" by Donna on AllRecipes. It was simple, so tasty, and incredibly flaky. My surprise is due to not having any butter or shortening used in this recipe, plus the fact that you make it right in the pie pan - no rolling!! It's excellent. I plan to use it for pie in the near future.

I used this recipe to make little tarts with vanilla pudding and chocolate curls.  The dough was very easy to make and use.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon as others suggested but I found this to still be way too salty.  Next time I think I will add just a pinch of salt and increase the sugar.

GREAT PIE CRUST!  Made this last night & filled with pineapple cream filling.  It was soooo good.  The crust was super easy and so very flaky.  I cooled crust completely before filling.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Very easy and good. The only problem I had, there was not enough crust to cover the whole 9 inch pie pan. I will definitely use this recipe. Thank you.

I like this crust a lot.  If you add a little sugar, as I think I saw in one of the other reviews, it suits a sweet pie wonderfully.  A great recipe for when the kids want to help, too.

This recipe gets a 5 star rating for easiness.  I thought it had a little too much salt.  I will probably use this recipe again just decrease the salt a little.

Fabulous, simple, quick and easy. If you find it is too salty, mix the ingredients more thoroughly. Perhaps try mixing the dry ingredients before adding the wet. Or, obviously, use less salt. The saltiness is no grounds to rate this useful recipe anything under four stars.

I would have given this crust a 5 star rating, save for one thing, I thought the end result was a little thick for a bottom pie crust.  I think however it was a direct result of the pie pan I used, though it says 'deep dish' I think it's a little THIN on that side.  When I was a kid 'deep dish' really meant JUST that.  Today, even the 'deep dish' pans they have out there now are NOT.  I will use this recipe again, for the taste was impressive and I didn't have to fuss over rolling out the pie crust.  I do believe that I will half the ingredients like I SHOULD have done before when I realized my pie plate was just a little SHORT for this recipe.  Thanks a million for the great recipe!

I've always hated rolling pie crust, so I was delighted to see there was no rolling with this one...it was very quick and easy and the taste was not comprimised. I made it for strawberry pie, so after it came out of the oven I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes or so to cool it off. The pie was wonderful and it is much better than other crust...nice and flaky!

This recipe was a lifesaver for my Christmas dinner. I usually use the pre-made pie crust shells for my pies; however, I forgot to purchase them for this event and due to the holiday all of the stores in my area were closed. This recipes is very easy and delicious. Thank you for the recipe. I will never purchase another pre-made pie crust shell again.

I made this pie crust on Christmas Eve for a sweet potato pie.  It was easy, quick
and delicious. What is even better is that it doesn't require shortening which I
happened to be out of when I started to make the pie crust.  Thank you so much
for sharing this recipe.

This crust rocks...it's made w/ things you actually have (oil not shortning). It's simple, kid friendly and foolproof. You can't ruin it.

I was looking for a fast pie crust and I found it. It was Sunday night and my daughter reminded me that Sunday is dessert day. I had all of the ingredients for a pumpkin pie but not enough time to make a crust. I used this recipe and it was perfect. I always use melted coconut oil when recipes call for vegetable oil. I baked the crust as directed, then added the filling and baked according to the pumpkin pie recipe. It was delicious! I disagree with other reviewers who said it was too salty and not sweet enough for a dessert pie. You need a bit of salt to balance out the sweet.

Fabulous!  Super easy.  You really CAN just mix this with a fork right in the pie plate, mold it and you’re good to go.  Loved the flakiness and taste.  Like other reviewers, I added only a pinch of salt and increased the sugar just a bit for a sweet pie. Never, ever buying a pie crust again.

Followed other reviewers instructions to reduce salt and increase sugar for a fruit pie. Dough was hard to work with when making top layer. Wasn’t able to get crust as thin as I’d like without it crumbling apart. I didn’t mind the flavour or thicker crust, but Hubby said he didn’t like it, all he could taste was flour and it seemed like something was missing (probably the buttery flavour he’s used to).

It was easy, it came out flaky, but it did not taste great at all! It tasted like oil. I'm going to try it with melted butter next time.

I subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil which worked great. It left a subtle coconut flavor...perfect for my strawberry rhubarb pie. I also left out the salt. Solid recipe. I love that it’s just a few ingredients.

Wanted to make my husband a banana cream pie but didn’t want to spend a whole lot of time on the crust.  I found this, read the reviews and gave it a whirl. I doubled the recipe on everything except the salt so I could have an extra crust. I blended the milk and oil together before putting it into the dry ingredients I had already mixed into a bowl. I used a pastry cutter and it came out awesome, not too salty at all. Glad I doubled the recipe so ready for my coconut cream,????

I loved this pie crust recipe.  It was quick and easy to make. I am a novice pie crust maker, baker and cook. I just had a small suggestion. I have a 9" deep dish Pyrex glass pie dish. I found that 1-1/2 cups of flour didn't quite cover my pie dish. The next time I make this pie crust I will use 2 cups of flour and adjust other ingredients to cover my only pie crust dish. I didn't prebake this crust. I just added my pumpkin filling. The pie crust was flaky and delicious. Thanks for this recipe. I now feel confident enough to make my own pie crusts and not use the store bought crusts.

I needed a crust for a pie recipe I found on another website (that one used store-bought).

I followed the reviews and added more sugar (~ 1/4 cup). It turned out well. The edges were a bit hard.

I like that the recipe is easy, and the crust can be made quickly.

This pie crust is definitely NOT flaky and does have a strong oily taste. It is easy, but so are better pie crust recipes.  This kind of reminds me of the density of graham cracker crusts without the flavour.  If you do choose to make this crust, it is definitely NOT good for sweets. It might work for meat pies, but I think any other pie crust that uses butter or shortening would be better than this oil recipe. Thanks anyway

So i didn't have regular vegetable oil and substituted coconut oil. I don't know if this was the reason I found the crust hard to handle/ manage but it definitely could have contributed. I felt it was extremely sticky and when I made the top crust for my pie it was falling all apart so I had to lay it on strips.

Five stats for being so fast and easy!
I followed the advice of others and cut the salt to a pinch since I was using this for a fruit tart, and I used coconut oil -- it was very good & so, so easy!

I was making a wild blackberry pie and took into account previous reviewers' remarks. I decreased the salt to a pinch and used 1 Tablespoon sugar. The pie was phenomenal! This recipe is a keeper. 
P.S.forgot to mention that I also substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour.

YES YES YES. I've been looking for this! I made it exactly as is, rolled it out partially but not too thin so I could pick it up and put it in my pie dish. Then I used my fingers to spread the dough out and up the sides of the dish. I saw a tip to roll it out on waxed paper and then place it in the greased pie dish and peel off the wax-- I'll try that next time!  I used this for a quiche, but I understand that if used for a pie it would need more sugar added. This worked perfect and it was easy. No more refrigerated Pillsbury pie dough needed anymore. Woo hooo!

First attempt at crust from scratch! Followed reviewers suggestion to use less salt and more sugar if using for sweet instead of savory dish. I ended up adding about 2 tablespoons more flour after I pressed crust into pan because it felt too greasy. Turned out really well though. Every one loved the chocolate pudding pie I made with it. My mom said it was great, and she wonders now if she prefers a pressed crust instead of rolled because of the texture. It held well during serving, and was kinda flaky or crumbly when eating (yummy). Will definitely make it again and try as written for a savory dish!

I was pleasantly surprised w this crust!! The dough looks oily but it bakes up nicely, flakey and tender. I've used it twice- as written- for quiche. No need to prebake. It held up well in the fridge for a few days- no soggy. Today I used this for a pudding pie. As recommended I used 3T sugar and 1/2 the salt, also added a splash of vanilla, an yes, I baked this one 13 min. Tastes like shortbread.

It was not a family favorite.   I liked the idea of it being easy... and it was.  But it came out more like a powdery texture graham crust.  Not the crust for a quiche.  It may work perfect for a different type of pie.

Perfect for 9" pie plate, not enough yield for a 9.5".

A big hit on Thanksgiving as crust for Grandma Ople's Apple Pie. As other reviewers noted, I changed to 1T of sugar and reduced salt. I made a second one and tried to roll it for a lattice topping- that didn't work as far as looks but the taste was great. Altogether a great option for a baked from scratch pie in a short time. And at Thanksgiving, who has extra time?

This is great.  It gets 5 stars when the salt is cut in half.

Going to call this "my in a pinch pie crust ". Needed a pie crust in a hurry so thought I'd give it a try.Was skeptical at first but when I saw the end result I was surprised at how easy and good it was. My grandson who is the pie expert said it was the best pie ever. I will definitely will make it again.

I followed the recipe except I used less salt and a little more sugar after reading some reviews. This was the most horrible, greasy crust we have ever eaten , and I would never waste my time making it again .

I made this crust for a deep dish peach pie. I did cut the salt by half and increased the sugar by 1 tbspn.  Swapped vegetable for coconut oil and used almond milk. It was flaky and cut beautifully.  I'll post the next pie, because this one was devoured.

Thank you for sharing this awesome and super- easy recipe! I've made two flawless fruit (cherry & blackberry) pies with perfect crumble. I double the recipe, add twice the amount of sugar, divide it for the bottom crust, then add either a touch more sugar or cinnamon for the crumble.  The topping turns out crisp and beautifully brown. I've had no issue with the bottom being soggy, even without egg wash. I do think pre-baking the crust is key. A keeper!!

Okay pie crust. Does not work for a double crust, so only use if you need bottom crust. Very quick and easy, and for that I gave it 3 stars. Not as flaky as a typical pie crust recipe, obviously but not awful.

I used olive oil as others said using veg oil changed the taste and it wasn't good. With olive oil it tasted great.  Found it to be a bit crumbly so added milk as I patted into dish and it came together well. If using it for dessert add more sugar. Great starter easy pie crust to make

This was an easy recipe to make...I mixed it all in my kitchen aide and put in the pie plate and spread out then.  I added half the salt and a bit more sugar to the recipe.  I did use organic raw sugar, unbleached flour and olive oil instead.   My family loved the crust with our chocolate pie...it was flaky but held together nicely!!  Will make again.

I have made this many times.  My only complaint is it is so crumbly. You can't roll it out like most pie crusts. It is super easy though.  This last time I added 1 egg to it and it seemed like it held together a bit more than without.  It is perfect for pot pies with the salt, but for fruit and cream pies I half the salt.  It has a very good flavor. I gave it 4 which is an average of 3 (crumbly texture ) and 5 (flavor and ease)

I made a peach pie with this recipe but I had no vegetable oil so I used melted margarine and found myself using 4 more TBS melted margarine AMD 4 more TBS milk but worked out great, tasted perfect with the peach filling my sisters loved it.

Replacing 1/2 of oil with soften, unsalted butter, add a touch of Cardamom and Nutmeg and  cut back on Salt - that would be 5 stars! Easily the best, easiest, crumbly and light weight crust for Euro style thin tarts.  Last made for Cranberry Custard tart, exceptional base!

It was great to try this recipe, which is simpler and i made it for vanilla cream pie, i didn't add that much salt and i added milk a lil bit more, i used brown sugar instead of white one, and avocado oil. It was great, even if it's a little bit tougher (positively we can say it crunchy! :D) but my friend said it was yummy and the crust wasn't fleaky indeed but still yummy :) Thanks for sharing!

Was very easy to make! I would give it 5 stars except I have yet to eat it as the pie is cooling. Im sure it will taste gopd though, I added extra sugar with some cinnamon in my crust.

I needed to make a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and my local Harris Teeter stopped carrying Immaculate Pie Crusts.  Those are the only ones that I've found without animal lard (ugh).  So I found this recipe and it was a hit for Thanksgiving dinner.  I loved it as well.  It's super easy and very tasty.  I'll use this again and again.  In the past, I never wanted to tackle a homemade pie crust.

You just saved me! I had no idea how easy it could be to make pie crust. I was feeling lazy and didn't want to deal with the roller etc. I followed the recipe but made it in a bowl first with the fork, then once incorporated transferred it to the pan. Easy and perfect!  I made a quiche so I didn't cook the crust first and it cooked perfectly. Thanks again!

It's not a flaky pie crust but l love how EASY it is to make. It is quick way to make a pie  and taste GREAT.
LOVED IT!!!!!!!!
Don't mean to be rude but I don't know why others had so much trouble. Also the recipe said mix all ingredients in the pan (And nothing about rolling it out).
I was able to roll out a top crust. I just had to keep drying and flouring the rolling pin then I cut it in half to get it on the pie and it came out Great!

Great recipe, one thing I liked better is substituting Cocoanut milk and then reducing the salt to half teaspoon and reducing the sugar to one teaspoon. Bake ahead of filling with fruit for ten minutes. After filling with fruit or quiche recipe, bake again as suggested.  Worked great for my strawberry/apple pie!  Thanks.

I just made this for Chicken pot pie it tastes good it smells good but when I was making the top layer for the chicken pot pie I couldn't handle the piecrust. It literally fell apart it would not stay together had to piece it together on top of the chicken pot pie. If you're using this crust for just the bottom then I would say yes it's good but if you're needing this crust to use as a top layer for any dish I would say absolutely not.

I make this with whole wheat flour, varying amounts of sugar and different kinds of oil, depending on what i'm using it for. I'm not sure it takes any less time than rolling out dough, but it sure is easier, and tastes great. I love how foolproof it is.

Awesome flakey crust.  It definitely takes my quiche up a notch and everyone who has tried it, always comments on how much they enjoy this crust.  I use whole wheat flour but I don't think that makes too much of a difference in the overall taste or texture.  I plan on using this for other savory pies and plan to make a ham pie in the near future using this recipe.

Since finding and trying this recipe, I have never bought another prepared pie crust. The taste is incredible! I agree that it's too salty for desserts (just cut the salt to 1/4 tsp), but it's perfect for quiche, pot pies, etc. I love this recipe and find myself sharing it left and right. Thank you for an excellent recipe, and thank you for all the time you've saved me in making more time-consuming crusts!

This actually works great!  I didn't think it would, but I just had to try it since I can't get shortening here and using oil makes it so easy!  Used it in a chocolate cream pie and it was awesome!  Thanks for a super fast and easy crust!

Love! I'm a huge fan of one dish cooking and baking, so when I saw this was mixed in the pie pan, I had to try it. I've never made pie crust like this from scratch but I will never buy another one as long as I have these ingredients on hand! I was making for a quiche but did use less salt and a splash more milk. Can't wait to make a dessert in it!

This pie crust has a delectable texture and taste. I like the tang of the occasional taste of salt you encounter is you eat the pie. It's a delicious contrast to the filling. I use it for both sweet and savory pies. It's so easy to make that I am encouraged to make pies more often. It comes out perfectly every time. And I love that it uses oil instead of solid shortening which I am avoiding.

For what this is, it is GREAT. This is such an easy crust recipe. I used it for a last minute quiche that I made and it came out great. Also great if you are out of butter. If you are putting time in to making a pie I would not use this recipe, however, it is great for something last minute.

This is the best and easiest pie crust. We used it for Chicken Pot Pie IX Allrecipe  and it was perfect with it   My husband and daughter commented on the crust being the best. She said the crust is the bomb. I just doubled recipe and cut in half after rolling into ball. For top crust I just rolled half the dough between two parchment paper and flipped over the pie filling. A little ripped off but I just placed it on top and put remaining dough overlapping. It still looked pretty. Simple ingredients but really delicious. I even tasted it raw and it was already yummy. Thank you for sharing. God bless

I liked the fact that I didn't have to roll this out and do all the cutting in with the butter and all that stuff. What didn't like is that this crust is more crumby, and I really like a flaky crust better. That being said, nobody in my family noticed at all.  So it was really fast but meh.

This looked okay at first, but it tasted like rock-hard cardboard. I used olive oil, but I hardly think that would have made enough of a difference as to have it taste so bad. Tried to make a quiche with it, am going to scoop up the egg from the crust and eat it like scrambled eggs. Such a waste.

I made this yesterday for a spinach quiche, it was amazing! That was my first time ever making a pie crust. It was so easy,literally taking less than five minutes to prepare. I figured that if I messed it up, I could quickly run to the store for a pre-baked crust. It was honestly the best pie crust I have ever had, and my family has made a ton of pies! Thank you!

Awesome recipe!! It was so easy and tasted yummy with my dutch apple pie! I used less salt and added a bit more sugar, like others suggested and it turned out awesome! It tasted like I took much time rolling out the dough, but didn't have to! I should've covered the edges with foil half way through baking because the edges got more brown than I would've liked, but no biggie. Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

My family enjoyed it :) I would for sure say this is not my 'go to" or anything, but it is good when your baking something and want a more flakey/crumbly like crust and turned out perfect for my peach pie (that was real juicy). I think it would be nice for cheesecake too.  I will probably use this recipe again when I am out of shortening :) I DID use half the salt called for and I only pre-baked it for a few minutes while I was finishing up the filling.

I think that even 1 tbsp of sugar is not enough for sweet pies. Next time will try 2 tbsp. 1/4 tsp of salt is ok for such amount of flour. Yes, it's very grainy, so it doesn't work for a top crust. Besides,  it's a problem to cut it because the crust tends to crumble. I made a pecan pie with it. Not so bad when you're in a hurry or just don't want to waste your time on rolling out a pie crust.

I used Olive oil as well and it was super easy. I used this on top of a chicken pot pie and it was perfect. I did not add the sugar or salt though. If you are putting it on top of a pie, it would better to chill it for a bit and roll or squish into the shape you need on plastic wrap. Also, cook for a little longer then 15 minutes, mine should have stayed in the oven longer, but that's my fault not the recipes.

While this will never replace my go-to pie crust recipe, it's fantastic for if you need to whip something up fast. If I have leftover filling and no crust left, I'll throw this together (takes about five minutes) and make a small pie or tart.

This was a very quick and easy recipe. Unfortunately, even with reducing the salt as other reviewers suggested, it was still too salty and overly crumbly. I made a top crust as well (this was for a meat pie made with leftover pot roast). Maybe the texture had a chalky mouth feel and the crumbling was more obvious because I included a top crust. I'll return to a more traditional crust, it's well worth the additional effort, but I so wanted a quicker alternative!

This recipe was super easy, but WAY too salty. It tasted terrible in my chocolate cream pie. Next time I will be sure to not put as much salt in the batter. Do not use this recipe the way it is now.

I tried this recipe last night for a quiche.  I cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  It was GREAT!  There was enough to go up the sides of the pie plate and make a fluted edge at the top!  I was afraid it would be tough, but it was nice and tender.  (I had ready-crusts in the frig. which I discovered had expired in 2011....I avoided making pies, but no more!)

Great crust.  Just be sure to really mix the ingredients.  I had a mouthful of salt at one point.  :)

This was too easy! After reading many of the reviews I cut the salt in half.  Prebaked for 10 minutes and let cool. Added  my ingredients for Broccoli Quiche, and let bake. I let it cool in the fridge for 10 minutes, and it was easy to remove from the pan.  For a dessert  crust  I will add more sugar to the mix. This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

It's an ok pot pie crust.  Not really a dessert type.  But it really isn't that bad for pot pies at all .  A bit oily, as  well.

After reading the reviews, I decreased the salt and increased the sugar based on suggestions for using the crust with a dessert. I made a chocolate chess pie with this crust, and it was good. Not the best ever, but we were in a pinch as company was arriving soon for a picnic and I was one pie crust short! Not the first recipe I'd go to if I had the time to do the "real" thing, but definitely a life-saver in a pinch and not bad tasting. The crust was flaky and texture was great.

This required adjusting, and it was still pretty crumbly. Next time I'm adding more liquid, but the salt was way too much, and I reduced it by half, and it was still a little too salty. I will try this again, because it is the simplest I have found, but it's not the best.

I used this recipe last night for a ham and cheese pie(Cindi G. recipe on this site). It was sort of an experiment for both the crust and the pie.  The crust was great!  I used 1/2 t. salt and only 1 t. sugar for a savory pie.  I did not pre-bake the crust just patted it in to my 10" quiche pan and filled it with the pie ingredients.  The crust baked just fine while the savory pie baked.  Thanks for an easy way to make a delicious pastry - I'll try it again for a fruit/pecan or sweet pie using the 2 t. sugar in the original recipe.

I love this recipe! However, I lowered  the salt down to 1/2 a teaspoon. I used the crust in my mini muffin pan, and made tarts! :) they were delish!! Thank you, B1BMOM!!!

Such a great recipe! I don't always have butter around so this was perfect. I made this yesterday as a crust for a "taco pie" and was really happy with it.I used 1C of flour and 1/2C of cornmeal to give it some crunch, and used less salt and just a pinch of sugar.I pre-baked it for 15 minutes then let it cool. It was SO good! I will be trying the original recipe for when I make quiche, I'm so happy I don't have to buy frozen pie crusts anymore!! THANK YOU!

This recipe saved my Easter breakfast. I was a little unsure using oil instead of shortening or butter, but for my quiche, it was salty and flaky. I wish I had made two! I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I have never been able to make a decent pie crust but when we recently began receiving eggs I decided to give this a try for quiche. It worked so well! My SO and kids all loved it. It was very easy as well.

I used this recipe for a homemade pecan pie but used unrefined organic coconut oil...I will try only 1/2 teaspoon of salt next time as some other reviewers suggested...Otherwise, it was easy to make and very tasty though crumbly...

For being so wonderfully easy and quick, I would have given this recipe 4.5 or even 5 stars - if it weren't for the vegetable oil aspect. Came out of the oven reeking of oil and I knew before tasting it that this would be no replacement for a good quality pastry recipe (taste only confirmed it: tasted like the cheap oily crusts you get in grocery store pies). Easy solution: 1/2 cup melted butter instead of veg oil. Improves this recipe at least a star or two and gives a buttery flakiness instead of a greasy taste.  I made two with butter and two with vegetable oil: the butter ones are gone and the veg oil ones are moulding in the fridge! :S

i did tried this recipe twice at the same time , first time , it was little hard or dry and i had a hard time shapping it into the muffin pan , the second time was much better as i added more milk like half a table spoon and it was much easier to shape and the taste was good too .

I made a mistake & bought corn flour instead of all purpose flour so I thought it was going to be a disaster... but I added some brown sugar to the mix (it was for an apple pie) & it turned out great! It was kind of like a apple crumble!! I will do it exactly like that next time ;-)

I wouldn't have believed it unless I tried it.  ...it was late in the evening and I needed a crust, but didn't feel like going to the trouble to chip frozen butter and do the pie crust "thing".  I found this recipe and I was shocked.  Made as read, it seems better for a savory dish, a quiche or something.  Add a bit of cinnamon and a tad more sugar and it was berry pie worthy.  Thanks!

This is a five star pie crust recipe. I've made it twice now and both times it turned out beautifully. The first time I made the crust I rolled out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and baked it according to the instructions. The second time I was making a yogurt pie and wanted a little sweeter crust- I added extra sugar (2T instead of teaspoons) and pressed the crust into the pan to bake. Amazing.

it's really easy!  and surprising tastes delicious...rivals some of the more complicated butter and shortening recipes i've tried - and anyone can whip it up so fast.  i use canola oil because i don't keep vegetable oil in the house and it works like a charm.

I would have given this five stars but it tells you to pre-bake the crust. I made a pumpkin pie and by the time the pie was done the crust was burnt! So as a warning, if you have a pie that takes longer than 15-20 minutes to bake, don't pre-bake the crust. It will burn.

Other than that I think this is a great quick recipe: no ice water or cold, hard butter thank goodness!

Eh. Normally my kids rave about the cooking, tonight not so much. It was easy but the oil killed it. Next time, I'll try making this with butter instead.

This recipe is pure genius!
I'm horrible and baking, and pie crusts are always my down fall. When I found this I couldn't believe it would actually work. But it did and then some, my mother even uses this recipe now instead of the old way of sifting and cutting in lard. Thank you so much for putting this on there.

i tried this with minced lamb pea pie and topped with mashed potato and mozzarella cheese.. all was yumm except the crust was easy to make But a big nooo to put 2 tea spn of sugar in it tastes too sweet and thats not what i wanted but sorry its the honest truth,, just use salt next time but definately not the best crust out here as well needs adjustment and cant make a top crust out of will keep that in mind,,

I havent been on here in a while and came on just to review this recipe. This pie crust is fantastic! I made this for a quiche I was making for my mom. Literally you mix it IN the pie pan! I prepared this exactly as instructed and it was AMAZING. I will never buy another store bought crust again. PLUS no butter or shortening?!?!? Awesome.

I have never, ever, made a pie/pie crust until today. I feel like Martha Stewart because this turned out so well! I don't think I'll ever buy a pie crust again!

This was a very easy and really good recipe. The only thing I would change is take the salt out. It had a strong salty taste.

I agree with the others; this did turn out saltier than I desired. I should have followed my instinct (and I should have read the reviews.) It also crumbled and browned too much when I baked it again for my filling, so I probably shouldn't pre-bake. I do like that the crust is immediately in the pie tin, minimizing the mess. I am grateful it didn't call for a food processor because mine has been out of commission for about a decade. I am most happy that it is a simple, simple recipe that I can use over and over.

I love this pie crust.  Like others say for fruit pie you should half the salt and double the sugar.  I have never been able to make a home made pie crust, and now I can!!!  Thank you so much for giving us this :)

I've always made pie crust the hard way, but this method knocked my socks off!  I did heed the suggestion to cut the salt and increase sugar (1/2 tsp and 3 Tbs) and it was fantastic for the Frozen Pineapple Pie also on this site.  Very quick and easy--tastes great!  This recipe is a keeper.

This pie crust was very easy to make. I used it for a chocolate pie, so I doubled the sugar in the recipe and just used a tiny bit of salt. It turned out perfect, It was a nice flakey good crust. Thanks so much, I was tired of hard crust that never turned out right!

Super easy and yummy! the only changes I would make is to mix in a bowl previous to putting it int he pie dish. It is easier to dispurse it evenly that way. and then use a spoon as opposed to a fork to push up against edge, or your hands work great:) Also, because of the previous entries, I added a tid bit less salt.

You don't always find an 'easy' recipe that is actually good, but this one is!  Not only did I make it with ease, but I also recieved great compliments for it, nice and flaky, just sweet enough.  I will always use this crust whenI make a pie.

This recipe is so easy!  I'll never waste my time making complicated pie crust recipes again.  I did add a little sugar to it as someone recommended and it's scrumptious.  First time I did it I forgot to pre-bake it.  Don't forget to do this step.  A keeper!

I had high hopes for this recipe as I am typically not so successful with home made pie crust and was out of store bought. I needed something for dinner that very second! I was ever so hopeful this would work out, it was extremely easy to make. However, it was SO salty it was inedible, and I was making a savory dish. If I were to ever try making it again (and I doubt I will), I would drastically cut down the salt. For now, store bought works just fine for me!!

This pie crust is wonderful. We have had it in our family for years. The only differnce is we use 2 T. of sugar when we make a fresh fruit pie and 1 T. normally. Then bake at 375 for about 12 minutes. Perfect every time!

This is very good pie crust. But it was too sweet for quiche. Next time I`ll reduce sugar at all. But I think, you must use more sugar, when you bake a sweet pie with this crust. I liked the texture it was tender and flaky. Thanks.

This is a great recipe!  If I'm going to use it for a dessert, I just alter the sugar to one full tablespoon and don't add any salt.  When I make a quiche, I lessen the sugar to only one tablespoon.  I wouldn't use this recipe if I were worried about the appearance of my pie, but it's great when I'm throwing something together last minute!  Everyone who has tasted it, loves it!

I would never have believed how outstanding this pie crust could be! Reading the reviews and rating, I gave it a try. WOW! I stopped making homemade crusts years ago and now Pillsbury just lost another customer! The only change that I made was to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp.; I prebaked the shell 15 minutes at 400 degrees for quiche. I make lots of pies/quiche -  what a wonder find! Thanks and enjoy!

I LOVE this pie crust recipe! So easy to make and everyone thought my last chicken pot pie was the best I've ever made (it was because of the crust)!

I love this crust! I made a few small changes for a mixed berry pie.. I cut out the salt, use butter instead of vegetable oil and add honey to taste. My guy wants these pies all the time!

So simple! We have used this for pumpkin pie (using only half the salt) and for Quiche. We liked it so much that it has become the crust we use every time that we make Pumpkin Pie. However, I would not recommend using it for a fruit filling, it seems to work best with fillings that set.

I've made this twice, once for mini fruit pies and once for beef pies. The texture and flavor were good, but both times we ended up with pretty severe indigestion. Not sure if it was coincidental, but I'm not exactly keen to find out.

This is a fabulous recipe! Quick & easy - do NOT EVER buy a nasty pre-made crust again! Save money & enjoy the compliments.  Don't worry if you're making a two-crust recipe. I have used this for a top "crust" as well - just crumble on top of your filling!

It was good, but very crumbly. It almost tasted like shortbread cookies! I did reduce the salt as I was making a sweet tart.

Was very easy to make and thats a plus! I used it for an apple pie, it turned out ok. The bottom crust was a little too flakey and fell apart too easy, would be perfect for an apple crisp. I too added more sugar and half the salt. Will use it again because it was so easy.

My go-to crust for quiches and quick casseroles. Have yet to use for actual pies, however. I find it very quick and tasty. Takes less than 3 minutes to make and push into the pie tin. I have a quiche in the oven as we speak that used this crust. Yum!

better just to stick with the roll-out pie crust.  I thought I was saving time using this recipe but it took much longer patting it into the plate and all the hard work was for nothing...the crust was terrible!!! will not make again.

This was easy, delicious, and flaky. I cut the salt in half as recommended. It crumbles before it is cool, but after a few minutes out of the oven it is ready to go. I didn't believe it would be so easy and good but it is!

I have never even attempted to make pie crust because I'm not a fan of rolling the dough etc etc.  So this was perfect!  I did cut down on the salt (think I used half of what the recipe called for).  Also, if I have a pie that is to bake for an hour + I only bake the shell about 6-7 min so it can finish the baking process with the pie and not burn.  Turns out perfect everytime.  Thanks!!

I made this crust for a quiche, I added a little less oil and the crust cracked just a little (my own fault), but other than that it's very tasty. And I used whole wheat flour.

I have to repeat what many others have said...this is a great pie crust if you are in a hurry, but too salty for a sweet filling.  I read others comments and cut back on the salt for a chocolate pie filling.  It was still a bit salty.  I will save this one for quiche filling. Edited....I used this again tonight for a pumpkin pie, but cut the salt to about 1/4 tsp and used a full Tablespoon of sugar.  Worked great for the pumpkin pie!  Of course, I didn't bake it first, but it filled and baked as usual with pumpkin pies.  Very flaky and good.  A little "different" taste than traditional pie crust, but still very good.

Amazing recipe! It's super easy and very versatile. I've added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon and used it for a pumpkin pie. I've added a dash of sea salt and used it for a pot pie. A little brown sugar will turn it into a cherry pie with a sweet twist. Great all around and perfect for "off the cuff" experimenting without catastrophic loss if it goes wrong!

Although I can roll out a decent pie crust, when making a recipe which calls for a single crust, I find myself a bit lazy. This is a fantastic recipe for a quiche. I eliminated the salt and was more than happy with the results. I use this recipe exclusively now when making quiche.

I had my reservations, but this crust is fabulous. Definitely as good as the ones you buy at the store...the texture is great, and the dough was super easy to work with. Since I used mine for a cream pie, I only put in a pinch of salt and doubled the sugar. I'm going to try this with a fruit pie, and see if it still works.

Wow!  Good and easy!  I did mix the ingredients in a bowl cuz I'm messy, and for strawberry pie halved the salt and doubled the sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was the easiest crust recipe ever! I made it in just a few minutes and actually used it for a quiche. It worked great! Easy and simple. I will use this again!

I was excited to try this crust because I'm lousy at rolling dough.  Unfortunately, I took the advice of some reviewers and used olive oil (actually half olive oil and half veg oil).  I used it for a quiche this morning and could really taste the olive oil, so much so that I could barely finish my serving.  However, that is not why I gave this only 3 stars.  Though the crust was extremely easy going in, it was not coming out.  It basically crumbled apart on me.  Because it was so easy and I think it may have had a good flavor if not for the olive oil, I will be trying it again and hopefully will have better luck with the texture.

My first homemade pie crust ever and it turned out just perfect.  Used it on a peach pie and it was flaky and tender and very easy to deal with.  I passed this on to all my family.

I tried this pie crust recipe a few days ago and it was great. The only thing I would change is to cut the salt down from 1 tsp to a half tsp and think it would be a lot better.

Used this recipe when I was short a pie crust for chicken pot pie.  Very easy and turned out well.  It's not a flaky crust, but it was good and did the job.

I used this crust recipe for a chicken pot pie and it worked wonderfuly for that purpose. It was also very easy to make. I would however cut the salt in half next time because it was a bit too salty.

I used this for a Chocolate Silk Pie recipe. I added a little more sugar like other said. It was good. My hubby who doesn't like crust said this was better than the store bought ones.

I love how easy this recipe was to make! I added less salt, and it was really good! I found it to be a bit too much crust though, but maybe I should just use a bigger pie pan next time. I made it twice already, and will make again!

I didn't have any shortening on hand and came across this recipe which seemed just too easy to taste good.  I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  I made 1.5x the recipe because I was using a deep dish pie pan.  I made a super yummy banana cream pie.  The only thing I'd change next time, is maybe add another tsp of sugar, it tasted a little salty to me, but was still very good.

This is an awesome pie crust!! I have tried many times to make a pie crust but can never get it perfect, and I can tell you that this one was great! I didnt have any troubles roling it out or putting it into the pie shell!! I agree with others, the water has to be very cold.

I didn't bake it before adding my pie filling (chicken gravy, assorted veggies, and shredded chicken).  The crust was mealy and gritty. Perhaps I did not mix it correctly or well enough.

I use the Vanilla Pumpkin Pie Recipe with this crust following the cooking directions to the Pumpkin Pie instead of the crust. I did not cover the crust with foil (to protect from burning) but did sit the pie tin on a pan in case of spills. My metal pie pan is a deeper than the regular disposable aluminum ones you buy and I pat my crust so it fills the bottom and sides. I also followed the advice of other bakers using 1 tbsp of sugar and .5 tsp of salt for dessert recipes. I've used corn oil a few times and canola oil another time with little difference in consistency. Baking is slightly longer as you want your toothpick poked in the center to come out clean - I added 3-5 minutes. (I deviate from the pumpkin pie recipe by adding more cinnamon.) I've rolled pie crust and like this recipe better for ease and flakier consistency. It's also easier to gauge how thick your pie crust will be as you pat it into your pan. I've made this combination 4 times - none of the pies lasted more than a day. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is by far the easiest recipe I have ever come across for pie crust! I used it for an apple pie and added a table spoon sugar and left out the salt. For once I was the one passing along the recipe to my grandmother!!
