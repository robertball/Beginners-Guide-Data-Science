This was delicious and super east to make. The only change I made was I used a frozen bag of veggies that had carrots as well as the cauliflower and broccoli...

We definitely liked it but I made changes based on what I had on hand, and afterwards didn't realize - I made a change because I didn't read the directions right!!
I agree with some of the reviews also, it's a very cheesy sauce (which we like), and will surprise you- it's more filling than you think. We also would have liked a little more ham in it. So to the changes made- I basically was cleaning out the refrigerator:
I didn’t have enough shredded cheddar so combined parmesan and loved it.
Used up some leftover broccoli from dinner a few nights before, but not enough (and didn’t have cauliflower), so used frozen peas and corn).
I already had regular cream cheese and felt the green onions did fine for flavor so didn’t worry about the chive and onion part.
I didn’t have a packaged pie crust but DID have a thin crust pizza dough, so used that. Not quite the flakiness you’d want, but worked in a pinch. Here’s the kicker… I didn’t read it correctly, thought the crust went on bottom AND top! So I rolled it out, put the bottom and side crust and couldn’t figure out how you’d get a full top crust (but I wasn’t planning to do that anyway). 
I had leftover mashed potatoes that I used for the top instead of a crust, kind of like a Shepard’s pie.

It turned out great though and I used up a lot of leftovers!

I made this as a special treat for my dad, and it was a huge success. I used a bottom and top crust in a regular pie plate. I added 10 minutes to the baking time.

I was very disappointed. Pie crust didn't cook perfectly.  Sauce was a very thick cheese sauce... without much flavor.  It was easy to make though...
