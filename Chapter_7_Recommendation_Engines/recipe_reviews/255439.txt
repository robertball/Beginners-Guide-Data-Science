This was pretty good overall. I made a few changes based on the previous reviews: I only used 1/2 cup of Israeli couscous instead of 1 cup couscous to keep it more like a soup; I added in some paprika with the other spices; and I left out the milk at the end. One more change I would make in the future is to use a full can of tomato paste instead of a few tablespoons of tomato puree (it could use that little bit of extra oomph from the tomato paste). I would make it again, but with these changes.

A nice idea but for me needed some help. Way too much couscous for me..  it soaked up all the broth and came out as thick as oatmeal. Maybe that is how this "soup" is supposed to be.. just be aware  if you make this. Seasoning - need more. I added some vegetable soup base to the leftovers and that helped.  Would suggest making this with a veggie or chicken stock instead of water... and increasing other seasonings

I only say that it is OK because I'm not sure how it is supposed to be. I found it a bit too thick for my taste.
