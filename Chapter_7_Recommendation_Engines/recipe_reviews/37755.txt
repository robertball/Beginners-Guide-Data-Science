I loved these - but when they cooled off, they weren't very good.  Keep them warm or microwave them before you eat.  Also, I used the little tiny square slices of sour dough bread - they were a great size for a finger food.

These were a hit!  I used shredded mozzerella cheese and sprinkled with basil and garlic powder!  Very Good!  I would like to experiment with the bread and cheese types.  Keep them warm though they were not very good when they got cold.  I will make these again!  They were just to easy and so delicious! Make these -you won't regret it!

This is one of the best appetizers I've ever made! My husband and I make them for lunch sometimes, and every time I take them anywhere they are GONE and people rave about how unique and great tasting they are.

These were excellent â€” a nice change to the typical brie w/ crackers for my appetizers. Very tasty and easy to make. The artichoke and red peppers are a good combo. I served them on lightly toasted thin-sliced french baquette bread. A must for my next 'partay.'

These were pretty good, I would use thinner slices of french bread than the approx. 3/4 inch that I cut.. and maybe add pesto or preferrably a sundried tomato pesto to the bread before the other ingredients..

My husband and I loved this recipe. it was so delicious and we thought that it almost looked and tasted like an appetiser you would order in a restaurant! I used sun-dried tomato basil and a garlic parmesian bread for an extra kick. Awesome!

I made these today and my husband really liked it. I changed it a little bit. I used sourdough bread, because it was what we had. Also I had been roasting things in the morning, so I roasted garlic and red bell peppers. So I took the roasted garlic and mashed it with butter and spread that on the bottom of the toasted sourdough. Then I sliced the artichokes and then the roasted red pepper and last I topped it with mozzarella. I wanted to eat it so badly, but just had oral surgery. I was craving it!!! Next time.

So it has been next time (just two days later) and it is sooo good!!! I increased it to 5 stars with the changes I made! Lovely! It has such a sweet and savory thing going on because of the roasted red bell pepper are sweet. So good!

These were ok, but i chose to put shredded cheddar instead of slices of cheddar so I'm not sure if that made a difference because it didn't melt well.  They had good flavor though.  I think next time I will try it as a dip instead of putting it on the baguette.  I will mix it all together and put it in the oven to melt.

This recipe is a hit everytime I make it. However, I typically use mozzarella and I think it complements the red pepper better. I've also used provolone and got good feedback. Finally, I take some butter and mix in roasted garlic and butter the downside of the bread and it's even better!

Really, Really, Really good. I followed this to a tee. The kids loved it. The husband loved it. And I loved it. The best part was you knew and felt as if you were eating something really healthy for you and for your kids and they were enjoying it not complaining about it. Will make again and again.

These were great. The artichokes have a distinct taste, so if you don't like artichokes, I wouldn't recommend it. But, if you do, then you'll love it.

I'm surprised - I love all of these ingredients. I thought they were a little bland. I made them exactly as written. I think I'll add garlic salt next time.

Exactly followed the recipe and the dish was alright, the flavors were interesting, but not quite right for me.  I think I'll likely make it again, but next time will be fresh grated parmesan and finely diced red peppers plus some fresh red peppers.  We tried it both with French bread and sour dough, the sour dough was easier to use (more surface area), but both were attractive.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!
