What's better than something you can spread on crackers for brunch?  This has become a "morning after the party" meal at my house.

I made this for 7 People and everybody really liked it. I added some pepper and a little Miracle Whip because I thought it was a little bit dry. Perfect for any party!

I used extra sharp white cheddar and I added a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. I made no other changes. I stuffed this into celery. Um, YUM. We all really liked this. Next time, I might add some garlic powder but as is, very tasty.

I think the ingredients were a little lopsided.  It's an awful lot of cheese in comparison to only 3 tablespoons of mayo.  It was good tasting but I did adjust the mayo by adding about a 1/3 of a cup.

Amazing!  Also, I have added diced garlic and onion in lieu of the green onion, which makes it spicy, and that is amazing too!  Thanks for the recipe.
