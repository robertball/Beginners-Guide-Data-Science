Not a bad recipe.  I made this last night and have a few changes.  1) Buy uncooked shrimp and cook them yourself in some olive oil in a frying pan. 2) use two small cloves of fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. 3) add one more tbsp of Old Bay. 4) Put some fresh parmesian on top.  Overall not, bad, but a small tweek would make it a lot better.

Great starter recipe - I did not want it warm so I eliminated the egg and mayo.  I chopped red pepper, plum tomatoes, & green onion then added salt, pepper, tarragon, basil, lemon juice, lots of parm cheese, a little olive oil and some balsalmic vinegar.  Then I diced a dozen raw & peeled shrimp (make sure to cut the shrimp in small pieces or then they are just too big & do not blend well with the other ingredients) Sprinkle the shrimp heavy with old bay then heat olive oil and garlic in the pan for a couple of minutes add shrimp cook until shrimp are bright pink.  Let cool for a few minutes add shrimp & drippings to bruschetta mixture stir, chill, serve with a french baguette and enjoy!

This bruschetta is awesome and a unique twist on a great appetizer.  I used 2 roma tomatoes and added a bit more green onion and used minced garlic and cooked my own shrimp (following KFeather's advice).  Great responses from my guests and SO EASY TO PREPARE!!!  I used sliced Italian Pane Bread and toasted in the toaster to save time.  Wonderful!

Delicious! A friend and I made this for when we grilled and everyone raved about it! We made it an hour or so ahead of time and let it sit in the refrigerator for the flavors to develop together. We also added a bit of fresh grated Parmesan/Romano cheese on top.

my guests said they like it, but I did not.  And since I had quite a bit leftover after the party, I'm assuming they may have jsut been being nice.  I think if I would have cut the Old bay in half it may have helped, but I'm not sure. Probably won't make this agian

Delicious! Was uneasy about adding the egg white I tasted it cold before I added the egg white and it was delicious but I went ahead and did it as the recipe stated and it's  really good either way! Definately double the tomato and green onions add a splash of balsamic vinegar and fresh basil if you have it . I think it's even better with this additions. Thanks.

Delish!  I think this is a great recipe that you could vary according to what it on sale/on hand/in season.  I used 4 plum tomatoes and juice from a 1/4 of a lemon, then doubled the Old Bay, olive oil, garlic powder and left out the egg white because I was making it ahead.  I added a dash of garlic powder to the mayo also.  No extra salt or pepper is needed - Old Bay packs a flavor punch!
