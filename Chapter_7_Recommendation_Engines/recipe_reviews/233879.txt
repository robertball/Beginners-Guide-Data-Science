This recipe was my 1st attempt at cooking bison and my 2nd attempt at a brisket. I was leery of using a slow cooker because, to me, a slow cooker meal is usually overcooked and is smelly. But I trudged on and made the recipe as directed so I could give it a fair review.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding parsnips, my store was out. I put this on to cook at midnight so it would be ready by lunchtime. When I woke up the house smelled amazing.  This recipe took all of the 12 hours stated and tasted pretty darn good. I'm not sure brisket is something I want to work with often but I was glad to have the opportunity to work with bison and this cut of meat. This definitely had good flavor and my son thought it was awesome.

This was easy and delicious. I browned the bison before placing in the slow cooker, and used pot roast instead of brisket. Otherwise I followed the directions. I used a honey beer, and the sweetness was nicely balanced by the bite of the horseradish. My teenagers loved it, and I will definitely make this again.

The bison was tender and fell apart while I was cutting it.  It had a nice, mild taste and excellent texture.  I wasn't crazy about the beer flavor.  I think next time I would leave it out completely (or add some kind of beef stock, if a liquid is actually needed).  The bison had a really great flavor, though, so I will rate this recipe fairly high.

Delicious and easy to prepare.  I did the Bison separately in the crock pot and roasted the root vegetables, (beet, potates, parsnips, onions,carrots) separately with a little olive oil, garlic and rosemary.   Everyone loved the apricots; sweet and savory.

Amazing Recipe !! , this is the first time I use a dutch oven, or a bison brisket...
I have to say that the flavor of the root vegetables adds a great flavor to the meat of the bison, especially with it's low fat content of 2%.
however, I think the beer amount was too low, I followed the receipt cooking at 325 F, and the moisture was almost gone from the pot at the 8 hour mark. I didn't do anything about it, because it was too late, but I think it needed at least twice the amount of the beer, with probably a cup or two of beef broth.

my experiment could have been a lot better, but the idea is great and remarkable, the more you make it better you get at it.

I added less than a cup of dried apricots (dark-brown color, not the orange ones which had sulfur added to them to maintain the color) and It wasn't that much present in the taste of the meat...

I frequently eat bison (all different cuts), LOVE root vegetables, snack on dried apricots and used a beer that I knew and loved but that did not translate into a cohesive recipe.  While the bison brisket turned out tender and edible, the root vegetables were overly sweet in an odd  way.  Since I've made bison stew many times with the same beer and it tastes great, I feel like it comes down to the apricots ruining the taste of the whole dish for me.  Now its possible to leave them out and perhaps this dish would be better.
