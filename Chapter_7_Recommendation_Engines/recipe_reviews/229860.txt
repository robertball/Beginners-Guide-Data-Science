CAREFULL WITH THE FLOUR!!!

It's not expressed enough how important a SOFT dough is for this recipe or any other cinnamon roll recipe. Add your first half of flour as per the video, mix, then slowly and patiently use only whats needed. I used nearly half LESS flour at times, and sometimes I used all the recommended amount, the kind of yeast, water temperature room temperature, humidity etc etc etc all effects this... USE CAUTION WHEN ADDING FLOUR!

Taste & Awesomeness is 6 stars, however the directions need to be more accurate with the flour... ONLY AS NEEDED!

I mixed these up a couple days before Thanksgiving and froze them, right in the pan after the 2nd rise but prior to baking them. Took them out of the freezer to thaw then popped them in the oven the morning after Thanksgiving. They were perfect! Moist and light, just the right texture with lots of cinnamon flavor and just a hint of pumpkin. My tip, as with any yeast bread, don't overdo the flour and don't overwork the dough. You need just enough flour for dough to come together and only use enough when rolling them out so that they don't stick. The dough should be soft and pliable. The only thing I changed was the icing, used my own recipe for cream cheese icing and sprinkled chopped pecans on top instead of the pumpkin seeds. I will definitely be making these again.

I LOVED these pumpkin cinnamon rolls, but had to mark it down for the flour and bake time changes.  I cut the flour down almost a cup, and also baked it for only 15-17 minutes, just until light brown.  Follow the rule to stop adding flour when the dough pulls away from most of the bottom.  You can always add more flour (even after it has risen until doubled in size), but once you add too much you can't take it out!  I also used a cream cheese frosting instead.  Tip: I used evaporated milk in place of heavy cream since I didn't have any.

made these today to go with my giant pot of chili... got a few things that are wrong with the original recipe.. i tried making it as written, except using bread flour instead of all purpose. after 3 cups of the flour was added the dough was looking pretty dry. i added the rest of the flour, another egg and about 1 tbsp of milk to moisten it up a bit more. i dont know if it was so dry to begin with because the different flour... also used 1/4 cup milk and no sugar instead of water with sugar added to proof the yeast before adding the wet and drys. the frosting is incredibly drippy. i like thicker cream cheese frosting on my cinnamon rolls so i adjusted it in an attempt to thicken it up.. didnt work too well, but did help a little. i also only added about 1 tbsp of milk to the frosting. 1/4 cup would have definitely been too much. baked at 350 for 15 minutes and they came out perfect. given all the changes i made, its a 5 star recipe.. but as written, it was a huge pain in the butt... had i not changed anything, it'd most likely be a 3 star at best so thats how i will rate it.

This was my first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls, and they turned out great. As per the other reviews, I was careful with the addition of the flour and don't know exactly how much I ended up using. I baked them for about 25 minutes. Will definitely make again.

I loved these, but I made three kind of major changes. The first is that I didn't butter my baking dish. I used parchment paper. I know, some people would hate this, because it takes away some of the richness, but the brown sugar still carmalized, and I would probably do this again. Second, I had some left over flour mix, half corn meal, half almond meal. I used this when I rolled it out into the large rectangle. It's a great mixture for rolling. Third, the icing - I wanted it a little thicker, so I put 8 oz of softened cream cheese in my stand mixer with 2 cups of powdered sugar and mixed them well. I started to add milk slowly, to get the thickness I wanted, but had a crazy idea - the heavy whipping cream. I started adding that instead, and then mixed on 8 until glossy. The result was the most luxuriant, delicious frosting I have ever made. Everyone in my family loved it, and I will for sure be making this frosting again.

I've tried the other recipe Chef John has on his blog, and I liked that one much better. The only complaints I have regarding this recipe, is that the flavor of pumpkin is very subtle.... almost non-existent. The other complaint was my fault.... I left them in the oven maybe 3 to 5  minutes longer than I should had.

I didn't use all of the flour, just added the second part as needed while I kneaded the dough.  I loved the rolls themselves and have gotten some rave reviews.  I made them at night, and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  To help with the rise in the morning, I put the rolls in a cold oven, filled a shallow pan with boiling water and set it underneath for 30 minutes.  Then I took both pans out and preheated the oven.The reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the icing.  Mine came out lumpy both times I made it.  Next time, I am definitely finding a new icing.

I can not believe these have almost a 5 star rating. The texture was majorly off. These are edible and that's all... There's not enough instruction on the flour amount to use or the icing. My icing turned out lumpy, I should have gone with my 1st instinct to whip the cream cheese then add SIFTED powdered sugar then add milk as needed. The recipe states to just whisk it all together?? This needs major revamping. Iv'e made cinnamon rolls before and they have never turned out this bad.

I made this recipe exactly as written except used half and half instead of heavy cream just because that is what I had in the refrigerator. I also only added about 3 tablespoons of milk to glaze because it looked like it was getting to thin. I thought the rolls were dry so the next time I am going to try this recipe with less flour and less baking time, like others have suggested. The cinnamon filling was perfect. I will try to make these one more time.

These were a bit of work and are really only good for a short time.  The frosting gets a little weird after a few hours.

I have made this several times. It turns out perfect all of the time. When I don't want the pumpkin and just want a cinnamon roll, I leave out the pumpkin.

Really great if you watch the amount of flour you add, not necessarily as written.  And caramel icing poured over the top when they are hot makes them amazing!

how did you get the pretty round ones, mine went splooch when they were getting cut like a real soft loaf of bread.  Oh they were super tasty, no doubt about that, just I have no idea how to cut them so they STAY round; they were more into the shape of logs or biscotti than a roll.

It definitely called for too much cinnamon. I also added a little more pumpkin than called for. But overall, it was good.

I followed the directions. The dough didn't rise. They came out like brick bisquits! I don't own a bread mixer, so it was really hard work to make this. I am really disappointed.

This was wonderful!  I made it for Thanksgiving morning and it was a hit.  I glazed the rolls rather than the coating of frosting in the pictures and then garnished with pumpkin seeds.  Will definitely do this again!

These Cinnamon rolls are delicious and deserve 5 stars with a few minor adjustments. Note, these do not taste like pumpkin, but they are still probably more flavourful than a typical cinnamon roll. 

First of all, use less flour. This recipe calls for two additions of flour - 2 cups in the initial dough, then an additional 2 1/4 cups of flour. I only added 1 - 1/4 cups of flour for the second flour addition rather than the 2 1/4 cups (to make 3 - 3 1/4 cups of flour for the entire recipe).  If you add all the flour this recipe calls for, your dough will be too tough and dry. I added the second set of flour very gradually (about 1/4 cup at a time).

Secondly, I used a different icing recipe. I like thicker, richer icing. I mixed the following in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment:
4 oz cream cheese
~1 cup icing sugar (generously)
~1/4 tsp of vanilla extract
33% whipping cream - added until the desired texture and thickness is reached (~1/4 cup)

Finally, I added raisins to my filling. I soaked the raisins first in warm water for 10-15 minutes to plump them up. This is a key step in my book for nice raisins in cinnamon buns.

I hope this helps with your cinnamon roll endeavours. My final result was absolutely delicious.

This turned out to be the most tender cinnamon rolls I have ever made!  I had to add a good 1/2-3/4  cup of flour to make this dough gather into a sticky ball.  I feel like I have finally gotten the hang of making cinnamon rolls--whatever the recipe.  The less flour, the more tender--but it needs to come together as a dough.  It really depends on the moisture content of your pumpkin puree (mine was homemade--maybe wetter than canned) and even the humidity of the day.

I disregarded the frosting and used the "ooey-gooey cinnamon buns" recipe that is also on allrecipes--to make these into sticky buns.  3/4c brown sugar, 1/4 c butter, 1 T cinnamon melted in a pot until bubbling.  Place in bottom of 9x13 pan with 1 cup chopped pecans.  Place sliced cinnamon rolls on top and bake.

First batch I made the mistake of listening to my mom instead of going by the recipie by using margarine spread in place of the butter and the mixture not only went everywhere because of the water content, but also created crunchy slight burnt shell on the bottom of the rolls. However, the next attempt I used butter and they came out perfect! Sometimes moms don't always know best.

Made these twice now and loved them both times- those of you who made these and did not like the recipe should give it another try I found this the least complicated of all the cinnamon roll recipes.  Whenever I need a recipe I look for Chef John first, his recipes have never turned out badly also the videos are always making me laugh! Very entertaining!!

These were delicious. My husband doesn't even like pumpkin but has asked for them again. I used homemade pumpkin instead of canned so added some cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. They were super moist and so flaky. These will become a weekend favorite

Turned out beautifully... Maybe very slightly drier than I would have liked, and the pumpkin seeds on top looked nice but did not compliment the flavor or texture.  Made exactly as stated with the amount of flour recommended, except allowed dough to rise several more hours while I ran errands. Heated cream cheese 15 seconds in microwave to incorporate into icing. Next time I may add nuts and/or raisins to the filling.

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this.  The amount of flour is outer limits!  I only put in one cup of the 2 1/4 cups that should have been added and the dough was still much stiffer than my usual cinnamon roll dough, and I have made my fair share of cinnamon rolls.  The end product was dense and doughy.  I baked them over the stated amount of time, and in my oven I usually go 5-10 minutes less than a recipe says.  I liked the idea, but the finished product was not good.

I made these last night. My husband said they were so good that no one else can have any!  I was careful with the addition of  flour keeping to dough a slightly sticky soft consistency. I followed the recipe to the letter only making one addition of several drops of maple flavoring to the glaze this sent the flavor over the moon!!! The rolls themselves were lovely and soft. Just be careful to bake them until only lightly browned. My new favorite roll. Thank you Chef John!

overall I love it... it's a good recipe, just needs to be retyped. there's no mention of using the egg, or the cream cheese in the instructions so I just had to assume they were for an egg wash and it was meant to be cream cheese frosting and not a glaze. once I reasoned out what it was meant to say in places, it was wonderful

The end result is delicious, however, I can't really taste the pumpkin. Next time, I will just use the regular recipe since it doesn't really change the taste that much.

The icing was too sweet, and not cream cheesy enough.  I couldn't taste the pumpkin, and it was to doughy.  (But I don't like bread/muffins/cake or most doughs.)

I really enjoy chef John's recipes.  But, on this one I wish that I would have read the reviews first.  I am not an experienced Baker and the flour needs to be added to consistently. I followed the directions and added the required amount which must have been to much for the rolls did not rise as they should have.  So follow the advice of the other reviews.

This was a nice change from the ordinary cinnamon roll!  Easy to make and I did use less flour than state(the ONLY change I made). Will definitely? keep this recipe and make again. Thanks Chef John for sharing :)

Still waiting for mhm dough to rise but I agree with other reviews --go for a soft dough that is tacky and watch your flour.   I added the 2 cups then maybe another 1/4 cup of flour, then added water (tbs at a time) to get a good consistency. These will be Awesome!!

The pumpkin flavor is light and the spices are balanced.  The only change I made to the actual cinnamon rolls was I coated the bowl with butter instead of oil and I only used about 3.25 cups of flour. 
Cinnamon Rolls are a bread and with any bread (not designed for your glorious bread machine) you add flour gradually as you knead and watch it.  If your rolls came out dry, you likely added too much flour. 
The only other change I made was to the frosting.  The provided cream cheese frosting is the usual I use (classically delicious). However I wasn't sure  what I'd use the remaining pint of heavy cream for so I replaced the milk with it.  Gives it a slightly richer taste but not enough to choke anyone.
