Based on the other review, I cut the veggies smaller and roasted them first for a bit before I added the chicken. I also marinated the chicken with the Harissa (Trader Joe's has the paste) for about an hour but probably needed longer. The Parsely/Orange mixture is a must and finishes this dish with a nice flavor. Overall, it was a nice subtle taste - I probably would've added a  it more salt as I would've preferred a more flavorful and more Harissa to the chicken.
