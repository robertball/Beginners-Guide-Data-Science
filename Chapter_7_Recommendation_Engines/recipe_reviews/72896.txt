Am lost for words to describe quite how good this was. Let's just say that 2 adults behaved like kids and actually licked the plates so as not to miss any. One small thing - couldn't get the sauce quite thick enough, so just added a little cornstarch with no detriment to flavour. Many thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful flavours in this recipe - definitely restaurant quality. Suitable for those dinner occassions when you want to make an impression without having to do too much perparation or spend a longer time cooking. The only change I made was to add some cornflour to thicken the sauce.  This is going into my 'very special recipes' folder. :)

Absolutely excellent.  I substituted chicken stock for the fish stock and left out the Scotch and it was still amazing.  You can almost have this on the table in the time it takes to boil water and cook the pasta.

Scotch and heavy cream. Separately, they are two of my favorite liquids. Together, they are the most amazing cream sauce my tongue has ever met. Thank you, Emma Jay. Thank you.

Lovely delicate sauce. I would not add any thickeners. Can be used with random amounts of left over jarred salmon.

I tried substituting half and half the first time, but it made the sauce a bit runny as I expected. Wonderful taste especially when I followed the recipe. My only problem was getting the whisky to flame. I have found that the sauce tastes best when made with a reisling, though using your favorite white wine is probably the best bet.

This is a good dish, but not something I'd make again unless I had the ingredients on hand. The individual components of the recipe made me expect something much better than what it resulted in. Some changes were made... Two cups of water with a fish bouillon cube instead of fish stock and the leafy part I'd saved from a bulb of fennel in lieu of the parsley. I also added a generous pinch of nutmeg. I did not have Scotch (which is one of many kinds of whiskey) so I used an Irish whiskey. It would not light, however. Perhaps lighting it before adding it to the pot would be better. I did need to add cornstarch to the sauce to get it to the right consistency. This might be better with some spinach and a stronger, more melty cheese than Parmesan.

I would give this 4.5 stars, but I'm just going to round up to 5 :p  This is VERY good being as I'm eating it right now. I think it needs a LITTLE something, but I'm not quite sure what it is. A tad bit of garlic salt? Either way, it is freaking amazing as is. Very good recipe!

I had to substitute several items that I did not have on hand but it still turned out great - I sure it is wonderful when you follow the recepie exactly!  I used half & half instead of cream, chicken broth instead of fish stock and Worchestershire instead of the scotch.  I will definitely try it again with all the real ingredients next time!

I had a fillet of smoked salmon that didn't look likely to be used in the near future, so I started imagining a pasta recipe for it. Found this one which looked pretty close to what I wanted. I had some asparagus that I wanted to use and thought it would go well in the pasta sauce. I cut the spears into thirds and added them at the same time as the salmon. I left out the whisky as my husband hates the stuff. I might try cognac next time I make it.

There definitely will be a next time; we really liked this recipe, though I did change it slightly. I chopped shallots instead of onion and garlic, and used tagliatelle instead of short pasta. I under cooked the pasta and added it to the sauce after only cooking it down for ten or fifteen minutes; thus the starch from the pasta helped to thicken the sauce, but it wasn't too thick. Next time I make it, I will have the asparagus separate as a side dish - the smoked salmon totally overwhelmed the delicate asparagus.

Love it! 
You can use the ingredients exaclty as listed and have a different flavor everytime. I like a heavy peaty Scotch, but if I am cooking for other folks, I can tone the smokey peaty flavor down. On a scale of 1 to 5, this is a 10.

Some of the reviews made me nervous about this, but I think it turned out great and the flavors were terrific! I made a number of modifications that I think improved the flavor and reduced the cooking time (TLDR: added garlic powder, dill, a little salt, cracked pepper; only 1 cup heavy cream; finished cooking the pasta in the sauce for a few minutes at the end). Full instructions: I used a big pot to boil a full package of penne, which I undercooked by about 2-3 minutes (still just a little hard in the middle). I put it in the colander to drain and then used the same pot to heat some olive oil, brown the chopped onion, and added the wine/chicken broth. At this stage, I also added a little salt, dill, garlic powder, cracked pepper to give it some extra flavor. I boiled/reduced about 1/4 of it (~10-15 min), then added the flaked smoked salmon, followed by 1 cup heavy cream (you can add more, I wanted it on the lighter side). Once this was boiling, I put the pasta back in and cooked the pasta in the sauce so it absorbed some of the flavor for a few minutes. The starch from the pasta also helped thickened the sauce, although if you wanted it to be really thick/creamy you should thicken it a little with cornstarch before adding the pasta. Finally, based on the reviews (and my limited time tonight!) I omitted the scotch step - I didn't see how that was going to light! The flavors were great, and it makes excellent leftovers too since the pasta sits in the sauce more!

Very good.  Makes for great leftovers. 

I will say it definitely takes a lot longer than 45 min to cook. The time it takes to reduce the wine/stock and cream takes quite a while. Worth it if you have the time.

Phenomenal. Restaurant-quality. So many layers to the dish's flavor. The flame will be quick, blue, and relatively small. Not a towering inferno so don't let that dissuade you :) Keep the parsley on the side and just add to taste before eating. The dish may look dry at the end - it is not, the oils coat everything well. I'm drooling just writing this review.

I was disappointed in the way this recipe came out. The only thing I changed was to add mushrooms and asparagus because of the lack of color and vegetables in the original recipe. Anyway, the scotch did NOT light as the directions said, no matter how we tried! The taste at the end was akin to tuna noodle casserole-- very boring and bland. I had to add some capers to the leftovers to give it some flavor.

Very interesting taste, loved it! My scotch never lit on fire but maybe it hadn't reduced enough. I did do some modifications, i added italian seasoning and dill to the mix and my husband and I finished the whole dish! No parmesean needed, maybe my smoked salmon was salty but I felt adding the parmesean would have made it too salty
