I didn't strip the pheasant, just left it as legs and breasts. I was very weary of the vinegar w/ the milk, and after frying the pheasant I stuck it in a 350 deg oven for 25 min to make sure the pheasant was done, since mine was thicker than the recipe states.  Seasoned with garlic salt, pepper & Johnnys.  My husband said that this was the best "fried anything" he'd ever had.  I'm looking forward to doing this again.

This was my first time EVER making pheasant and I'm glad I found this recipe to use as a starter. I tweaked it just a bit. I crushed the crackers in my blender and added a few spices to the mix: thyme onion powder garlic powder pepper and some fresh rosemary and basil that I still had left in my garden. I also left the legs and breasts intact. It was so good my family said we should open a new franchise with it: KFP (Kentucky Fried Pheasant)!! They loved it!

Excellent! The advice about serving size is correct but this recipe is definitely worthy of more than 3 stars. It is quite good.

This was tasty enough.  But I knew that two breast halves would not feed four people. Use one breast half for every serving.  It would be wonderful in a cold sandwich!!

Wow! Tastes like chicken! My family had a fun time eating it! My husband made sure that we "watched out for bb's" to make it interesting. My son even wanted me to pack some in his lunch for school the next day.... what fun boys are:)
