I had visions of a Chinese style dish. However, it became overcooked and way too salty. I would recommend more stir fry style of cooking ( hot and fast)to keep fresh color of veggies. To cut the saltiness, make a cornstarch thickener and then add soy to taste and color preference.

I was pleasantly suprised by how good this recipe was.  I thought it may come out too dry but it did not and was very good.  Even my picky husband really liked it.  The only additions I made was to add fresh mushrooms, celery and snow peas (instead of frozen peas).  This recipe will definitely be a keeper.

This is wonderful.  It tasted even better the  following day.  Next time, I'll add a dash or two of Tabasco to the sauce.

This was scrumptious!  We cut back on veggies and it was still enough to serve 6!  WE also mixed the eggs and added with the rest of the liquid ingredients.  No need to scramble eggs separately.  Did not taste like left-overs, tasted like a yummy dish! will certainly make again.

This was pretty good.  You do have to watch the amount of salt, would be best to use low sodium soy sauce in this recipe.  Mine came out just ok, any more salt and I wouldn't have eaten it.  Apart from this, it's a good recipe, and can easy adjust to use the veges you prefer.

Nothing negative to say about this.  I cleaned out the leftover veggies and added snow peas.  It was very tasty!  I feel like it may be good with pineapple added.  Has anyone tried that?

This recipe is awesome for leftover ham.  I followed the recipe exactly and won't change a thing the next time I make it.  The vegetables taste so great!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  It ended up disappearing so it must have been good. A great way to use up the leftover ham and get the family to eat more veggies.  I plan on making it again.

This was a very tasty meal.  I would have liked to rate it 4.5 stars - but not an option.  The only thing I will do differently the next time is to use fresh blanched green beans rather than canned beans.  A great recipe to use up leftover ham and I had a bunch of broccoli to use also. This was an attractive dish to serve with all of the vibrant colors.  We had it over sticky white rice.  Thanks Ruth of sharing your recipe.

Ok so good way to use up leftovers but there was absolutely no flavor. Needs some spices or a different sauce. It basically is a very bland stir fry. I have no idea why the eggs were included

This is a delicious recipe! I made it with regular chopped onions - instead of the green onions, frozen stir fry vegetables, and I used cooked brown rice. I added the rice into the pan with the rest and cooked until heated through. This is a dish I will make again!

As one who regularly makes stir fries and fried rice, this was an odd attempt to create something in the middle. As long as you're using a wok pan, why not stir fry the vegetables instead of simmering them for 15 minutes (which will leave them half done). Four cups of ham for that amount of vegetables is ridiculous. I used half and it was still plenty. The addition of two eggs in this concoction gave no advantage to the dish. The vegetables chosen fit somewhat with the ham, but the wok, soy sauce, rice and egg showed an attempt to do something Oriental, and it failed, given that it was more like a church supper casserole. I wouldn't recommend it.
