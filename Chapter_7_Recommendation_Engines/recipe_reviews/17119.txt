Some of my family can't eat spicey-hot foods, so this recipe is ideal for them. I used boneless breasts and boneless thighs, so I reduced the heat to 350F, but still baked for 1 hour.

It had some promising flavors, but it was too bland. I added loads of garlic powder (close to 2 tsp, I think), some pepper, some minced garlic, and a dash of soy sauce and scallions- much better. Oh, and it still needed salt to taste- even with soy sauce.

This was ok. It was pretty bland. I would not make it again.

This recipe seems promising, I know I shouldn't rate beforehand, but I won't be able to create this for a while and I will forget. It seems that it will be a bit bland if made per recipe requirement, but the basic concept behind it seems awesome. Though this dish would be terribly blasphemous in my house I would have to alter it to have loads of garlic which might make it just right :) I don't make food without garlic in it.

This recipe is quite good. My preference is for spicier, but I wanted to make it as close to the recipe as I could. I used fresh ginger instead of the ground. The next time I make this, I will change it a bit, but as it is written, it has good flavor. One change I would make for sure is to bake uncovered for the last half hour with the skin side up. Soggy skin is a travesty.

The flavour was just not there. Next time we make this it will be modified to add some sriracha sauce for  a little boost and some soy sauce.

Love it! It very tasty and moist.  My family told me to leave this recipe handy.
