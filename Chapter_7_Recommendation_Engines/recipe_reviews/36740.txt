Well, I forgot that I have lost my taste for Italian flavored sausage, and that taste ruined this dish for my wife and me.  It was overpowering.  I might try it again with a sausage without the Italian sausage flavor.

This was excellent, especially for lunch on a Sunday.  The only thing I changed was to use olive oil instead of cooking spray.  I only used two bell peppers which were more than enough.  I highly recommend this recipe, it was so full of flavor and hearty.

Loved it, loved it, loved it! I couldn't believe how easy, yet delicious this was. This is an instant favorite. Oh, I should add that I used brats that I had on hand. I don't think it would matter what kind of sausage you used - it is an excellent dish. thanks!

This recipe was tasty and I added some onion powder to the potatoes and put the veggies on skewers with some olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt & pepper.  They came out great that way.  it was easier than slicing them up afterwards.  I just dumped the veggies and potatoes into a bowl and it was all ready to go.
