If you are looking for a southern style Brunswick stew, you will be highly disappointed.  If you follow the receipe without doctoring, you get a stew that is the same color as chicken and rice soup and a taste that is just very plain.  Doctored it up by adding pork tenderloin, BBQ sauce, Frank's Hot Sauce, tomato puree, a can of tomato soup and several other spices becasue it was very bland and just the wrong color.  I would call this a northerner's interpretation of a deeply southern dish.  Get a different recipe if you are looking for a Brunswick stew similar to those served in southern BBQ joints

This stew has so much flavor. The store didn't have the salt pork, so I substituted it with several slices of bacon. I put three slices for the initial boil, then put another slice in for the last hour. Excellent

This was very good. I substituted salt pork with virginia bacon and the lima beans with blackeye peas. I omitted the corn, and added diced green bell pepper and beans. Definitely a keeper!

I used meat from a smoked boston butt to make this.  I also used canned potatoes and added some BBQ sauce to thicken and give more flavor.  It turned out great!

I made a huge pot of this for a dinner I cooked at the church last night.  I had a bunch of barbqued chicken left from a previous dinner and I boiled this to make it easier to remove from the bone.  I used this liquid as the base for my stew.  The only other thing I did different was I used canned potaoes and chopped them up and I used speckled butter beans instead of lima beans.  Everyone raved about it and the entire pot was consumed.  I increased the recipe to feed 50 people.  I will diffently be making this again.

This is a good recipe, but the Brunswick Stew that my Virginia grandmother made was sweet.  This is the same basic recipe as the one she used, but if you want it to be authentic in flavor, try adding a tablespoon or two of sugar.  With buttermilk bisquits and sliced vinegar cucumbers, you will have as authentic a Virginia supper as you could ever hope for.  Oh!  And don't forget the sweet tea!

Lots of room to personalize. I used crumbled chirizo instead of salt pork and added okra to the veggie mix. I used "planned over" chicken breast which I added at the last minute just to warm through. Served with hot biscuits...GREAT easy, autumn dinner.

I subbed bacon for the salt pork and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and breast meat. While this did not taste like the Southern Brunswick Stew I'm used to, it did taste like a chicken vegetable soup. Not bad, but not something I will fix again.

Wonderful!! Tastes just like the recipe they serve in Colonial  Williamsburg! Be careful though, this recipe makes a lot. Next time I'll adjust the recipe to make 8 servings for now I will freeze the leftovers. Otherwise, I used leftover roast chicken, replaced the potatoes with a cup of uncooked rice stirred in during the last 30 min of cooking and left out the lima beans (its a texture thing). All modifications were minor preferences otherwise I stayed true to the stew which was delish!! I will definitely make this again.

I added a can of chicken broth, a can of tomato soup, and a can of cream corn. I also had 4 lbs of chicken to thickened it up. It tasted almost exactly like what I remember it tasting like growing up in VA.

This  is a great recipe. The only change I made was to add a glug of ketchup and a squirt of BBq sauce to sweeten it.  Thanks for posting! I use this recipe often.

This was very flavorful but I did have to add a can of tomato sauce and more seasonings. I love the mix of 2 meats. In my family recipe we only use shredded chicken.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and have received clean plates every time. This gem currently resides in my recipe book. The only change I made was in preparing the chicken the day before. It saved me so much time on cook day.

A great recipe as is. I combined research from earlier versions (1887 & 1925) and made the following adjustments: I used the same amount of bacon instead of salt pork; 8 boneless - skinless chicken thighs (so I could use the skin and bones for stock); about half of the tomatoes and twice the limas; added about a teaspoon and a half of paprika. I also wanted it more stew than soup so I used half of the water called for. As a stew for the "less well off" the vegetables (and their amounts) are very flexible...use what you like and what you have.

Finally a Brunswick stew without all that nasty barbecue sauce!  I have always made it this way.  I never knew Brunswick stew contained barbecue sauce until I started researching recipes.  For my tastebuds this recipe is how I grew up eating it and always will.

Made eight servings...subbed one link fully-cooked chicken sausage for salt pork, one-third cup brown rice for potatoes, one 15-oz can chili-ready tomatoes for whole tomatoes...had them already opened in the fridge.  Used one large onion ...one and one-half cups...which, for eight servings, was equal to the amount of corn and lima beans used, so that seemed like plenty to me. Used chicken legs and thighs...three of each.

My first experience with brunswick stew was from a Weight Watchers cookbook in the 1980s.  Being the Californian that I am,  I made several changes, mostly to cut some calories.

I used 4 slices of bacon, rendered in a dutch oven.  Remove the bacon for another dish (cobb salad?), saute skinless chicken pieces in the bacon fat.  Remove chicken and cool so you can more easily cut it off the bone.  Now you have a base of bacony chicken bits on the bottom of the dutch oven that will enhance the flavors (don't forget to remove the extra fat, you only want the brown bits on the bottom of the dutch oven).

I use fresh green beans, fresh peas, chopped bell pepper, onion, celery and potatos.    One important ingredient is missing from this recipe - Cayenne pepper (1/8 tsp).   

I cook in a 300oF oven for an hour or longer, and thicken with some tomato paste at the end.  

Adjust cayenne, salt and pepper to taste.

When I do it again, I'm going to oven roast the chicken.  Roasted on the bone imparts a better chicken flavor.  I use chicken thighs instead of pork, as we don't eat pork in our home.

This is the best Brunswick Stew recipe I've found. Wonderful flavor and very hearty. I do use frozen white corn instead of canned yellow. This is that "go to" recipe year after year for delicious Brunswick Stew!!!
