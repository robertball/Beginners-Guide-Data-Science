My store didn't have bok choy so I subbed cabbage instead. I like the flavor better anyways. I threw in some water chestnuts and mushrooms because we love them. This was okay but  I didn't love the curry flavor mixed with feta. In fact, I didn't think the feta flavor mixed well with anything. Sorry but I wouldn't make this again.
