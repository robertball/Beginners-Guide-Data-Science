Mine came out really well. They were medium to dark brown in color when I was done. They were a bit soft off the tray but finished crisping up they cooled. A little tsaziki sauce to dip them in was good too.  I think they tasted more parmesian the second day.

It's a bit labor intensive with so many chips from one zucchini but if you like chips but not the carbs, this is a good recipe to try.

Although the taste was good, this recipe takes a very long time to make and there is very little product when finished.  It might be fun as a "project" but for a daily recipe, I could not recommend it.

"chips" ended up soggy.  I put them in a dish and heated them in a microwave and we ate them, but I won't make this one again.

Do not cook at 220.  Too low. Will only be soggy.  Tried at higher temp (375) and worked well but watch closely, they burn easily.
