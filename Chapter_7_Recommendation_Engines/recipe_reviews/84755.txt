Because of the eggs in the hollandaise sauce, when baked, it becomes souffle-like, there really isn't much "sauce". If you don't have much "sauce" after baking, either reduce the veggies or increase the sauce. Reducing cooking time also may help. I double the sauce and use a 1.5 qt casserole dish. If you didn't like my dish before, please try it again using my suggestions. Please do not substitute the vegetables and then give my recipe a bad review, that is comparing apples to oranges.

This recipe has become a family staple. I steam the carrots and cauliflower and then pour a prepackaged b√©chamel or hollandaise sauce onto the veggies in an oven dish. I sprinkle the top with crushed crackers and/or bread crumbs. No butter, no salt. it comes out superb. Thanks for the recipe!

This was definately A+, everyone at our Christmas dinner loved it! Some people added a little more hot sauce, and still raved over this one. We will definately make it again for our next family get-together.

my family raved about this recipe. I added several more kinds of veggies, such as onions, bell pepper and mushrooms, so had to make a little more sauce. It was delicious!!!

I used a package of Hallandaise sauce and added:  1/2 cup wine and an extra bit of milk (I wanted to double the sauce package..worked well), and into the sauce i put diced garlic chives, roasted red pepper seasoning, shrimp, cheese, ,lemon juice and used melba toast and croutons oiled up with salt and parsley for the gratin topping. I also used zucchini because it is a moist veggie.....turned out FABULOUS..i can imagine this being quite tasteless without the my fixings...and 2 tbs hot sauce...yum!

Fantastic!  I took the suggestions in previous reviews and doubled the sauce.  It was rich and creamy and really complimented our Christmas ham.

Doubled the sauce as suggested by another reviewer. Otherwise there would have been no sauce at all. We didn't find it very zippy, but we're Texans and, admittedly like things to be extra zippy. The dish simply wasn't to our liking at all. Thanks anyway.

Great recipe! I used Ritz Crackers and thought it was an odd idea to put Crackers on top, but it turned out great and was very tasty.

I just made this recipe, which I followed exactly.  It sounded to good when I read it.  But it turns out there is no creamy sauce.  Actually there is no sauce at all, not to mention no flavor.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I read and re-read this recipe to make sure I did everything right.  I don't think I will make this again.  Sorry.

This is a wonderful side dish.  The only change I made was to use packaged hollandaise sauce

Very good recipe!  The hot sauce touch really works.  However after reading some of the reviews and like most experienced cooks do, i change the recipe a bit.    I roasted my cauliflower first then added the carrots. After reading other commenters' reviews, I used pre-made hollandaise sauce because i didn't want the eggs to set. I did however add fresh herbs, lemon juice, wine, salt and the HOT SAUCE!! such a difference!  GOOD IDEA!  Any who my friend who is a vegetarian loves it as well as everyone else!

This one is good, not great.  It was a nice change from some of the same old veggie side dishes I usually make.

I loved this recipe so much, that I was left craving it weeks after!  I'm making it again tonight.  It's tangy and buttery, and the vegetables go very well with each other.  I sliced the carrots on an angle, and boiled them with the cauliflower...a great duet.  And I used a wisk instead of the blender and my sauce came out just fine.  A new favorite side dish!

A nice recipe I will use as a base for the future.  After reading the reviews, I realized it would have no sauce, so I took it out a bit early, which is why it's not as browned as it should be in my photo.  Would have been nicer properly browned.

Used Panko, not crackers. Also, no blender needed, whisk works fine.  Next time I will add some milk to stretch the sauce, maybe reduce the butter and lemon a little.

This was so popular in my house that the two of us probably could have had this for dinner on our own!  I'll definitley be making this again.  

No changes were made to the recipe, other than I didn't drag out the blender to make the sauce, it was just me and a whisk.

What did I do wrong?! I seem to be the only one who has tried it and didn't like it! I made it today; seemed like a lot of work. One bite, UGH. Had to take my plate and scrape it. I re-checked the recipe just now,and I did not leave out anything. Zero stars, actually.

This recipe worked its purpose.  That being I was searching for a recipe that combined both carrots and cauliflower.  I was researching the anti-cancer benefits of some vegetables for my website  and in my research found the huge benefits of both (putting them together was based solely on their alphabetical spelling).   Recipe worked decent.  I would definitely kick it up a notch with possibly a chopped poblano pepper.

I doubled the sauce as others suggested and added a few extra shots of the tabasco. I served it at Easter and it dissappeared! People told me they loved it. However....I personally found it had a strange after taste that made it less appetizing to me. Maybe it was the eggs. I liked the vegtable combination and the buttery cracker topping complimented the dish. Very creamy. Not sure if I would make it again, though, due to the unpleasant after taste.

I just used a packet of hollandaise sauce for this recipe, and it came out good on the cauliflower, but I did not like the sauce with the carrots.  Not a good combination.  Other than that the recipe is a good one.  I'm always looking for something new to do with cauliflower.

Please review the recipe, especially the liquids involved.  I followed the published precisely, and there was virtually no sauce to be found.  An earlier comment about doubling the sauce portion seems to be needed.

We tried this recipe substituting Broccoli for the Cauliflower. No one for Thanksgiving liked this. It seemed too heavy.

This was ok, but not as good as I expected. The sauce almost completely disappeared. I wouldn't bother making this again. Thanks anyway!
