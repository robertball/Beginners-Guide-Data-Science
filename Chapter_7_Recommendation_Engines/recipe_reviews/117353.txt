I rated this recipe a 3 by my taste alone - my sister made this recipe for our Thanksgiving Dinner and I love Pineapple. I don't think she varied any from the recipe but I can't guarantee that. I was a good recipe although she did make it second time with a graham cracker crust and it tasted way better to us. I guess its all in your taste.

I've made this a few times.  It's good in the summer for a refreshing dessert.  I use Crispex for the crust.  But I increase the cereal a bit and decrease the butter.  You just don't need that much, it makes it too greasy.
