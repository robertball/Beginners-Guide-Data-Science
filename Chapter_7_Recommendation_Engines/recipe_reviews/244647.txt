These sugar cookies are soooo good, you could eat your finger with them! We made them for Christmas gifts. If you aren't planning to share them, you may want to half the recipe as we got over 48 cookies. Flattening them with your hand yields the best results. They come out crunchy when thin but so chewy good if a bit thicker. Overall, this recipe is a winner. My family loved the coconut flavor and it's simple enough that my 9 year old did most of the work. Enjoy!

Forgot to add when I wrote this, my grandma always colored some sugar and when the cookie was mostly cooled she'd gently pat some on and shake off the excess.  It was a nice bit of added color.

I think when she made it she used margarine, as they'd always spread out in the oven.  I do remember them not spreading one time when I used really cold butter.  I've been softening my butter before baking lately.  I made these last night and didn't have to flatten them.  I think how much they spread depends on how warm/cold your butter is.

These were delicious. Simple to make, few ingredients.. good stuff. Only thing... mine did not flatten out and I wanted them to be thin, so make sure you flatten them before baking if you want them that way

I thought the cookie was way too sweet and greasy; seemed like an awful lot of butter when I read the recipe, but, I followed it.  Disappointed.

Turned out perfect! We had leftover coconut that was put to great use in these cookies. Since the butter was already salted, I didn’t mix in the tsp. of salt. Also doubled my cooking time to 20 minutes! They came out moist, chewy, and delicious!

I loved this cookie so much, and I am definitely making it again! My only complaint is that the cookies were very buttery and sugary. Other than that, these cookies are spot on!

I followed the recipe exactly right, these are awesome! I read the reviews and one said to flatten out but I didn’t and they came out flat. I’ll be making these more often.
