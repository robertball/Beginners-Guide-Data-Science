I have made this recipe several times for my family and they love it.  You can change out the seafood for whatever may be on sale and to just change it up a bit.  I also used less leaks in my recipe and liked it better.  This is a really easy recipe to tweak to your taste.  The flavor is amazing!

I made this for Christmas Eve last year and I am making it again. We love this so much with a fresh loaf of baguette!

For me, this needs to sit overnight.. I also add lobster just before serving to hold flavor and preserve texture..

Excellent recipe. I served this on Christmas eve because my son in law can not eat any meat. Everyone loved it. I skipped the lobster (since I could not find any except real lobsters) and put in clams instead.
I doubled the ingredients and it worked out great.

Changed up the seafood for what I had on hand (shrimp, mussels and cod) and it was lovely.  Very flavourful.  Had a crusty loaf of bread to mop up the broth.  Will make this again and again with different combos of seafood and fish.

Turned out OK.  A little too much wine taste for me to make again.  You will need to add lots of pepper, and we used ocean perch instead of snapper based on availability.

It was great. I added red potatoes and carrots. 
My wife lived it!
