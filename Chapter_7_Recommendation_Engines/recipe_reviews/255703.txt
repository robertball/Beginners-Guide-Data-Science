The flavor is okay, but the rosemary is hard to get through.

These were the bomb! I did add some parsley just for more color but other than that made as written. Watch them closely in the end. They start to burn quickly and due to the oil they've soaked in they keep browning even after you take them off the heat. With that being said, the really really brown/burnt ones taste awesome and I liked them even better. Play around with them until you get the brown taste you like.
