Made this tonight, I cut the recipe in half because I only had 5 cups of apples.  It wasn't mentioned what size of pan to use so I used a 8 X 12 class dish, which was fine but I should have stuck with the original amount of ingredients for the topping.  Other than that, it was just what I was looking for in taste.  I would definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as written and loved every bite. My only question with the recipe was if the apples should be peeled. So... I peeled them. Also I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9×9 square pan.   I have searched for an apple crisp recipe with this type of crust/topping for years. Thick, crunchy and buttery topping. Yummmmy.

The only thing is, there is no mention of what pan size. I put the apples in a 13x9 pan and there was no room for anything else so i had to split it into another dish 8x8, and then split the rest of the ingredients accordingly. I think you could cut a third of each ingredient out and you would have enough for a 13x9 pan.

Omg ! This recipe is excellent we just made a couple of minor changes I like to add pure vanilla extract to certain recipes this is one of them and because I didn’t have any nuts in the house I didn’t add nuts I’m sure it would be excellent with nuts as well this recipe is really fine the way it is here I believe serving this one with vanilla ice cream on top is sure to please everybody this recipe is a real keeper I’ve added it to my collection thank you Fern!

Not enough fruit for topping, next time I would double the fruit.  I cut sugar in 1/2 for both and it was still plenty sweet!!!

This apple crisp was awesome.  Not difficult to make.  I liked the addition of the oatmeal in this recipe compared to others I have used in the past.  Paula  R.

This was delicious! The only change I made was adding pumpkin pie spice to the batter and to the whipped cream topping - homemade, of course!

I didn't add butter to the apples, I thought the 2 sticks in the topping would be enough and it was! So delicious! I will certainly be making this again!

I tend to reduce the sugar in most recipes and I felt this recipe definitely needed it. The fist time I made this crisp I reduced the sugar in the topping to 1 1/2 cups and it was still good. The second time I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was perfect!  I have gotten rave reviews for this crisp either way and thanks for sharing!

Nice and easy. I added almonds to the crumble. It was very tasty but a bit too sweet for us. I will try this again but with a third less sugar in the crumble and maybe more oats.
