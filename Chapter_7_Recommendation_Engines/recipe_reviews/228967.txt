Delicious! I had been wanting to make these since the picture was posted. The only change I made was to use brewed coffee in the date/chocolate mixture instead of water. Loved these!

They tasted great, mine turned out pretty crumbly so not my favorite to serve.

Finding a large bag of dates in my cupboard, I set out to find something to make with them.  Finding this recipe and discovering that the dates were mixed with chocolate, I thought my family would like them as they are not huge date fans.  I made as directed, but changed the pan size to 11 x 7 because I did not have an 8 x 10 pan.  I also made half the pan with walnuts and the other half without for my son.  The results were a nice chewy bar with a crunchy topping.  I thoroughly enjoyed the end results, but I love dates.  The guys liked them, but kept asking what the middle layer was.  I told them “chocolate” but they knew there was something else in there.  I just kept them guessing.  I thought they were repeat worthy, the guys said “once is enough”.
