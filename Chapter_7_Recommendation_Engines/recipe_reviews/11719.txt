I have been looking for this recipe for a long time.  There is a restaurant in Pittsburgh that severs this as an appetizer or a main dish.  They top it with lump crab meat. WONDERFUL and this is just as good!!!

I found this recipe to be a really great base for chicken florentine that we get from a local restaurant.  I sauteed some chicken cut up into bite size pieces with some of the shallots and fresh garlic, along with some baby spinach and prepared the sauce in another pan, added some fresh parmesean and romano to thicken, then once the sauce was ready added the chicken spinach mixture.  My in-laws and husband went NUTS! It still goes together quite fast and heats up well for leftovers. Thanks for a good recipe

This recipe is great with a couple whole smashed cloves of garlic, couple dashes of cayenne pepper, ground black pepper, and crushed red pepper, in addition to the nutmeg.  It's extremely rich, a real treat.

My family absolutely loved this recipe!
It was served as a sidedish to grilled salmon and they just couldn't get enough of it!
You really have to keep a constant eye on the pine nuts when browning, they will burn quick.
I made 1 lb of (thin spaghetti)pasta, no leftovers.

I made this last night and in the end, we thought it was just ok.  I did change a few things, but I don't think it would have affected the flavour of the dish.  Instead of using angel hair pasta, I used spaghettini as it's all I had.  I also didn't use clarified butter (but I didn't add the other 2+ Tbsp of butter).  As well, I used half and half cream instead of whipping cream.  The dish was ok, but not worth the fat and calories IMHO so if I do make again (which is debatable), it won't be for awhile!

I didn't have clarified butter, so I subbed regular butter and left out the extra tablespoon.  Also we added some grilled chicken.  Awesome flavor, so rich and creamy - better than restaurant.  Leftovers not as good, otherwise this would have been 5 star recipe.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I both agreed that it had no flavor and we would not want to try it again.  I made this recipe as directed but added chicken and spinach as others had suggested and also to add a little nutrition to the calories.

quick easy and a nice change from the usual red sauce. We added some poached chicken breast to make the dish more filling for the basketball player in the family. I will make this again

While tasty, this seemed a little bland for such a huge amount of calories (jeez!).   Used way less pasta and sauce for two people...  Added spinach and chicken for the boyfriend.

The 2nd dish I attempted cooking (college student) and another good one! I used skim plus milk and a touch of cream instead of all cream, and it still turned out well. Obviously not as creamy, but it didn't bother me. Even my brother ate some and enjoyed! (he is notoriously picky!) I like the nutmeg, it adds a nice touch!

It sounds great but can 1/4 lb of pasta be accurate?  That's very little pasta for the amount of sauce and I don't think it's enough for 2 entrees.

I followed the recipe on this except for adjusting it to 2 servings and adding just a little parmesan cheese to the sauce.  We really liked it a lot!  I think that for people who thought it was bland that they just aren't used to the taste of this subtle type of recipe.  I did clarify the amount of butter called for, but I'm not really quite sure what purpose it served. I probably would have to compare all butter to the clarified to see what difference it makes.  I would definitely make this again.   It's good to serve this along side something that is relatively free of fats.  By the way, if you let the pasta sit in the sauce for a little bit of time, the sauce gets soaked up just fine.  Thanks for this recipe.

I liked it but I did add fresh herbs to bump up the floor factor.  Great basic recipe but were Italians so we push the herb envelope.  Will definitely make again an I want to try it with another pasta next time, I am thinking orzo for a good side dish.  Thanks

WOW. 
The pine nuts are truly the king of this dish. They permeate everything and go so well with the heavy cream. High-fat and indulgent meal. Paired it with garlic cream cheese bruschetta.
