Oh so absolutely yummy! I've fixed these several times now, and have tweaked it a bit in technique. I slice the parsnips into coins, and I microwave them until they are still slightly firm. Then I prepare them as directed in the recipe. Large batches don't allow for a single layer, but they caramelize just the same - just takes a bit longer. Red pepper has been added on occasion, which works well with the flavor as well. A keeper recipe â€“ thanks!!

This is the only way my mom fixed parsnips when I was growing up. Browning in butter caramelizes the natural sugars in the parsnips. Loved them then; love them now!

Great way to prepare parsnips. However, I find it unnecessary to boil first.  I cut them into slim French fry size pieces, and they cook up fine in a combo of olive oil and butter.  Takes maybe 12 to 15 minutes. A few will get very dark brown, but this is delicious, and when I make them I try to make sure that some are getting dark brown. Some thyme leaves are a good addition.  This is a superb way to fix parsnips and a good way to start cycling potatoes out of the menu rotation. Great with fish.

Never had parsnips before...well, knowingly anyway. 1st attempt, took reviewer's advice & cut the parsnips into coins & microwaved them before frying. I overcooked them & they were too mushy to crisp up in the frying pan. Yuk! But totally MY fault. I decided to give it another go (after the bad cooking memory faded with the family enough for them to at least TRY them again), this time making sure they were still firm before the fry step. What a difference! Super tasty, carmelized, addictive, and I have redeemed myself from the Great Parsnip Debacle. Now a staple in our regular rotation. Thanks for a great, simple recipe (I somehow managed to mess up) that got us to try a new veggie. (even if it is fried yummy goodness, lol)

Tried and true! I made these almost a year ago for one of my favorite 5 year old kiddos since we had gotten on the topic of root vegetables. He LOVED them as did I! They reminded me of my mom's, which is saying a lot. Her recipes went with her so the "Grama's" title caught my eye, as did the peppery, yum. If you have never had parsnips before, this is the way to try them and get the intended flavor!

Bought a bag of parsnips by accident (was trying to get horseradish roots) and was desperate for a recipe to use them up. So happy I found this! I'll be intentionally buying parsnips from now on! I cut the parsnips into 1/2 inch strips. I followed the recipe with the exception of simmering the parsnips for a shorter period of time -- the were tender after about 5 minutes. While they were on the skillet with butter, in addition to pepper, I added garlic salt and garlic powder. Tasty side dish! They taste like a combination of fries and carrots.

Easy, tasty, and almost as versatile as french fries. Used fresh, coarsely ground garlic pepper seasoning which gave this dish more in-depth flavor. If having one, use a deep skillet to avoid cleaning a saucepan and skillet. A very good recipe for busting out of a rut if feeling limited by serving the same veggie dishes over and over again.

I grew up eating parsnips this way and I absolutely love them!
*Do not over boil them. If they get mushy they aren't very good. They need to be a bit firm as you stick a fork into them after boiling. They will cook just slightly more as you fry them in the butter. 
*They naturally have a sweet taste so we love to add lots of salt. Great sweet salty combo.
*They get bitter if burnt. Fry to a medium golden brown to bring out the best flavor. 
*Cut them about 1/4" thick. Round is great but long cuts are easier to fry and flip.

DELICIOUS!!!!!Made this just like the recipe the first night but only used 1/2 of the parsnips as that is a lot for one person.  The next day I put the leftover cooked parsnips in the chopper and chopped them us and made cakes out of them (like potato cakes) fried them in butter with salt and pepper and they were also very good.

1st time I ever cooked or ate Parsnips...  and we liked them a lot.  I cooked some mushrooms, onions and carrots with them, just in case it turned out we didn't like the parsnips, but no need... they were delicious on their own.

I love roasted parsnips and was looking for another way to serve them.  This was very good. I threw the strips in a hot pan with half a cup of water and covered the pot until the water evaporated and the parsnips were tender.  About 5 minutes or so.  Then I added the butter and also some onions as others suggested.  I left the pan uncovered as the vegetables caramelized.  YUM.  The parsnips were so sweet and tasty. Fantastic with my husband's favorite meatloaf. 

I also learned a lesson about buying parsnips.  There was one really big one in the mix and it was too tough.

Delicious! Had a nice contrast between sweet and peppery. I sauteed some onions in with mine. Would definitely make again.

Quick, easy and great!  I found this recipe while searching the site for a recipe using parsnips and turnips.  I followed a tip from a reviewer and microwaved my chopped & peeled parsnips and turnips first.  The used Smart Balance to saute them with 2 chopped green onions.  Seasoned with salt & pepper, a small splash of lemon juice and about a 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar.  My family does not like much sweetness on veggies so I had to make it white sugar and use just a little.  I cooked until they were well caramelized.  So delicious!  DH & I both loved them and all 3 teens ate them up.  We had none left.  I think I might like to try adding baby carrots sometime.  Thanks charisue!

I followed the recipe to a T and found that after boiling the parsnips, they were a tad mushy. Frying them somehow made it worse. I also thought the flavour was rather blah. Maybe with more seasoning I'd enjoy it.

I substituted a spice blend (Northwoods Fire) for the salt and pepper.  It added paprika as well as a blend of peppers.

Pretty tasty and I've made them twice now. Never realized I actually like parsnips. Before this I'd always and them prepared in a sweet manner and I much prefer this savory method.

I made these as suggested. They were delicious; my husband loved them. I would have preferred them a bit more firm, but  I did enjoy them.

There was not enough flavor in this recipe for me. This was my first time eating parsnips, other than a parsnip purÃ©e, so it could be that I am not fond of them.

Good flavor and easy to make. My mom and all 3 kids liked these! I'll boil a little less time next attempt, so they are still a tad firm before frying. But even after "over boiling" then pan frying they were still delicious. Finding this recipe and carrot parsnip purÃ©e on this site, parsnips make for a frequent side dish at our dinner table lately!

My first time eating and cooking parsnips. Definitely will use them again, but I'll try something different. My 6 yr old was skeptical. I had her eat them with ketchup like french fries and that helped. I think next time I'll skip the boiling step and see what happens. Water takes away the nutritious aspects of food so I'd rather skip it or steam them. Good recipe though.

I kept checking as I cooked and took out of water early because I did not want mushy.  Moved to skillet and browned!  Thought this could take place of french fries!  LOVED IT!

This is absolutely delicious. I've never had parsnips before and finally decided to give it a try. Almost like potato fries with a little  sweetness to it. I added a little Cajun seasoning to it to give them a bit of a kick. Loved them!

I struggle with getting my mother to eat vegetables, a 92 y/o is not unlike a toddler. I didn't try these for her just thought they sounded interesting.  When she picked up the parsnips like she would a french fry we all just held our breath. She loved them and had seconds as did we all. We will have this often as it is easy and tasty!

Very tasty use for parsnips - made me a parsnip fan. It seemed like there's another layer of flavor that could be developed. I'll try adding something additional next time I try this. However, with that said, this recipe is very good without any additions.

Made a half batch of these... I experimented a bit with various ways of slicing the parsnips. Regardless of whether you slice them into coins or strips, about a half inch cut seems to cook the best. Thinner than that gets a bit overcooked, thicker doesn't quite crisp up as it should. Think of about the size of steak fries, and you should be set.

The flavor was good, but not great. Obviously, this is a very simple recipe... and for those that like parsnips on their own, you probably won't be disappointed. I'd suggest something to give it a flavor that you enjoy. Some garlic or onion sauteed with the parsnips, or some smoky mesquite flavor to accompany a steak... This recipe was good, but just feels to me like it is missing something. A little more of some seasoning that you like, and this recipe should work great!
