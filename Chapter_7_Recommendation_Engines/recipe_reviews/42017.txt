I'm surprised I was the first person to review this dish - it's extremely easy and attractive, and can be very healthy.  I'm afraid I didn't use the name brands;  instead, we used Ragu Light Parmesan Alfredo sauce and boxed linguine.  But for the first time in my life, I ate the entire serving of salmon - the other flavors and textures make it more palatable than usual.  I used chicken broth rather than wine, and a little dried parsley instead of fresh (fresh would have been much better though).  I don't recommend finely grated carrots;  regular grated ones are more attractive.  This recipe is definitely worth a try!

This tasted great and looked impressive. Not extremely hard, but the first time if you have never poacked salmon before may take extra concentration. Salmon took a little longer than recommended to cook.
