I made a few alterations to this basic recipe and the result was the most amazing, hearty, homemade lentil soup I have ever had.  I used 4 cloves of garlic sauteed with the onion and 2 bay leaves for 5 minutes.  Then I added all the other ingredients, plus a generous shake of parsley and paprika.  I also added 1 chopped fresh tomato and cut spinach (stems removed).  I had to add extra liquid to compensante for how much liquid the lentils absorbed.  The cumin is what absolutely makes this soup!

This soup is SO good and SO easy!  I just made it and can't wait to dig in.  Here's what I did a little differently from the recipe thanks to the suggestions of my fellow reviewers: I used 3 cloves of garlic (never too much!).  I thinly sliced 3 carrots and added them.  I used the entire 6 oz. can of tomato paste.  I dumped in a bunch of garlic powder.  I sauteed the garlic and onions together for just a few minutes before I added everything else.  I simmered the soup for 45 minutes, and it made it nice and thick.  This recipe is a total keeper.  I plan on keeping the ingredients around all the time.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

This is a delicious and simple soup!  My friend Katy cooked this up for me after work on a Friday evening.  I always think of soups as taking hours to cook on the stove, but not true!  This ready in a snap.  She used whole cumin which I ground with mortar and pistle and also added carrots which I thought was a necessary touch for color as well as character.  But the flavor was plentiful and the ease was astounding.  Served with thick slices of rustic bread and hard cheeses on the side, this is a delite!

Like others, I made a few additions - a whole can of paste, sliced carrots, doubled garlic, doubled cumin, 3-4 pinches each of dried cilantro and curry powder.  Didn't saute anything first, just threw it all in the pot.  SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.  Thank you for this amazingly easy and healthy recipe! I'm going to make this all the time. (By the way, the additional tomato paste also adds more color to the soup so it's not as drab-looking, if you care about that sort of thing!)

Taking hints from other reviews, I snazzed up the seasonings, and got a hit!  When my teenagers will eat a hearty healthy soup like this one, and ask for seconds, we have success.  I sauteed the onion, 4 cloves of garlic, and two bay leaves in olive oil, then added the rest of the ingredients, including two chicken bullion cubes, since I keep my homemade stock on the plain side.  I salted and peppered throughout the cooking process, as needed, and even added a dash or two of garlic powder at the end.  I think one must look at this as a soup that one must season to taste.  We love it!  I served it with Italian bread bowls, from this site; YUM!

Instead of the tomato paste, I made it with a cup of spaghetti sauce and added chopped celery, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. My husband loved it, so did I!! Easy and delicious.

Lentil is the easiest bean soup to make and this is one I will continue to make!  I sauteed some bacon and removed leaving the grease to saute the onion, carrot(added) and garlic.  I added the remaining ingrediants along with some tumeric.  After 35 minutes I used the boat motor to puree.  Stirred in some chopped spinach.  Topped with sour cream, bacon pieces and chives.  Yummy!

very yummy and ridiculously easy! I added the whole little can of tomato paste, so I don't know if that's a 1/4 cup. I also simmered it down to a stew-like consistency (about an hour more on way LOW). Excellent served in bread bowls. Will definitely make again.

This turned out really well.  I have a few things I changed.  When adding onions to soups I find my kids complain about the texture of them so I GRATE them into the oil first!  You get all the flavor but without texture issues with picky people.  Also added a bit of garlic.  After that turns into a sizzling yummy paste I add chopped celery (3+ stalks) and 1 tomato.  I used 2 5.5oz cans of V8 in place of paste, didn't have any on hand.  Doubled the cumin.  Added fresh cilantro.  Added 1 cup dehydrated spinach (I add that to almost EVERYTHING!  LoL).  Added water as it cooked down.  Next time I would add carrots, I didn't have any on hand this time.  I would also cut back on cumin to about 1 1/2 T and add some chipotle tabasco sauce.  Perfect amount of salt even with none added.  Served with sprinkled grated parmesan cheese.  Next time will also sprinkle fresh ground pepper.

Great quick and easy soup, I made it in 5 minutes. I started a diet today and thought it would be a nutritious and good.  I am Greek and we have a family lentil soup that we sprinkle red wine vinegar on, very good also.  The lentils tend to discolor after I put them in the frig, any suggestions?

Definately easy enough to make but certainly not a 5 star soup. It's a just ok soup for us. That's not saying it's not good it just isn't wow. Thanks I'm sure I'll make again

This recipe was great and best of all, easy and fast. I adapted it a bit by putting in extra cumin (my husband loves this spice), extra tomato paste, and some smoked sausage. I was actually worried about the salt content since I didn't use anything that was low sodium, but it turned out great, no extra salt was necessary. 

This will definitely remain an emergency-meal recipe for my household (you can keep everything you need on hand and freeze extras). Also, for those of you who know people on those low-carb diets, this is a quick meal that is balanced and even better than balanced once you add a bit of extra protein.

Such an excellent recipe.  I appreciated the
short list of ingredients and very little preparation.  The soup is delicious, and even better the next day.

Great soup! Easy and healthy as long as salt is kept to a minimum. I used 3 cloves garlic, 1 1/2 tablespoon cumin, and a shake of curry. Also sauteed onion and garlic for a few minutes in olive oil before adding to the soup. Yum!

oh, this is so good! so easy!  i think it's pretty good as it is, if you use condensed enough chicken broth.  still i would used a little more garlic, 3~4 cloves, to add more flavor, and yeah, def. add some CARROTS, otherwise it looks unappetizingly dull.  i threw 4~5 bay leaves just to see how it would turn out. well,,, with or without it.  thanks for sharing!

I added the carrots for appearance and, just because the spice bottle decided to dump it all, added 2 T. cumin.  It was needed.  This was nice but I have a better but similar recipe.

I followed the directions almost to a T.  I left out the cumin and added three extra cloves of garlic which I sauteed with a spanish onion in EVOO before adding the other ingredients.  I also added a very healthy amount of black pepper and increased the tomato paste to about 1/3 cup.  By doing that, it is my own personal recipe that I've been using for years and I find it's flavor to be just delightful.  Sometimes, I throw in a couple of chopped potatoes or I serve it with ditalini pasta.  Just because a recipe has few ingredients, it does not mean that it lacks flavor!  Ask Mark Bittman from the New York Times as this is his personal philosophy.  Lastly, this recipe (w/o the cumin) is how lentils are prepared by many cooks in the mountainous region of Abbruzi in Italy.

This was delicious!  I made it with vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian, it was very flavorful and hearty.  I probably used about 1/2 cup of paste.

Very tasty. I added carrots, onion, and frozen chopped spinach, and it came out great! I did need to add quite a bit of extra liquid though, which meant I had a huge amount of soup. It freezes and reheats just fine.

I really liked the simplicity of this soup...I made a batch early this morning and have been nibbling small bowls of it ever since. I've been under the weather for more than a week, and this is great comfort food. I gave it four stars rather than five because it lacks 'wow factor', but it will definitely be part of my regular soup rotation. Like other reviewers, I doubled the garlic, used a whole can of tomato paste, and sprinkled in a bit of curry powder and coriander, although I can't really taste the last two.

I added a couple of Tablespoons of my favorite barbecue sauce. My husband loved the flavor. It was over powering a hint of sweetness and smoky flavor.

for those that say lentil soup is BLAND:  I think you have to grow up eating this soup as a child.  CARROTS & CELERY (make sure to include the LEAVES) are a HUGE help along with bay leaves.  I add sausage or keilbasa or ham for my meat loving husband.

Delicious, and so easy!  I added the full can of tomato paste as some other cooks suggested, and supplemented the cumin with some cayenne pepper.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and added some water with a bouillon cube.  I had four stalks of celery, so I chopped those and added with the onion.  I will definitely be making this again.

This soup has a nice light, 'clear' broth, just the way I like it, but the seasoning leaves a little to be desired. I would leave out the cumin, which is overpowering, and go with some freshly ground coriander seed instead.

Awesome!  I never use exact directions so I just added everything to taste, using some tomato sauce i had frozen, and a curry spice mix I made a couple days ago in place of just cumin. I made it three times in two days (lack of groceries) and it was delicious every time. Once I even added a tablespoon or so of cream and it gave it a richer feel and lighter color.  Very tasty, easy to adjust, healthy, and so cheap!

cheap easy and quick, this one is a winner when I'm all out of groceries at the end of the week. I like to jazz it up with a few extra vegetables.

This soup was great and was a big hit for my picky eaters- they even came back for seconds! I doubled the garlic and used a can of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato paste. I also added some shredded carrots for extra color and flavor. I served it with warm pita and a salad. This is an easy soup to play around with to fit to what you have on hand as well as to suit to your own taste. I'll be making this again!

This is a must for everyone's recipe repertoire. Here's another variation: first use water instead of chkn broth & to the basic recipe add: 1 med diced carrot, 1/2 diced yellow bell pepper, 2 more cloves of garlic(total of 4), 1/4 t. pepper, 1/2 t. turmeric, 1/8 to 1/4 t. cayenne, one large bay leaf and use 2 T. cumin seed ground with 1 t. sea salt instead of ground cumin.  After about 35 minutes, taste, add salt/pepper if needed, remove the bay leaf and puree with a hand blender. Serve in bowls with a little swirl of EVOO and a sprinkle of freshly chopped corriander/cilantro. Enjoy!

This recipe is AWESOME, and really fast and easy (I'm a student). To add a bit of flavour and some kick, I put in some cilantro, a bit of curry, extra cumin, and some tabasco sauce. It is now a favourite of my roommates who were initially skeptical of the lentils.

I scaled this recipe for 40 people and used it in a Community Kitchen group (a bunch of people getting together to learn cooking skills).  It was a big hit - and very delicious.  Best part was that it's easy!  Thanks!

I make this recipe every cold season. I absolutely love this soup. the only thing I do to tweak it is I add sausage to it for extra flavor. The next day, after its had time to sit and is really thick I put the soup over rice. Amazing! And it's super easy to make.

The basic soup recipe is really good. But I too added a few of my own things to give it more flavor. I added a little cilantro and shredded cheese on top before serving. You could also add a dollop of sour cream think that would be good. But I hate having to come up with good lunch meals. This is a cheap, easy alternative. I will add a small salad and will be a complete meal.

I've been making this for years now! I always use the whole can of tomato paste (because what would you do with the paste that remains??), add chopped carrots, and add whatever greens i have on hand (spinach, kale, etc.).  This soup freezes great, so I always make a giant batch and stock my freezer with several containers of it for the future.

I made this today after scouring through several recipe and am glad I chose it.  The only thing I did differently was that I used tomato sauce instead of paste (all I had on hand) and I used 2 tsp cumin instead of 1 T.  I also added some salt and a little pepper and it was marvelous.  I kept enough water on it to keep it from burning, but cooked it thick to make it more like a stew and added a can of sliced carrots (drained) at the end like the picture showed.  Great!

Great for people who don't always have an incredibly well-stocked kitchen. You can add most veggies and a variety of spices to this soup and it'll still be delicious. I recommend adding salt in particular.

Tasty, I had to substitute tomato sauce for the paste because it was all I had on hand.  I threw in some fresh chopped spinach.  I'm sure the soup will be even better tomorrow.

Key words - no time to cook,  Everything in-house.  Added home grown carrotts, put up in my freezer, topped with loads of parsley & cheddar cheese.  Perfect for last nite.  Busy holiday time, 26 degrees.   6 people including 4 teens, no leftovers.

Great flavor, especially considering the short list of ingredients.  I literally ate this for five days in a row, it's that good!  I substituted ketchup for the 1/4 cup of tomato paste, but that was the only change.  I will make this again.

Oh yeah, my family ate this up! (And what else can make lentils really tasty, but classic lentil soup?) Follow the notes, up the garlic, add carrots, use the full can of tomato paste. I added a shallot as well, as those are a new favorite of mine. Yum.

Very easy very good! I put some EVOO in first and sauteed onion, 4 cloves of garlic, carrots, celery and a bay leaf as suggested. I then added the lentils and the chicken broth, 1 whole can of tomato puree, frozen peas, cumin and a little salt and pepper. I think it cooked for longer than 45 min...1 hr. maybe. Garnished with queso fresco and cilantro YUM. Even my son who doesn't like lentils said they were good! Thanks Molly for a yummy recipe!

This is an excellent simple recipe for those cool autumnal evenings. Also good for busy parents or college students because it takes little time to prepare and the ingredients are cheap, and the dish is healthy. Next time I try it, though, I'll probably add another half an onion and another clove of garlic.

So very simple and satisfying! Thank you for this recipe.My kids don't care for lentils, but were running to the kitchen when they smelt this cooking.  I added ham to my soup for extra flavor and all my kids tried a bowl.

Changing the Cumin to Curry was the key for my family!  I add a bit more garlic and use a large can of diced tomatoes instead of the paste.  This recipe is on our regular rotation.

This was fantastic! I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the garlic, sauteed the onions and garlic, added a little curry and 2 bay leaves, and used vegetable base and chicken bouillon instead of broth. This is going on my short list.

Good, basic recipe. To make it gluten free (for a friend) I used water instead of broth, added celery, and more spices. I also added about a cup of dry brown rice. To make it husband-friendly, I then added cooked chicken and a package of taco seasoning. Okay tasting, but very healthy!

I LOVED this recipe! I ended up using 2 large cans of chicken broth, added fresh spinach and also added some black and white pepper.  I barely changed the recipe. It was wonderful!  This recipe will be a staple for me!

Looking at the few simple ingredients you think this is going to be a little bland but it's very tasty,filling and comforting-real winter warming,I had to add a bit more water but obviously that's personal taste.yum!

Yum!  Super easy.  Here are some things I did differently.  I used 4 cloves of garlic (instead of two).  I sauted the onions and added one chopped carrot.  I also added two pinches each of curry powder, garlic powder, and chille powder.  In addition I added three tablespoons of salsa verde (Trader Joes!).  Next time I would have used less broth (maybe just 1C less).  The next day it tasted great-better than the day I made it.  Note: I used chicken bullion, which i found made the soup tons more flavorful.

This was a really simple, quick recipe that tasted great with a few additions.  To make it vegan, we used vegetable broth, thinly sliced carrots and celery, and 4 oz tomato sauce rather than tomato paste.  It's great with a hunk of toasted, chewy bread!

AWESOME!  I added some chunks of potatoes, and I added some chopped carrots.  I also dumped in a little extra of the tomato paste and went heavy on the garlic.  The soup is hearty and fabulous!

A good first experience with lentils. I cut this recipe in half and got about 5 servings, but I did use 1.5 c. of veggie broth and 6.5 c. of water. I sort of combined this recipe with Lentil Soup I by William by adding potatoes (in my case, sweet potatoes), celery, carrot, and onion. I think I'll add more cumin next time--it's one of my favorite spices! By the way, I added the veggies once the lentils began to boil.

Great, simple recipe. I do not use salt in cooking, so I found this to be pretty salty. Next time I will use 3/4 or 1/2 the broth that the recipe calls for. I added a little curry powder and sauteed the garlic & onion (I used 2 onions) in some olive oil before adding the other ingredients.

I had some tonight right after making it, and placed the leftovers in containers to freeze for school lunches. :) I ate mine with a roast beef sandwich and some chickpea salad, yum!

Very good basic recipe, but I added ingredients to enhance texture and flavor--carrots or celery, etc.  Also tried adding small amount of mild Italian sausage.

This is really good & really easy, a definite plus. I work at home & have it for lunch frequently. I add some sliced carrots when sauteeing the onions & garlic. Easy to tweak but very tasty as is. The lemon juice & sour cream topping is surprisingly good. I also top with some shredded cheese. Yum!

This was super easy, and good... I added more garlic and as other readers used a whole can of paste.  I also threw a can of diced tomato's in and diced up a carrot.  I added curry and this is yummy and great for a quick meal on a cold night.

Easy, healthy and lovely. I made it vegetarian/vegan by using a vegetable boullion cube instead of chicken stock. I used extra garlic, shook in the cumin w/o measuring, and on impulse added a little salt, black pepper and a couple drops of liquid smoke. The flavor of the broth was warm, comforting and incredible - it'd be a great vegetarian replacement for chicken soup when you're ill. I'll make this again, ill or not, with extra onions and probably some carrots and celery in there too.

I made this soup in less than 5 minutes.  I also used already steamed lentils which cut the cooking time in 1/2.  It is delicious, quick and easy.  I also sautéed the onion and garlic with a little olive oil 1st and added the cumin at that point to bring out the flavors.

I tried this on a whim...I wanted something tasty, healthy and easy. This fit the bill PERFECT.  My daughter and I like the health benefits of legumes but aren't too crazy about pinto beans.  We look forward to  this soup, I make it at least once a week. 
Of note, I usually don't keep tomato paste in the house, so I used a couple squirts of tomato ketchup. It sounds bad but it's really good. That was my only variation.  Love this recipe to bits! :D

This recipe is delicious, but the 5 stars is for ease of preparation! This is perfect after a long day of school, is really fast, and keeps well in the fridge. I made it exactly as instructed with the tiny exception of using 1/2 cup of tomato sauce instead of 1/4 cup tomato paste, but both seem just fine to me. The cumin MAKES the recipe and stands beautifully by itself, but you may salt and pepper to taste if desired.

I have made this soup a couple of times and both times it came out great. I did find that I needed the full can of tomato paste but other than that this recipe can be very adaptable. First time I made it as written second time I added a sliced carrot in there. Very yummy and a keeper forsure. I like how hearty it is!

This was very good and very easy as I had everything on hand.  I did have a couple carrots, celery, and a turnip to use up so I threw those in along with a couple bay leaf.  Hubby always looks for the meat in meals but I felt this soup was filling and satisfying without it.

Nice, cheap and filling but still needs that umph that is lacking. I ate it with generous squeezes of lime juice. I'd put some chili next time for variety.

This was a decent base lentil soup but doesn't have much flavor.  If I knew what to add to give it more flavor, it would be a great start, but as is, left me looking for more.  I will not make this again, but will keep looking.

This was a somewhat yummy soup, but not that nice to look at. I know it shouldn't matter, but the consistency was a little mucky and the lack of color/presentation made this dish less desirable to cook and serve than other lentil soup recipes.

I didn't care for this.  I enjoy cumin, but not in this soup.  Besides the cumin flavor, this was bland.  Also, if you don't cook the lentils about 10 minutes in water before adding to this or any recipe that has salt or tomatoes, the beans remain undercooked unless you cook them all day in a crock pot.

I really wanted to like this because it was so easy to make and pretty nutritious. However, it was really bland. I did add carrots and extra tomato paste as other recommended, but it was still lacking. Sorry.

Very good soup recipe although i made a few adjustments...i diced up some celery and carrots in addition to the onions and garlic and sauteed those before adding the broth an lentils...i added some black pepper and paprika, and used petite diced tomatoes instead of the paste for a heartier feel. Cookers beware: the lentils took about 1.5 hours to really soften as opposed to the 30 minutes stated in the cook time. At 30 minutes my beans were pretty crispy still. Very very good soup in the end though...and i think it will be even better tomorrow :)

This soup is awesome.  I made 1/2 batch with veg broth as my daughter is a vegetarian and used red lentils and added carrots and celery - what an easy and tasty soup to make!

This soup is so good!  I've really never made anything like this but it was very filling and tasty.  I added a bit of parsley and garlic but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think I might use a bit more stock next time as it was really thick, but all in all I think this is a fantastic fast, easy, healthy meal.

This is a nice, easy, tasty recipe.  I followed the recipe closely (including the lemon spritz at the end) and added grated romano cheese over the top before serving.  My husband liked it and this is a keeper! Make sure you rinse the lentils first to avoid the possibility little stones in the soup!

I've made this recipe three times, and I'm in love with it :). My friends and family all thought it tasted like something right out of a restaurant! I, however, did make quite a few alterations as suggested by other reviewers. I halved the recipe, because it makes a lot, and used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth. I used 3 cloves of garlic, chopped it up with some onions, and sauteed it in olive oil with a couple bay leaves until everything was tender and brown. I also found that after using low sodium broth, you will need to add some salt to compensate. Also, add some dried parsley to it. It really tastes great in the soup. I loved the recipe! Thanks so much!

fairly tasty, but I think I cooked the lentils too long, they are kinda mushy, I guess 45 mins was too long.

Good soup- perfect for a chilly evening. I did not have tomato paste so I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and it worked out great!  I also added some crushed red pepper since I like things spicy.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Incredibly easy, very filling and extremely healthy recipe.  We added some onion and carrot, along with some hot pepper flakes and wowee!  Delicious!  I will keep some of this made up for busy days where I have to be outdoors in the cold weather all day and have no time to cook.

Kind of boring and flavorless.  Even with the alterations I made (carrots, a few bay leaves, more garlic, a jalapeno pepper, ground black pepper), it was decent at best.  I had to add way more than the required amount of broth for it to become remotely soup-like.  Giving it three stars because it may be something I return to.  It does provide a good base upon which you can probably build a delicious dish.    By the way, this recipe makes A LOT.

As is, the soup is good but a bit bland.  However, it's supposed to be quick and easy, and it was definately that.  It is really a great base to make a more complex soup with too.  For me, I wanted a bunch, so I added about 2c of rice and another 5 c of water with corrosponding boullion (used water and boullion instead of stock since I don't have it).  Sauteed onion and garlic together, added more garlic, added a carrot and extra spices - season salt, pepper, some italian seasonings and crushed red pepper.  Made a TON, enough for the week for lunch, and was very good.

This is a wonderful base soup. I just made it essentially as the recipe called for except I substituted the chicken for our ham bone leftover from Thanksgiving dinner. I like to make my own healthy, dry packaged mixes (you know, like rice-a-roni), and this is definitely a recipe I will convert.

Took other reviews advice on adding carrots and sautéing the onions in a little olive oil first.  Also used 3/4 teaspoon of garlic powder (sadly no fresh cloves in the house).  And lastly had to use one cup of red lentils and one cup split peas since that's all I had on hand.  Came out wonderfully and is the most filling soup ever.  A great base to go off of, thank you for sharing!

This soup is quick, easy, very filling and a good healthy protein source!  To make it even easier, I just throw all the ingredients into a crock pot at once, and cook on high for a few hours, until lentils are soft. 

I like to dress it up by adding a small dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheddar cheese to the top of each bowl, provide optional hot sauce, then serve with a crusty roll!

Yum! I made the following changes. I sauteed 1 tbsp garlic with the onion first, added half of a chicken breast, diced, until the chicken cooked. Then i added maybe 1/4 cup of white cooking wine and let that reduce a bit. I removed the chicken, put in the rest of the ingredients, cooked it according to the directions, and added the chicken at the end. I also added 1/2 tsp of curry powder, which I thought was a nice touch. Also, if you don't want your soup to be dull, rinse the lentils under lukewarm water till the water runs clear.

We thought this was great!  I don't like cooked carrots, so left them out and added celery, green pepper, onions and wasn't very careful about how much, I just dumped.  Also used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the paste.  Used boullion cubes & water rather than any prepared broth and it turned out wonderful.  Even hubby who is not a big soup eater liked it.  Easy and cheap with no meat to worry about.  Very good!  Thanks!

Cheap, easy, and healthy - now that's my idea of a good recipe :).  I had never made lentil soup before, and I doctored this recipe to suit my tastes and it turned out really well.  I followed some reviewer suggestions and sauteed the onion with twice the amount of minced garlic before adding it to the soup.  I also added chopped fresh spinach and carrots and some curry powder.  This is going to become one of my regular recipes.  Thanks!!

This is a very tasty, healthy, and easy recipe - great for moms who want to feed their children healthy meals. :)  I save the excess tomato paste in 2-Tbsp. "dollops" (because we make a half-batch at a time) and freeze for future batches, because I was throwing it away before.

Although I have done it both ways, we prefer this dish with RED lentils.  They are a prettier color (make a bright orange soup, instead of dull brown) and, because they absorb water more readily, make for a thick creamy chowder-like soup.

I'm giving this one a bonus star because it's lentils.  It's definately the best Lentil recipe I've ever tasted.  I'm not a fan of this bean, but my mother loves it and made us eat them as children.  I actually enjoyed these, though.  I served them with cornbread muffins and it was really good.  It wasn't very "soupy" - mine had very little broth.  I also added an extra tablespoon or so of tomato paste and left out the lemon.  We will have this again, maybe even regularly.  (My mother would be so proud.)

I love this soup! Made a a double batch.
The cumin really kicks it up and is delicious
I added  a cup diced carrots. 
I used 2 qts vegetable broth and 2 qts vegetable stock .
I will chop up spinach and add to the bowl for color and nutrition.
I do add a squeeze of lemon just before serving.

This was amazing! My son and husband are the pickiest eaters I know, and they both loved this. I cooked this in my instant pot with two chicken breasts cut into cubes. This was so cheap, relatively healthy, and EASY. This will definitely be a staple in my house from now on. Next time I think I may add some chopped kale.

Excellent base recipe. I used all the same ingredients, but changed the method.
I chose t saute the onions, garlic, and cumin in olive oil first until onions were opaque. Then I added lentils, tomato paste (or sauce) and chicken broth.  I've also added carrots, or celery or both. This is a "go to" soup for my house.

I’ve made it a few times “as is” and it’s great.  This last time I added sliced carrots, one yellow pepper and added fresh parsley as a garnish.  The lentils I used were red lentils.  Very yummy.

I, just like everyone else, took this recipe and made some additions. I added 4 garlic cloves and 1/2 a white onion. I sautéed them with 2 small bay leaves. I added 3 carrots, 1 large potato, I added 1 small can of tomato paste and 1 can of salt free tomato sauce. I added 1 packet of Goya Sazon (for the rich red color) and 1 tbs of Sofrito (green pepper, onion, garlic, cilantro paste) I added 1 tbs oregano, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper. Seems like a lot, but it is delicious! It’s very savory and thick and hearty. Perfect with a crusty baguette!

I made this with Pace salsa instead of tomato paste, and I also added some chili powder. Oh yeah and I browned the garlic and onion in the saucepan before adding the rest of the ingredients and simmering to make soup. Yum!! Very easy and simple to make with ingredients I usually have on hand!!

This is such a great recipe, I have been making it as written for the past year.  The only tweaks I recently discovered that add a lot of flavor: use vegetable broth instead of chicken, add 2 dashes of salt, and 3-4 cloves of garlic.  Just can't beat the health benefits, affordability, and flavor all rolled up into one!

Delicious! A really great basic lentil soup recipe that can be easily altered to suit personal tastes! I added more garlic, sauteed it with the onion, used a whole 6oz can of tomato paste, and added 2tbsp of a salt-free multipurpose seasoning I had on hand.  I also didn't have broth on hand, so I used water + butter and it came out wonderfully.  I will definitely be making this again. Next time, I'm thinking coconut milk and curry seasoning... :D

I followed the reciped to a T, and then at the end added shredded chicken.  Great meal.  Since I live alone though, I think I will cut the recipe in half next time.  To spice it up I like to squeeze in a couple slices of lime, and add a couple sprigs of cilantro to each bowl.

Quick and easy and very good.  Nice and flavorful.  Very nice the next day as leftovers for lunch - the flavors blended even more.  Made this as-is except I put the whole can of tomato paste in so I wouldn't have leftovers.  Will definitely make this again!

Very tasty and a great weeknight meal.  There was no salt or pepper called for in the recipe.  I thought it needed some so I added to my family's taste.  I wound up cooking this for an hour to get the lentils good and soft.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe as I found it tasted way too much like chili. This meal wasn't all lost in that I froze the lentils and now have a chili base ready to go when needed.

I love this soup! It took about 5 min to throw everything in the pot and was actually way more delicious than I was expecting.  I added an extra clove of garlic, about twice the amount of tomato paste, and a diced carrot.  I think the squeeze of lemon at the end makes this the best. I topped it with a dollop of plain yogurt and sliced green onions with toasty wholewheat bread on the side. mmm.

This really was easy, and it's so tasty!! I added a bay leaf and a sliced carrot, and I just threw everything in together, uncooked. When it was almost done I stirred in a little bit of fresh parsley. I'll most definitely be making this again.

AMAZING recipe! I did adjust things differently though. I used more garlic like suggested, I cut up a tomato and added it, also no cumin.  When the lentils were soft I added two cut/cooked shicken breasts.  Really tasty! and for the chicken broth I used 3 bullion cubes to 2 1/2 liters of water.

This was great! To cut down on the sodium I split the broth with water and added 3 boullion. I also put half of a lemon in it while it was cooking. It was a quick meal that is nice and healthy!

Easy soup to make. I halved it by using just 1 cup lentils, 4 cups chicken broth, only half an onion, and small can of tomato paste. Also added large can of mixed vegetables (carrots, celery, potatoes, corn, and green beans). I think the vegetables really made the soup. Just added a little salt and pepper for spices. I'm sure I'll be making this again, especially during the winter months. It's very low cost and healthy.

This was really delicious and hearty. I followed the directions exactly, and it had a good body, great flavor, and so easy. I will keep this on hand for a good way to use up lentils, and a great way to throw a soup together with virtually no chopping (just the onion).

Loved it!  Only changes were more garlic and I added carrots for some extra chunkiness.  Will probably add some tomatoes or other veggies next time just because we like them.  Otherwise, great as is!

Like others I changed the following and it was perfect.  I doubled the garlic then sautéed with onion and bay leaf in olive oil.  I used a whole 6oz can of tomato paste and added a can of diced tomato (mexican seasoned).  I also added a couple dashes of garlic powder, paprika and parsley.  Finally I added 2 cups of fresh chopped spinach.  Soup looks fantastic and tastes even better!

This was my first time making lentils and this recipe is very good and very easy!  I did have a few changes.  I used 1qt of chicken broth and 1qt water.  I added curry power instead of cumin, increased the garlic, used an entire little can of tomato paste and added some left over spaghetti sauce.  Next time I will add sausage based off of my boyfriend's suggestion.

This is a great base for lentil soup. However, the last 10 minutes I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and dry red wine. It was amazing.

YUMMY! This was so good, it's now one of my staples! I was a little scared that the cumin was gonna make it tast like chili but that was not the case at all. I added two cloves of garlic but added a little garlic salt once it was done. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe along with some hearty, crusty bread and a hard cheese on the side. I did as other suggested and added carrots. A very filling soup - so healthy, and conveniently vegetarian. If I wanted to make this non-vegetarian I would add some cubed salt cured ham, and I think that would be great in this.

This recipe formed the base of a really simple, delicious soup great for cold winter nights. I used several of the suggestions listed below - I added a full can of tomato paste, four cloves of garlic, which I sauteed with the onion and 2 bay leaves. I also added a pinch each of cardamom and garam masala which gives the soup a nice aroma. And lastly, I added some finely chopped bacon to give it some extra flavor. This one was definitely a keeper!

I used green lentils, and I wonder should I have used a different kind? The good news is it made tasty lentils, but not a soup. I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste, and that probably made a difference. I added carrot, yellow pepper that I needed to get rid of, cayenne pepper, and curry. I agree that celery would make an excellent addition.

This was an excellent recipe.  I would suggest a little longer cooking for softer lentils.  For some reason, mine did not cook as well.

Good, but not amazing.  Seemed to be missing something.  A bit bland.  Made a huge pot of soup, though!  Here's a hint:  if you're cooking it for vegetarians, substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth, or you'll look like a major doof.  Oops.

4 stars only because modifications were necessary. Salt and pepper, of course. Also added 3 carrots, chopped, and sautees in 1 tbsp olive oil with the onion and garlic. Float a slice of lemon on top, and add a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt, if you want. Delicious, nutritious, fast, and easy. Who could ask for anything more? Thanks!

This was just ok.  I had to add more spices to this to give it some flavor.  I added more garlic, chili powder, basil and thyme.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and more broth.  It was too dry for our tastes.

Very comforting soup, wonderful and simple.  My only changes were to saute the onions for a few minutes in EVOO then add garlic and cumin for 2 more minutes.  Used the entire can of tomato paste which really helped boost the flavor.  Paired with a grilled cheese sandwich, this received lots of raves at dinner tonight!

Quick and easy. I sauteed the vegis, doubled the cumin and garlic, used 1 box of broth and one box of water. Added sea salt and pepper,3 bay leaves, curry powder, garlic salt, celery, peppers, canned tomatoes and a whole can of paste. Next time, I'll probably add worchesteshire, shrimp and tumeric. Topped it with sour cream.

This lentil soup tastes JUST like the one I fell in love with at Cosi (until they unfortunately changed the recipe for much worse), minus the red and green peppers! I started with a tablespoon of olive oil, and heated double the amount of garlic in it, plus a sprinkle of thyme, and sauteed the onion in the oil with 1 1/2 cups sliced carrots. I also substituted 1 1/2 cups of the broth with a 14 oz can of petite diced tomatoes (I like some chunks of tomato in the soup). Next time I will slightly decrease the lentils, and maybe add some red and green bell peppers for more color. Now I don't have to worry about losing my favorite soup forever because I found it :) Thank you!!!

I make this all the time and my kids love it.  The main change I've made is to slice up a lemon and add it to the pot from the start.  I find that it perks up the soup a bit.  If I have fresh thyme on hand, I add about a teaspoon.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I made it for a neighbor who is diabetic as well as undergoing radiation and chemo, as it is nutritious and not much in it that someone can object to. I added some celery salt and cut down on the cumin (about half) added a bay leaf, and did add salt and pepper to taste.  I didn't have any carrots on hand or I would have put those in.  Next time I probably would saute the onions and garlic so they didn't look so obvious in it. And I would probably make it in winter and not on an 85 degree summer day, like I did today. LOL

As previous reviewers suggested, I sauted the onion and some minced garlic before adding it to the soup.  Next time I would add half the amount of lentils, mine came out more as a stew and less as a soup, I added a bit of water later on in the cooking in order to have some more broth.  Very easy to make.

First time I've ever tried lentils . . . I loved this soup!!!  I can't believe how easy it was too.  Made it two days ago and have already shared the recipe with friends.  I cooked up some breakfast sausage links and ate along side.  Went well together.

Pretty good recipe, but some of the ingredients in this recipe make it more of a chili than a lentil stew. I adjusted it a little by leaving out the cumin and tomato paste, and substituting a dash of red wine vinegar and some maggi seasoning... delicious!

This is a really delicious, filling, and easy to make soup. I used the variations others suggested (sauteeing the onions with garlic and bay leaves beforehand) and it came out very flavorful. I'm adding it to my regular rotation, especially for wintertime.

I loved this soup.  If you like lentils you love it too.

This recipe was ok.  I gave it only 3 stars because I ended up throwing the leftovers away.  Nobody really cared to have it a second time.  Sorry!

I used a whole pound of lentils and a can of tomato paste, and cooked in a slow cooker.  Turned out great - kind of like chili with lentils.  Thanks!

I omitted the tomato paste and added dried apricots and shredded chicken.  WONDERFUL.  My husband and 5yrold loved it - I was shocked.

I'm sorry, I did not enjoy this at all. I usually use chicken broth or veggie stock when making lentils so I wanted to try something different. The tomato paste was awful. Sorry!

I gave the recipe 3 stars, not that it was bad, but it wasn't that great either.  I continued to try to tweak it, but just couldn't get it there with what i had on hand.  Haven't tried it today, may be better now, but I don't plan to make it again.  
To be totally honest, I had to put cheese and sour cream on it to get anyone in my family to eat it.  
Sorry, but thanks for sharing.  :)

Perfect diet food?
At first I found this to be quite bland, but as with most soups, this tasted quite awesome after sitting for a day in the fridge.  I added some carrots and used the whole can (6oz) of tomato paste and a little salt and pepper.

Holy Cow, was this good.  I added some sliced black olives into the mix too.  It's below zero outside, but my tummy is nice and warm! Thanks for the recipe!

A very good basic soup - especially fast if you use canned lentils (I used two 700 mL cans). As a university student myself, I really appreciated this quick, easy and tasty soup.

I loved this recipe! I left out the cumin (not crazy about it) and added some diced carrots and celery. I also added an extra clove of garlic.
GREAT basic recipe!! Thanks Molly.

Great recipe!  Sauted onions and garlic in olive oil till just soft while bringing soup to boil.  Then added the onions and 4 medsm. sliced carrots and 14 tsp. garlic powder.  When soup was done carrots were al dente.  Served in bowl side by side with rice with dash of lemon juice on soup - an Indian flair!  My little children and husband really liked it.  Will add to my vegetarian recipes!  Also used a nice vegetable broth instead.
