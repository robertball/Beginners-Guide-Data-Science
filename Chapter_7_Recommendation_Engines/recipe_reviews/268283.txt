I had a difficult time finding Chanterelle mushrooms, so, I took the suggestions of the author and used a different kind.  I used a blend of button, oyster, & baby bellas.   I also parbaked the crust for about 7 minutes, so, the crust didn't get soggy.  The quiche had good flavor and I loved the earthy mushroom taste.  I would add a little salt and pepper if I made it again.
