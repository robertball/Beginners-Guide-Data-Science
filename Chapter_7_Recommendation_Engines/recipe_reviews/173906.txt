I cooked this in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  I used the spices/seasonings as directed, making sure to really get some of it into the incisions in the loin and rubbing the rest all over.  Next, I added a bit of celery salt and black pepper all over the pork loin also. I put a whole can of chicken broth and added some dashes of worcestershire sauce into the crock pot and layered the onion on the bottom.  I set the loin on top and then put in white potatoes and carrots.  The pork loin was so incredibly tender, it broke apart when I removed it from the pot. I transferred the meat and vegetables to serving dishes and put the juice into a skillet on the stove and added flour and a bit of salt to make the gravy. My guests raved over this dinner. Wonderful and easy for those who enjoy using a crock pot too. Thank you Patti for sharing this recipe.

I made this for my husband's birthday in order to try something different from our usual Pork Roast, and I can easily say it has become a new favorite. From now on, I think I will always use this recipe. It's easy to make, has just the right amount of spice, and tastes AWESOME! Everyone needs to try this recipe. Thank you very much.

Tried this for dinner last night and even my picky daughter ate it. It was juicy and flavorful. Makes a great gravy. Served it over brown basmati rice and there were no left overs. The only change I made was to increase all the spices by about 50% and I used hot mustard powder instead of regular. I think you could tweak this to your own personal taste and have a great dinner. Would likely do well in a slow cooker, just omit the oil and spray with cooking spray instead. Wll try this next t

I just HAD to stop everything and write this review! I came to this recipe because I was trying to figure out what to do with my boneless country pork ribs.  I figured pork is pork and it's all about the flavor, isn't it? I made no changes to the ingredients other than I had 2lbs of meat instead of 4. My difference came in the cooking method. I rationalized that if a crock pot could be used successfully (previous review) then so could a pressure cooker,(my go-to method when I have time constraints.) And what a good result!  After combining the seasonings in the skillet I just rolled the meat in that whole amt. I then placed the pieces in an open pressure cooker to brown. Then removed the meat from the pot along with excess fat and started to brown the onions and carrots in effort to get a rich brown gravy (worked great) then added the red bell pepper and celery. Topped that with the meat and added a can of chicken broth. Closed the pot and let cook under med pressure for about 45 minutes. The meat was fall apart tender. I removed it from the broth then strained the broth and thickened with a cornstarch slurry. A little salt and pepper and "Oh my goodness!"  This recipe is a keeper!!

I prepared this for my family for Christmas via slow cooker and it-was-amazing!!!!!  Thank you so much to the reviewer that listed her recipe for cooking it in the crockpot.  I doubled the seasoning, and used about 16 oz of chicken broth, so that I would have an ample amount of juices to make gravy.  It was wonderful!  I will definitely be preparing this dish again and again--as I've already been asked to! :-)

The only thing i would do different is reverse the cooking process.....cook the roast @ 425 for 15 minutes to create a crust and hold in all the juices.....then turn down 300 for the rest of cooking time.....i tried it both ways and my roast turned out juicier using the higher temp first.......

Thanks, Patti!  Had I listened about the cayenne (to you and myself), it wouldn't have been so spicy.  Still, we loved it! The gravy and roasted potatoes were an excellent addition. I'll definitely make it again, with my modifications of mushrooms and peppers.  Awesome!

Tried this for the first time this evening for my lovely wife and I it turned out just like the picture and was incredible. I added some Red Wine and it was wonderful. Along with more cayenne to make it more spicy as we are both spicy eaters. I give this recipe a A+++ for every part of it. Tip: I cooked it at 325 degrees for about 1 hour 25 minutes and it was perfectly juicy.

Awesome recipe. I didn't change anything other than seared my loin on the grill first and then place it in a roasting pan covered with tinfoil and finshed it on the grill.  I had two small loins about  a pound each.  It took about 45-55 minutes to cook.  Easy and delicious!!

I did this almost exactly Teresa did in the crock pot with a few minor adjustments.  I didn't have ground mustard on hand, so I marinated the pork in mustard for about a half hour, then added maybe 1tsp of mustard to the spice mix before putting it on the roast.  I put it in the crock pot with 16oz of chicken broth on a bed of onoins.  My roast was only 2 1/2lbs, and I followed the spices exactly - so basically doubled them.  I also added a bit of sage and nutmeg.  I made gravy out of the broth from the crock pot that was to die for!  Probably added about 2 1/2 tblsp. of flour to thicken.  I made mashed pototaes on the side to serve with it.  Even my picky boyfriend ate it all up and went back for seconds.  I'll definately make this again!

I make a pork loin and veggies like this only I use onions, bell pepper, carrots, white and sweet potatoes. Really, really good. My favorite pork loin recipe. Sometimes I add some Parmesan cheese to the vegetables too.

Outstanding recipe!  I make it for special occasions now.   Flavorful meat and tasty gravy.  My husband has many food sensitivities and it was great to find a recipe that had such delicious taste.

This is an easy recipe that tastes great. I added more garlic, but that is just a personal preference. I will be saving this recipe as a new family favorite.

Excellent flavors!!  My mouth was watering when the butter and spices were on the stove.  I had to adapt the cooking style and choice of meat for what I was using (Electric smoker) and really wished I had gone with the loin in the oven cause the only thing that I didnt like was the cut of meat (I used a pork butt roast cause it was going to be on overnight and didnt want to have dry meat)  But this cooking method got me a crust on top of the meat that was just to die for.  I didnt think it was at all too spicy (or hot)  In fact I may even add a little more cayenne pepper next go around.  I also didnt have a chance to make the gravy which I might try tonight with the left overs.  Thinking of making "pulled" pork sandwiches and using the au jus as a dipper.  Also my roast was 9 pounds so I tripled the recipe - IMO you should definitely double up on this recipe if you like lots of flavor

I was all set to make this recipe however was called away for a family emergency, so my husband said he'd make it. He followed it exactly as written except being the grill master he is, he grilled it on his Weber charcoal for 2 hours over indirect heat at 300 degrees. This was very good, the spices were fantastic and the meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were perfectly done. We served with crusty garlic bread.

I got a 5 1/2 lb pork loin roast and cut it in half and froze the other half.I followed the recipe to the tee,but i noticed when it didnt say whether you have to cover or not.I covered it at 300 degrees so the veggies wont dry out.I cooked for about an hour (smelled so devine)turned up the temp to 425 for an additional 15 min.When i took out the meat i didnt have alot of juice so i added a packet of onion soup mix and a half a cup of water to the juice,broth and flour.The gravy was soo smooth and flavorful!I also added a dash more of the cayenne pepper being as though we love the spiceness.This is an awesome recipe,and very easy.Will definently try again,next time in the crock!

Delish! I omitted the bell pepper because I did't have any, I'm sure it would have made it that much better! The gravy was the best part IMHO.

Super moist and flavorful without being too salty. I feel the spicing is just right. My wife said it reminded her of a stew . . . just deconstructed. You can't get meat this juicy any faster in my experience. I was trying to get more veggies into the meal so added more onion and a green bell pepper too. I would be tempted to add even more since they were so good with the meat. My gravy / sauce turned out ok.  As some others here did, I removed the veggies to another bowl when I set the meat aside to rest. I had next to no pan drippings left. I ended up adding some - eek - butter and transferred the mix to a small saucepan. I was doubling the sauce too - maybe that was part of the problem - but still ended up adding about twice the chicken stock. It turned out pretty well as I said, but I might actually try for a rouxless / jus based sauce next time. Heck, the meat was so juicy and tender - no knife needed - I almost could see not servings a sauce at all. Oh, added a touch of cayenne and thyme to my expanded sauce to play on the rub flavors. We had some whole wheat pasta with it, but another reviewers suggestion of rice, or maybe couscous might be our starch/carb next time. There DEFINITELY will be a next time. This is one if my AllRecipes favorites. Can't wait to make it for family and friends. Thank you so much for sharing.

I have to admit that I made a slightly major change to the recipe... I used a whole chicken instead of a pork roast and just baked longer to achieve a higher temp. I'm sorry! I just don't eat much pork. Anyway - the spices were just delicious and the sauce that came off was great. Don't limit yourself to just pork for this recipe! :)

I was using only a 2 lb roast, and didn't halve the rub so it was too peppery. I will definitely make this again and just make sure I adjust for the size of the roast.

Very Nice! I doubled all the seasonings before I added them to the melted butter. Loved it....could cut back to original half tsp of cayenne, but not for me. The funny thing was the heat seemed to come from the gravy! The oven was full, so I put it on the grill in a big cast iron skillet surrounded by the vegetables. Used a little pecan for a light smoke flavor. Used a remote thermometer, so I don't know exactly how long I cooked it at about 325-350. But as soon as the thermometer read 160 degrees, I pulled it, let it rest, made the gravy in the same iron skillet...very good! Juicy and nice cajun flavor. I recommend taking the veggies out before you try and make the gravy. Didn't "strain" very well for me. But the flavor was a 5 star!

Very good, but needed to make extra spice mix to have a respectable coating on the meat.

I don't like pork roasts very much ... and I have to admit DH went and poured BBQ sauce over the roast about a half hour before it was done (he thought I forgot to add it) ... but this was definitely good.  I simply rubbed the roast with olive oil and massaged the herbs and spices into it and down into the cracks.  Then placed the roast on a bed of carrots, celery and onion; drizzled more olive oil over all, and baked at 450 for 10" then about an hour at 300 (did not cover).  Meat was nice and moist with a great kick ... but it was the roasted veggies that did it for me.  I wish I had used 3 or 4 whole carrots - they were SO good.  Will make again and many thanks for recipe.

Boyfriend and I both loved it, and made multiple meals!  My alterations:  
I used green peppers instead of red because they are cheaper.  I added carrots and potatoes to the veggies.  I lightly coated all the veggies in olive oil, salt and pepper before putting them in the baking dish.  Didn't have a roasting pan, but putting the roast surrounded by veggies in a baking pan worked fine.  Didn't have ground mustard so I used spicy brown mustard, worked fine.  I also made the chicken broth with a chicken bouillon cube and water.  I added the extra cayenne because we like the spice.  Everything turned out great!

I made this last night and it was pretty tasty (the smell was divine!) I couldn not bring myself to waste all the vegetables after deglazing the pan, they were not overcooked, so I pureed them into the gravy with my blender. Next time I will try saving some whole to serve on the side.

This is really good! I followed the direction except I used a meat thermometer to indicate when I wanted to remove the roast.  For my 2 1/2 lb roast, I cooked it for 1 hr at 300 and 15 minutes at 425.

The meat came out tasty and juicy, and the veggies were perfect.  My whole family liked it and agreed I should make it again. Thanks!

Only gave 4 stars because, like other reviewers, I tripled the spices for such a large piece of meat.

Wonderful recipe!  Everyone in the family loved it! The gravy is a little on the spicy side (as it should be for a Cajun dish).  The meat came out nice and tender.  We'll be making this one on a regular basis!

I made a small revision to this recipe. Instead of frying just the spices, I also chopped some carrot and celery very finely and added that to the skillet as well. My partner dislikes celery, so I try to hide it from him. I then pressed this mix into the slits and rubbed over the loin. I did add some carrots and celery to the pan, but I think it was really the spice mix that was responsible for the wonderful flavour. Oh, and certainly the most wonderful gravy I've ever tasted came from this recipe. I would have rated 5 stars, but the pork was a bit tough. I may have needed more liquid in the pan, or it may have been the cut--I can't be sure. Definitely a keeper!

I used a 5 lb roast, doubled the spices and added potatoes with the veggies.  Delicious.  Simply delicious and it is going to be better tomorrow as chili verde with green sauce.  Oh my, if you are looking for an easy delicious recipe...this is a keeper!  I'll add a photo soon.

Excellent recipe! Turned out so juicy and moist. The next time I make it, I think I will add more cayenne pepper to spice it up some more. (My husband and I like SPICY).

This recipe was amazing! I also decided to use the sauce mixture on wings because it reminded me so much of the cajun flavored wings from Quaker Steak and Lube, the restaurant.

I cooked this in the crockpot as well-on low for 8 hours. It came out very tender and juicy. I used a can of chicken broth instead of water. I followed the spices exactly but halved the cayenne because my family doesn't like spicy foods. My husband still said it was spicy and the flavor was "off" I found it to be quite good, but was missing something that I cant quite put a finger on. Overall it is very good but didn't make the cut with my husband.

I am on a low iodine diet preparing for an RAI.  So I did not use the salt and substituted the butter for olive oil.  I also used broth from a chicken I roasted the day before.  This turned out great!

Very good and moist. I cooked in a slow cooker for 5 hours, and then put in the for 40 minutes at 400 degrees to brown it. Would definately make again... however, it did seem like it was lacking on ingredient... maybe something as simple as salt. Couldn't figure out what it was!

This was great! The gravy is quite spicy however not overbearing. I removed the vegetables to a bowl at the same time I removed the roast to make the gravy. I then added the vegetables to the gravy. Awesome recipe I will keep and use again!

This was delicious. My husband loved it. I followed the recipe with a couple exceptions. I doubled the spices and seared the meat to seal in the flavor. I also started it in the oven at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Then lowered the temp to 300 degrees. It was flavorful and juicy. This will be my go to  recipe from now on.

This was good.  I used a 1.24 lb pork tenderloin but ALL of the seasonings for the 4 lb roast after reading reviews that said it needed more seasoning.  This was spicy, but we LOVE spicy food.  I reversed the cooking order to 425 for 15 mins and then decreased to 300 for about 35 mins more. I also added 2 medium red potatoes to the other veggies.  (I think sweet potato would be delicious with this!)  I didn't have much juice left at the end, so I just nixed the gravy, but will try it next time because many people said it was amazing!

This is an awesome recipe.  I used 1 1/2 the spices but I think using the spices as written would be just fine.  I used Tony's seasoning instead of cayenne and black pepper, it's what I had.  I also didn't sear my pork loin but I added a little bit of Italian dressing, just enough to coat, instead.  The pork loin came out very tender and very tasty.  Next time I will add more veggies for sides, and try this on the crock pot.  We served it with Italian roasted potatoes.  Our new go to pork loin recipe, Thanks for posting.

Everyone liked it, but the hubby said it needed something to make it pop. I will make this again and work on the spices. I had a pork loin and that was the meat I used. Cooked it in the crock pot on high for about 5 hours. Meat was very tender.

This was delicious the whole family loved it even the picky eaters.  I cooked it mostly as directed but added 6 peeled potatoes cut up, and put the vegetables under the meat in a dutch oven as I dont have a good roasting pan.  So the veggies cooked in the juice from the meat while the meat was above the liquid.  I left the meat fat side up, and just poured the butter/garlic/seasoning over the meat.  I removed the lid when I turned the temp up the last 15 minutes.  The meat was moist and temperature was 145+ after the first 1hr 45 min so next time cook maybe a little less time.  The seasoning was great just a little bit spicy.  The gravy was delicious too.  This was my first time cooking pork loin and I will definitely make this recipe again!

Used a pork tender loin with this recipe. Consquently, there wasn't a great amount of fat after cooking outside of the oil added with the onions, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

Next time I'll change up the seasoning portions a bit, but otherwise a very good recipe!

OMG...this is so yummy!  My husband and I like spicy food so I made it as is except subbed chipolte powder for cayenne to give it a bit of a smokey flare and this wasn't even spicy to us but the flavor and smelled up the whole house.  Definitely a keeper and we may tweak it with a bit more chipolte powder next time otherwise flavor blend was perfect!

Cajun Roasted Pork Loin Haiku: "That spice mix was great! I followed the first review, and used the crock pot." Halved this recipe for a smaller cut of pork, and used the crock pot suggestion of one of the reviews, following everything else the same, other than skipping making a gravy from the leftover juices. The pork was tender, fall-apartey, and flavorful, due to jamming as much of that spice mix into lots of little cuts. Good stuff!

Made this for dinner tonight!  Very easy to put together and sooo good!  Really tender!!  The spice mix may be a bit spicy for some...perhaps you could cut down on the cayenne if you wanted it less spicy.  We love spicy!  I did add an additional cup of chichen broth to the pan drippings and flour as it looked way too thick.  I'm glad I did cuz the gravy is gone!!  Definetly would make this for dinner again!

I used pork roast.  I combined a BUNCH of different herbs and spices:  chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, tarragon, cardamon, dried mustard, thyme, sage and a touch of nutmeg.  And because I'm cooking for two so used 1 lb rather than 3 or 4, the timing was much less - I'm pretty sure it was about 45 minutes... The vegies were perfecto! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. The pork is so tender and delicious. I would suggest roasting the vegetables before you put the pork in for just a little while because they were a little on the crunchy side.

Followed ingredients.  Seared rubbed meat in instantpot, removed, added carrots and onion to brown, added celery and red pepper, placed seared loin on top, tossed in a can of chicken broth and pressure cooked on high for 35 minutes.  Fall apart tender, but broth didn't quite do it for me so added some 1/2 and 1/2 plus a tablespoon of brown gravy mix from packet to give it a richer taste.  Then it became yummy.  Will definitely make again.

Roast was great. I brined it for 4 hours beforehand. My only problem was the sauce. Three tablespoons of flour & 1/2 cup of chicken broth made “glue.” I added chicken broth until it resembled gravy. Then it was OK, but not good enough for my palate.

Marvelous taste. I made it as written, but the roasting time was way too long and the meat turn out tough. Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll either put it in the crock pot or do as another suggested and roast at 425 for 15 minutes then turn the heat down to 300 to finish it off.  Great taste!

Pork sometimes is a difficult meat to get  moist and flavorful as well as tender.  This dish was highly enjoyed by a number of Pork skeptics for all the above..  Yes , we will be having this dish again and again.

Used a 2 pound roast, and the suggestion of one of the reviewers  to use the high temp first.  We really enjoyed the meal.  I might consider brining the meat the next time as it seemed to need a little more salt - nothing the salt shaker at the table didn't fix.

This combination of spices is so good. Today, after the first 30 min or so in the oven,  I cooked the veggies separately in a Shuttle Chef (to make them extra soft for the 1-year old in the family) and it still came out fine.

I used an almost 3.5 lb pork loin and increased all spices by 50% because we like intense flavors.  Taking another reviewers suggestion, I roasted the loin at 425 deg. for 15 minutes, then lowered to 300 deg. for an hour.  That was way too long (and thank goodness for the gravy).  Next time I'll decrease the time by at least 1/2 hour and check the temperature.  My husband liked the flavors so I will try again and maybe cover the roast.  I can't imagine how dry this would be roasting for over two hours.

nice recipe that translates well to a slow cooker. I skipped the oil, doubled all spices for an extra good rub, threw it all into the crockpot with a pound of chopped potatoes. Cooked on high for two hours to get it going and for another 4 on low. Sliced the Loin up and plated the goods and made the gravy whisking the flour on the stove as instructed until I had a good consistency I liked and poured it on. Spiciness was Medium-Low despite doubling everything. came out great.

My family didn't care for it.  It was too bland for a Cajun recipe.  I cooked it according to the directions with no substitutions. I will add a spicy sauce to it if I serve the leftovers or I may add potatoes and green chiles and make a green chili stew from the left-over meat.

I did not measure out the spices, just eyeballed and used Moreno of what we like.  It had the perfect amount of heat.  We grilled instead and I think was delicious.

I liked the flavor but next time I'm going to use an injector. I think making incisions in the meat dried it out.

This recipe turned out great. I cooked it in the crock pot though. My husband, who is picky about crock pot cooked pork even liked it and asked me to make it again. This is definitely going to be a favorite recipe.

I changed this recipe slightly by adding to slits in roast a mixture of 3 tblsps butter, 3 large cloves garlic minced and 2 heaping tblsps homemade Cajun Seasoning.  Instead of seasoning roast with salt and pepper, I used Uncle Chris seasoning and TexJoy.  I let roast rest for 1 hour before cooking but would more flavorful resting overnight.  I sautéed 1 large onion and 4 stalks celery and added to pork loin.  Roasted loin for 2 hours at 325; it was a large loin.  Onion and celery made nice crust for loin.  It was wonderful.  Served with Squash Dressing, Allrecipes.com recipes for cajun seasoning and squash dressing.

I doubled the rub mixture and added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to the mix. Allowed it to cool and then mixed in some Kosher salt. I also added some quartered red potatoes to the veggies and tossed those with some olive oil, 2 cloves of minced garlic, salt and pepper before arranging them around the roast. Roasted @ 425 for 15 mins then turned the temp down to 300 and continued to cook for about 45 mins. Turned out wonderful.

So good! I've made this with both pork and chicken ( split breasts without the skin). I increase the quantities for the sauce because we like a lot of sauce for the rice side.

I had an 8 lb pork loin so i tripled the ingredients. The only change I made was that I had chipotle chile powder on hand not Cayenne pepper. I will be making this recipe again and trying it with cayenne pepper.  My family loved it!

Wow, what flavor! added just a little extra veggies, because never get enough carrots & added "kicked up" Seasoning for some extra spice. The pan dripped sauce was fantastic touch to finish it off.  All my friends loved it.

Everyone I made this for LOVED it! I added more Cayenne pepper, garlic and used a pepper grinder for the pepper because we like things pretty spicy. But, it was almost too spicy. So, next time I will probably just go with it how it is.

This is a great recipe! It's been a while since I've made a loin roast so I decided to find a recipe to give me some inspiration. I did not follow it exactly but I didn't stray too far. I used half the amount of cayenne called for. I love spicy but to make it enjoyable for everyone I held back. It worked well, giving a very slight heat. I'm not an oregano fan and didn't have any on hand so I used a little basil instead. I was also out of fresh garlic so I added garlic powder to my spice mix. The last change was at the end. I did not use chicken broth and flour for the sauce.  I just used a little cornstarch to thicken the juices from the meat and veggies. I roasted some potatoes to go with the meal. I put them in the oven about 45 minutes after starting the roast. I cut them in half, tossed them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic. They were nice and crispy on the outside and perfectly creamy inside by the time everything was ready to come out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again for sure.

One thing I would change. I would use one of those flavor injectors to really get those spices inside the pork loin. Very tasty though.

Followed the recipe pretty exactly except I increased the spices by 50% and made 2 cups of gravy.  EXCELLENT!!!!  The meat was soooo moist and the gravy was the best gravy I've ever made.  Served with mashed potatoes and the roasted vegetables. A must try and will definitely be making again. Thanks for posting!

Wow! Thank you for the yummy recipe! I made two (2-lb.) sirloin tip roasts with 
1-1/2 times of spices, but only one part cayenne. I used the same amount of veggies, plus 2 russet potatoes. I cooked at the temperatures and times as directed.  Perfect! The roasts were juicy and tasty. The only thing I didn't get to do was turn the drippings into gravy (my college kid called).  Everyone just spooned the au jus onto their meal...that worked!

Very good!  Next time I'll triple the veggies, sear the loin first, use boneless (it didn't say) and double the spices because it wasn't enough to cover the whole roast.

I used 2 cups of chicken broth when roasting and then deglazed the roasting pan with 1 additional cup.  Strained and cooked that down and thickened with tapioca for the gravy.

I made this exactly according to the directions, except I used a little less cayenne.  And I added potatoes to the surrounding veggie mix.  I partially precooked the carrots and potatoes in the microwave, as I frequently have found them not fully cooked when doing them like this.  It was really good.  The loin was not very tender, but it was juicy and had a nice flavor.  I transferred the vegetables to a covered skillet with a little water to finish the onions and celery, which hadn't finished.  I'll probably partially cook all the veggies next time.  Very good -- certainly much better than my experiences doing these pork loin roasts in the crock pot, which have resulted in dry meat.

Would have to roast for a shorter time.  Veggies over cooked and loin dried out.  Spicy, but no real flavor.

Like others I used the crockpot, but pretty much stuck to the original recipe. I did add some Cajun spice for extra flavor but most people wouldn't care for the extra "fire". The gravy was superb! Next time I'll be sure to make more!

I love the seasoning combination, and make this a lot. 4 stars instead of 5 because it's dry as written. I now cook mine in a cooking bag, and have juice for a light gravy. My hubby suggested I put a little jalepeno juice in the bag this time. That was tasty.

Great recipe. Maybe add a few more vegetables next time, Probably wouldn't need the chicken broth for the gravy if the veggies were doubled.

Good pork loin.  Not as flavorful as I anticipated, but still good.

I made this for dinner today, and tossed it in the slow cooker for the 8 hours. Only change the the recipe I made was using Green bell peppers instead of red,as I had the green at home. When it was done, I found the meat lacking in flavour, so I added BBQ sauce to balance the flavours more, and made it in more of a pulled pork instead of a roast. Turned out fabulous with the change.

Just made this!  It was pretty good, I ended up using pork chops instead of a roast loin.  Also, I added a lot more veggies, including red potatoes, yellow and orange bell peppers in addition to the red, and more carrots and celery than originally listed.  If I were to make it again, I would add more of the spices to the mix, and marinate for a while before cooking.  Pretty tasty for a first attempt though!

Excellent. I used a 2 1/2 lb roast but left the other ingredient amounts the same with the exception of 1/2 teaspoon of crushed rosemary. I also added 1 zuchinni & 1 yellow squash to the veggies. The roast was very flavorful. Will definitely make again.

This came out absolutely wonderful. The flavors really work well together. The only thing I added, was some rubbed sage to the gravy.

God, I am eating this as I type and am in heaven.

I cooked it on the stove in a "spaghetti" pot for about an hour (until the pork loin reached 140 F). I browned the pork loin and put it in the spaghetti pot, then cut slits in the pork to put the marinade in and covered the pork with cut up sweet potatoes, carrots, poblano peppers, turnip, parnsip, rutabaga, onion, and mushroom. And put spices on top of the vegetables..and added 1/4 cup of chicken stock. DELICIOUS!!!

I have made this several times now with different vegetables depending on what I have and it has been amazing every time. No leftovers! Even my picky eight year old had seconds.

Delicious and super easy to make because I used a crock pot.  I seasoned the pork exactly as the recipe called for, then put the roast on top of a layer of onions in the crock pot.  I added the chicken broth and the carrots, but didn't add potatoes.  When the pork was done, I used the broth to make a gravy by cooking it on the stove with some cornstarch to thicken it.  I then made mashed potatoes and served the meat and potatoes with the gravy.  Everything was flavorful..just the right amount of spice to make it interesting.

good, cut cayenne pepper in 1/2, vegetables enough for 2, need to double vegetables for 4, probably need to double gravy
