Should be cooked a little longer to be more firm. A nice treat for Valetine's Day.

I thought this cheesecake really lacked some ingredience. For one everyone really likes a thick rich creamy cheesecake, not a THICK DRY TART (Oh god really tart!!) cheesecake. Now I have made a few others from here that have been wonderful!! But this recipe in my own opinion really sucked... Do not waste your money or ingredients!!

This cheesecake is the bomb!! Hands down the best cheesecake I have ever made. We all love chocolate and this will satisfy the chocolate craving. Followed baking time exactly only had 12 ounces of cream cheese but, it still turned out GREAT!

Definitely for chocolate lovers, this cheesecake is very rich, so small slices serve lots of folks.

This recipe was fairly easy, but it was my first cheese cake so i wasn't sure how to tell it was done. I over baked it a bit but  everyone liked it. YAY my first cheesecake!

Delicious! It is very creamy and fudgelike.  I like the fact that it does not take long to bake and it turns out perfect.

Delicious creamy bitter chocolate cheesecake. I followed the recipe to a T in order not to overbake the cheesecake, even though I thought 20 + 10 minutes total cooking time were not enough, but it came out absolutely perfect. Even those who don't like cheesecakes like it. Only bad point is that the sour cream layer is extremely difficult to spread on the chocolate layer.

The fudge itself is super easy to make, but make sure that you refridgerate the fudge for a sufficient amount of time, or else the peanut butter will stick quite a lot to the tin foil. Other than that, super rich and disappeared at the meeting I brought it to.
