This was delicious and super healthy too!  We really loved the flavor combinations.  I followed the directions exactly for the first omelet and then I made another omelet and the second time I folded the veggie mixture into the middle.  It stayed together better.  This was the perfect ,healthy low-carb, yummy way to start the day off right!

I added sliced new potatoes and kohlrabi greens instead of spinach, turned out really delicious! Even my pickiest kid enjoyed it. A trick I learned long ago was to use a large cast iron skillet. After eggs are added, turn heat to low until about halfway cooked through. Put skillet under broiler for ~4-5 mins to cook the top. This prevents total destruction while attempting to flip omelet, and it ends up looking picture perfect.

The recipe was delicious, I'm actually surprised I had everything for it in my fridge and pantry. I only gave 4 stars because there are way too many vegetables to make this an omelet. It completely falls apart and ends up a scramble. Still good though. I'd probably use this many veggies for a 1-whole-egg-and-3-egg-white-omelet for myself AND a bigger omelet for the hubby. Or of course it's always nice to prep veggies at the beginning of the week so they're ready when you want 'em!

Great flavor!  Like other reviewers, I probably went too heavy on the veggies too..so I didn't end up with a beautiful omelet, but it was very tasty and there is nothing wrong with getting more veg whenever you can!  Thanks for the keeper recipe.

Five stars....!!! For WHOLE. EGG. Omelets. We must stop propagating this terrible myth that egg whites, without yolk, or less yolk, are somehow healthier. Eggs are a symbiotic creation! And that myth was disproven a long time ago. Annnnd omelettes taste *far* better with whole eggs...

Change that, and you've got a five-star winner!

I also recommend the folding of at least half of the veggies inside.. they keep more of their original shape/texture/mouth-feel that way,  and it holds the omelet together nicely.

Changed up the method a bit. Cooked the mushroom/pepper/green onion mixture first. Removed from pan & added egg. Then added veggies along with spinach to the egg. Light & easy breakfast.

As a really great cook, I already make a great omelette....and then I made this recipe. amazing! I was surprised that the addition of nutmeg was so good along with the addition of cheese INTO the eggs rather than on the veggies. I adjusted the omelette for one using two egg whites and one egg-it still came out thick. The only change that I would make is to cook the veggies and then add them into the omelette because the spinach can burn if the egg doesn't get under it properly. This will be my new "normal" omelette. Also very heavy so you don't hungry all day. Last note: added zaatar and feta to the top of it...and dill in with the tomatoes - not needed but delicious!

Very yummy. I didn't have mushrooms, so increased the spinach. My skillet was not very big so the omelette was kinda thick, but v yummy.

I've never heard of adding nutmeg to an omelet but it was delicious. Full disclosure: I only added about 1/16th of a tsp of nutmeg because I was wary it would be too overpowering and based on the results, would stick to that amount in the future. I also used baby arugula instead of spinach and feta for the cheese because that's what I had on hand.

As we start off the new year this is a keeper to go healthy. The mix of vegetables, cheese, and egg/egg white make this wholesome and filling. My husband was surprised at how flavorful and filling this omelette is. Followed the directions without changes, yes will make this again!

I completely failed at making this an omelet (don't own a nonstick skillet and haven't mastered eggs of any kind without one) but it was a magnificent scramble! Omitted the tomatoes (not on hand) and used 4 whole eggs (instead of whole + egg whites). Loved the addition of nutmeg--who'd have thought?

The combo of spices and veggies suggested are perfect! I did use another reviewer's suggestion and changed the directions slightly. I sauteed the veggies and then added them AFTER the egg mixture had set (cooked). I was able to use one pan for everything by sauteeing veggies first, then transferring them to a saucer while the egg mixture was cooking. Once that's done, put the veggies on one side of the omelet and fold over.

This was a hearty and delicious lunch. The proportion of veggies and eggs is off - for this quantity of vegetables you should use at least five eggs. It can also use more spice; I added zatar and dill.

I made this today and it was really good.  I love seasonings so I used ham, seasoning, garlic and onion powder, sun dried tomatoes, jalapeno pepper,   Served with slices of tomatoes and avocado and homemade salsa.

I would have never thought of seasoning the egg like this! It is so good. By far the best I have ever had.

I was looking for something different for breakfast and tried this recipe, based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I substituted red onions for the green onions called for in the recipe.  It was delicious!

Great receipe, I added a little ghost cheese sprinkled on top.  After adding egg& tomato mixture my egg started to stick did not look great but tasted Fabulous.

I made this omelette this mrng for my daughter and I. We absolutely LOVED it!! I added a dollop of sour cream on top with a pinch of red pepper flakes for my "big finish". I plan to make a variation of it again this evng but with chicken and goat cheese. The possibilities are endless!! Thanks for sharing :-)
