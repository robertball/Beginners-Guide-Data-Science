This was simply one of the best venison recipes I've ever tried!  My husband is a hunter and we have struggled for years trying to find a venison recipe that I liked.  An added plus was that the leftovers were wonderful as well!  Definately a "must try" for the hesitant hunter's wife!

Was good and easy. Made the texture and taste of our old, frozen, elk tenderloin, not so bad. I cut the tenderloin up into thin slices and put them in 2 - 1 gallon plastic bags and pounded them with a hammer. I had to fry the steaks in batches since I had more pieces. (BTW...1 cup of flour was more than enough to coat all of the pieces and I ended up throwing a lot away). Didn't use ground bay leaves because we didn't have any and did not substitute it with anything else. Used canola oil instead of olive because I was out of olive oil. Used about 1 1/2 tbsp. of fresh, chopped garlic because we love it. Used 6 brown (also known as cremini or baby portabellas) mushrooms because we don't eat white domestic and I wish we had used more because personally I would have liked mushrooms in every bite. They tasted really good in this recipe. Thanks for the recipe. It's a nice change from the usual fried steak with cream gravy. I'll use it for beef and I'm sure it will taste even better! Also, the gravy was delicious with egg noodles instead of potatoes!

Almost perfect but I swapped white wine for beef
broth and I thought the flavor was exceptional!
White wine seems to go best with venison despite
the rules. Using beef broth with venison runs contrary to my tastes.

This was terrific!  I used a dry gravy mix instead of canned, swapped red wine for the milk, and used a whole package of fresh mushrooms.  It was delicious with horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used sirlion steaks instead of venison steaks and I didn't have any beef gravy, so I used white cooking wine.  I also left out the milk.  The recipe turned out great.  I also cut the flour mixture in half and I still had a lot of mixture left over.  Overall, my husband and I thought this was a great recipe.

Very good and well received by my family, even the kids! I made mine with cube steaks (although I would be interested to try it with venison someday if the "boys" went out hunting, or I was feeling extravagant enough to buy some.) I was a little leary of using canned gravy, but didn't have the time to add the extra step of making my own. However, the richness of the onion and mushroom gave it a very authentic flavor, you could still taste the "canniness" but not very much. I also would recommend to anyone trying this with cube steaks, simmer it for more like 2 hours as mine was still pretty tough after 1 hour. I'm planning on trying it in my slow cooker the next time I make it, and using canned consumme to make the gravy. All in all, an excellent dinner, I wouldn't serve it to company because it's not the prettiest presentation in the world, but around the table over a pile of mashed potatoes it really satisfied.

This was excellent.  We also eat venison a couple times a week so are always on the lookout for good recipes and this is a definate keeper.  Didnt use ground bay leaves-really who has that.  But it was great without it.

This recipe was great. Instead of canned gravy, I made my own or used a dry mix. My family loves this and it has become a regular dish on our table.

The only exception I had was no ground bay leaves on hand, so I used 1 Tbsp of Italian Seasonings and 1 Tbsp of Oregano.  It was very tender and made a great gravy - just needed a sprinkling of salt.  We will enjoy this again.

Always looking for good venison recipes -- this one is a KEEPER!  I unfortunately can't have mushrooms, so I subbed by sauteing yellow bell pepper with the onion.  Also, didn't have beef gravy so used 2 packs of powdered turkey gravy mix mixed with equal parts water/milk -- turned out GREAT!  Will try with beef gravy next time; sure the results will be just as delicious!

My brother gave us some venison and I wasn't sure how to cook it. I stumbled across this recipe and decided to give it a try...boy am I glad I did! My daughter's boyfriend ate with us and he keeps asking when I'm going to make it again! Absolutely yummy, I can't wait until my brother gives us more venison!

This was fantasic! I was not taught how to fry foods!  By the time I was married and had children everything was baked so it would be "healthy"  I feel like I have been "mentored" to learn the art of frying cube steak and gravy just like the "old days".  Thank you for your help!

I followed this to the t, except I used white wine like others suggested.  Normally I love the flavor cooking with wine gives a meal, in this case, I dont know if cooking with tabasco could have given this dish flavor.  I had some of the most incredible venison backstrap and unfortunately chose to cook it with this recipe.  20 minutes later I had a big pot of blannnnnndddddd, chewy, ruined meat, it honestly tasted worse than chuck.  What is funny is I had a few pieces that didnt fit into the pan so I just tossed them on another one for a minute a side with some steak seasoning and they were incredible.  Should have done that to all of them instead of wasting the last of my backstrap.  Sorry but I would have give this a zero stars if possible

I was a little leary about making this but it turned out great.  I did make a few changes.  To the dry mixture I added spices and herbs.  I also added about a half cup of pancake mix.  Instead of adding canned gravy I added a can of mushroom soup plus 1 and half cups of beef broth and half a packet of onion soup mix.  I also kept the two seperate and laddled the gravy on the steak and potatoes just before serving.

I used Elk and canned mushrooms.  The Elk was very tender and didn't taste gamey at all.

This was really tasty. I had trouble with the bay leaves. I don't have an herb grinder so it wasn't very finely ground but it was still good. Thanks for the recipe

Really, a fantastic recipe.  I made this last night, useing pounded out cube steaks, and they turned out fantastic.  I had to make my own gravy, which was defiantely a plus, and I didn't add the mushrooms- mainly because it didn't feel like a mushroom night. Anyone looking for a recipe for smothered steak, this is one to try.

This was great.  The venison came out nice and tender.  The only things I did different were to make my own gravy, and didn't have ground bay leaf, so threw a couple in for the simmer.

My husband and I made this a few nights ago and he LOVED it! Instead of fresh mushrooms we used a 4 oz can of mushrooms other than that we followed the recipe exactly. The meat was very tender and did not taste gamey at all. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is so wonderful!! I used two packs or dry gravy mix instead because that is what I use to make salisbury steak, and it came out great.  I have already made this twice and I will make it many times more. It is great.

I didn't use venison; I used beef round top instead.  I must say that this was really good.  I cut the recipe in half and made it for my boyfriend and I.  He devoured it instantly.  I like the consistency of the gravy too.  I wouldn't cook it all the time due to the fat content, but definately will be a nice staple to have.  Served with roasted red potatoes and veggies.

It's sooooo easy to make your own gravy for this dish if you use the pan drippings, a little flour and beef (or venison) stock. A good hardy meal none-the-less.

It was good but the flavour wasn't exactly our favorite.  I think the bay leaves were a little much.  I didn't want to pound the meat as thin as stated because I knew the venison wasn't on the tough side. Made lots of gravy.  I probably won't make this again.
