Fabulous dish!  I have found a few recipes that I consider restaurant quality, and this is definitely one of them.  I added a bag of frozen scallops with the juices and still had lots of sauce...enough to add a veggie next time.  I used regular mustard seeds and they tasted wonderful.  The spices blend nicely, yet you can taste them individually at times too.  This deserves more than 5 stars!

I initially made this as written, and I have to agree with the other reviewers who said it was lacking flavor. However, with a few tweaks, this was one of the best Indian dishes I have made in a long long  time. You just have to play around with the spices until it's how you like it (obviously). Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic. My picky eater husband licked his plate clean. 
This is definitely a keeper. I too omitted the mustard seeds, I didn't have them. Not sure why others found the recipe bland. With all the spices it was very flavorful.

Nice recipe, could use a wee bit of heat though (and I am not a fan of spicy foods!)  I didn't have black mustard seeds on hand so I used yellow mustard seeds.  Be aware that when you put the seeds in, it only takes 5-10 seconds for them to start popping.  I had the skillet lid handy and took it off the heat and covered it for about 30 seconds until they finished... otherwise they fly all over your kitchen.  I also added bay scallops and thought they tasted even better than the shrimp did.  Definitely worth making again!

Have made this a few times and it is awesome.  I did make one minor change just to add a bit more flavor and that was to add about 1-2 tbsp of a hot red curry paste that I had on hand, and I am not much of a cilantro fan so I only added it to taste.

This dish was very good.  When I make it again I might add a few more spices though.  I also recomend doubling the sauce.  A few more shrimp might help as well.  My husband and even our dinner guest really enjoyed it.  It was TERRIFIC as lefovers.  I would give it a try for sure.  Be creative!

I was extremely pleased with the ease of preparation and the taste.  Excellent!  I expected the recipe to be a bit on the spicy side, but it wasn't - even my 4 year old ate her share!

I made this with chicken instead of prawns. Started by browning the chicken then removing from pan. I then added the dry spices to hot oil & cooked for a few minutes, then added an onion along with the garlic & chili, then added the chicken back in & the coconut milk. I let it cook for an hour as I wanted the chicken to be tender. The flavour got stronger the longer it cooked. Just before serving I added the fresh corriander & lemon juice. It was nice but not wonderful.

The first time I cooked this meal, I substituted prawns for the shrimps, and served it with rice. It was fine, but I wanted to give it a try with shrimps, though. It is actually better with shrimps, but you gotta have a very large pan (a wok could come in handy for this recipe), because if you want shrimps to be cooked, you gonna need some space. I didn't have jalapeno, so I added a bit more than 1 tablespoon sambal (pureed chiles). It was fine for me, but some found it too spicy. Definitely use a LOT of cilantro.

Excellent...loved this!  Used crushed red pepper flakes as I did not have ground red pepper and had to omit the mustard seeds as I didn't notice them until I was already committed to the recipe (never bought before!)  Served over rice and had steamed broccoli and found this to be full of flavour.  Hubby and really enjoyed!

I tried a simpler variation on this recipe that didn't require a run to the store.  I didn't have lemon juice, cumin, red pepper, cilantro, or jalapeno so I left those out and doubled the tomato paste.  I didn't have shrimp or coconut milk so I substituted tofu and skim milk and added coconut flakes.  I served over rice noodles.  Despite missing 1/2 the ingredients it was still amazing!  I'll definitely make it again.

Surprisingly quick, easy and extremely delicious. Just like other reviewers, I was at first put off by the smell of the sauce, but it turned out very yummy, and when combined with the shrimp and heated through, it became pleasantly fragrant. The spices complement each other well and combine into a very delightful bouquet both in smell and taste. 

I wanted to share a picture of this, but the food was gone faster that I could remember where my camera was... :)

Nope, I guess if I would have found a premade garam masala it would have been better.  I made mine from scratch and the cloves never work well unless you totally destroy them.  Nasty taste!  To address something ---prawns are shrimp, just bigger--it should not make any diff

This was wonderful! Nice and creamy, with just the right amount of spices. The coconut flavor really came through, but it wasn't overpowering. I used regular mustard seeds instead of black, and olive oil instead of vegetable, and I took another reviewer's suggestion and added some scallops--delicious! I'd make the sauce by itself and serve it over basmati rice or quinoa, it's so good.

I've made this recipe many times and there are never any leftovers. I follow the recipe exactly with the exception that I don't use the tablespoon of tomato paste since I don't like to waste the entire can just for a tablespoon of paste. I think it's only for the color anyway. I also use  the whole can of coconut milk since it's already opened and it doesn't seem to affect the taste of the sauce and it just makes more sauce which is positive since most people enjoy the sauce better then the shrimp.

Very good, easy to follow recipe, Don't forget the rice and nan. Not too spicy, but I didn't add the jalapeno seeds. I just added some more red chilli powder to taste.

I frequently cook Indian food, so I am no novice.  This dish was coming together nicely until I tasted the sauce.  It had a funky, almost spoiled flavor.  Since I was sipping wine as I cooked (a habit I'm quite fond of), I thought that maybe my palate was compromised from the wine, so I had my husband taste the sauce.  He thought it tasted "off" as well.  Luckily, I had sauted the shrimp and removed it from the pan before adding the sauce, out of fear that it would overcook.  We made a quick scampi out of the shrimp and threw out the sauce.  This recipe is the biggest disappointment I have encountered on this site.  Sorry.

I took some liberty with this but it came out awesome.  First, I didn't use shrimp, I used chicken.  I didn't have mustard seeds so I used a tsp. of regular mustard.  Also didn't have tomato paste so I used 1 Tbsp. ketchup and cut the sugar and salt in half. Decreased oil to 1 Tbsp. Didn't have cilantro or the jalepeno, left them out.  Also added a little tumeric and a tiny bit of thyme to the spices.  I also used a very liberal hand with the other spices.  Didn't need the cornstarch.  Served over rice and lentils and I and my fiance loved it!  Also added a half a bag of frozen green and red peppers and onions to add a veggie factor.

this is great stuff. i used some cayenne pepper instead of ground red pepper(i like spice). but the spices and the "fire" of the dish mix so well with the creamy taste of the coconut and really compliment the shrimp. i think serrano peppers would also be great. thanks for the fantastic recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this one.  He's Pakistani, and he paid it one of his greatest compliments--I could serve it to his family.  For them, I would probably add a tiny bit more spicy stuff, but it tasted great the way it was.  I served it over rice and with roasted asparagus.  Fantastic.

This recipe is Amazing!.....  A must make!.... The only thing I did different was I added a little extra garlic and added a little Sriracha cuz I like it with a little more spice, the recipe is mild.

I loved this recipe, it was something different. It had some heat to it but wasn't spicy like cayenne pepper is. I couldn't find any garam masala so I just used the recipe on this site and it tasted just fine although I have no clue what garam masala taste like. I made it as is but next time I'm going to try adding scallops.

Delicious recipe- the only change I made was to add some fresh chopped homegrown garden tomatoes since I had some  on hand- a very positive addition indeed! I also freshly ground my cumin seed resulting in a more pungent cumin taste-- yum.....

I made this a couple nights ago for an Indian themed dinner party that I hosted...it was a hit! I doubled the amount of sauce. I didn't have mustard seed so I omitted it. I followed the advice of other reviewers and add scallops with the shrimp.  I added a small onion, chooped with the garlic and I added 1 tbsp of red curry paste.The flavour and spices were perfect. For those who are not fans of spicy dishes I would follow the recipe as it's written and add more spices to taste along the way. Served over basmati rice.

So good! Double the sauce -  that's the best part! I also added additional lemon juice to balance the flavors better.

Very good recipe - I omitted the mustard seeds since I didn't have them, and added mushrooms in with the garlic. I also added a tsp of red pepper since we like our food spicy! Next time, I'm going to add onions in as well. Served over basmati rice - my husband had 3 helpings!

Very Delicious, and easy too. Even with a store run to pick up a jalapeno and tomato paste, this came together in about 30 minutes. Served with rice, and saag with paneer from a pouch. It is a very rich meal.

This is restaurant-quality for sure.  I added a little chilli powder for extra heat.  My boyfriend is Indian & went crazy for it!  Also, followed recipe to a "T" and it was a crowd pleaser!!! Also, served over basmati rice. Thanks :)

I was not blown away by this at all. I adjusted the spices - but still did not find it very flavourful - and there was way too much salt. The only difference was that I used sea salt. So don't!!

This is a good recipe.  We did not alter the recipe in anyway except for the omission of black mustard seeds (we couldn't find them).  I would recommend doubling the sauce.  It is not an "attractive" dish but it is very tasty.  Serve over rice.  Enjoy!

Very easy, a bit bland though. Be sure not to have your heat turned up too high when you go to add the mustard seeds - they like to shot up at you!

The sauce was very good. The flavor reminded me of a wonderful Madras soup that a local restaurant serves. Next time I would probably kick up the spices a bit and substitute the shrimp for something else.

This was fine. Nothing special. I had to sub Greek yogurt for the coconut milk. It's better to toast the spices with the shrimp first and then add the sauce. I didn't add the cornstarch mixture.

I think the amount of coconut milk deadens the flavor and that’s why some people found it bland. I halved the coconut milk and doubled the tomato paste, and it tasted great. This also made thickening with cornstarch unnecessary.

Made this last night for supper. Very tasty and pretty easy to make. I made it with half pound shrimp and pound and a half of tilapia. Didn't need the cornstarch to make a thick sauce. the fish flaked into small pieces plus I used the  whole can of tomato paste  and a whole 13 ounce can of  coconut milk. I didn't have mustard seeds so I just used regular mustard.  Watch out if you use it, cause it was splattering just like the mustard seeds do !! I added a couple of sliced red peppers and more fresh cilantro. Served it over white rice. YUM !!!!!

I used Cajun garlic steamed shrimp so omitted the sugar, red pepper and jalapeño. Also had to sub 4 oz of tomato sauce vs paste as that is what I had on hand. Made the sauce, through in the cooked shrimp and thickened as noted. Served over riced cauliflower with spicy eggplant from this site and Naan bread. My husband said I should start a cooking show, high compliments!!

We devoured this! It was spicy and full of flavor. The only change I made was to use yellow mustard seeds instead of black, out of necessity. The best part? Prep and cook time combined was less than the amount of time required to make the pot of rice to serve it over! I'll happily keep this recipe on hand.

great combo of flavors. I added a little chili powder to heat it up a little. I also nearly doubled the sauce amount since that is all the flavor.

My husband and all 4 kids loved it.  I doubled the sauce but not the shrimp.  I added in a bunch of chopped spinach and  substituted lime juice for lemon juice.  The only other change was that I left out the jalepeno peppers because I didn't want it too spicy for the baby.

I went out to a "good" store with great spice selection to be sure to get quality spices and fresh seafood. What a disappointment it turned out to be. Bland, no flavor, just a feeling of heat from the jalapeño and red pepper. The creamy texture was rather nice.

I followed this recipe as stated and it was wonderful!  Next time, I'll add a little more jalapeños for some extra heat, but that's just adjusting to my preference.  The recipe is solid as written.  Thank you for sharing!

Not great, but not bad. I personally think I'd leave out the pepper - I'm not a "spicy" person and too much black pepper is too spicy for me. My husband likes spicy and he said it was pretty spicy as well, so maybe I'm not over-feeling it this time. Also, a lot less oil - my end result was WAY oily. But it's not a bad taste. I'm relatively new to Indian food. Although I found it spicy, there is also flavor there rather than just being spicy and burning your face off. Especially with the shrimp and over some basmati rice? Mmmm...

Very easy to make, had most ingredients on hand. Omitted jalapeno, cilantro and tomato paste cause I didn't wanna make a run to the store. Added additional red pepper flakes cause DH likes it spicy. He's just starting his 2nd bowl. I saved some of the additional sauce I made for chicken tomorrow as I'm not a fan of shrimp. Super tasty.  Super easy, what's not to like.

I really enjoyed this recipe! The preparation was very easy, and I thought there was a substantial amount of flavor. I didn't need the extra 1/4lb of shrimp, so I would recommend only using 1lb so that you have enough curry. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne powder to my dish to give it a little extra heat. Such a delicious and flavorful dish!

Omitted the sugar, it doesn't need it. Used yellow mustard seeds instead of black. I also used shrimp instead of chicken. Overall this dish is excellent a the perfect amount of spice somewhere between mild and medium.

I didn't have the black mustard seeds so I used a little less than 1 tsp. of dijon mustard in the oil. I also didn't have enough cilantro but used what I had and it was very good.  I used another reviewer's idea and used red pepper flakes instead of ground red pepper.  This recipe's a keeper; very good taste and not too spicy.

Great recipe, I added about 1 cup of frozen peas and 1 large red bell pepper to the sauce just because it seems to lack nutrition without the vegetables. It turned out better than ever by adding those veggies. I also cooked the sauce first than added the shrimp in for a few minutes on each side after the sauce was close to a thickness I desired. This prevented the shrimp from overcooking. My man loved this dish over brown rice and can't wait to have it again! Great flavors!

Very good, with an authentic Indian flavor.  After reading the other reviews regarding how mild it tasted, I went a little heavier on the ground red pepper.  It ended up being almost too hot.  I would suggest making the recipe excactly as written first, then making adjustments to suit tastes.

A+.  Flavors blended together nicely and was relatively easy to prepare.  I felt like I was at my favorite Indian resturant.  I will definitely make this again.

We liked this a lot.  It was quick and easy to make, and I had just about all ingredients on hand....(no mustard seeds).  Served over basmati rice.  This is a keeper for sure!

This is not a gourmet dish, but I give it 5 stars as it is my favorite kind of weeknight meal - easy to prepare with staple ingredients and very satisfying, with just enough left over for lunch. I have made it twice with absolutely no changes. Oh, wait, I might have used some ghee in place of oil....

This recipe is magnificent!  So flavorful and easy.  Things I did differently: I didn't have black mustard seeds so I just omitted that step, I had sliced, jarred jalepenos so I cut a few of those up and I used peanut oil instead of vegetable.  It was great over rice.  I will definitely use again.  Thank you!
