This is my recipe. You will need 2 previously frozen bananas, thawed. 

It is the freezing that causes the sugars and moister to crystallize, and when thawed it provides the necessary liquid (along with the eggs) to make the batter.

Here is a link to my original recipe:

The cake was super easy to put together, I used two previously frozen bananas as CDabis suggested. I didn't have any coconut so I left it out and I substituted chopped walnuts for the pecans.  It was done in less than an hour so I suggest you check on it after 35 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake with no adjustments 3 days ago. My ladies card club all wanted the recipe and raved about the taste.  I have another one in the oven in a bundt pan now.  My husband wanted to try it too!  Thanks for the recipe.  Sue

This was a very tasty coffee cake. More like banana bread with atopping. The topping is way too sweet. Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar and maybe the powdered sugar.
 I substituted blueberry pie filling, so the color was off.
