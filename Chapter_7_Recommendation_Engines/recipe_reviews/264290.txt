I was excited about making this. I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, it was very bland. No flavor.  Will not make again. But, love mostly all of Chef Johnâ€™s other recipes. This just did not cut it for us.

It was a creative idea and turned out better than I thought. We had it on pasta mixed with roasted veggies and chicken sausage.  My family found the texture to be offputting, but I may not have thinned it enough with the pasta water. I wasn't sure what the final consistency should be. We all loved the flavor though. I reccommend cutting down the salt. I tasted it after adding the full amount and wished I could have taken half out. I ended up using some of the lemon juice to help balance it.

Surprisingly easy and enjoyed the non-cream sauce.  I probably went a little crazy with the Cayenne pepper (making it a true arrabiata sauce was not my intent) but still GREAT!

Sooo good!  Used fresh store bought prosciutto  tortellini instead of dry pasta, and added broccolini in the last minute of the pasta boil. This is a keeper!

This is amazing.
You need to be extra careful to whisk quickly and temper well, and don't go crazy on the heat once you've added the sauce to the pan.

I've made it with pesto, romesco and curry spices and it's always great.

Girlfriend loves it.

I really wanted to like this recipe, I love ricotta, and even made fresh homemade ricotta for this recipe. But I found the entire recipe a bit bland, and tasted way too much like lemon
