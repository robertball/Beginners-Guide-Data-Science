I was a little hesitant at first, I gave it a chance and it was very good. I kicked it up a few by adding tsp cayenne, tsp garlic, 2 tbsp blackened redfish magic, it was very good, suprised how well it turned out with very few base ingredients.

I am not a food snob so I don't turn my nose at a simple soup can sauce. It was fast and easy, and we all need a quick and simple recipie, from time to time. I added two cloves of chopped garlic, two teaspoons of creole seasoning, and topped it off with Italian parsley as a garnish. Then it was realy great!
