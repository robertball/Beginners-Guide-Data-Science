THis was very good, I really enjoyed eating it. Although, the only thing, it left a bad after taste. I'm thinking from the limes. I will make this again because I really love it but I will not cook the chicken with the limes. Instead will just squeeze lime juice over the top when finished cooking. Thanks for the recipe! The pasta was yummy too. I used penne rigate.

This recipe was pretty good but needed something else. I omitted the tomatoes but added broccoli to the pasta. The pasta needed some other spice, salt at least. Also, I think I might have liked the chicken better had it not been breaded. Loved the lime flavor though and will probably try again with a few tweaks.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it I don't know how many times now, and I think I've got it down to perfection for my family, so here are my changes for anyone interested! :) I don't like it with small shell pasta; it's better with something larger, bow-tie or even egg noodles.  And I add a bunch of FRESH chopped basil to the pasta. Yum. I add chopped onion in the pan with the garlic.  I double dip the chicken piece because it does get a bit soggy.  I do not add the tomatoes. Takes away from the lime flavor I think.  I lOVE the limes with the chicken- absolutely delicious.  I top it off with a mound of shredded mozerella. We LOVE IT!!! Thanks!

This is a very good dish esp. if you want a lighter pasta sauce as opposed to alfredo or something heavy.  It is a quick easy very tasty choice for dinner.  Add a salad and its perfect.

Really enjoyed this meal (as did my roommate). The recipe is easy to follow (we're not great cooks & still had no problems making).  We used the tomatoes which really made the dish.  Agree that chicken does not have to be breaded if you would like to make it a bit healthier.  The lime, wine & garlic combination worked well and we will definetly try again.

I LOVE this. Made a few changes...I didn't bread the chicken, I just left it as it was, since I read that it can get soggy. I also read that the rind can make the dish taste bitter, so I squeezed the limes over the chicken and then added a bit of the fruit (sans rind) to the mixture. My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe, and will be making it again. The leftovers were even great!

I don't like giving such a low rating but this dish was not very good not horrible but not good.  The acidic lime after-taste was waaay to overpowering and the breadcrumb was all soggy and fell right off the chicken(I even pre-coated chicken with flour to make sure it stuck real good)  I personally just don't think chicken and lime make a great combination-I'll stick to lemon!
Thanks anyway!

Awesome!  I loved this chicken!  I added more parmesan to the crumbs, I used a little more butter in both recipes.  I also used the bottled lime juice.  I will make this a regular!  Thanks!

I really was not pleased with this recipe because I followed it to the original recipe and the limes over powered the taste of everything else.

My husband said it was the best thing I'd made in awhile.  I cook a wide variety of things so this was quite a compliment.  I did use the juice of 2 limes rather than the whole lime and I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic.  My kids (12 and 8) also loved it.  This will be a staple from now on.

Everyone in the family ate it, so what more can ask for?  A few changes...I didn't bread the chicken, used the juice of 2 limes instead of the lime wedges, and used fresh diced tomatoes.  Yummy!!

This was really good. The only things I did differently were to cut the chicken up into large pieces and using lime juice instead of actual limes.

I read the reviews on this recipe and decided to take everyone's advice.  I peeled the lime so it wouldn't be sour and did not bread the chicken.  It was wonderful.  I think it would taste great with artichokes.

We squeezed the limes over the chicken as some reviewer suggested, but it ended up being a little overpowering.

Very good ~ cooked as the recipe stated but used Pinot Grigio for the white wine.  Very good ~ unique taste.  The chicken was very juicy - but not soggy at all.  Recommend!

Overall the recipe was great. Either I had a lime that was too sour, or I would use 1 next time instead of 2. It was delicious!

Love it!!!

As is popular here. I didn't bread the chicken, nor did I use lime pulp. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and sauteed with onions, and added artichoke hearts as well. Here is my take:

Start Sauce 1st: (meanwhile, start water boiling & cook PASTA)
Saute 1 SLICED ONION in OLIVE OIL, then CHICKEN , when cooked, sprinkle with 2 TBL FLOUR, then cook 2 mins and deglaze with 1C WHITE WINE.
Add 1 CAN ART HEARTS, 1 CAN TOMATOES, 1 LIME'S JUICE, 2 CLOVES CRUSHED GARLIC, and 2 generous pinches of SALT to sauce. Simmer.
When pasta is el dente, drain. Add 2 TBL BUTTER & 2 TBL OLIVE OIL to pan, & quickly saute 2 CLOVES CRUSHED GARLIC. add PASTA, 1C SHREDDED PARM, 2BIG PICHES SALT, GRD PEPPER, and CHOPPED PARSLEY. stir well. 
Place pasta on plates 1st, then ladle sauce over, and more parm on top.

YUMMY!

Nice flavor in my opinion.  My kids seemed to like it, also.  My husband did not like it much.  I didn't bread the chicken for fear of sogginess.  I felt that there was too much butter/oil.  I think if I make it again I will cut WAY back...especially if I'm not breading anything.  I liked the lime flavor.  I squeezed the juice of 1 lime in and cooked the other lime in the sauce as written.  That part turned out just right.  I also liked the pasta preparation prior to putting the sauce on.  I will remember that every time I serve pasta...not just with this dish.  Added a very good layer of flavor and texture.  Thanks for a great start...I will probably play with this and get it closer to my own family's tastes.

Amazing, delicious, and not as time consuming to make as I originally anticipated. Plenty of leftovers, and still delicious the next day.

With a few changes, my husband and I LOVED it!  Now remember I am in a lime phase...  I omitted the breading as many suggested and used fresh tomatoes. Also, I don't think the type pasta really matters, but dressing it first according to the recipe was a plus.  We will definitely make it again and again.

Delicious.  My husband was late so my chicken stayed stewing in the tomatoes and wine longer than planned and it was still very tender and flavorful.  The kids liked it too.  Definitely a keeper.  My husband wanted the breading "crispier" on the chicken, but then he should've gotten home on time!

It didn't quite seem to work out like I wanted it too . . . I think part of the problem was my skillet wasn't big enough so it took awhile for the chicken to brown.  I didn't bread the chicken, made it seem healthier (like the rest of the dish).  The pasta portion was great, and though the cooking of the chicken was a bit chaotic, it ended up tasting very good!

We used a cold shrimp salad for a side dish which also had some lime in it (as well as soy and ginger - called Caribbean Holiday Shrimp on here), so they made a great pair!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  It was out of this world!  The flavor was GREAT!!!  I cooked it in my cast iron and the chicken did not get soggy like some said.  The flavor of the lime, garlic, wine and tomatoes  yumy!!  I didn't and wouldn't change a thing!

This was really great and it also tasted great reheated the next day. I made it almost exactly the same as the recipe said, I only made a few changes. I love cheese, so I added lots more. I also added more parsley, and I used bow tie noodles instead of shells. Also, I used a Pino Grigio for the white wine... which tasted excellent cooked with the chicken.

It was not very good at all. I managed to eat it but I'd never cook it again. I think it was the limes that made is so bad.
