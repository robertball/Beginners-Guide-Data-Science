Great recipe! It was pretty quick and easy and very good. There were a couple major adjustments however that I made. I ended up using about 1/2 cup half and half, since I didnt have heavy cream on hand. Either way 1/8 would not have been enough. Also 1 pound of mushrooms seemed like a bit much, I ended up using 2 small cans of mushrooms instead. I just didnt saute them. Thirdly 5 teaspoons seemed a bit outrageous, and this is from someone who loves pepper. I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper instead. Fourthly, insyead of using 2 tablespoons of Paprika, I started with one teaspoon and from there added a little more to taste. And lastly, had I added 3 cups of cheddar cheese, we may as well have had nachos, so I just added about 1 1/2 cups. It turned out great!

I hadn't read any of the reviews before I made this dish and found it to be absolutely amazing  that people would actually use 5 tsps. of pepper and then complain that there was too much pepper in this recipe! I used about 3/4 of a tsp. and it was delicious. Thanks shadowhawk!

Delicious! I added a bit more soup than it called for and to cut down on the calories and fat I used a fat free mushroom soup and instead of cream I used 1% milk. It was really good and I WILL make it again!

It's a good recipe. As other reviewers, i didn't use pepper as much. I modified the recipe to my taste and ingredients i had at the time. I used penne pasta, used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. I didn't have condensed cream of mushroom, so i used condensed cream of potato and pureed it. I also used the can of breast chicken which already salty, so i didn't use any salt for seasoning.  Added some mozarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese. and seasoned with pinch of herbs for final touch.
And it turned out really good!!

I honestly thought there was a mistake w/the measurements in this recipe.  WAY too much pepper, paprika and cheese.  Not nearly enough cream.  I followed the recipe exact.

First, make sure you add the pepper to taste!  If you dump in the whole amount I think you will be rather disappointed!  I also added the paprika to taste.  Instead of canned cream of mushroom soup, I made my own to avoid all the additives: sauteed some chopped 'shrooms in butter, added some garlic and sauteed a few minutes more.  Then added some flour, cooked out the starchy flavor a bit, then added some milk, and then some chicken stock (which I boiled and strained after I poached and cubed the chicken for this recipe), and a dollop of sour cream. Seasoned with salt, pepper and added some parsley.  Tasted WAY better than the canned stuff, YUM!  Unfortunately, the final result of the overall recipe was nothing that made us say "wow."   Seemed as though it was missing something but couldn't put a finger on it.   Was alright but I don't know that I would make it again.

I lowered the calories in this recipe by using half the cheese, skim milk, and 2 tbsp of nonfat yogurt, no margarine and spraying my pan with olive oil! And still great on taste!

We had leftover roast chicken from Christmas and I had a can of mushroom soup sitting in the cupboard so I randomly searched for a recipe using both ingredients. I had the rest of the ingredients so I decided to give it a try. It was creamy and delicious! Easy meal to prepare! :)

I halved the pepper and added more cream and milk. This serves 5 if they have huge appetites, more like 6-8 if average.

My family and I found this recipe lacked punch. Except for the pepper (which it certainly had a lot of), it was flavourless.

...For us, the sauce is just tooooo thick!  Had to add some chicken stock at the end to get the right consistency. Used a few grinds of pepper and a dash of paprika and served over egg noodles...Was easy but the end result was not to our liking.

The recipe was alright, although I'm not sure if I would make it again.  I personally found it to have too much garlic and I only used 2.5 cloves.  I used 2 tsp of pepper and that was perfect for my tastes!

My hubby loved this. It was filling, spicy and good. Next time I make it I am going to use a little less than 5 teaspoons of pepper and a little less paprika, but it was awesome!

This was gooooooood!  I did, however, make some changes.  First of all, I tripled the recipe.  I used penne pasta and cooked it seperately.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in about 1/2 cup of garlic-butter spread.  Then I threw in 21 oz worth of white button mushrooms, sliced. I added 3 cans of condensed mushroom soup and about 1 1/2 cup of skim milk.  I added 3 or 4 cups of cooked spicy chicken, chopped and covered the pot and let it simmer for about 15 or so minutes. It was little on the soup side but tasted great!  I poured this on top of my pasta and grated some medium Cheddar cheese on it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe for a crowd and they all really enjoyed it. We loved the creamy sauce and ate almost all of it. Everyone wanted the leftovers for work the next day. I will definately make it again.  Maybe tonight???

This was really great.  Didn't use as much pepper as called for.  Used a powdered milk instead of cream and used 1/2 Cup instead of 1/8.  Make it all the time.

This is a great recipe! I make the sauce only,  and serve over grilled chicken. I am sure the pasta and cut up chicken make a great dish also, but 1 cook for 50 people and above so it's easier to just grill the chicken and it looks good on the plate.  I do cut back on the pepper some and add milk if it's to thick. I have started using Velveeta instead of cheddar for a creamier sauce. This sauce is also great on hamburgers and some put it on steaks!  This is a 5 star sauce!

OMG!!!  I made this the other day for my family and we all LOVE it!!!  It's super easy and delicious!  I think when I make it again (which I definitely will!), I'll cut the pepper back to only 3 tsp, rather than 5, but otherwise, this was a winner!

Holy pepper Batman! This was a stringy peppery mess of a meal...but if it wasn't for the excessive amount of pepper it would have been good.

Easy to prepare but finished product looks unappetizing. It didn't taste very good for a dish that calls for so many fattening ingredients: cheese, butter, and heavy cream.  Decided not to eat it after all.

We loved it.   I added a can of cream of chicken and cut down the pepper and paprika and used half and half cream instead.  For the two of us it made more than enough with a bit left over for tomorrow.   Very good recipe...thanks.

I really did not like this recipe at all.  I ended up throwing the whole thing away.  There was waaayy too much pepper and paprika and I didn't even use all that the recipe called for.

Loved this!  I doubled the cream (I used half'n half) and used less pepper as mentioned previously.  I just have to say that it is even better as left overs!  I cut up a sausage and mixed it in. YUMMY a microwaved left over delight! Thanks

I must've done something wrong w/this recipe.  First, I had to use much more liquid than the 1/8 cup cream called for--I barely had any sauce--I added another 1/2 of milk.  Then, I only added half the amount of cheese because the mixture was so think I could barely stir it in the pot. Also, as stated in other reviews--I didn't use anything near the amount of pepper called for.  I used about 1 t and that seemed to be ample. Having said that, it still had a pretty good taste, but my family isn't dying for me to make it again.

Tastes great if you add only 1 tablespoon of pepper - 5 tablespoons is way too excessive.
