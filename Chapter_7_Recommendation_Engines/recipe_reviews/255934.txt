This recipe is delicious. It’s not quite as good as the Chinese restaurant up the street but it’s still very nice. I added celery, julienne carrots and green onions. I also used dark meat because it tastes way better. I’ve never been to an authentic Chinese food restaurant that uses breast meat over dark but that’s an argument for another day. I also drastically reduced the amount of pepper (especially the white pepper). It does taste good with the full amount of pepper but I have young children whose pallets aren’t quite up to the kick yet. Definitely a make again

I followed the basic recipe except opted not to do the crispy noodle part. Chose to make it with soft noodles. Also found the flavoring to be a bit bland so I increased the oyster sauce and used Bragg's Liquid Aminos in place of soy sauce and then added some hoisin sauce for added flavor. Came out delicious!

I grew up eating Cantonese Chicken Chow Mein, which seems to be the same as Hong Kong style. The difference is the chicken sits on top of these crispy noodles. This recipe is very close to total deliciousness. I'd add a little more soy sauce and oyster sauce. I also like to add veg but this recipe on it's own is the real thing. Please try this,  it's so much better than normal chow mein

I didn’t have a wok so I used a frying pan. And I replaced the white pepper for garlic. It came out great! Got lots of compliments from the family.

I’ve been looking for a recipe comparable to restaurant style Cantonese Chow Mein. This is a very tasty recipe. I followed it basically to a tee (except for an addition of broccoli, carrots, and celery) and found it flavourful. The family loved it, my husband went for seconds. I didn’t have light soy sauce so used regular and it was fine.

My kids loved this!  It doesn't taste exactly like how it does at a restaurant but it's pretty tasty.  Don't do what I did-I just left the noodles to cool in the strainer and it got stuck in one big clump.  Very good idea to separate while hot so it's easier to fry.

Yup, I made changes.
Instead of frying noodles, I cheated and bought a bag of crispy chow mein noodles.
To the onions and sprouts, I added sliced shallot, a few sliced mushrooms, thinly sliced celery, some sliced snow peas, and some sliced water chestnuts. Instead of sake, I used Sherry.  Added dry mustard and garlic to the sauce. 
Went over VERY well in our house. Will make again for sure!
