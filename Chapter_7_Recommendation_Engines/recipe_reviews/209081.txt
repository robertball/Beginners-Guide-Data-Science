This was a very fulfilling dessert. I would say next time I would decrease the extract to 1/2 tsp or use a different one.  The liquid reminded me too much of maraschino cherries because of the extract.  Otherwise, it was very tasty.

Didn't like it at all. Well the sauce was good to me. I loved the maraschino cherry flavor as the other reviewer mentioned. So that got the 2nd star.
