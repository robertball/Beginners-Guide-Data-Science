I love lemon and was needing a recipe for a potluck. Firstly, I halved the recipe with no problems but the crumb topping, even halved, was WAY too much. However, I think I also put on too little because when baked it got a little crunchy which was very yummy, but it could/should have been crunchier so I should have been much more generous with the topping. I would also stress that the real lemon flavor is in the glaze so I glazed more than once. The glaze itself I made thicker and whiter with more confectioners sugar and then added more lemon juice accordingly. All in all, sweet and lemony and pretty good!

These are great muffins - really lemony and very tender and light. To get only 24, however, you should use the larger muffin tins. I used the regular sized ones and ended up with 48 muffins. BUT - in using the regular size I had just enough struesel topping for all 48. So there's the trade-off.

I made these for my mom, she was visiting.  She loves anything lemon and these do not disappoint.  The lemon flavor was fanastic, as was the bit of a crunch from the topping and the glaze.  Be careful this does make WAY to much topping, it was a shame to toss it.  I made mini muffins instead of regular sized ones.  Perfect in the morning or whenever you want a treat!  The kids liked them too.  Thenks Chikee for making me think of these!!  And thanks Carol for the recipe!

These are loaded with lemony goodness.  I did end up with quite a bit of the crumbly topping left over which basically meant a waste of ingredients (I had A LOT of it left).  Felt they were sweet enough without the glaze so I opted not to make that...but I will next time.  Only major change was to replace the butter (in the muffin portion) with applesauce.  These were good - thanks much!

These are a definite hit and easy.  I substituted yogurt for the sour cream and they turned out perfect.  Also we put extra lemon zest in our batch. Yummy!

LOVE LOVE LOVED this one.  I am a lemon freak and these muffins really hit the spot.  Like other reviewers I had a ton of crumbly mix left over...should have paid attention to the reviews before I baked.  Oh well!  I still really liked them!

Can I just say OMG! This morning I was looking to bake muffins (its a cold rainy day in Southern California) and wanted to use the lemons from my tree outside. I followed the recipe almost exactly...except that I was out of butter (go figure) so instead I used butter flavored Crisco sticks and as suggested by another reviewer, I doubled the lemon juice to 6 TBS since I have so many lemons. The muffins came out so moist and delish! Not too sweet or tart..perfect. The glaze was a nice touch on the topping. Hubby loved them and ate 2!

This was pretty good but not great.  I thought they came out very dense and didn't rise much.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the streusel topping made WAY too much, and also I really didn't think it was a normal streusel--it was very floury and not sweet enough.  I made half with the streusel and half with just sugar on top, and the streusel really didn't add anything.

Finally, the quantity seems to be off--I cut the recipe in half and still got 23 muffins in normal-sized tins.

These weren't bad but they weren't as great as the reviews make it seem.  I followed the recipe exactly and even added a little lemon extract in addition to the juice and peel and they just weren't lemony enough.  The glaze is extremely lemony, which is what I wanted, but when I glazed the muffins it rolled off because of the crumb topping.  Perhaps I used too much topping?  The parts that weren't covered in the topping did absorb the glaze but, because the majority was covered by the topping, it just didn't have enough.  Overall it was a decent muffin but I think I'll keep looking for something that will give me that fresh lemon taste.  Thanks though.

This is a great recipe! It's so hard to find a lemon recipe that actually has that "lemony-zing" that true lemon lovers love.  I made these as a treat for my boyfriend for being so helpful.  He loved them.  With or without glaze, they are excellent especially with a pat of butter warm from the oven.  I agree with other reviewers, too much topping results from the given recipe; half it.

These muffins were delicious. I wanted something lemony and these were perfect. Instead of sour cream, I used vanilla yogurt, I had to use yogurt butter as well, because I'm lactose intolerant. I halved the recipe but there was a still a lot of topping left, I didn't particularly like the glaze it was more like lemony syrup and the topping wasn't that great either. Next time I'll just leave the topping and glaze off.

Fresh out of the oven just moments ago.  The smell is wonderful . . . like lemon meringue pie.  After reading the reviews, I halved the recipe for the crumb topping and used jumbo muffin tins (yield 18).  Most of the glaze ran off the tops.  I even went over them a 2nd time.  Next time, I will 
make them without the crumbs and just top with the glaze.  Definitely worth a repeat!

This recipe was very good!  i did make some changes of my own.  I added lemon curd into the batter which made it nice and lemony.  I got 36 muffins out of the recipe and used all of the topping. I gave each muffin a good amount of the topping and it made the muffins have a wonderful crunch.  I added grated lemon zest into the glaze another way to give it nice lemon flavor.  Everyone loved them and I would definitely make these again.  I did not find them dense at all.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe as directed, using large muffin tins filled halfway.  It made 24 muffins and the topping amount was perfect.  Great flavor using fresh lemon juice and fresh lemon peel.

These were amazing! I didn't have excess crumb topping but I did add a lot to each muffin. They were very delicious. The only thing was that I halved the recipe to get 12 muffins and made 18 big muffins. Oh well, more for me to eat!

I thought these were a bit dense and heavy for a muffin.  I think I prefer the lemon poppyseed variety instead...Definitely only make a 1/2 of the topping or even less. It makes so much!

I did like this muffin. I made it and, following peoples' reviews, doubled the lemon. I cut the recipe in half, simply because I was lacking the amount of butter called for.  Because I was without a pastry cutter I attempted to use knives to cut in the butter for the crumbs but was unsuccessful so I went without. The muffins came out great, very moist and sweet, but the glaze that I made was too runny and WAY too sweet and tart. My brother liked the muffins; not the glaze. I took paper towels and tapped each of them. This resulted in just enough sweetness. Over all, I hope you read all the reviews before attempting this recipe and tweek it to your preferences. This is a good muffin, not my favorite. I may not make this again, but you never know.

I thought these muffins were delicious... I cut the recipe in half and used the smaller muffin pan because i just cant eat that many muffins. I also added a 15oz can of mandarin oranges which gave it an extra light and fruity flavor! Thanks for the recipe :o)

These muffins are extremely dense. The "glaze" isn't a glaze at all; the ratio is off and you end up with a thick, sweet lemon juice. The recipe does make a ton of muffins, but no one in my house would eat them.

Firstly I don't understand why they don't use baking powder. I halved the recipe, tried to make 12 and ended up with muffin mix all over my oven, since it was too much mixture. It is hard to feel good about a recipe when there is a huge clean up!

Moist & lovely!  In lieu of the streusel and glaze, I tripled the amount of lemon zest, which turned out to be a good amount.    Halving the recipe made enough batter for 12 regular-size muffins and 12 baby ones.  Without the streusel, these muffins do not brown up at all!  The finished muffins look very pale & uniform in color.

Wow! These are amazing! I made them for my mom on Mothers Day - she loved them, as did the rest of the family, even those who don't like lemon! For me, the batter made 18 muffins, and a loaf of bread. The loaf DID NOT turn out well, it was going in the middle, but really brown on the outside, so I would do all muffins. I halfed the crumb recipe, and had the perfect amount. Will use this one often!

I halved this recipe to make 8 texas-sized muffins, and halved again the topping per other reviewers advice. I also added poppyseeds and a dollop of lemon curd in the middle of the muffins, which made them moister inside. They were very yummy. My husband even said, "you're amazing" as he saw me sprinkling struedel on top. He was impressed before he even tasted them! I had a reheated one this morning, two days after baking, and it was still very yummy. I'll definitely make these again.

These were ok.  They are definitely dense, I was looking for a more lemony taste.  I made these as mini muffins, baked them for about 15 mins, made a lot of mini muffins!  I cut the topping in half and had a little left over.  The topping does make a lot!  The glaze seemed to roll right off the muffins.  The next day I made a lemon glaze and colored it with red and green food coloring, drizzled this over the cookies, they look real nice on my Christmas cookie trays.

They were so thick and dense i hated it. they were so heavy too. i think there was way too much butter or something. it's not what i expected from a muffin. i expected fluffy-goodness. but no, the only thing i liked was the glaze because it made the top slightly crunchy.

These muffins were great! I did halve the recipe and it made 48 mini-muffins. I do agree with some of the other reviews, I quartered the topping and still had plenty left.
Also the muffins stayed moist and soft even after a couple of days, they didn't get hard.

These are very good - though I did make a mistake - I added the 1/3 C of lemon juice to the batter. This actually worked out really well and they had a great lemon flavor!

I agree with the other reviewers - you can cut the topping recipe in half and still have PLENTY.  They don't necessarily need the glaze, but it does add a nice bit of sweetness and tartness.

Very moist and great taste! Although I cut down the crumble topping and the glaze was to sour for us. But this is wonderfull even without the glaze! This is one of our favourite muffins at home. My kids loved them and my husband also. Thank you for this great recipe.

Greetings from Europe

This was one of the best lemon cupcakes I have tried!  I accidentally used regular sugar instead of powdered sugar, but it still came out delicious.  So, if you're out of powdered sugar, it's ok to use regular sugar.  Just make sure you keep stirring it between glazing cupcakes.  And it's also delicious without any glaze at all, if you want a subtle lemon taste.

I made these for my husband who LOVED them. I don’t like muffins because they are to dry for me.  There is nothing dry about theses muffins…they are so so moist. I actually had to send these muffins to work with my husband so that they were not tempting me! Excellent muffins!!!  Thank you for changing my mind on the whole muffin thing.

I made 32 large muffins out of this recipe. The crumbly topping, which in my opinion needs more butter to crumble that amount of flour/sugar mixture, could probably top 100 muffins. The dough was very thick but I was surprised how nice they raised in the oven. I won't be making these too often considering the amount of fat used, but it's a great way to use sour cream for someone who loves lemon.

This made way too many muffins.  The topping was excellent though.  The glaze almost made them soggy.

I loved this recipe. I do wish I had read the other reviews first though because I had way too much of the topping. I only made half of the recipe and it made 48 mini muffins. Overall a fantastic muffin recipe and my brothers loved them. I will make these again.

These muffins were easy to make.  They were very good and lemony.  I thought they were sweet enough, that they didn't need the glaze, so I left it off. My kids loved them!  Thanks

Served this with salmon for our holiday dinner.  Delicious and a nice alternative to rolls or biscuits.
