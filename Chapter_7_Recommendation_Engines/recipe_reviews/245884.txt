We really enjoyed this salad! One recommendation I would make is to NOT add the beets to the bowl with the beans and dressing (they make the beans turn pink, and it doesn't look as appetizing). Instead, just toss the beans with the dressing, place the beets on top of the arugula, and then pour the beans and dressing over, then top with the blue cheese and walnuts. Beautiful!

I really enjoyed this salad a lot!  I did use a spring mix salad rather than arugula alone.  I think next time I might up the blue cheese a bit and use candied pecans rather than walnuts, but that's just personal preference.  I will DEFINITELY not mix the beans, dressing, and beets next time- it turns all of it a funky pink color.  Instead I'll just use the beans and beets separately on the salad and drizzle the whole thing with the dressing.  All in all a great recipe!

I have not had beets since I was a child and wasn't the biggest fan, but, I thought I would give this salad a try.  I am so glad I did!  I am now a beet fan!  This salad had so many great flavors from the creamy beans, sweet beets, crunchy walnuts, & tangy blue cheese.   The dressing and peppery arugula balanced this salad out perfectly.   Love this and will definitely be making again!

8.1.16   Only thing I did differently was use a can of sliced beets (what I had on hand), not whole beets.  The dressing is the perfect partner to the beets and beans.  This was delicious as a luncheon salad, but would be a terrific side salad to just about any meal. This is quick-and-easy, wouldn't change a thing,  and a definite keeper!

This salad is very good. I toasted the walnuts for a bit of extra flavor. Although I am no fan of beets, I must say it tastes good. My only change was forgoing the sugar and using half the amount of olive oil. Excellent!

This is a surprisingly good combination. I made it substituting feta cheese and skipping the arugula because I have a problem eating salads of greens. It was still very good and I will make it often.

I used feta cheese and no walnuts. I would have like one more items to replace them with, but couldn't thin k of a good one.

The recipe as is was OK... just. Being from cans, the beans were too gloopy and the beets were flavorless. The dressing is very good, but we only used half, since it would have drowned with all of it. The arugula we used was a bit too mature and quite bitter, which actually suited it.

But the recipe shows promise. I'm definitely going to make it again, next time with fresh ingredients.

Oh, my goodness, I would give this salad 10 stars if I could.  After making the dressing and tasting it, I wasn't sure if I would decrease the vinegar the next time around, but after the first bite of the dressed salad , I had no doubts that the composition of this salad is perfect just as it is.   My only change was to use fresh beets - don't like canned. And thank you Kim's Cooking Now for your suggestion to add the beets separately  in order to avoid pink beans.   :-)

This is deliciously simple and I'm looking forward to utilizing this for workweek lunches when I haven't planned ahead/have no leftovers. I made a few tweaks, per personal preference:  I swapped the vinegar/EVOO amounts to lighten it up and give it a bit more bite, I used sliced can beets since I had them on hand, and I subbed toasted almond slices for the walnuts. I did choose to keep all ingredients separate until serving to prevent sogginess. Thanks for such an easy nutrient dense recipe!
