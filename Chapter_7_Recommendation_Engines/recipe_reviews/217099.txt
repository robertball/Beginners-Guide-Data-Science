Just received this from someone else with the exception that it was made in a slow cooker/crock pot. Very Yummy.

This was soooo good!! It was super easy and convenient. Hardly any prep time, pop it in the oven and forget it until it's done. Came out very juicy and tender!

I made this in the slow cooker and didn't bother with the browning step. Came out moist and tender and with lots of delicious gravy which I served over mashed potatoes. Super easy.

I liked the flavor on this smothered chicken dish. I used boneless skinless breasts. It was great with mashed potatoes. DH liked it fine too but would have rather I stopped at the fried chicken part and made a cream gravy instead and not smothered it at all. I would eat this again but seeing as my DH prefers plain fried chicken and it is already that before the additional ingredients I probably won't fix this again. It was good though :)
