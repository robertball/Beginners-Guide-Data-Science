I had such high hopes for this recipe.  We love onions and this sounded like it would be delicious with our Thanksgiving meal.  However, as I was preparing it according to directions, I found it to be bland.  So I added some white pepper and fresh ground nutmeg.  Still boring.  So 2 pinches of salt, and a little more pepper and nutmeg.  I thought it might be ok with the rest of the meal, but when I tasted it during dinner it was very disappointing.  I will either have to reconstruct this recipe so much that it will become a totally different dish or just give up and find a decent alternative for our next holiday meal.
