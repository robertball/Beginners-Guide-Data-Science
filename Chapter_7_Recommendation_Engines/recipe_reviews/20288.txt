Great little late night snack that you don't have to feel too guilty about especially if you use reduced fat ice cream and light whipped topping.  I skipped the blender step and just layered everything. Smooth, creamy, and delicious!

I presented this delectable dessert in a large wine glass. On top I stood one blackberry, one raspberry, one strawberry (which I sliced and spread -- french style), and two mint leaves... The guests loved it!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved them!  I used real whipped cream and frozen strawberries and it was delicious.  Very easy to prepare too.

I thought it would be a shame to blend all those beautiful berries, so I simply layered them with the whipped topping.  This may not be the fanciest, tastiest, or most memorable dessert, but since I had berries and a little Cool-Whip leftover, this recipe made adorable and appropriate red,  white and blue Memorial Day mini parfaits.

simple and delicious. I get many requests for this recipe. I make my own whipped cream and use frozen fruit in the off season. Highly recommend.

A nice summery dessert, id use a little less cream/berry mixture next time.  Not a huge Cool Whip fan, perhaps next time Id try real cream.  Some crumbled pound cake might be a nice small layer as well.  I used Dreamery Vanilla ice cream and fresh berries.

Yum! I only had huckleberries and blackberries, and after mixing it with the whipped cream I decided to mix ice cream in the blender with the berry mixture. The best shake I've ever made!

Great little dessert! I couldn't find the top/lid for the blender, so I just assembled the parfait and skipped the blending steps. The hungry teen devoured this in a couple of bites. Quick, easy, and tasty, Thanks!

We only used blueberries and raspberries. We mixed with the whip cream, didn't feel like using the mixer and having more cleanup. We also added cherry vanilla granola and a dollop of whip cream on top. The picture is the parfait my 9 year old designed. Need I say more? Easy and delicious!

How can you go wrong with berries and frozen yogurt?  This is the perfect lowfat treat on a warm day.

Good simple dessert that makes good use of fresh summer berries.  I didn't have frozen yougart so used ice cream instead.
