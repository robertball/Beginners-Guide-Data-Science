You can't go wrong with this!  It's July here in Texas and about 500 degrees.  Talk about a perfect summer sandwich!  I made it exactly like the recipe but added a few basil leaves from my garden.  Excellent.  Oh!  Toasted the bread to so that the bread won't get too soggy...

This quick and easy sandwich is a perfect lunch. I used balsamic & basil vinaigrette on lightly toasted San Francisco style extra sourdough bread.
