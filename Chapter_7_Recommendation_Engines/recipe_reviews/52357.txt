Great way to use up your zucchini! I doubled the recipe, threw in a couple extra sausages, cup back a little on the water and used crushed peppers in mine for a little kick. The potatoes took a little longer to cook then stated, but smelled, looked and tasted great. I had to thank my husband for finding this one!1

I thought this was great!  I use 3 hot italian sausages, 2 medium zucchini and add a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper.  Don't forget the crusty french bread for dipping and a little parmesan to top off the hot stew!

I absolutely love this recipe and make it several time during the summer.  Using hot italian sausage definitely adds some kick, and instead of using water, add a can of chicken broth or tomato sauce for extra flavor.

I actually forgot to add the water and we still loved it!  The potatoes were slightly undercooked (probably due to no water) so I'll add just a little next time... but only a few oz. because we liked it chunky and flavorful.

Lots of great veggies - broth was a little bit bland, and needed quite a bit of salt, but otherwise it was a great soup to use with fresh veggies (I also used fresh green beans rather than canned).

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Great use of the garden veggies. May freeze some and save it for winter. Used Hot Italian Sausage for a little kick. Also made in crockpot.

I added a little bit of taco seasoning and a handful of tortellini, and it made it even tastier!

Pretty good, but I would have liked a stew that tasted more like zucchini. I think there were too many other ingredients that overpowered it. That said, the stew tastes better with a little bit of cheese sprinkled on top.

Good recipe and very quick and easy to prepare.  The soup had much more flavor than I imagined it would without the help of chicken broth.  I did not add any extra salt, since the canned tomatoes already had  a lot of sodium in it.  For protein, I used two vegetarian breakfast sausage links and two slices of sun-dried tomato ham.  I also added some chili flakes and thyme.  Even though I didn't include potato, green pepper, parsley, basil, and green beans, as the recipe suggests, the soup was very robust!

I posted a photo.  I took the photo just before the simmer so you could see the beautiful color!  This dish used a lot of my organic vegetables.  I used fresh tomatoes and pureed them, fresh green beans (added at same time as zucchini) , white pepper instead of crushed red pepper, and I didn't have green peppers, so I substituted roasted red peppers from a jar.  Yum, tasty dish.  Um, but 15 min. prep?  Not unless you are the Ginsu chef... Lotsa chopping.  Easy to make, though.  Good prep directions.

I did make some changes to this - more sausage, more potato, more zucchini, chicken broth instead of just water and some tomato paste.  I was trying for a stovetop version of a similar recipe I made in the crockpot.  I thought this cooked too long as the vegetables were pretty much mush by the time I ate it.  I probably won't make it again - I'll probably go back to my crock pot recipe.

This was delicious!  I used turkey kielbasa sausage but otherwise made as written and it was a huge hit.  I loved how easy it was, and the variety of veggies.  Very nice!

I made this in my new Ditch Oven on the stovetop, and it was DELICIOUS! My wife really enjoyed it!
