Easy to make, let cook all afternoon. Even my 3 year old son loved it (added extra sour cream to his to cool it off a bit). Didn't add the blue cheese to the pot, but kept it on the side for those who wanted some. Can't wait to have some at the ski lodge this winter!

My whole family asked me to definitely make this soup again and again.  My son, who is big on hot wings, but not a soup person, had several helpings.  I used KEN'S Steak House Marinade & Sauce "Buffalo Wing sauce" instead of the hot pepper sauce. Really good chicken wing flavor soup!!

Very easy and it makes a huge quantity.I omitted the carrots and potatoes after my first try. In a pinch using rotisserie chickens from the grocery store makes it not only delicious but even faster to make. This is a new family favorite!

Excellent soup! Here is what I did different, no half & half and less cream of chicken soup, turned out fabulous! I sliced celery, carrot, onion, garlic, and potato in the food processor, then sautéed veggies in butter. I used one can of cream of chicken soup with five additional cans of water. I then poured two cups of leftover Frank's Red Hot chicken wing sauce and added four chicken bouillon cubes into the crockpot. Lastly, I added one large raw chicken breast, spices, and the sautéed veggie mix to the crockpot and cooked it on high for a total of four hours. The chicken breast was cooked within two hours and I pulled it out and shredded the meat with a fork and then placed it back into the crockpot. I served the soup with a dollop of sour cream, shredded mozzarella cheese and chives fresh from the garden. Can’t wait to make this soup again during the cold winter months, best soup I’ve made this year!

I took this to a soup social and everyone LOVED it! It was one of the first ones to go! I did add an envelope of ranch to the pot just to add a little more flavor. Thank you so much! I will make this over and over!

This soup was great!  I live in buffalo and have tried many chicken wing soups at restaurants and this soup could compete with any of them.  I will definitely be making this soup again

I tossed everything in the crock pot Super Bowl Sunday am (super easy; especially since I used rotisserie chicken, per a previous reviewer, for the meat), sans celery because I hate celery. I also couldn't resist adding some minced garlic and a little shaker parm, as our very wings are garlic parm.  It cooked on low all day while we were out and we arrived home to the smell of wings.  While we both enjoyed it, we also agreed it wasn't something we'd really want/make again, hence the 4 stars.  If you're a fan of wings, it's def worth givinig a try.  Mr. LTH can be a big sissy when it comes to hot and he had no issues w/this.  (Photo to follow as soon as I can get it to upload...)

I used fat free half and half and low fat cream of chicken soup, I also added more hot sauce(we like it spicy!). I spinkled the blue cheese on each individual bowl instead of mixing it in (everyone likes different amounts)....Loved it! Will be making it again!

This recipe was pretty good! I did a couple things differently. My husband is mildly lactose intolerant, as am I, so instead of 6 cups of half and half, I did 4. I also did 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken, and added in 2.5 cups of chicken broth. I omitted the celery, and rather than pre-cooking and shredding the chicken I put in 3 breasts frozen and cooked on low for about 8 hours. In the morning, the chicken fell apart with tongs and was cooked through. The extra water from the uncooked chicken diluted the spice a bit (I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce), so I added some to my husband's lunch. It was the perfect amount of spice for me (I'm a wuss). I also omitted the clue cheese, and used cheddar because that's what we had, and just used it as a garnish on each dish. DELIC!

I made this exactly the way it is written and I found it too thick more like a dip than a soup. I omitted the half and half and used broth made from boiling a rotisserie chicken carcass in water instead. I used one can of cream of chicken soup, a pack of ranch dressing seasoning, and about a cup and a half of franks hot wing sauce. I added the chicken, potatoes, celery, carrots, and onion and cooked on low all day. Delicious!!!!

This is my second time looking up this recipe. My hubby and I absolutely love it. The only things we don't follow to a tee is adding another potato and making chunks of chicken instead of shredded only because we like heartier soups. I also add 1/2 - 1 cup of actual wing sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's is my fave) to give it an extra kick. Super delicious!

Maybe I didn't put enough cream in but it seemed a bit more like a thin dip than a soup. It tasted pretty good though so I can't complain too much.

I made this last night in the crockpot. It was absolutely delicious! If you are a fan of buffalo chicken ~ you'll get your fix off this soup. I followed the directions exactly, except I added a bit more veggies to give it more bulk and it came out just fine. I defrosted my chicken first and cooked it for about 5h 45min and it came out just great! I also used fat free creamer and fat free sour cream and it was excellent!

I did make this recently. It's not a bad soup, nor is a really good soup. Sorry, but I live near Buffalo, NY and I've had plenty of excellent chicken wings. Some of those wings were from the original Anchor Bar where Frank and Theresa invented these tasty treats. Wings are wings and just don't turn into soup so well. I'm glad others are enjoying this soup so much.

I am from Buffalo.   Leave out the potatoes!!!!  They are unnecessary and have nothing to do with this soup.  Cuts down on time and unnecessary carbs/calories. This soup is thick enough and filling without.  Also, you can use light sour cream and blue cheese, or use a packet of dry Ranch Dressing mix if you prefer.  Tastes even better the next day (if there is any left...)

This is such an easy recipe! ! I did follow one of the reviews and used Kens buffalo wing marinade instead and let it cook all day and it is amazing. This recipe does make a lot of soup however :) we served ours in bread bowls! !

I made this today, and although I enjoyed it, I did feel as though it was lacking just a touch in flavour.  When preparing the soup, I added about 30% more hot sauce than the recipe called for, and even then, I found it needed more post cooking.  In addition to the carrots, celery and potatoes, I added onions.  The recipe is right to say that the dish needs to be stired throughout the cooking time; I didn't stir mine throughout and came home to some veggies which were cooked just fine and some which were a bit undercooked.  But that's not the recipe's fault!  All in all a good dish, albeit not your healthiest option!

We love this recipe.  We eat it all the time.  I leave out the Bleu cheese and top with ranch dressing when it is served.  I buy day old rotisserie chickens at the grocery store for fast and easy shredded chicken.

Delicious! Like buffalo chicken dip in soup form. I did make a few modifications due to preference. I put 4 whole boneless/skinless chicken breasts in crock, so by the end if cooking time (8 hours on low), it was easily shredded. I also left out the potatoes, used 4 cups of half and half, with 2 cups of chicken broth to make a slightly thinner soup. I also used a mild wing sauce so my son could eat it, therefore I ended up doubling that to about 2 cups, or the whole bottle. Finally, per other reviewers, I left the blue cheese crumbles on the side so everyone could take as much or as little as they wanted. Fantastic!!!

I would've loved this soup but mine curdled! I only had 1 can of cream of chicken so I am not sure if that was the reason why we couldn't eat it! I was sad because it tasted pretty good. Might try again

We really liked this soup!  It is out of the ordinary and a wonderful change from our normal soups.  Even people that do not like wings should give this a try.  The only change I made was to omit the potatoes.  Otherwise this recipe is a keeper!

An easy, elegant soup with great depth of flavor.  The flavors are much more complex than you would expect for such a simple recipe.  

I halved the recipe in order to cook this soup in my 4-qt. slow cooker.  I eliminated the potatoes because they wouldn't fit and also left out the celery due to preference.  For the hot sauce, I used "Trappey's" brand.  My husband loved it as much as I did.  This is a soup I will make again and again.

I had to improvise. I did not have enough cream of chicken so I used some cream of mushroom. I also added some chicken stock and since I do not like blue cheese I used A Mexican blend. I also aded two chopped smoked sausages.

I suggest using buffalo wing sauce instead of regular hot or pepper sauce.  It is great.  Very hearty soup.

Awesome recipe using frank's red hot sauce. I Followed the directions exactly. Used 125g of crumbled blue cheese. Makes a large crockpot full, good for super bowl or playoffs.

I've been referring back to the base of this recipe for a few years now.  I can't remember if I ever left a review or not.   So here's a long over due one.  This is my family's most requested soup that I make.  I modified it slightly to fit our needs.   I omit the half & half entirely.  No potato, but I add frozen corn.  One can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  And about a tablespoon or so of Hidden Valley Ranch dry seasoning.  I toss 2 big frozen all white chicken breasts in the crock pot with all of that, plus half of a chopped onion and about a teaspoon or so of minced garlic, and a dash or two of salt and pepper.  After that cooks for a few hours, then I'll tweak it if needed with sour cream or coconut milk.  And for my hubby's sake,  I added the dry ranch dressing mix and omitted the blue cheese.  Garnish with cilantro or green onions.  Yum!

Here is the "shoot I forgot it took 6 hours to cook quick" version! :-) Very good soup! I didn't have time to make it in the crock pot so I made it from scratch in about 45 mins. I didn't use condensed cream of chicken soup or half and half because I didn't have either on hand. I boiled the potatoes, carrots, and celery in 3 cans of chicken broth until cooked. I stirred in 2 cans of chicken. I reduced the heat to medium low. I mixed together 3 cups of milk with 1/2 c flour and poured it in. I added the buffalo sauce at this time also. Cooked until thickened. Removed from heat and stirred in the sour cream. I held off on the blue cheese (we used gorgonzola) because not everyone in my family likes it. I simply topped our soups with it if desired.  Yes, I am one of those people who altered the recipe but when you don't have 6 hours and really want a recipe for supper, sometimes you do what you have to. That's why I wanted to share my take! :-)

I kept putting off making this recipe after I saved it but it kept beckoning me. The ingredients alone spelled out, "Heart attack," but my family loves anything Buffalo Chicken style. So, I made it and had such high hopes. It was VERY rich but that's not surprising when the half and half, sour cream and creamy chicken soup is the base.  It was too thick for our liking and very filling. The flavor was lacking so maybe I should have added more hot sauce than the recipe called for. I will try a different recipe next time. Still surprised to see all the rave reviews.

Mine turned out WAY too spicy with Lousiana hot sauce.  Added some milk and one more can of cream of chicken and it was tolerable but won't make again.

I've made this twice for a soup competition at my office and won 2 years in a row now!   It was a landslide vote!  It's awesome.  Highly recommend!

I adapted this to be gluten free and had to cook it on the stove, don't have a crock pot big enough.  I used Pacific Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup which is gluten free, with the consistency of standard cream soups.  Cooked it on low for about 4hrs. Perfect!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, however I slow cooked it for like 10 hours on low.  the potatoes were not quite done at 6-8 hours.  It was worth the wait!!! Maybe next time cook on High then at the end put on low? I will be making this again!!

If you love buffalo chicken wings you will love this soup. If you they are not your favorite, then you will probably hate this soup. I followed the recipe exactly, and I am pretty indifferent to buffalo chicken wings, and I think this soup tasted JUST like them. My boyfriend hates buffalo chicken wings, so of course, he hated this. This recipe makes enough to feed a small army and I also found that if you refrigerate this it gets super super thick and you can use it as a dip for carrots or celery.

I used 12oz of Franks red Hot sauce and it was not very spicy. The potatoes were still crunchy. All in all really good but I like spicy, so I will use less half and half next time.

I had a different recipe for Buffalo chicken chowder, so I used this recipe, and changed some of the ingredients. It came out amazing!!:

4 cups (1 Qt) Half and Half,
2 cans (10.75 oz) Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup,
1 can (10.75 oz) Condensed Cream of Celery Soup,
1 can (10.75 oz) [Campbells'] Chicken Broth,
1 Cup Yogurt Ranch Dressing (Bolt house),
2 Cups Frank’s Red hot Wing Sauce,
1 clove minced Garlic,
1/2 sweet onion chopped,
1 - 2 tsp crushed red pepper (i like it spicy),
No change to: celery, carrots, chicken & potatoes,


In the last hour, I substituted 1/2 block of cream cheese & Swiss cheese for the Blue Cheese:
 **(I don't like blue cheese),
1/2 block of cream cheese,
1-3 oz of swiss cheese,

Cooked on Low for 8 hours.

This really turned out well. I left out the potato which I don't care for in soups so I increased the amount of carrot and added in diced celery to compensate. I tripled the amount of hot sauce and put the bleu cheese (I used a really good quality Stilton) on the table instead of into the soup to allow for people to choose their own amount. Everyone raved and went back for seconds. If you are a fan of buffalo wings, this soup is a winner!
