Very good recipe!!  We're having this for breakfast more often!  We substituted 1 C. of silken tofu for the plain yogurt and it was delicious.  My husband hates tofu and even he said it was yummy.  I liked the addition of the lemon peel, my husband couldn't even tell it was there though so I don't think it's a necessary ingredient.  So if you don't have it, don't worry about it.  We were able to buy apricot nectar in little juice boxes that are perfect for making this recipe.

I had only canned peaches available, but I drained them well. This could be one of the reasons that this tasted a little bland to me.I feel that if you're looking for a powerful fruit flavor, such as the blast that berries give a smoothie, this one isn't for you. I'm more of a blast of fruit person. This was good. It imparts a lovely flavor of peach, vanilla and apricot.But as with any recipe made from peaches and/or apricots, it is a very subtle flavor. This is a smooth, creamy,semi-thick subtle flavored drink. Peach and apricot fans will really love this one.

My two-year old repeatedly said, 'Yummy' while spooning down this smoothie.

Ah yes, yet another trip to the doctor! My daughter has strep and right now nothing feels good going down her throat except hot drinks or icey cold. As she sat there looking at me with droopey eyes and asking for something to soothe her throat, I raced to my computer to try and find something special. This recipe was just right. I didn't have the nectar on hand so I subbed with O.J., added some raspberries and a little milk. She loved it and it certainly helped!

Since we didn't have nectar on hand, I substituted milk & I used strawberries with the peaches & bananas.  I suggest peeling the banana before you freeze it.  You could soak it in the lemon juice to avoid browning.  We tried it with & without the lemon juice--too sweet for us w/o.

This recipe was delicious.  And I don't like peach that much.  But the blend of fruits and juice turn out to be just the right combination and maked people wonder what is all in the drink.

Delicious! Followed the recipe except we added 14 ozs. of the apricot juice. Great!
