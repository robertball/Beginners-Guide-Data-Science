I made this soup in large quanity (36 servings) for a Church dinner.  It was delicious and everyone had seconds.  Please note that the recipe does not tell you when to put the chicken in the soup.  I put it in after the veges had stewed a while, and before I added the noodles.

Excellent soup and very easy to make.  I substituted vegetable oil with olive oil, and fried the chicken with onion and garlic.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe!  Quick, easy, and I usually have most of the ingredients on hand.  Didn't have mushrooms, so left them out.  My husband thought it need more noodles (I used the dried egg noodles, not frozen). So I just added some more - about double+ what recipe called for, just stirred them in while it was still hot and it was even better the next day.  Great for wintery days like we have here!

This soup was wonderful, couldnt stop eating it!  I put the chicken breasts on the grill instead of the kitchen stove and the flavor was ever better.  This is now my chicken noodle soup recipe.

I added an extra two cups of chicken stock and a packet of rice vermicelli (with the egg noodles).  The flavour was amazing, although I think this would depend on what brand stock you use.

Great recipe! I boiled and shredded the chicken instead of frying it, for a lighter taste. I added the chicken right before the noodles, since the recipe didn't specify when to add it. My family loved this soup!

I used low sodium chicken broth (6 cups + 2 of water) so it was a bit bland until I spiced it up with  additional salt and some cracked red pepper, but very tasty! I grilled the chicken with some garlic and onion powder on each side on a grill pan and added some garlic to the soup. I added 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies just because I like lots in my soups.

I made the mistake of adding 3 cups of noodles. Waaay too much noodle, but I've learned my lesson! I think 1 1/2 might have been a good amount.

I started here.  More broth, noodles and a lot more mushrooms. Couldn't find the peas in the freezer. Personalized by adding a few dashes of poultry seasoning, a pinch or two of tarragon, lots of pepper and a splash of sherry. Suggest leaving chicken in saut√© pan to collect juices, add to pot with chicken, and don't forget to deglaze the pan.

I followed this recipe exact--problem there is not enough broth in this if you want a soup versus a stoup--I actually kept adding broth to this and a last count I had 9 cups total and it was not very brothy. It was good in flavor once I added 1 bay leaf, poultry seasoning, and marjoram.

I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in olive oil and minced garlic, then added cooked frozen mixed vegetables to them. After cooking the chicken, I shredded it and added it to the vegetables. In a crockpot, I heated 6 cups of chicken broth, and added some parsley. I added the chicken/veggie mixture to the crock pot and cooked on low for 6 hours. I cooked 2 cups of  egg noodles separate and added them to the soup for 10 minutes. Voila! It was nice and thick and tasted great with some grilled cheese on the side!

This soup was good.  I used a frozen pea, corn, carrot, and green bean medley.  I also substituted the egg noodles for whole wheat.  I will definitely make this again.

This was such an easy soup to make. I had half of a rotisserie chicken left over from last night, so I used that instead of the grilled chicken breasts. It tasted great, but I look forward to trying out some chicken off of the grill in this recipe. Yum!

My husband usually spends all day making chicken soup, I had this ready in a little over an hour and it was amazing! I made it according to the recipe, minus the mushrooms, but could see the future possibilites as well. This will be a new staple in our house.

I have used this recipe twice, and both times it has produced outstanding soup! I used 6 cups of chicken broth, and might actually use 7-8 cups next time. I also use more peas (about 1/2 cup) and skip the mushrooms altogether. Very easy to make, also suggest making egg noddles from scratch--tried that for the first time tonight and it added wonderful flavor and texture to the soup.

This was fabulous!! We made it as one of our homeschool projects and it turned out great, my son discovered he likes muchrooms.He followed this recipe so it is simple enough for a tweenager to prepare. We used a few leftover drums from BBQ few nights prior gave it a nice grilled flavor. this will be a regular lunch preperation. Did use 6 cups liguid (water and bouillion cubes) for 6 servings

Perfect blend of vegetables, chicken and noodles. Easy and quick, I used home made broth but it would be fine with store bought.

I made this for my boyfriend.  I used carrot "chips" from the produce department to save time and added garlic salt and seasoned pepper.  I also used "No Yolks" egg noodles to reduce cholesterol. Lastly, I sauteed the chicken in olive oil.  It was fabulous!  It is definitely a new addition to recipes I cook often!

A delicious and hearty soup. It makes more servings than you expect. I added garlic to my chicken when sauteeing it to bring out more flavor. I don't sautee or boil chicken on its own because i feel it leaves a certain smell in the chicken. I used garlic paste but even finely crushed garlic would be fine too. A wonderful soup!

I added salt, pepper and parsley, and two cups more water, and cut the chicken breats into very small pieces. Also, used Knorr's chicken granules instead of chicken broth, and substituted water for the fluid. Next time I will use only two chicken breasts. Used okra instead of peas. Doesn't say when to add the chicken, but as it is already cooked it really doesn't matter. Otherwise, it is a good basic chicken noodle soup, if modified.

The soup isn't bad, but what's with the name?  Why is it called "grilled" when the chicken is fried in a pan?

This is a really easy basic recipe.  I've made this a couple of times and found that I like to leave the chicken whole and then cut/shred it after it has boiled with the rest of the soup before adding the noodles.  I don't care for mushrooms, so I don't add those and instead add whatever frozen veggies I have left in the freezer.

This soup was really good, but like the other reviewer, I also added a little more broth.

This recipe was so good that I would double it next time for leftovers.  It was a hit with my kids!  I made it with free range chicken and it was super!

This recipe makes really good soup... but am I missing something that no one else seems to have noticed?  Where's the GRILLED part of the recipe?  The chicken is FRIED, not grilled, so even though the soup is good, I took a star off because the name is misleading...

Colds were going around and the temperatures were dropping and this soup really "hit the spot".....    it was so easy to make and the taste surprised me.  I was expecting rather bland but that was not the case.  I added an extra cup of broth because of comments that I read and only did 2 chicken breasts (omitted the mushrooms, not my husbands favorite) and added some fresh parsley at the end just because I had some.  Everything else as written.  When I make it again I think I will keep it at 4 cups of broth and only use 1 chicken breast because there just seemed to be too much meat  in comparison to the veggies etc.  Loved it's simplicity.....

I used store-bought, shredded rotisserie chicken, simmered in some broth (made fm better than bullion) and season salt, then right before serving, add the (frozen) vegetables and noodles.
