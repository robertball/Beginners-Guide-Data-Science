I make this all the time, with one KEY difference. I roast the garlic first.  It's easy..  just cut the tops off of five or six bulbs of garlic, wrap in foil, and bake in the oven for 45 minutes or so until they're mushy.  Then squeeze out all the garlicky goodness and mix with salt if desired.  It's amazingly good, and the garlic isn't hot after being roasted.  I wonder if this part was missing from the recipe?  I can't imagine eating 3 cups of raw garlic.  Yikes!  Anyway, try it that way and it might be much tastier.  :-)

I agree with another reviewer, roasting the garlic makes it mellow. I could not imagine eating this raw. This is way too much salt and way too much oil. Cut back the salt to taste or perhaps a teaspoon, drizzle the oil over the cloves just enough so that the blender does not stall. I also use the small baby food blender cups, and make this in batches so the salt and oil is very limited; sometimes I add a tablespoon of lemon juice to the mix rather than more oil. I have been roasting garlic for about 10 years now and love it. I use it on baked potatoes, hot pasta, mixed with a little butter to make garlic toast or brushed on brushetta before adding the topping. It is wonderful on sandwiches in place of butter or mayo. I have been known to add 1/2 a teaspoon of red chili flakes before pureeing the cloves. Please, try roasting it first, you will really like it and it's versatility!

Try doing 2/3 roasted garlic, 1/3 raw garlic.  The combination of the roasted and raw enhances both.

All I have to say is "WOW!"  I love it! and it's so easy to make.  Of course, my children wouldn't come near me for the rest of the day, but it was worth it:)

I did not enjoy this! Way too salty and so hot I almost burned the inside of my mouth.  I was disappointed.  I am accustomed to Lebanese puree that is white, light and fluffy with strong garlic, but definately not THAT strong.  This was yellow, soupy, salty and beyond hot.

I was hoping this was like the branded Lebanese Breeze whipped garlic... maybe I did something wrong but it was WAY too hot.  This is coming from a family of serious garlic lovers.  I will still use everything in recipes - it certainly will not go to waste, but WOW!

This was aweful!  I wasted 9 heads of perfectly roasted garlic!  It was SO salty I think I felt my blood pressure rise!  I only put in half the amount of salt.  Did I miss something?  If you roast it, do you put no salt in?  I think I might try this again but with no salt.  Then again, I think I have better things to do with that much garlic!

I can hardly begin to describe this. The salt was overwhelming and the garlic nearly burned a layer of skin off my mouth - and I do love garlic! There certainly seems to be something wrong with these proportions. We looked at other recipes and noticed the addition of lemon juice and roasting the garlic to decrease the harshness. I've since researched several other recipes that look more promising. Hope to find a good recipe for this yet!

OH wow, this little recipe is so up my alley!! My grandmother used to make this for me all the time when I was little, except she used butter instead of the evoo. I skipped the salt entirely and loved it just the same. Thank you!!

I make this in the blender. Peel the garlic (I use 1 head), add to blender. Pour in 1/2 of the lemon juice. Nearly liquify the garlic. Slowly add 1/2 the oil (I use 1/2 cup since I think I make a double batch). Add the rest of the lemon. Blend for a minute or so. Then add the rest of the oil slowly. Now, I do have a twist on this since I like to consume massive quantities and it is uber high in calories. I add plain greek yogurt (about 1 cup). Thickens it up and makes it last longer.

I was so excited to try this recipe last night.  I had the garlic spread at a Lebanese restaurant over a year ago. How disappointing to find it so salty...and I only used a third of the salt!  The proportions on this recipe are very wrong.  I looked online for a Lebanese recipe and will try that in comparison.

Came out SO bitter and was much too intense for anyone to consume by itself.  Very disappointed.  Will try again with roasted garlic...

I had this at a restaurant last night and was instantly in love.  I was happy to find this recipe on line.  But completely disappointed with the finished product.

I cut the recipe by a third and still ended up with plenty. I couldn't imagine using up a whole 3 cups worth! The key is to only use a little bit at a time. My sister says it tastes just like the one we get at our local Lebanese restaurant.
