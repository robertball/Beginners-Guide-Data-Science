Cinnamon butter is great! I work in the food business and whenever I make this all the customers ask how I make it. I use a 1 pound tub of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and put in large bowl, then mix in 1/4-1/3 cup white sugar and 2 T cinnamon. Mix well and you can put it back in the same tub for storing. You can adjust flavors to your liking. You can also try adding a bit of extracts like van. or maple. Maybe even try it with brown sugar. Experiment with it. It is good on breads but also great on squash and carrots too!

We had this spread on Herman Pancakes this morning. To say that we loved it would be an understatement. There's plenty leftover so I plan on making french toast tomorrow and spreading it on that, too.

Good, but a little too sweet and not enough cinnamon for us.  It is a nice change from regular butter though.  Next time I make I would double the amount of spice used.

We used this on baked sweet potatoes.  After baking the sweet potatoes, I sliced them open, added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, and then topped it with cinnabutter.  Mmmmmm....wonderful.

Very good! I personally like "Cinnamon Honey Butter" = a recipe also found on this site a little better b/c I love the honey taste in it but this one is still very good. It went great on our toast and I made pancakes the other morning and spread a little on them too, and then a little syrup...it tasted like cinnamon pancakes. Very good stuff Sara!

Mmmmmmmmm! I don't usually put butter on my pancakes, but this was absolutely delicious! Very light and creamy AND i used margarine (diet becel) instead of butter! Will definitely make it again every time i make "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" (also yummy, from this site). Thanks Sara

Another 5-star one.  This is very simple, but Sara got it right.  Creamy and great just like the expensive stuff you could buy in a store!  I used margarine because I find getting butter evenly soft is tricky, and it worked great (plus was a bit more healthy).  Went well with Mom's Applesauce Pancakes, also from this site.

My family went nuts for this recipe. Now I keep a batch in the refrigerator all the time - it's great on bagels, toast, biscuits, and baked sweet potatoes.

Loved it!!  My 5 yr old daughter loves making her own cinnamon toast.  This is much easier for her now.  The only thing I did different, was increase the cinnamon and sugar.  I put it in a little container in the fridge and pull it out anytime we want it. Thanks for the great idea!!

Delicious!!  Used this on Apple Breakfast Bread from this site.  Couldn't ask for an easier, tasty addition to warm bread.  Going to try this on pancakes or french toast.  Thank you so much for posting.

I cut it down to 4 servings. I did use a little more cinnamon/nutmeg (actually, a homemade pumpkin pie spice blend) and more powdered sugar. I like the idea of using a little vanilla, and will try that next time. Great spread on "Mom's Applesauce Pancakes".

I seen this on the reviews and decided to try it. I used the calculate button to scale it way back to test it. I didn't think this had much flavor. It kind of just tasted like butter with a little bit of cinnamon. Mine was not dark at all like the picture. I don't know how that reviewer got theirs that dark in color? Its not bad, it just doesn't taste like much, not even sweet. I guess it would be better than putting plain butter on pancakes, french toast, etc. though.

This is like the butter they give you with bread at the Texas Roadhouse.  Very good.  My first time making it I over heated the butter and it seperated, leaving the consitancy less than desirable, going forward i will use a spreadable butter that doesnt have to be heated at all. Everyone loved this.

OMG....My mother used to buy something like this about 50 years ago!  It came in a yellow and blue sort of waxy container and it had a bumblebee on it.  I just loved it on toast.  I have looked for it off and on over the years and could never find it.  Thanks to you, I can now make my own anytime I want.  The taste of this brings back so many wonderful memories!  I think I will try making it with honey instead of the conf sugar.

Great!! How easy can you get! I took the suggestion of adding a tad of vanilla & it was wonderful. Could be used for many different flavored breads, pancakes, bagels. I'd make again.

I doubled the sugar and spices in this recipe. I used "I can't believe it's not butter" so I could just keep it in the fridge. It's great on toast!

Wonderful!  Try it on banana nut bread.  This is becoming a staple in my fridge! Wish that I had thought of this when my kids were younger - although they love it now! We do experiment with this and sometimes have 2 or more variations (vanilla, maple, etc) going and all of them are really good. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great, easy recipe!  I thought a cup of butter was too much (there's just 2 of us ;-) so I scaled it down.

Used it on pancakes, and will run out today to buy bread to make cinnimon toast.

yummy!

I used much less powdered sugar, approx. 2-3 tsp? This was absolutely divine! Especially on cinnamon raisin bagels... Mm!! Spices up boring toast, tastes great on bagels, mmm, great as gifts as well. Thank you!

We thought this was a little bland. I had to doctor it up by putting regular sugar in it, and a splash of vanilla. I might try the "cinnamon honey butter" that someone else had mentioned was on this sight. Sorry!

This is dangerous stuff!  So, so easy and so, so, so delicious.  It is great on everything.  It's horrible for the waistline because of all the bread that you'll be eating just so that you can have more of this stuff!

This recipe is great! I use it on waffles, pancakes, and toast. After a little while I just threw the stuff in and it's made in a second and it still tast good. I recommend it on toast!

I made this with FF butter and added some extra confectioners sugar for more taste and it turned out great!  DH is a very picky eater and loved this butter!  We had it on belgian waffles with whipped cream.

I love flavored butter and this one came out delicious. My boyfriend and I put it on our waffles and it was sweet and cinnamon-y. I have a lot left over in the fridge and when i finish that, I will make some more!

This is good on just plain toast. I added a little vanilla too. I haven't tried on in pancakes yet, but I will be making this more often.

Excellent! I always keep some of this on hand for pancakes, pumpkin bread, dinner rolls, or anything else that needs a sweet buttery touch.

I made this for the holidays and spread it over the Maine Pumpkin Bread recipe, also on this site. It tasted really good and was very easy to make. Jazzes up things a bit for a nice presentation.

This was good, I served it with buttermilk pancakes II.  And tomorrow morning the kids will get it with cinnamon toast. Although it was good I am not sure I will make it again.  I always have cinnamon/sugar on hand and I think it would just be easier to just sprinkle the powder onto the toast and pancakes.  We will see tomorrow
