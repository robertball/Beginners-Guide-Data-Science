These are wonderful, my husband ends up eating his lunch on the commute and goes hungry the rest of the day. The first time I made them exactly to the recipe, this last time I added in some frozen peas and chopped fresh carrot (which I know is frowned on by traditionalists, but I like it), and a bit of sage, and for my tastebuds it was even better. This is definitely going into my regular rotation, seems like there could be endless variation and still a happy outcome. Thank you so much Chef John!

I just made the dough and used the same amount of coconut oil instead of the lard. It turned out amazing, this dough is so good and easy to work with. I filled it with left over curry and it was delicious.

Excellent recipe!  Always wanted to make pasties since my 8th grade science teacher told the class about them.  These make excellent lunches, make them on Sunday then grab one and head to work everyday!

I had leftover filling, sautéed it in a skillet with some butter.  Used a cup of water, chicken bouillon cube (beef would be better!), and boiled the dough scraps to make little dumplings.  Then dumped into the skillet with the filling, made a good little snack while the pasties were baking!

My family loved these; they taste like the real thing, maybe better! They are too big though. Next time I will make them half-size.

Excellent work of yours, John!  . . .to actually include the "Pasty" itself in your recipe!  . . . unlike a few others.
Thanks for sharing.

This recipe gets a 5 all day, honestly I would give more stars if I could. No need to change a thing, but as Chef John says "you are the Miss Nasty of your Cornish pasty" so get creative if you want, I know I have. I've played with the veggies, I've played with the spices, it's always good. I found this recipe years ago on Chef Johns YouTube channel, Food Wishes, if you haven't binged on his awesome videos and recipes you need to. Seriously get to watching and learning!

I made this using a swede (rutabaga) which is the traditional type of turnip for a Cornish Pasty.  I will definitely make this again. My family loved them.

My wife and son both tried making pasties in the past and failed miserably.  Full of apprehension, I tried to replicate this tasty treat from Cornwall, with my reference being the delicious pasties we enjoyed whilst visiting my father in Cornwall. This recipe was a success on the first try and it was also the first pastry I have ever made.  Thank you Chef John!

Excellent flavors! Crust is awesome. Next time, might use a bit less pepper. I'd definitely make it again. A friend had it and asked to take one home. He loved it.

I used only onion and potato and a clove of garlic instead of cayenne pepper but used a good amount of freshly ground black pepper and salt.  I put this with the meat.  
I used bread flour and followed your recipe except I used shortening instead of lard.  I added much more water than the recipe suggests. Its common at this time of year with forced heat but finally I felt it was never going to have enough so I kneaded 2 min and popped it in the fridge. I waited 3 hours debating my desire to add peas.  I did not.  I was concerned my crust was going to be tough it handled differently than pie dough. I did struggle with sealing and crimping 
My oven is a bear I baked 80 minutes .  I went by color, smell and the juices coming out if the vents . 
After the 10 minutes of grueling wait. I cut into the best thing. I've made in awhile .  I will make again .

4 stars not 5, because Cornish pasties use Swede (rutabaga to you Americans) not turnips, although the Cornish call them turnips.  Otherwise this recipe is pretty good. the pastry is excellent, many pasty recipes use a standard shortcrust pastry which is too fragile.

I used it mainly for the pastry recipe which is simple and makes a great pastry. I typically make a very large batch of hearty crockpot stew and use part of my stew to make pies using this pastry. It works out great. Just need to use smaller pieces of meat, potato and carrots in the stew.
Pies are best cold for lunch!

The nutrition data is way off.  The data says this recipe has a little over 10 grams of carbs per serving (1 cornish pasty), but one pasty has on average a cup of bread flour, which ignoring the potatoes... is a 100 grams of carbs.

It was good. I made two batches. The first batch I thought I needed more water because it wasn't coming together like in the video. The extra water was a mistake. The dough was harder to knead and took longer to get smooth. The second batch I didn't add extra water and, although it didn't look like enough, it was a perfect soft dough,which took no time to knead.

I could not be happier. I have tried to make other recipes with disastrous results. We threw them away and got Chinese food. However, these were tasty and wonderful. I was told by my guests that were authentic tasting as well.  Truth be told, the turnip taste is a bit much for me, but that isn’t a fault of the recipe.

These were very tasty, thanks for sharing the recipe.  The only change i made was to use Russet potatoes (I'm in Idaho after all), still turned out amazing in my opinion.  These are perfect for a cold rainy day.

He pastry was perfect, many thanks for explaining how my mother made the pastry for her Cornish pasties. Like others I suggest the swede or rutabaga rather than turnip. But I have to admit the turnip was good. 
I like a little more pepper in mine, and loved the idea of cream if they're too hot ... 
I used organic potato as I got them cheaper than the others so I think it can be classed as a health food !

My grandma made pasties all the time for her family of 12 and the farm hands. To cut down on time of making individual pasties, she made a huge pan of it with a top and bottom crust, adding turnips, parsnips and rutabagas from her garden. I make them according to this recipe, putting a touch of beef broth in the filling.

Great recipe! Tasted a lot like those we had in Cornwall. The crust was great and super easy; a recipe I plan on using in other savory pies.  The video was helpful to watch beforehand to know how to work the dough. We loved everything about the filling. Next time we'll play around with the filling a bit and may try adding carrots and substituting the turnips with diced parsnips.
