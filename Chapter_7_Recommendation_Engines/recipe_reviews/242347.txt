These were just ok. No added garlic and lots of salt and pepper.  They were still bland.  1/2 cup of bread crumbs would not hold my ground beef together.  It took nearly a cup of bread crumbs to keep mine on a ball shape rather than a pancake shape.  Bake time is spot on though.

I made this for a dinner party I was hosting that night. It was super easy and had great results. Everyone at the party loved them! The few changes I made were:
1. Instead of using nutmeg,  I used a combination of garlic powder and oregano. I added a lot more oregano than garlic powder, but that was the effect I was going for.
2. Also, I did not measure out the amount of breadcrumbs, instead, I just used two pieces of bread-worth
3. I didn't have any onions on hand, so I used one shallot instead. I also could not find my grater, so I used a blender. 

All in all, this recipe was quite delicious and I look forward to making it again sometime soon.
