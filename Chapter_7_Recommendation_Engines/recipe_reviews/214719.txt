Although this was not really batter bread (yeast bread that is beaten rather than kneaded and formed)  I was still eager to try it. It had great reviews and enticing ingredients.  But I should have paid more attention to the high ratio of eggs to flour because if I had I probably could have predicted that not only is this not batter bread, it’s not bread at all.  The texture is very eggy and has no crumb. It smelled good as it was baking and it tasted good too.  But this is more like an oven omelet, so for that reason alone this recipe was very disappointing.

Great bread!  I used whole wheat flour.  Next time we will try using jalapeno peppers for even more spice!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was not only delicious, but beautiful as well! I made this exactly as written and thought it was very moist and had wonderful flavor. Gabe ate 2 slices, lol! Cyndi, thanks so much for a great new quick bread recipe that we will enjoy again and again! :)

Yum, yum, yum!! This smells INCREDIBLE baking, is gorgeous when sliced, & tastes AMAZING! We absolutely LOVED it!! I used 2 small cans(4 oz each) of mushrooms, chopped, drained & squeezed to get most of the moisture out. Delish!!

I loved this recipe!  My only substitution was zucchini for the mushrooms since this is what I had on hand.  I will definately make this again and try with different veggie combos.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I used cheddar jack cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This is delicious served warm. I will definitely make this again! Thanks, Cyndi, for sharing your recipe!

This was very good. I accidently doubled up on the onion and bell peppers. But it turned out great. Tasted like a south western style omlet in a way.

I have to admit I was surprised how delicious this was. Made exactly as written (I may have added more garlic). Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.

It was delicious.  I was, however, skeptical about the amount of egg in it, and I was right to be skeptical.  It was decisively like an omelette in the form of bread.  I'd suggest cutting down to two eggs if you want something more like bread, but it was definitely delicious!

(Doubt it made a difference, but I used fresh garlic in place of garlic salt and omitted the mushrooms. I also added a little more flour as I don't have a measuring device--but have been eyeballing a long time--and the pour line says "the batter will be stiff"...and mine wasn't as stiff as I felt "stiff" should be.)
