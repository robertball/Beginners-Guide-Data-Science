Really good. It's true - you need lots of recipes with a hunter around! My kids who don't usually like roasted duck loved this. Thanks.

Excellent!  I could not find the recommended sauce  and only had 1/4 cup honey.  I used a buffalo wing sauce, added 2 tablespoon melted butter and a little honey pecan sauce that we found a little too sweet for barbecue and LOVED the end result. I think you can play around with whatever sauce you have and this recipe will turn out great!

Made again last night.  We use a mixture with some panko bread crumbs and whatever leftover fish batter we have and it makes it extra crispy.  Shore Lunch makes a buffalo fish batter that is hard to find, but great mixed with the panko if you can find it.  Couldn't find hooters sauce so used regular buffalo sauce (use much less than the hooter sauce as it will be more spicy) with 1/4 butter with the honey as that was great also.  I think you could leave out the butter altogether too.  Everyone raved about it.

Great recipe! Very good recipe to have in your rotation during pheasant season! I'm sure it is equally as good with other birds, but it was delicious with the pheasant we had!

Very good. Pheasant was moist. Taste will depend on the sauce used. Will use a less sweet wing/barbecue sauce next time.
