This dish has an extremely strong odor due to the apple cider vinegar as well as the fish as it’s baking. Do not let this throw you. The dish is quite tasty when you have the mandarin orange relish and fish in your mouth it is absolutely sublime.  I can’t eat cilantro so I did not add it. I also substituted fresh mandarin oranges (clementine) for the canned. The only down is the initial smell which is why the 4?? rating. Finicky family members liked it too so we will repeat it.
