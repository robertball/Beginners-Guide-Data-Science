YUM! 

I really really like this! However, I made a few SUBSTANTIAL changes:

I added beans instead of hominy. Hominy doesn't exist in the Northeast - at least that I could find - so I used beans. I used two approx. 1.5 cups of kidney beans, and then used black beans. I was originally going to add only another 1/2 cup of black beans, but then I changed my whole approach (which I'll get into), so I opted for the whole can (14 oz?). 

2. I let this cook a LOT longer than recommened - approx. 2 or more hours. It was very "stew-like" when cooked in the way recommended, which they admitted from the start, but I decided that I really wanted thick chili, not stew. It worked awesome! I think the starch from the beans had a lot to do with that, so keep that in mind. 

Anyway, my version rocked. I can't vouch for the recipe in its orignial form, except to say that it smelled good from the moment I got it in the pan. 

One last thing - it's definitiely on the spicy side. My sensitve boyfriend couldn't eat it. I like spice, and I could, but my nose did run a bit. Modify the chili powder as you see fit.

I live in the Northeast and have never had a problem finding hominy.  I always find it in the canned vegetable section, near the corn.  I love this recipe.  I used chicken instead of turkey (that's what I had on hand).  So yum.

I REALLY liked this recipe.  Hominy can be found in the Hispanic section of our grocery stores and it really makes this dish superb!  I added some tabasco for a bit more kick.  Family loved it and it was a great way to use those turkey leftovers I had frozen since November!
Thanks for the recipe!

All the time I was cooking this, I thought I was going to hate it. I don't care for tomatoe based soups and I don't like peppers. I tasted it while the tomatoes were simmering and thought it was terrible. But when I added the turkey and cilantro, there was a magic transformation. Suddenly it was delicious. I will make this many times. I used smoked turkey because it was what I had, and I think that made it better. I was skeptical about the amount of chili, but it was not too much at all. This is an excellent recipe that I will pass on to others

Very good.  Fast & Easy with ingreidents on hand.  Doubled the hominy and the chicken broth.  Used 2 heaping tbls of chili powder.  Young kids and adults alike loved this.  Will make again.  **TIP** Freeze leftover turkey (chopped) in 3-4 cup freezer bags.  Makes putting this soup together - fast & easy!

This is the frickin bomb!  I used green onions instead, a 1 small yellow bell pepper, 4 cups of chicken broth, doubled the hominy, and omitted the salt and pepper.  I am a salty girl and I can honestly say adding it at the end would have been too much, even for me.  It was spicy enough, too, so no pepper either.  I followed the cooking directions to a "t".  Dude, yum!

No hominy in the north?! What a terrible situation! Although we have plenty of hominy here in Texas, I had a can of creamed corn on hand and didn't feel like going to the store. It worked great! Also, I added a little bit of Cumin which gave it more of a smokey chili flavor. If you really like heat drop a whole pickeled jalapeno in the stew while it simmers. Great recipe!

Needed more of the following for my liking: more broth (used 32oz (1Qt) of broth), more hominy (29oz can of hominy), more spices (2tbsp of cumin, 2tbsp oregano), more garlic (6 cloves). It was a 5star in my book after making the above modifications.

It was very good! Used slightly less than 1/4 cup chili powder and leftover-turkey, diced. Only had crushed tomatoes, but that was fine as it made the stew liquid creamier. Like lasagna, it is better the second day!

Great Turkey leftovers recipe. I would suggest a little more hominy and a little less chili powder. I spiced it up by substituting hot Rotel for the diced tomatoes. Try it served in burritos.

Like others, I modified with pinto beans.  I also only used a tablespoon of chili powder.  It was good, a great way to use leftover turkey.

I used ground turkey and added a can of pinto beans. My family likes it hot, so I added a small can of diced roasted chiles. All in all, a nice, healthy chili!

Great recipe.  A good switch for right after Thanksgiving: Leftover turkey with a "kick".  I added a little Tabasco to the recipe for an added kick.
