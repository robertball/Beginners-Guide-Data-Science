HELPFUL TIPS AFTER MAKING THIS ALL MY LIFE:  Being Asian, I love running into recipes that remind me of things I already make.  The most important thing to take from these reviews is to DOUBLE THE SAUCE.  My relatives would not want to eat any of these that have made this as is. ...just doesn't taste like anything you'd have at a good restaurant (as this is american chinese, not authentic).  Doubling the sauce ingred. was just the right amount of sauce to accompany a side of rice.  Don't overcook the steak.  Frying until you get a nice brown color is the perfect way to tell if it's done & the estimate times on the recipe are pretty accurate assuming your slices are thin.  Any mixture of veggies work (mushrooms, carrots, frozen peas, red peppers, sliced zucchini, water chestnuts) ...or just grabbing a frozen stir-fry bag of veggies.  I add half a bag, and use the other half for the crispy orange chicken from this site that I also make when I'm making oriental food for guests.  Red Wine VINEGAR is an acceptable substitution, but I'd encourage you to try more recipes on this site using rice vinegar!

I hate reviews that change the recipe then rate the original one, TRY the original one and let us know. SO..I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY..AWESOME! My husband is not a stir-fry fan, HE IS NOW! "Since trying" the original recipe I have played with it, added zucchini, carrots, etc.. No matter what I add to it, it is ALWAYS A WINNER. This is  MUST TRY. THIS is going into my KEEPER RECIPE file! Thanks for a GREAT "AS IS" RECIPE!!

This was a great evening meal for the family in my opinion. I did alter the recipe some by adding canned slice mushrooms, water crescents, green onion, and baby corn to the veggies. I also used a snow pea stirfry veggie mix to get more of a variety of veggies (I love'em!). I used butter instead of cooking oil as well to add flavor. Since there were so many veggies, I doubled the sauce mixture and used garlic red wine vinegar in place of the rice wine since I couldn't find it at the  store. Served over white rice with chow mein noodles over top. Delicious!

I used a leftover rib eye, cooked to  MR, & sliced it thin before sauteeing. I did use sesame oil to saute in, I did double the sauce, I used mirin for the rice wine, added 2 pea size dollops of wasabi, added a half a can of water chestnuts & about a cup each of sugar snap peas, sliced buttons & broccoli. The sauce was semi-bland so I hit it w/ about 1/2 cup of orange juice & a tbp. more of fresh grated ginger....big improvement. Served it over jasmine rice, garnished w/ sliced green onions & toasted sesame seeds. I finished it w/ Pineapple Orange Sorbet (from this site.)  & that complemented the dish perfectly.

This was delicious and easy to make. I added sliced mushrooms, scallions, and water chestnuts. I also doubled the sauce and added a bit more cornstarch to it. In addition, I threw in some teriyaki sauce and asian hot chili paste for some more flavor - my company loved it. I also used a better cut of meat; I used sirloin, which I thought to be more tender and flavorful. I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe twice. I found that the secret is slicing the meat very thin. The suggestion of marinating the meat also added more flavor. I used sugar snap peas the second time instead of snow peas and thought it also added more flavor.

This was WONDERFUL! I liked the cut of beef I used. I liked that I added thinly sliced onion and water chestnuts. I used rice vinegar instead of rice wine (not sure if there's a big difference) but my dish turned out fabulous. Thank you for sharing! YUM!

Quick, easy and excellent!  Couldn't find Rice Wine, so used white cooking wine instead.  Also used ground ginger, instead of fresh minced ginger root.  Came out great.  Made a double recipe - No Leftovers!

This dish is delicious and so simple to make. My picky meat-eating boyfriend loved it too! I replaced the snow-peas with regular green peas and it was much more enjoyable to eat. I would recommend doubling the sauce ingriedients especially when served over plain white rice...yummy!

I am half-oriental, so I grew up eating all kinds of oriental foods, and this recipe is one of the BEST stir fries I've had!!  I did make a few changes, though.  

First, I forgot to add the sugar to the sauce, but I think I wouldn't have liked it anyway, so I'm glad I left it out.  :)  I also doubled the sauce, because the stated amount didn't seem to make enough (as other raters have mentioned).  

I cooked the meat first and set it aside.  I reduced the amount of ginger and garlic (my husband doesn't like too much of either) to about 1/2 tsp. each (I just used the stuff grated/minced in a jar...easier that way).  After frying, I added 1 Tbsp. butter, 5 fresh mushrooms (sliced and chopped), and 2 med-size carrots (sliced thinly); stir-fried all until carrots were crisp-tender.  Then added green peppers (3 small, sliced in strips), snow peas (halved, strings and tips removed), 1 can bamboo shoots (drained), and the cooked meat.  Fried about 2-3 minutes, added sauce, and followed rest of recipe directions.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

Really needs to be in a wok.  The meat is a little chewy and my sauce didn't thicken when following this recipe.  Flavor was decent though.

I made extra of the sauce, some of which I used to marinate the beef for awhile before I got started cooking.  I used just a pinch of ground ginger, and added some chicken broth and a tad more cornstarch to compensate.  Rather than snow peas I used a mix of vegetables - celery, onions, mushrooms, baby bok choy, red bell pepper, zucchini and bean sprouts.  Loved it this way, but I know I wouldn't have been nearly as enthusiastic about this with just snow peas.

Sooo good!  I 4X's the sauce--cause we like sauce.  Just for the 2 of us.  Marinated the steak in the sauce most of the day.  Added stir fry veggies from the store.  I did add a bit of toasted sesame oil at the end just because we love it.  I would wear it as perfume if I could.  Wonderful!  BTW:  Rice wine is NOT the same as rice vinegar.  Look for Shaohsing Rice Cooking Wine OR dry sherry.  It does make a difference.

I thought this was a great recipe. I used the thin sliced steak prepackaged in the meat section, less cutting! I also am a huge fan of water chestnuts so I added those, as well as onion. I didn't have any rice wine, but I added 1 Tbsp of Cider Vinegar and it came out great. I did let the meat marinate in the sauce for about an hour before cooking. This was incredible over rice noodles. I tried this sauce with chicken recently and thought it was ok, but much better with the steak. A nice switch from a store bought sauce.

I have to admit, this was great and I was suprised at how light and flavorful the sauce was.  I also doubled the sauce and it works well over rice, or with noodles added at the end and coated. As a side note, I noticed many, many reviews that stated that the taste was way too 'vinegary'.  Please note that the recipe calls for RICE WINE, not RICE WINE VINEGAR.  I almost made that mistake, too.  Thanks, all, and happy cooking!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I used sirloin, which I salted and peppered.  Next time I might season it a bit more beforehand. I also tripled the sauce ingredients as another reviewer recommended.  If you like sauce for your rice or noodles, definitely triple the recipe.  Also, you can easily add any of your favorite stir fry vegetables to this.  I added red peppers, but would also like to try it with broccoli, baby corns, or even green beans or asparagus.  You can reallly cater this to your tastes. Very easy (I followed the directions exactly), very delicious, very impressive.  Thanks!

This recipe was great, and I'm not a beef lover.  I thawed the meat in the marinade, so it marinated for quite a while.  I also used more sugar (wasn't sweet enough) and cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  Very tender meat, and delicious flavor.

I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce.  If I had read other reviews first, I would have seen that is was a recurring theme in the reviews.  Also, I think I overcooked the meat, as it turned out a tad tough for us.  Maybe with the above changes, it would be better.  But a nice try for my first attempt at anything "asian" that didn't come from a frozen bag.

All I can say is WOW!  We LOVED this!  I couldn't find rice wine, so I used cooking sherry as other people suggested and it was excellent.  I made 4 times the sauce just so we would have extra for rice.  I made it with Asian Coconut Rice from this site and that was a FANTASTIC pairing!  Added some water chestnuts and broccoli too which really soaked up the sauce.  The cooking time was right on!  Super easy! Super quick!  Super Good!  I cannot wait to make again.

This was a great, quick meal. I doubled the sauce so there would be enough to spoon some over the rice. I used rice wine vinegar, and also added some sliced onion. Would definitely make this again.

This was delicious.  Not only did I double the sauce, but I doubled it and marinaded the beef strips in it for several hours and then made another batch (doubling it) and heating it in a pot to thicken it and then pouring over the servings.  I also added Asian chili sauce to spicen it up a bit.

This was awesome!! The only change I made was to use ribeye instead of round steak. It turns out much more tender. This is a great quick & easy dish that everyone will love!

If you add the correct amount of cornstarch or arrow root to the sauce before cooking and mix it in well. then you won't have to wait for the sauce to reduce and thcken. Tthereby, not overcooking the meat and snow peas. Nothing worse than overcooked stir-fry!

Good flavor. Doubled the sauce as others suggested and it was just right to spoon over rice. Added more veggies.

This wasn't PF Chang's but the sauce had a super flavor!!  I froze the meat for about 30 minutes so that I could cut it very thin!  I sauteed the meat on high heat to try to get some browning (added the garlic and ginger afterwards...didn't want it to over cook).  Doubled the sauce (which I highly recommend) and used frozen mixed Asian veggies.  Served over basmati rice.  Pretty great for a random Monday or Tuesday night meal.  Quick too.

This recipe is a great base to start with. But to make better than your local Chinese take out this is what I did. I started with sesame oil in my well seasoned wok (makes all the difference) and sauteed the garlic. I then added fresh broccoli,snap peas, and onion. Cooked until tender. I then removed the veg's to bowl and cooked salt and peppered steak until rare. I tripled the sauce and put the fresh ginger in sauce and corn starch (mix corn starch and water in separate bowl and pout into sauce right before use) I then added the veg's back to meat, poured sauce over mixture and bring to boil. Turned heat on low and added some fresh pineapple (optional). I served with light fried whole grain rice with garlic and was amazing!

I have a recipe that follows this one but has fresh mushrooms, water chestnuts,  red, yellow or orange bell pepper to it .  I use fresh veggies and double the sauce when I make Thai sticky rice. I use fresh veggies to avoid the added sodium like most frozen have. 

1 or 2 fresh bell peppers, 1 sm pkg fresh mushrooms. 2 hand-fulls of fresh snow peas are well under $10.

Even the  pic. on this site looks like they added red bell pepper to it.

This was really good and easy.  I used the frozen bagged stir fry mix with broccoli which really cut down on time!  Definitely use fresh ginger.  It adds a lot of flavor.  Served with white rice.

Four stars as written, 5 when made with my substitutes. Instead of doubling all the sauce ingredients to increase the volume (which would add a huge amount of sodium,) I added a cup of beef stock (canned may be used) and increased the cornstarch to 2 tsp, which I dissolved in the stock before adding. The result was a very tasty, appetizingly brown sauce to spoon over the veggies and beef. Be sure to mince the garlic and ginger root very finely. Used lean top round steak which worked very well. Added a small can of sliced water chestnuts, drained. Also used 1 Tb rice vinegar and 2 Tb mirin (rice wine) at the same time as the other liquid ingredients. This resulted in plenty of very flavorful sauce to go over 1/2 cup rice cooked with 1 cup water. Every morsel was inhaled. Absolutely rockin'!!

We loved this recipe!! Way to Go HOLLY! I made this one evening for dinner with my inlaws. I rooted around in the freezer and found Round Steak, barely defrosted and sliced it thin. The only real change I made to the recipe was to add a bit of Hot Garlic Chili Sauce (Sun Luck) and it really jazzed it up, not that there was anything wrong with it before. I also doubled the sauce and added just a tad more cornstarch to make it just a smidge thicker. Anyway, excellent recipe. I've been begged to make it again (by my ultra picky Mother In Law) BTW, if anyone here (like my MIL) has Celiac disease and can't eat wheat, you can by Soy Sauce that is wheat free and then this recipe is 100% A OK and no one will feel like they are only getting  so so supper.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good. As others have mentioned I would double the sauce.  Also I marinated my meat in 1 tbsp of baking soda and water for a few hours before I cooked the meat to make it tender.

Another good recipe MARBALET. This was easy and rather quick for a stir-fry. I wasn't going to buy rice wine for 2 tablespoons, so I just used a sweeter white wine I had in the house. For the one lb of beef it was equal 2 thick round steaks I got from Sam's. The actual recipe made about 2 large servings or 3 small ones though. My only real tip is to make sure to slice the beef paper thin or buy it that way. I served this tonight with a bag of instant rice I boiled in the microwave, for 5 minutes, for ease tonight. Excellent stir fry - Thanks!

This was okay; I doubled the sauce and added another teaspoon of corn starch; still not what I'm looking for, but the kids liked it well enough. I also added sliced baby portabello mushrooms, shredded carrots, broccoli instead of snow peas, and some yellow squash to add some color.

Wonderful fresh flavors.  The garlic and ginger stand up to the beef--no need to add any other seasoning.  I marinated the beef strips in the soy/rice wine mixture for 15 minutes before stir-frying; this helps to tenderize (as does slicing the beef against the grain).  I like the suggestion of slicing the ginger for easy removal at service.  This will be served again.

It was great but I think CityGirl22 is right.. more sauce, with teriyaki, mushrooms, scallions & water chestnuts would make it perfect!  Next time I'll do it that way.  I also like to use Jasmine Rice.  I also couldn't find Rice Wine so I used dry sherry.  I used Sugar Snap Peas and a good cut of meat.  Put the beef in the freezer for a while and the thin slicing will be much easier and safer. Enjoy!

I love love this recipe. It's so easy to make and taste great! One thing though, you have to double the sauce. Also make sure to prep your snow peas or snap peas by removing stringy part off both ends. Not fun to eat with that on them.

GREAT with a few adjustments: 1. As everyone has said, at LEAST double the sauce. 2. Marinate the meat in the sauce for at least a few hours beforehand (I included some garlic in the sauce for this). I also added a bit of sambal chili paste to the sauce for extra heat, as well as some red/yellow bell peppers for sweetness/texture/color. Sesame oil instead of vegetable oil is also a nice touch if available. 

The only tricky part of this recipe is not overcooking anything but still giving the sauce enough time to thicken. Marinating the meat keeps it moister for longer, giving the sauce more time to reduce. I also suggest adding the snow peas late in the cooking process. In a simmering liquid, they'll go totally limp and lose their crunch pretty quickly--they really don't need more than about 3-4 minutes on the heat. Flavors are fantastic, though--definitely a keeper!

Awesome! I don't do vegetables and if stir fried the way recommended, the snow peas come out with perfect snap. I stir fried some yellow and red peppers in sesame oil for 30 seconds and added after the snow peas  for extra color and flavor. Added a little bit of ginger and garlic after adding snow peas to stir fry. Served with a szechuan mango and chili dipping sauce over white rice.....AWESOME!

I thought this was good but felt the vinegar was overpowering.  Next time, I will cut the vinegar in half and perhaps substitute mirin or rice wine.

This was ok, just your average stir fry, nothing special.  Maybe adding more stuff to make it stand out some would help, maybe I'll try again sometime and add more garlic, some crushed red pepper and hot oil and see if that helps.

I thought this was great. Very quick and easy. Nice subtle flavor. I liked the distinctiveness of the flavors and how they flowed. Wasn't a great hit with the kids but mine are really weird eaters anyway. I'll be making this again. Thanks.

I thought this was wonderful. It had a very good flavor that would work well with chicken too. My husband took over and stir fryed it after it marinated. We substituted teriyaki sauce for soy sauce, red wine vinegar for rice wine and broccoli for the snow peas. We also added peanuts. It was served with white rice.

Very simple recipe. Sometimes I use sugar peas and a sliced red pepper
to give it a nice color. Very tasty. I make this dish very often and am known 
for my stir fries!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight my  husband went bananas over it!  I added brown mushrooms, red onion and a tomato cut in quarters and it was really delicious.  I think that you need to add more things to it other than just snow peas.  Five Stars in my family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

RICE WINE vs RICE VINEGAR: I couldn't find rice wine at the store but had rice vinegar at home. Unsure if they were the same thing, I looked online for info. Here's what I found on the Seattle Times website in their Food and Wine section: "Part of the problem is that rice vinegar is often called rice wine vinegar. Both rice vinegar and rice wine are made from fermented rice, but different processes are employed. ...To add depth or sweetness to a dish, use rice wine... Try sherry as a substitute in recipes that call for rice wine instead of reaching for the rice vinegar; it's a closer match. ...Use rice vinegar to perk up or heighten flavors, such as those in sweet-and-sour dishes, or use the condiment in place of more tart vinegars when you want to soften the edges of a dressing or marinade." After reading that, I used sherry because that's what I had. Other than that, I made the recipe as written but using low sodium soy sauce due to health issues. I have to say that none of us (hubby, myself and our 2 teenaged sons) really cared for this dish. It was OK, we all cleaned our plates, but nothing to rave about. It could be due to the low sodium soy sauce, but this had little flavor. I have used that same soy sauce in other Asian dishes, however, that have turned out wonderful. Also, sauce didn't thicken up so I had to add more cornstarch. Anyways, I will stick to my other Asian recipes.

The picture shows different vegetables than what was in the recipe. I  like the pictured version better. A little more attractive and crispy. The basic recipe is good.I added a dash of gravy master browning sauce to bring out the flavors. It is good with broccoli too.

I doubled the sauce & used it to marinate the meat. I also added mushrooms,onions, carrots & peppers. It definitely needed more flavor in the sauce but that's probably because I added more veggies. All in all an easy & good recipe to build from.

Very good; a little too salty for my taste, but we seldom use salt.  I halved the meat and vegetable, essentially doubling the sauce recipe.  I used low-sodium soy sauce, rice vinegar (white), and halved the garlic as we don't use a lot of garlic.  I served it over brown rice.  I'll be making this again soon with a wider assortment of vegetables.

Good flavor.  I doubled the recipe as others suggested.  By the time the sauce thickened, the meat and snow peas were over cooked.  I would recommend cooking the sauce separately then adding at the end.

I dislike it when people change the recipe then rate it. It is not a honest rating of the recipe. The first time I made this recipe I altered it slightly. I tripled the sauce my wife and I do not like plain dry rice. That extra sauce was just the right amount for us. I don't consider this changing the recipe, but a purist might.
The second time I made it I did make additions to it. I added sliced green onions, sliced mushrooms and some shredded carrots and the additional sauce. We thought that this made the recipe even better. 
Very good basic recipe with lots of potential. Thank you MARBALET.

Great recipe! I made just as written, except I substituted broccoli for the snow peas and I used flank steak. I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce but would probably double it next time or maybe add some beef broth just to make the sauce go a little further. This was very easy to make.

Simple and tasty. I found this recipe using the ingredient search for beef and snow peas, so I made this with what I had on hand. Here are my substitutions  (1) replaced the rice wine [which I did not have] and brown sugar with bottled teriyaki sauce (2) had no ginger on hand, so I used a bit of curry while cooking the meat (3) I doubled the fresh garlic

I served this over egg noodles with a side of Seapak shrimp spring rolls, and it was a quick and excellent meal.

Very Good!  I also made the mistake of buying rice wine vinegar but thanks to other reviewers I caught my mistake before I made the recipe. Since I had sherry on hand I substituted it for the rice wine.  I followed the recipe ingredients  exactly except for the rice wine .  I did double the sauce since so many other reviewers recommended this and I was glad I did.  The snow peas I added at the very end because we like them with a bit of crunch.

Love this - I doubled the sauce, as recommended by many others, and it was perfect.  Cooking the beef strips slowly and evenly, until just pink in the pan is the key to melt-in-your mouth beef - you may even need to cook half at a time, to ensure the beef isn't sitting on top of other pieces, which would cause some strips to cook more than others.  This is key. Those who try to quickly brown the beef, will find tougher beef.

Very tasty. I agree with those who have said to double the sauce though. My sauce didn't thicken but it could be old cornstarch. And if you don't like ginger, I think it can just be left out. The brown sugar sweetens up the soy sauce just fine.

Per some of the other reviews, I doubled the sauce and I added a frozen bag of mixed broccoli, onions, peppers, and mushrooms.  I served with basmati rice.  Very tasty and easy!

Very easy to make with simple ingredients.  I doubled the sauce but next time I would use low sodium soy sauce as the sodium levels are high when you double the sauce.

I don't remember what beef I used but it was quite tough.   Stick with what's recommended in the recipe and you should have excellent luck.  Very flavorful stuff and easy to make.  Enjoy!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this. I added some carrots as well and doubled the sauce as recommended, that was definitely the right call. I also thought I had rice wine but realized it was rice vinegar that I had so I used some sherry instead and it turned out fine. Also added a dash of chili pepper at the end for a little heat.

like the others....not sure if the poster meant rice wine or rice wine vinegar....so I put both in to cover my bases! 2 TB rice wine vinegar and 1 Tb of wine. I made it with chicken since that is what I had defrosted/on hand. The previous posters are correct...not enough sauce. Need to make double the sauce amount.

Nothing too exciting but a nice dinner. The only things I did differently was using ground ginger, and broccoli because the store didn't have any snow peas. My sauce never really got thick but it was tasty enough. Easy and fast, I'd make this again!

this was good! I will make this again, the marinade had such such good flavor. For veggies I added one onion, 2 small green bell peppers and 1 very large brocoli crown and it was perfect! this would be good with whatever veggies you have on hand. served with brown rice and a side of sauteed garlic bok choy and it was a healthy, filling, satisfying meal!

Wow – this is so very, very good and so incredibly easy.  Be sure to use fresh ginger, garlic and pea pods for the ultimate flavor results.  I used sugar snap peas and doubled the sauce as recommended by other reviewers.  I served this over rice which of course was the perfect accompaniment.   Fast, easy, and so very delicious – this is a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious.  It really tasted like it came from a Chinese restaurant.  I did, however, tweak it quite a bit, as follows:  First of all, instead of just snow peas, I added red bell pepper and broccoli florets -- which I cooked first.  When they were done
 to my desired tenderness, I pushed them to the back of the pan and added the beef.  ALSO, to the liquid mixture, I added about a TBS of toasted sesame oil (a must for flavor!).  And then, towards the end, I added a few red pepper flakes, and served over brown rice.  I agree with others: make at least triple the sauce. Can't wait to eat this again!

This was very yummy, I loved the sauce.  My only complaint is that it didn't get thick enough, I didn't want to add more cornstarch after it had reduced some, but will up the amt for the next time. I will definetly use the sauce recipe in the future as a dipping sauce for pot stickers or egg rolls.

My family enjoyed, next time I will reduce the rice vinegar by 1/2 and add ginger to the veggies when I saute them to add extra flavor.  My veggies seemed too rice "vinegary" even with the sauce doubled.  We loved the ginger flavor of the meat.

This is an excellent base recipe!  We added more veggies. Bok choy, broccoli, carrots.  and added extra ginger.  we did double the sauce because we had it over rice.  We will be make this again and maybe add something to spice it up a bit.

yum. dusted thin strips of beef round roast (cut against the grain) with flour before browning.  doubled sauce, used some beef stock to increase sauce volume.  added carrots and onion and peas, shook on sesame seeds too. added hot pepper flakes to give some heat.  served with glass noodles  followed directions except i took out beef after just browned then added it back in after veggies were done and sauce was thickened and cooked all together for a minute or so

Okay, the beef was not good, I don't know if it was the cut or what. Very boring, I added more of everything but still nothing special. Won't make this again.

I found this recipe using the AllRecipes' DinnerSpinner on the iPhone app.  It sounded too good to pass up, and I was right!  Suggested changes are substituting sesame oil for the vegetable oil, double (or triple!) the sauce as suggested below, and use low sodium soy sauce.  Also marinating the meat in the sauce (without snow peas) for as long as possible, up to 24 hours. I add shredded carrots with the snow peas - be careful not to cook the snow peas too long.  They should be slightly crunchy.

Turned out very nice, had them with fried rice.Very easy to make for a quick lunch. I would be careful with the soy sauce and salt the next time though.

I've been searching for a stir-fry sauce for a while now, and this is the first one both my husband and I liked!  I will probably use it with all meat and veggie combinations from now on.  I always at least double and thicken the sauce, but this has such a strong/good flavor that I didn't need as much as usual.  Also,  be prepared to serve as soon as the snow peas are added, as they cook in about 2 minutes.  WONDERFUL when bright green and crisp;  not so great 2 minutes later when they are overcooked. THANKS for a great recipe!

A very good recipe! My hubby loved it, although it took a lot more than 15 minutes to be ready, it was so worth it the wait, my kids liked it very much also, I don't like to change the recipes also, so I followed the instructions as they came, it needed salt at the end, but once it was done, I really liked it.

I love any recipe that has me spending more time at the table chewing, than in the kitchen cooking!  This one was very simple to make, and enjoyable to share with my family.  The highlight for me was watching my three year old scarf it down, since he is not a fan of red meat.  We found a winner for him, anyway.  However, my husband thought this was bland.  When given the option to take leftovers for lunch, he turned up his nose.  So, I rate this a three--easy to make, a simple pleasure (I liked it, but didn't love it), but not terribly flavorful or robust.  But then again, I used Tamari instead of a fuller flavored and maybe saltier soy sauce.  Perhaps if I weren't allergic to wheat I could have a go at the heartier soy & see a difference.  I served it over a bed of Asian rice vermicelli & highly recommend this addition. I will make this again--when my husband is out of town & I need to just feed the kiddos & me  (grins).

The night I made this I was unimpressed and thought it tasted a bit bland, but when I reheated it for lunch the next day it really tasted much better. The flavors must have melded together over night. Makes me think that marinating the beef would have help this recipe tremendously.

This one is REALLY tasty.  I used sweet peppers & mushrooms in lieu of the snowpeas, and it turned out great.  Thinly slicing & marinating the meat for about 1/2 hour kept it tender, and helped the flavors penetrate.  Definitely a keeper!

Due to diet restrictions, I did not add the brown sugar and used sesame oil. It was great!

Some kids will go for the peas, others won't.  This dish is DELICIOUS and SO easy to make.  One boo boo, my hubby somehow put 5 TIMES the amount of soy sauce.  (Don't ask...)  SO, it was mighty potent, but I know when it's made right it is just delicious.  Try it!

I added sliced red pepper with the garlic and ginger. I doubled the soy, starch,sugar and rice vinegar  marinade and soaked the sliced beef with half. The other half I added in a hot, electric wok with snapped snow peas. It was delicious with brown rice. The sauce thickened perfectly.

I made this with some prime venison but I did not have rice wine. Instead I used 1tbl spoon rice wine vinegar and 1 tbl spoon of red wine.
It was awsome. Would maybe increase the corn starch next time so it thickens more.

We tried this for dinner tonight.  It was very good.  We quadrupled the sauce & were glad we did.  The sauce could be used with many different vegetables.

It calls for rice WINE, which I had a hard time finding out here in rural America. (I had to make a trip to the Big City!) However, this was excellent. I doubled the sauce, except for the brown sugar. I froze my round steak for about 15-20 minutes so I could slice it very thin. That's the key to having it turn out tender. To the leftovers today, I added mushrooms, zucchini, bean sprouts and some sliced green onion, all sauteed in toasted sesame oil.

There's too much brown sugar in it. Some sesame oil is needed. I'd suggest adding 1/2 cup of beef broth (or more), increasing the wine and soy sauce, plus a little more cornstarch. To me the best type of meat to use is the frozen, thin steak sandwich beef. Marinate the meat for a while to allow the wine and soy sauce to give it more flavor. For a healthy change add sauteed mushrooms, water chestnuts, a few slivvers of peppers, chopped bok choy and green onions.

Delicious. Raves from entire family. I used notes from several reviewers, don't think it changed recipe all that much-just made it work for me;)
I doubled recipe (meat) and quadrupled sauce. Added a generous pinch of red pepper flakes with the garlic and ginger to give it just a little zing. Definitely used more vegetables - why waste a perfectly good stir-fry with just one veggie Threw in broccoli and mushrooms first for a few minutes, then added yellow pepper, snap peas and green onions and then dumped in the sauce. My sauce didn't get that nice glaze I was looking for so removed a little of the sauce and added ~1tsp cornstarch - that did the trick. Beautiful glaze but not too thick, it was perfect. Could prepare this again tonight and make it look completely different - love this basic recipe for a weeknight meal.

Slicing your beef really thin is easy if you  put the steak in the freezer for an hour before you prep.

This was a crowd pleaser in my house!  The only thing we changed was doubling the sauce and adding more veggies.  The second time, I didn't have beef so I used chicken...still tasted great.  Very versatile, basic recipe that can be modified for your household.  An FYI - We made it soy free (substitute Coconut Aminos for the soy sauce) because we have a child with a soy allergy.  Just made sure to salt the meat and veggies and it was still amazing.

Excellent!  I stayed as true to the recipe as possible, only having to substitute the Rice Wine with Rice Vinegar.  I used top sirloin steak, sliced thin and heeded the warning in another review to not overcook, so the meat was very tender.   5 out of 5 at the dinner table liked it, which is a big deal in my family!

There needs to be 6 stars for this. Even my ulta-picky son in law loves it. Some other reviewer had said to cook your beef slow for it to be tender, I have always heard "hot and fast" I do this use GOOD beef, sirloin or flank....make sure your knife is SHARP....freeze up to 30 min and slice SUPER thin and it should be SUPER tender (mine always is) the other nice thing about thin slicing? It goes farther. I too use the rice wine vinegar but it seems fine. I make 6x the sauce lol, and we gobble it up! I saw this recipe in a allrecipe magazine I got over a year ago and gave been making it regularly since. Like I said needs SIX stars

The sauce is amazing! I did double the sauce ingredients and it needed a full tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it. Loved the recipe although I used sugar snap peas and added a sliced red pepper and fresh mushrooms too. Thanks for sharing!

My family and I enjoyed this dish. I used zucchini and mushrooms for my choice of vegetables. I used a splash of sesame oil with the vegetable oil and garlic infused rice vinegar. I doubled the sauce per other's recommendations and doubled the cornstarch so my sauce would thicken quickly. 
Everyone had second helpings so it must have been a hit. ;)

My husband and I love this recipe. I use a dash of ground ginger and substitute water for rice wine (because I don't have it). I half the meat and peas but keep the measurements for the sauce. Perfect amount for 2 served over rice.

It was passable.  The sauce was just okay.  I over-cooked the beef and peas because the sauce took forever to thicken. I had to add lots more cornstarch to get it to thicken.  I probably will not make this again.

Yup...pretty danged good!  I did make a few changes, after reading most of the reviews.  
1) I started with about 1/4 c. fine diced onion plus 1/4 c. med. chopped red bell pepper before the garlic/ginger.
2) Didn't have the rice wine so subbed cooking sherry instead - worked fine.
3) Added just a dash of crushed red pepper flake, Chinese five spice, and a dash of bottled teriyaki sauce.
4) I doubled the sauce, adding extra corn starch as I figure it's easier to thin a sauce (with a bit of water) than to stop the train and have to add more thickener.  Worked great.  
Served with homemade fried rice and frozen egg rolls.  Winner/winner!!

We loved it! Didn't add rice wine because we didn't have it. I would definitely recommend thickening the sauce before adding it to the meat and veggies. Everything was severely overcooked by the time the sauce thickened.

This is now my go to stir fry sauce. This time I used thinly sliced pork, mushrooms, and long beans and it was delicious. It is compatible with any meat/vegetable. I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested and I would do it again. It is very nice to have extra sauce for the rice. Very kid friendly but sophisticated at the same time.

This is a great recipe, but I had to make several substitutions. First of all, I live in NYC and have been to at least 4 grocery stores and several liquor stores and no one has ever heard of rice wine. So I just used a little white cooking wine instead, which worked out fine. Second, I use flank steak instead of top round and I use a ton of vegetables like red pepper, scallions, sometimes carrots, mushrooms etc. and it is always amazing.  My husband isn't a huge fan of sauce so I don't double it like a lot of other people do, but if I were making it for myself I would since it makes it more flavorful. Overall, the outcome is quick, easy and delicious and very easy to modify to your liking.

This was a great meal. Like everyone else suggested I did 4x's the amount of sauce and it was really good, other than that I didn't alter the recipe at all. Definitely one that everyone in our family loves and we never have any leftovers!!

This was a tasty recipe and so easy!  Next time I will cook the sauce separately, fry the steak 1/2 - 3/4  done, then add the thickened sauce to the steak at the end and cook a few minutes longer.  When I put it all together the steak ended up getting overcooked  and was tough.  I did double the sauce too.

I thought this was wonderful!!  I tripled all of the sauce ingredients because we love a lot of sauce. The rice vinegar smell was very STRONG but it wasn't overpowering in taste.  Next time I will use one less tblspn of vinegar and more ginger.  This is a keeper!!!

This recipe was amazing! I listened to another review and doubled the sauce, great tip! I also just added some water chesnuts and mushrooms. So delicious, fast, and easy!

Liked this quite a bit.  My only issue was the beef got a little on the tough side.  I think next time I may sautee that last, instead of first, in an attempt to keep it more tender.  I added mushrooms, which was a great addition.  The sauce is really good.  Per reviews I doubled it.  (did find I needed to more than double to cornstarch in order to get it to thicken).  Served on white rice.  Will make again.

Excellent sauce!  I left out the wine and used powdered ginger, it was great on our stir fry over noodles.

uh-may-zing. truly delicious. For presentation and some added vitamins, toss the beef in white sesame seeds when done cooking. I'll be making this over and over and over again.

Very tasty! I doubled the sauce as suggested, but did not have fresh ginger so I used 3/4 tsp of ground ginger. I used Mirin (sweet rice wine), and added onions, broccoli, cut baby corn, and sliced water chestnuts instead of snow peas (nobody in the family likes them). Going to make this again next week with ALL VEGGIES, and will use the same veggies as above but will add zucchini, carrot coins, bean sprouts, and whatever else might look good to add!

This recipe was simple, easy, and quick to make. No modifications were necessary at all; the recipe is perfect as is. I will add this to my staple of regular recipes since it is affordable and can be used with other meats and veggies.

Very easy to make and a great flavor. Be careful which kind of beef you get. I recommend spending a little extra on a nicer cut so the meat is tender. I've made this with the snow peas and also another time with zucchini. Kids love it!

It was alright. I've had better stir fry sauces. I think this needs to be marinated for a while.

I made this for dinner tonight and the only change I made was substituting Apple Cider Vinegar for the rice wine. It turned out great! We will definitely be making this again.

This was good.  I doused the beef with lite soy sauce and let it marinate while I prepped everything else.  Stir fried the meat and removed it from the pan, then added the snow peas, green onions, sliced red bell pepper to the wok, gave it a quick toss, then added the sauce (doubled) and beef back in to thicken the sauce and warm everything up.  Veggies did not get overcooked.

If you don't have a wok maybe this will help.  I don't have a wok.  I made this recipe once before and it was so so.  The meat was chewy and the veggies were bland and I figured it was because I didn't use a wok.  This time I deconstructed it a little and it came out much better.  First I combined the soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, corn starch, ginger, and garlic in a small sauce pan to simmer.  That gave the sauce time to thicken.  I steamed my veggies by themselves so they kept more flavor.  I cut my meat super thin to help it cook quickly and not get chewy, I threw it in a skillet with some olive oil and let it cook just till it was slightly pink in the middle.  Drained the water/juice from the meat, added the veggies, and poured the sauce over both.  Served over rice.  Turned out much better this time and I will make it again.  I made extra sauce because it didn't seem to have enough on the first try.  I also added a bit more brown sugar to the sauce as it seemed a bit to salty at first.

This sauce is very good.  I did add extra ginger & a splash of Tropicana 50 OJ (less sugar).  Next time, I'll marinate the meet for at least 3 hrs. and try a more tender cut of beef. Then will I give it 5 stars! Remember to double the sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  However, you do need to double the amount of sauce.  But don't double the amount of ginger or garlic.  I also added one red bell pepper sliced in thin strips, one can of baby corn and one can of sliced waterchestnuts.  Served over white rice.  Thanks Marbalet for posting this delicious recipe.

A Korean lady that I worked with 20 years ago made this and it was light, tasty, and quick to prepare.  She showed me but never wrote down the recipe. My recreation just never quite stood up until now -- I had left out the small amount of brown sugar and I had used rice wine vinegar instead of rice wine.  
Mignon also put in some carrots cut in to thin strips using a vegetable peeler.

This was very good. I did double the sauce as other reviews recommended. The only changes I made was I used ground ginger, I don't use enough root ginger to buy it, and I used broccoli since I couldn't find snow peas.

This was super fast and super easy! The timing on the meat is perfect.  What I did different was used sherry wine instead of rice wine because I didn't have any rice wine and I also doubled the sauce.  I highly recommend doubling the sauce.  My sauce never thickened, however it was still very good.  I served it over egg noodles.

The recipe was very simple and delicious! I flaked and didn't have any cornstarch on hand, however I just doubled the measurement and used flour. Same consistency! I also added some fresh mushrooms and spinach, we are veggie type folks. Plenty of flavor for such a simple dish! Quick and easy on one of our crazy weeknights!

I find it interesting that people have rated this recipe down for being too vinegary when there is no vinegar in the recipe... perhaps they added rice wine VINEGAR instead of rice WINE, which is what the recipe calls for?  
Anyway, since the recipe already includes sugar, I opted to use saki instead of the already-sweet mirin.  This recipe, if you look at the ingredients, makes a teriyaki flavored beef dish.  With fresh snow peas from the garden and served over jasmine rice, it was quite good and reasonably quick to make.  I took off one star since I really thought it could have used a little more sauce for the rice and, with the slicing of the beef, mixing the sauce, and chopping the garlic and ginger, it was NOT ready in 15 minutes.  Next time, I will double the sauce ingredients.

This was really good! I doubled the sauce and added in a bell pepper when I put the snow peas in the skillet. Very quick, very versatile, and very good!

I made this recipe only because I had some left over beef round.  So I ran an ingredient search and this came up.  Husband and I were pleasantly surprised.  Despite very simple ingredients and its similarity to other recipes I have made, this recipe tasted amazingly good, restaurant-like even. Definitely a keeper.

Pretty good. The family liked it and I really cant go wrong with a sitrfry. I dont really eat much steak so this is something for me to chage up the pace . I do use sugar snap peas instead, just my personal preference.  Ither that that, I make it just as directed.

I made this exactly as written except I added a little bit of hot pepper flakes into the sauce.  While good, I found it a bit bland.  It needed a bit more Unagi!  Not sure how to accomplish that, maybe some more ginger or some fish sauce.  The sauce did thicken and reduce quite well and coated the meat/peas nicely.

My 19 year old son pronounced this "amazing". I did double the sauce ingredients as suggested by others, and added mushrooms and water chestnuts, but otherwise made it as stated.  The fresh ginger and rice vinegar really make this special.  Definitely a great recipe as is.

Good dish. I liked the fact that you can use just about any veggie with it. I did triple the sauce because we are a 'rice & gravy' family. I will reduce the amount of ginger next time, just too overpowering for our taste. And I think I'll add a chinese pepper or two for a little more heat. Overall, it's a good start and will make again! Thanks!

Excellent dish for a quick weeknight meal.  I steamed the snowpeas before adding them to the dish and did not add rice wine. (where do you find that anyway?) :)

I tried this recipe for the first time and to my surprise, it turned out really yummy! The only thing I would change next time is to double to snowpeas. I thought it was not enought, but other than that, it was very delicious.

Loved this!  I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce, which made the perfect amount.  I also added red peppers and cooked them along with the snow peas.  I grated the garlic and ginger on a micro-planer, which is my new toy, and I felt that added to the flavor.  I would suggest using that if you have one.  It's a lot faster than mincing, anyway.  I will be making this again soon!

as a japanese-american who grew up eating home-cooked asian food, this is just okay. the sauce is heavy on the soy sauce and tastes like it. would probably be better with a little more flavor other than just soy sauce.

Great recipe.  I used rice vinegar like another viewer had stated and it turned out great.  Also, since it was the first picking of fresh snow peas from my garden, I added green pepper, onion and red pepper to bulk up the veggies.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I doubled the sauce (as recommended) and went heavy on the ginger root and garlic to ensure a good strong flavor.  Used better beef than called for based on prior reviews.  Wish I could give it 4.5 stars because it was really good but not the best I've ever had.

I used sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil, and powdered ginger in place of the fresh, and I added a bunch more snow peas and a bag of mixed veggies as well. This was amazing! I can't wait to make this again!

Wow!  It's rare I fix a dish with sauce that all 3 kids and  my husband like...the pickiest one even had seconds.  I did follow a couple of the reviews--doubled the sauce and added some orange juice.  This will show up on our table often.

simple and delicious. I make stir fry often, and this gave it a different flavor, for a nice change. I didn't have rice wine, so I used 1T of red wine vinegar and 1t of vinegar from jarred ginger. The sauce was enough for 3 people, which worked out great. I don't like a lot of sauce on stir frys, but if you have more people, you'll need to make more sauce, or if you just want left overs. I also used beef cubes, instead of strips.

I subbed white wine vinegar for rice wine.  It was horrible! ... I hate it when people review recipes low when they don't follow them ... but I just don't want anyone to make the same mistake ... for this recipe, it would be much better to skip the vinegar all together.

This recipe was good, but I think next time I'd add less soy sauce and more variety of veggies.  It was a little too salty.  I was also surprised this said it made four servings - maybe I went a little too heavy on the meat and peas (I eyeballed the measurements) but it seemed like 6 servings to me.  I did have it with rice though, so maybe that's why it went so much further.

This recipe was delicious!  I have made it before and it became one of my "stand-by" stirfry recipes for a quick weekday meal.  However, I had not made it in a while as I became a semi-vegetarian (I still eat chicken and turkey once in a while).  Last night, I made this with left over seitan (I made the Tasty Breaded Seitan from this site) and it was really good.  I just tried seitan (which is processed wheat gluten for those who don't know) for the first time last week.  Although it looked very unappetizing in the package, it was really good and tasted like beef.  I really liked it with this sauce from this recipe and with some sauteed onions, snow peas, and red and green bell pepper it was delicious!  This recipe will be a "stand by" once again with seitan!

Great flavor.  Need to use sirloin - I marinated the round steak and it was still a little tough.

I trippled the marinade, used one part to marinade the meat and the other two for the sauce. I also sauteed some sliced sweet onion and red pepper in a little vegetable oil to add to the beef and snow peas.

I used white cooking wine instead of the rice wine and omitted the cornstarch.  I also added fried red peppers and steamed broccoli.  Served over jasmine rice.  It turned out perfect.

I have had this recipe twice in the last fortnight and it has became a hit with the family. 
I followed the recipe with the exception of rice wine which was unavailable
I cooked some rice and additional vegies to make it a complete meal.

Doubled the sauce but next time will probably quadruple even.  Used rice vinegar and added 1 t. chili garlic sauce.  Only had dried ginger so used 2 t. of that.  Only had garlic powder so used 1 T. of that.  Had no snow peas so used what I had, 1 green pepper, 2 red peppers and 1 medium onion all cut in 1" pieces and added after the meat was browned.  Very versatile recipe, very easy and very good flavor!

This was a great recipe.  I was a bit iffy about it when it was done, as the sauce looked very very dark and therefore questionable as to whether or not it would taste good.  However, in the end it was quite delicious.
I used dark soy sauce for this, and the bottled minced ginger and minced garlic (so nothing fresh), and I added a bit more cornstarch mixed with water at the end before letting it simmer (because I like my sauces thicker).

We all loved this.  I have a 1 and 3 year old who ate every bite.  we made the sauce for 8 servings for the 4 of us and added water chestnuts.  YUM!  Other than that we did not change a thing.

This was very good.  I did not have rice wine, so I used 1 tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and a little extra brown sugar to balance the tartness.  I used the "stiry-fry" meat from the meat counter so it was already cut up and I bought bagged sugar snap peas (I meant to buy snow peas...).  It only took about 10 minutes to throw this together.  Delicous!  Next time I'll try it with the snow peas, although the sugar snap peas were great!

Really, really good.  I was looking at the last minute for a recipe that would accomodate the tenderized round steak my husband brought home for dinner. I thin sliced the steak against the grain.  I had to substitute 1/2 tsp ground ginger for the fresh and added with the minced garlic.  I used the opportunity to use all the veggies I could that were in my refrigerator veggie drawer(snow peas, broccali, cauliflower and carrots), and I had to 1 tsp Wondra instead of the 1/2 cornstarch because it was what I had on hand.  Great recipe to play around with, delicious and easy too.

Easy (I used the pre-cut beef strips instead of cutting my own) and tasted OK. I substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil and used a little extra soy sauce and garlic. Will make again, but I should probably add other vegetables (water chestnuts, etc).

This recipe has become a weekly regular at our house! It’s so easy and delicious! I didn’t have rice vinegar so I substituted semi-sweet sherry. Also, I added sliced mushrooms which really absorb the flavour. I serve it over rice noodles.

I marinated my beef in soy sauce and rice wine, with ginger, garlic and onion powders.  I used sugar snap peas, crimini mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts as veggies because that's what I had on hand.  I used Kikkoman Stir Fry Sauce at the end.  The result was a very tasty and fast meal which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Good recipe. I nice basic recipe for stir fry. I did as others stated and doubled the sauce mixture, but I found it was way to saucy for my taste. Next time I will just follow the recipe as is.

Excellent flavor.  I added sliced mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions to the vegetables for a bit of variety.  Doubled the sauce ingredients and added some Chinese 5-spice powder to the sauce.

This was soooo good!  And so easy!  My husband wasn't crazy about it, but he doesn't really like Asian food.  But he did say he wouldn't mind if I made it again.  So, see, he thought it was alright.  But I thought it was AWESOME!

The only thing I would change is to use a better quality cut of beef like sirlion.  But the flavor was very good and the recipe was extremely EASY!  The rice was done in 25 minutes and so was the meal.  It's not PF Chang's, but it's cheaper, faster, and not as bad for you either.

Maybe i misunderstood "rice wine" I used seasoned rice wine vinegar, and it was a bit too vinigary for me and I LOVE vinegar. 
If you either leave  that out or cut it in 1/2, good basic recipe. Also used green beans as that is what the garden is giving me right now.

Very good dinner! I didn't have any fresh ginger root so I used dried (or powdered...whatever you want to call it). I let the meat marinade for a couple hours first B4 cooking. Instead of snow peas, I used sliced red peppers, fresh sliced mushrooms and some fresh broccoli. Served over white rice and was well enjoyed. The meat was tender, slightly sweet and very flavorful! Thanks!

Fast, easy and a delicious dish! I thought I had Rice wine but I didn't so I subsituted white wine and it tasted great! I used stir fry beef, next time I might try a more tender cut. I think Chicken would be good with this too! It was a bit salty but we didn't mind. It might be better with low sodium soy sauce. Give this one a try! Thanks Holly for posting it!

This recipe is AWESOME!! I used ginger flavored soy instead of ginger root and switched up the vegeables a few times.  I will definitely be making it again.  My boyfriend loved it as well.

This one earned raves!  Even my wife, who's normally a picky eater, really enjoyed this one.  I suggest a good, tender cut of beef- ours was a little tough.

Great recipe although I did take  chef joys advice for double the ingredients. As this gives you more sauce to put with you’r rice

The suggestion of using a cast iron pot is excellent. I'll never use a stainless steel frying pan again for stir-fry. This recipe could have been really good except I found it way too salty, even with no added salt. I used Tamari soy sauce. Next time I will cut the soy sauce in half, and add a few spoons of water.

My family devoured this! Not a bite left for left overs. I followed the recipe exactly but followed another reviewers suggestion and doubled the sauce recipe. Perfect! I’m making it again tonight with broccoli instead of peas because it’s in season.

I found this delicious recipe in Allrecipes Magazine!  We loved it. We doubled the sauce recipe which I highly recommend and next time around we will add some water chestnuts. Excellent!

My only change is I initially cooked the snow peas on the side and then added them in with the rest of the dish because I like the snow peas to be cooked more. Otherwise, it's a great recipe!

This dish was excellent.  I used filet mignon and marinated it in the sherry/soy/brown sugar mixture for about an hour and then discarded it, so the meat was super tender.  I made another batch of the sherry/soy/brown sugar with the cornstarch for the thickening part of the recipe. I doubled the sauce.  I also added an onion for another veggie in the mix.   Snow peas should be barely cooked as they will continue to cook in the sauce when the meat is added back in.  Be careful or the snow peas will turn into limp noodles!  You could also use broccoli, asparagus, carrots, etc.  This was the best recipe I've made from AR in a really long time.  It's a keeper and I'll be making this on high rotation!! Thank you!!

This recipe is great tasting and very easy.  It is also very quick.  I have mad it with chick breast too and with mushrooms and with bamboo shoots or water chestnuts.  I use whatever is on hand and it turns out very good.

I didn't make any changes.   The  meat too chewy, &  not enough sauce. 
Round steak needs more time to tenderize.

We made this twice. First, I made this following the recipe exactly. We enjoyed the taste, though we wanted more sauce. With just the beef and snow pea pods, it worked okay for a light meal, but we felt it needed more it it was to be filling when we wanted it to be the major meal of our day. So the second time, following the suggestions of the owner of our neighborhood Chinese grocery, I added onion, finely sliced carrots and red pepper, and two varieties of mushrooms. She also confirmed it needed more sauce so I tripled that and served over steamed rice. The second version was even better as the flavors of the new ingredients seemed to compliment rather than overwhelmed  the blended flavor of the original version.

Quick and easy weeknight dinner. Most definitely double the sauce. I added orange peppers and used powdered ginger as it was all I had on hand. I also used seasoned precooked beef strips from the deli.

What's so good about stir fry's is, what ever vegetables your family enjoys seems to fit right in. Be sure to adjust the sauce if you add a lot of extra's.

My family loved this recipe! I'm vegan so I substituted the beef for Gardein beefless tips & added some additional vegetables & it was delicious.  The sauce was wonderful, though I would recommend doubling or tripling the recipe if you like to have extra for your rice.  Will definitely be a repeat dish in our house.

My husband, who is quite picky, really likes this one.  After reading the reviews, I, too, doubled the sauce and am glad I did. I added 1/2 tsp of crushed chili pepper to the sauce because we like our foods a bit hot. Also added a couple carrots, a red bell pepper, and scallions. 
Will make this again!

This is so flavorful and delicious!  To save even more time, you can use Minced Garlic Seasoning instead of actually chopping up garlic, and it tastes just as delicious!  We also couldn't find rice wine at our grocery store, so we skipped this, and couldn't even tell anything was missing.  We'll definitely make this again!

This was good as written and very adaptable.  I prefer to double the sauce, add a little onion and black pepper, and serve it over rice noodles.  It's great with a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if eaten with noodles.  Very simple sauce, which is great with the beef.

A wonderful recipe for a guy trying to impress his fiancee's family cooking for them. I have made this five or six times and twice I used pork instead of beef and its just as good! Play with meats in this its so good!

A good hint is to grate the ginger or drop it in a little blender. My future father-in-law, fiancée, and I were all startled to accidentally bite down on a mince of ginger here and there.

I followed this basic recipe with some changes. The sauce was not enough for this recipe, and was not flavorful enough for my taste. I had to embellish it.  I added a lot more soy sauce, corn starch, teriyaki sauce and I also added Tonton brand Hibachi steak sauce. This gives the sauce a good flavor.
I didn't have the rice wine, so I added a fine drinking sherry(not cooking sherry), and honey for sweetness. I added more veggies: sliced onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts and broccoli. The picture shows mushrooms in the dish, however does not specify it in the ingredients. Instead of the vegetable oil (which I do not use), I substituted it with sesame oil, which adds so much flavor.
I guess I did add and change up the recipe to my taste, but everyone's taste is different, so often times the recipe 
may need tweaking to one's liking.

Loved this!! I did double the recipe because of the size of my family, added sliced bell pepper, baby corn and cubed chicken. This was a hit in my home. It would be perfect for the serving size. This is going to be an addition to week nights.

I thought this was really good.  I had to substitute the vegetable since my store didn't have snow peas!  I used a frozen bag that had snow peas in it.  I want to try again following the recipe exactly.  It was tasty.

Great recipe! I scaled it down to make one serving. Added some sliced baby bella mushrooms and onions. I added about a teaspoon of sesame dressing to the sauce too. Turned out great!! I don't know why people complain about other people giving their suggestions on a recipe in the reviews. That is my favorite part about allrecipes. I look for  similar suggestions and follow them.

This recipe was easy and tasted great! I don't consider myself to be a great cook but the recipe was simple and the dish came out nicely. I didn't use round steak but can't remember what it was. The butcher recommended it to me saying it was a steak to use in a stir fri. I also added sliced mushrooms to it. My only complaint is that my sauce never thickened in the end. It could be something I did, like I said I don't consider myself a chef. The dish still tasted great and I served it over brown rice. Next time I make this I will double the sauce like other reviewers have suggested.

Amazing and easy! I subbed in Red Wine vinegar for the Rice vinegar as I could not find any rice wine/rice wine vinegar at our local store.

Fabulous! Added to my collection of favorites :)

This is a wonderful recipe!  The only thing I adapted was I used 8 oz. of beef tenderloin tips (from Omaha Steaks), Gourmet Garden's Ginger Paste, which is made from fresh ginger,(found in the produce section, as my store did not have fresh ginger), 3 oz. of snow peas, and regular sherry for the rice wine. This was perfect for the two of us.  With more meat, I can see why many suggested doubling the sauce ingredients, which is so tasty! I served this with rice.  This was ready in 15 minutes (start the rice earlier) start to finish. This recipe was in the preview issue of the new magazine and is as colorful as pictured. Looking forward to the first issue in my mailbox.

Yes indeedie, this one's a keeper.  Fam and those alike enjoy as well.  Double the sauce due to i wanted to add more of variety of veggies in additions to the snow peas: red & green peppers, red onions, brocolli, & mushrooms.  And i did jazz up my brown rice by turning it into ginger fried rice with a little fresh ginger, fresh minced garlic, sprouts and a dab of soy sauce and little course pepper. Your definately getting your vegetable and protein in this dish. The boom.com!

I added mushrooms and green and red peppers, and made about 2.5x the sauce (I like my stir-fries a bit on the saucy side). Easy and delicious. Will be making this one again.

The sauce wasn't enough for the ingredients which kind of ruined the dish for me.  It was more of a glaze...just enough to cover the meat and peas but not get on the rice.

This recipe is great for your basic stir fry sauce. I didn't use snow peas but instead, bean sprouts, peppers (red, yellow & green), water chestnuts, and onions. For the soy sauce mixture I didn't have rice wine so instead I used 1 tbs of rice vinegar and 1 tbs of cooking wine and it was wine. It was great!

Made this last night and between me, my hubby and 12 year old son we ate it all! Pretty much followed exact recipe.  Only I doubled the sauce (suggested by another user) which was perfect cause we like it more saucey then dry. And I added some other veggies like red pepper slices, and Zucchini,along with snow peas and that was awesome! We served over brown rice and it was amazingly good!  Only other thing is to really be carefull to not overcook meat...it cooks fast, ours came out a little overdone so we will adjust next time..this one is going into our rotation!

One of my husband's favorite dishes. This is yummy. I always double the sauce and tend to put more meat than it calls for. I also add mushrooms, cause why not! Serve with rice & sriracha.

This recipe has great flavor as is. The only thing I will so next time is tenderize the meat or cook it for less time. The meat really only needs a total of 2 minutes instead of 5. My meat was pretty thin so it depends.  Served it over brown rice. I doubled the sauce as suggested and I definitely reccommend that.

Working with what I had, I used asparagus, carrots, ground ginger instead of fresh minced, and red wine vinegar instead of rice wine.  It was easy to make and I had high hopes for it, but the flavors were just really off to me; my husband didn't like it either.  The meat was perfectly tender, though.

Wow...I am IN LOVE with this dish! The ginger sauce has a classic flavor, not too strong, but not too weak. I doubled the sauce since my hubby likes extra on his rice and I didn't use fresh ginger root because I didn't have time to go to a bunch of grocery stores looking for it. I used regular ground ginger instead and it was still good. This is not a spicy dish, so it's very kid-friendly. I have a five-year-old and three-year-old twins who gave it two thumbs up. Definitely a keeper!

This was my first attempt at stir fry and it was really good!  I accidentally used rice wine vinegar instead of rice wine but I liked the slight vinegar flavor.  I also used ground ginger instead of fresh because that's all I had.  I cooked the meat and peas less time than suggested before adding the sauce and the meat was still a tad over cooked for me so I think the time can be played with based on your taste.  Over all this receipe was SUPER fast and easy and it tasted great!  Will def make this again, especially when I'm looking for an easy weeknight meal.

Make sure to double the sauce, and take steps to thicken the glaze if it doesn't do it itself.

pretty good! I added sliced peppers (green, yellow, red) and a mix of stir fry veggies (snow peas, onions, mushrooms). Make sure you double the amount of sauce.

Was a good recipe. I don't personally like peas too much, which is the reason for the lower star. My husband likes them and enjoyed the dish. I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the "sauce".

This was SOOOO good, and easy!

Couldn't find rice wine at the store, but learned that gin is an acceptable substitute, and it worked great.  Used lots of garlic (5 large cloves), and served with steamed carrots.  I'll definitely be making this again, and may try broccoli and/or mushrooms next time.

Delicious. I added mushroom and doubled the sauce as suggested. I served with brown rice. Next time I will add snow peas or even try different vegetables!! We live about an hour from a Chinese restaurant so I know this will be made a couple of times a month in our house.

For those that think the sauce is a little bland, try this variation:  I doubled the sauce, you always need more sauce!  I used golden mountain sauce as well as soy.  I used rice vinegar..I actually don't know what rice wine is, I think the recipe is actually calling for rice wine vinegar.  I used palm sugar instead of brown.  All these ingredients can be found at your local Asian market.  It makes for much better flavor than the usual and doesn't change the original recipe too much.   I used bok choy, shallots, red peppers, carrots, celery, green onions as well as the beef (flank steak).  You can toss in any veggies that you have.  Poured it all over white rice.  Yummy!

this is  the best recipe I have tried so far.I ended up tripling the liquids and it turned out really great. Also, I let the meat simmer for about 1/2 hour before adding the vegtables. I used pork because I didn't have beef on hand and it worked perfectly.I imagine it would be really good with chicken too!

Pretty good-I added some extra veggies, so I tripled the sauce and it was actually too much sauce.  I will only double it next time and will also add more cornstarch, as it did not get as thick as I was hoping for.  Great taste though--I will probably make this again.

I thought this is very good!! It had a very sweet taste. Maybe because i didn't have rice wine so i used white cooking wine instead as some of the reviews said was alright. I kind of wish i would had gotten a better steak and cut it in thinner strips. (this was my fault!). So i will be making this again, but will cut in thinner strips and use a better cut of steak. Very good taste....yum!

I doubled the recipe and used 3 tbsp. Oyster sauce and 3 tbsp. soy sauce and added Broccoli,baby bello mushrooms and the snow peas.  The meat was a little bit tough so next time i would use a better grade of beef and also, add chicken and shrimp and marinate the meat before cooking.  Otherwise this was a very tasty dish.

Very yummy. My kids liked it, too. I didn't have rice wine so I used sherry wine. Everything else I did exactly as the recipe says. I've served it over white rice and brown rice.

Awesome!  All 5 of us loved it, and the youngest is only 7 yrs old.  Marinated steak in the sauce all day, then pulled it out and sliced it, added the cornstarch to the marinade, and proceeded to prepare the meal as instructed.  We also added broccoli and bell pepper from the garden.

very tasty and easy dish! I liked how easy this was to put the ingredients together. The soy sauce mixture was easy to put together. I added 4 ounce fresh snow peas to the thin sliced beef after stir frying for 2 minutes. I also added sliced water chestnuts for texture. What I really liked about this dish was that the sauce easily thickened up nicely after pouring into the skillet with the beef and vegetables. The cooking time is approximate. Also, I did not need to add additional seasonings to the soy sauce, was good as is. Loved the gingery taste with the vegetables. you can certainly add other fresh vegetables to this dish as well like mushrooms, red bell pepper, etc. I served this dish with hot rice and, "Restaurant Style Egg Drop Soup," also from this website. Thank you for sharing this tasty and wonderful dish!

This recipe was very good.  I doubled the sauce and also added sliced carrots and water chestnuts to the recipe.  This will be a recipe that we will make again.  Leftovers for lunch were very good too.

This is my go-to recipe whenever I make beef stir-fry! I doubled the sauce mixture (to have over rice) and found that the amount of vinegar was just too much for my taste so instead of 4 tbs I added only 2 tbs. I also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce too and it turns out awesome.

I couldn't find rice wine so, per one of the reviewers here, used rice wine vinegar. I think it ruined this meal--plus my snow peas were old and chewy. I doubt if there will be a next time, but if I were to do it over, I'd buy frozen snow peas.

I doubled the sauce, added red peppers and carrots. I couldn't find any rice wine, so I used a dry white wine instead. It was a very good stir fry recipe. Nothing spectacular and not something I would order from a Chinese restaurant, but good for something homemade.

The flavor was good, not great, still missing something. The sauce wasn't enough so I would suggest doubling it. I did add a japanese mix frozen vegetables to this along with the snow peas.

This was so good! I subbed cooking sherry for rice wine and the sauce flavor was still great. I had read the other reviews, so I doubled the sauce ingredients, which was perfect since I served this over rice. I added red peppers and it was all delicious. I do recommend using a big pan/skillet as my average size skillet barely fit it all. I may need to buy a wok now:)

This was yummy, and such a nice way to cook beef!  My husband loves steak, but always wants it cooked the same way.  Tried this last night and he is a fan!  Threw some water chestnuts in as well, and used sesame oil for a little more flavor.  Great over brown rice, and really filling!  I am hoping the leftovers will be even yummier today!

This was good but not great. It didn't really pop in anyway. I would recommend using sesame oil instead of vegetable oil to anyone making this. I had sprinkled some toasted sesame seeds on top and found that it added much more flavor so I can only imagine that using sesame oil would greatly improve this. I also think this would have been better with a little kick like chili peppers.

We liked this.  I had to use rice wine vinager, so I added a bit more brown sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe. If you cut the meat against the grain it will be more tender. I used top round and it was fine.  Wished I had rice wine. I will pick some up at the store for next time. My 2 year old said it was "disgusting" but managed to eat two servings of it. All of us enjoyed it.

Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  We did what everyone else said and doubled the sauce, added a yellow pepper, and used one extra tablespoon of brown sugar and it was a hit and so quick to make!

Believe it or not but I have had this in my recipe box since 2006 and had not made it until now. Big mistake on my part. This was so good and my mouth is still enjoying the flavors an hour later. I did use tender pork cutlets that I sliced thin instead of the beef and also put in red and yellow sliced peppers with it. It was pretty to look at and a great combination.  I used minced garlic (in a jar) instead of the fresh ginger root.  The flavors were just delightful and I can't wait to make it again.

I was excited about finally cooking stir fry from a proven recipe instead of just throwing things together last second.  Sadly I was disappointed with the flavor of the meat and veggies.  It tasted just like the premade frozen meal to me.  Had to use a lot of soy sauce to get some flavor out of it...  One of the few times my ratings have disagreed with the average - maybe I will try again soon.

So I followed the recipe exactly, while everyone liked it here are some things I noticed.  First off, my sauce hardly thickened.  :( That aside the flavor was tasty enough to not make my 5 year old turn her nose in the air(no easy trick!)  Also I would recommend  doubling the sauce to avoid the dryness lots of others experienced.  This recipe is super forgiving and will accomodate just about any veggie!  Sky is definitely the limit so let your imagination run with this one.  Finally, I think that it is totally worth looking for rice wine.  I had never bought it before so imagine my surprise to see it's sold in single serving sizes in your groceries trusty sushi display.  Gotta luv these times!!

Excellent! I tripled the sauce, and used flour instead of cornstarch for thickening. Served over plain white rice, thus the need for extra sauce. It was delicious! For the wine, I find the key is to use a wine you would drink. I used a decent, though cheap, red wine, and it couldn't have turned out better. This is a near-weekly recipe now!

This was so so good, and simple to make.  The only things that I changed were to use green peppers instead of the peas, and ground ginger instead of fresh, because that was all that I had.  The whole family loved it.  My two year old even had seconds, which doesnt happen often around here.  I cant wait to try it with the snow peas!

My 7yr old daughter liked this recipe so much, she asked if we could have it two days in a row! I took others' suggestions and doubled the sauce recipe, and I'm glad that I did so. I also added green and red peppers. It was very good.

I make this at least once a month -- easy and tasty. I used to buy meat that was pre-sliced for stir-fries but found that it came out really tough. So now I buy a better cut of beef in larger pieces (like a steak for grilling) and slice it myself. Works great! Also, I usually add broccoli or asparagus, or use only the broccoli/asparagus if that's all I have in my fridge.

A very delicious meal, especially with the modifications I made. As opposed to just snow peas, I added sliced mushrooms and chopped onions and (fresh) basil. In the soy mixture, I also added some srichicha "rooster" hot sauce and red pepper flakes. Subbed white cooking wine because my supermarket did not have rice wine. I did run into one problem tho: Perhaps because I just washed the mushrooms (which can retain a ton of water), I had a lot of water, making the stir fry more of a boil. I had to spoon it out several times, and the cook time was much longer. In order to keep the flavor tho I held on to this extra liquid (which was a bit of a beef/garlic/ginger/veggie broth) and added it with the sauce at the end. I had to use quite a bit more corn starch, but it still turned out really great. Highly recommended.

Usually I really like the recipes that I find on here.  However, this one didn't work out.  For some reason I couldn't get the sauce to thicken and the taste wasn't that appealing.  It was somewhere between bitter and off tasting.  My husband and I ended up just eating the rice and egg rolls I made to go with it.  The rest ended up in the garbage.

This is a delicious recipe, especially for being relatively simple. As a veggie lover, I added bell peppers, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots which worked well. Quality meat and making sure the snow peas still have a crunch are key.

Great base. I think it depends a lot on the soy you use - next time around I'll try using a lighter sauce or at least a low sodium one, cos it was a little on the salty side. But ! The texture was great, and so easy to make, and really nice tasting.  Instead of snow beans I used green beans, broccoli, green capsicum, shallots and tofu. Also threw in some cashews which I think was a very nice touch. Goes great over noodles. Thanks :)

I doubled the sauce and used sesame oil instead of seeds.  Very yummy.  I marinated half my round steak sliced and half in a slab.  Cooked them both and everyone liked the pre-sliced marinated steak a little better.  The recipe is definitely a keeper!  Sauteed sliced steak with onions.

I marinated the beef for about 2 hours in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil and chili/garlic sriracha, then followed the recipe. Talk about quick and easy! Served it over brown rice with a couple of store-bought egg rolls. Not bad at all. Thanks!

I doubled the sauce but ended up not needing to.  I also didn't have ginger or Rice wine and used green beans.  Also, I should have used more sugar, but the sauce was good.

This works best if you cook it in a wok, but if you can't do that...make sure that your pan is HOT before you add any oil (and then food)...that should help prevent burning. Another tip is to always let oil slide down the side of the pan/wok to avoid splattering. Also it's so important to make sure that your beef is sliced THINLY. Absolutely double the sauce recipe!

My fiance and I loved this recipe. My only problem was there wasn't enough sauce. I did double it like others said to do, and also added a tbsp of worchestershire sauce, but it wasn't enough for us! I think I may even double it again! We like our veggies and rice smothered in sauce as well. It's a great, easy recipe, that can be changed up with whatever vegetables you ahve on hand, or switch out rice for thai or egg noodles. Will definately be making this many times in the future.

I doubled the sauce and tripled the garlic. Used sesame oil instead of the regular veg. oil. Threw in a bunch of frozen veggies and they cooked up in the pan. Yum. Made this two days in a row and will make again. Its so simple and cheap!
I have made this again and tripled the sauce because I had a lot of meat. Made the marinade without the cornstarch and added in the juice from a mandarin. Cooked the snow peas separately and heated up much cast iron until it was super hot to cook up the meat. I cooked down the marinade and added just a small amount of cornstarch to thicken it. Possibly one of the best foods I’ve ever eaten.

Delicious as is.  I liked it so much I mixed extra sauce and froze as cubes. Now I just toss some cubes into the meat and veggies for a very fast meal. Even faster to cook and freeze all ingredients and add the sauce while reheating in a skillet or even the microwave.  Great dish.

Oh, this was good!  I made a couple minor changes out of necessity:  I doubled the sauce (personal preference), used dry white wine instead of the rice wine, and threw in some red bell pepper strips.  The sauce was good but a tad salty.  next time I'll used low sodium soy sauce.  I did throw in some extra cornstarch to make a thicker sauce.  The flavors were good together, and I think this sauce could be versatile with different meats and veggies.  Will go into my regular rotation for sure!

Didn't like it at all. I think it's the vinegar component of the sauce. I have rated the recipe as written. However, I will warn you that I added mushrooms and do not recommended them, as they soaked up a lot of the vinegar and tasted very strongly of vinegar. As with another reader, my sauce did not thicken. My 2 yr old wouldn't eat it. I hope I can get him to try them again in the future.

Excellent!  I used 1 TB chopped garlic & about 1/2 TBSP of ginger (no ginger root).  I doubled the sauce by doubling the amt.of soy sauce, cornstarch, brown sugar, and I used rice vineger i/o rice wine - only 2 TBS rice vineger though & 1 TBSP water.  I used pre-cut stir fry beef from the store. I/O the snowpeas, I used fresh green beans which I cleaned, snapped, and blanched for 3 minutes before adding it into the meat w/the sauce.
YUM.

I was looking for something quick(still wondering what to make at 6:15pm).  I pulled some round steaks out of the fridge and found this recipe.  I served this with ramen noodles.  We were eating before 7.  We love this recipe!

I have made this many times now.  I use reduced sodium soy sauce because my husband sholdn't have full strength due to heart trouble.  I love the taste of this myself eventhough I am not a fan of soy sauce.  I now make this atleast once a week and am making it for family dinner night this week.

This was SOOOO good!  I added veggies (red bell pepper and sliced water chestnuts) but kept everything else the same.  My husband thought it was one of the best dishes I've ever made.  Cooking this will make you wonder why you ever go out for Chinese!

This recipe was just AWESOME. I cooked it to the letter but doubled the sauce because I wanted to make sure enough of it mixed with the rice, and I must say it was unbelievably good. Great flavor, the boyfriend loved it, and it's quickly becoming one of our favorite dishes. I definitely recommend it for beginning cooks (like me) - it was simple and fabulous!

This recipe is great. I used rice wine vinegar instead of rice wine (because it's all I had) and it turned out wonderful. Definately double or triple the sauce. The second time I made this I added broccoli as well, and it turned out well.

Absolutely delicious!  Both my wife and I loved it.  The only substitution I made was using seasoned rice vinegar instead of rice wine (since I didn't have any).  Since I substituted, I only used 1 Tablespoon instead of 2.  Otherwise, I made it according to recipe.

This was a nice quick evening meal, and it tasted good - but wasn't out of this world by any means.  I added a can of water chestnuts, a bag of Hong Kong Stir-fry veggies (snow peas, carrots, broccoli, onions)in place of the snow peas alone.  I also threw in 1 red pepper sliced.  I doubled the sauce and used red wine vinegar in place of the rice wine, which my grocer didn't have.  I served it over brown rice, for a filling, delicious meal.  I will make this again for a night when I'm tight on time.  I bought Chow Mein noodles to go on top - but forgot to serve them!  It was great even without them.

Great recipe! I've used this recipe several times. One change I make is instead of round steak I use top sirloin or tri tip steak. I tried it with the round steak and the meat was very tough. I use whatever stir fry vegetables I have on hand.

I would double or even triple the sauce.  Also, the key to this dish is the rice wine.  In Austin, the only rice wine I found was mirin.  Please not that there are different types.  Do not confuse Rice Wine with Rice Wine Vinegar.  Thay are 2 seperate things.  And yes, this recipe is great and healthy.  My only change was to add red pepper flakes.

I don't used any kind of alcohol in my cooking, so I subbed asian salad dressing for the wine.

Incredible recipe!  I doubled the sauce per other reviews I read, and it was perfect!  I could not find the rice wine in the grocery store, so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of rice wine vinegar, which gave it a good flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This may be a good basic stir fry recipe but with just beef and snow peas it was really lacking.  If I try iti again I will add carrots, mushrooms, water chesnuts, cashews and baby corn.

My boyfriend and I both loved it! We didn't have rice wine so had to do without. We also added water chestnuts, red bell peppers and baby corn. Without the extra veggies it would've been bland. We served it over brown rice and made even better leftovers.

Pretty good but still missing something.  I doubled the sauce, added 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, a 1/4 tsp. hot pepper flakes, used sesame oil and  didn't double the sugar.  I also added a ton of veggies including onion, mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, carrots red and green peppers, pea pods and bean sprouts. Next time I'll add one more Tbsp. of rice vinegar and double the sugar for the double recipe.  Great start.

This is excellent just as is. The only criticism is that the round steak turned out a bit chewy even with it very thinly sliced. Maybe I will try a different cut of meat next time or tenderize it before hand.

My sauce was a little thin, so I needed to add more corn starch.  Make sure if you do add more that you dissolve it in the smallest amount of water first.  I think my sauce was so thin because the beef let off so much water.

Very good!  If you are new at stir fry cooking like I am, be careful of your choice of beef and watch your cook time.  Mine was tough but I'm sure it was because I overcooked a poor cut.

We made this once, and it was pretty good, and then I realized something....

This sauce tastes like the SAME SAUCE for Beef and Broccoli. In fact, we're cooking it right now. Delicious!!! Beef, Broccoli, Carrots, and some Green Onions. Everything else is kept the same, the Ginger and Garlic....

::EDIT::
Also, if you're making this in a skillet, which most of us are...

It helps to drain the beef. BE SURE NOT TO LET ALL YOUR GINGER AND GARLIC GO! Using the lid from a smaller skillet and trapping all your ingredients under it is a big help. CHOW DOWN PEOPLES!

This recipe is pretty good, although I felt like it was missing something ir wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.  I'll probably try this again and add some hoisin and oyster sauce.

The photo I saw showed what looked like sliced red peppers on top.  It made a nice color blend with the white rice, green snow peas, red peppers, an browned meat.   An attractive  presentation.  I prefer oil above all for cooking, butter will burn very quickly and change the flavor.  For a serving of 4 it might be a good idea to suggest how many cups of rice to use.  Mushrooms, water cresents, pecans and chow mein noodles make the servings go farther, goog ideas.

This was simple and delicious.  I have been cutting back on calories so I have had to broaden my recipie range.  This one made the CUT.  Put it on top of some brown rice and even Wolfgang didn't know it was healthy.

My husband and I loved this dish! It is so good. I actually didn't put any ginger in and added more cornstarch to make the sauce thicker at the end. Also, I drained some of the juice from the meat before I added the peas. This recipe is very versatile, make it your own and add onions, red peppers, or even use chicken!

This is a keeper.

I'm sorry, I did not like this at all. All I could taste was garlic. That is my fault, though. I tripled the sauce & didn't see that you cook the garlic & ginger in the skillet, its not in the sauce. I tripled the other ingredients but only doubled the garlic & it was so garlicky. Please don't make the mistake I did. I used 16 oz pkg stir fry veg & served over rice. I couldn't finish it. My husband said it was ok, he didn't give a good reaction. I might consider making this again but making sure to follow the directions more closely. Cutting the beef isn't included in the prep time make sure to allow time for that. Thanks anyways.

Great, fast recipe with tons of authentic Asian flavor. The grocery store was out of snow peas so we subsituted green bell pepper, bamboo shoots, button mushrooms, crimini mushrooms, and green onion. Tripled the sauce and served over white rice. Delicious!

This was wonderful and simple to make.  I used striploin, broccoli, mushrooms and green onions with a touch of sesame oil in the pan, and made the sauce exactly as directed et Voila!  on a bed of rice it was the perfect meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe: simple, fast, and tasty.  My friend enjoyed it as well.  I would strongly suggest quadrupling (sp?) or multiplying the recipe by at least 3 if you love sauces as much as I do.  Trust me.  I doubled the sauces ingredients, and it was not enough.  A few other tips: can't find the peas in the store?  Don't hesitate to use the stir fry mix.  MAke sure to double the sauce though.  Also, I chose to add more color and taste: I added red and green bell peppers, and a little more ginger. Have fun.

This was an easy dish to make. It just wasn't saucy enough and bland in flavor.
I think doubling the sauce and adding more vegetables might help this dish.It needs more flavor.

This was so good.  The last two Asian recipes I tried were very bland and lacking in any flavor, but this recipe, with a few additions, had great flavor.  I used sesame oil instead of vegetable and added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Fresh ginger and fresh pea pods are essential.  Also, I would suggest using sirloin instead of round steak.  Baby carrots and red pepper added color.

This was really good.  I'm always worrying about trying new recipes.  I didn't have any snow peas so I used some broccoli instead.  Also, I didn't have any rice wine so I used rice wine vinegar and doubled the sauce and left out the doubled rice wine vinegar.  I did as others had done and used sesame oil in my wok.  Very yummy and the left overs are good too.

Definetely enjoyed this! The round steak was a really nice choice, and I did make sure to cut it very thinly. I used snap peas instead of snow peas and put it over jasmine rice. I wish I had doubled the sauce... just not enough, and a little dry.

OK, but pretty bland.  My husband makes a beef  pea pod that has more flavor  sauce to put over the rice.  I'll let my hubby make his throw together recipe instead of doing this again.

Very tasty! Very easy! I added mushrooms to the mix. For serving over rice, I'd probably double the sauce ingredients to make extra broth (which unfortunately ups the carbs). Thanks for posting this one!

I have made this several times--easy-quick--not many ingredients! And it tastes Chinese.
I did use 1 T. mirin and 1 T. rice wine vinegar.
Also doubled the amount of cornstarch. 
Cutting the beef partially frozen is easier--but you all know that trick!

I should have known better than to use round steak.     Very tough.  I marinated the meat for 2 hours in the sauce which helped with the flavor.  Very easy and quick but we won't making again.

Not bad! Though I had made several substitutions with what I had around the kitchen (replaced the rice wine with Cinzano, added red peppers, onions, and julienned carrots, and doubled the ginger.) Served over rice it's a great meal!

This was a delicious and very quick recipe to prepare for a busy weeknight.  I added bean sprouts to mine along with the snow peas and it was fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

This was very tasty. We marinated the thin beef strips for about 30 min and added broccoli and cauliflower instead of the snow peas. Highly recommended.

Although this turned out pretty well, I altered the recipe the second time making it.  Since snow peas generally don't look to good at the market, I substituted broccoli.  I do not like the taste of ginger too much, so I eliminated that altogether.  I added sesame seeds and more garlic.

This had very little flavor and the meat was horribly tough.  I basically followed the recipe except that I used sirloin thinking it would be more tender than round, not so.

Love to cook always looking for new ideas my family is picky . You guys this is really good. The sauce ingredients are perfection. This is a great quick dinner for every night. We absolutely love it !!! though, I did add a little change just because I grew up eating Asian food in the end I sprinkle a little bit of sesame seeds ( roasted) and it was fantastic just that sesame crunch yumm 
Next time I think I will do a little trick from what I learned from Korean cooking. simple tenderizing the meat. It will soak all yummy juices and I think it’s a bit softer to a bite  and so much juicer and has more flavor to it. Ginger garlic fantastic Sauce.

Really good. This is a great recipe to use up leftover Veges and meat. First I sautéd julienned carrots, celery cut diagonally, doubled ginger and garlic.  Then I added 1 tsp. sesame oil, cooked broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus and pork rib meat. Doubled the sauce and used 1Tbs sherry because I did not have any rice wine. Served it over lo mein noodles. Family loved it and like I said a great way to use up leftovers.

Fantastic! I did marinate the steak, while I was prepping, in an egg white, salt, pepper, corn starch and vegetable oil as I had seen videos of Chinese restaurant chefs doing this. It gave the meat a fantastic coating when it grilled up. I used Mirin (sweetened saki) for the rice wine. I added 2tbs oyster sauce and a splash of sesame oil to the wok just before adding the sauce mixture which I had doubled. Delicious. Sweet.  My family loved it and everyone came back for seconds.

Definitely liked this recipe! As others did, I  increased the sauce by 1 and 1/2 times the recipe, which made enough to cover our rice well. Also added sliced fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced red and yellow peppers and about 1/4 of a thinly sliced zucchini. Love the fact that the flavors melded well, the calorie count was low and the taste yummy. Thank you!

I took the advice by another person and doubled the "sauce" part of it. I did add red peppers, mushrooms, green onion (at the end) and water chestnuts. Also added some hoisen sauce and a touch of chili garlic sauce. I thought it came  out great and would make this again :)

Fabulous base recipe!  Mirin is a must, cut back on the brown sugar, added some grated garlic & ginger to the sauce using about 1/3-1/2 as a marinade for the meat (flank steak) for about an hour...the meat literally melted in our mouths. I prefer peanut oil for high temps on a wok....used an array of veggies cooked in order of density.  Great staple sauce for our stir fry adventures, thanks!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! We do have to change one slight detail and use broccoli instead, but I'm sure it would taste great with snow peas! the sauce is fantastic! I tend to double the sauce because I like to pour it all over my rice. 

Just be careful! The beef is really easy to overcook!

This was great. I doubled the sauce and boiled the pea pods for five mins and added them at the end as I like them softer. I also added some mushrooms and green onions.

Very good! Doubled the recipe and I had to substitute the rice wine with white cooking wine but it was still delicious. I will definitely make this again with the rice wine.

Update! Made it again but this time with rice wine and it was even better! I also used flank steak instead of stir fry meat. This one’s a keeper!

This was very good.  As others suggested, I doubled the sauce.  For vegetables, I used mushrooms, snowpeas, and red bell pepper.  Also, substituted white wine for rice wine.  Will definitely make this again.

Kids liked it. I thought it was bland. Simple and quick. Double sauce, let meat sit in salt and rinse if you do not have the right cut.  Add any veggies on hand. Easy weeknight meal.

This is the meal I remember as a small child eating at the neighborhood Chinese restaurant with my Mom and Dad. Have looked for years for a recipe that matched what I tasted at 4 years old. So happy to have found this! I didn't change a thing. It's exactly what I remember.

This was pretty tasty. Next time I would double the soy sauce recipe as it really wasn't enough sauce per serving. I would also add at least another 1/2 TB of minced ginger. I roasted some sesame seeds to top the dish & served pickled red onion on the side. I will make this again with my suggestions .

Yum! I did marinate the beef in the sauce ingredients (minus the cornstarch) for half an hour first, removed the beef then added the cornstarch and cooked as directed. A nice quick and easy lunch served with noodles. Will make again.

I made this into a vegan recipe using tofu.  I fried the tofu first in oil, then set aside to keep warm.  I sauteed the garlic and ginger and made the sauce as written.  Then added back the tofu to coat.  Vegan daughter loves this.

So the flavor of the above recipe is good. I swapped out the rice wine for mirin because that's what I had on hand and it worked out just fine.

My issue was with the sauce, specifically that there wasn't enough of it. On round two I'm going to add in some beef broth and up the corn starch, mirin, and brown sugar a little bit then reduce it down some. That way there is enough sauce to coat my rice, which I'm a big fan of. If you like light sauce though, follow the recipe as is and you won't go wrong.

I enjoyed this recipe greatly. I served it with 1/2 cup of rice per serving and found the recipe made ample sauce- if serving with more rice I could see how more sauce would be needed as in other comments. I had no fresh ginger so I used 1 teaspoon of ground dry- it was well liked and enjoyed. I plan to keep frozen grated fresh ginger in the future for this and other recipes. Fresher is better...but in a pinch...

To make a world of difference “velvet” the meat. The simplest way to do this is to mix 1teaspoon baking soda with 1tablespoon water, mix and coat meat. Let sit for about 5 - 10 minutes before stir frying. It seems like a small amount but it’s great.

Doubled the sauce, and added three green onions, but otherwise followed the recipe. Turned out great.

I added more vegetables, as suggested: carrot, mushrooms and shitake. I fried and steak on high heat (medium rare) and then cut it into slices and put it on top of the dish. We loved it.

Wonderful!! Even my kids loved it. I accidentally bought red wine vinegar instead of rice wine, so I used it and doubled my brown sugar. I also added an onion and fried with the garlic, ginger and added some lemon grass pulp (In a jar from grocery store)

Made recipe as is, using low sodium soy sauce.  Way too salty.  Could be good by changing some ingredients, but then I wouldn't be rating this recipe.

I used sirloin as it's so much cheaper and also far more tender. I also added 8 oz. of mushrooms as the snow peas wouldn't be enough for the three of us. After the beef had browned I removed it from the pan and proceeded with the veggies, I didn't want to overcook the meat. I returned it to the pan after the veggies were cooked and before adding the liquid. I probably won't make this again as it was a little overpowering.

I made Pork and snow pea instead.  I had to make it gluten free.  So I tried it with rice wine vinegar  - I wasn't sure if rice wine was gluten free - it came out too vinegary so I would lighten up on the rice wine vinegar.  Instead of cornstarch I used arrowroot powder - I should have used more than 1 tsp.  I ended up using a gluten free 1 to 1 flour to thicken the sauce instead.  It came out great!

Browned the round steak then added some onion and minced garlic. I doubled the sauce and combined half of it with the meat and spices in a crock pot. Cooked about four hours on medium heat and added the snow peas, carrots, and green pepper along with a little more sliced onion about 15 minutes before plating time.  Just before serving I added the sauce with a little extra corn starch to thicken.  The sauce and seasoning is everything.  It was very tasty, and I will fix again. I'm just not certain it was the absolutely best I have ever had; hence the four star rating.

I make changes so not a true review.  I used New York strip steak because I know round steak would be tough. I add some mushroom just because I had some.  I also add 1/2 c of water to the sauce to make more of it.  Was very good

Quadrupled the sauce and used frozen stir fry veggies. I found it a bit too tangy, so I added pineapple bits. It wasn't until I went to review this recipe that I realized I used rice wine vinegar instead of rice wine. Whoops! I actually would make it exactly the same but reduce the vinegar I used by half. Sauce thickened nicely . Very easy recipe. I'll definitely make it again, maybe with rice wine next time!

To Chucks comment about the beef being a bit tough. Try whipping some egg whites to a foam and mix with the beef. Let sit for 5 minutes before stir frying.
The egg whites will naturally tenderize the meat. Works great on chicken also.

I spend hours on this site every week, and I come here everyday. So, I am a fan! But I wish the pictures would match up with the recipes. The picture of this recipe shows red peppers zucchini, and mushrooms in it, over a bed of rice. The recipe has NONE of those ingredients.

This happens a LOT at this site. Better editing is much needed.

I thought to try someone else's version of beef & snow peas, just because.  I will Definitely stick with my own style! Yummy!!!

My husband and I loved it. I doubled the sauce as recommended. I used apple cider vinegar instead of what the recipe stated. Seasoned the meat lightly as it was browning. I added broccoli, onion, red bell pepper and snow peas.

Based on other reviews, I added sliced mushrooms & onions. I wasn't thrilled with the flavor of the sauce finding it more vinegary than sweet but overall the dish worked, was easy & my husband liked it. I used low salt soy sauce so that may have changed the flavor.  Overall, it was okay.

Really good recipe with the sauce needing to be tasted and possibly adjusted based on your taste buds. My wife and grandkids lived it

Like others, I doctored the recipe a bit to suit the family.  I used Mirin which is an Asian sweet seasoning that is alcohol based vice the Rice Wine which I also couldn't find in the local stores.  Mirin was a bit sweet so in the future I'll use a tad bit less brown sugar or add something to spice it up a bit.  I also added frozen stir fry veggies which many others did.  Instead of doubling the sauce I tripled the soy, brown sugar, and (rice wine) mirin and corn starch, but only doubled the ginger and garlic.  It was enough to serve 3 really hungry souls and give my wife a great lunch the next day.  This is a definite keeper and will go into my saved recipe file for sure.  I made this in a 20 inch woc and it was a quick and easy way to have a great meal with very little cleanup  This rating is by Harrison of Freeport, Illinois  Enjoy

I made this recipe this evening adding only extra vegetables (as shown in the photo); cabbage, red pepper, onions and mushrooms.  My husband, who is a "challenged" eater (it is difficult for him to eat very much), ate an ENORMOUS portion (for him) and told me that he loved every single bite!  HURRAH! I myself also ate a large portion and our three teenage males inhaled the rest.  What a delightful success.  You may be certain that I will be making this often in the future!!  Thank you for this recipe!!!!!!!

Used left overs grilled pork and marinated it with the sauce. You don't need a wok, I stir fried veggies first then added meat and sauce.   Doubled the garlic.  Next time I will double the sauce.  Just add any fresh veggies I had in crisper.  All really good!!

I had to make a couple of substitutions because where I live in South America, sometimes things are not available. I used one Tb. cider vinegar with one Tb. white wine in place of the rice wine, and since we have no snow peas, I used julienned zucchini. I don't doubt that the original recipe would be better, but the way I made it was excellent as well! Oh, and I used an end piece of beef tenderloin, which is more tender than round steak.

This is a great sauce!  I doubled the sauce and used a lot of different veggies, and also used thinly sliced pork because that's what I had on hand.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.  I served it over brown rice.  Will probably mix it up and use sliced beef and serve over stir fried noodles sometimes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great.  The only change was I used London Broil (it was on sale) and it worked find.  Added more vegetables  and a bit more spice but that was it.  Will definitely be making it again.

Lovely picture of what is supposed to be this dish.  However, the picture doesn't show snow peas, but DOES have red pepper strips, maybe zucchini?  Picture should be of the actual dish not something else.

This is a great recipe!! We made it with mixed veggies, and it was GREAT. However, I would like it even more with broccoli only, and thinner cut beef meat. The pieces of beef need to be thin.
Also, we doubled the sauce recipe and I still think we could have easily tripled it... double the sauce recipe, at minimum, maybe tripple. Overall, 5 stars.

Better than restaurant. Used 2.5lb of tip steak thin sliced and marinated in sauce ingredients minus cornstarch overnight.  This cut was $5/lb vs $8/lb for flank. When I was ready to make it I made lots of extra sauce as we like sauce, and added assortment of veggies that I like. served with white rice and EVERYONE raved about it. I agree, it was delicious! At least as good as the really yummy chinese place we order from. This is a keeper for sure.

Tasted great! Sort of a healthier, fresher version of Panda Express's Mongolian beef. I was out of a couple things - substituted garlic powder for garlic and club soda for the rice wine. Added a little bit of chili flakes for a little spice.

This sauce was the perfect base I've been looking for when making cashew stir fry. I made this with tofu, snow peas, cashews and a little bit of onion. I also doubled the garlic.

EASY, QUICK, TASTY.   This is a basic Asian stir fry in terms of flavor- not particularly new, but really tasty!   FABULOUS for an easy weeknight dinner- it's great to add some variety when you are tired of the same old fare.   I was intimidated to try Asian cooking but this recipe made it so simple and as another reviewer commented, really gave me confidence.  My only change was omission of ginger which I could picture would take it to another level if you like it.  I also tossed in some zucchini which was delish.  Thanks!

The recipe is a good one, it is simple like Chinese cooking is supposed to be. Being Chinese, I advise that if you're going to use beef, pound it and marinate it first, this will make it tender. Use a cut of meat that has a lot of marblelization -- not round or lean meats. Chuck is good or an expensive cut steak like porterhouse, rib eye, if you want to splurge. Chuck cooked quickly in a wok is tender. Use authentic Chinese soy sauce -- Kikkoman, and the run of the mill grocery store brands are icky. So the recipe is correct, but it's the QUALITY of the ingredients, and the QUALITY of the heat source that matters. The higher the temperature of the wok, the more Chinese it's going to taste. Pounding and marinating will tenderize beef and pork.

I had some snow peas I had frozen last fall, so I made it. Used a scorching hot cast iron skillet and added red chilies. Not a total loss, but not the best ever either.

I will definitely keep this recipe however I would try removing veggies and meat AFTER stir frying and then adding the veggies and meat after the sauce has thickened to my taste...I like sauces not too thin unless adding a bit more of cornstarch will help.

Very easy and VERY tasty!  I used rice wine vinegar (instead of rice wine) and ginger powder (instead of fresh), and it still turned out good.  Also used diet stew meat instead of round steak with no problem.  Seems pretty diet friendly - so an extra bonus!

I found this too vinegary. I would cut the vinegar in half. 
I've made stir frys in a similar fashion... oil, garlic and ginger in pan, add meat, then a little soy sauce and the veggies, cover till veggies are done but still crispy. Didn't use sugar or vinegar and it was very good.

Nice flavor.  I used rice vinegar, which may or may not be the same as rice wine, but the flavor was perfect.  I doubled the sauce (perfect for 1 lb. of meat over rice).  I also added one 12 oz. bag of frozen Birdseye Steamfresh "Asian Medley" veggies.  Cooked them in microwave according to directions and added at the very end prior to serving.  Becaue of this addition, I did not double the amount of snow peas.

I love this sauce, I double it, and add whatever I have on hand. I have also made it with chicken. Also great. I add more ginger, double the sauce ingredients, and go from there.

I subbed frozen stir fried vegetables instead of the snow peas to make a fast and tasty meal. My husband and I both liked it, and I would make it again. Especially good for a weeknight meal.

I double the sauce and added water chestnuts, onion, green and red pepper.
I used rib eye steak that I barbequed about 4 minutes per side instead of round steak.  New York strip steak will be good too.

Great taste! I doubled the sauce, and added broccoli.  Next time I will decrease cooking time drastically for meat and increase cornstarch to thicken up sauce. After these changes it will probably be 5 stars.

Very good and easy!  As other s suggested I doubled the sauce and you could probably even do more then that.  Also, I went heavy on the cornstarch to aid in thickening.  I served it over Calrose rice. I used sugar snap peas instead of snow peas and it was great!  I also added bell peppers and a small amount of onion, although I'll do more onion next time. Overall very good.  Topped with  sauce.

Followed the advice of others and actually tripled the sauce. Also, couldn't find rice wine so just omitted it all together but did add some chili paste to it. Would like to try again using the rice wine...

I made a lot of additions to this (noodles, mushrooms, green, red, yellow peppers), but having never made a true asian flavored dish before this was a very good base because of the flavors of the sauce.

Wonderful. Easy, fast, and very flavorful. Is at least as good as the equivalent at an oriental restaurant! As was recommended, I did double the sauce, and I didn't have too much.

This was a great dish. I also couldn't find Rice wine so I used White cooking Wine and it cam out good too. i will definitely try it with rice wine soon. Also I did like others said and doubled up on everything to make it more juicier with the sauce. It would have been way to dry other wize. An over all good dish!

Made as others suggested, doubling the sauce. I used Rice wine and only added snow peas, will deff make it again and add some sort of spice, I thought it was a little too sweet, but over all great for my first time.

Fantastic!  I have made this several times at the urging of my husband and kids, who love every bite.  Other than doubling everything (because there is never enough -- seriously, this is the only thing I make that there are never leftovers, no matter how much I make) I make it exactly to recipe.  Delicious and sooooo easy to make!

Edible, but not what you think. About the same as out of a can. Not restaurant-style, not really that flavorful. If you're after something authentic, or want something to knock your socks off, this ain't it.

This recipe didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. I followed the directions exactly. But I'm not a fan of round steak (too chewy) and it didn't do the flavors justice. Also, my snow peas were hard (bought the packaged kind--big mistake, fresh would have been better). I did like the sauce alot but it didn't penetrate the meat or veggies enough to affect the flavor. But I appreciate your posting this recipe, as I generally love this kind of food and am always willing to try new recipes like this.

Loved it.  Didn't have rice wine so left it out and it was still delicious.  Added broccoli, carrots and green onion too.  The whole family loved it!

I really enjoyed this, but my DH and DD both didn't like it, so I'm giving it 3 stars. Thank you for the recipe, but I probably won't be making it again unless I make it just for me.

This was very quick and tasty. Next time I might marinate the meat overnight so its more tender. I thought the sauce was excellent, and was just the right amount for two of us, even though I used the recipe for four!

Overall, this dish was good and we will make it again!  For me it was verging on too salty, so next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce.  I will also add more ginger, since I love that and I thought it needed more.  We doubled the sauce as someone suggested and we actually had a lot of sauce left over in the pan, even after serving it over rice, so I don't think it was necessary--next time I will just stick to the original measurements.  Also, since I didn't have rice wine I used dry sherry (which I always substitute for rice wine) and that part turned out fine!

Good and easy recipe.  I followed exactly as recipe is listed and thought there was not enough sauce.  So, next time I will double.  Husband loved it.

Very tasty! I followed the directions exactly and the beef was overcooked. So, Next time I will pull it out of the pan while I cook the veggies and sauce and then add it back to coat before serving.

I love Asian food! As suggested by other reviewers I doubled the sauce recipe and added an extra tablespoon of minced ginger root. I also substituted rice vinegar in place of rice wine because I had it on hand. You can really use any veggies with this. I threw in half a can of water chestnuts and some mushrooms. I've also made it with a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies. This dish is consistently yummy no matter how it's prepared.

It was ok- if you don't cut the meat SUPER THIN the meat gets really chewy and tuff. Needs less ginger, more garlic. I added oinon, peppers and mushroom. I also doubled the sauce.

I added onions (sauteed prior to adding garlic and ginger).  I found the general cooking time was longer for me (took about 25 minutes total). I used stir-fry beef from Giant and I wish I had used something better, because some of the beef was pretty tough.  Very good sauce recipe overall, I doubled it and then some, but ended up with a little too much (not a problem, but just remember in stir fry, there's more sauce then what appears when you look in the pan).

This had a good flavor but I need to find the right cut of meat to really make it work well. I may hvae to try a more tender cut as that's what we are used to.

This wins in all categories! It's very tasty and simple to make. I have two small children so I need easy, flavorful meals to make and this one is a keeper. I changed nothing and served it over brown rice. We inhaled the leftovers so I'll have to make it again very soon. Might try different veggies next time to mix it up.

Just made this tonight.  Was awesome.  Doubled the sauce like the first review said...which made it all the better.  Cooking times are definitely a must...be careful not to cook too long.    I will definitely be cooking this again!

I've made this twice.  I was not able to find rice wine anywhere.  I bought expensive angus meat so it was more tender - - this recipe has a wonderful taste and the whole house smelled great!  It's the first Asian recipe I had turn out.  Yay!

Wonderful oriental flavour, exactly what I expected to find when looking for a recipe that included beef and ginger.  I did take in the suggestions of other reviewers of doubling the soy sauce. Thanks!!!

I really liked the sauce. I doubled it as advised and it was perfect. fried the meat first in 2 batches and removed , fried broccoli, then red pepper then some baby bok choy, added the meat and the sauce. served over quinoa instead of rice as an experiment and it was great, didn't miss the rice at all.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I think the only thing I will do differently next time is maybe add more cornstarch because the sauce never really thickened up at all.

I thought this was pretty good....mostly tasted like soy sauce, though.  I just felt like the sauce could've been more flavorful.

This dish has great flavor with the garlic and ginger. I didnt have rice wine so I used a white wine instead. Also added sliced fresh mushrooms for another veggie. I served over brown rice. I think next time I will add some red onion and water chestnuts.

heavenly. Great fun to have the kids help chop veggies and make the rice while I crushed the fresh garlic and ginger! I really concur that it is helpful to double the sauce for this recipe as it is so delicious when served over the steaming rice. Thank you so much for the original poster of the recipe and the nice person(s) who suggested doubling the sauce.   One thing I DO NOT think would be good and that is using wine vinegar in this recipe. It just sounds like it would be pulling the flavor in a direction it does not want to go. If you have no rice wine, then maybe a splash of pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc at the most, or just leave it out and use some water to temper the saltiness of the soy. If you use vinegar at all it should NOT go in in anywhere near the amount you would use if using rice wine.  Cheers all!

This recipe was a little too salty for my liking. I doubled the sauce as suggested but made no other changes. Next time I will use low sodium soy.

UPDATE:
With the following changes this was excellent! 
Use 1/2 low sodium soy sauce 1/2 water, double sauce and marinate meat for 1 hour.

Like other reviewers I doubled the ginger, garlic, and sauce.  I added carrots and onions one time and I’ve substituted the pea pods for broccoli.  Both have turned out great.  I didn’t have rice wine, but you can use sherry cooking wine (and I read somewhere you can use dry gin also).  I served over steamed white rice.  I really love this recipe, but I can’t get the meat right.  Both times it turned out tough and rubbery.  If you have any suggestions out there please let me know as I love the flavor of the sauce on the veggies and rice, but end up scraping all the meat off.  Help!

Definately use rice WINE, the rice vinegar was odd to our tastebuds.  We also didn't care for the sweetness of this recipe.  Will keep looking.

Huh.  Not sure what to say...the sauce was almost  'tart'--maybe too much rice wine?  Very easy and smelled great but didn't taste as I had hoped.

I don't often feel compelled to rate/review a recipe but this was amazing!! Seriously good, you just have to double the recipe. Stuck to original recipe except that I added sliced green pepper. I was worried because my beef needed more cooking time *maybe cuz the heat wasn't that high?* Anyway it turned out great!

This recipe is excellent and not too expensive to make. The last couple of times I made it, I added some water chestnuts and sprouts for a little extra umph, but the recipe is just fine without adding all of the extra stuff. By the way, I don't drink wine, so I don't have it on hand for such recipes. I just substituted for it with grape juice and it was still awesome. Maybe different than rice wine, but a great alternative for non-drinkers.

This was great my family really loved it. Even my son who is not a fan of veggies. Only thing i did differently was added chopped onion to the garlic and ginger. And more veggies. Red and green pepper with the peas. I served with jasmine rice and really the only complaint it got was I did not make enough. Oh and my dirty little secret? I used a pack of stew meat cut small and it was still great! I did have to double the sauce though and it was perfect.

Very good & easy!!  I did double the sauce recipe as others have commented and was glad I did...the sauce was a bit too gingery or sweet so I would probably change up the sauce a bit and taste as I go...I would definatley make it again.

As a beginner cook I found this recipe both easy and delicious. I doubled the sauce and was glad I did because there wouldn't be enough otherwise.

This is great!  Simple, easy, quick, and tasty.  I substituted a cut-up salmon fillet.

I thought this was very good, my only complaint being that it was incredibly salty. I will cut waaay down on the soy sauce next time. However, the amount of ginger and garlic were just right. I didn't know if the rice wine meant actual rice wine, or rice wine vinegar. I have both, so used half of each. Served with white rice and my home made cream cheese wontons. I have made better stir frys, but I will definitely try this again after reducing the soy sauce.

This was excellent. I should have read the review first so I would have been prepared to double the sauce. I ended up having to make another batch after we sat down and realized how dry it was.

I added extra veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, peas and green beans) because I love veggies and tripled the sauce due to the extra veggies. It was not good at all. The sauce was sour! I tried to add more brown sugar, but it really didn't do anything.

Great basic recipe that is very easy to make your own.  If your beef strips are very thin, I suggest to saute them for only about 1 to 1.5 minutes a side then remove from the pan while you saute your veggies... add sauce and meat to veggies at same time. Any veggie combination works... tonight I used broccoli, carrots, celery, mushrooms, red peppers and onion...sauteed in sesame oil... to add some heat, I used 1/4 tsp of asian chili paste... thanks for the great start!  I also doubled the sauce... hubby loves saucier stir-fries... thanks again!

A sure-fire winner!  As others suggested, I doubled the recipe for the sauce. I removed the steak from the pot as soon as it started to brown.  Instead of snow peas, I used onions, green/red bell peppers,carrots and broccoli florets.  Great flavor and the best stir fry. What I loved most is that ginger doesn't overpower this recipe. My husband and I ate it all - no leftovers.

I am not the best at making stir-fry's, but this was so easy. I just made a little more sauce and used cooking sherry because I don't have rice wine. This recipe is defiantly going into my personal favs!

This was actually a really nice recipe with no need to change the original ingredients.  I did however double the sauce (which I don't think is a bad idea).  The flavor was not too strong or salty as with other Asian recipe renditions on this site.  My husband is a very picky eater so I've been trying out new recipes while he's gone.  I have a feeling that this is one that he'd like.

The sauce was very tasty, but I will try a different meat and try adding more veggies next time. The recipe as written made two servings in my case.

Great recipe! Quick, easy and delicious...perfect for a busy weeknight dinner! I doubled the sauce (just because I like extra on my rice) and I think next time I'll add more veggies. This will become one of my go-to meals though!

Awesome! Simple, easy tasty. I made it w/ Shrimp and Tofu. I had edamame, carrots and mushrooms on hand so I used that. It came out great. I did need to ad a bit more cornstarch to thicken it up.

I loved this recipe! I doubled the sauce and used onion, green pepper, and broccoli for the vegetables. My only problem was by the time the vegetables cooked down my meat was a little over done. Next time I will cook the vegetables separate.

This was really great! I also added red peppers to my mix and I'm sure all veggies would taste great. I didn't have any rice vinegar, so I just left it out and it tasted fine. I also added a bit of honey to my sauce. Served over brown rice and it was a big hit at my house. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was pretty good. My husband enjoyed it more than I did.  I felt the sauce lacked flavor but my husband thought it was perfect.  I recommend that the sauce be doubled, maybe tripled.  There was not enough sauce to soak the rice I served with it.  But it was a really easy and quick recipe.

A little too much of an orange flavor for my taste.  The rice was also very sticky.  Just not my personal taste.  Loved the beef and the snow peas!

I added about twice the ginger and garlic, and then threw in some cooked rice noodles when I put the sauce in the pan. It was excellent.

This was great!  I made it exactly according to recipe and it was very good, but the second time I doubled the sauce and added a chopped onion and red pepper and thought it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!  Goes great with basmati rice.

It was fine. I did double the sauce and I used inexpensive plum wine instead of rice wine (I had it in the house). It wasnt bad but it really wasn't anything special, just beef in brown sauce and not the best at that.

You need to double the sauce.  It is a good basic sauce that can be attenuated to your tastes.

Fantastic!  I also doubled the sauce, added a package of stir fry veggies from the fresh produce section, and used sirloin.  I served this over jasmine rice.  Yum!

I used ribeye because it was on sale.  It was flavorful and moist.  I tripled the recipe as suggested in the reviews and that made a perfect amount.

What a fun, quick & unique recipe! I agree with a few others that the sauce needs to be doubled, and I felt the need to add salt & pepper. Other than that, this was fantastic. I can't wait to try this with shrimp & chicken.

Great flavor combination. I made it as stated with the addition of muchrooms and red bell peppers. I am a salty kind of girl and it was a bit too salty for me. I suggest either cutting down on the soy sauce or using the low sodium soy sauce. I did double the sauce to put over rice:-) Yum!

My husband and I did not like this dish. The ginger and rice vinegar was too overpowering. The meat became overcooked when I was waiting for the sauce to thicken. This recipe does not taste like an authentic Asian dish. Will definitely not make again.

This was an excellent "quick fix meal." Our beef came out a little tough, but the flavor was great and it is a super easy recipe. This might also be good with some water chestnuts or other items in it.

This was really easy and really authentic tasting. I used beef chuck 7 bone pot roast due to a good deal at the market. It came out great. I would double the sauce next time though.

This recipe is great for so many reasons.  It's quick to put together, very versatile, healthy, & yumyumyummy.  My family loves ginger & this recipe hit the spot for us.  I did double the sauce recipe as suggested by other reviewers.  If you like lots of sauce then triple or quadruple it.  Thanks for sharing this genius recipe!

Really enjoyed this.  The meat was very tender.  We added in other stir fry veggies we liked to make the dish go further.  Great addition to my weeknight repertoire!

Per other suggestions, I doubled the sauce and since I didn't have rice wine I used the red wine vinegar - the sauce was overpowering and there was too much of it.  Will try again with the rice wine - the meat and snow peas were cooked perfectly though.

This is sooooo easy and so good.  I doubled the sauce and went a bit easy on the ginger, as it can be overpowering for us.  I added red bell pepper, zuchini, water chestnuts, cashews and sesame seeds.  I serve this over Jasmine rice, YUM!  Thanks for this great recipe!

My boyfriend really liked this. I thought that the sauce tasted pretty good on it's own... but then when I added into the mix I thought the flavor was not quite right. I added a few more veggies than called for and found that the sauce was not quite enough either... I doubled the recipe and found to be a little happier with the result. All in all I thought the recipe was pretty good... but not my favorite Asian creation.

I gave it four stars as that's the middle between my  husband who rated it 3 and my 7yo who rated it a 5. Very easy to prepare (especially since I used left over tri-tip) and the sauce is a good base to play with in terms of personal taste.

This turned out wonderful as a quick afternoon lunch. I had the meat marinating in the fridge overnight in the soy sauce, rice wine, ginger and garlic sauce. The next morning I had my rice cooker set to start cooking my rice at noon. Later I heated up oil, threw in the meat and snow peas and served it over the rice....delicious!

We were not a big fan of the vinegar in the sauce which I think was very strong tasting.  Followed directions exactly.  Thanks for letting us try.

I have to say I thnk this is one of the best stir fry type of recipes I have evr had. I love the tartness of the rice wine vinegar with the ginger. I did not change a thing. Loved it!

This was awesome- I used  sirloin, added a red bell pepper and used coconut oil.  I also used rice wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand- it was delicious!  I will double the sauce next time- it was great over brown rice.

Quick & healthy! Instead of 1tbsp of brown sugar, I used 1tbsp of honey- just a habit. I hate adding sugar to meals. I also added sliced red peppers & onions to the dish. I'll make this next time I'm in a pinch.

It was good, but I did add a little more sugar.  It was too salty at first.  Next time I am going to make a double batch just of the sauce, and sweeten it up.

I used this recipe for the sauce and added a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies with the beef.  I thought it was really good.  Assuming rice wine is the same as rice wine vinegar, I followed the sauce recipe exactly.  I wouldn't change a thing.  There was plenty of sauce for a lb. of beef and the veggies.  I served it over brown rice.  Will make again.

Yum!  I pretty much followed the recipe, but just doubled the quantity.  I also listened to what some of the others said about increasing the sauce per meat ratio.  I used beef sirloin, which was a good tender cut, and added sliced bamboo shoots.  The sauce wasn't all that thick, but I think it ended up how it was meant to be.  Quick and easy recipe and good flavor as well!

I followed the recipe without any modifications and it turned out very good.  It had a robust flavor and went great over rice.  The only reason I do not give it an full 5 stars is because I would recommend a better cut of meat.  If you use the recommended cut of beef make sure that you cut it extremely thin so it will not be tough and chewy.

This was very good. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce. I also didn't have rice wine, so I used 1/2 the amount called for and used rice wine vinegar. Delicious!

I followed the recipe except for the rice wine. It's really hard to find ingredients like that in the country I live in so I substituted some dry red wine for it. I also threw in some baby corn and red pepper. It was a very basic, good stir-fry. Each guest was able to add thai chili sauce and other things to their individual plate according to their taste.

I don't know what happened but the sauce didn't thicken at all. It was watery and I tried to give it more time to thicken, but by then my beef had overcooked. I was eager for this to be good because it would be pretty healthy, but it was a disappointment.

This was pretty good - not spectacular which is why I only did 4 and not 5 stars, but pretty good.  Easy to make, and it is a good base for whatever variations you want to make with additional veggies and such.  I doubled the sauce since I added extra vegetables and we served it with rice.  I'm sure I will make this one again.

I couldn't get over how quick and easy this was to make!  The only problem that I had with the recipe was my own fault.  I didn't realize we didn't have any soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce instead but it turned out fantastic!  I did make about double the sauce because I too doubted how far the sauce would go.  I also added about 4 or 5 more ounces of snow peas because my family is crazy about them.  I have already been requested to make this again :)  Thanks!

authentic tasting. i doubled the sauce and used dried ginger as someone else recommended. i used 2 tbsp ginger but found it a bit much (although my husband said it was perfect). also used different veggies--carrots, celery, onion and red pepper. a great base recipe and a wonderful sauce.

This was pretty good, but a little bland for our taste. I followed the recipe exactly except I added more variety of vegetables, and it was good, but as I said, pretty bland, I think if I make this again, I'll have to add some red pepper or something else to make it a bit more flavorful.

Oh my goodness, I wish I could rate this a 10!!!!  This recipe was incredible!!!  

I always hate it when someone rates a recipe and adds all of kinds of things to it so I tried it normal the first time and it was incredible!  I love the sauce so the next time I made it I doubled the sauce amount to give even more flavor.  I also had some matchstick carrots in the fridge so I threw them in.  You have to try this recipe but do it the way it is written up above first, you will love it!

A delicious recipe.  Only change I made was to add more veggies (waterchestnuts, baby corn, and edamame).  Great for a weeknight dinner, came together really fast.  Served with Basmati Rice.

We loved it - and it's extra nice that it's so low fat. I plan to add a bit of extra ginger next time though.

This was a very good stir-fry.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce.  It was perfect. It never did thicken as much as I would have liked, but it didn't affect the overall meal.  Every in my family loved it.  I also used an assortment of stir fry veggies instead of just the snow peas.  Very good!

This was just ok for me.  The main flavor was salt which just overpowered the whole dish.  I probably won't make it again.

This tasted delicious!  I agree with a few of the other reviews that it doesn't "smell" that great when putting it all together but do not let that fool you!  I didn't have nor couldn't find rice wine so I used what I had on hand:  plain red wine instead!  I doubled the liquid recipe added water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and served over steamed rice and everyone loved it!!

Good Stuff!!  Instead of snow peas I used scallions, julienned carrots and broccoli.  Added a little more ginger too.  Loved the light taste of the sauce.

I doubled the sauce recipe...I still didn't think there was much sauce, next time, I'll probably triple it.  Also, the rice wine vinegar was a little strong...I think I'll try it with a little less.  I added zucchini, carrot slices, onions and snow peas...it was very good!!

Fantastic! I found it very delicious and satisfying, and even my very picky 4 year old (who will usually not touch anything besides chicken nuggets)devoured it! This has become a weekly favorite in our household. Perfect served over brown rice. I added red peppers and broccoli for more variety, but the sauce would be absolutely delicious over any combo of veggies.

Simple and Delicious!  I added strips of red bell pepper along with the snow peas but otherwise kept the recipe the same. YUM!  This is also a really inexpensive meal to make so I may keep the round steak on hand for the future.  Thanks for this one!

I was looking for something quick and easy to make at the last minute, so I made this dish.  I didn't have rice wine or snow peas, so I used apple juice and fresh sliced mushrooms instead.  It turned out great.  I would double the sauce next time to make more juice to serve with rice.

Edited: This is the second time I've made this. It was just ok. I doubled the sauce and used fresh shredded ginger. I think I'll look for another recipe next time, this was too heavy on the soy sauce for my husband's taste though he didn't complain. -- This was a little sweeter than I prefer for a stir-fry but I thought it was great and the recipe was so easy!

Great flavor!  I used Sake instead of rice wine because I couldn't find the rice wine.  It had a great flavor.  I also added some thinly sliced onions and next time, I'll add some mushrooms too.

This recipe was pretty good. I used very thin sandwich steaks which worked perfectly and turned out so tender. The flavor was good but you could definitely tell there was lots of sodium in it.

This was a solid dish, and not too difficult for a cooking novice like myself. Getting good quality beef seems really important. We might try marinating the beef next time, too, for a little more flavor. Overall, I liked it a lot!

This was very good and easy to make. Make sure to mince the ginger up really good. I didn't like biting into the bigger chunks. This would also be very good with broccoli instead of snow peas, but those were good too. I doubled the sauce recipe. Served with brown rice and spooned the extra sauce over the rice. Delicious!

A new family favorite. I made slight changes. I throw everything in the pan and stirfry together. I also added mushrooms and red bellpepper. And I use a filet because it keeps the meat tender the next day for left overs! The sauce has wonderful flavor. Thank you

I added way too much ginger (first time working with fresh ginger), but the sirloin steak I used worked perfectly with this dish (as it tends to with any stir fry). I doubled the sauce, which seemed to be adequate. Somewhat bachelor friendly... I'd imagine most bachelors would just buy pre-made sauce.

This is a pretty good, simple stir-fry.  I've made this a few times and substituted pork in lieu of the beef.  It's a quick, delicious meal if you're in a hurry!

I was so impressed with the quality of this dish, given that from the time I opened the refrigerator until we sat down to eat, only 30 minutes had passed! The flavor was decent, but I did add some sesame oil and a lot of red pepper flakes to take it up a notch. I'd also recommend using a dark, syrupy soy sauce (as opposed to "Lite" varieties) for a richer flavor. This recipe is too quick and easy to not use it again!

This recipe is delecious. I double or triple it for my large family. I usually make extra sauce and found that I need to cut back on the fresh ginger a little. We like to add onions and peppers.

Marinated pre-tenderized beef in soya for about 30 min. Followed recipe except for adding sliced mushroom, red pepper to snow peas. Not overly impressed with the flavors.

I loved this recipe!! It was very easy to make and even more delicious to eat! I made a few changes myself, I added more veggies including, baby carrots, little corns, and broccoli. I also left out the ginger because I couldn't find any and the recipe still tasted delicious. I will definately make this again.

Wow, the flavor of this meal was incredible!  I took the advise of other reviewers and double the sauce which was a great idaea. I also added some onion to the garlic & ginger saute.
Only bad thing is that I overcooked the meat (my fault) - next time I'll try it with chicken.
Thanks so much, I loved it.

Tripled the sauce like so many others, but probably could have added even more cornstarch as it never thickened. Kids wanted Broccoli Beef, so I added broccoli to the snow peas along with water chestnuts. The flavor was ok and the meat was also tough. Don't know whether it cooked too long or it was the cut. Maybe will try marinating the beef next time with a little ginger for more flavor and less toughness. Nevertheless, it's quick and easy recipe to make and customize. It'll be on the menu whenever we have a plethora of Asian veggies sitting in the crisper.

This was ok....not amazing. I do agree that this might taste better with some added veggies like baby corn and some mushrooms. Very easy to make and not a lot of prep work...I might try again and tinker a bit. Thanks.

Absolutely delicious! The kids loved it too.  I will definitely make this again.  I think it may taste just as good if I just used vegetables and no meat, I will try that next time.

I loved this recipe!  Simple and fantastic.  I did think that doubling the sauce was a must  after making it.  I just threw a second batch in the pan for a few minutes and added it to supper.  Great job!

Very good recipe!  I added a japanese vegatable stir fry mix to have more veggies.  I doubled the sauce for more flavor and make it juicer! I used red wine vinegar instead of rice wine, tasted great!I served it over minute brown rice, delicious and quick!

This was a quick dinner fix and it went over without rave or poor reviews.... somewhat just fine. I did take the advice of other reviewers and did "up" the amounts ingredients required for the sauce. Will make again.... Thanks for a quick dinner choice.

This was good but the sauce was thin even after it boiled, and didn't really stick to the food.  Next time I'd add a little more cornstarch.  I doubled the sauce (including ginger and garlic) and added shitake mushrooms.  The mushrooms were the best part, since they soaked up the thin sauce.

Quick and delicious! However, not enough sauce.. I suggest using dark soy sauce  and just a little bit of water (more flavor and just a little saltier). I add just a little water in the pan when it's almost done to get all the stuff off the bottom of the pan and into the sauce. I also used powdered ginger in the soy b/c it wasn't gingery enough for my taste. Also, only 1/2 the rice vinegar. Works equally well with chicken and shrimp. Thanks!

I lightly cooked  snow peas and  chopped red peppers in sesame oil, sprinkled withgarlic pepper, ginger and red pizza peppers.  Added left over teriyaki tri-tip.  Then added 1 cup water with a beef bouillon cube and sugar.  Mixed soy sauce with 1 tablespoon cornstarch.  My family thought we were eating at PF Changs!

Fabulous flavor.  I didn't have rice wine so I used white wine, and used about 1/8 tsp. of ginger from a jar (didn't have fresh ginger root) which I added to the sauce rather than the stir fry.  I served this over rice with Bok Choy salad from this web site.  Great meal!  I think next time I'll make the sauce separately in a sauce pan and use a better cut of beef (maybe fillet) as the meat was a bit tough, and stir fry it only briefly, then add the sauce to the stir fry just before serving.

I thought this was pretty good, and my husband loved it. I used stir fry veggies instead of Snow peas alone.  I think I will try it with mushrooms and water chestnuts as other suggested next time.  A very quick, easy and healthy dinner.

I triped the sauce as others suggested.... I wouldn't do this. Ended up incredibly salty tasting (and I used low sodium soy sauce). The cooking times aren't right... my beef ended up overcooked by the time my veggies were soft enough.

I had to come on the computer to print off this recipe again.  It is sooo good!  I'm a vegetarian and use the Morning Star "beef" starters while my husband uses real beef.  We both LOVE this recipe and make it once a week.  It takes NO time if you use bottled ginger and garlic (my trick).

It was pretty good! It sounded a little bland with only the beef and peas so I added yellow peppers and at the last minute shaved carrot - it added to the taste and also the color was great! I will make this again!

I thought this was OK. I doubled the sauce as others suggested but I thought the sauce was too overpowering.

I made a lot more sauce for this recipe which made it even better, but the  meat never got as tender as I wanted to. I added broccoli and served it over a bed of egg noodles. Next time, I would like to use a better cut of meat, or maybe even chicken.

Didn't turn out as well as I would have liked but that was more my fault than anything.  I never time things right with stir frys and this was no exception (everything got a little overdone).  Good flavor though.  I also used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil which added a better nutty flavor.

My whole family ate this dinner. I did add some baby corn and double the sauce, as others recommended. I also used the sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I also add garlic chili paste to all my stir fry dishes. If you like a little heat, you should try it. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved it, and will definitely use this one again.  I will make more sauce, and add other veggies. I find most Asian receipts not full of flavor, unlike going out to eat. This one packs that same punch of flavor.

This was pretty normal, but I love Asian food so this gets 4 stars.  I used beef rib cap and cut them into small bite-size pieces.  After adding the snow peas, I also added baby carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and water chestnuts.  The sauce did not thicken for my due to the extra juice from the meat.  Still pretty good though.

Not bad, but I too would have liked more sauce.  I used chicken breasts (they were on sale and much cheaper than the beef) and it still worked.  I strongly recommend fresh snow peas instead of frozen, though.  The frozen ones turned into a soggy mess.

Excellent basic stir fry.  I added some sweet and sour sauce to the skillet and used sirloin strips instead of round steak.  I also added mushrooms and red pepper for an added sweet taste.  It was wonderful.  My husband who hates stir fry had seconds!

I wasn't crazy about this; the meat was rather tough (though I know that's not the recipe's fault) and the flavors just weren't strong enough.  All in all I thought it mostly just tasted like soy sauce.  Hubby liked it though. :)

Yummy recipe!  A great way to use fresh snow peas from our summer garden.  I had all of the ingredients on hand for a last minute dinner idea.  My husband said it was one of my better meals.  Thanks!

Good taste and easy to make.  I added extra veggies - bell pepper and onion - and made extra sauce.  Also, reduced the sugar by half because we aren't fond of sweet meats.  It was the best stir-fry I've tried so far.  Thanks for the recipe

Quite nice! I thought this was an excellent recipe.  Preparation was easy, and both the taste & presentation were superb.  I made this in accord with the given recipe, but I can see where it would be easily modified with a different choice of vegeatables.  Thanks, Holly, for the excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe that works even if you add different vegetables or don't add any vegetables at all. Very authentically Asian in flavour. It could do with a bit more cornstarch if you want a thicker sauce. I marinate my beef in some ground black pepper before frying. Quick and delicious!
