It really annoys me when people say a recipe is great but then go on to say how changed half the recipe.  I want to read reviews of what the recipes is like as is not after people change a majority of the ingredients.    Sorry, rant over.  I enjoyed this recipe.   I made it to take to work and even people who don't eat cranberries were eating it.  Great recipe, and yes this is a 'as is' review.

this tasted really very good, not too sweet and not too tart. it might bee a good idea to (very) coursely chop the cranberries first, a whole cranberry can be very tart if you bite into too many in one mouthfull, but definitely a keeper!

I used 2 Fuji apples and 3 Granny Smith for this recipe. I think it was a good idea to add some sweet apples in there because otherwise it would be quite tart. I also used unsalted butter for the topping. It is a very good crisp though and super easy to make.

Combined two recipes and doubled; here are my modifications: combine: 2.5c oats, 1c br.sugar, 2/3c flour, 1c soft butter, 1/2c nuts, chopped (for topping). Heat together as in recipe: 16oz cranberry, 3T cornstarch, 2T lemon juice, 4T sugar, 1/4tsp nutmeg, dash ginger. Add: 8 granny smith apples, 16oz peach sauce (canned peaches may also work). Baked in 9x13 dish. Delicious!

Very good crisp!  I used butter instead of butter flavored shortening and added walnuts to the topping.  Will probably cut back on sugar a little next time, but will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe at Thanksgiving and its great as a side dish or a dessert.  The granny smith apples and cranberries are just the right mix of tart and sweet.  A couple days later I had leftovers for dessert and added caramel sauce.  Excellent recipe (don't change a thing).  I'll probably make this for Christmas too.

Very good. However, there was no way 10 apples fit into my 9x13 pan, so I had an extra 8x8 pan too. Not too sweet which is what people liked about it. Very nice alternative to regular apple crisp, by adding the cranberries. I used fresh ones and made my own sauce first.

This recipe was not a favorite with my family when I tried it. The whole berry cranberry sauce is very tart and the shortening gave it a heavy, almost greasy undertaste. If I make this again, I would use butter instead of shortening and maybe only half the amount of cranberry sauce.

This was good but no way would I use butter flavored shortening, I used real butter, also added one cup of chopped pecans to the filling. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great! I made it for Thanksgiving, but we taste tested tonight. I;m not much of an apple or chanberry person, certainly not those jelly looking cranberries in the can, but wow. This will be a yearly staple. I used real butter instead of shortening, and I added maybe double to get that crunchy topping right. This is very sweet, but it's mostly apples, so it felt healthy, not so heavy like chocolate or other things like that.

It was okay considering I made some substitutions.  I used regular cranberry sauce and I didn't have any cornstarch so I had to use flour. It would probably be better if I had the right ingredients on hand.

I had a ton of cranberries to use up. This was a very delicious way to do it. The recipe is not too tart and not to sweet. Just a lovely combination of flavors. Yummy when served warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.

I really screwed this recipe up but it turned out pretty darn good regardless!   I ended up mixing everything together in one large pot after I realized I messed it up, then baking it as a mixture instead of layered.  Really good!

Very good! I used 3 Gala apples and 2 Granny Smith, but next time I'll only use 2 Galas because 4 apples was enough. The topping made a good amount to cover the entire dish and made a nice, thick crust. Will make again.

Had leftover cranberry sauce from thanksgiving and aging apples in the fruit basket so needed to use up.  This did the trick.  Doubled the topping (because everyone said their favorite part of apple crisp is the crisp!) and used 2/3 granny smith and 1/3 red gala apples. Turned out to be delicious, all gone overnight.  Will save this recipe to try again!

Excellent as-is.  I love the fact that I can used canned cranberry and not have to pay a premium for fresh.  The second time I made it, I had to change it a little bit - I only had fuji apples, so I made up for it by using only 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I also only used 1/4 margarine.  The topping was drier but still crispy and tasty.  This is just an all-around great, easy, recipe.

This recipe is truly the best.  It's a great alternative to cranberry sauce.  And it's become part of my family's tradition every year.

I made this for New Years Eve and served it at room temperature. I served as a side dish with 7 other items. Maybe I had too much food or fussy eaters but only a quarter of this was eaten. My apples must of been big cuz I had to put in a 7x11 dish. When I tested it before putting it all together I thought it to be pretty sour so I added 1/4 cup sugar. Everyone that had it said it was good. Thanks!

What a wonderful addition to almost any meal.  I have served it to company many times and everyone has loved it, even those who swore they HATE cranberries!

Get your pointing fingers ready!  Yes, I changed it.  I changed it a lot!  I did!  I admit it! ... This looks like a beginner/home ec recipe & that's fine, but once you've been cooking a while, you can improve things.  Tip: Offbrand/Storebrand (Kroger whole berry, 29g per 1/4c)foods have more sugar than namebrand (Oceanspray whole berry, 22g per 1/4c.  I've noticed this with other foods, too.  'Guess since sugar is cheap to add ... weight is similar, but not quite the same inside.)  I didn't think sweetened cranberry juice was enough for all those apples - so I added 1/4c sugar, 1/2t cinnamon, 1/8t each allspice & nutmeg.  No cornstarch so used 1/3c flour mixed with 1/3c orange juice & added that to the melted sauce.  Stirred till thickened & added the apples.  I can get my guy child, 17, to eat oatmeal cookies, but not oats on top so went with traditional streusel topping of 1/3c flour & sugar, 1t cinnamon, 3T butter.  Greased a 9x11, baked for 45.  Since this is pretty juicy, that streusel didn't crunch at all.  It just ended up being essentially cinnamon-sugar on top.  Okay, but not necessasary.  I'd recommend the oats or a pie crust topping.  My dented can of cranberries is used as well as bruised grannies.  Mission accomplished & dessert, too!

I made this for my hubby for his bday and he loved it! I used crazens instead of cranberry sauce and one can of apple pie filling instead of fresh apples. I boiled the crazens in about 2 cups of water then let sit for a couple of hours before adding the cornstarch and boiling again. I also doubled the recipe for the topping and lined the bottom of a pie dish with half of the topping mixture. This recipe is going to be one of our families all time favorite Thanks!!!!!

I unlike one of your reviewers love when people send in the changes they made to any of the recipes.  I think it helps make more people use these recipes as not everyone likes the same thing.  I love this recipe and I love some of the revisions and hope they continue coming.

This turned out really well, and was a fun, more casual alternative next to the Thankgiving pumpkin pie. I don't have a fancy peel/core/slicer machine, so I didn't peel the Granny Smiths. I just cut them in very thin "wedges" around the core. The little bits of green were kind of attractive next to the cranberries anyway.  I also assembled the whole thing the night before, kept it in the fridge and baked it before dinner.  Just incase the crandberries weren't acidic enough to keep the apples from browning, I threw in a dash of lime juice. Worked great!

Absolutely amazing!! The second time round (three days after the first, lol), I used unsalted butter instead. It adds a very nice flavor to the greatness already present in this recipe!

I wanted to try this recipe from the first time I read the ingredients.  It smelled heavenly baking!  I substituted regular cranberry sauce instead of the whole berries at the last minute.  The first day after I made it, it had a heavy twang.  But the next day it was even better--the flavor had mellowed!  So this is definitely a dish to make for the next day.  :)

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dessert - it was so easy to make and even more delicious!  We served it warm with ice cream and since it's just 2 of us in the house we had leftovers to look forward to - i wanted to eat it for breakfast!

Made this last Thanksgiving and will be making it again this year.  It's delicious and so easy to put together. I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan, and served with a bit of whipped topping. My husband loved it and has requested that I make it every Thanksgiving from now on.

Very good, and not too difficult!  I would add a few sweeter apples along with the grannies next time though, as it was a little tart for my taste, but other than that it was excellent!  Definitely good w/vanilla ice cream!

This was tart and tasty except the cranberry skins gave it a horrible texture.  This was the only time I've had desserts left over and thrown out at my house.  It took a long time to prepare as well.  I wouldn't recommend fixing it again.

I was told by my several guests, that it was very good. It went so fast, I was only able to try just 1 bite of it. I thought it was tart compared to other crisps I have made.

I made this for Thanksgiving in place of the plain cranberries we usually have. My family liked it, however I thought the apples really took away from the taste of the cranberries.

This was great! It does not need any more sugar than it says. I used a can of apple pie filling, and a can of whole cranberry sauce. Super easy to put together, baked up quick. Delicious!

Great hit with our Christmas party!  People were asking for takehome containers!  Used 3 granny smith and 2 red delicious to cut down on tartness.  Also, made my own cranberry sauce by grinding whole cranberries and cooking w/ 1 cup sugar then letting it set.  Next time will add more topping and put it on the bottom, as well!

This is a great and easy to make. I make it to bring to pot-lucks. The only thing that sucks is that there is never any left to take back home. Sorry hunny.;)

Good! I had a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top. I didn't care for the topping, the oats got stuck in my molars!

I liked this dish OK, but my guests didn't care for it.  I served it as a dessert, but it's really halfway between dessert and side dish.  Cranberries can be a tough sell for some people, so not everyone was destined to like this dish anyway.  Also, the topping was more like granola than I care for.

Yum, yum!  This was awesome stuff!  Mmmmm, just thinking about it I think I'll go heat some up in the microwave when I'm done writing the review.  It was so good, not only did it taste good, it looked good!

This was pretty to look at, yummie to eat. I even had a serving for breakfast the following day. I did use differant apples to avoid it being too acidic, and it worked just fine.

I tried this recipe for a pre Thanksgiving dinner with family that wouldn't be with us for the holiday. It was the hit of the dessert selections. It was quick and easy.

I've been making this recipe for 13 years now. My kids won't let a Thanksgiving go by without it. The only thing I change is to use real butter instead of shortening and do a combination of Honeycrisp and Granny Smith apples.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I thought that Granny Smith's were the wrong choice because you are mixing tart with tart (cranberries) and if you are going to do that, then you should probably have some sugar on the apples to create more of a sweet sauce.  Also, the cooking time was a bit low in my experience.

I just made this for my personal thanksgiving dinner with me and the boyfriend. It was absolutely wonderful. I kept exactly to the recipe and it turned out awesome! Will def make it again not only for thanksgiving but for other dinner's as well. Great sweet/tart dish to compliment with other non-sweet/tart dishes!

I didn't particularly care for this recipe. The oat topping takes away from the fruit flavors. I think it would be better with just a standard struesel topping.

I have been making this for the Thanksgiving for the past 5 years.  It gets countless raves!  I think this has to be the best holiday side dish ever!
