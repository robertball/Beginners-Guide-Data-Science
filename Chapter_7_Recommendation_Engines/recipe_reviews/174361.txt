this dish looks so good. it seems the author missed a step here. i would fry the cranberries and nuts, remove them once translucent, then fry the asparagus in that same oil, then serve with the cranberries and pine nuts on top. this way the asparagus is flavored and the nuts won't burn.

The pine nuts and craisins add a great flavor to the asparagus.  As other reviewers have noted, the pine nuts brown and burn very easily.  (I had to throw the first batch out and start over because the pine nuts were charred black after sautéing the asparagus.)  sauté the cranberries and pine nuts for 3-4 minutes first, remove from pan with slotted spoon, then sauté asparagus, adding the cranberries and pine nuts back to the pan for the last 1-2 minutes of cooking.  When made correctly, the dish is delicious.

We loved this!  The only thing I did different, I steamed the asparagus first and then topped it with the toasted nuts and cranberries.  It's beautiful on the dish!

This was really really tasty. We absolutely loved it. We did manage to burn the pine nuts and cranberries, though, while waiting for the asparagus to cook. Next time we do this I think we'll steam the asparagus separately while simultaneously cooking the crans/nuts in oil in a separate pan and then add the asparagus to the pan to toss and finish up.

This caught my eye because we like asparagus, cranberries and pine nuts!  I cooked my asparagus early in the afternoon and refrigerated it.  I added just a bit of oil (3 T. is way too much), the cranberries and pine nuts and zapped it in the microwave to reheat it.  When plating I added a little crumbled feta too.  It was a wonderful new way to enjoy asparagus!  Thank you!

I was unsure what was meant by cooking the pine nuts until they looked translucent, they just kind of started to brown, but it tasted great anyway! This dish was a great new way to have asparagus and I will make it again.

This is absolutely FANTASTIC!!! What an amazing and delicious change for one of our favorite veggies. I changed just a tiny bit, I added a few slivered almonds in with the pine nuts and cranberries and I sauteed the asparagus in the skillet for a couple of minutes then transferred to the microwave and steamed the stalks for a couple of minutes. It incorporated the wonderful blend of flavors in the skillet with the tenderness and flavor of steaming. After topping with the cranberry/pine nuts/almond mixture I crumbled feta cheese. Elegant in appearance and completely delectable! This is one recipe I'll make again and again and again! MMMMMMMMMMMMMM  GOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!

This dish was delicious!! I did tweak it a little bit to fit the ingredients I had at hand. Instead of tree nuts I used pecans. I did find that the dried cranberries became a little too hard fory liking after I cooked them. I followed others' advice and removed the nuts and cranberries after 2 mins and added the at the end when the asparagus was ready. But over all it was a great recipe!! :D

I loved this recipe , however, the best compliment is that my husband and daughters that normally do not eat asparagus, love it. Made it last week and I am making again tonight.

VERY good, but getting the nuts and craisins to cook "just right" is a trick.  I had to make 15 servings, so I cooked the asparagus in several different batches, while keeping the cooked ones warm in the oven.  Then I did the cranberries and nuts in the last pan.  I would say 4 minutes tops!!  At 6 minutes, the craisins basically turned into candy pieces.  I poured the nut mixture over the asparagus and sprinkled with feta cheese - HUGE hit with no left-overs.  (I used 1/2 c pine nuts, 1/2 c slivered almonds, 1 c craisins for 15 servings)

This is a delicious way to eat asparagus.  I removed the pine nuts and cranberries from the pan when the pine nuts turned brown and then added the asparagus.  (I don't have much experience with pine nuts, but they never looked translucent to me.  Maybe I should have cooked them longer, but I was afraid they'd burn.)

This was good. I found the cranberries sticky, more sticky than normal, but it was a nice change. I will make this again for sure.

Either way I really like this dish, but I actually like it better without the cranberries. The pine nuts are a must though.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! I used almonds instead of the pine nuts, simply because the pine nuts were rather expensive, and I found that almonds could be used as a suitable substitute for them, and it turned out great. I've made this recipe twice so far, and it's definitely staying in my side dish rotation for a very long time. :)

Really delicious, but pine nuts are expensive!!  Definitely steam asparagus first then toss with nuts/cranberries and oil.  Top with feta.

Delicious! Next time I will steam the asparagus separately, as suggested by many others. I will also cut it into smaller pieces first. I might also cut the pine nuts and cranberries down to 1/4 c for 4 servings as well. But great idea and great taste!!

The combination of flavors in this dish are great, but I will be making some changes the next time I make it:

Steam the asparagus instead of sauteing it (I found that it was too oily feeling for my taste).  

Add feta cheese on top (which is in the picture, but not in the recipe).

Add a little pepper or other seasoning to accent the other flavors a little.

Loved this! I toasted the pine nuts and gently steamed the asparagus ahead of time. Made it quicker to make. A beautiful dish for the holidays, too! I think I'd add feta or goat cheese next time for fun. Thank you!

I really really enjoyed this recipe! I pretty much did all the steps in reverse by first cooking the asparagus in olive oil and then adding the pine nuts (which came pre packaged as 'toasted') and then the cranberries. I served it over penne pasta to make it a main dish, and might try white rice next time. After everything was plated, I sprinkled some goat cheese on top. I'll def try this again!

I took the advice of other reviewers and steamed the asparagus first then cut it into  pieces.  I used about 1/4 cup nuts to cut down on calories and cooked them with raisins (what I had on hand) before adding the steamed asparagus.  I used 1 TB olive oil.  It was perfect.  The combination of flavors was a great surprise.  Delicious!

This is easy, delicious, and beautiful on the plate.  I definately suggest to saute the pine nuts and cranberries together, remove and then saute the asparagus so the nuts aren't burned.  Combine them at the end and top with feta.  Fabulous!

Followed the advice of others and sauteed the pine nuts and cranberries first, so they wouldn't get overdone...but even after adding to the asparagus the dish was kinda bland and definitely needed more seasoning.

It was good, but it was WAY too much olive oil as well as nuts and cranberries.It was really greasy and my stomach was kind of hurting. I got full half way eating. Next time I'll put less nuts/cranberries and olive oil, as well as cooking it a bit longer because I like it a bit charred.

My son made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was loved by all. While he roasted the asparagus  in the oven, he sauteed the pinenuts & cranberries for a few minutes. Then sprinkled the mixture on top of the asparagus, on a serving plate. Great recipe!

Loved it and easy to make. Liked the sweetness from the dried cranberries contrasting with the savouriness of the pine nuts and asparagus.

I had some pine nuts to use up and decided to try this asparagus recipe.  It was good, but a little oily.  I feel the oil could have been cut in half.  The cranberries and asparagus was a nice combination.

In theory, this is good.  The problem is that it isn't easy to get everything together on the fork and mine came out a little oily.  I say average.  It didn't blow me away but it wasn't bad either.

This was good......REAL good. I followed the instructions to a T except that I didn't have pine nuts....but I did have slivered almonds and used those instead. Also, I used one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil instead of three....although I do LOVE olive oil I don't like having an "oily feeling" on my veggies. I did a taste test at the end and I decided that next time it will need 1 or 2 garlic cloves minced in. YUM! Thank you!

Made this for a very picky family on Thanskgiving and it was gone! Be sure to saute the cranberries and pine nuts on low heat. Also do not recommend doing this in cast iron they are way too hot and will scorch the cranberries. Use a lighter pan and keep things moving-dont let them sit for too long. Although its not included we added feta cheese on top after it came off the pan and it was amazing!

As some suggested, used Craisins, pine nuts, pecans, and a little garlic.  Removed from heat after pine nuts and garlic became translucent.  Topped with Feta as suggested.  Beautiful and delicious -- and nutritious.  Thanks!

Recipe has potential bu the pine nuts scorched. I will try again and add more salt, perhaps garlic salt and top with pine nuts when serving .

My 13 year old son made this.  He objected first, when I asked him to follow this recipe.  He wanted to just cook plain asparagus.  When he served this, it was beautiful and delicious!  Simple, easy, delicious!

I steamed the asparagus beforehand and once the pine nuts and cranberries were done (be careful - pine nuts cook really fast on a gas range!) I removed them from the oil and used the same oil for the asparagus. I topped the asparagus with the mixture once it was plated and added a bit of feta. The flavor was good, I am going to try fresh cranberries next time so they will be a little less chewy.

Delicious & very colorful dish--a big hit for Thanksgiving dinner. I followed another reviewer's suggestion: sautéed pine nuts & craisins, then added steamed asparagus right before serving.  Wonderful flavor!

This was a wonderful combination of flavors. I used dried Michigan cherries instead of cranberries. I also took  the advice of a couple of reviewers and I steamed the asparagus. Also, I found that 3 tablespoons of oil was waaay too much and ended up dumping out almost all of it. After that, my pinenuts browned up nicely. Will definately make this again.

Wonderful! Made for thanksgiving and it disappeared! Super easy, I used steam in the bag asparagus and then moved it to the pan so I didn't worry about burning the pine nuts.

Very good...and simple. I wouldn't 'cook' the cranberries w/ the pine nuts tho. I would wait when I added the asparagus. Some of the cranberries got almost burned. Very good recipe tho!

Greasy - way too much olive oil.  Pine nuts never got translucent and were too toasted.  We ate the asparagus, but tossed the recipe.

I made this as a side dish on Thanksgiving. It was very good and  something different for a change. Easy to make. The only change was that I removed the cranberries and nuts (so they wouldn't get overdone) before cooking the asparagus and then added them back. I would definitely make again.
