Hi, I am Indian and cook mostly Indian food for my family. I came on allrecipes looking for something different than what I'm used to. For this recipe, let me say straight off the bat--all Indian/Pakistani curries have garlic and ginger paste. The most common way is to throw it in the beginning when frying onions. Also, if you're old school, use fresh tomatoes (paste cuts down the time, I guess). I've never used coconut milk and tomato paste in the same recipe myself, but that's an interesting combination. For the red pepper--a pinch is not sufficient. It will be too bland, at least 1 tsp. I would add all the spices in the beginning when frying the onions, then put the chicken and THEN the tomatoes. Definitely more spices or this will be too bland (try cumin powder, coriander powder, etc). I hope this helps someone.

This recipe is the easiest Indian recipe i've seen so far and tastes so good! If you like extra sauce though, I would suggest you use a little more than 1/2 can of lite/regular coconut milk instead. This insures that you will have enough sauce to eat over rice with. Also, I didn't have any cilantro on hand so I didn't use it. I did however, add more tumeric and cumin until it tasted strong enough because I like my Indian dishes very articulate. I served this with basmati rice and naan, so delicious!

Per others reviews, I doubled the cumin and turmeric. I used tsp. cumin seed and 1 tsp. ground cumin. I didn't have chili paste, so I used 1 tbsp. sriracha sauce instead. Since sriracha already has sugar in it I omitted the brown sugar. It was pretty spicy. I often use coconut cream instead of coconut milk in recipes. About 3 tbsp + 1 c. water = 1 c. coconut milk. It's cheaper this way. I think next time I'll add potatoes. It was very flavorful and would be great with tofu!

This recipe would rate a 5 if the amounts of spices were doubled.  I, at the suggestion of other reviewers here, pretty much doubled the spices used. I also used ground cumin, because I was out of cumin seeds, and that was fine. I also used hot chili oil instead of chili paste and it mixed well.  Because I like savory spicy food, I tripled the amount of brown sugar in the mix and it turned out fantastic. 

Because I was looking to get some vegetables in the mix, at the last few minutes of simmering, I added some baby spinach leaves.  They were great in the mix and didn't detract from the dish.  Even my overly picky brother who "doesn't do hot" loved this.  Serve it with basmati rice and naan, and you're set.

I was so surprised by how good this is!  I didn't expect the flavors to be so intense, when I read the ingredients I thought it may be a bit too sweet, and I don't like "sweet meat" lol.  As I was cooking it, I thought there wasn't a lot of sauce, so I doubled all the sauce ingredients but left the chicken the same.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, EXCEPT I accidentally added A LOT more turmeric, because the top fell off while I was adding it!  However, it tasted really good, so I think I will always add more than the recipe calls for, say 1.5 tsp for a double sauce batch.  I also added one red chile and one green chile but I left them whole.  This gives flavor without a lot of heat.  I did that instead of the paste, along with a small sprinkle of chili powder, because I didn't have any paste.  Otherwise, I followed it as written.  It was so good!  Will certainly make again and again! Don't be too critical if you're looking for gourmet indian, because this isn't it.  But it's a fantastically flavored dish that will please a wide variety of people.

This was so good! I have zero complaints about this one. It was incredibly easy and so tasty. The recipe says the chili paste and cayenne pepper are optional, but be sure to add it. It gives it great flavor. In my opinion it wasn't spicy at all. I'm not sure what cumin SEED is or if it's the same thing, but I just used ground cumin. Very delicious!

This was an easy and yummy different way to make chicken.  It's definitely not the full flavored dish that you would get at an indian resturant but a pretty tame at-home version.

This is one WICKED GOOD recipe!  A palate pleasing blend of flavors that can be ready to serve in minutes!  I doubled the saucy ingredients and served with basmati rice.  Mahdzoon (plain yogurt) on the side.  My 20-year-old cousin deemed it "the bomb!"

So good!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and doubled up on the spices- excellent.  Even my kids (7, 4 and 2) eat it without complaint.  Thank you!

This is a great start!  I added a can of mixed veggies and really upped the spice via garlic powder and curry powder.  Also to trim some fat I didn't use the coconut milk (gasp) instead subbing plain Lowfat greek yogurt and added a dallop of sour cream when served.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!  We will use this again often!

I made this last night and it was great. Doubled the recipe and I only made one substitute, and that was the cumin seed.  When I started to prepare for the dish I did not have any cumin seed (thought I did!) so I used ground cumin and just skipped the browning and just sprinkled it on the onions at the end of their browning. It was plenty spicy. I wonder if the folks who did not think it was spicy have old expired spices, or did not follow the recipe correctly. Can't imagine it bland if made according to the directions. I did follow someone else who mentioned potatoes and peas would be good, so I did add about 2 cups cooked potatoes and 1 cup frozen peas at the end. I will be making this again.  Thanks!

This is my FAVORITE meal!  I make it with lots of vegetables and would even leave out the chicken if my husband would eat it without the meat.

I was surprised how good this turned out!  This is my first time attempting an Indian dish, and both my boyfriend and I really liked it.  I could not find cumin seed so I used ground cumin.  I agree that this does not give a very bold Indian flavor, despite doubling the spices.  But I still highly recommend this to anyone who is new at cooking Indian dishes.

This was delicious!  I read several reviews of this dish, and took advise from one of the cooks who happens to be Indian.  I added minced garlic and ginger paste with the spices in the beginning, and I added about 3/4 of a can of whole peeled tomatoes AFTER adding the chicken. I definitely used more cayenne than called for, as well as coconut milk.  I will definitely make this again!!

A great recipe but not enough spice. Didn't taste salty & spicy enough, so I had to add curry powder. Not sure if it's because I didn't use the hot chili paste...

I love this recipe.  Like one of the other reviewers, I used double the cumin and brown sugar and used hot chili oil.  I also added cornstarch to thicken it up.  Someone made the comment that this recipe was too bland.  I can't imagine it.  Mine came out rich and savory.

So good and so easy!  I made this in 15min!  Yum.  I did modify it to my liking and increased the recipe.  I used 4 chicken breasts, 1 (400mL) can of coconut milk, 1 (156mL) can of tomato paste, ground cumin, turmeric, curry powder, and the addition of peas and lentils.  Everyone loved it!

It was an easy recipe to make, but I probably won't make it again. The flavor was a little bland. It had some elements that I liked (the coconut milk, the cumin seed) but overall it lacked some kick.

Too much tomato paste for my taste; my roommate liked it because she likes tomato flavor. If I make it again I might just use half of the amount of tomato paste and see if it helps.

I thought it was OK, family was not too impressed. However, I didn't follow recipe exactly; used ground cumin instead of seeds and used chili sauce instead of chili paste because that's what we had. Don't know if that made a difference or not, but probably won't make again.

I used chili flakes instead of paste and all of the coconut milk. Used just ground cumin instead of the seeds and added it with the rest of the seasonings.

I really liked this recipe. It's pretty simple and tastes great. 
Don't be skeptical when you see how thin/runny the end product is. Poor it over rice and its AMAZING! 
I am definitely adding this to my favorites recipes

Easy and tasty! Needs more seasoning, use chili paste not curry paste. More cumin, salt and pepper.

I came across this recipe on accident. But it sounded good so I made it. instead of the tomato paste I used the Ragu I had on the shelf (the tomato onion and garlic flavor) and instead of regular coconut milk, I used the coconut milk soup base unsweetened. I served mine over tri-color quinoa. It was such a huge hit with the family that we've made this a regular dish in our house! soooo good. ??????

The recipe needs more spices! It was awfully bland at the finish, so we added coriander, garlic, garam masala, a lot more red pepper, cumin powder  and chili sauce, and more salt. It was just “okay” after that. I wouldn’t make it again.

This was a fun dish to make! I made for my family (traditional Sunday dinner) and thankfully over-cooked, because everyone was asking for left-overs on Monday. One addition to the recipe: I added was 2 cans of Chickpeas, which was mixed during the last stage after all ingredients were in the pot - simmering for the last 15 minutes. It fit in well with the flavors, and nice consistency with the rice. I will definitely make this again!

Easy to make.  You can use cooked chicken for faster preparation. The second time I substituted Stewed tomatoes and serve with rice.. Don't miss this one.  Everyone enjoyed the taste and seasoning and we had time to enjoy without spending lot's of time  in the kitchen ..

I made this a few days ago.  Doubled the recipe on the sauce. All my family loved.  I made it early and kept it on warm in the crockpot for couple of hours.  I used jasmine rice because I didn’t have basmati.  It was delicious.  You can ramp up the spices to your taste. I kept it mild for the kids.

I made this last night and it was a great success. My husband and I really liked it. 
I did change up the ingredients just a bit because I was short of, or out of, some items. 
Instead of all the tomato paste I added 2 tbsp of chili sauce along with 2 tbsp of paste. I also added cardamom, curry powder and garam masala instead of the chili paste, as didn’t have it in hand and thought it would work. I think another time I might add some garlic and ginger. 
Anyway it was a very easy, tasty dish and I will definitely make it again.

I made this dish last night and doubled it for company.  Definitely not enough flavour, so I added  2 teaspoons each of curry powder and  garam masala, and a half cup of chopped, dried apricots.

I followed the recipe exactly as written but doubled the ingredients. This turned out to be an overwhelming success with my family. I served the chicken over Jasmine Thai rice, which I toasted with aromatics (allspice, cloves, cinnamon sticks, crushed and cardamom seeds. Then I made the rice according to the directions (2 cups  jasmine Thai rice to 2-1/2 cups of water a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of butter.l opened a can of coconut water by mistake (should have been coconut milk, so I used 2 cans of the coconut water with the remainder in water to make up the difference. The rice was a big hit with the Indian Chicken. Requests have already been made for future Indian Chicken dinners (I cook more and bring enough over to my 90 and 92 year old parents to save them from cooking every day.  They absolutely loved the chicken and the rice. This is a real winner and will be one of my go to dishes that I will rotate with other recipes to ensure a happy and satisfied crowd.  Well Done!

Did not have chili paste, so used a smidgen of wasabi.  Also added some curry.  The sauce was still a little bland, so added more salt and pepper 'to taste' :)  
It was really great.

Husband loved this.  Made it in the crockpot.  Started by sautéing the onions and seeds in a skillet, threw everything else in the crockpot.  Chicken breasts were frozen.  Cooked it till chicken fell apart then adjusted the seasonings at the end.  Put in about three times seasoning and also added the whole can of coconut milk.  Sautéed veggies in coconut oil.  Added a 14 oz can tomato sauce and water until it was a consistency that I liked.  Served over basmati rice with cumin seeds and green peas.

The recipe as written is ok.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  It had a good flavor, but kind of bland.  Next time I will double the sauce and quadruple the spices.

Super simple to make. Quite good. Not nearly as good as Indian butter chicken!

I doubled all of the spices as recommended. It was great. My husband said it still wasn't spicy enough, but that's just him in general.

I made this dish and it was so delicious and easy!  Taste very authentic...I even surprised myself! I didn't use cilantro because I didn't have any, but I would of if I did, because I love it.   I added more hot chile paste and cayenne pepper, because I like my food spicy.  I added a little more water than asked to thin the thick coconut milk.  Very easy and everyone loved it..will definitely make again.

This is a good, easy, Indian-ish dish.  I add extra chili sauce to it and use light coconut milk.  I will make it again.

Very good and easy!  I used a full can of coconut milk, and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce in place of the water and tomato paste, as I read in other reviews that there was not a sufficient amount of liquid.  I also added a little garam masala, and everyone really liked it, even the baby.  No left-overs!  I made brown rice instead of white, and we had VALONE's Indian Saag on the side, with homemade paneer in it.

This is a mild Indian dish that most people would probably like.  There's nothing wild or exciting about it, so it is good for those who are inexperienced or wary of Indian cuisine.  I used light coconut milk to cut down on the fat, and I was still creamy and rich.  Definitely serve this over rice -- it goes well with basmati.  A friend of mine expressed concern that cooking this type of cuisine would leave a smell in her house, but there's no need for concern with this recipe.

Tastes good.  But as per my normal thoughts the milk stands out.

It was really easy to make, but it didn't turn out at all like I expected. I followed the user suggestions, but it was still a bit bland. It got fairly good reviews, but it just lacks that good Indian food kick.

I have to say I was disappointed in this recipe.  I was hoping for something flavorful and this was very bland.  It wasnt bad... but I probably wouldnt make it again.

An enjoyable dish and not difficult to make for those of us not talented in the area of Indian cooking. I agree with previous writer(s) to have extra sauce as it's terrific!
