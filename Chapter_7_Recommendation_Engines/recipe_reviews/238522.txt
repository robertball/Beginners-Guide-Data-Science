Loved it and so did my sister!  I used fresh grated ginger instead of powered ( keep it peeled in my freezer cause it grates so well frozen).  I didn't have zucchini or spinach but substituted lots of fresh kale instead.  My sister even tried it COLD & loved it!  Nice herb flavors & good texture.  Thought it would be too much but it was gone it two days!!

I made this pretty close to the original, just left out the zucchini and switched out the spices. 
I used 3 tsp of Ras El Hanout and tasted half way through then added 1/2 tsp more plus 1/2 tsp  smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. 
Served with falafel which paired well together.

My husband and I LOVED this meal, and we are meat folks, so having a soup with all veggies made my husband a little skeptical. However, the flavors and how FILLING it is was so shocking! Awesome alternative to a meaty soup.

I used more fresh ingredients.  Minced ginger, fresh tarragon, diced tomatoes from my garden (peeled and seeded). I also added 2 carrots and 32 oz vegetable stock. There was a lot of leftovers and froze some so I won't be making it soon but I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't have any vegetable broth so I used 3 cups of crushed tomatoes, 2 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water. The lentils I used were from Trader Joe's and were pre cooked  so I added them with the zucchini and spinach.  It is very flavorful and the vegetables were not mushy.

This is a fantastic recipe. The flavor is great. I added 2 fat cloves of garlic just because I put garlic in everything but it'd be awesome with or without it.

To me, this came out more like a stew than a soup. Regardless, its flavor was marvelous, and I'll be making it again!

Except for chicken broth rather than vegetable, I actually followed this recipe.  Homey, but good.  A little pepper sauce would be welcome.  Good as is though.  'Makes a lot, more than seven servings. Update:  Day of, just right or a bit shy of right amount of salt.  Later,  too salty.  Maybe Kosher salt didn’t dissolve on the day made.

I made this wonderful soup in my crock pot! I followed the recipe until mixing in the broth and lentils. I used organic vegetable broth and Organic lentilsI to my crock pot and let it simmer all night. In the morning I added the fresh organic zucchini and spinach from my gardens last picking and let that simmer till cooked. We spooned it over a mixture of organic brown, red and black rice! Amazing! A definite keeper??

Excellent soup with lots of veggies and a very nicely balanced spice blend. It went over really really well with my family and I'll be making it again and again. I gave some to my neighbour who has a "my body is a temple" mentality. Had to show him the recipe, which he approved...lol. He came by later to rave about the taste, the textures, and all those lovely lentils.(I used green and red).  Two thumbs up, and of course five stars. great recipe and a yummy soup.

I added some extra veggies from the garden just because I needed to use them; this would still have been wonderful without them. I added sour cream to mine.

Excellent recipe. My wife, who does not like lentil soup, loved this. Used up some Kale instead of using spinach - worked great.  Also left out the zucchini but may include it next time.  Will definitely make it again.

This is a great go-to soup for cold days and visitors!  Made very few changes; I added garlic, used fresh ginger, also added extra salt and pepper - maybe because I used bone broth and the taste was minimal.  Tasted better with the added s + p.  Also I used my vitamix for the onions and carrots instead of chopping them.   I liked the very small pieces to compliment the lentils size wise.

Had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand- dry parsley, chicken stock instead of veg.  Also cut oil down a bit.  Better the next day!

Delicious.  Used only 6 cups of chicken broth and it was perfect.  might try adding a little garlic next time.

My husband doesn't like anything that's at all spicy, so I left out the cumin. It's still fantastic! I wasn't sure how it would turn out since the onions and carrots were essentially puréed, but it didn't matter. I used fresh spinach and tubed ginger. I am set for soup for the week!!
