Best deviled eggs I ever tasted!  I add Old Bay seasoning to mine, top with a petite shrimp and sprinke with more Old Bay. I'm asked to make the deviled eggs for every BBQ and they're always the first to go! Everyone loves them!

Yes, they're creamy; however, they lack in taste. I'm going to keep searching for a better recipe.

Simple and to the point. Personally, I think there was a bit too much cream cheese; I'm going to use 4oz next time. It did have a good flavor. Normally I only use mayo and mustard. Plus I had a lot of extra filling left over. I also did not add the vinegar simply because I did not have any. I'm certainly going to make these again.

these were very good, creamy and yummy...maybe i'd give them 4.5 if i could, but they could use some extra flavor for some zip...

This has been my go-to deviled egg recipe for about three years. I make them exactly as the recipe states and put the filling in a plastic bag, cut the tip, and it fills the egg perfectly.  I sprinkle a teeny bit of paprika on each one (hides imperfections) and they're ready to go! Excellent (I used restraint from saying eggs-elent) BBQ appetizer for under $5! The perfect egg!

I appreciate what this recipe is trying to do, however, Grey Poupon is just not enough to flavor these eggs. I would suggest taking the cream cheese from this recipe and adding it to your own deviled egg recipe which probably has a lot more to offer.
