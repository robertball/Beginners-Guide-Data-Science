AMAZING! I halved this recipe but wish I made a full batch so I could freeze some.  The only thing about it that I changed was that I used Indian Malasa instead of curry and used a bit more than the recipe called for. Will be making this again soon.

This is my favorite soup in the world.  I make it with 3 teaspoons of curry and low sodium vegetable broth.  I also add a teaspoon of cardamon and a teaspoon of cumin.  YUMMY!

This was delicious! It's very hearty, and the yogurt gives it a great tanginess. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to use a little more curry powder.

I added more curry to the recipe but wish I wouldn't have. The curry overwhelmed the other flavors in the dish. It would have been better as is for our tastes. I like the toasted almonds. My picky 2-year-old liked it enough to dip her carrot sticks in it, so that makes it a repeat recipe in our house.

As I like the flavor of butternut squash I was disappointed when the other spices were so strong that they covered up the squash flavor. Won't make again, sorry.

Huh, this appears to be a knock off recipe from Jiko's restaurant at Animal Kingdom lodge in WDW.  They use a golden squash though.

Only one word required.... YUM!! (except I nixed the yogurt cuz I can't have dairy anymore, I'm guessing it would be twice as good if I could put in the yogurt)

I have never written a review before and I use this site all the time.  All I have to say is WOW!  I did add a little more curry and cut back on the broth to make a little thicker.   Will make again and again.

This is a great recipe.  I added a bit more curry powder than what the recipe.  I love the texture the almonds give the soup.  Husband loved it too.

Good, but I tweaked a lot to get the favoring just right. Otherwise, it would have been too bland.
