This is not Henry Bains sauce--It is Jezabell Sauce and should be served over Cream Cheese with Crackers---If you would like Henry Bains sauce I would be glad to send it to you---Gerri

This recipe made a huge amount! I would have made a smaller amount but didn't want 4 opened jars of preserves taking up room in my refrigerator. If I ever make this again... I will make a smaller amount and use much less horseradish... it was much too hot and bitter for my family's taste.

This is not Henry Bain's sauce. None of these ingredients are in Henry Bain's sauce. : )
Also, Henry Bain sauce is not also known as Jezebel sauce. There must be some mix up.

It is a good sauce but it is not Henry Bain Sauce, not even close. This is Jezebel sauce and like Gerri said should be served over cream cheese.

I haven't yet made this recipe, but I'm writing because I'm interested in the "Henry Bain Sauce" that Gerri (a previous reviewer) mentioned; I've heard of it and have wanted a recipe for it.  I've made Jezebel Sauce before and also purchased some at our Renaissance Fair......it's good stuff!  Kind of habit-forming!  But the recipe I followed had fewer ingredients, only apricot preserves and orange marmalade along with the horseradish.  And Geri's right, it's great as a dip/spread, served over cream cheese.  I'll try this one soon and write back.

While not able to find apple preserves and cutting down on the amount of prepared mustard and using extra hot horseradish, this was still a nice compliment to a country ham sandwich.

This is NOT Henry Bain Sauce, but is similar to Jezebel Sauce as several have pointed out.
