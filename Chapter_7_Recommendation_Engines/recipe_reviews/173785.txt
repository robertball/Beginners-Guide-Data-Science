I made this appetizer and it was a big hit.  I used fresh herbs from my garden and served it with crudite.

Didn't have green onion, sour cream, tarragon...but it tastes great subbing cream cheese for the sour cream; and though it's missing some critical flavors, it's not lacking at all.

Also, lacking a blender or food processor at the moment, I simply cut the shrimp into really small pieces.

I'm not a Low-Fat person, so I'm not sure how hard-core mayo and cream cheese alter the flavor.

Definitely a "keeper!"

This was REALLY good except it was a little too mayonaisse-y tasting the first day.  The second day it was perfect somehow...

This was a hit at at recent BBQ. I use what I have on hand so I did modify the recipe. Omitted mayo, carrots and onion ( so many people are sensitive to fresh onion) used cream cheese, sweet peppers, onion powder. The fresh herbs are key to this recipe. The next morning I put some on an English muffins topped with Swiss cheese and sliced tomatoes and broiled it...yummy.

I made some minor changes: used 3/8 tsp each dried tarragon and rosemary instead of fresh, omitted chili powder, and used probably more like 3 Tablespoons carrot. The 6 year old didn't like it, but the adults did.

This dip was a hit for both events.  It pairs nicely with pretzel bread sliced in rounds & toasted.  I chopped everything by hand wanting a specific size for shrimp. I left out the carrot & onion only because I didn't have it handy the first time - why change a good thing, right?

This was the best shrimp dip I've ever had! I substituted fat free sour cream for low fat, came out great!
