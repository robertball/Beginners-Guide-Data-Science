Very Good...didn't give 5 stars because of the changes I made. I made quite a few and used the smaller bite size mushrooms, 1  lb Ground Hot Italian Sausage and mixed with the 8oz Cream Cheese...the consistency was perfect that way. Seems like it would be too much cream cheese by the recipe. I also chopped some stems and added to the sausage mixture then  sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and baked at 400 for about 10 minutes.

I make these all time! I use Jimmy Dean Sage or Spicy sausage. I also put the sausage in a food processer to make the sausage finer. It blends easier with the cream cheese and the mushrooms are easier to stuff. It takes a little longer put worth the effort for presentation.

I make these for pot lucks and sometimes just for dinner with the family.  I also pour some melted butter on top and sprinkle them with colby/jack cheese before putting them in the oven.  It makes them moister and creates a pretty marbled look.

These are awesome - I've been making this recipe for years. I've made lots of other good stuffed mushrooms, but these are goof-proof and always get asked for (no matter how many times I tell people how to make them). I usually use sage sausage and add some hot pepper flakes, or vice versa. My neice has been helpping me make these at Thanksgiving since she was 3 - I make the filling before she gets here and she wears my apron and fills all the mushrooms. Great tradition, and so easy to pull off. Thanks for posting this one!!

I'm glad I tasted one of these before stuffing the rest of them or serving because they were quite bland.  I used a whole pound of sausage with the 8 oz. of cream cheese and added salt and fresh ground pepper.  THEN, they were very good and people raved.  Slightly greasy so next time I will drain the sausage better.  Also, I baked at 350 for about 10 minutes and then broiled for a couple of minutes.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was so easy and delicious.  I got rave reviews and the were gone in minutes.  The only change I make when making them was to dip the tops in bread crumbs after I stuffed them.   This way they had a nice looking crust on the top.

Very good! I did make a few changes.  I made them twice, once with spicy breakfast sausage, and once with italian sausage.  Both very good.  I also added oregano, basil, garlic, and salt.  In addition, I drizzled the baking pan with a bit of olive oil to give the mushrooms some moistness, and cooked at 400 for about ten minutes instead of broiling.  Great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years!  They are SO good, can't stop eating at just one!  I sometimes add onions, some of the mushroom stems chopped fine or some hot sauce for a little heat.  Easy and delicious!!

Have been making these for years and here is the "real deal" on how they should be done: one pound of cream cheese (not the low fat kind)and one pound of hot italian sausage (or regular italian if you don't want the heat) - NOT breakfast sausage. Brown sausage, break into smallish pieces, drain and add cream cheese. Mix together and fill mushrooms. Sprinkle with paprika and bake at 375 for 30 minutes. The sausage provides enough flavor that you don't need to add anything else. The longer cooking time cooks the mushrooms all the way through and browns the tops so you don't need bread crumbs. Try it and see the difference for yourself!

Because of the cream cheese, it could be on the bland side.  It probably would taste better with spicier sausages.

These are simple and great. I've made them twice, and they all disappear fast! 
I found that I needed to use 1 1/4 pounds mushrooms to use up all of the filling.

They were tasty, but too rich. Perhaps they would be suitable for a party, where any one person may only eat one or two, but you really can't eat more than that.

Completed recipe exactly as suggested. Some people loved them; others only ate a nibble. I think it was very rich for those peeps. But it was a super easy themed appetizer for my daughter's bday party.

So awesome and easy!!  I change 3 things: 1lb of sausage, keep the stems (cook them with the sausage), and add 3/4 c. shredded parmesan cheese to the stuffing mix, and sprinkle 3/4c of shredded parm over mushrooms before baking!  I also put the sausage/stems into the food processor before adding the parm and stuffing the mushroom caps - makes it WAY easier to keep all the good stuff inside the mushroom!

Very good! I added chopped mushroom stems, garlic powder, sage, red pepper flakes, salt & pepper, and used a full lb. of sausage. I baked for 10 mins then broiled for a couple more. Mmmm....

This is only a 5 star with my modifications.  Use one pound of Jimmy Dean's spicy/hot sausage and 8oz cream cheese.  Top mushrooms with shredded parmesan cheese and bake.  There are never any leftovers.  Even people who don't like mushrooms love these.

Used Italian sausage and threw in some fresh chopped basil. Bake the mushrooms instead broiling them; 400 degrees for 13 minutes.

These are great! Cream Cheese and sausage are the two main ingredients. I add minced garlic, garden onions and chopped cooked spinach to mine. I use hot italian sausage and I usually top with a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesean. Yum

I suppose it's a matter of personal taste, but I felt like this had *way* too much cream cheese. I read several reviews after I made them that said they baked them, not just broiled, which I think is a good idea. I also like the idea of adding some parm and perhaps a *few* bread crumbs or other seasoning and the idea of pulsing the stuffing mixture in a food processor a bit to make it smoother. I'll try them again with those changes and I have a feeling I'll like them better.

I made these for my boyfriends birthday. All his friends said they were just like something their moms made when they were little.  They ate them all before they were even a comfortable temperture to try. I would like to try the suggestions of using the mushroom stems in the mix, or other veggies, but this already makes an uneven ratio of filling to caps. I'll make it a point to search for bigger mushroom or buy more small ones next time. Delicious!

I use half the amount of cream cheese called for. After mixing the cream cheese and sausage together, I roll it into a log and refrigerate the filling. It's much easier to fill the mushrooms that way. After stuffing the mushrooms I roll the stuffed side in parmesan cheese, then in panko breadcrumbs. I've been told that I can't come to my friend's house without a pan of these ready to go into the oven! LOL

They were ok. Not a lot of flavor and i added spices. I added panko crumbs on top and they helped. Too bland.

Super delicious and so easy!  I did mine in the oven for about 15 minutes or so cause I wanted the bottoms to get warm and not just the tops.  Great recipe!

So good, so easy!  I upped the sausage to 1 lb. for my carnivore husband, but I will try just the 1/2 lb next time.  I chopped up the stems and sauteed them with the sausage, and dipped the tops in Italian bread crumbs.  Definitely need at least 2 pkgs of mushrooms.

Very good and very easy.  My twist on it:  Used 12 oz of Framer John's pork chorizo (and blotted as much of the grease out as possible a couple of times), 8 oz. cream cheeze, probably about 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs, 1/2 onion, chopped.  Cooked the chorizo.  Drained and blotted.  Added chopped onions and chopped mushroom stems.  Cooked.  Blotted again.  Stirred in cream cheese.  Put into a baggie and cut about 1/4" opening in 1 corner to fill mushrooms.  Worked GREAT and fun too!  I had 15 oz of crimini mushrooms.  Had to go get another 15 oz of mushrooms to use all of the filling and fill a jelly roll pan with them.  Will bake as others suggest.  Excellent.  Easy and fun.

Wow, these are super easy and so fast to make!  I personally hate the texture of mushrooms, and while this recipe doesn't change that, it does make them much easier to choke down! LOL. I used 1lb sage sausage, chive & onion cream cheese and about 9 large mushrooms.  One thing I ALWAYS do is brush the mushrooms with a little melted butter to help moisten/soften them a bit. It helps! These did come out fairly rich tasting, so be aware. Overall, fantastic. Thanks!

These are awesome!  I added some chives and chopped up about 3 green onions and added that as well.  My husband thought that he died and went to heaven.  I didn't broil them for fear of charring them, so I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Did I mention how easy they are to make as well?  Total gourmet flavor! They're so good that I'm making them again tonight!

This recipe was a hit! I took the advice of others and used garlic powder, minced scallions, minced mushroom stems, salt and pepper. I was making this for a crowd so I doubled the recipe of mushrooms and cream cheese (16 oz each) and used one roll of sage sausage. I had a lot of mixture left over. I topped the stuffed mushrooms with a mix of parmesean/asiago/romano cheese, paprika for color, and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes (shoud have used more) Next time I will use minced garlic instead of the powder for more flavor.

I just finished prepping  these for Thanksgiving - I followed the recipe but seasoned the sausage with some garlic and onion.  I also added some italian bread crumbs and grated parmesan to the sausage/cc mix, and plan on sprinkling the top of the mushrooms with it tomorrow before I pop them in the oven.
I made these ahead and refrigerated in aluminum pans - they are all ready to go tomorrow in the oven!  One less thing to do on Thanksgiving!!

I make these every Thanksgiving. I use 1 lb Sausage, 8 oz Cream Cheese, & 2 lbs of mushrooms. I use the stems & scoop some of the flesh out of the mushrooms too. I chop the stems & flesh in the food processor & add it to the sausage when I brown it. Then I add the cream cheese & stuff them.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I've been making these little appetizers for years, since I was a teen (DECADES).  I use spicy sausage & use a potato masher after sausage is cooked to minimize large chunks.  For those who think these are bland, I've always added finely chopped green onions right after adding the cream cheese which is the last few minutes of cooking.  One extra ingredient makes a huge difference.  At times I've minced the mushroom stems, but usually I save those for breakfast burritos the next morning.  Like deviled eggs, no matter how many you make, there are never any left.  Kinda makes you wonder who the originator of this recipe is, and how long ago did they come up with it??

I have to say...I didnt love these. My parents did, though, they really loved them! I felt they were lacking in flavor, they needed something. Maybe because I actually made them EXACTLY as they said, and didnt add anything extra like others did. I saw on some other reviews that people used spicy sausage..that might have been good. Maybe if I try these again I will do that.

I tried the recipe 4 times once with pork sausage and the second time with the Italian sausage. In both cases there is just too much cream cheese. It turned out better the second times I made this by cutting the cream cheese by half. With the pork sausage I suggest seasoning it to taste with McCormicks pork seasoning. I also added minced onion. I added minced garlic in the Italian sausage and no other seasoning. I topped both with mozzarella cheese.

Very good and very easy.  Made a more filling than I could stuff mushrooms with but probably due to different size mushrooms and what not.  Thinking about trying the extra in a quesadilla.  Would definitely make again!

Good, but  a little bland as written.  I did taste the filling first and then added chopped green onion, parmesan cheese, black pepper, and a little fresh garlic.   Baked rather than broil.

I would give 10 stars!  So easy and delicious!  I used sage sausage, a 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and a dash of hot sauce, then dunked the tops of the caps in a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  Baked 10 minutes, broiled for 2 minutes.  Took these to a party and they were gone in record time!

Very good. Simple and quick. Like some of the other comments, I, too, broiled for 10 minutes instead of the recommended 2-3. Thank you for sharing.

Dont recommend...the renaissance stuffed mushroom recipe found on this site is Much better! First of all the stuffing really leaves a lot to be desired.  Needs something more, recommend S&P, red pepper, chives and some cheese. Ect.  But mostly the biggest problem is...the 2-3 mins in broiler is NOT enough to cook the mushrooms.  Browns the stuffing wonderfully on top of raw mushrooms.  I threw back into the normal oven at 350 for another 15 mins to fully cook them.

I made these for a party.  Everyone loved them.  I doubled the filling and they made about 40 mushrooms.  Baked them at 350 for about 25 minutes, then broiled them for about 2 minutes.  I also sprinkled mozz. cheese on top before I broiled them.  Delicious!!

I doubled this recipe cuz it's sooo good! You have to make these changes though, it makes them amazing!Remember these changes are on a doubled recipe. I used 2 tubes of jimmy dean Italian sausage, not regular, Add about 8 cloves of garlic, 2 bunches of chopped green onion, and you MUST add about 3/4th of the chopped stems if you love a JUICY mushroom, if not this recipe tends to be too dry. Then top each one off with some mozzarella cheese! It makes ALOT of filling if you do it that way, so you may want to buy extra mushrooms. About 5 pre-packaged medium-large mushrooms does the trick. I also did not broil them, I just preheated the oven to 350 and it took around 10 minutes, I put the cookie sheet of them on the middle tray or even 2nd to bottoms so the bottoms are cooked well, once you see some juices run and the bottoms are soft their ready to eat!

This recipe was very good!!! They were all gone in minutes at my Halloween part last night.  And I even made the mistake of using 1 lb. of sausage instead of the 1/2 lb. called for.  I did like the consistency that way.  As others suggested I may experiment with adding the stems, garlic and cheddar cheese next time.  Also agree with others that they need to be baked for 10 minutes at 400 rather than broiled for 2-3.  Fantastic!!  Thanks for sharing.

These are delicious.  Simple to make and everybody loves them.  After removing the stems from the mushrooms, I cut up just a few of the stems into small pieces to add to the sausage/cream cheese mixture. Adds a little more texture to the filling. Thanks for the recipe.

I don't normally like mushrooms, but  when a friend insisted that I make stuffed mushrooms for her baby shower I gladly obliged.  These mushrooms turned out spectacular and I am pleased to announce that even I like them! I added sauteed diced onions and garlic. Delish!!!

my wife made these one year for Xmas dinner, everyone was shocked, but slowly took a couple and nibbled in... they were a hit, and now (7years) later they are traditional in our xmas dinner and a few times throughout the year just because. mjnce green onion in the sausage and cream cheese mix and let cool on wire rack or the juices will turn the caps soggy and have a very pungent earthy taste, unless you like that.

Great! I used 1/3 cream cheese and the rest feta, Monterey Jack, and then topped with mozzarella. You could easily customize the cheeses to your taste or to match your menu.

I cooked and grounded up Chilli Cheddar Sausages (3) of them, Low fat Cream cheese and a couple of sprinkles of Zatarans, cooked at 350 for 15, broil at 400 for 10 and they were absolutely amazing!

I was looking for a lower-carb recipe, and with some slight tweaking, this turned out great. I thought it was a bit bland when using regular breakfast sausage, so I recommend using hot sausage if you like a little heat. In addition, I did add some salt, pepper and garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture. One last thing - need to drain the sausage well after cooking or they are very greasy - I will make sure to drain on paper towels before adding to the cream cheese next time. Hubby liked them a lot!

I used this idea as the basis for my own version.  Would have given the original recipe more stars, but I found them a little bland.  I've made them with both sweet and hot Italian sausage; I prefer the hot, but I like things spicy.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese, and added fresh sauteed garlic and onion, chopped mushroom, a little chopped fresh spinach, wilted, and a scant handfull of Panko breadcrumbs.  I used portobello mushroom caps, brushed them with a little evoo, and broiled them cup side down for a few minutes, then patted them dry.  I  flipped the caps over and stuffed them, sprinkled with a little shredded parm and drizzled with a little butter.  Baked at 400 for about 15 minutes,  then broiled for a minute ot two, watching closely.  Not exactly lo-cal, but delicious!

I first enjoyed mushrooms similar to these at a bed and breakfast, then I made some myself at home a few days ago. They're marvelous!  Although I did make a couple of alterations:
I mixed mozzerella and mild cheddar into the cap stuffing, and I also put some chedder shavings on top.  I also put panko bread crumbs on top which gave it a very pleasant little crunch.  Before stuffing my caps, though, I sauteed them in butter.  It's delicious!

They are the easiest stuffed mushrooms I make and still, everyone prefer this one to my other recipes! I add a little salt to the sausage/cream cheese mixture.

I also used the mushroom stems in the filling.  I added parm. cheese to the filling and ran it all through the food processor before stuffing the mushrooms.  It was an easy recipe and I got lots of compliments.

SO EASY! And they flew off the plate. So good. I definitely needed another 8 oz. package of large mushrooms for all the filling that the sausage and cream cheese make. Next time, I might use smaller mushrooms because the large ones can be difficult to eat "gracefully". Haha. Also, I followed another reviewers comment and added some oil on the foil of the baking sheet before I placed the mushrooms on them to keep them moist and boy did it ever! Great idea!

These were very good, however, I felt like they were missing a little something. I also added a 10oz. box of frozen spinach, which added a nice touch. Next time I think I will cook some onions and garlic with the sausage for extra flavor, and maybe a little salt and pepper too. I will definately make these again. Everyone really did enjoy them! Thanks for posting. :)

Really good. I used one poster's suggestion: pulse the sausage in a food processor. The consistency is perfect. A couple of things I did slightly different: I sauteed the caps on both sides before stuffing, and baked them for 15 minutes rather than broiled them. I also had a little leftover stuffing which I spread on piece of bred and baked in the oven on a cookie sheet. That was good, too!

I made this recipe this evening for a party, and with a few modifications, it was a HUGE hit!  I added the following to my mixture:  chopped mushroom stems green onions fresh garlic freshly cracked pepper parmesan cheese  and, I put some mozarella on top when I baked it.  Oh, and I baked it for 10-15 minutes on 350 because my broiler is a scorcher!  This was the most talked about item on tonight's menu, and the menu wasn't skimpy at all!  Great share!

Very excellent!  Didn't last long at all.  I chopped up the stems and cooked them in a little bit of sausage grease and added that to the cream cheese mixture.  I felt the mixture could have used a little more sausage so I may try that next time with a few more mushrooms.  But still very good!

I've been making these for a long time. Party-goers always love these! Sometimes I make them for a quick dinner for me and my husband. When we do eat them as an entree I use fat free cream cheese to save on calories, but it really should be made with full fat cream cheese. I always add sage to the cheese/sausage mixture, and top with snipped parsley before baking.

I made these for a Christmas Eve dinner, and they went over HUGE---people loved them and couldn't believe they were so simple to make...I used Bob Evans breakfast sausage (1 lb) but next time I think I'll try the spicier sausage or add some salt and pepper...anyway, these were great!

This is an awesome starter recipe.  You can jazz these up anyway you want and it turns out great.  I added chopped garlic when frying the sausage. I also add onion powder to the mixture.  I made a bread crumb topping - melted butter, seasoned bread crumbs, dried parsley, and parmesan cheese.  I followed the advice of other to bake these for about 18 minutes.  I didn't need to broil them the crumb topping was golden brown.  They were delicious.  Took them to a party today and had the best compliment ever...I was told that by a guest that it was like a "party going on in her mouth". Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Sam.

These were good with a few changes which is why I rated a 4 star.  I added chopped onion and minced garlic to the sausage (medium spice sausage)while browning and only added one pkg of cream cheese.  Stuffed mushrooms and sprayed bottem of glass 9 x 13 pan with Pam.  Baked in 350 degree oven for 18 min and then put under broiler set on high for 2 min.  Very Good!!

I've been making these mushrooms for years and hardly ever get to taste them myself. Everyone LOVES them and are sad if I don't bring them to a function. Personally, I use the Italian or Hot sausage and it's got just the right amount of kick. I also do a light spray of olive oil on the baking sheet and mushrooms, then bake @ 350 for about 7 minutes, then broil for a few minutes to brown the top.  Depending on the amount of servings, I usually use equal parts sausage and cream cheese.

Excellent!  I made these for a New Years party and they were all gone by the end!  I used sage sausage and added red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper because I like a bit of kick and it was great. Next time I make them I will probably cut the cream cheese by a third - it was a little bit too much for my tastes.

I used hot Italian sausage and did not even bother to brown prior to putting in mushroom cabs. This way the mushrooms are softer, the way that I like them. Added grated cheese on top and baked until done. Served at a party this weekend and everyone ate them up.

When I make these I add chopped mushroom stems, chopped onion and minced garlic.  I always drain the sausage before adding to the cream cheese.  Before baking,I sprinkle the tops with finely shredded cheese.  There's never enough to go around!!

I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb mild Italian sausage and 1 lb of hot Italian sausage (that's what I had on hand).  This seemed to take care of the "blandness" others wrote about.  Also, because we like our mushrooms a little softer, I sauteed the caps in a little butter before filling them.  They came out perfectly in the broiler.  I was even able to make them ahead of time and leave them in the refridgerator until my guests arrived!

This is a delicious recipe!  My friend in college gave me this recipe after she made this for an apetizer for Thanksgiving.  I love making these because they are simple and fast, and everyone raves about them like they were gourmet.  Definitely a recipe everyone should try!

I added some mozzarella cheese and toasted breadcrumbs on top and broiled until lightly browned. They were delicious.

I made a few modifications for extra flavor and presentation.
Used hot Italian sausage and only 6 ounces of cream cheese for better consistency.  I also topped mushrooms with shaved Parmesan cheese after stuffing, and sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top followed by a sprinkle of paprika for added color.  I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes.  A final note!  I sprayed olive oil on baking sheet to keep mushrooms moist and prevent sticking to the pan.  Super Good!  All were gone very quickly!

I made several items for our New Year's celebration.  These were definitely the least favorite!  Very bland and quite tasteless.  We will not make them again.

Wow. Awesome, super simple recipe. This will be my new go-to appetizer recipe. I made it exactly per the directions and it was great. I gave it 4 stars because I felt the flavor would have been kicked up with a few additions which I will try next time. Next time I will add some chopped basil and garlic to mixture and top with some shaved Parmesan.  But, honestly the recipe was great as-is. You can't beat the ease and utter simplicity of three ingredients. Enjoy!

This recipe is very good, I did do a few things different. I used sage sausage, used equal parts sausage and cream cheese, and used the stems with the mixture. These are wonderful, my family ask me to fix these every year during the holidays.

OMG! These are divine. I halved the recipe because I was splitting the sausage with stuffing, but, WOW! These were gone in 3 minutes flat. I added a bit of cheddar cheese to the cream cheese and sausage but these were awesome. I will make these again. The plus side is they were super easy, you can make ahead and pop under the broiler.

I've made these for years.  I add green onions to the cream cheese, stuff the mushroom with cheese/green onion mixture and then add a dollop of italian sausage on top.  I sprinkle with parmesan cheese on top.  Fabulous, and you can be sure the sausage is fully cooked.

I have made these for years only instead of cream cheese I add a can of cream of mushroom soup, about 1/2 to 1 cup sour cream and sprinkle the tops with cheese.  I also bake at 350 for 20 to 30 min.  Everyone has always loved them.

Excellent!  quick easy and yummy.   I used a hot italian sausage and half the creme cheese, added some ground up italian croutons on top and a little sprinkle of mozzarela on top and threw them on the outdoor grill instead of the oven. 

They would be great as is just wanted to spice them up a bit for a family barbecue.

The only bad thing I can find is you can't quit eating them. This recipe was so fast, easy and delicious. The suggestion to use a food processor for the sausage was great. I used chicken italian sausage and they tasted just as sinful.

I added some Italian spices and minced garlic as suggested by others.  I also put cooked/drained sausage in the food processor and added the cream cheese.  I made the sausage and cc mixture the day before and stuffed the mushrooms right before the party.  I baked along with my baked brie.   I had all positive comments and a thumbs up.  I was even complimented by my "gourmet" friend.  Delicious and easy!

I had a couple changes: - substituted the sausage for 6oz bacon finely chopped - sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top before putting into oven - bake at 400 for 10min, immediately followed by broil for 2min  Overall, very good Stuffed Shrooms!

good flavor, but I would suggest trying to use mushrooms that are all the same size. The little ones were good for popping right into your mouth and cooked just perfect. Some of the larger mushrooms were still a little raw..I guess that's common sense (now that I'm typing it out) but it didn't quite hit me until after they cooked

These mushrooms got rave reviews!! I used 1 lb Jimmy Dean hot sausage with 8 oz cream cheese, a little extra seasoning and then sprinkled with shredded Parmesan before broiling. I suggest baking if you are serving right away otherwise the mushrooms are still raw. I broiled as advised then kept warm in the oven until I was ready to serve and they were perfect! Will definitely add to my favorites. Thanks!

These mushrooms were very good, but very rich and filling! I doubled the recipe but I found that the doubled filling would have stuffed about 3 packages of 8oz white mushrooms. The only thing I added was a little bit of chopped onion & the some of the mushroom stems, sauteed with the sausage. I will make these again, thanks for sharing. Great recipe!

Fantastic - so good, in fact, that I ate a whole tray of them.  All I did was add a pinch or two of garlic salt and some snipped chives.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  You'll use more filling up if you stem the mushrooms well, then scrape out most of the gill area.  Delicous

These were GREAT!  I used Neufchatel Cheese (lower fat content) and Italian Sausage.  I work where we have a lot of parties and this will be one of the new things I bring..  Thanks for this site.

Great foundation with so many possibilities!  We used button mushrooms, but would like to try baby portabellas next time.  I only used half a brick of neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese (but would have used the whole thing if I'd had it on hand), and topped them off with a little shredded cheddar cheese.  We had leftover filling and used it to stuff a pepperocini and a red bell pepper.  Very tasty!  We will try these again and vary the ingredients with some of the suggestions here.

Just made these for the steeler game.  Wonderful tasted so good.  I was eating them before they even came out of the oven.  I used i roll of jimmy dean spicy sausage chopped up some of the stems while frying sausage added onion powder and spoonful of minced garlic. i had let my brick of cream cheese set out because i thought it would be easier to stir together. This makes a ton of filling so get extra mushrooms. i put them in the oven at 350 for 30 min. they really came out good will make again!

simple, easy, fast & DELISH! Gone in minutes. You would not think that just cream cheese and sausage would be so good, BUT it really is. Usually stuffed musrooms are more "dry" these are just right. I added onion & garlic when browning sausage. added garlic poweer, salt & pepper. sprinkled top with bread crumbs and more garlic power and parm cheese. broiled. SO GOOD. i want oneright now!

Wow! These tasted and looked gourmet. My dad and I hunted antelope in South Dakota last summer, so we have a lot of spicy antelope sausage in our freezer. I used that with fat free cream cheese. I used 4 ounces cream cheese and about a 1/2 lb. ground sausage. The mixture stuffed about 20 small mushrooms. Will make these again and again!

A major, major hit, and always is.  I made it exactly as directed, but doubled the number of mushrooms, because I had a lot more stuffing than mushrooms (and always do with this recipe).  Also, used "Italian" spicy sausage, and it was great.

Yummy! I made double svgs with well chopped hot italian turkey sausage & lowfat cream cheese. Agree w others- recommed baking mushrooms for 5-10min before broiling. Also added 1/8tsp garlic salt, oregano, and finely chopped onion & mushroom stems. Sprinkled parmesan cheese over tops before baking to add flavor & help browning.

This is a great receipe, I changed it a little, first I baked the mushrooms upside down for 5 minutes to get the moisture out of them.  I took the stems and put them in a food processor to fine dice them and added it to the cooked sausage, cream cheese and I also added a a cup of mayonaise, then I baked them for 15 minutes, the flavor was wonderful.

These are great! I had to improvise a bit, since I didn't have any sausage on hand, so I chopped up some thin sliced ham and added some cheddar cheese. By using cream cheese substitue (neufachel) and low fat shredded cheddar and low fat ham, this counts as a Phase 1 South Beach food, which is what I'm on right now! Great recipe with plenty of room to adapt it as you need! Great flavor!

This recipe is great!  It can be modified in many ways to meet your tastes and/or needs.  I just use 4 oz. of cream cheese per 8 oz. of sausage and add chopped parsley and fresh ground pepper to the mixture.  You can't go wrong on these stuffed mushrooms!

Make these for Thanksgiving and the were a BIG hit!  Can't believe how tasty they are with only 3 ingredients.  I did add some chopped onions and a little garlic, salt & pepper.  Also, I baked them at 350 in convection oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  They were super easy and I'll make them again!

This is the only recipe that I have ever used!  All of the other stuffed mushrooms are a little to complicated.  People beg myself and my step-mom to make these everytime the family gets together!  I also made these for my mom's 50th surprise birthday and I spent more time writing out recipes for everyone than spending time with my mom! :)

Great recipe that I have made various way several times.  I like to add a 1/2 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese and substitute the Italian sausage for Chorizo. When I do use Italian sausage, I usually add a a few tablespoons of shredded parmesan or asiago cheese and a tablespoon of basil pesto or sun-dried tomato pesto for a little extra kick.

I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage and added some chopped parsley and green onion to give the filling a little color. I was surprised that the filling doesn't taste all that "sausage-ey". I don't really care for the texture, I'd rather just have a cheese filling. I agree with those who suggest baking the mushrooms for a while before broiling to brown the topping, the mushrooms are pretty crunchy otherwise.

Delicious!  I used reduced fat cream cheese and sausage, though it was still a little more fattening than I would like.  Also added garlic powder and some of the stems.  I didn't want to deal with our broiler, so I just baked them in the oven, and they still turned out great.

Very easy & tasty appetizer. Good for spur of the moment company.  I put the stuffing in a ziploc and "piped" it into the mushroom caps--much less messy that way.

I added red hot pepper flakes and used hot breakfast sausage to give this some zip.  It was much better that way.

I made this as a Thanksgiving side dish and everyone loved them. The mushrooms were one of the first things to go. The only thing I would say is the measurements were a little off we more filling  than we did mushrooms. Overall though I would recommend and I would defiantly make these again.

Awesome!  I chopped up the stems as one reviewer suggested and sauteed them with the hot Italian sausage.  I used 1# of sausage to  8 ounces of cream cheese.  I also ran the mixture through my food processor to make the stuffing easier  as suggested.  Snugged them into a glass baking dish and baked at 400 for 20 minutes.  Perfect!

This was easy and delicious! Our guests thought the mushrooms were great. I must admit that I changed it a little.
I used an Italian spicy sausage. The little extra spice just bumped it up for our friends that enjoy things a bit hotter. 
Not too much for our mild friends.

I only had 6 medium sized mushrooms, so I can't wait to make these again!  We had some leftover baked frozen breakfast sausage so I cut it into very small pieces.  I chopped and sauteed the mushroom stems with a green onion, some garlic seasoning and a little Emeril's seasoning(we use it in everything). I added the chopped sausage to this and cooked another couple of minutes.  Mixed with the cream cheese and filled the mushrooms. 
Sprinkled a bit of parsley on top and baked at 350 for about 10 min before finishing under the broiler.  SO GOOD!!

For 3 ingredients, this is amazing! I used the hot breakfast sausage. My only complaint (not really) is that it called for 1/2 pound of sausage to 8 ounces of cream cheese. A 1 to 1 ratio gives great results

I would also give it 5 stars but changed a few things around. I used hot Italian sausage instead of pork and mixed in some Parmesan cheese along with the cream cheese. Then I used a glass baking dish and put olive oil all over the mushrooms and filled the bottom of the dish until the bottom of the mushrooms were covered. Bake at 375 for about 15 minutes. Pull out and cover with mozzarella cheese, bake for another 10 minutes or until cheese Is melted. FANTASTIC!!!!

These are delicious! However, the filling was enough for an entire pound of mushrooms, so plan to either halve the sausage/cream cheese, or double the mushrooms.

I gave this five stars because it's so close to the one I make that I knew it had to be awesome. The one I make.....I brown the sausage, then drain on paper towels. When cooled a little, I add it to the block of cream cheese and approx. 4-5 chopped green onion tops and mix it all together and then stuff the mushroom tops. Bake at 375 for approx. 30-45 mins depending on your oven. That's it!!!! No seasonings or spices!!!!

LOL.....these last about 5 mins at a party or get-together and I usually spend a ton of time passing out the recipe. Can never seem to make enough!!!
Another tip that I use is: I usually double the sausage, cheese and onion mixture and make a cheeseball with the other half for those that either don't like mushrooms or can't eat them. LOL....that doesn't last long either.  It's AWESOME folks!!!!!

LITERALLY.....3 ingreds + the mushrooms!!! No seasonings or spices!!! Doesn't get much cheaper than that!!!!

Seems too simple to be so delicious. I always brown the pork sausage with a little wine which helps break down the texture. These are so easy and always disappear quickly at any party. Great recipe!

Very easy recipe. I read reviews before making these. I added parmesan cheese to the sausage cream cheese mixture and then topped the stuffed mushroom with more parmesan cheese. I baked my stuffed mushrooms at 350 for 15 minutes and then the broiler to brown the tops. I took these to a family get together and came home with an empty dish. YUM!!!

I added two pieces of chopped up cooked bacon to the recipe for more flavor. When they had finished I added a little chopped up parsley for color. Also I decreased the cooking time by five minutes.

I made the following changes, using some tips from other reviews & they came out great.  Used 3 hot Italian cased sausages (cut away & discarded the casing), red pepper flakes, garlic salt, Italian seasoning.  After cooked, added 4 oz cream cheese.  After stuffing the mushrooms, topped with shredded Parmesan.  Cooked @ 375, 13 minutes, then broiled for two, on a parchment covered  cookie sheet.  Yield - 9 HUGE mushrooms.  Not too rich; just right!!!

I've been making this appetizer for 42 years!  The only differences are I use a full pound of pork sausage and bake instead of broil.   Most requested appetizer I've made and always the first to go.

If there happens to be any left, it's great chopped on in scrambled eggs the next morning.

Delicious and SO easy! I browned the ground pork with some chili seasoning, added sautéed chopped onion and hot sauce to the cream cheese mixture. Toped each stuffed mushroom with a little parmesan and shredded cheddar. Broiled them for 6 minutes (they were decent sized mushroom caps). Instant crowdpleaser!

I have a recipe I normally use similar to this. I sauté garlic and butter and mix in with cram cheese, and butter the mushrooms, but the rest of the recipe is the same. And I also use Italian sausage.

We made this recipe tonight using Italian sausage.  It was outstanding!  We plan on experimenting with incorporating a second cheese soon.

I really liked these and they are so easy to make... I did only use half the cream cheese and so glad I did as it would have been way too much richness and cream cheese flavor ( and I love cream cheese) I also added back the chopped mushroom parts after putting in the pan with the sausage for a few minute to soften slightly... I will make this for parties for sure

Very tasty!  Only change I made was to add about 1/2 cup of shredded Italian blend cheese with the cream cheese and sausage and more on top.

I started out broiling them but then decided to finish up baking at 375 for 20 mins.  I had large mushrooms and I wanted them cooked through. I liked the sausage, cream cheese mixture, but felt like it could have used something else.  Next time I might just add a little something.

Made these and thought they were great.  Great reviews from guests.  NOTE: I used half sweet and half hot sausage for a little more kick.

This deserves a five on simplicity alone.  The most recent time I made these was for our anniversary dinner which we celebrated with our 20 and 23 year old kids (one of whom doesn't like mushrooms).  I used about 3/4 lb of Jimmy Dean sage sausage with about 6 oz softened cream cheese.  I filled 12 good sized mushrooms - probably 1 1/2 to 2 inches across.  I added a few shakes of green Tabasco (though sometimes I use cayenne).  Everyone loved them.  My hint to others:  slice a slim slice from the bottom so the mushrooms rest flat and spray them with Pam.  Turn them over and fill.  Top with panko and spray again.  Bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Can finish under the broiler if they haven't browned but I've never needed to do that.  I hope your family and guests like them as much as mine.  Hint #2:  use a potato masher to get small, fine crumbles of sausage (essential to easy filling).  If pre-cooked sausage crumbles are available, this recipe is even simpler. Thanks, Sam, for the recipe.

My husband loves these and they're so simple. I didn't use all of the cream cheese, I used about 3/4 of it so it would be meatier. We also prefer our mushrooms cooked so instead of broiling I baked them at 350 for 10-15 mins.

Been making these for years - finely chop up the mushroom stems and sautee in a little butter and add to the mix --hubby loves the filling and we usually have a little left over and put on english muffins and toast under the broiler until bubbly - double duty recipe.

OMG!!!!!They were delicious.  I made these for a low carb induction snack and they were just great.  So easy and tasted so good.  I was even able to get my husband to try one.  He had to admit that he liked them even though he is not very fond of mushrooms. I will continue to make these even if not on a deit.  Oops, my husband just sneaked another one. Looks like I may have to make more.

I used this as a base recipe and then added the spices from the "mouth-watering stuffed mushrooms" on this site, which included a little black pepper, minced garlic, onion, and black pepper along with the finely chopped stems in the stuffing. LOVED THIS and everyone raved. Definitely will be making this again.

I made these stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner.  They were AWESOME and so easy.  I used baby 'bella shrooms and Bob Evans sausage mixed with cream cheese, then topped with green onions after they were baked.  YUM!  I think the baby bellas make all the difference--so much better than regular old button shrooms.

Very Good! I used a spicy sausage and I used the whole pack. I topped it with Sharp Cheddar cheese and instead of broiling it I bake it at 350 for 20 Minutes. My son who doesn't like mushrooms LOVED IT!

All Gone! Used spicy italian sausage and added 4 cloves of garlic and doubled the recipe. Also washed and dried my mushrooms. I failed to remove the entire stem of the mushroom. Don't forget to "core" the stem out of the mushroom itself, dont just just stop at the outer stem. I'm a beginner cook and only when I placed them in the oven did I think, "oh, I should have scooped out the stem core from within the mushroom", yes, but like I said, beginner cook! I brought it for a luncheon today and they were all eaten! Great recipe!

I give this recipe 4 stars because I found it rather bland. I added dried cranberries and it gave it just what it needed!! Great recipe :)

Very easy to make.  I had a bit more sausage, and I just went ahead and used it all.  I broiled for about 4-5 min but wasn't really satisfied with how they baked, so I then baked at 350 for 10 min.  I'm pleased with how they came out, although I didn't eat any since I don't like mushrooms.  Bf approved and said they were good.  Very nice for 3 ingredients.  Didn't take too long at all, and I used my small cookie scoop to make it easier to stuff them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ymmuy! I added four cloves of fresh minced garlic and about 3 green onions to the mix, and it was AMAZING. I also added a little salt and pepper. Everyone was going crazy over them.  I had to broil them a little longer than the recipe stated, about 5-6 minutes.  That might just be my oven though.

these were a huge hit at our family party! I doubled the recipe as shown and still have a TON of the stuffing left.  I will buy double the amount of mushrooms next time.  These are SO easy adn a huge crowd pleaser.

I was looking for something to make for Christmas Eve Appetizers---I added minced garlic and green onion, some of the mushroom stems with a touch of cayenne pepper to the sausage mixture to give it more flavor. I only used 8 oz of creme cheese and piped it into the mushrooms.  I also used the food processor on the the sausage and glased the tops with butter and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I took the advice of the other reviews baking the mushrooms instead of broiling them and it was a HUGE hit.  My fiancee loves them and thinks they will be a big hit.

I don't know about these. They were flavorful, but after tasting one or two, it was enough. The sausage/cream cheese texture was not to my liking. My husband didn't like them either. I did dip the tops in bread crumbs, and drizzle them w/ olive oil which helped, but I won't be making these again. Not that they are bad (one star), I just personally don't care for this kind of stuffing for mushrooms.

I came across this recipe when I was pregnant and craving stuffed mushrooms.  They are so easy to make, and everyone loves them!  My sister doesn't like mushrooms, but tried one just because everyone else was raving about them- turns out she liked them.

Thanks for a nice easy recipe that my whole family enjoys.

I made this for my son who is on the Atkins diet.  He liked it, although he said the cream cheese took away from everything else.  I did not care for them myself, but I was raised on the sausage/bread crumb stuffing.  I would make it again....but only if my son asked for it.

I make these all the time!!  But I use 1 lb. of sage flavored sausage with 8 oz. cream cheese.  After I fry up the sausage, I drain, let cool a little and mix with softened cream cheese.  Sometimes I sprinkle hot pepper seeds in with it.  I stuff the regular sized mushroom caps.  Delicious!

These mushrooms are great.  They are so easy and they will get snatched up by your guests, I promise.  I made these along with a whole table-full of finger foods and these were gone before there was a dent in many of the other appetizers.

A perfect appetizer....so easy and tastes like heaven. Served a winning low-carb meal to guests tonight. Every course was rated 5-stars in Allrecipes.com. I started with these mushrooms and they devoured them!  My only regret is I should have made twice as many.  By the way, the other courses included Spinach and strawberry salad with poppy seed dressing, and Herbed pork and apples....all of these are allrecipe 5-star recipes!
