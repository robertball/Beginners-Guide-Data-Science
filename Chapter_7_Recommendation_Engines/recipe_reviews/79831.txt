This cake is just marvellous, however I did tweak it up a bit.
As I was creaming the butter and sugar together the butter had looked like wayyyy too little as it was only 1/2 cup to 2 cups sugar, and so I threw in 1/2 cup of cream cheese and creamed it with the sugar until fluffy.
Also instead of baking it in 3 pans I baked it in a bundt pan. The result, a wonderful scrumcious yummy moist cake. Everyone loved it!

First I must say I'm not a big fan of cake. That said, I thought this was fabulous! It sounded wonderful so I had to try it. I put it in a bundt pan and it came out beautiful. I cut the frosting in half and I still had plenty left over. I must say that the frosting was of a too soft consistency and was almost running off the cake. I have had better cream cheese frosting. I will use my own recipe for that the next time. I also used the whole can of cherries.(Comstock) The cake was super moist. Next time I'll maybe get 2 cans of cherries, drain the sauce off 1 can and add some whole cherries to it. I would like more cherry flavor. I took leftovers to work and the girls all flipped over it. My family really enjoyed it too. Great recipe and thanks for sharing!

FANTASTIC!! WONDERFUL!!!  This recipe is really great, I took this to a Christmas party, and got RAVE reviews!  The only thing I changed, was less sugar in the icing (probably only 2-3 cups of powdered sugar), as I am not a huge fan of super sweet frosting.  I also added candied cherries on top of the canned cherry filling, as I liked biting into big hunks of cherries.  I would recommend this to anyone.

I was really disappointed in this recipe, I thought it sounded delicious.  First of all, I only have 2 9" pans so that's what I used and it was fine.  If you used 3 pans I guess it would come out more like a torte, with three thin layers.  What was disappointing to me was the texture, it was more like a gingerbread-type texture, a little on the dry side.  And it sort of tasted like gingerbread!  I love gingerbread but that is not what I was expecting from this recipe I wanted a cake. I would not make this again.

This is an excellent cake!  It's very moist.  Here's why you use 3 cake pans - the fruit filling makes it very heavy and dense.  If you put all the batter in 2 pans (like I did!) your cake is going to seriously sink!  Even with the sunken middles, it still tasted amazing!  You really can't taste the cherry, but I did top mine with cherries and that added a lot.  The frosting is great!  I cut it in 1/2 and it was just enough to frost the cake with a little left over.

This is literally the best spice cake I've ever had. (I know. One hell of a hurdle to get over..) But that's saying anything negative about it.
   I could categorize Carrot Cake into the same  class. Carrot Cake might be better from the pineapple you include in it. But I liked the cherry better with the icing I put on instead of the cream cheese stuff it says. 
   Coconut Pecan Frosting is what I went with. Which is on here call Coconut Pecan Frosting II? I think... The photo when you click on it has a cupcake with the frosting.     The coconut goes great with the cake. It makes it all-round better. Give it a try. I'm usually hard to impress. This cake with the German Chocolate frosting delivers.

I made this in my Bundt pan after reading several reviews suggesting it, but it was too dense for me. Might have been better as a layer cake... (That's what I get for making alterations before trying the original!) The icing was great.
