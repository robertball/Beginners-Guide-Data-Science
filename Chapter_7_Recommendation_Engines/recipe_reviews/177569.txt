Somewhat bland, I doubled the amount of seasonings and added 2 teaspoons of italian mix as well. Next time instead of using garlic powder I will chop fresh garlic and saute it with the chicken breasts in the first step.

Very tasty - I made some changes and want to remember what I did differently: added onions and pepper - also red pepper - right after the meat to saute them. Then used one can of chicken broth and fire roasted garlic tomatoes; half the oregano and about two tsp of Mrs. Dash Italian blend. Used penne pasta and added some Worcester sauce and stirred in 1/2 small can of tomato paste at the end to thicken. Served with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Delicious!

My family loved this dish, they are already requesting it again! I added some Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and a can of tomato paste. We weren't ready to eat when it was done, so I let it simmer for close to 45 minutes. That really brought out the flavors and let the sauce thicken. Just punch up the sauce and this is delicious!

Very tasty though I also included a red pepper in mine and uncovered for the last few minutes to reduce and thicken the sauce. My husband would have preferred more garlic too. Would make again. I only had fusili pasta and that worked fine.

My "Chicken Cacciatore Diavolo and Pasta" had a few changes to this recipe.  I use Olive Oil, fresh garlic and diced Tomatoes with Chilies (Rotel brand).  I also substituted Italian Seasoning and a Bay Leaf in place of the dried oregano.   I also added a can of Black Olives (chopped in quarters).  I received Raving Reviews for this dish!

I served this over rice and it was really good. Be sure to add salt while cooking. Also after the chicken is browned sautee the green peppers and onions, then add the stock and other ingredients back into the pan.

Awesome recipe.  I used tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes (hubby doesn't like chunks of tomatoes), fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder & italian seasoning instead of the oregano.  Even my picky hubby & son loved it.  Reheats well for lunch.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but did make a few changes. Like suggested, I used fresh garlic instead of powdered and added a little bit of white wine while it was simmering. I served it with brown rice instead of pasta, but think pasta would be great also. I used less chicken stock since I was not adding the pasta.

It tasted like bland spaghetti sauce with chicken. It needed something different. I'm not sure what but my recipe in a cookbook I have is pretty simple but with a lot more flavor. Sorry I couldn't like it.

Good, pretty quick and easy other than having to chop onion and pepper.  One pot dinner, that's always a plus for clean-up!  The only variations we made on the recipe were to season the chicken while it cooked, and to cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and eat the meal more like a stew (it was pretty liquidy)

I really enjoyed this recipe. Especially as I have been trying very hard to find something new and easy (not to mention cheap) to do with Chicken Breasts. And I absolutely loved this dish, AND it was a hit with my kids! Bonus points there.

This was too try.  It has a nice flavor. I will switch to chicken thighs the next time.

I added some minced garlic, a little red wine. It still seemed to need something, so I but in a half cup garlic tomato basil soup. Really boosted the taste without adding much in the way of calories.

I usually make this with tomato oregano basil soup and vinegar and worcestershire sauce but didn't have the soup so I went with this recipe but added vinegar and worcestershire sauce.  Very good!

I have made this many many many times but have a few tweaks to the recipes. Instead of using chicken halves I use drumsticks and thighs (with the bone) I also use red and green peppers with onion and garlic cloves. I normally cook the chicken in a pan with the olive oil, peppers, onions and garlic first to make sure the chicken is cooked thoroughly. I also add some of my pasta sauce into the pan while it cooking to make a little gravy. I usually serve over penne pasta with garlic bread. Have never used chicken stock in my recipe. but everything else was the same.

Very tasty! I did add a few more spices and simmered the dish for 20 minutes instead of 15.  Overall, a great dish and I'll definitely cook it again.

I doubled everything... used rigatone, which worked well.  I also added a can of tomato paste at the end in in order to thicken it up.  The family loved it.
