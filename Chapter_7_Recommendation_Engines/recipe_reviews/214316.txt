These are awesome little treats! We used 5 oz Dixie cups and they were the perefect dessert size and didn't seem to be too rich as some had said before.  They were also fun to make which makes them a good dessert for kids.

YUMMY!  Do not forget to press down the crushed cookies and the "souffle".  They may not come out looking quiet as good - but the taste awesome.  This is super EASY and  has great presentation value.  They need to be removed from the freezer about 60 minutes before you plan on serving.  Do NOT make them any bigger - they are VERY rich.

A little too rich. Be sure to use a small layer of cookies and pudding. Otherwise, pretty good. Also, do not use sugar free pudding because the consistency will be odd--a little too many ice crystals formed.

Very, very sweet and rich--almost too much. It is good for a simple frozen desert but use 5 oz. paper cups because it is so rich.
