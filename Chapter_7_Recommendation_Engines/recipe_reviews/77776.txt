I have made this for several years.  The only difference is that I add 1/2 tsp. or so of liquid smoke.  I prepare 2 or 3 batches and put into a plastic wrap lined fish mold. Refrigerate for several hours then turn out onto a platter and decorate with sliced almonds for the fins and pimentos & olives for face features.  you can get real creative and make a beautiful display for an appetizer table.  Serve with crackers

Very nice spread.  I would recommend placing all of the ingredients in a food processor to make the pate as smooth as possible.

This is excellent ? I have a similar recipe and the only change is adding liquid smoke, just 1 tsp. does it. I put it in bowl with crackers around the plate and it is always a hit.  I have used it for a filling for petite sandwiches. Make sure you buy the boneless salmon in a can.

I took this dip to a family Christmas get-together...it was a hit. My father n law "the chef" raved about it...a great compliment! I took the advice of other's, and added liquid smoke and crushed red peppers. I used fat free cream cheese. I served this in a bread bowl...made a great presentation! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic recipe!  Some people use liquid smoke with the recipe, I prefer smoked paprika.  It gives it a beautiful pink color like smoked salmon.  I have made this every Christmas for three years and it is always a huge hit.  I serve with tomato slices and capers on mini bagels or toasts.

I made a double recipe the other day. I looked at the insane amount of pate in the dish and was expecting to throw at least 1/2 of it away since I expect our three kids (4, 7, 8) to turn their collective noses up. NOT SO. The kids devoured it! I made the recipe as shown but added 1 tsp of liquid smoke (remember, doubled the recipe). I'll add more next time. I also used a food processor.

Great recipe - so easy and huge hit.  I added a touch of cayenne pepper to give it a little zip.  And I used whipped cream cheese to give it a lighter texture

EXCELLENT recipe, very similar to Philadelphia's vesion of salmon cream cheese.  I took the advice of others as well and used liquid smoke and crushed red pepper, parsley for garnish only.  No nuts. Served it on a bed of fresh dill branches and lemon slices, and voila!  Thank you!

OMG!  This is awesome!  I was searching for something to do with leftover salmon and this is it!  Great spread on crackers, fabulous filling for a sandwich.  I didn't roll mine into a ball--no one wanted to wait that long!  Thanks!

Made this alongside a venison liver pate for Thanksgiving appetizers and it was very well received.  Did not roll into a ball, just added parsley and pecans to the mixture and served in a bowl with crackers.  Very good, and I'm going to try the leftovers in an omelette just for kicks.  Will make again.

I tried rolling it in parsley, but it had not chilled enough.  I just ended up sprinkling the parsley on top for garnish. I thought that it tasted fantastic but will probably add something next time to give it a little bit of spice as I think that will enhance the flavor.

It taste great with toasted bread. I modified it a little bit. Instead of rolling the ball mixture into parsley and pecan, I added the parsley and walnut into the mixture. I also added less cream cheese, instead only put 4 tablespoon cream cheese.

I love this pate. This is the 3rd time I've made it.  I did the adjustments as well. I used the packet of salmon instead of canned (so convenient), added dill and fresh chives (replaced onion) and sweet Spanish paprika.  I also zested a little of the lemon into the mix.   I made an error and added more liquid smoke than I meant to... but it didn't hurt the recipe one bit.  Served with crackers and capers on the side and also some good cayenne pepper for anyone who wanted a little heat. The only thing was the "roll into a ball with pecans and parsley" was no easy chore.  You may want to just use a bowl or shape it with gloved hands.  FYI - The pecans give it just a little bit of texture which takes it from yummy to extraordinary! I made 2 balls out of it for 2 different parties.  Great!

Tried it with smoked salmon.  You can't go wrong with cream cheese and smoked salmon.  Next time I am going to work in some capers.

This was so simple!!  however, I did add liquid smoke and doubled the horseradish, lemon juice and onion. I also added a dash of sea salt and pepper.  I did roll it in pecans as suggested and it's a great little appetizer.  The salmon I used was from my own canned salmon which is good with nothing added. If I was making this for myself, I would have added capers as well, however it's for a party, and some may not like capers as much as I do. I will make this again when time is limited, because it took 15 min to make
