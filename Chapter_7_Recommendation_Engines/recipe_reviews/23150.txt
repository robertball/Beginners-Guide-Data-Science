Wonderful! Made a huge dish!! I went a step further and made a bananas foster sauce for the top - 2/3 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup butter in a frying pan, then added 3 sliced bananas - cooked a couple of minutes, then added a splash of rum and banana liqueur.  It was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness!! This is absolutely the best bread pudding recipe I have eaten ... or prepared and I am crazy about bread pudding!! For kids you can omit the liquor although the alcohol bakes off and simply leaves an incredible flavor!!  Thank you so much! I have made it twice this week and EVERYONE was stunned! I am making copies of the recipe for everyone while I'm writing this review!

I don't usually prefer bananas, but this recipe certainly makes me a fan!  I was skeptical of a banana dessert, so I gave it a test run by cutting the recipe down to yield 5 servings.  I cut a small loaf of french bread into about 1 inch cubes and used a banana flavored rum.  I poured the mixture into a small loaf pan and threw it into the toaster oven.  I did also find that I didn't need to keep it in there for more than 60 minutes, but that's probably more because I was baking a smaller portion.  I pushed the toast button for the last few minutes to make the top crispier, which I thought complemented the bread pudding texture wonderfully!  I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and also made the sauce (I used the recipe from Bananas Foster II submitted by Buttermebread) which was phenomenal drizzled over the pudding and vanilla ice cream!  Excellent and definitely a keeper!  Will be making the whole recipe and sharing the joy with others!

This is incredible!!! The pudding had a great texture and the banana flavor was terrific. I was afraid it would be overly sweet but it wasn't. It was delicious plain and also with vanilla ice cream on top.

I am a lover of Bread Puddings and this was wonderful...but you have to like the flavor of Banannas!  I made it for our Super Bowl/Madis Gras party and it was a HUGE hit!  I made a sauce to serve ontop of each serving (b.sugar, butter, bannana liquor, pecans and milk).  We also served it warm with a scoop of vanilla iceream.  Will make it again!

OUTSTANDING!  As suggested, I made the sauce with brown sugar, butter and I added an additional 1/2 cup of the banana liquer - pour over a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of this Banana Fosters Pudding (which had the consistency of bread pudding) and the family was in heaven.  It ALL went!

not as good as i'd expected... it tasted pretty good, but the bananas turned purpley and the whole thing just looked very unappetizing

Yummy yummy yummy!! This was soo soo good I wish I had hidden the leftovers from my family!   I made it on Sunday night for dessert  to go with the bananas foster II recipe from this site & a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Both were awesome, but honeslty I think it was overkill to make both as they were both so good that it was hard to enjoy them indivdually. Luckily I had about half a tray left and brought a slice (okay fine a huge chunk!) to work for breakfast the next day. HEAVEN!! By the tiem I got home i wanted another slice but sadly my family had gobbled it up. You MUST try this recipe!!  *The only thing I changed was using rum instead of banana liquor as I wanted to keep the cost down and already had rum on hand.

Didn't like this at all.  I found the pudding to be more like a mushy banana bread.  It smelled good while cooking, but otherwise a waste of ingredients and time.  5 people tried it and not one liked it in the least.

This is an excellent ice cream topper!  As for pudding -- maybe it's because it is not cooked like a typical bread pudding, but in now way would I call this pudding.

Delicious!! Definately needs ice cream and a topping (butter, brown sugar, and liquor), otherwise it does taste like mushy banana bread. Would definately make again! YUM!

The directions were very easy to follow, but I agree with another member who said their bananas turned out purple, and that it just ended up tasting like mushy banana bread. It did not look appetizing at all.

Amazing. Since it was for two people I halved the recipe. I used soymilk instead of cream (vegetarian) and used Cream sherry instead of banana liquor. Perfect. And I am not even a big fan of bananas!

This is the best bread pudding I've ever tasted. Not too sweet. Lots of banana flavor. It was a great hit at my dinner. Gotta try it if you like bread pudding and bananas foster.

This was FABULOUS.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I used bourbon liquer, only regular milk (no cream) and I had praline crumbs I used rather than regular pecans.  I also used left over apple crumb muffins for the 1/2 of the bread.  :)

Best bread pudding recipe that I have tried. After the initial 90 minutes baking, I cut the bread pudding into approximately 2" squares, tossed and baked for about 20 minutes (a idea from a cooking class).  I also made the banana foster sauce suggested by KRANEY (the first review on the page).  Everyone loved it!  My son had it for breakfast the next day!

This pudding was absolutely delicious!!!  I used bananas that weren't ripe and crushed pecans instead of chopped pecans.  Lots of people said it was the best dessert they ever had!

I followed this recipe exactly.  The oven temp and/or the cooking time must be incorrect!  It was burned after 60 minutes.
