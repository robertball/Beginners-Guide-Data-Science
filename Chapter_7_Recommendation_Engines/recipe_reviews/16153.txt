I showed this recipe to my Grandma and she has a couple of comments:
She adds 1/2 cup softened butter to the mix to help things stick together and she said that you should mix the potatoes and soda together and then add them after mixing the rest of the ingredients--doing this can improve the texture of the puddings.
When I made this I doubled everything except the cloves.
I also put this in canning jars to steam so it will keep until Christmas.  One recipe fits into two pint jars filled 3/4 full.

This has been my family's traditional Christmas dessert for over 50 years.  It is something everyone looks forward to all year long!  No one is ever "too" full to pass up dessert when it is carrot pudding.  I use glass jars (canning either pint or quart and fill half way before closing and steaming).

there is a similar cake
made in the middle west
that basically has the
same ingredients and a
rum sauce which adds a
real kick to it. the
pudding can be made in
a coffee tin or a pudding mold. either way
it is worth the trouble
to make.

This is the exact same recipe that my grandmother made every year for thanksgiving.  It came to America with her English grandmother.  Thanks for the canning jars idea!  My mom used to steam it in empty shortening cans, but shortening doesn't come in tin cans anymore and I'm not a coffee drinker!  I was at a loss as to what to steam it in since I don't have a steamed pudding mold.  I haven't had this in a long, long time.  I'll have to make it this year.  This is also very good with a lemon sauce or hot with ice cream and caramel sauce on top.

My father and his twin had this every year for the December birthdays.  Dad has been gone 20 years, Mom's been gone 2, but I continue to make this pudding, and the family devours it.  I make a thickened Vanilla Sauce, the same as the recipe above but flour added for thickening.  My widowed aunt uses a pressure cooker and cornstarch as the thickener. Rich and yummy, and real spicy.

Delicious.  I made it in 3 pint canning jars in my canning kettle.   Hubby loved it.  The sauce was delish too and I'll make it to keep in the frig for other desserts as well.

My Mom first served this to our family in 1956; she got it from a lady she worked with in Marsing, ID.  I've been making in for my family since 1969 and we all love it.  Sometimes I make it in 16 oz vegetable cans and bake it like bread rather than steaming.  It stores nicely in fridge.  I like it toasted and spread with cream cheese.  Yum!

I'd never had carrot pudding and thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't have a 1 pound coffee can so I used two 28 oz glass jars and that worked out fine.  I didn't realize I didn't have raisens until it was too late so I didn't add those.  I gave it four stars because I'm going to have to experiment with the sugar to get the sweetness down to where it's sweet, but not overly sweet.  This dessert is VERY RICH and VERY VERY SWEET.  Other than that it was delicious.

Love it will be my Christmas tradition

Instead of potatoe I used apple then reduced sugar to half a cup, used cinnamon one teaspoon and one teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. So good moist, sauce the same as in the recipe.

We have served this recipe, with the addition of a cup of prunes (yes prunes) -- for Christmas for half a century and four generations.  This is a perfect pudding to cook in a decorative pudding mold, studded with fresh cranberries and flamed with brandy.   After dinner, turn the lights out, flame the pudding at the dinner table with great ceremony, and let a tradition begin. Oh yes, serve with a whipped cream and orange sauce...Divine.

2 of 4 of us loved this, the others rated it a 1 hence the 3 rating. Personally i thought it was great without the sauce which i didn't make. A warning: I too used pint jars which I filled 2/3 full and they overflowed. Would recommend filling them less.

my mother in law used to make this and it is so yummy. We always had with a hard sauce. 
Same as the other lady on here, 1/2 cup butter (creamed  with the sugar) is what our recipe called for as well, and she also divided the grated potatoes (never red ones) and added 1tsp baking soda to the half, then added that soda potato mixture at the very end. 
She used a steam pudding pan - which when I married into the family I too bought on. 
Since been divorced but still make and bought another pan from amazon.ca 
Big tradition in the family and one that will be carried onto the kids.

Made it twice.  Added butter to cake and steamed in glass jars. Served it with brown sugar sauce and small scoop of vanilla ice cream.   Very mild and tasty!  Lots of compliments on our Christmas pudding.

Very rich and decadent!  I followed another review and added 1/2 cup butter to the mix.  I also used brown sugar instead of white in both the pudding and the sauce.  I steamed it in one quart sealer jar and it overflowed.  Next time I will use two quart jars so it has plenty of room to expand.

This pudding is FABULOUS!!!  Nice and spicy and moist.    

I used less sugar than called for (as I don't like real sweet things) and I didn't make the sauce.   I love this!!!  It's healthy and delicious.

Great pudding. I make this for our dinner at Church and make a few changes. I add almond slices and candied red and green cherries. I also tried putting them in small muffin tins ( which is about 1 serving) baked them for 1 hour with a pan of water under need them. Turned out great.

I have been looking for this recipe for some time since my mother passed away.  This is an awesome recipe and if you haven't tried it I would suggest that you do.  This was a family recipe that my Mother would make at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Old German or Norway recipe as I remember.
