One thing that might help with the clumping of the egg yolks - and I'm surprised that the original recipe doesn't mention it - would be to temper the eggs by mixing a measure of the hot sauce to the beaten eggs before putting them into the saucepan.  It's a fairly common technique with Hollandaise and other sauces.

I followed this recipe but found that the alfredo came out clumpy. I asked a friend who said that the temperature was too hot for the eggs.  So, a word of caution regarding adding the eggs, might want to first melt the cheese into the sauce and then slowly mix in the egg yolks off the heat.  :-)

Yummo!! but very rich.
If you want a little something extra added some garlic and Dijon Mustard. If you are in a rush getting home from work, try adding some corn flour for thickening, instead of letting it simmer to reduce.

I wrote a review for this recipe but it has disappeared. I shall say that the egg yolks were unappetizing and most unappealing and we will never make this recipe again. Thank you.

We tried it because we only had these ingredients on hand and it was a mistake.  The sauce turned chunky after a few minutes in the noodles.

Very tasty. I added some garlic and some white wine as well. Usually I use a flour mixture to thicken my alfredo, but the eggs worked well. Very yummy :)

My boyfriend and I agree that this recipe isn't too great. It turned out WAY too thick, to the point of being chunky, and the cheese was beyond overpowering. I wouldn't reccommend it unless someone can tweak it.

I am giving this 5 stars because it was a huge hit with my 2 year old. I made this for lunch it was simple and easy. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 a box of bow tie pasta. We shared it and there was still plenty left over.

This did NOT bake well...very very lumpy...it looked unappealing when we put it in with potatoes and broccoli.  The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because the flavor was fairly ok.  Will not make again.

Didn't have quite 2 cups of parm, so used a handful of grated mild chedder. I didn't have a problem with the sauce turning out to think. I put the sause over egg noodles with chicken, spinach and mushrooms. Added some garlic powder and salt and peper. Was delicious!

This sauce was so good!  I just made for dinner since I hadn't decided what to make, and it came out just right.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I read some of the other reviews about eggs clumping but I didn't have a problem with that.

To keep the eggs from lumping, you need to temper the beaten yolks.  Whisk (about 2 Tbls.) of the hot liquid into the beaten egg yolks.  This is a yummy recipe - way better than from a jar!

My friend and I had made some kick butt home made grilled chicken ravioli and was looking for a good sauce to go along with it.  This sauce looked good and we tried it.  VERY disappointing.   The sauce was watery and thin.  Cheese do not all melt.  Will not do again

It was okay, but it clumped so bad and i must agree that the cheese was very overpowering. I added some garlic powder and mushrooms, it was still just okay, i only recomend this if you are really really hungry and feel like tasting parmesan for a week

Make sure to use fresh Parmesan cheese because otherwise it becomes extremely chunky. In addition this sauce was very bland and when adding the pasta, thickened too much and was no longer the consistency of sauce

I loved it!! I used mixes cheese and a pinch of parmesan for the cheese and it tasted like a cheesey-er slightly grainy Olive Garden sauce!! All of my family loves it! I can never eat from the jarred sauce anymore!

I halved the recipe and tempered the egg yolk and still got clumpy sauce.  I think because I used real Parmesan and it is a hard cheese, it never really melts.  The sauce never thickened for me.  I ended up using a small amount of flour mixed with water to make it thicken.  I added some garlic salt with parsley which boosted the flavor.  I enjoyed this for lunch but doubt that I'll make it again.

Was pretty good, I halved the recipe.  I didn't have half and half so did 1/2c. milk + 1/2tbsp. butter.  I also didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese, just the canned stuff, and only added 3/4c. of the 8oz. can.  It was a bit strong and came out ever so slightly grainy, but once tossed with hot pasta (I had egg noodles) there was no 'graininess".  Also with the eggs, I have an electric stove, so I kept everything on '2' until the milk was warm, stirred and added the eggs until mixed, then added the cheese a bit at a time until it 'melted'.  I then turned it up slightly to simmer for a bit an thicken.  I've tried making cheese sauce in the past and it always turned out horrible, very grainy, and icky, I took it super slow with this recipe and stirred with a whisk.  (I was very causious and it took like a half hour to make, which I was fine with.)

scrumptious! did not quite have the parmesan. added some grated cheese and some garlic.  no problem with the egg yokes. I just beat them with some cream, added it to the cream while it was warming and stirred until it boiled.

Eventhough I tempered the eggs as suggested by others it was very lumpy. The flavor was good but the end result looked very unappetizing.

I tried this recipe because I didn't have heavy cream on hand but had half and half.  I tempered the eggs like suggested in other reviews.  The taste was alright but it had a fine lumpy texture that wouldn't whip out (it is not a lack of tempering the eggs that makes this lumpy but rather the combination of ingredients). The recipe says to simmer 5-10 minutes, the longer it simmered, the more lumpy it got.  I whipped in butter to try and smooth out the texture, it helped but I couldn't get the lumps out.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

I used this recipe because I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Perhaps I did something wrong?  It ended up chunky with bits of egg in it, reminiscent of egg drop soup.  I ended up pureeing it in the blender, which helped at first but then the sauce separated again once it was mixed with the pasta.

Taste was not bad, turned out too watery (might be my fault I used skim milk instead of whole since that's all I buy).  I also added some garlic powder.

This was just okay. At first I thought it was going to be great because I gradually stirred the parmesan cheese in like some suggested. At first it was creamy and looked great. It turned out clumpy and thick. Other than the texture, the taste is alright. It's very cheesy, that's okay if that's what you like. I don't think I will make this again though.

This recipe was really watery. A good alfredo sauce is made with cream, not milk and half and half.

the flavor was OK at best. I think it could have been better, maybe if it had mentioned to use fresh parmesian, instead of the grated kind in the container. It was REALLY gritty...one dinner ruined. :(

This was good, but i have had better. I would make again though for those times when i am in a hurry. I would also buy a high quality parmesan as the prepackaged store brand isn't as flavourful.

So easy and yummy. I used all half and half as I didn’t have whole milk. Very creamy. I made a little extra since I added shrimp and scallops.

Parmesan cheese never melts, it forms a big clump - which is even worse the less fat milk you use - it turns to milk with a clump of cheese.  Also has no flavor, except the cheese - which is almost nil.

I thought it was really good. I didn't have whole milk only 2 percent so I used 3/4 cup half and half and 1/4 cup milk. My son who hates everything, but likes macaroni and cheese actually ate it and asked for seconds.

Easy to make.  Yes,  temper your eggs!  A little butter and garlic powder, as suggested, made it great. Will explore other seasonings. Favorite feature: uses half & half!  I always have that, not so,  heavy cream.

This isn't as good as the recipe with a whole stick of butter in it but it is good in a pinch. I left out the milk and just used all whipping cream. Very good!

GREAT recipe- don't change it because it really has an excellent consistancy! I only added minced garlic with the butter instead of garlic powder and then snuck in 2 oz of gorganzola. This is a keeper going into the hard print cookbook.

Good sauce, but very touchy on the temp.  Mine, like others came out lumpy, or "gritty", as the chesse didn't melt smoothly.  All in all, however, it was a good sauce.

Really good, easy to make.  Used with tortelloni, Sauteed chicken and served with homemade french bread.  I think the egg adds a smoothness to the sauce and aids on the thickening obviously.  You just need to temper the egg with about 1/8 cup of the warm sauce.  I like my alfredo garlicky, so added 2 cloves minced along with the cheese.  Yummy comfort food!

I attempted to make this sauce several years ago to put over cheese raviolis. It didn't turn out as I wanted it too. I had to add corn starch to thicken the sauce and it just didn't taste like I had hoped. I guess I'll have to try this again since I have more cooking experience.

Yummy but came out very grainy. Wish I'd read the review about adding the egg yolks later. I used it for pizza so it didn't impact the presentation much.

Very good, but because of the cautions about it being lumpy, I skipped the eggs and added a 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp. water. I also added a 1/2 tbsp. of italian seasoning, a diced roma tomato, one diced clove of garlic and a handful of diced mushrooms. This is a great basic sauce to experiment with. Thanks!
