WOW! A nice variation of the rice krispie treat. Milky Way bars are VERY hard to find here in Canada (especially in a small east coast town). With a little help from my sister (who lives in the US) we discovered that Mars Bars are the equivalent to the US Milky Way bars. You need to use "king size" Mars Bars or 6 of the regular size.  Happy baking!  You'll be sure to love this one!

I tried these with three different kinds of candy bars - Milky Way, Snickers and Baby Ruth.  I like the peanuts from the last two candy bars, but they do not melt as well as the Milky Way. The mixture becomes more liquified instead of thick and rich.  They also need to be refrigerated longer.  I like the topping on them because I don't think they look finished without it.  Quick and easy recipe!!

Not sure if anyone else has mentioned this, but this is a really common treat in Australia - they call it Mars Bar Slice.  Instead of chocolate chips, using Cadbury milk chocolate bars is much better topping (nicer consistency and taste).  I also prefer to serve these at room temperature so they aren't so hard.  Very sweet, but like a giant candy bar.

This recipe is in a British cookbook from about 10 years ago, except it uses around half the butter used here.  Anyway I made the cookbook version on the weekend - very nice although still a little too buttery!  Definitely cut down on it.

These were good, not bad, not great...good.  If I do make them again, I may skip the chocolate on top.  I'm just not sure why they didn't go over well, I can't put my finger on it.  Thanks Cheryl.

I am addicted to any and all treats with rice crisps and this one is THE best!!!!  I couldn't find Milky Way bars in Canada so I used Baby Ruth bars instead.  I can't imagine them without the peanuts.  I also doubled the recipe to fit a 13X9 inch pan.  Delish!

These are pretty tasty, but there is too much butter. This is a good treat for kids, but adults might not like the flavor too much as these bars are extremely sweet

These are killer good !!  Made them for my son's 6th birthday in school.  All my other kids went crazy, not to mention my husband, so I had to double the batch.  I don't think I will go back to the "normal " kind again.  Thank you.

These were soooooo good! I made them for a school bake sale, and they were a big hit with the kids! They preferred these to the standard marshmallow kind. I made them using Mars chocolate, I added an extra bar of Mars, so it was more caramely/chocolatey, and I skipped the chocolate on top as recommended by other reviewers.

Yummy, easy, & quick! I picked this for my husband to make and he was able to easily.  Was a hit at potluck and next day at work.  Bars are pretty rich in their sweetness, like a candy bar is.  So don't expect to chomp them down like you would a normal rice crispy treat.  But has that great crunchy and chewy texture.  With yummy Milky Way flavor!

I was very disappointed, made these for a bake sale that I now have nothing for. The taste was good but the consistancy was not, once the candy bars were melted there was really nothing gooey to hold everything together aside from the chocolate on top, but after melting with butter even that didn't help.

As is, this recipe is a four. How can one go wrong with mars bars? However I make a slightly different version, which I find is a five star square. I use 3 mars bars (I buy the four pack and usually end up eating one), about 1.5 cups of minimarshmallows, maybe a little less if I don't have quite enough, 1/4 cup butter. I melt this mix on the stove over low/med heat, stirring constantly, and add 4.5 or 5 cups of rice crispies. If I feel like a richer bar, I use less cereal. If I want to stretch the batch, I use a bit more. After I press the mixture into a pan (8x8 if I want thick bars) I do not put them in the fridge or melt chocolate on the top. The chocolate is unnecessary and I find it takes away from the caramel flavour. I make these squares a lot and they always get eaten. Again, how can one go wrong with mars bars???

I think these would be a five star if it didn't taste like so much like butter. I will make them again and add less butter to see if makes a difference.

WOW!  These were so good.  I used less butter because of what previous reviewers said and it turned out perfect.  My husband loved them!  He didn't want me to take them to work because he wanted to eat them! Thank you so much for this recipe, a great alternative to an ordinary rice krispie bar.

Very, very good!   I don't know if I'd say the best krispie treat that I've ever eaten but definitely a wonderful change from the norm.  I omitted the frosting and just sprinkled lightly with mini chocolate chips before they went into the fridge.  Every body at work loved them and the kids begged me to leave some at home.  I will definitely make these again - maybe leaving out a tablespoon or two of butter to see if they still taste as good with a little less fat!

Absolutely delicious! I made treat bags for co-workers with homemade fudge, pretzel rods and these yummy treats. Everyone was crazy about them. They are so easy to make too! I made exactly by recipe and they were great.

These were just ok.  In my opinion, they did not live up to the 5 star reviews I read and doubt I will make again.  Too bad because I LOVE Milk Way bars....

I have made this recipe several times since I needed a "no-bake" cookie recipe to make for my daughter's kindergarten class. This recipe was a HUGE hit with both kids and teachers! I used 5 bars instead of 4 because I was letting the kids break them and thought some might get eaten--none did, but 5 bars was extra good! I don't have an 11x7 pan so I used a 2.5 qt casserole. We stuck it in the fridge about 15 minutes. Yummy!

These did not turn out how I had hoped. The rice crispy part turned out ok, but I had modified that part of the recipie because I didn't buy chocolate nugat bars (I bought chocolate bars with caramel inside). I mixed the bars with the traditional rice crispy recipie with the marshmellows. The topping is what I was dissapointed with. The chocolate was way too thick. I think milk added to the recipe would have made them turn out like in the picture. This also may have been due to using generic chocolate chips, though. They still tasted ok though.

The flavor was very rich, but the crispies turned soggy due to so much butter.

I made these for my nieces and nephews for christmas.  It does seem like there is a little too much butter, but I don't think you could reduce it by much.  I added a little extra rice crispies.  The flavor is very good and different.

The rice krispies in this recipe get soggy and give the final product a mushy consistency.  The chocolate flavor is awesome but the texture is nasty; like chewing on styrofoam.  Perhaps adding more rice krispies would help.

CRAZY good. Made these in Finland for my girlfriend and her family, they flipped. No Milky Way bars here, but as another (Canadian) foreigner suggested, use Mars bars. You'll need 5 instead of the 4 called for. Thanks again for the recipe!

A great change to rice crispy treats! Makes it easy to change to make it your own alwo. I modified the recipe to include regular rice crispy treats as a layered dessert. (I've posted the changes as a separate recipe)

These are very sweet and chocolatey.  I can see why a person would bring them to a potluck because they carry well.  I still like marshmallow treats better so I'm giving these an average rating.

This was a big hit at the office. Very easy to make. I read the other reviews and made it with Baby Ruth Candy bars as well. It didn't make very much though. I'll definately double the recipe next time. Yumm!

These are so easy to make. I added a cup of salted peanuts and they were really good.  I left off the melted chocolate chips because they were already pretty chocolatey. YUMMY!

This was delicious and sooo easy!  Much tastier (and I'm sure more fattening) than the plain crispy treats.  Next time I will not add the chocolate topping.  Ended up scraping it off because the topping was overbearing and we couldn't really tasty anything else.  Some may enjoy the extra chocolate, but my family asked that I leave it off next time.  Otherwise, fantastic, easy recipe.  Thanks, Cheryl, for helping me break my new year's resolution with this one!  LOL :)

Oh WOW! These were soooooo incredibly delicious. And easy! They took about 10 minutes to prepare, if that! They're probably tasty without the chocolate top, as someone suggested, but I would highly recommend it. It made them even more delicious. Oh and here's a tip, if you don't want to buy a whole bag of chocolate chips and your grocery has a bulk candy section,just buy a couple scoops of milk chocolate candy making wafers. I actually think they melt better! Thanks again! Great recipe!

This is now my emergency "need a treat" for any of my kids activities.  Quick, easy, rich and yummy.  Drizzled some white chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and carmel on top to dress it up for the cookie baskets we sent out for christmas.  Everyone who's tasted this has LOVED it.

I thought these were very good and addictive!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan, and I used half milk choc and half peanut butter chips.  The value pack of candy only had 6, so I bought 2 Milky Way Midnight bars to make 8.  I'll admit, it does taste like a Nestle' Crunch, but much better!!  The only complaint I had was how vigorously you need to stir the candy after it's melted (I used the microwave), to get it smooth (use a whisk).  Carpal tunnel sufferers, beware!

My family loved this recipe.  But, its not very caramel-y, more like a melted candy bar w/ rice krispies added (very rich).  I did omit the extra butter in the chocolate chips for the topping and it was fine.

These are just ok, nothing special. The only thing I really like about them is that they're a little different, have minimal ingredients and are easy to make. However, I think they were missing something and kind of boring. Too much chocolate and not enough of a caramel or other flavor. Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate, just not in this way  I guess.

This recipe is super easy, especially when using the microwave method. I also cut down the butter to 1/4 C. and using a spatula to smooth out the bars during melting time really works well. I did add about 4-5 heaping tablespoons of marshmallow fluff to the melted chocolate before the rice crispies only because I had it and it seemed like more melted ingredient was needed- but then I added 4 cups of the rice crispies-to fill the pan I was using. I just drizzled a little caramel topping and melted chocolate chips across the top due to reviews that said its not really needed. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, using Milky Way candy bars.  I couldn't get the candy bars and butter to mix together while melting.  I finally used my hand mixer.  The recipe says to use a 7X11 pan and cut into 32 pieces, which yields a serving size of 1.375 x 1.75.  (This is was important to me because of the carb count.)  The chocolate topping was too thick.  Topping that thick should be actual frosting, or much thinner, maybe drizzled (IMHO).  Then, for anyone concerned about peanut allergies, don't make these with Milky Way.  The label Milky Way label says 'may contain peanuts' not the more general 'made in a facility'.  I probably won't make these again given how much everyone likes the traditional recipe anyway, the carb count, and the peanut allergy, but would not discourage anyone else from trying the recipe as those are all very personal reasons. (11.28.08; 03.12.17)

I really didn't care for these. My husband didn't like them either. Too much chocolate. I thought the Milky Way flavor was out of place with a rice crispy type recipe. I like the plain Rice Crispy Treats, or you could add a layer of milk chocolate on top as is commonly done. This was just too much for us.

These are truly AMAZING!!! The chocolate/butter mixture that is poured over them melts in your mouth and the milky way flavor is like no other! I find that I can add more rice krispies to the melted milky way mixture and there will still be enough of it to coat all the cereal. DELICIOUS!!!!!

These are fantastic...and SO easy!  My variation was to mix in lightly salted, dry-roasted peanuts and some semi-sweet chocolate chips with the cereal and Milky Way, then to PRESS some more chocolate chips into the treat when in the pan.  I also used a square baking pan because I like mine thicker.  It looks like I'll have to double the recipe next time because we all wanted more!  
This really is better than any other rice krispy recipe I've ever made and so much easier (and with much less fuss).  Thanks Cheryl.

I made these last night and they are excellent!  Very rich, but very yummy.  I will definitely be making these again and taking them to potlucks in the future!

It sounded good so I decided to make it for a christmas party rather than the standard rice crispy treats. The flavor was good but the texture wasn't. Nobody really ate any of them.

These were delicious even though I left out 2 tablespoons of the butter and didn't put on the topping. I just sprinkled the milk chocolate chips on top. My only complaint is that the bars seemed greasy  even without the full amount of butter. The bars were still delicious and my family devoured them the first night. Thanks for an interesting variation of Rice Krispie treats.

What a wonderful, yummy recipe! Everyone liked the bars (down to the last crumb) and wanted the recipe. So easy to prepare too!

I've never made a rice crispie treat in my life, and made these for my daughter's end of the school year pool party because I didn't think I would like them and wouldn't be tempted.  WRONG!!!  I loved these and I thought the chocolate on top was what made them.

Really easy to make and they taste so good. The whole batch went in just over one day, and for my family that is very unusual. I wasnt sure if the milky way bars we have here in new zealand are the same as the ones used in the recipe (our ones are not nougat) so i used Cadburys moro bars instead and they worked perfectly.

I really liked the crispy part of it, but the chocolate on top never firmed up and melted when served.  Nobody seemed to mind too much :)

This were absolutely delicious and so simple to make.  I made them for a work bake-off and needless to say, they disappeared quickly.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful treat!

Cheryl was exactly right!  I had to go home and get the recipe to hand it out!  My 15 year old made it for me, so obviously it is kid-friendly.
