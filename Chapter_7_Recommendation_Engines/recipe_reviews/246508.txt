It doesn’t sound like this recipe would be good but it’s terrific!  I followed the directions exactly as written and I don’t think it needs any adjustments.  I wonder, though, if it would be as good with mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes. Certainly would be even healthier!

It’s good but make sure you make it for more than one person. It’s gets old fast.

This was a good comfort meal...I made it exactly as written.  Needed just a little more "pop", so I added more pepper to the leftovers and a tad more salt.  Maybe adding some red pepper flakes while it's cooking the next time will be just what it needs to make it 5 stars.  My kids did like it, though!  Thank you for the recipe. :)

I made this recipe as written. My wife and I both enjoyed this and I will definitely make this again. Being we enjoy food a little on the spicy side I will probably add some red pepper flake next time to kick it up a notch.
