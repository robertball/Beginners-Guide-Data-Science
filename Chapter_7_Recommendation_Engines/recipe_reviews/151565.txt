Thought the recipe was great - even my 3 picky boys liked it.  It was quick and easy.  I used my own broccoli cheese soup that I had made from this site...  so it served a "left over" purpose, too!

This is alright.  A little too salty for my tasty, probably because of the canned soup.  But is very easy to make!

This was good. It was creamy, and very easy to throw together. I did it as a breakfast for dinner option, and that was a nice change of pace. Seemed to be missing a little something, though I'm not sure what. Would probably try again and tweak a few things. Thanks for sharing!

A little too eggy for me. It was better the next day when I reheated it with salsa and used it as a breakfast burrito filling.
