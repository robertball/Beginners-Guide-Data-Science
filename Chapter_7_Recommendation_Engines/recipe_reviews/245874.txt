I made this for the first time and enjoyed it. I put a little more hot sauce ( Chipotle Tabasco). Used chopped red cabbage since I had some left over in fridge.  I also added some cooked Super Grains (white and red quinoa, millet, and buckwheat) for extra fiber.  This recipe was quick to make and easy on the budget.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! I definitely did some things different like add tomatoes to the salsa. Also cooked the tuna with lemon pepper, garlic, and chili powder seasonings. Turned out wonderful
