This was a great change from my usual dinners and the whole house loved it! I made the following minor changes. 
1) I prep my zucchini noodles by drying them on paper towels for a bit with a light sprinkle of salt to help draw out moisture.
2) I did not boil the noodles because that would add more moisture.  I just added them to the dish when I put in the spinach and let them cook a bit that way. They don't need long.
3) I used pork hot links instead of chicken sausage for some kick.
It came out great and I'm having the left overs today for lunch without cheese or tomatoes and it's still good.

Excellent,this will go into my dinner file. The uncooked tomatoes add a fresh taste to the whole dish.

I used both green and red bell peppers but that was my only change. This was really good! It was quick, healthy, colorful, and tasty and one I will make again.

Very tasty, but the sodium per serving is through the roof, due to the high sodium content in the chicken sausages.  Go for it, if your blood pressure needs a boost!

I was looking for a light meal for a hot summer day and this was perfect. I added more sausage and a bag of fresh spinach. My family loved it.

Loved it!  Fresh tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan along with a splash of fresh lemon juice makes this dish awesome!  Will make again and again with whatever seasonal veggies I have on hand.
