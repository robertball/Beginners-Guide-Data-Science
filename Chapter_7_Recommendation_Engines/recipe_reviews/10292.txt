These cookies are my holiday favorites.  I have been baking them at Christmas every year for about ten years now.  They have a great flavor and look festive on the cookie tray. Be careful not to overbake them - - very lightly browned is perfect for a slightly chewy, cheesecake taste.

Yummy!  Very delicate cheesecakey kind of taste.  

Just one note - my oven is a bit hotter than most, so the bottoms are a bit black.  Starting at 10 minutes, keep y our eye on them to make sure that the cookies don't burn!

I've been looking for a cream cheese based recipes since my sister lost hers.  I think this is as good if not better.  I loved it with the pecans but might add chopped red and green candied cherries next time for color.

These cookies were great!  Everyone loved them and they weren't difficult to make.  The only problem I had was that my pecans kept falling off.  I also made a batch with almonds instead of pecans and these were also wonderful.

These cookies were very easy to prepare and after refrigerating they were easy to cut and baked up just right.  Awesome flavor will definately make again.  Wonderful cookie!

These are good cookies that have a nice cream cheese flavor as long as you don't overbake them.  I left out the pecans because of personal preference but all the other ingredients were the same.  The bake time listed is way too long for 1/4 inch cookies.  10 minutes was perfect.

These cookies are amazing!  I never put the large pecan on each cookie and they still turn out incredible.  They're a huge hit every year.  Just watch them in the oven - they don't get very brown so don't just eyeball them, be sure to set a timer to know when to take them out.

Not very exciting.  They do taste good, but the dough was very hard to work with, It was way to soft and sticky even after refridgerating overnight.  They were hard to roll, hard to cut and didn"t come out looking very good.  The colors and pecans do make them look festive.  They were not a big hit.  I probably won't make them again.

These were really yummy! My only addition was that I added about 2 of 3 tsps of Almost Extract as well. I got RAVE reviews at our Christmas Tree Decorating Party! This will be added to my holiday favorite recipes for sure. Thanks for sharing :)

Very good. Almost like a shortbread. I had enough baking done with nuts, so instead I used chopped red and green candied cherries. Next time I will double the amount to 1 cup.

Added around 1 tsp. almond xtract and a little more vanilla.  One 10 oz. bag of pecan halves was more than enough.

I made these and they were very different but I thought they were really good my boyfriend loved them to but that might come with our obsession with cream cheese so if you don't like cream cheese at all then you probably won't like these very much.

Wonderful...I did not add vanilla, but almond extract...my dough was not sticky, but easy to work with...tasted very good with a mild cream cheese taste..rolled up easily and were not dry, but very moist...
