If you have trouble with the breading, it's best to make sure that your oil is very hot. I just got a  deep fryer and find it is better to cook them in there. If the breading is still falling off make sure that when you pull the chicken from the hot sauce that you make sure it isn't dripping wet. Let it quit dripping if you have to. Then make sure the flour mixture coats the chicken very well. Oher than that, I don't know why the breading would fall off. next time you make it and kids have some, try cutting them up into strips. That's the way I have made them from day one. And I always marinate them overnight. The longer the better. Thanks for trying the recipe.

I used boneless chicken breasts and cut them in half lengthwise for shorter cooking time. I marinated them 4 hours in a baggie with hot sauce, some cayenne pepper, season all salt and garlic powder.
For the coating I made an egg wash with 2 eggs, half a cup of milk and a splash of hot sauce.  In another bowl I mixed flour, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. I cut the chicken in strips and coated them with flour, dipped them in egg wash next then flour again.
In a frying pan I heated oil then fried them.  They were fabulous.  Will definitely be on my Fall list for football season finger food.

Overall, great recipe, great flavor, relatively easy prep, the kids loved it.  However, my coating was coming off in the oil during frying.  I only turned it twice.  Not sure what exactly went wrong with breading.  If breading would have stayed on better, could have been 4-5stars. If you have any suggestions about the breading write back. Thanks!

This was vary good it is the best chicken I have ever had.  I am only 12 years old, and I was able to make it by myself, with minimal supervision. It is great to marinate it the night before you want to have it.  The longer you marinate it, the spicer it gets.

Best chicken ever!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated in Cholula hot sauce all day.  Then mixed up the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, Tony Chacherer's seasoning, salt and pepper.  Then I dipped the chicken breasts into beaten eggs and milk, then flour mixture, eggs again and flour mixture again.  Delicious!  Will definitely use this recipe for chicken again and probably for chicken fried steak and pork chops.

I did as the recipe poster suggested and used chicken breasts cut up into finger like pieces instead of drumsticks.  They did cook faster and absorbed more marinade than the drumsticks did.  I also added garlic powder, about 1/4 cup white vinegar and cayenne pepper to the marinade (my hubby likes things spicy).  Ran low on coating mixture towards the end and thought I had ruined the last batch, but it turned out great regardless.  Have made several times and intend to continue!

My oldest son WOULD NOT eat chicken....until I made this recipe. It has a nice kick to it and I would liken the recipe to Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits Chicken Strips. A variation on this recipe would be to dip it into an egg mixture before the flour/cornstarch mixture and deep fry it.

Good idea, Marinating the chicken beasts in the hot sauce makes the chicken nice and tender. Easy to make and a joy to eat. I have tried it twice and find that adding hot pepper to the dry mix makes it a little hotter then just the red-hot. Also make a dipping sauce with butter and hot sauce goes well.
Thanks

I let it marinate for 4 hours and I was expecting it to be spicer.  I really couldn't taste the hot sauce, but it was good fried chicken.  Also, I used my deep fryer which cuts the cooking time by 10 minutes.

I will definitely marinate longer next time for more intense flavors, but I really like the coating.  I deep fried them and they turned out golden and crispy.

Unbelievable flavor and fairly simple. If you are searching for a delicious spicy fried chicken recipe, look no further. Let it marinate for at least a day. The hotter the oil, the better the breading stays on.

Good chicken, I didn't rate it 5 stars because I felt it was too bland. Next time I will add more seasoning and marinate the full 24 hours

Just had these for dinner and it came out okay. I used the Cholula hot sauce and marinated it for about 19 hours and it was not spicy. It could be the hot sauce, next time I will use Tabasco and hopefully it will come out spicy. I didn't have a problem with the flour falling off the chicken as did the other reviewers. The texture of it came out nice and crispy. I used a deep fryer set at 350 and had the chicken fried for about 15 minutes, and it came out golden and crispy. The first batch I made, I fried it for 20 minutes and It was a little  overdone. I would suggest to fry it for 15 minutes then check it. Other than that it was good.

This was good - but I could not taste the spice whatsoever in it after letting the chicken marinate in hot sauce for 4 hours.  I will make it again and let the chicken soak in the hot sauce for a full 24 hours to see if that brings in the spice.  The outside was perfectly crisp though, and I had no problem with the breading falling off during frying.  I dumped the chicken in a colander prior to putting it in the breading to drain any excess liquid, and I made sure my oil was plenty hot before adding it in.

Like another review said, try Tuong Ot Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. My Vietnamese friend introduced it to me years ago and i have been using it ever since to marinade chicken in. Its nice and thick so the breading stays on. I normally use breast meat, but i decided to try it with legs. I didn't like it as much as I thought i would but my husband loved them.

Nothing spectacular but it was good. I used Frank's hot sauce and marinated for a couple of hours. It wasn't hot at all.

My new favorite fried chicken.  Made this twice, once with just Asian Hot Chili Sauce and once divided the chicken and made 1/2 with  Hot Sauce and the other 1/2 with the Asian Hot Chili Sauce to compare.   The adults preferred the Hot Chili Sauce, for it has more flavor.  My children prefer the Hot Sauce, for it really isnt very hot at all.  I used Tuong Ot Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, its nice and thick and really coats the drumsticks.  I prefer it over the plain Hot Sauce, for I have no trouble with the batter coming off, as the Hot Sauce is very thin and doesnt really stick to the meat of the chicken.

I don't care for spicy, but DBF gave this 5 stars. He said the breading was perfect, although the whole shebang could have been spicier for his taste. I cooked in a deep fryer, and once they were out I tossed them in a mix of half hot sauce/half margarine, with a dash of garlic powder. Relatively quick and easy; I marinated for about 4 hours, next time I will do it overnight. Thanks for a great recipe, my man cleaned his plate!

Simple and great. I marinated mine for two nights so I rinsed the hot sauce off before coating and it was nicely spiced. The amount of cooking time was great. I halved the salt, and used only as much oil as I needed (maybe 1 cup by the end) - this recipe is a keeper!

This is a really good recipe. I refrigerated the chicken after coating with the flour for about 25 minutes and the coating did not come off.  I kept the oil between 300 and 325  and my chicken was done in just under 20 minutes. I will be making this recipe again.

I guess what I am rating is the breading because I didn't do the hot sauce thing.i just left my chicken overnight in salt water  and then followed the recipe for the breading. I had no problem with the breading falling off or sticking. I used wings and drumeets. It came out really good and flavorful. I will be doing this again. Next time maybe I will try the got sauce if I make it for someone who likes spicy stuff.

I would give this no stars if i could. I really don't know how so many people liked it. It tasted sour and bitter to me and the coating on the chicken did not stay on and gave nothing to the over all flavor of the dish. My boyfriend thought it was ok but i couldn't even finish mine.

My whole family liked this!  I did make a few changes.  I marinated the chicken legs with skin in hot sauce & Chili powder for 2 hours, rubbing the marinade under the skin as well.  Then made an egg wash with milk & eggs, then made a breading with flour, garlic salt & chili powder.  I deep fried it first to get a crispy brown skin, then baked it for about 15 minutes on 400 degrees & it turned out great!  Will definitely make again!  Though next time I may try skinless boneless chicken breast cut in strips.  Served with hot sauce & butter dip & ranch!  YUM!!!

Very delicious! This one is a keeper that all of my family asks for repeatedly.  I marinate 2 batches - 1 as per recipe for the kids, and 1 adding a substantial amount of Tabasco to raise the heat level.  I like chicken breast strips or deboned thighs to lessen cooktime.  Hint:  Cover your cooktop with foil so the grease splatters are easier to clean up!

These were pretty good.  Changed the recipe a little bit though.  Used Shake n' Bake instead of flour and cornmeal, and baked instead of frying.

And to the person below that was confused about the oil, none goes in the marinade, it's all for frying.  The marinade is the hot sauce only.

OH MY GOSH!!!  We loved this!  I marinated all night in Cholula per some other reviews I read.  When I coated with the flour I also added some red pepper flakes, and cayenne.  After frying it up we dipped the chicken in extra Cholula on the side.  I almost passed out it was so delish.  Let me tell you....I feel sorry for the folks out there who have not discovered this website yet.  My cooking used to be so boring....not anymore!

Good, good, good!  We only eat breasts so that is what I used.  Did an egg wash w/ few splashes hot sauce in it.  Dredged in flour/corn meal w/ cayenne. Marinated all day (8 hours). I've also used boneless/skinless ckn breasts and cut into strips for spicy tenders.  Then melt 1/2 stick butter in saucepan, add bottle of tabasco and squirt of honey.  I then pour this over the chicken or use as a dipping sauce!  DELISH!

I used chicken breasts because that's what I had available.  I also used tapatio hot sauce, since I'm not a fan of hot pepper sauce.  I think it could have used a lot more hot sauce than what was listed.  I even let it marinade for around 3 hours.  Maybe next time I'll let it go for an entire day.  That should up the spiciness.

I couldn't remember it exactly and didn't have access to it, so what I did was marinate them in Frank's hot sauce for about 30 minutes, coated them in flour and deep fried them, then dipped them in wing sauce.  It was the most delicious chicken I've ever had!  I'd make it again, but it was too spicy for the boyfriend.  Maybe some wimpy ones for him will do the trick!

This was a very good recipe.  The one mistake I made was...the oil wasn't hot enough for the first batch, therefore some of the coating came off.  Got it right on the 2nd batch and it was extremely crunchy on the outside and yummy!  Thanks!

This was very tasty and we all loved it, although we were expecting spicier.  Definitely let the chicken marinate as long as possible.  I tried both the skinless drumsticks and boneless skinless breasts cut into uniform strips using my new deepfryer.  Both were delicious, but I'll probably do just the breasts for ease when I make this again.  The coating is tasty and a nice change.  We only could taste a hint of the hot sauce (we used Frank's) on the chicken.  We like our wings hot, so we had to add more hot sauce for dipping, and served blue cheese on the side.

Absolutely delicious.  I generally don't like dark poultry meat, but it didn't matter this time.  Just the right amount of spice for our family as well.  I suggest skinning the chicken while it is partially froze.  Much easier.

I did use cholula, as i read in one of the reviews, added a bit of old bay to the flour mixture, and cut the bnless/skinless breasts  into chicken fingers and deep fried.. My husband and nephew had forks and fingers flying..LOL was a joy to watch them eat.

I used skinless bonelss thighs, added 2 tsp spicy oil to marinade,added garlic powder, Herbamare seasoned salt and Club House spicy pepper medley to flour, placed breaded chicken on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and baked at 325 degree for 25 mins.  This turned out moist and flavourful.

I made this recipe twice.  First time using drumsticks and again using chicken breast cut up into strips.  I would recommend using the chicken breast instead of drumsticks, it cooks so much faster and the breading stays on the chicken, when I made the drumsticks there was no coating left after all the cooking.  The flavour is very nice.  Everyone enjoyed this so much!

This recipe was awesome!  As I read in a couple reviews, I too first used an egg wash to make sure the coating would stick and added a little cayenne & garlic powder to the dry mixture and melted some butter and combined it with sriracha sauce for a GREAT dipping sauce.  Will definitely be making this again!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I am not originally from the south so fried chicken is not something that comes easy for me. I have messed up fried chicken chicken twice in the past and vowed never to make it again. (I do have my pride after all) I have since been diagnosed with a gluten allergy (wheat, barley, and rye) and cannot not eat fried chicken in a restaurant. I made this with gluten-free all purpose flour, gluten-free corn meal and gluten free hot sauce. This turned our great! My husband, who did grow up in the south, said this could be served in any restaurant! Thanks for the recipe!

I love this and it has inspired me to branch out with this recipe. The Drumsticks were such a hit! I love to get some friends together for a fried chicken night and make some home made mashed potatos, biscuits and gravy! YUMMM! Thanks for the great recipe! 

I also tried this with Chicken Tenders and my husband really enjoyed it. The last time I made this, I used Thin Chicken Breasts and put on Hamburger Buns with Pepperjack Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, and Ranch dressing! Everyone loved them.

The kids enjoyed these after marinating for only 1-2 hours.  If you like it spicy I would suggest longer marinating and adding paprika and cayenne pepper to the batter.

Very good!  I actually froze my chicken breasts with the hot sauce and added pepper to it.  Then added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt & pepper to the flour mixture.  They turned out very juicy & delicious.  The kids loved them.

I waited to review until I had made this twice, first with drumsticks and the second with breast. The breast worked best. My problem with it both times was the lack of heat, not much firecracker to them. I also had a hard time with the coating falling off every time I turned over a piece.

Definitely good, not over the top, though.  I marinated for almost 24 hours and it had a little kick but not much.  It did have nice flavor.  I might make it again, if I get a request, but the frying was a lot of work and a lot of mess.

Never tried frying drumsticks before. Easy recipe. I used tabasco sauce and a deepfryer. It only took 13 min for me at 375 degrees.

Awesome recipe. I marinated the chicken for about 18 hours, but it wasn't spicy at all. Great flavor, but not spicy. That was fine with me as I had assumed I wouldn't be able to eat these (made them with my fiance in mind). I made an egg wash with 1 egg, a splash of milk, and a little garlic powder. I also added cayenne pepper and black pepper to the flour coating. I coated in flour, then egg, then flour again. I was nervous as this was my first time frying chicken, but it turned out very well! Thank you, I'll make these again soon!

Wow! These were tastey. I cut up some chicken breasts before church and covered them with Franks hot wing sauce and placed in the fridge. When I got home I only had to batter the strips and fry. I didn't use very much oil and cooked about 5-7 minutes each side. These had a WONDERFUL taste. These are easy to make and much cheaper than the strips from Tyson. This will become one of our regulars. Thanks for the recipe!

I like this recipe.  1 hour to marinate is not enough and 24 hours is too spicy for me.  It depends on the pepper sauce used, I'm sure.

I have never ever cooked chicken before, and I came across this recipe that is easy enough. The finished product turned out okay. Not bad for my first chicken dish. On my gas stove, the estimated time was longer than what it took to actually cook, I'd say about 20 mintues is good enough. I let the marinade sit for two hours, but I didn't find this spicy at all. Next time, I will try and let sit overnight and try a much spicer hot sauce or maybe a jerk chicken marinade and also, adding a bit of garlic or ground cayenne may even help add to the flavor. This was easy enough to follow and still tasty regardless of spice factor. I will try more variations on this recipe to perfect it.

Excellent recipe! I let the drumsticks soak overnight- and it was delicious! Fixed a boneless breast for my mother - she loved it!!!
We will definitely be fixing this one on a regular basis.

Husband loved it but didn't give it 5 stars because I did the drumsticks and he felt like after he'd eaten the skin it was just regular tasting chicken. Will try again next week with skinless chicken breasts instead, marinate will probably better absorb all the way through the chicken.

Used drumsticks as recipe called for it. Also used egg/milk dip before dredging in the flour. Fried until golden brown and then finished in a hot oven and it came out great.

these are always welcome at super bowl parties! I use Franks Red Hot wing sauce, worcestershire and cayenne and leave the skin on to soak for at least 24 hours. I add more cayenne to the batter as a lot of the sauce burns off in the oil. Make sure the oil  is HOT. Awesome for chicken fingers too.

1rst time FIVE STARS: Very easy and very yummy, I did cover them with the flour mix first then in egg then with the mix. My children loved them. 

2.d time ONE STAR:  The drumstiks started bleeding like crazy as I fried them. When I took them out of the frying pan they were covered in blood and nobody wanted to eat them. I dont know how to avoid this.

3rd time: I havent done them again, but I found this advice here in all recipes: "In response to the person who did not like the blood coming out of the chicken. Soak the chicken in 1/4 cup of salt for at least an hour, it will draw out the blood." I'll do it like that next time.

This is really good, but just as a helpful hint though, try dipping the chicken in flour, then some egg, and then your breading mixture before you put in in the frying pan.  Also, make sure the pan is hot before you put the chicken in.  I've found that working with a deep fryer is much easier though.  This is really good though.  My Hubby likes hot food, so I'm always in search of something new, and this turned out great.

Troy really loved these.  Didn't have cornmeal so I just added some breadcrumbs instead. We used Franks Red Hot Sauce.  It wasn't spicy, but tasted like hot sauce.  Really tender.

I made this recipe a second time and it came out much better than the first. I only marinated it for two hours, but I added lots of cayenne pepper with the flour and also with the marinade.  The egg wash worked very well and next time I'll add the seasoned salt to see what kind of flavor and kick comes out of that combo.

These were awesome. My fiance said that this is his new favorite chicken wing. The only downfall is that I didn't marinate these long enough (only 2 hours), so there was only a hint of the hot sauce on the chicken. I actually used a 3 lb bag of chicken wings and multiplied everything else by 4. I added a little paprika and cayenne pepper to the flour mixture, and I deep fried the chicken. I was nervous about putting so many chicken wings in the bag to coat, but it coated them very well. This is a great, fast technique. I heated up some hot sauce with butter (equal amounts of each)and some garlic powder and pepper on the stove for dipping in fear that they wouldn't be hot enough since I didn't marinate them long enough. We dipped our chicken in the hot sauce mixture and also had a side of ranch for dipping. I will definitely make these again, but next time I will marinate them for at least 24 hours.

I just made this for dinner for my boyfriend and I. I used a pound of chicken breasts and cut them up into 1-2 inch strips. I also used a mixture of 1/3 cup of buffalo sauce and a teaspoon of chipotle sauce instead of the hot pepper sauce for the marinade. I used white corn meal instead of yellow, but i don't think that made much of a difference. Oh! and i also added a teaspoon of Tony Chachere's Famous Creole Seasoning to the coating mixture. I only marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, but the buffalo sauce mixture really added a nice kick! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I loved the recipe but will try this with different hot sauce next time.  I found it had a vinegar taste and put it down to the sauce.  However, this was easy and the best fried chicken I've made.  I really liked the coating.  I used only half the oil and it was fine and as with any fried food it has to be watched and tested.  My friends and I really liked the crunchiness and moistness.

This got rave reviews from my husband who doesn't normally rave about anything.  Next time I plan on marinating it longer (only marinated it for about an hour) and that's about it.  Fantastic recipe.  Thanks!

Since hot sauce has plenty of it, I eliminated the salt and added in my own seasonings. Used this with tilapia and my family absolutely LOVED it! Thank you, Tisha!

Unfortunatley I didn't have any cornmeal but the chicken was fantastic without it.   Very easy way to spice up fried chicken.  This recipe is a favourite now.

I added some spices to the flour/cornmeal coating and everyone loved it. My hot sauce wasn't spicy enough for my dad and husband. So if you like these spicy, use a favorite hot sauce and your set. A good solid recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was really delicious!  I used wings and drummets for a family gathering and everyone loved it....the platter was empty before I had a chance for seconds.  One thing I will keep in mind when I make this again is to double the hot sauce (I didn't think it was spicy enough even after marinating it overnight.)

Wow!! Where's the fire in firecracker??  Ok, so next time I need to double the hot pepper sause and maybe add some spices.  Have to say though my little 3 year old scrapped 2 leggs clean! The breading was great also. I am planning to make this again

The chicken tasted great, but I was expecting a little more spice/heat.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce and marinated for 3 hours, but could not really taste it at all.  Next time, I'll use a hotter sauce (like Tabasco) or marinate overnight.  Otherwise, the coating was great and the drumsticks fried up perfectly in about 25 minutes.

Very good fried chicken!  I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into strips and marinated them in Texas Pete hot sauce for about 8 hours.  I could taste the hot sauce flavor, but it wasn't at all spicy.  I will be making these a lot, but I might try Frank's Red Hot Sauce next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was excellant!  This was my first friend chicken attempt and my picky boyfriend just loved it. I used drumsticks. It was a lot of work to get the skin off the chicken, but definitely worth it.  I just pulled it down towards the end then used scissors to cut it off. I think the key to keep your oil at the right temperature, right around 350 degrees.  I marinated for about 8 hours in Jim Beam hot sauce.  Great flavor.  Not spicy at all.  I think I'll marinate longer next time for a little extra kick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so easy and SOOOO DELICIOUS.    Even though you marinate the drumsticks in hot sauce the chicken, when cooked, is not very hot.   I made 6 drumsticks for the two of us.  I ate two and my other half ate the other four.   WOW.    This is on my "keep" list.

Fantastic.  Followed recipe exactly, using Louisiana hot sauce.  Make it once a week now.  I can put the marinating chicken pieces in the freezer and thaw them whenever I need to in the morning before I leave for work.  Best chicken recipe I have ever made.

I didn't have time to marinate the chicken so I just coated real well with some hot wing sauce.  I used half flour and half corn flour.  It is the best chicken I have ever made!  I can't wait till I have time to marinate it!

if I could give this recipe 10 stars, I honestly would. Delicious to the T. The cornmeal gives it that special crunch, so do not skip out on that. The secret to getting the flour mix to stick on the chicken properly is to make sure the chicken is drenched in the hot sauce before you dip it in the flour mix and make sure the oil is very hot. (med-high should do, so chicken dont burn but does turn that beautiful golden color)

This was SO good!  If you are a fan of Popeye's Louisana Fried Chicken, you will LOVE this recipe.  Wasn't quite as spicy as I would like it, but I only marinated for a couple of hours, because I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids.  Was loved by all.  Will definitely make again!!

Absolutely phenomenal!! Juicy and tender.  I marinated in hot sauce for about 4 hours.  I would use more salt next time but the meat was fall of the bone juicy and super crispy/flavorful on the outside.  A lot better than any of the chain fried chicken places.

This was wonderful the first time I tried the recipe with chicken drumsticks.  My DH loved it!  The second time, I tried chicken tenders - sensational!!  The tenders cooked quickly, and by only turning them over once in the pan, the coating adhered to the chicken better.  A definite repeater for us!!

Loved this chicken! A change from regular fried chicken. Followed directions exactly. Only used 4 drumsticks as there are just two of us, and the only other ingredient that I halved was the hot sauce. I allowed the chicken to marinate for only one hour as my BF does not like spicey food. Just a hit of sauce. We decided next time to marinate for 2-3 hours. You could taste the sauce, but not the heat. Had no problems with the breading falling off. Just allow the side to get crispy before turning and keep oil hot. Copied this recipe and put in my recipe box immediately after super!!

Used Franks Red Hot Sauce and left out the cornmeal.  Yummo!!  The sauce wasn't overpowering but you could still taste a hint of it.

I marinated in hot sauce for atleast 36 hours and you really couldn't taste the heat. I would have rather just made fried chicken or baked chicken and put hot sauce on it. It was kind of a waste of hot sauce. I also didn't like the yellow cornmeal, it gave the crust kind of a rough texture rather than crispy. I did have some trouble with the breading sticking but I think that was my fault because this was my first time making fried chicken at home. Will keep looking for the right recipe and practicing!!! Thanks for the practice.

I followed the recipe but somehow my chicken came out pretty gross. The coating did not taste good and on medium high heat they were done in way less than 25 mins, and even then they got burnt on one side. I would not try this recipe again.

Where's the heat???  I marinated for 8 hours and couldn't detect any spiciness at all.  I used Tabasco and would have thought it would have some punch.  As fried chicken goes, it was okay, but we were disappointed that we had to get liberal with the Tabasco at the table in order to tickle our tastebuds.

This was not a healthy dinner. My family and I like spicy, but, this wasn't that spicy after marinating for 8 hours. I even added Red Hot to the egg/milk mix before dipping it in the cornmeal breading. I also am not a fan of frying and the breading didn't stay on even after dipping in the egg mix. I won't make this again.

These are good & easy to make. Everyone ate them & no one complained. We were all looking for something with a kick to it though. You could taste the marinade but not the spiciness of it.

I made this for my husband who loves drumsticks and his comment was that he prefers the flour breadding over the corn meal that this one uses.  Also, both my husband and son said that it wasn't spicy enough. I only gave 3 stars because with a name like Firecracker Fried Chicken I expected it to have a "pop" and it did not. I don't think it is a bad recipe, just not what we expected and our taste.

This was a great recipe!!  I only gave it four stars as I expected the chicken to be spicier.  I used my regular hot sauce and marinated the chicken for more than 24hrs but it wasn't spicy.  The chicken was very moist and had lots of flavor...I will DEFINITELY be adding this to my list of favorites!!  Thanx!

This chicken was great! I made a change in my marinade, choosing to use buffalo wing sauce with a few dashes of hot sauce.  It tasted like wings but without all the mess.  We loved it.

These had a very good flavor. However, the breading started to fall of as other reviewers said. I am experienced at making fried chicken & the batter has never fallen off. It must have something to do with the hot sauce. I would make again if I was sure the breading would stay on.

I used Ken's Buffalo Wing Marinade, and added quite a bit of Tabasco to the 2 dozen wing pieces I chose to use (instead of drumsticks).  I accidentally let them marinate for 48 hours (no time to cook), then breaded half and fried, and baked the rest.  My boyfriend much preferred the baked ones to the fried ones, saying that the flavor was better.  I was disappointed at the lack of heat and spiciness, but maybe next time I'll just use only Tabasco.  They were still tasty wings, and I liked the breading very much.

First attempt at frying chicken on the stove top and it was a huge success. Not sure why some complained about a lack of flavor - I marinated for 3 1/2 to 4 hours and it was loaded with heat. I slightly pierced the chicken with a fork to help the marinade soak in a little so maybe that helped. Too intense for one of my sons, but he still gave it a thumbs up. Very juicy. Can't wait for my husband to get home from work and give it a taste. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic! I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce and marinated the chicken for about 3 hours. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into strips to cook faster. My husband was amazed at how good this chicken turned out! We will definitely use this recipe again.

This is how I've always made my chicken tenders but I saw this recipes and was checking out the calories PER serving...1,775?????? Is that right? And this recipe makes 4 servings. That CANT be right. I saw someone comment on the calories from fat or something which was 175 so I'm assuming the calories has to be a typo. What's the correct calories on this??

My husband made this as an alternative to his craving for hot wings. He followed the recipe and found it to be lacking enough spicyness. He used a generic brand hot wing sauce. He pulled out "Frank's" hot sauce for dipping. I will encourage him to read other reviews next time. Next time he'll probably use "Frank's" for the marinade. :)

I give this a 4 star....Overall I enjoyed it...However I kept the skin on the chicken, cause I could not be bothered. I then folowed another review and just coated the chicken bake with shake and bake with added spices, like chili powder and garlic salt,then put them in the oven. They still came out tasting like chicken wings. (However I dont think this is the way they would actually taste if I did as per the actual recipe) I put ranch on the side and served with rice. I probably wont make it this way again...However I will try the actual recipe next time!!!

I thought this recipes was great--not too spicy but had a great kick!  I let my chicken marinade for about 3 hours before cooking--next time I'm going to let it sit for longer.

This was a good and easy way to prepare chicken. Next time though, I will marinate the chicken for definitely longer than 1-hour. there wasn't enough spiciness for the hour that i put in. I also added a dash of paprika and garlic salt to the flour mixture - and it turned out pretty well. Will definitely try it again. I've got my pepper sauce on standby :D

If we could give this recipe more than 5 stars, we would!  We used chicken cutlets marinated in LA Gold (hot sauce) for approx. 6 hrs.  The combo of flour & cornmeal made an excellent coating for the chicken.  Make this one!!!

I used chicken breast and La hot sauce. The chicken marinated in the hot sauce for about 6 hours. We liked it but don't know if its something I will ever fix again.

This chicken is good. If you can't handle hot food, i wouldnt recommend leaving the chicken marinating for more than an hour. Also, I tried this recipe with  chicken breast in an attempt to make boneless hot wings, not a good idea.

This was a great recipe!  I used drumsticks and it was kind of a pain getting the skin all the way off.  I think I missed some very small spots and it made it a little too crispy (hard) in some areas.  I think next time I will use the boneless, skinless breast instead.  Also, I only let it marinate for about 30 minutes.  I think it would be more flavorful if I marinted it longer next time.

Just got done eating.  Me and my girlfriend loved it!  Also, it was my first attempt at a fried chicken recipe.  I used Red Devil sauce to marinate.  Not spicy enough for my taste.  Next time, I'll probably try tabasco or something hotter!  Either way, this turned out excellent.  I give it 5 stars.

I made these in my deep fryer--cooked for 25-30 mins, and they were fantastic.  I didn't have bread crumbs of any sort, so I did a flour coating with chili seasoning and some extra pepper.  I would definately marinate for at least 4 hrs too. Terrific!!!  Can't wait to make this the way I'm actually supposed to.

I used Datil, Habanero and Cayenne pepper sauce as my marinade...Marinated for 12 hours and my chicken legs were spicy and fantastic...The Datil added an exotic flavor too...Thanks for the recipe...

Marinated for 6 hours and was not excited with flavor.  Might be better with chicken breasts.  Drumsticks need to cook too long for crust.  I did like the addition of small amount of cornmeal.

This recipe turned out great! I used skin on thighs and drums. I was worried about some of the reviews that said it wasn’t spicy enough so I marinated my chicken for 24 hours in ground chili paste. It worked great! Just the right amount of spice. I had no problem with the breading falling off but I did refrigerate it after breading for about 25-30mins.

Love this chicken dish, ate it with rice and beans. Just a small note, I added a half teaspoon of Paul Prudhomme's to the flour mix and it perked up the chicken in a very delicious way. Had a couple drumsticks left and ate them the next day as well. 
So Delish!

I made this as written, with the adjustment of servings. Since I was making it just for me. I thought it tasted pretty good. I marinated it for about 20hrs. Just enough time for the hot sauce to be part of the whole flavor of the chicken

We loved the breading, nice flavour and crispiness! Marinated in extra hot hot sauce for 24 hours and added a bit of cayenne to the breading, but there still wasn't much spice to it. Will add more cayenne next time for sure! 

Deep fried in the deep fryer at 356 C for 15 minutes (as per my Google research) and they were perfect, 25 minutes seemed like way too long.

This chicken was amazing. My boyfriends family is fairly picky and they loved it! Super crispy skin and tender meat..made for a perfect dinner. The only thing I would say is I would add more hot sauce or let it marinate longer, because I didn't get any heat when I made it.

These were very good.  I fried them in a deep fryer got very worried when they cooked very quickly and looked like they were going to burn.  They were pretty dark but still very good.  I don't like hot food so I used Chicken wing sauce instead of hot sauce and I marinated it for about 3 hours it did not come out spicy.  I will make this recipe again

I used drumsticks and marinated them for 7 hours.  Didn't have any cornmeal so I opened a Jiffy Box of cornbread mix and used that instead.  I thought it was good, the batter stayed on the chicken but maybe my oil was too hot as I felt it wasn't cooked enough close to the bone.  I'll make again but will follow the advice of others and will use chicken strips

This was very good, but I should have used a hotter sauce, and I noticed the skin was falling off during cooking. I read a little more and realized I didn't let the hot sauce stop dripping before adding the coating. My heat was way down after adding the chicken and wonder if that added to the problem. Next time I will do better!!! Overall, very tasty.

I used Sriracha sauce to marinate. Threw in some minced onion, pepper, garlic salt, and salt in the flour mix, and it had a well rounded flavor. I wish that I would have let it marinate longer for more pep. The corn meal gave it an interesting but appealing texture.

You couldn't taste the hot sauce. It was a good breading but not much flavor. I marinated mine for about 6 or 8 hours.

I marinated overnight, used shake and bake (Southern fried) and baked in the oven. Everyone enjoyed and will definitely make again!

This chicken was relatively easy to make despite the fact that I didn't have any hot sauce, so I made my own with tomato sauce and spices; and I had to skin the chicken for my husband (which is harder than it sounds). I have one question though: the nutrition facts given in a side bar for this recipe state 175.1g fat PER SERVING...is this accurate or is that a typo?!?!?!

This was good, but despite marinating for 24 hrs still wasn't spicy. I think next time I'll try adding spices to the breading. Basically it's fried chicken with a little kick of hot sauce. Good, but not as spicy as I'd hoped.

This was pretty good.  Not as spicy as I had hoped.  After cooking I served the chicken with extra hot sauce for dipping.

I did NOT make this recipe because I was unclear how much of the oil was for the marinade and how much was to be used for frying. Can anyone tell me?

Crunchy and tender. A tad lacking in spiciness though, but that is probably due to us liking spicier food. Good recipe. Thank you for sharing.
