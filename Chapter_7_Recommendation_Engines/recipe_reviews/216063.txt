The cooking time should probably be raised from 40 minutes to 45-50 minutes. The "ends" of the cake were delicious, but the center of the cake was sunken like a well and gooey beneath it.  This is an excellent recipe, but something's wrong with the cooking time.  I have a new oven and I pre-heated it, so I think I'm on target.  Would love to hear if others had the same problem and what their solution was because I want to perfect this recipe.  Thanks!!!

This was awesome. It is a little thick for a cake, so most people only had a small serving.  However I was very impressed with the flavor and the overall taste. I will definitely make this again.

The main issue I had with this cake was the baking time.  I made this knowing I had to leave the house 1 hour from the time I put it into the oven, and even though it was supposed to only have to bake for 40 minutes, it was still raw in the middle after the full hour.  Being that I HAD to leave, I took it out and we ended up only eating the edges of the loaf.  The flavor was great - I love almond flavoring.  And I really liked the fresh oranges on top.  I ended up scraping them off with the frosting and adding the mixture to the pieces that were edible.  I would recommend making this cake, just leave yourself plenty of time to bake.

Perfect. Very moist and lightly orange. I wouldn't change a thing.

The pound cake is very delicious and flavorful.  It is a heavy cake, so smaller portion sizes are better to start.  There was too  much icing per the recipe directions, so I would cut back on the icing next time. I will definitely make this again.
