Pretty sure the author meant to beat the sugar with the butter until fluffy...

The cake is delicious! I added 1 cup of fresh grated coconut to the prepared batter.  The cake was even better the second day.  I used the Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting from this website.  The frosting was loose and made a mess out of the cake...but it was tasty!

This cake is wonderful. I'm surprised it doesn't have more reviews. Very easy to make and turns out very moist and delicious. I used 2 tsp. of vanilla, no almond extract, and added a cup of sweetened coconut flakes to the batter. Also, I used three 8" pans which made a taller cake. Frosted it with the buttercream frosting from this site and sprinkled more coconut on top. It looked magnificent, very impressive. No one would ever guess how easy it was to make. I'll definitely be making this again.

I love anything with coconut so this recipe was perfect! The cake turned out moist, fluffy and flavourful. The only thing I would change would be to add grated coconut in the cake.
I followed the recipe except I had to substitute margarine for the butter because I didn't have any. 
I didn't add filling and iced it with white icing. Delicious!

Ingredients does list the sugar however Directions does not say to beat SUGAR with butter until fluffy.  I almost missed adding it to the batter. Other than that, this was a very easy cake to put together.  I opted to bake in a 9X13 baking pan @ 350*.  I added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract to the batter as well as the vanilla & almond extract called for in recipe.  I frosted with cream cheese frosting that I added some coconut extract, shredded coconut and a little of the leftover coconut milk.  Yum!!!!! Just don't forget to add the sugar.

Really great recipe.  I creamed the sugar and butter and added 1 cup coconut.  It was moist and not too sweet. Kept well also.

This cake turned out great without substitutions. I was planning to put coconut in the batter as some reviewers did, but I forgot. Glad I did. I used Buttercream Coconut Frosting from this site (double batch) to frost this triple layer cake, and it had lots of coconut flavor. I also made a pineapple jam that I put between one layer, which was a delicious complementary taste. Will definitely make this again.

This cake is wonderful. The only change I made was to replace the almond flavor and the vanilla with coconut flavoring.

The cake came out beautiful and was delicious. My Sis asked for the recipe. Had to substitute Organic Coconut Milk for Heavy Cream, as that's what I had. Recipe is a keeper. 

I, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, used the Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting from this website. Worked up great.

 Please correct the recipe instuctions to blend the sugar and butter. This error could have caused a disaster.

This was a very simple yet delicious Coconut Cake compared to other reviews on Allrecipes & YouTube! 
The cake itself was light, fluffy & moist which really surprised me since it is baked in 375 degree oven.
Hate to rate when I've made a  couple changes to the recipe but I'm convinced the cake would of turned out great w/o the changes.
1) Like other reviewers I added 1 cup of sweetened shredded coconut to the batter. When I first looked at this recipe & before I read tge reviews I knew off hand that this addition was a must.  2) I decrease Almond extract to 1/4 tsp (this was a preference  because Almond extract has extremely strong flavor IMO.) 3) I used Real Buttermilk in place of Coconut milk. A lot of recipes I viewed prior called for Real Buttermilk so I knew it was acceptable. 
Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the texture & taste of this cake. The simplicity of such a delicious cake alone is enough to make it a keeper!!
