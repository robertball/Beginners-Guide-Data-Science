This wasn't very spicy at all, but it added a ton of flavor and tenderized the steaks too.  Marinated in a ziploc bag for 2 days, then cooked them on the George Foreman grill (1in = 3min for medium)

I love my food really spicy, my family doesn't. But we all loved this sauce.

Made as written and this worked really well. The recipe title is deceiving though. When you hear BBQ sauce you think of enough to dip your grilled or smoked meat in. This makes a tiny batch and really only enough to work as a marinade which is what I did. If you want this as a dipping type sauce I recommend tripling (or more) the recipe. The flavors in this work well together and this is one I would definitely make again.
