This was really good, I tasted like Wasabi kinda. I ended up adding a tablespoon of Horseradish. It was really yummy!!

Very tasty! Quick and easy to make, and a nice substitute for mashed potatoes. I wonder if a substitution of wasabi for the horseradish would be just as good.

What a way to get away from potatoes!  Great flavor and easy to make AND it did reheat well in the microwave the next day.  Only problem, no left-overs!!

My wife can't get enough of this recipe. If you have trouble finding Broccoflower, use 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 cauliflower for the identical flavor! Add some wasabi for a little kick.

This recipe was a great success. I agree with adding a lot more horseradish, even 2 tbsp would be great I think. Also, I used some soup stock rather than butter to smooth the mash but lower the fat and adding some chopped parsley gave a nice additional flavour note.
