I have been using this recipe for 9 years!!  I make these minor changes:  margarine instead of butter, 4 cups quick oats/5 cups rolled oats, and a bag of M&Ms.  Because it's such a huge batch, I make them only once a year--for my service anniversary at work.  People anticipate them and they are gone in a flash!  EVERYONE LOVES THEM!!

My fmaily LOVES these cookies. I couldn't find "my" recipe for these and this one is even better. I did add a bag of M&M's -- that's what my old recipe called for and I had them on hand. I think the secret for these is to have a hot preheated oven and only bake for time suggested. This makes a crunchy on the outside but chewy on the inside cookie.

If you decide to make this cookie, use parchment paper.

I had my doubts about these, not just because I was using tahini (sesame paste) instead of peanut butter, but also because the batter was extremely stiff, so much so that I actually had trouble stirring in the chocolate chips.  But they were excellent - maybe the best cookies I've ever had!  I made sure to take them out of the oven at the specified time, although they were only firm at the edges and still seemed underdone in the middle, and I also found that they were wonderfully crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Just don't make too many at a time - you might find it hard to stop eating them!

This recipe is really good. If you make the cookies normal-size, it makes soooooo many. I've cut the recipe down to 1/6th before, and it still made 9 huge cookes. It literally could have made 4 dozen regular size cookies. So just be prepared. In my oven, I bake them just under 12 minutes, that keeps them more chewier instead of crispier. I definitely recommend this recipe. Also, I got huge compliments on these cookies. That's always nice.

I can't stop eating these! I substituted M&M's for the chocolate chips and they were perfect. Don't over-cook them - they just look under-done, but trust me, they're done! Great recipe!

I lost my recipe for these cookies and tried these. I only made a couple minor adjustments. I added 1c flour as others suggested. I increased the peanut butter to 3 cups and added M & Ms and Reeses Pieces. Used white chocolate chips, because that was all I had on hand. What a great recipe! The cookies held together well and were delicious. It made a huge batch, which was great, as we have a large family. Thanks!

I thought this was an awesome recipe. I added 1 cup of M&M's and only used 1 cups chocolate chips. I brought these to our church picnic, they were a hit.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made! I added peanut butter m & m's to the batter and they tasted great. I thought the absence of flour and the abundance of oatmeal would make for a tough texture but I was so wrong. They came out chewy on the inside and just a tad crunchy on the exterior.

This is actually very close to the first monster cookie recipe i ever saw. just a lot smaller.  That one started with 1LB butter, 2lb brown sugar and 4 cups of white sugar ended with 1 lb choc chip and 1lb of m&ms. This size is much more manageable.

The cookies were delicious!  My 5 year old and I had a blast baking them together.   I didn't realize the yield was so big and now have sections in the freezer for later cookie cravings.  I strongly recommend using pretzel M&M's in place of the chocolate chips for an extra salty crunch.  I measured them out with a 1/4 cup to make monster-sized monster cookies.  They baked for 20 minutes.

I made these today because of the blizzard and we were snowed in - the kids LOVED these cookies!  I followed the recipes exactly, but cut it in half.  I baked the cookies 12 minutes till they were golden brown around the edges, they were perfectly chewy and crispy.

This is our favourite cookie recipe.  My daughter decided that mini-marshmallows would be a great addition and they made it awesome.  We usually throw about 2 hands full in.

Can I rate this 10 stars?  My mom and I used to make these when I was a kid.  And now my kids love them!  I added Rieces  Pieces candies to these, just like in the old days.

Everyone is raving about them and talking about the next time I bake them.  I halved the recipe and added M & M's, toffee bits, and butterscotch chips.  Used chunky peanut butter and that gave them great texture as well.  Thought they'd flatten more, so I pressed them down before baking.  Great cookie compromise for hubby and I - he likes chewy and I like crunchy.  Great cookie!

I am sorry I did not like this recipe at all, it basically was one entire cookie filling the whole cookie sheet. There is no flour in the recipe maybe that is why.
They are tasty but not what I consider a cookie.

Cut the recipe in half and still got a ton of cookies.  Good thing we like them so much.  This is a great cookie to make when you are out of flour. Having a mixer is handy in this recipe because the dough is very thick and all of the oats are not easily mixed in.

This makes a ton of cookies, so be prepared to bake.  Everyone who tried these cookie loved them.  The peanut butter flavor wasn't overwhelming, just right.  I did use mini chocolate chips and M&M's, and those worked well for me.

these were very chewy and tasty, I halved the recipe like others suggested and still ended up with about 40 large cookies. I give this recipe 4 starts because the cookies spread quite a bit while they were in the oven and I've never had that problem before with any other oatmeal cookie recipe. Not my personal favorite cookie recipe but they were a big hit with everyone who ate them :)

A little sweet too sweet for my liking, but overall good texture and taste!  I would cut the brown and white sugar each by 1/4 cup if I were to make this again.

I thought these cookies were just "OK". I had a hard time figuring out if they were done or not. If you just drop the cookies onto the sheet using a spoon, the cookies break apart easily. So, I rolled them into litle balls & tried again. They stayed together a little better. 
I baked them for about 12 minutes...at 8-10 minutes, they still looked 'raw' in the middle.
I thought they were just "OK" but I did get some compliments on them.

This has been my go-to cookie recipe for years! Makes a ton for a large group or freeze some for later. When I'm feeling a little lazy I spread the dough on a sheet pan and make bars. We make them for my daughter's "lemonade stand" and is a crowd pleaser. Watch the time as to not over bake.

THESE ARE AMAZING! Everyone loved them so much! I used half the amount of chocolate chips and filled the remainder with butterscotch chips. First made them for a game night (I bake cookies for them every week) and then made them the following weekend for my nephew's Eagle Scout ceremony. They practically flew off the plate (:

I've made these many times.  I triipled the size of the recipe and freeze rolls of dough so I can take out a roll and back when I need some fresh cookies.

I have made this twice so far and plan on making it again. The first time I made it I "fudged" the instructions a little and the cookies came out good, but not amazing. The second time I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and they came out awesome! Definitely recommend. As others have mentioned, the amount in the recipe makes a LOT of cookies, so feel free to halve it or freeze.

Was a bit skeptical because there was not flour listed in the ingredients list. However, these turned out very good. 
Made 1/3 of the listed amount which yield a nice batch.

Tips First:  -Cook for 11 minutes (they look quite un-done, but they are)  -Also, make balls and let them settle in the oven, they are less crispy this way.  -Extra MMs are perfect.  -Use a FLAT metal spatula to remove from pan, and let them sit on the pan for 2-4 minutes first so they dont fall apart.

Yes it makes a lot, but you peobably want this many since I have about 10 people asking me to make them a batch!

I brought to a superbowl party and not one person who ate them did not RAVE how great they were!  I made medium size and large sized cookies.  They were chewy and perfect.  REALLY watch the timing, 1 minute to much will give you crispier than wanted cookies.

Delicious and always a hit. Best with m&m's and chocolate chips, but can use any flavor of chips or nuts. I add a pinch of cinnamon and will halve or third the recipe.

Just made these delicuous cookies and they were wonderful!! The only changes I made was that I used 4 c. old fashioned oats and 5 c. quick oats AND I added a BAG of holiday M & M's!! I'm wondering if the author of this recipe actually meant to put the  m&ms in since they were in the photo? Also, I made small ones and baked only 10 minutes and they were perfect!

I've been making a recipe like this for years.  I've actually doubled this and used red & green M&Ms and turned these into Christmas cookies.  Make sure you have a large pan to mix the ingredients, and you may need to use your hands!

Delicious. The recipe says teaspoon sized cookies and 42 servings. I used a 1/2 Tablespoon scoop and have over 11 dozen cookies. The taste and texture of these little guys makes me swoon.

Once I got the PB, butter and sugars into my mixing bowl, there was NO WAY I could fit NINE CUPS of rolled oats in it.  And I then had to add about 3.5 cups of flour to it as my first batch of cookies ended up completely flat.

This cookie is NOT to be eaten fresh out of the oven. If I had rated the recipe the first day it may have received 3 stars. After all of the hype I was expecting a phenomenal cookie. I am a (home) baker and I specialize in cookie - I am always making up my own recipes. This one was not a winner in my book. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because on sitting for a day the flavor improved. Not sure what would improve them without just making it a completely different cookie. A little flour to give better body/substance? Or maybe using quick oats instead of rolled oats?

Amazing! First time I've tried monster cookies, and they are phenomenal.  I halved the recipe, used M&M's instead of chips, and used Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Oats which are gluten-free. A repeat for sure.

These cookies are not good. They are too flat & crispy--I tried adding flour to no avail.

These cookies are wonderful.  I love the peanut butter and oatmeal together.  I have made them a number of times with one change--I add about 3/4 cup of flour to the batter.  It makes it a lot easier to handle. They are also good with M&Ms instead of chocolate chips.

Good cookies.  I halved the recipe and shudder to think how many the full batch would make!

These cookies are the best! They have a nice, peanut-buttery, chewy texture, and the chocolate really adds flavor. I used 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup M&Ms.

great cookies! Can understand why they are called "monster", couldn't make them small and include all the chocolate chips.

These were very good.  I added 1/2 tbsp corn syrup, 1/2 c chopped nuts, some white chocolate chips and m&m's too.

Not quite like grandma used to make but still very good. My 18 month old liked them much better than my three year old.
