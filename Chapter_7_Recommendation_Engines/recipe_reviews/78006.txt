This was a super easy and delicious recipe.  I nixed the nuts and pineapple to lower calories - and used soy milk instead of half and half.  The result was delicious and super moist little muffins with a great flavor.  They were still really moist the next morning, too.  I will be making this again - in lots of forms, I can already imagine little chocolate ones, or maple flavored...yum!

Used sugar instead of splenda, all-purpose flour only, didn't have pumpkin pie spice so subbed with cloves & nutmeg, and left out the pineapple.   These were a hit & very moist!

These were perfect for a little breakfast.  As you can see by the picture, I had to take it with only 2 of those little babies left!!  Hubby enjoyed them as much as I did.  I didn't have any pineapple so I used 1 cup of cranberries.  Quite tasty for being healthy for you!!

I made this into a cake and baked for 50 minutes in a 8 inch cake pan.  I used 1% milk instead of the half-and -half. I used almond extract and vanilla and used around 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries instead of the dried fruit. Turned out really good!

I thought these were good. They reminded me of a fusion of a super moist bran muffin, a regular spice cake, and even a fruit cake. I used all of the ingredients except I subbed regular sugar for the Splenda, because it was what I had. I also left out the pineapple, like another reviewer, and just used 1 1.5 oz box of the cranberries. They were so extra moist, that even after 20 minutes of baking, a quarter of them wanted to stick and break in half. I think this would be best made into a cake, cooked well, with some kind of cream cheese or similar type frosting. The flavor is good and with a little work, could make a nice presentation too.

I have made these twice in three days, my husband and I ate all of the first batch and now we are starting on the second.  I used regular sugar instead of Splenda, they are so soft and moist . The next trip we take these will go with us as one of our snacks. I will try to freeze them and see how it works.

D-I-V-I-N-E. I've made a million sugar-free desserts - few of them worth repeating - but this recipe is a keeper. Spongey and flavorful.  I used the brown sugar/splenda mix and took the advice here about adding almond extract and making a cake. I'd recommend these additions. Wish I'd had fresh cranberries.

I used a mix of stevia and sugar (3 parts to 5) and cut the overall amount of "sugar" down by half. It's still a little too sweet due to how sweet stevia is, so I'll probably use 1/3 cup next time. I took the suggestions  some other reviewers offered and used soy milk, used all white flour and added allspice and used cinnamon and nutmeg since I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice on hand. I don't have mini muffin pans, so I just used a regular muffin pan, and it made 12 beautiful muffins by increasing the bake time by about 10 minutes! Also, definitely grease the pans and don't use paper liners -that seriously didn't work!  I'll be making these again tomorrow, they were so good!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it's the first low fat, low carb muffin recipe that I have tried & actually liked. I know the title says tea cakes, but they are more like muffins, esp. after baking them in a mini muffin pan, as suggested. ;)
The only change I made was to use 1% milk instead of the half & half (that's what I had on hand)... also left out the pineapple to save calories (I can imagine that it's probably even better with it). I got 36 mini muffins that each came out to 35 calories, 1 gm each of fat, fiber,& protein and 6 gms carbs.
