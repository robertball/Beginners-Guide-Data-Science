I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I use Basil pesto instead of sundried tomato, and use more of it, add celery and use chicken broth instead of veggie.  And right before eating, I squeezed in some fresh lemon juice.  Oh--and i used sweet potatoes instead of regular.  I love how this is FILLED with veggies and has tons of flavor from the pesto.  I use fresh pesto from a local international foods deli.

Absolutely delicious! I Cooked it exactly as described, and it tasted really good!

Plus is really filling for the minimal amount of calories it contains, which is great because me and my dad are watching our weight.

I think i would make a couple of changes though. I would use 1 less bouillon cube, and i would also cook it for 30 minutes instead of 35.

Thanks for sharing.

Surprisingly good! We had a lot of these ingredients that we about finished, and this was an excellent way to use them up. Like others, we just used regular basil pesto. The only reason I didn't give it another star was the lack of "wow" factor. We did also make cheese drop biscuits with it, and I would highly recommend putting the biscuits in the soup! I'd never done it before, but our lunch guest recommended it. THAT was amazing!

A delightful surprise. This soup was a hit at dinner. I made it with homemade vegetable broth and sun-dried tomato pesto and feel this gave the end result a boost. We did not add any salt or flavourings.The flavours were crisp and fresh. I made it in a pressure cooker in 10 minutes. There was too much liquid so I reserved it for another soup. Quite delicious. I served this pureed and added fresh, grated zucchini on top and the whole family loved it. Thank you C. Berry for your recipe.

I made this with vegetable broth instead of water and cubes. It was bland, so I added salt, pepper, and garlic to make this somewhat tastier.

This was alright at best.  I really couldn't taste any of the tomato pesto, even after I doubled the suggested amount, what with the 6 1/2 cups water in which it was diluted.  That seemed like a LOT for just four servings... maybe cut down on the water a couple cups.  Another thing... there was way too much onion in it - good for flavor but they start to burn your tastebuds after eating so many.  Maybe a half an onion for each batch would do better.  I would give 3 1/2 since it really wasn't that bad, but that's not an option.

Used all fat free/low sodium chicken broth with this and regular homemade pesto as I don't care for sundried tomatoes. This made a great lunch for me today and I thank you C. Berry!

This was just ok. Needed a fair amount of salt and pesto (I used a basil one) to give it flavour. I also added a tin of tomatoes.

This was quite good.  It was also really quick and easy to make. I also used basil pesto as that's what I had on hand.

I made this soup using regular pesto, I added canned diced tomatoes, some wide noodles, and used sweet potatoes in place of regular potatoes.  I did double up on the pesto.  My daughter who is vegan loved it more then panaria bread veg pesto soup!  I think the sweet potatoes really made tasty.

Love this soup.  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used chicken broth and pesto sauce.  Yummo.  The recipe is very versatile as ingredients can be substitued or added.  I have added turkey kielbasa, chopped kale, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, and butter beans.  It is the broth with the pesto sauce that makes the soup - just clean out the vegetable bin and enjoy a variation!
