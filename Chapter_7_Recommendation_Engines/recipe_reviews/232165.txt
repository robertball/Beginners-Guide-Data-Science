This was a really good tettrazini! Very creamy! I added a couple stalks of diced celery and used leftover turkey. I really like the addition of steak sauce to this, it gives a hint of extra flavor. The family enjoyed this and it does make a lot- I was able to make three dishes and put two in the freezer.

This is a very easy and yummy chicken tetrazzini recipe that can be changed up in many ways.  You could add celery, broccoli, peppers or even chunks of tomatoes to give it some more oomph.  This recipe fills a 9x13 baking dish to the brim and easily fed my family of 4 with enough leftovers for dinner tomorrow.

I used whatever pasta noodles we had on hand, and it was delicious!  I worried that my picky husband wouldn't touch it, but he went back for seconds.

This was a very easy and tasty meal. I made a few changes. I added 1/2 lb of mushrooms, doubled the steak sauce and added 1 package of frozen broccoli. I only use 8 oz of cheese in the mix and topped with bread crumbs. It was excellent.
