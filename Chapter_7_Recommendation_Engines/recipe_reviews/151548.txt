I give this 5 stars on the condition of using a can of Italian diced tomatoes instead of the soup.  Every thing else was the same except I used lots of fresh minced garlic. We loved it with these changes-wish I could used fresh tomatoes!

I found a big zucchini in the garden and needed a healthy side dish for dinner. This recipe was the ticket. I didn't use the tomato soup. Instead I used a can of chopped Italian tomatoes. I sauteed the onion and 3 garlic minced cloves and zucchini pieces before adding in the tomatoes. I thought this was very good and healthy stewed dish.

Yum yum yum! This is a great alternative to my standard 'don't know what to do with the zucchini so just saute it with onion' recipe. Perfect flavor, excellent blend of veggies! Only change i made was to add some sliced mushrooms.

I loved this recipe. I too made some changes, I used a lot of fresh garlic and a dash of celery salt. I used ramano cheese as well and a ton of the two chesses. We had it as a soup type dish, and the cheeses helped thicken it up. I also tried with diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup, and didn't like it as much, not enough flavor defussion. Side note: If you have a gaint zucchini like mike garden likes to produce, cube it without the seeds for a thicker dish, or with the seeds for the more soupie varity.

Nice side dish, flavorful.  Took one reviewers advice and used diced tomatoes.  3 of us ate it all (shows how good it was!)

Wonderful!  I'm not a big fan of green pepper so I substituted with sliced mushrooms instead.  It was fantastic!

I thru away my other zucchini recipe and now I make only this one. Great flavor (which is great because zucchini doesn't have any flavor) Added a bit of my own seasonings with the ones listed. Perfect!

This definitely has potential. I used a can of Tomato Soup and it was too salty and it tasted way too much like the soup. I'm definitely going to try this again with fresh tomatos, and I think it will be great!

I'm giving it a four star, because my husband thought it was "alright," I liked it thou. So I might be able to sneak it every once in awhile.

Simple and tasty. Different than most veggie sides.  I like new and different ideas. Looks good when finished.  Best if eaten the same day.

This is great! I had some tomato bisque with spinach left over so i used it instead of the plain tomato soup. Other than that minor change I used the recipe to a T. My husband loved it!!!!
