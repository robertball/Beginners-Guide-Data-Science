It is important to use ripe Plums! Otherwise it will taste sour, most People dont know how good Plums can taste because they are eating sour unripe Plums. Also for added sweetness its typical to make sugar crumbes to put on top.

This is a terrific dessert!  I remember having this type of pastry when I lived in Germany.  I will definitely make this.  This pastry is like comfort food.

Actually I have a question but can't find a place to ask. This is an awesome recipe and love love love it. But I was wondering what to leave out or increase to make the dough not rise quite as much? My mothers was not as fluffy and would like to make it more that way. Thanks in advance for any help.

Divine. Had enough pastry and plums to make two pies - one as shown but in larger tin and one lattice topped in 9" pie dish. This is a fantastic pastry - I was worried the bottom would be soggy - it was anything but! Froze the lattice top pie and reheated before serving - still tasted as good as the one we ate fresh. Highly reccommended.

Couldn't find plums - used mixed berries instead.
