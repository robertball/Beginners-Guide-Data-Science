SO VERY yummy.  The toffee layer was far to thin for the amount of Almonds that the recipies called for.  After I poured the frist layer of almond toffee, I made another batch of just the toffee without the almonds, and it turned out GREAT.  Make sure that you wait until the toffee turns to a dark brown to get that good toffee flavor.  I used high end chocolate and used the white chocolate on the dark and made pretty swirls.  Note sure why but large areas of the chocolate broke away from the toffe when I was breaking it.  I had some just toffee pieces, some just chocolate and aout 1/2 that was both.

This recipe turns out MUCH better if you substitute the Sugar for Light Golden Sugar, and the Salt for Baking Soda - I've been making this for a WHILE.  Using a Candy thermometer (they are an inexpensive Investment that will save MUCH Grief and scorched goodies) You want to take this to 285 degrees F, (Soft Crack Stage)   Then when you remove the mixture from the heat, add in your Vanilla and Baking Soda before pouring it onto the baking sheet. This will make your toffee crispy and light - A HUGE difference.

This is so good.  Make sure you boil it for 10 minutes or more til golden.  Also, just sprinkle chocolate chips over, they will melt, then spread.  I made this for Mother's Day gifts.

this stuff is soooo good, i used 2 cups of slivered almonds which i roasted before hand in my convection oven at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes, i used organic sugar and my very best madagascar vanilla, and i bought some awesome chocolate at my favorite kitchen store.  I did not use all the chocolate, probably enough left to do another batch tomorrow.  Tonights batch was for a gift for a very special friend.  Next time I will probably use regular sugar and a cheaper chocolate.  I used to make a similar recipe and just put chocolate pieces on the hot toffee and spread them around after they melted, i usually used chocolate chips or hershey bars.  However the bittersweet and semisweet combo is really amazing. Also did not use a thermometer, boiled for 12 minutes exactly on med heat. Perfect, Elegant, Yummy, Great gift!

You cook the nuts before you make this and then change the temp, of the oven for the toffee. You can change the oven temp.This is delicious!

I made this for the orthodontist office staff and they all loved it.  It was very easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband asked me to save some for home.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly.  I think I used a little more nuts than written because my candy  mixture was very thick the first time I made it.  I've made with or without nuts as well and with or without chocolate.  Very easy and pretty much foolproof as long as you time the boiling. Great recipe!

I was also confused by the preheating instructions when the recipe never tells you to bake.   The original recipe instructs you to roast the almonds for 8 minutes at 400 degrees.

Totally off the measurement almost all the ingredients such as the almonds, chocolates and the toffee mixture. It didnt even taste like it but more of a brittle. I got another recipe from another website and turned out great! For me, just a waste of money and time...

Excellent flavor but can anyone tell me why the chocolate separates from the toffee when I break it apart?  Too thick, perhaps?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

So good! I followed someone's advice and used light brown sugar and baking soda instead of sugar and salt. It turned out perfectly! Also, I went out and bought a candy thermometer--so glad I did! I wouldn't have thought it would take that long to get to the right boil. I'll be making this again and again! 

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars since I altered it and didn't really make it as is.

I made this last year and every one liked it. This year I told a friend to get ready for the Halloween and Holiday parties I throw and she was adamant that I make it again. !

It is VERY important to bring this up to 285 degrees, as stated in another review.  I used a pan that was too small and when it started to bubble up, I took it off the heat at 255 degrees.  The toffee part had the consistency of cookie dough, very messy!  The chocolate part, however, was so good that I scraped the toffee off and kept the hardened chocolate.

the amount of chocolate was overpowering the delicious toffee. i would recomment using 2/3 the recommended amount and starting with a drizzle, see where that takes you. GREAT flavor on the toffee though!

Love it! Cooked for 11 min on medium, but next time I will let it get darker... I didn't put almonds on top like the recipe says because I used pink sprinkles to make it festive for Valentine's day, but next time I will put almonds on top for sure, I think it would taste better with them.

Tasty but a previous reviewer is right.  Too many nuts for the toffee.  I used 2 cups and I still found it to be too much...Double the toffee recipe and it might be just right.

This is delicious and so easy. It took almost twenty minutes for my toffee to get where I wanted it though.
