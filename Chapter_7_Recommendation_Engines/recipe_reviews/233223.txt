I should have read this recipe thoroughly before beginning.  Says it makes 12 muffins but uses 3 1/2 C flour.  Good thing I was prepared for 24.  Also.. they are virtually tasteless.  A little more sugar and some cinnamon might help.   Not sure I'll bother making them again.

I made this but I made some changes based on others reviews. I added an extra egg, instead of one cup white sugar I used half light Brown sugar and half white sugar. I also added one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and two teaspoons of cinnamon, as well as substituted vegetable oil with butter flavored shortening plus one tablespoon of vegetable oil. After making the batter I put it in the refrigerator and let it cool for an hour. Baking only took approximately 15 minutes. My end result was light and fluffy, and delicious. The only thing I wish was different was the fruit settled to the bottom of the muffin instead of throughout

I have been making muffins for years. At work I am known as the muffin lady. But I wish I could say this is the best muffin recipe I have ever tried. Makes a lot more than 12 muffins. Not very tasty and rather heavy. I don't think I will make these again. I made two batches with the same results--foolish me.

I made them in the BIG muffin pan, and I did add a little cinnamon to them but all in all they were great. Love the fresh strawberries and blueberries in them.We will make them again.

After reading everyone else's comments and suggestions, I made the following changes to this recipe:
I used only 3 cups of flour, I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Everything else I used the original recipe amounts.
I ended up with 20 regular sized muffins. They were light and fluffy with very good flavor.

I made it, and the muffins were pretty tasty!  Trying to make them sweeter.  Maybe a little more sugar?  The batter was so thick, after the first batch, the rest of the batter was put in the refrigerator, uncovered.  I will try to salvage what I can.

These muffins turned out delicious in spite of me forgetting to add the jam. The batter was thick though and made more than a dozen. I think I wound up with 14 or 15? Anyway I filled the muffin cups 3/4 and they didn't expand much so don't skimp on the batter thinking they are going to double in size...they don't.

This is a very plain muffin mix where the fruit is definitely the star. If you have tasteless fruit you'll have tasteless muffins. Makes at least 18 average sized muffins so be prepared.

good recipe and muffins are great but I needed to add about 1/4 cup of milk more and an extra tbsp of jam in order to get the muffin batter at the right consistency. It was too thick before I did that.

I made only half of the recipe and managed 9 decent sized muffins. I used frozen blueberries and strawberries that I had defrosted slightly. I found them to be tasty and light. I probably used less sugar than suggested but I liked the addition of jam. Will make again!

I made it exactly the way it said. I would definitely add something extra for more flavor next time but love the fresh berries.

Loved this recipe.  I altered it and used less sugar and lots more jam.  And a tin of crushed pineapple instead of the strawberries and blueberries.  Very moist and tasty without being too sweet
