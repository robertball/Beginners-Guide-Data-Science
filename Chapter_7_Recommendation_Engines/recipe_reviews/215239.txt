This is so easy and so good! I rinse the beans to try and reduce the sodium.  I couldn't find the Goya seasoning, so I bought a different Spanish style seasoning and it tasted great! I highly recommend this and it's great for parties when you need to bring a dish.

very easy and quite tasty.  I like a little more crunch so I added celery and a bit of red onion.

A very nice dish. I couldn't find the Goya Salad packet, so I used a "hot" salsa packet I found in the produce area. It was really good. I was surprised at first how thick the dressing was, but the taste was really good. Lots of nice textures and a good flavor throughout. I will make this again. Very easy recipe.

Good, easy recipe. A good way to eat your black-eyes if you don't particularly love them! I could not find the seasoning listed, but did use the Goya Cilantro & Tomato seasoning packets. The only thing I added was a little Mrs. Dash Table Blend at the table. Next time I will add a little of that or just salt and pepper to the dressing mix.

I didn't like this one very much.  Took it to a potluck at work and apparently many others didn't like it either.

Very delicious. Made this for a bridal shower and all the ladies loved it. I couldn't find the Salad and Vegetable seasoning so I used the Goya Saz√≥n with Coriander and Annatto. It was very good. Also I couldn't find blackeyed peas, so I used black beans. Added minced red onion.

We really enjoyed this salad and it was so easy to make!  I wasn't able to find the Goya Salad & Vegetable seasoning, so I substituted the Cilantro & Tomato seasoning packets instead.  Even with the slight change it was delicious!

Pretty good and most of the guests seemed to like it.  My only change was to add a diced red onion which I think was a good addition.   However, there is way too much oil in the recipe.  I had to drain the salad before serving.  Next time, I might try to season the salad myself.  The ingredients in Goya Salad & Vegetable Seasoning, in order, are: salt, MSG, dehydrated garlic, tricalcium phosphate (anticaking agent), pepper, turmeric (color).

This was good but a little bland.  I may up it to three seasoning packets next time.  I found the Goya seasoning in my grocery store in the international aisle near the beans, coconut water, etc .

I couldn't find the Goya Salad & Vegetable Seasoning, so I subbed a packet of Italian dressing mix instead. I also added a little extra Italian dressing once it sat for a while. It was a refreshing recipe. It would be fun to try mixing and matching other kinds of beans in as well.

Didn't have packaged spices, so substituted 1 /4 of  the olive oil with Newman's Caesar's Salad Dressing. Pinto beans instead of chick peas. Added 1/2 cup chopped green onions. Interesting combination of tastes and textures. Don't forget Cilantro.
