After reading other reviews that stated this soup seemed bland I made a few changes.  First, I didn't saute the onions and I don't think it really made any difference. I used a meaty ham bone instead of smoked ham hocks because I had one left over from a Christmas party.  I cooked it in 4 cups water and 2 cups vegetable broth for a little extra flavor.  Also, I drained the sauerkraut but did NOT rinse it.  Rinsing sauerkraut washes most of the flavor away, which is probably the main reason most people thought this soup bland.  I never rinse it (but that might be because I'm Polish, and we like our kraut more sour I guess).  I also added 5 or 6 sliced mushrooms and 1/3c quick-cooking pearl barley when I added the sauerkraut to make it more hearty. I did not use any bacon because the soup is already a little greasy from the ham.  Instead I thickened it with about 2-3 T cornstarch.  I didn't want it too thick.  Finally, I made sure to temper the sourcream before adding.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but they were all more like little tweaks, and made for a wonderfully delicious and flavorful soup.  I highly recommend it.

I couldn't believe it when I saw this recipe!  I grew up on the stuff and have been craving it since the temperatures have dropped. The only difference was the addition of sour cream.  For the rater who had her sour cream curdle... you did not temper it.  Always add a small amount of the hot liquid to the sour cream, mix well, add a little more of the hot liquid, mix well, THEN add it to the rest of the hot liquid.  This stuff is even better the second day!

One word -- biohazard.  This soup lacked in body, flavor, and balance all of which are essential to the success of a soup.

Very good!  Even my husband and 8 yr old son loved it....and didn't complain about left-overs the next night!  Very important to temper the sour cream.....a bit of a hassle, but a definite must!

We served this to start a German themed meal.  Everyone loved it!  It was fairly easy to make, although time consuming, much more than the 15 minutes prep time in the recipe to chop onions, cook bacon and prep other ingredients.  The most difficult task was removing the meat from the ham hocks.

The soup was a little too watery and even with the sour cream, lacked something.  It does have a German taste but not a hearty soup.

I so wanted to give a good review, but it's still sitting in my refridgerator.  I can't bring myself to taste it!  The sour cream curdled, and it looks awful!

Not a wow but still very good. I had to make some changes due to allergies. I didn't use onions and had to sub beef sausage for the ham. I also used chicken broth for some of the water. Because I didn't have the ham I didn't cook for the extended time so I used less added liquid. Thank you

I read all of the reviews beforehand and decided to make some changes. I prefer a hearty chunky soup and added some chopped potatoes which was a nice addition. I was unable to find ham hock in the grocery stores in my area so I just used chopped ham and vegetable broth in place of the water. Not sure if it was due to using the broth or what but the end result was far from bland for me. The recipe does not state to do it but you really do need to temper in the sour cream. This was a really good soup and I will make again. Next time I might even add celery and carrots.

A greasier soup, but pretty tasty. I liked the sauerkraut taste.

This soup was great.  It is typical of German cuisine.  My family loved it.  It is great for a low-carb diet.

I have made this recipe many times over the years. I made it exactly as-is the first couple of times, and it was awesome! The first time, it was for a German-themed church supper, and everyone loved it. It was the first dish gone. It also taught me how to temper sour cream, which is a great thing to know.

Now, I tend to tweak it according to mood or tastes. Tonight, I am roasting the ham hocks first. Then, I'll strip off the meat, make gravy out of the drippings to add to the soup later, and then boil the bones for the broth. I am also roasting potatoes and onions to add after it cooks for a while. It's a great cold weather meal with fresh bread.

I'll definitely make this again. I found the recipe when searching for recipes for sauerkraut - the item I had in the pantry. When I saw it called for a can of pinto beans too, it was perfect since I had one can of those too. I used pork broth I had in the freezer so the broth didn't follow the recipe. I also added one can of Rotel. 7 of the 8 around the table loved it... The 8th rarely likes any soup so I wasn't surprised...  I have dibs on the leftovers!
