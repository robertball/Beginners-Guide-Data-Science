12.30.19  Just a few comments on a recipe which we liked.  After frying the bacon, there was an awful lot of grease in the skillet, so I did pour some off.  After sautéing the shrimp in the remaining bacon grease, PLEASE remove the shrimp from the skillet and then cook your veggies, otherwise, they’ll be TOTALLY overcooked.  Finally, for sake of presentation, do NOT mix everything together at the end, simply spoon on the shrimp, bacon, and veggies to the grits, and serve.  Shrimp and grits has lovely presentation, and you’ll really screw it up by mixing everything together.  Deducting a star for the above comments, but you can feel comfortable that this recipe will turn out well.  It tastes good, we enjoyed it!
