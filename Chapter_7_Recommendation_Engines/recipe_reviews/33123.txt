Absolutly delicious.  It was so simple to prepare.  I would make it again, but beat the eggs together in a bowl and then pour it over the dish, instead of cracking the eggs on top. I also added a little taco seasoning to make it a bit more flavourful.

Very tasty!  I just kept everything in the frying pan when I added the eggs, and put the lid on the pan instead of transferring to the oven.  It worked great, and there was one less dish to wash!

Thought this was really good and hearty.  I used less oil and skipped the butter at the end all-together.  Also, added some chili powder, used black and pinto beans, and subbed spinach for the parsley at the end.  Have also added chopped up ham steak too.  Clearly, very easy to modify.  Good and good for ya'!

Thought this was very good.  I added cayenne pepper.  I used great northern beans instead of lima beans.  I served it for Easter because I was looking for something not at all sweet to balance the Easter Morning candy buzz.

This is good, and so healthy!  I added green onions to the veggie mix and sprinkled some cheddar just before adding the eggs (made the top get nice and crispy), so therefore skipped the butter.  Also, I took the advice of one person and mixed the eggs together before pouring.  I'll make it again but with black beans, which I think would be tastier.  Oh, I also added cayenne pepper for a little extra kick, and I think it might be bland without it.  The dish did come out just a bit dry, maybe I cooked it a little too long- so I ate it with ketchup. Good stuff, thank you Bounty!

Really very easy and tasty!  Wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have any cumin on hand so I substituted taco seasoning mix.  It turned out to be incredible! Plus, it helps if you caramelize the onions - really adds a nice depth and sweetness to the dish.

Yum! Great vegetarian dish...just so you know though, vegetarians DO eat eggs, but vegans don't.

Really unique and good recipe.  I added a couple teaspoons of chili powder to it, and sauteed the veggies for a bit less time than called for.  Even the meat-loving husband liked it!

Good Good Good! And so versatile, i can make it with any fresh ingredients in my fridge!
I like using half lima beans and half pinto beans, -These two give a great color & texture mix.
You can also try using mushrooms, spinach, and tarragon, instead of green peppers & parsley.
I recommend caramelizing the onions, with some of the cumin & chopped garlic. & you can beat the eggs, if you want the consistency more even.

Very good and hearty dish!!  I followed others tips and here's what I did. I doubled the recipe . Used just 1/4 cup of oil, one can of pinto beans and 12oz package of frozen lima beans, added one package of chili seasoning, doubled everything else except the eggs and omitted the butter altogether.  I scrambled 4 eggs and poured over the dish. spread cheddar cheese across the top and baked for approx. 30 min.  The eggs and cheese made a nice topping. Will definitely make again!!

I thought this was pretty good. My boyfriend thought it was just okay. I attempted to give some leftovers to a family member and they wouldn't touch it. I'd make it again, but maybe just for myself.

I made this recipe with items that I had on hand so I had to alter it a decent amount but it turned out to be amazing.
Instead of the bell peppers, I used mushrooms and instead of the lima beans, I used lentils. Instead of parsley, I used green onions .
I am not one to overcook veggies so I didn't necessarily time how long I sauteed everything. I did not do the onions for the extra five minutes at the beginning and simply added the tomatoes and garlic right away. (I also used 2.5 roma tomatoes because that's what I had.) Mushrooms cook very quickly so I added those towards the end of the sauteing process. I threw in some cumin, seasoned salt, and pepper, a little "Slap yo Mama" seasoning, and a dash of chili powder. 
I added the lentils towards the end as well as the green onions and then moved it to my baking dish. I added the eggs which I had whisked in a bowl prior to, a dash of butter, then baked for about 15 minutes. I was worried how it would turn out but the lentils are what made this dish. They have the best flavor and are very good for you. I am so glad I did not use lima beans. Awesome recipe!

We switched out lima beans with black beans, and I added 6 eggs instead of just 4, but the family loved this one.  A great healthy breakfast option, it is a keeper.

I used egg whites instead of whole eggs.  I took it to a work brunch to honor our boss and it was a big hit.  I will make it again.

VERY GOOD FAIRLY EASY We really enjoyed this. I will make many times again and also for company. I did make to many changes to give a five right off though. A great basic start.
I used my frying pan  in oven instead of casserole, less dishes. Cooking time for all steps can be shortened.
For company I will make vegetables ahead of time put in my single serving dishes and just drop eggs on at cooking time.I used chick peas but others would be good. For us skip cumin maybe a few red pepper flakes. Top with a few bacon pieces. I served salsa on side for topping. BarBQ some small sausage and tomato and cucumber plate. Fruit bread anything else. Just a great breakfast, Sunday lunch, even a easy dinner.
Iloveit
