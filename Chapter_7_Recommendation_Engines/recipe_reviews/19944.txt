I recommend mixing the seasonings with some olive oil to ensure a crispy tasty skin with a nice color (SEE MY PHOTO). I used seasoning salt (about 2 tsp) instead of poultry seasoning.

I am so happy that I was able to erase what I just wrote. By mistake I thought this recipe was another similar one who did not say to spread the coals out. Very important to not grill under direct heat. Could cause fire... like in the other recipe. Thank you for saying indirect heat.

I have only made this in the oven at 350 degrees for 2 hours, but it is well worth the wait!  My family and friends request what we have renamed "Beer-butt Chicken"!  I even found a neat can holder/cooking stand at Walmart for $3.95.  It's a great tool!

Great recipe, however, if you plan to cook the chicken for 2hrs on a grill, I would recommend indirect heat.(I used a 4 burner propane grill)  If not, cut the cook time down to 1 1/2hrs.  For a different taste, consider adding THIN lemon slices under the skin.  Remember, "to each thier own".  Still, all and all, a great recipe to start and tweak to your taste.

Easy, great tasting recipe. I prefer a 4/4 rub with equal parts salt, pepper, paprika, and brown sugar. And yes, indirect cooking only!

This was good, but I like the Beer Butt Chicken on this site better. This had a bit too much poultry seasoning for us and the bay leaf was a little weird. We like to rub the bird with seasonings and melted butter. We have the stands that we bought at Wal Mart that are inexpensive and work like a charm! Thanks.

Chicken was good.  I'm not sure that I like the bay flavor on the chicken.  Seemed a bit strong to me.  The skin was delicious and crunchy.  Oh yeah, I did this on a gas grill.  Left one burner off, and the other one was set to medium-low for two hours.

I really wasn't expecting a lot but this chicken was very moist & tender, fantastic!  I didn't have skewers so I just sat it on a foil lined baking pan and it was fine.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This made a Great 4th of July meal! I cooked it in the oven at 350 for around 2 hours. Yummy! The only thing I would change, would be less poultry seasoning. I only used 3 TBS & it had a great herb flavor. I served this with crock pot dill potatoes. I will make this again!

I used a can of Molson M and reserved the extra beer for making a gravy. I opted to rub the chicken with a paste made from my modified version of "Memphis Rub" from AR, EVOO and a little liquid smoke. I put a little more liquid smoke and one bay leave into the can. I baked this in the oven at 350F for roughly 1h30mins. I added water in the pan as necessary so the drippings wouldn't burn. Halfway through the cooking time I added 2 cups of water, the extra beer, sachet of onion soup mix, a little of the seasoning and cornstarch. Mixed it all up, then added diced potatoes and let it cook for the remainder of the time, stirring once. Chicken was moist and perfectly cooked, the skin wasn't really crispy though (I did baste twice). The potatoes were cooked to perfection and the sauce nicely seasoned with the perfect consistency. Something I'll make again!

We like to place our chicken in a cast iron pan so we can make up some roast potatoes while the chicken is cooking.  Along with the beer we will use onion soup mix and chicken stock.   Total cook time seems to be BBQ dependent.  For us we baste a few times and after about an hour and a half we place the chicken directly on the grill for several minutes to finish browning the bottom of the bird.

Very good! I love beer can chicken, but I usually use my own blend of spices and some other ingredients. Followed the ingredients for this recipe, but I used a gas grill and a roasting apparatus to make it a bit easier. This was very tasty. I did baste a couple times with olive oil. Thanks! :)

Can do the same thing with a small turkey breast. I sprayed the bird with butter flavored spray,put on the seasoning and sprayed it again. It kept the bird nice and moist and penetrated the seasoning. Also put the bird and the beer can on a heavy aluminum pie plate over an indirect propane grill. The pie pan keeps the can and bird stable and you can use the juices for basting for a bit more flavor. The pan helps in transferring the bird when done

We just bought a holder a few weeks ago, This chicken is sooo good. I put celery and onions and garlic in both cavities. Our first drunken chicken was a treat to say the least. The outside was nice and crispy and the inside was so tender and juicy. Everyone's hints where great. Thank you Max for the thumps up in this one. Jazz

Very good recipe!!  The chicken had a wonderful, crispy skin (the best part!) and was very moist on the inside.  I kept a beer in hand and basted occasionally:)

This was the best charcoal-grilled chicken I have ever prepared. I skipped the bay leaf. My 4.5 lb. bird was done in a little over an hour. The chicken was very moist, tender and delicious.

The recipe in itself is very good but you should be careful with the can of beer.  Make sure that the paint on the can doesn't peel because it does sometimes.  I have bought a pan for this exact purpose with a place to put the beer or whatever liquid you want to use.

We don't care for that much bay leaf; instead we put about a tablespoon of rosemary in the beer can and it is AWESOME!  We have three cats & a dog who won't leave us alone until they get a serving too! Great with a gren salad and grilled potatoes!

The people in Louisiana have been cooking "drunk" chickens for years. No matter what seasoning you decide to put on it, it will always taste great. Yummmmmm!

Great recipe! I also used olive oil, and used cajun seasoning instead of the poultry seasoning. Sprinke a table spoon of it in the bear can. So good!

Ohhh yeah, this is the good stuff right here. The first time I had beer can chicken, I couldn't believe how tender and moist it was. It's just phenomenal. I opted to use Memphis Rub from this site for the outside, but still used the liquid smoke in the can. Thank you for the explicit instructions to cook over indirect heat - I think that is a key step! I have a little stand for my beer can, and I sit the whole rig down inside a disposable pan to cook it. The drippings make wicked good gravy, if you're so inclined. Thanks!

This is a recipe I have used for a long time.  I stuff lemons under the skin and cook on my gas grill.  I place the chicken on a cookie sheet,(Make sure to use a cookie sheet you don't care gets blackened)and just reuse that cookie sheet for my drunken chicken.  It's an awesome recipe and really easy an fast to prepare.

This came out super juicy and delicious. I especially like that the directions state to DRINK half the beer instead of discard it.

I love the idea of Liquid Smoke. That's great if you do not want to actually use a smoker. I made this years ago however this recipe has some great hacks. The skewer through the whole chicken and can pull tab is a great idea. It made moving the bird around easy.

I used a little different approach.i used the liver and gizzard.added them to a half can of beer.rubbed the chicken with olive oil,and then put Lemmon pepper on the outside,and rubbed the inside with olive oil and a little garlic powder.cooked on 350/375 on charcoal grill for an hour and a half,and presto.this was pretty dang good.

I recommend to mix the spices with oil (Oliven. rapeseed oil), rather than poultry spices I take pepper, salt and a little cinnamon. Thus all rub evenly. For smoke flavor, I use fir branches or spruce, which produces a good Räuchereffekt. Lg Peter

Drink the whole can of beer and fill the can with water.  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE!  I have tried this recipe with various liquids, including straight juice from hot peppers and all liquids do is add moisture.  I do like cooking chicken this way, but rubbing it with spices is more important.

We didn't love this chicken for the same reason others mentioned - the poultry seasoning was a little weird. But this recipe has to stay in my recipe box forever because the technique of skewering the beercan so it stays in when you move the chicken around is just a stroke of absolute brilliance. It's the reason for the 4 star recipe.
