I made these twice. The first time they looked really nice, and tasted a bit weird. So I made them again and used baking soda in place of baking powder because of the buttermilk and yogurt. The muffins had a darker color, but the flavor and texture was much improved.

These muffins sure sounded delicious. However, they were gummy, even after baking much longer than the time in the recipe and they were tasteless, NOT delicious.

These were the worst muffins I've ever made. They were very bland and never completely baked. I think the directions and/or ingredients must've been wrong. This is the second recipe I've gotten from this website that wasn't correct. Good thing I had a backup plan....otherwise my Dad would've been eating Poptarts and Cocoa Puffs for Father's Day...lol...luckily I made a delicious Blueberry dessert for him!! This is still my favorite site for recipes...I will just be a bit more cautious!!
Thanks!!

Sorry, Sam, but your muffins tasted horrible.  They were extremely bland not to mention taking forever in the oven. Seeing the ingredients made me think these were going to be very good since it had buttermilk and 1/2 c butter, but it lacked the right amount of sugar plus the consistancy was very thick (too much baking powder and flour?).

This is the worst muffin recipe I have ever made!  I don't know if there was a misprint, but I followed the recipe and added 1T. of baking powder--the muffins tasted awful.  They took almost 45 min. to cook and the part of the muffin where the strawberries were just wouldn't cook.  I was very disappointed--I definetely won't attempt these muffins again, the 12 I did make went directly into the trash.  Sorry Sam.

This receipe was terrible. I advise anyone to try with care. I had to throw out the whole batch. I cooked them over 30min. and they came out gummy and underdone. I don't know what was wrong,I very carefully followed the receipe. I guess I'll never try a strawberry receipe again, to costly.

This was the worst recipe I have ever tried for muffins. They were bland and took forever to bake and they were wet where the strawberry were. I would never use this recipe again.

These weren't terrible, but they weren't great.  The only time they were really good was fresh out of the oven with maple syrup drizzled on top.  once they cooled they were pretty bland and boring.  Sorry, I won't be making these again.

The recipe has got to be wrong, missing ingredients and low oven temperature.  They were ugly, pale, gummy, flavorless and ruined my family's breakfast.

This is the 1st and last time I will forget to check the reviews before trying a recipe-I normally don't bake, and this was the clincher.  They would never cook-took forever, and they were like bricks-the bottoms never really cooked-what a lovely Father's Day brunch that turned out to be-A perfect breakfast treat if you like uncooked mushy muffins   Thanks Sam

I should have known better than to bake yogurt. Thhese muffins were very gummy and not flavorful.  Don't waste your time on this one.

I thought these muffins were pretty good. Although I had to bake them longer and they still didn't brown much, they did the job.

These muffins don't brown and I don't like the way the sliced strawberries make the muffins soggy.  Even when cooked much longer than stated, they were still doughy.  I won't be making these again.  Wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE I made these.

These muffins were a little bit doughy but good.  I didn't have strawberry yogurt but substituted vanilla.  I sprinkled sugar on top for extra flavor, this also gave it a crisper texture on top.  If I make them again, I will try using extra sugar in the batter, maybe even brown sugar.  Overall, good idea, just needs a little revising.

These turned out well and were kid friendly.  I might be tempted next time to sprinkle some sugar on the tops.  Or maybe add some sort of topping.

the dough was really runny, it took waaaaay longer than it said here to bake, and this recipe is lacking AT LEAST a cup of sugar. If you usually cook you'll feel like there's sugar missing as soon as you start mixing it with the butter... but you'll prove it when they're done. no flavor whatsoever.   It might be fixable with more sugar and a bit more flour, but I don't think I'll try this recipe again, when the site has plenty more strawberry muffin recipes that work better.

The muffins turned out FANTASTIC! However, I did some changes to mine. I used whole milk in place of buttermilk simply because I had none :) I also used self rising flour. 
Yes, they will be made again! Thank you for the recipe.

I was unimpressed with this recipe. Despite going through about half a dozen paper towels to dry the strawberries (I had a bad experience with a batch of peach muffins where the peaches were too wet), the muffins turned out soggy. They would be better if they had a streusel topping or something. But they were pretty uninspiring.

Hey Sal, This recipe was fine.  I do agree that it could use more sugar, but I always sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top and that worked for me.  I substitute yogurt for sour cream every chance I get and it always bakes up just fine.  They were not doughy at all, just not sweet enough for me.  I will certainly make these again.  I always use *100% white whole wheat flour" for my baking.  This worked out well too!  
You have to wonder what people do with a recipe when most of your replies came back to "Sam"  instead of Sal.  Maybe they misread half of the ingredients too!

I had a good experience with this recipe, although I would make one or two adjustments.  I would bake for 20-25 minutes.  I used brown sugar and added a dash of real vanilla extract.  They were very moist, but I think that's because of the fresh strawberries; you might cut back to 1 cup of strawberries to keep them together.
