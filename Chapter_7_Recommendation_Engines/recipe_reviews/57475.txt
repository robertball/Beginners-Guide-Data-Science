I've made this so many times, I'm reviewing it again. It is so good, I could eat the whole pan. I change it a little...I bake the crustat 350 for about 9min and use an 11x7 pan,3/4c crushed pretzels. For the cream filling I use fat free cool whip and fat free or light cream cheese and only 1/4c sugar. For the topping I use a large can of pineapple chunks and just put then in the food processor first. No sugar needed in the topping and because of using large can instead of 8oz, I use 3T cornstarch.

Absolutely delicious!! Made this for a family get-together and it was a definite success. Really liked the pineapple better than other similar recipes that use the strawberries. I actually baked the pretzel/sugar/butter crust mixture in the pan on 350' for 10 mins. I wanted to be sure it was crunchy & not gritty. Yum! Yum!

a little too sweet, but a delicious dessert that can be used for company.  Used 16-oz crushed pineapple instead of 8 oz.

I got this recipe years ago & had lost it. Thanks Bubba! This is a fantastic recipe for taking to a cookout or potluck. I usually double the recipe & put it in a 9x13.

I've made this several times for different family gatherings. I made this for Easter and each year, I am assigned this dish. It never makes it to the leftovers table. During a family funeral, I made 1 pan and before the entire event was over, I had made 4 pans. It was the first dessert to disappear.

I thought a mistake had been made concerning the pretzel crust.  I make the strawberry version and it says to bake the crust.  Fearing the unbaked crust would be gritty, I baked it 8 min @ 400 degrees, then let cool before spreading on the cool whip/cream cheese mixture.  The dessert came out crunchy/chewy, sweet/salty... couldn't be better.

This is a simple, delicious dessert.  It satisfies the sweet/salty tastebuds in one dish.  Our family devoured the dessert.  We'll definately make this again.  It was wonderful!

I made this for a party yesterday and it was a hit...didn't even get to bring any home! I was making other goodies, and was short a baking dish, so I baked the pretzel crust on a large cookie sheet @ 350 for 10 min. I then put the layers in a trifle dish, which made a nice presentation. I agree with other reviewer's....very addicting! I look forward to making this again soon. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe at the last minute, not really sure if anyone would go for it. Everyone loved it-raved about it to all of our other guests, "Try the pineapple-it's soooo good!!" I will be making this whenever we have company!

A rare occurrence, I had all of the ingredients on hand, and whipped this up. The kids loved it, as did I. The pretzel crust made a wonderful slightly salty contrast to the sweet toppings. It was also a breeze to make; I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks, Allygator!

SO good! I took this to a Mother's Day lunch and everyone was asking about it!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked the crust at 400F for 8 minutes.  I'm so glad I did - the sugar caramelized nicely and gave the crust a nice chewy gooey texture. The other changes I made were 
1) I used less sugar in the crust (about 1//3 cup) and I used brown sugar instead of white.  
2) I used 1/3 cup sugar in the filling instead of 1/2 cup 
3)I used 2 tbsp sugar in the pineapple topping instead of 1/4 cup and 
4) I added 2 drops of orange extract to the pineapple topping which really brightened everything up and made the flavors pop!  
5) I used Honey Wheat pretzels which have a sweeter flavor. I also sprinkled leftover crushed pretzels on top which made it look nice.

I didn't even have a chance to get a picture, but I would definitely make this again!

This is an all time favorite! If you want to make a larger  amount, use a 13x9 dish and just double the pretzel, butter, and sugar amounts for the crust. I also use dream whip (follow recipe on box to prepare) instead of cool whip or whipped cream and I use 2 envelopes for a 13x9 dish. The cream cheese mixture I leave the same as recipe calls for:-) also, I don't add any sugar to the pineapple, only cornstarch and I mix the whole can with juice included until it just begins to boil. If you do it this way, be sure to let it cool completely to room temp before spreading over the topping.

This is a good dessert recipe but was too sweet for my taste and didn't 'wow' me like it did other reviewers.  I can't see me making this again.

My guests liked it, but I thought it was incredibly too buttery in taste.  Maybe I goofed something up, but I'm not sure I'll be making this again. The fruit combination with the jello and pretzels was great, it was just the bottom "crust" that become more overwhelming than enjoyable.

This would be great with Strawberry Jell-O and fresh strawberrys. Also I would add that you should mix the suger and butter together really well before pouring over pretzels.

Ever since I took this to an Easter dinner, we can't have a family gathering without this dessert!  I've tried pretzel salad with strawberries, but the pineapple gets a much better response.  I've handed out the recipe so often that I've lost count!

WARNING: The "massively addictive" note is an understatement!  I will not make this again unless there are people here to help me eat it otherwise the whole pan has my name on it. This is just way too good!

This is simply a no-bake cheesecake. The filling and topping were absolutely delicious but I was ever so disappointed in the crust. I couldn't wait to experience the salty/sweet combo but the base was crumbly and tasted awful. I will try it again but will bake the crust first before changing it to good old fashioned graham crumbs.

I have to make at least 2 large roasting pans when I take to a gathering. People can’t get enough. At a wake several years ago, the people were in a heated discussion about how some didn’t get any until I told them there was another pan in the fridge. My youngest daughter hasn’t been home in 4 year for the holiday and I asked her what one dish would she like. She told me pretzel salad.

It turned out great... BUT I did take notice of some reviews saying it was too sweet  so I reduced the amount of sugar in the crust to 1/4 cup and used 1/3 cup in the cheesecake filling.  I, too, was concerned about the crust being gritty and not holding together so I baked it for 10 minutes at 350° F. then cooled it before filling.  A couple of teaspoons of fresh lemon juice added to the reserved pineapple juice really enhanced the flavor of the topping.  Will definitely make again with these modifications.

I LOVE this dessert!  I, too, baked the pretzel crust for about 9 minutes, just to crisp it up.  I cooled it before putting the cream cheese mixture next.  I can't keep this dessert on the table very long after putting it out.  It just disappears.

This is crazy good and crazy easy to make!  I made it for a family get-together, and everyone loved it.  I made it as is, and the only thing I changed is the name.   I don't know what name COULD do this dessert justice, but all I know is, Bubba's Pretzel Salad just doesn't begin to describe it.  I'm sticking with Pineapple Pretzel Fluff for now, unless I think of something better!

This is very good.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and the only thing I might change next time is to reduce the sugar in the pretzel crust.  I was skeptical as to whether I would like this as well as the strawberry pretzel salad, but this is every bit as good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Bird!

Wonderful dessert and the flavors are fabulous. This has become a tradition for your July 4th festivities along with the strawberry version. Yummy!

This was good but why is it called a "Salad"?  I probably will do this again but I think I will try Cherry Pie filling for the topping.

"Pretzel Salad" does not do this yummy dessert justice -- it is so fantastic!  My husband doesn't like pineapple, so I left half of it plain and he and the kids ate it that way.  I think next time I'm going to try it with strawberry jam.
