5.17.19  I was hoping the stars of this quiche would  be the caramelized onions and the bacon, but what you taste more than anything is the sour cream.  Texture is a bit soft and different than any quiche I’ve ever had.  After 15 minutes of pre-baking the pie shell, the edges already were pretty browned, so I did cover them before adding the filling and then back to the oven.  For my taste, I would have preferred either swiss or gruyere instead of cheddar, but that’s simply a matter of personal preference.  To give it a bit more eye appeal, I garnished with some sliced green onion and reserved bacon.  This was pretty good, although I’m not sure I’ll make it again.  Karen, thanks for sharing your recipe.

Reduced the sour cream after reading another review.  I made 2-one with bacon and one without for my vegetarian daughter.  Added fresh spinach to hers and it was good. Also used frozen 9-in pie crusts to cut some time.

We both loved it!!  Will make it again.  Hubby added  a dash of hot sauce just to spice it up a bit.

Hi I haven’t made your quiche yet but I will because from the ingredients and a coupe of tweets it could very well be a Keto dish to enjoy.  Have to be careful with the caramelized onions.  And make the crust with almond flour. Other than that, it would be a good dinner along side salad.  Yum! ??
