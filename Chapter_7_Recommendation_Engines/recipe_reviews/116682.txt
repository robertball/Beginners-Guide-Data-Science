Made this tonight for Thanksgiving.  I used frozen pearl onions instead of fresh.  Cooked them through for about 15 minutes, then took them out of my pan and followed the rest of the recipe.  Two bags of onions got me about 3 cups so I did half the recipe.  Tasted terrific!  Hoping they reheat well!

This is DELICIOUS with roast beef or turkey!  I usually halve the recipe because it makes quite a bit.

i have a allrecipe law.  only cook recipes that are highly rated and good reviews. even then i get some bad recipes?!?!  this was the exception and what a great recipe it was.  these creamed onions reminded me of just a good old classic recipe.  i cant believe how easy it was to make and how great it tasted.  my husband was a little hesatite but was happy with the outcome.  it was a great side to my pot roast.  i 1/2 the recipe and used one yellow and one red onion.  i fried them in a little bacon grease and butter.  drained the onions then added about a T of butter to the flour, salt, pepper mixture.   great flavor great recipe thanks for sharing

Everyone was use to having pearled onions creamed. After this very simple dish they want the recipe.

All I can say is WOW. A bit rich, but I would not change a thing.I also use it as a sauce, it makes a very nice topping for baked potatoes. Thanks so much!

So.  Hmmm.  13 5 star reviews led me to make this recipe.  After having done so, all I can say is, "TWO sticks of butter?  Was that a typo?"  There's so much butter in this recipe that the sauce ends up being a gloppy mess, with half an inch of butter floating on top.  I ended up baking them in the oven a little, and even before serving them, I used a slotted spoon to transfer them out of the buttery mess into another pan, because there's no way I would have served it with that much butter floating on top.  I love butter, really.  But 2 sticks in this recipe is ridiculous.  Try one stick.  And maybe even less than that.

I had saved this recipe to make for Thanksgiving. because of so many great reviews it got.  Even while making it I was wondering about the amounts.  1 cup of butter, but only 2 tsps. flour, and equal amounts of salt??  The sauce is not very thick, and the butter floats on top.  and VERY salty.  That being said, there must be several typos in this recipe.  I would think it would be good with the right amounts.

The end result was delicious, but there's way too much fat in this recipe. A whole cup of butter! I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup olive oil. Next time I make it I'll use 1/4 cup of each. Also, I found that 2 teaspoons of flour didn't thicken it much. Even 2 tablespoons didn't make it thick enough for me. I added 1/4 cup of flour. It reheats very well.

I used pearl onions and added a touch of nutmeg... wonderful flavor but will use less butter next time.
