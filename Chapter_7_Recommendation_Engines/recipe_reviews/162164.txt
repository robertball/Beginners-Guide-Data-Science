Loved it and so did the kids. Couldn't find the onion soup so I used cream of mushroom and it was wonderful.

a great recipe to build on. I also didnt have onion soup, so I used mushroom and it came out very yummy. I fried up the spam first for some crunch and also added a couple tablespoons of dried, minced onion, garlic and lots of seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper for flavor. cant even tell that the spam is not ham or bacon!

Easy and delicious-will make again. Subbed leftover ham roast for Spam so I didn't have to shop.  Leftovers were even better!

I really like this recipe. I did not have any cream of onion soup so instead I used cream of mushroom. I diced a small onion, sauteed it, and added it. I liked the blend of flavors.  Next time I will try it with the cream of onion soup to see which way I like the best. I kept the potato skins on. I noticed the recipe didn't specify that, but turned out very tasty!

I have followed this recipe a few times now.  I really do like this potato soup dish.  I use cream of chicken instead of the cream of onion (Couldn't Find). One of my friends liked it so  much that he ate 4 heaping bowls full in one setting.

I thought the broth was creamy, rich and tasty. Other than that it is just potatoes and ham.  I think some other added veggies would have been good.

Delicious!! very cheesy.  I used cooked ham cut into strips instead of spam and it was great.  I also did not add the water back in until the very end and just a splash so it was very thick soup which is just what I was after.

I used the recipe along with a similar one and used fat free chicken broth instead of water (32 oz), half a can of reduced sodium Spam cubed, sauteed whole onion in place of soup. I used nonfat milk and 4 oz cheddar cheese. A plop of fat free sour cream too.

It was delicious and was gobbled up.

Great recipe. I substituted 1 cup whipping cream for 1 cup of milk which made it a little creamer. I also added 1/4 cup of butter and left out the meat. Delicious and super easy!
