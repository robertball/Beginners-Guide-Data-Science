These "packets" were great.  Kids enjoyed putting in the veggies they liked.  We also had mushrooms, quartered.  On a couple, we added some lemon pepper seasoning, and they were tastier.  Served with a salad with oil and vinegar dressing, outstanding!!

I found this fish very boring.  It was missing spices and tasted very bland.  Secondly, I recommend cooking it less than recommended- mine was very dry tasting.

Delicious and super-easy.  I used cod and put lemon peper seasoning on the fish, then the lemons right on top of the fish, and scattered the veggies.  Wound up "cooking" extra - timer went off, but my boyfriend wasn't home so they stayed in the oven wrapped up (oven off) for about 30 extra minutes.  still fantastic.  His cut of the cod was much thicker & meatier then mine -- so his actually came out much jucier and looked better then mine.  A bit difficult to get out of the foil in one piece.  We'll definitely make this again.

I used mahi mahi for this dish.  As written and reviewed, the recipe seemed bland.  I added white wine, capers, and butter to the foil pack for a bit more taste.  Served it with spinach for a healthy dinner.

I tried this last night and served to my very picky boyfriend. He loved it! It was an incredibly fast, simple and healthy way to prepare fish and it will be easy to build other recipes off of this.

There was not enough flavor and the foil made it too watery.

I really disliked this dish.  I don't think the vegetables compliment the fish at all.

I used tilapia for this.  Easy and tasty dinner.  I will make again but will add some lemon pepper and a little salt to the packet.  Still a keeper!

I have used this recipe using a number of different types of fish - Salmon, halibut, Tilapea and in all cases it turns out perfectly - moist, light and lemony fresh and the BEST thing?  There is absolutely no fish smell lingering in the house any where.

This was a good basic recipe for fish with the lemon flavor.
