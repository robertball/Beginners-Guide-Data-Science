This recipe is really good.  I made some slight adjustments so suit my family.  Added 1 small onion and 2 cloves of garlic (sauteed like advised by prior reviewer) also added a few shakes of crushed red pepper and topped with fresh grated romano cheese.  Very good and REALLY, REALLY easy to make!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

We're trying to do a meatless dish one night a week, and this really fit the bill (literally -super cheap to make!)  Simple to prepare, and it tasted wonderful.  Bought a 0.5lb head of escarole, and it was just right.  Like the previous reviewers, I sauteed 1t of extra garlic in 1T olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients, then a shake of red pepper flakes at the end.  My husband like his with grated parm on it, but I thought it was delicious, as is.  Creamy, hearty and satisfying.

Excellent recipe!! I wasn't sure if the brand of diced tomatoes would have enough flavor, so I did saute 1 clove of minced garlic with olive oil prior to adding the escarole.  Came out perfect! Will definitely be a keeper, thank you!

This was an easy week night recipe for a working mother/wife. I added sauted diced chicken tenders (boneless and skinless), onions and garlic to the recipe. My husband and daughter really liked this. My husband even said that this recipe is a "keeper".

Rather then buying the diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, I diced them on my own and cooked them in a little olive oil first.  I did not have cannellini beans so I used white northern beans.  I also substituted organic whole wheat rotini for the penne.

I loved this recipe, but felt it needed more flavor (which was easy enough to add on my own).  I would definitely make it again!

In addition to adding garlic and onion, I added a touch of crushed red pepper and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth which really brought all the flavors together...delicious!!!

I used regular diced canned tomatos and added garlic and italian seasonings, as well as two links of reduced fat sweet italian turkey sausage. It was fantastic and really easy.

I also sauteed 1 onion and 4 cloves of garlic in some olive oil before adding the other ingredients.  I didn't really like the crunchiness of the beans, so I sauteed everything for another 10 minutes until the Cannellini had somewhat softened.  All in all a very good and easy dish, will definitely make this again.

I have made this when I can find escarole and it is very good.  A bean and escarole dish should taste like beans and escarole.  If you don't like beans and escarole don't make this dish.

Unfortunately, we didn't like this so much.  It really didn't have much flavor - it just tasted like beans and escarole.  I shouldn't have been surprised given so few ingredients, but I did add red pepper and some parmesan cheese and it was still pretty bland, although the red pepper did help.  Usually we take leftovers to work, but we threw this out.

This is so delicious!! I did make a few changes though. I used a generous amount of olive oil and four cloves of garlic first in the pan, and sauteed for a few minutes. Then I added the escarole and let it wilt a bit, then added the tomatoes and beans with some crushed red pepper, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt & pepper. I let it all simmer about 15-20 minutes. I will definitely be making this again, maybe next time adding some sliced mushrooms too. Thanks for the recipe, this is wonderful (:

The was great!  I blanched the escarole for 1 min. first and added chicken broth and diced onions and crushed some fresh garlic, using plain canned diced tomatos.  This is a keeper!!

I subbed fresh spinach for escarole, and I rinsed and drained the beans and subbed 2 ladles of pasta water, I figured this would reduce the sodium!  The kids liked it, even brought leftovers to school for lunch!

This is a typical Italian peasant dish full of flavor and easy to make I substituted the can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic for about three good size tomatoes and about a third of a good size onion and garlic. Whoever said this was a bland dish didn't make it correctly! It is a staple in my New York Italian family.

This is a good base recipe. I also sauteed about 3 cloves of garlic in a olive oil. Added red pepper, oregano, basil and parsley. I also let it simmer for about 20 minutes to thicken the sauce and fully cook the escarole which I didn't chopped fine enough. Topped with pecorino romano cheese. Yum.

I was skeptical of this at first.  But I was looking for a meatless dinner option during Lent and tried this.  It surprised me!  Definately sautee some minced garlic in olive oil before adding the other ingredients.  I also stir in some grated parmesean cheese to the whole thing before serving.  Even better the next day (after all of the flavors have a chance to blend!)

Loved this and so did my (hard-to-please) husband. I used only a half-pound of (whole wheat) penne, and I added: one sliced onion, sauteed; two cups of baby spinach; 1/3 cup juice from pepperoncini peppers; a little sea salt and pepper; and a small bit of leftover diced ham. A sprinkle of grated romano cheese made it perfect.

I have eaten this recipe my whole life..my Mom would refer to it as a medicine..along w/poached eggs and toast or toast diced into a soft boiled egg..the two have always been very healthy-winter's coming time for such things//I have a experiment to try..I have been making my own pasta and I saved the water I used to boil a good size batch(1-lb)I re-used the very hot water to soak some Northern beans(they seemed to grow larger even before completly cooked(flour in the water)..so I really need to try boiling some beans with some flour in the water too see if they grow in size..I cook my beans over a 2-3 day period..I boil(usually Navy Beans)for a single hour and then turn off the heat and just let them sit until cool enough for the FRIDGE//where they sit until the next day--I finish them over the next day or a third day..but I need to try SOAKING--in some floured water//[end]

I tried this recipe because I was given a large head of escarole.  I'm not crazy about escarole, but I didn't want to turn down fresh food.  I've tried this recipe and one other bean and escarole recipe on this website.  Both are "okay."  I give the recipe 4 stars because I'm not going to fault the cook if I don't love escarole.  The recipe was lacking a little something and I threw in a bit of sauted onion and garlic.  But I like how the flavors come together and will probably make this recipe again if I'm given free escarole again.  However, if you're looking for a recipe that's going to make you fall in love with escarole, this isn't quite it.

This recipe is quick, easy and satisfying, all the things that I look for in a recipe. I like a little kick to my meals, so instead of salt and black pepper to taste, I added crushed red pepper.  Just the thing on a cold winter day.

I didnt like this at all. I thought that there was hardly any real flavor, the textures were weird and the escarole a bit too bitter. I will not make this again.

Quick, tasty, and cheap! 
4/15/10  This recipe has been in my regular rotation for the past year or so.   I have yet to find escarole in my local stores so I've been substituting with fresh spinach and that works out fine.  I've also been adding minced garlic, onions, cut up sausage, and using whole grain pasta and organic diced tomatoes.

This recipe is not at all as good as it looks and sounds. It has absolutely no flavor at all. I added cubed steak to add protein. Despite this, it has great potential. Here are some tips if i were to make this again: 1. escarole is a bitter vegetable, so be sure to cook it thurougly. 2. this recipe is very starchy, so drain and wrinse the beans. 3. use the juice from the tomatoes to give it a sauce 4. add fresh garlic and onions to enhance the flavor 5. add desired spices (salt, pepper, oregano, etc) and grated parmasean cheese. i didnt like the recipe, but there are definitley ways to improve it, hence the two stars in stead of one.

Very simple & delicious! My whole family really liked it (including our toddler). I added a few cloves of garlic which I sautéed first in a little olive oil, drained the beans, & used a mix of kale & spinach as couldn't find escarole.

The basic recipe is acceptable; however, it definitely needs more seasoning.  Instead of using escarole(which we don't like), I used basil and oregano.  I also used a mix of other Italian seasonings.  We topped with cheese and crushed red pepper.  With extra seasoning, this is delicious.

Such a yummy recipe!! I, like many of the others, also sautéed some garlic in olive oil. And instead of using canned tomatoes, i cut up some tomatoes, tossed them with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and then roasted them in the oven. the tomatoes had such a delicious flavor and tossed with everything else, came our great!!

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!! We loved it. I did not drain the tomatoes and it was perfect. I also added ground turkey, which made it more filling. I will definitely keep this one! It was SO easy!!! Thanks for sharing.

okay. i think i cooked the escarole wrong... i sauteed it with onion and garlic in olive oil, and it turned out a little bitter. next time will try cooking it with the beans/tomatoes like it says to. good with parmesan.

Not a big hit for the whole family but I enjoyed it. I used bowtie pasta since that's what I had on hand. It needed a little salt for my taste and was pretty good on the first day. Leftovers weren't as good but certainly fine for lunch at work.

This recipe gets 4 stars for being easy and healthy. It tasted pretty good for everyday, but not a "company" meal.   I didn't have escarole on hand, so I used frozen chopped spinach instead, added extra garlic, and we also sprinkled with parmesan cheese. I don't know if the flavor would have been better with escarole, but the spinach was good.

A great healthy meal.  I added about 6 chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces because this dish was all I served. My grocer did not have escarole, so I subbed fresh spinach.  I served this on Friday night before a trip to the movies and called it "dinner in a bowl".  The kids thought it was weird to eat beans with pasta, but they liked it.  I used whole grain pasta, and combined with the beans this is a high fiber hearty meal.  Thanks!

YUM YUM YUM! I added an extra can of tomatoes (the kind with garlic, oregano and basil) and then about half a cup of "no chicken" broth and this was delicious! I will definitely make this again and again.

This is good one healthy quick and easy to cook but there's something missing to wake up your taste buds.... next time l try to add a hotsauce or a couple tablespoons of salsa.

This dish is elegant in its simplicity.  The flavors are magical together.  Add a nice glass of wine, some fruit for dessert, and call it a meal because you really can't ask for anything better.  You will not be disappointed.

The Penne Pasta with cannellini beans and Escarole was good but I made changes in the recipe.
1.)	I sauté the Escarole with Garlic olive oil. Once when cooked I transferred it to a bowl.
2.)	I reserved ¾ cup of past water to add to the sauce 
3.)	Instead of using the canned bean juice I used the canned tomato juice.
4.)	I did combined Tomato in their juices and canned beans without juices pasta water also a bit of heavy cream and brought it to a simmer for 5 to 8 min so it thickened.
5.)	Also I added fresh parsley and fresh Reggiano Parmagiano 
6.)	Instead of salt I used kosher salt. 
7.)	 After adding the pasta to the sauce I then added the Escarole so that way the sauce would not bitter. 
It is funny my boyfriend asked why I picked out this recipe if I was going to change it. I said it sounds good I like the idea but I will do it my way.

I loved this dish. I used cilantro instead of endive (not a whole head, around 15 stalks), added in fresh tomatoes as well as canned, as well as minced garlic and fresh onions. I also put in mushrooms with the cannellini beans with 1 tbsp. olive oil and it was delicious!

It is a fantastic basic recipe where you can add your favorite ingredients!  I added lemon zest and substituted asparagus instead of escarole. Would be great with some fresh thyme too.

I left out the escarole, b/c where I live it is very hard to find.  This was a tasty dish, with the 'fixes' that others have noted.  I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic, finely chopped onion (just 1/2 of a small one), regular canned tomatoes, and some Italian spices and pepper.  I also used whole grain pasta, b/c that's just what I eat.   A good, satisfying, vegetarian meal with a good protein source. It is a quick meal, but I simmered the 'sauce' for awhile b/c I had the time and wanted the flavours to meld a bit.  Thanks for posting!

I couldn't find escarole anywhere and didn't know a substitute so I got collard greens and they seemed to work fine. I added a little garlic at the beginning and a few shakes of red pepper flakes and topped it with fresh grated Romano like a lot of the other reviewers recommended. It still seemed lack it was lacking some flavor, but I'm not sure what I'd try next time. But I think I will definitely try this one again, but next time with a little more experimentation...

Made this for dinner tonight, as I wanted something high in fiber, but delicious... and it delivered! I used whole wheat penne to add more fiber, and like other reviewers, added a couple sprinkles of red pepper flakes just because I like a little extra heat, and this was delicious. Will definitely make again!

Yum!  Again good, easy, quick and cheap!  I used spinach instead of escarole, only because the store near my house was out, and it still turned out great.

Good recipe, and healthy too.  Like some other reviewers, I added onion, garlic, and 1/2 tomato along with some chili powder and cayenne pepper.  Sauce was a bit too watery, I would advise draining the beans before sauteing.  Overall, tasty and filling.

This recipes is good, except it calls for way too much pasta - this is why most reviewers may have called it bland.  I only used about 8 ounces, vs. the 16 in the recipe, and the pasta to veggie ratio was still way too high.  I also took other reviewers suggestions and added sauted garlic, onion and red pepper flakes. I would make it again with less pasta.

I like it.  Escarole is key.  A teeny weeny bit bland, but 5 stars b/c of how quick and easy it is; it looks cool; and the beans are a good and variable idea.  Good job!

This was horrible.  I sauteed an onion and a few garlic cloves added the escarole.  I cooked the cannellini beans in some chicken broth (about 1 cup) because some reviewers commented on the beans being too hard.  I added the tomatoes to the onion/garlic mixture tossed in the beans with the broth and tossed it all with the pasta.  I'm not sure what it was.  But the beans and pasta mixture was gross.  I really expected more from this recipe and even with my additions it was way too bland.  We like a little more flavor in our food.  I feel like I wasted some good escarole on this recipe.  I added a ton of red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese just to get thru eating it.  Won't make again.  Sorry.

great recipe, made this for my family, huge success. I added some chicken stock and crusher red pepper. Also, if you want add a cup of the water from the penne after you have mixed the ingredients, it will add a little juice to dip your bread.

I sauted some fresh minced garlic and chopped onion in some olive oil as suggested by some other reviewers.  Also, I only used 8 oz of pasta and it was plenty.  I think a whole pound would have been way too much.  I've never cooked with escarole before and I'm not sure I liked it all that much. If I make this again, I think I would use spinach instead.  I didn't use the liquid from the beans, but added some water and chicken broth granules.  This was okay, but not spectacular.  I did feel like I was eating a healthy meal, though.

Not very good flavor.  Tried to save it from the start based on other reviews  by adding more seasonings including red pepper flakes.  The problem may be too much pasta in relation to other ingredients.  On the plus side, it was cheap and easy..and the possums liked it.

I substituted the escarole for spinach since the store was out of it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was simple & quick, but the taste was too bland. My husband who eats just about anything didn't like it. I wanted to really like this recipe, but probably won't make it again.

Made it without the tomatoes, since I didn’t have any.  The beans in liquid with the cooking down of the escarole left for plenty of creaminess.  I added some olive oil and a little ricotta, salt, pepper and garlic powder with a little Romano.  It was delicious!

I'm not a vegetarian but do like to do "meatless Mondays" or at least try things that don't have meat in them.  I didn't have Penne Pasta or Escarole, but I did have small egg noodles, some leftover broccoli florets, and frozen chopped spinach.  I noticed that the only seasoning in this recipe was salt and pepper to taste...that just seemed too bland for me.  So, I made sure to add some chopped onion and minced garlic.  Also, there's nothing like adding Mrs. Dash seasoning to food instead of salt (especially since I have to watch my sodium intake.). Next time, I think I'll try adding some red pepper flakes to spice/zip this dish up a bit more.  This is the kind of dish you can season it however you like.   I served it with a homemade veggie burger and a baked yam.  It was a filling dinner and my Husband did like it.  I'd make this for us again.

I found the dish lacking in flavor. I did sauté a fresh onion and 2 large cloves of garlic but felt it was still missing something.
If I make this again I will spice it up some.

I didn't have the exact ingredients.  I used black beans, Swiss Chard and diced tomatoes w/chilies.  I also sauteed some garlic and onions then threw the chard the drained beans and undrained tomatoes in the pan and seasoned with salt and pepper.  I sauteed until the chard wilted then added some pasta water and a splash of cream.  I mixed with bowtie pasta - la lesser amount than the recipe called for.  I thought it was just great.  Even though I used different ingredients I kept with the original idea and was very pleasedd.

Delicious and really easy. I made some slight changes because our family loves garlic. I added 3 crushed garlic cloves, a little garlic powder, some red pepper flakes, grated parmesan and an extra can of tomatoes (undrained). This was a hit even with my picky mom in law!

I will not be making this recipe again. It was just "okay," nothing special. I added a small chopped onion & some garlic. It seemed like the tomatoes & escarole just did not mix well with the penne- it kind of sat on top. 

Tip: Those who mentioned it being a bit bland, make sure you use a can of diced tomatoes WITH seasoning

Yummy! Even the meat eaters were pleased. I was a little dissappointed with the lack of protein (only 11 gs per person with a whopping 50 gs of carbs), perhaps more beans and less pasta are in order. I used mustard greens instead because I couldn't find escarole at the store and online said it would be a good substitute (it was). I also used whole wheat penne.

This was an easy, delicious, light meal.  Definitely saute 3 cloves of garlic in the oil before adding the other ingredients.  Spinach would also work in this dish and meat could be added if you like.

So bland, even after after tons of garlic.  I could possibly see it being better with a meat, like sausage or chicken as others have stated, but will never make it again as is.  The beans totally ruined the meal for me.  There was too much and added nothing to the flavor.

i wasn't really a fan of this recipe. I have never had escarole before and it tasted pretty bitter.

This was really interesting. I would have never thought to put beans in a pasta dish. I used a clove of garlic and added some bit sized chunks of chicken breast and it was a hit. Thanks!

My family really likes this recipe and it is so quick and easy that it has become part of the regular rotation. Instead of escarole I use fresh spinach leaves, because I usually have them on hand. I also add fresh garlic, basil and Italian seasoning.  I garnish with some crumbled feta.  Great recipe!

I had to add some meat to it for my family, so I added mediteranian seasoned turkey sausage and a package of spinach instead of the escarole.  Excellent!

This is a very good, simple recipe. I followed it exactly, except I only used 1/2 of a 13oz bag of chopped escarole, which was still plenty. Great for a simple dinner or a side dish - and very healthy, too!

I thought this dish was extremely easy to make and very good.  I followed to a tee except that the diced tomatoes I purchased were with garlic and olive oil.  I also used a much smaller portion or the escarole but I think it's easy to eye-ball how much is needed.  Very quick, wonderful side dish.  Will make again!

This recipe left alot to be desired.  It lacked flavor and was not moist at all.  Maybe if I just cooked the escarole first then added the beans.  Just not what I expected.  Probable will not make again.

Fantastic! I added 3 cloves of garlic, a small onion and a small amount of green pepper (all minced) and 2 tbs olive oil. It is one of our favorites. We make it at least once a week.

We really liked this.  Easy to prepare, my husband cooked this for dinner tonight (and he doesn't cook very often, so if he can make it, anyone can).  It was initially a little bland for our taste, so we took the suggestion of some other reviews and added some salsa, 1 1/2 grilled chicken breast halves, and a little cheese to the dish.  Very yummy, easy, healthy, and very budget friendly!!  Only cost us about $3 to make, and there are tons of leftovers!!  Yeah, that means dinner for another night!!

I thought this was sort of bland, and I think I cooked the escarole too much.

This ended up pretty boring after I made all my changes. I skipped the greens, added onion and garlic, Sully liked the beans.

This was delicious, I did saute garlic and onios and instead of escarole, I used spinach. I didn't think that it was as good the second night, it tasted better when the pasta and beans were firmer.

I added the pasta al dente and served it as a soup. A little crushed red pepper and topped with some fresh parmesian cheese.

I'm normally not a pasta eater but I have been counting calories lately and made this simply based on the low calories.  I ended up loving it and am finding that eating healthy is not so bad!  I did add more garlic and some crushed red pepper.  Will make this again.

This recipe was awesome. I cooked a little garlic and onion in a bit of olive oil before I added the escarole and other ingredients. I also used about half of the juice from the can of tomatoes with garlic and onion. I loved it and we will continue to make this again and again. This recipe should get 5 stars alone on how easy it is to make.

I am normally a pasta fan but found this recipe to be really bland.  And I think that it was almost a little "gritty" to my taste.  We added extra onion and garlic but still found it to be bland. I don't think this is on the list to make again - too many other good recipes to try!

Loved the ease of this recipe and feel it has the potential for excellence.  I followed recipe as described and found it bland.  In the future I would add garlic, olive oil, etc. that others recommended.  Also we topped it with parmesan cheese.

I prepared this tasty dish for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  My wife is a Vegan and was a perfect dish for dinner.
