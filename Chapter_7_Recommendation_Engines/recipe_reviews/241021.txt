This is a good base smoothie recipe.  You can use cottage cheese instead of the yogurt, use some frozen fruit and leave out the ice.  Use any fruit that you have ripe or plentiful.  Add spinach, for a veggie serving without the veggie-taste.  If you are watching your calories or sugar watch how much fruit and sweetened yogurt you use or you will end up with a high calorie dessert instead of a healthy smoothie.

What's not to like here???  Used vanilla yogurt, so I left out the vanilla extract, and used flaxseed meal.  Very nice.

Yum!  I froze my fruits to add to the frosty texture I prefer and skipped the ice.  I used blood oranges, strawberries, bananas and a little pineapple I had leftover from some fruit salad.  You can truly use any combination of fruits you may have on hand.  I also used a little vanilla almond milk in place of the ice, honey and extract.  Flax seeds would add to the texture creating silkiness, once pureed, but I chose to use almond bran to up the fiber considerably.  Small adaptations to a great base recipe.

Yum-O!  I added more strawberries and about 2 Tbs. honey.  This would make a great start for a weekend for two, or a busy morning on the go, or even an afternoon pick-me-up.  I used flax meal, which was what I had on hand.  So good, and thanks for the idea!

A good, basic smoothie recipe. Not too sweet or too tart. Although, with a whole orange being used, it made the smoothie very string with all the pulp, and I'm not one to like that at all. I used frozen strawberries to skip the ice and I used vanilla flavored yogurt to skip the vanilla extract.

This smoothie was good, but I found it to be a bit bitter. I think adding a touch of honey as other reviewers did may help.

I left out the vanilla extract and flax seeds (because of strawberry seeds) and instead of yogurt added 1/4 c of silken tofu.  Really enjoyed the blend of flavors :)

This is a wonderful breakfast drink to start your day.  I didn't have flax seed so I substituted wheat germ which worked out perfectly.

It is a nice beverage to start your day. For me it needed some sweetness so I added a tablespoon of Agave Nectar.It was quite enjoyable.
