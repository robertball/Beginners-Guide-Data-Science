I altered the recipe so much that I probably shoudn't rate it but I wanted to leave a review to let y'all know how adaptable & flavorful it is. I used leftover pork (spanish pork w/ white wine from this site) but my leftovers were very juicy & tender. I can't recommend leftover pork that is dry or tough.  I did not have fresh ginger nor chile paste so I subbed ground ginger & red pepper flakes (foodsubs.com is a great resource for knowing what to sub) but not in the same quantities...I just taste tested it & quit when it tasted right. I, of course, did not use the marinade since my pork was precooked. In addition to the peppers, I added mushrooms & frozen, thawed snow peas. Because of the addition of the veggies I had to increase the teriyaki sauce. I sauteed the veggies in sesame oil for a few minutes, added the leftover pork cubes & then added the teriyaki, ginger & red pepper flakes...allowing it to simmer for a little while until liquid was absorbed. I served it over jasmine rice & instead of garnishing it w/ toasted almonds, I sliced up a bit of green onions. Mandarin Almond Salad (from thsi site) was the perfect complement

This was soooo good.  I wanted to scrap the plate, and lick it!!!!  For the teriyaki sauce I made my own...1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 soy sauce, 1 Tablespoon cider vinegar, 1 garlic, 1/2 tsp powered ginger, 1 tsp. chilli pepper.  Then I mixed the 3 T. fresh ginger that it called for.  I used it all(not just 5 T.) Then I mixed up some cornstarch with water and added a little at a time(1 T. cornstarch, 1 T. water)  I also marinaded the prokloin over night and baked it for an hour.  It was so tender I could have cut it with a fork!!!! Cooled it and stirfried it with the peppers and sauce.

This was very good.  But it's an awful lot of oil (5 T of Olive Oil in the marinade and 5 T of Vegetable Oil for stir frying).  We drained off the Olive Oil in the marinade before stir frying, but it still seemed like too much with the residule marinade plus the stir fry oil.  The recipe says to "continue to stir fry until most of the liquid has evaporated"...but there is way too much oil, plus other additives to do that without overcooking the meat and peppers.

Has anybody tried not adding the V Oil for stir frying and just stir frying with the Marinade?  Better for you...

This is a great stir fry as printed. For us we have to turn down the "heat" a little but otherwise no substitutes.   I will not rate a recipe that I have taken apart - this is very unfair.   Thanks for a lovely meal.

We tweaked this a bit, but loved every bit.  We substituted the mint for cilantro and chili for red pepper flakes, as others suggested.  We also substituted a few tbsp of veggie oil for sesame oil, which added a wonderful flavor.  Also, we discovered we were out of teriaki sauce so we substituted with soy sauce.  we only needed about 2 tbsp of soy (as opposed to the 5 tbsp of teriaki it calles for).  We plan to make this one again and again!

Yum.  Everyone loved this recipe! The pork had a wonderful flavor and it looked gorgeous on the serving plate.  I didn't have mint, so used green onion & cilantro.  Served over steamed calrose rice and side pot stickers.  MMMMM

This was a very good stir fry meal.  I used ground ginger (didn't have fresh on hand) and I didn't have the hot chili paste either.  I added some hot pepper flakes to the marinade and used hoisin sauce in place of the chili paste for flavor.  I substituted one tbsp. of sesame oil when cooking the pork. I added a sliced rib of celery with the bell peppers, and the thickener (one tbsp. of both cornstarch and cold water) and two sliced green onions at the end.  One bag of Success rice was just the right amount to go with this recipe.

This was very good. I normally make chicken stir fry, but now we will be eating pork more often! I added a little oyster sauce, honey & lime juice for more flavour. Thanks for a great recipe.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I don't like really spicy dishes, and this one wasn't too spicy--it was just right! I got so many compliments on it! I am not a huge fan of mint, so I just sprinkled green onions on the top. I will definitely make it again and again! I am going to add snow peas and bean sprouts next time...YUM!

Great stir fry recipe!  I did not use the chile paste but added some red chile flakes instead.  I also added a sliced onion and fresh snow peas which were a really nice addition.  The fresh ginger really makes this dish so I wouldn't skimp on that. After the pork and all of the veggies were done cooking I removed them with a slotted spoon and still had a lot of liquid in the bottom of my wok.  I then turned up the heat and reduced the liquid until it was a thicker sauce.  Poured it over the stir fry and that made it over the top good!  Served this on a bed of brown rice...delicious!

Wow...really loved it.  Love the tang of the vinegar and the spice of the black pepper (I am heavy on that).  The whole family loved it.    The sauce was a bit thin in the end so I thickened it with a bit of cornstach and water.  VERY GOOD!

This is a good basic stir fry.  I tried with vegetables instead of meat. I didn't have the teriyaki sauce instead I added some stuff I had in my pantry just to use it up, like eal sauce and oyster sauce.  It was a hit.

We've already made this recipe four times at my house. It's a keeper! The only thing I do differently is add the marinade to the stir-fry so it comes out a bit saucy. It's delicious over the rice! I also sometimes add pineapple, as I'm a pineapple fiend. Reminds me of thai sweet and sour.

Sorry to say this but this recipe fell short of expectations. It just wasn't that great. It's a nice try but I can get a more tasy meal far more easily.

Definitely use more vegetables.  When I make it again, I will double the vegetables and increase the liquids accordingly. I marinated the meat for several hours and I included some minced ginger and shallot sauce rather than using fresh ginger. The dish was extremely good. Will Make again.

My husband and I had this for dinner last night. I worried that it might come out really spicy because of the peppers and chili paste, but then it came out just right and very flavorful!   I used regular white distilled vinegar because I didn't have rice wine vinegar. Then for hot chili paste, I only have Chili Garlic paste and I added only half a teaspoon because the brand I got is more concentrated than Lee Kum Kee.   I followed the mix of Teriyaki Sauce from one of the reviewers but omitted a few items and brought it down to: sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic powder, ginger powder and cornstarch.   Definitely will make it again and again!

This was pretty good, but could have used a little more flavour. I also think the pork could have benefited from a couple hours in the marinade as opposed to just the 30 minutes to make it a little more tender. I planned to serve it over rice, but I ended up adding the rice to the wok to absorb the liquid that was leftover. It turned out good, I would do that again.

I used this recipe mainly for the marinade and reminding me to use chile paste. The meat was very tender but I did keep it in the marinade overnight and the next full day. I added lots of veggies and it was great!

I omitted the extra oil for stir frying.  Sprayed the pan with Pam, drained most of the marinade off the meat, and it all fried up just fine.  I was a little concerned that the meat and peppers were essentially boiling instead of being stir fried--but that concern was dismissed once I thickened it.  I took another reviewer's advice and added a little less than 2 T. of cornstarch at the end.  Mmmm!  Hubby and the family loved it!

This was delicious!.  I do not know what hot chili paste is nor could I find it in the store so I added one tablespoon premium chili powder to one tablespoon tomato paste.  That was the only change I made.  This is a keeper and I will make it again and again and again.....

I dind't have pork loin so I used prok chops instead. I had no fresh ginger so I used 1 tsp. dried ginger. I too, could not find chili paste, and used hot garlic chili sauce. Flavor of meal was awesome. The sauce was a bit grainy though. Also I would add the peppers later than it advises because they become very soft and lose all their crispness.

This was delicious as well as easy!!  I used left over pork roast so I didn't use the marinade.  However, I added a couple dashes of rice wine vinegar to the stir fry.  Other than that, I would not change a thing about this recipe.

Excellent!  I added a TBSP of soy sauce to the marinade and for the stir fried I used red pepper flakes, peanuts and added a 1/4 cup of sweet and sour sauce at the very end.   Will definetely make it again.

The meal was good, but very light.  We served it for company and came up a little short in terms of filling everyone up.  We'll try it again, but over a bed of rice.

Absolutely fabulous! Thanks for the recipe! The only changes made were I used the small amount of red chili flakes in the marinade & replaced the red chili paste with hoisin sauce. Instead of red bell pepper I used red onions & added some canned bamboo shoots. Also at the end I added a small amount of corn starch. Served with Jasmine rice.

i really enjoyed this, but i couldn't find the chile paste and i don't think it was something you can leave out.  it is a little bland without it.  i don't know what i can put in place of it b/c i don't think it is available in my area.  any suggestions?

This was the best. I couldn't find chili paste, only chili sauce, so I used it. I doubled the amount, because we like spicy. We served it over Basmati Rice and it was outstanding. Thank goodness for leftovers.

Left out the hot chili paste, so maybe that was the problem, but not particularly flavorful.

My husband made this tonight and we are already excited to eat the leftovers! He made a couple of modifications and additions, but generally stuck to the flavor profile which was wonderful. He used the marinade as the base for the stir fry so did not add any vegetable oil. It wasn't necessary and more healthy without. He used red curry paste in place of the hot chile paste and added some sliced carrots and celery to give it more vegetables. He also left the almonds out because neither of us are crazy about nuts in stir fry.

I did alter this a bit.  I added shrimp to the pork, I left out peppers and onions and used a head of broccoli  also used chili powder instead of Chili paste. Used rice cooking wine instead. Omitted almonds and mint.  It was delicious!

When I made this I added 1 cup of baby carrots (quartered), 1/4 cup of chopped water chestnuts, 1/2 cup of pineapple and 1 tablespoon of Sriracha hot sauce. The sweet and the spice blended exceptionally well.

Delicious. I used only 1 teaspoon of Thai chili paste - we are not hot & spicy people - and the amount of heat was perfect for us. I used All Recipes Simple Teriyaki Sauce recipe since I had none. Only used 2 tablespoons of oil for stir-frying.

I used left over pork loin from the night before and so decided to forego marinating the meat beforehand. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and my family LOVED it! Even my picky teens went back for seconds.  Thank you for sharing!

A few variations. We omitted the hot sauce (kids) and since we only had one pepper, we threw in some onion, broccoli and edamame.

This was excellent. We added some additional veggies, which were really well suited for the sauce. It is like a spicy teriyaki. Veggies we added were snow peas, pineapple chunks, and a small sliced sweet onion. My family thought water chestnuts would have made it even better.

This was an excellent dish. very flexible. We added a few items, snow peas, mushrooms, a handful of Asian salad mix (shredded cabbage, celery and carrots). Used the chili flakes instead of paste. Since we were making for two, we used two boneless pork chops instead of four and the sauce for four.  We made the teriyaki sauce one of the other reviewers had  posted.  It was soooooo good.  We served with steamed white rice.

I altered the recipe because this was a quick lunch. I didn't have all the same ingredients. I used raspberry vinegar, bok choy and a chilli sauce not paste. I halted the recipe using stir fry pork strips.

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  The only changes I made were not using chili paste because I was out, but added a dash of spicy asian teriyaki.  I used seasoned rice vinegar and added mushrooms and baby spinach.  I did not discard the marinade, but added it to the vegetables with a little corn starch to thicken.  I skipped the mint, but the toasted almonds were a perfect compliment. The sauce was really tasty.  It's a keeper.

At the suggestions of other reviews, I reduced oil to 2Tbs. when it called for 5Tbs.- a total of 4 Tbs. for entire recipe.  Much better.  I also added a Tbs of cornstarch to thicken it.  It was yummy:)

I was missing chili powder but decided to press on with it since my audience was a little spice-sensitive. They loved it!  I loved it. The instructions at the end about continuing to stir-fry until most of the liquid had evaporated was a little off, since there were 5 tablespoons of veg oil and that wasn't going anywhere. Other than that, great recipe!

Hubby wasn't too thrilled when I showed him this recipe at his "what's for supper?"  Boy, did he change his tune to "You can make this any time!"  Only two alterations:  I wanted it a little sweeter so I added about 2 tablespoons of sweetened chili sauce (for Spring Rolls) and didn't add the mint because I only had dried.  Served it with fried rice made with sprouts I grew this week especially for this purpose.  Hubby was sorry I halved the recipe (he won't eat leftovers).  Great tasting dish and so pretty too.

Tried to followed directions, but only had 2 1/2 T of EVOO left and used only that amount instead of the 5.  I didn't need to thicken the sauce as others suggested because it did cook down after adding in the veggies.  Then at end I completely forgot to put on the almonds and mint even thought I had them both prepared.  I'm a dork.  But hey, it was really good anyway.  I served it over a little bit of brown rice.  So easy, yummy and will absolutely be making this one again.

This was just okay. I served it over steamed fried noodles as I do every stir fry I make and it was very dry.  Certainly needs more sauce. In fact it needs so much tweaking as other reviewers suggest, might as well just find another pork stir fry recipe that doesn't require as much to make it edible. Hubby thought it was pretty good but I probably won't repeat this one.

I cut the chili past in half and added 4 cut-up tomatoes. I also let the meat sit in the marinade for 5 hours. I didn't have teriyaki sauce so used hoisin. Wonderful dish!

This was EXCELLENT! I followed another reviewer's recipe for Teriyaki sauce and everything turned out great. Used jarred ginger, garlic and chili and it was faster and delish. :)  I will cut back on the sugars though next time. Maybe. lol

I marinaded the pork all day in the fridge.  Took it out in time to get to room temperature,  Switched one of the peppers for julienne carrots.  It was delicious.  Leaves a great after-taste.
