I've done this with crescent rolls.  Just open the tube, roll each piece up with the ends sticking out, add a small piece of cheese if you like, and bake.  They are wonderful!  And much easier to work with than puff pastry.

I loved these...simple, yet a bit different than the typical "pigs in a blanket." They were perfect for our Super Bowl supper and the leftovers were good for breakfast. Tasty stuff!!

I made a bunch of changes to the recipe - But it was fabulous! I only had filo dough - so i used 5 sheets of that (I sprayed PAM in between the sheets.) I used turkey deli and honey-mustard salad dressing to coat it. I placed the deli in the middle of the filo dough and folded the sides in. I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled it with sesame seeds - I baked it for about 25 minutes - It was sooo good!

This is a very easy recipe. However, the only thing I did not like was the inside of the puff pastry was soggy. I cooked them until golden which was 25 minutes. So as a result the puff pastry kept falling off making it messy. I used mild pork sausage and dijon mustard instead.

This was just o.k. for me.  Thought that the puff pastry was just too bland.  I will stick with the crescent roll version.  We wanted to love it, but just o.k. for us.

These were yummy, but I haven't worked with Puff Pastry too much and could use a bit more direction written into the recipe to help me work with the pastry.
