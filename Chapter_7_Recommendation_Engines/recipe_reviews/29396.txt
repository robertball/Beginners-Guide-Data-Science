My husband, who doesn't like cherry pie, made this & gave it a 5 star. He said it was easy to do & didn't have the "taste" he doesn't like from cherry pie. By the way, he also made the pie crust from scratch. (what a keeper he is)

I substitute dried cranberries instead of raisins. and 1/4 cup of dextrose (only sold at health food stores) and 1/2 cup of organic sugar (evaporated cane juice) instead of 3/4 C of refined sugar. super easy and super yummy!

I doubled the recipe and filled 30 tart shells.  Very pretty for Christmas and really really tasty!  A really good faux cherry pie but not quite.  I'll still make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!
