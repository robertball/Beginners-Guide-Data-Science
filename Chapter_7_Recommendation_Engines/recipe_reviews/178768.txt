I love these. Every time I make them for a potluck or gathering, they're gone in minutes. I've always used the garlic butter flavored crescent dough instead; makes it taste even more pizza-like! To prevent the innards from spilling out, I cut them so that the seam is on the bottom of the roll- things still spill, but tend to do so a lot less this way. Thank you for sharing!

These were good-not too easy to roll up.  Mine fell apart as I was trying to cut them, but they were good.

These were quick and easy to make. Having a good serrated knife made the cuts easier. I don't think crescent rolls are the right flavor though ... almost too savory. We definitely had leftovers.

The kids thought this was great, so did the adults, I made it for a school recitle to serve as finger food.  The only thing I did different was I did not have a can of pizza sauce I used spaghetti sauce - yummy!

The clean up is disastrous, and their taste isn't exactly what I was expecting. They are "eh" at best.

These tasted ok..but making them was not as simple as they make it sound. Plus there is no way I could get 6 pinwheels out of each rectangle..

I love it!! These are absolutely delectable! I decided to make these with my niece (3 yrs) and it was great! It was a little messy, but not too bad. Make sure that you roll them up very tightly, or else they spill out a lot when you slice them, but other than that the recipe is golden!

Made these last year for a Christmas Eve buffet and they were a HUGE hit!! Made some with green pepper and some without and both were gone as soon as I took them out of the oven. All the flavor of pizza rolls but SO much more elegant!!

These tasted good, but were unattractive. They were not eaten at my family's event because no one knew what they were. The filling spilled out, just not appetizing. Not recommended for a party dish.

I thought these were OK. I will have to try to make them with regular pizza dough instead of the crescent dough. I normally like its taste but in this recipe it just tasted wrong. My kids liked it though!

Very tasty, and quick. I had trouble cutting them so, I didn't. I was just making them for my husband and I, so presentation wasn't an issue.

I made these for my 6 & 7 year old boys as a quick lunch. They both enjoyed them and said they'd eat them again.
