Nothing annoys me more than someone posting a review when they didn't follow the recipe as written... and now someone posting a 1-star review who didn't even TRY it.  Use some common sense people!!!  This is delicious as written.  If you choose to spice it up or alter it somehow, that's your choice but shouldn't be a criticism of the recipe.

I saw this recipe on Facebook and now I see it here. I tried it today and added 3/4 cups brown rice and 1 1/2 cups more water. I used spicy diced tomatoes. I cooked it on top of the stove for about 1 1/2 hours on a simmer. It turned out so delicious. I serve it with sour cream on the side. I love cabbage rolls and this is a reasonable facsimile. There will be leftovers for lunches. Yum!

This was a very good recipe. However, I made a couple of adjustments. I wanted rice, so I added 1/2 cup of instant rice and added 1 cup of liquid. I try to use beef or chicken broth instead of water in most recipes, so I substituted beef broth in this case. My husband said it was better than rolled cabbage rolls. I agree, and I think the flavors blended better this way. I may never roll cabbage again.

I've been making this recipe for over 40+ years and there are so many variations. I've never had an actually recipe.  I just throw ingredients in the pot. I've made it with ground turkey or chicken. I've omitted ground meats and added kielbasa and have also made it with sweet sausage.  Always add garlic. Added rice or chopped or slice potato. Normally add a teaspoon or 2 of sugar.  This is a great basic recipe play with the ingredients and spices.  No matter what you add or not it's always satisfying. Kraft recipes also has a version of it also.  Thanks for sharing.

Unstuffed cabbage roll, genius.  I tried this recipe, and it essentially mimics any cabbage roll filling.  Don't put Campbell's soup in this.  Instead, take a can of tomato paste and add water to your liking to taste.  Tomato paste is tangy and can be regulated with your personal salt content. Campbell's soup is salt in a can.  I bought two cans of tomato paste in case I needed a tomato flavor. It's cheap, and does not taste like soup, you are putting into, well, soup.  I surfed the web and found a lot of people use brown sugar, vinegar, or lemon in the recipe.  The vinegar and lemon would be used to cut the cabbage bitterness... and sugar... to mimic American-Italian sauces?  They contain a lot of sugar, by the way.  I did add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  BUT THAT'S IT.  Turned out awesome.  I freezed half of it for later. Everyone loved it.

For more flavor, I replace the plain tomato sauce with Campbell's Tomato Soup.

Only thing I changed was I added 1 cup of water and 1 cup of rice. This tastes just like Halupki's without the mess of boiling the cabbage and wrapping with meat and rice.

My family enjoys this recipe, but I add about 1/8 cup of vinegar & 1 tbsp of sugar to give it the flavor of the stuffed cabbage they love!  Healthy, easy & delicious!!

Excellent dish, does need more spice...added additional salt & pepper, along with some brown sugar.  Cooked about a 1/2 hour longer than stated, to let flavors blend and to soften the cabbage a little more.  Served on a bed of rice.

I decided to try this recipe, but of course I had to add my own "flavor" to the dish.  I sauteed the chopped cabbage, garlic, salt and pepper in a little EVOO for about 5 minutes before adding the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I also added some apple-wood smoky flavored bacon bits to the sauteed cabbage.  One more change--I used fire roasted diced tomatoes.  The results--delicious!

I've made this dish several times. As written, I'd rate it 3 stars. But, I agree with the other reviews. It needs more spice. I added 2 teaspoons of sweet paprika and it raised my rating to 4 stars.

This is really good as is, but the second time I made it, I did some things differently to add some more Eastern European flavor. First, after you drain the meat, add the cabbage to the empty pan and saute until it's a bit brown. Also add and saute a teaspoon of caraway seeds and a quarter teaspoon of allspice.  Add some brown sugar to taste with the tomatoes. Serve with a dollop of sour cream on top.  Yum!

Tried it last night - loved that there are no starches.  Used diced tomatoes with green chiles and threw in a few crushed peppers.  It was delicious.  My skeptical partner loved it.  I am guessing very few Weight Watcher points...

When I made this dish, my son and daughter-in-law were over with their little ones. They didn't stay for dinner but they did taste it and asked for the recipe! I used only 1 lb. of ground beef, a can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, a 15-oz. can of petite diced tomatoes, and a 15-oz. can of stewed tomatoes. I added one beef bouillon cube, about 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. I also added 1 1/2 cups brown rice and 3 cups more water. I cooked it on the stove top in a large dutch oven for an hour stirring frequently. The rice took a long time to cook. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The Worcestershire sauce is probably unnecessary. I feel if I followed the recipe exactly it would have been just as delicious. A great tasting, easy to prepare meal!

This is a great recipe for your pressure cooker .  You can brown your meat  and onions  in the pot, then add the liquid and your rice  and throw the cabbage on top.  I  always use a little bit of cumin  and some extra spices as other readers suggested. Cooks under medium pressure for 7 minutes and use quick release on pressure.  Perfect.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it twice now in as many weeks; it's just impossible to get tired of it.  When taste-testing it, I decided to add several Tbsp. of brown sugar to counteract the tomatoes, one shredded carrot (just because), and used 3 cans of tomatoes in place of the water/tomato sauce (because I didn't have any sauce).  I left my chunks of cabbage a little larger than shown in the photo so, obviously, had to cook it a bit longer.  It is so easy to put together and tastes so good...I'm delighted to add this new recipe to my list of "Favorites."

This turned out great!  I stuck to the recipe but added 1 cup cooked white rice and a small can of sauerkraut to make it more like more like my Nana's stuffed cabbage.

This is a great as is but I do add extra salt and pepper and 1 additional can of tomato sauce and skip the water since I make it in a crock pot it seems to have plenty of juice and I think I'm gonna add sauerkraut to it the next time and I always serve it over a bed of white rice with mashed potatoes right next to and use some of the juice from the dish like gravy...comfort food for sure!

I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was meh. So I read the other reviews and saw what they were doing. I added 2 tbsp white vinegar, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1 tbsp Spanish paprika and it was pretty good! Without those things it was really blah. I also served it with rice. Next time I'll cook the rice into it, but I wanted to give the recipe a try "as is" this time. I also read that other people added stock instead of water. Not a bad idea.

To those wanting extra flavor, substitute 1 pound of your favorite breakfast sausage for half the the meat needed (1 part to 1 part). Mix evenly the sausage (Bob Evans for me) & the ground beef before browning & definitely drain off most of the fat. Leave a couple of tablespoons to saute the o&g, and follow the rest of the recipe. Personally I would add the tomato sauce after the o&g, and work the good flavorful bits in the bottom of the pot from the beef & sausage. Then add everything else including rice.(add 1 cup of water to 1 cup of rice).

I didn't have rice at home, at this time, so I used beef flavored Rice-A-Roni which has a seasoning packet with it, it was awesome! I also used a large package of shredded cabbage(like to make cole slaw)so I didn't have to slice up a cabbage head.

I noticed from the reviews that if you make it as listed, it is lacking in flavor.  I used the recipe as a guide and since I already make stuffed cabbage on my own - I know what I like and what a recipe would need.  I like to use Tomato Juice.  You get the water you need without any loss of flavor.  Want a kick?  Use the tomato based vegetable juices (like V8) - the spicy one is a favorite of mine.  The goal with a comfort food recipe like this is to let it cook and let all the flavors blend together.  Use a crock pot or (because you have enough liquid with the tomato juice) bake it longer in the oven.  The water evaporates, the cabbage becomes very tender and the flavors intensify.  How much?  Put the ingredients in the crock pot or dish and pour until covered.  Works  every time.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I made only one change - I switched out cabbage for 16 ozs of Boar's Head Sauerkraut (drained, not rinsed).  It was delicious on rice.

I've made this before and loved it and I'm making it again right now. All I do different is add 1/2 pound of sausage and also add green peppers to my meat and a cup of rice for that little extra flavor. I've stopped making cabbage rolls, this is just so much easier and it really goes a long way. Tomorrow it will be better than today. It's 5 star in my book.

Try adding caraway seeds. Not too many adds more flavor for those looking for spices to add. Add some sauerkraut tastes like hungarian stuffed cabbage rolls!

I keep getting emails asking me to rate a recipe I saved. I feel a little hustled, especially since I must have save this one accidentally. So the person that's getting cross with people becouse  they are not apparently showing common sense is going to love this post. So  Cabbage Roll is by definition  assorted stuffing stuffed and rolled into a cabbage leaf and hence the Cabbage  Roll !!  There is no unstuffed Cabbage Roll . There was  no stuffing of anything in this recipe, therefore it either a casserole or a stew or any other name you can come up with that might apply but not  Cabbage Roll. Having said that, it sounds easy and tasty and just a little over cooked . But Miss Common  Sence was right if you change the recipe don't whine if  then you don't like it.

This needed a kick to it so I used two cans mild Rotel tomatoes in place of regular tomatoes. Plus a bit of garlic and a dash of hot sauce.

My husband and i loved it just as it was.  I like a mild spice but think Delmonte jalapeno diced tomatoes (if I could get them where i live) would add a great extra zing.  It is not too spicy, just right.

Since I grew up eating "holupchi", I found the recipe as is, quite good. Serving it over rice would certainly be reasonable and I did add apple cider vinegar and sugar for the sweet and sour taste of Eastern European cooking.

Tried this recipe as it is written and I loved it. I'm a big cabbage fan, and this was really good, even better the next day! I say try it as is first, then if you feel the need, doctor it to fit your tastes!

Very good!  Always a little hesitant in regards to recipes that look a little bland and "healthy" but this was a pleasant surprise.  I did take the others advice and added 2 teaspoons of paprika.  And because I love garlic I added an extra clove of garlic.  I also let it simmer longer.  I follow the recipe until it boiled and then I let it simmer for about 2 hours and it was quite delicious!!!  I think that help bring out the flavors.

I've always wanted to try this but was too intimated by the idea. This recipe was simple enough to give me the courage to try it and I was amazed at how good it was! Given that so many had mentioned that it needed more spice...I did take heed of that and used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies and salt and pepper to my taste. I may try adding rice next time just to get rid of some of the water...I didn't add any extra (or even the 1/2 cup called for) and there was still a sufficient amount of "juice" I topped with Parmesean cheese and it was DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the recipe and adding a new dish to my list of "I can cook".

It's delicious and so much easier than making stuffed rolls. I substituted seasoned salt plus a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes for some additional spice and heat.

We all enjoyed it.  So much easier than making cabbage rolls.   Added 1 1/2 cup brown rice and 3 cups water.  May want to add more tomato sauce in future --especially if adding rice---for more tomato sauce taste.  Used full 2 teaspoons of salt even thought it seemed like a lot and it was perfect.  We used a regular size head of cabbage and with the addition of rice, made at least 8 to 10 servings.

Ive made this recipe 3 times now. The third time, I actually used the crock pot on low for 5 hours (i added extra water). Works great and is very delicious with mashed potatoes.

This is a very good recipe. I really enjoyed it, and my husband and son (who have both tried but never got that excited about cabbage rolls) said they enjoyed this more. The only change I made was to use the flavoured cans of diced tomatoes...I had olive oil-basil-garlic flavour on hand. Simple recipe for a pretty quick dinner!

After seeing this on facebook my husband and I made it and we were very happy with the results.  We did add about 8 oz. of chopped mushrooms and a bit of "Pensey's" Mural of Flavor.  Used low salt tomatoes but did add a bit of sea salt.  we served it over a  brown rice and quinoa mix.

Love this as a base for a recipe... I switched out hamburger and ground organic andouille sausage in a food processor. I also added more water and added about 1 cup of quinoa. My picky future husband even at this!

I’m not a huge fan of ground beef, so I used chicken. I also don’t especially care for tomato based soups, so I used chicken stock instead. In favor of cabbage I used noodles. I also added some chopped celery, carrots, and salt and pepper to taste................... Ok, now that everyone gets my point about altering the recipe to your own tastes, this recipe (not an altered version), that **is** listed..is delicious. If you’ve altered the recipe and think it’s great, add your own recipe with your alterations, rather posting all about it in the comments.

My family and I love this recipe.  I love that it is grain free, as I have dietary restrictions, but can serve it on a bed of rice for the rest of the clan.  A little extra salt and pepper is all it needs, delicious as written!

Definitely a keeper!  I liked finding a recipe that is quick, simple, tasty and nourishing.  I feel like my body is saying thank you while I eat it.  The only change I made is cooking it a little longer so the cabbage is softer.  I have passed this recipe on to several friends and family and they like it also.

4 star for the recipe as is. With some changes it is easily a 5 star. 

I cut the salt down to 1 tsp. as there is plenty of salt in canned tomato sauce. I added 1 tsp. Paprika, 1/2 tsp.  caraway seeds, 1/8 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1 tsp. of brown sugar. 

Serve with rice and it is yummy!

I tried this with half beef (90/10) and half ground turkey.  It was really good. My second recipe was 100 percent lean ground turkey. I found the half beef/turkey to have a bit more flavor.  After it sits in refrigerator it gets better the next few days.  I only altered the meat part as turkey is easier for me to digest. I like how easy it is to make.  I used a large domed skillet and transferred to enamel coated stock pot since cabbage takes a while to reduce in volume. It made it easier to stir without making a mess.

This recipe is perfect as is. There is nothing wrong with some variations though. The second time I made it, I added medium size chunks of potatoes the last 15 minutes of cooking, or till potatoes were just done. It was yummy. Then the next time I made it, I cooked, in a separate pot, some bowtie pasta till aldente, then added it to the cabbage the last few minutes cooking time. (You can use any pasta of your choice). Thing is, every time I made it, it was a big hit.

I love this recipe.  Super easy.  Tasty, healthy results.  Even better on the reheat cycle.  And if you have leftover rice on night 1, simply dump it back into the main dish.  
This recipe just earned its way into my weeknight rotation.

I am rewriting my review & upping my rating to four stars.  I feel my initial one was unfair, as it was based on tasting the  meat & cabbage immediately after I took it off the stove.  This dish needs a little time for the flavors to blend & mellow, as I discovered when I reheated it at dinner time.  Served over mashed potatoes, it was a delicious & filling meal, and with just the two of us there were plenty of leftovers for lunches during the week.  Will definitely be making this one again.

I made this just like the recipe said, and it's delicious. It's the perfect meal for a dreary rainy November day. Seems like it would be easy to alter to your preference too, but I like it just the way it's written.

The only thing I did different was used ground turkey instead of ground beef because that's what I had, but I essentially always substitute beef for turkey with no problems, but this recipe in my opinion was on the tasteless bland side, don't know if had I used ground beef it would have been more flavorful. I shook some red pepper flakes on it to give it some more flavor. It wasn't horrible, and it was healthy, but overall I didn't care for it and won't be making it again

I have made this several times and you do have to perk it up somewhat. First, if you do not like real crunchy cabbage, pan fry the cabbage with bacon grease first. Use the ROTEL HOT diced tomatoes. This will make it very spicy and has a lot better flavor.

I recently made a variation of this recipe, using ground turkey (we have cut red meat out of our diets), browned with Kitchen Bouquet. I also used tomato soup as suggested by Traci (above). My husband just asked me to make it again today!

This is actually a quick & easy dinner, AND it’s a one pot dinner.  Minimal clean up (bonus!).  Very tasty!  At first I questioned the amount of tomato sauce asked for but once the cabbage began to cook down it turned to a sauce that spread to the whole dish.  It’s a keeper!

I love stuffed cabbage but this is so much better! It's easier to make and I get the crunchy parts of the cabbage where as stuffed cabbage is usually the leafy part. Instead of water I used chicken stock and vegetable stock. Instead of mince garlic, I used garlic powder and tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Also, based on another review I read, I add a little bit of apple cider vinegar which I really think was a great touch.

It tasted good but next time I will make it with less beef and more cabbage.  I also add fresh lemon juice before I serve and with wild rice.  Delicious!

We love it as is! Had it before a few months ago and wolfed it down in 2 days...my hubby and I. Finally found the recipe again and Hubby made it again today... it's going fast....lol! Actually, this time, all we had was 3-10 oz cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. Great!

I think this needs a little something extra for flavor.  I like sweet stuffed cabbage, so I added some brown sugar.

This dish is delish! Definitely a new favorite. I’ve made it twice... the first time I didn’t change anything and it was great, just a little too much meat, so the second time, I used ground turkey and half the amount of meat and it was great. Pairs well with cornbread. It’s versatile and oh so good.

I was excited to see this recipe. I grew up having to eat cabbage rolls, but didn’t care for them because of the rice. This recipe is perfect. My husband, the kids and I loved it! I really enjoyed the simplicity of it, easy weeknight meal. I cooked it exactly as written.

This is a fabulous recipe.  It is a complete meal in a large skillet or pan. The flavors blend together so well.  It is so much easier than making stuffed cabbage. Make it, you won’t be sorry!

This is an awesome, healthy dish and my family loved it. I enjoyed eating the leftovers for lunch! A few small changes: I added a heaping tablespoon of dark brown sugar, a small can of tomato paste, a few drops of lemon juice, and about an additional cup of extra water. These additions gave it the "sweet and sour" taste that reminds me of my grandmother's delicious cabbage rolls!

My mom has a Russian friend who makes amazing Stuffed Cabbage Rolls!  They use Vegeta all purpose seasoning in their rolls. So, I replaced the salt with 4 tsp of Vegeta seasoning (found at Walmart in the ethnic foods isle).  Great recipe, as written. So good - even my teenager loved it!

Followed the recipe with exception of adding using ground turkey and some extra spices.  It was a lot easier than rolling up cabbage into rolls.  I did cook for half an hour longer.  Made some hot bread.  YUM!

Very tasty!  One change  I always make is to use "no salt" canned tomato products. I then season with "Lite Salt" that lowers sodium content by 50%.  Taste is exactly the same. My husband hates cabbage but loves cabbage rolls - go figure!
Will make this often in winter.

Real man food. Had this after shoveling the snow from the driveway. I had to drain the pan half way through the cabbage cooking period as my cast iron skillet was ready to overflow. Will use a large pot or buy a Dutch Oven for the next batch. Too bad as I like the cast iron. The only modification I made was doubling the garlic and adding a handful of frozen chopped onions in addition to the chopped fresh onion. This is easy, delicious and filling. A wonderful winter dish when the snow is flying.

A basic recipe that totally works.  We love this recipe and I have made it both stovetop and in a slow cooker.  I think it is even better tasting the next day.  Out of diced tomatoes?  I used crushed that I did have on hand.  Have made it using ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Lots of ways to tweak it, but the original is the best.

Easy meal..  My husband loves this and it does taste better the next day.  I added a can of tomato soup and sauce to the mix but only because I had a larger size head of cabbage.   I served this with white rice on the side.  Great fall meal.

We made, we ate, and we loved this recipe. So much easier than stuffed cabbage.  Our only changes was that we used a larger size head of cabbage. I had without sour cream on top and also with sour cream on top. Either is delicious. Thanks.

Made as directed except I  used fire-roasted diced tomatoes as another reviewer suggested. I cut the recipe in half and had 5-6 servings. Put over rice and served with a dollop of sour cream. Even carb addicted daughter loved it!

OMG, Phenomenally great comfort food!  Used tomato paste mixed with water, since I had no sauce.  I let it simmer for over an hour though.  Real cabbage rolls are braised and the cabbage is supposed to be tender, not crisp! 
Try making this several hours or even a day in advance.  It gets better as it sits.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream.  DO make the entire recipe, because the leftovers are great and this freezes well too.
PLEASE PEOPLE,  MAKE THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN, adjust the salt and pepper to your liking... AND NO TOMATO SOUP!!!

Hubby and I both thought it was good, but it needed more salt and garlic, perhaps more pepper.  Will make it again, with these changes.  I usually add 1 teaspoon salt per pound of ground beef, which is what this recipe calls for, BUT the vegetables need salt as well.  Good dinner, quick and easy.

This recipe is very  good. It goes well with biscuits. Here are a few tips. 1. If you don't have tomato sauce use crushed tomatoes.  Season them with oregano and basil before you add them to the pot.  2. Add two tablespoons of white vinegar and  two tablespoons sugar. You can adjust it to your taste.  And yes it taste much better the next day.

I didn't like it, it didn't taste like cabbage rolls. This recipe made enough to feed an army.

I liked it.  Let it simmer for a bit longer than 30 minutes and served it with rice.  My daughter turned me on to this culinary feast.

LOVE this recipe!!  As is... I'd give it a 4/5, but like others, I tweak it with more salt and pepper and I add 1 tsp Greek seasoning (club house brand).  I also add a half bottle of olive brine (another reviewer used vinegar instead).  Gives it a bit of a tart bite! I also add 1 1/2 c. V8 juice to make the broth a bit more tomato-y.  Might also try adding some sauerkraut on top when serving!  I've been eating this everyday at lunch and couldn't wait this weekend to make another batch for the coming week! YUM!! Tastes just like my mom's delish cabbage rolls without the fuss!

I followed the basic recipe.I also added a half of a chopped red pepper and 1/2 cup of ketchup! This is so delicious! Once everything was sauteed in the dutch oven I put the lid on it and placed it in the oven. It baked at 325° for 2 hours.

My family is crazy about this recipe!  I am too because it is super easy!  I make rice and serve it over rice.  I am sure mashed potatoes or noodles would be amazing as well.  I really feel that this recipe needs more salt and pepper, but that is something that can be added to taste.  I use tomatoes that have garlic/oregano/ and onions added-which improved the flavor of the dish the second and subsequent times that I have made it.  My favorite aspect of this dish is that I can make it on a school/work night with very little effort.

I made this exactly as written. Both my husband and I thought it was quite bland.  I added 4 beef bouillon cubes to the leftovers and that helped. If I make again I will definitely try substituting tomato soup for the tomato sauce as others have suggested.

I found the recipe a bit bland with just salt and pepper. I added some Lea and Perrins marinade for chicken when I was cooking the ground turkey, a lot more garlic, some cayenne pepper, a glug of apple cider vinegar, and a bit of grated nutmeg.

Great recipe!!  Used ground turkey and seasoned with seasoning salt, fresh ground pepper and used diced tomatoes with roasted sweet onion and garlic and good quality tomato sauce. I also added some fresh spinach as I had extra sauc.  Great one pot dish!!  Simmered for only 20 minutes as I don't like my vegetables overcooked. I made some for my Mom and she loved it...so much easier than traditional stuffed cabbage.

Instead of using canned tomatoes, I used tomatoes from my garden.  The taste was exquisite!  Otherwise,  I didn’t change anything.  It has become a family favourite!

I made this for me and my housemates. We all agree this recipe is a keeper. I made it exactly as the recipe suggests but I cooked it in my InstantPot. I sauteed the ground beef/onion in the IP, drained it, then I returned it to the IP. I added in the liquid ingredients and the seasonings, gave it a stir, and tossed the cabbage on top. Twenty minutes at high pressure and it was perfection.

Campbell's soup has a lot of sodium and msg.  I try to avoid.   You can make your own from scratch but at least try the recipe first.  These ingredients are relatively inexpensive.   Worcestershire  can be added for flavor.  I also like to add pork breakfast sausage to the beef.  This gets it closer to my great grandmother's recipe.

I will definitely make this again. I used a can of tomato paste instead of sauce, because that’s what I had in the pantry. My cabbage was tender after 20 min. And I paid homage to my MIL’s amazing cabbage rolls by adding about 10 oz of sauerkraut for a tangy flavor.

Cabbage, second most nutritious food Nature provides!  This is a wonderful recipe.  It's filling, warm, comforting, and yummy.  
I used Tabasco salt and garlic pepper, and only one pound of meat.  Served two with seconds and still filled a 1/2 gallon ice cream container.  It was so good I took a sample to a friend that same night because she absolutely had to taste it right away.  Next time will add carrot coins for color and texture, but otherwise perfect.

Delicious! We substituted group beef for ground turkey and added low sodium chicken broth for water. We omitted the rice to be a bit healthier. Next time we make it, we're going to add some more spice!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and very much tasted like cabbage rolls but without all the work. I did make just a few modifications. I used ground turkey instead of beef  and replaced the water with beef broth to flavor the turkey up. I also doubled the garlic. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes to add just a tad more flavor. I happened to have a red bell pepper in the fridge so I diced that up and threw it in.

I usually like rice in my cabbage rolls so I  1 cup made brown rice in the instapot and stirred it in with the finished pot and it absorbed all the extra broth to create an amazing thick stew

Tons of leftovers and even better the next day. Great with sour cream on the side.

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical before and right after making this dish. But after a taste, I'm a believer! It's weird but the chopped cabbage kind of makes the dish seem like lasagna but with way less fat and carbs. My husband, who can be picky if something is too bland, liked it after adding a dash of Cholula Hot Sauce. I added a sprinkle of smoked paprika to my serving for a neat taste. I also used 95% lean beef to further reduce fat. We'll definitely make this again!

Very easy recipe and great for our low carb lifestyle.  I did add some low carb brown sugar.  Makes a lot of food so we have leftovers which are very good warmed up.

This was incredibly easy to make and it was spot-on flavorful!! I found that people who are not fans of cabbage love this dish. I made some tweaks after a couple of trials: —add 1 packet of soy sauce or 1-2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce. —squirt 2 rounds of ketchup instead of 8-oz tomato sauce can if less tomato taste is desired, especially since about 30oz of canned chopped tomatoes were already added. —add Mrs. Dash before the long simmer. —May use ground turkey instead of beef for much less fat and still flavorful!

made it as described but halved the recipe. easy and yummy weeknight one pan meal.  I see many reviews served over rice or pasta and that would also taste good I think, but it is fine without extras.

Made this last night and loved it!  I did add 1 tbsp of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of vinegar and a splash of Worcestershire. Not sure if I even added enough to make a difference, but turned out great! I will note that you have to like cabbage rolls in order to like this!  I know that seems to be a given, but my hubby wasn't all that impressed, but he doesn't really like cabbage rolls to begin with. :) Me and my kids thought it was great!  Looking forward to left overs. :)

It’s just hubby and I so I tried a half recipe and it just didn’t work. I ended up with a bland watery cabbage soup that neither my husband nor I enjoyed. And with the short simmering time there was a lot of the cabbage left half done. I probably goofed something. I did use the leftover as a soup starter but I think I’ll stick with my Grams cabbage rolls next time. But thank you for sharing.

I wanted more ingredients.. rated a 3 * as is,  But I added some garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and 1 cup rice. Also had to add more water and an extra can of sauce to make up for the rice being in there. My family liked it. I told them they were having stuffed cabbage, only I'd cut it up for them... that is what it looked like too. I will make it again but with my changes.

Kept same ingredients but added a bit more salt and let it simmer closer to 45 mins. My husband loved it so much he sent me a text while I was shopping, just to compliment it.

I have made this exactly as the recipe stated. my whole family loves it. This also freezes very well to take to work for a quick lunch. I have also changed it by using ground turkey and purple cabbage. I personally like the purple but this is an excellent recipe as is.

I'm so happy to have stumbled upon this recipe (after some trouble with stuffed cabbage rolls) and I have to tell, I get requests for this ALL the time. I also include V8 and tomato sauce together and sometimes use ground turkey. Also goes great with a side of sweet cornbread! I make this quite often now, thank you!

This is a great “little Tuesday night meal”.  It makes a BIG pot, so there are plenty of leftovers and freeze well.

I serve it with warm dinner rolls, and it makes a very satisfying meal.

I usually read the recipe then read the top reviews and make whatever changes are recommended. The recipe sounded pretty good to me and the top rated review said the same. So I made it as written and...it was so good! I’ve made it several times and it remains a hit at my house. It’s a great low carb alternative to goulash in my opinion.

So easy to make and good comfort food.  I used 3 cans of diced tomatoes instead of 2 and tomato sauce.  Will make this one part of the regular rotation.

Yum!  I DID make two small modifications.  One note, the video says use seasoned tomatoes, so I used the fire ones.  1st. modification - I used tomato soup instead of water.  2nd modification - it had a strong raw tomato flavor, so I added two Tbls sugar.  

I am now wondering if the raw tomato flavor came from the soup...if I hadn't added the soup, maybe I wouldn't have needed the sugar.   

That said, it was YUMMY.  I want to try again without my changes.  Loved it and pretty low Weight Watchers points.

Quicker & easier than making my traditional cabbage roll recipe with similar taste (except no rice)  & my husband and kids liked it better.  I followed the recipe exactly but found the end result to be a bit bland... so I added 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp Mrs Dash & 2 dashes Worcestershire sauce, then simmered another 15 min.  It was so good my husband, 13 yr old daughter & 16 yr old son all had seconds & said I should definitely make it again!

I love this recipe. First time I made with beef, second time I made with 1 lb ground turkey breast and 1 lb ground turkey. Just as incredible. I am curious if you can make with red cabbage- would it turn out just as good?

My dad just got out of the hospital and I was trying to find something good and different for him.  I had a head of cabbage and found this recipe.  Sorry but Wow..don't know what I did wrong..followed exactly.  I cut the cabbage into very small pieces  but very bland, cabbage undercooked...he had a couple of bites and said it needed more flavor and cabbage wasn't done. I cooked and then simmered it for an additional 10 mins.  May be a good base but not sure how to change it without adding several more spices??

Loved your idea, used it to use up leftover corned beef and cabbage. I had over cooked it so it was quite dry, with the tomato sauce, tomatoes and additional spices it was yummy. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a quick, fun, and easy recipe to make when you don't want to deal with cabbage leaves that tear too easily.  Tear away!!!  I don't bother with as much onion unless I have my chopper, and I like to add a little extra garlic, but this is to be a regular on my table, I think!

The only change that I made was cooking it in the slow cooker.  I put it on low for about ten hours, and it turned out great.  An easy recipe turned way easier! I would definitely recommend this, and I will be making it again.

One word Delicious:) I seasoned my ground meat with steak seasoning. I used fired roasted tomatoes for a nice kick. I also added cayenne pepper for spice. I used chicken broth instead of water. My kids enjoyed it, my husband had it for breakfast the next day. No leftovers here..lol

My grandmother was Hungarian, and her stuffed cabbage rolls were so good!   I added a teaspoon of paprika to this recipe, a cup of water, a cup of white rice and wait for it...a tablespoon of Heinz ketchup to add a touch of sweetness instead of adding sugar to bring the acid down.  So delicious, the whole family loved it!

This is a cold weather favorite at our house.  I make pretty much as written with the addition of some sugar, vinegar, and red pepper flakes.  Simple, and comforting but not high carb.

I made this with more than an ounce of skepticism,  but it is now one of my favorite dinners. 

The ease in making it adds to its appeal, however, keeping prtion sizes reasonable is not. It's impossible to not overeat, because its that good.

Used twice the amount of tomato sauce (16oz) and 1.5 cups of water to make this into a stew. I also simmered for one hour.

Super yummy and simple.
I also used tomato paste with water instead of tomato sauce and I used beef broth instead of water. I made mine more like stuffed cabbage soup... Adding extra broth. I cooked rice on the side and added it per bowl.
Regardless, super yummy and great for winter!!!

This is so much easier and just as tasty (or even better) than stuffed cabbage.  I do like to add a splash of Worcestershire, but it's not necessary.  I serve this over rice.

First let me say this was an excellent base recipe. After reading the reviews so many of which said this  recipe was bland.  My rating here is on the original recipe not how it was served.  I'll summarize some of the  changes / additions I made, and once I get everything written down I'll submit a second version to this site.  Additions, etc.:  Spicy hot Italian Sausage, 2 lrg sweet onions, whole green bell pepper, 1/2 red bell pepper, Worcestershire sauce, Teriyaki sauce, 4 oz can of sliced water chestnuts, subbed diced tomatoes and tomato sauce for lrg can of  crushed tomatoes, 1/2 C beef broth, 1/2 C white wine, and approx. 3/4 C long grain rice.  There were a few others as well, and when I send in this version, I'll have everything included.  ( My 91 yr old Dad is already excited to get his 1 qt container! )

I have made this several times. The first time I made it exactly as recipe states. The second time I made it using ground Italian sausage. Since then I have made it mostly using the sausage. It gives it extra flavor than the beef. I love this dish. It is perfect for my low-carb diet also. Win, Win in my book.
Adding a few splashes of hot sauce to my dish tops it off perfectly.
Adding a few splashes of hot sauce to your dish tops it off nicely too.

It took me a while to notice the critical missing ingredient.  2 cups cooked rice.  So I added it at the last moment before final cooking.

After I saw kimbec's comments, I followed the recipe exactly.   We had this last night with a small salad and cornbread.  Came out delicious (I love cabbage) but a little underflavored.  Next time (and yes, there will be a next time), I will follow up on some of the other reviewers' comments - more salt and pepper, more garlic, add sweet paprika, add spicy roasted diced tomatoes, serve it with rice and have sour cream on the side.

My picky family went back for seconds and said I could make it again, Woo Hoo!!  I made very few changes, due to what I had on hand, but feel it is representative of the base recipe.  I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef,and sized down to 1/2 head of green cabbage.  The 2 cans of diced tomatoes used were fire-roasted as per another reviewer and I added a half cup of jasmine white rice and 1 can of beef broth to compensate for adding the rice to the pot instead of cooking it separately, which cut out an extra step.  We all enjoyed the meal, served with cornbread.  Next time I might add a small to medium  can of V-8 juice to add a little more liquid to the serving bowl.  Delish.

You NEED to make this!! It's delicious! And anything you can cook that's all in 1 pot is tops on my list. I suggest going with the recommendation of using stock in place of the water for added flavor. I used beef broth instead of chicken since it's a beef based recipe. It was SO yummy! It makes A LOT so be sure to have company over or be prepared for leftovers. It's even better the 2nd day. Cabbage rolls are one of my favorite dishes but they are so much work. This has all the deliciousness of the dish without all the hassle. We served it over rice pilaf. It was so good we wanted to lick our plates clean.

such a great way to have the taste of cabbage rolls without all the prep.  super easy to prepare on a weeknight, and ultra-quick.  only thing i did differently was to add a bit of plain white rice to it.  great for leftovers, as it tasted even better the next day.  thanks for this!  will make again.

I had extra cabbage from my garden and was trying to find a way to use it up.  I found this recipe and it's fabulous.  I used fire-roasted tomatoes and served it over rice.  It will go into regular rotation at my house!

Awesome recipe! This makes such a great quick meal. Very seldom do I have leftovers when I make this dish, and I've made it many times since finding this recipe. Sometimes I don't have two pounds of meat and the recipe works well with only one pound. I usually substitute organic ground turkey for the hamburger, and that works great, too. I've personally not made other changes (such as spices) to the original recipe. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this tonite and it was delicious. The only thing I did was add onion salt and garlic salt along with the minced garlic. Served it with corn bread and creamy cucumbers. I will definitely make it again. I also used fire roasted tomatoes.

Love, love, LOVE this stuff & I make it often. I usually add rice & beef broth instead of water.. Also, I like to add carrots to it, as they add a bit of sweetness & crunch. Overall, it's a very forgiving recipe that is easily adaptable. I almost always serve it with cornbread. Even my grandkids (picky eaters) will gobble this up!

The ONLY time I've ever eaten cooked cabbage is in vegetable soup.  I remember pretend-barfing when my mom put stuffed cabbage rolls on the dinner table when I was growing up.  I'm trying a sugar free, grain free diet and my previous diet was completely chocolate, pizza and pasta.  This was a stretch for me and my unsophisticated palate.  However, I liked all of the ingredients and had them all on hand, so I gave it a shot.  I LOVED THIS.  I made the recipe exactly the way it was listed.  I ate three helpings.  I will make this again and again, exactly the way I made it today.  I'll give the most-valuable ingredient award to the garlic.  It made all the difference, without showing off.

This recipe is a fine basic recipe, and I love the dutch oven aspect, so fast & practical. But it needed more flavor for our tastes, so I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. I only had 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef, so I sliced a half ring of beef kielbasa, fried it and added to the mix. Added a half cup of instant brown rice w/equal part beef broth, also a half cup of chili sauce (always a winner) and a little less than 1/4 cup of vinegar plus a couple tablespoons brown sugar. Didn't have any fresh garlic so I sprinkled generously with garlic powder. Seasoned to taste with basil, sage, oregano, thyme, marjoram & 1 tsp caraway seeds. Although I had used a large chopped onion, it needed more so I added 2 tablespoons dried onion flakes. 

When the cabbage was just tender I scooped half of the mixture into a greased 9x13 glass dish & sprinkled a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over, before adding the other half. I covered the dish and baked about 15 minutes -- removed cover, topped with another sprinkling of shredded mozzarella & baked until the cheese melted (about 10 minutes. Removed & let stand 10 minutes to set for easy serving. Served with garlic toast and salad. This dish was nothing short of  AWESOME! DH moaned through 2 big helpings. Left overs were even better. Highly recommend. Thanks! :)

I found this recipe about 6 weeks ago and we have made it 5 times since then. So easy and delicious.  We like it best cooked a little longer so thr cabbage is soft and served over rice. Thank you for sharing it.

Good but if you change the ground beef to Linked sausage and cook the cabbage in that it is amazing.  don't drain the juice from the sausage, only one can of tomatoes - I used rotel, and don't add water it is even better.

Hubs loves cabbage, so I decided to try this, making half the recipe.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I did change it just a little.  I browned the ground beef and removed it to drain on paper towels.  While it was draining, I sautéed the onions, along with some green pepper that needed to be used, and added the garlic towards the end of sauteeing.  I deglazed the pan with the tomatoes, tomato sauce and water and added back the browned ground beef.  I added the salt and pepper, some Italian seasoning, and combined everything well.  I then added the cabbage on top, covered the pot and simmered for thirty minutes, stirring to incorporate the cabbage about every ten minutes.  After simmering I added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the liquid in the bottom of the pot.  I served this over rice along with a dollop of sour cream on top.  We both thought this was very tasty, not to mention filling.  This makes a lot, so we have a good amount leftover for lunches.  It’s also quick and easy which is another plus.  We’ll definitely do this one again.

This was an excellent comfort food meal. The only tiny change I made was to not add the oil to the ground beef/onion mixture. Never do, I just don't see the need. Husband loved it, ate two large helpings. The only negative is I really want homemade bread slathered with butter to go with it!

This was delicious!!!!  I haven't had traditional Polish stuffed cabbage since my mom died 18 years ago.  Have always been afraid to make it myself for fear of messing it up.  This way is so easy.  As the other reviews suggested, I added tomato paste instead of sauce and beef broth instead of water.  I also added cooked rice after it was done and a little red pepper flakes.  My husband and teenager loved it too.  Will be making again, soon, very soon.

Excellent. My husband likes stuffed cabbage, but the sweet and sour version. I don't care for it so I gave this a try instead and he loved it. I read others' reviews and so I tweaked mine a bit also. I didn't have tomato sauce and used 3 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic, omitting the garlic in the recipe. Also, I didn't have beef broth, so I added an envelope of Lipton's onion soup which added a bit more depth. (Skipped the extra salt and pepper) Made brown rice on the side. Great recipe, easy to make and makes a ton, for 2 people anyway.

I love stuffed garbage, hate to make them.  This recipe is  the answer. i cook for one so I got the ingredients for 3 servings, I did add rice, and didn' know what to do with the extra tomato sauce, so I put it all in.  It turned out great, and I have at least three more meals waiting for me.  All good! It was and will be again, and again without having to cook.

Delicious! I cooked the beef (only 1.3lbs, not 2) and onion with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder then set aside. I then cooked the cabbage and garlic with with olive oil and fennel until softened. Added the meat, onions back in, combined other ingredients and simmered. Added hot pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. No additional sugar like others have suggested and ate as is, no rice to avoid carbs. My skeptical hubby loved it as much as I did!

Made as directed with the exception of only 1b ground beef - it's all I had.  My family loved it! Was a hit especially with the hubby who loves cabbage rolls.  Will make again.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks so much.

This is really good and if you use lean ground beef, it's pretty healthy. I've made it several times following the recipe to the letter but now I replace the water with beef broth and as a matter of fact, I add additional broth to make it more soupy. I also add a few red pepper flakes because I like it with a little heat. Great with a piece of cornbread.

Ok so changing the recipe a little and rating it may annoy people. Sorry for that. I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of just plain. I also added a little basil, rosemary, thyme, and paprika. Came out great. And I am a horrible cook!

This recipe is delicious and made the house smell wonderful!!!  Followed the recipe as written with two minor changes.  I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of stewed tomatoes and I substituted the water with low sodium beef broth.  It took a bit longer than 30 min simmer time listed, closer to 45-50 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe as stated but I did also try to add to the flavor. I took reviewers advice and added 1/8cup vinegar and a TB sugar to the tomato mixture and a TON  of spices! My husband loved this and was talking  about it for the rest of the night. This probably will become part of our weekly rotation! Make this as stated and serve on a bed of rice!

Love this recipe! So easy and everyone in the family likes it.  Instead of doing this in a pot I have been browning the meat and onion (personally I think ground turkey works better in this recipe) and loading it all into the crock pot.  My cabbage never seemed to get as tender as I'd like in a pot, cooking for such a short time. If we have leftover chinese food rice that gets mixed in towards the end.  I haven't tried cooking rice in with it yet,  maybe today :) Perfect dinner that could be put together in the morning or prepared and bagged a few days before and put together for a cooking "day off" :)

Super easy and super good. I followed other comments and used diced tomatoes with mild green chills and added a can of tomato paste along with a couple dashes of vinegar and worchestershire sauce.

Excellent!!! I reduced the ground beef to 1 lb and substituted ground turkey instead. I mixed-in precooked brown rice at the end to make it a one-dish meal.

I Love this stuff...I have made it for my family and for the elderly couple I used to take care of and everyone likes it! I do modify this by instead of using tomato sauce I just use the diced or stewed tomatoes with their juices and add a little tomato paste...I also make it early in the day and put it in the crock pot to cook all day and just add water if needed...also when I make it at home I decrease or totally leave out the onion, my husband doesn't like onion, but I prefer it with. Either way this recipe is still delicious!

Brilliant idea! I had a craving for stuffed cabbage but was severely lacking the motivation to make them. I had all the ingredients on hand and  added Italian herbs, garlic, a pinch of nutmeg, a dash or two of smoked paprika, and  a hand full of rice. Came out good in a quarter of the time.

I love this dish and make it frequently. I add one can of Rotel tomatoes and 1/2 cup of brown rice. Sometimes, I also add a few dashes of Sriracha. Easy, quick and the leftovers are great!

Very good.  I followed some advice of other cooks.  I replaced the water with beef broth.  Added 1 cup of dry white rice and 1 1/2 additional cups of beef broth. Added more salt and pepper.  I used tomatoes with chiles.  Nice dish.  Next time I will try adding fennel seed and or corriander.  A touch sweet.  Might add a little vinegar next time, too.

Easy and delicious.  Used ground turkey instead of beef to cut fat.  Also based on other reviews added a dash of nutmeg and a few splashes of Worcestershire.  Served it over brown rice.  It was fantastic.

Based on what I read in other reviews about the recipe coming out bland, I decided to use mild Italian sausage in place of the ground beef.

I chopped fresh tomatoes because I had a bunch that needed to be used.  I also threw in a very small handful of egg noodles, but there was so little and cooked down enough that you couldn't really even tell it was in there.  Since it was tossed in purely as an attempt to trick a picky 4 year old into eating cabbage, the addition was largely unnecessary. 

Anyway, it was a huge hit and I will be making it again. The kiddo chowed down more than the adults. 

Thank you for sharing!

Only difference  I did was I did add some instant rice and a couple teaspoons of white sugar and same amount of apple cider vinegar to make it taste more like my regular cabbage rolls.  I  love this and its so much easier than trying to steam cabbage and roll it with my arthritis in my fingers and hands. Thanks to all who contributed ideas on this It is a marvelous dish!!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times. I do add a few things based on taste preference. 
If you're looking to add some spices I highly suggest adding caraway seeds (1 TB or so). I also add bay leaves & a few dashes of allspice as well. 
Tomato soup in place of sauce & add worschestershire & ACV.
I increase the liquid (chicken broth in place of water) to 1.5 cups & add 1/2 cup of basmati. 
I just let it simmer away ;)
Don't hate on my additions. I didn't change the recipe, just added 'stuff'. 
I like to read review where folks have added different seasonings. I'm secretly in love with my spice cupboard ;)

This recipe is very easy & good. A small head of cabbage makes a LOT so be ready! I will make this again, but next time I'm going add the cooked ground beef at the end so it doesn't boil with the cabbage; I just felt like that was too long. Don't be afraid to experiment with your spices to make it to your liking. Enjoy!

Loved this!  It was simple and quick and yummy!  When I make it again, I might use turkey instead of ground beef and maybe add some red pepper flakes for some heat, but really, the recipe is perfect as is.

Loved it! I cooked the beef and onions on the stove, then threw everything in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours. I added some chili pepper flakes as well. It was delicious, and makes a huge amount of food. I may try adding rice next time to give it a bit more consistency.

Used chicken broth instead of water (didn't have beef).  Would make this again. My adult son drizzled his with balsamic vinegar and then had seconds.

Great recipe.  Very healthy.  I do add more tomato sauce.  I use the entire 12 oz can not just 8.  I've made several times.  Swapped one pound or burger for sausage, turkey or pork, also good.

Made as stated, and had high hopes because I love cabbage, and a friend on Facebook posted this recipe and said it was great.  It wasn't anything special for me. It's edible and filling, but nothing I would look forward to, but not making it again so no worries about that. I don't think I cared for the tomato sauce taste with cabbage…I usually have cabbage with potatoes, or made with chicken stock.  It makes a HUGE amount.

I liked it, I used v8 juice instead of tomato sauce and cooked in the slow cooker. I would add rice or potatoes to make it complete. Other than that I would make again!

Very good and healthy recipe as it stands - try ground turkey to lighten it a bit. I also like a bit more tomato sauce. Also a Tablespoon of red wine vinegar and a Tablespoon or two of brown sugar richens the sauce. Want a bit of exotic flavor? Add 2 whole cloves while simmering, then remove when serving.

I have made this several times and we love it.  I use 1 lb of hamburger instead of the 2 it calls for and it is plenty of meat.  I also use 1 can of RoTel tomatoes for a little extra spice. Great for cold winter nights!

I added instant rice cooked in beef or chicken stock to make it a complete meal that needs nothing on the side.  Delicious. Thanks for sharing!

This has become one of my all time favorite dinners to make.  Of course, I have added a few changes to the base recipe (Some of which came from other's reviews).  I use half ground turkey and half hot Italian sausage (Need to try hot Turkey sausage).  I replace some of the water with balsamic vinegar.  I throw some Siracha or tobassco sauce in there.  I cube up a bunch of mushrooms and add them as well.  A few tablespoons of brown sugar.  I use tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Garlic is your friend.  Been meaning to put some chopped up kale in to see what that's like.  I think some chopped red bell pepper could work nicely as well.  I cook it for at least an hour, if not an hour and a half.  I'll then spoon it over a small bed of brown rice.  Oh man, this stuff is gooooood!

I made it as described (except substituting ground turkey for the beef, as I don't eat red meat), and found it watery and not that flavorful. So, I added 3 more cloves of lightly sauteed garlic, 1 tbs dried oregano, 1 tbs dried basil, a dash of ground red pepper, and 1 can of tomato paste, and let it simmer again. DELICIOUS! I was reheating it to eat for breakfast it was so good.

This was really good but needed a lot of tweaking. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used tomato  soup, a bit of sauce, seasoned diced tomatoes, and added extra water. I added a cup of brown rice and beef broth.  Because I used ground turkey I used more spices. I'm Polish so I added vinegar, brown sugar, and caraway seeds to be more like my cabbage rolls. My cabbage wasn't fully done after the suggested cooking time so I cooked for another half hour. I think next time I will use less meat though, because this made a ton. Hopefully it freezes well.

This is a great recipe and one we make on a regular basis.  We use ground turkey for a healthier version but otherwise this is great!

I made this for 2 people that absolutely detest cabbage.  I didn't tell them what it was before they started eating. They totally didn't believe me when I told them. It is SOOOO good.

I made this and was hesitant about the amount of salt and pepper so I didn't add anywhere near as much as it called for. After making it, I decided it needed the amount of S&P it had called for. It was a bit bland, though, so I added 1/4 c. of ketchup, 1 c. instant rice, and 2 c. water and let it simmer for 30 minutes more. I will make this again and again!

This is a keeper for us. I followed reviewers' suggestions by stir frying the cabbage alone first and by adding a tbsp sugar, 1/8 cup white but vinegar, a little paprika and red pepper flakes.  Then, I added hot sauce to my own bowl, because I like it hot!

5-star with changes:

I used this recipe as my base for our dinner and I made a lot on purpose so I could freeze the leftovers. I used 2 lbs of ground beef, 2 heads of cabbage, 3 diced large sweet yellow onions, 6 diced cloves of garlic, 3 6-oz Kirkland organic Roma tomato paste, 3 cans of Kirkland organic Roma stewed tomatoes, 3 cups of beef broth (beef base mixed with water), Kirkland organic no-salt seasoning to taste, McCormick taco seasoning, butter, Apple cider vinegar to taste, salt and pepper to taste, onion and garlic powder to taste. I chopped up the cabbage as finely as I could and cooked it down on the range in a tbsp of butter per head of cabbage until the cabbage was a translucent yellow. I sautéed the onions and garlic, browned the meat in taco seasonings, splashed some apple cider vinegar into the sauce and added everything together in the crockpot where I let it simmer on low for 4 hours to completely soften the cabbage. I have an 8-qt crock pot and this will yield SEVERAL meals focus. The flavor is incredible.

Pretty much made as instructed.  Used beef broth instead of water, then cooked quick brown rice seperately and mixed it in.  Didn't have tomato sauce, so ran canned whole peeled tomatoes through the blender before adding, Added a touch of shredded cheddar before eating...yum.  Best unrolled cabbage roll recipe that I've tried.

This is in the final stages of simmering as I write this. I did adapt this slightly, but the end product is really tasty.  I used beef stock rather than the water, a couple of beef bullion cubes, and a small amount of ground cumin and cayenne pepper for a little zing. The recipe is great as it stands, we just like a little more intense flavor. The added rice and water sound good,too, but I am limiting carbs right now...still yum!

Unstuffed Cabbage Roll Haiku: "Simple and yummy, ate with buttered egg noodles. Added just a bit." Made as directed only adding 1 tsp. Worcestshire, and 2 tsp. brown sugar. Comforting, filling, and with lots of leftovers for the next day, great!

This was delicious. It was lacking a little of flavor that I expected from an unstuffed cabbage roll, so the second time I made it I made a few changes that I had read in other reviews and that did seem to help. I liked it better using the beef broth instead of water and I added a can of sauerkraut drained. I put in a little brown sugar and let it simmer twice as long as the recipe called. I did think the recipe was a good base and easy to add things to suit your own tastes. This is a recipe worth a try!

I didn't have diced tomatoes or tomato paste, so I used rotel and grape tomatoes that I puréed in a blender.   I seasoned with Tony Chachere's to give it a little kick and more salt and pepper.  I also sautéed bell pepper and celery with the onions and garlic, then added the meat to brown.

My kids all love this! I add 1c rice and the extra water like others have mentioned. Also, instead of regular diced tomatoes, I use ITALIAN DICED TOMATOES. It has basil etc in it and this adds the extra flavor that people are looking for :)

I loved that this recipe was so easy to make and so yummy!!  I made it with 2 pounds of lean ground turkey to cut down on fat and calories and I also added red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  My fiancé and I both really enjoyed this meal!!

We really enjoyed this recipe . We served with basmati rice and added the leftover rice to it to absorb some of the liquid . We will make again. Second time I made I added 1 tsp grated ginger root, chicken instead of beef. Served with ramen noodles

My husband looked over at me and said "wow, this tastes just like stuffed cabbage" I responded "yes, without all the work". We used the dutch oven which worked great since we let it simmer for a little over an hour to let the cabbage soften and it heated perfectly. As another reviewer pointed out, adding some tomato soup adds a nice sweetness, we only needed a half can. Worcestershire and paprika are a must also, it adds depth to the taste which is a bit lacking without it.

I love cabbage rolls but don't like the time it takes to make them. This recipe makes it a breeze! I did add 3/4 c brown rice, 1 1/2 c water, and 1/4 c brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers. I sometimes add Quinoa instead of brown rice.

I loved this recipe but made a few adjustments to it, I add 3/4 cup brown rice and 1 1/2 cups of water, I also added 1 can stewed tomatoes and 1 can diced tomatoes along with the tomato sauce. It was delish and I am having it again tonight.!

These additions brought raves in my house:1)I used turkey, cooked in a little olive oil 2)added, besides the onion & 2 garlics, 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 3) one can of tomato soup 4) 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 5)2 teaspoons sugar 6)1/4 teaspoon curry powder 7)1/8 teaspoon celery seed 8)1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 9)1 bay leaf 10) black pepper to taste 11)dash of cayenne pepper 12) the chopped cabbage, 13) 2 shakes of poultry seasoning, and NO water. I put this with some hot cooked Rice. It was fantastic, if I do say so myself! Husband said he wasn't hungry, then said, "Well I didn't know it was THIS good!"

We love it!  Have added some red pepper flakes for heat and mushrooms that were on sale that day.  Really added some nice texture.  I am thinking of adding black beans one time as well with some cumin.  We don't use water we use beef stock and the flavor is much much better!

If you are a beginner, this recipe is just great so follow it and you will have a delicious dish to serve your family.  However, some of us are experienced to expert cooks/chefs and are skilled enough to make changes.  I made this to feed my hungry men on my repair team so I beefed it up with brown rice....there are many recipes for this including one that uses raw rice that cooks in the caserole...however, I like to partially cook the brown rice and add it so it still soaks up some of the tomato juice.......if your family likes stuffed cabbage, they will like this....

I made this but accidentally used twice the amount of diced tomatoes...still tasted great!  Had it over rice on the first night, and then over pasta the next..both were great.  Definitely had more flavour the second day.

I was a bit skeptical because of it's simplicity, but I'm very glad I tried it.  It's really good and filling.  For my second round, I decided to add a dab of sour cream to it, and that was really good too

I love these kind of meals. Easy to make and delicious. It was better 3 days later than the night I made it. This will be a good go to dish when you need something hearty and quick. Comfort food for sure.

The dish was quick, easy to make and delicious.  I used fire roasted tomatoes and added a teaspoon of Better than Bouillion roasted beef flavor for more of a kick.  I am putting it in my recipe rotation.

Made this as is and it was great, but we like spice so I added a bit of red pepper flakes at the end which made it better. Will have to try Rotel or fire roasted tomatoes next time as recommended by other reviewers. It’s a great recipe as it and we’re excited to try it with minor alteration for our taste.

Even better as leftovers. I've added apple cider vinegar to the water, as someone suggested. Delish dish. I make this over and over, yearly, so I thought I would leave a comment.

I really liked this recipe and added an 8 oz can of tomato paste, a few splashes of Worcester sauce, a 15 oz can of sauce and water. Hearty, low carb and full of flavor. Will definitely make again and again.

This was a good base- I've cooked enough now to know that, based on my family's preferences, I would need to add lots of spices to this recipe.  What I appreciated was having the basic steps laid out (cook time, order of ingredients, etc), because I don't sauté cabbage often enough to feel comfortable "winging it."  

We liked it, with the allspice, paprika, caraway seed, and vinegar I added, and I would make it again.

I made this recipe with Quorn's meatless grounds instead of ground beef. I was going to use mushrooms for a meaty texture, but found the meatless grounds. Flavor worked well with the grounds. Not a big tomato fan but enjoyed this new take of cabbage and tomatoes.

Very good but I would (1) reduce the salt to 1 tsp and (2) I would cook it for one hour (to get the cabbage a bit more tender). Overall it was really good.

This is the second time I made this. I thought maybe the first time I messed it up, and have been wanting to try again. There is something - I dont know what - glaringly missing. The whole family said repeatedly, "Something's missing." I really feel like this would be 5 stars if I could figure out what. I want to say it needs something sour, like maybe pickling the cabbage first. I really wish I could figure it out!

As the recipe goes, it was fine, a bit bland for my 50 years of cooking experience. I learned a very long time ago that ground beef needs help  no matter what you are using it for. Often times I use beef bouillon and that was how I gave this dish the depth of flavor it was lacking. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written and we love it. PS For those who think they need to cook cabbage a long time to wilt, try soaking in a warm salt water bath for 10 minutes bf adding to pot.

It was really good overall, maybe a smidge bland. With a little more salt it was good. We served it Over quinoa and with roasted sweet potatoes and Jiffy mix muffins on the side, a really nice and simple full meal.

Great dish that's easy to make - not all the mess and work that cabbage rolls take yet the same great flavor! I added a can of tomato paste and Italian seasoning, and used celery salt instead of sea salt.

I was excited to try this recipe because I enjoy stuffed cabbage but this time wanted to cut down on prep.  
while it is an easy recipe I found it to lack flavor. i followed the recipe exactly & both hubby and I came to same conclusion. flavor is mute. but it is a great starter recipe.

So this tasted like a typical stuffed cabbage recipe which I appreciate. What sets this apart is the simplicity in making. Its awesome to just chop it all up rather than steaming and rolling etc.  Could use some extra seasoning love but definitely a keeper.

Sorry, but this was virtually flavor-free. I doubled garlic, doubled tomato sauce & used stewed tomatoes. We still had to add Worcestershire sauce at the table, but that didn't help much. Will not make this again.

Yum! My husband loved this dish! Flavor is great! I did make a couple of adjustments: as another reviewer suggested, I added 3/4 cup brown rice and an extra 1 1/2 cups of water and simmered for about an hour and a half. I also about tripled the garlic, and added a bit of parsley and Mrs. Dash. My only negative is that it doesn’t look very appealing, but that’s not something that really matters to this family ;) I can’t wait to give this a go in my crock pot!

Made this with red cabbage. Used fire roasted diced tomatoes and instead of using 2 lbs hamburger, I used 1lb hamburger and 1 lb Italian sausage. The entire family lived it, including my niece who doesn't like cabbage. Needless to say there was none left over

I don't usually like cabbage, but this is fantastic.  I have made it several times now.  I went easy on the salt just because my husband and I have high blood pressure and we don't use much salt, if any.

I used onion powder because of allergies to cooked onions, and garlic powder because I didn’t have any garlic cloves. I added Uncle Ben’s Brown Ready Rice™ per another review. The family loved it, abd all leftovers were gone a day later. Definitely a keeper.

This was a great way to use up the leftover stuffing I had frozen for cabbage rolls. I served it over rice.

This dish was super easy to make and delish!  I substituted ground turkey instead of ground beef and used chicken broth instead of plain water.  I had leftovers and had some for lunch over half a sweet potato, and it tasted like Thanksgiving!
I will definitely be making this again soon.

Delicious. Made as described. Decided to add a bit of Penzies Pico & Salsa as it tasted a bit too bland for my family that likes spice. Daughter recommends that it be served over rice.

Excellent.  I added a cup of basmati rice and increased the tomato sauce to a 24 oz can, also adding an additional 1 1/2 cups water.  I think the quantity of cabbage was a touch light, and it could have handled another onion--but those are easy fixes.  I will definitely make this again.

Turned out great! In order to add more flavor, I added spices (cumin, hot chili powder, fresh basil, garlic powder, kosher salt) to our family’s liking, substituted Swanson’s beef stock for the water in the recipe, and added a 4 oz can of mild diced green chiles.

I like my food well on the spicy side, so I switched Rotel's tomatoes with Habaneros. If the Habameros are too much, the green chiles are a milder choice. Sometimes they are a bit much for me too, but I am a glutton for punishment. Getting ready to start some right now.

I am always looking for dinner ideas. I don’t like to cook and never had.  It’s hard for me to think about dinner at 4 am.  I saw this and thought I’d try it. I had everything I needed on hand so that made it easier for me. My husband is a very picky eater & doesn’t like most of what I make. This was wonderful!,  I did add some brown sugar which was the only alteration I made. It was so easy to make. I had quite a bit left over so I froze it. I will definitely make this again.

Easy, quick and good.  I left the cabbage in large chunks and it was still somewhat crisp, as I prefer.  I also used low sodium beef stock instead of water.  
I added extra garlic, a touch of Worcestershire, and the juice of a lemon at the end.  Halved the recipe, served with brown rice from the Instant Pot, it was plenty for 4 large servings.  Will use this recipe again.

My 11 year old has started cooking with me, and she picked this recipe! My husband doesn't like cabbage, but loved this! I made it with veggies and cornbread like another reviewer mentioned and it was delicious! It makes quite a bit, so we are lucky enough to have leftovers! I bet this is the kind of dinner that is even better than next day!

Bland and not appealing to my eye.  I made it precisely as written but ended up turning it into chili by adding frozen corn, black beans, cumin, paprika and chili powder. Glad others enjoyed it - wish we had.

It was a little bland so I added  paprika, red chili flakes and some hot sauce. Let the flavors marinate over night and froze.
The next week, I added another 1/2 head of very rough chopped  cabbage to balance out the extra liquid.

I tend to like ground beef/tomato type dishes so I figured this recipe would be at least OK; I was surprised at just how much my husband and I both liked it.  I've made it two ways now, both times serving it over rice:  1) added 2 tsp paprika, reduced pepper to 1/2 tsp, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  This version was my favorite.  2) with the above changes plus I added 2 tblsp each of vinegar and sugar.  My husband liked this version better, although he thought the other version was OK too.  The 4-star rating is based on making the dish with the above changes.  Note:  when I first added the salt, it tasted pretty salty, but after I added the cabbage it was fine.

Followed directions, except all I had was ground turkey. It was a little bland, next time I will add some more spices. Great basic recipe. Served over rice. Filling and minimal cost dinner.

I liked the recipe. It was fairly bland, so I did add more spices and seasonings (paprika, cayenne, chili powder). Used beef broth instead of water  and added Worcestershire Sauce. Also, we like our cabbage a bit on the crunchy side, so only simmered 15 minutes after adding the cabbage. Great recipe to work from though.

I have been making this for years (too lazy to roll the cabbage leaves) I use tomato puree and add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and let it simmer for about an hour...one of my family's favorite dishes and always have enough to freeze for a quick meal when I don't feel like cooking! Don't forget the rice which this recipe here did!

This is a great one dish meal, the only thing I did different is that instead of just canned tomatoes, I used Rotel tomatoes, Chipotle flavor.  It spiced it up just enough, We will definitely make this again.  Cornbread is a nice compliment to cool down the spiciness.

5 stars for a great idea!  Like others, I hate it when people change the recipe completely then, give it a bad review.    I did make some changes though so, I'm giving the idea 5 stars for creativity and subtracted 1 star because changes were needed to the recipe.  
The rice is integral to the cabbage roll in my humble opinion, so, I added uncooked rice and increased the liquid to compensate.  I increased the salt and added pepper.  I'm not fond of sugar added to my tomato sauces so, no sugar was harmed in the making of my families dinner ;-)
I added a little basil and oregano with some lemon juice for  more flavor.  
The kids all liked it and the hubby has asked for me to serve it again next week.  No bigger compliments available in this house!

I have made this and it was so good, sent to friends and they have made it, my husband is a meat eater so I added another LB. of ground beef.

Tonight with all the corned beef on sale I am going to try it with corn beef, I had gotten this good size corn beef, I cooked the corn beef so it will be easier to get into smaller pieces, even though we use sea salt I think I'm going to skip salt since corn beef is salty anyway. 

I will let everyone know how it comes out.

This recipe was excellent. I took the advice of some reviews and added extra fresh garlic, 1/2 c brown rice and 1c beef broth for increased flavor. Otherwise followed the recipe. Family loved it.

Followed the recipe exactly and when it was all done served it over rice. I like my cabbage rolls salty so all I did was add more salt to my bowl. Great recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I swapped ground chicken for the ground beef. I have to say, I found it to be quite bland. It tastes more like a cabbage chili (minus chili powder) than a cabbage roll. It was absolutely “fine,” not hard to make, and good for a low-carb option. I am glad I tried it but probably won’t make it again.

I also made brown rice and added it.  I tried it before and after adding the rice and it really does not change the taste too much, so might as well add it to give a grain and make it go a little further.  Added 1 cup of brown rice (that is what it is measured out before cooking the rice).

I liked it.  Tried as written the first time.  Not crazy good but ok-tasted better the next day(4 star).   The second time- I played with it--only cause I wanted something cheaper (less meat more cost effective for us).  What I did and both husband and I LOVED IT  was.....1 lb  beef and cooked up 1 cup of lentils (in beef base/water), 2  onions, 1/4 cup of rice, 4 cloves of garlic instead of two and 2-3 splashes of Worcestershire sauce.      It was still ok the first night but the second night it was GREAT!!!   Served with just green beans on side - more veggie power.  Husband would have liked with cornbread.  I think this is something that would just about go with anything---or totatlly by itself--I liked it that much.     Still I do think it needed a LITTLE more salt and pepper  but other than that----MAKE THIS THE DAY AHEAD OF TIME YOU WANT TO  EAT IT.

I made a half recipe to be sure we liked it. Unfortunately, it was pretty bland. I took a note from a favorite bolognese sauce thought, and added some umami seasoning, which took it from “meh” to “omg!” I wanted to eat the whole pan! 

Changes I made (all measurements are approximate, I don’t measure anything.) 2 tbsp Tomato paste, 1/2 tsp fish sauce, 2 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp Lowery’s seasoning salt, 6 drops Stevia (or 1-2 tsp brown sugar) , and 1/4 tsp hungarian smoked paprika. Oh gosh, it was so good with those changes. I’d give it 4 stars. The original recipe was just too basic for my taste.

This was just an "ok" dinner. I made with 2 cans of tomato soup & 1 can of water & some paprika because thats what my Mom & Grandmother did when making stuffed cabbage rolls. This was not as good as cabbage rolls but a lot quicker. I would not make it again.

Quick and easy so it’s a great last minute meal. I tried it as the recipe called and then added 1 teaspoon of sugar which I felt brought out the flavour more. I will make this again.

4 stars as is. Then I tasted and decided to add 1/3 cup brown sugar, 3 tbl worchester and 2 tsp of red wine vinegar which makes it a 5. The recipe says a small cabbage, but I think a big one would be even better. I served on rice for my husband, but I loved it alone. Yum!

I added the vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, bullion,  Worcestershire sauce, tomatoe paste (instead of sauce) and a 10 oz can of beef broth(instead of water.)  This is no longer the same recipe but I wouldn't have known where to start without it!  I  like to read what others have done. Following some of the changes, it was amazing.  I added sour cream which was great. My honey ate it over rice and said this is a keeper.  Love that it's so healthy.  We will definitely have this again soon.

I am not big on cabbage but the Keto friendly heading captured my attention. I used onion flakes because my boyfriend doesn’t like onions and I omitted the garlic as i am allergic. I also used one can of diced tomatoes with jalapeños and habanero so it gave it a little kick. It was delicious! A great find that i will use in a regular basis!

Delicious!  I changed the recipe using a half pound ground beef and a can of black beans.  I added a half cup of dry rice as it was very, very watery while cooking.  An inexpensive, easy to make comfort food!

Did add 1/2 cup brown rice to keep it in line with my regular cabbage rolls. So, also added an extra 1/2 cup of water. Cooked it 45 min on stove top as the cabbage wasn’t tender enough at 30 min. Used 1 tin of diced tomatoes, 1 tin of tomato paste and 1 tin of tomato soup as I didn’t have tomato sauce.  Plus also added an icon beef cube for flavour. However, next time I will leave out the tomato paste as it was a bit too much tomato wise. I’m so pleased to have a quick alternative to rolling my own cabbage rolls!!

I have changed it. I did not use any tomatoe sauce. I used turmeric, lots of garlic, onions, cabbage, and beef sausage. It was very delicious and my husband loved it. You can add anything you like to this receipe,.

So Delicious!  I made it as written! Yummy!  I also love cabbage rolls so the next time I made it I used some of my other recipe ideas like one lb of burger and 1 lb of meatloaf/ meatball mix . I also put in a peeled and diced green apple. When it was done I poured it on cooked white rice!  So good and easy , I will never go through the hassle of the roll ups again, thank you ! Awesome recipe!

Great winter dish!  I followed other reviewers' suggetions and added the rice and a cup of water to the pot at the same time as the cabbage and let it simmer for about 45 minutes. I also added cayenne pepper for a dash of heat.

I only used one pound of ground beef and it seemed like enough to me.  A wok was the best thing that I could come up with to use so I stirred it up (mixing top with bottom) a few times and it actually took more like 45 minutes to simmer (probably because I used the wok).  I loved it...my fiancé didn't like it as much as me but appreciated the fact that it is somewhat low carb.  I did happen to have just enough chicken stock left over from a previous recipe to substitute for water...I think that may have been beneficial.

Made the recipe as is - earning a solid 4 stars. Incredibly easy to make as is. It’s a very basic flavor so felt it needed a little extra seasoning. You could really go add any type of seasoning to personalize the dish. This time, we added some red pepper chili flakes and sauerkraut. Next time, who knows!  Solid healthy recipe that provides a decent amount of food.

I love this recipe! So easy, quick, and my kids loved it. I bought my onions pre-chopped from the store on my home to cut down the prep time. (I’m a busy Mom so need quick meals) literally had this from the store to the dinner table in about an hour. Thanks for sharing!! Will definitely make again.

Very tasty. Made almost exactly as written except I used half beef half venison and also added 1/2 cup instant rice with 1 cup beef broth at the end and let simmer extra half hour-ish. Husband raved about it. Will definitely make again.

This is a good recipe as written. I made this for grown-ups with developed palettes so I did add 2 tsp. Hungarian Paprika, as was suggested in the reviews. (However, that was added half way through the simmer time and I did taste the recipe made as it was written.) I served over steamed rice with dollops of sour cream and red pepper flakes for those who like that.  Everyone liked it, even my less-than-enthusiastic cabbage eater. I will certainly make it again. Oh, I used purple cabbage and it was stunningly beautiful and rich looking. I will stick to purple cabbage for future meals of this.

This is SO much better than cabbage rolls!  You don't have to deal with cutting the cabbage in your plate, which can be unruly.  And you don't deal with getting a bite of all cabbage and no meat or vice versa..  I added rotelle and used a big can of San Marsano tomatoes.  Added thyme, basil,  coriander, worcestershire, cajun seasoning.  Everyone raved over it!  I added a cup of rice and chicken broth (2 cups)... but the rice wasn't necessary.  Easy and it was great!!! 

(to the people that don't like editing recipes... ? ?? what concern of that is it to you?  Make it like  it says= if that's what you want to do.  But I always read reviews to see how others thought to improve the recipe or to see if the recipe really turns out as they say - which they don't always!   Great cooks generally tweak recipes to achieve even better results! -adding rotelle to this recipe made a good recipe -outstanding!  And I always use San Marsano tomatos - which I learned from Rachel Ray - a unique crisp flavor).

Made this today and it was yummy.  My husband went back for 
seconds.  Used a lot of reviewers advice when make it.
I replaced the water with beef broth, added seasoning salt for salt, added worcestshire, italian seasoning, red peppers and sugar.   
I let the sauce cook for about 10 minutes before adding cabbage so I could tweak it if it needed more seasoning.  Cooked the mixture for 1 hour.  I served it on rice because I have had problems with rice cooking entirely if I add it to the mixture.

I added raisins, lemon and a bit of brown sugar so it would be more like my mother's sweet and sour cabbage rolls. I had some left over rice which I served on the side. It was delicious, and very easy.

I LOVE this recipe and make it ALL the time. I grew up eating this and I'm so happy there's a quick and easy version of the rolls I'm familiar with. I serve with rice and make it a few times a month. 

It also freezes really well. I vacuum sealed several individual portions for lunches at work and dinners when I just don't feel like cooking. Great for those windy winter nights in Montana!

GREAT DISH!! I used the chicken broth instead of water, as suggested. Also doubled the tomato sauce. Instead of salt, I used Vegeta seasoning, which adds more flavor and 50% less salt. My wife and I grew up eating stuffed cabbage and love this dish. Minus the rice normally used, this is a fantastic low-carb alternative.

I try to follow a recipe first time so I can rate based off of how it is written, but sometimes we have to substitute what we have.   I have not made stuffed cabbage for such a long time as it is too time consuming.   This was so easy in comparison.  I used fire roasted tomatoes because that is all I had in the pantry.  I also added seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  I added 1 teaspoon of paprika as I always added it to stuffed peppers.   I served it with rice and sauteed green beans.    We loved it.

Pretty good!  Much easier and faster than making piggies.....I added macaroni towards the end since I had so much 'juice'.....I also added quite a bit of S & P, (and smoked paprika)  b/c it was lacking flavor....wish I had more cabbage to add, I only had a smallish amount....that probably would've improved the flavor some.

I made this today and took a few suggestions from people's posts. I did add wild rice, I used beef broth instead of the water. I loved this recipe. It was really great and very easy to do.  I love the idea of unstuffed because as far as I am concerned the first thing people do when they eat cabbage rolls is cut them up anyway. Great recipe. Loved the suggestions

Love this recipe! It is easy to make and delicious. My husband has already asked me to make it again. I added 3 teaspoons of beef bouillon paste and used tomatoes paste instead of sauce. We like it with a thicker consistency. This will be a go-to recipe for us.

Very good starter recipe. As others mentioned, I did find it a little bland, though. Very easy to spice up at your discretion, personally I added red peppers, soy sauce, and extra salt to kick it up. I also added cooked brown and wild rice at the end to make it a full meal. Very tasty, I would definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as written, while it was cooking I read through the reviews and added a splash of  vineger and sugar, I will also add rice. It smells WONDERFUL! 

Ok this is Wonderful!! My husband says it needs more salt (I'm not big on a lot of salt) but other than that I will be making this again!  ;)

Delicious with rice or without.   The flavors marry as it sits.  Make on weekend for quick delicious midweek lunches n dinners.  Make a double batch you’ll thank me later.

I made this pretty much as directed maybe adding just a little more cabbage and garlic because I had it.  It was delicious, easy to make and my 3 childcare toddlers all loved it and ate it well.  Says a lot when you can get a toddler to eat a dish with foods mixed together!  Thank you for the recipe!  I also shared with with the childcare parents.

I made this using fresh ground (plain) pork  and used chicken broth instead of water. I added leftover yellow rice from another dinner, and per other reviewers' suggestions, added 2 Tbs brown sugar. I couldn't stop eating it. For some reason the cabbage took a way longer time to get soft so next time I will sauté it  before adding the other ingredients. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Thank you for such a great recipe. I had to substitute Ragu Spaghetti Sauce for the tomato base - none in the cupboard. I also added green pepper, & rice topped with Sauerkraut. Comfort food!

loved it.  Followed others leads and made it a one pot meal by adding rice, so needed more liquid - used beef broth to add flavor.

I found this dish a little bland for my taste buds. If I had it to do over again I would add some more spices and maybe a little Worcestershire sauce.  That might not traditionally be in cabbage rolls but I think it would add a nice flavour.  It needs more zip.  But a very nice comfort food for a cold day.

I really liked this simple, yet easy recipe.  There were some ingredients that were replaced, instead of ground beef I used turkey, and instead of tomatoe sauce I used Prego Garden Chunky sauce.  

This is definetly a keeper!

Very versatile and tasty recipe. I've made it so many ways; adding peppers, trying different kinds of meats, different spices, adding rice and beef stock .... all are good!

Perfect basic recipe where you can adapt to your preferences of spice.  It does need a fair amount of salt. I have made it as it is suggested and also by substituting the can of tomato sauce with a bottle of chili sauce.  I also have added smoked paprika and as a last minute brightener, a dash of dried lemon peel.  Definately a keeper, even for those who are not fond of cabbage.

Only had 1 can of plain diced tom- my 2nd can was garlic/olive oil; used 14oz can of sauce and at least doubled the garlic; might have been 3x (we love garlic at our house).  Served over rice boiled with chicken broth- ( it didn't need the rice- for low-carb peeps!)  I LOVED this- will make it again and again.  family and budget friendly!

I used tomato paste instead of sauce and omitted the water. Much heartier meal. The sauce and water make it more like a soup.

I enjoy this - I am too lazy to make the rolls.  Adding cooked rice is a good idea. I feel like there’s a spice that would make it more genuine, but I can’t think of what it is.

I would have given this recipe 3 stars I think without my changes because it is rather bland. I replaced one of the cans of tomatoes with a can of Rotel (spicy if I can find it). That makes it still rather basic but for those who prefer really spicy dishes we kick it up with cajun seasoning. This way we love it and it suits more in my family!

My family enjoyed this recipe very much.  During the process of making the dish, I felt it needed just a small tweak in flavor so I added a little bit of chicken stock (granular) and I thickened the sauce with a little bit of corn starch and cold water.  Fantastic served over rice!

This has become a regular star on the menu here. It is SO easy, and filling, and delicious! If I'm in a hurry, I will use a packages of coleslaw instead of shredding cabbage at home. Works out brilliantly every time! Real comfort food

It may be my mistake, but I thought this would be more of a soup. I like the flavor, but it needs more juice. I added an extra cup of water to it, but it needs more. I didn’t have more tomatoes or tomato sauce, so I didn’t want to lose flavor by adding more water.

This is a great easy recipe, It would also be a crockpot friendly meal for the family.  I agree with the publisher, my kid loved it, and he doesn't like cabbage either. The only changes I really added where a little pepper flake, white cooking wine, and I also used red cabbage along with green to make it more colorful. Definitely, would make it again. Thank you.

Made as written it needed a lot.  Second time, added 1 # zesty pork sausage, subbed 2 small tomato paste for sauce, 3 bay leaves, 10 - 12 peppercorns in cheesecloth (remove after finished cooking), 2 T W sauce, 1/8 cup of vinegar, 3 beef bouillons, omitted salt & pepper, added water as needed.  Let it simmer and you may adjust seasoning as you go.  If you taste it immediately after adding vinegar, you think it is too bitter but let it cook and the flavors marry.  It was delicious and make it frequently now.

This is definitely a winner! I changed one thing as all my cooking is low sodium or no salt. Instead of tomato sauce, I used low sodium V8 Juice (adds a little more kick to a recipe).

I will definitely be making this again.  It makes such a big batch that my large pan almost wasn't big enough.  In another pan I made beef rice-a-roni and served it over that.  I also considered serving it over cauliflower rice, as in a dish like that, I think it seem like carbs in there. I used beef broth instead of water, and fire roasted tomatoes.

It was good! I need a low sodium diet, so mine was cooked with LoSo tomato sauce & garlic flavored Mrs. Dash and pepper. A dollop of sour cream did wonders!!

Delicious! I've made this so many times I cannot count. All I change is... I add a little less than 1/4 cup of apple cidar vinegar, 2 tbsp of brown sugar, beef broth instead of water, and more salt to taste. My 7-year-old and husband and coworkers can't get enough. Every time I say I'm making it for dinner, my entire office begs for leftovers!

We don’t normally cook or serve cabbage. This was a pleasant surprise. The kids loved it! I added quartered new potatoes with an extra half cup or so of water and a bit more garlic, salt and pepper. The potatoes cooked just fine within the recipe’s normal cook time. Will definitely be adding this to our normal meal repertoire.

This is so good. I’ve made it twice now. This time I made a couple of changes.  I added a heaping teaspoon of celery seed, used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water, and finally added 3/4 of a cup of white rice.  Yum!

Easy and tasty.  Followed the directions except supplanted chicken broth will beef bouillon.   I preferred it with a large dollop or two of sour cream. Had leftover Mexican rice and served this dish right on top.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe but decided to kick it up a notch because we REALLY love spicy food. We used regular Rotel (juice & all!) for the diced tomatoes and Rao’s brand Arribiata sauce for the tomato sauce. We also tossed in a tablespoon of red pepper flakes just to turn the heat way up. Loved it!!

Soooo Good! I used 2lbs of Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Also, replaced pepper with red pepper flakes, water with chicken broth (cubes)  and added 3/4 cup brown rice .

I personally prefer a little more flavor than what this exact recipe gives. After tasting the end result, I added some Worcestershire sauce and some brown sugar. That helped. Next time, I would use Italian tomatoes and the tomato sauce with garlic, basil, and oregano.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I used some of the suggestions posted by others such as substituting beef broth for the water and adding additional spices.  I added thyme and Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning.  My husband really enjoyed the meal.

This was PERFECT just as written!  The only thing I did differently was use tomatoes and sauce with basil and garlic.  I also had some leftover orzo in the freezer that I added to it, and it was wonderful!!  We will definitely make this again....such a great easy dinner, and no need to stuff the cabbage rolls when you just cut it all up anyway!

Made this exactly as written. I found it to be a bit bland hence my three star rating. I added 2 teaspoons of Hungarian paprika which greatly improved the flavor. Next time I will add sauerkraut to give the traditional Hungarian taste I like. Overall, this is a good starter recipe.

My family loved this recipe.  I tried to stay true to the recipe and the only changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of water ,and use about a cup instead of 1/2 a cup; and for the tomatoes, I used 28 oz crushed tomatoes and 14 oz stewed tomatoes, chopped in my food processor, instead of the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes -- just because my family does not like chunky tomatoes and that is how I a make my stuffed cabbage rolls.. We heated up sauerkraut for a topping and rice as a side.  Thanks for a great, quick alternative to haluki!!

Made this for lunch today and it was delicious, except something was lacking in the flavor when I followed the recipe.  I added the following ingredients.  Something was lacking in the flavor when I followed this recipe so I added one can of condensed tomato soup, about 1 1/2 cups cooked white rice, some beef flavored crystals, and about 1 teaspoon  of sugar,  This recipe is a keeper with my changes, and I cannot wait to prepare this for the next potluck I attend.  I would also serve this with some mashed potatoes!

This was an easy and delicious meal.  The original recipe seemed a bit bland for my taste. I added more garlic, some Italian seasoning (McCormick Perfect Pinch Italian - if you don't have it do yourself a favor and get a bottle) and even a few shakes of Frank's Redhot sauce. Another great thing about this - the cleanup was minimal.

I took other reviewer's advice and ramped up the flavors by replacing the water with beef stock and adding ground cardamom, garlic (fresh and powdered), about 2 tblsp of Worcester and a couple teaspoons of mild (sweet) paprika. I cooked one pound of ground beef and one pound of ground pork, and drained them of the fat, then added the meat mixture to my crockpot along with one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce (for me, it didn't need an extra can of diced tomatoes to have enough tomato flavor). I cooked that mixture, along with the spices on high for a couple hours. Meanwhile, I sautéed a half a yellow onion and my chopped cabbage along with a couple cloves of fresh garlic (thrown in after removing the pan from the heat) and added that to the crockpot about 15 mins before serving over steamed rice. Very good, my husband commented so and had seconds, so definitely a keeper. He also commented he'd like to try it with potatoes, so next time I'll throw a can in with the cabbage mixture near the end of cook time. Thanks for the recipe!

I browned one pound lean ground beef and one pound ground turkey with one chopped onion.   Drained that and put into a crockpot with all the other ingredients.  I used diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano, and added a teaspoon of paprika and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.   I cooked it on low for8 hours.  Will definitely make it again.

The recipe as written  is very mediocre.  Spices make all of the difference.    It was a great meal when I added white wine, Maggie seasoning, oregano, and marjoram.  The idea is awesome and timesaving, and the modifications make it worthy for the recipe box.

I made it with only 1 pound beef, 1 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons sweet paprika, a dash of allspice, used tomato paste instead of sauce, and left out the water. I cooked it in my Instant Pot (as recommended in another review) by sautéing the beef and onion first, then pressure cooking for 7 minutes, and quick releasing the pressure. It came out great! The tomato paste and leaving out the water prevented the dish from getting overly watery since pressure cookers don't reduce water volume by much. I'll definitely make it again and try adding rice next time.

I'm on a low carb diet so this recipe was great because i could serve it over rice for my daughter and keep the rice out for me. I followed the videos directions, i think there was a change or two.

I am absolutely inept at making a standard cabbage roll and I thought this recipe would get me the taste and texture without the fuss. Made as directed, I was disappointed that it didn't have the sweet and tangy flavor I'm used to when eating normal cabbage rolls. This is still a great idea though and I will try different variations next time.

Yikes, so bland. I followed the recipe as instructed and it absolutely did not do justice to the cabbage rolls my Ukrainian grandfather used to make us. Not even close. 

If I attempted this again, I would simmer much longer so the meat is very soft.  I would add rice as other people had recommended and I would have added sauerkraut to give it some life. Sour cream would have helped too. 

Not sure how this got 4.6 stars, are Allrecipes reviews skewed somehow? I suppose for an under an hour weekday recipe to get nutrients in the body it was okay.

This was very good. Halved the crushed red pepper but could have used it as written. Not too spicy. Tired of same old ground beef recipes and this was a nice change.

Can't stress enough how easy this recipe is. Not only to make, but to customize to your liking. I have made this three times and I have switched it up all three times. One time with brown sugar to give it a little sweeter taste. One other time with sauerkraut to add that special flavor. The third time I added a few different spices. It is one of my go to recipes now!

LOVE THIS SOUP....    
I've made it this way...  and now  with alterations...
1- 1lb ground beef & 1lb Italian sausage - I use hot..
2- sub tomato paste for the tomato sauce, add 3rd clove garlic
3-  Fire-Roasted Tomatoes are a MUST...
ADDITIONS:  1tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp cumin, 
few leaves chopped fresh basil, or 1 tsp dried, 3/4 tsp celery seed, 2 TBSP brown sugar, 2 TBSP Worscestershire, 2 TBSP dried parsley flakes, or 4 TBSP fresh....  I also add a dollop of sour cream, and  chili garlic sauce to taste per bowl when serving.. It's AWESOME!!! add it to Lots of stuff..  Huy Fong brand, maker of the orig Sriracha sauce  

I love to make large recipes, portion in those plastic lunchmeat trays, frozen wonton soup containers,  etc and freeze them that way so they're flat.. remove them from trays, vacuum seal with my Foodsaver.. and return to freezer..    Reheat like a boil in bag on the stove  for 20 minutes. SUPER Convenient... and LOTS cheaper, healthier than store bought processed junk.   I'll freeze soups, mac/chse, pasta dishes, scalloped potatoes,  homemade pasta,   dare I say even mcdonalds hamburgers,  buns frozen separate from insides.. :0)

Turned out great! Friends loved it! I put in 4 cloves of garlic, 1 lb pork and 1 lb beef, added the 3/4 cup brown rice and 1.5 cups water and simmered for 1.5 hrs as suggested by KIMBEC. Will make it again and everyone that tried it asked for the recipe - thanks!!

This is a great recipe as is, I usually add a cup of white rice as well as low sodium beef broth to simmer before adding the cabbage. I have  made it with sugar and vinegar as others have suggested, great either way. Will definitely make again. Thanks

This is one of my families favorites!  I actually make it in a crock pot. I throw everything in in the morning and by dinner it’s all ready.  Today I made it with 1 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound Italian sausage (it was left over from another recipe).  I also used instant rice (gasp!). My sister has (in a pinch) used tomato soup or spaghetti sauce.  It’s tasty, filling, relatively healthy, and warm on a cold fall or winter day.  I send a good sized portion with my hubby to work (night shift) as it reheats well and tastes just as good reheated. My kiddos have already popped into the kitchen twice to see if it will be ready for lunch instead of dinner.  Sorry kids!  I’ll send them outside to go sledding this afternoon and it’s a guarantee I won’t have leftovers tonight.

Delicious! We loved this. Served it over mashed potatoes and made cornbread to go with it. Only change I made was to add a little sugar like some other reviewers and some extra sea salt because I like salt and my tomatoes were “No Salt Added”.

This is really good and really easy to make.  I made a half recipe using half of everything except tomato sauce.  I also put about two tsps of olive oil in my large sauce pan to saute the beef and onions in.  The only thing that I can think of doing differently is perhaps stirring in some parmesan at the end.

This is easy and delicious!  I made it as written and thought it was very good, but then I stirred in a block of cooked brown rice from the freezer.  I think the added rice really completed the dish.  The hubster had 2 large servings!   I will definitely  make this again!

Love this dish. I use a bag of precut coleslaw mix (found with bagged and boxed salads in the produce section) instead of dealing with cutting cabbage and what to do with the rest of it.

I am allergic to pepper, so I obviously didn't include that ingredient in my version of this recipe. I did add 1 cup of uncooked long-grain white rice and cooked this dish in my slow-cooker. It was delicious.

Used: 1 large (2lb) cabbage roughly cut; 1 lb. lean ground beef (instead of 2 lbs.); 4 large cloves garlic (my family loves garlic!); 6 oz tomato paste; juice of 1 large lemon; 1 cup rice; handful of fresh chopped parsley. My husband loves spicy-hot so this dish was served with pepper flakes on the side. DELICIOUS! Thanks for this marvelous recipe. Hands down best way to eat cabbage. BTW Oven instead of Stove Top: Blanched cabbage in boiling water for 15 min. Cooked meat in 1/4 c .water until evaporated, added olive oil, onion, garlic 5 minutes seasoning with S&P to taste; added tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, & rice, seasoned again with S&P added blanched cabbage, lemon juice, & parsley. Cooked until water absorbed & rice cooked (20 min) then transferred combined ingredients to a casserole dish and baked for 40 minutes. Leftovers topped with parmesan cheese & reheated.

This recipe was much easier and faster than halupki casseroles I have made in the oven. I added some red bell pepper for another veggie and substituted chicken broth for the water.  Also, I wanted to spice it up and added some oregano, paprika, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes!Came out awesome! Served with rice. Will definitely make again

As written it's a solid 4 star recipe as far as my taste's go. However, I'm a big fan of sweet and sour stuffed cabbage so I found it just a bit too bland for my taste buds.  I didn't add the salt and used salt free tomato products but that didn't result in the lower rating as I always cook salt free due to HBP. I made this a second tIme adding equal amounts of balsamic vinegar and brown sugar and a 1/4C of chopped fresh parsley. That brought it up to a definite 5 for me. Yum! Quick and easy compared to regular stuffed cabbage rolls. What's not to love?

This is a good 'starter' recipe that you can easily adjust to your taste.  I added  chopped tomato, vinegar, paprika, and some Italian herb blend I had on hand. It is really good over rice.

The recipe as written is good but when I tasted it I found it a little bland, thus the 4 stars instead of 5. I added some paprika and some smoked paprika, a little garlic powder and dried, minced onion, in addition to the fresh garlic and onion that the recipe calls for. And, because I had it in the house, a sprig of fresh thyme. I also would add either 2 (8oz) cans of tomato sauce or some tomatoes paste next time. As written it wasn't tomatoey enough for my taste. I had some pizza sauce in the house so I added about 4 oz of that. This is a good starter recipe and one that people could adjust to their own tastes.

I give it four stars on it's own. However I kicked it up with a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also made it with a cup of rice and a cup and a half more liquid. Very good recipe but does not go for more than one day of leftovers as it gets a bit mushy day three.

I have made this recipe with and without changes. It's great every time I make it. So much easier than the old fashioned stuffed cabbage I used to make. I usually do use equal part of ground beef and ground pork instead of just ground beef.

Followed the recipe as written and the wife and  I  thought it was a keeper.  Very easy to prepair . My wife liked it as is , but I found it to be a little bland  so when I put it in my bowl I sprinkled  in some red pepper flakes. That way I didn't ruin the dish for her . Great recipe that we will make again and again.

Super easy, tasty and very inexpensive.  I halved the recipe and it still made a lot!  Beyond that, I swapped diced tomatoes for Rotel and added about a teaspoon of chipotle powder.

I read how some were saying that it lacked flavor so I used the fire roasted tomatoes and tomato soup instead I also added about 1/2 tsp of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.
 T flavor profile is good with the different textures and flavors. Simple to make,cant't wait to make this during the few cold months we get in southern Mississippi.

Great recipe!!!  I never use ground beef in anything other than burgers.  I use meatloaf mix and it is excellent in this recipe.  I also used fresh chopped tomatoes from the garden and used tomato soup instead of sauce.  My family loves this recipe.

This was pretty good. Added red pepper flakes because of reviews and we like spicy food. Made a lot, so I froze the leftovers. Possibility will make again.

This was excellent as described in the recipe, but on a second try I substituted half the meat with fresh sliced mushrooms and added approximately 1 tablespoon caraway seeds. Made for a slightly more complex taste :-)

Gorgeous.

Used very lean beef (London broil that I trimmed and ground myself in the food processor).  Didn’t brown the meat or onion: just threw it all in the pot.  Used 1 ½ t white pepper.  Added Worcester Sauce.  Simmer 20 mins and then let it cool overnight.

I can't cook everyday, so I usually have to double recipes. This recipe is perfect for making plenty of leftovers (family of 4 with older boys here). I didn't have any tomato sauce or paste, so I used 1/4 to 1/2 cup of organic ketchup instead (organic ketchup doesn't taste as vinegary as Heinz). Cooked in a 5.5 quart saucepan and it was full! Served with rice.

The only changes I made were : 1 lb. of ground beef, 1 can of stewed tomato and 1 can of tomato paste with 2 cans of water. And 2 tbs. of brown sugar.  This was so delicious !  Both my husband and I had a  second helping. And plan on bring some to work for lunch.

Almost all of the flavor of cabbage rolls without the work, you have to love that! Looking at the recipe I was worried about the flavor so I did add some sugar (about a tablespoon) and some Worcestershire sauce (a splash or two).

Great base recipe! I added quite a bit more spice than this called for and it turned out really good. I used a bunch of  paprika, lots more pepper, a bit of cumin, parsley flakes, and i used beef broth instead of water. I also added rice I had left over. I used too much broth and it  ended up more like a soup but but was really good! I WILL be making this again, oh and it was very easy.

This was VERY good, even in the middle of a hot Texas summer.   Only changes I made was using tomato soup to sub one can of tomatoes as I only had one can of tomatoes.  Oh, wait, I also added 3/4 cup of Texmati rice.  The rice cooks VERY fast.  Rice was thoroughly cooked through in about 20 minutes.  It absorbed very nicely what I thought was a lot of excess liquid from cabbage.  Highly recommend this recipe.  Family friendly and open to variations, I see myself making this weekly.  Thanks for posting!  :)

I made this recipe exactly as written and it lacked serious flavor. Edible yet will never make again. Might taste better with the vinegar like others said.

update: changed to 1 star. I tried mixing some of the leftovers with sauerkraut which made it worse. We ended up throwing all leftovers away (those which did not have the sauerkraut) because we truly didn't like it.

This is a great staple recipe. Doesn't disappoint. I used meatless burger crumbles because I'm vegan and it was great! I didn't give the full 5 stars because I feel like something is missing to this otherwise great recipe. I actually feel this way whenever I make a really tomato based recipe but I can't quite put my finger on what it is.

Whoa! I made this exactly as the recipe is, and it was so bland! No wonder most of the reviews had to tinker with it to get it to their taste. It was like water. You really need to add more spices to get any taste.

This is good - tastes almost as good as the 'rolls' but so much easier. Thanks for this delicious comfort food recipe! (I use Italian sausage in my cabbage rolls, and in this, too.)

This one-pot cabbage meal is easy and healthy. I agree with other reviewers that it's bland. In future, I expect I'll use this recipe as a base into which I'll add other items - perhaps garlic, savory hot peppers, carrots...maybe zucchini...

I use equal parts ground beef and ground sausage.  After the cabbage has cooked down a bit, about 15 min, add 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup of rice, simmer for 30 min or till rice is tender.  As good as and easier then stuffing cabbage.

This was good!  I like meals I can cook once and eat off them for the rest of the week.  Only things I did different were; didn't have minute rice so I used boil in bag rice and slightly undercooked it.  Also, used a bag of shredded cabbage for cole slaw in place of chopping head cabbage.....made it even easier.   Also, added about 1/2 c ketchup with vegetable juice...made it a little tangy.  When it was almost done on the stove top, I split it into two casserole dishes.....froze one and topped the other with shredded cheese and baked for about 15 minutes.  Next time, I'm going to use ground turkey or chicken and safe a few more calories!

I'm not a fan of cabbage rolls at all, but my husband likes them. I tried this and loved it! I used only one pound of ground beef, but other than that used the ingredients as listed. (The only process change is I usually cook onlons first a bit and then add ground beef .) I don't add rice to it since some of us like it over rice and some over potatoes.

I only made a few tweaks. I used 1 pound of beef  and added 0.5 cup of dry converted rice. I added 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 t smoked paprika and 1/2 t sweet paprika, and a bit of garlic, and 1 T brown sugar. I cooked it in the pressure cooker for  12  minutes, with natural release. Plenty of liquid for the added rice. Next time I might eliminate the tomato sauce and add couple tablespoons of tomato paste. Made a huge pot (12- 1 cup servings) that come out to being around 150 cal a serving.

I was making this for my mom who is diabetic and has to watch her cholesterol, so I subbed ground turkey for the ground beef. The beef would have been more flavorful, but the turkey worked. We also added some shredded carrots and used vegetable broth in place of water for some extra nutrition. And even though it sounds a little odd, I added a few lentils for my dad who needs lots of fiber :). I will add some extra spices next time to make up for the missing flavor of the beef, but this recipe is definitely a keeper. Quick and easy. My parents loved it, and my mom's sugar--which has been elevated for the last week--was back down this morning!

This was great, much easier than the roller version!  I added almost 1 cup of brown rice, then upped the water to 1 cup and added 1 cup of beef broth.   Will definitely make again!

I made ours smaller for 2 & it still came out with plenty for 4! I used 1/2 lb 97-3% beef & 1/2 lb  97-3% ground turkey. I only used 1 can diced tomatoes.   Used 1 pkg pre-shred coleslaw. Also used Mrs Dash Garlic & Herb for the garlic spices. We served it over pine nut couscous. It was amazing! Will definitely be making it over & over again! Mom made me save some for her lol

I’m polish so I of course add rice to this dish along with more tomato sauce ( I use Hines tomato juice instead of sauce) to compensate for the rice ...I also make mine in Dutch oven in the oven ...it cooks even that way.....so love this recipe

I love this recipe. Fast and easy! The only change I make is replace water with a can of beef broth for more flavor. Sometimes I'll use a small box of broth because I like it a little more like soup. This is one of those that you can throw in whatever you have on hand to make it a bit different: chopped potatoes, rice, carrots, or sliced sausage instead of ground beef.

Delicious! I love my usual cabbage casserole recipe, which is basically this plus rice, cheese, and bread crumbs. I am trying to reduce calories, though, so I tried this out. I was surprised that I hardly missed the calorie laden ingredients. I used one pound extra lean ground beef plus one pound fresh uncured kielbasa sausage but otherwise made this exactly as written. I did find that I had to cook it a little longer than suggested to get the cabbage tender, but that depends on how small you chop it I suppose. I will replace my cabbage casserole recipe with this one whenever I need something lighter, or want something simpler to make.

This recipe is so delicious!!! I was skeptical before making it with so few ingredients/spices but it is very flavorful as is. Even the non cabbage lovers in my family devoured it! The second time I made it with Rotel instead of just diced tomatoes to give it some kick and it was awesome. After dishing it into the bowl I like to add shredded cheese and a touch of sour cream!

My family really liked this! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I put a little bit of ketchup. I also threw in some Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, paprika, oregano, 1 1/2 cups frozen brown rice and 1 cup chicken broth. I used Trader Joe's chopped cabbage and carrots. Served with sour cream. Will make again

This is a great base recipie.  I've never had nor made cabbage rolls, so this was entirely new to me.  I made the dish last night with some additions/changes:  while I browned the meat and chopped onions I added S&P, garlic powder, garlic salt, onion powder, poultry seasoning, and Old Bay (I'm from Maryland...'nuff said).  While draining the meat mixture I sliced 2 Russett potatoes and browned them in the same pan with 3 tbsp salted butter, then added the cabbage and more seasonings.  I added 1 cup chicken broth to the pan to get the scrapings off the bottom of the pan, then added the meat, 2 cups plain tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, more salt (this dish calls for quite a bit of salt), more Old Bay, and 2 beef bouillon cubes.  I let it simmer for 30 minutes, and served it over Jasmine rice (used 1 cup water and the remaining chicken broth)with cornbread on the side.  It was a HUGE hit with our family and friends.  The next time I make this I will add the cabbage a little later in the cooking process so it won't overcook (the cabbage was a little too soggy for my taste) and I'll add bacon.  I also think I'll try this recipie with seafood (crabmeat, shrimp, mussles, etc) instead of hamburger.  This is why I like this recipie, it tastes very good, it's easy to make with minimal prep time, and you won't be afraid of being creative with it!!  I'm glad I tried it!

We make this all of the time, we used sirloin we grind at home, substitute water for mushroom or beef stock (low sodium) and add smoked paprika and caraway seeds. It's very good!

This recipe is delicious!  Added a little less pepper so my toddler can eat it too and it not be too spicy. Other than that followed the recipe as is and it is perfect.

I had intended on making stuffed cabbage, but working full time I just didn't have the time; so when I saw this recipe, I thought great! Stuffed cabbage without all the work! It was good, but I can't put my finger on what  was missing, an ingredient that gives stuffed cabbage it's unique appeal. Overall I would make it again, but I would like to find what this recipe is missing for me.

This is an excellent recipe and love the ease. 
This time I did add 3/4 cup of rice to the browning meat, used 3 cloves of garlic, and one can of fire roasted tomatoes, otherwise made as directed. Very good. Makes a lot so make sure you have a large pot or two smaller pots works ok too.

Delicious. Never stuffing  cabbage leaves again! Albeit subbed 2lbs ground beef with 1 lb smoked polish. And mixed with 12 oz buttered Kluski noodles cooked separately. Don't forget the Franks Red Hot or Louisiana hot sauce on top.  My new version of Haluski! I love All Recipes for stuf like this. Thanks to all original posters.

I have made this a number of times and it has never disappointed me. I substitute half the ground beef for hot sausage. (I remove the sausage from the casing and scramble like I do the hamburger) It adds that little zing of flavor.  I always double the recipe and everyone is a fan!

This was fantastic, I used one can regular tomatoes and one can fire roasted and it had just the right amount of flavor! While I was eating it I thought it would be great to add some corn (I know that is not traditional cabbage roll style) but I think it would taste delicious! Everything else I followed from the recipe :) DELICIOUS!

I made it with chicken thighs,  because my husband has a medical condition and cannot eat beef. Well that slight change was successful my family lived it!!! I followed every step to the T.
I am glad I made it and will do it again soon.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I substituted 1/2 cup Tomato Juice for the 1/2 cup of water that the recipe calls for.  I also added 1 cup of rice and an additional  cup of Tomato Juice for the rice to absorb.  It was DELICIOUS!!

I only added more garlic because we are garlic lovers. It was delicious and a nice change to our routine dinners.

Easy to make, but not a lot of flavor. I won't make it again. I can see where young kids might like it though.

Made this recipe last week and my husband couldn't stop saying how good ìt was. That in itself is a winner to me. I too enjoy the taste of cabbage rolls but have run out of large slots of time to make the actual rolls. This gives us the full taste of cabbage rolls with so much less time spent at the stove. So worth a try.

Awesome as written or used as a base! I sometimes sub chorizo for part of the beef and always add cumin. This can be tweaked in SO many ways. Always delicious. I am serving tonight with salad and cornbread ;-)

I also get extremely annoyed at people posting reviews when they alter the recipe!  Stop it, you are not cooks or chefs or you would have your own cooking show!!!!
This was a great recipe on a cold Ohio night.  Very easy to make and excellent flavor.
Thank you for another awesome recipe, this one is a keeper.

Entire family loved this!  I used venison sausage, added pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce,  and served it over brown rice.  It was a little soupy, so I might omit the water next time.  Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent!! Great flavor and easy to make. If you don;t like cabbage, it isn't overpowering in this recipe. Compliant with Whole 30, so that makes it a double winner!!

OK, but rather insipid. Next time I would add lemon juice or something sour to give it a bit of bite. It is a good way to use up a small head of cabbage and it makes enough for several nights.

This was very good reminded me of dish my mom use to make. There's  only two of us so I did my best to half the recipe and should have used more cabbage.  I combine some suggestions from others and added  brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce  and some all spice. It was great over rice.  The other half liked it and they don't eat a lot of veggies at all. Their a corn and green bean person. They loved it too and even took some to work the next day but wanted on toast.  It does get better the next day . The left overs had great flavor.  If you don't like rice it would be great stuffed in a bake tater too. Will be making again. A good cold winter day dish.

Made it exactly as written, but we were a little disappointed; we thought it lacked flavor.   I doctored mine up a bit after the fact by adding  sea salt, white pepper and a 46oz bottle of V8 juice.  
Next time I make it, I will only use 1/2 onion, 2 small heads of cabbage, 1 can of diced tomatoes, NO tomato sauce, NO garlic, 1 tsp of Sea Salt (in beef mixture), 2 tsp's of WHITE pepper (in lieu of black), 46 oz V8 Juice,  and I would add Sea Salt to cabbage as it boiled.

I cut the recipe in half, as the recipe as it is makes a lot for just my husband and I.  The only thing different was that I added 1/2 tsp of dried thyme (if you make the whole recipe, add 1 tsp thyme).  This really made the flavor pop.

A great alternative to stuffed cabbage. I added extra seasonings (garlic powder, crushed red pepper, paprika, half a chicken cube and a little ketchup). To me it was a bit bland as written. With the extra spices, I though it was very good. I will make it again. Also, next time I will use the chicken broth instead of water. I served it with white rice.

LOVE this! I make it a couple of times a year. I do add 1 beef bullion and caraway seeds (look up caraway seeds: so many healthy and matricidal properties!). The caraway adds a bit of European flavor.  My "go to" comfort food recipe in the winter.

I didn't use the chicken broth, instead I added beef bullion. I also didn't use the tomatoes that was called for, I used Italian style stewed tomatoes, 2 cans. I found this yummy, as I also make my green pepper casserole similar instead of stuffing them. I will make this again.

The only change I made to this (because I had to) was only using one pound of ground beef rather than two, I only had one on hand.  Otherwise I made this recipe as stated.  Rather than cooking it on the stove, I browned the beef & onions on the stove then transferred it and remaining ingredients to a crock pot and let it simmer on low for hours until done.  It was delicious and I will be making it again ... but with the recommended two pounds of ground beef.

It was pretty good, I added some rice to it. If I make it again I'm going to make it into more of a soup.

I found using the recipe as is, tasted a bit flat even though I did add another 28oz large can of tomatoes as I wanted it to be a bit juicier. I even tried adding some italian seasoning to enhance the flavor. The taste of the dish was still missing something, just not sure what. I shared this rather large meal with neighbors. The recipe is a bit large for two people.
We ate the leftovers tonight . After reading some of the other reviews I did add a bit of paprika and more garlic powder to my plate. It did add more flavor to the dish.

I thought this was excellent, although DH said it was "ok." My daughter loved it as well. We're a non-chunky tomato family so I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and a 24 oz can of no sugar spaghetti sauce. Added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of sugar. Took about 40 minutes of simmering for the cabbage to be tender. Served with cheddar garlic biscuits - yum!

So, I told my husband I was making this and he asked that I make it with Italian sausage.  I was sceptical, but did it and it's delicious!!  I omitted the tomato sauce, not a fan, added white rice and beef broth.  Yum!  Even my picky husband likes it.  I will be making this again.

I did not make any changes to this recipe, it was simple and inexpensive, and I loved that it had no rice! I served this with crescent rolls.

Followed recipe exactly. Only difference is I threw a few olives  that I had to use. Needed a little more spice but I enjoyed very much. Could add anything you wanted to this recipe as in corn, olives, beans,  to make it a little more filling. But was wonderful as is.   Will be cooking again.

Just finished making this recipe, its soooo good! I used a can of tomato paste and chicken broth with evap. milk to thin it down. Added a ton of cracked pepper to spice it up a bit along with some paprika, a few flakes of basil and called this meal perfect!

I made this and I added some of my own secrets which included 1 TSP oregano, 1 TSP Italian seasonings, 1 TSP garlic salt, 1 TSP basil, 2 c cooked rice, 1 canned of slightly rinsed sauerkraut, and because I only had tomato paste I used it and combined 1 sm can of t paste with 1/2 c Evaporated Milk (it gives it a creamy tomato sauce like soup) whisking together to make a slurry like.  This was the easiest homemade version I have ever made of unrolled cabbage rolls in my life and will probably make it more often now!  Thank you for the starting idea of this recipe!  I add sauerkraut for a little umph that I like a lot!

I made this as written.  It was OK because it was somewhat bland.  Next time I will add more spice.  Maybe paprika, pinch of red pepper flakes, plenty of salt and pepper...  Also, 2 lbs of ground beef was WAY too much meat!  I'll use 1 lb next time.

Big hit every time and so very easy.  For the can tomato I use the Hunts Fire Roasted Garlic, adds a little something special to the flavor!

This is my second time making this recipe.  I usually make a recipe as written so that I may get a true understanding of the flavors and process. This recipe is great as is.  I did make two small changes to tailor it to our taste buds.  I added the cup of rice as mentioned in several other reviews.  I also substituted the tomato sauce with a can of El Pato which is a Mexican tomato sauce spiced with jalapeño.  Just those two changes tweaked the flavor ever so slightly but still ended with a great dish.  Thank you for sharing!  Happy cooking.

Great recipe which is very easy to tweak to your preferences.  I like one can of diced tomatoes plus one 12oz can V8 for the tomatoes - 1# burger and about 1/2 header cabbage.  Add a little chili powder for spice.  So yummy!

I love this recipe... I do have a habit of doctoring up everything that I cook  so I put my extra seasoning in it and I like to chop up andouille sausage and put it in with it.. it's absolutely delicious.

My husband and are both Polish and we thought these tasted just like Galumpkis.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it over  cooked rice.  We both thought it was much easier than making Galumpkis and tasted just as good.  It makes a big batch.  Next time I may get brave and throw the rice and extra water right in the same pot like another view suggested.

 My only change was to use ground chicken in the place of the ground beef.

I think this is a very good recipe for when I don't want to actually stuff cabbage. I did substitute ketchup for the 1/2 cup of water. Also used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground pork. Added 1/3 cup light brown sugar and 3 tablespoons of white vinegar. I love that sweet & sour flavor. Yum!

Fall has arrived in Minnesota and this is a perfect dish. Our Farmer's Market provided the cabbage and we did add 3/4 of a cup of  brown rice along with an equal amount of water. Delicious dinner. Thank you tcl-adams!

Only change was to cut it in 1/2, and 2 of us almost ate the whole thing.  Only served  bread with it.  My husband loved it because he doesn't like different spices. I do but I thought it was delicious just the way it was posted.

It is the perfect base for this dish. I jazzed it up a bit as others did but it was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.

I just can't believe it!  This was fantastic.  All five of us liked it and that NEVER happens... N. E. V. E. R.!  Not one of my three kids balked at the cabbage and I would have bet money they would turn up their noses.  I used ground turkey instead of beef for a little healthier dish and maybe a little less water.  Also let it cook a bit longer.  Served it over white rice, but I'd eat it alone no problem.   Yum!

Delicious! Made some substitutions due to what I had in the pantry. I used 2 cans of Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes and beef broth instead of water, also used a can of V8 instead of the tomato juice. I also added 1 cup brown rice with 1 3/4 cups broth.

It was just like my Polish grandmother Faye's , only a different shape! ...and easier to make. Per her recipe I added 3 heaping tablespoons of sour cream at the end and served over mashed potatoes.

I am rating this four stars because I made it much different. I used left over breaded chicken, added mushrooms and used chicken broth instead of beef broth. I also added a package of onion soup mix ( I halved the recipe). One important thing to note is definitely use a double boiler or be super careful, because it's really easy to burn the bottom of pot.

This recipe was very good.  I don't eat beef so I used ground turkey and some Tony Cachere's Cajun seasoning just for a little kick.  Even with my few adjustments, it was still very good!

I love the quantity it makes because I can make up individual serving sizes, freeze them, and take them in our RV for quick easy meals.

We really enjoyed this recipe! It was delicious and satisfying. The only changes I made were I used an extra 1/2 cup of water and I added some crushed red pepper flakes. I think next time I may add some potatoes and corn, but the recipe is great as it is. My boyfriend is on his third bowl!

Great recipe! Instead of ground beef I used turkey ground beef using the same ingredients it came out deliciously good, if you use turkey ground beef add a bit of Goya seasoning for the meat but not too much as the flavors of the cabbage have enough salt.

Very good. A little too spice the first time I made it. Cut the pepper by half the next times I made it. A real family pleaser.

Because so many reviews said it was bland, I decided to add garlic powder, some red chili flakes, doubled the tomato sauce and 1 cup of prepared blend of whole grain wild rice (Lundgren's brand).  It was incredibly delicious, bursting with flavor and healthy!!!  It was definitely spicy because of the red chili flakes I added but we liked it that way.  I will definitely make it again!

This is so, so yummy!  As others have said, rice is a great addition.  I add a half a cup of rice and 1 and a half cups of chicken or beef broth, AND eliminate the water.  When hot out of the oven, add a good amount of grated parmesan.  One of our favorites even though my husband doesn't like cabbage.

Added precooked rice, no tomato sauce and beef broth which another reviewer suggested, as I too don't use just plain water in my cooking if I can avoid it.  Not for a one pot dish anyway.  Add cinnamon and all spice, bay leaf and let steep away in my crockpot until we were ready about 8pm or so.  Served with green beans, next time I will simply add them in!!  Great recipe thanks for sharing!!!

I've made this several times with various changes based off of other reviews suggestions. Each time it's been a hit! The 1st time I made it as written & it was good & resulted in 2nd helping but I wanted more flavor.
 
I tried the Brown sugar idea & didn't like it. It overtook all the other flavors. I countered it with some cumin & it was good but not what I wanted. No 2nd helpings but they cleared their plates.

I found the perfect balance by replacing tomato sauce with tomato soup (i know it's salt in a can but it's salted tomatoes in a can ;) ). Also added in a cup of rice & 1- 1/2 cups extra water. Perfecto!

I think it's a well rounded meal in a pot with all the veggies so no sides needed expect fresh cornbread ofcourse!!

LOVE THIS!!  Hubby loves cabbage rolls but I've never been a big fan of cabbage however I do enjoy this!  It's filling, delicious and so much easier than making cabbage rolls!!  Second time I made it using sausage instead of hamburger and enjoy it even more.

I followed the recipe, but when I went to try it, it was really bland. So I decided to  add a tablespoon of tomato paste, garlic powder, onion powder, more salt and pepper, and a dash of cumin and let it simmer for 20 more minutes. It turned out excellent! Even my picky toddlers enjoyed it. Will definitely make again!

I actually made this recipe because I could with what I had on hand, with a few substitutions: 

 I used a can of stewed tomatoes and a large can of tomato puree for all tomato products. It turned out great! Iassume it was a little more soupy than the original though, which was fine with me.
I added mushrooms because the recipe is so basic as is. 
I used ground turkey instead of beef, which made it a decently healthy , and still delicious dish. 
And of course, I added more salt and pepper, hot paprika, and cayenne. 
I used broth instead of water, and an extra half onion.

I've made this twice now. I love it! I made it as directed the first time, but it just seemed to need... something. So the second time I made it, I added about a tablespoon of Sweet Smoked Spanish Paprika. It was perfect! I give it 5 stars because it's just fine as is.

I made this recipe as written. I liked it although I would spice it up a little more if I made it again. My family did not like the recipe. The cabbage in this recipe is boiled and has that boiled texture. It's nothing liked baked or grilled cabbage that they do like.

Served with mashed potatoes: super filling, the leftovers lasted us a good long while. I only had less than half of a cabbage on hand at the time, I will definitely use a whole one next time (I love cabbage!)

This was yummy... with one addition, a can of tomato paste. I kept tasting it and thinking about what it was missing. Then after reading the reviews I added the can of tomato paste and Bam! there it was! Deee-lish!!! It freezes like a charm and makes a great meal for another night. I have served it to cabbage-loving guests and they enjoyed it too.

This is a keeper! Besides the cabbage, I had everything in my pantry & freezer and putting it all together was quick & simple. The only tweak I made was to use beef broth in place of the water. Delicious!

This dish was amazing. Everyone loved it. I used the tomatoes already seasoned with garlic and at the suggestion of another reviewer added a cup of rice and extra cup of water for convenience.

I made this according to directions. As another poster stated if you don't try the recipe don't rate it. That is just rude. Post your own recipe if you want to change it. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe tremendously! Thank you so much! This is a keeper. In future I may or may not try different things with this recipe. But to rate a recipe you need to make the recipe!

Used only 1 pound of beef and one can diced tomatoes with half of the cabbage. Added 3/4 cup cooked rice. Will make again.  A lot easier than rolling and tastes great.

I made half the recipe for my husband and myself but I used the whole can of tomato sauce plus one can of water, 1/2 cup of beef broth and about 1/3 cup of brown rice.  Next time, I'll use a little more than 1/2 cup of rice.  I cooked it for 40 minutes and let it stand about 15-20 minutes in which time it thickened from the rice.  It was quite good and will make it again.

This was so good. Normally I don't change the way it is written but I only had ground pork! It was delicious. And so easy. I served it with mashed potatoes! It would be awesome with beef I am sure!

This was delicious.  I did add an additional 1/2 cup of water, 1 cup of rice, and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I also added  20 minutes  to the cooking time, with the lid removed for the last 15 minutes.  This is a keeper!

I made this tonight for dinner.  After following the recipe to the letter, I thought it was rather bland.  The salt and pepper were not enough for my taste.  I added 1 cup of instant brown rice and an extra  cup of water, 1/2 tsp dried basil and about 1 1/2 teaspoons Penzey's smoked paprika to kick it up a notch.  The smoky flavor brought the dish to life.  We really enjoyed it and I'll make it again since I have noted the changes I made.  Thank you for a very easy dinner recipe.

My family LOVES this dish! The pot is usually close to gone with very little leftovers by the time everyone is done. It is easy to make! The only thing I do different is double the garlic for a little more flavor.

Fantastic! Served with (frozen) perogis and  non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  In effort to reduce the sodium, I skipped the tomato sauce and salt but I added 1/2 Tablespoon of consomme. I also added a TON of ground pepper and paprika and an extra couple cloves of garlic. The kids and hubby loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Only change was tomato soup instead of paste. Good, not great but would make again. My mom makes something similar called porcupine balls n stuffs peppers w meat n rice and adds sauerkraut. If I made it again I'd prob add some tartness to it thru sauerkraut or rotel tomatoes instead of regular. Otherwise I love the idea of throwing it together like this!

This was very good. I used a bag of cole slaw mix, already chopped up to simplify things. I used a can of Swanson's Beef Broth instead of water and added a 1/2 cup of brown rice. You have to increase the cooking time if you add rice. Simmer about 45-60 minutes for brown rice.

This was easy followed recipe almost to a T - I read reviews that said use Fire roasted tomatoes - I did that and added 2 extra cloves of garlic - felt like it still needed more spice - will add red pepper next time.

Loved it!  Reminded me of my Gramma's stuffed cabbage.  I used stewed tomatoes and added some apple cider vinegar and cup of rice.  A winner in my home!

I followed this recipe except that I added rice (I have to have rice in my 'cabbage rolls') and extra liquid (chicken broth). It was delicious and even better the next day. I always make tons so that I have some leftovers. This is extremely delicious.

I make stuffed cabbage at least once a year for my elderly father as a treat using my mother's recipe. It takes a long time and I don't look forward to it. This is sooooo much easier and just as good! The only thing I did differently was add a small package of sauerkraut, which is what I use in the rolled cabbages. Of course there's also rice in the mix for stuffed cabbage, but instead of adding it in the pot, I cooked some separately to serve with the casserole. Delicious!!

First time I made as written.   The second time I added a bit more garlic, some celery and some bacon. It is a bit bland as written, for my taste, but I like spicier food. Overall I think  it a good base recipe. It is easy to make, kind to the pocketbook and easy to customize to my personal tastes. I am another person who is sick of people that rate recipes that they do not try the recipe as written. I will make this recipe again.

This was awesome!!  I did make changes, because I'm not fond of a lot of tomatoes, I only used one can diced and increased the tomato sauce (which I used Italian sauce) to a lg can.  When I make cabbage rolls I make them Hungarian style with sauerkraut so I added a lg jar of that as well!!  So delicious and very flavorful, I will definitely make again!!

Great recipe! Super easy, just throw it all in a pot. Longest process was chopping the cabbage but even that took maybe 5 minutes. After reading reviews I also added 1 tsp of sugar, Worcestershire sauce to the meat and to the pot, fresh parsley and served it over rice. Definitely a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing!

Ok so I made this and it was quite good, but I did make a few changes to better suit my tastes. First of all make sure you have a pot big enough for all this, I realized as I got started I didn't, so I had to move it to the crock pot and it took much longer than expected. Secondly I think I might use red cabbage instead of green next time for some extra color and flavor. Here are the actual changes I made: I added about a cup of brown rice. In my experience cabbage rolls have always had rice in them and I think it helped round out the recipe well. I also added some Italian seasoning and a little oregano. I also added a good bit of paprika because I think that just goes very well with red meat in this flavor profile. Finally as I was tasting it at the end I still felt it was a bit bland and needed a little tartness so I added apple cider vinegar which I think brings out the cabbage beautifully. I think next time I would replace half or all the water with apple cider vinegar at the beginning.

I made it using spaghetti sauce rather than the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes to equal the volume measurements as I like mine with additional flavors. Also instead of the chopping the cabbage, I used the coleslaw mix (2 bags) it added a little sweetness with the carrots.

Used my regular stuffed cabbage seasonings. Add extra cabbage next time. Added 1/3c cooked rice to each serving before freezing. Could live without rice addition.

The only thing I did to this that the recipe didn't call for was for the cans of diced tomatoes.  I used one can of fire roasted tomatoes and one can of basil oregano tomatoes.  My husband doesn't rave much about any of the recipes I follow, but he not only raved about this one, he had two helpings!  We found this to be delicious and I will most certainly make it again!

I only had one pound of ground beef, so added a pound of spicy pork sausage with leeks. I didn't have enough tomato sauce, and added 1 cup beef broth instead of 1 can of tomato sauce. Added oregano & smoked Spanish paprika for additional flavor. Came out wonderfully delicious. Whole family gobbled it up.

I have made this several times now.  We love it just the way the recipe is written, although I have added cooked rice to it on occasion.  It makes a huge batch, so we get at least three or four meals out of it.  It freezes very well.  Thanks for posting!

It's good.  I served it on a bed of basmati rice.  I might try a bit of Worcestershire sauce next time I make it...and a bit more cabbage. I used to make cabbage rolls and they just took too much time, etc.  This is a good replacement.

It turned out pretty good.  I cut in half for two of us.  I added more seasonings to jazz it up.  Also seemed too watery, will cut water next time.  Overall a decent and fairly easy recipe.

Husband couldn't stop raving about this.  I made a couple additions per reviews -- about 1-2T apple cider vinegar and 2 heaping T of brown sugar.  SO delicious.   I'm not a cabbage fan and I loved this.

I would have given this one a five but it was a little bland for me. It is quick, easy and nutritious. I made it with ground turkey and it was every bit as good as using beef.  And it tastes better the next day! I actually ate it for breakfast. I just need a little more seasoning than what this recipe called for. I have definitely passed this one along to many friends!

Very good though I may add some grated carrot (instead of sugar as some others have suggested)next time I make it.  Added Basmati rice to the pan as it cooked, which took away any soupiness. We enjoyed it.

I did take some of the suggestions of the other reviewers. The vinegar, the brown sugar, rice and the tomato soup. I added some Worsteschire sauce  and Beef bouillon cubes as I didn't have any beef broth. I only made half the recipe as it is  just my husband and I. He ate 2 helpings!  I will next time though cook it longer.  We also used the sour cream, it added a nice touch. I cooked it for an hour and the cabbage still was not quite done. All in all it's a great dish and I will make it again.

So fast and easy to make!  Saw some reviews that said it needed more spice. So I used 2 - 10 oz cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies instead of 2 - 14 oz cans of regular diced tomatoes.  It was very spicy!  Easy to alter the ingredients to your own taste.

I almost made this exactly as the recipe called for but I added some extra paprika. everything turned out great, I really liked it. I even kept it as leftovers and ate it the next day for lunch, and I hate left overs, but it was still really good the next day as well. I will definitely make this, and eat it again.

I rate it a 5 star after adding the following: 2 more tsp black pepper, 2 tsp tomato bouillon, 1 tsp beef bouillon, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 2 more garlic cloves. Also I used ground moose instead of beef. Loved it! Next time I might add paprika and vinegar as another commenter suggested.

Awesome awesome awesome!!!!! I'm not even a big fan of cabbage, but we love this dish! We like our food kinda spicy so we use ground sausage either in combo with beef (half and half) or all sausage. We also use the can of Rotel, This is a great change to the hum drum meal of the everyday busy life!

While I enjoyed the results of this recipe, I felt that it needed some rice to taste like a stuffed cabbage roll. However, it was still easier to make and of utmost importance it was delicious. I enjoyed the left overs the next day too. I only had one can of regular diced tomatoes and Rotel left and used both cans. Perhaps, it's the Rotel that gave this dish the extra flavor. If using regular canned tomatoes, I might be inclined to toss in some herbs, such as basil or rosemary and thyme.

I only had a pound of ground beef, but I added 4 cloves of garlic and only one can of the tomatoes. I also added some Rice a Roni beef flavored rice to the dish. Very good! Made this with boiled buttered potatoes and cornbread on the side. Very good combo right there. Next time I will add more cabbage!

Good base recipe but really lacked in seasoning. I added a whole bunch of stuff to kick it up a notch- paprika, red wine vinegar, herbs and worcestershire sauce, sugar and tomato paste.

I also added rice, as others had suggested. This was easy and tastes great. My husband doesn't like cabbage and he just ate a big bowl!

We really enjoy this. It is easy to make...low carb...healthy. The only change I made is that I add 2 cans of tomato sauce. I only did that because the first time I made it I cut the recipe in half and used the whole 8 oz can. Second time I made it I wanted it to taste the same as the first. This is a go to recipe we make a lot now. Goes great with cornbread. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as the recipe was except I don't like tomato chunks so used crushed tomatoes, and I added a beef bullion cube and some seasoned salt at the end for extra flavor and it was delicious. Served it over rice.

Turned out great! A new favorite! I had been wanting to make this for awhile. With it just being my wife and I at home now, there was a lot left over. So we froze half to be used later. My only change was to use a 14oz tomato sauce, and a 1/2 cup of apple juice instead of water.

I used ground turkey and bagged shredded red cabbage. Loved it! Used green bell pepper instead of onion too. I don't know why you'd add water. It was very runny without it. Next time I'll even drain the tomatoes. I don't want soup.

I live in "cabbage country" in Florida, so I always look for new ways to prepare it. I made this recipe and my husband and I loved it. I added some beef stock instead of water. Also, the canned tomatoes had green chilies in them. After simmering the concoction, I baked it with a little cheese on top "just because." We will make this again

Followed recipe, I made minimal changes  I added 1/2 cup raw rice, cut the recipe in half.except for the tomato sauce because I added rice.  Thought it was very good. Husband thought it was strong, I could see his point. Stuffed cabbage or Halupki is tough to replicate your relative's recipe, so you really can't get emotional over the dish. It's easy, cheap, tummy filler great for  wintertime. I won't make cabbage rolls so this works for me. The Mr., not so much, still looking for his Dad's halupki.

Will definitely make again.  I used a couple of suggestions from other reviews - added 3/4 c. brown rice along with 1 1/2 c. water, added garlic, and cooked 20 min. longer.  May try Rotel next time.

Added 3 tsp salt, 2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 1 cup quinoa.  No water.  Used stove pressure cooker and cooked for 7 minutes on medium pressure.  The extra water was absorbed after cooking.  With a little persuasion, all four kids ate it and then discovered they enjoyed it!

This was a quick, easy and very tasty after-work meal. Since there are only the two of us I halved the recipe and it tasted pretty good. I added a small pinch of dried chopped tarragon to give it another layer of flavor and after another 5 minutes of simmering we dug into it. Perfect way to end a fall day. We'll make it again soon!

Loved this. Quick. Easy.  I browned my beef with onion and garlic in a large skillet then transferred to The Big dutch oven... force of habit... I like to see ground beef as it cooks to make sure very thing gets done.

I made the original recipe and really liked it but wanted to add a little more flavor to it so I used diced tomato with garlic, basil, and oregano and I used Ground Turkey to reduce the fat and calories.  I love it and my family and friends do too!

This recipe is actually very simple and very good as written, but I needed a little more 'filling'.  I've made this twice.  I added 2 cups of brown rice the first time and 2 cups of quinoa the second time.  The brown rice is PERFECT!  I also didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used two cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead.

Made this a few times already. I add about 1/2 cup or so of 5-minute white rice at the end just before the cabbage is fully cooked and just let it simmer covered for a few minutes. Also very simple and easy to make.

I used less ground beef (3/4 # for 1/2 large head of cabbage) and more garlic. Also added 1/2 cup of uncooked rice and cooked until rice was done.This was very tasty. Was it the same as cabbage rolls? Probably not presentation wise, but if you like cabbage based dishes and want an fast and tasty meal then this is good.

I changed it just a bit. I used 1 lb of turkey and 1 lb of Italian sausage. I also added more diced tomatoes and 1 cup of rice. Just like my momma's cabbage rolls minus all the roll work. My family loved it!

I made this tonight since I'm trying to low carb.  I don't have a dutch oven and its 100° today so instead of heating up the kitchen, I used my electric pressure cooker. I either added too much water or didn't need it in the pressure cooker.  It's still very yummy!!!!

Made this tonight as an alternative to original Halupki which is a lot of work and takes 2 hours to cook in the oven. The only change I made was to add a packet of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix which I always put in my Halupki, it adds so much flavor!  It saved a lot of work and was delicious!

Very good!!!  As recommended by others, I add a Rice a Roni with spices (Rice Pilaf), about 1/2 cup more water and Cumin!!  It was soooo good!!!  This was my first time, but it seemed to need more spices, so I followed other leads.  Wrong, I know, but it came out sooo good!!!

Loved it! Sooo much easier and flavorful than regular rolls. I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I chopped up some mexican-style stewed tomatoes.. made it sweet and spicy! Serve over rice, delicious!

I added 1 tsp. of paprika, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, and a couple pinches of Italian seasoning to this recipe and we thought it was pretty good.  Using savoy cabbage gives it a slightly different flavor profile that we liked as well.

The new family favorite, so much quicker than stuffed cabbage. A few changes--I used 1 small can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce, used only 1 pound of ground beef, and added 1 tsp of caraway seed and 2 tsp of paprika, which is in my grandma's stuffed cabbage recipe. Also added 3 peeled, diced potatoes. Delicious!!

I made this using Boca recipe crumbles instead of ground beef for a vegetarian version.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added 2 teaspoons of paprika.  The cabbage, onion, and garlic make this   a fabulous alkaline meal!

Don't let the simple ingredients fool you.  This recipe is as outstanding as it is easy. I took other reviewers' advice and added a little paprika and a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning.  When serving it, I added some hot sauce to mine, but my husband ate it as is.  He said that I could tell he loved it because he didn't have to add any salt to it! Just delicious. Oh, and I also added a couple tablespoonsful of bacon grease for some added flavor.

Love this recipe. To make it in a slow cooker, cook for 4 hours on high. Don't cook it too long, or the cabbage gets mushy!

Easy recipe but pretty bland, I had to spice it up a lot. Recommend using tomato paste instead of tomato sauce for a bit richer flavor.

LOVE this recipe! It is amazing. We have made it a few times now. The only thing we change now is adding rice (and water for the rice, obviously) when we add the cabbage, and letting it all simmer until the rice is done.
Tastes great, and even our guests have loved it.

This is an easy, healthy recipe. I used extra lean ground beef and didn't drain after cooking. Instead of water I used a small can of whole stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning. I found it a little bland so I added some red chili flakes, and about 2 tsp each of onion powder and granulated garlic.

I was really wanting to like this recipe. I grew up eating stuffed cabbage. Unfortunately,  this just was not a hit in my home. I have well over half left and believe it may get tossed. Changes I made were using lean meat and cutting the salt back to a 1/2 tsp. The sodium would have been astronomical otherwise. It tasted plenty salty still. It was tons easier than boiling and rolling cabbage. I tasted it when done and it just didn't remind me exactly of stuffed cabbage. I ended up adding a little minute rice at the end. That seemed to do the trick to give it more of that stuffed cabbage flavor. I am realizing, though, what makes the classic dish special is its presentation. It just falls short appearance wise chopped up in a skillet. I am hoping I can turn this into a soup, or something similar, to improve the leftovers.

I have made this several times.  Perfect for a low carb diet!  I have at times, added 1/2 cup instant rice, to bulk it up a bit and then just added some additonal liquid for a great broth!  Also, i tried a green bell pepper as well, gives it a stuffed pepper profile...This is a go to recipe for me!! thanks!!

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband & I both loved it! It cooked a total of 50 minutes. Hubby's taking some leftovers for lunch tomorrow and I'm sure it will be even better then. Followed advice to add paprika and also added some garlic pepper - used low sodium tomato soup and diced tomatoes. Served with mashed potatoes (with skins) and intentionally made them thicker than normal - spread potatoes along one side of large, shallow serving bowl and then cabbage mixture, and a slice of whole grain bread.  Also served with sour cream on the side, a little bit goes a long way, but adds a nice flavor.

I made this and ate the whole pot within a few days! It was amazing. I wasn't sure at first but I took a chance and was not disappointed. My Husband and 2 of my boys will not eat it though. I did not add any other grains to this. It was fine without the extra carbs!

Yes I love this recipe. I used organic chicken sausage in place of beef though and also added a can of Bushes mild chili beans. I used rotel diced tomatoes, the mild one's and it was really good. I added 2 cups of Brown cooked rice, Uncle Ben's, that you place in the microwave for 90 seconds. I served a moist cornbread with this using sour cream, canned mexicorn , Vidalia onion and grated cheese and a can of mild green chiles andJiffy cornbread mix. This is great with this dish.

My manz doesn't eat beef or pork so I used ground turkey & added canola oil to give it a bit of something. He's dieting but I ate mine with mashed potatoes; we're about to fight over the leftovers, lol. I'll be cooking up another batch tomorrow. Great low carb recipe (sans the taters)!

This is now a staple in our house. Yummy, comforting, warm, smells good. We make it as written but also shake it up a bit from time to time (spicy Italian sausage or turkey as the meat). It has never disappointed.

I've made this recipe several times. Hubby and I love it and it's just so dang easy. The only changes I make are one of the cans of diced tomatoes are the kind with diced green chills in them or just add a tablespoon or two to the mix (which really gives it a bit of a kick) and to add a cup of water or broth and a cup of rice.

I've made this several times as is or will add the rice to the pot rather than serving over it.  Sometimes I'll change it up a bit and add a can of mild Rotel tomatoes for some added kick. Add a side veggie, such as green beans, and a pan of cornbread and it's a terrific dinner.

My mother fixed the traditional stuffed cabbage rolls for us growing up and I continued the tradition for my own family.  But I work full-time so making the stuffed variety is too time-consuming most of the time.  I have now made this recipe twice and the whole family loves it--probably much more so than the regular way!  It's full of flavor, kind of a comfort food kind of dish.  I DO recommend adding at least 2 or more teaspoons of salt.  I even added a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning for a contemporary "lift".

I love this recipe! I am the only one in my house that eats it. But it freezes very well, so I can have it whenever I want. Going to try the spiced up version next time.

This was really good. I did as another reviewer suggested and added a cup of beef broth and a cup of rice. Even my cabbage-hating husband liked it. Will definitely be adding to my meal rotation.

If you use a jar of pasta sauce, instead of the canned tomatoes & sauce, it adds a bunch of flavor,  also put some cheese on top before baking !  I have made this many, many times.   If you like red or green bell peppers, add some of those too.

This is the best!!! My Mom lives with me so it is hard for the two of us to eat the whole recipe!! This freezes wonderfully in individual serving portions. We both love it!! I would say everyone should adjust the spices to their individual tastes This is a great basic recipe!!

I replaced the water with vegetable broth and added an extra cup of vegetable broth and 1/2 cup of brown rice.  I probably should have cut back on the salt by 1/2 t or more.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  My family liked this dish.

I love stuffed cabbage. I made this recipe and it was great. I did change a few things. I cooked my onions with salt pork. When done I add the garlic. added salt and pepper with oregano, add the 1 1/2 pd ground beef and 1/2 pd pork cooked until no longer pink. Drained the grease add boilable rice with a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a cup of water. Cover and cooked on simmer. I cooked the cabbage on the side as I have a child who does like cabbage. I will make this again. I have a party coming up.

I used ground chorizo instead of ground beef and fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I gave this 4 stars because if I hadn't used chorizo it seems like it would have been a little bland.  The chorizo added a little spice and kick to the dish, and I thought it was amazing!

Made this today.  It was delicious.  However, there was a lot of liquid that took a long time to boil off.  I'd suggest draining the diced tomatoes and/or eliminating the 1/2 c water.

I have tried this recipe but changed the ground beef to ground turkey. AMAZING!!! I am not a fan of cabbage but this was delicious and so easy to make. You should definitely try it.

Personally, I don't care for tomato sauce. I have used beef or chicken stock instead. I can live without tomatoes too. Try adding peas or corn and a little more rice. Delicious!

My family loves stuffed cabbage rolls, and this is right up there with it! I did make a few changes. I substituted ground beef for ground turkey, and I also switched the water for beef stock for a bit more depth of flavor, and I added quite a bit more seasoning to amp it up. We serve it over rice and have some good bread on the side to soak up the broth. Yum!

We love this dish and add Texas Pete for spice.  I don't add salt because of my issues, but its still got enough in the sauce and diced tomatoes.  Delicious!

This is a great low-carb recipe!  You can keep the rice, sugar and cheese on the side for those counting calories and everyone is happy.  I doubled the garlic and added hot sauce.

I wasn't sure what I was expecting but this was just okay for me.  Not sure if I will make it again.  I served it with white rice and jiffy cornbread.

I made this and like everyone else said, my kids even liked it and it first it was, yuk there's cabbage in it.
Being Italian I put parmesan cheese on everything.  The cheese made it yummy.  Then I put it on rice for the family but I had it without because I limit my carbs.
