This are absolutely delicious! I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. I used half pecans half walnuts and to make them even more hearty I added en extra tablespoon of flax seeds, 2 tbls of chia seeds and 1/4c of unsweetened coconut. Thanks Debbie P for sharing your recipe with us!

These are excellent-I didn't have any flax see so substituted chia seeds. Very tasty, fast and healthy!

Loved it but used honey instead as I didn't have maple syrup on hand.

These are delicious! I love chewy, nutty, seedy snacks. These fit the bill.
I substituted buckwheat flour for all purpose, to make these gluten free.
I also substituted chia seeds for flax seed, because I didn't have flax seed.
These will be a great addition to my favorite recipes. Thank you for sharing, Debbie!
