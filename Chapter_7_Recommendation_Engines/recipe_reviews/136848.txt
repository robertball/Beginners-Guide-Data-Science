This is good...it is very close to a persian dish, a koresh with lamb and quince. Add a little lime juice and balsamic vinegar to compliment the quince.  Quince is considered an aphrodisiac...so enjoy!

We had never tried a quince before, so when I sawy it at our local farm, we thought "what the heck!". I found this recipe (and we LOVE lamb). I made it this week and thought the flavors were really nice together. I did add one chopped up sweet potato (for color and extra yum) and that added a nice splash. I also cut up the lamb into smaller pieces (the cuts were a bit fatty, so I trimmed them down). The lamb turned out tender, the sauce was really nice. We will make this again.

I really liked this. The flavors are subtle; nothing really leaps out and grabs you. It's just a very nice lamb stew that's great served over mashed potatoes or pasta.

Delicious! I'd never heard of quince, and they were a little hard to find, but now that I've tasted them, I'll be using them again! Great recipe for lamb-lovers. Thanks!
