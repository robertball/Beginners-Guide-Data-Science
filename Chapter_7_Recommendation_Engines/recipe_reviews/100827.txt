Inexperienced cooks: Be sure to wrap the springform pan with foil before placing it in the water bath to avoid "bathing" the cheesecake.

Absolutely delicious! I topped it with whip cream and drizzled caramel. It was the hit of my dinner party.

Very good; very very rich! I baked the crust for ten minutes and allowed it to cool before putting in the batter. Also, I didn't let the hot liquid chocolate/caramel cool at all before adding to the cream cheese and it worked fine. I used fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese with no adverse results. Everyone looooved it.

If you follow this recipe to the 'T', it will come out perfect.  It is my most requested dessert, as I have been making this recipe for over a year.  
It is a little on the "overly sweet" side, so I have reduced the sugar amount by half a cup each, too.

This was my first cheesecake, and it came out very well! The flavor was balanced and the cake creamy and smooth. A friend, who is a true gourmet chef, paid me the high compliment of hoarding the leftovers of my cake!

Great recipe!  I have made the crust with chocolate graham cracker crumbs and the cocoa, or just plain.  I do prebake it for 8-10' at 350...Can bake the cheessecake at a lower temp also, just watch for it to be done.  my pans do not leak, so the foil has been unnecessary. Cover with a chocolate ganache or fudge topping of your choice...and decorate.

I am going to be making this for the third time later this week for two birthdays at work (they both requested this recipe). Hopefully this time I will do it correctly, the first two times I screwed up and didn't have the right chocolate (the first time I had picked up unsweetened instead of bittersweet) the second time was a combination of unsweetened and bittersweet.  This time I plan on making it as called for with all bittersweet so I know what it is truly supposed to taste like.  It has been very good so far (with the unintentional changes) so I am sure it will only get better. I would not say it has a distinct caramel flavor, I was expecting more, but drizzling caramel over the top after you slice it has worked out well.

This was by far the best cheesecake.  I used oreos for crust instead and it was great.

My daughter wanted this (Cheese) Cake for her birthday (she gets to pick any cake...its her birthday). Our family loved it. I thought the crust was a little thick and did not use all the mixture, but besides that it was fantastic.

I made this for my Mom on Mother's Day and I picked a good recipe for the occasion.   It's nice and creamy and rich.   Served with caramel and homemade whipped cream makes this very sinful and completely worth it.  I did have issues making the caramel and I threw the first batch away.   I thought it was boiling a little too hard, so I reduced the heat to low for a slower boil.   What happened was the water evaporated and the sugar crystallized.  On the second try, I kept it at a higher heat as the instructions say, and it came out perfect.   The other issue I had was the baking time.   My oven temperature is dead on, and I followed the baking time, but I had to add 15 minutes to the time to get it to set up like it was supposed to.   I have a feeling that the increased bake time was because I used the tinfoil around my pan, just in case it leaked.   I think this may have added an extra layer of insulation.   I wouldn't do that again, I would just make sure my pan didn't leak.  I had prebaked my crust, but I think this wasn't necessary and I wouldn't do that again.   Overall a great recipe and I'm sure I will be making it again.   It isn't that hard of a recipe if you don't over-think it like I did.

In my book, this cheesecake gets a 5 for taste but also a 5 for difficulty.  The cheesecake is awesome -- especially when topped with whipped cream and a caramel drizzle.   Carmelizing the sugar though has been a real challenge.  It seems to dry out and become flaky sugar before browning.  After trying several times, I finally cooked it in a non-stick pan with a lid on it (to retain the moisture) for about 30 minutes.  Then I poured it into a large stainless steel skillet and within a few minutes it was browned. I also had a problem with my pan leaking -- even though I wrapped it in foil.  I discovered I needed the extra large foil so that it can be totally wrapped with one sheet rather than two.   But, I dumped the cheesecake upside down, set it in the fridge uncovered for a day or so and the crust dried out nicely.

I baked the crust first like many others and lost patience with the caramel (wasn't turning golden after an hour ), incorporating it with the chocolate and cream cheese mixture. Baked an additional 10 minutes from stated time and let cool for 3 hours before refrigerating.  Had extra filling and mixed that with almond extract and whipped cream for topping. 
Creamy texture and slight caramel flavor, very rich. My husband, who isn't a desert person, says he would eat this. 
I would make this again, maybe add some chocolate chips.
