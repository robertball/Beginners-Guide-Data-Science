Great recipe, my whole family loved it.
I just added a bit of cornstarch to
thicken the sauce.

I made this, but admittedly tweaked it quite a bit.  First, I seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper.  I cut the butter and oil by about half and doubled the chicken stock and bourbon.  The sauce was very thin so I thickened it with some more chicken stock mixed with corn starch, added 1 t. brown sugar and swirled in 1 T. butter.  I also added sautéed mushrooms.  I changed the cooking method by sautéing my chicken first and removing it from the pan.  Then sautéed the onion and garlic and proceeded with the sauce.   The simmering time given in the recipe is way too long.  Once you’ve browned the chicken, it’s almost completely cooked, so be sure to cut back on the simmering time to maybe 5-10 minutes so your chicken won’t dry out.  I think the changes I made improved this recipe, but it’s still not one I’ll make again.

Excellent recipe...very easy and suprisingly very tasty.  I am not sure why others bashed it.  We are trying it with shrimp tonight.  The sauce is excellent for dipping with bread!

This recipe ROCKS! Everyone I've served this to loves it! Jim Bean bourbon gives an awesome flavor. The only changes I make are to double the chicken stock and bourbon (4 tablespoons each), and to add 3-4 tablespoons brown sugar. Thanks for sharin!

I liked this recipe and used it as a base to start with. I like to have more sauce. I added 1 cup of stock and 3 T of bourbon, 1 tsp of ground ginger, 2 T. of brown sugar and 1 tsp of 
Braggs amino acids (gluten free soy sauce)
Simmer as stated and at the very end add corn starch to thicken.
Delicious! Thanks  Penelope for this recipe.

I was really disappointed in this dish.  It just had no flavor at all.  I doubled the bourbon and chicken broth and reduced after removing the chicken.  Even the sauce itself didn't have much flavor.  I will say this though, it was very tender chicken.

good with rice. My husband really enjoyed it.

First try per directions: Something went wrong!! NO BOURBON FLAVOR!! I let the browned garlic/onions soak in the bourbon/chicken stock mix while browning the chicken. Perhaps the olive oil blocked out the bourbon; allowing it to evaporate while cooking?? I dunno.  I'll look at some other suggestions, try this again--and hopefully solve the mystery and give this recipe a better star rating.

I didn't have any bourbon so I put pale dry sherry in it. Even the kids ate all of it and asked when we were going to have it again. Enjoy!

Didn't work for me.  I didn't think it had much tast to it. Perhaps thickening with cornstarch would have helped.

This recipe was great.  I didn't have any olive oil, so I used all butter (fat free kind).  My husband loved it.  We both scraped our plates clean with bread and he even licked the skillet.  Definitely worth the effort!!!

This didn't taste as I thought it would.  It was a little bland.  Not a WOW for my family but edible.  I have written on the recipe "OK nothing special".  That pretty much summed it up for us.

Even my pickiest eaters LOVE this chicken.  We are big garlic fans in our house, so I added an extra clove to the recipe when I prepared it.  Some of the reviews say it was not flavorful enough, but as long as you season the chicken it shouldn't be a problem.  This dish pairs wonderfully with roasted veggies (we like zucchini and summer squash)  and rice.

Great recipe! My family loved it. You can def taste the bourbon (but no alcohol taste) so make sure you use a decent kind. That may be why others had trouble with this recipe.

I doubled the chicken stock and the bourbon, added a tsp of brown sugar, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I was out of cornstarch so I used flour to thicken the sauce as it was very thin and runny. It was good, but not so good I’d love to have it again. Good, but not fabulous. Worth the try though!

The recipe is unclear and most people who like it altered it. The picture doesn't match the end product. The pic has mushrooms and a brown sauce, but the recipe doesn't include mushrooms or anything that would cause the sauce to be that dark color.  By trying to follow the recipe I wasted all of the ingredients and came out with gross-tasting, over cooked chicken. We made pizza for dinner.

Really good and really easy. The only thing I did different was triple the chicken stock (so it wouldn't burn) and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar as other reviewers suggested. I will add this to my rotation since I usually have everything on hand and it was quick to throw together.

Was excellent.  Easy and relatively quick!  Adjusted servings to “one” since was cooking for myself this evening.  Would add additional liquid next time to increase sauce a bit.  Threw in some split fingerling potatoes when I added the onions and garlic back in - they were cooked perfectly when the chicken was done!  Served with sautéed sugar snap peas.  Superb dinner!

i made the receipe exactly as iits printed and it is NOT at all similar to the picture.  There is NO BROWN GRAVY, it's actually a clear sauce.  No idea if something in the recipe was typed incorrectly.  Tasted pretty good, but don't use the picture as a reference.

My boyfriend and I loved it! In fact he told me to keep this recipe! I cut the recipe in half since I only had two breasts thawed! I did however uses a full clove of garlic and the 2 Tbs of chicken stock! I also seasoned the chicken breast with cracked pepper and Himalayan pink sea salt. Had it with a salad for a healthy delicious meal!

It's a great simple and basic recipe, but a little bland. Need to Double the Bourbon and Broth. I tasted it and decided to add fresh basil, rosemary and oregano from my garden because I needed to prune my crops anyway, so it added more flavor.  I served with mushrooms, broccoli and riced cauliflower, added right into the pan.

Followed the recipe and used Makers Mark Bourbon.  Very flavorless. In no way did it resemble the picture. The picture had mushrooms which the recipe didn’t call for and the sauce appeared dark and thick while mine was light and runny. What a waste of good bourbon

I added more bourbon, cornstarch to thicken the sauce, brown sugar and a pinch of red chili pepper flakes. I'm not sure what gives bourbon chicken it's pretty brown color, but this had more of a tan color. It tasted ok... not super crazy about the flavor.

I tripled the juice to have enough  yet again there is no juice left. And I don't reduce it too much when making this an other recipes. My dishes taste great. But hardly any juice.

With the addition of porchini and white mushrooms it was 5 star flavor.  I also reduced the chicken stock for added ooomph.

Loved it! Although I made it without the bourbon this time, I might add it next time because I will definitely make it again. YUM!

Needed kosher salt. Also use chicken fillets or pound chicken to no more than 1/3 inch thick or it can get a little tough.

Very bland. I salt & peppered the chicken before cooking. The broth isn't the consistency of gravy. What's pictured isn't what you get. I see mushrooms in the pic but they don't mention it in the recipe. Skip this one.

This will be a regular at our house! The flavor is fantastic! The only changes I made was to season the chicken before cooking with salt and pepper, add mushrooms and double the sauce.  I did follow everyone's suggestion to thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.  Do not cook this for 20 minutes in the sauce.  That is too long.  I did less than 15 and next time I will only do 10 minutes.  After browning it is unnecessary to cook it that long.  Try it...You will like it.

It needs more juice to add when putting over rice. I will follow other suggestions and add more broth and whiskey, along with brown sugar and soy sauce. The ones that didn't like it probably didn't cook the alcohol out of the whiskey.

I made this meal last week. the family demolished it. I added alot more broth and bourbon also brown sugar to sweeten more. Cooked with mushrooms and also onions. I also seasoned chicken prior to cooking. I will be adding to my staple of meals.

It was pleasant.  The taste of the Bourbon was a change.  But I wouldn't write home to Mum about it.  In my personal recipe book it goes under the "I work, I get home tired, I have to cook.  I want to eat something quick, easy and tasty".

I really didn't care for this.  The sauce had no character, and couldn't even stand up to the rice I cooked.  I didn't keep the recipe--I'll find something else.
