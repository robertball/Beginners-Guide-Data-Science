The editor changed the original recipe a bit.  I do it this way:  after mixing all ingredients together, let rest 10 minutes (leaving spoon in batter).  Stir vigorously, let rest another 10 minutes.  Do this a total on 5 times instead of the traditional rising.  After the 5th rest, turn onto a floured board and knead lightly (I barely knead at all).  I then shape the loaves and continue as in the posted version of the recipe.  

When shaping the loaves, I will sometimes put a mixture of basil, oregano, garlic, butter/olive oil, and onion on it cinnamon roll style before rolling it for special, pretty garlic loaves.

Delicious, great for bread & butter, or for dips!  However, as I was reading the reviews, I noticed that Liz, who submitted the recipe, gave the proper direction as to how she prepares this recipe (about 9 reviews below this one).  I'm confused Liz, as to why you would go through all of the trouble killing your arm, not to mention taking over an hour of stirring vigorously when you could simply knead it for the 8 minutes, let it rise for the hour & be done!  I prepared this recipe as directed on the site & it came out beautiful!  By the way, I added the 2 cups of water in step 1.  Thanks Liz :), & thanks allrecipes for the modification!!

Superb - moist and chewy, just what french bread should be. I cut the recipe in 1/2 too and it turned out two small round loaves. One small loaf is perfect for one dinner. I used 3 cups bread flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and 2.5 tablespoon olive oil. I dusted one loaf with dried basil/oregano and parmesan and left the other one plain. The herb one went first! So easy and fail safe. Great for beginner bakers.  TIP- Be sure you add the sugar to the water/yeast mixture to help it proof.  Also, after the first rise, punch down the dough to rid of all the air bubbles inside. This will make dividing the dough much easier. No need for a Kitchenaid, this can easily be done by hand. TIP - don't let this rise too long, 1 hour is plenty. If it over-rises, the texture will turn into regular white bread, versus a chewy french bread.

These loaves baked up beautifully- nice and golden.  I didn't have cornmeal, but I dusted the baking pans with a tiny bit of flour, and they turned out fine.  The texture turned out perfect- crusty on the outside, fluffy and soft on the inside.  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for; will definitely make again and again.

Good recipe.  Makes crunchy crust.  I used a mixer and dough hook for mine.  Don't over mix.

First time making french bread and it turned out fantastic!!!!!! Followed recipe exactly. Will be making it often.  I have just made it again for the second time but this time made individual loaves for bread bowls to see if it would work, happy to say they turned out even better than the big loaves!  Will be making "Super Soup Bowls" for Super Bowl Sunday!!!!

I have been trying different breads lately and this is the first that has come out light and not heavy as a rock. The recipe is very easy and could have easily given me 3 loafs of bread. I used honey in place of sugar and olive oil instead of veggie oil. This was fabulous!!

I followed the instructions as carefully as I could. I lined a baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkled cornmeal on the paper. I really didn't know how to seal the seam, and used the egg white to try and glue it. I found out later from reading Julia Child that is not exactley how you seal a seam. My bread turned out exactley like white bread, not really a french loaf. My crust was soft and the insides was soft like white bread. My cooking time was a lot less than 35 minutes. I baked it for 20 minutes and it was burning on the bottom. The top crust looked great though. I checked it with a thermometer and it came out to 198 F, so I took it out of the oven 15 minutes a head of time. During baking the cornmeal and parchment paper was starting to burn. The bottom of the loaf did burn as well and I had to cut off the burned bit, the rest was really good though. This was the first time I ever tried to bake bread. I will try it again. My family enjoyed the bread and it is getting all eaten. The bread cuts very nice and makes great sandwich type of bread. I believe I need to get rid of the bakeing sheets however and next time I'll bake it on stone or ceramic tiles instead of metal. According to Julia  Child there should be a 9x12x2 pan with water on the bottom rack and insert into that pan a very hot rock or brick to make steam for the first 5 minutes of baking. She also suggest spritzing the loaf with a mist of water a few times in the beginning to make crust crunchier.

It is not the recipe's fault if you come out with non-chewy crusted bread!  To achieve the same effect, toss 4-5 ice cubes in the bottom of the oven every 10-15 minutes.  The steam creates that crust you want.

These make perfect loaves for garlic bread/toast. I slice in about 2" thick slices, lay the slices out on cookie sheets and spread each slice with butter and sprinkle with garlic salt. Then I pop the sheets in the freezer until completely frozen. After frozen, the slices can be stored in the freezer in zipper bags. Then you can heat or toast as many as you need for each meal. Its soooo yummy!

I loved this bread!  It is the first bread I have made except for some sourdough that I made years ago.  I cut the recipe in half to test it (using the scaling option) and it worked great.  I used my KA mixer to do the work.  I mixed the yeast, sugar and warm water directly in the mixers bowl and let it work for 10 minutes.  I preheat my bowl by pouring hot water into it and letting it set for a few minutes before adding the yeast mixture.  This seems to work well as the yeast begins to ferment almost immediately.  As one reviewer said, don't over knead.  I think I let mine go a bit too long as the texture was a bit denser than what is on the recipe photo but the bread was great just the same.  I also added a bit more salt as one reviewer said the recipe was bland.  I baked it on a sheet pan sitting directly on my pizza stone.  Had a nice crust all round.

Excellent recipe! I cut all the ingredients in half and made 2 baguettes. I placed a pan of water under the bread during baking and sprayed them occasionally too and they came out nice and crusty!

Not too difficult, very tasty. I ended up making three loaves because I wanted them to be a little skinnier for subs. The third loaf I spread butter and olive oil with herbs and garlic before I rolled the loaf. It turned out fantastic. The leftover plain bread made excellent French toast a couple days later.

I always thought making bread was difficult. Not anymore! I even used all purpose flour and it turned out pretty good. I used half of the ingredients and it was no sweat. We will make it every week, if possible.

incredible! It's amazing to see how this little bit of dough makes a huge quantity of bread! This bread rises so much that you end up falling in love with it like if it were a child you have raised! tastes amazing, and my dad even had a hard time believing I used a normal oven to make it. Tastes great and looks very professional. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!

I halved the recipe (it yielded one large loaf), needed a little more flour, added a little more salt, kneaded in Kitchenaid with dough hook, used olive oil and didn't top with egg wash/seeds, instead basted with water a few times while baking for a crusty crust - and let me tell you it was fabulous!  I was skeptical about the rolling stage, but it turned out just like at the bakery, with a sort of swirl.  Next time I will make two smaller loaves out of half the recipe for a baguette.  YUM!!!

I am living in China, so maybe my flour is not strong enough, but the bread was very nice, but a little "cakey" - if I was to reduce the sugar and oil a little would that help ?

These smelled great, and looked great.  They tasted good, but the crumb was a little more dense than I expected--a little heavier than traditional French bread.  I will try this recipe again, but will follow it according to Liz's note in her review written after the recipe was published.  I wonder if the kneading toughened the dough, yielding the more dense crumb.  I have a feeling her stirring might produce different results.

I absolutely love this bread!  And my husband is always requesting this! As for the kneeding for 8 minutes, I put it in the kitchen aid and use the hook attachment and press go, and set a timer for 8 minutes, and voila- it's done!  All I have to do is push the dough down every once in a while! I've made this a few times and it's delicious!

This is a terrific recipe and even easier when I mixed it in my bread machine.  I followed the rolling out instructions on a cornmeal sprinkled baking sheet.  Before baking, I misted the loaves with water for a crispy crust.  I omitted the egg wash and sesame seeds.  For an even crispier crust, when preheating the oven, I placed a cake pan half full of hot water on the bottom rack.  When the oven was preheated, I popped in the bread and baked it normally.  The crust was absolutely perfect if you like a soft center and a hard crust.  Thanks!

This recipe really is fabulous! Love the taste, texture, aroma, crust--everything! I subbed honey for the sugar and EVOO for the vegetable oil, and I didn't use the egg wash or sesame seeds. Great, easy recipe!

Yammy - this is a great recipe. The Bread tastes sooooo good, you can use it for so many things as side dish BBQ, Breakfast, ...... or make it as a coffecake if you use butter instead oil and fill it with Nut filling... LOVE IT

Turned out fantastic! ... But I halved the recipe, put the sugar in the yeast to proof (seems always turns out better this way), kneaded in my KitchenAid, and brushed the dough with olive oil & melted butter, minced garlic and herbs de'Provence before rolling.  Also skipped the cornmeal and baked on floured parchment paper instead, and had to lower the temp 25 and use 2 baking sheets b/c my new oven is so "efficient."

I make this all the time and it's a household favorite. I have to halve the recipe to use my Kitchenaid stand mixer to knead the dough.

This is the 2nd time that I have made this bread.  I could not ask for anything better.  I love this bread.  It is easy to make.  It rises beautifully, and I have added several flavors to the bread.  The first time I made it I did the first loaf just as french bread.  I did the second loaf as cheddar cheese and jalapeno.  The second time, (see photo).  I did the first loaf as rolls.  I made six rolls.  The second loaf I did  mixing in chopped sun dried tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella cheese.  Yum

These loaves are so versatile.  I made them as directed the first time but decided to get creative with my next batch. Followed the recipe again except to brush olive oil, dried basil, minced garlic and a dusting of parmigiano reggiano before rolling up and the final rise.  The other loaf I spread margarine on the dough and sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg before rolling up for final rise.  Both came out awesome!!  The final time I did the cinnamon and sugar loaf but this time cut them into discs and let them proof before baking.  Melted butter, brown sugar cinnamon and a dash of salt and poured over the finished rolls. My family ate them all immediately and demanded more! Thanks Liz!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I let my bread hook on my kitchenaid do all the work as I added the flour and then had the machine knead the bread.  Bread is very tasty!

The shape of this bread is a little "misleading." It appears as though it is a baguette but, it is really a soft white type of bread. I didn't think it had a whole lot of flavor, and strangely tasted "doughy," even though it rose and baked up well. I wasn't sure why either, but the dough to work with was really sticky! I had to add between 1/2-3/4 of a cup more flour just to make it workable. After talking to someone else who made it I was told they had the same problem, and added at least that much flour or more. I have never had to add that much flour to a bread dough recipe. The bread looked great, just like the picture, but just had too much of an odd "raw dough taste" making it inedible.

Fabulous is the perfect word to describe this!  First of all, this was my first time making french bread and this was the easiest dough I've ever dealt with!  For the first time I didn't have to add more flour.  I found the recipe to be perfect as is except for the cooking time.  This may be because I only had one loaf in the oven, rather than two, but I took mine out at 25 minutes and it was already on its way to being slightly overdone (saved it in the knick of time!).  So keep an eye on it, especially if you half the recipe.  But other than that, it was perfect, especially the crust!

went together well and easy enough to knead, I added 1/4 tsp more salt as others suggested, made and compared it to Jenn Halls Recipe from this site on the same day using same amount of yeast for both (2 pkgs.).  This one was okay in taste, the other far better (crunchier-I threw ice cubes in oven for both recipes, as some suggested, and flavor better than my favorite bakery) Have to say jenn's recipe a little harder to mix as I don't have a kitchen aid machine. Her dough seemed heavier but hands down the family picked it "Blind taste test"!!! I don't need to give this another shot

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what but it was soo sticky. I had to keep adding flour again and again to even get it off my fingers.  It actually turned out well and tastes pretty good but it was so frustrating that it didn't feel like bread dough should.  I will try again - see if maybe I just messed it up so will put it at a neutral 3 for now.

BEST french bread I have ever tasted!!  I used one loaf for the overnight french toast and it was YUMMY!!  The first time I made this I made them into french loaves.  The second time I rolled out the bread and rolled it up the short way and put them into 2 bread pans.  This is my new everyday bread recipe.  Not one bit dry even after a week!!!

This is a great beginners' bread.  It turns out wonderfully every time for me.  I follow the recipe exactly most of the time.  I don't always have sesame seeds.  The more you bake it the better it always turns out.  It makes four loaves for me which means I always give away 2 or 3 loaves and people love it.  :D  I recommend this recipe to everyone, especially beginners. Also wanted to add that I do knead this to a stiff dough and it really is fabulous.

This was a bakery style French bread, if you steamed your oven (I put ice cubes in a cast iron skillet). Very crusty and good flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because it's a little quicker than my standby French bread recipe. But I am sad at the outcome of this recipe; it just didn't work for me.  I didn't get the rise I expected; the dough spread and looked more like foccacia (and yes, my yeast was fresh).  The flavor was very good, the crust was beautiful.  If I should ever try this again, I think instead of making two loaves, I'll make 4, and make them narrower. To make steam for a crustier crust, I heated a cast iron skillet on a lower rack while preheating my oven.  When it was ready, I put in the dough and then added ice cubes into the skillet.  Voila!  Steam.

This made two large fabulous loaves of bread! Crispy crunchy crust and a very soft tender center. Reminded me of white sandwich bread in the middle it was so moist and soft. I couldn't get bread flour at the store all they had was all purpose, so I used my favorite (White Wings by C H Guenther & Son, Inc. out of San Antonio). I'm no pro baker, just a home cook, but DH and I loved this bread so it worked out for me. This was so simple, mostly all it takes is time. Thanks so much for sharing this Liz. Mmmmm Mmmmm Good!

The best recipe for french bread!!! My loaves didn't look sloppy like in the pictures posted. The were perfect! Looked like a store-bought bread, but tasted way better. I followed the recipe to a T. The 2 loves were gone in 2 days! Love it and I am going to make it again!

My whole family LOVED this bread.  I did not use sesame seeds but I did brush on a VERY thin layer of egg wash.  As it turns out, even that wasn't necessary.  Also, I used olive instead of vegetable oil.  Like others, I spritzed the bread every 5 minutes or so (only had to bake it for 25 minutes) and the crust came out perfectly crisp while the inside was soft and not too dense at all.  We had half a loaf eaten before I ever got dinner on the table.  I can't wait to make this again as we didn't have any leftovers tonight and I'm anxious to use the finished product to make French toast and garlic bread.  Awesome!

This bread was very good- but i would say that its more of a supermarket french bread and not a parisian bakery french bread- this is not a baguette with a thick crisp crust and tender inside- it has a softer crust and is chewy inside. But, that doesnt mean its not good- it is very yummy. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil in the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly.

Thirty years ago I made French Bread regularly. This recipe is much easier than my old one. I never use bread flour so used plain and I used olive oil.  Mainly I wanted to see if these old hands could still knead dough. Good recipe Liz! Will make this again.

This bread is increadible!! I've made it numerous times now, and it usually comes out just a bit better with each improvement.  Like suggested, I added a bit more salt, used olive oil, and every once in a while I just use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour if I ran out.  It still comes out great (although bread flour is definately superior).  I added a little bit of garlic powder to the dough, it comes out even better that way.

Even better than Blue Ribbon White Bread (this site) and I like that one, nevertheless a good variety. Kneaded as usual (no spoon). First time I tried this, it was quite dense and slightly salty and didn't like the egg white wash, so this time around I added an extra pack of yeast and reduced salt to 3/4 tbls, didn't bother with the 'wash' and seeds; used soft brown sugar instead, and buttered the tops of the loaves hot out of the oven.  I used instant yeast which you add straight to the flour; the 2 cups water has the same warmth as the 1/2 cup. Ended up with 2 scrumptious, butter softened yet crusty loaves with a tender and less dense but still a heft to them; good bread. Thanks to all, for sharing useful tips. 12/2/04: Changing from 4 to 5 stars. Successfully baked wholemeal loaves too, using half plain and half wholemeal flours. Excellent.

Very good bread. I have made it almost every week now.  I found I don't like the egg wash on it. It still is good with out, just not as crusty.

I FINALLY found a recipe for French Bread that hasn't turned out like a baseball bat! This bread is wonderful and the dough pulls together beautifully.  I used this to make French Dip Sandwiches from this website, and it was divine.

I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, and I also will make sure to oil the pans before adding the cornmeal, as they did stick some.

I used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook to do the majority of the work for me and I hardly had to knead the bread at all.  My only suggestion would be to add a tad more salt to this recipe to bring out the flavors more.  I also brushed the loaves with milk instead of egg, because I prefer a slightly softer crust.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I've tried multiple bread recipes, but this one is by far my favorite! It has a nice crust and a perfect crumb- chewy yet tender. It slices easily without falling apart. I make a really taste variation where I use extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and add in a glove of garlic (mashed with some salt to make a fine paste) and 7-8 basil leaves torn into small pieces. I also brushed the loaves with a little more olive oil before baking. Not only does the final product look great, it tastes great too!

This french bread was amazing! Much lighter than many other recipes I tried. I will try adding spices next time to see how it turns out.

My first attempt at making bread (loaves) and they turned out BEAUTIFULLY! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I followed it to a T and the results were phenomenal. I'll be making this often. :)

This bread was sooo easy & good!!! I was making from scratch meat sauce for my spaghetti dinner & realized I forgot to pick up a loaf of french bread so I found this & oh boy was it good!! The house smelt wonderful too while it baked!
I cut the recipe in half & made exactly as written except I didn't have cornmeal (realized that when it was too late) So I sprinkled the baking pan with flour instead & it worked fine. I also sprayed some olive oil pam on the loaf instead of the egg white & then sprinkled parm cheese on top since I didn't have sesame seeds. I will definitely be making this again!

Always a pleaser.  Have been using this recipe for years and just haven't gotten around to reviewing.  My Kitchen Aid Mixer broke, so I've been using a half recipe in the food processor.  Still wonderful!

Thank you!! First time I made anything with yeast, was very nervous.  The recipe was very easy and the loaves came out great! Perfect on the outside and inside.  Big Hit w/ the kids. Made pizza bread for them and they loved it. Going to try this as a pizza crust, will let you know how it goes.

Make sure loaves cool completely; if put away slightly warm, the nice crust texture is ruined.

Very delicious.  This was my first try making bread from scratch and it was very easy. Halved the recipe for only one loaf and it still turned out both visually pleasing, and great tasting.

This is a great recipe! I just received a French bread loaf pan for my birthday, and was eager to try it out! This looked like a great, simple recipe to try out. It worked perfectly! I didn't change anything, except I skipped the cornmeal (it didn't work...my pan is the type with tiny holes on the bottom, and the cornmeal wouldn't have stuck) and I also skipped the sesame seeds, mostly because I forgot about them :) The only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of salt...I felt that it was a bit much. The bread was great, though...with an awesome, soft texture and a crispy, crackly crust, which was probably because of the pan. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll be making it again!

To make this recipe more simple, I didn't roll the dough out. Instead, after I let the dough rise the first time, I made to halves and stretched each to 12 inches. Then I let them rise a second time without even covering them, till 2x in size. They turned out wonderfully. Next time I might put cornmeal on the sides of the dough out. There was one part that stuck to the cookie sheet.

Wonderful french bread, nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. I used my mixer to mix it instead of by hand and it was so easy and came out perfect.

I halved this recipe and made in my bread maker. The inside was wonderful---great flavor, great texture! My only complaint might be that the crust was really, really tough. But that could be my bread maker, and the recipe wasn't meant for a bread machine so I have to be fair and give 5 stars.

All I really have to say is mmmmm... After reading the reviews here, I added 1 extra teaspoon of salt and put a pan of ice cubes on the bottom rack to mist the bread. I did do the egg wash, but I did half egg whites with half milk, as I like a bit more of a tender crust. I also brushed the loaf with melted butter half way through baking, which made for great flavor and beautiful browning. Check on this bread after about 20 minutes in the oven, because mine was completely done after 25.

this bread is okay, but it's more like grocery store italian bread. when i think of "french bread" i think of crusty, chewy french baguettes, and this bread is not that. still okay, my six-year old likes it...

Absolutely the BEST BREAD EVER!  I am a novice bread maker, and it was SO easy. It was crusty on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  Wonderful texture.  I will be making this ALL the time!  I made the recipe exactly as is, but did spritz with water halfway through.

I halved this recipe to make 2 thin baguettes (served with Chicken Breasts Pierre from this site).  Mixed the dough in the mixer with the dough hook -- couldn't have been easier.  Eliminated the egg wash/sesame seeds, instead took the advice of several skilled bread bakers and 'basted' the bread with water every so often as it baked.  That produced a perfectly brown and crunchy crust with a tender middle.  Thanks so much!

My skills with yeast breads are notoriously bad, much to my chagrin.  But I keep trying, and I finally scored a winner with this recipe.  I made three loaves instead of two, and they urned out the most glorious, golden-brown, smooth-textured, chewy-crusted, delicious loaves of french bread ever.  They even rivaled my mom's best, according to the family (and she is very skilled with french bread).  I couldn't be prouder- the family keeps raving about the bread-  I've made it three times in 2 weeks, and with great results each time.  Thanks!

I halved the recipe and used a bread machine on dough setting to mix and knead the dough, then baked it on a cookie sheet.  The dough was very sticky and hard to roll out, so I just kind of plopped it on the cookie sheet and arranged it into a cylinder as best as I could.  It made up in taste what it lacked in looks -- yummy!  I'll still give it 5 stars because I don't know if the stickiness was the fault of the bread machine or the recipe.

My family and I all loved this bread.  It looks so pretty too.  If you want a crispier crust, you can always mist it every 5-7 minutes with a spray bottle or bake it on a pizza stone.  I like the texture of the crust just the way it is.  I chose not to do the spoon mixing thing.  I kneaded it like normal, although I did find it pretty sticky dough and had to keep adding flour to the counter and my hands to keep it from sticking.  It didn't hurt a thing.  It proofed up beautifully.  We couldn't wait to get it out of the oven and try it.  It only needed to bake for 25 minutes and it was perfect.  If in doubt, it should read 195 degrees on a thermometer.  A little more salt would probably make it even better.  But great stuff!  Will definitely make it again.

This is one of the best recipes I have found.  It was easy to make with a dough hook.  My family loved it so much that I made it twice in one week.

Delicious!  The crust did not turn out as crunchy as a true "baguette", but it was certainly exactly what I get in the stores.  I used some baguette pans to give the loaves a nice shape and went with a longer second rise for less density.   It turned out great.  Good recipe!

I just threw everything in the bread maker and put it on the dough setting.  Then formed loaves and let rise 30 minutes before baking. Loved it!  Will make many more times.

Love this recipe. Made with wholemeal chapatti flour. Best bread I have ever made. Used a mixer with dough hook, then kneaded for a couple of minutes.

I was making Homemade Hamburger Buns while making this recipe. I accidently added 1 egg, 3T sugar, and only 1 1/4 salt in the bowl. Needless to say, my bread expanded more than expected. The crust was still hard and chewy while the inside was nice and fluffy. With the accidental modifications, it was still great. Last of all, I did sub the water with whey but this is usual for me. Served with Chicken Breasts Pierre

Great recipe! I used 3 cups whole wheat flour and 3 cups bread flour. Then rolled fresh roasted garlic and white cheddar cheese inside one, and then topped it with some more cheese after the egg wash. Turned out devine!

The best french bread I have ever made. My husband is in love with it! I used a mixer and dough hook. This bread rises beautifully and when baked, is nice and light on inside with a crunchy outside.

I have been on a quest for the best french bread recipe this past month, and this one nails it. I'm not sure what made it different - the oil, which wasn't a part of some other recipes? The directions on how to roll it out? All I know is that this is delicious, with just the kind of crust I've been looking for. The search is over!

My bread is pretty good but I definitely should have gone with my gut and pulled them out at 25 minutes instead of letting it go until 30.  My bread got a little bit past golden brown and has a tough crust that i'm not crazy about.  I can't even imagine if I had let it go any longer.

Awesome! I added just a little more sugar and salt than was called for, and sprinkled a little kosher salt on top. My family loves it. I make it about once a week.

I've tried many recipes and this one is the best tasting and never fails me, always comes out perfect. Be sure to mix your dry ingredients first, then add the wet. The half cup water for your yeast should be warm and the two cups water for your mix should be cool (both from tap water temperatures). From the six cups of flour, reserve 1 cup on the side from your dough mixture. You're going to mix it mack in when kneading the bread. If you don.t have a pizza stone, turn over a cookie sheet and place parchment paper over it. The recipe works great with regular flour too.

Yay! I made this bread to go with a pasta dish for dinner and it was very easy to put together. I did have to add a bit more flour in order to handle the dough. Perhaps because I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. Whatever, the bread turned out beautifully, was delicious dipped in homemade Italian dressing and received rave reviews from my husband. Made my meal even more special.  :c) Thanks Liz, I won't be spending any more money at the grocery store bakery for French bread!

Used this recipe to make bread for the very first time, and it turned out fabulously! The instructions walked me right through it and I didn't have a single problem, although I kept expecting something to go horribly wrong. Found that it rose incredibly well (doubled in 40 minutes) when left on the counter beside a pot simmering on the nearby stove. Served it with a homemade spaghetti sauce, and was a total hit with the guys!

I chose this recipe, in part, due to the fact that it was not a bread machine recipe.  I don't have a bread machine, but this recipe was so easy, I wondered what I could possibly need one for.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I havled it and only made one loaf, and I did not add the seeds (but I did use the cornmeal).  As I said before, I did not use a bread machine, and I did not use a stand or hand mixer either.  I made it completely with my own two hands.  I did not have a difficult time incorporating my flour or kneading.  My dough rose beautifully, and baked up perfectly in exactly 35 minutes.  It had a lovely, crunchy crust and I did not mist anything, use a bowl of water, or throw ice cubes in my oven.  I agree that this looked more like a loaf of Italian bread, but I thought it did taste like French bread.  I bet you could form your loaves thinner to look more like a traditional French bread if you want to.  This recipe gets five stars from me for ease, clear directions, and a gorgeous end result!  My boyfriend loved it, and right after dinner, asked me to pack some up so he could take it to his mother!

Halved the recipe and the dough was very sticky. Had to keep adding flour to achieve the right consistency. The bread baked beautifully though, texture was great. However, the bread lacked flavor, really bland, perhaps I needed to add salt to compensate for the extra flour....?

Not sure if anyone has already stated a definitive hypothesis, but I'm pretty sure that the texture problems (large crumb) are due to All Recipe's modification of the recipe. If you've read the submitter's review that explains the original instructions, the dough is supposed to be stirred over various periods of an hour. However, as I just noticed when I prepared the dough, the All Recipes version calls for the dough to be kneaded which requires a great deal more flour. This is why people are complaining about sticky dough and the need for 1-2 cups extra flour than is called for in the ingredient list. The "stick" problem wouldn't be a factor if you just had to stir as opposed to knead. Now, I am making the dough today for sub-style sandwiches, so I didn't mind if the texture was more dense. Thus, I chose to prepare it by kneading this time. The next time I am looking for a more "authentic" French bread, I will try the original method and update my findings here! Test this out and see if I'm right! Hope this helps.

This has to be the most user friendly bread recipe ever.  I've made it in the form of French bread loaves, as well as a white sandwich bread.  I put the dough in bread pans for the second rise, and let it go just above the edge.  Baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and it was perfect.  Nice texture, very soft and moist.  I like the taste and texture better than any standard white bread recipe that I've tried before.

Delicious french bread!  We devoured the first loaf and used the second one to make bread pudding.  This recipe is a keeper.  I omitted the sesame seeds.

This is a great recipe. I have made this bread several times, and have consistently received rave reviews from family and friends. I have stopped using sesame seeds (because my daughter is allergic to them) and the bread still tastes great.

Easy to make and tasted great, although I just added the 2 cups to the 1/2 cup of water for the yeast. Highly recommended!

This is a great recipe.  If I had more time each weekend, I'd never buy bread again.  I ended up making the 2 loaves and coated one with sesame and salt, and the other with garlic powder.  I'm looking forward to adding different herbs to the mix in the future.  
Update:  I've made several loaves and one thing I've learned is when letting the dough rise, put it in the oven with a cup of boiling water.  This creates an ideal warm and humid environment.  Another great tip is to premix any dry ingredients in with the flour ahead of time.  Lately, I've taken 1 or 2 tbsp of rosemary and garlic powder and added it to the flour ahead of time.  Next on my list - shredded asiago cheese....i love this recipe!

This was a beautiful, economical bread to make and it impressed my guests to the MAX!  It was so easy to make and so scrumptious we devoured one whole loaf, hot out of the oven with real butter, and almost forgot about the rest of the meal!

I should say that I added 1 tsp sugar to the yeast and water mixture to begin with (because I've never heard of making bread with only yeast and water  - I've always put in a bit of sugar to get the yeast started), and I had no cornmeal and no sesame seeds, but the bread was still wonderful: very crunchy crust and very lovely texture on the inside.  It made two quite large loaves - beautiful!

I halved this and made it in my bread machine (because im lazy!!). I added a clove of garlic after reading other reviews. I found the crust very crispy. The bread inside the crust was very light and fluffy. Definitely a winner here.

The name says it all "fabulous".  The loaf comes out just like the fresh baguette they sell here daily at the major chain grocery.  Didn't know it was possible to make it myself at home.  Thanks for a great recipe!

this is bread, and it isn't bad, but it's nothing special and doesn't seem much like traditional french bread. i won't make this again, i think i'll keep looking.

Excellent flavor and texture!  As other reviewers suggested, I misted the oven a few times during baking.  It's a little higher in fat than other recipes, but the flavor is rich and satisfying.

These tasted exactly like commercial, frozen loaves: a  bit bland and mediocre.  Although not a bad recipe, I probably will look for something else with more flavor.

I've been baking bread for years and decided it was time to try a new french bread recipe.  I was not disappointed.  The loaves were so tender and delicious.  I must confess, I whacked off a hunk of crust fresh out of the oven and enjoyed it without butter.  The bread stood alone.

This was wonderful and I will be making it all the time!  I made the dough in my bread machine and it came together perfectly--I am far too lazy to make bread by hand!!  I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving out the sesame seeds.  The texture is perfect, crunchy on the outside, with a soft and tender inside.  It goes great with everything, we have eaten it with pasta, I have made po'boys with it, it's even good warm with butter on it for a snack!  Very versatile bread that  will become part of my permanent rotation!

This is my first time at making a bread such as this.  I cut the recipe in half since it is only my husband and I.  This is such an easy recipe to follow and the result is a beautiful loaf of bread that you can actually say that you made yourself.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe:)

I LOVE this recipe! I make it all the time for family get-togethers, and people are always asking for the recipe. I never use sesame seeds, and I only cook for 25 minutes (I bake both at the same time and switch after 15 minutes). The inside is so soft and wonderful, and the outside is perfectly crusty! I do usually end up using about 6 1/2 cups of flour instead of 6, though, because I hate kneading dough that's too sticky. It turns out exactly the same...perfect!

This bread has a nice taste and texture, but it lacks the crisp crust of French bread.  It's easy to make, although additional flour is required (as it often is in breadmaking.)  Overall I was pleased with the results.

This turned out pretty good, but it turned out like the loaves of french bread that I avoid buying at the grocery store. It didnt have the gourmet bakery look and taste, However, it was pretty good on the first day and for french toast the second day.

My family ate both loaves in an evening all the while asking if I actually made them from scratch!  Excellent recipe I didnt change a thing.  I used my kitchenaide hook to knead  the dough for about 8 min.  GREAT!!

This is a great french bread recipe that I tried initially because my last name is the same as the recipe submitter!  But I have used it many, many times, and always in my breadmaker.  To do so, I cut the recipe in half and omitted the extra water that it calls for in proofing the yeast.  Just add the ingredients to the bread maker as you would any other bread machine bread.  I have had great luck with it, especially when I've used 14% protein flour from a local whole foods store.  Thanks, Liz, for a great recipe!

Great recipe.  I used it for bread bowls.  In my opinion it needs a little salt but that's such a personal preference I think the recipe is a great 'standard.'

Great bread, very simple and straight forward.  I didn't include the egg wash or he sesame seeds because I didn't have any sesame seeds.  But I will certainly make this again, one of the few recipes I give 5 stars for!  Thanks so much!

I never do the sausage roll thing.  It's fine just in regular french loaf rolls.  
So yummy!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it repeatedly.  Thank-you thank-you!!!  I don't use the egg wash or the sesame seeds on top; it doesn't really need them.  This recipe is also very easy for beginner bread makers.

This bread turned out heavy, with a soft crust. Will not make again,French bread is supposed to be crusty and not as heavy.

This was a very easy to make and very delicious bread.  I made a southwestern bruschetta with it.  I got rave reviews.  I chopped up a Mango, a couple hot peppers, an onion, some cilantro and an avocado, squeezed a lime over it all and sprinkled some salt.  I made the bread, cut it fresh out of the oven into slices, put a mix of garlic juice and olive oil on it, broiled it a few min and added some Jack cheese.  Once I took it out of the oven, I arranged it and piled the salsa on top of it.  It was soo good.  This bread was good by itself with butter and dipped in vinegar and oil too.  8 people ate  from this loaf, and all had good things to say.

P.S. This is MUCH easier to make in your breadmaker (on the dough cycle) or with a stand mixer.

This is the best bread I've ever made. One thing some many may find helpful is to use "Best for Bread" flour, which I did, and which made the bread rise much higher than past attempts (but with other recipes). My bread was better than the bakeshop. I mean that.

I've come back to add to my review: I used olive oil and made a pizza crust with this. It's better than Jay's Signature Crust! 

500 degree oven to cook it on pizza stone after letting rize on the stone a bit. Best pizza I ever made by far.

This recipe was excellent. It took longer than the recipe calls for to make, but well worth the wait.  It's yeast bread, what do you expect? I didn't use a spoon, used my hands, it was easier to mix that way. Overall, I liked this recipe and will make it again.

I had a hard time with consistency of the dough and it seemed to turn be very watery. Also, it came out a bit dense. It was a few months since I have made bread, so that didn't help. By the time the loaves were ready to slip into the oven, they looked perfect. I had company from Hawaii, so it was a huge relief to serve great bread. Thanks!

Nice and easy recipe, and the finished product is delicious.  I always make the two loaves from the recipe and include the decorative cuts, as it adds a little flair to the loaves.

This certainly LOOKS somewhat like a loaf of French bread, and it sounds tasty, but it IS NOT French bread.  French bread is made from flour, water, salt and yeast – and nothing else. The addition of sugar and oil/fat makes this more like an Italian loaf of bread, but it’s not French — more like grocery store French bread. Good? – probably.  French? – no.

Excellent to slice and use for garlic bread with pastas and to make big hoagies.  We also used it to dip in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar .   My family Loved it.

Both came out DELICIOUS!

I too followed recipe to the letter. My yeast was new, that was ok. I found it ok to eat, but nothing like French bread. Would of liked a better rise. I will try one more time. Maybe raise in the fridge overnight and bring it back to room temp. and bake.

I am usually skeptical on new bread recipes so I did 1/2 the recipe. I used all purpose flour and the rise and proof stages the dough was happily warm. Even just 1/2 the recipe produced a substantial size loaf. I topped with a bit of dried parsley and basil just before putting  in the oven. My home had that fantastic smell of fresh bread. Recipe is fantastic!

No changes.. It was a picture perfect loaf, fine texture, perfect softness and a taste my friend said was as good as the bread we had from bakeries in Greece just recently.  My only reason for rating it only a four was because I had hoped for a crispier crust.  I even used the technique in french bread where you spray a light coat of water late in the baking and let it bake some more.  It was also coated with a very light coast of vegetable oil.  Next time I make it I am going to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I'm not sure what to do to make it crustier.  Don't let that deter you though.  It is still a wonderful loaf.

This is a great recipe. Best one I've used, it's gone in to my recipe book. Anyone who gave it one star clearly didn't make it right.  Very delicious.

Easy and delicious! The only thing I did differently was I used my stand mixer to knead the dough.

This was good, not the best French bread I've made, but still good.  The texture inside was almost like white bread and the outer crust could have been more chewy.  Like others did, I I think misting with water while baking might help with that.  Taste was about a 4 out of 5 as well.  Makes great bread pudding!!

This is an awesome recipe! I followed it the way it is posted, and it came out perfectly. This was the first time I have made any type of bread, and I think this was a great recipe for beginners. Very easy to follow and tastes great!

Perfect French bread!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written but I made one large loaf and two smaller ones (by dividing one of the half'a of dough in half again).  It's better than any bread we ever tried.  This recipe is very easy, you can make it just over two hours from start to pulling out of the oven.  I'll be impressing future guests with this one!  We will never buy French bread again!  Thanks for sharing!

I made it exactly as suggested. This is now my go-to white dinner bread. It is delicious, has a nice crumb and challenges all who eat it to stop after one piece. It cannot be done! I've made it multiple times and it is consistent every time.

Very easy and great recipe, this recipe is so amazing you can do changes. I added  brown sugar instead of white and added it with the yeast and warm water. By my experience it helps activate the yeast further. I skipped the egg white and sesame seeds.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I did not use cornmeal. I baked them in loaf pans with olive oil. I know I did a few changes but this recipe is a great jumping start. 
**I baked one loaf normal. 
***I had roasted garlic that I had baked while the dough was resting. I squashed the garlic into a paste. I then rolled out the other half of my dough spread the roasted garlic paste and rolled it tightly and baked in a loaf pan. Yummy goodness !

This is my go-to recipe for French Bread.  I have a KitchenAid stand mixer which makes it even easier.  I also bought  two French Bread pans.  Before I bought the pans the loafs used do flatten out.  Now they are perfect.  When you roll out the dough you can add flavor by sprinkling parmesan cheese or garlic powder then roll up the dough.  Enjoy.

Excellent, easy to follow recipe makes two delicious and crusty loaves. I substituted rosemary for the sesame seeds for more of an Italian flavour. This is a keeper!

I've used this recipe for over 6 years.  My family makes way in the oven for it every time.  I skip the cornmeal, egg white and sesame seeds.  I also weigh my flour 5 ounces to a cup and usually don't use all the water.

I've made this twice and it came out delicious both times. I did change one thing though,  I dissolved the sugar in the warm water then added the yeast.  I have no idea if that makes a difference but that's how I've always done it with other bread recipes.  It turned out just right so either it helped or it makes no difference lol.

This French bread recipe is practically fool proof! Sooo delicious! This was my first attempt at any bread, and it came out perfect. The next day I made a french toast bake with what was left over. Highly recommend to all to do the same! I'll never buy French bread from the store again.

I gave this recipe to my 13 year old daughter to bake. I am teaching her to cook from scratch and bread is her favorite thing so far. Granted it was made by a child, but other than the heaviness, it was quite good. I had her make more and took it to work, and it was gone in no time flat. Will try a few of the suggestions in the comments to see if we can't get it a bit lighter.

I cut this recipe in half, since we didn't need that much bread and it turned out perfect.  I only had all purpose flour on hand, so I used that.  I also was able to make two small loaves instead of one long one and only had to cook it for 20 mins.  Def a keeper!

This is a great recipe!!  It was easy to make and tasted fantastic!!  I did add a little more flour than it asked for but that is because it was too sticky.  Sometimes the humidity in the air can make your bread dough fluctuate like that.  Other than that I didn't make any changes.  My husband was sure sad he missed out on this dinner!!

This came out great! The flavor was nice and the loaves came out soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. I did add some honey to the dough and spread honey on the loaves and sprinkled with sesame seeds before baking it. Beautiful! Thanks!

This was the first time I have ever made a bread like this and I found the directions really easy to follow. I did put both loaves onto one pan which was a mistake. At least for the size I made mine. They ended up rising so they were touching each other and cooked that way. All I had to do was cut them apart and they still tasted amazing. The crust was so crunchy and perfect! Next time I think I will make them into smaller loaves or lots of little ones!

Delicious bread, had a great texture and flavor. I even added in a tablespoon of garlic powder while it was still mixing (I LOVE garlic) which gave it a great flavor. 

I will make one comment about my experience with the recipe: I made four small loaves instead of two regular loaves, because I wanted to be able to give a couple away. Now, it may just be my oven (it tends to heat hotter than labeled), but even after I adjusted for the mislabeled temp and the smaller loaves, my loaves were browned and nearly baked within 15 minutes. I had to turn the oven down to about 350 and let them bake for another 8 mins or so because I wanted to be sure the inside was done. At the end of all of that, it had the perfect texture & flavor, so I guess next time I'll crank the temp down a bit more so they don't brown too quickly.

Too much kneading, need to leave the bread alone after you have kneaded it after first rise, after adding all the ingredients. Then directly into the oven. Or else the bread gets waay to heavy. Almost inedible.

Very nice-tasting, soft bread. Not anything like French bread, however; closer to a supermarket Italian loaf. That said, very quick and very easy!

Once it got too hard to mix I floured my hands and used my hands to "stir". Only needed 5.5 cups of flour- divided evenly between whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour; it turned out great!

I doubled the recipe and made 8 baguettes. I also added two tablespoons minced garlic. Very good French bread.

After looking at many reviews I had decided to try Liz's french bread recipe.  I am so happy that I did (the family too...)!  I followed her directions exactly as written.  When the bread came out of the oven, it was a beautiful golden brown, crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  A wonderful recipe that is definitely a keeper!  Thank you Liz!!!

Thank you thank you for this recipe! I have never reviewed a recipe but just had to comment. I have never been successful in my bread-baking attempts until now! Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and all was perfect! --Cannot thank you enough:-)

I made this in essence just as it was written. I only baked it for 30 minutes and it seems to be quite done. I also had neither cornmeal nor sesame seeds but they weren't missed. I will probably add them next time though as that sounds good. Great recipe, thank you.

I'm not a great bread maker and it's something I've always struggled with so I went into this with low expectations.  I halved the recipe and only made 1 loaf just in case.  Boy was a I regretting that!  This was so good.  I made it with the American Lasagna on this site and it was literally gone after one meal.  I will be making this again for my stepdad's birthday this weekend.  So so good!

I like this recipe.  It's great, it doesn't come out as fluffy for me, but more dense.  My husband loves it and so does my son. The simplicity of it makes it an ease to make.

Well, I had two different french bread recipies printed from this site and started making one of them.  After the ONE packet of yeast had dissolved, I then continued by making this one.  I didn't realize what I had done until after the dough had risen for an hour and I didn't really expect it to turn out with only half the amount of yeast it was supposed to have.  The loaves didn't rise too much the second time, so I put them in a warm oven with a pot of boiling water and they grew to just the right size.  I spritzed them with water before baking and then two more times within the first ten minutes to ensure a crispy crust.  The texture of the bread was just right and I'm anxious to try it again, but with the right amount of yeast next time.    :)

OMG I LOVE this recipe!!  I had never made bread before and I was told not to expect it to turn out on my first try, but it turned out wonderful.  I cut the recipe in half and made as stated, with the exception of the sesame seeds which I left out.  Definitely a keeper!!!  I only baked for 25 minutes - 35 minutes would have been too long.

I love this bread.  Its fairly easy to make with the kitchenaid mixer.  I follow the directions for no bread machine that someone was so nice to post.  Even makes for great garlic bread the next day or the day after that.

Moist, a little dense, but soft! I substituted warm milk for the 2 cups water. Also, be sure to use more sugar and salt in this recipe. I think next time, I'll make it as a normal sandwich loaf, the texture is perfect for sandwiches. Also, be very wary of the baking time... mine was done perfectly in 19mins.

This is very good.  Made one loaf for the breakfast sausage bread on the site and then made the other loaf as directed for a dinner for a friend.  So didn't try it as directed, but very good bread in the sausage bread.  I didn't do an egg wash--just a wash of water, and it was really brown.  Even took it out 7 min earlier, so I would recommend you watch and base it more on your oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! I used olive oil instead of veggie oil, and I didn't do the egg wash and sesame seeds. I didn't have cornmeal, but I did use some wheat germ instead. I halved the recipe and it made one beautiful nice sized loaf. Thank you!

This was my first time baking bread though, so it wasn't perfect. I halved the recipe, and I baked it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees and it was close to burning. The bread came out soft and fluffy inside though.

Absolutely the best french bread.  No more buying it at the grocery store.  So easy and delicious.  I accidentally cooked it at 450 degrees for 18 minutes and it turned out perfect.  I also halved the recipe and made one huge loaf.  I did find the dough to be a little sticky, so I rolled the dough out on wax paper sprayed with Pam.  It didn't stick at all and rolled up perfectly.

I think this is a pretty good recipe, but my bread was way too risen. I used quick-rise yeast and I think that the recipe should be made with "normal" yeast.

These loaves came out great! I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, and all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. I used my KitchenAid mixer with dough hook to mix and knead the ingredients - maybe added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I did add a little extra salt (after reading some reviews), and didn't need to use the egg white on top. I baked for about 28 minutes, and covered with foil while they cooled, to soften the crust (I prefer a more chewy crust).  I'll definitely be making these again.

It came out beautiful. It was so light and fluffy that I couldn't help eating several pieces before we had dinner! The only thing I didn't like was the taste. It was fair, but nothing extraordinary. I think it might have been the egg white that tainted the taste. It was very good overall though.

I make this bread all the time. Everyone loves it- it tastes BETTER than french bread from the store. Sometimes I sprinkle the unbaked loaf with rosemary and thyme if we're having it with pasta-delicious! I have also used parmesan cheese and cheddar cheese with the same results! I never use the cornmeal-doesn't need it. I grease the pans well with EV olive oil beforehand.

I'm new to baking bread and these came out great.  I didn't do the egg wash or sesame seeds and put a dish of very hot water on the lowest oven rack when baking.  Nice crunchy crust with tender insides.

OUTSTANDING RECIPE!!  I had to use seven cups of flour instead of the six...I might have been a bit heavy-handed with the water and oil...but otherwise these loaves came out looking picture-perfect.  At one point, I was concerned that I had killed off the yeast because it didn't seem to be rising fast enough, but by the last 20 minutes of the rise time, it really took off.  These came out of the oven looking like they just came from the bakery.  This is also another great recipe for my grandson who has to deal with dairy allergies.  He was here for dinner yesterday and was thrilled to know he was getting more home-baked bread along with his chicken soup.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, as I said, OUTSTANDING!!  This is a new favorite for our family.

Ok, I'm a believer! I have never made bread before-but due to insomnia have been using the creative outlet of cooking help ease stress (believe it or not)--I have "always" wanted to try to make bread--this bread was so easy to make AND delicious! It even looks like I'd made it before! My family was thrilled. I served it sliced with butter with a homemade lasagna dinner and salad. I followed the directions with no issues or problems and it came out perfect--1st try! these loaves served my family of 6 with enough leftover to make papa a couple french bread sandwiches for lunch to work the next day!! YUM!! thanks Liz--This rocks! It is a KEEPER! Madeleine

Everyone always asks me to make "my" bread... they love this recipe.  I made it once for a party and my step father tried to swipe the loaf and replace it with a supermarket loaf so he could keep it for himself! Haha...

Absolutely the BEST recipe for bread I have made.....loaves came out perfect...crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside!  I used more sesame seeds, we love those!

So awesome! I've made these twice now! The first time i thought they had an oily taste, but my hubby didn't think so. The second time, I didn't taste it, so maybe it was just me! Anyway, really good bread. I personally think that french bread should have a crustier crust, but that's just my preference. Overall, it's most definitely worth making. I'm about to go make it for the 3rd time!

This came out wonderfully.  I cut the recipe in half, and still got 2 decent size loaves.  On one I added Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese on top, before sticking in the oven.  My husband loved it.  Will make again.

I was so excited to make this after all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe, but increased the salt as suggested by other bakers.  My bread turned out too salty - but aside from that it was very dense, and not at all tender as some had described.  I don't know what I did wrong :(

This was just my second attempt at making french bread.  I was so happy that it looked good and tasted good.  It is great for sandwiches, toast, french toast and so much more.  I was thrilled with the results!  This will be a regular with me.

WOW! I would give this 100 more stars if I could. I couldn't believe I made this beautiful bread. I've tried other recipes, and no other recipe gives me bread that looks and taste like this. We made French Toast for dinner with one loaf. Yummy!!! Thanks for the keeper!

The name says it all!!  Fabulous!! Only thing different I did was dissolve the sugar in all of the warm water and let the yeast proof in that. I divided the dough after the first rise and put half in the freezer for later,, and it kept growing ;) This is definitely a keeper!!

This is the first bread recipe that I have ever had turn out well - it is awesome!  Thanks for the tips of misting the loaf every five minutes, and placing a pan of water in the oven.  The crust does come out crustier that way.

I loved this recipe! I did change it a little though.  I used Potato water for the liquid. I made the bread in loaf pans and brushed the tops with Olive oil when almost done. This is just my prefered type of crust.  Great Taste!
(Can't use the crispier crust.)

This was fabulous! Crunchy crust, nice crumb and best of all, I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle and baked it in the oven.  Easy,easy!!  Thanks!

For those who made it in the machine and had some stickiness.  Just throw some flour on the board and voila1  No Sticky!

These were good, but not like real French bread.  (I'm picky about this.  Sorry.)  This took significantly more flour than called for in the recipe (1-2 c. more), but still gave a nice taste/texture.  We liked them, just wouldn't call them French.  Edited to add:  These make excellent diced bread for stuffing.  Slice thin, then dice, put in a low oven until dry and crunchy.  I had used whole wheat flour for the extra flour and so the croutons were beautifully brown and had a nice flavor.

This is the recipe I have been looking for, for years!!  It is just like the bread you buy in the grocery store only better.  The crust is crispy and the inside tender.  I used my mixer with the dough hook, followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out beautifuly.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I omitted the egg wash and sesame seeds. I have also frozen this bread - double wrapped in Saran and foil, and it defrosted perfectly. In one batch, I also added a bunch of chopped garlic for a litle different taste, which also made great garlic bread when we have pasta. Even my normally food-clueless children have commented on how good this bread is.

This was my first french loaf, and I was very pleased with the results. I left out the sesame seeds, used brown sugar instead of white, and cooked on a pizza stone. Yum!

I made the dough in my 1 1/2lb bread machine (by cutting the recipe in half, using 1 1/2tsp bread machine yeast, setting it at the dough cycle, and leaving out the last 3 ingredients). I finished it off as the recipe suggested, but added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar over the rectangle of dough before rolling it up. It was great! Next time I might even roll it up with ham and cheese to make it a meal. My only complaint is that it takes longer to toast then most other bread recipes I've tried.

Well this is the first time I have ever baked bread, and it turned out pretty good, but could have been better.  I unfortunately forgot to let the loaves rise the seccond time before I baked them, so they ended up a little dense.  

I used spelt flour instead of regular flour, and reduced the liquid since spelt contains more moisture than wheat.  The texture of spelt is excelent in any bread, and I am overall very pleased.

I will add another review after I try this again, this time following the directions a little more closley.

This recipe is fabulous, and a success every time. I leave the eggwash out, and usually top with a bit of butter when it is rigthout of the oven. My family begs me to make it all the time!

This was by far the best bread I have ever made.  We ate one loaf and froze the other.  Great for making garlic bread or bruschetta.

I've been making this bread basically every week now- and it is not only delicious, but fills my apartment with that delectable taste of baking bread- very easy and fabulous! I also use olive oil instead of veg. oil and skip the egg wash altogether.

This bread was excellent!  It wowed both me and my husband.  Note that it really does make two full-sized loaves of bread, which was a lot for me.

This bread was so easy to make. I even put the ingredients in my bread machine and used the dough cycle! It turned out fabulous. A little crispy on the outside, but soft and light textured on the inside. This one is definitely a keeper!

These turned out great--light with a good crust. I added lemon basil and garlic salt to mine as well.

I made the dough with olive oil and used it for pizza crust.  Very good, but I would maybe increase the salt in it, and not let it rise after mixing as it wanted to keep "growing".
