11.1.16  Used Gala apples (what I had on hand), otherwise followed the recipe, and this turned out very well.  Nothing not to like here;.  Pure sweet fresh baked apples swimming in a delectable sauce, comfort food at its best.   This is the type of recipe that will be passed down for generations.

These apples are amazing!! I had one problem. The butter wouldnâ€™t mix into the water/cornstarch mixture. I just ended up putting the small pieces of butter over the top of the apples in the dish. It still turned out delicious!

It came out fantastic! I added more tapioca starch than it called for, but it turned the sauce almost caramel like. Delicious!

Instead of baking them I nuked them for 5 minutes. I'm waiting for them to cool off so I can put them into dough to make turnovers. Of course I won't be able to use all the liquid so I'll save it to pour on pancakes or French toast.
Sorry, the app gave me problems trying to upload the photo.

I used Gala apples and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. My husband said it was like eating apple pie without the crust. I'll definitely make this again. This would be a nice side dish for a holiday meal.

Very good! I made mine GF by omitting the flour and doubled corn starch. I loved it with whipped cream! Would be good with pecans added.
