I used imitation lobster meat and fat free evaporated milk to keep the calorie count down on the recipe. We liked this, but there isn't enough "cheese sauce" that we like. Next time I would double the amount of sauce and decrease the baking time. Overall everyone liked it.

I made this recipe and doubled it. I thought there was plenty of cheese sauce. I used real crab instead of lobster but kept everything eles the same, my family loved it! Even my son in culinary school (who usually tells me how I make everythig wrong) loved it!  Thank you!

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was add more cheese of a different variety such as goat and munster. Even after I felt like I should have added more cheese and garlic. I'm most certainly going to make this again!

We really liked this. I made it as stated in the recipe. Next time I will reduce or omit the lemon zest. The lemon flavor overpowered a little. I also prefer it a bit more creamy like it is before baking, so maybe next time I will serve it off the stove top to retain the creaminess, but overall this is a good dish. don't let the ingredient list turn you away. It is very easy to make and quite tasty. I was surprised I liked the pumpkin added to the cheese, but it gave it that extra something and the lobster really goes well in thi! Thanks for a unique and tasty dish ScottySauce :)

Tried this recipe tonight with a few minor alterations.....used an 8 oz block of lite cream cheese instead of mascarpone cheese, omitted the green peas, used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk, used a tex mex blend of cheese and cheddar cheese, and omitted the hot sauce. Absolutely loved the creaminess of the cheese sauce.  Very rich and creamy macaroni and cheese.  My husband found it hard to believe that there was pumpkin in the recipe too!  Overall a great success and would easily make again.  Thinking that adding in some grilled chicken and jalapeno's would also make a nice variation.

Its  "clean da fridge" night for me.  So happy to find a recipe for what I have in stock.  I used hawaii lobster parts, kabocha squash, mochiko flour, ricotta, cream, feta and cheddar cheese.  Amazing!!

I liked this, but was the only one in the family who did. Others found it too spicy, too busy, and just unappealing, respectively. I ended up sharing most of it with the dogs and cats who are huge fans.

Delicious.  I made this twice.  I did not use the pumpkin the first time and it was still amazing.  Used the pumpkin the second time and was still as good as the first time, it just depends on what you prefer.

Absolutely wonderful. I did not have shallots, so used onion and garlic from my garden, also replaced soft cheese with cream cheese - the consistency, taste and ease of making made this one of my all-time favorites. Loved the addition of the pumpkin (also from my garden) and the peas; the spices were perfect.  This will be a family favorite for years to come!

Took this to our koi club pot luck.  Everyone raved about it.  I did up the amount of spices (as a pinch didn't seem to be quite  enough), especially the hot sauce.  I think I would use a brick of cream cheese instead of the mascarpone cheese to make it a little more economical for a group.  Would cover with foil & bake for 30 minutes & uncover and bake 10 more minutes.

This was really yummy.  I used a whole shallot and a whole can of pumpkin, because what was I going to do with the leftovers?!?!  I think I ended up needing a little more flour than called for.  I used fat free evaporated milk without any issues.  I thought the ratio of cheese sauce to pasta/"lobster"/peas was fine.  Also, I didn't have access to real lobster, so I went with the imitation, and it was actually pretty good.  Most of us doused the mac n cheese with extra hot sauce - so good.  The leftovers reheated well and the kids were irritated after they had eaten it and I told them there was pumpkin in it - the small victories!
