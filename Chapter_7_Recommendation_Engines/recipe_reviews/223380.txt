This is very light as said. Very good falvor and a nice change from a mayo or mustard potatoe salad. I actually like this a lot better than the mayo. I did add a little more garlic/onion poweder and a touch more olive oil. Very tasty. Will def. make this again!

Prepared this with baby honey gold potatoes cut into thirds.  I served this warm with the meal but made enough for some leftovers.  We definitely preferred this warm as opposed to chilled.  Nice potato side dish that really will go well with so many entrees.

This was very light and easy and great to take to a picnic or potluck since it has no mayonnaise.  I scaled it down to 3 servings and made it as written and it was great.  Thank you are sharing your recipe.

Great made exactly as is. Best potato salad I've ever tasted or made. So easy to make. I cut the potatoes then boil them though....I think its easier that way.

Yep, this is a keeper!!Made this because I did not have time to make my usual potato salad. This light and refreshing. I left it on the counter while I cooked the rest of dinner to stay at room temperature and every time I took a taste it had got even better. It is 4th of July so it went well with the ribs and BBQ chicken!

Looking for a potato salad that didn't use mayonnaise since other dishes already did, I tried this. Usually I don't care for O&V based potato salads, but this was great. As with Tracy, I used chives from my garden, so I upped the amount since they have a more delicate taste than green onions. My only complaint is that I ended up increasing the amount of oil -- it was a bit tart as written, but definitely a keeper.

Even though I didn't have any green onions and had to use fresh chives instead, this is DELICIOUS.  I will be using the green onions from now on, but the taset of this salad is so GREEK!  And as I always say, "Once a week, Go Greek"...I can't say enouigh about this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved finding this recipe that gave potato salad a little twist and steered from the norm of mayonnaise and/or German style vinegar. I used this recipe as inspiration and modified a bit.  If I was rating my own version I would give it a full 5 * but, as written, I will give it 4* as it really did need the extra boost. As another reviewer suggested, adding feta really made this a Greek potato salad. I added some sliced cherry tomatoes and diced cucumber too. I didn't have green onions so I used chives from the garden and 1/2 onion, finely minced. I wouldn't change anything in the seasonings. The oil, red wine vinegar and lemon were just right with the herbs fresh from the garden. I will definitely do this one again, and love that it will keep.

These potatoes were delicious! Nice and light but still flavorful. I left out the sugar as I tend to dislike tasting sugar in my meals. Served warm but would be great served chilled if made ahead of time for camping or bbq. Also great option for vegetarian or vegan guests. Will make again

I omitted the green onions and used carmelized onions instead.  I like Yukon golds, so used those.  My family enjoyed it.  Nice dressing too.

Made this recipe exactly as it was written (some of the herbs fresh from my garden), and it was delicious!!! I took it to a barbecue last weekend, and I was glad I didn't have to worry about mayonnaise sitting out for hours.  The trick will be to get the potatoes "just right" - not to mushy and not to hard. I'll definitely make this again!

Easy and very tasty. I added a garnish of feta and kalamata olives.  I think I would consider adding the dressing to warm potatoes.  Do not cut back on the dressing, it is just enough.

I'll definitely make it again - easy and good.  didn't have any lemons so I used lime juice, substituted Italian seasoning for oregano and I left out the sugar.  Awesome.  I'm sure making it  per the recipe will be just as good!

Made this tonight and added finely chopped celery and feta cheese. I had the green onions, but would have substituted red onion otherwise. It was flavorful and good warm or cold!

This is a great recipe.  My daughter loves this type of potato salad so I thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted white balsamic and I used dill instead of oregano.  It turned out great and I will make it again!

In order to make this at least somewhat Greek,  I added Feta cheese & Kalamata olives..  Also, I used fresh herbs instead of out of a jar, and that made it super yummy.  (My 2 star rating is based solely upon the recipe as was originally written).

I added sugar snap peas to this...and would add carrots, more onion, radishes next time to give it some crunch and in an effort to make it lower in carbs!  Good - even my roommate that hates potato salad loved it.

Added some frozen green peas for color, texture and a crunch and it was a hit.  The will become a regular.

I loved the taste of this potato salad.  It tastes like the potato salad I get at a local Greek restaurant.  I have been trying to figure out what they put in their potato salad and now I know.   I used purple onion because I didn't have green onion and added fresh parsley since I had some on hand.  I will definitely make it again

This was very good for a change. It went really well with the rich calico bean dish! It's even better the next day!

This was simple and delicious. I used baby Yukon gold potatoes, which I cut into quarters. I also used fresh herbs in place of the dried. Will definitely make this often. Everyone at the picnic loved it.

Awesome recipe. I made it with gold potatoes instead of red. It tastes even better the second day. Will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe, even the kids are it. It was super easy. The only thing I didn't have were the onions.

This was easy and flavorful!  I was already using shallots for another part of dinner so I used those instead of the green onions.  I added too much rosemary but it wasn't overpowering once I added the dressing to the potatoes.  Yum!

This is really good despite a few minor changes I made. Used baby potatoes cut in 1/2. just let potatoes cool a bit and mixed everything together, served @ room temp. I also used just a splash of lemon juice because I knew we did not a strong lemon taste. I will make again!

It is so easy and so YUM! I used agave instead of white sugar and also mixed in super finely chopped kale. It is bright and satisfying!!
