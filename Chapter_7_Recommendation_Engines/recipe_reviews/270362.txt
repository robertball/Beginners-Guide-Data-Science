Good cupcakes, and perfect for St. Patrickâ€™s Day. I gave it a four people of a few changes I recommend. First, the frosting needs to be doubled to do 24 cupcakes. Second, in order to avoid the runny/glaze type of frosting the first reviewer noted, I decided to do a whole 8 oz brick of cream cheese (and I did NOT skip the Guinness in the frosting). The result was a great creamy frosting, not a runny glaze like the first reviewer experienced. I would also advise to use real butter and not margerine since that could also make it runnier.

I took these to a Super Bowl Party this past Sunday, and they were a hit! The reason I deducted a couple stars though is because of the frosting. It was so thin, it was more like a glaze. I was worried that adding in the beer straight would thin it out too much, and I was right. And also, the instruction tell you to just sort of mix everything together for the frosting. That's not a good idea. The butter and cream cheese need to be fully combined before adding anything else, or it will end up lumpy. I was really excited about a frosting that actually had Guinness in it, but this one didn't work for me. You can't really taste the Guinness either. Maybe boiling the Guinness down a bit before adding into the frosting would help? Either way, the cupcakes were great! I forgot to add the milk, and I really don't think it's necessary. They were great without it! I also got 36 cupcakes out of this. Overall, the party-goers loved the flavor of these! Thank you!
