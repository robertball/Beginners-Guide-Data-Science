Yikes! This is VERY Spicy and Tangy! I added quite a bit more Catalina and some chili sauce (Heinz) to tone down the heat. After tossing the first few wings, we decided to use the rest of the sauce to dip them - it's that potent. The flavor is very good, though. Thanks!

Pretty tasty! I love vinegar! I loved the spice of these wings. I dont know when I will make them again since my husband doesnt like wings in generally. But pretty yummy!

Very tasty.  We tried one following this recipe exactly, and I would have been very happy with them all this way.  My family likes to breath fire though, so to compromise we added 1 tbl hot pepper sauce, a few dashes of cayenne pepper and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes.  This recipe is definitely added to our rotation.

As other reviewers stated, the recipe is very vinegary. I cut the vinegar in half and it was still very powerful. Was good if you like vinegar.

I made these as written only I made sauces to go with them. Blue Cheese, Buffalo Sauce and Honey Mustard, all from this site. Thanks for the recipe.

i'm sure it's bc we love vinegar and we love spicy.. so this was super perfect for us.. i used worcestershire in place of malt vinegar.. ketchup instead of catalina dressing.. didn't dredge the wings.. just fried them straight up and then tossed in the sauce.. would love to see how the malt vinegar would change this up.. ty so much for the recipe

Delish, and not too spicy for me when made according to the recipe! I prefer a thicker, smoother texture, so after tasting and rating 4 stars, I added Heinz ketchup and more Catalina, then used an immersion blender. It's fabulous!
