Delicious guac eggs!  I subbed with a little garlic and onion powders (didn't have any fresh) and garnished with crumbled bacon. They were very good.  Will make again as written, minus the olives.

The gatlic flavor develops as they chill in the refrigerator, so I had to be patient for that amount of time.  It was worth it!  You don't lose out when the cheese must be omitted, the taste is great with the eggs alone. Instead of chili powder, I preferred chipotle seasoning on these taste treats!  Great recipe!

Best deviled eggs ever for me!  Only thing I tried different was garlic sriracha seasonings (Weber brand) in place of the Chili Powder.   Thanks for a great recipe!
