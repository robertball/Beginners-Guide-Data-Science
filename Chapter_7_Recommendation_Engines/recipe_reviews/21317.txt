THIS RECIPE IS A BELIGHTFUL MIX OF FRESH VEGETABLES AND SHIMP. I USED FOR 8 SERVINGS AND USED ONLY ONE CAN OF TOMATOE PUREE AND LESS WATER, ALSO I USED TWO TEASPOONS OF FLOUR. THIS MADE THE TEXTURE OF THE BROUTH PERFECT.

This is excellent.  I wouldn't say it is spicy, but has a great flavor.  Next time I might add a little more cajun seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty and not difficult at all.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  That was the only change I made.  Made it last night... having leftovers tonight and can't wait!  I love when after dinner my husband says "That's a keeper!"  Thanks for the "keeper"!

this was good. i added 2 slices of lemon and let them simmer in the sauce then i removed them w/ the bay leaf. my grandma taught me that.  also used homemade shrimp stock instead of the water for more flavor. chix stock would work fine too

Made this recipe as written. The kids and I loved it. Husband said it was good but too watery. I think he didn't use enough rice to soak up the yummy sauce! I will make this again.

Easy to make and delicious flavor.  I chose to make the sauce without cooking the shrimp in it.  Instead I sauteed the shrimp in butter and cajun spices and served it on top.

I am a very inexperienced cook just beginning to realize the benefits of a good homecooked meal - and this receipe was simple and DELICIOUS!  I do not stick to measurements well, but you couldn't tell at all with this - it tasted perfect!  The longer you let it cool after it's done - the yummier it gets.  I will make this over and over and really appreciate the posting!

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband didn't really care for it. I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed it, with one exception: cooking the rice. I followed the package directions to avoid ending up with gluey rice. I was surprised to see just how different my finished product looked from the photo that was showing at the time. I could have used a little more heat in this dish, but it was tasty as is.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me, because  it gave me the basis for what turned out to be a big hit with my picky boyfriend. I modified it by adding chili pepper paste and smoked baby clams because I had them on hand, and it was DELICIOUS! Usually he adds hot sauce to everything I make, but not this time!

The whole family LOVED this.  I did add crab meat and clams to the shrimp to make a more seafood creole.  Husband said this was a definate keeper.

This is so good!  Very delicious with a great flavor.  I also added a thai chili since I like it extra hot.  This is the best shrimp creole recipe I have ever tried.

I used 2 teaspoons of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning for the salt and Cajun seasoning to give this a little more zing.  I also cut back on the water to keep this dish a little thicker.  My family loves this recipe.

This was so delicious. Accompanied this with a salad and garlic toast. Yes, maybe a little bland, but my children would not eat it if it was spicy ~ that is why we have Tabasco sauce for us chili-heads. My two boys, husband and myself ate until we were bloated. I am going to make another batch and put in the freezer for one of those "lazy" nights. Thank you dearly for sharing this. Lynne

I loved this, my kids loved it, my BF thought it was good but not great.  I couldn't get him to pin point why. This is a very healthy dish.  Use low salt tomatoes and cut the olive oil a little and your cardiologist will be so proud.

good/easy recipe...a little bland for my taste.  I would punch it up with more hot sauce and cayan pepper.  Also, I would add a bay leaf after adding water (I used chicken broth).

We made this after a long day of fishing and substituted our freshly caught redfish for the shrimp.  It was wonderful!  We are about to go fishing again and I'm getting all the ingredients to make it agian!

This recipe is perfect!!!! ok, i do use vegetable broth or shrimp broth from the shells if i get them shells on, but i do that with everything. i would reccomend it, actually. i prefer not to use celery, and i usually add just a little more cajun seasoning, but i followed the recipe exactly otherwise and it was absolutely perfect. make sure you follow the intervals pretty closely. and when i say perfect, i mean perfect. :) thank you very much kathleen.

Made this the other night and it was just OK...not as Creole tasting as I would like.  I didn't have a 10.75 oz can of puree and used some tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste, maybe that was the problem???   Anyway, it was alright but will try a different recipe next time.

This dish was great.  I served it over rice like the submitter recomended but I increased the amount of cajun seasonings and hot sauce.  I also omitted the celery (I'm not a fan of celery) and the dish was fantastic.  My husband loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.

Very nice recipe as written. Play with the amount of spices. Taste as you go. I just cook the shrimp for a few minutes, though.

As is true with most people, I thought my mom's shrimp creole was as good as it got. This recipe has revised my opinion. Utterly delicious!  Easy to make and easily found ingredients. Nothing exotic. We cut the hot sauce down by half because we're old and have old, persnickety stomachs. Try to use fresh shrimp if you can. The creole is more flavorful, I think, than when made with frozen shrimp which can taste a little flat. All in all, this recipe makes for a great tasting Southern recipe that will leave you craving a second serving.

Great recipe outline to create a savory shrimp creole. I needed to double the spices and heat content and used my favorite marinara sauce in place of the tomato puree. The shrimp had wonderful texture using the low simmer as directed in the aromatic flavors of the creole sauce. My whole family loved it!

This was very good as written.  I did have trouble getting it to thicken but could just need a few more minutes cooking.

This recipe is pretty good as written, but I did things a bit different.  I added more tomatoes (canned diced tomatoes with puree) and the same amount of water.  I think this is the desired consistency, slightly watery but the rice soaks it up.  Also, I did half shrimp and half mussels.  I cooked 1 pound of mussels separately and added them on top in each serving bowl.  If I could have done one thing differently, I would have added quite a bit more cajun spice and maybe some sugar to cut through the acidity.  One more thing, I thought the 1/2 of oil may be too much, but it wasn't.  It really makes sense when you look at the dish as a whole.

I made this recipe and found it to be just a little too acidic. I added a bit of sugar to round it out and mellow it down and it was fantastic. It's a keeper!

This is similar to  my version, except that i would be using vermouth vs white wine,( just a little perkier), and chili powder  and cayenne (same as hot sauce) instead of the cajun seasoning. I also throw some sliced mushrooms in. I have had it served at a restaurant  plus peas and carrots (sweetens the dish) and zucchini. yummy! a garden of flavors to feed the soul. In  my book this tops the charts!  I  will serve lemon wedges along side of my fish dishes  as the lemon is a great freshener and opens the palette. I noticed a comment that is  my only last thought that is important to me... sauté the shrimp with your oil, either butter or olive oil and the chili powder. it will seal the shrimp guaranteeing they will stand out in the finished product.

Not bad but I probably will not use this particular recipe again.  It was a little bland and I used 4x the seasoning it called for (a good seasoning I picked up in New Orleans, I might add).  Still bland.  If you like more simple tasting foods, you might give this a try.

Good recipe.  It was a little bland, but still very good.  Will probably make again.  Will probably add more seasonings next time.

Great recipe.  I used fish stock which I had on hand instead of water, and slightly less tomato, but other than that followed the recipe.

I served this for a dinner party with great success. I used corn starch instead of flour and added a jalepeno pepper and slightly more of the spices as our group is really fond of spicy food. This was an excellent addition to my repitoire and got me much praise. Thankyou for sharing.
