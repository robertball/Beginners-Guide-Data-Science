This is a great way to hide some veggies in my kids' breakfast. They also can be "double-chocolate" waffles with some chocolate chips thrown in. The only issue I have is that the author didn't advise if the zucchini have to be squeezed. Without that the waffles are way too soft. I add 1/4 to 1/3 cup tapioca starch to get that crispiness that we expect from waffles and make up for extra fluid from the shredded zucchini. Also I used unsweetened flax milk and rice milk in place of soy. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you!

I agree w other reviewer saying they're too soft. I cooked them extra long on purpose but they were still too soft. Tasted good though, especially w choc chips and whipped cream.

These turned out really well, but were best with chocolate chips! The kids loved the chocolate Mickey Mouse waffles for dinner, and I was happy for them to get a little green in there too. Used almond milk and a GF flour blend.
