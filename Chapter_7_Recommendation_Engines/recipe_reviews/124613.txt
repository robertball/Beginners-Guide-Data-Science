A simple and delicious recipe. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. I used a heaping teaspoon of  hot praprika. I placed them on parchment paper directly on the middle oven rack. It only took 20 minutes, turning every five, it finished in a wonderful BBQ glaze. Served with choice of salsa verde and saulsa authentica dipping sauces. Best baked bbq chicken yet. Will gladly make again and again! Tip o' the hat to Marie.

This recipe was not only easy, but one of the best baked chicken recipes I've ever had.  I put the melted butter in one big ziplock back and shook it to coat.  Then I put the coating in another ziplock bag and shook the buttered chicken in that one to coat.  Can't get any easier than that!  I LOOOVE this recipe!

Quick and easy! I made one change - I coated the chicken in Italian dressing instead of butter and it was delicious. :)

This recipe is so simple and delicious.  Even my very picky kids ate this chicken.  I did omit the sesame seeds on theirs.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This would have gotten four stars from me had it turned out even a little crispy. The skin was rather mushy which I didn't find appealing. The parm gave the breadcrumbs a nice flavor but I didn't feel the sesame seeds added much. Next time I'll use the breading for fried chicken fingers instead. Thank you!

It's very plain and bland if you make as is. I liked it but it's needed to be spiced up some

This was really good - I used Shake and Bake Extra Crispy instead of bread crumbs.  Yes dipping these babies in butter does create grease but man oh MAN is this yummy - the chicken is perfect inside.

This was easy and delicious!  I didn't use but half the butter.  I had no panko bread crumbs so I used Pepperidge Farm Herbed Seasoning and crushed it a little more.  Yummy!!  I also added garlic salt.  Definitely a keeper~

I used chicken breasts and olive oil instead of butter.  They were indeed juicy and moist, but the coating was a little bland for our tastebuds.  I think I'll try the Italian dressing dip that another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very delicious. Quick and easy. The chicken was very moist and extremely flavorful. I did not use sesame seeds but I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. My only complaint was the excess of butter made it a little on the greasy side. Other than that it was great..

Less parm. cheese(1/2), skinless chicken, greek seasoning, double the sesame seeds & bread crumbs and use olive oil to bake(350). Turn after 25min. (may need less total cook time) Superior!
