This was AWESOME- definitely a keeper! I didn't have Cayenne pepper so I sub'd red pepper flakes and added broccoli like pictured. I also shave the carrots with a peeler to give it that authentic texture. Much better than take-out and much healthier to boot!

Fantastic!!  Whole family loved this; will definitely be making it regularly.  The only changes I made were to add a small amount of chicken broth to loosen the sauce, and I subbed 1 tsp of chilli pepper paste for the cayenne pepper. My family likes the baby corn so I added a can of that as well. It was fine without any changes and worthy of the whole 5 stars as is. Will try it with chicken breast next time.

Used chicken instead of pork; otherwise followed recipe exactly and it came out great! Was easy to make and 3 out of 4 of my family liked it, so it gets 4 stars.  Enjoy!

Very very spicy and I only  used 1/2 cayenne pepper.  I love hoisin but I think there is just too much of it in this recipe.  I added snap peas since they were in season.  I will not make this recipe again.

Very delicious! Instead of using carrots and the chestnuts(because I forgot to grab them) I used broccoli and snow snap peas. It is on the spicy side which is fine with me. My mom was even fine with it.

We used Broccoli, Fresno Chiles (seeds removed), 3/4 Orange Bell Pepper, Shitake Mushrooms, and Sliced Pork when we made it.  Served over White Basmati Rice.  We used Olive Oil with the Sesame Seed Oil, and Chicken Stock to help cook the vegetables down and steamed them with a lid on top of the Wok. It was SOOOOO GOOOD!

My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. The hoisin with cornstarch helped the pork brown up nicely. We also threw in fresh bok choy and snow peas since we had them on hand. The veggies helped the brown bits deglaze from the pan. It had just the right amount of heat. We would make it again.

Excellent.  I think the Hoisin sauce was the right amount.  I substitued red Sirachi sauce for pepper flakes--only reason I didn't give it a 5.

I loved it! I don't think the step to mix the hoisin and cornstarch with the pork added anything to the dish. Typically, cornstarch is added to neat in Asian cooking to add crispyness to the meat, which this did not, so I'll leave that out next time.

This is a very good recipe, but I would double the amount of hoisin sauce. I could barely taste it in the original recipe. Also I would suggest stir frying the meat and the vegetables separately, then reheating with the hoisin sauce mixture. Will make again.

Great recipe! I used chicken instead of the pork. No green onions, didn't have any... I also added almost double the red pepper flakes because we like it HOT around here. The result was a spicy-sweet dish that I will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was a great receipe. Loved the flavor and it looked wonderful. However the amount of cayenne pepper was way too much. Very spicy. I think a 1/4 tsp. would be better. A little cayenne goes a long way.You can adapt this to any kind of vegetable.
I used boneless pork ribs cut up in bite size pieces. It is the sauce that makes this such a great meal.

So easy to over cook pork. Oh well, still tender. I added Sriracha sauce for heat, plus baby corn, snow peas and bean sprouts. Made for a tasty meal.

My first time making stir fry. I used chicken, asparagus, carrots, celery, small red and orange peppers, water chestnuts. I cut back on the sugar and pepper flakes based on previous reviews. I think I cut back too much. So no real heat. But it was still very satisfying.

I liked it but my husband LOVED it. I thought it too sweet to be excellent, but since the big guy loves sweet and sour anything, he gave it five stars. Next time I would leave out or seriously decrease the sugar. No cayenne pepper in the recipe, but there it was in the directions. I didn’t use it. I assume the green onions are to be added to the top of the dish after cooking. I served this on top of udon noodles. Very good.

I'll try making it again with very little hot spice. It was good, but the hot spice was a big surprise for us. I might add snow peas next time.

I thinly sliced a large onion and sautéed in a little olive oil.  When done cooking about halfway, I added carrot coins and finished cooking.  After putting into a covered Dutch oven, I sautéed 2 thinly-sliced, then halved red peppers.  When almost done, I added small broccoli florets, a can of mushrooms with its liquid, 1 can of diced water chestnuts, some jarred chopped garlic and jarred minced ginger and cooked till hot.  I added that mixture to the Dutch oven.  In the frying pan I sautéed a bunch of sliced scallions till hot and added that to the Dutch oven.   I cut the pork chops into strips, then cubed.  I cooked these in a little sesame oil in two batches in the frying pan, along with Adobo seasoning and coarse black pepper.  In the second batch of pork, I added about a heaping tablespoon of corn starch to the meat and coated.  Then I added about 1/3 cup of Hoisin sauce and 1/3 cup of Yoshida’s sweet and savory cooking sauce and cooked till hot and thick.  Prior to this step, the Dutch oven was never turned on.  Then I dumped everything into the Dutch oven and turned a medium flame on for about 2 minutes while I stirred everything together.  We served this over white rice, along with a side salad.  Everyone loved this!

Very nice, easy weeknight meal with hot cooked rice.  I used brown sugar but followed the recipe otherwise.  The kids really liked it.  I didn't think it was too spicy, and I'm usually pretty sensitive to that.  You can obviously add/subtract vegetables depending on the season, but I think the water chestnuts are important, as they balance the softness of the meat.

The sauce was just tasty!  Are used less of the red pepper flakes, because I don't like spicy.  I eyeballed the measurements, and this came out great.  This is definitely not a "make ahead" recipe.  Be ready to sit and eat it quickly.

MY family really enjoyed this dish. Except in the ingredient list it called for 1 tsp. of red flake… but in the instructions it says to put in 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper which would have made VERY hot. I changed it to 1/4 tsp. and it was a bit hot for me and my daughter, but not for my husband and son. They love this dish. 
So watch the seasoning!

One of the few asian sauces made form scratch that I actually like. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of chilli flakes and it was plenty spicy enough! Perfect for an easy dinner night!

great dish with amazing flavor.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it still had some heat.  I also added more veggies.

This was very good. I used sliced pork tenderloin and we enjoyed it over steam fried noodles.  Added to my regular stir fry rotation so thanks for posting this recipe.

didn't add the spice, because I don't like spice. Used Apple Cider Vinegar because I didn't have rice vinegar. Also added broccoli and snap peas. Very good.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner with some Jasmine rice and it was absolutely delicious! The only changes I made to this recipe is instead of adding water chestnuts, bell pepper, carrot (none of which my kids like) I used fresh mushrooms, I whole sweet onion sliced and scallions. My kids devoured. I will definitely make this again and again. I cannot wait until my husband gets home from work to try it. One more point I would like to make, if you do not like things spicy (we do) just don't add the pepper flakes or cayenne pepper. I am sure the recipe would be just as good without it!! Great recipe!
