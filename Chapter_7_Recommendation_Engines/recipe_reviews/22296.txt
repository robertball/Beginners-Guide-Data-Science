this was OK - not very flavorful, even when adding salt.  Had to add some butter, but still not fantastic.

Creole seasoning, 2 garlic cloves, & LOTS of pepper made this wonderful. Couldn't get enough!

I started by cooking the onions with some mushrooms and garlic in butter. Once the onions turned translucent, I added some white wine (just enough to cover the bottom of the pan) and stirred until it was all evaporated. I then added the stock and zucchini and squash, seasoned with salt and pepper. I skipped on using cabbage. I covered, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes. Turned out GREAT! Everyone loved it.

Bland even after adding a bit of olive oil, basil, oregano and salt.  Palatable only because I like squash and zucchini so much.

I liked it - I am a vegetarian and so any meals with veggies if good to me. I did not use chicken broth though, instead I use butter. I also place this meal on egg noodles. Thank you!

This was okay...very bland though.  I added chicken to it, to make it work as a main dish, and garlic, as someone suggested in the reviews.  Still very bland though.  With salt it was all right.  If I were a better cook I would've known what spices to add...overall okay.

We like a little spice in our food so I added a bit of crushed red pepper, which I have always used in cabbage. Also a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese after you get it to the plate is tasty. I really liked it & it's much healthier than my good ol' fried squash.

This was a good quick side dish.  I thought it was a bit bland but, once I added some Garlic Pepper it was very yummy.

This was pretty good. I took the advice of one reviewer and cooked the onions beforehand with garlic, didn't have any mushrooms. I also used white wine. It turned out even better than I expected. I did add a bit of garlic salt.

I'm a ham and cabbage person and i love squash and zucchini so this was a great way to combine them both. i added turkey ham to keep it low fat. and my kids actually liked it they don't want it to often but did eat with out complaining and a fight.will probably make again.

This recipe is a great base that you can easily build on!  I added in other veggies I had in the fridge (green bean, fresh corn) and grilled chicken. I like things on the spicy side so I added some black pepper, red chili powder and garlic powder. I served it over egg noodles and it was a big hit!
