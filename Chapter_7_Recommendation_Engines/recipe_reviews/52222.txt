Quite tasty. I made these with chicken. I added a bit of garlic powder to the mixture. These tasted like fried chicken with less work and mess. The only thing I felt it needed was a bit of sauce so I added a drizzle of buffalo sauce and a dollop of sour cream. These would be tasty with a lot of sauces - lemon salsa ranch.. etc

Made these for dinner on National Pancake Day! Great basic recipe and a welcome change from blah baked chicken! I added finely diced red pepper (just because I had a large slice leftover) and of course garlic. Hubby and I loved them but the kids saw the mix in the bowl prior to making and refused to eat. Don't let your kids see the batter!:)

This was really really good. I followed the recipe but I cooked the patties in my 12" cast iron. I recommend that for sure. Excellent recipe.
