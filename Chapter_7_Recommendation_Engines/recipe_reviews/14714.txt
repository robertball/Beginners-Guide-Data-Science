Oh my goodness, what a great recipe! I was just looking for something to use what I had in the freezer and pantry and happened on this. Didn't expect much, kind of a steamed cabbage/sausage meal, but what a treat it turned out to be! The base recipe is great, but I used a bunch of other reviewers' ideas...I sauteed the onions and garlic in the bacon drippings, then added the other items. Rather than cutting it in quarters, I sliced the cabbage 1/2" wide, almost shredded. It wilts better that way. I also cubed 4-5 red potatoes, microwaved them to par-cook for 3 minutes, then added them to the pan with the cabbage. I also pan-fried the kielbasa separately to get it nice and browned, then added it for the final 10-15 minutes. The sugar caramelized the onions and cabbage wondefully, the red pepper added that great zingy contrast, and the potatoes brought another texture level. Delightful! I think the cabbage/potatoes/bacon mixture would make a great side dish as well, sans kielbasa. Thank you, Katherine!

Since my mother was Polish I've eaten this dish many times. You're right about the potatoes-more people use them in this dish than don't and very few put the caraway seeds in it. I'll tell you a little secret though. One reviewer came close when she said that she tried it with bowtie pasta. This meal is fantastic with kielbasa, cabbage and a bowl of buttered egg noodles on the side with a little salt and pepper. You'll think you've finally reached seventh heaven it's so tasty and filling. Real comfort food here.

Yummy! Didn't have caraway seeds, but still very tasty!I put over wide egg noodles! Next time I will add carrots and do with boiled potatoes! For those of you giving low stars to this recipe because of fat and calories, you really should go to a healthier web site. It's not fair to this recipe or any other on this site. The recipes on this site don't say diet! This is for cooks that want to experience different regular recipes, and tastes! If you want totally healthy go to another site!

I loved this recipe.  My grandparents, from Germany, would make something similar to this, and this was just as good!  I did add 1 large baking potato cut into cubes to the cabbage mix, after I boiled the potato separately for about 15 minutes.  I also sauteed the sausage in a separate skillet to keep them from getting soggy and that boiled taste once in the cabbage.  Also, I only used 1 1/2 tsp of caraway seeds and it came out excellent!  3 tsp is way too much!  I topped each dish off with a dollop of sour cream and it blended the flavors of all the ingredients perfectly!  It was truly yummy!  Thanks!

Excellent!  Made "mainly" as written with the exception of using splenda instead of sugar (which I always do if you read my other reviews-- trying to control carbs for hubs), draining all but about a TBSP of the drippings (trying to control fat for me & kids).... used lower salt bacon and lite hillshire farms kielbasa.  Everything else remained the same... right down to the caraway seeds....  I understand the desire to cut back/down/eliminate certain things.... but I don't feel that one should judge and rate the recipe from their dietary soapbox... if it is too fatty for you, move along... OR make it, including your really far out changes that totally skew the intended flavor... then DON'T RATE IT!  It is not fair to the person submitting it or those of us trying to get a sense of it is good to try or not based on others' reviews!

My husband and I enjoyed this.  The only thing I did different was I did not add the caraway seeds. It was good but definetly keep an eye on it the cabbage was a little over done for me.

This was very good. I used apple juice insead of water and cut out the sugar all together.I also sauted the onion and garlic in the bacon drippings till clear, added the apple juice (about a cup altogether), cut up potatoes and carrots and simmered till the potatoes were almost tender, then added the cabbage and the crumbled bacon and cooked down. In a seperate skillet I browned the sausage then added to the cabbage mixture and cooked together a few more minutes till done. My husband couldn't stop raving about this dish.

Great basic ingredients, but in no way am I eating 39 fat grams in one dish.  I don't eat that many fat grams in an entire day!  Comfort foods we love that can be enjoyed for a lot fewer calories using turkey bacon (which produces almost no drippings) and Healthy Choice turkey smoked sausage.  Just taking care of my health and that of my family.

We enjoyed this simple and humble dish without sugar, without caraway seed and without the crushed red pepper flakes. I served this with some parsley boiled and buttered red potatoes and it was quite a satisfying meal.

This was an exceptional dish. I made it for friends and they loved it.  Easy, quick, and a real solid meal.  I used fresh kielbasa from a polish butcher and left out the carraway seeds. Highly recommend.  I was also told by people in the butcher to cook the kielbasa separately from the cabbage...then mix everything at the end.  It worked. Next time I will try smoked kielbasa! Great recipe

Very good!  I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers and browned the kielbasa separately in another hot frying pan (with 2 tbls. of oil).  After 10 minutes of constant stirring...and when kielbasa was browned, I added to the cabbage mixture, mixed it up...covered and let cook for the last 15 minutes.  It makes a great lunch the following day (eating it now...and it seems to taste better than it did last night!)  My hubby, who is not a big cabbage fan, liked it too!

I grew up with this recipe, but never made it myself until I found it on this site. My husband adores this comforting dish. Make sure you add the caraway seeds; it really makes a difference.

This is delicious and easy to make.  My boyfriend said I can make it any time.  I did follow others suggestions and added cubed potatoes which I first cooked in the microwave and added near the end - don't think I would make it without the potatoes - gave it a nice texture.  I also added a bit more water since I added potatoes and was glad I did since it started to stick to the bottom of the pan near the end.  Served it with buttered rye bread.

best to keep the garlic out of this one - good Kielbasa will not need this extra flavor, and garlic isn't used so much in Polish cuisine.  Very good recipe, but hold the garlic. :)

Wow!  Awesome, awesome, awesome.  We loved it.  Used 4 slices bacon, to cut down on fat a bit.  Peeled and thinly sliced 3 med. potatos and diced a carrot, and got them cooking in the bacon grease.  Once they started to brown, added onion, then garlic.  Didn't have pepper flakes, so sprinkled in some paprika and cayenne.  Only used about a teaspoon of caraway (not that big a fan).  Went easy on the salt, since sausage already has salt.  Then added cabbage and let it cook down a bit (uncovered).  Added the sausage, stirred it all in, then added the water/sugar.  Used less sugar than called for and was still a little sweet for our taste.  Next time, will probably just leave sugar out.  Still, it was delicious. Especially with a little sour cream.

Great and easy recipe! I used a pkg of pre-shredded coleslaw cabbage, which worked fine and saved me some prep time. Also, to ensure that it wouldn't get "greasy" = I added 2 potatoes, cooked and cubed (hot from the microwave ;) and threw them in while cooking the cabbage. Very hearty, down home, good ol' grub recipe! Thanks for posting it Katherine!

Enjoyed the meal, but I browned my sausage in the bacon grease first, set that aside and than sauteed the onion, garlic, and cabbage to give it more color and flavor than added back the sausage with the water,  pepper flakes and caraway seed,covered and cook awhile longer.

After making this more than 10 times, I think I can review it well!!  I have made many variations of this recipe (after reviewing what other people said), but the original recipe is still 5 stars.  My family also likes it when I add a potato - this just adds a certain texture to it.  And to make it healthier, I've used turkey kielbasa, which is also good.  The only thing I do differently on a consistent basis is to double the meat.  I recently made this for my father who's German grandmother used to make something very similar.  Its now his favorite dinner.  Great recipe!!  Thank you for sharing it!

i used red cabbage and omitted the caraway because i couldnt find them in my spice cupboard black hole!(there has to be a better way) Anyway, this dish was fantastic. I think i will make it as a side dish by omitting the kielbasa. Great way to eat cabbage and if i ever clean out my spice cupboard, i will use the caraway seeds :)

I always try to make a recipe the way it directs before changing it. I thought this was very tasty but I would definitely make some slight changes. 
First, I would cut the sausage length wise and then into smaller chunks. 
Second, I'd saute the sausage first, then add the liquid, seasonings, and cabbage strips. 
Third, instead of wedges, I quarter it, then slice them into 1/2" strips to make it easier to wilt and eat. 
Fourth, will definitely decrease the caraway by about 1/2. I love caraway but that was just too much for me and way more than hubby cared for. 
Fifth, change the water to apple cider, apple juice or even beer.
Sixth, add a dollop of butter at the end, just before serving and serve with a crusty bread.

This recipe turned out very nicely.  However, the caraway seeds transferred a bit too much of their flavor to the mix.  Next time, I'll probably go very lightly on the caraway seeds, or maybe just do without or substitute for another spice.

This recipe rates five stars, easily, and I wish I could give it ten.  My husband LOVED this dish, and so did I.  

I fixed it just as written, and it was delicious, with tons of flavor.  Don't leave out the caraway, it is what makes this dish special instead of ordinary!

Next time, I'm going to quarter some redskin potatoes and add to this dish.

This was really wonderful, as we are big fans of cabbage.  I love potatoes in the mix as well, and used a trick my mom taught me.  I put the caraway seeds in a lil sachet, and boiled them with the potatoes and cabbage for 15 minutes, before draining them and adding to the recipe.  The reason I like to keep them in is that very delicate subject of..errm.. gas.  ;)  Romans started using caraway because it relieves that fun side effect cabbage gives. Great recipe, thanks!

Great recipe; the normally dainty eaters we had over for dinner went back for seconds - and that's saying something.  Following other reviewers, I browned the kielbasa first in the pan and then cooked the cabbage and onions in those drippings (didn't have any bacon, but that would be a great addition).  Everything else was the same.  Next time I will either reduce the water or cook the combined dish for awhile uncovered as there was a bit too much liquid left.

I didn't have bacon, so i just used a couple tablespoons of butter in place of the drippings. I also left out the caraway seeds (didn't have any). Maybe it was because i left out the bacon, but this tasted a tiny bit sweet to me. Next time i might cut the sugar down. An excellent recipe that turned out good even with my modifications.

When I first whipped this up, I thought it was just okay - but then I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day, and WOW were those leftovers good.  Based on that experience, I might try translating this recipe to a slow cooker next time.

This was good.  I followed the instructions almost exactly.  I should have listened to other reviewers and put in less sugar.  We will try it again without so much and it will probably be a 5 star.

Great comfort food!! Not that healthy but sooo yummy. I did not have caraway seeds and I used brown sugar instead. Also I fried the kielbasa and added carrots, cumin and a bay leaf. I was sad when this was gone. Great recipe!

I used red cabbage, shredded, because it has so much more flavor.  Sauteed up the cabbage for a couple of minutes before adding the other ingredients.  This cut down the total cooking time.  I did sautee the keilbasa first to get it caramalized.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, again, more flavor.    Served this with German Potato salad III from ths site.  Wonderful flavorful dish. Thanks

I had this recipe pulled up to make for the Super Bowl last night.  Ran to the store to pick up a couple items and when I came home, my internet was down.  I had to make this new-to-me recipe from memory.    Here's what I did:  Browned the bacon (actually 9 or 10 slices) Cooked small cubed red potatoes in the bacon grease while I chopped up half an onion and minced 3 cloves garlic.  Added that to potatoes.  Then I sliced the cabbage up like it's shredded ~ added to the potatoes/onion/garlic.  Remembered:  oh my gosh, there was a small amount of sugar water.  so, I add about 2 T of sugar to a small amount of water and pour it over the whole.  Then I added salt, pepper, some caraway seeds (i found out today I used WAY less than called for in the recipe, but it was perfect for us!) and some crushed red pepper. I browned the kielbasa in another skillet then poured that over the cabbage.  I got it pretty durn close!  MY FAMILY LOVED THIS.  We WILL have this again and probably add it to the regular menu line up!  Thank you!

I was pleasantly surprised with with recipe. Although the taste was great, I agree with others by substituting for more healthier options. It was a little too greasy the tummy. All in all pretty good!!!

The sugar made these very sweet, but delicious! I love kielbasa. I would recommend only using 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds, 3 tsp was way too much. Make sure when you turn the temp to low once you finish the bacon, because the water made lots of steam when I had the temp on med-high!

I thought this was excellent and my 2 younger boys loved it!!  The ONLY thing I did different was when the bacon was done I removed it and browned the Kielbasa in the bacon grease.  I then removed the kielbasa and proceeded with the recipe.  I also agree that you need to have the caraway seeds!  Very good!!

I loved this.  Cost me a total of $4, and made 4 very large servings for my husband and I.  We skipped the potatoes because we eat lowcarb, and used splenda.  Also added red wine vinegar off the heat to enhance the cabbage flavor.  Great, super quick, super cheap, meal!

I only made a few small changes, but my family loved it.  I only used 1/8 tsp. of crushed red pepper because I'm not big on spicy food.  I also left out the caraway seed (don't like it) and chopped the cabbage instead of wedging it.  Will saute the kielbasa a little next time before I add it to the cabbage mix.  Overall, a great recipe.

YUM!  Have made it several times but I omit the bacon (why add the extra fat?) and instead panfry sliced lowfatturkey kielbasa.  This still gives you the carmelized goodies in the bottom of the pan.  I slice the cabbage into 2 inch wide strips (wilts and braises better) and throw in a tablespoon or two of real bacon bits just add a touch of that bacon flavor.  I serve it with noodles and a veggie.

This dish was excellent; my husband ranted and raved throughout the whole meal (and after).  The only thing I changed was, I left out the seasoning salt and added 5 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce instead.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

I was looking for the traditional way to make keilbasa and sauerkraut for my Hungarian husband. I saw this and substituted drained, rinsed and squeezed dry sauerkraut for the cabbage. Used bacon drippings to saute the onions, omitted the caraway, added quartered potatoes and a smoked pork hock for flavor and let it simmer for 2-3 hours. It was awesome!! Thanks for a new New Years dish!!

WOW!  My husband is a "male plain jane" (and Polish to boot).  We both loved, I mean LOVED this.  What a nice, different change from the every day meal.  I used a really good thick cut bacon (more expensive, but well worth it to cut the grease & still get the flavor) & I boiled the kielbasa while the cabbage was "brewin".  I also added extra red pepper flakes for more kick (the kids ate BLT's tonight).  Delicious, I will definatly share this with hubbys Pop & Grandpop!  Thanks Katherine!!!

We loved this recipe!  My fat-conscious version left out the bacon.  Instead I sliced and browned the kielbasa (turkey) and cooked the remaining ingredients in the drippings that remained in the pan.  I didn't have any caraway seeds either, but didn't miss them.

This was very good.  I would definitely make again with the only change being that I would not add three teaspoons of caraway the next time around.  It way overpowered the dish and took away from the flavor of the kielbasa and cabbage.  I will add only one tsp the next time or I may use pickling spice in place of the caraway.

I have made this a few times now and it's delicious.  A diffrent, easy dish for a quick weeknight meal.  I toast the caraway seeds before incorporating them to the dish, to get more flavor out of them.

The flavor of the seasonings (aside from the caraway seed) didn't really come through; however, we did use a very large head of cabbage, so that may have diluted the overall taste a bit. Don't make our mistake and use lean turkey bacon: it won't produce enough drippings and it's hard to crumble.

I love this very inexpensive dish. It's one of those dishes though, that is almost necessary to make one night and then put in the fridge and eat the next day. It gives the flavors a chance to marry and is sooooo much better. I had rated this a 4 star and then bumped it to 5 after eating the leftovers the next day. WOW! Only thing I changed was to not add even half as much caraway seed. Didn't think the kids would like it. And to add the quartered and sliced baked potato.

Ok, so for a true review, I made this EXACTLY as stated.  It was good, but definitely would make a couple changes.  First, HALF the carraway, it was just too strong for our taste.  Second, it needed a little salt and pepper just to bring out the flavors.  This meal tastes amazing, but the seasoning salt did not do a enough for me.  When I sprinkled just a little salt and pepper on top, wow, it was great!  Definitely will make again!

I like the flavor the bacon grease gives to the dish, but I either am no good at cooking this or I just did't like it, because it wasn't my favorite.

Great comfort food. I try to always make the first batch to the letter of the recipe and I was not disapointed! Quick and simple...it was GREAT! I read the reviews form cooks who added potatoes and thought that indeed that would be a good addition, but for this first go around I whipped up a pan of fried potatoes for a side which reall complimented this dish. Would also go good with a side of baked apples. A crisp white wine is a good pairing.

Pretty good.  I only used 1 t. caraway and seemed to be just right for our family.  Next time I will add other veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

My DH asked for this for his birthday meal!  I browned the sausage first in the drippings and think this made a big difference.  Added cabbage for only the last few minutes so it didn't get too mushy.  I also did not have caraway seed, I didn't miss it.

In following the recipe the 1/4 cup of water was insufficent and cause the recipe to burn under medium heat.
I would suggest adding more water and lower heat.

Perfect recipe for an overcast November day with 8 inches of snow headed our way - followed one reviewer's advice and par-cooked 4 potatoes (diced) in the microwave and added them in with the sausage. Delicious meal - my bet is that the leftovers will be delicious as well - thank you KIKATY

 Amazing! I was suprised by the delicious flavor by such simple ingredients.

I made this twice in one week. The first time I made the recipe, I followed it with no changes. The second time I added potatoes. Its absolutely delicious! Its filling but not heavy. This is a keeper. If you had potatoes, cook them halfway then add them to the rest of the dish.

My family and I liked it, especially my husband! I did take the advise of others and added large chunks of Russet potatoes, but next time I'll use smaller "red" potatoes because you can't distinguish the Russet potatoes with the lighter areas of the cabbage. It's an issue for us because our 14 year old son will not eat potatoes and if he can't see them he won't eat any thing else from his plate, EXCEPT for the bacon, of course. Also, this recipe is a great alternative when you can't find corned beef at the market, except around St. Patrick's Day. I would make this again for Sunday dinner with the whole family. It's definitely a family comfort food.

Made this last night and it was just okay.  I hate reviewing recipes that I haven't followed exactly, but the changes I made were minor:  added half the caraway, browned the sausage separately, and added some diced potato and carrots.  I may make it again, but leave out the caraway altogether and maybe cut the sugar in half.  It was just too sweet for my taste and the caraway was overwhelming.

I really liked this a lot. I'm going to make it again next week. It's tasty, economical, and anyway we ate it too fast for a picture so I've got to try again! I did cut my cabbage into ribbons so it would be easier to eat once cooked. It twirls like spaghetti that way (but I didn't do the ribbons all thin like spaghetti.) Thanks for sharing your recipe! Edit: 1/12/15 - I add a bit of cider vinegar now too.

My 1/4 Polish husband called this dinner a "home run."  I didn't have caraway seed and it still had lots of flavor- though I will buy some the next time I make it. I served it with kale, just to make it a healthier meal.

What a great recipe.  Added a few red potatoes just because I needed to use them.  Used Kolbassa (by accident) only because I bought the wrong thing but it still turned out really good.  Added extra bacon but that's a habit.  Thanks for this recipe loved the caraway seeds.  Next time I will buy the Kielbasa! Yummy!  Picture# 16

This was delicious!  I made it for my Yankee boyfriend and he said it felt like home.  I served it with sauerkraut and mashed potato pierogi.  Highly recommend, the only change I made was using regular salt instead of seasoning salt (didn't have it on hand).

I love cabbage! Both my husband and I grew up with Polish food, as my dad is Polish, and so was his mom. I added potatoes, because that's what I'm used to. Used 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Two is too sweet, unless you want to do a sweet and sour. The caraway and red pepper flakes make this wonderful. Thanks!  : )

This was so good!!! I had some kielbasa from a local Polish deli and I found this recipe. Yummy and quick and inexpensive. I made it exactly as written and loved it. Don't leave out the crushed red pepper it adds a little bite!

I'd have to say that you have to at least like cabbage to like this recipe. I loved it! My husband wasn't as fond, but he doesn't really like cabbage that much. I've made it a few times, with and without the carraway and I actually do prefer it with, but I cut the amount in half.

This was great! I added mushrooms, and put the sausage in at the same time as the cabbage, so the cabbage would not over cook. I also need to add extra seasoning, but I had a really big head of cabbage. It turned out perfect and really flavorful!

Nice adaptable recipe that went over well in the family.  Used purple cabbage and beef sausage and mustard seed in place of caraway and still turned out delicious.

I made this tonight with fresh cabbage & onions from the garden. I added the carrots and red potatoes as some other people suggested and I can tell you this is a great, easy recipe and one of those great comfort foods. Doesn't take any time to make and worth making again and again.  I tried canning which worked but when I opened the jar, the meat was tough, so I don't advise canning.

This was excellent as directed.  I initially thought the sugar would not be needed but while tasting before serving it was necessary that with the red pepper flake was perfect.  I did go over on red pepper a little, but that wasn't necessary.  Great as written, we'll make again. thanks

i was craving comfort food and this recipe knocked my pregnant socks off.  it's definitely a new favorite. the only thing i did differently was add cubed potatoes (I microwaved them until soft before adding to pan).   this meal is not for the health conscious.  i would have never made it had i not been pregnant & more indulgent, however i am SO glad i did!  thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for people that don't like cabbage and they loved it. I did simplify it by just sauteeing/carmelizing the onion in corn oil with salt and generous pepper (light salt since the kielbasa has lots of salt in it) and then sauteeing the cabbage in super thin wedges. The kielbasa gets rubbery easily if over cooked so I add it, along with 2/3 cups water, and simmer til the juice starts to bubble again. Then off and the lid goes on for the first time. Let it steep for about 5-10 minutes. Serve with whatever rice and it's a hit.

We love cabbage prepared anyway and this receipe is a keeper. Prepared according to receipe but would recommend using less sugar.  Two tabelspoons of sugar makes this dish too sweet.

I only rate recipes that I make as they are written.  Anything else should be submitted as a new recipe, because it is!  Why affect the rating of the "as written" recipe and give people a false indicator of the merit of a recipe?  OK, stepping off soap box!  And stepping into hypocrite-ville :)  I'm rating this recipe even though I did make changes.  The changes I made?  I subbed turkey bacon and I left out the caraway because hubs doesn't like it.    We loved this recipe.  I would add in leftover cooked potatoes or serve over hot boiled potatoes next time.   This is Keeper Comfort food adaptable to a healthier lifestyle.  Will make again and again.  The red pepper provides just enough zing.  We used turkey kielbasa, but you could use smoked pork loin chops or just about any leftover lean meat.    Great recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

What a great "comfort food"!!  I've made this a couple of times ... I don't have seasoning salt, used kosher and it did just fine. I also cut my cabbage into 1/2" strips, and slice the onion, rather than chopping it.  Like others, I browned off my kielbasa, then added in the last 15 minutes ...  I like it better this way.  The first time I made it, I sauteed the onion/garlic prior to adding cabbage, won't do that again, the onion just seemed to disappear! I like the texture of the sliced onion when it's cooked the same amount of time as the cabbage.  Thank you again!!!

I really liked this dish but found it a touch too sweet for my taste. Next time I will use less sugar. I used spicy Italian sausage instead of the kielbasa because that's what I had. And the caraway seeds definitely make the dish.

This is fantastic! I would cook about 10 minutes add the sausage and cook another 10 minutes or so if you like your cabbage a little firm. Kept everything else exact and it was wonderful, flavors worked well together

Fab recipe!!  I substituted for the onion with minced onion flakes since I don't like onions.  I've also used both Splenda and sugar with equal results.  I do cut back on the sugar b/c it tends to be OVERLY sweet with the full amount.

What an awesome unique recipe!!  My idea was to actually add 1 - 2 lbs. of bacon and after putting the rest of the dish together; add the crumbled bacon and mix toss it together with the dish.  This is a great meal.  With the left overs; I'll try the idea of stewed tomatoes for a whole new dish.  :)  This is a beautiful dish to also bring somewhere.

I used prepackaged coleslaw mix with carrots instead of cutting up the cabbage. It worked out great and shortened both prep and cooking times. Will make this again!

I thought this was EXCELLENT, however, my husband would probably only give it 2 stars.  He stated that he is not a huge cabbage fan and is even less a fan of kielbasa.  A friend made a similar dish for me when I first had my baby and I have been looking for a recipe since.  This looked like the closest thing I could find.  I did everything the same except subbed a few shakes of Tabasco for the red pepper flakes and I was chicken, I only used a tiny bit of caraway.  I dipped the cabbage and kielbasa in regular yellow mustard and it was so yummy!!  I served with baked potato (which my husband ate. ;) I would like to try this again minus the bacon and drippings, to cut out some fat.  Great comfort food!

We all loved this, (the teen daughter looked at it and wouldn't go for it, but oh well)..I had some sauerkraut leftover from Reuben sandwiches, so I used smoked sausage,and sqeezed the liquid out of the kraut. Had to add about 1/4 cup of apple juice to keep it from drying out, and it also sweetened the kraut just enough. I made mashed potatoes and served cream style corn on the side. It was so comforting and really yummy on a cold night! I didn't add as much caraway, just because I didn't know how it would go over with the family, but the caraway was very good.

I had the stuff for this at home and decided to try it. I used 3 slices of bacon, and no caraway seeds (based on previous reviews). I also added potatoes along with the cabbage. My husband doesn't like cooked cabbage much but he loved this!

This one was a real success. Easy to prepare & delicious. I must agree that the caraway seeds are an important addition. Wonderfully sweet taste & the bacon on top provided a perfect final touch. My girlfriend is now happily doing the dishes... that's testimonial enough to this fine dish!

Wonderful!!!  I use a low-fat kielbasa and low fat turkey bacon (bacon is a must to get the wonderful taste!).  Personally I don't like the seeds in it, so I omit them.  But the recipe is delicious!  It is a change in pace from the average dinner.  My husband and I always fight over the left overs.  Thank you!

My whole family loved this recipe for dinner and loved it all over again when they all brought leftovers to work and school!  I have requests for it every week now!  I doubled the kielbasa and added two more bacon slices...still great!  Then, I switched to turkey kielbasa and low-fat bacon, and it was still MARVELOUS!

My family LOVES this!  I made it last Fall just like Robin Seidel explained in her comment (thanks Robin!).  I'll add to her remarks that the caraway seed gives this a scrumptious Old World flavor, and now that the cooler Fall weather is back again, it's a perfect time to prepare this dish again.  And I will...this weekend :)

Loved it. Added plenty of red pepper flakes! Added the boiled potatoes another review suggested.  Also I did chop the cabbage some. Thanks!

My husband brought home some delicious polish-type sausage that I wanted to use up, so I found this recipe and decided to try it.  We loved it!  To make my reviews authentic, I try to always make the dishes on this site exactly as written, but made a couple of minor changes on this one.  Since cooked cabbage is already sweet, I used only 1 tbsp. sugar.  To give the cabbage more flavor, I used chicken broth instead of water, and sauteéd  the caraway seed, onions and garlic for a few minutes in the bacon fat before adding the liquid and other seasonings.  Next time I make this I'll reduce the caraway seed by half, increase the liquid (chicken broth) to 1/2 cup to make more broth and give the cabbage more flavor, and I'll add more red pepper flakes because we like the heat!  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is that I thought the cabbage was a little bland for my taste and the amount of caraway seed seemed overpowering compared to the other mild spices in the dish.

Quick weeknight meal for the family!  I used Turkey Kielbasa and drained some of the bacon fat.  I also added a few small golden potatoes.  It was a hit and surprised everyone that it was tastier than expected.

I made as is with the exception of the pepper flakes (didn't have any), and I cut the amount of caraway seeds in half. I was really disappointed with this dish. I didn't like the sweetness of this dish, or the taste of the caraway.  But then again, I don't like rye either, and that's what caraway reminds me of.  If I were to make this again, I would leave out the sugar and caraway.  I'm confident this would make this dish excellent, as it would then be similar to the amazing cabbage and noodles recipe (found on this site), except replace the noodles with potatoes and kielbasa!

For a newbie cook with a picky husband, this was very tasty and beyond easy. I can handle view ingredients and easy will definitely put in my favorite. When I  obtain  more experience cooking, then I can tweek and make it my own. Thanks for giving me a starting point.

I did tweak the recipe a little, so I don't think it's fair to give five stars. Rendered the fat from the sausage first and drained it, added a tablespoon of horseradish mustard, and omitted the bacon. I served it with a crusty baguette to sop up the sauce!

I made this recipe today at work for everyone for lunch. It was a hit! Even a couple of guys that "don't like cabbage" loved it! And came back for seconds! The only difference is I didn't have caraway seeds and I only had smoked deer sausage and added potatoes. It was still amazing! I made cornbread to go along with it. Big hit and I'll definitely make it again! Thanks KITKATY!

This was an awesome deviation from my moms recipe that I (now used) to) make for my wife and kids.   I made a few modifications that we loved and one that is a split decision:  we loved the kielbasa cooked separately, and the onion mixture pseudo carmalized first ( in 1/3 the bacon grease) added red potatoes (nuked for about 12 min) and stirred in at the end. I should not have only used 1/2 the cabbage, glad I sliced it in half inch slices, used 1/8 t Cheyenne ground pepper to the 1/4 t larosas red peeper flakes, but won't add 20 whole black pepper corns (or will pick them out for my wife). Now that I think about it, doesn't that serve her right for taking the photo plate?  The bacon was a great hit!

Pretty good and super easy.
I reduced the caraway seed to 2 instead of 3 tsps but otherwise hit it on all marks.  
Next time (and there will be a next time) I may reduce the sugar a little as I thought the sweetness was too apparent.
Also, I might add a touch of dry mustard and sub beer for the water.
All very minor changes to a pretty good dish as is, after cooking it as intended.

To the side I served Chef John's oven roasted red potatoes.

Husband loved.  Kids didn't.  I liked this too!  Like other suggestions, I sauteed the onions, first, then added garlic into bacon drippings.  I actually bought a bag of coleslaw (1 1/2 bags) instead of buying cabbage and shredding it.  I sauteed the kielbasa separately (sliced thin).  I also parboiled 2 potatoes and added. I didnt' add as many caraway seeds.  All the rest was the same!  Like I said husband LOVED it!! But, was hard to win over the kids!

Fantastic recipe. The caraway seeds flavor is remarkable. The caramelization of sugar is genius . The only thing I do different is add boiled potatoes , chopped into bite sized portions ,  along with the kielbasa for the last 30 mins. Excellent!!

10 stars!  This was too good for words. I was making it at night to take to my moms and my boyfriend and I ate at least half it!  We couldn't get enough. I did brown the meat, add a potato and cut the caraway seed in half. This is the new football half-time favorite!  Thanks for the recipe that reminds me of my Gram!

I love this! It reminds me of living in Louisiana. I chunk the kielbasa and broil them for a few minutes, just to give them a nice crisp. I also double the "sauce."  This dish is one of my favorite go-to meals, the only down side is that it's so good there are rarely any leftovers for the next day's lunch.

This was a great recipe!  My husband loved this dish.  I followed the recipe to a tee (sometimes I try adding seasonings and tweaking things, but usually find if I follow the recipe it turns out better.)  I did follow a few other reviewers advice and I browned the meat in  a separate pan to get it nice a browned.  I also added baby carrots and potatoes which i steamed for about 15 minutes before adding them to the last step of this recipe (where everything cooks together for about 10-15 minutes).  Will make again!

Awesome dish!! My family absolutely loved it and my youngest child usually will not eat cooked cabbage. I was out of caraway seed and it was still delicious. I cannot wait to cook it with the seeds. My bunch declared this recipe a "keeper".

I did not care for this dish at all.  Surprised, because separately, I love cabbage and chicken kielbasa.  Following the directions, I found it to be too greasy.  It may just be a matter of personal taste, but I will continue to serve my cabbage separately, with butter and vinegar.

This was wonderful!  I omitted the bacon (to reduce the fat), and cut the sugar in half - just seemed like it would be too sweet (and I'm glad I did!).  I thought the caraway seed would be overwhelming, but it wasn't!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has a wonderful flavor! I'm more of a fried cabbage girl but this was just awesome. I may try to incorporate these flavors into my fried version. Thank You

My husband said that this tasted a lot like his grandfathers kielbasa and cabbage. We all loved this recipe, especially my son who had thirds!! Thank you so much for sharing this.

This recipe has just became one of my favorites! Here is what I did.. I sliced up the bacon sauteed it with the onions and garlic. Added some of the crushed red pepper, season salt and black pepper til the bacon was crisp. Added the cabbage sauteed it til it was brown. Added sugar,spices.and 1 tsp. of caraway seeds. 3 tsp is way to much in my book. It was just enough for flavor. I also added 1 tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar gradually added water as it cooked. Made fried potato for a side! Posted a picture too.! ENJOY!!

Awesome recipe!  Very versatile.  I used turkey kielbasa, sauer kraut, and yams - because it is what i had on-hand.  The yams soaked up the yumminess of the sauer kraut juice and it was just amazing!  The flavors came together really well.  It was very easy to make and very flavorful.  The red pepper flakes added just the right touch of heat.  I will be making this again and again!  Thank you!

Always make this per the recipe, maybe chop the cabbage into smaller slices and up the kielbasa to a pound and a half. Other than that it is exactly as the recipe states and everyone in my house loves it!

I had no problems with this reciepe. I used red cabbage because I like to cook better with it. Also, I used 2.12lbs of sausage, which was great but I should have used more cabbage for it! haha.. I mostly suggest to watch the size your cut it- part of your cabbage could over cook waiting for slices that were cut too large. Great dish!! Very yummy.

Loved this!!  I always try to follow a recipe the way it is written the first time I make it (and note changes I would make in the future). The only change I made this time was shredding the cabbage because I prefer that to wedges- absorbs flavors better.  I like the idea of sauteeing the onions and garlic before adding other ingredients and next time I would cut the sugar in half.  Caraway seeds are an important component of the flavor and leaving them out would change the whole dish for me. Love that it is low in carbs - I am diabetic and try to limit my carbs to no more than 15 grams per meal, otherwise small red potatoes and even carrots added and cooked in the dish when the meat is added would be a great touch!

I enjoyed this dish, but admit I did not have caraway seed, so didn't add that part. Otherwise it was fine... perhaps a bit bland. If I didn't it again I'd surely brown the meat seperately and add near the end. I did shred rather than "wedge" my cabbage. 
I like my cabbage "crispier", but I'm sure many people grew up with a version of this and it has a home in their hearts. Maybe I'll try it again if I decide to pick up some caraway.

Yummy!  Browned the Kielbasa, added a bolied cubed potato and 1/2 cup cooked egg noodles sauted in garlic butter.  Not big on caraway seed taste so I added some celery seed instead.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made this in case my Kielbasa Stew was a bust.  Based on the reviews, I decided to try it.  Everyone loved it.  It didn't seem like there would be much flavor but it was surprising good!  I will definitely make this again!

This is fabulous!  Followed recipe exactly except only used 1 tsp caraway.  The only other change that I made was slicing the kielbasa and browning it in the bacon drippings and then setting it aside with the bacon until after the first 15 minutes of cooking the cabbage, then I added both the bacon and the kielbasa into the cabbage mixture for the rest of the cook time.  The whole family raved!  Served with mashed potatoes.

This exceeded my expectations.  I increased the seasoning salt and added pepper just for personal taste.  I found 3 tsp of caraway seeds were the perfect amount for a large head of cabbage.  I changed the cooking method overall though.  I first browned the sausage and added in the garlic and onions to brown as well.  Then added the other ingredients on top.  I added about a tablespoon of cider vinegar to brighten the flavors in the dish.  Great recipe I will definitely make again.

This is excellent.  Had to make a few changes though.  Love caraway, but the amount seemed quite excessive...I added one tsp.  Also added a tsp of organic apple cider vinegar and a 1/2 tsp of boullion. Had to add extra water.

Very good. First time I ever made a dish like this with sugar. I grew up with fried cabbage and noodles (or homemade drop noodles). With the Kielbasa. Thought I'd give your dish a try.

I did not use bacon drippings at all.  Used turkey kielbasa and turkey bacon.  Browned the kielbasa in pan 1st then removed and mixed the rest of ing with the cabbage in the pan.  Crumbled a little bacon over individual servings in order to keep better track of the calories.  I thought the amount of caraway seeds was perfect.  I used chicken broth in place of the water.  Will definitely make again.

I used smoked sausage because it's what I had. I also added frozen carrots and boiled some potatoes to go in this dish. I only added about 1/8 tsp. hot pepper because my mouth is extra sensitive to anything spicy, and even though my taste buds were crying "foul" as loud as ever, I just kept eating. This was SO good! My husband, son and friend kept chanting "Make it again!" We had french bread with this and it was a meal to brag about. I know I changed the recipe from the original, but I have to do what I can since I can hardly stand (literally) to cook. I love the process but my body doesn't. Therefore, sometimes I take a few liberties, but hopefully not too many times. Thanks for the fantastic submission.

Is very simple recipe...  if followed properly, makes excellent dish!   We always fry kielbasa with cabbage and onions... some don't like the taste. But this recipe - with the little bit of water and sugar - really tastes great!  When it was finished, I turned the stove to "low", and then got tied up with a phone call.  Nothing burned, and it tasted delicious... so good, that there weren't any leftovers!

Cooked slowly for 1 hour.  Chopped cabbage as suggested, used 1/2 as much sugar as called for, cut Kielbasa in rings and browned before adding to cabbage mixture for the last 15-20 minutes.  Do not reduce amt. of caraway seeds.  Served with oven roasted potatoes and dark beer.

Everyone loved it! Easy to make as well. I added carrots and red potatoes, for good measure. Why not?

We loved this recipe. As far as the ingredients go I followed the recipe exactly except that I only used two teaspoons of caraway. For the preparation and cooking I sauteed the onion and garlic in the bacon grease before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also precooked the sausage in a separate pan while the cabbage mixture was cooking, and then added it to the cabbage mixture and cooked it 15 minutes more. The only thing that I would do differently the next time is to reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. It tasted just a bit too sweet for us.

OMG This was so good. My husband loved it. However, given all the delicious pork fat included in this recipe I probably won't make it again but I will always remember how awesome it was. Pork fat rules!!

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this dish!  My kids even loved it, which it nothing short of miraculous.  The first time I made it I didn't have caraway seed and I only had a big bag of coleslaw (without the dressing of course).   I browned the kielbasa first to get that rich flavor and I served it with hot buttered egg noodles.  It was fabulous! The next time I made it I used the caraway seeds and added a couple of diced potatoes.  The potatoes made it a little more hearty and it was nice.  However, I didn't enjoy the flavor added by the caraway as much.  This meal has become a favorite!

I've fixed this twice since I ran across it.  My husband and I both love it!  Unfortunately it doesn't like me ... cabbage is very gaseous.  The only changes I made was to omit the salt and used Hormel's Real Crumbled Bacon instead of bacon strips.  I'm on a restricted sodium and low fat diet.  2 T. of Hormel's Real Crumbled Bacon = 50 cal., 3 g. tot. fat, 380 mg. sod., 0 carbs, 3 g. protein.

I thought this was just a take on what my mom used to throw together, but this is really a good balance of salty, sweet, slightly spicy, and just all-out nomness. Hubby really, really liked it! I made it with the buttered noodles, although I think the sliced cooked potatoes would be awesome with it, too. And NO caraway for me, thanks! :) And I used beef smoked sausage, which was very yummy. Might use chicken broth instead of plain water next time. Very tasty!

OMG!  Soooooooooo quick and flippin to the easy!  lol!  Not to mention, really inexpensive to make.  As for the Kielbasa, didn't have that so I used just regular ol' smoked sausage (same stuff to me - though andouille would be good too! hmmm)...anywho - that type of meat is a must but really, chop up any left over meat from the refrig and toss it in....same for some veggies that need to be used up.....great meal stretcher ideas!  Nothing goes to waste this way.  Economy too tight - things are too expensive to waste AND you'll never get bored right from your own refrig!

Very tasty! I left out the caraway seeds, shredded the cabbage, and added a little cheddar cheese at the very end to let it melt all of the flavours together.  One of those real comfort meals.

Made this last night and my husband loved it. I'm not a fan of sweet things so my personal preference would be to cut the sugar to only 1 TBSP but my husband thought it was perfect with 2. I'm not a big cabbage fan but this recipe provided a great way to enjoy it. I read the reviews and did cut up the cabbage in 1/2-inch slices - worked great. Definitely use the caraway seeds! Used brats instead of kielbasa (that's what I had on hand) and it came out great! Cooked the meat separately as others recommended. The only thing I would change is adding extra garlic - but that's a personal preference. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Mediocre at best (sorry!). Although the components of this dish are yummy in their own right, they surprisingly did not work well together (IMHO). I had some cabbage in my fridge that needed using up (I purchased it a week or so ago to make Italian vegetable soup - all that my local grocer had at that time were HUMONGOUS heads of cabbage!!!), so I'm glad I gave this a try, if for nothing other than that. I pretty much followed KITKATY's directions to the letter with a few exceptions. I subbed apple cider for water, sauteed my onions/garlic in bacon drippings and browned my kielbasa in a separate skillet (it got a nice char this way). Oh, and I shredded my cabbage (approximately 2 inches wide) instead of cutting it into small wedges as directed since many reviewers suggested that it cooks better this way. For those of you giving this a try, please note: WATCH YOUR CABBAGE MIXTURE CAREFULLY; IT BURNS (I.E. "SCORCHES") VERY, VERY EASILY (I only cooked mine for 12.5 minutes at first, then another 12.5 minutes after adding the sausage and it was nearly burnt!!!). As Leigh Ann did, I too served this with creamed corn and (garlic) mashed potatoes. I also purchased some fresh marbled caraway rye bread to serve on the side. Apple cider completed our meal. Thanks for sharing your idea, KITKATY :) Unfortunately, your dish did not WOW! me enough to give any consideration to making it again (and my fiance is not a huge cabbage fan to boot anyways).

I made this dish on the first day of fall along with the All American Apple Pie on this site.  Somehow, I forgot my husband doesn't care for cabbage??  My son & I loved this dish, and I will make it again.  I did make a few changes to the recipe:  browned the kielbasa first, sauted onions along w/ garlic in the bacon drippings, added chunks of boiled potatoes, used brown sugar instead of white, and cut caraway seed to 1 teaspoon.  Leftovers were even better the next day!  Delicious!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it really was a good recipe, me and my hubby just didn't like the taste of the caraway seeds too much.  The recipe was easy and a great weeknight meal.  I will probably try it again but leave out the caraway seeds.

Excellent. The added Kielbasa was a nice twist to an old favorite. In addition to the recipe ... I sauteed the onions and garlic in the bacon drippings, then added 4-5 microwaved cubed red potatoes, to par-cook for 3 minutes, before adding them to the cabbage. I also pan-fried the kielbasa separately to get it nice and browned, then added it for the final 10-15 minutes.

WOW! This was awesome! My husband died and went to heaven, and then got seconds. He's been asking for it ever since. I added some potatoes but other then that its perfect. Simple comfort food on a chilly night, doesn't get much better then this. You've gotta try it.

The bacon and the onion are essential to this recipe.  They give it just the right touch.  I didn't have carraway seeds, so I just omitted them and it was excellent anyway.

This was pretty good.  I left out the caraway seeds (since I don't like the taste of them at all) and the sugar since I used honey cured and Maple Brown Sugar bacon.  However, I took the advice of some other chefs and added potatoes in addition to red and green pepper instead of carrots (yech!).  This dish was a little too greasy in my opinion, but overall, I would make it again occasionally.

This was good and easy. I also used the bag cole slaw cabbage which worked fine. The only change I would make is to stick the whole bag in...it looked like so much cabbage when I put it in the pan, but it cooks down. Thanks for the easy simple recipe. It is a keeper for those busy nights.

Very good. By the way, I've used a recipe before using Kielbasa, potatoes, broccoli, carrots, onion, celery, bacon, and some other ingredients. This is all layered in a deep cast iron skillet, with the sausage added the last and covered so the grease dripping pass through the vegetables. I've searched this website but nothing comes up.

We really liked this dish. I was surprised at how much I like the mix of flavors. We used ham instead of bacon and mustard seeds instead of caraway seeds, since that was what we had in the house.

I was really looking forward to this recipe but was a bit disappointed.  My kids loved it because it was sweet.  

I like the sweet too, but if it's going to be sweet it needs something to contrast it like sour or spicy.  It just wasn't there.  

After I added a jar of sauerkraut, I thought it was better.  I would add extra spices or vinegar or something to make it a little more traditional and less bland and sweet.

This was excellent! I used smoked sausage (lightly fried) but other wise wonderful. Great flavor. Thanks for the addition to my menu.

I've got so many variations on this recipe! The beauty of it is its versatility. I used low-fat kielbasa and, in addition to the water, I added a can of diced tomatoes for nutrition and moisture. You can add more veggies (celery, carrots, spuds, zuccini, mushrooms, peas etc) to make it more stew-like, and/or some crushed up pasta and beef/chicken broth for a hearty soup. I'd never thought of the caraway seeds before - they gave it a really nice flavor. Great recipe! Thanks, Katherine!

This is a great recipe!!  My husband and I love this, and it is now our favorite way to prepare kielbasa.  We also love "spicy"...so I do add more of the red pepper flakes.  I always serve this with garlic mashed potatoes, which seems to go so well with the cabbage in this recipe.  When time permits, I also serve along with Red Pepper Biscuits...recipe also on this site in Breads.

This was a huge hit with my company.  I used low-sodium bacon and microwaved it until it was crisp.  I used about 1/2 the fat in the skillet with just a little bit more water.  I used a few drops of hot sauce instead of the crushed pepper flakes.  I shredded the cabbage and used skinless kielbasa cut in 1 
1/2-inch pieces.  I served it with applesauce & carrots.  I make something similar which I will try next time by cooking Polish noodles (Kluski)separately & then add them to the cabbage.  Definitely a keeper.

I did not like this and only ate it because I went to all the trouble to cook it.  It was bland and greasy and I can't think of any way to improve it.  I found the total prep and cook time to be about an hour, making this definitely not worth the time.  My husband liked it, though, so I'm giving it an extra star.

Yummy!  My BF isn't very fond of cabbage but really liked this dish.  The only thing I changed was to leave out the caraway seeds because neither of us like the way they taste.  Great recipe!

I cook once a week for my bachelor brother and Dad, and this is one of their absolute favorite meals. I've made it a half-dozen times for them and will continue to do so. I love it made as per the recipe, but it's so versatile I can throw a can of corn and sliced potatoes in, and they have enough for 3-4 meals.

I used "hot" keilbasa, so I omitted the red pepper flakes.  My DH gives this a 4. I give it a 4.5 - very easy and delicious.  I also added some potatoes as suggested by other reviewers.  I will make this again.  Don't forget the caraway - it really DOES make the dish!

I'm not a fan of cabbage because it really stinks up the kitchen while cooking, but I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the advice of others and left out the carraway seeds and I doubled the red pepper flakes.  I also added potatoes and browned the kielbasa with the cabbage before adding to the other mixture.  My husband who requested the recipe reheated it the next day and added some rice and soy sauce and said it was fantastic.

The cabbage was way, WAY too sweet and a bit on the mushy side. I left out the bacon and used regular beef sausage (which I think added to the slight unpleasantness of the dish because the sausages weren't very nice themselves!) Next time I will use bacon and less sugar.

Very good!  I made it as written except with a bit more bacon.  My 6 year old complained the caraway was too “spicy”, but everyone else devoured it.  I made roasted Lipton onion potatoes on the side and they were delicious with the cabbage juices.

Great combination of flavors! I’m sure it would have been even better if I used all the bacon drippings but I poured all but two tbsp off. Also I used turkey Kielbasa which was still delish without rendering my cholesterol medication ineffective! Served with boiled red potatoes and pickled beets. A glass of Cabernet finished off the sweet and spicy flavors. What a wonderful meal. My husband raved. Thank you!

We loved it. Left out caraway seeds because I don’t like them. I did sauté the onion and garlic in the drippings first. Next time I’ll try adding some apple juice instead of water. And maybe even some sliced apples... why not?  This is going to be new staple I think.

I made it with my juvenile detainees. The kids loved it. I wish I would have read the reviews. The  kielbasa really needs to be sliced into coins and cooked up in the bacon fat. I had the kids cook rice and Marie Calender’s corn bread. Everything disappeared!

Used half a head of cabbage and two kielbasa links. 1 teaspoon of caraway seed forgot the sugar and didn’t miss it. Poured off the excess bacon grease before putting ingredients in. Was a hit! Served 6 easily.

I could almost feel my arteries clogging up but it sure was a good meal! I followed the recipe to a T, even going to the store to buy caraway seed. I had never used it before in cooking. Because of the fat content I will probably not prepare it again but it looked good and it was.

Simplicity is a truly beautiful thing and that is what you get when you prepare this meal. 
I made this recipe mostly as written, omitting only the sugar and caraway seed due to dietary restrictions. 
I also did add thick sliced carrots and chopped celery; coarsely ground pepper, salt.
I didn't have time to slow cook in the crock pot, so I placed all ingredients, along with one cup water, into a covered deep-dish casserole dish & baked at 400° for 90 minutes.
It was SO, SO GOOD!
Everything was perfection: kielbasa slightly browned, but juicy & flavorful, cabbage was crisp-tender (perfect in opinion: I don't care for mushy cabbage) and remaining vegetables just in there humming along, contributing to all that deliciousness. 
Served with seedless rye bread & butter, this made an incredible New Year's Day meal.
Thank you for sharing!

Love!  As suggested by other reviewers; Sauted onions, garlic in bacon grease and   browned sausage separately in another pan before adding to cabbage. Used chicken stock instead of water.

I have made this many times. Very much a favorite in our house. I have made a couple of changes to the original receipt. I add partially cooked potatoes and carrots cut about the same size chunks, ( I find the carrots add a little sweetness) to the sautéed onion. Along with the cabbage. And already browned sausage. Also use apple juice instead of water. I used either celery seed or celery salt as I didn’t have caraway seed. Found it to be very yummy :)

I have to say, this is quite tasty. I had a head of cabbage, and I wasn't sure what to do with it. I found this recipe, and I'm glad I made it. I did it without bacon, to make it a little healthier. I just substituted some vegetable oil. the rest I followed to a tee. cabbage comes out so tender and delicious. and of course, kielbasa is a wonderful sausage. flavorful and different, a nice break from other types of Western cuisine. it did teach me one thing, though, it seems I don't like caraway seed very much.

Delicious meal! We had no carraway seeds, but other than that, made it as described. My hubby said, "Where has this meal been all my life?". He is of Ukrainian heritage, so he said all it needs next time is a side of pierogies!

I shredded cabbage and cooked the sausage separately before adding to the rest of ingredients. It was pretty good. A tad greasy for me. I will drain some of the bacon grease next time.

I made this and it was good but 1 head of cabbage is way too much for a large skillet. You would actually need a wok for so much cabbage. Or you could just use 1/2 a head of cabbage. Also the sugar is not necessary. I added homemade fries on the side.

Been making this for years and always well received.  I always put in on a bowl of mashed potatoes.   Yum.  I do what other reviewers do and saute the onions and garlic in the bacon grease before adding the water and spices.  No caraway seeds for me.

This was crazy yummy! I made this pretty much as written except I added golden skinned potatoes and skipped the bacon. I didn't have any on hand.

Even without the bacon flavor this was delicious. I fried up the smoked sausage (had that over kielbasa), removed after it was browned and then sauteed the onion and garlic in it's drippings (which was less than a tablespoons worth) for 3 minutes. Added the half inch sliced cabagge and cooked for about 4-5 minutes, adding the rest of the spices, sugar and water. Meanwhile I microwaved quartered golden skin potatoes for about 4/5 minutes. Added to skillet with the rest, mixed together and cooked about 7-8 minutes covered stirring after about 5. Added the sausage after to warm up and coat with the delicious sauce the vegetables made for 2/3 minutes.

This was good! Such a simple dinner, took 20-30 minutes at the very most from chopping to sitting down to chow down. Next time I may switch out the potatoes for rice or buttered pasta, and add in some more vegetables.

We are on Paleo diet so I changed this up just a little. I skipped the potato and added more garlic,onion and bacon. I also added less than 1/4 cup of chicken stock and cooked the cabbage and onions with a cover. My husband said don’t lose this one. It is a quick easy meal to make.  I think next time I will add sauerkraut to take the sweetness out of the cabbage.

Instead of any bacon, I browned the sliced sausage first, then removed the sausage, added coconut oil to the pan and scrapped for bits to give it sausage flavor. Then cooked the vegetables in that, adding the sausage back in later like the recipe. And instead of water I used low sodium beef broth to add more beefy flavor in case it was missing due to lack of bacon. Loved how it turned out, thanks for the jumping off point!

Made this for dinner tonight, it was so good. I added a couple potatoes and carrots, also used chicken broth instead of water. Didn't use the caraway  because I don't really care for it and neither does hubby. This is going in my recipe file and will be made often. Been looking for a recipe calling for cabbage and this one fit the bill perfectly.

Great recipe. It’s been a favorite for many years, although this time I served with the buttered egg noodles. As another reviewer noted, this is heaven! Went over very well on a dreary rainy fall night.

A little bit sickening with all of the bacon drippings and sugar. I would cut back on both if I made this again. Red potatoes were a nice addition.

It was a nice combination of tastes. The kielbasa is always nicely salted as is the bacon. The cabbage and other ingredients all complemented each other well.

This is a great easy recipe. I browned the kielbasa on the bacon fat and removed, then added the onions and sugar and sauté until tender and added the rest of the ingredients except for kielbasa. While cabbage cooked, I made regular size egg noodles al dente, drained and mixed into the cabbage, added the kielbasa, let all the flavors mingled for a few minutes, topped with bacon and served.  Excellent!

Was somewhat nervous adding the sugar but it came out awesome. The boyfriend was hesitant on trying it when I sent him the recipe but even he was pleasantly surprised.  I served it on white rice and made roasted red potatoes on the side. Will be adding to my recipes and making more.

I will be making this for company someday.  Really good, I mean really, really good. Only substitution I made was the caraway seeds ( I can't have seeds) I put them in a mortar & Pestle and crushed into powder and sifted thru a small sieve(lots of flavor) and cut back red pepper to 1/8 tsp red pepper pwdr (plenty of heat for us). This is a yummy recipe that we ate with mashed potatoes.

Well, that didn't go as planned. I don't know what I did wrong. Since it was the first time making the recipe, I followed it exactly as written. And I wound up with a dish of uncooked cabbage with almost no flavor whatever. In fact, I have half a recipe left over. I think I'm going to take the remaining half, chop the cabbage in chunks, and try to cook it that way. Maybe I'll let it cook in a slow cooker for an hour or so. Sorry, but this recipe sure didn't work for me.

not sure what the problem was, maybe my electric skillet!  concept was good, ingrediants good, but did not turn out as planned, cabbage and seosonings burned after 5 minutes being covered! did try and salvage it, maybe try again on stove top!  I do love cabbage with bacon, so worth a shot!

It was so tasty.  I made just 1/2 of it and both my husband and I LOVED it.  I am not a "good" cook so this was a great surprise.

I made this it was very good! The sugar and red pepper flakes gave it the right sweet hot spice flavor. I used onion powder and garlic powder and omitted the caraway seed I also added boiled potatoes and mixed in with the cabbage it gave the potatoes a good flavor the bacon crumbled overtop was mmm good!

This is a really tasty base recipe.  We like vegetables so I added chopped carrots and potato with lots of extra onions that were fried before the cabbage went in.  You don't need all the bacon fat, just leave enough to coat pan bottom and add a pat of butter. Someone else mentioned to cook sausage in a different pan and that woks by keeping flavors separate.  Yah, we ixnayed the caraway too. :-)

Made it exactly as stated. No one in the fam liked it. This is the first recipe that we couldn’t stomach from this site. To bad too because we love kielbasa and cabbage. Bummed.

I make this quite often but instead of water I add a half can of beer and shred the cabbage. Caraway seeds are a must. I like to add red pepper flanked and garlic but some of my people don’t like garlic and spice. Go figure. Still very satisfying and hearty meal. When I can I get polish sausage instead of prepackaged kielbasa. Makes all the difference.

I added potatoes and it turned out pretty darn good!  Cut potatoes into small cubes, sauteé for about 10 minutes, then set aside.  Add them to the dish with 10 minutes or so left to cook.

I followed the directions.  This recipe would have been a 5 Star recipe if not for all that sugar.  Next time I make it, i will start with 1 teaspoon, taste, then add more if necessary.  I have a sweet tooth but not in a cabbage and sausage dish.  However, the recipe was spot on for everything else.  Thank you.

This was absolutely delicious. The flavor was amazing!!! My husband said it would go well with a beer, and I can totally see that tasting good with this recipe. As others did, I added a potato. I also changed the order a little, by first frying and removing the bacon, and then the kielbasa. I then sauteed the onion and garlic in the fat til fragrant, added the sugar and seasonings, and then tossed in the cabbage. After the cabbage softened for 10 minutes, I added the potatoes and kielbasa back in. YUM!! I will definitely be making this again.

Liked this recipe. Different from the way I typically make cabbage, but good. I didn't have caraway seeds and used very little pepper flakes. I've also made this with chicken apple sausage. Both ways were delicious.

I didn't have caraway seeds and I avoid pepper flakes so it was all yummy cabbage and sausage flavored - tinged a little because my water prematurely evaporated.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I'll use less crushed red pepper flakes. I omitted the sugar. I like the suggestion on one of the comments to add potatoes and carrots.

Made exactly as is except doubled the meat. Served with mashed potatoes. Delish! Next time may try browning the kielbasa first and adding red potatoes and carrots as others have mentioned, but very good recipe. Highly recommend!

This was good! A great use of cabbage, and east to make with only 1 pan required. I think next time, I'm going to nix the sugar and add some ground mustard and extra red pepper.

I followed the recipe substituting red cabbage for green.  I cooked the bacon followed by the kielbasa, draining off and reserving about half the grease.  Even then, the end result seemed greasier than it needed to be.  My husband loved it; it was just okay for me.  Next time, I'll use green cabbage, no bacon (frying the kielbasa should provide enough grease and flavor), no sugar, chicken bouillon in the water; and serve the kielbasa links intact on the side.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was great - what a fun recipe to play with as well.  The way I made it turned out sooo yummy.  Used no bacon, but had a bit of bacon fat to fry with, used chick broth in place of water, sauteed a stalk of celery with onion and used some chick sausage that I had on hand. Had a yellow pepper on hand which I added to saute. Also used a scant of Linhing powder  (a red powder from Taiwan - very sweet).  I think the am't of sugar would be way too much.  I used a tsp. of caraway seeds which I've hardly ever found use for and they made it so great - a bit of a scrumptious unusual taste! I Will increase a bit next time.   We devoured this !

I "liked" this recipe. I did not have caraway seeds, so I don't know if that  would have made a difference, but this was a little sweet. When I make this recipe again I will use half if not less of the sugar.

Very good, hearty dish.  I would cut back to 2 tsp caraway seed since they tend to overpower dishes.

This is an inexpensive, quick meal to make when you have a lot of mouths to feed. I varied from the recipe only that I peeled and thinly sliced some potatoes and fried those prior to adding the cabbage. I also did not have caraway seed, so I had to leave that out. Good, easy recipe.

This was excellent!  I made it exactly as written except I didn't used caraway seeds as I didn't have any.  Next time I plan to reduce the sugar just a tad and add a little more crushed red pepper.  We like a little heat!

This was great ! I did make a few changes. One slice of bacon only. No sugar instead added a peeled cut up apple.  I did not add water, I added egg noodles at the end.  Oh I did not have any caraway seeds.

Hearty side dish.  I left out the red pepper flakes for the kids sake.  Next time, I will pour out most of the bacon fat and add less liquid (I used chicken broth).

Really good, but too much sugar.  I would reduce to 1T next time to see how it tastes, possibly not sugar at all.  The hot peppers were a nice touch.

We liked it.  I used bacon  crumbles to make it a little healthier and other oil to saute the cabbage and onions. A good quick inexpensive meal for those on the go.

This was a departure from my normal kielbasa-and-cabbage dish, but I really like it. I took others' advice and browned the kielbasa and onions in the bacon drippings. Also, the only seasoning I added was kosher salt: The kielbasa had garlic in it and I didn't have the other seasonings. This is going into my recipe box! Thanks for sharing.

Husband loved it, as did I.  I may have added fewer seeds and more onion and garlic.  I added cheddar peirogies (the frozen kind).  The kids didn't like it, except for the kielbasa, so 4 stars.

This was too sweet, and I used half of the amount of caraway seeds and still found the flavor a bit overwhelming. I added about 3 diced red potatoes. This was just "ok", and I probably won't make it again.

My family really liked this but I thought it was a little sweet and would probably cut back on the sugar if I made it again.  Also, I didn't add caraway seeds and would be curious how that would change the dish.

overall, fast and delicious. we got cabbage from the farm share, and needed something to do with it. my only adjustment is that when you add the cabbage, add the water last to cut down on the smoke from the pan.

After reading over the ingredients I decided to omit the caraway seeds and garlic. We love anything with cabbage so I expected it to be good. We loved this dish served with some butter and parsley potatoes. We'll be having this one in our monthly rotation! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I didn't used the carraway seed. I used a pan and a pot to cook this in. I fried the bacon in the pan.  After cooking the bacon, I set the bacon to the side. I kept the bacon grease in the pan and added diced onion, mined garlic, sugar, and crushed red pepper. In the pot, I fried the kelsiba.  After it was brown, I added in the onion mixture and cabbage. Cooked the cabbage till tender and added the chopped up bacon pieces. Was super delicious!

Have followed this several times. Picky husband actually requests this. Making it tonight! Going to try adding potatoes and carrots, like others have done. (Also, sometimes we make it without the bacon, because we don't have any, or because we are lazy and hesitant to open the pack for a few pieces. Still turns out great without it!)

Loved it??  I DID make a few changes though. I didn't add any sugar. I did add six slices of Maple flavored Bacon instead of the plain bacon. I didn't have any caraway seeds so as a substitute, I put a tsp of celery salt in. I also used Turkey kielbasa to make it less fatty. Yum??

This was delicious!  I browned my slices of kielbasa first out of personal preference.  It was a very enjoyable texture, not soupy and not dry, just moist and the cabbage was tender but not mushy.  I didn't have the oomph today to fry up the bacon first, so I just used some bacon drippings I keep in the freezer to get a head start. It yielded a lot of food!  I used cabbage from the garden and a plain nitrate-free kielbasa. The next time I make it I will experiment a bit, as I really like apples with my kielbasa.  I'm sure there are some healthy modifications you could make too if you want to go a little lighter.  This is going in my recipe book! Great Recipe!

Although it didn't look attractive (but what cabbage recipe does?), I thought this was really good.  It seemed like I was putting in an awful lot of caraway seeds but it didn't overpower the dish.  The only thing I may do next time is to cut the sugar in half.  It was a bit sweet.

Turned out ok and the kids liked it so that was a win. However, it was too sweet for my wife and I.  Great dinners on a budget.

I used 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds instead of caraway seeds and 1 tablespoon of sugar instead of 2.

This dish was delicious.

My first time cooking cabbage OR kielbasa and I loved it! So easy and quick to throw together. I omitted the bacon because I forgot it at the grocery store :( Was quite tasty without it, though I think it would add something extra special.

I made a half recipe, no sugar or caraway, and added 3-4 small cubed potatoes (~2 c).  They took a long time to cook so i would cook them all the way next time in microwave (parcooking in micro didn't suffice).  I browned sausage first, removed, added onion, garlic, cabbage, bacon pieces.  Added potatoes, and then lastly sausage.   I thought it was plenty sweet without any sugar added.  I liked it with the potatoes so id keep it the same.

I added more veggies: red potatoes and red peppers. left out caraway because I don't like it. Big hit. Very tasty and hearty. I mean...sausage and bacon, how can you go wrong?! Next time I will add sliced or grated carrot.

This was delicious, and I made it exactly as written (except for the caraway seeds, which I didn't have.) It was a bit too sweet for us, so next time I will reduce the sugar to 1 T. I also will use about half of the drippings that I had left from 6 pieces of bacon. Other than that, this is a very good recipe.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I didn't have Caraway Seeds, so subbed with Celery Seeds.  It worked out quite nicely.  Delish, we will be making this again and again!

I read a few of the reviews and really glad I did, 

I fried the sausage and used bacon lardons. once oils extracted added diced boiled potato and 3 chopped tomatoes to the sausage......loved the way the potato broke down with the tomato to create a more moist combination when all was added together at the end. I also love a bit of a spicy kick, so used chipotle chilli flakes for a deeper flavour.
All the extras are wasted though if you don't choose a good sausage, !!

This is  a great basic recipe to make . - I only used 2 slices  of  bacon , 1/2 head cabbage and1 tsp of  caraway seed - we loved it -- served it with hash browns,  winter squash and   fruit on side -- I did not find  it  too sweet like some reviews said and I will be  making again.

This was delicious!  I was going to make the Kielbasa with beans and rice, but when this recipe popped up, it sounded like a great change.  I substituted the package of cole slaw I had on hand.  Thanks to naples34102 for her review and picture--I also served it with small buttered rooster potatoes.  Great meal to add to my rotation!

Wow what a delicious dish. I made it for my wife who sometimes complains about my un-American cooking, but she loved it!! I did a combo of what a few reviewers said. I made the bacon and then used the drippings to sauté the onions with garlic, red pepper flakes, and I used a bit of dill because I didn't have caraway. I let that sauté for maybe 7 minutes and then added the cabbage cut into half inch ribbons and then covered for 15 minutes. I also added red potatoes- they were the best addition. I cubed them and microwaved for 3 minutes to soften them and then added them to the mix. I kept it covered while I browned the kielbasa in a separate pan and then at the end I added the kielbasa too. All in all, the cabbage cooked down for maybe 30 min. When I served it, I added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and the bacon crumbles. It was to die for!! Truly a delicious dish!  Thank you all for the recipe and the additions! I'm anxiously awaiting trying the leftovers- I'm sure it will be even better!

It turned out well, but the cabbage was a bit overdone. It would've been better with some added potato and the kielbasa seared separately. I'm going to try it next time, and I'm sure it'll be great!

I will defnately make this again. I made it to the instructions but I did not have caraway seed so I used cumin seed instead and that was delicious. I will reduce the sugar next time.

I loved this dish, the cabbage was cooked perfectly and the taste was unique.  This is now my favorite cabbage dish.  I have made it twice and the second time I left out the bacon at the end and the kielbasa.  It was still great. My only word of caution is make sure you have enough pan to cook with.  The uncooked cabbage takes up a lot of room until it cooks a little.  I made a double batch with my biggest pan and it was tight.

This receipe was easy and it is so delicious! I used all of the listed ingredients except caraway seeds.  I had to make some hot-water cornbread to accompany this dish! The 5-Star rating came from everyone in my family!!!

This is a very easy and delicious dish, the only thing I changed was no carawy seed and I added water as needed. I found it took a little longer that the 15 min. stated in the receipe but will defenitley make this again.

The recipe is a little sweet and uses caraway.  We like caraway, but will cut back on the sugar next time. The bacon also is a little overkill in the fat department considering that the cabbage is being served with Kielbasa.  We will definitely try this recipe again with a few tweaks.

I used 4oz of homemade bacon, 14oz of turkey kielbasa, an extra teaspoon of garlic, and left out the carraway. I also added 6 small-medium red potatoes, lightly boiled, when I added the cabbage. The flavor was excellent right out of the pan but not quite as good the next day. It was easy to make and so good on day 1 that I'll definitely be making it again, though. Next time I'll probably leave out the water because the cabbage put off plenty of its own.

I've made this recipe 3 times and the first 2 times it came out real good because I used at least 1 cup of water when cooking the cabbage.  This time I used 1/2 cup water and didn't watch it close enough and the cabbage started to burn.  I also used just 1/2 the sugar.  Other than that it is really good.

I substituted red wine for the water and it was a delicious addition! I did remove the cabbage, then browned and cooked the kielbasa and when it was good and browned, I added the cabbage back and warmed it all. It was wonderful.

The whole family loved it, including my semi-picky kids. We had NO LEFTOVERS! I had to substitute Cumin for the Caraway, because that's what we had on hand. No regrets at all! I look forward to trying this again with the Caraway seeds!

Loved this!  Wasn't sure about the red pepper flakes, but used them anyway,  and now I'm glad I did.  We are on the Atkins (High Fat Low Carb) eating style, so I made a small batch for 2 people and used slightly different proportions with a lot more fat (we've each lost about 20 lbs eating this way, and our blood/cholesterol numbers are improving all the time!): Since we don't eat pork, I used 3 slices turkey bacon fried in butter; 2/3 lb turkey kielbasa chunked and fried separately in butter; 1 small head cabbage sliced in wide strips (there's another lunch serving of cabbage mixture left over!); half of one medium onion sliced into rings; 1 1/2 tsp caraway seeds; abt 1/4 tsp stevia instead of sugar; and while hunting for other cabbage recipes I found a mention of using apple cider vinegar.  Sounded good, so I added two capfuls, and it really boosted the flavor. Didn't use garlic.  Might try that next time, but it was great without it. Everything else was done the same as the recipe recommended. Fast, easy and very tasty!!!  Thanks for this recipe!

I used breakfast sausage instead of bacon, had no kielbasa, but the water was broth from boiling off the bone from my Christmas ham. I used a sweet onion so I omitted the sugar. I also upped the red pepper flakes and added some kosher salt. Boyfriend loved it...

I love the recipe. I had to change it up for kids. I used salt and pepper instead of seasoning salt and red pepper. I also sautéed the onions and sausage before using as others suggested.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have any caraway seeds and I don't think they were missed. I will definitely make this recipe again. Also, I only used about a tablespoon of the bacon grease. I think any more would have been too much.

I love finding a new recipe and reading other reviewers comments as to what would improve it.  Many reviewers stated this dish was too sweet so I cut the sugar to one tsp.  I am not a big caraway fan so used one tsp.  Added 3 small potatoes, cut into pieces(per many reviewers advice).  I used apple cider instead of water.  Next time I will use beer because it is still a very sweet dish.  I browned the kielbasa in the bacon drippings.  It was a very satisfying dish.  My husband and I both loved it.  I served it with buttermilk cornbread baked in my favorite iron skillet.  Yummy!  We must have liked it too much because it's supposed to feed 6 and we ate almost every bite.  Thank You!

I was very skeptical as this recipes calls for you to pour water into hot bacon grease but it has a lot of great reviews so o figured I'd try it. Since this seemed like a really bad idea to me (water and grease/oil are not friends), I decided to put all the spices/seasonings in first. They immediately began to burn and our entire apartment filled with thick, gray smoke in a matter of seconds. Guess I should try putting in the onions first next time (mistake on my part). We're going to attempt this again now but using vegetable oil instead as we have no bacon grease left. I'll leave another review if it turns out ok.

I'm of Polish descent, and this is EXCELLENT! I make sauteed cabbage frequently, but this is different than how I usually do it. I normally don't do the bacon/cook in the grease, but added a lot of flavor. I did follow other's suggestions as well: sauteed kielbasa to brown beforehand and added about 5 min before cabbage was done. I also had some small red potatoes that I needed to use. Cubed them, microwaved 3-4 min, and added those with the kielbasa. Don't usually do sugar, seasoned salt or red pepper flakes, but all of those are great additions! This always tastes better the next day, so I think I'll wait for the main meal! Will go great with a cold brewski! Thanks KITKATY!

This was tasty but the caraway seed was overwhelming.  If I make this again I would just put the caraway seed to taste.  Also didn't use the bacon.  The sausage taste was enough.

I think I will make this again just without the caraway seeds. I do not like the taste of it or anything in the family of anis. I think it is a rich recipe so if you do not like rich this is definitely not a recipe for you. Otherwise, eat a small portion of it. Those criticizing the fat contents of this recipe need to think twice if they want to eat French next time plus they better realize the origins of the recipe...The calorie content of most of the recipes at Allrecipes.com are included. All the tools for making the right choices are here. I love this website precisely because of that!

I also sauteed the onions in the bacon grease and added potatoes (I had a can of white ones in the cupboard). The sugar in this recipe is pure genious. Loved it!

Fantastic recipe! Made this tonight, however, had to make a few changes, because of dietary restrictions; omitted the bacon and used olive oil instead. Used 2 lb.'s of Turkey Kielbasa polish sausage & took the advise of another reviewer and fried the Kielbasa before adding it to the cabbage.  Used the suggested amount of caraway seed and used kosher salt and garlic powder instead of seasoned salt.  Since was not using bacon and to avoid dryness, at the end of the cooking time, added 1/2 cup of chicken broth!   Sorry for too many changes, but thought the people who have dietary restrictions like I, can benefit from it.

Kitkaty, thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.  This is a keeper in my recipe file.

This was quick, simple, and yummy. I did not use the caraway seeds and next time I will skip the crushed red pepper for the kids. Otherwise, it was great!

Wow! There was nothing leftover from our first try at this.  I did add potatoes but not the caraway seeds.  Also added a good portion of freshly ground black pepper and a little salt.  My boys loved this.  Both the 18yr and 8 yr told me they wanted more!

We liked it  lot.  I made changes as follows:  2 slices of bacon rather than 6.  Used turkey kielbasa and added chunked  microwave cooked potato and 1 carrot sliced.  Did not use caraway seeds because we are not fans.  It was a little bland so we added a little spicy mustard and a bit of vinegar.  Everyone is different but we really liked this great comfort dish.

I had company and I made this dish.  Everyone loved it and had seconds. It was so delicious. I took all the credit! I can't wait to incorporate the cabbage preparation with other dishes, like corned beef. I get a lot of cabbage form my csa and glad I found a solid recipe.

Delicious! I made it as written except I used apple juice in place of the water and sugar per another review. I suggest when buying your cabbage, choose a really green one. Mine was more creamy than green and the finished product was a little drab. BUT - great flavor and oh my husband LOVED it!!

I made this without the caraway seeds because I don't have those, still delicious! A whole large head of cabbage wouldn't fit in my large pan, maybe I had a giant head of cabbage. 1/2 of it was more than enough!

Very good! I omitted sugar and onion and used canned potatoes to save time. Also cut bacon in pieces, fried it, and just added the other ingredients to it as recipe says. Seemed to save time I think.

Made the recipe exactly as written except I cut the caraway amount in half.  Although my husband and I enjoyed this(served with perogies), we still felt that the caraway flavor overpowered everything.  My son (who usually loves everything cabbage) did not like it. We felt, generally, that if every spoonful of cabbage had either sausage or perogie with it that it was more palatable.  Unfortunately, my son still didn't agree.  Definitely cut back on the caraway.

This was very good.  I made a few changes to make it healthier.  I only fried two pieces of bacon instead of six.  I added four tablespoons of olive oil to make up for the rest of the bacon grease.  I only added 1 tablespoon of sugar.  I don't like really sugary foods.  I also added a sprinkle of 100% real bacon bits and 1/4 teaspoon of regular salt when adding the onions.  I used turkey kielbasa.  I added another sprinkle of 100% real bacon bits at the end when crumbling the two pieces of bacon.  It goes well with a baked potato on the side.

I totally enjoyed this recipe and made it as written except for the sugar. I put 2 teaspoons of Splenda in and that was too much so I think I'll leave it out next time because there will definitely be next times. There is enough natural sugar in cabbage for me. I also only had a medium sized head of cabbage which made it meatier and I loved it. Loved both the caraway and the red pepper flakes. They gave it an extra great flavor. I used to make cabbage with bacon and no kielbasa and eat it over noodles. I'll be trying this over noodles next. Delicious and thanks for the recipe! By the way, in my opinion, if you don't try the recipe then you shouldn't rate it.

I left out the bacon and cut down the sugar to a tablespoon and just used bacon fat that I had been saving in the refrigerator.  We enjoyed it this way but will be cutting down the sugar to a rounded teaspoon next time.  We felt it was a little too sweet.

This is an easy fast recipe. If I don't have bacon I just use butter to saute everything in. I only put a dash of sugar, this is my personal preference. Also I don't use caraway seeds because I don't like them.

sugar with the cabbage ruined the flavor.  Bacon wasn't necessary except to keep it from burning.  If I made this again I would try tomato soup with the cabbage.

I had already cooked the grease from some sidemeat and was boiling it with the cabbage when I came across this recipe.  Except for the bacon, I added all the ingredients listed into the boiling water.  It turned out great!!

Absolutely wonderful,sauce onions and garlic first in bacon grease,then add rest, also Brown kielbasa separately before adding to this dish. This would be wonderful without the kielbasa too. Thanks for a great recipe.

Didn't have seasoned salt, so just replaced with salt. This is VERY good and so easy. Made it with beer bread (1 can beast lite + 3 cups self-rising flour, 1 hour at 375). Used the bread to soak up juices - so good!

I made the recipe as directed and found it to be delicious.  I used splenda instead of sugar but followed the remaining directions as written.  Very tasty and not too sweet in my opinion.  Looking forward to making it again in the future.

This recipe was way too sweet for our tasting. We did, however use GOOD bacon that did not produce a large amount of drippings, which helped some. We thought that maybe cutting the sugar back and doing away with the caraway seeds would help. Not that doing so would matter too much, we will never make it to this recipe again. There are too many flavors and seasonings that seem to need too much tweaking to really come close to being a "version" of this recipe.

I would suggest this recipe to someone who's family enjoys a sweet tasting supper, but since ours does not, I would suggest something different.

We love it! Made it for years and had gotten away from it due to youngsters tastes. Felt I was forgetting something so I looked up here. My original (was out of "Women's Day", I remember) had 2 Tbl. Cider Vinegar, which I eventually changed to Malt Vinegar, and 1 Tbl. sesame seeds at the last 15 min....AND.... 2  1/4rd & cored Macintosh apples....AND....Ground Ginger (about 1/2 tsp). Hope someone tries it and enjoys. The old version seems a bit more Germanic to me. Today I finished it off with a couple dashes of sesame oil at the very finish and it was super! Originally had buttered egg noodles with this but will try with the potato or pierogies (that sounds simply divine). Thanks  so much for the recipe and the suggestions.

I didn't have caraway seeds so I substituted 1 tsp fennel seeds,  1 tsp oregano, and 1/4 tsp ground cumin. It was delicious! I also used red cabbage as that is what I had in the fridge.

 I can't wait to try it with caraway seeds!

This was a good recipe.  I didn't really do anything to change it, it was very tasty as is!  It was a little greasy and maybe I'm not the biggest fan of cabbage but my husband really enjoyed it so I will probably be making this again.

This recipe is pretty good but I had to kick it up a notch.  Substituted beer for the water, and finished my dish with boiled perogies that did it MMMWAAA.  If you made this recipe and thought wait. . . something is missing well try it out yourself let us know what you think. Bon Appetit!!

Wow, was this good! I had been wanting to incorporate cabbage into my meals and found this recipe. I cooked this 30 minutes early before my guests arrived and I lowered heat to simmer which worked out just fine and possibly helped let all the ingredients mix. I had a baked potato left over (plain) from the other night, cut into chucks and threw in the last 10 minutes. This was delicious and my guests all went for seconds!  Thank you!

Made pretty much as written and it was very good.  I liked cooked cabbage much more than I expected.  However, while not the fault of the recipe writer, I found I didn't love kielbasa that much.  It's very different from the sausages I am used to and much fattier/softer.  My husband describes it as more like a fancy hot dog flavor.  If you like kielbasa though, I think this is a winning recipe.  

My one alteration was that like others, I added in some redskin potatoes.  It made the meal complete.

The taste was great.  I used fennel seeds which might be the same thng as caraway..anyway it had a different unusal flavor and we loved it.  definitely will make again.  We added little red boiled potatoes.

Wow. Amazing recipe. I too added potatoes but didn't pre cook them...just browned a bit and simmered with the cabbage. I didn't have any bacon, but I always  my bacon grease, so I used that and some KIRKLAND crumbles bacon I keep on hand for salads. I had no caraway and cut the red pepper in half...my better half doesn't like spice. I also browned my kielbasa as I like the char taste. This is going into the regular rotation.

This has been my go-to cabbage and kielbasse recipe since I found it. I've never used bacon or bacon grease with it either (though I'd love to; I just don't have bacon on hand very often); I just add a bit more water and salt or a splash of beef broth and call it good. I usually serve it with a homemade creamy horseradish dip as well.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was delicious from the first time I made it. I've made a few slight changes because of either family preference or convenience. I used two kielbasas instead of one; a few extra slices of bacon (both my husband's request); a bag of cole slaw cabbage with carrots instead of chopping a head of cabbage (to save prep time). I make seasoned roasted potatoes to go with it, which take just 10 minutes in the microwave. I recommended the original recipe to a friend who doesn't like cabbage, and she loved it. I think the bacon fat, sugar, and blend of caraway seeds and spices helps take the edge off of any strong cabbage taste.

This was delicious! I took the advice of others and sauteed the onions and garlic in the drippings first. I also boiled two potatoes then sauteed them in a separate pan with additional bacon and the kielbasa. Most definitely a repeat!!! Thanks for the recipe KITKATY!

I've used allrecipes for a couple years now & this has to be my favorite recipe so far! I crave it all the time. I think the sugar gives it the perfect sweetness. I agree with the reviewer in pan frying the kielbasa seperately until browned, maks it even better.I always serve it with a baked potato & hawaiian sweet rolls, & of course the sour cream & bacon crumbles on top of the dish. I also always add 2 carrots to the mix.Perfect dish in my opinion, Thank you!

Fantastic recipe.  Was looking for ways to use cabbage from the garden beside your typical coleslaw.  Family loved this, I took some to my mom who immediately asked for the recipe so she could take it to a pot luck dinner that very evening.  Thanks for offering this great recipe.  I will definately be making it again.

I, too, browned up the kielbasa while the cabbage was cooking, then added it in to cook with the cabbage for about 15 or 20 minutes. I'm  not a huge fan of caraway, but it really does add a lot to the flavor of this dish. Add an extra sprinkle of red pepper flakes - and it's dee-lish!

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband and I do a lot of cooking together and this was one that was very easy for us to "share" the cooking.  We loved the flavors and served it with mashed potatoes.  We will be sure to share this recipe with others.

Excellent. I added carrots and red potatoes. I did not par boil the potatoes. It does not need that. I also grow my own chard, so the second time I made this, I added a couple handfuls of that. I also made more, since there were no leftovers the first time. I also used a large pot the second time because my 10 inch skillet just barely held it all the first time. Highly recommended. Perfect for stormy weather!

We loved it.  I added potatoes and pan fried the kielbasa and some other reviewers suggested.  Even my picky 15yr old brother in law liked it.  :)

Very tasty and a great dinner on a cold blustery day.  The balance of sweet and hot works well.

Delicious! I added a few potatoes, skipped the bacon and reduced the sugar down to 1 tablespoon, even then it was bordering on too sweet. Other than that, I loved it! I also cooked the kielbasa first, removed it and then cooked everything else in the same pan.

my Husband gave it 4 stars, but I give it 5 stars. YUM revisions:  I didn't have pepper flakes  or caraway seed so i added 1/2 tsp of coriander seed, and 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper. I also added one sliced carrot and 4 small peeled and diced potatoes. I pre cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 4 minutes and added them last to the pot.   This is a sensational recipe!!! thank you.  Lisa

So goooood!  I made this recipe a few hours before going to a football game in the pouring rain, and it definitely filled me up and was just what the Dr. ordered for such a night.  My boyfriend scarfed it down!  I didn't have any caraway, so instead I crushed equal parts fennel and coriander and it turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for the great recipe-it was a hit!

I was really disappointed with this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. It's not often a recipe with such good ratings lets me down but I have to say, I agree with some of the more negative posts: bland, greasy, blah... definitely not a keeper. I followed most of the recipe but added a potato and fried the kielbasa as others suggested.     This was really missing a punch of flavor that is usually present in german food. Try Gramma Jeanette's Cabbage instead and add some cooked kielbasa for a better result!

I made this for supper last night and my husband really enjoyed it! I served it with a few perogies and a dollop of sour cream on top. We will definitely make this again.     PS. I was reading some Polish recipes online and this one is actually a traditional peasant dish- interesting!

This dish was bland and too greasy for us.  Normally I boil my kielbasa, cabbage and potatoes, I definitely will go back to my version.  We tossed this to the trash.

This was very good!  I didn't use caraway because I didn't have it, but it tasted fine anyway.  Has a good little spice to it!  Great taste but not great for the waistline!

I will make this again.  I used a little less caraway seed than the recipe called for because I had never made anything with this spice.  It was different, but we like it. This is one of those dishes that the more you eat the better you like.

This needed a little something more to us. I have never been to Germany or had "real" German food. I doubled the spices and it still needed something else. We added more salt and wine vinegar at the table and it was much better in our opinion.

This is a solid recipe for Keilbasa and cabbage.  I added a little more water and some potatoes as that was how I was tought to cook it.  You could also add carrots if you desire.  The amt of carraway seeds may be overpowering for some.  I'll cut this back 1/2 next time I cook it.  Also, I browned the sausage in the oven prior to adding to the cabbage mixture.  Enjoy.

I was skeptical at first, it didn't sound like the most amazing dish.  BUT, it turned out wonderful, followed the recipe exactly, the cabbage carmelized perfectly and the taste was tangy.

This recipe was ok. I love the blend of the cabbage and sausage but it was a little too greasy for me.  Next time i will leave out the bacon.  Following other suggestions I only added 1 tsp of the caraway seeds but I think next time I will leave that out as well.

I made a few changes to this recipe but not drastic ones.  I used half the bacon and did not use the drippings, I used olive oil instead. I also used chicken broth instead of water to give it extra flavor.  I browned my kielbasa and also added cubed potatoes that I had boiled and then browned in olive oil.  I added the kielbasa and potatoes at the very end.  We thought it was delicious and will be making again.

Yummy! I did it a little  different; after frying the bacon, I added some lite Kielbasa sauteed till browned, set it aside and then added the cabbage and onion, sauteed till soft. Skipped the pepper flakes(hubby doesn't like hot stuff). It turned out delicious.  This is a definite keeper for us since we're on a low carb diet!! Next time I think I'll add lite beer(Mich Ultra) instead of the water.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I changed up with some splenda instead of sugar (about a 1/2 packet) and some white zinfandel wine instead of water.   As well, added some pre-boiled aldante' baby carrots and a dash of apple cider vinegar to taste when plated.  Yummy.

I liked it but the rest of the family was not so excited about it. Although I have to add that I grew up in Germany and we had Cabbage once in a while, so I am used to the taste whereas my husband only ever had it in Coleslaw and some boiled cabbage.

The experiment was a huge success with the family. Even the cabbage hater devoured it. I did make a couple of changes though, I added celery and cider vinegar. It turned out wonderful. Its an absoulte must for anybody looking for a new comfort food. I also noticed that alot of people didn't use the carraway seed. I strongly recommend it. It added a delicious flavor to it.

This was quite tasty.  I kept wanting to add vinegar, since it just seemed like I should, but I didn't.  I always add red wine vinegar at the end now.  The red pepper flake and the caraway made a flavorful combination.  I usually forget the sugar, good with it and without it.

Good but not great. Maybe because I didn"t have the caraway seeds. Not sure.

Instead of water, I used homemade chicken broth and after cooking the kielbasa, I threw in a half package of cooked thick egg noodles. I also added a little fresh ground pepper. We all loved this dish. NO leftovers. NOTE: For those looking for a cheap and filling meal to stretch your food budget, this is a great recipe to do that.

I made this last night and find the caraway seeds are a must.  We did find it a little too sweet, I suggest cut the sugar in half.  Even though, we enjoyed it very much, it's worth making again.

Since I do not really know how too cook I followed the recipe exactly,  except I also did not add the caraway seed. I did I think frying the bacon and then the onions adds alot of flavor.  After reading some review I took the kielbasa out of the cabbage and saute in in a little of bacon fat I had left over from breakfast. I really allowed the cabbage too cook the full 30 mins and still it was a little more firm than I like but will be great tomorrow.  After it finished cooking I serve it up in indv bowls and stirred in  a teaspoon of sour cream  in what a difference that made it was wonderful.  I would never n a million years thought to have added sour cream to cabbage but the flavor was wonderful . My husband really liked it we will definitely  make it again. thank for sharing

Since I am new to cooking, I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add the caraway seeds as many reviewers suggested.  My husband and I thought it was good enough to eat, but we will not make it again.  Maybe we've just learned that we're not really cabbage people, though.

Stored 2 half gallons with original recipe. Bacon really added a nice flavor. Also, I only have a caraway plant with no seeds so I used about 1 1/2 tsp of caraway leaves. Used 1 large garden cabbage and about 1 1/2 lb kielbasa.

My husband LOVED this and keeps asking for it but I've only made it once because it seems like a lot of work to me. I'm not the best cook, so it takes me a long time to prep the stuff and it was hard to keep it all in the skillet since there was so much. I added 2 boiled and cubed potatoes to the cabbage mixture, and I cut & browned the keilbasa seperately in a little bit of olive oil before adding to cabbage mixture. I skipped the caraway seeds.

This was edible but I agree with my BF when he said "You can eat this, but never, ever make this again."  And it was my fault because I should have known better. I intensely dislike Northern European food, so I don't know why I tried boiled cabbage with sausage.  It's probably because I love, love, love fried kielbasa.  But boiled it was bland and mushy and boiled cabbage is and always will be boiled cabbage.  When it comes to products from Northern/central Europe, from now on I'll just stick to sausage, beer, and luxury motor cars.

I loved this recipe and thought it was a great way to fix cabbage, with our without the kielbasa. I used applewood smoked bacon and had some apple cider vinegar on the table for drizzling on top. I ate it without the vinegar, but my husband used it and thought it made the dish superb.

Good base to play with. We roasted red, yukon, and sweet potatoes with Roast Potatoes recipe and they paired nicely with the spicy sausage and tangy cabbage.

Gave it 5 stars for ease of cooking.  What a great quick meal.  The cabbage tasted good with the hint of sweetness.  My family of 3 ate the whole dish.  I did leave out the caraway though as no one likes that flavor so it was not missed at all without it.

Tasty.  I will leave out the caraway next time.  I had reduced it dramatically and still felt it was too much.  I guess I just don't like that flavor much.  All else was great.  I used chicken broth instead of water to up the flavor and this worked nicely.  Served it with baked potatoes and bread.

I've made this twice now, and it's been absolutely delicious both times.  Perhaps that's why it only made 3 servings.  I may never cook Polish sausage or kielbasa any other way again.
Thank you!

This was well received for our Superbowl party!  I diced potatoes and carrots, boiled them until semi-soft, and added them into the cabbage about 10 minutes into the cooking.  I also added only 1.5 T of sugar, and 1.5 tsp of caraway.  Cooking times were right on.  I chopped my cabbage VERY coarse.  I do wish the recipe would specify an actual "amount" of cabbage though.  Anyhow, all comments were great.  Will make this again with more vegetable variations!

Wow! Loved this recipe. It is simple and filling with lots of flavor. I cubed 2 red potatoes and let them simmer in 1 cup of water for about  minutes to get them started cooking.Then added the chopped onions and garlic to the potatoes for a few minutes, then added cabbage, sausage and seasoning and let it simmer until the cabbage was tender. I omitted the bacon just because I didn't have any on hand. The potatoes added a nice texture to it and by letting the onions and garlic simmer with them, they were full of flavor. Overall, they added a nice punch to this dish. Even my three year old asked for seconds!

This was fantastic! I cubed 4 red potatoes & microwaved them for 5 mins then cooked them with the cabbage mixture. I used a bag of shredded cabbage instead of a head of cabbage & cooked the cabbage mixture for 10 mins, meanwhile I had cut the kielbasa into 4 pieces & browned that seperatly in a med fry pan & when the cabbage was done, I added the kielbasa & cooked it all for 5 mins then served. Didn't use caraway seeds because I don't have any. If you are serving this as a main dish I would suggest also serving a side dish. It was filling but after an hour we were still hungry so I will make a side dish next time. This was a very simple recipe, usually my husband helps fix dinner but this time he didn't have to since it was such a simple meal. Being of Polish descent, this tasted like all those wonderful Polish meals I grew up with. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

One of our favorite, reoccuring, easy meals. 3 tspns is WAY too much caraway seeds for us so we cut it back to 1 tsp. And, like many other recipes, we upped the bacon a bit since it gets eaten by all while the meal is cooking.

Good recipe!  It tasted even better the next day when reheated.  I did add a couple more potatoes than recipe said, but didn't change a thing other than that.

Really good flavor.  I would suggest slicing the onion instead of chopping and would cut down the caraway a bit.  Also, I used turkey kielbasa and cut down the bacon to reduce the fat.  Very tasty recipe....thanks!

Good recipe with a slight kick.  Made exactly as stated but next time I will throw some potatoes in like other reviewers suggested.  It just needed something more.  Will make again.  Kids did not like the cabbage but enjoyed the sausage.  Thanks

I used turkey kielbasa and only 3 slices of bacon and it still came out very good-my husband ate 3 helpings and didn't notice the low fat meat!

I followed the recipe exactly (unusual for me)& while it was not bad it was not a hit with the family at all-they wanted "good ole saurkraut with sausage".  I think it is rather bland tasting & needed more sausage.

This was good. I didn't have the caraway seed so I left that out. I also cooked it to long. But it was still very good. next time I won't use the red pepper flakes, i didn't think that the flavor went with this dish. Other then that i will make again and again.

Wow!  My 16 year old thought it sounded awful!  I'm really used to back east food like this, so it sounded FINE to me!  Made it...OMG! The whole family powered through the pan...nothing left but a few bites, which I took quick advantage of!  No changes except I didn't add caraway, which I didn't have... Made it with boiled potatoes with butter on the side. Thanks for the nostalgic recipe, it will become a regular!  Yum!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  Very, very tasty.  Have made it twice.  First time with the bacon drippings and the second time using canola oil instead for cholesterol purposes.  Both were excellent.  Since I didn't use the bacon drippings the second time I put Bacos in when cooking the cabbage and then put the bacon pieces on before serving.  So it did get a lot of the bacon flavor.  Thank you for sharing.

pretty good, but it seemed like it was missing something.  Couldn't figure out what it was.  Make sure you also use some really good frozen veggies.  That could have been part of my problem.

My kid's liked the sausage. I have never really used the caraway seed in anything, so it was a weird taste to me.  It was an ok meal. I also used smoked sausage insteat of the polish.  For something different in my family it was ok.

This recipe was very quick and easy to make.  I used buttered bow tie noodles with it.  I took some to work for lunch the next day, three people asked for the recipe as it smelled so good.  It also tasted even better the next day.

My husband does not like cabbage, but he thought this dish was great, and so did I!  I used savoy cabbage and added potatoes to the recipe as well.  This one is definitely a keeper!
