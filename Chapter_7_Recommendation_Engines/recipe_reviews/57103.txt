Although we didn't completely enjoy this recipe, the family believes the recipe has lots of potential and will definitely make it again.  Next time, to start, I will add lots more green beans OR reduce the amount of stuffing mix.  I will also NOT saute the green beans before baking - they turned out shriveled, dry, and limp and the 40 minute cook time should be sufficient (especially for French cut beans).

FINALLY a green bean casserole that is not a gross mushy mess. I used 1/2 stick butter, 1 egg, no water or leek and everything else the same. I admit it is a bit dry the way I made it but I really like it. Sometimes I add 3 tablespoons of spaghetti sauce or salsa to my serving.
