I altered this recipe a bit. I left out the orange zest and the garlic(?) from the applesauce and added much more cinnamon then called for. Being that one reviewer said that the meat was bland, I tweaked that a bit too. I seasoned my loin with garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper. I then melted three tablespoons of butter in an oven proof frying pan, along with two tablespoons of honey. I browned the meat on all four sides and then added some of the O.J. I finished the dish in the oven. Once the meat was done, I removed it from the pan to rest and placed the pan back on the stove to scrape up the browned bits and reduce the sauce. The sauce seemed a tad bland, so I also threw in a couple of boullion cubes. The meat was tender, moist and very flavorful and enjoyed very much by my gang.

I alterd the recipe by leaving out the garlic. I just could not bring myself to add garlic to the apples. Even without if was wonderful.  Would do again.

I made this receipe for my husband and a guest.  It was very good and the applesauce is so easy to make.  I accidently added to much cinnamon. The next time I make this I may add extra cinnamon again.

The roast was pretty tasteless. I think we are used to more spices. The applesauce went well with the pork. Maybe a little less orange zest. It's pretty overpowering. Not a bad recipe, just not much zip.

Added seasoning salt and fresh ground black pepper to the tenderloin; liked the flavor of the pork but could do without the applesauce. I think it would be much easier just to add some of the seasonings to canned applesauce. Will not make again with the applesauce.
