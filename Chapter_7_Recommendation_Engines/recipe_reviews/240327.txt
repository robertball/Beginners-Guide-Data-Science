I just made this salad for supper tonight, for my husband and I. If your planning on trying this recipe I suggest making it right and following the recipe, that includes making the dressing. There isn't a thing I would change to the recipe. It's a great recipe especially on a hot evening when you don't want to heat up your house more.

I didn't make the dressing because I'm in love with a white vinaigrette by Private Selection (Kroger).  I did toast the pine nuts (1st time) and was surprised to find that they taste like bacon.  Great salad, very filling.  Keep in mind, I did 1/4 everything since I didn't need a big salad.

First I should say that I did not make the dressing, just the salad. It was great, and one that I look forward to making again. I will add some red or green onion next time, because I like a little onion in my salad. I drizzled this with a Champagne Vinaigrette that I had on hand. Yum!

Made it just as listed.  Excellent and simple.  We used grilled, marinated chicken tenders.   We will do this again!

Great salad, but next time I will use a rice wine vinegar and add honey to the dressing as it was quite strong on the vinegar side.

Very tasty; I'm not a fan of goat cheese so I used parm instead.

Just. So.  Good!  Exactly as posted.  Even my non-veggie loving kids inhaled this salad.  It's simple and perfect.  Ahhhh...

This salad was amazing!  Although I didn't have tomatoes or corn,  I added a few chopped onions.   The combination of the avocado and goat cheese was sublime.  We also used marinated chicken we had grilled to top it off and used a balsamic dressing we had left over which worked great too.
