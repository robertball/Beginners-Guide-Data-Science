These are pretty good; they have a really nice and chewy texture. They're not as sweet as most other desserts. Mine didn't fluff up in the middle of the pan, so I may have to give them another try. A great use for that jar of molasses sitting in your cupboard!

Very nice cookie! Good chewy texture.  The only change I made was substituted a 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats for the nuts since I'm allergic.  Probably much better with nuts!

Very good.  I doubled the recipe & used two pans, which was good.  a 9 x 13 wouldn't allow for it to bake in the center well.  Delicious.  I put just a little less brown sugar in,  which worked well, as we don't like things too sweet.  Nice texture.

No substitutions. Love it. Very chewy and easy to make as well. Itâ€™s in my favorites.
