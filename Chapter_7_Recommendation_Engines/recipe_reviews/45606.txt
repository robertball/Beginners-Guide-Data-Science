I LOVE reubens, but this recipe left me unfulfilled.  Try this next time -- it was a hit with my family:

In large fry pan add 1 cup vegetable broth, 1 Tbsp. minced garlic, 1 tsp. liquid smoke and 1 cup water.  Bring to a low boil.  Then, cut tempeh at a diagonal for wider slices and simmer them in broth for 20 minutes, turning occasionally as liquid reduces.  Remove from heat and place on a slice of lightly toasted rye, top with sauerkraut and swiss, put under a broiler for a minute so that the cheese melts, add your top slice of rye and serve with thousand island dressing.   

Even my finicky 8 year old loved this one!

I work in a Vegetarian Kitchen.  After 5 years of eating the same food day after day, this is the one sandwich that still sends me into culinary heaven every time I bite into it.  We use earth balance and marble rye bread.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! There are very few things I miss from the land of meat-eating, but reubens are one of them. I rushed home to make this after I found this recipe and was not disappointed. If anything, I found these sandwiches even tastier than the orignal!

This is a dangerous recipe for me - delicious - I have missed reubens!    Here is my version:  Pumpernickel bread (Beefsteak brand) 2 pkgs tempeh makes 8 sandwiches. Slice each tempeh in half to make two squares. Slice those squares in half lengthwise (so that they are twice as thin - really, it works!) Sprinkle the slices with soy sauce before browning them in a little oil in a saute pan.  Remove. Brush one side of bread with butter, place butter-side down on griddle, layer one slice tempeh, cheese, 'kraut, top bread layer.  Flip them carefully! When cheese melts and bread is crisp, open and spread the inside of each piece of bread (not just one side!) with sauce.  Slather. Cut in half, serve. (My children only ate a half sandwich each, so you could say this makes 16 servings but the leftovers are so good - also, it uses up the whole loaf of pumpernickel and less kraut to throw away afterwards so I say make a big batch). The sauce I used was a sort of thousand island minus the relish: 1 c. mayonnaise 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce 1/4 c. catsup 1 tsp. grated onion  You can also dip into the sauce instead of slathering the bread.  I love the slather...messy though.  My version has butter and worcestershire as well as real swiss, so it's not technically vegetarian.  I think this recipe would get lots more attention if we had a better picture!

These were great!  I give it a 4 only because I marinated the temphe in a little bit of soy sauce to give it a salty "corn beef" flavor.  Otherwise a great substitute for a meaty sandwich!

This tastes so close to the real thing, you'll never know the difference.  I would recommend sprinkling the tempeh with a little salt and cracked pepper and frying in olive oil before adding to the sandwich...makes the texture better.  Great idea!

After missing Reubens for 12 years, I was pretty darn excited to find this recipe!  I'm embarrassed as a vegetarian to say I had never heard of tempeh, but I am so glad I tried it!!!! My meat loving sister asked if it tasted like corned beef, and I had to say no, but with marinating the tempeh in soy sauce as per reviews, it captured the saltiness of corned beef, and along with the very distinct, strong reuben flavors of the saurkraut, swiss cheese, rye bread, and 1000 isle dressing, I didn't miss the meat at all!  I am going to make for my meat loving husband to see what he thinks next!  THANK YOU MEL FOR SUBMITTING THIS GEM!!!!!!!!

Really good.  I cut the tempeh in half and sauteed it a bit before putting it on the sandwich.  I also don't like my saurkraut very wet so I sauteed it too so it was less runny.  It was very, very filling!

I made this for dinner tonight, I'm new to tempeh still, but this was super easy to make! definilty making again. I put soy sauce & liquid smoke on the tempeh before lightly frying it. Then I followed the directions in the recipe. Turned out really good.

Never thought about trying to adapt a meatless reuben, so glad I came across this recipe!  I made mine vegan by using Kraft 1000 Island (no egg yolks like most other brands), substituting Earth Balance for butter, and leaving off the swiss cheese.  I mix the kraut in the dressing and put a generous amount on the sandwich - as much as would stay on the bread.  Very tasty!!  Will make again!

I like this recipe. Never tried it though but growing up with tempeh as a cheap alternative to meat, i can make a lot of tempeh-based dish but putting it as a sandwich had never been one of them.

I just started making my own tempeh, bringing the price down to around $1.00/lb (*Well* worth the effort--GEM Cultures had the best price on starter I could find), so we're going to be eating a lot more of it from now own. I started with this recipe last night, since my husband has often spoken lovingly of the seitan reubens I made a few years ago. Delicious!

I poached the tempeh in water, brushed it with a mixture of low-sodium soy sauce, liquid smoke, and pepper, and seared it quickly in a little oil. Otherwise I did everything according to recipe, and served it with a green salad. Very easy, very delicious, and highly recommened (especially for non-vegetarian audiances.)

The Natural Foods store in my neighborhood sells "bacon"flavored tempeh - it's sooo good!  If you can find that variety I recommend using that in place of plain tempeh.  And try it in place of real bacon on BLT's.  Yum.

My husband, a meat-eater, and I, a vegetarian, both love this recipe. We use the three grain blend of tempeh, and we also marinate the tempeh in soy sauce for a 5-10 minutes and fry it in a pan to crisp it up and give it a salty taste. I would strongly recommend this recipe.

I opted for simmering the tempeh in broth, liquid smoke, and garlic, then sauteing as did other reviewers.  It didn't taste quite like a reuben made with meat, but it was a tasty, acceptable substitution.  Even my meat loving husband liked it and says he'll eat it again.

I had this in a vegetarian restaurant and wanted to try to duplicate the recipe.  This was perfect, the only adjustment I made was sauteeing the tempeh in olive oil spray instead of butter to cut down on calories and saturated fat.

This was very good, first time trying Tempeh and loved it.  I marinated it for a bit with olive oil, ginger, and garlic then pan fried it for about 5 minutes in the marinade, otherwise followed the recipe.  I will make this again...probably tomorrow!

This was excellent! I did as the previous reviewer suggested and simmered the tempeh in the broth/liquid smoke/water mixture. After that I fried the slices of tempeh in a little oil, then assembled and grilled it. I do want to add that the recipe directions don't say anything about putting the 1000 island dressing on, but I advise you wait until after you grill it. This was sooo yummy, satisfied my craving for sure!

This was my first tempeh experience.  I was pleasantly surprised! I'm a new vegetarian and reubens are one thing I've really missed.  I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and pan fried my sliced tempeh in olive oil and soy sause prior to putting it on the sandwich.  I swear I wouldn't have known that difference between this and a regular reuben.  I will make again.  OFTEN!

These were just ok as the recipe was written.  I had leftovers the next day and they were phenomenal!  Next time I think I will marinate the tempeh in the sauerkraut juice before cooking.  It definitely adds something to the flavor!

This was excellent! Based on other recipes, I decided to marinate the tempeh first- I used BBQ sauce and worcestershire sauces, since it's what I had.  Delicious!

This one one of my meat eating boyfriends favorite recipes. I also cut the tempeh in half the long way to make it a little thinner and fried it in a little bit of olive oil first. Very tasty and so easy. This is definitely a keeper:)

Such a satisfying sandwich!  And a great way to use tempeh.  I took the advice of other reviewers and briefly marinated the tempeh in soy sauce (for as long as it took me to prepare the rest of the sandwich), then fried it in olive oil before I added it to the sandwich and fried that.  Will make these often!

I have a piano-wire cheese slicer which I use to slice the tempeh lengthwise into thin "meat like" slices. I then rub with a Kentucky dry rub and let stand for an hour or two before skillet-frying in a little olive oil. I do everything else as the recipe states, but instead of a thousand island dressing, I chop Harvard beets into a little Hellmann's mayonnaise, and sometimes I just use KFC coleslaw. It's yummy!

I made this for lunch today. It was very good. I'd recommend slicing the tempeh into then filets just like the roast beef in a normal reuben. I sliced mine into wide, then filets then fried it for a bit with salt and pepper. Put the thousand island and tempeh down with cheese on top, sauerkraut on the other bread then broiled in the top rack of the oven for a minute or two. Yum!

great recipe- I am definitely for sauteing the tempeh and sauerkraut prior to placing on the bread.

Reuben sandwiches are one of the very few meat dishes that I miss as a vegetarian.  At resturants, I order Reubens without meat, and that pretty much satisfies my craving.  I didn't love this recipe because the tempeh was a weird addition, I cooked and seasoned it first, but the smell of it in the sandwich clashed with the saurkraut smell. It was okay... marinaded tofu might be better than tempeh.

I only gave three stars because I really didn't like the tempeh put in without additional cooking. Instead, I steamed it and then marinated it in a broth/oil/soy sauce combo so that it was had abetter flavor and was more digestable.

Great- except don't use the Multigrain Tofu, just use the plain.  The other is too bitter.

I made this today as an experiment and will definitely try again.. we didn’t have rye bread and the tempeh didn’t hold the flavor.... I think next time I will also just put in the broiler to melt the cheese. Between the butter and the cheese it was like a grill cheese with thousand island... but, I will try again !! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Absolutely fantastic!  I browned the slice of tempeh before compiling the sandwich.  Sometimes I add grilled onions...just because!

I tried this recipe, and was dissapointed. The reviews were ranting and raving about the dish, so I figured it would be good. What I didn't realize though, was that most of the reviewers are vegetarians! I am about the farthest thing from vegeterian, but my mom wants us to eat healthier, so I tried this recipe. I don't know if I just don't like reuben sandwiches (I've never had one), or if I don't like soy--I'm inclined to think the latter, as I don't like other soy products. Maybe I'll try Kulio's recipe though...

Recipie was great. I made a few substitutions out of neccessity: used pumpernickle bread, vegan swiss substitute and made a dressing with veganaise, sweet relish, tomato paste and garlic. Really tasty and will probably try this one again.

I made this for dinner and really enjoyed it.  Had to sub gruyere for the swiss, but tasty tasty tasty.  I did end up microwaving it for 30 seconds, the tempeh was only lukewarm, but the cheese was melty.

This was ok, not as good as I expected though.  Maybe I got the wrong type of tempeh, since it was the tempeh that really didn't mesh well.

I'm curious if the tempeh is supposed to be cooked BEFORE you make it? This was my first time tasting/cooking tempeh and it was horrible. If you don't know if you like tempeh or not, I would say skip this recipe. I still gave it stars because it's obvious it's a good recipe for those who like tempeh!

Good idea. I don't know if you can say it tastes "exactly like a reuben", but it's got great flavor.

Yummy!  This is also excellent on the George Foreman grill, using Annie's brand Goddess Dressing instead of the thousand island stuff.

It was good but it would be better with a seasoned tempeh. Also I'll definitely slice the tempeh in half so it's not so thick, it was overpowering. Other than that it was very tasty and similar to the real thing:)

What an awesome, inexpensive, easy-to-make, and delicious vegetarian dish.

I will ALWAYS make these!
