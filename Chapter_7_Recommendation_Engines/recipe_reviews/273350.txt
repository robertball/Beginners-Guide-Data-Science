My family loved this and considers it the "best fish tacos ever."

I cubed the fish (about 1 inch cubes) before applying the marinade and broiled it on a rack for 4.5 minutes total (stirring halfway). As with any fish, you don't want to overcook it so watch them time.

Made as written and these were very good. The halibut absorbed the marinade really nice and ended up with a smoky taste like it had been cooked over wood. The one thing I was not crazy about was the cabbage. It needed a light dressing of some sort in my opinion. Overall good recipe and one I will make again.
