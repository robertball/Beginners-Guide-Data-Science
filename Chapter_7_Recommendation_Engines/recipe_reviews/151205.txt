It was a great and easy chili to make!  Make sure you add the chili powder though, it was a little bland without it.  I also added garlic, onion, and an extra cup of water.  Enjoy!

This was very easy and the whole family liked - next time I would use ground pork or our grocery store Italian sausage instead of the jimmy dean - did not like the texture.
