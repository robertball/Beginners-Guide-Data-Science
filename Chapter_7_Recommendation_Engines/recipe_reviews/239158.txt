I was surprised to see how much flavor this had.  I wasn't expecting that because there is only lime juice for liquid.  I used a piece of leftover chicken I'd made before that did have a lot of seasoning to it.  The only change I made was to use Tajin rather than cayenne.  The recipe doesn't state how to use the chicken once it is cooked, so I chose to slice it in thin strips.  I love all the ingredients, and I'd make this again in a heartbeat!  Easy and delicious!  Thanks, RACH7H!

I loved it.  Had the chicken salad on some thin wheat bread.  

I would change a couple things.   I would say the best mixture would be one avocado per pound of chicken.  I had two chicken breasts totaling about 1.8 lbs.  I ended up using just one.  I'm not big on Cilantro, so I didn't use it.  I would use a bit less chopped onion as well.   

Great recipe and certainly something I can build on.  

Thank you very much!

I liked this, but for me it lacked a little bit in flavor.  I know this takes away from the "healthy" aspect of it, but I did add a little mayo.  It did make the flavor pop and made it just a little more like a traditional chicken salad consistency which I liked.  We heaped it on some thick sliced rustic french bread, and yum! the leftovers went in the fridge and the next day after the ingredients had more time to meld together it tasted even better!

Yum, yum, yum! I used canned chicken and two small avocados until I thought the balance was right.

The only change I made was using rotisserie chicken instead of baking my own. I think if I were fixing for my picky children, who might not like the crunchy celery and onions, (even though I dice mine very fine) I could use onion powder and celery salt.  Loved it! Great flavor! I will fix again!

Delicious!! I wanted a healthy chicken salad to put on a sandwich without all the mayo and sour cream. This one has great flavor and the onions really add great flavor!

This recipe is so quick and easy and very tasty!  My husband and I both LOVED it the first time i made it.  I think in the future i will add more avocado, and may marinate the chicken in lime and cilantro before cooking it, but whatever it is, it is delish!

This is awesome! I did twist the recipe a little... I baked the chicken with garlic salt and lemon pepper then chunked it instead of shredding. Also I used lemon instead of lime due to not having any lime. Served over a green salad. The whole family loved it! I will be taking the leftovers for lunch. I plan on wrapping it in a tortilla with some ranch.

This was really good!  I always boil my chicken when I'm going to shed it, makes it go faster.  I added a tablespoon of ranch dressing to cream it a bit, and some dry ranch powder to zest it a bit.  Also, went heavier on the lime and cilantro than the recipe called for, just because I like those ingredients.  I think some cherry tomatoes would be a good addition if I had those on hand.  Served open faced on a piece of bread.  Yum!

This was very good! I left out the scallions and onion and celery. And I sprinkled salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on both sides of the chicken before baking it. I used 2 large avocados and added extra salt. We ate it as a dip with tostada chips. Soooo good!

Delicious! I used juice from a whole lime and two avocados since they were small. I spread Dukeâ€™s mayo on the bread and sliced Campari tomatoes on top. Yum!

Very good. Since itâ€™s only me I only used 3oz of chicken breast and reduced the other ingredients to make one serving. To cook the chicken I cut it into strips, seasoned with garlic salt and smoked paprika. I then sautÃ©ed it using a little coconut oil which cut down on the prep time. Since Iâ€™m on a low carb diet I will definitely make this again!

Delicious.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe was add some extra lime juice and chicken drippings, to counter how dry it was.
