I'm sorry, this did not turn out for me. I think the problem was that there was too much flour and not enough liquid. I didn't pay attention nor read the other two reviews. If I had, I would have known beforehand. Maybe it's a error in the recipe when it was published? Sorry, tangyh. This was a huge disappointment.

This banana bread has too much flour. It doesn't taste like bananas but rather much more like Irish soda bread. It is rather dry but is slightly improved with the addition of butter or honey. It does, however, have a nice thick consistency.

I added some candied orange peel to this and deleted  the chocolate chips.  I reduced the sugar, too, and added a few handful's of pecans.  I wanted a flavored bread for adults to nibble on.  I served it with a sweet cream cheese spread for those who wanted "sweet".  It was great and 2 loaves were eaten.

I thought this was good.  I read the others' reviews and adjusted slightly, and it turned out moist and delicious.  I just added another banana, and I threw in a handful of pecans and milk chocolate chips.  And as with every baking recipe that doesn't already have it, I added 1 t of vanilla and 1 t cinnamon.  Next time I'll probably add another teaspoon of cinnamon.  I had to cook it a little longer, probably because of the extra banana.  I think it was about 70 minutes total.

Overall a good loaf of banana bread, and I'd make it again.

I follow the recipe since this was my first time making this delicious bread.  I will make this again instead of discarding my overly ripe bananas.

I used 4 bananas and added vanilla as another reviewer did.  When using vinegar in baking recipes I think it should be noted that when advised to set aside it is at the very minimum for 5 minutes I usually make sure I give the vinegar 10 minutes to infuse with the ingredients.  I wish we would remember to say what type of pan we are using too and not just the size.  I find my banana breads work best in some sort of metal pan and not the glass or non-stick pans.  I wish I could give 5 stars as written but would give 4 1/2 stars with the suggestion of another banana and vanilla.  I actually went searching for this recipe today because I forgot to save it in my recipe box.
