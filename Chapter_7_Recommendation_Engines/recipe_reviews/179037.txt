The description says it's a casserole - it is not. It's more like chicken noodle soup and, with that in mind, it's a decent, quick-to-make soup. I, too, needed to add more broth and cooked the noodles 8-10 minutes (according to package directions). I added garlic salt, as well. for a little more flavor.

My kids loved this!  I had to cook it a bit more to get the noodles done, and I did use bullion instead of canned broth.  The next time I made it, I added more liquid and it made a great quick soup!

I used leftover turkey instead of chicken and home made stock; added broccoli, carrot and corn and rotinni instead of egg noodles.  I felt this was soupy and wanted more like a stroganoff so I added a bit of cornstarch/water and mixed it in... I did thicken up to more of a stew like meal; good with soft roll! :)

This recipe by itself is a little bland.  Actually most campbells soup recipes are, there is always something to add to them.  As a general rule when i cook any recipe is that I was season with garlic salt, powder and or minced, lawry's or another seasoning salt, pepper, With this one in particular, I season with basil, parsely, oregeno  etc  which adds more flavor.  Just seasoning the chicken and veggies while its cooking can really add to the flavor that it needs!

Made this recipe but added more seasonings to it. Added cajun seasoning, 4 cloves garlic, an onion and1 tablespoon of corn starch to thicken sauce. Without adding these extras this recipe is very bland. Very good low calorie recipe with changes.

I had to use more broth than as it shows on the recipe for the egg noodles to get done. I also cooked the chicken and added it in the beginning. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and cooking it from the beginning lets it absorb the broth more, making it very juicy and delicious.

A great starting point for a simple meal.  I didn't want to waste the little bit of frozen veggies and pasta I would have had left over so I used an extra can of chk broth, cooked off some frozen chk in the George Foreman seasoned with seasoned salt pepper and garlic powder, and added garlic powder and salt to taste.  An easy and satisfying weeknight meal

OK, so this wasn't the ooey-gooeiest dish I ever made, but it was fast and very adaptable to what I had on hand.  Besides, you can't beat that calorie total per serving!  Agree with Qsanti, it's not a casserole, but it wasn't a soup, either, since the broth cooked away.  I used about 1/3 cup julienne carrots, and 1/3 cup chopped onion, with 1/2 teaspoon Amy's reduced salt herb blend.  I added whole wheat tortellini, then put fresh broccoli florets on top, to steam while the noodles cooked.  Had to add about 1/2 cup additional broth, with some leftover roasted chicken.  Even with the additional vegetables, I know we didn't go over 300 calories per serving--not counting the generous portion of Parmesan that DH sprinkled on his!

I made this for dinner and I should have known better than using chicken broth would make it too soupy, rather than a nice thick casserole.  The only difference I would really make is I will use cream of chicken next time, then I think it would be really good!!  I made as written, but added 1/2 cup frozen corn, fresh basil, and chopped onion, oregano, and parsley.  The chicken I used was leftover mango amaretto chicken I made.  The seasonings were good, just too liquidy so I was basically eating dry noodles and veggies.  Will try as said in the beginning next time.

I found that the noodles really don't cook well like this.  If I were to make this recipe again, I'd cook the noodles separately and then added them with the chicken to the vegetables and broth.

Looked for a healthy recipe, and ran across this one.  Used a very low sodium broth, and halved the liquid with water.  Loaded it up with many different veggies and a healthy pasta.  Made a ton, enough to get me through the week.  Variations make for a very healthy and tasty dish.  Season as you see fit, with whatever you prefer, just lay low on the salt.

My husband made an extra effort to tell me it was good. I thought it was a bit bland. The kids really liked it, too.
