Very good.  Hubby rated this 5 stars with the first bite.  I did not have toffee bars, so I added chocolate chips and pecan pieces instead....turned out great.  Thanks for this new dessert recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I did not have a punch bowl, so I had to make some minor changes.  I just made one box of pudding and layered it on top of the pan of brownies, added the cool whip and then the  candy topping. I like making it this way because it is easier to store and transport for those potluck dinners. I have also found it to be yummier if it is refrigerated over night.  I have also tried crumbling oreos on top of the whipped cream instead of using toffee or it is also good without the candy layer at all!  Defintely a winner!

Excellent!  The only additional thing I added was caramel ice cream topping in each layer.  Yummy!!

Folks, if you don't have a trifle bowl, get one!! It helps the presentation...anywho, this turned out great!  All my guests loved it- but next time I'd use a lot more brownies in it and less pudding & cream.  And use Heath bits that are already crushed for you- saves on prep time!!

I made some modifications to this recipe to make it low fat. I used Fat free pudding & Cool whip. I also found a low fat brownie mix & then used a low carb candy bar. It was delicious!

This is so easy it is always a little embarassing to hear all of the raves when I serve it to friends. To add even another chocolate punch, try drizzling hot fudge sauce from a jar between the whipped topping and brownie layers.

This is the best tasting slop I've ever had in my life!  We've had this 3 times now and I enjoy it a tiny bit more when the brownies are a little overdone, as I find they get pretty soft when they are in the pudding.

This is exclusively for chocolate lovers! It's so good! I poke holes in my brownies and pour 1/2 cup Kahlua into my brownies. Cover and soak overnight.

I made this for a New Year's party and everyone loved it!  I had to make the pudding twice, because I had forgotten my mother's sage advice of using at least 2% milk or whole when making pudding... otherwise it's too runny and disappointing.  Also, I didn't have a trifle bowl, so I used individual plastic "crystal" cups.  Worked great.

I made the pudding with 3 cups of milk total, and whisked in about a 1/2 cup of Kahlua. I only had two candy bars, so I chopped up walnuts to mix in to each candy layer. I also put down chocolate syrup with the other layers. My punch bowl was a bit wide, so next time I may just use the 9x13 brownie pan and have one layer of each ingredient. Thanks for the recipe!

I brought this to a Christmas party and it was a big hit.  My husband, who is not a dessert person, even helped me eat the leftovers!  I used brownies with chocolate chips in them (which people LOVED) and then used a fork to poke holes in the finshed brownies and sprinkled them with Kahlua.  Also, I used instant dark chocolate mousse instead of chocolate pudding, and only used a 12-ounce tub of whipped topping.  I refrigerated it overnight.  Thanks!

From the presentation in the trifle bowl,to the unbelievable decadence of the blend of brownie, pudding, whipped topping and candy, this was a HUGE hit this Thanksgiving!! The OOOOh's and AAAAAh's from everyone did not go unwarranted. No changes were needed but I did use chilled peanut butter cups along with the toffee bars. My teenaged-niece even asked for the recipe for her birthday "cake".  Do not hesitate to make this! Not only was this a wonderful dessert, it was very easy to make.

OH. MY. GOODNESS. Best recipe I've had on this site ever and my new favorite dessert! Absolutely to die for. Every time I've made this all I hear are moans and groans followed by: "I have GOT to have this recipe." I also add mini chocolate chips to each layer right after the crushed toffee bars. And I use slightly more cool whip than the recipe calls for. Oh and I strongly recommend using the Betty Crocker Original Supreme brownie mix. You MUST try this recipe!

This is the perfect chocolate dessert.  I made it exactly as is and there is nothing that I would change about it.  It was super easy, fast and most of all delicious.  I think next time I may try switching the toffee with crushed peanut butter cups!  This will definitely be on my menu for Christmas.

I used a Duncan Hines "Dark Chocolate Fudge" brownie mix, Jello "Chocolate Fudge" pudding mixes, light Cool Whip & Heath Bits.  Instead of sprinkling the top with  toffee bits, I grated a Dove dark chocolate bar as garnish.  It was a big hit at our Christmas gathering.  The directions suggest making it the day before.  I assembled it about 7 hours before tasting it & the brownie chunks were already very soft.  I prefer more texture with the brownies so I'll wait until just before serving to layer the ingredients next time.

Fabulous Recipe!  The store I went to didn't have Heath or Skor Bars which seemed odd so I bought a bag of Hershey's nuggets with Toffee and almond and chopped them up.  Still tasted great but next time I will find a store that carries the heath/skor bars because they have way more toffee in them than the nuggets I used.  Also I agree with a previous reviewer that a trifle bowl is a must for the presentation.  I used a very pretty punch bowl but it was too big so I ended up having to double everything so it filled the bowl.  More for me...  Now I will have a great excuse to go buy myself a nice trifle bowl.

I made this for my 4th grade students and they all loved it. Easy to make and looks pretty too. I bought crushed Heath toffee bits in the baking aisle section rather than individual candy bars. Only complaint is it was a little "soupier" than I would have liked. I made it 1 1/2 days ahead so perhaps thats why.

I will definitely make this again.  I used sugarfree devils food cake and it tasted fine.  I used crushed oreos for the toffee layer and fat free whipped topping.  Although not calorie free it tasted great and the double batch I made was gone quickly.  Next time I'm going to throw some Kahlua or Baileys in to try and get some alcohol in there.  :)

YUMMY! A co-worker made this for work last week and I just made it! Delicious! Just like a previous reviewer, I bought the Health toffee chips.

Childhood favorite! You can definitely substitute the brownie mix in this recipe if you want a more cake like dessert. Also, if you really want to wow people, buy some whipping cream and make your own whipped topping. Simply pour the cream into a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer for a while (it does take quite a while) until the air incorporates into it and becomes fluffy. You can even brag about it when serving it to your guests! :) Homemade whipped cream is so much more divine than coolwhip or any other store bought version. :)

WOW this was great! and even better the 2nd day. Made this for a potluck, there were no leftovers and had to make it again for the kids lol. I loved the crunchy toffee bits from the candy bar. btw if you are in Canada they are called skor not heath bars.

The flavor was good but the brownies got really soggy and the whole thing was kind of a sloppy mess.  I made it the night before I served it.  If I made it again, I would only do it if I could assemble it an hour or so before serving.  Overall not worth the effort.

I brought this to a church picnic, we were holding at the beach.  Wow, it was gone before I could get some!  I had a request for the recipe.  The requestor said that it was better than the other Death by Chocolate recipes she had tasted in the past because the whip topping seemed to break up the chocolate. It was more a slow death by chocolate. The presentation in a small punch bowl looks pretty too.

This recipe is incredibly easy. To change it up for Christmas, I didnt put the toffee in there I used candy canes instead. I broke up 4 large candy canes in a ziploc back and crushed them using a meat tenderizer. I used 4 candy canes per layer, and then for the top I used one candy cane and left bigger chunks.
Everyone was wanting more

I made this for my romantic dinner at home for Valentines day. It was a hit! We're not big toffee lovers, so I used fresh raspberries instead of the crushed candy. This was delicious! Thanks for the great but simple and easy recipe!

This is DELICIOUS! I also drizzled caramel topping on each layer and used Hershey's Heath pieces. 
One bite equals 5 lbs., but it's worth it!! Well, almost...

Love this recipe! I also do a caramel version using either a golden or butter pecan cake mix and butterscotch pudding instead of the brownies and choc pudding.

When I was 13 (now 22) I learned how to make this and still wow my family every year. I didn't make it one year and thought there was going to be a riot.   I use chocolate cake mix instead of brownie beucase I think its lighter. Also, it's instant. And I don't feel guilty as I make half a dozen different home made treats. And why mess with perfection?

My daughters LOVE this dessert.  As an added treat, I pour about 1/3 cup of Kahlua over the brownies once taken from the oven and let it soak in while cooling before I assemble it.  Great flavor!

One of my family's favorite desserts!   I have given this recipe to many, many people.  The only change I made was to use a bag of Heath toffee bits instead of the candy bars.  It is much easier!

This is very close to one I make the only changes are I poke holes in the top of brownies just out of the oven and pour 1/4 cup kahula over it. Also I mix the pudding and 8 oz. of the whip topping together to make it more mouse like. Same order in the bowl but the top is plain whip topping with toffee bar bits on top of it. yum yum!

Delicious! Very easy to make and very yummy! Sometimes I used 6-7 cups of Hunts pudding snack pack, Chocolate Fudge, instead of the powder mix. This is great when you make it a day in advance, the flavours really get a chance to blend well. The brownie mix makes this recipe SO easy and fast, I make it so often now and everyone just loves it!

I CHEATED! I used 2 packages (8 little cups) of pre-made chocolate pudding cups (4 cups per layer). Plus, I used 4 toffee bars instead of 3 (2 for each layer).  I used the back edge of a big knife to beat/crumble the bars while still packaged. Lastly, I bought the brownie mix that included a package of fudge sauce and drizzled on top... made it even deadlier!

I made for my husbands Christmas family gathering and everyone loved it. Not only does it taste delicious but it looks delicious.  
I used Cadbury chocolate carmel bars instead of toffee.  I recommend freezing the bars before chopping them up for the topping.

I made this dessert for my hubby's birthday last weekend and got RAVE reviews from my family!!!  The only changes I made were that I made everything from scratch...I try to stay away from boxed convenience foods because of all the artificial stuff in them.  I used my own brownie recipe, "thick chocolate pudding" (from this site), real whipped cream and the chocolate bar of course.  It was a bit more work but definitely worth it.  I will be making this again and again!

Wow!  This was really great!  It was so easy and I was able to make it in a short amount of time.  I didn't make any modifications to the recipe other than omitting the toffee and just using some grated milk chocolate on the top.  I also used 1% milk for the pudding.  Everyone raved and this is one to definitely make again.

Yum very good!  It does taste better the next day after the pudding has soaked into the brownie.  It is very easy to make and really doesn't take much more time than just making brownies, and definately more impressive!

I first tried this dish at my sister-in-laws last Christmas(she found DBC III recipe by LaNita and showed me how to find it on the web)  I have made this dish several times since then and been asked for the recipe many times.  It is soooo yummy--a chocolate lovers dream come true and better than...

Used homemade whipped cream and assembled everything a few hours before eating.  It was excellent and I definitely plan to make again.

This is one of my favorite desserts!  It works great for a work potluck.  The ingredients are easy to find and easy to prepare.

This went over well at the work pitch-in.  I used half evaporated milk when I made the pudding to make it creamier.  And I used crushed Oreos, only on top, instead of toffee.  I've made things like this with cake before--the brownies were a nice, chewy change.

I brought this to work and it took a mere hour before I could see the very bottom of my large dish. It was excellent! My second helping (which was as suggested better after being refrigerated overnight) I topped with chocolate syrup, which was a fabulous addition.  The only thing I could think of that I would want to change is the consistency of the dish.  It tasted good, but I did not like the way it slopped on the plate.  I think next time I'm going to try to freeze it like an ice cream treat to see if it's even better that way.

Very simple concept, but very good! My husband wanted me to make this for his mom's birthday, and it was very well received! Everyone had extras. I made it right before dinner because of previous people's comments about it becoming soggy. However, we ate the leftovers the next day, and didn't find it too soggy at all. I think I even liked it better the second day with the pudding and whipped topping soaked into the brownie. Will definitely make again!

I have had this recipe prepared two ways -- with brownie, and with (leftover) chocolate cake, and it's great both ways! This is totally kid-friendly!

This seemed a little thin on the brownies. I think it needs more/thicker brownie layer. More like two boxes of brownies. Or make sure that your trifle bowl is on the smaller side instead of large, like mine. I tried the new cook and serve pudding that is fat free and sugar free, thinking it would have a richer pudding flavor, but I didn't notice it as anything better.  I added some dark chocolate syrup to the brownie layer and used real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. I topped the top layer with a dusting of cocoa powder and toasted sliced almonds. This looks pretty layered in the trifle bowl, but when you go to serve it, it is not so great looking. It looks like a big sloppy brown and white blob.

This recipe was amazing!!!!! The only changes I made was to use low fat brownies and sugar-free pudding and frozen topping. Just made it a little more figure friendly, but didn't change how it tastes at all!! My family absolutely loved it!!

this turned out just how I had planned. I definitely had problems chopping up the toffee bars...anyone have any suggestions? also, next time, I'll use more toffees and less cool whip. make sure to let it sit in the fridge for a day or so-the flavors blend together better and it ends up tasting amazing!!

This was FABULOUS!  I did make a few changes, I used a 9X13 pan of brownies (cut off the hard edges) and only 1 package of chocolate pudding mix but I uped the skor bars to 6- 2 for each layer.  Looked beautiful tasted great and it was very well received!

My sister made this for Easter and being a chocoholic, I had to have this recipe! The only thing she did different was use Mini M&M's instead of english toffee because my daughter is severly allergic to nuts. She layered it in a trifle bowl and the presentation with the multi colored Mini M&M's looked amazing!! I am making this for a pot luck lunch at work this week and I can't wait to enjoy this again!!! Thank you!!!

It was pretty good.  The people over for dinner absolutly loved it.  I was a little dicipointed.  I think I would have doubled the amount of brownie.  Not enough brownie.  Too much other stuff.

Everytime we go to a potluck, I'm requested to bring this dish and I usually send it to my kids school for teacher luncheons.  For quicker preparation, I use 8 - 10  little tubs of already prepared pudding (kids snack packs) or 2 cans of Thank You pudding.  Also, I usually make it with crushed Hershey Chocolate bars, instead of the toffee candy bars because I was unable to find them the first time I made it and I had the Hershey bars and everyone loves it this way.  I then save a little bit of the Hershey bar to shave on top of the final layer of whipped topping.  My kids have actually tried to lick the bowl clean.  I use a trifle bowl to prepare and the smaller bowl of whipped topping.  You can't go wrong - so easy and everyone will love you for making this dessert.

This is wonderful..and oh so easy to make!  I am very surprised more people have not tried it! I used the heath bar pieces from the baking isle just to make it even easier.  This will for sure be what I bring to a get-together whenever a dessert is requested.

The flavor on this was good, but I put it together in advance and the toffee bars melted.  : (  Next time I would do it immediately before the gathering so the toffee will still be crunchy!

I prefer it with chocolate cake then brownies.  The cake is easier to eat and soaks up some of the pudding to keep it very moist.  Been making this since I was five! I have even tried it with a mix of chocolate and vanilla cake.  Also I have tried putting fresh cut strawberries on top to give a nice look.  It is also good with snickers, ground in the blender, or mars bars.

This is one of the best dessert recipes out there for taste, ease, and forgiveness in substitutions. We love this and the fact you can make it low sugar just by using SF chocolate cake mix instead of brownie, SF pudding, and Lite whipped topping. With 2 diabetics in the house, it's nice to feel sinful and not actually be sinful. I do like to use 1 chocolate pudding and 1 butterscotch, vanilla, or cheesecake flavor to change up the flavor. Thank you so much for this recipe. It's been in my recipe box (and used) for ages and I just remembered to rate it. LOL

This is a great dessert!  Made it for a bbq and it was gone in minutes!  I can't wait to make it again and try the suggestions using walnuts, crumbled cookies, snickers, kit kats.... whatever.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome!  I am not a big chocolate fan and I can't stop eating the leftovers.  This has been my biggest dessert hit yet.  It was so easy to make, too. I used the Pillsbury Milk Chocolate Brownie mix which was highly recommended because of it's very soft chocolaty texture. For chocolate toffee bars I used Heath bars.  YUMMY!  Will make this dessert every-time for a function now!

This recipe is awesome!  Try experimenting with different flavors of pudding -- white chocolate, french vanilla, etc. and also add some other toppings like caramel ice cream topping, etc.  This tends to make it sweeter, but it's kind of fun to try other add-ins.

what's not to love? tasty layers, and the order is great. nothing needs to be changed; quick, simple, cheap, and pretty, but if you plan on making them ahead of time, i suggest waiting until before serving to add the top whipped cream/toffee cuz it tends to absorb any flavors of foods in the fridge, i prefer using redi-whip for the top in this case because it's faster to spray a layer on than to spread and smoothen whipped topping....i made these in individual clear plastic cups for a bake sale at school and they sold out as soon as i put the tray down [and were verrry profitable!]

This was very pretty, made up in individual fancy dessert glasses, but pretty much tasted like instant pudding with whipped cream.  My guests enjoyed it, but my hubby and I weren't too excited about it.  It was simple to make, so worth keeping in mind when something quick is needed.

I am not a fan of whip cream so I don't use much and I also drizzle chocolate syrup over whip cream. This is a really sweet dessert but always a hit. It's also good with chopped oreos instead of brownies and other kinds of candy like m&ms. Love it!!

It was good, but we needed to add more chocolate pudding, but then we ran into the problem of the dessert becoming too watery after a short time. Overall very good because how can chocolate not be good.

I made this for a family gathering. Everyone thought it was good, but it's not something I'd make again. I prefer my brownie topped with ice cream, not pudding. I still have a ton left over as this makes enough to feed an army.

I was so so excited to try this recipe for my family's annual Christmas party.  It was easy to make and looked delicious.  Guests loved it. Yet it was so rich that I could only have a few bites myself.

I made this for Fathers Day and for the Fourth of July. I think it tastes best if you make it just a few hours before eatting. Any sooner than that and the brownies get a little too soggy. I also add hershy's syrup. YUM!

I made this for my family during our last gathering, and everyone loved it! It was gone in no time. I couldn't find the chocolate-covered toffee, so I used Symphony bars instead, and they worked out fine.

I've made this a little differently. Add 1 small cool whip to the chocolate pudding mix. Also used a small bag of Heath Bar "Bits of Brickle" instead of the english toffee bars.  You can also substitute the pudding mix with 3 boxes of chocolate mousse for a little thicker consistency & flavor. If using the mousse, do not add the small cool whip to it.  This has been a favorite at all events but is a dessert that requires lots of mouths.

This was great!  Used Skor toffee bits in mine instead of the candy bar.  My eyes were bigger than my stomache upon eating a bowl of this.  Way too sweet to eat in large quanities, but tasty nonetheless.  Used homemade brownies and homemade whipped cream in mine also.  I will be making this again. :)  great for those chocolate cravings!

I just attended a family reunion, where I had to bring a dessert. I made this the night before and followed the original recipe. I used SKOR bits, instead of buying actual candy bars. The bowl was scraped clean! Thank you LaNita for giving me my first get-togther-dish success story.

Super yummy.  I scaled back the pudding  and brownies because there were only 4 people eating this- so one box of pudding  with 1 1/2 C milk to make it a bit thicker and a small pan of brownies.. I used heath bar chips vs the candy bars and added torani chocolate syrup on top. Everyone loved it and it was enough for Thanksgiving dinner dessert and finished the  next day.

Big hit for Christmas desert! I made two brownie mix batches, but didn't use all of the second batch.  Also substituted crushed Oreos and chocolate chips for the toffee candy and used about 12 oz. of Cool Whip.  It looked very pretty in my big glass salad bowl.

"The more, the merrier" applies to this type of recipe. I cut up some Dove Milk Chocolate squares, some mini Reese's cups and threw them in the mix, then added a drizzle of Caramel sauce.

I used Ghirardelli brownie mix with choc pieces, used both broken heath bar pieces and crumbles, and added a layer of caramel sauce and sea salt.   It was a HUGE hit with the family.  Would definitely make it again.

I was looking for something that was low in sugar and still tasted great.  This definitely fit the bill.  It was such a big hit everyone was wanting to take some home with them.  My husband was disappointed when it was all gone!

Just made it for a company potluck and I had so many people come up to me and ask me for the recipe or tell me how good it was. Planning on making this for every potluck event!

This is absolutely delicious!!! I make it gluten free using the gluten-free fudge brownie recipe, and everyone raves over it every time I make it... even my family members who say they don't like the taste of gluten free food! Instead of chopping up the Heath bars, though, I use Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Bits. I have experimented with different variations, too, and my family's favorite is when I add two cups of peanut butter to the already made instant vanilla pudding (one cup per box) and use Reese's Mini Pieces and peanut butter chips in place of the Heath. I just put one in the fridge for a party tomorrow, and my kids more excited for the dessert than the party!

Great combination. Next time I would half the whipped topping. Splitting the 16 oz container made for a very thick whipped topping layer.

I used instant chocolate mousse instead of pudding... really kicks it up a notch! Make sure you use whole or 2% milk for the pudding, otherwise it gets watery and kinda soggy. Good stuff and almost laughably simple, yet gets rave reviews!

I have made this (smaller version for our family) but much prefer to use a dark chocolate cake...we found brownies just too heavy.Again this is a matter of taste.  Also have made the instant pudding with 1/2 coffee liquer.....yum.  These are just other ways of presenting this great dessert.   No matter how it is made it is always eaten first.

Made this for a 4th of July cookout and it was a HIT!!! Just a few changes.. instead of pudding I used chocolate  mousse. I also poked holes in my brownies with a toothpick, drizzled them with 2/3 cup of khalua, and let the khalua soak in overnight. The flavor was awesome!!! Oh, and I used a mixture of 2 crushed Heath candy bars & 2 crushed Butterfinger candy bars. I would absolutely make this dessert again :)

Combined a few others from site - use 3 c. milk. Bits 'o' Brickle for toffee. Only 12 oz. Cool Whip instead of 16, and 6-10 crushed oreos for topping (or switch with one layer of toffee bits. Family loves this. I made it 3 times in one week for 3 different events!

Make it ALL the time - the only subs I use are:

I never think there is enough chocolate pudding/mousse - and I use Dr. Oetker's chocolate mousse (2 envelopes) OR add 2 envelopes prepared Dream Whip to the chocolate pudding. I love the light fluffy texture.

I also am sure to have two full layers of all the ingredients - and who cares about if it turns into a gloppy mess??? Not a scrap remains after a church carry-in or a funeral - .

I also use twice the full 16 oz container of CoolWhip.

I made this for a dinner party and 2 of the 10 women said it was the best dessert they'd ever eaten.  I wouldn't go that far, but it was pretty scrumptious - it was even better the next day.  It could stand a little more brownie and next time I will add a little more toffee bar, but even as is, it's still quite good.

This was so easy to make, and delicious! However, the chocolate bars were too crunchy for my toddlers, next time I'll leave that part out. I also made 2 batches of brownies, so that you would have more, and I used French Vanilla cool whip...Yum!!

My 14 year old daughter made this for her girls group. We thught it was only ok.  I agree that the brownie layer was a little too thin and ours got a little too soft (almost mushy).  I just wasn't as luscious as we had hoped.

Very delicious!  Easy to make though I would add more brownies.  I used the Heath toffee bars and chocolate curls for the top. Very attractive in a trifle bowl!  Everyone enjoyed it. Definitely a keeper and I look forward to experimenting using fruit & different fillers.

I have made this recipe many many times, you can tweak it to however you want. I have made white cake on a jelly roll pan, used cream cheese and cheesecake pudding and put a small amount of cream cheese in cool whip and layered it. I have also used the brownie one and made a double batch of brownies on a jelly roll pan, you can either use chocolate pudding or vanilla pudding and layer it with whipped cream. I top it with shaved chocolate curls. I always get rave reviews with it and there is never any to take home. Always better to make too much cake or brownie then not enough. The family eats the leftovers!!!

I made this for a July 4th function. I give the recipe 5 stars for ease, appearance, and overall cost to make it. At the bbq I brought it too the host seemed impressed and said it was a nice bowl of pudding. The bowl was completely empty when I left. I just purchased a dollar store clear plastic bowl and spoon for ease. However, flavor wise I just really didn't care for it personally. For years I have made homemade brownies and homemade whipped topping. I would even consider this again, by doing that. It had a very processed food taste, was overly sweet, and left an aftertaste after trying some. I tried it again after refrigerating, as suggested, and the brownies become completely mushy. Making it even more odd tasting to me. Others will be impressed by the little effort put into this dessert, and enjoy it, so I see why it is continuously popular for pot-lucks.

This was such an easy and quick recipe, but didn't taste quick and easy. This was decadant and rich. I didn't have a triffle bowl on hand, so I made individual servings, in 9oz. clear cups. One thing I found, was that I needed more cool whip, so I would suggest 2 (16oz) containers of whipped topping. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and got RAVE Reviews. Yes, Best made the day before serving, to let all the flavors and textures meld.

Wow! I don't like shortcuts, so I made my usual brownies and used them, then drizzled some caramel syrup on the brownies. Instead of the coolwhip I used real whipped cream, and I also made my own chocolate pudding. It was super easy and so delicious! I don't have a trifle bowl, or it would have been prettier too. This lasted about 12 hours in my house. I served it as dessert after dinner, I don't think I've ever seen my kids eat something so fast. My husband, who is not a fan of sweet things and definitely not a dessert person, inhaled two big bowls full. And I finished the last spoonful the next morning. I can not wait to make this again. (But I'll skip the chocolate caramel I put on top, looked a bit silly.)

I've had this recipe saved for a year and a half and was hesitant to try it b/c, really, how good can brownies topped with pudding a cool whip be?  Finally tried it and I am so glad we did.  So easy and delicious and a great presentation.  I used Ghiradelli triple fudge (?) brownies (they are the best) and 2% milk for the pudding.  I used light cool whip and bought the Heath bar already chopped in a bag.  Perfection.  I drizzled the top with hot fudge and Heath.  Next time I will use extra Heath as Hubs thought it really needed more and I might drizzle hot fudge between the layers.  This did not last long in our house!  I can see using a 9X13 dish- not as pretty but a bit quicker and easier to assure that you get all the layers in each serving.

I took this to a family gathering and everybody loved it. I used miniature chocolate chips instead of the toffee. Very easy and good.

This was a tad bit too rich for me, but everyone else loved it. I shared with my friends husband and he said that he gives it 8 1/2 stars** because it wasn't chocolate enough, but was still really good!

I made this layered cake the same day I found this recipe.  My boyfriend brought a tub of it to work and he said that the tub was cleaned out in a matter of minutes.  It's a delicious cake that would satisfy any chocoholic's (or sweet-tooth's) cravings.  It's also a great recipe for kids to participate as well.
