We made a double batch of these, and found the wheat germ made it too dry to roll, so we added 3 beaten eggs (to a double batch) and a splash of broth to help things stick together. Since we have cats, we rolled smaller balls (marble sized) and cooked for 7 minutes.  All 5 of our cats ate them with enthusiasm, and my husband tried one (to be sure they were cooked through), and said they weren't bad.  They make nice gifts for folks that have cats and dogs.

One note: if you use broth, make sure it does NOT have onion or garlic or similar seasonings in it; they are toxic for animals, particularly for cats -- both can develop hemolytic anemia.

This was a great base for varied types of biscuits I make for my dogs. I mix in things like oats, peanut butter, shredded cheese, wheat flour, and/or  meaty bouillon (whichever flavor matches the baby food used). Sometimes I color the dough and shape it into bones/hearts/etc (see photo). This recipe on its own is okay but I love spoilding my dogs and dressing them up a bit :}

My dog loves these! Not only are they simple to make but they are very healthy for the pet. I used honey wheat germ. I also only baked them for 18-20 minutes, 25 was too long.

These are GREAT. I made about 4 different kind of dog treats all in one afternoon, and these were definately the BIG favorite of both me and the dogs. They're VERY easy and nutritious and the dogs really really went nuts over them. The cats (i have 5) didnt' care for them too much, but oh well. I added some garlic to help repel fleas plus it's good for the dogs.

My lovable Golden-border-labra-shepherd, Max, loved these treats. He's not a fan of chicken flavored dog treats, so I used beef baby food and I dissolved 2 beef bullion cubes in 1/4 cup of water for the liquid. I did need to add more liquid to make the dough workable. If the dough sticks to your hands when rolling, wet your hands slightly. Also, baking on parchment paper makes this a snap! Two paws up!

Not too bad.  The texture was nice for my cat's small teeth, but the flavor was lacking.  The wheat germ was a bit pricey, too.  Total cost of ingredients was $2.22 (compare to $1.50 for other recipes).  I put an egg/beef bullion glaze on these and my cat will eat them, but he prefers other kind.  I might try this again with a little tweaking.

I have thrown out so many store bought treats, I've made other home made pet cookies but these seemed so easy, I thought I'd given them a try. Well, Spankee thanks you very much! She comes running for these. I've made then twice already. Next time I'll make them smaller and give some to my daughter for her cat.

All 3 dogs loved them.  My own dogs (usually calm and gentle) almost got my fingers when I gave them these cookies.

My Lab/Malamute mix LOVED these little treats.  He is generally not too picky when it comes to treats, but I could tell the difference when he tasted these.  He was VERY excited and couldn't get enough.  We added 1 tsp. of Better than Bouillon (beef) and used beef baby food.  Thanks!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  My dog is allergic to almost everything, and I had never thought of using baby food to make dog treats.  I used lamb baby food and barley flour since my Flash Dog is allergic to wheat.  He loved the treats!  As for the other reviewers who commented on cost, for the owner of an allergy pet, this was really inexpensive!  I have to drive an hour to the nearest pet store to get a sweet potato biscuit that he can eat, and then pay almost $6 for the small box of treats.  Flash and I thank you very much!

I have 4 dogs and 4 cats. They were all begging for these before they were cooked. Just like me they love a good cookie dough! Once they were baked 7 out of 8 pets agreed these were really delish.

I added a can of moist cat food in addition to the baby food, and flour enough to be able to roll out dough. Used small cookie cutter and baked for 20-25 minutes at 350. They love them!!

My dog (and the neighbor dogs) chowed down on these cookies.  I made a second batch using some sweet potato puree that I had on hand. Great base recipe that would still be good with different baby foods.  I'll use this again and again.

My dogs love these.   I split my batch into two flavours; chicken and beef.  Both batches baked to a golden brown and had a slight peanut butter smell.  Since these have no preservatives, I keep them in plastic baggies in the fridge, only removing 4 each day (so they come to room temperature).  I look forward to swapping out the baby-food flavours to vary the taste for the dogs.   Thanks for such a versatile recipe!

I made little treats using the smaller end of a melon-ball tool and baked them about 13 minutes. These are my dog's favorite treats.

Took way longer to cook than it said, and I had trouble getting them off the pan. My dog loved them though.

All the baby food jars I've found are 4 oz. so I did use this recipe and formulated my own, using 1 cup of wheat germ, 1 egg, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup of 10-grain pancake mix and the 3 4-oz jars of sweet potato baby food.  Just a note:  as there are no preservatives these can develop mold easily,  I had to toss some of my last batch.

An easy-to-modify basic treat recipe.  I  made them for my picky pup and used/added some of his favorite goodies: chicken baby food, shredded mozzarella, and crushed up "Liver Biscotti" from a local pet food store.  He loved them!  I also used 1 c. wheat germ and 1 c. whole wheat flour for the dough to alter the texture slightly so I could roll it out and cut it with small cookie cutters instead of shaping with my hands.

Was hard to work with. Too crumbly to roll out for cutting and would fall apart too easily after baking, even after adjusting the recipe a little.
My 2 cats stuck their noses up at them, but my Border Collie, Bella loved them. As did her 2 friends, Rain & Gadget.
Still, won't try them again as I would prefer a recipe that cats & dog both like and want to use  cookie cutters for giving as gifts.

All 3 of my dogs give them a "10".  Easy to make.  I added an extra 1/2 Tbs. of water and baked 25 minutes.  Made 31 cookies.  My dogs weren't sure at first.  They sniffed and ate it slow and after they realized what they tasted like, they wanted more and more.  They about took off my fingers trying to get at them so fast!

Love this recipe! I added a little more water and baked for only 15 minutes. My picky yorkies, my daughters lab and two of my mother's four cats just couldn't get enough. I baked several batches with different baby foods and froze the extras. I just take out a small baggie as needed. Great and easy recipe!

I omitted the water and added a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter and a drizzle of honey. I gave these treats to friends and family that have dogs and everyone reported that the doggies LOVED them. I tried giving them to my cat, she wasn't interested.

I made them with two jars of beef and one jar of turkey (i meat to buy all beef but must've misread the labels)
Extremely easy to make which is nice, but the dog didn't seem to like them any more than other treats, and they're definitely more expensive than other home made and a lot of store bought treats.

I made these for my two "kids", the four-legged ones that meow...I have never found a treat that they actually begged for. Had to put them into a sealed baggie in the fridge to keep them from climbing and trying to get to them on the shelf...What a delightful surprise for my kids, will be trying other baby meat for a variety...thanks.

My dog has food allergies so I make all of her treats.  This are by far the easiest and quickest to make.  I used a vegetable baby food and she loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'd been meaning to make these for about a month now, even had everything in my pantry. So I finally got around to it tonight. These were VERY easy to make. I altered the recipe a bit: I used 1 C. of the wheat germ, 2 jars of baby food, and no water. I put them in the oven and took Molly out, our totally amazing Cav, and by the time we got back, the house smelled amazing! I was amazed! lol  I never expected dog treats to smell like that! The final test came when I gave her one and she took it with pleasure and acted like she had a prize in her mouth! The ONLY change I will make next time is to roll them into small logs and then flatten them. I think it would be easier for her to handle this way. Next time I'll try some sweet potato instead of all baby food. Seems you could put about anything in these!

Very easy and my dogs loved them!  One of my dogs is allergic to almost everything, including wheat germ and chicken! So I used turkey baby food instead of chicken and buckwheat flour instead of wheat germ.

Easy to make, but my cat wouldn't touch them and my dog wasn't too interested either.  I gave a few to my coworker for her cats with the same results.  I ended up throwing most of them out.  Of course, cats are picky and maybe my dog just has bad taste.  Or, maybe they are really not too appetizing.  Hard to say.

These treats are really easy to make and very healthy for your pet.  My dog loved them and I made little ones for my cat and she loved them too.  I will definitely be making these regularly.  Maybe with different flavors of baby food for variety.

My dogs adore these- gave them out as gifts last Christmas and everyone else said their dogs loved them, too.  The cats were interested while they were cooking, but seemed intimidated by the size.  This time, I'm going to try making some that are pea-sized for the cats.  I never had a problem with them spoiling- the dogs go through them too fast!

These pet cookies are extremely easy to make and relatively cheap.  My finicky cat liked them, as did every dog I know.  They made very cute xmas presents.  However they were a little too popular and I got tired of making them at everyone's request.  So I finally printed out the recipe and gave it out so people could make them for their own dogs!

We made these as Christmas gifts. Both large and medium dogs loved them, haven't tried on the cats yet. We followed the suggestions of adding chicken broth and finishing with an egg wash.  If you're giving as gifts, double or triple the batch. Buy the wheat germ from a bulk bin if available.  Merry Christmas!

Not only is this recipe a little expensive but neither of my dogs ate them. My daughters dog reluctantly ate them after they sat on the kitchen floor and she realized she wasn't getting anything else. Will not make again.

Our little Pom loved these cookies! Now she won't touch the store bought stuff. I used this recipe as a basic pet cookie recipe and added in some garlic and parsley.  I was always wondering what they put in the store bought stuff.  Now I know what my pom is eating...

I've made these for friends, co-workers, family and neighbors.  Everyone's dogs go crazy for them (no luck with my cat).  I usually cook up skinless boneless chicken breasts and then process in a blender with a little water rather than use the baby food.  This recipe is healthier than others I've found.  Thank you Sue for sharing.

I used Gerber's chicken with chicken gravy dog food and also they have beef w/beef gravy, ham, turkey, veal.  My dogs LOVE the beef and chicken ones.  I don't strain the baby food though. These are easy and Max and Maggie start begging while they are baking.  I was very hesitant at first thinking these would not be liked, but give them a try, they're easy.

I have three dogs and they knew the whole time these were for them.  The texture before cooking is kind of crumbly but they turn out great once baked.  My dogs approve.

These cookies are wonderful.  I added 1 tsp. minced garlic for added health benefit and one (crushed) low sodium bullion cube, and some green and red food coloring.  They made great gifts for friends dogs and everyone reported that their dogs loved them.  My dogs beg for them!!

My dogs will eat these, but they are typical "eat-it-first-ask-questions-later" doggies. These aren't their favourites, at any rate. I turned them over halfway through the baking time, so they would brown evenly. My cats wouldn't eat them, but they are very fussy, so I didn't expect they would!

My sweet dog absolutely loved these treats...  It was really easy to make.  Dogs don't care how they look, as long as they're good.  The chicken baby food didn't smell too good mixing it up, but they turned out great.  I wasn't really sure if I was supposed to put them in the frig or not, so I put them in a tupperware bowl and let them cool and then at night I placed them in the frig and got them out during the day.  I'm making these for gifts!

these cookies are kind of expensive to make, but my dog and cat both love them.  The dog wouldn't come out of the kitchen while they were baking.  It's like he knew they were for him.

These are great! I use gluten free flour and my 12 year old miniature golden doodle just loves these. They are soft enough to use as "pill pockets" too.

I make these treats all the time and have shared the recipe with family.  It is quick and my dogs have loved it.  I store them in the refrigerator and when my Matar comes in from outside she goes to the refrigerator door and waits for her treat.  Thank you for such an easy recipe that tastes outstanding (the dog excitement rating is off the charts).

This is not for cats. Dogs are scavengers, but cats are strictly carnivorous. Do not feed your cat grains, even vegetables should be minimized. Improperly fed cats will develop diabetes and high risk of organ failure.

I didn't have any baby food but I did have some wet dog food that I used instead.  Seriously, SOOO easy to make and the dogs loved them! I especially love that I can make them just the right size to put in one of those fun treat balls that dogs love so much.  They had a ball (pun intended) getting their treats out!!
Thank you!!
