Not a bad flavor for gluten free but the texture was way too chewy and a bit dry.  I was looking for a good chocolate cake recipe to use for birthdays.  Even with icing I was disappointed.  I ended up using them as a shortcake with fruit and whip cream to really get them down.

The kids just loved it.  I did not have xanthan gum so I used slippery elm; changed the sugar for 1 c of honey; and used almond milk.  They were very moist and were gone very quickly!!!  I cheated for the frosting and used some Nutella-like spread...  Thanks for sharing

DELICIOUS! I made half a recipe, which made 24 mini cupcakes. I used Bob's Red Mill AP Baking Flour for the flour, Splenda instead of sugar, light sour cream and soy milk. I baked them 13 minutes, and they were perfectly done. Despite having no oil or butter, they were very moist and had a very nice texture. I'm sure no one would be able to tell they were gluten free. The only thing I would do differently is to spray the paper cupcake liners with Pam because they did stick a little. I'm sure I'll make these again.

I havent made this, but I was reading the ingred list and wondered, how about buttermilk instead of the milk and sour cream? Buttermilk makes cakes SO nice and moist! But the recipe looks like a good one!

I found this to be a very easy recipe to make compared to some gluten free recipes. It has good flavour and they turned out great.

I made this in a 9 x 11 pan for my daughter's 35th birthday.  She has celiacs disease so we have to be very careful with ingredients.  This cake turned out beautifully.  Raves all around and no one thought it was gluten free flour.

I made this recipe for my wife today. I used brown rice flour and garbanzo bean flour for the millet(that's all I had) and they came out great. My wife absolutely loved them, no frosting was necessary. Told me this is a KEEPER as a recipe. Thank you for the submission.

I made this cake as written.  It had a slimy, chewy texture (too much xanthan gum?-the batter was slimy too).  It had an overpowering flavour of baking powder/soda-it had that acidic fishy aftertaste.  Also, there is too much millet flour for my taste-even the batter tasted overpoweringly of its musty flavour.  I prefer millet in smaller portions as a compliment to other flours, not as a main flour.  I noticed that some people who reviewed this with five stars didn't use the flours as written-maybe this would be better with less millet and subbing a milder flour or even potato or tapioca starch.  It has a nice weight to it.  Not too light and not too heavy.  I spread frosting on it with no problems of it giving too much.  I didn't make cupcakes.  For me it yielded two 9-inch cakes.  Perhaps with adjustments to the amounts of stabiliser/thickening agent, leavening agents, and flours I would like it, but then it would be a different recipe.  Thank you for the recipe, sorry it didn't work out for me.

I had bobs redmill flour that had xantham gum in the mix. So instead of using the separate flour quotas I used the total of the two for just the Bobs Redmill flour. And then didn’t add any xantham gum since the mix has it already. I saw that some people commented on the cupcakes not being moist enough, so I added 1/3 oil to the batter. Have to say that the moisture is amazing, the texture is so great. My kids (who aren’t gluten free) devoured them like they were normal cupcakes. I also did a sour cream cheese caramel frosting to pair with it. Absolutely delicious!!!!!

This is my go to recipes for gluten free chocolate cake for all occasions. Sometimes I do a cake and sometimes I do cupcakes. I use the all recipes adjuster to make as many or as few as I like.. It gets raves and tastes better than cakes made from regular flour. Sometimes I sub mayonaisse for the sour cream and works just fine.

Its definitly delicious, i was surprised how it held together considering it is gluten free. But next time i would only use 3 eggs and maybe add some coconut oil.

I am making this frosting for a baby shower to pair with gluten free cupcakes. A tad sweet, but just cut a bit of the sugar and a little more of the fats. Btw, does this go well with chocolate cupcakes? Just curious.
