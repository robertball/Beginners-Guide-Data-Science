Although this recipe is a good one IT FAILS TO MENTION SOME VERY IMPORTANT FACTORS, which i find my be the reason to some of the reviews saying it taste horrible and such, the first thing the recipe fails to mention is that you have to poke holes into your ballon so that the carbondixocide being produced can excape yet keep air from getting in the second and most important is that the recipe ends on the note "then after 5 weeks or the ballon is not getting bigger anymore its ready to drink" WRONG!! well kinda.. it is ready to drink but with the exception it will be nasty like most reviews said.. see you need to ethier siphon the stuff out or filter it.. you dont want the dead yeast and suger on the bottom of the bottle that has settled or you will probly give it the bad review like others did.. all you want is the yeasts  (aka alcohol) oh yeah alcohol is just yeast pee pee incase you didnt know hehe so enjoy ;)  anyways do that and expect it to be GREAT!!!

I made this using white grape raspberry, white grape peach, and grape.  The grape raspberry and grape peach are really good (and strong!) but the grape is by far the best.  I used 6 cups of sugar and the result is a very sweet wine, which is what we like.  I used yeast made especially for wine and I boiled my water and sugar to make sure all the sugar dissolved.  After 5 weeks I poured through coffee filters and transferred wine to another container for a couple of weeks before bottling.  This is the perfect wine to use to make Sangria.

There is a reason that wineries possess expensive, specialized equipment to produce their product: making good-tasting wine is a delicate process.  Needless to say, this recipes covers the essentials of the process and produces a product that does indeed suggest wine.  I must make one suggestion though, dissolve most of the sugar in boiled water.  At the beginning of my experience with this recipe, most of the sugar fell to the bottom and did not react as well with the yeast as when I'd boiled it.

This was a most exciting adventure.  The wine seemed to be stronger when I used real fruit that I put through a juicer. It had a definite kick.  Using the old glass gallon jugs seems to work better and give a "not so plastic" taste also.  It was awesome.  A wonderful New Year to come :).

This recipe works very well. My wine aged in about 4 and a half weeks. This tastes just like storebought wine except with an added kick. Very recommended recipe. I kept mine stored in an armoire at room temperature and it turned out phenominal.. yes I'm drinking it right now! A+++!!

Have to say, this sounds exactly like the recipe me and my friend made in high school.  I remember it SMELLED just like wine.  However she had told me that the baloon had gone all the way up and I asked her what she did and she said put the lid on the milk jug..... I knew that that was an oops!  She called me that day after she got home from school and was frantic... come help me clean this up!  It had exploded in her bedroom closet.  What a mess.  The whole house reeked of wine!  (That may have been the same day her Mother found a pack of cigarettes!)  Now, 23 years later I am going to try this recipe again!

Great intro recipe for starters into brewing your own wine at home!  Some additional tips because there are some things that you arent told:  1.  Use more cans of concentrate and less sugar for a stronger flavored wine (3 cans and 1/2 cup sugar or 2 cans and 2 1/2 cups of sugar)  2.  Siphon off after 2 weeks of starting to get the wine on the lees (dead yeast) so the wine wont taste as funky...if you leave it on the dead yeast for 5 weeks it will be super musty-flavored  3.  Use Hawaiin punch jug and drill hole in top and hot glue a 1/4" tube from Lowes (about 2ft is 20 cents) and run tube to a jar/bottle of water.  Keep submerged in water so air cant spoil wine and you dont have to worry about rubber balloon taste, etc..  4.  a 5 gram packet of wine yeast makes 5 gallons.  Im trying a batch right now just using 1 gram of yeast per gallon.  See next step of how to prep yeast to ensure survival.  Using 1 gram should cut musty bread flavor of wine, even if using bread yeast.  (packets of bread yeast are usually 7 grams)  5.  Prep yeast by rehydrating and feeding.  Put amount of yeast in lukewarm water and let it rehydrate and foam then feed it a teaspoon or 2 of sugar so it can begin multiplying the yeast count and start on its job.  Then add it to the wine mixture of juice and sugar  Hope this helps the newcomers a bit more!  Thanks for the original recipe!

I didn't really know what to expect when I threw this together 8 weeks ago (I'd forgotten about it actually). All I can say is, wow, this stuff is STRONG! (and I am not a light-weight by any means when it comes to drinking, haha). I made it with a cherry/apple concentrate which, with the sugar, is a little bit too sweet. Oh well, it does the job :)

I made this wine for the first time exactly as stated. It turned out alright, but was a bit too bitter. I found that the reason the taste was so off, was because there was no way for the gases to escape.   I have made a few small changes, that made the wine phenomenal! First, dissolve the sugar in water before it is added to the jug, and I use 2 juice concentrates instead of one, it gives more flavour. before placing your balloon on, use a small needle or sewing pin to poke a few hole in the top of the balloon. This will let the gases out, but it wont let the air in. After your wine has fermented, use a funnel and some kind of strainer (I use nylon stocking, their about a dollar at most stores) and strain the wine into wine bottles, or another gallon jug. After that, the wine is done, and tastes great! For a richer flavor though, let it sit in it's new container for about a week longer, and the wine is PERFECT! Enjoy. :-)

DECENT RECIPE FOR BEGINNERS, BUT DONT GIVE UP SO EASILY! FIND A SHOP LOCALLY THAT SELLS BREWING SUPPLIES. DITCH THE BALLONS, RUBBER BANDS, PLASTIC JUGS AND BREAD YEAST. IT'LL COST @ FOUR BUCKS TO BUY A DRILLED RUBBER STOPPER, A PLASTIC AERATOR AND YEAST MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR WINE. SPEND ANOTHER FOUR BUCKS ON CAMPDEN TABLETS AND POTASSIUM SORBATE AND THEN MAKE YOUR WINE. KEEP IN MIND YOU'LL BASICALLY BE MAKING A LOW DOSE RUBBING ALCOHOL WITH A LITLLE FLAVOR. IF YOU EXPECT A $200 BOTTLE OF WINE BY SPENDING EIGHT BUCKS AND 20 MINUTES, YOU'LL HAVE MORE SUCCESS WATCHING BOB VILA ONCE AND OPENING YOUR OWN CABINET SHOP. DO A LITTLE RESEARCH, SPEND A FEW BUCKS, BE PATIENT, EXPERIMENT IN SMALL BATCHES, DRINK YOUR RESULTS AND MODIFY. WRITE EVERY SINGLE DETAIL IN A NOTEBOOK, KEEP TRACK OF YOUR STEPS AND YOUR WINE WILL IMPROVE WITH EVERY BATCH.  PATIENCE AND SANITATION ARE A MUST. IF YOU PICK UP A PAINTBRUSH FOR THE FIRST TIME AND EXPECT THE MONA LISA, FIND ANOTHER HOBBY. RESEARCH, TIME AND PATIENCE WILL BE REWARDED. GOOD LUCK!

During the last year I have made this recipe over and over, using both 100% frozen or 100% bottled juices. I always have great strong wine in the end, and no two batches exactly the same.  This wine is not for the weak or meek palate, it is strong!  When aged much longer than the recipe states it can be used as a table wine.  The pure grape tends to be the strongest and needs to age far longer than the others. I only use 3-1/2 cups sugar instead of 4 cups. In a saucepan I make a simple syrup by boiling approx. 2 cups water and 3-1/2 cups sugar until dissolved. This retards the growth of bacteria and makes the yeast work extremely well (fermentation).  After the syrup is some what cooled pour it into the sterile glass jug using a sterile funnel. DO NOT ADD the yeast now, wait until the gallon and its contents are back to room temperature or the yeast itself will die and not ferment.  The longer the wine sits/rests the better the taste.  Forget about it!!!  Salute!

I really dont like the balloon way.  I tried it and forgot about it for about 2 weeks and the balloon had rotted off and ruined the wine.  My grandfather has been making wine for many, many years and he has a pretty cool technique.  he takes a plastic tube and pokes it in the lid of the milk jug and puts the other end in a glass of water.  it keeps the air going out but not coming back in. The recipe itself is awsome.  I made some and it turned out wonderful.  My boyfriend says its a wine you can sip on all night and it creeps up on you.  you dont notice it kickin your butt till its too late.  The only thing that sucks about it is the after effect.  My hangovers are always worse when i drink this wine.

I have been experimenting with this recipe. i don't know what i am doing.  i am currently brewing 4 jugs right now. i tried one after it stopped perculating, it was OK. I heard that you refrigerate the wine when it stops producing CO2. is that true. How long do you let it sit after it stops making gas and you filter it? Also, how do you bottle it and how long is it good for.  I have no idea what the heck I am doing, but am willing to keep trying to get it right.  Just started using wine yeast.

I have to say this is SUCH a quick and easy wine recipe! The way I do it is to poor in 2 cups of sugar, add yeast, poor in the other 2 cups of sugar, then add the concentrate, filling the jug half way. I then lightly shake the jug to help dissolve some of the sugar. When the mix is well dissolved, I finish filling the jug. 

I then use the balloon and rubber band, using a needle to poke a small hole in the top of the balloon. After 5 weeks, I filter the wine, and put it in a glass jug. I put a new balloon and rubber band around the top, and put it back in the closet for 1 more week. After 1 week, I filter the wine 1 last time, put it in a new glass jug, and it's ready.

I've tried grape, white, white/raspberry, apple, white peach, apple/kiwi/strawberry, apple/peach, and quite a few others. I have to say though, the apple will put you on your rear end! LOL My favorite so far is the white/raspberry.

This works great! But the baloon will not go down on it's own. So I just filter it after six weeks. If you boil your water make sure it's cooled before adding the yeast or the warm water will "kill" the yeast. I have used wine yeast & active dry yeast. The active dry yeast works the best, it makes the alochol content higher. I like it best with an extra cup of sugar, my hubby likes it best with the amount called for. I also found that a glass jug works better.

We always used a condom instead of latex balloons. Yes, I said CONDOMS! Latex balloons have a powder which can leak into the wine. 
Secondly, I also waited for the balloon to go up then come down at which time I knew it was ready. Please do not poke holes in the balloon, condom or whatever, as you want to keep everything as sterile as possible in order not to introduce unwanted bacteria or end up with vinegar as a result.
Finally, I would suggest a trip to the winemaker or beer maker store for the right kind of yeast would also be in order. Otherwise Happy Wine Making-from a former home wine maker!

This recipe is super.  Follow the directions just like you see them here and you'll come out with a decent blush.  It may not win any awards at a tasting party but it's better than a box wine.  

One small suggestion.  After five weeks the balloon may still be inflated, that's not a big problem.  Do use a piece of tubing to siphon off the wine from the sediment in the bottom.  Try not to disturb the sediment when you do that.  I use two clean 2-liter pop bottles instead of a gallon jug.  It's a way to reuse bottles we'd normally throw away.  And the sediment packs itself down in the ridges in the bottom which makes siphoning a lot easier.

Helpful maybe?, I am not an expert and it has been some time since I did this:
Wash the balloon.
When the balloon deflates the wine has stopped working and added time may screw the flavor and maybe turn to vinegar, earlier may taste yeasty. [actually the higher alcohol content kills the fungus making the alcohol, no longer giving off gas and the balloon goes down]
Most  rubber balloons have very small holes and will deflate over a short time, good ones may take a long time, so pricking small holes resolves this or your wine will sit too a long time with a big balloon and not working, but spoiling.  You just need to know when it stops working, that is the purpose of the balloon idea.  Timing is quite important, and sealing it in another clean bottle or refrigerating it after it is ready keeps it longer.  If you do not clean and sterilize your jug you may get contaminates that may give it a bad flavor or affect the working process.

This recipe is great if you're ok with Carlos Rossi grade wine.

The first question I had when I saw the recipe was, "how sweet is it?" Because I prefer dry over sweet, I cut the sugar down to less than 2 cups. MISTAKE. It tasted alcoholic (great) but unpalatable (not so great). After fermentation, I added sugar to taste, and it's fine now. 

My process was such: Sanitize all equipment with hot water and dish soap, rinsing thoroughly. I used a ballon, active dry yeast, and welches grape concentrate. I let the yest sit in warm water to dissolve, and put the sugar in warm water to make a syrup. I mixed all ingredients togetherm sealed it with a balloon, gave it a few holes to let the gasses escape, and after 5 days, the balloon deflated. I filtered it with a funnel and coffee filters once and now I have a Carlos Rassi tasting sweet wine, which is chilling in my fridge. 

Like i said, this is ok if you like cheap, sweet wines that will get you drunk fast.

I'll make more and experiment with white grape. I want something that will be less sweet but still palatable.

great recipe, this is my 4th batch. one thing i learned is to dissolve the yeast in a cup of warm water before adding to the mix. dissolving the sugar as one commented and doing the same with the yeast gives a more even mixture. i move my batch after 3 weeks to a second jug leaving the sediment on the bottom, then i leave that for another 3 weeks and bam!!!!!!!!!! thanks for the recipe.  i call this last one 6 week hooch.. people cant believe it was made out of frozen concentrate. lol

I love this home made wine . I did not like the balloon way either. I used the plastic tube too. My hole family loved it .we made grap from our vine. Muskiedines have came in so we are trying blackberry/muskiedine .I know its going to be great. I rated this wine 4 because its almost their . only if we could reduce the yeast after tast.

I'm new to wine making.  The first two 1-gallon batches I made were fresh strawberry and mango.  Both of them came out perfectly.  Then I tried this recipe to the exact.  I used this formula to make four 1-gallon batches, two Welch white grapes and two Welch red grapes.  Three came out perfect and one is a bit slow.  I just bottled them today and they looked fantastic.  They taste very good and strong too.  I used RedStar montrachet yeast.  I started a new 5-gallon batch with 10 cans of Welch red grape juice with RedStar champagne yeast this time.  It's been a week now.  Will see if it's going to taste stronger.  The starting SG is a bit higher (1.126).  

The one gallon batches I started out using the milk jug with air-locks though.  I didn't use the balloons.  After 4 weeks, I racked them into 1 gallon carboy.  I used sparkaloid to clear the wines.  They taste just as perfect without using the agent but I just want to make them clear to look nice in the bottles.

Textbook recipe.Experiment to make a wine you like achohol can be adjusted by the amount of sugar used (use powdered sugar it will stay dissolved)-old bootlegger trick.Remember alcohol will kill the yeast when level gets high enough that's why balloon stops expanding.To turn this into a brandy, marsalla,sherry, port or other fortified wines simply add alchohol about 3/4 of the way through the fermentation process. This will kill the yeast before they consume all the sugar leaving a sweet "brandy"

I boiled the water and then added the sugar so it dissolved comepletely. I added the yeast to the liquid when it was still slightly warm, and it was ready to drink in about 9 days. All of the yeast settled to the bottom of the gallon jug, and the wine became clear. I used the Hodgson Mill yeast (8.75g).  This stuff is strong, and it creeps up on you. Before I knew it, I had drank about on third of it because it tastes so good. I was very drunk and extremely hungover the next day.

I used this recipe and ordered a professional grade cork and airlock from midwest supplies ($1.85+SH). After fermentation, the resulting liquid was very strong with a yeasty aftertaste. I mixed the wine with one can of like Welches white grape juice concentrate and it was more than drinkable. Very high alcohol content!

too much sugar 2 cups per gallon is all the sugar you want counting the sugar that is already in the juice to start with  you never add extra sugar to begin with to sweeten or gain alchohol content in wine back sweetning is done after the wine is finished and ready to bottle adding too much sugar to start with kills off the yeast also and stops it from fermenting anyway lightly modified you can make a decent cheap wine from this recipe ty for sharing it

This recipe is so versatile.  I made three batches, 1) White Grape Peach, 2) Passionfruit, 3)Apple....I made some changes to the recipe though.  I placed the ingredients in wholesale bulk-sized pickle jars and covered them with 3 layers of saran wrap secured by a rubberband.  I also used wine-grade yeast instead of all purpose yeast.  Great Recipe for anyone. A+!!!

I made four jugs of this, all different flavors. I think the apple was the best, but the raspberry pomogranate is good too. My purple grape wine developed large patches of mold on the surface - I will not be consuming this one. The mold did not occur on the others and I did not do anything different - no idea why that happened. 
I did use saran wrap on the tops of the milk jugs and poked holes in them - worked well. Will make again.

I used the Welch's white grape juice concentrate. At first I thought it tasted cheap but after two weeks in the bottle the taste is comparable to mid range chardonnay.

I make five gallons at a time. Good stuff. I've heard you should add potassium sorbate at the end of 30 days to stop fermentation so it is more drinkable.

Syrupy sweet and thick and way too strong alcohol (burned on the way down).  We also had to wait twice as long for it to be ready.  Don't waste your time!

I made this recipe just as it is shown,I used apple/peach and it came out a bit dryer than I like but back sweetened very well. I did not use a balloon, I used a proper air lock and plug that I got for $3.00. I live in a warm climate so it only took 10 days to ferment and stop bubbling through the air lock, I also got some Potassium Sorbate to prevent re-fermentation and added that before I bottled it. I put it in water bottles and from one gallon I got two 1 liter and three 1/2 liter bottles filed with another half of a 1/2 liter bottle left over. That is what I have sampled. It is still cloudy but tastes pretty good and it is very strong. I am going to let it stand for a few weeks and see if it clears up, if not I will add a clairifer in the next batch which I will be starting in the next few days.

Overall it works great.I found out why they say serve no wine before it's time.I put some in mason jars and nearly blew the lids off of them.I had waited the 6 weeks but evidently it wasn't enough.I have three gallons going now and two gallons jarred up.I jarred a concord grape which has a great kick to it and a strwberry medley that is really strong.The ones I have going are white grape/peach,another concord and an apple.It's been years since I've done this but I'm having a great time.

The first time I made this the wait time was longer than stated, I actually removed the balloon while still inflated because it had been acuple of months and was still inflated.  However, after that, the wine maturd in a couple of weeks and was excellant!  And packed a pretty good punch.  I don't care for wine that makes you pucker, and this was very sweet and easy to sip.  It didn't last long, as company also thought it was excellant wine.  My only regret is that I didn't make more the first time.  I am now starting my next batch and am making two galons instead of one and am tryng some new flavors (my first one was of sourse concord grape, now I am trying strawberry and white grape/raspberry).  I like the fact that you use prepared juices.

The grapes are done and WOW are they strong my fiance and all of his friends love it and want me to make more. I was so happy that this turned out so well. I'm makeing more with different variations. Thanks!!!!!!!

I'm giving this five stars based on its simplicity and affordability. I've done both fruit and concentrate wines (made this twice now) and when I'm lacking the additives and/or fruit (and don't particularly feel like spending a bundle) this is the way to go. 

Listen to the reviews though: DO use wine yeast, DO put a tiny pinprick in the balloon (or condom, whichever you prefer), and DO make sure to siphon the wine and filter if you want to waste the least amount possible :) 

Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

A very good recipe for homemade wine. You might want to try "Brewer's" yeast instead of regular bread yeast though, it'll make it a bit dryer but it wont have that "yeasty" flavor. I have to agree with Newyear 498 about siphoning off of the sediment into a clean jug, and wine is one of those things that gets better with age! :)

I tried this recipe again, and it didnt turn out right. The latex balloon doesn't give the wine enough air to percolate, and it turns out to taste like rubbing alcohol.

I made a 7 gallon bucket. 12 cans (144oz) apple juice concentrate, 4lbs (8 cups) sugar and 5 grams wine yeast and water. Bring all ingredients except yeast to almost boiling (stirring so u dont burn the sugar), let cool to room temp or close, activate yeast by adding it to 100°ish water with a pinch of sugar, dump it all in the bucket and seal the lid and airlock (or hose running from the lid of bucket to a jar of water) store at room temp. When it stops bubbling siphon and filter. This was my grandpas recipe and i have given it to many ppl and it turns out good everytime so i know anyone can do it.

This wasn't bad but, if I left a little of the sugar out, would it be more "dry"? Anyone know?

Good recipe for a good, quick wine.  Just bottled up an apple wine that I let ferment for about 5 weeks.  I went with a bubbler method and did a couple of rackings (filterings) before bottling and it came out well.  Did not do a before/after hydrometer so I don't know the alcohol content but it tasted pretty strong.  Now, I'm no vintner so I bottled it like I usually do...in a Mason Jar.  Cheers!

This wine recipe is awesome!!! I made wine back in the fall, made it exactly like the recipe. It worked wonderfully, I liked the white wine the best. I used Welches white grape juice, it was my fav. This time I am going to take advice from the reviews and use some real fruit by using my juicer, then added it to the bottles. Cheap and cool way to bring wine to a party!! People will be impressed!

Okay, I just made this for the first time.  It aged for 5 weeks.  It is really good, beautiful color, but a little cloudy. I am drinking some now, it is really strong. I'm from Louisiana where drinking starts young, and trust me, this stuff is strong! I like it!

I've never made homemade wine before this.  It was simple to make, I ended up using a plastic gallon jug.  I didn't bottle it until 16 week's time was up due to lack of cork's & corker.  I filtered the wine into the bottles using cheesecloth and a funnel.  The first taste was similar to 19% Port wine but fruiter.  I like the stronger wine so I will definitely make more!!

For such a simple recipe, I am wonderfully impressed with the results!  I will be making this again, for sure!  I used frozen apple cider.  I also used only 3 cups of sugar, dissolved in boiled  water.  It's still quite sweet, and it's quite strong...somewhat like a dessert wine, not quite as sweet.  I did wait the six weeks, and it was worth it!

I made this from grape juice using the amount of yeast called for, and after 6 weeks it was still very yeasty in smell and flavor. After a few more weeks it had mellowed and is very tasty now, though extremely potent. I did 2 more batches using apple juice, 1 cup sugar, and 1 tsp of yeast for a 96 ounce jug of juice. I am trying it for the first time after 6 weeks, and it is really very good. A little dry,barely sweet, and a beautiful color. Not quite as potent as the grape but I prefer that. Thanks for the recipe! I am having such fun playing with this, and it will make nice Christmas gifts. If I have any left by then.

I followed the recipe exactly, took 4 weeks.  I boiled the water, added sugar for simple syrup. I have not tasted it yet, but it smells very good (and very strong).  I'd like to cut the alcohol content a bit.  I strained manually through my coffee pot 3 times, each time using 2 brown paper filters. Would love to use this in the homemade wine cooler recipe that I found on this site!  I started some apple last night.. Can't wait to taste!

As a first-timer, I had a really fun, easy experience making this! Of course, it doesn't taste like store-bought wine, but more like a fruity cocktail - still something I would let others try just for fun.
As many have done already, I would add the following tips:
1. boil the sugar in with the water beforehand
2. in fact, it's probably a good idea to reduce the amount of sugar
3. poke holes in your balloon to allow air to escape
4. for me, this recipe seems to have taken less than 6 weeks, but I waited 6 weeks anyways.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly using red grape juice concentrate. After about 2 weeks my balloon popped because i used a medium sized instead of a large. I thought it was ruined but i put another balloon on and poked a few holes in it this time and after 3 more weeks i siphoned it into another jug and sampled it and it was not as strong as i had anticipated but was very good and sweet.

I don't drink. But I decided to make some of my own wine for my 21st birthday. I did white grape, and apple raspberry. The white grape came out wonderful! Nice and sweet and the perfect amount of bubbles. I let  my family try it and they accused me of buying bottled wine and sneaking it into my containers!  I did read the other reviews and siphoned and filtered off the 'bottom of the barrel' crappy stuff. The result was a very strong, albeit good tasting wine. Will make again.

This sounds similar to my recipe.  My recipe calls for 3 cans of juice instead of 1, everything else is the same.  It's pretty potent so i mix up two additional cans of juice (1 can juice 3 cans water) and cut the wine after fermentation.

This is a super easy way to get into home brewing. I have made beer for years and this was the first attempt at wine making. First things first you definatley want to pour the wine into a container and get rid of the gunk at the bottom. In addition I make 5 gallon batches, when im done i like to mix in another frozen mix to sweeten it up. I also add potassium sorbet to keep it from fermenting, which is available at any home brew store or home brew online store. Again this does not taste great but it does the job for me and my college friends.

I used this a couple of years ago to make Strawberry wine & then strawberry/passionfruit.  Both got VERY good reviews from friends/family.  Common sense should tell you not to drink it without 'decanting' it from the original container.  I can't imagine anyone would drink it with the 'sludge' it creates!  This time, I'm going to try Mulberry.

Okay, ah. Do some research people. The dead yeast at the bottom... yeah, that collects up no matter if you make one gallon, or a whole barrel of wine. You'll always have to worry about some of that. Now if you place a tap just above the bottom, then you could probably strain all the top stuff out. And then just dump the dead yeast. I just pour it into another container, until it appears like too much of that stuff might get into it, and then dump the little bit left on the bottom. It'll probably get a little better over time, to then place a normal lid on your container. I found sometimes, Apple ferments faster. And will actually get stronger over a shorter period of time. It is almost too sweet, but I like it.
It lists leaving it sit for 6 weeks, but it's not bad to drink it after only 4. You want to ferment it for 4 to 6 weeks, and then refrigerate it if you can.

I found it to be an easy recipe, so have fun. A heads up though, it doesn't need to be kept too cool, or you'll stop the fermentation process.

i made this for fun after watching one of the ideas. It didn't come out so good probably because some of the wine went into the balloon during the process of putting it on. It was really alcoholic Will try this recipe again.

As a 20 year old college student, I thought I'd give this recipe a shot.  It was really easy to make, except for the wait.  I used grape frozen concentrate.  I really don't know how alcoholic this is, or healthy (4 cups sugar!) but the flavor is good.  I'll probably be making this on and off again for the next few months :) maybe longer, after I taste test some things from a local winery and see what I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

First time I tried this recipe I didn't know to puncture the balloon. I checked it after a few days and found the ballon had burst. I thought it might spoil, but I washed out another balloon, put it on and put a small hole it. After about 5 weeks I strained it through a coffee filter although it was still slowly working. I sterilized one quart canning jars in a boiling water bath and put the wine in them after they cooled, with rings and lids hand-tight, and then put them in the refrigerator. After 2 weeks in the refrigerator I saw that the jars had clear wine but a layer of sediment was stuck on the bottom of the jars. Upon tasting, it was very good, medium sweet, alcohol content percentage not known, but evident and appropriate. Everyone I gave it to, liked it. The next time, I made two 1 gallon batches, punctured each ballon and took it off after exactly 35 days, processed it the same way, but after 3 weeks of settling in refrigerator, I rebottled in clean sterile 1 quart jars so no sediment was on the bottoms of the jars. I gave most of it away, and everyone was most appreciative. Then I bought bung stoppers with "s" airlocks and a hydrometer. On the next batch I took before fermentation readings for potential alcohol, and measured the temperature for correction. Also I dissolved the sugar in water prior to adding yeast. I will take it off in a few more days and check after fermentation readings for alcohol % on it. Next time I may try 2 cans of 100% Welch's juice.

It might be "drinkable" after 6 weeks, but as an experienced mead maker, Newyear498is 100% right. you need to allow the fermentation byproducts to escape. I'm an environmental engineer and know a bit of chemistry. If you dont allow the CO2 to escape and filter out the yeast waste, it will take much longer for the brew to mellow to a palatable flavor. Don't confuse this with wine made with a vacuum sealed, temp controlled container.  It is a bargain basement price recipe. keep that in mind with your comments.  However, it will work quit well if you are patient.

*BTW: Ive made mead using this exact method, and it took nearly 6 months, so... BE PATIENT!!!!!!

I thought this recipe was actually good. Instead of a balloon I used a recieving blanket to cover my jugs and after a week the wine was delicious. Going to let it sit for a few more weeks tho.

My husband and I tried this as our fun little "Science project"  It was kind of fun to watch it go through all the stages.  We bought a huge jug and made a gigantic ammount-MISTAKE!! Well it made a great conversation piece.  I never had Boone Farm or MD 20/20, but I would immagine the taste is similar.  Not worth the time and effort.

Loved it of course.  Make sure everything is sterile and boiled out (glass jar preferably) makes for cleaner wine.  In prison we used the juiced pulp of any fruit we were using and threw it in with the juice.  Its what we called a kicker.  At home throw a pound of raisins in the wine.  It will actually speed up the sugar 'burning' process.  We would make a finished and tasty batch with a kicker in 5-7 days.  You'll know when the kicker is rocking when all the raisins rise to the top of the 'batch'.  Or throw some applesauce in the batch and stir well.  You'll see that rise and separate from the juice as it cooks.  When the kicker drops to the bottom of the jar.  The wine is done. Prison style.  BANANAS ARE AWESOME AS A KICKER TOO!

This is a great example of quick, easy and palatable wine. I use 100% White Grape juice and I have used White Grape/Peach blend. I ferment in a 2-gallon frosting pail (washed and sanitized) with a lid and a hole for the airlock. I do this so I can add a 1/2 cup of chopped raisins (white or dark) in a throw away muslin bag to give the wine a bit more body when finished.  I always keep one batch going, for fun. I highly recommend bottling and aging about 3 months or more to allow the wine to mellow a bit. I've noticed the older batches that have rested are less sharp tasting. WARNING: Do not sweeten and bottle without stopping the fermentation permanently with potassium sorbate or something similar. You will have popped corks and a mess (worst case) and/or highly pressurized sparkling wine (best case). Call it experience ;-)

i tried a similar recipe but it didnt say anything about waiting until the balloon deflates again. it just says after 21 days to bottle it. but there is a residue of some sort above the wine where the empty space is. Do i just remove that?

forgot the heating it up in a pot part. best to use a piece on cloth not a balloon hell a piece of toilet paper and a rubber band would work tissue something besides a balloon and like all whine the more it ages the stronger it is it kinda never stops working. use some charcoal and a coffee filter to filter it.[charcoal is opptional better taste if used] if u do use a balloon Clean it out and poke 1 or 2 hole in it don't want the latex stuff in the balloon in ur whine

Easy to assemble. I did dissolve the sugar in water ans poked a few holes in the balloon. I made two gallons. One red and one white. Can't wait to see how it turns out. Follow the good advice on here.

I LOVE this ultra homemade wine recipe! I used a feild berry juice, and let it sit maybe a month and a half, the bubbles weren't completely done bubbling, but I was impatient so I poured the wine off the sediment as carefully as I could and re bottled it. Unable to let it mellow further, I've been drinking it the couple weeks since! It's a wee bit harsh, and feels stronger, no complaints from me! Great with mulling spices.

I tried this recipe two years ago, and found it again today! The wine I made two years ago was fantastic; just sweet enough and a great mix of flavors. I did, however, realize that one has to filter the drink before bottling it! I used merlot grapes, concentrated cranberry/apple drink; it had a wonderful full bodied flavor, mild to the taste and made me crave "more, please"

I have recently made my first batch. I used apple cherry concentrate and dry yeast I racked the wine every 7 days. On day 21 I put it in the refrigerator. It wasn't producing any more bubbles. I didn't have a hydrometer when I started it but I checked it at day 14 and day 21 it had droped 14 my wine is very sweet. I let it sit int the refrigerator for a week. Noth else settled out. My wife asked me to cut it due to how strong it is. My second batch is brewing it is apple pamagranit and it has droped 17 the first week. It already taste very good. I can't wait for it to be done.  By the way my wife said it taste like a 12 dollar glass of wine she had when we went out for her birthday.

A few things I did before making this wine. instead of using a balloon, I used a little fermenting venting mechanism that Ibpurchased off Amazon (shown in picture below). So instead of waiting for a balloon to deflate I just watched for when the bubbles stopp Ed rising from the bottom of the jug to know when the wine was finished. Also, when it was finished fermenting, I used a tube to siphon the liquid off so I wouldn’t get the sediment at the bottom of the jug into the finished wine product. I read that simply pouring the entire contents of the fermentation into a different jug causes the wine to be bitter. I used frozen grape juice. The finished product tastes like wine, only a bit harsher.

Giving this 5 stars with caveats...
FIRST, USE WINE YEAST! It's cheap and easy to get (I live on a remote ranch, so Amazon is my friend)
SECOND, forget the balloon and instead poke a small hole in the lid of whatever container you're using (I use a cranberry juice container), then push a piece of flexible rubber tubing (found at any hardware store for pennies) through the top, so it's barely poking through the inside part of the lid. Put a dollop of glue around the outside of the tube/lid to seal it. Then put the other end of the tube into a glass/jar/jug of water. This allows the gases to escape (they travel down the tube and will bubble into the water) without letting air into the wine.
THIRD--most DIY wines say to let the wine age for 6 months after homebrewing to mellow the alcohol, but I found a much faster solution. I buy really cheap wine that's about 6% alcohol (I buy one that rhymes with Harbor List lol) and mix it with my homebrew 50/50. My homebrew is then ready to drink, but still a lot stronger than 6%, let me tell you. One or two glasses is about all I can handle :) Plus, I now have double the amount I just brewed, but still have only spent a few bucks for a LOT of wine! Win-Win!

I love that you use non traditional bottles for storing made wine. I'm going to try this recipe. I've made many complex and traditional meads, and even a jolly rancher wine (or two!). They've all turned out great, and so I'm familiar enough with the process to know this is a do-able recipe and will work totally fine. Thanks for sharing

This was the first wine I ever tried to make, and have since started making proper wine. That said, this wasn't a bad first experiment. I used Welch's grape juice concentrate and the finished product was a lot like a jam sandwich. Over time, as the wine aged, it took on a bricky blush color and the grape flavor is more of a finisher after the strong alcohol bite. Apparently bread yeast tolerates high levels of alcohol.

I use this for cooking, as I'm not fond of the flavor.  It's nothing like the wine you buy in the store. However, if your goal is to simply make alcohol, then this will do the trick.

I used a milk jug and Welch's grape juice. I didn't have a balloon, so I used a surgical rubber glove which deflated after two weeks. I did a "stress"test by putting the cap back on to see if the jug would expand but it didn't. I poured it into a funnel with a coffee filter into a glass of ice and it's not too bad. I plan to start another batch tomorrow and use two cans of juice.

The balloons deflated, after 2 weeks.  I did put holes in them.  I tried one, with cherry juice and one guava. The cherry came out strong,  and really dry. I am wondering how to make it sweeter? I am scared to try the guava, it smelled a little funny at first so Im not sure of its spoiled.

I tried a slightly different version I made 2 gallons
15 lbs fresh cranberrys Juiced That much cranberrys 
and it only makes 1/2 gallon of pure juice the rest just water
and 5 cups sugar should have used more
I used dry active yeast It went off too fast in 2 days it seemed done
Low alcohol probly should have used wine yeast 
Dry active yeast might not make higher alcohol

this is the first attempt at wine. EVER. i used the balloon method. however i tried to reformulate the recipe to a 1qt batch. combined 1-12oz frozen apple concentrate, about 3/4 of a .25oz pak of dry actv. yeast. and 2ish cups of sugar. poured into 1qt(40oz beer bottle) and filled remainder with warm water. (not knowing about the pin-hole trick for venting). based on the 4-6wk per gal. time table i allowed only 5 days of fermentation.very cloudy. strained the qt. off through coffee filter and began experimental drinking. first taste dry and bitter with very mild sweetness and a balloony aftertaste.

Excellent recipe for starters!  Here's a few tips:

1:  Poke holes in your balloon to allow carbon dioxide to escape.  (If you plan on using this recipe a lot I'd suggest buying an airlock, they are about a dollar each.)

2: Use a juice you like.  If you don't like the taste of the juice, you won't like the wine it makes.

3: If you have a gallon jug of the juice just pour some out and do all the adding sugar, mixing and fermentation in that jug.  It comes to you sterile already.

4:  Whatever you are mixing, make sure you shake it well and get lots of air mixed with it.  The yeast needs lot of air in the beginning to get their colony to grow.  Later on you want to limit the air so you don't end up with vinegar.

5: Have fun and share with friends.  You'll look cool making your own booze.

This was a great trial and error experience that turned into some great memories with the husband and friends.
IF YOU MAKE THIS
poke a few holes as another commenter suggested. Make sure you strain the wine, because the sediment in it is gross and you dont want to drink that.
The balloon will collect gunk in it, and if it falls into the wine, it will sour it, but dont throw it out! Thats red or white wine vinegar and can be used for cooking! (Just doooont drink it haha!) 
I doubled the sugar in mine, but its all about preference. My husband pointed out that you could also improvise with another *ahem* latex item since they have about the same purpose for this recipe, just get the plain, no additives in the package kind lol. Also, they have fermentation locks on amazon for under 10 that can be used over and over as well. 
I used all types of juices for this recipe, and kept them in their original bottles, and 7/8 turned out fine, with some being better than others. The watermelon soured, so im not sure if it was from the gunk falling back in, or just the fact it was watermelon, but i wouldnt try that. I used a mango peach juice that turned into a FABULOUS mango peach hard cider within 4 weeks. The grape and white grape turned out great, and the strawberry was to die for. Keep it in the top of a closet or cabinet or somewhere you wont disturb it. Good luck and enjoy your wine! ??????

Instead of fruit juice I added fresh PawPaws and so far it is doing well. Two weeks to go to final product. I did rack the wine with 1 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of sugar for the final 2 weeks.  Noticing activity again more than there was. Racking allows you to get some of the dead yeast out which can change the flavor of the wine.

I made this in college yrs ago. My recipe called for heating some water or “grape juice concentrate” my choice,  to dissolve sugar. I also read need to let mixture cool to 90 degrees before adding yeast. I did put ballon on and waited like 2 mos . Balloon never went back down to original size but did decrease at least half to quarter inflated size. It was a little bitter but strong (alcohol content) as a mutha. Half gallon tore several college boys up. One note, I attributed the bitterness to to only using two cups of sugar. Go with this recipe or four cups

A little much on the sugar, considering the yeast will leave whatever sugar is left and die once alcohol content reaches 12%. Also, I do it the simple way, without any balloons or condoms, etc. I just put a paper towel over a gallon jug and then put the lid over that and twist it, leaving a bit of breathing room. Been doing it that way for awhile and haven't run into a vinegar problem :) Don't shake while fermenting, and always toss the bottom inch or so.

all though i have not made this yet iv heard this recipe is great with a few tweeks iv made many notes from other people that have left a review but i still have few questions please if somebody can respond please do if i use a glass tube instead of a balloon how will i know if the wine is done? and after 2 weeks of starting i heard to syphon the yeast out and add 2 table spoons of sugar to some yeast in sum water to add to the yeast count and then add back to the juice and sugar mixture to stop the funky taste will i use the same yeast or new yeast?only reason im confused is because it says to rehydrate it

Ok, I am rating this 5 stars for now because I just started it tonight. So, I am hoping this comes out alright, fingers crossed! I will update my review as soon as I filter it, chill it and try it. Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe, however long it may take, lol. My daughter laughed at me and said I was making jailhouse wine, haha. Yup!

I uped my concentrate to 2 cans per gallon and used less sugar to 2.5 cups and a whole pack of yeast per gallon for concord. fermented in a couple weeks. pretty good but  kicking stout. witch I like.this time I'm adding frozen assorted fruit to it and using hard plastic jugs like gold peak tea jugs I think the flavor will be better than the soft milk jugs.give it a try I like this recipe. ill let you know how it works
