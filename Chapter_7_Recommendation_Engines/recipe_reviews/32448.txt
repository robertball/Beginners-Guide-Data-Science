I love smoothie's for breakfast and the combination of orange and banana is wonderful, however I tweaked the recipe to my tastes. I froze my banana and used orange juice vs. a fresh orange. I left out the salt and used a bit more ice. I used less milk and more yogurt to make it thicker and cut back on the sugar. Overall, very good but you do need to play with it a bit.

I used orange juice instead of fresh oranges. This smoothie was a bit sour tasting-the yogurt and oj made a sour after taste of spoiled milk. I will make again but add my own variations.

My kids and I made this "potion."  They liked it, but it seemed a bit sour with the yogurt until I added about 1/4 cup orange juice.  This seemed to do the trick and it was gone quickly.

I have a twist to this recipe that made it turn out wonderful. I put one banana chopped, about 12 ice cubes, 1 cup of milk, 3 drops of vanilla extract, two peeled fresh oranges and 5 packets of Splenda. I really like things sweet, and the Splenda added a great taste!

I have to agree with the previous review.  Done by the recipe, it lacks what your looking for in taste when it comes to a smoothie though I will say the fresh oranges vs. orange juice does make a difference.  I changed it up just a bit, added some vanilla powder and a few extra ice cubes - for me this did the trick.

i used this as a guide but i left out the milk, salt and sugar and one of the oranges. all i really had was one banana, one orange and a single-serve container of lite yogurt with a few ice cubes. worked out perfect for one serving.

This was very good. Next time I'll leave out the sugar or use half the amount. Other than that, it was great.

This was good, but I don't think the sugar is really necessary.  I only added 2 tablespoons and probably would even omit that if I made this again.  I didn't have oranges on hand but I substituted a 1/2 cup of orange juice plus added about 8 additional ice cubes.  I think next time I would add some fresh pineapple which I usually have on hand.

I make a lot of breakfast smoothies, but I like them thick. I knew the amount of liquid vs. frozen was going to produce a really thin smoothie; my banana was even frozen. I have a whole bag of sweet, juicy oranges, so I was glad to find a recipe that used the whole orange. My blender is really strong, so I had no issues with the orange being stringy. I added a bit of protein powder and ground flax. I loved it, but next time I will use WAY less milk and more ice. Oh, and I left out the sugar since my fruit is so sweet. I even added the salt, can't detect it though so next time I'll leave it out.

This is very good and refreshing.  I halved the recipe, subbed 1/4 cup orange juice for the oranges, omitted the salt, subbed 2 packets of Splenda for the sugar, and used 4 ice cubes.

This turned out pretty yummy.  I used two Clementines and a 6 oz container of vanilla yogurt and it wasn't sour at all, like some noted before.  (I didn't add juice, either.)

This was an OK recipe.  The orange was stringy so I had to chew that part and I hate chewing smoothies.  If I make this recipe again I will use orange juice instead of of oranges.

I enjyoed this a lot! I didn't have any yogurt, so I substituted by adding some vanilla to the milk and ice cubes to thicken it up a bit. Plus I cut the sugar. Great vitamin c and potassium drink for a quick meal! :)

I halved the recipe but with the adjustments I made still had quite a large smoothie.  I omitted the ice, salt, and sugar, used a frozen half-banana, used two mandarins (with just one the banana was overwhelming) and added half a pear and a tbsp of ground flaxseed.  There were a few bits of orange membrane so next time I'd blend it longer.  It tasted great and the orange-dairy combo didn't curdle as I feared.  This is a great winter smoothie as it uses fruits that are more easily and cheaply obtained than strawberries and other common smoothie fruits.

Mmm... Good way to drink your fruit!! I used four small mandarin oranges (Cuties), omitted salt & yogurt, used 6 splenda packets instead of sugar, used about 6 cubes of ice... Simply delicious!

I would give it five stars but I didn't follow it to a tee.  I didn't have the yogurt it asked for, but did have Yoplait Bananas and Cream.  Then I halved the sugar amount and milk amount.  This was sooo delicious and exactly what I was looking for before going out to the gym.  It's super simple as far as preparation and the ingredients it asks for.  It's a good enough thickness for a home-made smoothie and is perfect for something to fill a slight hunger but isn't too heavy.  I don't suggest drinking both servings in one sitting though, especially when heading off to the gym; I did because it was so good, and now I'm so full I can hardly move!

I made this using a handful of frozen red grapes in place of the ice.  That gave it a nice "confetti" look but also added extra sugar...thought the end result was a little too sweet.  Added kefir to the smoothie instead of yogurt, and some vanilla extract.  Not sure I liked the texture the blended orange gave, maybe next time I'll use just orange juice because I did like the combo of orange and banana.

I've been craving smoothies during my pregnancy, so I was excited when I found one with the fruits I like in it.  I substituted a mango for one of the oranges, and I only used about a tsp. of sugar.  Frozen yogurt works as well as regular yogurt.  YUM!

We added a few more ice cubes to the mix. We also didnt have any vanilla yogurt left so we used Trix rasberry yogurt. It added a little color and added another taste to the mix. The sugar is needed but can be left out. This tasted very GREAT!!!

I didn't think that this recipe needed the sugar, so left that part out. I also left the milk and the ice. I threw in a little pinapple, just cuz I had some if the fridge. Very tasty!

Great but like others said, a little sweet for me.  So I reduced the sugar to about 2 tbsp.  I also foroze the banana in chunks and always have milk frozen in cubes.  Then I don't have to water down a smoothie using ice cubes--frozen bananas and milk ice cubes do the trick.  Also, plain yogurt for me.  I first came across a version of this in German Class in High School. We were having a German food day. One of the girls was German and brought her favorite food.  simply mil and oranges blended together.  WE all thought it would be awful, but it was delicious. We never know.

The Orange Banana Smoothie delivers: it tastes pleasantly of orange and banana; and if banana were a color, I would call the delightful pale hue banana-orange.  I had only softball-sized navel oranges on hand and so, wishing to avoid creating Orangey McOrangerson's Orange-Fetish Delight, I used only one.  I assumed one of these mutants was about the size of two standard oranges and, anyway, it's a breakfast smoothie and nobody's handing out beauty prizes at 6:30 in the morning.  When I wake up more, however, I shall give this smoothie a silver medal (my favorite avocado smoothie got the gold) and add it to my standard repertoire. Caveat: yes, it's a little "stringy."  Might be because real oranges are stringy. You cooould use pulp-free OJ - or just deal with it: fiber's good for you and, unless your oranges are more like the Juggernaut than mine was (which isn't possible), it's not only bearable but tasty.

As the recipe is, it's only three stars. I bypassed the yogurt, as the other testers didn't like it, and used a bit of buttermilk mixed with orange juice instead. That was great. My kids guzzled this down. I also added a bit of vanilla flavoring and cut back the sugar to one tbsp. as I felt 1/4 was way too much. Good breakfast smoothie, with my adjustments.

Very tasty but I think I will try using a little less milk, maybe 3/4 cup.

Cut out the absolutely ludicrous 1/4 cup of sugar and you’ve got yourself a delicious, healthy smoothie.

Better to use the fresh orange for the juice rather thn pack orange juice. 

I increase the amount of fresh orange juice for more aromatic 

I replace the normal sugar with Gula Melaka ( Coconut suagr ) 

And I use the vanilla ice cream as the replacement of vanilla yogurt 

For overall , it taste amazing and I like the this smoothies very much

I will say I left out the banana because I didn't have it at the time.  I wasn't a fan.  I used real oranges and the pulp just made it unbearable.  The taste wasn't too bad though.

I altered the recipe slightly, and used it only as a guideline. I omitted the salt and ice cubes completely, and used only one orange. I also used two flavoured yogurt cups equalling 200g total (mango and apricot), and it gave the smoothie a bit more flavour.
However, I feel that using fresh oranges are a risk, because the oranges could be extremely sour or dry, which would ruin the taste. Maybe next time, I'll try substituting the oranges with orange juice!
Regardless, I will definitely make this again!

I liked the fresh taste, but it was definitely not thick, more like a liquid drink. I think cutting the milk in 1/2 would be much better.

I hate when people review but alter the recipes - - but I did it in this case base on what I had.  Here is how I tailored and it was awesome - 2 small bananas;  one orange; 8 ice cubes (or more);  I didn't do the salt and only did 1 tablespoon of sugar - here was the bonus - I added 1/2 tsp of coconut extract.  YUMMY - so good;  if anyone is familiar with surf city squeeze - this taste like the banana coconut

FABULOUS! The only changes I made were using a frozen banana and substituting sucralose for sugar. I think the complaints about texture may have to do with the machine you're using. I used a Ninja, with great results. This may be my favorite smoothie to date...thanks for sharing!!

I did not care for this recipe. I could hardly taste the banana. I would make it with 3 or 4 bananas and 1 or a half of an orange and I would also use the Christmas mandarin oranges and use 2 of those but 1 or a half of the big oranges

Only one of the few recipes that give me confidence in putting whole oranges in smoothies.... I skipped the ice and salt, use 2 bananas and 1 orange... (will try 2 oranges and 1 banana next time) and a very yummy, thick and tasty smoothie was born! Thank you!

It's good,but instead of ice, freeze yer oranges. Rest the oranges in hot tapwater a few minutes, then peel easily and section them. A little nuts, or grapenuts, or milled flaxseed is good. I don't use yogurt, but use milk+orange juice. I use less sugar. Frozen bananas make my blender work too hard. A mini-pinch of baking soda helps tame the sourness. And a splash of vanilla extract is really good.
