This recipe was super easy to put together.  I was a little scared by a whole cup of cumin but it worked out fine.   Suprisingly, even with the peppers, the meat wasn't spicy enough for us. I think I would increase the jalepenos next time or maybe add some cayenne pepper.  I followed the recipe  except for I had to add salt to the meat mixture. I couldn't imagine cooking meat without it.  I added about a tablespoon of salt and some black pepper.  I started my meat out frozen.  I accidentally cooked on high 3 hours longer than I was supposed to when I fell asleep!  I cut back on the low temp. time by 3 hours due to this mistake. The meat was very tender. For us,the taste was a 3 and ease was a 4. If you don't like things too spicy it should be perfect as is.  Thanks for sharing it.

Great recipe. I also changed cooking time but I did it on purpose. I did 8 hours on high then 3 more on low. I also cut the meat into smaller pcs. It is plenty of time to make it tender and my husband didn't have to wait as long to eat. Just keep the lid closed. Great taste though.

I made this for a potluck and it was a big hit. Instead of 6 cups of water I used 3 cups of orange juice and 3 cups of chicken stock. I reduced the cooking liquid down to about one cup and it made a great sauce to moisten the cooked meat when I reheated it.

I didn't brown this and it still turned out great, because you're only going to shred it later. This was great

It was very easy to make and smelled delicious... but it lacked the taste I was hoping for. I was hoping for something a little spicy and savory and it fell short for me... a little bland. Maybe it would have been better with a little chihuahua cheese and guacamole.

Well done, carnitas expert! This crock-pot method is perfect for pulled pork too. I used a shorter cooking time (12 hours) because a 4-pound shoulder is about the max from my supermarket. I also used less liquid with that smaller shoulder roast, but I stayed with the full 1-cup measure of cumin. (**ALWAYS leave the lid on a crock-pot. Don't stir it or peek just to see if its working. It is. Muster your will power!**) Chili peppers lose their heat with longer cooking, also when seeded. I add them near the end, maybe leave in the seeds if I really want heat. Or put out a bowl of minced jalapenos for people to sprinkle to taste. This Pico deGallo is top-drawer. Use it often. In place of salsas and other dips. Try this Pico for quesadillas.

Good.  Not difficult at all but takes a little time to start.  Mexican cumin in 2.125 oz plastic pouches is a little more than 1/2 cup.  Thought it would be ghastly with so much, but it was good!  Biggest downside of this recipe was that the smell of it cooking overnight gave me crazy dreams before I finally connected what I was smelling in my sleep!

Fixed this as written and it was absolutely delicious! We ate it in tortillas the first meal, but had leftovers without the tortillas and the pico de gallo on top. It made tons, so I froze the rest. I think it would be fabulous over rice with the pico on top. You could even add BBQ sauce to the shredded meat and have a super BBQ pork. I will use this crockpot method anytime I want super tender pulled pork!

My picky husband loved the whole recipe! I used the pico and carnitas for a Homemade Chipotle Burrito Bowl and this recipe made it a hit! Definitely will use this again!
