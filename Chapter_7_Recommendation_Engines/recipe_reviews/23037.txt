I used this recipe last year for my first Thanksgiving in attempt to impress my mother and my mother-in-law.  I was successful both ways.  The entire family complimented my cooking ability.  In fact, this year I was asked to have Thanksgiving again.  And the first thing I did was look up this recipe.  Thank you so much!  I think I may modify it a bit by pouring over a bottle of beer or wrapping it in bacon....

This is my first time making a turkey.  My family love it!  I brushed the outside of the turkey with melted unsalted butter instead of vegetable oil and it gave it a nice golden color.  I removed the foil during the last 45 minutes of cooking and basted about every 10 minutes. I will be making it again.

I didn't use the stuffing mix. Instead I grated some bread into a bowl - about 8 slices (after letting the slices sit out flat on the counter to dry out for a couple of hours). And then added enough melted butter to make it moist (about 1/2 cup) and added the cooked celery and onion as per recipe directions. I also added celery salt and pepper and poultry seasoning for flavor. This stuffing is much better then the box and not difficult to make. I also put some rosemary, salt and pepper in the vegetable oil and rubbed it under the turkey skin rather then over the exterior. Keep in mind that a convection oven will cook a 12 pound turkey in just a little over half the time. Mine was ready in just over 2 hours. But make sure you check that the stuffing reaches 165 degrees.

Thank you so much for making my very first Christmas dinner phenomenal!  I never made a turkey before this and I must say it really gave me a major boost of confidence in my cooking skills.  My nine-year-old even helped.  She didn't want to put her hand inside for the stuffing, but did everything else with me.  She could probably do it herself next time because it was so easy!  Before rubbing the turkey exterior with veggie oil, I pierced it all over with a large fork to allow the spices to get in, then seasoned and "massaged"  the exterior.  The package of the turkey suggested adding strips of bacon to the exterior for additonal flavoring, which I did also.  It was truly among the moistest turkeys I have ever eaten.  Thank you for helping make my holiday the best I have had in years.

I also made this last year to try and impress my in-laws....who came over sort of last minute.  Couldn't use white bread or butter (mom's health issues), so unfortunately that made a big difference in the taste. Will probably try a different recipe this year (or trying to tinker with this one to make it a little more exciting), but this was good.  Thanks for the post.

this recipe looks similar to the one I always make, that my mother made. It may possibly be better to use a broth rather than water to enrich the flavor.

I cooked this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. Not only did I get a good deal of compliments, but there was barely enough turkey left for leftovers the next day!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving AND Christmas last year, and it worked perfectly! The turkey and stuffing were moist and delicious. I'll be using this recipe again.

This was the receipe my husband and I used the first year we celebrated Thanksgiving together. We love love love the stuffing. We have been using it for four years now and it never gets old. The only thing I do different is use wheat bread crumbs.

I have always stayed away from making turkeys but gave in for my husbands birthday back in Sept (sorry for rating this so late).  The turkey, stuffing, along w/ a gravy recipe I had was beyond pefect.  In fact, my mother- who has always made the turkeys on all holidays, asked for this recipe and the entire family, 22ppl RAVED about it! Delicious, easy, perfect!

I didn't make the homemade stuffing listed in this recipe but I used the advice on how to cook the actual turkey. Everyone raved--my husband loved it. Thank you so much for the great recipe. I know I'll be using it for years to come.

Such an easy way to make stuffing. I also "docker" up stove top..Can add apples, nuts, etc.  This recipe is simple and tastes great. Keep basting with chicken broth so you have juices for gravy! Happy Thanksgiving

My first time cooking a turkey.  I did everything except the rosemary and sage due to my allergeries.  It was so yummy and a great flavor.  I had put the butter on the outside and then when you add the seasoning - delicious!!!  Will tell others to check this recipe out!

It was really good and so easy to make! The turkey was still very juicy while the outside skin was nicely browned and crisped. The stuffing wasn't anything spectacular, but still had very good flavor. My one complaint is that my inside meat was not quite as spiced as I would have liked, but a little salt and pepper once it was on my plate did the trick.

Even though this is a very simple recipe, I think it is far better than any of the more complicated fancy recipes hands down! This will always be the recipe I go to for turkey roasting. The family loves it!

First time making a turkey and it turned out great. I used a turkey size oven bag which decresed my cook time by an hour. I also added butter under the skin and a half apple inside the body and the other half cut up around the outside. It was just right. Super easy and everyone loved it.
