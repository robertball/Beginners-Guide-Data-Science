This recipe was so simple and very easy to make!!! I deleted the habanero peppers though, but if you like it extra hot, then by all means add them! I have a particular resturant that I love to eat at because of their spicy shrimp pasta, now.... I have a simple recipe on how to make it myself! Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit in my home, my boyfriend absolutely loved it and my friends want me to make it again! Only one bit of advice though, watch the heat when your heating up the flavors, or you could burn it and practically choke to death from the smoke it creates in the house! Also, add flour to your liking to thinken the sauce so that it won't be so runny. Other than that.... definitely two thumbs up, will be making this again and again.....

The shrimp had a great flavor, it tasted and smelled delicious. However the sauce was really thin. It would have been perfect with some flour to thicken it up a bit. I tweaked the recipe a bit based on what I had in my pantry. In addition to the chili powder I added onion powder, cajun seasoning and parsley. I also used green bell pepper instead of the habenero.

use caution with peppers...a glove is appropriate. i pulled the shrimp out and added a corn starch/cold water mixture to the "runny" sauce and it turned out fabulous.

This recipe was a disaster.  The cream did not make a sauce as I though it would, but stayed runny.  The flavor was very good but overall I felt it a waste of time and good shrimp.  Also, beware of "Hunan hands" when cutting up the jabanero peppers.  Your fingers will feel like they're on fire if you're not careful.  I had to call poison control it was so bad.  My suggestion: wear gloves.

I choose to serve this as a pasta sauce, using corn starch to thicken. I also add mushrooms. Delicious!! I've substituted Serano peppers for the Haba√±eros. Just as wonderful. This is our date night go-to recipe.

This was by far the best shrimp recipe I have ever tasted. I loved the heat, and the hint of chili and garlic. I did add some corn starch and cold water to thicken it up a bit. I served this dish over linguini and everyone loved it.

SOOO Spicy! And good. I love the creamy sauce. Make sure you wear gloves when cutting the pepper, I made that mistake and my hands were burning for days!

This was the first meal I made my boyfriend and he loved it.  He asked for it again and it has only been a couple of weeks.  I did follow others advice about adding parmesan cheese and a little corn starch.  Tonight I will try adding tomatoes as another reviewer suggested.  Thank you!

Boil half a box of angel hair pasta and toss it in the pan with the shrimp and cream sauce. This makes a great main dish for a dinner party or date night.

Very easy to prepare, but I thought the sauce needed some tomatoes.  I added parsley and some parmesan cheese and made a thin rue so the sauce would not be runny.  Also, do use a lot of peppers mine was far too hot, but good.

Delicious, quick and easy! I made this for New Years Eve for my husband, who is a pasta lover. The only adjustment I made to the recipe was to add some grated Parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce, so it could be served over angel hair pasta. Yum! This will definitely be a "go to" recipe.

This is a good base recipe, but I definitely have made some changes, which in my opinion takes it from 4 stars to 5 stars. Replaced habeneros with jalapenos and added bell peppers for more texture. Also added extra spices - Chipotle chili powder, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I also add a corn starch and water at the end to thicken the sauce. Served over angel hair pasta, with salad and crusty bread. Now it's one of my favorites!

Delicious flavor even without habanero. I had a mix of different peppers in a jar, added just a teaspoon, but so much flavor. I need to learn how to thicken the sauce, but even as runny as it was we ate it all with pasta.
