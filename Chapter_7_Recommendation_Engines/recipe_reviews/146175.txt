Beautiful dessert that came together in minutes.  I liked the shortbread crust, which was a nice change from the standard graham cracker crust -  I used white rather than brown sugar and it was tender and easy to cut and serve.  The filling is pleasantly sweet and nicely laced with the lemon zest. As for the topping, I found I needed to add a little water to get it a little saucier.  Those who find most desserts too big for their needs, or for those who would simply like smaller sized desserts just so they can bake more often, may find it interesting to note that I easily scaled this down to three servings and prepared it in a 6" square baking pan. In this smaller version, the crust needed just 9 minutes to bake, and the filling only 20 minutes.  This will yield four very generous servings, or 6 more "reasonable" sized servings.

Note: The pan used should really be a 9x13 baking dish.  Sorry for the mix up.

I am rating this 5 stars because of a few little changes I made. I think the author may have made an error by not adding liquid to the blueberry filling. I added the juice of a whole lemon to a measuring cup, then topped it with water until it filled a half cup. Then stirred the cornstarch into the lemon water before cooking with the blueberries and sugar. Because there is so much sour cream in the filling, I added two tablespoons of flour to give it more structure so it set up quicker. I mixed it all by hand so I didn't add too much air to the filling as I like a smooth, silky cheesecake; banging the pan on the counter a couple times also help the air bubbles rise to the top so it comes out smoother. As written this cake is very sweet, by cutting the sugar in half in all 3 layers, this pie is out of this world good, and is a must make dessert if you have blueberry lovers to please!!

All in all this is a tasty dessert. My only problem is that the crust is very hard and difficult to cut. Perhaps the crust should not bake quite as long. Maybe I pressed it into the baking dish too firmly. I'm not sure that would have made a difference. Also, my cheesecake was completely baked and cracking at the minimum baking time. I also added several extra handfuls of blueberries. I added enough water to moisten the sugar before making the blueberry topping. Next time I may add a touch of lemon juice to the topping as it's incredibly sweet.

I usually prefer my cheesecakes crustless but this one was delicious! Great blend of textures and flavours, although I did omit the lemon (not a fan). Really enjoyed the fresh blueberry topping as opposed to the canned version. You can taste the difference. Followed other commenter's advice to cut down on the sugar and am really glad I did! Turned out great. **Tip: If you don't want your cheesecake to crack, bake it with the oven door ajar an inch :)

All in all, I have to rate this one as a three star recipe. It has a few issues: 1) The crust is tasty, but really hard. In fact, it's so hard that the cheesecake segment separates as pieces are cut, 2) the texture came out a bit rubbery, not like some of the other cheesecake recipes from this site, which are the typical NY cheesecake, and 3) the overall flavor is off a notch or two from most cheesecake recipes. The best part of the recipe is the blueberry topping, which was excellent. I did add a little water, about 1/4 cup so the mixture wouldn't burn as it was heated. I reduced the sugar a bit on the cheesecake and blueberry mixtures, so it wouldn't be too sweet.

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made. It is easy and it isn't over the top. I followed the exact directions on everything but the topping. I didn't have enough fresh blueberries so I grabbed out the rest of a package of mixed fruit and threw it in. Delicious! I will definitely make this one again.

This is very easy, delicious recipe.  I baked it in a 9" springform pan with great results.  I had read cautions in a review about the crust being too hard so I baked it for only 15 minutes before pouring in the filling.  I served it with some fresh, sliced strawberries that had been tossed in a little sugar and allowed to sit for 10 minutes.  Superb!

I didn't have enough blueberries to do a full recipe so I cut it in half and used a pre-made pie crust.  I like homemade crusts better, and since I didn't use the crust in this recipe so I only rated it a 4.  However, the part of the recipe I made was amazing and I can't wait to try it with the crust next time.

I made this dessert for a famliy bbq and got rave reviews.  Even my brother who said he didn't like cheesecake said it was good.  Like a previous review, mine also split when cooked the minimum time but the blueberry mixture easily hid the crack.

very good, but nearly ruined the shortbread when I realized that a 2 qt dish , which the recipe calls for is too small. You need a  9 x 13" baking dish. I already had the crust baked and had to repack it in to the correct size pan. I will try it again and I'm shore that it'll be a winner.

I made them in individual cups. The crust was good. The blueberries were wonderful. The “cheesecake” didn’t have cheese cake consistency it was more of a soufflé texture. I will keep looking.

Firstly I made this on more than one occasion and to be perfectly honest the last attempt was so much better. Instead of the shortbread crust I used old faithful graham cracker crust came out wonderfully, secondly I used 4 packages of cream cheese to give it that cheese texture this was more like a japanese cheesecake whereas Italians prefer the cheese taste. I also added more vanilla extract other than that I followed everything else.  The blueberry compote was wonderful with a nice cup of coffee. I'll be making this again real soon.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake. I made a pretty big mistake and added a cup of white sugar to the crust mixture. Later I realized that cup of sugar was meant for something else, but was confused by the wording of the recipe (for the crust, "add sugar" should really say "add brown sugar"). I used both brown and white sugar in the crust and it was hard as a rock. I had no kitchen tool that would cut through it! I will try this again and make it correctly this time. The topping was amazing though. I added some blackberries to it and it made way too much but the extra can be used to top french toast or pancakes or even angel food cake.

I made this for our daughter's 21st birthday. It was a hit!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and halfed sugar in filling and topping and I added 1/2 c water with the blueberries.  It was perfect and the crust was a nice change because I don't care for graham wafers either.  The filling had a nice consistency and flavour.

This is an excellent recipe. Easy to make. I did add juice from half of the lemon. Some to the cream cheese layer and some to the blueberry mixture.  Yummy! Very easy to eat too much.

DELICIOUS! I took the advice of others who have made this and I used 3/4 of the sugar on the cheesecake layer itself and 1/2 the sugar on the blueberry sauce. I also baked the crust for 15 mins instead of 20 mins and it wasn't difficult to cut. I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!

Easy dessert! I halved the recipe and it turned out wonderful! I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk for the egg part.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!!
