Thank you for posting this recipe!  Good Coconut oil is better than butter.  I like to make a similar recipe for NO BAKES that my kids love. I use....  1/2 cup coconut oil, 1/2 c. cocoa powder, 1/2 c. honey or Agave, 3/4 c. Peanut or Almond Butter,  Lightly melt over low heat then add,1 tsp. vanilla and 3 c. Oatmeal.   Yummy!

I loved that this recipe had healthy ingredients.  It almost tastes like a Mounds bar the first time you try it. The texture is so smooth and velvety but I couldn't eat the whole thing (even though I would have liked to) because it does have a lot of oil in it. It got quite hard from being in the fridge for a while so you might want to leave it out to soften. UPDATE:  I like to make half the recipe and after mixing add 1/2 cup finely shredded coconut and 1/2 sliced almonds.  Then I shape these into balls and refrigerate. These melt quickly but they are so good!

coconut oil can be tricky.  to help it blend smoothly and reach the ideal consistency, blend it with the cocoa using a double broiler, or blend in a saucepan above a skillet full of heating water.  when done, then add in RAW unheated honey.  cocnut oil is great than in heating it this way it still retains its properties, the honey is the ingredient that does better raw, b/c heating it or buying it heated ruins its health benefits.

i thought this was a waste of ingredients.  it didn't turn out at all, and was too oily.  i ended up mixing some other things into it and baking it, in the hope of turning it into something edible.

This was exactly what I was looking for - a way to get more coconut oil in my boys for their eczema and a way to get local honey in them for their environmental allergies!!  

I made half a recipe and it was gone within 24 hours. We loved it and had requests for more!

If you have to melt the coconut oil to get it to a liquid, do so gently to retain all it's beneficial characteristics.

Will make again! Thank you!

I was looking for a chocolate candy recipe using organic extra virgin coconut oil, this was great, thank you! (I don't measure when I bake). I slightly melted the oil, used a small amount of cane sugar instead of honey, because I was out, whisked in the sugar & bakers cocoa, added finely ground coconut, spooned mixture over raw almonds & raw cashews. Yummy! Satisfied my sweet tooth & helped my brain & cholesterol, too!

With all due respect, I really didn't care for it.  It was like eating a solidified slab of oil with an odd aftertaste.  Sorry! :((

I was looking for a recipe to turn my coconut oil into chocolate, and this fit the bill very well.  I used a high-quality extra virgin, organic, cold-pressed coconut oil and these are wonderful!  

My coconut oil was solid at room temperature, but my honey was crystallized, so I microwaved the honey and stirred the oil into the warm honey, then used an immersion blender to get the (sifted) cocoa blended in well. 

It's a keeper, for sure!

A healthy chocolate - who would've ever dreamed! This recipe was amazing, defininately a keeper. (although I would recommend a little less honey, it is quite sweet.) Oh, and a small tip for those who don't want to wait 2 hours to eat your fudge; simple - put it in the freezer for a few minutes and... tah-dah!

With such polarized reviews I decided to make a small batch... literally 1 tbs cocoa, 1 tbs coconut oil, and 1/2 tbs honey... just mixed it up in a small bowl.  In the freshly stirred form it is rather oily, but refrigerate it as little as 15 minutes and it's quite good.  I must say, though, it's not fudge like traditional fudge.  When it fully hardens in the fridge, it's exactly like the filling of a Lindor truffle.

Love this fudge!  I was looking for easy no-bake recipes to get more coconut oil into my diet and this is perfect.  I made a variety batch and added walnuts to part, unsweetened coconut to part and made some peanut butter cups and they are all delicious.  I did not have honey so used imitation honey, splenda and stevia cocoa extract to sweeten.  Thanks for posting, so glad I found this healthy "fudge" recipe and know it will help me eat enough coconut oil for weight loss and other benefits!

I am grateful for the inspiration this recipe evoked, it is super simple and healthy but it requires adjustment to suit my taste.  I found it too waxy and not sweet enough.  I will be working on a version that works for me.

Mine turned out AMAZING! you have to use good quality coconut oil. I also added coconut flakes for texture. My kids couldn't believe I was serving them fudge. Studies show women who eat 1/4 c coconut oil a day have less belly fat. This is a great way to incorporate that.

I wish I could give it a 3.5 instead.  Maybe this is a new taste for me.... so I'm just not used to it.  It could grow on me.  It sets up  nicely..a bit softer than typical fudge and it couldn't get any easier!  However, it was oily rather than creamy.  I'm wondering if a version of this with some almond milk mixed in might do the trick.  I don't know.  I'd have to experiment.  I will try it again, though.

super easy and smooth.  I put shredded coconut in the 8x8 pan first, then nuked the fudge mixture and poured it on.  Then I sprinkled more shredded coconut on the top and put it in the fridge overnight and then cut it into squares.

Just discovered the health benefits of coconut oil and went on the search for different ways to incorporate it into my daily diet. THIS recipe is definitely going to be one of them. IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! and so very simple/easy to make. I have already shared it with several friends/family members after taking only a few bites! YUMMY!!! And thank you!

I don't feel like this is fudge. cocoa + sugar +fat = chocolate, not fudge. It made a tasty melt-in-your-mouth (and hands) chocolate but no fudge texture at all.

I like the overall taste, but it seems like the ingredients cooled in layers so it tastes a bit strange if you don't get the bite right (if that makes sense).  How did you form this into balls like the picture and then what did you roll them in?

I just recently learned the benefits of unrefined coconut oil and wanted to try this.
I used 1/2 the cocoa powder for a lighter flavor and a bit of vanilla as well. I can see adding in coconut flakes or chopped nuts. I warmed the oil slightly so it would blend easily and now I am eating it with a spoon.

Great receipe, I used coconut butter plus I was out of honey so I substituted it with agave nectar and we all loved it.  Easy and delicious.
