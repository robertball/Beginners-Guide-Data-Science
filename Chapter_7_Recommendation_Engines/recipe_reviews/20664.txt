This was a yummy dip - and tasted even better the next day when all the flavors really had time to merge. I used low-fat sour cream and low-fat cream cheese. I bought plain cream cheese and added two chopped scallions to it instead of buying cream cheese with chives already in it. Next time i'd use a full 16-oz container of sour cream so the dip wouldn't be quite so salty. But it was very easy and tasty - i'd definitely make it again.

I made this dip for Christmas and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and use two packets of medium taco seasoning so the spiciness was just right. I then followed the original portions for my brother's birthday but used only half a packet of the medium taco seasoning because he had thought it was too spicy but I personally thought it lacked zing.

I have been making Mexican layered dip for years and years with many compliments. This is just as good and is much less work!The only change I made was to add 2 finly chopped jalapeno peppers. This added a nice zing and crunch. I also added an extra layer of cheese. It was our contribution to a Labor Day cookout and was a big hit! Goes great with drinks before dinner! Addicting!

Delicious! Our local grocery store did not have chive and onion cream cheese so I added freeze dried chives and onion powder to plain cream cheese. I also topped with chopped avocado along with the tomato and green onion. Turned out great.

This was excellent - I did add about 1/2 cup of medium chunky salsa and rather than the green onions I added chopped black olives.

Easy easy easy. If you are in a hurry but want a fine tasting appetizer that has great eye appeal look no further. This dip looks better than it tastes but still tastes great. I would have given it a 3.5 on taste but it gets a four since rating in halves isn't permitted. We had this with tortilla chips and tacos tonight.

The biggest hit ever! Sometimes if I don't have the toppings I've put sliced jalapenos from a can on top for decorative purposes mostly but they add zing to the dip too.

This is a good easy recipe if you're in a hurry. I didn't have taco seasoning so I used chili powder and a little hot sauce to give it some spice. I think this would also be good with a layer of refried beans at the bottom.

This is a great recipe. I've gone one step farther and added shredded lettuce first and black olives on the top.

You can also do this recipe in an oven safe dish and throw it in the oven for about 5-10 minutes.

Loved it- so quick & it's just the right texture. The green onions plus tomatoes give it a refreshing taste. next time I might add a bit more taco seasoning or a dash of some kind of spice but I still love it as called for.

My family loved it! I ended up using 1-1/2 cups each sour cream and cream cheese because the taco seasoning I had was a bit too spicy for some.
