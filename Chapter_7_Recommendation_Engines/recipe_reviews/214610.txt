Honestly, I'm not crazy about crock pot recipes, but this is one I most likely will make again.  The shredded meat remained tough after 7 hours on high, so I cooked it another 1-1/2 hours.  IMO the tomato flavor really dominates the sauce, almost overpowering the flavor of the beef.  I think some fresh chopped garlic and maybe even a little soy sauce would add some tang to this.  Served on AR's Hamburger Buns along with cole slaw and baked beans.  Overall, a solid crock pot recipe.

this was REALLY good!!  About 3/4 way through the cooking time I took the steak out to chop it and almost threw it out, the sauce looked so watery and lacked flavor.  but i went ahead and chopped the meat up and let it cook another hour and a half.  so glad i did because it ended up being delicious.  DH loved it.  Only thing I did different was double the tomato paste, because i had a can and didn't want to waste it.  also added an extra tablespoon of sugar to balance out the extra paste.  Would have rather had it over noodles or rice instead of sandwiches, but that's personal preference and i will make it that way next time.  thanks for sharing.

I tried this last night and it had great flavor.  I did shred the meat and let it warm for about an hour before serving.  The only other change I would make is taking the steak out, slicing it and then shredding.  It was a little hard to eat but again, the flavor was very good.

We enjoyed this method for making a good flank steak BBQ sandiwch.  While the sauce base was fairly good, it was too tomato-y, so I tweaked it based on my sloppy joe sauce recipe.  I started with half of the recipe, as there are just 2 of us.  So I halved the sauce ingredients and then added and additional 1-1/2 T cider vinegar, 1 T brown sugar, 1/2 T. worcestershire, 1 T yellow mustard, 1 T soy sauce, 1/4 C ketchup, and liquid smoke to taste.  I cooked on high for 4 hours.  The meat was very tender and shredded beautifully! I added it back to the crockpot and cooked on low another hour.  It was melt in your mouth excellent!  I will make again with my additions...it made for a great BBQ sammy!

I used a meat mallet to tenderize the steak and didnt have a problem shredding it right in the crockpot for those of you who have had issues with this you MUST beat the steak with a meat mallet-it makes all the difference with flank steak,delicious.

Excellent recipe. Next time I'll increase the amount of steak in comparison to the sauce; otherwise came out perfectly!

I liked this using a beef flank steak instead of pulled pork.

I really liked the taste and the presentation....we usually eat our sloppy "whatevers" open faced. Only change I made was to drain most of the liquid out of the tomato sauce into a container (which I saved in case I needed to thin the conents of the slow cooker)...next time I might skip the tomato sauce & add more tomato paste. I did add about 1/4-1/3 cup Dr Pepper (made with sugar) & a good splash of pepperoncini juice (from a jar of pickled pepperoncini) as I like the bite & the little bit of heat.

I cut a flank steak in half to make this recipe as one of our entrées and 'Flank Steak a la Willyboy' from AR as our second entrée.  This was good but really, really saucy.  At the 4 hour mark, I shredded the meat and put it back in the sauce.  The flavor was good and the meat did shred beautifully.  It was served on mini ciabatta buns along with 'Best Potatoes You'll Ever Taste' and 'Greek Yogurt Coleslaw' from AR.

Made a very satisfying meal - with a few tweaks of my own, naturally. We didn't have the Steak Seasoning on hand, so I substituted it with Trader Joe's Coffee and Garlic BBQ rub. Slightly reduced the sugar to 3 TBPS and upped the Cider Vinegar to 1/4 cup for both health and personal tastes. When I added the contents to my slow cooker, I was a little worried that the meat was going to dry out, so I put in half a can (6 oz) of light beer.  Also, definitely shred at least an hour before serving and leaving it in the cooker for 5 hours surely helped!
