I tried entering another message about this recipe, but it didn't work.  I'm the submitter.  I've found that the reason people are having problems with the oil step is that they're putting entirely too much oil on each potato.  I did the same thing last year....yikes!  

YOu can omit the oil and foil step, and just bake noramlly.  Microwaving is fine, too, but check on them periodically so you don't over cook them.

Also, the recipe should call for 1/3 to 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  If you like it sweet, at 1/2 cup.  Otherwise, leave it at 1/3 cup.  

We normally love marshmallows on our sweet potatoes, but we don't on this recipe because of all the other wonderful flavors.  The marshmallows were overkill for us.  

Anyway, thanks for all the great suggestions and tips.  I've tried a few myself, and while they're good, we prefer my original recipe (minus the oil step just because it really is time consuming to do that).  

Also, one more tip...leave enough flesh in the skins so they retain their shapes and are easier to work with.  Removing too much flesh will leave you with a casserole in a dish!  :-)

Wow! What a surprise! Really rich and filling -- and really tasty. I have two suggestions. 1) Cut back on the brown sugar a little bit. As is, it's a bit too much like dessert to compliment other menu items. 2) IMPORTANT: When scooping out the flesh from the skins, leave a little bit of the potatoe flesh there to retain the shape of the skin. I found that tracing with the spoon an oval shape of the flesh to be removed was an easy way to do this. Then I just scooped out what I'd traced out. Regarding foil or no foil, I've tried both. I think using foil is a bit better, as the skins don't risk burning at all. I do not use oil in either case. Great and surprising recipe! Walnuts are a great addition.

This recipe is very good. My husband and I both liked it very much. I had a small problem with the cooking time, though. An hour at 400 or 425 would have been perfect but at 350 degrees the skins were too soft to restuff properly and they weren't even close to being done after an hour (when the rest of my dinner was ready to be eaten).

OK, it's the day after Thanksgiving and you need to know these were the talk of the meal. More than one person told me these were the best sweet potatoes they ever had!  My changes: Cooked at 400 for 1 hour, no oil, no foil. Be sure to keep a rim of potato in the skin to keep it's shape.  I also added 2 TB of lemon juice, 1 TB pumpkin pie spice, changed the walnuts to pecans & topped with marshmallows.  I have been asked to bring this again for Christmas.  Thanks Shannon great find :)

I was assigned "sweet potatoes" this Thanksgiving and chose this recipe.  I am not a huge sweet potatoes fan, but this dish was a hit at the dinner and I even liked it.  But I did follow the advice of the other review and baked the potatoes at 425 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Who are they kidding with the oiled skins?? Big disappointment!  They were MUCH too soft to stuff (as we thought they might be when the recipe said to oil and wrap with foil).  The filling is yummy but NO oil and NO foil!

Me again...the sumbitter.  I was in a pinch this year and I wasn't going to have time to prepare this for tomorrow like I wanted, so I used canned sweet potatoes. I can't believe I admitted that.  It wasn't as good as fresh, but it worked out just fine, and still tastes pretty good.  I used the same ingredients, mixed with a blender, folded in the nuts, now all I have to do is heat it up for tomorrow.  I really prefer fresh, but if you're in a hurry and still want this recipe, canned sweet potatoes (good brand) worked out ok!

I made this recipe last year and received rave reviews!  Even the 'non-sweet potato' folks enjoyed it.  I did cut back on the cream cheese and brown sugar just a little, and found the flavor perfect. The nuts and vanilla add such a wonderful touch, it makes you wonder why you never tried that combo before! This year, it's the dish that everyone has requested again!  Thanks a bunch to Shannon for this recipe, you've made me the sweet potato queen in my family! lol

This was great, but I ended up putting the mashed filling into ramekins and toasting marshmallows under the broiler.  The skins were too soft to stuff, but absolutely delicious one way or the other.

This is a great idea; sounded so perfect.  However, it has the blandest taste I have ever tasted.  I had initially added more brown suger in hopes it would help; however, that is not the answer.  I am on my own to come up with turning this into a very tasty Sweet Potato dish; my family would NOT eat it the way it is; YUK!

Oh. My. GOSH!  Shut the front door, these are GREAT!  I followed the advice about skipping the oil and foil and ended up just doing it as a casserole because it was SO much easier (I think the submitter posted that at some point if I remember reading it correctly), and it was so rich and creamy!  I completely disagree with the people saying it's too sweet. I guess everyone's tastes are different.  It was a great blend of sweet & savory.  I loved the cracked black pepper in mine, and I think all the ingredients went well together, and you still got a great sweet potato flavor!  This will be on our menu regularly.  In fact, I can see my self just making one potato at a time, any time I feel like it.  YUM!  Other restaurants need to adopt this recipe instead of their traditional sweet potato with butter and brown sugar or butter and cinnamon and sugar.  These are SLAP YOUR MOMMA GOOD!!

Lost my recipe very similar to this one so will post this to my recipe box.  The other recipe did not have the oil or foil step but essentially the same otherwise. The recipe as written a definite 5.  I had to sub SPLENDA sugars and imitation honey for diabetic hubby and have subbed pecans or macadamias when walnuts not available.  Being a lazy cook, I microwave the sweet potatoes and then follow the recipe from there.

W O W...!!!!  These are eye rolling GREAT!!! After I scooped out the "pulp" I deep fried the skins for about 30 seconds or so and then followed recipe exactly. I made these at Thanksgiving and nobody wanted to move on to the next dish. All the people that said the weren't big fans of yams LOVED them!!!

This is a great recipe! I made these for a dinner party and they got rave reviews. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and probably will increase to 1/2 tsp next time. I left the foil on the potatoes when serving as the skins were very soft and the potatoes probably would have fallen apart. I only took a thin slice off the top of each potato rather than cutting them in half. I stuffed 6 whole potatoes rather than 12 half potatoes. I will definitely make this recipe often.

Very good, tried this recipe and found it to be  delicous. Substituted the brown sugar for Splenda Brown Sugar, and used less than 1/3 cup that recipe calls for. Still was sweet and tasty.

Very good.  Because many of my family do not like sweet potatoes, I chose to freeze them in cup cake pans/with liners.  I can just stick one in the microwave in a custard cup or ramekin.

These were very good. I will make them again. I cut the potatoes in half length wise and baked on cut side down on a foil lined baking sheet for 30 mins. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and added cinnamon and more brown sugar.

Really good. I scaled this recipe down to make 2 servings. I really liked that it is not overwhelmingly sweet - the taste of the sweet potato still shines through. If (like my husband)you miss the marshmallows, you could pop a large one on top of each serving at the end of cooking time, and place under broiler for a minute. Also, you  could simply put the mixture into a 13x9 pan and bake until heated thru for a "casserole" version, but I really like the "twice baked" presentation for a change of pace. Very creamy and delicious, and easy to make! We'll definitely have these again.

This would be fine to just do as a casserole. I read the first comment from the person who submitted the recipe. I think it should just be a casserole in an 8x8 baking dish. But I'd do pecans(not walnuts) and mix 2T melted butter with 1/4 c brown sugar and pour that over the top, then top off with the pecans and bake 15 minutes. The flavor was exceptional.

The Best!!  And they can be prepared in no time.  I put 2 med. sized potatoes in the micro and set it on high for 8.  During that time I combined everything else.  The potatoes were cooked to perfection after 8 min.(lucky on first try-but remember that every micro is different). Just mixed them into the cream cheese mixture and stuffed them back.  They were ready to serve immediately without putting them in the oven.  Do NOT use oil - would not have been able to save the skins if I had and we love eating those skins!  Oh-those 2 potatoes served just the two of us.  Glad we didn't have to share!!  These can definitely be made ahead of time and put in the oven to heat through when your meal is almost ready in the oven.  Thanks submitter - will make this again and again!

Sweet!  These things are yummy but MESSY to prepare.  My daughter is 6 mo. old and LOVED this stuff.  And the adults were just a big of fans.  Make sure you don't scoop out allll the guts, it's easy to do because the skin peels off clean because you will be left with the potatoes laying on a sad empty skin-- not attractive and kind of reminds me of Kathy Griffin.

These were very yummy and a nice break from candied yams.  My husband who does not eat sweet potatoes ate one and loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I had eaten twice baked sweet potatoes at a restaurant and loved them, so I thought I'd try to make them for dinner with guests. I found this recipe and since I had all the ingredients on hand, decided to use it. This was absolutely delicious! The vanilla is what makes it so good, I think. Unfortunately I was unable to serve them as twice baked, entirely my fault as I overcooked the potatoes. Experience told me cooking 6 sweet potatoes at 350 degrees wouldn't get done in the time alloted. I cooked them at 425 but left them in too long, which is not a problem for the inside but definitely a problem if you want to use the skins. Skins just fell apart, so I decided to use this recipe and make mashed sweet potatoes, mixing the other ingredients into them. Fabulous! I will make this again, it's easy and got rave reviews! Thank you for sharing this one!

Oh my gosh. This is incredible. I didn't have any vanilla, but they STILL tasted fabulous. I think I'm going to make myself sick on these this winter ...

I had 10 huge sweet potatos total (which probably = 12 reg sized sw. potatos), I doubled everything except the br. sugar and cr. cheese (as others suggested) and it was very tasty!  My father in law who is a big sw. potato fan served  w/ just butter LOVED it.  Only change ~ I threw in a pinch of real cinnamon powder and did not restuff potatos (baked in a casserole dish).  This is a keeper thanks!!!

This is so great! I've made it for three T.givings now and get lots of compliments!I dont make it in the same way though, I found it too time consuming to make into boats, so I cook the sweet potatoes (skinless) in the oven then mash them in w/ the other ingedients and then put back in oven for a few min. to heat.I also used soy cream cheese instead and it was GREAT!

I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave in a potato sack, scooped out the insides and mixed ingredients together, then finished them out in the oven on 400 for 5-6 minutes. Everyone enjoyed them! Thanks so much!

I never liked sweet potatoes as a child...my mother always smothered them with marshmallows.  This, recipe is fan-tabulous.  After trying it the first time, as written, I added cinnamon to taste... for me, perfection.  And what's more important, the boss (wife) approved.  Many thanks to you SDELATORE for a real keeper.

I love these sweet potatoes.  I made as stated the first time, but now I reduce the cream cheese and brown sugar by at least half.  The tablespoon of vanilla scared me, but I think it is what makes them so special.

fantastic -You can cut back on the sugar a bit if you prefer them not as sweet. Don't bother with the salad oil or the oven - just bake then in the microwave. I didn't use pepper or the walnuts - rather I topped with candied pecans. Loved it and I've officially been assigned to sweet potatoes every Thanksgiving.

First, I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and it came up with 1 1/2 potatoes. So instead I made 3 potatoes and used the ingredients that it scaled to for 1 1/2. The results were just right as no one in my house likes real sugery sweet potatoes. The flavors were just right.I used the foil and folded it down around the potato like a boat and it made it easier to scoop it out and fill it.Just a little helper

I made some slight changes to the recipe.  I didnt use any oil just wrapped the potatoes in foil and cooked along side a meatloaf I made.  I didnt have any walnuts so left those out.  Was really good.  Reminded me of the sweet potato casserole I make at thanksgiving. Will make again!

I took these to work for our Thanksgiving feast and everyone loved them. I made a big batch and didn't take any home with me! Like other reviewers, I didn't bother with the oil and foil for baking. I used real butter, not margarine. Cut back just a tad on the sugar and vanilla, only because I knew my sweet potatoes were really sweet on their own. Great recipe - people were asking for it!

yummy! I didn't have any walnuts and I used labne (kefir cheese) in place of cream cheese because they have a similar flavor. I sprinkled a little extra brown sugar on top before the 2nd baking. garnished with ground cinnamon and honey.

This was wonderful! I made a few changes - left out the pepper (as suggested by another review), used pecans instead of walnuts, and baked it as a casserole. I happened to have some fruit dip (cream cheese and marshmallow cream) in the fridge and used it in place of the plain cream cheese. This just added to the incredible richness of the dish. Even my picky husband who typically likes things 'easy and plain' loved it, especially the nut topping. Thanks again for sharing.

I tried this for my family at Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the whole dinner.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little concerned about it being too sweet.  I used 8 sweet potatoes instead of 6 and left the amounts of the other ingredients the same.  It was fantastic!  Everyone said it was like having dessert with dinner.  Any leftovers I had of this were requested for everyone's doggie bags.  This will become a new staple in my holiday recipe box.

Thank you Shannon for sharing this!

I don't usually submit ratings, but I just had to let everyone know how good this recipe is. It got rave reviews from everyone at Thanksgiving yesterday!  I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to fold in the walnuts, so I sprinkled them on top which looked really nice. I learned not to scoop the potato completely out of the skin. Leave a small border in order to keep the skins from being too floppy. When you refill the skins, it is easy to reshape them. I will definately make this again!

Great, I made these when my in-laws came to visit and they loved them too!  I do think that its not necessary to return the mixture to the potato skins and will probably just bake the mixture in a small baking dish next time.

I tried 4 diff recipes, this one came in 2nd. Though it made the potatoes very creamy, I still felt the weight of the cream cheese with an already dense potatoe was a bit too much but if I didn't have my winning ingredient I would substitute easily.

This was my first time making twice baked sweet potatoes and this looked like as good a recipe as any, especially b/c of the reviews... but i didn't really like these -- they are really sweet/rich and have more of a dessert-like feel. If I were to make these again, I would cut down the amount of cream cheese, probably by half. I would up the amount of spices. I also agree with many of the other reviews that you should not use the oil or foil.

These were good however next time I will use 4 oz cream cheese instead of 8. Way too much in my opinion. I also did no oil no foil. I was cooking a ham at the same time so I did the potatoes on the oven rack at 275 for 2 hrs with the ham and then at 400 for 30 min to crisp up the skins.

Variations to make these even MORE fabulous--I didn't have walnuts and so added a few more flavors in so it wouldn't get boring.  Added a healthy tablespoon of spicy brown mustard, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a couple dashes of red curry powder.  I used 1/3 c brown sugar, not the 1/2 c for the sweeter version.  They were incredible.  We ate these as a main course (1 whole potato per person) with a big salad--great family dinner.

These were delicious! I left out the walnuts (personal preference) but otherwise made as directed and even my picky 2 year-old loved them. Will definitely be making again, but probably won't oil the skins before baking because they came out a little too fragile.

SO good! I didn't add any oil and put quite a bunch of brown sugar in them. Delectable. Thank you for this recipe, I will be using it again! Although not everyone has quite as much of a sweet tooth as I do, so I'll have to add less sugar. :)

My husband and I loved this. The kids didn't try it but that was expected. I have my favorite sweet potato casserole dish that I have at Thanksgiving and Christmas that is really sweet but have wanted one to have with an everyday meal. We had one yam and I rubbed the outside with oil and butter and then sprinkled kosher salt on the outside and cooked it in the oven per instructions. The skin DID fall apart but I didn't care since it was just us and I mixed (and I didn't measure anthing)everything else together and just spooned it on top of the broken skin and put it in the oven for 5-10 minutes and it was really good with our grilled chicken breast and steak. It was just slightly sweet so it didn't overpower the rest of the dinner. Loved the cream cheese in it and made it creamy and rich but didn't taste it. Thank you!! I'll be making this often!!

This was very good and easy to make.  I took others' recommendations and cut back a little on the brown sugar, which I'm glad I did.  I baked the potatoes at 425º for 1 hr. and 15 mins. and they were a bit softer than I would have liked.  One hour should have sufficed.  Also, next time I would take another reviewer's recommendation of  increasing the amount of sweet potatoes.  This verges on being a dessert and more of a sweet potato taste would have been better.  Overall really good.

What a treat! Thanks for the delicious recipe. I wanted to add per another reviewers comments, that yes, the skins do end up getting really soft (mine actually just about laid flat when I scooped out the flesh) but once you spoon the mixture back into the shell, it adheres and you can mold it back into shape.

Everyone really liked these at Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of mixing the walnuts in, I sprinkled them on top along with brown sugar, coconut, cinnamon and graham cracker crumbs, then re-baked for 5 mins.

Excellent idea! I used only 2-3 oz. cream cheese and no milk, and also added dashes of nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, and ginger. YUMMY, and a great alternative to traditionally super-sugary sweet potato dishes.

This recipe was excellent, even my picky husband liked it. I did however add a little cinnamon to it.  Also, I peeled, boiled and then mashed the potatoes and added the ingredients the recipe called for instead of scooping out and baking again.  Much quicker this way.  Will make many times over

This recipe was rather tasty, however, i did not make it with the walnuts because of allergy and i sprinkled a little extra brown sugar on the top.  Definately a keeper.

Got rave reviews! We did make a few changes:
--Microwaved the potatoes, due to lack of time. Turned out great, actually (used the "Potato" setting on my micro, plus a few extra minutes for the really big sweet potatoes). Cooked them in 2 batches.
--Added generous amount of cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg.
--Added handful more of brown sugar.
--Used melted butter, largely due to microwave accident and forgetful cook!
--Whipped everything up with a hand mixer

Came out wonderfully.

I am sure these would have been delicious, had they turned out.  I could not get the sweet potato out of the skin without ripping and tearing it.  They did not turn out as sweet potato skins but rather as glorified mashed potatoes.

The filling is very good.  The skins are much too weak to hold the filling so next time I would put it in a casserole.

I skipped the oil step, and since I didnt have cream cheese, I used plain greek yogurt instead. I also skipped the salt and pepper, and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also used cinnamon too. Then once everything was mixed back up and put in the shells, I sprinkled a pinch of brown sugar and cinnamon on top of it again and then baked for 5 minutes. Tasted like pumpkin pie!

I made this for the 3rd time tonight. I always follow the recipe exact - minus the oil and it's great! (I have even added marshmellows to the final cooking time and got rave reviews!) Tonight I didn't have the use of my oven (was making a standing rib roast) so I boiled the potatoes and using the same ingredients made these into mashed pot! They were fantastic! You can't go wrong!

I changed this to a savory recipe and it was amazing.  I was just cooking for two, so one sweet potato, 2 T cream cheese, salt and pepper to taste and grated Parmesan cheese sprinkled on the top.  Also, I baked my potato at 375 for 40 minutes, and then left a shell of about a quarter inch around the skin to keep the skin from being too flimsy.

Not a good recipe at all.  First of all, 1 hour @ 350 in the oven is not enough - the potatoes came out hard as a rock.  We didn't care for the flavor of the ingredients either....tasted more like a dessert than a side dish.  Very disappointed in this recipe.  Will not make again.

I was doing a trial run for this year's Thanksgiving and saw this recipe.   I loved the idea.   I just changed a few things.   While the potatoes were baking (w/o the oil but in foil - I didn't want the fire department to make a call) I took the same amount of unsalted butter and sauted finely chopped, peeled apple and cinnamon until the apples were soft but not falling apart;  Cooled the apples & butter and followed the recipe as suggested.  I switched out the walnuts for pecans as I did not have walnuts on hand.  Because I had the apple in the sweet potatoe mixture I sprinkled chopped pecans on top!   Beautiful presentation but very rich and filling.  I think it will be a hit with the vegetarians at my table!   Happy Thanksgiving!

Very Very Good. I mixed it with a blender before putting the walnuts in. The only thing I would change is no oil and crank up the heat to 375. The skin was way to soft even with using a small amount of oil

This sounded like a good idea, but made according to the recipe there is WAY too much cream cheese.  It totally covers the sweet potato taste.  We each took two bites max.  Maybe 1/3 of the cream cheese would be good, but I probably won't bother to find out.  I'll go back to my Williamsburg casserole with marshmallows that the whole family likes.

3.5 stars, really. I ended up serving in a casserole dish because the skins were too soft to put the filling in and bake again. Overall, flavors were all great together and it was a nice side dish for our Easter ham dinner.

I baked the potatoes and then scooped them out and just put all the ingredients into a 2 qt square casserole dish. This was really rich, and I think I prefer a sweet potato casserole with a sugary crust on top. It was still pretty yummy though.

I loved these!! I made them with my Christmas Eve dinner. I had a hard time putting the mixture back into the skin but I think that was because of the way I had cut them off. I did add a little cinnamon to the mixture. Loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I definitely didn't succeed at stuffing the skins, they were too soft, but I made a nice sweet potato casserole on a bed of potato skins...

I added a little extra spice to it--some cinnamon, nutmeg, a touch of cayenne (it was really great with just that hint of a bite to it).  I also used about 1/2 the vanilla called for, and it was still a really strong flavor--but I use high quality real vanilla extract, not imitation, so that's not incredibly surprising.

The texture of this is fantastic--the cream cheese really makes it.

This was an easy way to make sugared sweet potatoes.  I would give it five stars, but it was too sweet for me.  I also think that next time I would use a different cheese other than cream cheese.  I've had sweet potatoes with cheddar and it doesn't take away any of the natural sweetness of the potato.  I will do this again, but I will be tweeking it for better results.

I've made this twice now with excellent results both times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly....yum!  The second time, I intended to follow the recipe again but my grocery store had some very strangely shaped sweet potatoes.  I used yams instead.  Again, wonderful.  A little sweeter, but still delicious.  Also, the skins were a little more difficult to work with.  I will make this again and again, I'm sure!

I didn't oil or wrap the potatoes in foil because from experience I knew the skins would be more difficult to fill without breaking them.  These are good and quite rich and yet I am considering adding pumpkin pie spice when I make them again.

I was in a rush so once the potatoes were cooked I did not put the filling back in the skin I put all in a casserole dish, left out the salt and pepper and added one teaspoon orange extract and half teaspoon nutmeg and toasted pecans on top.

Delicious recipe, and I'm not even a sweet potatoes fan!  I omitted the oil and just popped them in the microwave instead of baking.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg.

I omitted the oil and foil step.  I also did not add walnuts.  I baked at 425 for 1 hour 15 min and still had to microwave them for about 5 minutes to get them soft enough.  My husband and I really like this recipe and I will make it again.

Absolutely delicious! This is a keeper. The potatoes were not cooked in a hour so I turned up the heat a bit & put a metal knife in each one. This sped up the baking process. After another 20 minutes they were ready. I found this to be a super easy recipe. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese & it turned out great. The walnuts add an interesting contrast in texture. We liked them. My husband loved these but found them a tad bit too sweet- so I'll probably decrease the brown sugar a bit next time.

Loved it! I may have put too much cream cheese because it tastes a bit like cheesecake... but that’s not a complaint

What do you mean by 6 sweet potatoes?  These come in various sizes as you know.  Giving a weight would be much more helpful.

I made this today just as written except for no walnuts and turning the oven to 400.  It's rich and really good!   Even my picky husband liked it.  It is a recipe I will use again!

These tasted alright, but I think they need a little spice or added  flavour.  Perhaps the exchange of margarine/butter for a small shot of a vinegar would be better.

I cooked a spiral sliced ham, old style green bean casserole,  flaky  biscuits,  and these potatoes.  The dinner was excellent, but  6 diners thought the sweet potatoes were awesome!  They will become a family favorite.

I would make it again, changes I wouldn't cut in half but scoop it out like a bowl. I also should have mixed it smoother, it was a little chunky. Lastly I used less sugar and it still was very tasty.

These were awesome. It was just my husband and I so I cut the recipe in half. Are used to really large sweet potatoes and half of the recipe for the stuffing and it turned out perfect! My husband absolutely loved it! So did I! We had roasted chicken from a recipe on here along with carrots that I had in with the chicken. It was a perfect meal.

I have made this once, and am currently cooking the potatoes for a second time. I just stuck the potatoes in the oven- no oil or foil. It was so good last time!! Will prepare them the same way tonight.

I did omit the cream cheese due to family allergies, but I can't imagine it made a difference. This was hands down the winner of the meal this Easter. I dislike sweet potatoes and even I couldn't wait to eat it. Definitely a keeper.

Don't bother with oil or foil. I used 3 good sized sweet potatoes and baked for 1 hour at 400 I used half recipe for filling and split them down the middle and spread the filling inside and baked for 5 more min at 350 awesome

After reading the reviews, I didn’t bother with the vegetable oil and wrapping them in aluminum foil which worked out perfectly.  These are very creamy, and not too sweet.

I make twice baked potatoes quite frequently. So I was intrigued to try these. I am happy I followed several recommendations no oil no foil no vanilla. No salt and pepper. I used pumpkin pie spice turned out yummy. Will make again. Froze leftovers. To make make later

Followed the recipe and my potato skins came out too soggy to make these "twice baked." Ended up with mashed sweet potatoes instead. They were pretty good - didn't have cream cheese so used heavy cream in its place, omitted the butter and added a bit of pumpkin spice.

I had a bite of this dish and it's not even finished but it's already tasting delicious.  I started with a sweet potato that weighed in at more than 2 1/2 lbs, baked as instructed, cut into thirds and then halves.  Scooped out the flesh, whipped it up with the listed ingredients plus 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1/3 - 1/2 cups of miniature marshmallows.  I did omit the black pepper -it just didn't sound right in this mix. OOooeee, the filling is decadent and I can hardly wait to serve them up with tomorrows Thanksgiving dinner.   YUM!

I made these last night for dinner along with pork tenderloin as the main dish. My husband thought they were pretty good, but I thought they were way too sweet and rich. I am sure they would suit some people's tastes well, but I couldn't take more than three bites. Not a complete failure as a side dish, but I probably won't make these again.

This is so good and easy!  I did not use the oil and made the potatoes in the microwave.  I did add a few marshmallows to the top which gave it a nice garnish.  Will make them again for sure!!!

This sounded wonderful but just didn't do it for us.  I'll stick with marshmallows, cinnamon, etc.

This is basically cream cheese frosting mixed with sweet potatoes... it was REALLY rich.  Too rich for my family.  It tastes more like a pie than a dinner side.  And the taste is ok, but it's not that great. It masks the taste of the sweet potato, which is unfortunate. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Yum!  My whole family loved this one.  My grown son says, "This is a keeper!"  He insists I save the recipe for him.  I don't think I changed up the recipe much except I used less brown sugar and vanilla.  I didn't add any cinnamon because I feel it covers up the flavor of the potato too much.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I forgot the nuts, and scooped to much flesh from the skins.  It still was delicious in a casserole dish.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe except for the oiling of the skins (based on reviews, didn't seem to add anything but work) I found the flavor to be good, however filling was mushier than what I was looking for.  I think it is due to the soft nature of the sweet potato.  None the less they were all eaten and got good reviews.

In the midst of Thanksgiving preparation, I forgot to add the brown sugar; however, before I popped them in the oven, I sprinkled brown sugar on the tops.  My sister, who dislikes sweet potatoes, loved them.  I thought that the vanilla was a bit overpowering, but maybe it would have been offset with the brown sugar. Overall, good recipe... maybe next time I will decrease the amount of vanilla.

Really nice flavor.  I made mashed the potatoes, skipped the sugar & nuts entirely, and halved the vanilla based on complaints that it was too strong.

We liked these real well except they were a little hot, especially for the kiddos (and, I'm a Cajun who usually likes hot!).  Will make again, but without the red pepper.

After baking the potatoes I ended up just scooping out all of the potato and putting the filling into idividual souffle dishes sprinkling with cinnamon then baking.  A little swwet for my tastes, but my husband love it!

Wonderful recipe but not for dinner.  I like a baked sweet potato with steak but  not this one.  It is way too rich and sweet.  Tastes wonderfully decadent but for a desert not a side dish.  Will try next time just scooping out of skin and baking in a pie shell.  Heavenly.

As prepared it was a little too sweet for a side dish.  I'll make it again but use less sugar and vanilla.  However, it made a fabulous dessert!

These are wonderful! Did "test" for husband and self prior to doing for dinner party. Do like the inclusion of bit of lemon juice; cuts the sweetness. Only had granulated light brown sugar but I think maybe better; not overly sweet. Baked 2 potatoes on 425 for 1 hr; bit too soft; will try 400 next time. Did not use foil but did use small amount of olive oil; will omit oil on next try. Think baking in oven may yield better flavor than microwave; always oes w/regular baked potatoes. This dish a wonderful side dish with chicken. Thank you for this very tasty recipe!

My family loved this recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used the reviews for improvements.  I did use the oil on the skin; I think it really helped keep the skin from drying out while baking. Also, I think the key was the reviewer that said to make sure to leave enough of a rim around the border to hold the shape of the potato. I will definitely be making this again!

Pretty easy to do. I read some of the reviews and didn't wrap the potatoes in foil, just let them bake. It took about an hour at 425. I only had one peel that was a casualty, so I put the filling in a ramekin instead. Came out just as good. These were pretty simple, with a great taste.

The best recipe ever! Huge hit at Thanksgiving-- everyone complimented these! Nice recipe to please everyone from the marshmallow fans to the more reserved. I did not grease the potatoes, and did add the Tbs of pumpkin pie spice. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

These were really good. As it was only my husband and I this year, I didn't want to make a whole sweet potato casserole. I will make these again, although only for special occasions. I may use less cream cheese, and possibly add some cinnamon. These worked well for us because I didn't want a dish overly sweet with marshmallows, oj, etc.

This was my first Thanksgiving to contribute to since I am a newly wed. I should have listened to the people who cooked their potatoes in the microwave because it took my potatoes seriously 2 hours to bake. I was running so late at this point that I ended throwing out two because they still weren't soft enough to use. Everyone had to wait on me. I was so sick of them by the time to eat that I could only eat two bites. But everyone else seemed to really like them. They are also to nice to say that they didn't. Anyways too much work.

YUMMY! I skipped the oven method and went for the super easy microwave method to cook them.  Then I cut and scooped out the middle with no ripped skin..they were perfect.
I cut back a tad on the cream cheese and used butter instead of margarine.  I filled skins and topped with the walnuts.  Cooked 20 minutes in the oven and PERFECTO!!

i did omit the oil and foil... and it took FOREVER to cook. i put it in the microwave to finish, and it was still a little hard. we just at the little bit that was soft. i'm sure it would be good if it cooked longer... but i'm not messing with it again.

Sorry not a keeper in my household.  We like sweet potatoes but the cream cheese and vanilla took over the dish.  I through all of it away.
