I've made this meatloaf twice now. The first time I followed the recipe and only omitted the green bell pepper. Baked it in a loaf pan. It was dense and delicious and made fabulous sandwiches. My one complaint: it was a bit greasy...kind of cooked in it's own fat as it rendered out into the loaf pan.  The second time I made a few modifications. *Added: 1 tsp. garlic powder 1 tsp. Italian herb no-salt blend *Substituted: 1 lb. broken up ground beef pepper steaks for the ground beef and bell pepper *Cooking: I baked it in a loaf shape on a baking sheet lined with foil. It wasn't as dense, but it was plenty moist and wasn't as greasy. It also had a nice crust on it all the way around. I'll be baking it on a baking sheet from now on.  Overall: delicious meatloaf. :)

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a ketchup & brown sugar topping for the last 10 minutes of cook time.

I make a very similar meatloaf, only I add about 1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese to the meat mixture, and usually use French bread crumbs for a great Italian meatloaf.  Even my picky husband loves it!  I like the change of pace the cornbread makes, though.

After a long search I have found my "forever" meatloaf recipe.  Even my husband (a real hard case) pronounced it "excellent."  No tweaking needed.

This was really tasty and smelled delicious! I baked it in silicone muffin cups instead of a loaf pan, and used ground pork, no beef, and used fresh tomatoes. I cut the recipe in half and it made 12 "muffins." Wonderful served with mashed potatoes!

I'm not a big meatloaf fan, but this was pretty good!  I was concerned about so much salt since there is seasoning in the stuffing mix, but it was fine. I did use the whole package of stuffing mix (about 2 1/2 cups). Used garlic powder and some herbs from the pantry because I didn't have a garlic/herb blend.  Had to cook it a lot longer to get to 160 degrees, but I was using a large toaster oven.  Next time I will probably make 2 smaller loaves or meatloaf muffins for faster cooking.

I have made this meatloaf recipe several times and it always comes out perfect. It's the only recipe I will ever use. Leftovers are great for sandwiches...slice the meatloaf, put in on a baking sheet, top each slice with some marinara sauce and a slice of provolone. Heat in the oven until the meatloaf is warm and the cheese is melted. Serve on hoagie rolls. Yum! For those complaining about it being to greasy, it's the quality of the meat you are using..not the recipe. The only fat in the recipe comes from the meat. You shouldn't give the recipe a lesser rating because you fail to choose quality ingredients.

Brilliant!  Love this recipe, thank you! I like a little spice so I omited the bell pepper and added jalepeno.  The only thing my Husband could say after the first bite was "Mmmmmmmm".  Thanks again. :)

Very moist & tender, nice flavor. After mixing this up, I really expected it tp be very "bready"- It wasn't! I did replace the green pepper with green chillies, and replaced the ground pork with venison because I had it on hand. I also free-formed the loaf & cooked on a foil-lined baking sheet. Nice recipe - Thanks, MadMoMi!

I'm making this recipe for the second time tonight for supper.  I use Herb Seasoned stuffing instead of corn bread stuff and I use a can of seasoned tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes.  This is the best recipe for meatloaf I've found. Tonight I'm making a sauce for the top but it really doesn't need it. Either way is fine with me.

I make meatloaf because my husband loves it - I'm not at all a meatloaf fan. That said, this was awesome!

I made it according to the recipe, and it came out perfectly. The only change I would make in the future is to use petite diced tomatoes next time, since the larger diced tomatoes kept coming across as a weird texture change for me.

I'm getting ready to try the recipe and had a question. Has anyone tried using Jiffy cornbread mix instead of the stuffing mix? I wonder if I should make the cornbread first and then grind in food processor similar to what they say about the stuffing mix or would it be OK to just use the unprepared cornbread mix in place of the ground stuffing mix. Thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated

This is the best meatloaf ever. I dont use green peppers because I don't like them. It have made it without and without using the food processor step to grind the stuffing mix. I prefer it with the food processor because it blends in with the rest of the ingredients better. I have no problems  with it being greasy but I cook it in a double layer meatloaf pan so the grease drains out. It is delicious and flavorful and it is the only meatloaf recipe I use.

No one in my family cared for  this meatloaf.  Followed recipe as written.  Had a different texture probably due to the cornbread stuffing mix and the chunks of tomatoes even though I put the cornbread stuffing in the food processor and used petite diced tomatoes.  Was not for us.

Excellent flavor and texture.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.  The only thing I did different was I left out the green pepper because my husband doesn’t like them and I substituted the plain diced tomatoes for Italian style because I didn’t have garlic with herbs.  I’ve tried many meatloaf recipes and this is my favorite by far.
