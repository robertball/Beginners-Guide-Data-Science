This was delicious soup. I made this with leftover thanksgiving turkey so it was a snap. I made one pretty major modification to the recipe.. broth. This is soup.. there is NO broth or water listed. Without it, it would make sauced turkey. I made some stock with the leftover turkey carcass and use that.. You probably will need 10-12 cups of stock for a full recipe. This would have gotten 5 stars, except for the error.. which is missing from the personal recipe as well.

This was easy and good, but I put back in the hominy, I'm diabetic and that is a low fat low carbs food we can eat, but I am a large man and like somewhat diet dishes once in a while, I thank you, and and Shalom.

This was delicious, with the addition of a few cups of chicken broth. it was much too thick without it. we also added a dollop of sour cream on top.
