It’s a great recipe with adjustments!!  Otherwise it wouldn’t have received 5 stars. 
I took the advice and added 1Tbsp of water to the recipe.  It was still crumbly (dough pulling away from the chips) and when baked grainy in texture-ugh!  I added more water and reworked the dough.  Then the cookie had more of a cookie dough consistency and baked nicely.  The cookies spread and had a much better chewy texture!!!  I really liked the adjusted cookie recipe.  The combinations are endless
Here are my changes/recommendations:
     Devil’s food cake mix (with pudding in the mix),
     white chocolate chips,
     3 Tbsp water,
     baked at 350 for 10 minutes(not 7)

I made these for the UT VOLS / Fla Gator football game tonight. I truly didn't have high hopes for this recipe when I was mixing these up, the batter just didn't seem right. I added 1 TSP of water. I used devils food cake mix and white chocolate chunks and let me tell you - these are out of this world! To be  so easy these were very good! I think those that might not be getting good results might want to change cake mixes.  I used a mix that had pudding in it. Thanks for the post! I am going to try different variations for sure!

These are good if you add 2-3 T. of water to the dough..otherwise the dough doesn't spread at all when baked..my first batch of cookies w/o water had the same shape when they were done as they did when i put them it!  then i added 2 T. water and the rest of them were fine.  i used choc. cake mix with choc. chips and walnuts, the walnuts helped them not to be so sweet.

These cookies are fantastic. I used a devil's food cake mix and peanut butter chips, and carefully followed the 10 minute on-the-pan cooling time. The baking time was also about right for my oven. I highly recommend this recipe!

My husband came home from work and said that I needed to make cookies made with strawberry cake mix and white chocolate chips (of course he had no recipe). So I found this recipe and used stawberry cake mix and semi-sweet chocolate and white chocolate swirl chips. OMG!!! They are so good!! My husband says that they are better with just the white chocolate but I like these! I still have a batch in the oven now! I do have to cook them for almost 15 min to get them to the point that they don't fall apart when you pick them up. I will defiantly make these often!!! THANKS!

I followed the recipe exactly and did not find these cookies oily at all.  I did find the batter very crumbly and difficult to get on the cookie sheet.  I was trying to use a scoop to do this and had to reform the cookies after scooping out of the bowl.  Also, the cookies do not spread a lot.  I don't have an issue with that, if you like thin crisp cookies you should be warned.

I used a triple chocolate cake mix and Andes mint chips.  After making both this recipe and Cake Mix Cookies I, my husband decided he liked this recipe better.

Wow! These were fast, easy and a big hit.  I had rainbow chips in the cupboard but didn't know what to do with them.  I added them with french vanilla cake mix and this recipie turned out great.  (but a little on the sweet side)  My family devoured them.

I've been making this for years, in all kinds of flavors. I've used 2 eggs and 1/3 c oil and found that version too much like Archway cookies. I use 1 egg, 1/3 cup of oil (or melted butter), 2-3 tsp of water, and a little vanilla. I've made chocolate chip, chocolate peanutbutter chip, snickerdoodles and trying out red velvet peppermint tonight. This never fails and tastes far better than refrigerator dough or cookie mix. Faster than scratch.

My girls and I just made these and they were great! I always thought that cookies made with cake mix would be...well cakey. They were nothing like that. I used a butter cake mix and didn't have enough semi sweet chips so I mixed semi sweet and milk choc chips.  I left them in the oven for @ 9 min. They don't look done, but after they cool it's great. Thank you so much.

This was the worst recipe I've ever made.  The cookies tasted like grease balls. There is too much oil in them. I don't understand how it got such good reviews from others. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out awful.

I've made cake mix cookies before and didn't care for the 'cakey' taste. These, however, are amazing! I thought that the brown sugar might make them too sweet but it didn't. These are chewy and moist. I added walnuts for the second batch instead of the chips and they were just like brownies! For reference, I used BC Devil's Food and, instead of adding water like others' have suggested, I just dampened my hands when I rolled them into balls.
This one is definitely a keeper!

When you are looking for easy, quick and SWEET, these are just right.  For those of us who love fresh baked cookies, but really don't enjoy the measuring, mixing and time involved in baking from scratch, this recipe fits the bill.  I loved the creativity we were able to add to our cookie recipe.  We needed cookies for the annual Christmas Cookie swap we host at our house each year, and so we chose a white cake mix with cherry chips and red velvet cake mix with white chocolate chips for the festive colors.  They turned out delicious!  My recommendation is to use 2/3 cup of oil instead of 3/4 cup and add 3 T of water.  Let them sit on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes after they come out of the oven to set up.  Then transfer to a cooling rack and the won't break at all.  Unless someone is trying to grab it out of your hand, which is likely as tasty as they are.  Warning:  They are really SWEET--perfect for the occasional holiday treat.  But that's why they only get 4 stars from me.

I made 4 dozen cookies with a variation of this recipe. Of course the boxes of cake mix no longer come in the 18.25 ounce size, the manufacturers have reduced them to 16.5 ounces so I measured the additional cake mix out of a second box to get the 18.25 ounces that the recipe requires. I used yellow cake mix instead of chocolate because that's what I prefer but chocolate mix would have worked perfectly for those who prefer chocolate. I wasn't sure about only using one egg since I read the cake mix cookie recipes I - VIII and all of them called for two eggs except for this recipe. So, I decided to use two eggs. I prefer a true buttery taste so instead of  the 3/4 cup vegetable oil called for in the recipe I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup melted butter. Next, I added 1/4 cup light brown sugar. And finally, instead of 2 cups butterscotch chips I used 1/2 cup EACH butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, chopped pecans and flaked coconut. I did use a mixer and I rolled the cookie dough into balls about one inch in diameter then placed 12 on each cookie sheet and baked at 350°F for 11 minutes.  Follow the recipe from this point. THE COOKIES WERE DELICIOUS !  The great thing about this cake mix cookie recipe is you can change the flavor of the cake mix and mix and match the added ingredients to suit your taste. Try it. If it doesn't come out exactly as you like the first time, keep mixing and matching up different ingredients until you find the perfect cookie for you!

So simple. I used the holiday red/white and green/white striped chips in the chocolate mix. Very festive. Baked 8 minutes. Slid off the pan in 5 min. Did not need to leave on pan 10 min.

2 cups of chips is way too many.  I ought to have used just 1 cup. I had awful trouble trying to form the dough since all those chips made it crumbly.  Very sweet, too.  I don't think they need that extra 1/4 cup sugar.

This was a quick and very easy recipe for items that are found in most cupboards.  I used a devil's food cake mix and butterscotch chips and it turned out great.  No extra water needed.  I used a cookie scoop and flattened out the cookies a bit with my fingers.  Don't let them sit on the cookie sheet for more than 5 minutes or they will stick and may crack.

Add another egg and that should help matters greatly.  Any cake mix cookies (where the cake mix is 18.25 ounces) should have 2 eggs and 1/3 cup of oil - cannot see any sense in adding brown sugar!  If you have to mess around with adding water--why bother!!

Perfect cookies and so easy. Only got 30 cookies out of it and added a tbsp of water per reviews. Tried orange cake with chips swirled of white and dark chocolate. Unique taste but I'm just rating the recipe. Would like to try some other combos because the concept is fantastic.

These are definitely not the best cookie recipe ever, but I had these cookies in the oven within 5 minutes of finding the recipe. For a pregnant lady with a serious craving, they were perfect. I was weary of adding sugar to the cake mix, but I think the flavor was great. (I used a white cake mix, no chips.)

I wanted to make cookies, but didn't have much time or a lot of ingredients, so these were just what I needed. I wouldn't make them normally, but they will do in a pinch.

Delicious and sooo easy!  I did use my Kitchen Aid mixer.  The dough seemed a little oily but the cookies turned out great.  Endless combinations of cake mixes and add-ins.  My 5 year old and 2 year old loved helping to make these, and to eat them too!

This recipe worked great for me.  I needed a lot and didn't have two similar cake mixes so I used yellow and chocolate for a marbled effect. I must say that was difficult due to the consistancy of the dough. Added white and milk chocolate chips cause that's what I had. These were our favorite at the cookie exchange we took them to. Chilled overnight the dough was perfect to use with a cookie scoop.

I made these and the batter tasted good, but when I baked them they tasted really salty. My kids liked them, but they were too salty for me.

Great! The 1st batch came out a little crumbly, so I took a members advice and added 1 tablespoon of water and it made even better.

I didn't make any changes. They're definitely quick and easy, but taste too sugary and weird, like eating the cake mix right out of the box.

Used chocolate cake, and baked on the airbake cookie sheets.  Took 10 min. Have to let set 10 min or will fall apart.  OK if you want chocolate and something easy, but the homemade double chocolate cookie recipe from Hershey's is much better and tastier.

Amazing! I substituted melted butter instead of the oil and had no texture problems at all!

These were delicious....like others I added 2 tsp of water to moisten the mix.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of shredded coconut....to die for!

Stellar!  I thought the cookies would turn out cakey - what a wonderful surprise.  They are super easy and great when in a crunch for time.  They were crispy on the edges but soft inside.

I had white chocolate chips in the freezer, so I used those. I've had cake mix cookies before and didn't like them.. these I liked a lot. I did add a tiny bit of water.. maybe a tablespoon or two
