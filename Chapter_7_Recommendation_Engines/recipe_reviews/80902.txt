This recipe was amazing! Absolutely everyone that tasted it was impressed! I find that this cake goes best with whipped cream and rasberries but it can be quite nice plain.

This was very good. I just wasn't sure if it was supposed to be more of a pudding-like torte or if it was supposed to be actually cakey because the outer part of mine turned out like a normal albeit very rich cake with a crumb and everything but the middle was very gooey. I baked it for the indicated hour so I'm not sure if I should have left it longer or if I overbaked it.:) Perhaps I underbaked it as I had trouble removing the pan without pulling the cake apart a little.
