It is my recipe so of course I love it.  But they changed a few things when they published it.  Step one, when adding seasonings, add lemon zest, not juice. Plus, you need 6 pieces of pita for 6 servings.  Good condiments to serve along side are extra feta crumbles, chopped tomatoes, sliced black or kalamata olives.

The meat seasoning is perfect, like a gyros. It is important to note something about the sauce, though. Grocery-store yogurt, when blended, turns to liquid, which is what I forgot when making this. Far better to blend the feta and seasonings into a small bit of yogurt, then gently stir in the additional yogurt. This is wonderful served with sliced fresh onion in it, and a cucumber-tomato salad. ***Last note: This may be six servings, but it does not serve six people!! (Unless each person is fine with only about 3 tablespoons of meat!)  =)

My husband loved this. We didn't have pitas and are watching carbs so we just ate it without. It was very good. My husband kept talking about this on and off all night. He wanted to finish up the pan of it. We didn't have lamb so just used hamburger. Followed recipe as it was posted. Very good Will make again

Very good!  will certainly make again. I ended up putting the meat in the food processor just so it was a very fine grind and the flavor was excellent.  I even messed up and added the water all at once and it was still great.  Didn't change a thing.

I used turkey instead of the lamb, and tortilla shells instead of the pita bread.  The smell is delightful!  The meat mixture goes well with the yogurt-feta cheese sauce to create a wonderful tasting meal! Next time, we will try it with the lamb!

These were good, but not quite what I was hoping for.  If I make them again, I don't think I will use the olive oil when browning the lamb, as I think it made it kind of greasy.

Excellent recipe - used grass fed lamb and the recipe ingredients as described, but increased the herbs used by 50% (though that may be that a lot of our herbs and spices are several years old, thus not as pungent as especially fresh ones).   We loved it.   A great use of ground lamb.    We did not make the dressing but used a commercially marketed tzaziki instead and served on naan with the tzaziki.

Excellent!  This was both simple and surprisingly flavorful.  I've made it twice now - the first time I followed the recipe exactly as is, and it turned out beautifully.  The second time, I halved 3/4 of a cup of grape tomatoes and added them to the lamb mixture near the end of the cooking time (for about a minute), just before serving, with equally great results.   Definitely a keeper.

We'd never had lamb before and since we are adventurous eaters who enjoy trying new foods, we thought we'd give it a whirl. I went with this recipe because it sounded simple enough and it didn't have any negative ratings. I prepared them exactly as directed and served them with black olives and tomatoes as suggested. I don't know if it is the recipe or just the lamb, but we don't plan on eating this, or lamb, ever again.

Perfect as is!!  Good with ground Beef and Turkey.  I used a different type of Tzatziki Sauce but this one is good too!!
