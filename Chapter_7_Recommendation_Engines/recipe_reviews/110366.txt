This recipe rocks!  I had to make a couple changes to suit my family, so here's what I did --  The cucumber I bought at the store had a really bitter flavor (??? it looked fine!) so I substituted slices of avocado, instead.  Instead of tossing the dressing with the avocado, I just put it in a squirt bottle and drizzled it over the wrap once I had it assembled.  It was DELISH!  My picky family loved it, and I love that this dish can be customized any way you want.  I put out some of our favorite sushi condiments as well (pickled ginger, wasabi for the brave...) and everyone loved it.  I can totally see turning this into a fun party appetizer, by making pinwheels with the ingredients.  Sort of like sushi for those too chicken to try sushi!  I had no problem with canned salmon.  If you get a good quality salmon, it works just fine.  It would be fine with grilled salmon, as well.  Thanks for this recipe!  This is definitely going into frequent rotation at my house!

4 1/2 stars, actually.  Very nice blend of flavors - this is great when you don't feel like heating up the house with the oven and want something light and fresh.  A couple of things I'll do differently next time ~ I discovered that I dislike canned salmon, so I'd use either fresh or pieces of tuna steak or shrimp - I think the tuna and/or shrimp would work nicely here.  Secondly, I'd make more of the soy sauce mixture - Loved the taste and felt the wraps could have used more.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

Hmm, could be better.  Will try again with these changes: shredded daikon (very common in Japan), use fresh salmon (maybe even the salted kind), and toasted sesame seeds.  I thought overall the flavor was good, but the canned salmon turned me off.  I used toasted seeds because that's what I have on hand.  Since this is an asian inspired wrap, I found it odd being on a flour tortilla.  Next time I'll try wrapping it in lettuce.  It will highlight the flavors of everything else and be lower in calories.

I made several changes, but I kept the spirit of the recipe, and I really liked this. I used fresh salmon, which I baked with leftover homemade Pad Thai sauce; used brown rice and whole-wheat tortilla; grated the daikon and cuke; used chopped pickled ginger and more wasabi; toasted the sesame seeds; and mixed all ingredients (including the sauce) together. I added a sheet of nori on top of the tortilla, spooned in the mix, and rolled it all up--delish! I'd also serve this in a bibb/Boston lettuce leaf. Big bonus--not a lot of dishes to clean afterward!

I love this idea. I went a little crazy with it when I made it because I wanted it to fit with what I had at the time, but the results were fantastic--really light, but very filling. I julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and white onion. I sauted a little gai-lan in peanut oil. Heated the tortilla in the same oil and then proceeded to fry some 1/4 block of tofu (I didn't have any salmon). I layed the julienned veggies and tofu in the tortilla with some green onions (only the greens) split length-wise, pickled ginger, 1/2 sliced avocado, and Sriracha sauce. For the dressing I mixed a teaspoon of the juice from the pickled ginger with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, wasabi paste, sesame seeds, the diced whites from the green onions, and half a teaspoon of sugar. I spooned the dressing on to the insides before I wrapped it up. I had some left over veggies and dressing so I made a little side salad with it. It was a wonderful and easy lunch that I'll certainly make again. Next time I think I'll add some nori and try it with the salmon.

Great recipe - the flavors of sushi but quick and easy to make. I used fresh ginger, which added a lot of flavor.

This recipe was good and I will make it again. Be warned though it can turn out very salty. Next time I will use redused salt soy sauce and/or but salt free salmon. I also added chopped carrots in place of the radish and added honey. I made this in a flour tortilla wrap and added a slice of romaine lettuce. This turned out wonderfully.

I agree with the changes suggested below.. the canned salmon did not work for me. Tried it on lettuce and it was a little better though!

Really good. Used matchstick carrots instead of radishes.  Think I will use some sarachi sauce as well next time. One can salmon was enough for 2 tortillas

Didn't have green onions so I chopped up some sweet onion. I happened to have some cucumbers preserves in vinegar water which I used instead of fresh. I backed off on the rice vinegar just I bit, but I don't think I needed to. The sauce was great and not too strong. So it's okay to use a lot of it.

We loved this. We doubled the sauce and veggies and used sweet brown rice and "Flatout" wraps. Like the description says, the dressing and textures are a great combination. I used apple cider vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand. Our 1yr old connoisseur asked for 3rds.

I followed the advice of a number of the reviews and used what I had on hand.  I had leftover maple baked salmon (from AllRecipes!) and whole wheat rice.  I heat it up a little because cold rice is not too tasty.
I didn't have the radish so added thin slices of red peppers.
Easy and fancy lunch!  Thank you, it's a keeper.
